Absolutely awesome!  I honestly wouldn't bother making this recipe if I didn't have fresh tomatoes.  I don't think canned tomatoes would do this justice.  If your grocery store/sam's club/costco sells them, I would only use Campari tomatoes and they carry these all year long so you can enjoy this amazing "summer-like" dish even in January as I did!  I used 16 oz of spaghetti, 2.5 cups diced fresh tomatoes, 1/8 cup of olive oil, 5 small shallot (instead of onions) and 8 cloves of garlic.  I also increased the balsamic vinegar to 3 T (because we LOVE it!) and used a 1/2 cup of dry white wine in place of the chicken broth.  I added a pound of shrimp (which I cooked in this sauce as it simmered) because my husband doesn't feel pasta without some form of meat and seafood is truly a meal.  I think it would be just as good without the shrimp but the shrimp didn't detract from it at all.    Fresh Parmesan is a must for this recipe.  My 3.5 year old and my 21 month old DEVOURED this recipe!  4 thumbs up from us!!  DELISH!

Very yummy and light.  I used 1/2 chk broth and half white wine.  Also used a can of diced tomatoes with italian seasonings as other suggested.  I halved the amount of pasta stated.  Put the cracked black pepper and crused red pepper on the table so each person can add it to their personal preference!

I somewhat doubled the sauce and only used one box of angel hair pasta because I like everything I eat to be very saucy.  With the changes I made it came out more the way I like it.  I used 1/3 cup olive oil, 1/2 onion, 8 coves garlic, 5 cups chopped fresh roma tomatoes, 3 T balsamic vinegar, 4 cups broth, 2 T fresh basil, and added 1/2 cup cabernet sauvignon and some sea salt.  I think it could've used a little more wine and maybe a touch more sea salt.  The balsamic vinegar gives it a really good flavor.  It's a very light, fresh-tasing dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my goodness!  This is so simple and so delicious!  I thought it would be bland because of the few ingredients, but I was so wrong.  I followed the recipe, but I also took into consideration the other reviews.  As stated, the original recipe requires way too much pasta.  I completely omitted the chicken broth due to concerns of too much liquid.  Instead I used a bouillon cube and it easily dissolved in the juice released by the tomatoes.  I also added shrimp as suggested by the submitter of this recipe.  I don't think I needed the cheese really because this flavor really stands out on its own.

Absolutley delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe. So easy to make and the flavors of the ingredients were so complimentary of each other. The only change I made was that instead of using canned chicken broth I made my own using Better than Boullion.  I made as a side dish for dinner but am looking forward to serving it with grilled shrimp or chicken soon for a main course. I will definitely make this recipe again and again!! I also found that this recipe is delicous served cold, especially after allowing the flavors to "marry" overnight. I almost prefer it cold now as to serving it warm, especially during warm summer evenings!

This was wonderful & different.  I sauteed 2 chicken breasts with the garlic & onions, and also added a sliced zucchini.  I used about 1/2 the amount of pasta called for (I used linguini - all I had on hand), and used 1/2 chicken broth & 1/2 white wine.  Light, fresh and perfect for summer!  Will be making again, thanks for sharing.

I guess since I just finished my 3rd helping; this gets a hearty 2 thumbs up from me!!  What a great simple weeknight meal w/ingredients readily on hand.  This will def become a staple at our house.  I followed the recipe pretty much, except I didn't measure the onion (1/2 of a container of pre-diced), used a little more bottled minced garlic than called for, and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes (liquid drained).  Next time I will probably use a little less than a full can of chicken broth and  slightly less vinegar.  I might try adding some spinach for some extra nutrients.  Thanks!
UPDATE:  I made using baby spinach leaves (let them wilt in simmering mixture towards the end of simmer time) and it was a great way to make the dish a little more nutrient-dense.  Thanks, again, for a great weeknight meal in under 10 minutes!

This recipe is EXCELLENT!  I'm in school, so I don't have time to cook (nor do I cook extremely well), so I bought diced tomatos in a can, garlic that was already minced, and dried basil, and still the meal turned out great.  This is a must try!

I'll admit I was very skeptical as I was making this...but it turned out wonderfully!  I gave only 4 stars because I think that a pepper amount should be given for first timers to go by, instead of "to taste."  I made some changes to accomodate my eating habits, namely I did not use any oil.  Only a quick squirt of non-stick spray.  I only used 8 oz of chicken broth.  I also added a tsp of Splenda to accentuate the sweetness of the basil.  I served this with spaghetti squash instead of pasta, it was awesome!  I also topped it off with tofu chunks that I marinated in italian dressing and chicken bouillon granules and pan fried.  Will definately have this again, probably with chicken, as the tofu and spaghetti squash together made for great taste but to much "mush."

This is nearly a 5 star recipe.  My only 'complaint' (if you can even call it that) is that the ratio of pasta to sauce is too high, even if you prefer a lightly sauced pasta.  I made a 12 oz box of angel hair pasta, and still did not use all of the pasta.  The flavor of this dish however is fantastic, and it smells wonderful!  I did substitute white wine for half of the chicken broth, and used better than boullion for the other half.  I also added a handful of spinach leaves for nutrition as another reviewer stated, and chicken for my carnivorous husband who won't eat anything without meat.  So, although i did make a few adjustments to suit our tastes, flavor wise I stuck to the recipe for the most part.  I do highly recommend the white wine though as it really is complimentary to the tomatoes and balsamic vinegar.  The only thing I'll change next time is up the amount of tomatoes and liquid a bit.  Thank you for the recipe, it truly is one of my favorites (and I am very rarely impressed by recipes)!

Ive made this a couple times in the past and haven't rated it. But last night, my husband LOVED it. I read a few reviews and changed it up a bit. I used 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes in place of the romas and I used home made pesto instead of the basil. Everything else was the same! Delicious! Hubby wants it again next week!

This is really good and easy to make. I used two cans of diced tomatoes (not drained), and I had to use dried basil since I couldn't find any fresh. The next time I make this, I will cut back on the pasta or double the sauce.

Just wanted to mention that saving pasta water to use instead of chicken broth doesn't make the sauce as thin and is tastier than regular water.

I've made this a few times, just getting around to reviewing it. It's awesome! Easy comes together pretty quickly, and so yummy. Even when the dish is done and plated, it doesn't look like much and you kinda expect it be "ehh alright", but then you eat it and it's soooo good. I never have fresh basil but dried works great.

Excellent recipe!  I made this tonight and we really enjoyed it.  I used approx. 12 oz. of angel hair and a bit of white wine instead of some of the chicken broth based on other reviewers suggestions.  I also used a jar of drained, italian seasoned petite diced tomatoes- a new type put out by DelMonte- supposedly tasting more like fresh tomatoes- which really were quite good.  My husband thought this was similar to the Olive Garden's Pasta Pomodoro- quite a compliment from him!

My idea of a perfect pasta dish - flavorful and light. Used half the angel hair pasta but same amount of sauce.  Added leftover pork tenderloin but will make again with chicken or shrimp.

This was wonderful!!!!!  So easy and quick and YUMMY!!  My husband was skeptical being a tomato hater (except ketchup) & w/balsamic vinegar he was VERY unsure about this recipe, but once he tried it, he literally said he had to make himself stop eating this because all he wanted was MORE!!  Try it!!!!!!!!

WOW!  These flavors all work really well together.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the pasta from 16 oz to about 12 oz.  Other than that I made it exactly as written and it is delicious.

I used a can of petit diced tomatos because I wasn't going to run to the store for 2 tomatos. It was awesome. My fiancee likes more saucy things he complains about the lighter looking pastas. so i just added heavy whipping cream... he can be tricked so easily. I loved it

This recipe is awesome!! I add a pound (or sometimes 2 pounds) of peeled, cleaned raw shrimp at last step and it just bumps up a really great recipe to a wonderful and complete meal for company. Add crusty bread, a salad and you have a really really nice meal to entertain with...for guests or the family. eNJOY! We did.

I loved this recipe! but my very picky family only thought it was "okay".  The only change i made in this  was the balsamic vinegar - i didn't have any on hand so i used a mix of red wine vinegar & sugar (yes this is a valid substitution).  Other than that, i kept to the recipe exactly.  Would definitely make this again!  thank you for sharing!

Very excellent.  The only thing I do differently is that I add a clove of garlic, and a few splashes of wine into the sauce.

I definitely agree that the pasta-to-sauce ratio is way off. I tried this with the sauce recipe doubled, substituting half of the chicken broth with Chardonnay. After letting the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes, it tasted excellent, but that disappeared completely when I added the pasta (full 16 oz). The result, even with salt, red/black pepper, and parmesan cheese, was extremely bland. Granted, I'm was dealing with out-of-season tomatoes, but the flavor just didn't carry. Maybe the sauce needed less liquid/more time to reduce. I'm tempted to try it again because of the flavor of the sauce pre-pasta.

This was delicious! I did add chicken that I cooked in olive oil with garlic and red pepper. This is definitely a new favorite main dish but would be fantastic without the meat as a side dish. Thank you!

We loved this dish!  I used 1TBS. dried basil and added it when I added the balsamic vinegar.  I would probably double the amount of tomatoes next time just because I love tomatoes and they really do boil down!  Also, I didn't add the parm and I am glad I didn't....it was perfect!!!

This was good but I agree it is either not enough sauce OR too much pasta.  The only way I could ever imagine eating this is with fresh tomatoes.  Canned would make it too bland I think.  I also added some homemade sundried tomatoes and simmered my sauce past the 8 minute stage to ensure it was a thicker consistency.  So either double the sauce or half the pasta.  But I highly recommend you simmer that extra few minutes to get a condensed, high flavoured sauce that is out of this world.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great idea and I love cooking a pasta dish that is just as tasty as tomato sauce, but lighter and more tangy. I did make a few alterations to this recipe to make it a BIT more flavorful.

I substituted veggie broth for chicken (it worked wonderfully). I also added probably about 2 tablespoons extra balsamic vinegar, 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, and I also added some red wine I had on hand (probably about a 1/3 cup). Also, might I suggest adding oregano to taste, use a red onion, saute some portabello mushrooms , and use a can of Italian seasoned canned tomato as others have suggested. This might be a personal preference, but I found fresh cilantro shredded on top to be quite a delicious addition.

Okay, this may sound odd but I liked the sauce a lot more before I put it over noodles. I tasted it as it was cooking and it had so much flavor and tang; I loved it! When I put it over noodles the flavor really seemed to fade. I did add bell peppers, mushrooms, and chicken to the recipe.

The only things I did differently was I added a splash of white wine to the onion and garlic and some fresh (fried) mushrooms...wowowowowowowow...I will make this again and again and again.
Thanks for the recipe.

Love this pasta. Very simple, clean and easy to make. I did feel it was a tad oily so I will use a little less next time. Also, I think adding the cheese to individual servings would work better as it tends to clumps together.

This is pretty good, but I think it needs more spices or vinegar it was a little bland. I think I will double the balsamic vinegar next time and add some garlic salt.

I love the light sauce of this recipe.  Great way to use tomatoes from the garden.  The only thing I do different is add fresh sliced mushrooms or grated zucchini.  Serve with grilled shrimp is always a big hit at my house.

This recipe is simple to make but absolutely delicious.  I modified the recipe a little bit, though, to give it more flavor.  I used only half the pasta recommended, used more onion and LOTS more garlic.  I also used two cans of petite diced tomatoes to save time and it turned out great.  I also added about 1 tbsp each of oregano and fresh chopped parsley and some kosher salt to taste.  This is great with grilled chicken marinated in Italian dressing.  Serve with warm bread, a Carrabba's-style herb blend with olive oil, and a good Shiraz - a perfect dinner!

Fabulous, easy and forgiving if you're missing something.  I have substituted dry basil and canned tomatoes for fresh ingredients and it always turns out delicious.  This recipe is my fall-back weekday dinner.

Great Recipe!! Definitly use less pasta. Like the other users suggested..8-10oz. Tomatoes are versitile. I used cherry, and halved them. Also, use 1 tbsp of basil if dried. I really like this recipe, the addition of the fresh cheese is really nice.

I added about a teaspoon of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes, but we really enjoyed this. Tasted a lot like Olive Garden's capellini pomodoro, which is what I was looking for! :)

I had a fridge full of Roma tomatoes, red basil, red onion and garlic so decided to give this recipe a whirl using those ingredients plus the others in the recipe and the dish turned out to be amazing.  I did add an extra tomato, an extra clove of garlic.  I also seasoned the onions and garlic with salt and pepper while sauteing them in EVOO. I also added a little extra balsamic.  I usually tweak recipes and this time my tweaks worked to my advantage.  We couldn't stop eating it. This recipe was super delicious and easy to make; a great recipe to impress your friend or SO.  I served it with a side salad composed of romaine lettuce, red onion, sliced mushrooms, sliced avocado, salt, pepper, balsamic and EVOO e s squeeze of fresh lemon and topped with some of the left over Parmesan cheese. Thanks for sharing this recipe; I know I will make it again and again!  Next time with shrimp :)

As delicious as it is simple. BUT... when you are sauteing the onion and garlic, first, high heat (as called for) is too much, especially for the garlic. Instead, heat up your olive oil over medium high heat, add onion and saute for a few minutes. When almost done, reduce your heat to medium and add garlic and gently saute for a minute or two, then proceed with directions. Also, if you cook angel hair pasta for 8 minutes, I guarantee it will not be al dente. Watch it carefully and test frequently. It will only need to cook for about 4 minutes. Other than these changes, I added a few extra cloves of garlic and a bit more basil and even a dash of oregano. Super yummy!!

This is a great recipe. Have made it several times with thick spaghetti, but angel hair is best. Last night I made it without referencing the recipe. Mistakenly, I added a 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the sauce and brought it to a slow boil. It turned out to be wonderful. I'll keep the cream in. It made it special.

Great recipe but the sauce needs to be doubled!!Also if you intend on adding Chicken, I would suggest browning it first than add to sauce right away.

We really liked this dish!  After reading many reviews I decided to double the sauce (sort of) except the balsamic vinegar.  I used 4 C. fresh roma tomatoes, maybe 2-2 1/2 C. ckn broth, kept 2 T. balsamic as original recipe cuz it's VERY strong/tangy, 10 cloves of garlic (we like garlic), a VERY small onion & just a dash of red pepper. I needed to add a little salt, too.  Everything else the same (I think).  I needed to simmer for about 15-20 min. so it would cook down and not be so "soupy".  Added toasted pine nuts at the end--YUM!!  NOTE: Next time I will make sauce 1st then cook pasta.  Right after draining I'll add to sauce.  My angel hair was completely stuck together since it sat & could only use about 80% of it.  Most will have to tweak to their liking.  Will definitely make again!!

Made exactly as written except I did not have any basil on hand.  So quick and easy to make with wonderful taste enjoyed by all.  This is definitely a recipe to keep on hand for those busy days.  Thanks for posting.

Amazing!  Definitely use a good quality balsamic vinegar, bc that is what makes this dish.  My only comments are that I prefer more sauce and less pasta, so I'd double the sauce next time, and that olives or capers would be lovely with this dish--but then that would probably make in a puttanesca instead.  I didn't know where my parmesan cheese went, so I left it out and didn't really miss it.  I'm sure it would add to it, but you really don't have to have it in this for it to work.  Thanks for the recipe; I will definitely make this again!

I added a little too much crushed red pepper, but overall this recipe was pretty good! I'd make it again.

Great easy recipe.  Really scary when cooking since it looked like a soup rather than a sauce, but after adding the pasta it worked.  Could drain the tomatoes and/or add less broth next time.

This is one of my family's favorite recipe.  It is easy and simple and DELICIOUS!  Sometimes I add shredded chicken and sometimes I leave as is.  Most of the time I double this recipe because if I don't, we don't have leftovers for the next day's lunch.....and we all love it for lunch the next day.

I had problems with this receipe as is.  I doubled the sauce/tomato mixture but left the pasta the same.  Problem was, it was a bit bland and I could definitely see where wine might have added the "something missing."  Also I'd try something other than angel hair if I made it again (just a personal preference).  Husband wasn't crazy about it ... probably won't try again.

This was very good.  I made it for a dinner party, preparing all ingredients beforehand (chopping, cutting basil, measuring out the liquids), including pre-cooking pasta and some chicken.  When the guests were here, all I had to do was steps 2 & 3.  Very simple and in just 15 minutes, everything was ready.  I added chopped zucchini to the mix and the meal turned out great.  Served with a green salad and garlic bread.   Will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe - I can't wait to try it with fresh ingredients as indicated.  I was having a spaghetti-type craving but only had canned tomatoes, bouillon and dried herbs to work with.  I highly recommend this method if you're ever in a pinch - it's still fantastic!  I can't imagine how much better it will be once I make a run to the store!

Used canned tomatoes and used half the chicken broth and put in a half cup of white wine.  It came out absolutely excellent.  The balsamic vinegar and the white wine worked together fantastically as did everything else.  With regards to the crushed red pepper, remember that a little can go a long way, so know your audience.  A quick, easy, and delicious meal!

I make this recipe allll the time now, I love it! And so does my roommate who generally doesn't like tomatoes or onions.  I took other's advice though and use a little of red wine.  Serve with some grilled chicken and it is yummy!

I thought this was a little plain overall, especially if the roma tomatoes you used are not very flavourful to start off with...

I've got to admit, even after reading all the rave reviews, I was skeptical up until the time i took my first bite...  It's really good!  It's simple but it has lots of flavor.  I used all fresh ingredients and followed the recipe as is.  Freshly grated parmesan on top is a must.

We loved this - somehow it was both light AND hearty!  Really hit the spot.  Doubled the tomatoes and garlic, kept everything else the same.  Served it with homemade pizza and a salad.  YUM!

This was very good.  I used canned fire roast tomatoes because I didn't have fresh and it was very good.  It could only get better using fresh, I am sure.  The vinegar and red pepper really make this a flavorfull alternative to other tomato sauces.

We loved this.  I like things saucy too, so cut the pasta down to 8 ounces, used 5 cloves of garlic, about 4 chopped roma tomatoes and a 10 ounce can of diced tomatoes.  Yummy.  We've tried recreating a recipe like this from one of our favorite restaurants and my husband said this is the best it's ever turned out.  Must be the balsamic vinegar and chicken stock!

Omitted water (just used powdered chicken broth) and red pepper. Very easy and yummy. Would definitely work as a main dish with chicken.

I prepared this recipe last night. I added sauteed shrimp. Otherwise followed the recipe. The next time I make this I will double the sauce or cut back on the angel hair pasta. Also salt could be added. 2 ( 8 oz ) packages of pasta is too much for the amount of sauce called for.  The flavor was wonderful and I will make this again.  Thank you.

So easy, and very good.  I added 1.5 lbs of defrosted and drained cooked shrimp, and decreased the angel hair to 12 ounces - that was plenty for 4.  The tomatoes didn't add much to the flavor, but they made the dish more visually appealing.    Served with french bread.

Very good! This was our first try at homemade italian and we were pleased. We doubled the fresh basil, added an extra couple cloves of garlic and added 1 serrano pepper and a handful of sliced mushrooms (at the same time we added the balsamic). Delicioso!

I make this all the time, especially when I'm in a hurry.  It takes only about 10 minutes to make.  I have never used balsamic vinegar before but I'm afraid it would ruin the taste.  To me, it's all about the garlic, fresh tomatoes and fresh basil!

I cut this recipe way down...there are just three of us and I only eat very small amounts of pasta. But, someone had Pomodoro when I was out to lunch with them recently and I thought it looked simple to recreate. I had some Byrdhouse Blistered Cherry Tomatoes left over and decided to add them (without chopping) to the sauce at the very end and it put this over the top, in my opinion. I let the sauce simmer much, much longer than the recipe suggested and it was thick and very tasty. Everyone loved it and we'll definitely have it again...it's so easy you'll memorize the recipe the first time you make it.

I really love this recipe, I usually opt for half vegetable broth and half white wine instead of beef (easy vegetarian change) I also add mushrooms, they pick up the taste wonderfully and add another serving of veggies! Definately try it!

I found that it was necessary to simmer the sauce quite a bit longer than what the recipe called for in order to reduce the liquid. The final results were delicious.

Very similar to what Pasta Luna served before changing chefs.  I make  1-1/2 times the sauce the original recipe calls for then add 1 pound backfin crabmeat and 1-2 pound cooked shrimp plus extra basil.

This pasta recipe was quite good. I'd have to say, while not spectacular, this meal was filling & quite tasty. It's just as good reheated!

This was great!  We just returned from a trip to Italy, and this was just like "The Mama"  made in the restaurants there!  Agree, add less pasta, but I actually added a bit more vinegar.  I recommend the good stuff with the balsamic, don't use the general balsamic because it's not as sweet and mellow.  I also cooked my pasta in water with some chicken base added.  The whole family loved it.

This recipe was very easy to make and WONDERFUL in flavor. I followed a couple of the reviews. I used a can of diced tomatoes with italian seasoning, halved the broth and added some white wine for the other half. And definately halved the amount of noodles. There were a lot. Be careful on the crushed red pepper, less is more.  Great recipe.

As lacto-ovo Vegetarian's we often don't find many recipes to share with our friends.  This was by far a keeper for Friday night.

Used: about 1 teaspoon red pepper, at least 1/2 plus t. of fresh black pepper and vegetable broth. Fresh home grown basil, fresh grated cheese.  Em, if that wasn't enough, a box of 13.5 oz. whole wheat spaghetti. Eaten with no bread!

Unfortunately this dish did not have much taste even though all the ingredients smelled great as they were added to the pot.  The recipe definitely called for too much pasta as I used one box for 4 people and we had plenty left over.  I only differed from the recipe by adding some shrimp and mushrooms, but I am sure glad I did because it would have been way to bland without them.  All in all, this was not worth the time put into it as there are much better recipes to make that will taste much better.

Great Recipe!!  I followed the other reviews and used about half the chicken broth and I used dried basil-but just half the amount-  I also only used half the vinegar and half the amount of pasta!!  Great flavor however.  I will definitely use this recipe again!!!

I visited an Italian Restaurant Called "Tucci Benucch" and had their Angel Hair Pomodoro that was out of this world.  I went on the Internet and found this recipe and I swear it tastes just like the one they serve.  I never dreamed it would be so easy to make. I have been sharing this recipe with everyone. PERFECT!!

This is scrumptious!!!! I've made it at least 3 times in the last week. It's great to reheat for lunch. I made it along with salad and bruschetta, and it was a hit!!! I added a chicken stock cube to the chicken broth for a bit more flavor and lots more tomatoes and basil. Delicious!!!!!

This  recipe was spot on. I added a little bit more garlic more tomatoes and a bit more basil the  second time I made it. Just because aka  Experimenting   Absolutely delicious no need to tweak. All up to you. Delicious as it is.  To add a bit of fullfillness. Side of sweet Italian sausage. Yummmmy!

I did make a few changes with this recipe, so if you're wanting it verbatim, you'll have to make it yourself. 
 I used  canned, petite-diced tomatoes, instead of those inedible hydroponic things from the store, as well as  poblano pepper , and a shake of dried cayenne pepper.  Use of commercially-processed products is generally NOT my idea of cooking . ( The canned tomatoes are OK,...  canned sauces and broths are  not ! )
You can reduce sodium a lot better by boiling a skinned chicken thigh and reserving  the chicken for another use.

The critical ingredient here is that balsamic vinegar.  Do not omit it.  Just boil the angel hair  maybe 3 minutes, before adding to the mixture, then simmer just long enough for the spaghetti to absorb the excess broth.

First time making this. Followed the recipe to a "T" because I firmly believe in making something by the books first and then seeing what tweeks it needs to fit my needs. I was very pleased with how great this recipe tasted. It was light, but filling. The balsamic vinegar is really what brings this dish home. It just adds that extra zing. Another thing I liked about this dish is how customizable it can be. Next time I make it, and there will be a next time, I will probably throw in some sauteed chicken breast strips or shrimp. My only complaint is there was WAY to much pasta for sauce.

This is so good! I used the best ingredients: homegrown tomatoes and basil right out of my neighbors garden. I used 1 cup of homemade chicken broth from my freezer with a couple of ounces of white wine. (I don't use canned broth, so the wine made up for the difference in liquid) and real freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano. The only other changes I made: I did not sauté the onions and garlic on high. Garlic burns in a New York minute ( meaning a couple of seconds) and because overly brown garlic and onions are bitter and can ruin the sauce, I cut the heat down a couple of notches and sautéed the onion for a few minutes, then added the garlic for a brief sauté before adding the other ingredients. And because I added wine, I went higher on the heat to burn off the raw wine taste. Cooked for maybe 9 minutes, then added the fresh basil and pepper, etc. but here's what will tighten up the sauce and take the flavor over over the top ( learned this from a top notch northern Italian chef): throw in a healthy chunk of butter, 1-2 Tablespoons. This little addition gives such depth to the sauce. As for the complaints on the lack of red pepper measurement, my advice: just start with a couple of shakes then TASTE it and add more to suit your heat tolerance.Everyone is different when it comes to that, that's why the recipe is "too taste." Also I did not use the entire pound of pasta, but close. I did reduce my sauce quite a bit to burn off the raw wine taste so my sauce was slightly less.

The best one yet; I was not sure about the balsamic vinegar, but did as instructed. I don't measure when I cook and this one is foolproof! I will tell you to NOT add the cheese until plated; the cheese will just stick to the pot. Thank you for this recipe, it is in my recipe box now!

Whatever is one step above a staple is what this recipe is in our home. We alternate vegetarian, chicken, shrimp, or (my favorite) sweet Italian sausage. Canned tomatoes seem to work just fine, but without the fresh grated parmesan, this recipe is just a bowl of noodles. Can't explain how it happens, but the fresh parmesan transforms this dish into something amazing.

Fixed the recipe as presented.  Way to much pasta for the rest of the ingredients!  We wanted to make it a complete dinner with shrimp.  Added 1 lb. of medium shrimp and they disappered.  There was enough pasta to feed 6-8 people and the rest of the ingredients were not enough.  A fix:  use 8 oz. pasta with all of the rest staying the same.  Next time will use 11/2 lbs. shrimp.  Flavor was great and be sure to use fresh basil if available.

For as little ingredients and effort I first thought there is no way. This was so, so good. The only change I made was using 1/2 whit wine and 1/2 chicken broth. I also took advice of another reader and added spinach and the end. The hubby loved it!!

Not Bad, not bad at all.  I discovered I didn't have angel hair so I used macaroni noodles instead.  It turned out pretty well though.  In addition to the parm, I also added some shredded motz which gave it a little more of a cheesy texture, and I absolutely loved the blend of the balsamic and tomatoes so I added a dash more vinegar. Delicious!  Even If my kids didn't really care for this, both my husband and myself enjoyed it tremendously.  The only thing I think I'll change, is next time, I'll take DEBNJAMES' advice and add some chicken to the mix, yum! :)

This was excellent!  A whole package of noodles, however, is way too much unless you double the sauce.  I wouldn't change a thing otherwise.

This is one of my favorite dinners yet. I added 2 cans diced tomatoes with basil and oregano, extra garlic, and used red wine and sugar instead of vinegar. I also added shrimp and it was amazing!

This has a good flavor; homegrown tomatoes are the only way to go!  I used only 1/2 package of pasta and that was plenty.  I may cut it down to 1/3 next time because we like our pasta saucy.  It would be good with shrimp as suggested; I'll try that too.  This is a great recipe because it's stuff I have on hand.  Quick and easy, thanks!

Great recipe! I was really short handed in the fridge this week, so I didnt' have most of the ingredients, so I improvised and it came out really great. Instead of tomatoes I used 1 cup of plain, pre-made spaghetti sauce, and instead of onions, i used a tablespoon of onion poweder and mixed it with the garlic as it was sauteeing. We've been eating pasta a lot lately and we're all getting sick of it, but this was a great way to get a new flavor on an old dish. Thanks again!

Love this easy recipe.  Used tiny diced tomatoes (husband doesn't like tomatoes) and less angel hair as suggested.  Even my picky kids eat it.

Because of the rave reviews, I planned to make this for a family get-together, but because I was a bit skeptical I decided to try it out before serving it to family.  I'm glad I did because this recipe is very strange, and not in a good way.  It's somewhat bland and the balsalmic and onion together makes for a really meaty and unusual taste.  Plus, the very small amount of red pepper I used also made the dish pretty spicy.  I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

This was a very, very good dish. My mother and I made it together and enjoyed it very much, so easy to make. But I will have to say that you need to be careful how much crushed red pepper you add to this dish, add just a little, if its not enough later, you can always add more when you are ready to eat. Taste test it first! :)

Good as written but better if you cut the pasta in half.  Be liberal with the garlic and red pepper if you like more flavor.

Delish!  Used crushed basil in a tube, was wonderful.  I added spinach at the end as another reviewer suggested...it added nice color and was an easy way to get extra veggies in our diet.  We added three chicken breasts.  Yum!

So good!!! Followed the recipe close, the only change was that we used 1/2 the olive oil. The next time I think I'll double the balsamic vinegar because I was hoping to taste that flavor a bit stronger but it was really really good anyway - yum - we'll have this again!!

Excellent flavor!  I made this cutting the amount of pasta by half and using canned tomatoes seasoned with basil, garlic and oregano.  For the liquid I used half white wine and for the other half I used the liquid I drained from the tomatoes (why throw it away?) and made up the difference with chicken broth.  I also used green onions instead of regular.  I made the sauce early in the day, thickening it with just a little corn starch and chicken broth; then refrigerated it.  When reheating I added some shrimp, as suggested by the submitter, and cooked them right in the sauce.

This was pretty good. I made this after eating the dish at an Italian restaurant where it was to die for. For this, I cut the pasta in half and used whole wheat. Almost doubled the garlic. Nice light pasta.

A great, pretty easy recipe! I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves since that's what I had on hand, and red pepper flakes instead of crushed red pepper.  If using flakes, be careful how many you add - I thought I was being conservative but it still ended up pretty spicy!

I have made this recipe a lot of ways: no vinegar, with chopped stuffed olives, artichoke hearts, asparagus, shrimp, chicken, fontinella or asiago cheese etc. I don't think there is a way to mess  it up.

This recipe was a hit tonight!  I added fresh mushrooms and fresh red peppers when I preparing the onions and garlic.  I served it with shrimp.    I used wheat linguine.  It was very good!  I'll try it again with chicken and scallops would be great too.  Thanks for a very easy, very healthy and delicious recipe.

I tried this recipe today and loved it.  I used less than half the pasta as I like lots of sauce.  Then at the last minute I added some pine nuts.  I used both white wine and chicken broth, probably more than it called for.  I planned on adding shrimp, then forgot so we had a veggie dish.  With what we have left over I plan to add the shrimp.  I think the balsamic vinegar makes the dish.  Please don't leave it out.

I love this recipe as is!  It is perfect!  If you like massive amounts of tomatoes like I do then just cut up a few extra.  I also LOVE garlic so sometimes I add an extra clove or two.  Enjoy!

I have been making this dish for years. I didn't know it had a name. I thought I made it up. I use regular tomatoes from the garden bc I don't care for the romas. Sometimes I don't even simmer them, just the garlic, sometimes I add onions, sometimes not. I usually add fresh parsley along with the fresh basil and extra, uncooked olive oil just before it is eaten.  It usually needs salt because of the tomatoes. This is also good with the addition of shrimp if you are cooking the tomatoes. I have made it with and without the vinegar. White wine is also good in it if you don't want to use the vinegar. I always at least double the sauce, if not triple for 1 pound of pasta. Good over linguine too.

this was aahhhhmazing!!!! I altered to only use one box of angel hair pasta, but followed the recipe otherwise... I would suggest using more tomatoes as one review said.  this was great with grilled chicken on top.  Just sprinkle chicken with pepper and montreal seasoning and some garlic powder and grill... YUM!!!

Simple, yet delicious recipe!  I would just like to find something to substitute the chicken broth with for personal reasons; maybe I'll try it with vegetable broth next time... Other than that, very pleased with it!

This was awesome.  I did make some additions though.  I added 1/3 cup sliced black olives and 1 1/2 Tbs. of capers a few twists of ground sea salt and shave Parmesan.   My husband is a HARD critic and he even gave it 5 stars.

Great tasting recipe!!  I also made a few additions.  I too did not use two packages of pasta I only used one.  I also added seared chicken breast which enhanced the flavor.  This is a wonderful tasting, quick, simple receipe.  Thank you!

I am a sucker for Pasta Pomodoro.   If it is on a menu, I order it.  So I was excited to try to make it at home.  The recipe was good.  This dish is light and refreshing and allows all the great flavors to shine through.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was terrific. The family all liked, even though I added shrimp and more veggies to it. I added  more tomatoes (canned diced), chopped spinach, peas, red onion and a ton more fresh basil. Like some reviewers, I thought there would not be enough "sauce" so I just used 1/2 the pasta. Still had 4 nice servings for us. Thank you, for the recipe,  DEBNJAMES and, "Virginia Mom"  for suggesting (on the AR Echange) a new recipe that I will make again and again.

I made the "sauce" as directed except for adding a few more cloves of garlic and dried basil.  I did only use half the chicken broth since so many reviews complained of it being soupy.  I let it reduce for about 10 minutes and then added the cooked pasta.  I used a hefty pinch of red pepper flakes so it had some heat but we like it that way.  I had about 2/3 of a box of angel hair pasta which was almost too much for this amount of sauce.  This is better than what I get at Olive Garden!

Love this recipe, so light and yummy. I have made it many times, sometimes with fresh tomatoes (better) and sometimes with a can of italian-seasoned tomatoes (not bad.)

Delicious!  I added zucchini to mine (had a random pregnancy craving for it!) and white beans for protein.  Put a little sauce aside and added shrimp for my hubby.  We both loved it.

I had to mix and match because I didn't have everything exact.  I had red wine vinegar instead of balsamic and I didn't have fresh basil....which is really too bad.  I also didn't have fresh parm...just the dry stuff you keep you in the fridge.  Nice flavour still despite all the changes.

Really good! I tossed in some shrimp & added  1/2 cup white wine, 3-4 Tbsp. tomato paste with a pinch of sugar & 1 Tbsp. chicken base. This makes a larger amount than I expected, so it looks like lunch is planned for tomorrow!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I make this about once a week and it is a family favorite. Only real modifications I made were adding a tablespoon of chicken base to the sauce after the broth and adding a little more olive oil. The chicken base will make it much richer. Extremely versatile.

After reading some of the reviews, I prepared this dish tonite with a few changes.  I used 12 oz. of pasta, and believe me, it was more than enough for 4 people, with ample sauce to cover.  I added more garlic and basil than was listed; other than that I followed the rest of the recipe.  Everyone enjoyed the dish, and would like to have it again.  It wasn't a huge WOW, but was the perfect dish for a hot evening.  Thank you for the recipe!!

This turned out really, really good. I made a few changes to this recipe: no balsamic vinegar, dried basil not fresh, added 1 cut up chicken breast half, used one 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes. Even my 2 yr old loved this. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is a very good recipe. I added slices of Italian hot sausage and artichoke hearts but the basic sauce itself is very tasty. I think the balsamic vinegar is the difference. I made enough for four but my wife and I finished it all at one setting.

This was an average sauce.  I thought the final product was too oily.  I wish I had cut back on it.  I don't think I'll make it again.  But it wasn't bad.

This is a delicious and light pasta!  I only made a fourth of the recipe because its only 2 of us and I used it as a side dish.  Definitely will make this again!  UPDATE: I have made this many of times and it is soooo good!  I love how light it is but still is full of flavor.  I have found the perfect pair for this recipe, and it is the braised balsamic chicken recipe here on the site.  They pair perfect together!  Even if I dont make the chicken with this, it is great with anything!  So good!  Its a favorite dish of mine!

I thought this turned out light and delicious - nice and easy too.  It really hit the spot for me.  Mine did end up somewhat "saucy" and so if using angel hair pasta, I would probably cut back on the chicken broth next time - - otherwise, I will keep everything as is and choose a different noodle (penne or something along those lines).  All in all, very tasty.  Thank you for the recipe.

My husband and I both loved this. To make it quicker, I used canned diced tomatoes and omitted the chicken broth. We left off the parmesan cheese as we didn't have any, and thought it was great without it.

Excellent!!  Also sauteed and added orange, yellow and red sweet peppers.  They really added a nice touch.  To spice it up I also added more red pepper flakes.  Also cut back to 1/2 the amount of pasta and it was perfect.  Used 1 can of DelMonte petite cut canned diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil.  Very good and quite tasty!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!! Yummmmmmmy!

5 stars for me, 4 for my husband.  He thought it was lacking a bit of flavor, but he likes lots of sauce.  I did halve the pasta amount, and it turned out PERFECT.  Delicious, delicately spicy, and excellent the next day as well.  I forgot to add the basil before serving, so that might account for the flavor slight.  Will make again!!

Great recipe.  I made a few changes after reading the comments of others.  You definately need to 1/2 the pasta, I doubled the garlic and ensure that you use fresh grated parmesan.  I am traditionally a fan of pasta with a heavy cream base which this one obviously is not, but now I have a new favorite.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! My whole family loved it. I used a full onion instead of 1/2 and I used 8 cloves of garlic, and canned diced tomato. I also used 2 boneless-skinless chicken breast, I fried both fired with some spices, some Cajun, cayenne, and black pepper, and the finished product is outstanding... Thanks for sharing !

My husband and I really liked it!  I gave it a little pep by decreasing the chicken broth by half and adding 1/2 cup white wine.  I added chopped fresh zuchinni with the tomatoes and ground cooked italian sausage at the end.  Yummy!

This is really a delicious and easy verison of this dish. I use fresh roma tomatoes from my garden and usually add in a little extra basil and it's just perfect. Add freshly grated Parmesan Asiago cheese and it's even better. My husband really enjoys it, too. He doesn't like heavy tomato sauces so this is perfect for him.

I used a good quality vegetable broth to make this vegetarian.  It was fabulous!  My husband loved it.  Even with dried basil (I didn't have any fresh on hand) it tasted like a restaurant dish.  I served it with spinach salad; the meal was a hit.  Add this one to your recipe box!

The balsamic vinegar and fresh basil make a great combo. We used 1/2 the oil and it still came out great.

Wonderfully light and delicate.  Scaling recipe up to large group = too much pasta -- use common sense when buying noodles.

It wasn't terrible, but won't be making again.

Very tasty and so easy to make! The parmesan cheese on top really melds the flavors together. The second time I made it, I added about one cup of extra tomatoes so that the pasta had a little more texture. This is a new staple in our household!

I LOVED this! This recipe is perfect for when you have a bunch of tomatoes hanging around that you don't know what to do with. It's got heat with the chili pepper and it cools slightly with the basil; I added cut up chicken tenderloins while the sauce cooked and it did not seem to take away from the sauce (it did require a few extra minutes). This recipe is great for a weekend night at home when you want to feel "dressy casual" and have a few glasses of wine while you cook.

I’m not sure what went wrong along the way, but my sauce ended up too watery, the tomatoes too mushy, and aesthetically it just looked like dark stew. The taste was okay until I added the red ground pepper, which for some reason seemed to accentuate the vinegar taste. It wasn’t terrible, but far off from what I’ve been reading in the raving reviews.

This was so simple and easy to adapt based on what I had on hand.  I used canned diced tomatoes and added chicken.  Next time I would reduce the amount of pasta.  Maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of the box.  I think this would be really good with shrimp.

The dish was good I added shrimp to the dish and more tomato and garlic. If you make 1lb of pasta you will definitely need the extra tomato either wise it will be too dry.

YUM. First go, I more or less made the recipe as stated, and it was good.

Subsequent times, I made changes, and it went from good into WOW. I doubled the sauce, used chicken bouillon cubes instead of broth (did not add water, just the cubes), added a 10 oz can of clams, a healthy splash of white wine, and dried basil instead of fresh. 

We love this recipe with clams and white wine, the flavor is superb -- my husband told me it might just be the best thing I've ever made!! He thinks it tastes just like the $17-a-plate clam pasta at one of the waterfront restaurants in our area. :)

I made this pretty much exactly as the recipe called for and loved it. We eat a lot of quick pasta recipes in my house and I liked the fresh tomatoes with the red pepper flakes and Parmesan cheese. Added a little extra red pepper to my own plate.;)

This recipe worked great, but I would either double the sauce or halve the angel hair pasta, as the ratio was definitely wrong.

Loved this recipe for a quick, light weeknight meal! It came together quickly. I made it as is, added chicken as suggested, but think it would be excellent with shrimp.  Next time I make it I will add some veggies, zucchini would be excellent!

I didn't have anything, sonI had to make some tweaks. I used well drained cans of petite diced tomatoes instead of Roma tomatoes. I used 1tsp dried basil instead of fresh. Also, I'll use less oil next time since I don't think 1/4c is necessary. So good with the modifications! It would be even better with the fresh ingredients!! 

P.S. I omitted the red pepper because I always do.

My family really liked this pasta.  I made it pretty much exactly as the recipe said and it did seem like maybe too much pasta for the sauce so I just left some of the noodles aside.  There was plenty for the 5 of us. The 2nd time, I doubled all the sauce ingredients and used the pasta quantity listed.  This gave us a bit more "sauce" that we prefer and now there are leftovers as well.  This is not a heavy sauce type of pasta dish!  It's flavorful and light and great when you just need a nice quick pasta. A keeper!

Made this twice now and both times my family tucked in with seconds and thirds. Comfort food and quick. I made it with fresh tomatoes and peppers.

A simple pasta recipe for when you don't want a pasta dish with traditional, thick tomato sauce. I used beef bullion because it was all I had on-hand, balsamic vinegar salad dressing (again, all I had), added 1/2 cup white wine and chunks of fresh mozzarella instead of Parmesan. I also used half the pasta-- very important if you want the dish to have enough flavor. My husband loved it, and I thought it was great too.

This had really good flavor however, it was hard to taste for the large quantity of noodles. I would probably double everything except noodles.

Easy and quick. I added red wine and simmered for at least an hour. I partially cooked pasta and added it to the pan to finish cooking. I added not fully sauted chicken at the end. Just before serving stir in chopped basil. Top was Parmesan. Great recipe.

? This is going into the rotation!  Based on the calories and the fact that 2 oz of pasta is one serving, I believe the 16 oz package was in error, and was meant to be 8 oz.  I cut the recipe in half and used 4 oz, spaghetti, but still used 4 cloves of garlic, and added 1 cup diced roast chicken.  Really phenomenal!  Next time, zucchini or wilted spinach additions will make it an awesome 1-skillet meal.  I was surprised at how much I loved it, even without butter or cream! ?

We made this for dinner last night for the first time and as I write this I am eating leftovers for lunch.  Wonderful and delicious.  I only subbed canola oil for the olive (personal choice) and did not add the crushed red pepper for the kids.  This recipe will be made often.

I made as directed, but found it a little bland. Added a lot of salt and pepper, as well as quite a bit of grated parmesan to jazz it up a little. Red pepper flakes gave it heat but not substance to the flavor.

Wonderful! I used fresh tomatoes and added a bit more garlic, basil and pepper. Sometimes i add sliced chicken breast. This can be added as the sauce cooks, to make the chicken really tender and flavorful. Or, pan-fry or grill the chicken separately and top on pasta. Shrimp works too!

I am unbelievably happy to have found this recipe...I have made it twice now and can't wait to make it over and over again.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, the only thing that I couldn't get my hand on was FRESH basil, so I used (for the first time) the organic kind that you get in the tube, and it was just fine.  The 2nd time I made it, I added some cooked chicken to it, and just as good as the first time.  Such a simple dish yet incredible taste in my opinion!!

Thought this would be the same old pasta, tomato, basil recipe....but it is amazing how the balsamic vinegar gave it a new flavor!  Awesome! My son, the pasta afficionado couldn't get enough.  I used 3 TBS of balsamic  and had to reduce the tomato saute to thicken the sauce. Used a splash of white wine but will do the 50/50 wine and broth mix next time.  Thanks for this delicious and simple recipe!

This really came out nice. Quick and Easy as advertised. I sauteed chicken breasts with the onions and garlic for added protein. I would add more chicken stock as the lb of pasta really soaks up the moisture in the pan. A substitute for added chicken stock would be to re-add some of the pasta water this would also add some salt back into the recipe.

I think this could've used more sauce; it was a little on the bland side.  Maybe increase everything except the pasta by 50%?  My family loved it, however.

Wow! I made this with what I could find in my kitchen (which wasn't much), and it was awesome! I used half the pasta called for, the garlic, one can of rotel tomatoes with the juice, balsamic vinegar, one small can of chicken broth, dehydrated onion, a couple dashes of cayenne pepper and fresh ground black pepper. Also used dried parsley, and reserved a bit of the pasta water in case it was needed and also added that. Some parmesan cheese and it was flavorful and spicy! Can't wait to get to the store to make the recipe as listed.

These recipe is so easy to cook. I have cooked it twice, I cooked it once with the original recipe. My boyfriend loves spicy foods so this second time I added red pepper flakes and substituted the roma tomatoes, with S&W ready-cut Italian Recipe with garlic oregano and basil. And left out the 2 TBS of basil, kept the 4 cloves of garlic.

This tasted great!  I added some chicken breast to round out the meal, but would also be great with a vegetable side to be totally vegetarian.  REALLY TASTY.  Husband asked for seconds and commented twice that he really like it - wow- definitely a keeper for dinner.

I have a large family so I doubled the recipe and added about 16 oz of leftover salmon (prepared from the 'Grilled Salmon I' recipe we had the night before).  I also used fettuccine instead of angel hair pasta as recommended.  Even my 9 year old (aka the pickiest eater in the world) loved it!  BTW he loved the salmon the night before as well!

Delicious!  I used about 12 oz. of pasta and reduced the broth to 8 oz. I left the rest as called for.

Love this dish!  Next time, I will add 1/2 can of broth and 1/2 can water.  No need for a whole can.  Delicious and will definitely make again!  :)

very tasty and simple.  I can't wait until summer when I can try fresh tomatoes in this instead of canned, I think it would take it from a 4 to a 5.  **Update. I tried it with fresh tomatoes out of my garden, and it did bump it up to a 5.  Delicious!

I loved this recipe.  I, too, made some changes - I added some frozen asparagus & broccoli florets as well as cooked chicken to make more of a meal out of it.  I also added white wine, chicken broth, 8 cloves of garlic, & 3 small onions to give it more flavor. I didn't have angel hair pasta on hand so used vermicielli.  Will definitely make again !!!

It was good, but not great.  It needs more garlic, more fresh basil as it was bland.  I also added a bit of salt to it.

I followed many of RedVinoGirl's suggestions, using 2.5 large shallots, 8 cloves of garlic, .5 cop white wine, 3T balsamic vinegar. I did use the roma tomatoes per the original recipe. I have to say, it's not often that I enjoy my own cooking but this was excellent! We'll definitely have this again. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was tasty, but it wasn't a 'wow' dish. For it to suit my taste, I added salt and more balsamic vinegar to round it out for me. On the other hand, my wife really liked it (that is after I secretly added the salt and balsamic to her dish as well!).

Wow, absolutely fantastic! I took the recommended 3T of balsamic vinegar, part chicken broth/white wine and added extra basil and red pepper flakes.  My husband thought it was one of the best pastas ever!  Me too!!

Yum!  This was delicious.  Didn't have enough fresh tomatoes so used a can of them, which meant that it had more water, so I skipped the broth and added some chicken base instead.  Tried it with kielbasa added and it was scrumptious!  Thanks for the easy recipe.

Add chicken for more protein and wheat pasta for more protein, fiber and healthier carbs.  Great meal for the family!  Add red pepper at the end if you have kids with sensitive pallets.

It came out quite successfully for me. Although I do agree it was slightly bland...HOWEVER, since I didn't have red pepper handy, I added a scoop of tostitos salsa and it improved the flavor sooo much! I used dried basil and it turned out well even. Such a simply and easy recipe. Next time I'll add mushroom and some other vegetarian stuff for more flavor and to eliminate the need for cheese since my goal is to become vegan. Thanks for this!

So simple and amazing.  Only thing I did different was I sauteed shrimp and added the dried red pepper flakes to the shrimp then mixed it all in with the pasta.  Left overs were even better.

This by far one of the best recipes I have ever made! It was delicious and my roommate was even raving about it! I just used fresh diced tomatoes that I picked up from the store! I also served this dish with some delcious Balsamic Brushetta! This was simple to make and very good to eat! Two Thumbs up!

Very good, but I needed the parmesean cheese (and a hint of garlic salt) to bring out the taste. At first it tasted a bit bland to me. Next time I'll half the liquid and also use white wine to see if I get different results, but this is definitely going into my rotation.

Excellent! It is one of my favorite dishes when I go to a good Italian restaurant. You can't beat the fresh flavor of tomatoes and basil. I omitted the chicken broth and used 1 tsp. "Better than Broth" chicken base. The balsamic vinegar gives this a wonderful flavor.

It was ok but the balsamic overpowered the delicate flavor of the fresh tomatoes.

Fantastic! I had a lot of roma's come ripe that i needed to use up, made it w/ 1/2 the pasta amount and used linguine, doubled the garlic and after combining added browned italian sausage bites and fresh spinach and tossed then added parmesan. lots of fresh flavors, but not a heavy tomato sauce type dish. thanks!

I made this recipe last night and it was wonderful.  I added chicken since hubby likes chicken.  Next time, I'll try the shrimp.  I agree with another reviewer that fresh tomatoes are a must and I will also use some white wine next time along with the broth.  I only used 8oz pasta and 1T vinegar since there's just two of us.  Also didn't use the red pepper.  Very good recipe and will definitely make it again.  Thanks for posting.

How is it possible not to like vine ripened tomatoes and garlic? This recipe is a basic summer dish. But if you really want to jack up the flavor this is it: ANCHIOVIES!!!! Saute as many as you like with the onion/garlic. Pure happiness!

This is a fantastic and easy meal.  I loved it!!!  I did add a bit of roasted chicken left in the fridge and some shrimp and had a restaurant-quality meal in minutes.  Half-way through, I realized I had forgotten the basil, and it was still awesome!

This is a great recipe as is and also as a base to add on to. I only made a couple changes: sauteed chicken breasts in the olive oil first then removed them and added the onions and garlic to the pan. After cooking for a couple minutes, I deglazed the pan with a little white wine then added the remaining ingredients and followed the recipe as it was originally written.

This was yummy.  The chicken that I added to it, was the chicken from the Chicken Scarpariello.  The two together were very good.  I did use canned tomatoes.  IMO they are every bit as good as fresh.  I am not a pro or anything, and have no reason to base it other than it is just my opinion but I was thinking that I had heard from a food network show, Giada it seems, that they can them at the peak of freshness so they can work just as well for some dishes.  I used the Italian stewed ones so I just feel they have plenty of time to marinate in the other seasonings, so I really enjoyed the flavors.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

easy & delish!  I added the garlic near the end of the onion's cooking time because we like a strong garlic taste.  I also didn't have any fresh basil so used dry.  This is definitely a saver.  I think it may have been even be better when I heated up as leftovers because it took on the spices more as it sat :)

This really is delicious and SO easy to make.  Advice, you can either half the amount of pasta (so just use half of your standard box; I've never seen sketti sold in 8 oz packages) or you can double the "sauce".  Absolutely delish...

I tried this a week ago and enjoyed.  I concur; if you can't do with fresh tomatoes, don't bother.  I was wary about the balsamic vinegar, not a fan, but it added a subtle touch and next time I'd use the suggested amount.  An easy healthy dish for hot summer days.

Delicious!  Used the half chicken stock half white wine suggestion and added uncooked peeled deveined shrimp while the liquid was simmering.  I was a little concerned about the amount of liquid, but the angel hair pasta soaked it right up.  Grated pecarino romano cheese to finish and served with garlic bread.  Fantastic!  Great recipe.

Wow.. I read the recipe and all the reviews and followed the recipe exactly with ALL fresh ingredients; the only addition being fresh steamed broccoli & chunks of cooked chicken breast.  Please don't stone me but I thought it was so boring and tasteless.  I altered the recipe to make it for two and it still made a huge amount.  I'm only giving it one star because it used fresh ingredients.

Excellent recipe, easy to follow & easy to customize! I am vegetarian so I used vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth, increased the tomatoes to 2 1/3 cup and added a tsp of white sugar. MMM! WOW! It was so good that I made a 2nd batch of it right after we finished eating the first batch (same day LOL).

Really great!!!  First time I made it the way it was written.  Second time.. I made these changes:  used whole wheat rotini ..after I drained the pasta I cut up fresh asparagus and parched in pasta water for about 5 minutes. I used lots of fresh sliced garlic (we like lots of flavor) used a lot more basil then called for. Used just enough red pepper to give it a little bite.  Great recipe and can be adjusted to suit individual taste.

Yummy and easy!! I think we often forget that boxes of pasta are 16oz - not 8oz...therefor 2 boxes would be wayyyyy too much - but 1 16oz box is good.  I used canned, diced tomatoes with italian spices, 1 cup water leftover from pasta and a buillon cube.  I will probably use an additional can of diced tomatoes next time! Added some grilled chicken and it was super good! Thanks for sharing!!!!

This was O.K., nothing spectacular.  Made 1/2 the recipe and we had enough for another meal so I think the servings is w-a-y off.  I would say that this probably serves more like 10 to 12!

I created an accoun t JUST to review this recipe. I pretty much followed it perfectly (except halved the pasta) and it was SO. good. I couldn't believe the flavor, simplicity, and healthiness of it. I would also add some baby spinach like another reviewer suggested. THis is so fantastic, easy, and inexpensive, and I can't wait to make it again.

This was fresh and light tasting. I added one can of chopped tomatoes to one roma tomato, 1/2 cup of white wine and simmed until sauce thickened. I did not have fresh basil and although I am certain fresh would be much better, dried basil turned out just fine. Will make again.

This was so very good!  Hubby said it tasted like a restaurant dish.  I needed to make supper with what I already had in the pantry, and pasta is the easy go-to meal.  We get tired of basic spaghetti sauce, so I looked for something different, and I'm so glad I did!  Made minor changes: only had one tomato, so it wasn't a full 2 cups, and instead of crushed red pepper I used some home-roasted (slightly) spicy red peppers that I had on hand. I just finished up the leftovers for lunch.  I'll definitely make this again. Thanks!

Loved this!  Added chicken and used risotta instead of pasta (I have celiac disease).  Also, used chicken boulion in the olive oil instead of adding brother - had plenty of liquid without it.  My husband said it was great and that I would have to make it again - very flavorful!

So GOOD!  I used whole wheat angel hair.  I left out some noodles, as to have more sauce ratio.  I also pan cooked thin sliced chicken breast to top off pasta.(Butter salt and pepper)  YUM!!

4.5  With recommendations, I omitted the chicken broth and just added a bullion cube. However, I had cooked the pasta in advance and my angel hair ended up soaking up the juices. Maybe next time I will add a little bit of chicken broth. The dish was very light, very appropriate for a hot summer day. I also added shrimp and red pepper and substituted the basil with cilantro (what I had on hand).  I also left out the cheese. Very good and easy to make.

Good dish!  I added some shrimp to make it more of a complete meal.  This recipe reminds me of the Shrimp and Feta Pasta recipe on this site, which is one of my all-time favorite recipes.

For all the ingredients that went into this, I'd have liked to taste some of them a bit more. This was very, very light, and, if served with a side (like the orange-glazed asparagus found here!), the four servings are more like eight! Not that having leftovers is a bad thing... it was just a lot of food. :)

Great recipe! I had this at Zio's Italian Restaurant and decided to make it. Changed up a few things. Light and tasty!  1. Like most reviews, less pasta! 8 oz of angel hair is more than enough. (half of the original) 2. Dry basil works just as well. 3. 1 can of diced tomatoes (w/basil and oregano seasoning) 4. Used two packages of crushed peppers, you know, from the pizza places.

This was my last minute Valentines Day dinner. I used canned tomatoes and swapped out the chicken stock for white wine. It was very flavorful and the sauce was good for dipping the bread in.  I would totally make this again as it went from an idea to on the plate in about 25 minutes.

Simple and delicious. What could be better!? I did not have time to run to the grocery store for tomatoes, so I used a 28 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes, drained. This could probably be eaten cold, too. My husband loved it.

I liked the simplicity and healthfulness of this recipe, but found it slightly bland.  It is a good starting point.  This time I added chicken and black olives; next time I'll try adding artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, and pine nuts.

This is the first recipe I have ever reviewed, and I always wonder why people rate a recipe lower when they change the recipe.  Well....I have made this now 5 times with my fresh tomatoes from my garden, each way it is 5 stars...exactly as written, added chicken, added sausage, used half broth and marsala wine, once used white wine...I love this recipe!!!

This was a delicous dinner, no chicken or shrimp needed.  I used more olive oil then called for, a can of petite diced tomatoes, 3/4 can chicken broth, dried basil and 12 oz of angel hair pasta.  Everything else I left the same.  VERY good!

I've been using this recipe for a while now, and it's one of my favorites ever.  Thought it was about time I gave credit to the submitter.  

We add chicken to the recipe as suggested.  This is a perfect recipe - I don't change a thing.  Thank you!

I made this as a side dish for another meal, so I cut it in half.  It came out pretty good.  I used tomato that I had left over instead of the plum tomatoes.  Next time, I would increase the tomatoes, onions, and garlic for a little more flavor.

I added baby bella mushrooms and shrimp, plus some oregano and thyme. My bf and I thought it was very yummy. I also decreased the amount of oil to 1/8 cup. I think I'll go less next time. I also added too much red pepper for my taste so next time I'll leave it out :).

Delicious.  I made this recipe as written, adding salt and pepper to taste.  The other reviews are correct, there is just enough sauce to cover the noodles, so adjust the amount of pasta accordingly, if you wish.

It was delicious.  I made a few changes like I didn't have balsamic so I used red wine vinegar instead.  I also added some white cooking wine.  I make a dish similar to this and it's better if it cooks for several hours on low heat.  I simmered it for a couple of hours then tossed with the pasta.  Helps all the flavors combine plus your house smells awesome.  Delicious!!!!!

GREAT recipe for a quick, easy and delicious meal.  I had some tomatoes and baby spinach to use up, so I made this with dry ingredients that I had on hand...garlic powder, dried chopped onion, basil flakes...and it still came out great.  Can't wait to try it with fresh ingredients! I added the spinach when the pomodoro was at the end of it's cooking time.  Came out perfect.  I served this with Italian sausages....delish!!!  I will make this again and again.  Thanks Dinah!

It was just okay.  The sauce was too thin and it tasted bland to us.

Very good. I especially liked the addition of balsamic vinegar. I used one can of petite diced tomatoes w/juice, and chicken bullion w/water. I also used dried basil and half of the noodles, as was suggested by practically every other reviewer. I added turkey sweet italian sausage for my carnivore hubby. We loved it!

This is my go-to recipe for my vegetarian friends.  Wonderful flavor (I love the balsamic vinegar and the kick of the pepper flakes)!  Great with a green salad and garlic bread.

This was good, but agree with others, way too much pasta.  I used 1/2 the amount and it was still too much for the amount of sauce...I also added about twice as much garlic and a whole onion and a splash of red wine.  We liked it and will try again with less pasta....thanks!

I was very dissapointed in this. It looks so much better in the picture. Anyways, the pasta had no flavor or spice AT ALL. My family and I tried adding several things AFTER it was made, but it still had no good taste. My mother added a special soy souce, and that improved a little. It was her own taste though, so it may not work for everybody. To the point, I thought this recipe was going to turn out great. I guess I was wrong.

What a fabulous pasta recipe!  It is light and so fresh tasting.  I was excited to get to use the fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden and who can go wrong with angel hair pasta?  We loved this and will definately be adding this to our meal rotation.

A very easy and light summer dish.  The balsamic vinegar is needed to give it that light, summery taste - don't exclude that!  Added cooked shrimp for the last 2 minutes and the family loved it!  Also used a bit more chicken broth than called for.  I didn't experience too much pasta like many reviewers claimed, maybe since I used more broth.

My favorite kind of dish--simple yet delicious. I made this with multigrain rotini (12 oz, but I kept the other measurements the same), and I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I had some beet greens I needed to use, so I sauteed them with the onions and garlic; it was a nice addition. I doubled the basil and added it in at the last minute so it was just wilted. This had great flavor and was just saucy enough, and the spice level was perfect. A definite keeper.

So light and refreshing!!  I did not have balsamic vinegar so I omitted it.  I doubled the cheese.  I added some white wine also.  Will make again.UPDATE I have now made this with the balsamic vinegar but the kids wouldn't eat it.  I added about 1/2 cup heavy cream to it at the last minute with lots of parmesan cheese.  They ate it then.

Excellent pasta. I prepared the recipe exactly as written, except I only used 3/4 of a box of angel hair pasta (serving 3 people), but I went ahead and prepared the entire amount of sauce. I think it is key to understand that Pasta Pomodoro does not generally come with a lot of sauce. We found that when we mixed the pasta into the sauce (as the recipe states)it came out with the right "coating" of sauce. (Granted, I only used about 1 box of pasta instead of 2.) It did need a little more flavor, so I added roasted pinenuts and some ground sea salt & black pepper as a garnish and it turned out very very tasty. My husband, who was alittle skeptic at first b/c he was afraid the sauce was alittle bland upon first tasting it, ended up loving it and going back for seconds once we added the pinenuts, sea salt & additional pepper.

I found that the Balsamic vinegar gave it a harsh flavour and I didn't use the full 2 tablespoons.  I added mushrooms and lots of chicken, some oregano.  It was good, but I was expecting something smoother.  I will make it again, with my own modifications.  It's not unlike my own version, but I would leave the balsamic out next time.  Thanks though, it's always interesting to try someone elses ideas!

Quick, easy, and tasty!!  A great summer recipe, I will definately make again.  I did sub a can of diced tomatoes w/chilies as I did not have any fresh tomatoes on hand.  Also, I omitted the chx broth, (I think there would have been way too much liquid otherwise) but did add some chx granules.   Overall, a good recipe, thanks!!

I have a preference for heavier, more flavorful sauces and this recipe does not fall in that category. I'd make it again, though, and I'll probably add some capers, Greek olives, and anchovies.

I expected this recipe to be better. There are a lot of great flavors going into this dish, but the whole was less than the sum of its parts.  I agree that the recipe calls for too much pasta.  8 oz of any type pasta  would work.

I added olives and green peppers since they are favorites of mine, and when I discovered I had no pasta at home (too late!!), I served this over home made garlic bread - wonderful!! I too left out the chicken broth and just dropped in a chicken bullion cube.  Thanks for this recipe!

Fabulous!!  So tasty!  I added some diced cooked chicken breast into the sauce while it simmered. After reading some of the reviews that the balsamic vinegar was too strong, I only added about 1.5 Tbsp.  After tasting it, I didn't find it too sour at all--I went ahead and added a little more.  I used the 2 Tbsp. of fresh basil but also added about .50 tsp. of dried basil.  I also used a good bit of the crushed red pepper to give it some heat.  I LOVED this fresh tasting, filling dish.  It was our main course. I'll be adding this to my menu!

Made this last night with a few changes.  I used 1 T balsalmic and 1 T sugar.  Also used and extra cup or so of tomatoes since i seeded mine.  Cooked a few mins longer to have more of a "sauce". It was very good and fresh taasting, but not enough for a pound of pasta, but that might be since i seeded? Luckily I spilled almost half a pound into my sink while draining so I had just enough :-)

This is a very nice, light and fresh sauce.  My husband and I loved it!

I had fresh, ripe beefsteak tomatoes which I used instead of roma tomatoes.  I peeled them before dicing.

I also didn't add any broth, as suggested by previous posters.  Instead, I added one teaspoon of vegetable stock powder.

Finally, I only cooked enough pasta for my husband and I.  I didn't follow the recipe, although I can see how it would definitely be too much pasta for the amount of sauce it makes.  I served the sauce over the pasta instead of mixing it all together before serving. 

It turned out great.  We ate it with garlic bread and a glass of wine.  A perfect dinner!
I look forward to making this again!

Wow, this was so good! I did make a couple of changes. I used canned tomatoes, and used the tomato juice instead of chicken broth. I smashed the tomatoes while it was simmering. I made one mistake, I got carried away and added too much red pepper flakes. It was really spicy. I liked it and my father in-law liked it, but everyone else had a burning mouth. I think that next time I will add only a small pinch of red pepper flakes, just to give it a little zing. Overall it was a restaurant  quality recipe. I will definitely make it again.

EXCELLENT! Used 1/2 the pasta, added sauteed mushrooms, grilled chicken, and extra crushed red pepper. Will definitely make again! DELICIOUS!

This dish was great! The recipe needs a little tweeking. For  4 portions I used less then a whole box of pasta. This was plenty in comparison to the sauce/veggies. I added a can of diced tomatoes (get some that are in something i.e. olive oil). I also took the advise of another member and added a diced orange pepper. The red pepper flakes and garlic makes this dish! I used about 7 garlic cloves. My boyfriend said he felt like he was dining in a fancy Italian restaurant! Thanks!

This recipe was not what I expected. Like another reviewer, I found it to be very bland. I expected it to be more saucy. Also, I didn't get that zesty flavor that I expected. It was a very, very mild flavor. I don't know if I'll make this again, but if I do I'll have more fixins on hand to try to spice it up some. This recipe might serve as a skeleton for you to START a great Pasta Pomodoro, but it definitely seems like something is missing. Hmmm. Dunno....

This dish went together very easily but my timing needed to be a bit better. Most of the chicken broth had evaporated by the time I added the pasta and then the pasta absorbed the balance of the liquid. I added some additional olive oil to moisten it. I guess I can just keep some additional chicken broth on hand for any future batches, if need be! I added a bit more garlic and shrimp as suggested and the flavor was great! Will add a bit more basil to it to add more flavor and color as well. Hubby and I gave it two thumbs up.

This was great but I think would be even better with chicken. I used 12oz of angel hair instead of 16oz which the recipe calls for and it still made tons. Next time I won't put the pasta in the pan because it soaked up all of the sauce and my family loves sauce.

Very good! I used canned diced tomatoes and red wine vinegar instead of balsamic. I subbed spaghetti for angel hair due to hubby's preference. I also added a splash of white cooking wine. Everyone really liked this. This made a lot and it also tasted good later served cold.

This is terrific.  I love it better than my favorite Italian restaurant's version.  I even use a can of diced tomatoes, and it's still wonderful.  I like the amount of pasta and I follow the recipe exactly.  Great recipe!

This has become one of my fiance's favorites! He requests it all the time. It is so quick and easy to make. I use diced canned tomatoes to make it quicker and a can of tomato paste to make the sause a little thicker.

This is so great!  It is a nice light dish and to quicken up the recipe even more you can buy petite diced tomatos from Hunts in the can.  I also suggest using cayenne instead of black pepper.

I halved the recipe but still used the same amount of beans. It was very good but still made a lot. We ate it for about 3 days getting better each day. Great for a quick lunch or dinner.

I use whole wheat spaghetti , heirloom cherry tomatoes, a balsamic reduction "Glassa Gastronomica", and the pasta water rather than the broth, otherwise I feel it was pretty true to the recipe.  I loved the sweet, heat, savory interplay of this recipe.   I think that it got better over the next couple days.  I am glad that I froze some cherry tomatoes whole so that I can enjoy this in the winter months.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

You'd think with all the ingredients it would be a very flavorful dish. However, everything ended up blending together and it was rather bland. I guess it could have been a cooking error on my part, but either way it was a bit of a disappointment.

You can't really go wrong with tomatoes, basil, cheese, onions, garlic, and pasta! There's nothing innovative about this meal, but it's a pasta staple, with all the comforting standards. If you feel like it needs more seasoning, go a little heavier on your crushed red pepper flakes- they gave it the boost that it needed for me.

I made this using diced canned tomatoes. I don’t think they were Roma either. And I added a can of artichokes also. I loved it!! The only issue was the vinegar taste was a little overpowering. I think I will only use 1 tablespoon next time. Even though I am a firm believer that balsamic vinegar and tomatoes belong together forever. This recipe was super easy to make and a 3 year old approved. I look forward to making it again.

This was a light, satisfying pasta. I used half the pasta, since other reviewers claimed a full box was too much. I diced 3 tomatoes, 3 cloves of garlic and 4 basil leaves. I followed the recipe pretty faithfully, though I did omit the chicken broth and tossed in a cube of chicken bouillon. Before making the sauce, I cooked 4 thin chicken filets in olive oil, salt and pepper. I cut them into chunks and added to the pasta and sauce. It was a surprisingly quick preparation (always a plus). I served this with some swiss-onion breaf.

I didn't like this at all.  The balsamic was not a good taste with this, nor were the red pepper flakes.  I will not make this again.

I have made this recipe a number of times and it is delicious every time.  Be generous with the onion, tomatoes and the chicken broth. A half teaspoon of crushed red pepper gives it a nice zing.

Update: For those who found the recipe to be too bland, I highly recommend cutting the amount of pasta in half (or doubling your sauce recipe), cooking the pasta for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes LESS than the box instructions, and then adding it to the sauce. The pasta will finish cooking in the sauce and absorb a lot more of the flavor. This should solve the blandness issue.


I’ve made this several times by now (and am about to make it again). I know it’s really annoying when someone is like, “I loved this! I changed half the ingredients,” but I want to recommend this recipe because it *is* flexible. I was looking for a pomodoro recipe and, let’s face it, I’m not going to blanch my own tomatoes (can’t get a decent tomato in the winter anyway), and I wasn’t going to go out of my way for fresh basil. I used a good brand of canned diced tomatoes (Muir Glen San Marzano style), and I used roasted garlic instead of fresh because I had some in the freezer, and I used a spoonful of basil pesto instead of fresh basil. I also added a splash of cooking sherry with the tomatoes, chicken broth and balsamic vinegar.

Even after taking the lazy way out with some of my ingredients, this recipe was wonderful! The balsamic vinegar is the perfect note for this—it made the sauce smell divine and really made such an amazing flavor.

The best part was that this recipe was so easy and low-stress. I put the water for the pasta on to boil at the same time that I started sautéing the onions, and it all timed

Wow. I used Alfredo noodles (hate the thin noodles bleh), added mushrooms, used some veggie broth, chicken broth, and white wine in the sauce and tripled it due to adding more ingredients. I didn’t bother measuring the spices other than the garlic and balsamic vinegar. After cooking a bit I added more garlic etc to taste. After the sauce boiled down mixed it up for a meatless dinner. Tried it both immediately with the cheese and as leftovers cold. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up. Will make again.

Easy delicious recipe! I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic because it’s what I had available. I added red pepper flakes for a kick! Came out great will make again.

Made almost as written and felt the flavors of this was OK. My only sub was using Gluten Free Penne Pasta.  I think the balsamic brings out more of a sweet flavor, which isn't bad, just not my preference. The sauce took a while to reduce down after adding all of the broth. If you don't let it continue to simmer it's going to be an extremely thin sauce...almost like a thin broth based soup with too much oil. Next time I would use significantly less oil, omit the balsamic and broth, or use only 1/4 to 1/2 cup broth or pasta water. Overall, recipe is pretty good and I'd make it again with my own changes. Served sliced grilled chicken.

Fast and simple dish with great flavor. Go easy on the red pepper flakes; I accidentally used a bit too much and it overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients a bit.

The sauce has an excellent taste. We didn't toss it with the pound of angel hair, as the recipe suggested. Two of us topped a serving of angel hair with the sauce recipe for 4, then added the cheese. Although the recipe suggests parmesan and that's good, I think it would be even better with romano because it has a slightly nutty taste. The recipe's creator says you can add shrimp, which I think would be great. I'm a vegetarian, so I loved it, but my boyfriend, who's a meat eater enjoyed it, too. Delicious, inexpensive, and fast dish!

I used canned diced tomatoes, but other than that I followed the recipe until the end when I tossed in about a tablespoon of cold, diced butter to give the sauce body.  It was delicious!  The fresh basil and fresh, shaved parmesan really make it elegant for such a simple dish.

Horribly bland. The flavor is good, just very, very mild. If you want to make it, I'd suggest either halving the amount of pasta used or doubling the rest of the ingredients. My girlfriend and I both tried it and immediately added a ton of extra balsamic to make up for the lack of flavor. I followed to recipe exactly.

This looked yummy but, when we made it, it just didn't go over very well with my crew. we grilled a couple of chicken breasts to go in it to make a main dish out of it and followed the recipe exactly. My daughter said it kind of reminded her of an Italian version of ramen noodles. This wasn't a bad recipe, everyone has different tastes, this just wasn't for us. Thank you for sharing this, I did enjoy trying it!

I'm an untalented cook. So I always look for recipes that are simple enough that I "think" I can pull off moderately successfully. This was one of them! I never appreciate my own cooking, but this one I genuinely liked. Have to admit reading the reviews was helpful as I had to improvise a bit as I didn't have the exact ingredients on hand. Mix of canned and fresh tomatoes mix of onions and shallots and definitely had to supplement my chicken broth with white wine, but we all really liked it! Learned a few things too! Thanks to all!

When  I made it tonight, it sure looked different than what was posted in the photo.   Though I didn't have any fresh basil, my came out a big too vinegary even with the  garlic and onions, when I added a 1/3rd of the chicken broth  for the sauce.  Next time, I would add more brand make give this a 4.

So good, nice, easy, light side dish or summer pasta main dish. Followed the recipe almost exactly, except for a little extra balsamic vinegar. Everyone loved this dish!

I didn't particularly like it.  I may have used too much balsamic Vinegar as I only used 8 ounces of pasta.  It was simple and quick

This was GREAT.  Just excellent.  

I used veggie spaghetti instead of angel hair, and used much less.  Even tripling the recipe (we like lots of leftovers!), I only used about 20 oz of spaghetti total, instead of the 48 it would have called for.

Also added cut up chicken thighs.  Used half the garlic called for (I like garlic, but not overpowering).  Otherwise no changes.  So basically, veggie noodles, less noodles, and less garlic.  Those were the only changes.  It was delicious, and different, somehow, than the other pasta things I make.  Can't really explain that.  I would say that the switch to veggie noodles is definitely a good change tho, for both flavor and nutrition.  In my experience, the ones that contain one serving of veggies and those that contain three servings are both fantastic.  The 3-serving version is more expensive, tho.  I used the other.

Made this dish as a meatless Monday supper. Followed the recipe as written. The ratio of pasta to tomatoes was unbalanced. Too much pasta for my 2 generous cups of tomato. I ended up adding a can of diced tomatoes to the mix which was an improvement. Nice flavor. Will probably make it again but I will use a smaller amount of pasta next time. Small amount of red pepper flakes gave it a little kick without adding too much heat.

What a yummy recipe for a damp, dark winter's day - even  if the only fresh veggie I had was onion and garlic My husband and daughter loved it, too. It reminds me of a similar dish my mother fixed back in the 40's and 50's when I was growing up, only she used noodles. The next time I will plan ahead and have the fresh ingredients for it. That can only make it better - worthy of more than 5 stars.

I made it after reading a number of other pomodoro recipes.  Some of the reviews here mention the recipe was bland.  Two things: first there's a need to use fresh ingredients and not to let them cook long.  They lose their moister, get soft, and do not taste as strongly.  Second, the recipe is mild with a slightly spicy flavor because of the red pepper.  From other recipes, the serving suggestion was chopped olives and feta cheese.  The bitterness of the olives and feta made a huge difference in balancing and highlighting flavors.

I made this recipe as is and it was very good. Will definitely make it again and again. I thought the addition of the chicken broth would make it soupy but it did not. The pasta absorbed all that good yummy sauce. Served this with chicken Cordon Bleu from this site and they went really well together.

This was good! 2nd time I've made it. I did add some Italian seasoning to the sauce when it was simmering and used 12 Oz of gluten free pasta.  I added some chicken breast the 2nd time. Next time maybe shrimp! My husband had 2 plates.

Excellent!  I made it as written with all fresh ingredients including fresh from the garden tomatoes.  I did add some diced cooked chicken.  I think one of the secrets is to be sure  the angel hair pasta is al dente -- or even undercooked.  Since the sauce is thin because of the broth,  if you let the al dente pasta simmer in the sauce a few minutes as noted, the pasta absorbs most of the sauce which made for  an absolutely delicious pasta .

Cooked the pasta up ahead of time, then followed directions and added the pasta as the sauce simmered. Also cooked chicken breast cutlets ahead, sliced and added just long enough to warm.  Served to a group of women scrapbookers, we all agreed it was delicious but did need a pinch of salt.

One of the  best pastas I've ever had and I changed nothing. Used tomatoes from my garden. We used edamame pasta, which was fabulous!

Absolutely delicious!  I added a lb. of raw shrimp and cooked it until one side was pink at the end of the onions and garlic cooking.  I then turned them over and added all other  ingredients so the shrimp cooked perfectly while the chicken broth simmered.    I also decreased the Roma tomatoes by 1/2 cup and added 6 oz. of thinly sliced sun dried tomatoes.  I also added sliced black olives and a bit more garlic.  Everyone lived it!!

Great recipe, however I would use about half as much pasta that it calls for. 16oz was too much for the amount of sauce made.

Very yummy. I substituted shallots for onions and stuck with fresh tomatoes. Added a touch more balsamic and topped with both grated and shaved Parmesan. Would absolutely make this for company.

I made this by the recipe EXCEPT, I love mushrooms, so added a small container of whole button mushrooms at the same time as  the tomato/vinegar/broth.  Also, I try to avoid pasta so used zucchini that I made into "pasta" with my Veggetti. Last thing, no fresh basil, so I used dried. So really just one substitution (pasta) & one addition. ( I don't count the basil.) Sometimes, when you read these "reviews" the entire recipe was changed. Ha.  Anyway,  this was delicious & I will definitely make it again! Thank you!

I will definitely make this again.  The only thing I changed were 2 drained cans of diced tomatoes with garlic & basil  instead of the plum tomatoes and dried basil instead of fresh.  I also added chicken to this and it was delicious!  The next time I will try it with crab meat instead of chicken.

I thought it was super yummy but I put in a whole package of fresh basil, half the onion, and I didn't put the tomatoes in till the end so they would be a bit more fresh.

The recipe turned out fantastic. I added chicken and only used 1/4 of the amount of chicken stock. I used the remainder of the stock when boiling the noodles so it wasn't wasted. Thank you for the recipe.

I loved this recipe so much. My Dad isn't much of a pasta eater, and he had seconds!

I felt that this recipe really didn't need the cheese, but some people may enjoy it better with the cheese.

I was skeptical from the ingredient list, but this has a great flavor.  I used just a dash of the red pepper as my kids won't eat spicy and I added a bag of frozen precooked shrimp.  So easy and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Will definitely be making this again, a new school night meal for my family.

Absolutely love this dish! I made it a few times already, each time with great success. 

Fresh ingredients are a MUST! 
I like to play around with my liquids, so instead of adding chicken broth,  I add vegetable stock, white or rose wine and add the required amount of balsamic vinegar. 

You can't go wrong with this dish - it's practically foolproof  :)

The first time I made this I got carried away with the red pepper flakes and it ended up WAY too spicy. Oops. Since then I've been more cautious with how much of that seasoning I add and since then it has been an absolutely delicious staple in our meal plan.  We have yet to add any meat to it, but I'm sure that adding shrimp or chicken could only enhance this meal.

We loved this pasta! The only changes I made was to cook some chopped chicken breast with my onion and garlic. Then instead  of the red pepper flakes I added some spicy seasoning my grandson brought back from Italy. Also the fresh tomatoes are a must!!

I've made it as is and it's great.  But I've also gotten creative with this recipe.  Tonight I needed to use up some things from the fridge and added kielbasa (I sautéed it first before adding the onion and garlic) red bell pepper and zucchini.  Yum!  My husband complimented it several times.  This recipe will definitely remain in my favorites box!

This dish is delish! Pomodoro is one of my favorite pasta dishes at Italian restaurants and I have tried a number of recipes in the past trying to recreate the experience. This recipe captures  the delicate flavors very well... possibly even better than what I have had in restaurants. 

I have seen a number of reviews substituting canned instead of fresh ingredients and I can't imagine the outcome being nearly as flavorful.

I was looking for a quick recipe i could make for lunch using ingredients i had on hand, and this was perfect! No fresh tomatoes, so i used a can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes and i used white wine in place of the balsamic vinegar. It was so delicious and easy! tasted like it came from a restaurant! Can't wait to cook it again!

This is great as a side dish, and has a fresh, light taste.  Definitely use fresh basil and fresh tomatoes; dried basil and canned tomatoes would not be as good.  Instead of using all chicken broth, I used 1 cup of chicken broth and  1/2 cup of the pasta water.  I added some spinach that I needed to use up, but I don't think I would add it  again.  I used spaghetti instead of angel hair, but I think it would have been better with angel hair.

This recipe was pretty good.  I did make a few changes, as suggested by others.  I used shallots in place of onions, used 1 can diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings, instead of fresh tomatoes.  Used an extra tbsp. of balsamic vinegar and 1/2 chicken broth 1/2 white wine.  I added a couple cups of chopped baby spinach (with stems removed) towards the end, also added some large shrimp (which I cooked separated and sautéed in olive oil, before adding to everything else, towards the end).  In my opinion, this recipe would taste much better with linguine instead of angel hair pasta, so I'm going to try that next time.  Overall, it was pretty good though.

It's really a very basic tasting sauce. Nothing fancy. I did enjoy it, but it's really not a 5-star sauce. It's really ordinary tasting.

Outstanding and easy and quick. Best with fresh tomatoes but you can used diced/canned in a pinch. I often add sauteed mushrooms and grilled chicken to this.

I made this and it was so goooood, so good I could eat a bowl of the sauce alone! I didn't follow the recipe exactly as written. I used fresh tomatoes, blanched, peeled then just roughly chopped. I didn't have chicken stock and I ran out of chicken cubes so I used pork cubes lol! I added just half a cup of water to replace the chicken stock because I felt like it would be too watery if I added more. It was a bit bland so I added about 2-3 tbsp of fish sauce (I promise, you won't regret if you try this insted of using just salt. Not overpowering. It adds umami) Didn't have fresh basil so I used dried basil. I simmered the sauce for 15 mins. I tasted it, it was already awesome. Didn't even need cheese or meat.

Followed the recipe except that I had a 14.5 oz can of low sodium broth and used all of it. 10 roma tomatoes and 3/4 of a pkg of thin spaghetti, no pepper flakes.Served with crusty garlic bread and it was a meal.This is fabulous and everyone had seconds.Definitely a new favorite.Thank you! Oh,I didn't add any meat.We like meatless nights now and then and this was perfect! :)

We loved this. I made it exactly as the recipes states except doubled all for the sauce and a little less pasta. I added turkey miniature meatballs (italian turkey meatball recipe by Melt Organic from this site) because we like meat with our pasta. 
Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome. I made it using a can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh roma tomatoes. It was a great side dish with grilled chicken. 
It is a good basic pasta dish for so many main dishes.

This is a recipe I will make again and again.  Great flavor and easy to make.  The balsamic vinegar added a nice flavor.  I did use canned diced tomatoes, they worked fine and saved some  prep time.  I also did not have red pepper flakes but will try them next time.  Thank you

This was so good I made it two nights in a row.  I did follow other reviewers advice and  cut the pasta in half and added about 1/2 cup extra tomatoes.  Perfect amount of sauce.  Threw in some chicken and had a complete meal :)  Perfect.

This is a healthy, meat free family favourite and a regular part of our line up. We cut back the garlic a little and let the broth/sauce simmer gently, sometimes as long as 30 mins and seems to get even more flavourful.  We prefer it with a thin noodle, angel hair or spaghettini;  "fresh" packaged noodles found in deli fridges work well.  Cook the pasta after the sauce is ready. Great with a wheat baguette and crisp green salad.

I loved this recipe!  I have to use gluten free pasta so the taste of the sauce is very important to me.  I wouldn't dare try this with canned tomatoes as the fresh tomatoes gave this sauce a light twist.

This is so tasteful.  My only addition was 2 tbls of capers.  It was wonderful and my family loved every bite.  Could not be easier.  Give it a try.

I continue to make this dish quite often and love it more each time.  It's a great fast meal, a good wintertime meal and a nice summer meal with a good salad.  One of the best I've had.

Have made this twice now, both times fantastic results.  The first tiem folowing the recipe as posted (even though I don’t like Angel Hair pasta).  Everyone loved it.
The second time I used regular spaghetti (since I still don’t like Angel Haai Pasta) and added a 1/2 pound of mild Italian sausage and some mushrooms.  Being a mild sausage, it added more ‘umph' than flavor so it didn’t change the taste very much - and everyone still loved it.
Definitely a keeper recipe!

I thought this was very easy and very tasty.  I used 1/2 package of linguine (because that is what was in the house), 2 cans diced tomatoes (with basil/garlic/orgegano), onion, garlic, balsamic vinegar, a splash of wine, about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, dried basil, dried oregano and a bay leaf.  I cooked it longer than the 8 minutes, in order to make the sauce a little thicker.  I thought about putting some tomato paste in to thicken it, but didn't.  Next time, I will use penne pasta and crushed tomatoes.  It was difficult to get a bite of tomato and pasta on the same fork; using penne would make that easier.  I will omit the chicken broth and just use a chicken bouillon cube (plenty of liquid in tomatoes), and two splashes of wine (white or red, depending on what's on hand).  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this with fresh tomatoes, used dried basil also added a diced chicken breast when cooking onion and garlic. The sauce turned out great but way to much pasta which made the dish dry. Next time I will make it with a 8 ounce box of angle hair spaghetti.

Even my 2 yr old loved this dish!! I added carrots and broccoli and used less red pepper as I didn't want it to be to spicy for the kiddos!! So good and will make it again!!

I have done something similar when my cherry tomatoes are in season, but without the balsamic.  I look forward to trying this version this summer.  My method is to add halved cherry tomatoes and torn basil after it is all assembled and just heat through.  I also use any pasta I have on hand, less liquid and more basil (because I love it).  The fresh taste of hot, fresh tomatoes is amazing. I will also be adding the fresh spinach as suggested by another reviewer.

I followed the recipe exactly however, I used low sodium and fat free chicken broth.  I won't do that again.  I agree with some of the other reviewers, next time I will reduce the amount of pasta and increase the amount of garlic.  Also, I will use thin spaghetti instead of angel hair.  I cooked the angel hair "al dente" but because it gets added into and simmered with the sauce, it got mushy.  The flavor was great and the house smelled like an Italian restaurant.  I will definitely make this again.

My angel hair pasta only needed to cook 4-5 min (according to the box) so I started it the same time as I began simmering the tomatoes and it all came together nicely.  Could have used a bit more salt, and you could probably use dried basil if you don't have fresh. Lots of grated Parmesan on top made it DIVINE, pasta had a creamy quality to it. A hit with my Italian hubby too!

This was so simple, and using just picked Roma tomatoes and basil from our garden means the flavors were amazing.  I substituted whole wheat thin spaghetti. This recipe is going in my regular rotation file!

Delicious!!!  I adjusted the spices according to my family taste and added  8oz. of  Bella baby mushrooms. The balsamic vinegar, really adds a pleasant flavor to the dish. I also find that any type of tomatoes will do. But stick with fresh if you can. Served this with Meatballs Nirvana, also from the site. 
Thank You for Sharing

Added 2 chicken breasts cut into pieces.  Cooked with onion and garlic.  12 oz of pasta.  1/2 cup white wine.  Just a bullion cube - no extra water.  1 can diced tomatoes and 1 small tomato.

This was a big, big hit.  My husband and daughter loved it.  I added two chicken breast chopped, because I husband likes meat, but he said he could have eaten it without the chicken.  My only suggestion is to add more salt to taste to water and while cooking the sauce.

This was delicious!  And I was a little surprised, since it does have so few ingredients, but I made it for lunch today, added some cooked chicken and it was wonderful.  I followed the recipe, used red balsamic vinegar, about 1/2 teaspoon boulllion granules and half cup water.  I am sure the wine would have been great, but didn't have any.   I think it only made 3 servings of the sauce and I used half the pasta.  I thought I would have leftovers to freeze, but not happening.

Great recipe. I had everything on hand except the pasta, picked up some whole-grain pasta on the way home from work. Fast and easy to make. I used about a teaspoon of fresh ground pepper and 2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper. Gave it a light simmer in the mouth. Leftovers heated easily in the microwave. This one is a keeper!

Probably just fine with no vinegar at all....

We loved it!!  Increased the garlic, halved the cooked pasta, 1/2 white wine and 1/2 chicken broth for the liquid. Tossed in 12 spears of diced asparagus with the diced tomatoes!  Very saucy with the reduction of pasta.  Just the way we like it.  Topped with black pepper, red pepper and fresh grated parmesan.

This is okay, didn't knock my socks off.  I added chicken to it, maybe I needed to increase all the seasoning more.  Will try again with shrimp and increase seasoning a bit.

Delicious and simple.  A can of Hunt's fire-roasted diced tomatoes (undrained) works fine in winter.  In place of fresh basil, I've substituted pesto from a jar with good results.

So quick, cheap and easy!  I work long days but want to make something tasty that works with our budget and this is one of those recipes that will be worked into our menu on a regular basis.  To save on time I used canned Italian seasoned tomatoes, canned button mushrooms and 'Amazing Chicken' from this site.  Really complimented each other very well, thank you!

Super quick, easy and delicious!  My kids gobbled it up.  Thank you for the recipe.  Only modification I made was subbing half the chicken stock with white wine.

This was very good!  I didn't have chicken broth so I used turkey broth.  I added white wine & used Romano cheese to thicken the sauce at the end.  I would use fresh ingredients if you can but dried basil worked just fine.  The balsamic made it sweet & tangy. It was great!  My only criticism is that this sauce is very thin.   I changed this recipe up out of necessity rather than curiosity.  Next time I make this, I am going to follow the recipe more closely.

Simple but good. Used red onions, a bouillon cube, and diced tomatoes. It'd be a nice accompaniment to fish. This recipe introduced me to my first purchase of balsamic vinegar--not bad.

Very light and fresh. I used canned plum tomatoes instead of fresh and this still came out fantastic. I also added some shrimp which was a nice addition to make it a full meal and not just a side dish.

This was amazing. I changed only by using 1/2 of the chicken broth and using white wine. Very light dish and very easy. My family loved it and will become a standard recipe in my home!

What an easy and restaurant quality pasta meal!  It takes very little time to make this and my family has voted it one of the best new pastas that I have made.  It is definitely a winner for our family.  The only thing I did different was add a little too much crushed red pepper.  It gave it a nice bite but I would cut back  and keep the crushed red pepper to a minimum.  I also added chicken and it really enhanced the meal to make a full dinner.  It is a winner!!

My family really loved this, even my picky 3-yr old! I added chicken to the onion/garlic saute but omitted the red pepper because I was worried it would be too spicy for the kids (we added it separately).  I didn't have quite enough parmesan so I used what I had and also added crumbled feta which gave it a nice tang.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My whole family loved this simple recipe.  I did add shrimp in with it and it was delicious. The only thing i would change is add more of the Balsamic Vinegar.  I like the kick that it gives.  but It was a wonder lite meal!

LOVE this recipe!  I followed the recipe almost exactly--I used about a tablespoon of olive oil, not 1/4 cup, and used about 8 oz of capellini.  I also added more basil--I love fresh basil.  It was perfect!

Ended up being better than I thought it would. Very tasty. I did change a few things. I used wholegrain pasta instead. I also added red and green peppers with the onion and garlic. Didn't have any white wine so I used white wine vinegar and reduced the balsimic vinegar. Also didn't have any romano tomatoes so I used canned red diced tomatoes. I'm sure it would have been even tastier with fresh tomatoes. I topped with cut up chicken breasts. I also added shredded asiago cheese with the parmesan cheese for topping. Excellent dinner.

Excellent and light.  I added more garlic and a bit more chopped tomatoes.  I did screw-up when I had cooked the pasta a bit too long.  If you want it al-dente, cook the pasta until it is barely soft.  The pasta will cook further in the last 5 minutes in the sauce.  I will make this again and again.  Smaller portions would be great as a starter (first course) to an Italian meal.  Thanks for posting.

Substituted balsamic vinegar with red wine vinegar because I didn't have any balsamic. I also added some chicken, which gave some flavor to the sauce. The dish was delicious.

I made this tonight (with chicken added) and it was DELICIOUS!  I didn't have fresh basil, so I substituted 2 t dried for the 2 T fresh.  I would note that it serves MORE than 4 people.  I followed the recipe this time, and after 2 people ate I still had a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish FULL of pasta as left overs.    Next time I'll cut back the amount of pasta.

Really good but I added saute steak, chicken and white wine.Which took this dish to a whole other level. My Husband and Mother in law loved it. Will be making it again.

After simmering the sauce, I added a pound of large shrimp and cooked them until they turned pink; then, served the sauce over angel hair pasta!  Fantastic!  I am looking forward to making it again!

This was great. I modified it a bit to accommodate my son-in-law, who doesn't like spaghetti type noodles. I made it with whole wheat penne and added some pepper strips and cut up chicken chunks with the onion and garlic. Was a little spicy, perfect for me, not so much for the others, so if you don't like spicy, eliminate or reduce the red pepper flakes.

This was excellent. For my personal taste, I would use half the pasta next time & double the tomatoes. I made it with shrimp ... so good.

yum! I liked how healthy this dish was, and I served it with sauteed chicken. I used no garlic and minced onion, and I think it turned out very well.

This recipe saved dinner when I had pasta boiling and realized we had no sauce! So simple and convenient since I had the ingredients already (I diced up fresh tomato and used dried spices) and I threw in some mushrooms too. Will definitely make again, great alternative to standard spaghetti marinara.

This was such a good recipe! It's always a winner when my husband abd picky 2 year old eat everything on thier plate! I did take the advice of others and only used half of the pasta and still had plenty for leftovers! The only thing I may try next time is a little more Balsamic vinegar and maybe an extra clove of garlic.

I used penne pasta instead of the angel hair. I also added about a 1/4c of pasta water to help thicken the sauce. I simmered the sauce for 30 min to help thicken it as well.

This was a good light pasta dish, added leftover grilled chicken. Did increase seasoning, oil and broth by 50% or so. Kept tomato amount about the same.

Excellent! I didn't add any of the chicken broth of fear it would be too watery. I added 1/4 cup of pasta water though. I used roma tomatoes and a bit more garlic . added sliced chicken and it w fantastic! Husband who doesn't like tomatoes even raved! Gooed enough to serve to comany. Next time I will try it with a spicy chorizo. Mmmm!

I followed the recipe exactly, it turned out very tasty and fresh. I would suggest using a good amount of red pepper to give it some bite and adding more chopped basil to increase the taste.

This would be okay as a side dish, but I added shrimp and used it as a main dish.  It simply wasn't main dish material.  I used one can of tomatoes and dehydrated onions and added one pound of shrimp.  If I make it again, I will use two pounds of shrimp.

My boyfriend and I both love this dish. It's a staple in our diet and we eat it probably three times a month. Sometimes if I'm out of fresh basil we will put in one tablespoon of dried basil. However, I would suggest using fresh ingredients if possible. We love the crushed red pepper. The very first time I made the recipe I forgot to put the Parmesan Cheese so now I always make it without because it's so yummy.

this was a fabulous dish, I added checken when I was cooking the onions and the garlic, and I only used 1/2 cup broth and 1/2 cup marsala and that made it sweeter , I did add lots of the pepper flakes because we like hot food. It was delicious and we will for sure make it again, Shirl

If I could give this more stars, I would!  This is soooo good!!!  I have a vegetable garden growing outside my back door and I cut roma tomatoes and basil...I used 8 ounces of dry spaghetti because that was all I had.  I used minced garlic from the jar and I only had boullion cubes on hand..so I used that instead of a can of chicken broth.  At the end I added about 20 raw shrimp and let that cook in the sauce until pink.  Then I added about 2 T. of heavy cream to the sauce...it was absolutely the best!!  It is so good you could serve it to guests!  You must give this recipe a try!

I cut the recipe for 1 and enjoyed it.  Wish I would have used a little more garlic to flavor it more.  I used cherry tomatoes as that was what we had from the garden and they worked well.

Fantastic recipe! I normally don't post comments, but  I loved this dish so much, I had to. Followed some suggestions posted - added chicken breast and zucchini, and used a chicken bouillon cub instead of chicken broth. Also used half the pasta. Turned out amazing!

I made homemade angel hair pasta and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  The whole family loved it.  Chopping the tomatoes in a food processor was a lot quicker than by hand.  By the time they are cooked, it doesn't matter if they were perfectly diced by hand or not.

Very nice...light pasta..we used it as a side dish..could be "doctored" to be a main dish. I used grape tomatoes, they seemed a bit sweeter, but it was either way.

OMG... This recipe is delicious.  I added fresh steamed snap beans and chicken, and wow, this is fabulous.  As other reviewers said..an absolute must with FRESH basil.  I love any noodle meals or noodle salads that are made with olive oil, and this is the best I have had

Great recipe.  I added an additional tomato and next time I will probably cut the vinegar in half.  But overall, really nice recipe.

Made this tonight, followed the recipe fairly close, used half broth and half white wine.  Also breaded chicken cutlets with italian bread crumbs and cooked before the sauce used the olive oil after.  Also added zuchinni. This was so yummy!!! Restaurant quality for sure if not better.  Thanks for a great recipe, I will use it often!

Good timing, allrecipes!  I had just the right amount of roma tomatoes to make this "daily dish" recipe and I thought it was absolutely delish.  Let the sauce simmer longer than the recipe states, until it's really thick and flavorful.  The balsamic vinegar compliments the fresh tomato taste, it doesn't cover it up.  The only changes I made to the recipe was using feta cheese instead of parmesan and using rotini instead of angel hair so that the shape of the pasta would hold more of the sauce.

for me this was just a little too light and not enough flavor. If I make it again I will use less pasta and sups the sauce a bit. Great start though!

Made this tonight for dinner. It was very good! Will definitely make again. Easy, quick meal that looks and tastes like it came from a fancy restaurant. I added shrimp tonight, in the future I may try some fresh clams, or even calamari for an even more impressive dish.

Quick and easy, but not as flavorful or hearty as I would have liked. The sauce was rather watery for my taste. Perhaps the trick is to reduce at the end?

Oh my, so delicious! Only change I made was reduced pasta by about 1/4-1/2 and added a little more garlic and balsamic vineager cuz we love em. Right now I am wishing I had some leftovers. The hubs and I fought over the last scoops as it was. Served with "Fried Mozzarella Cheese Sticks" from this site, and garlic bread. So yum!

Good dish. I've made it with white wine and without, and with fresh and canned tomatoes. If we use canned tomatoes, we incorporate the wine; if we have good fresh tomatoes, we don't miss the wine. Good with penne and rotini, too. Quick, easy, and yummy!

This was SO good. The only changes I made were using dried basil instead of fresh, and I had to make my own broth since I didn't have any. But it turned out fabulous. The amount of spice was perfect for me. I'll be making this again and again, thank you DEBNJAMES~!

I love to get this out so I wanted to see if I could duplicate this at home.  This recipe is very good.  Simple and full of flavor and great as a side dish.  The only thing is use 1/2 the pasta suggested.  I may even opt to reduce the pasta more so I get more of the wonderful sauce on the pasta.

This was very good…..I also did ½ white wine and ½ broth….I did only about 7 oz of angel hair pasta and any more would make this dish dry.  I ran out of olive oil so I did half EVOO and butter.  I too added some spinach to it as well.  Next time I will add some red peppers and mushrooms.

Love this!!  My husband is Italian and is very critical of homemade Italian dishes. He raved about this.  It has a wonderful flavor that can be modified to taste, adding more or less garlic and red pepper.  Very easy to make, too.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

ok, so I made this recipe verbatim and I'd to tell everyone to be careful with the crushed red pepper. It definitely can takes away from the taste and to tell you the truth, I think the flavor was a bit lacking.  I can't say what was missing but, I certainly have given up trying to figure out what to add or take away.  Maybe it was the amount of  Balsamic.  Maybe that shouldn't have been in there.  In summary it was ok, I probably will not make again.

This is a favorite at my house.  I make a few changes...If I use the amount of pasta recommended I will double if not triple the sauce.  I also use less vinegar; I found using the fill amount comes out a little too strong for our liking.  To top off the recipe I throw in some fresh mozzarella cheese and grilled chicken.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I love pasta dishes and this was a nice change from other pasta dishes. I especially love the use of fresh ingredients. I did follow the recipe as stated, except I only used one 8 ounce package of pasta and it was perfect for the amount of sauce. This recipe is a keeper, thanks!

Double the sauce! I had to remove about half of the pasta to get the right ratio, but it was very tasty.

This is usually one of my favorite dishes at certain Italian restaurants! And this recipe was just as good, if not better!

This is my new favourite. I used one large can of Aylmer diced tomatoes (drained), and 1 tsp. of dried basil. One 375g box of pasta was just the right amount.

Good recipe overall. I used veggie broth and it turned out flavorful. I think if you can use homegrown or perfectly ripe tomato it would be even better.

Delicious!  Used dried basil (didn't have fresh), added spinach and chicken sauteed with the onions and garlic.  It was very flavorful.  We all agreed this is a keeper recipe and even my 3 year old loved it.

I tried the recipe as written, and it was absolutely perfect.  During dinner, even my daughter referred to it as 'crazy good'.  To get the best flavors, we used home-grown garden tomatoes, a good quality balsamic vinegar, and fresh herbs.

I made this with ground beef and it was still amazing- I added corn to it last minute and the entire family loved it.  I made it with wide egg noodles and it went over very well.  We will make this again.  I left out the red pepper flakes and added it to individual servings. Yummy!

4.5 Easy dinner that was enjoyed by everyone! Next time, I will either use less pasta or make more sauce.  I will also serve the sauce over the pasta instead of stirring it all together as we ended up having to dig to the bottom of the pan to get the good stuff!

I added a sliced zucchini when i added the tomatoes, and only used 8 oz of pasta. I also let it simmer for about 15 minutes.  A perfect amount for 2, with a bit of leftovers for tomorrows lunch.

Great receipe!! almost like the Chicken Bruchetta Pasta from Fridays, but better.  I used 1/2 cooking Sherry and 1/2 Chicken broth, will increase both next time.  Very, very good even for left overs.

This was very good...I did make some changes that were suggested by the other reviewers... I used 8oz ckn broth and 4 oz white wine, I also doubled the amount of tomatoes and only used 1 lb of pasta.  I also added canneloni beans to boost up the protein...very yummy :)

For a light dish, this was really good.  I did not have any balsamic vinegar so I used white wine instead.  It had a really light taste to the sauce.  Next time I will probably add more garlic just out of personal preference.

This has become an almost weekly dinner for us.  The only change I make is using spaghetti instead of angel hair so it is more filling as a main course.  It is also great cold the day after as leftovers, or for a picnic in the summer.  Yummy!

Excellent - we really liked it.  I omitted the crushed red pepper because we didnt have it on hand, and used dried basil instead of fresh. Delicious and easy - a nice change of pace from traditional pasta dishes. Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make again.

Very good! I added more spices to give it more of an italian taste and some shredded parmesan to top it off.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was too bland for my taste.  I love all of the fresh flavors of basil, tomato, and parmesan, but there was just too much pasta to taste any of them.  I will probably try it again using only one 8 oz package of angel hair pasta.

This was pretty good. It was a little bland for my taste, but a nice change to the heavy tomato sauces I usually make. Thank you.

This was good. I made the Balsamic Marinated Chicken Breast from this site and cut into into chunks and added to the sauce which I doubled. I also used penne pasta since I think it absorbes the sauce better.  I also used canned tomatoes and it turned out great. My husband really enjoyed it. I will certainly make this again.

This recipe is so-so. The bites with the tomatoes and basil were yummy, but with out it, it was bland. I followed every step exactly except I added less noodles.  I don't think I will make it again, but if I did I would add more tomatoes, garlic, and basil and less noodles.

This was very good, thanks! Not phenomenal, but it was a really nice side dish, especially since my husband won't really eat creamy pastas. I halved the pasta (actually, even less - probably about 5 oz, with a ton left over after 2 meals), used a whole onion, about 5 cloves garlic, almost an entire can of diced tomatoes w/oregano (including juice), and 1/2 T of balsamic vinegar. It wasn't that saucy, and I'll probably use a little more broth next time. I did load it up with crushed red pepper. Served it with the Spicy Cajun Shrimp from this site.

So simple and delicious, we make this all the time now. Sometimes we add leftover rotisserie chicken if we have it on hand but it doesn't need anything other than what is listed to be a great dinner.

I was looking for something light, easy and different to serve the day after Thanksgiving and this was perfect.  The only changes I made was to halve the pasta, but I kept the amount of sauce the same.  Also used half chicken broth and white wine as one reviewer suggested and served with Garlic Cheese Flatbread from this site.  Absolutely loved it and will definitely make again and again.

This recipe is great! I also add some cubed mozzarella cheese, the kind that is packaged in water, I buy the large 8 ounce ball. I add it when I add the basil so it can melt a bit and I also add more basil then called for, and 1/2 c white wine, 1/2 c chicken broth. Delish!!!!!!

This was fabulous, just what I've been looking for. I made the recipe as written.
 Then I thought why not add some cooked chicken. I then remembered that I had some small mozzarella balls, I cut them into fourths. I added both when I put the pasta in. Everyone loved it, Thanks!

Excellent!  Used only one box pasta.  Used fresh garden tomatoes and added kosher salt.  Better than Olive Garden!
UPDATE 2/5/15:  Used 2 cans diced tomatoes, pureed half.  I thought the vinegar taste was too strong and using 1 box of pasta was not quite enough.  Also used 1/2 cup chardonnay and 1/2 cup water with bouillon.  Both husband and daughter loved it.

this was so easy and good. i pretty much stuck to the recipe but i did add some white wine.  didnt double the sauce because i used the meat from 1  spaghetti squash,which yielded about the same amount of half a box of pasta. topped with spicy meatballs.

My husband does all the cooking, and he loved this. I am learning how to cook, cooking a simple dish each week. I double the main part of the recipe to make up for the amount of noodles, and used a lot more garlic. I used fresh tomatoes, since we grow our own food, but was sure to seed them first. I think I will cut the broth in half next time though, it was too juicy. Thanks for the recipe!

Just finished eating this and it was delicious. Even my boyfriend loved it and he isn't a fan of tomatoes.  I made mine with 2 cans of diced tomatoes (14 oz each) and 4 fresh roma tomatoes.  I also added about 1/4 cup of white wine after the onion and garlic sauteed, an extra tablespoon of balsamic and a pinch of sugar.  Let it simmer for about 90 minutes only because the boyfriend wasn't hungry yet.  Used lots more basil because I love it.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  A keeper!

I loved this. It is simple and goes well with anything. I added a little more garlic to mine. I also used can tomatoes because I was in a pinch for a side dish and it was still really good. I will use freash next time and add some black olives.Cant imagine it being any better but we will see. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This has such a great flavor!  I added a can of tomato paste instead of having it simmer down to get thicker.
I used shrimp.  It was good, but I think next time I'll do it without!

Fantastic summer meal. As other reviewers, I used 1 can of italian diced tomatoes (drained) and 6 cloves of garlic. I also added some yellow diced peppers, mushrooms and shrimp. We loved it! I will make this over and over.

I really, really like this. I make it all the time. I think the Balsamic vinegar really makes it! Do adjust the amount of pasta depending on how many people you're feeding though, 2 packets seems a bit overboard, to me. Excellent recipe!

very easy and good, use extra basil though, and it's great with shrimp. I put extra chicken broth in(14 oz. instead of 10) and partially cooked the pasta in the sauce.

Great base recipe - ready for some creative additions.  I tried it with chicken (the short-cuts already cooked Italian style) and didn't care for it (the chicken that is, not the recipe!).  Shrimp would have been much better - I did double all the spices, and would probably add even more next time - we like a little more kick in our pastas.  Wine would have been a nice addition.  Fresh herbs from the garden made it even better.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe - definitely a keeper!

One of my favorites!  The only change I made was using half wine half broth.  This is a very easy meal to put together.  Delicious.  Thank you for sharing it!

This is very good for a base recipe. It needs a lot more spice than what is called for.

This was very, very good, and so easy to make! My only change would be adding a little bit more tomatoes. 
This pasta is also amazing cold on hot days  plain or with a tiny bit of vinaigrette.

WOW, this was delicious. Half way thru browning onion added sliced boneless chicken pieces with 5 garlic cloves (just so the garlic didn't burn). Once chicken is cooked I added 1 can of diced tomatoes etc. I left out the red pepper flakes (personal taste). Suggest you use lots of fresh basil. Soooo Good!!

Nice!  Next time I will add more garlic & basil.  I also think that next time I will make the sauce one day ahead so that the flavors have time to meld.  I added chicken, which was good....but, I could see shirmp even working better.  It was a nice light pasta which I'll make again!

It definitely tastes GOOD! I tried twice, once with spaghetti and the other with angel hair, they both work.  Doesn't make me want to fly, but truly is great.

I thought this was delicious.  Husband thought it was okay.  Thus the 4 stars.  Followed the recipe, except substituted one can diced tomatoes for the fresh, added a small can of drained mushrooms, and simmered on the stove for about 40-45 minutes - so the flavors infused. It was easy to fix and much better than I expected.

This was a good sauce.  I do agree that this needs to sit for more time than stated.  Atleast an hour if not more.  I used half the broth and the other half white wine.  Also I added a few tsps of sugar to lessen the acidity from the tomatoes.  I adjusted the seasonings to my liking as well. Came out very yummy over whole grain angel hair pasta.  Thanks for the share.

So simple, so good! I put a little extra red pepper in for a kick. I love this because in about a half hour I have a dinner that tastes like something I would order in a restuarant.

Absolutely the best easy pasta recipe. This is now the "go to" dish in my house if we have to fix dinner on the spur of the moment for company or just us. I'm not the cook of the house, my husband is and he loves this recipe, so easy and it tastes great. Sometimes we'll throw in some shrimp and that's delicious too.

I also used a shallot with the garlic and onion.  I used canned diced tomatoes and it turned out well.  Instead of the chicken stock, I used some of the pasta water it the sauce was not spoiled by a meaty flavour.

Excellent light and easy recipe.  I used half the oil and vinegar.  Also, I used farfalle, made the sauce separate and tossed together at the end.  Served with grilled chicken on top.  Even my meat and potatoes husband loved it.

This was good and made good use of the fresh basil in my garden.  Next time I make it I will use another kind of pasta.  My kids, for whatever reason, did not like the angel hair pasta.  The liked the sauce though.

Very good!  Next time I will not add the pasta to the sauce in the sauce pan, because the pasta cooked really quickly and was a little too mushy after simmering it with the sauce. Instead I will just mix the two together when the sauce is ready, and serve.  Next time I will also try adding some red wine.  Great recipe!!

Oh my gosh... so good!  I didn't realize until I was actually cooking that I didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar, and it was still awesome.  I'll be making this a lot!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this exactly as  outlined except I used  16 oz. of linguine.  After cooking the pasta and simmering the tomatoes/broth mixture, I combined the two and simmered for the additional time as directed. I didn't have any liquid left over and it was quite tasty.  I'll definitely make this again.

I made half the recipe tonight and thought it was too much pasta.  Also a little confused on the the last simmer.  Once I added the pasta there was no liquid left!  Will try it again but with half the amount of pasta called for and see how it goes.  It was yummy, tho!

Excellent recipe and so simple! I added a bit more fresh garlic than what was listed and used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic/olive oil already added (in addition to the roma tomatoes.) I also simmered mine for a bit longer than 8 mins. Adding parmesan reggiano and a fresh loaf of Italian bread makes this meal!

I made this recipe according to Jody D's specifications.  It had a good flavor but was too spicy for my husband.  I only used one box of pasta and added 1 chicken breast.  The chicken gave it body.  I might make this again.  Next time I'll use less garlic.

This was great, my fiance said it tasted like something from an Italian restaurant. It has a lot of flavor but isn't too heavy. I made changes as others suggested--I used half a can of chicken broth, added "half a can" of white wine, snd used 1 can of Italian-seasoned tomatoes. I used 1 tsp of dried basil instead of fresh. I also added shrimp but personally feel this dish would be better with chicken, cut into strips and thrown in when you start sauteeing the onions and garlic.

This recipe was ok. It had a nice flavor, but was too thin in my opinion. The only change I made to it was cutting the vinegar in half. I agree with other reviews that maybe adding artichokes or sausage to give it a little more body.

Wayyyy too much pasta - you definitely only need half the amount stated.  I thickened the sauce with cornstarch as I realised it would have gone to waste otherwise so next time I will use less stock, or maybe even none at all.  I added cooked chicken as suggested and I think it would have been rather bland without it.  It's a keeper but it still needs some tweaking.  Thanks!

This recipe is delicious. I did a few adjustments though when I made it. I followed mostly everything, except I used dry basil instead of fresh, since I didn't have any on hand, and I added fresh pieces of bacon. It tasted so good and I will definitely make this over and over. It is light and perfect for a quick and easy meal.

AMAZING! I will definately make this again...I didnt put any pepper in there, and I used half a bullion cube with the vinegar and tomatos.  At the end when everything was simmering, I added some white wine. Next time, I will peel the tomatos before dicing them.  The skins on my maters were tough! Anyway, YUM!!

This was really good. I used half a can of vegetable broth and whole wheat pasta, but kept the rest of the original recipe.  Very light and 'different'.  Loved it!  Fiance gave it a 8.5 out of 10.  :)

We loved this recipe, I used it as a base. I added sauteed: mushrooms; yellow, green, & red bell peppers; & then added grilled boneless skinless chicken breasts before serving. Serve it with a salad & french bread  & you have a great meal for any night or company! Thanks again!

This pasta was so good! Even my boyfriend liked it and he usually only likes things swimming in grease. I followed the advice of others and reduced the amount of pasta I used by half. This recipe really makes a lot!

Pretty decent, but I found it to be a little bland. I'm suspecting that's because I didn't have any fresh basil on hand, so I used dried. I think trying it with the fresh basil will make a difference.

This was really tasty, and not too hot for my one year old son.  We didn't have any angel hair, so I used penne and it was great.  The only complaint I have is that it was VERY watery--I think next time I will cut out the chicken broth.  My husband came along while I wasn't looking and dumped in a bunch of flour, which did thicken it quite a bit, though I wasn't thrilled that he did it!  The vinegar gives a really nice flavor, too.  A quick and easy weeknight meal.

This has become one of our favorite recipes. I do add quite a bit of crushed red pepper for a little more zip, and I use 6 good sized cloves of garlic. The balsamic vinegar gives it an excellent flavor. Serve with some good red wine and you'll think you're at a 5-Star trattoria! Thank you for this one. It's a keeper.

I was initially reluctant about some of the ingredients but willing to try something new.  Was thoroughly impressed...added an extra clove of garlic, more garlic is always better...Even the family who dislikes onions was very impressed and cleaned their plate!!  Will keep this recipe...  A++ !

Unfortunately, I was distracted the first time I made it and actually cooked the angel hair 8 minutes as suggested in the directions - so it was really mushy.  However, I knew I liked the taste of the sauce so we tried it again cooking the pasta about 3 minutes until al dente. I took others advice and didn't use two (8oz) pkgs. - one package is plenty for the amount of sauce. The sauce has and light fresh flavor - good!

Yummy.  I upped the garlic.  Fresh basil makes a big difference.  I used canned diced tomatoes, as well.  Great.

When I made this, I didn't think my family would like it, but they did!  The very next day they asked me to make it again.

This is a great pasta that would work well as a main course or as a side dish. I sauteed shrimp in garlic and white wine and add them to this for my meal. Yum! However, it makes A LOT of pasta if you use the suggested amount. I doubled the recipe for a dinner party and used 24 oz of pasta (it would have called for 32 oz) and that was more than enough (I could have made even less). A great pasta however - good flavor and mine wasn't watery at all.

This was a very light and flavorful pasta dish. I would not recommend using 2 8oz. of pasta. I used 12 ounces and it was still too much. I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh and drained it since it calls for chicken broth...I didn't want it to be to soupy. I served it with the feta chicken recipe from this website.

Holy COW!  Just finished consuming this delish dish and I couldn't be more pleased with this light pasta!  I wanted something light to go with the baked scallops, and this was perfect!  I added chicken for the kids and used canned diced tomatoes.  The balsamic vinegar was a perfect touch and the chicken bouillion was not making it too thin as I first thought!  THANKS!

great flavor- but needed to add more garlic.  it was also a little too watery for my tastes, but it ended up mixing with the angel hair pasta quite well.

I LOVE this recipe.  I wouldn't change anything about it, it smells soooo good when cooking and it's really easy to make.  I have tried using a can of fresh diced tomatoes instead of chopping the tomatoes myself, both ways come out great!

This recipe is great!  I added slightly more balsamic vinegar by accident and liked it better that way.  I've also experimented with a can of sliced mushrooms.  Stay away from fresh mushrooms as they have a lot of water and make a the dish watery (cooking it too long eliminates the nice chunks of tomato in it).I have made this recipe 5 times in as many weeks and my hubby and I have loved it each time!  Looks like a restaurant-style pasta dish.

This recipe was a hit with my boyfriend and friends!  I do agree to reduce the amount of pasta to 12-14 ounces and I used can tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes.  This recipe is definately a keeper!

This was fantastic!!  I whipped this up for a cookout over the weekend and everyone loved it.  I used diced petite tomatoes w/ green chiles.  I also cut back the balsamic vinegar.  First time I ever used that so I was afraid it would be a lil' strong.  Will definitely make in near future, leftovers were all gone the next day!!!

My boyfriend and I love this!  We make it quite often.  I use 2 cans of diced tomatoes (generally one petite diced and one regular) instead of the fresh tomatoes.  I also don't put in the red or black pepper and I don't use the parmesan cheese.  I also use around 12 oz. of angel hair instead of 16 to ensure there is enough sauce.  This recipe is AWESOME!!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a really easy recipe (and good too).  I substituted vegetable stock for chicken and added a tablespoon or so of white wine.   I recommed decreasing the amount of pasta to 12-14 ounces.

Had a good flavor.  Used corkscrew pasta rather than angel hair since I did not have any.  Came out okay.  Will try again with angel hair next time.  Thanks Dinah!

I tried this recipe out for a workplace potluck luncheon.  It was well-received.  The comments I heard were, "light and tasty", "a nice change from the usual tomatoey sauces".  I thought it was good though a bit bland.  I will spice it up more next time and maybe add some mushrooms......yum!

This was an ok dish.  I found that it dried out very quickly.  Will make it again with modifications!
