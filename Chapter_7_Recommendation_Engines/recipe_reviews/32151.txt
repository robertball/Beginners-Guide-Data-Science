The meatloaf was fabulous - very tasty and very hearty. Loved all the vegetables. i didn't make the gravy as I didn't have time that day. I used a store gravy. I will try that next time since the main recipe was so good.

The taste of the meatloaf was pretty good although I was cooking for my family (4 kids) and all the kids thought it looked odd.  Since it calls for ground turkey it turns out very pale and not looking like a typical meatloaf.  My husband liked it and did make some sandwiches from the leftovers.  Since the kids won't touch it I probably won't be making again.

Excellent flavor! A lot of work, but well worth it. I had trouble finding chicken sausage, so I used low fat Jimmy Dean sausage. Also came out too wet, so next time I will only use 1 egg. I did not strain the gravy, since it tasted fine with the cut up vegetables. I only discarded the bay leafs and thyme. Figured after cutting up more vegetables for the gravy, I wasnt' go to toss them, I'd eat them!

We loved this recipe.  I must confess to not being a big cumin fan, so I left that out.  I cannot imagine that this would have been any better with it.  The gravy was just deeeeeeeeeelish!

Meatloaf was good with the gravy. Must have the gravy (double the gravy)! Also mine was really sloppy (I doubled the recipe so the conversion might have affected it) and I had to add ALOT of bread crumbs. Doubling made enough for like 20 people. Overall good with the garlic mashed potatoes.

awesome flavor...on advice of others, less one egg, more garlic. Made an organic packet gravy, ran out of time.  Kiddos ate it for dinner, lunch and dinner the next day.

The chicken sausage gave this meatloaf a unique taste.  The half and half and all of the different vegetables was waay too much for this recipe.  The gravy was horrible (too thin, watery and milky).  Next time, I'll just stick to my regular salsa beef meatloaf!!

I loved this recipe.  I did not have time to make the gravy, so this rating is based only on the meatloaf itself.  I did find it to be spicy from the cayenne, but I happen to like spice.  Mine needed a bit more breadcrumbs.  I used turkey sausage instead of chicken. I minced all the veggies in a food processor.  Instead of placing in a bread pan, I formed a free standing loaf in a baking pan. It cooked for 60 minutes total. It was alot of work although it was worth it.  If you are like me and love something different with unique flavors, this recipe is for you.

My husband does not really care much for meatloaf, but this recipe was a hit. The combination of vegies and spices in this meatloaf made it an instant favorite. I did add cheesy french fried onions on top, which gave it an extra element of flavor.

Using a food processor really helped cut down on the "mincing" time, as well as mixing the ingredients together. This was a nice combination of flavours, and tasted really yummy, although I did have difficulty with removing the casings from the chicken sausages.  My kids loved it!

I make this regularly without the gravy it's flavorful and high in protein I don't find it to be too moist with the three eggs.
