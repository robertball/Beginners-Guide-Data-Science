This is my new favorite salad! I love the simple, tart dressing, and the pepperiness of the arugula keeps the avocado, cheese, and bacon from making it too heavy. Yes, I use real bacon bits instead of prosciutto, just because I always have it around. I use the Costco ones and toast them in a warm pan so they're crispy. The only other substitute I make is using mozzarella pearls instead of burrata, just because I prefer the texture. Makes a great lunch or light dinner.

Delicious and refreshing salad. The creaminess of the burrata and the avocado are so smooth together it seems like they are related. The prosciutto adds a hint of smokiness. The rucola adds some spiciness;  together the whole salad just bursts with flavour. I would never have put a burrata with an avocado and now can't see why I didn't. What a lovely combination. Thank you Liz Dalton for this wonderful creation.

We loved this salad! Plus, we love buratta, I used spinach instead of arugula because that’s what I had on hand. Definitely will make this again.

An excellent salad.  I scaled the servings  to feed the two of us, except I used one  whole burrato -my husband loves this cheese!  And I used fresh greens from our spring garden, including arugula, kale, and spinach.   The prosciutto lent an excellent, salty flavor to the greens, and the avocado’s creaminess lent its dgeliciousness to the entire dinner salad.  A keeper!

Used mozzarella instead.
