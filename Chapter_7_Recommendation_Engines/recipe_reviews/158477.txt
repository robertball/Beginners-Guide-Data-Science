I've made this several times and it is very yummy. However I do mash the bananas, instead of slicing. And soak the whole works in a bowl for 5 min. before pouring into the baking dish. Plus I add a tablespoon of butter to the top, before baking (in a pan of hot water). Very good and well worth the price of the dried cherries.
