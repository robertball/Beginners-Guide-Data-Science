This was really good and really, really easy! I added a cup of turkey ham, and used a whole can of diced tomatoes. Also, added a cup of chicken broth to stretch this out a bit. It had fabulous flavor overall, and only took twenty minutes to make. I will make this again.

This was great.  I used ham instead of bacon and added a little smoke flavoring.  I added Rotel tomatoes and green chilis instead of regular tomatoes.  Really, really good.

I prepared according to directions and this soup turned out perfectly.  There was plenty for leftovers the next day and I served the soup with a grilled ham and cheese sandwich.  Delicious and fast to prepare.

This was a good winter soup, paired nicely with a salad. I used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and 32 oz. of chicken broth to stretch out the recipe. Also the recipe doesn't state dried or fresh herbs so I used dried since it was all I had. Good flavor, not too salty and not bland.

This is a quick and easy recipe that can be also used as a base recipe for meat and vegetable soups.  Great flavor.

Super easy, super tasty; you probably have all the ingredients on hand... I did! Simple but elegant enough to serve to guests. I used center-cut bacon so increased the qty to 6 slices. I also had no thyme so used a pinch of Old Bay seasoning. My husband who normally must have cheese on everything loooved it. We served it with biscuits - would be even better with crusty sourdough bread.
