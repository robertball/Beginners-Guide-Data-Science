I made this for a friend with gestational diabetes and changed just a few things to make it completely sugar free-
I used sugar free shortbread cookies for the crust and mixed 1 C. whipping cream with 1/2 packet of sugar free vanilla pudding instead of the whipped topping. It turned out wonderful! (You can mix the whole packet of pudding mix with a 2C. carton of whipping cram and save half for frosting a sugar free cake or something.)

The texture was too much like jello. . . . not what I was looking for.  However, based on some of the other suggestions, I came up with the following:
16-oz fat-free cream cheese;
1-pkg (1-oz) sugar-free instant cheesecake pudding(or vanilla);
3/4-c fat-free milk;
1-pkg (.3-oz) sugar-free lemon Jello;
1-c boiling water.
1. Beat cream cheese until smooth.  Add pudding mix and beat to incorporate. Slowly add milk, mixing thoroughly.  Donâ€™t worry about small lumps; the hot Jello will work them out.
2.  Combine the Jello and boiling water, mixing to dissolve.
3.  Slowly pour the hot Jello into the pudding mixture, beating continuously.
4.  Pour the filling into the crust and refrigerate until firm, about 2-3 hours (over-night is best).

For those who can have the sugar and fat, and don't enjoy the artificial flavor, just use full fat and sugar ingredients.  I'm sure that'll taste even better!

Made this recipe for my sister who is dibetic. She loved it! I did make a few small changes. I used stawberry jello instead. I also used 2 packs of cream cheese. Also I added sugar free stawberry preserves on top. I was unable to eat it because I'm dieting, but it is going to be one of the first things a make after this diet! Tasted it and it was incredible! Next time I'll use fat free cream cheese! You'll love this one!

I have recently been hired as a cook for a large facility.  I was told that a lot of the clients have a sweet tooth, but a few were diabetic and recipes, although they had several cookbooks, were pretty much all the same thing for the diabetics.  I made this one night, and they fell head over heals for it!  Even my boss was asking about it!!!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definately pass it along.

I made this for a family gathering and used a store-bought crust.  My husband didn't like it and my mother said it had an "artificial" taste to it.

This was a hit for an office birthday party.  I used strawberry-kiwi jello (I'm not a big lemon fan) and added sliced, fresh strawberries on top.  I didn't notice any aftertaste from the sugar-free jello.

FABULOUS!!! This was such a hit yesterday for Thanksgiving, it went faster than the other 9 pies on the table!!! *******Info that's good to know: Taste and texture is more like a mild Key Lime pie than cheesecake. I used a 8x8 glass Pyrex dish and it still came out great, prob. better (made it thicker). I baked the crust an extra 5 minutes. I added about 2 Tbsp of Splenda as well. Gelatin doesn't get "thick" - I tried to let it sit to get "thick", and after 1 hour of sitting it was still very much like the original state. I used it anyway and it turned out great. Other than that, I'll be adding additional lime or lemon extract to make it just a tad stronger in flavor. Overall, I find it amazing that this isn't loaded with sugar - it's beyond delicious, and I'll be making it for myself as a somewhat guiltless pleasure!

Lovely, light, guilt free dessert!   My only changes were to use a small box (.3 oz) of lemon gelatin rather than the .6 called for in this recipe,...and I used a prepared graham cracker pie crust for convenience.  Results were excellent.  I will make this again.

A good recipe.  I experiment a lot in variations.  I omit the cinnamon.  Instead of Lemon flavored sugar-free jello, I also tried Orange flavore with orange zest, or Lime (mock keylime). If you try cherry or even strawberry, add fresh berries to the mixture as well.

This was really good. I used individual tart shells and garnished with a fresh strawberry sliced to fan out. It was a nice surprise for my diabetic husband on Valentine's.  Will make again.

I did not add the cinnamon to the crust. That was the only change I made. This really isn't a bad cheesecake--I really was surprized. Light and fluffy and just sweet enough. I think this would make a great mousse dessert (and lower in carbs) if I were to skip the crust next time and pipe into dessert cups.

This recipe was great. I did do sugar free strawberry jello instead and made the crust from sugar free shortbread cookies. I put some strawberries on top and My family couldn't tell that it was sugar free. Now I have a guilt free dessert for the summer. Thank you all for the hints!!

Hmmm, I like the alternative but diabetic people should be aware that this recipe is not sugar free. Graham crackers have 7g of sugar per serving, Ingredients in graham crackers typically include sugar and high-fructose corn syrup.

This was good, as far as low-sugar cheesecakes are concerned. I am really not a fan of artificial sweetener, nor is my stomach. So I wanted to find a cheesecake that didn't use too much fake sugar. I found this, and because I am watching my carbs (not just sugar) I made a crust out of finely chopped pecans and melted butter and pressed into a pie pan. Also, I doubled the cream cheese and halfed the jello and I couldnt imagine using more jello than I did. The consistency was JUST right as I did it. Lastly, if you aren't a fan of lemon, use another flavor. I didn't care for the sourness, but may have liked it more with strawberry or even lime. Worth a try!

My boyfriend (pre-diabetic) loved this cheesecake--along with everyone else who got their hands on it!  I did make a few chanhes to the recipe.  I did not add any cinnamon, used Cherry sugar free jello, and put no sugar added Cherry pie filling around the edges.  It covers up the odd color of the Cherry jello mix.  Also used fat free whipped topping and cream cheese instead to cut down on fat!  Tastes very yummy, and a better flavor than the lemon, which didn't go over too well the first time.  It was rather bland I think.  Also put it in a round (8 inch?) pan.

My husband is a fairly recent diabetic, so is always very disappointed with the tastes of desserts that he (use) to love.......until now! He could not believe this is sugar free!! This is a weekly dessert in our house. I've tried rasberry, lime and orange...rasberry is the favourite!!!

I only wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for cheesecake recipes I can convert to low carb/sugar free. Because I use Splenda instead of sugar the cheesecakes usually suffer a bit in the consistency department. Not with this recipe though. One other change I made was to omit the flour and cornstarch to keep the carbs low. As other posters suggested I used 24 ounces of cream cheese and 8 ounces of sour cream. It was easily the best sugar free cheesecake I have made (and Iâ€™ve made a lot!). I baked this with a nut crust and topped it with sugar free cherry pie filling. When I brought it to a cookout no one could tell it was low carb. I got a lot of requests for the recipe. Now if I can just bake a cheesecake without cracks on the topâ€¦

I went with a few suggestions from the previous raters and it was very good for a no bake sugar-free cheesecake. I used two packages of cream cheese, no cinnamon, and what seemed to be a smaller box of lemon jello light. The only thing I would still change for next time is to try it with real whipped cream instead of Cool Whip... that would make it perfect, because the Cool Whip does have a bit of artifical taste and that was my only complaint. I only gave this 4 stars because I did make those changes, but everyone I served it to really loved it and my diabetic mother-in-law was very very grateful I found the recipe, now she can have dessert on special occasions too!

I experimented with this alot and over the last 2 weeks Ive made it nearly 6 times. People keep asking for it ... I always use about 1/2 packet of cheesecake pudding mix and I do make sure to whip the jello, vanilla, and cream cheese really well. I cut the jello to .3oz as well. I also add fresh fruit to the top each time. I probably have tried it with every flavor of jello and its always a hit! Thank you for this!

If you're on restricted diet, this is a pretty good recipe.  I used 2, 8 oz pkgs of cream cheese instead of 1. That gave it a creamier texture and better taste, but I also had to add a little sugar substitute to taste.  For the crust I substituted 1 C of finely chopped walnuts mixed with 2T melted butter and 1/2 t cinnamon and sugar subsitute to taste.

This recipe does NOT deserve the 4.5 star rating it has received!  I wish I would have read the reviews before I made it; it seems as though every review that was good had completely changed the original recipe!  I made this for a family dinner and was so embarrassed.  The texture was AWFUL - like RUBBER.  The crust was very good and the actual taste was good, but the texture was SO BAD that no one ate it!!  I am SO disappointed in those members who gave this such a high rating, when they were actually rating their own version of it.  And it does need changing, believe me...!

5 star for taste, 4 because I had to follow MFGriffins changes. Double the cream cheese, mix in pudding, add milk and disolve Jello in 1 cup boiling water. I used an extra large pre-made shell. It was just the right amount of filling. I used lemon jello and lemon pudding, but I want to try other combo's. It's not real cheesecake, but for a quick no bake pie it's wonderful. I would even try it with regular ingredients if sugar free isn't needed.

I made this cheesecake for my diabetic mother for the holidays and the whole family raved about how great it was.  I also made two other regular cheesecakes but the sugarfree one was the first to go.  You will love it. It's quick and simple to make, it has a light and creamy texture, and the hint of lemon taste is great.

I loved this recipe after taking advice from others and adding my own little twist. The only changes I made were replacing the .6 oz lemon gelatin with 1 (0.3oz) box sugar-free raspberry jello and 1 (1 oz) box sugar-free lemon pudding mix and 1-1/2 cups cold fat-free milk. Everything else remained the same, including the 1 cup hot water. I stirred in some lemon zest and a tsp of lime juice to give it a little more "zing", topped it with some blueberries, and it was to die for! My boyfriend loved it so much he licked his bowl!

Absolutely enthralled by this recipe as it is surprising the closest thing to real cheesecake that I can take to my diabetic friend who is unable to enjoy any of the other sugar-loaded deserts I make. So every time I see him I bring him one of these cheesecakes and he loves them. Plus you can freeze it for later.

I thought it was fantastic, but my husband thought it was too lemony (even though he ate it all). I'll be making it again, perhaps with strawberry or orange.

Great Cheesecake! I did change the recipe slightly.  I used only small 3 oz. box of lemon jello and a small 3 oz. box of cheesecake pudding mix. I do like a cheesy taste, so next time I will add an extra 3 oz of cream cheese.

no flavor what so ever.  Needs maybe a fruit topping or something but the texture is way to heavy.

Husband and brother-in-law are both diabetic and I made this for Sunday dinner dessert. They both liked it but agreeded it is not a cheesecake. We decided to call it 'Lemon Fluff'. I used 2 small jellos with the cup of hot water and 2 cream chesses. Will make again. Brother-in-law is really hard to please and he really liked this one.

I made this for my husband who has lost 80 lbs so he could have dessert with the rest of us. He loved it. He would not try it when I made it with sugar free cherry. It was good, but like another reviewer I
think 1 3 oz pkg of jello is enough. I made it in a prepared round graham cracker pie crust eliminating the hardest part of the recipe. I will continue to try other flavors. It is a real keeper!

This is wonderful. I didn't use the cinnamon (by accident) and it turned out great. The one thing I would do differently next time, is use two pkg. cream cheese, as suggested by another reviewer. The pie texture was too much like firm gelatin. I think the extra cream cheese would make it  more creamy. Thank you for the post!

I read the review about the person who made it for someone with gestational diabetes. The homemade whipped cream made the flavor very good. I varied though and used 1/2 box of sugar-free cheesecake flavored pudding mix. Overall pie turned out very well. Don't expect a cheesecake, but something that tastes very good for those who can't have sugar.

I've made this several times using different jello flavors. I do think lemon is the best, very light and refreshing. My father-in-law in a diabetic and really enjoys this dessert. I have some trouble with the texture being a bit lumpy, but that's probably something I do wrong :P

Thank you for an elegant dessert I can now serve to diabetic friends.  I also make it with regular jello (orange flavor) and substituting orange liqueur for part of the water.

Both my husband and father-in-law must watch their sugar.  I served this to them for dessert last night and both were suprised how well it tasted.  I even used fat free cream cheese and cool whip.  I just would have liked the lemon flavor to be alittle stronger.

I have a client who is diabetic and has a pot luck supper in his apartment building every month. He always wants to take this to the supper. In our local supermarket they don't have lemon flavored jelly though so I make other flavors. Everyone at the supper emjoys it.

I prefer my version of this. I make the jello (lemon is the best) and let it set in a pie dish. When it is set I top it with a mixture of fat free cream cheese, sugar free whipped topping and 1/4 cup Splenda. It is sugar free and diet friendly.

All in all a pretty good sugar-free cheesecake. The texture was a little too much like jello for my taste but the flavor was good and the crust was great! The jello texture wasn't enough of a turn-off for me not want to make this again.

It was pretty tasty for sugar free. I also used more cream cheese than what was called for (about 12oz.) and I only used about 3/4 of the Jello. I only had raspberry jello so that's what I used and it was good. Not as thick as the real thing and it doesn't have as much richness but its an excellent alternative!

Eh...it was a bit bland for me.  I used a 3 oz box of sugar free lime jello so maybe that's why it was lacking in the flavor department.  Also, it wasn't as creamy as I was hoping - more like a whipped pie than cheese cake.

I looked on some of the "remakes" that others did and incorporated those.  It was good but I am going to use 2 boxes of cheesecake pudding next time to give it a familiar taste...this one tasted too much like  lemon and cream cheese.  Overall...well worth  making again for someone that can't have sugar.  ALSO for a true sugar free recipe...use sugar free cookies instead of graham crackers...it tasted great!

Hello to one and all.  I just wanted to say that I am glad I FINALLY found THIS recipe again.  I first found it in 2001 (under Becca Boo).  I have lost my copy (and although I handed MANY out, no one else could find theirs either!)  So, thank you Penny for putting this here.  On the recipe itself, I have tried it with just about every sugar-free flavor jello I can get my hands on and honestly believe there is a flavor for anyone willing to experiment. (Layering complimentary flavors for an elegant presentation.  Of course, you will get 2 cheescakes which will no doubt rapidly disappear!) I currently work in a smaller care facility, but all are anxious to try this cake.  Thank you again Penny!

This is a good-tasting, creamy pie!  I made it with sugar-free orange gelatin, and it tasted like those orange cream popsicles.  I added the following:  1 package of cream cheese, 4 packets of Equal.  My family voted this recipe a keeper. Next time, I will try with different flavors.

The reaction I got most when I served this was "it's too sour!" It's a great recipe but next time I think i'll use a different flavor of jello.

This was very easy to make. Had to fold in whipped topping cause the jello goes from thin to set very quickly, I ended up mixing not folding and it turned out fine. But the taste was TOO MUCH LEMON! It may be better with some other kind of jello-just didn't taste good.

This came out very good and can be made into many different versions of cheesecake so it's good to have in a pinch.  I wouldn't say exactly that it's sugar free though because i'm pretty sure graham crackers contain sugar.  Very good though and totally recommend for a fun and easy spring/summer dessert.

While not completely sugar free (unless there is such a thing as sugar free frozen whipped topping that I just couldn't find), I like this one.
I used strawberry sugar free Jello instead of lemon.  I also blended fresh strawberries into the whipped topping and re-froze it before folding it into the cream cheese and jello mixture.
I cooled the jello a little too much so the texture didn't come out quite right, but the flavor was fresh and tangy.
I'll make it again, but next time I'll be more careful about the jello, and I'll also cut back the butter and graham cracker a little next time for a little thinner crust.

This recipe is easy to do and the taste I would rate as good... the only real issue I had with it was the consistency of the dessert.  I made it exactly as written.  I will save this and make again as it has good flavor but will try variations to help make it more creamy in texture.  Overall a good recipe!! thank you.

I made this dessert for my diabetic father.  Everyone there loved this dessert and asked me to bring it to every function from now on.  I used a reduced fat graham cracker crust, strawberry jello, cheesecake pudding with 3/4 cup milk and no cinnamon.  In my opinion it tasted too sugar free for me, but it deserves five stars for the rave reviews from my family.

Like others suggested, I used the sugarfree cheesecake pudding mix, and the smaller jello (.33 I think), and 2 cups of milk.  It turned out pretty well, but to me it's more like a parfait than a cheesecake.

it was good for sugar free. but ONLY USE HALF THE JELLO!!!  it gives it a really strong tase. I added some cheesecake pudding. But I thought it was good. a little lumpy. maybe my fault.

It is pretty good for a sugar free treat.  It does have a bit of a jello taste.  I did the recipe exactly as written.  I plan to keep the recipe but next time I will use more cream cheese and maybe whipped packets instead.  I could taste the coolwhip.  Enjoy.

this was a great dessert.  I added a little extra cream cheese and used sugar-free raspberry jello instead of the lemon.  I also made my own whipped topping with heavy whipping cream and Splenda.  It was a hit!

I used lemon extract, unflavored gelatin, and grated lemon zest for flavoring, in addition to 4T of Splenda.  After chilling for 3 hours, it was ready to go!  Someone posted that theirs turned out runny - mine didn't.  It was a yummy, simple, fast cake and I would make it again for sure.  Not similar in density or richness to a traditional cheesecake but that's part of what I like about it.

A gelatin-like consistency just doesn't seem right for cheesecake.  If you are looking for something just as easy and much tastier (no gelatin or whipped topping) try No Bake Cheesecake 1 from this website.

This was a hit on 4th of July with my father, sister and brother-in-law who should not eat sugar.  I topped it with fresh blueberries and raspberries which looked very patriotic and added some pizzazz.

i made this as a no-guilt dessert while my husband and i are watching what we eat. it was good - but tasted nothing like cheesecake! it tasted more like a gelatin pudding. considering how healthy it is though, i guess that's to be expected. very easy and quick.

I made it, but followed the reviews first.  I used 2 bars of cream cheese and instant sugar free vanilla pudding with a little milk, just like another reviewer  suggested .  It still turned out on the softer side, but my husband loved it.  He has just been forced to reduce his sugar intake and This recipe is a keeper!

I thawed out enough blueberries to cover the top and made a glaze of 1 C Splenda, 2 T. cornstarch, mixed together, then added 1 C water. Bring to a boil stirring constantly till dissolved. Cool slightly and add 1 pk sugar-free berry-flavored Jello, stir well. Pour over the blueberries and chill in the fridge.  This dessert is a lot better the next day. Next time I'm making it a day ahead of when I need it. I? served it to a neighbor and he loved it too.

I really liked the flavor but the consistency was a little too gelatinous. next time I will double the cream cheese and half the jello. lime jello gives it a nice key lime taste

I loved it, next time I think I'll make 2 pies. I want to try one with strawberry Jell-O, but together with the lemon, maybe a 2 layer pie ... yum.. thanks for this wonderful recipe.

It was my turn to make lunch for a group that meets monthly. One of our members is diabetic & fragile. I used the variation posted by MFGriffin and it was a big hit. I brought a piece home to my finicky husband and he wants me to make more. Thanks, MFGriffin for your version. It will be a regular for us.

Love this recipe! It is so easy  to change up with different flavors of SF gelatin mix.  Easily adaptable for people who are limiting their carbs. I just eliminated the crust and sprinkled a few graham cracker crumbs over the top. Delicious!

Came out perfectly. The texture was strange, like rubber.  Definitely needs the whip cream.

Great recipe. It is not truly sugar free but has so little sugar that it works well with a diabetic diet. Don't forget you can use any kind of sugar free jello flavor you want. I did the lemon but will try cherry next.

I have made this twice, both times for diabetics. My best friend's husband really enjoyed it as did the whole family! I had to make it again before the end of my visit so he'd have some for himself!
I stuck one in my brother's fridge after Father's Day. It was a surprise for him (his wife passed ).He also loved it! I used lime hello for one of them and it was a nice tang!

My family really enjoyed this cheesecake. I did change one thing instead of the Lemon gelatin I used a sugar free cheesecake pudding and kept everything else the same. This gave the cheesecake more texture and tasted more like a cheesecake.

It came out really good.  I combined from the other suggestions and upped it to 2 8 oz cream cheese.  Plus I lowered the gelatin to .3 oz.  Also, I did it with strawberry flavor instead of lemon.  And I added the preserves on top.  So good that I made it for my family who are not diabetics.  The kids loved it.  It is not quite as firm as a regular cheesecake.

This was pretty good but has potential to be better. Next time I will try the suggestion of adding a second package of cream cheese.

This didn't taste anything like a cheesecake.  It tasted more like a rubbery jello-like pudding.  The texture was strange.  I ate a slice but my husband and son through theirs away after one bite.  I would like to try it again using less jello, but I'm afraid that my family won't try it.
