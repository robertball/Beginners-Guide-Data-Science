This worked out great and they are so addictive. If one never had them before it s not actual cakes but rather cracker bread.I am going to have them with goat cheese and salmon and reminisce my Scotland trip. Thank you! I actually prefer them savoury and leave out the sugar completely.

Easy to make. I had been looking for base recipe to make a gluten free version for appetizers. This worked perfectly. Substituted Pillsbury Gluten Free All Purpose blend for wheat flour. Will be making again with fresh rosemary. Thanks!

Good basic recipe. I substituted 1 1/2 cups of the oats with 3/4 of a cup of steel cut and used smart balance instead of butter to stay away from cholesterol, and one gram of stevia instead of the sugar. I used a processor for the dry ingredients for sake of ease, then put into a bowl and cut the smart balance in with a shortening cutter. I used 3/4 a cup of hot water (steel cut oats are not processed with steam) then rolled out with a rolling pin and used a biscuit cutter. I did use modern technology but most have been in the family for 100 years (not the processor though).

I was pretty uncertain when I pulled them out of the oven but I actually really like them. I did increase the sugar to a tablespoon and added a tiny bit of molasses so the baking soda had something to react with.

Nice chewy texture. More like bread than a cookie or square. I tripled the sugar and it's only very slightly sweet. I flattened mine into one large rectangle on the cookie sheet and cut it after it baked easier and less mess than cutting out circles and it worked fine. Will make again for a healthy snack in lunches or easy breakfast on the go. Would be good with butter and jam if you want to forgo the healthy approach:)

Excellent but only with a few modifications to ingredients. To the dry ingredients I added about 1/2 cup of diced Turkish dried apricots or dried sugared cranberries. Instead of only a teaspoon I added 1/2 tablespoon of sugar and 1/2 cup of honey and mixed the honey w/ 1/2 cup of warm water before mixing into batter. With twice the water the batter stays together much better and is more moist. Instead of using plain rolled oats I have also used the minute variety which makes for an easier dough to work with.

Not bad they're kinda crumbly but the toasted oat flavor is great.

These were very crumbly and fell apart when cut or removed from the pan. I made another batch more like a bread by adding 3 eggs and baking it in a pie plate.

These were so delicious and easy to make. I plan to experiment with adding dried fruit and other ingredients to make them even more yummy.
