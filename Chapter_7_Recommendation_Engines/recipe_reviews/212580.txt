I made this as a quick and easy side dish. Only used half the can of soup because I am trying to be a little more health consious. I cooked the broccoli and soup in one pot and just let it simmer for a while to let the flavors get infused. Added a little bit of minced garlic for more flavor. It was very tasty! I will make it again. Good way to make veggies tasty.

This was a super easy and great tasting potato topper. It also tasted good just by itself, which is the way my husband ate it!  It's a lot easier then the way I remember my mom making cheesy broccoli growing up and tastes better too!!!  I didn't microwave this however.  I am not a fan of microwave baked potatoes.  I prefer them baked in the oven so the skins get nice and crispy.    I did steam my broccoli on the stove, drained the water and put the soup in the same pot with the broccoli to continue heating it up.  Very good!  I will definitely make this again!

This was just okay for me.  I think I would prefer it with real cheese and not the processed stuff.

Super Easy!  We had baked potato bar at woman's bible study.  I made this topping.  I used two cans of cheddar cheese soup, two bags of frozen broccoli, mixed together in microwavable crock pot bowl and heated about 16 minutes in microwave.  Stirred up and put in crock pot and I was off in no time, and no left overs came home.
