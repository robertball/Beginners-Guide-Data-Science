This was amazing! I feel guilty to review it though because I know it was posted by the makers of that brand sausage but I didn't use that, I actually used kielbasa because it's what I had.  I never had polenta so I made my own with sundried tomatoes and garlic added - then I broiled it brushed with olive oil to be crisp. Everything else was per the recipe and the flavors were amazing. My son didn't care for the polenta but my fussy husband didn't mind it because the flavor of the sausage & veggie part was so delicious. Oh ya, I did use a zucchini but I also added a summer squash as well. And I put the rest of the sundried tomatoes in with the sausage & vegetables. Definitely making this again!!

Very tasty - didn't have zucchini so used more mushrooms and onion.  Sauted polenta in a little olive oil which made it crispy on the outside, creamy inside. Next time will put in sausage together with the onions and peppers and leave out the oil.

excellent, tasty, colorful, and healthy! I grilled the veggies (used a green and red bell pepper instead of yellow)  in a little oil, then combined with the grilled and sliced sausage adding the seasoning and vinegar (which I don't normally like but thought it was excellent on this recipe. I never measure so I probably used a light hand when pouring, maybe it wasn't 2 TBLs) I also grilled the polenta slices.

I  upped the veggie amounts and threw in some shredded carrots and eggplant instead of yellow pepper. Really tasty. I oven roasted the eggplant and zucchini and grilled the polenta.

I was going to make my own polenta since it is cheeper and fairly easy to make. I forgot this when I started to make dinner tonight and I began cooking quinoa.  By the time I got to the polenta part, the quinoa was almost done, so I skipped it.  I also forgot the balsamic, but it was still good without it.  Next time, I will remember to read the directions first.

This is very good!  My husband loved it and ate every last bit.  He commented on how much he loved the balsamic addition and he doesn't normally like vinegar.  The combination of flavors is was a hit!  It's a very flavorful dish and I didn't have to add any extra spices or seasing.  I used a wok like I was making stir fry.  Followed the cooking directions to a tee except I made a few changes just based on personal preference.  I used olive oil instead of garlic oil (because I didn't want to buy any) and just added minced garlic to the onion/pepper mixture.  I used baby bellas instead of white button mushrooms and red pepper instead of yellow pepper.  Also, I fried the polenta slices in olive oil instead of microwaving to give them a nice, crispy texture on the outside.  I would definitely make this again and will likely make it for company.  Very, very tasty, thank you!

this was delicious! here's a tip: to save time, use a bag of pre-sliced pepper-and-onion blend (ours is called pepper and onion stir fry).  i keep bags in the freezer all the time because they don't go bad quickly, and they're super convenient in all sorts of recipes.  in this case, they can replace the pepper and onion.

Disliked the taste of the sausage.  Would have enjoyed the dish with a different type of sausage.

This was just okay for us.  Hubby liked the sausage but said that it was crying out for a sauce of some kind.  I had some left-over tomato sauce and that made it better.  I did use different veggies to use what I had on hand.  I replace zucchini with eggplant and I added asparagus.  I don't think that these changes would significantly alter the recipe.

This was great! I didn't have any peppers on hand so I omitted them, but other than that I followed the recipe to a T! I made this for breakfast for a big group before an all day wedding and it was a crowd pleaser. The pan was empty and the plates were cleared.

Very tasty recipe! It came together quickly and had tons of flavor. I wasn't sure about the vinegar at first, but I love the dept of flavor it gave the meal. I didn't have any polenta, so I served this over quinoa. Yum! I didn't make any other changes. I would definitely make this again.

Very good...used rice instead of polenta.  Also, used chicken sausage flavored with jalapeno and apples...the flavoring and vegetables were excellent and the balsalmic vinegar added a wonderful punch of flavor.

We all really enjoyed the sausage and vegetable mixture.  My daughter didn't care for the polenta, but my husband and I liked it.  We did think it could have used a light sprinkling of salt.  Instead of microwaving the polenta, I browned both sides on the electric griddle.  My husband said "This is AWESOME!  I give it nine stars!" (he knows we are only able to give recipes five stars LOL!  I made one change - I used the sun dried tomato flavor sausage to match the flavor of the polenta.  Definitely a keeper!

Very flavorful, yet easy to make. I had all of the ingredients on hand and followed recipe as written. I served this over whole wheat thin spaghetti. I will make this for dinner again!

VERY GOOD!  I tried to make this according to the recipe but I didn't have zucchini or polenta.  I substituted them with asparagus and rice.   It wasn't until I went to add the balsamic that I saw it was out-of-date; so, I used two tablespoons of Yoshida's gourmet cooking sauce.  I couldn't have asked for a better taste.  We thoroughly enjoyed this meal and I will make it again, probably the same way.  Thank you alfresco for sharing your recipe.

This was pretty good actually. I left out the Italian seasoning, but it was still extremely yummy. Next time though I might not add the sun dried tomatoes. It was too strong of a flavor for me, and I love sun dried tomatoes.

This is a keeper! My store does not carry the garlic chicken sausage, so i used the Sundried Tomato. I also served it over rice instead of polenta.  Everyone loved it and there was nothing left!  Will definitely be making again and again. Thanks al fresco!!

I made this today & I have to say that I have become a fan of Al Fresco Chicken Sausages.. It was really good. I used red bells instead. I thought it gave it more color & was cheaper. I also used the Al Fresco Dried Tomato & Basil Sausages. Never found the garlic type. Then I served it on dried tomato polenta & paired it with fresh roasted asparagus & onions.

I followed the recipe exactly. My whole family found it boring. In our opinion the sausage flavor was lacking any flavor but garlic. The balsamic vinegar added some depth too it, but it didn't seem to meld well with the sausage.  I am thinking a different sausage flavor sausage might help. However, we probably won't try this again.

Really good!  I used different sausage, coconut oil and added garlic, and didn't make polenta.  Didn't serve it over anything, it was good enough as just sausage and veggies!  Will start making without the sausage as a tasty veggie side dish too!

I didn't have the Roasted Garlic Chicken Sausage on hand so I used turkey smoked sausage.  This recipe was good!  Even my husband loves it and wants me to make it again.  Only I hope to have the chicken sausage next time!

What an amazing dish!! Love how the flavors mix up so intensely.  I used cooking spray instead of garlic oil, and grilled the sausage links to brown them up nicely before slicing as the recipe dictates.  Added that to the onions that were already started and a few minutes later, added cubed tofu as a substitute for the mushrooms.  I grilled the zucchini as well and served to the side of the dish. So fantastic, and flavorful...I have a happy family tonight!

Very good recipe, not a big fan of polenta though.
This would be really good over pasta or put in some Italian bread for a sandwich.

We loved this! Quick and easy to make. The flavors were lovely in combination. Since polenta is so easy to make, I didn't bother with buying it premade. I had white corn meal on hand, so made it myself. My SO mentioned that the texture of the chicken was a little "rubbery," so I may have overcooked the sausage. All told, it's a great, weeknight meal!

What I like most about the Al Fresco recipes is how flexible they are!  I had most of the items in the recipe, but I had the spinach and feta sausage, and it still works!  Great combination of flavors, things I would not normally combine.  I am reminded of Chef Pepin's advice to "use the grocery story as your sous chef", and that is exactly what Al Fresco recipes do.  You can have excellent quality food on the table in minutes.

This was very good despite my mistake of grabbing the bottle of Worcestershire sauce instead of the balsamic vinegar!  I wish I could say that this was the only time I'd made this mistake...the bottles look alike.  Anyway, it added a decidedly different taste to the dish, but it was still very good.  I made my own polenta and wouldn't have wanted it any other way.  A keeper!

Very good!  I used XVOO, sautéed the onions & peppers, then added garlic and sliced sausages.  Served over pasta.  The Italian spices & balsamic were great!

I didn't care for this dish. I can't pinpoint why but mostly I believe it was lacking in flavor. It smelled great while cooking but the final product was just bland.

I ended up using fresh pork sausage I bought from the farmer's market. Just an extra step of draining off the fat, but wow this was good stuff.

Yeah....really enjoyed this one too....grilled the sausage, pepper, onion, zucchini and mushrooms and then cut into smaller pieces and added the balsamic and Italian seasoning. Delicious! Also did not use polenta since I had non on hand. This was healthy and very tasty this way. Thanks!  Ohhh...and I did find the al fresco Garlic Chicken Sausage....not a problem!
