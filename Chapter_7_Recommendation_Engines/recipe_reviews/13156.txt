This soup has outstanding flavor!  However, I wanted to cut down on the fat so I used a 14 oz. can of evaporated skim milk, a half cup of 1% and a half cup of half-and-half cream.  I also cut down the cheese to about a 1 1/4 cups.  It was absolutely delicious and I'll make it again.

I was looking for a soup for St. Pat's Day, something different.  I found this and thought I would try it.  I made it for my co-workers, threw it together the night before and took it to the office in the slow cooker for lunch.  As soon as they tasted it they couldn't believe how good it was.  Word spread fast around the office and 15 people asked me for the recipe.  The ONLY thing I changed was the half & half,  I used 1 small container of it and the rest was a combination of skim milk and whole milk.  A couple of people thought it was a bit salty so next time I would replace the bouillon with beef broth.   Otherwise this is an excellent soup worth trying.  5 + stars!!!!!!!!

I made this for a potluck at church and it was all gone.  I put it in a crock pot and served toasted rye bread and shredded swiss on the side.  Several people asked for the recipe.  All I added was a little lemon pepper which seemed to add that extra dimension of flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

I do NOT like sauerkraut but since my husband loves reuben sandwiches, I thought I'd give this a try.  Wow, was it ever good and so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly but rinsed the sauerkraut a little bit, and also used no-salt swiss, and 1/2 of the bouillon was no-salt.  Tasted perfect to us.  We loved it.  A keeper for sure!

I have to give this soup 5 stars. This was amazing. I added ground mustard, a dash of worceshire sauce and some caraway seeds. It was delicious and filing.

This was a popular soup at our annual library luncheon.  We added some caraway seeds and used bratwurst instead of corned beef.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!

i thought this was a great soup but i did do a couple of steps different. made the soup but instead of putting in the broiler i made croutons by cutting up rye bread in to bite size pieces brushing with lots of melted butter and sprinkling with salt. put in the oven for 15 mins on 350 or until crunchy. put those on top of soup and sprinkled with swiss cheeses then drizzled with thousand island dressing.

My wife says this is her new favorite soup off all time. Soups got game!!  One bowl is all you can eat though rich! I also would have a couple of small toasted pices off rye to soak up the bottom of the bowl! Dingo out!

I was very weary about trying out this recipe! But, boy am I glad I finally made it!  My husband and I loved it! 
Hint: We toasted the rye bread and cut it in pieces before dropping in the soup and then added a slice of swiss chees on top. YUM! very creamy

I didn't make as posted, I combined 2 different reuben soup recipes, but went more with this particular recipe.   I made the roux with the sauteed vegetables.  I then added 3 cans of beef broth, instead of using any water.   Put in saurkraut as indicated and also added about 2 TBSP of horshradish, some worcheshire sauce, and some caraway seeds. I used regular corned beef deli meat sliced into chunks. I mixed in 2 cups of swiss and approx 1/8 cup of 1000 island dressing.   I toasted cubed pieces of bread and sprinkled additional swiss on top after adding bread.

One of my favorite recipes! I love reuben sanwhiches but by the time I am done making them for the rest of the family, they are done eating and I am just getting mine made. This is a great compromise. The only addition I make is to add about 1 teaspoon of caraway seeds to spread the 'rye bread' flavor thru the soup.

Truly excellent cream style soup; definitely not for the fat/calorie conscious but awesome all the same.  My husband was pretty skeptical when I told him that I was making this but it is now one of his top 2 or 3 favorite soups. Instead of the toasted triangles, I cubed up some leftover rye bread, tossed with some butter and toasted the bread cubes in the oven.  The only other change I made was using another reviewers suggestion to cut the salt with beef broth instead of bullion (I am pretty salt sensitive). Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee and it was great. Also, use good corned beef; I used that canned stuff (like Spam) once and didn't like it nearly as much as with deli corned beef.  Leftovers would be best I think but the deli meat is good as well.  Thanks for posting this unusual recipe!

This soup is excellent if you like reubens!  I skipped the celery.  I also toasted slices of rye bread under broiler.  Toast one side flip and sprinkle swiss on them. Broil until cheese is melted. Cut with knife into smaller pieces and top it on the soup.

I actually made this soup on Friday for lunch.  I scaled the recipe to 2 servings and used a 1/2 of a left over reuben sandwich (from a resturant) and added the cheese & kraut that the recipe called for.  I didn't do the baked version, and it still turned out good, although the smell of it was less than desirable.  Thanks Holly.

Just got another request to make this soup. I use 4 cups of beef broth instead of water and bouillon. I also rinse the drained sauerkraut and chop before adding. Otherwise I follow the recipe. Love it.

very nice, hot filling soup.  made it with turkey meatballs as i didn't have corned beef:  took 1 lb. ground turkey, added an egg, s + p, and a LOT of caraway seeds....maybe 4 T.   formed turkey into little mini-meatballs and baked them at 350 for about 15 min.   followed instructions for first 5 ingredients, added 4 chicken bouillion cubes.  added a whole 14 oz. can of sauerkraut.  added 1 c. swiss cheese.  added about 1 1/2 c. half n half.  as another poster suggested, made pumpernickel croutons and melted swiss cheese over.  then we scooped the prepared croutons on top of our soup.  steaming hot.  yummy.  almost 5 stars, but i save that for some gourmet soup from Europe  :)    this was wonderful on a winter night!  will make again!

This is outstanding.  I left out the celery as a preference and, due to the other reviews, cut back by 1/3 on the butter, 1/2 of the half and half, and only put cheese on the top (not in the soup).  Since I made my corned beef in the crockpot the day before, I skimmed out the broth and used it instead of the bouillion.  I am SO glad that I scaled back on the dairy fat.  This was still ridiculously rich...and the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I absolutely would not have been able to stomach it without the changes.  I will not make this just for my immediate family again.  It is way too decadent to make it without a special occasion.  It absolutely rocked as an easy dish to throw together when my extended family comes to visit for the week, though.

I'm not a fan of ruebens but my husband is so I made this for him.  He loved the flavor, but wasn't crazy for the rye on top. (toasted the rye bread and it got soggy)  He would have rather have had a piece of toast.  I will definately make this for him again.  Thanks for sharing!

I LOVED this soup! I was a little hesitant. Though I love reuben sandwiches, the idea of sauerkraut in soup kind of grossed me out, but it was SO GOOD. It tasted just like a reuben sandwich. I made it as written, except I used celery salt instead of celery and I only used 2 T of butter, then just tossed a couple T of flour until it made a paste with the butter. Instead of all half and half, I used 1.5 cups of fat free half and half and a can of fat free evaporated milk. For the beef, I used left over corned beef from St. Pat's day. I can't wait to make it again!

I've had Reuben soup in a restaurant before, but this doesn't compare.  It tastes like sauerkraut and corned beef in a creamyish base.  Not worth the work and won't be making again.

This was fantastic!  I love reubens in sandwich form, but I had never thought of it as soup.  I used the leftover corned beef I made from St. Patty's Day and substituted half of the beef broth with broth from cooking the corned beef.  Also, to keep the fat content lower, I used fat free half and half.  It turned out so creamy and delicious!

I have used this recipe many times and it has become my husband's favorite. Anytime I make it, people usually look at me like I'm crazy, but once they try it, they LOVE it! If you like reuben sandwiches, you will melt over this recipe!  Thanks Holly for a new family favorite!

Delicious! Used 1 cup half and half, and milk for the rest to lower the fat. Will for sure make again.

Great recipe!  I love soup, even in the summer.  I didn't want to open a can of sauerkraut and had some coleslaw mix to use up, so sauteed that with the onion and celery.  I used chicken broth instead of beef and seasoned croutons on top.  It turned out great!

Great!!! I used a can of condensed skim milk instead of about 2 cups of the half and half, and only used 1 can of half and half. I also only used about 1/2 a cup of cheese IN the soup because I misread the recipe when I was grocery shopping.  It was still good with these small healthy changes! I also used a box of organic beef broth instead of the water and bullion. Next time I'll add some shredded hash brown potatoes and some more broth/water, because this was a very rich CHOWDER! and I like my soups a little soupy :)

I loved this soup, my family.. not so much. They said it too complicated being sweet, salty and tangy at the same time. Changes I made: I used a 14 oz can of beef stock, 2 cups of 1% milk and almost  1/2 lb of swiss cheese slices. Makes a nice thick filling soup, more than enough for 5 people.

My husband and I had lunch at a local place and they had Reuben soup.  As soon as I got home I visited allrecipes.com to see if I could find a recipe for it.  This is it!!

Awesome idea! I modified this a bit to use up all of my leftovers from corned beef & cabbage dinner. I saved the water from boiling the corned beef & veggies and used it in place of the water/bouillon; I added the carrots and potatoes (chopped); used milk instead of cream to reduce fat, and halved amts.; skipped the Swiss (don't like it); added ground mustard and celery seed. Tastes great and is a perfect alternative to yet another round of Reuben sandwiches or reheated C.B.&C. Thanks!

I hate to say this, but I was really disappointed with this recipe.  I was very much looking forward to the combination of reuben ingredients in a soup format, but found that the milk/cream eliminated all the taste of the sauerkraut and corned beef. The leftovers sat in the fridge untouched, and I don't think I will make this one again.

This recipe is great!  My husband was a little skeptical when I told him what was for dinner, but one taste and he was a believer.  I followed the advice of substituting beef broth for beef boullion, and replaced 1/2 cup of half and half with skim milk.  The recipe was still wonderfully rich and I'm sure it will become a family favorite!

This is a wonderful way to use up the extra corned beef after St. Patty’s Day. I’ve made it twice. The second time, I had cooked my corned beef in the Instant Pot. I used the liquid left in the Pot for the soup in place of the water and beef bouillon cubes. It is a little time consuming, so be sure to familiarize yourself with directions before you start so it’s ready when you are. ??

This was rich and creamy. I made it for a St. Patrick's Pot Luck. I didn't have corned beef so I used 2 cans if Corned Beef Hash.  BINGO! The potatoes in the hash added substance to the soup. Also used Fat Free half and half. So to add more creaminess I added a couple Tbs cream cheese. The rye toast is key to getting that Reuben flavor so don't skip the toast!

The soup felt like it needed something, so I added 1/3 of a bottle of light thousand island dressing.  NOW it tasted like a reuben. I also doubled the amount of broth and thickened it slightly.  Lastly, since I'm not a crouton person, I heated multigrain rolls in the oven to serve with butter on the side.  Definitely a filling soup and quite tasty.

This was delicicious. I did make changes because I did not have gluten free bread. Without bread, it was a little watery but still very good. Next time I will add a little rice.

Delicious soup. Only tweaks we made were that we halved the half & half, added more kraut and some caraway seeds. We would make it again.

I recently attended a soup party - we live in Michigan's Upper Peninsula thus our parties become quite indicative of the weather, nothing like a hot bowl of soup when it's 20 below zero - & I prepared this soup.  This soup was regarded as gourmet - hey I'll take that - and was a huge hit at the party.  I had baked marble rye bread in the oven after brushing on melted butter to both sides of each slice then tore these into larger sized croutons to use as a garnish with the Swiss cheese, delish!!!

Yummy!  I made as is except I didn't put the bread and cheese on top and broil.  I served warmed rye bread and butter on the side.  Still fabulous and I didn't have to worry if my bowls were broiler safe or not.  Will make again next time I have corned beef leftovers.

I thought this was awesome, but I like my soup with A LOT of stuff in it so I added more Corned Beef, and Saurkraut.  I think mine turned out better that what you can buy at a local deli...and cheaper!

Pretty tasty! My husband really enjoyed. I used my left over corned beef from St. Pat's Day...great soup for leftovers. I did add a couple tablespoons of dijon mustard.

i absolutely LOVE this recipe.  my old job made a reuben soup once a week and would never give me the recipe.  so i took matters into my own hands!!! this recipe matched the flavor almost exactly. i like to add a little more celery for the crunch and a little more kraut to make it a little more sour. i also eyeball the other ingredients to my desire.  highly recommended!!!!!!

This was just okay for me.  I am a huge rueben fan, so I was excited to try it, but I was a little disappointed.

What a wonderful soup!  I used suggestions from others regarding the beef broth.  I also added some dijon mustard ... hey, what's a Reuben sandwich without the mustard :-)

Very Good.  Probably one of the best soups I have made.  The only change I made was to use beef broth instead of water/cubes. Amazing!

I am the chef of a large hospital.  We tried this recipe on St. Patrick's day and all our customers and patients loved it! We had so many calls for the recipe, we had to upload it to our website.  I changed a few things in the recipe for the large volume we had to make, but this is one excellent soup!

I used to purchase a reuben soup but the maker discontinued making it.  I made this recipe hoping it would be the same.  It is not, its better.  Everybody that had some wanted the recipe.  I made a few changes.  I did not care for the celery so I left it out.  Also I added 1 more Tablespoon of butter so that the amount of fat was the same as the flour.  Then I cooked the butter, onion, flour mixture for a minute.

If you like rueben sandwiches you're gonna love this!  Not necessarily something for the kids, though.  My teenager didn't like it at all!

This soup went together in a flash and tasted fantastic.  You have to be saurkraut lover (we are) to really appreciate the 'bite' of the soup.  I used bratwurst like the other reviewer ~ just didn't like the idea of the texture of corned beef in soup.  YUM YUM!

This was a smash at my house.  We have no kids so I can't review that part for you, but this soup will be a tradition in our household the day after St. Patrick's Day from now on.  Wonderful flavor and so convenient.  I didn't boil it after I added the cream, only heated so it wouldn't curdle.  And, I didn't do the toasted bread bit, we were hungry and couldn't wait.  But, I highly recommend this recipe!
