This just wasn't for me. I'm trying to find ways to enjoy yogurt but this is not it. I think I just have to accept the fact that I'm not going to like yogurt again, which is a shame because it's quite good for you and I used to love it. Still gave this two stars as I was able to eat some so I'm sure it's me and not the recipe. Though I do think the amount of granola called for is nowhere near enough for four servings. Sorry but I won't be making this one again.
