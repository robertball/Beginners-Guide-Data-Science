Super dish! My potatoes did not cook as quickly as planned. Might be my slow cooker. Start early, because this gets better with age. Seasonings are perfect!

Delicious!  Everyone loved it! The only way we've ever eaten linguica is to wrap it in foil with potatoes and bake or grill...which is good, but not something you'd serve to guests or bring to a potluck.  You need to have one of the larger crockpots though.  oh, and I omitted the bacon and did not miss it at all.

Really good!  We all loved it!  As I filled my crock pot, there was no way all those zucchini and potatoes would fit.  So I used 2 zucchini and 4 small potatoes.  Because I live in an area with a large Basque population, linguica is easy to find, but until now, I'd only had it as a pizza topping.  Now I have something new to make.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was a wonderful comfort food.  I used Hot linguica which gave it a nice kick.  I also only used 1 pound of white potatoes.  The second time I made it, I added a can of hominy. The flavor was incredible. It was great with sourdough bread.  I wanted a little more sauce so I used 1 cup wine and three cans tomato sauce.  This recipe does taste better over time.  The second and third days later were even better.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Another time, I did not have zucchini so I added a can of corn and a can of green beans. Still added a cup of wine. Delish!

My family is Portugese and we have traditionally had linguica as a breakfast meat.  I made the stew for my father and his sister 2 weeks ago and then made it for my children last week.  I would make it every week if I had an easy access to linguica!  

I didnt use a slow cooker, but cooked it slowly on the stovetop.  It was YUMMY.  This is an excellent recipe that I will use time and time again!  Thank you so much!!

This dish is OK but nothing to write home about.  To add more flavor, I think it needs more garlic, and add generous tabasco.

I thought this was bland.  Too many potatoes.  The sausage was OK.  Nothing unusual

Excellent recipe!  I changed the zucchini to carrots and use 1 can of kitchen ready tomoatoes instead of sauce.  This way, there's lots of extra juice to soak up with a good bread!  A small shot of tabasco doesn't hurt either!

I have mixed views on this recipe.....being portuguese I grew up eating and making linguica. I liked the overall flavor but I think it needed more liquid...If I made it again I wouldnt do it in the slow cooker. I definetly want to give it another try but with some changes.

I really liked this recipe even tho i didnt think i would. I added an extra can of tomato sauce as someone else suggested and used red potatoes. I used the hot linguica which was too spicy for my husband but i LOVED! Next time ill use the mild or regular sausage so not to upset his tummy. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Everyone loved it. I have only made Linguica with egg and or pepper sandwiches. This was a nice dish and smelled as great as it tastes. I like to remove the skin from the Linguica as well as other types of sausages. Otherwise followed the directions and it was perfect. (I think different types of potatoes cook better in crockpots, try small white or red potatoes they cooked up fine in the amount of time stated.) Served with warm Portugese Bread. (I downsized the recipe to serve 8 and it came out great using a 4qt crock pot.)

I had to go to a local Mexican grocery store (there are not that many here in Virginia Beach, Virginia!!) to find the linguica. But I'm glad I pursued it; the linguica really made a difference. I think if I had given up and substituted it for regular sausage I would have missed out on all the wonderful flavor it add to the stew. The only change I made was less potatoe's; 3 lbs was a ton!! Plus I had to add 1 cup of water to make it stew like; otherwise it would have been more like a casserole.

My husband said 5 stars but I think only 4.  I added an extra onion & doubled the dried basil.  I also cooked it longer than suggested on low in the crock pot.

This was pretty good. It took about 3.5 hours to get the potatoes cooked all the way- next time I'll cut them smaller so they don't take so long.

Wow! This was so good! Can't figure out why some said was lacking in flavor because mine came out delicious! I took the skin off my sausage and eyeballed in the potatoes. Maybe about a pound. I used a half pound of bacon since there was only 3 slices left after I took the 6 slices out.  I didn't have zucchini so I chopped up some carrots, and fresh baby corn and sliced mushrooms since that is what I had. I followed the directions frying in batches. I fried the carrots with the onions and 3 cloves garlic. Then the sausage and then I also cooked the potatoes to give them a head start and added the mushrooms towards the end. Added all to crock with an extra 8 oz. can of sauce . I added 3/4 cup Merlot wine. Will use the zucchini also the next time. The more veggies the better for me. Cooked on low at first but then cranked it up on high until done and everyone raved how good it was. The baby corn stayed crisp and it was so good. Followed all the other ingredients. This is one of the best stews we have ever had!! It's a keeper!  Yummy!  Thanks for posting!

I made this in the Instant Pot last night since I didn’t have time to slow cook the recipe. I was out of bacon, but had some drippings in the fridge and used those to sauté the onions and garlic. I also threw in a can of red kidney beans. I cooked at pressure for 15 minutes and served it over rice. My husband says it was the best stew I’ve ever made and wants me to make it again!

My day got away from me. I intended to cook it in the crock pot, but didn't have time. I cooked it on the stove, letting it simmer for 45 minutes once all ingredients were in. My family LOVED it.  The changes I made were just because of what I had. 2 pounds of Yukon Gold potatoes, 2 medium zucchini, 3/4 cup of red wine (because that was the end of the bottle). It was a hit. They all agreed this was a keeper!

It was rather bland overall. I didn't care at all for the zucchini, which pretty much turned to mush. The second time I made it I added frozen corn and liked the texture much better than the zucchini.  I also added some Cajun seasoning  when sauteing the onions an garlic to pump up the flavor.
