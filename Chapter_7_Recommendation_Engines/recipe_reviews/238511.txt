Thanks Chef for this easy recipe!  I did not have tarragon or 8 hours to marinate and it was fabulous.  Even my 6 year old boy finished every bite!  I did use a meat thermometer to make sure the internal temp hit 130 degrees before removing from grill.  If I had to guess when these were done I would have ruined it as I was thinking they were ready way before they actually hit it.  I know we will be making this one again.

The overnight marinade resulted in a super tender lamb steak.  The vinaigrette made it special.  I did not use a charcoal grill, just sautéed in coconut oil six minutes one side and four and a half on the other.  Resulted in a medium done steak.

The grilling instructions were good.  But the marinade was flavorless even after leaving it in the refrigerator overnight.

I love honey, but was skeptical about the mint. Followed it to a tee and it was great! Easy and awesome!

I thought it was great.  I followed it faithfully, except for the honey.  I used far less.   I had some vinaigrette left over and used it for a salad.  Also very good.

Hi:)
I made the marinade as in the recipe. Even my teenage son said it smelled awesome (three times.) We live in China, so some of the ingredients are not exactly the same for the rest of the recipe. I served it on a Chinese garlic flatbread with torn pieces of romaine greens, and drizzled with a tad more sherry vinegarette. Very pleased. We’ve liked every recipe of Chef John! 
Thank you all!!

I used frozen steaks.  Maybe that's why the dish seemed a little off.

We loved this recipe. Marinated 12 hours and it turned out perfect.
