I had ground pork and chorizo on hand and did an AR search and this came up.  I did not have the canned luncheon meat.  My hubby and son liked this, but we all thought it was *really* salty.  I even used low-sodium soy sauce.  I cannot imagine how salty it would be with Spam (or similar) in it, too.  I didn't even add any salt (rarely do).  For leftovers, we nixed the sauce and used Heinz 57 for sauce.  It was much better.  So I'll make this again, but without the sauce.  Neither my son nor my husband could tell this had raisens (I used golden ones) and they loved the pickles in it!  I'll have to ask my Filipino neighbor how authentic this is.

It is much better to steam it, that's what we do at home. The meat holds the added ingredients better. What's more, we put cooled embutido logs in the freezer and if it's tile to eat it, we cut them into One inch slices and fry/bake them.
