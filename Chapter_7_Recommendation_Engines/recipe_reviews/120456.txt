I made all the appetizers for our Thanksgiving feast this year (6 different appetizers) and these were hovered over until gone (took about 15 mins for them to polish off approx 30 wraps). All who hovered asked for the recipe and was telling those who weren't hovering how good they were.  I did fry my bacon for about 3 mins on each side then set on paper towel lined plate and began to wrap immediatly. Just a note, I did notice some don't fry the bacon prior to wrapping so here is some tips to help decide if you want to cook your bacon prior or not. Bacon is just a great meat and it depends on how you like your textures. For a chewier bacon don't fry just wrap. For a light crisp with some chewy bacon, cook for approx 2-3 mins each side, just enough for the edges to crisp up then wrap. 4-5 mins each side for a crispy. Bacon continues to cook after it is pulled off the heat. The longer it cooks and the longer it sits after cooking the crispier the bacon will become. If it gets to crispy it will crumble when bent around chestnut or blacken as it cooks in oven. If you have a problem with the toothpicks browning, soak the toothpicks in water for about 5 mins prior to using but keep in mind this will make the toothpick more limp. Hope some of these tips help.

I have been making these for several years, and they are always a hit.  I wrap the chestnuts in uncooked bacon, and bake them for 45 minutes, drain the bacon fat that has been released, pour the sauce over the chestnuts, and bake for another 20 minutes.  Lots easier than having to cook the bacon first, and no worries about its being too crisp.

These are delicious.  I didn't pre cook the bacon first though.  Just wrapped the chestnuts in the raw bacon, cooked them on a high oven rack until the bacon was crisp then added the sauce and cooked an addition ten or so minutes. 
These went fast!!  They are sweet, but have a spicy bite to them and are totally addictive.  The host of the party wrapped up the 3 that were remaining and said she couldn't wait to have them to herself when everyone left.
Really, really good!!!
These would probably be really tasty using scallops as well.

Everyone loved them at my party! I slightly changed the bacon process by wrapping the chestnuts first and then putting them in the oven to crisp. Then I put them in the sauce and back in the oven. Turned out great!

This was great!  The best part is that you can prepare it ahead of time.  I kept the sauce mixture in a container and the waterchestnuts and bacon all set in a ziplock bag!  It's all about planning!

Loved it! Loved it! I got rave reviews! Several people asked me for the recipe!   To save some time in front of the stove...I baked the bacon a head of time. I put them in the oven at 400 degrees and waited until they started to crisp. It is nice to put all your bacon in the oven at once and you don't have to do anything else with it!

These are great, easy to make. I would definitely recommend "fancy" water chestnuts tho'.  One can I had wasn't, and had bacon left over.  Also agree with the reviewer who said she used a lesser amt. of chili sauce.  The first batch of sauce I made was with hot chili sauce (Asian) and was dynamite. It's a keeper tho!  Thanks for the recipe

These are very good. I did make 2 changes to the recipe. First I used precooked bacon because I had read another recipe in a magazine that said to use it. The other change I made because I have some picky eaters at the party I made these for so I just put the sauce on the side. I really wish I would have put the sauce on top and baked them like that but they were still great!

I gave this a bit of a different twist. Instead of using the sauce as described in the recipe because of allergies to eggs I used my favourite bbq sauce, which is a jack daniels honey bbq. I cooked the bacon first for 2-3 mins then poped the pan in the over with the bbq sauce over top. They were a huge hit and didn't last long!

I really like the crunch factor.  I was surprised that the water chestnuts were still so cruchy even after cooking them for so long.  I didn't precook the bacon.  I just poured the sauce over and cooked them for twice as long.  They were really good.  I halved the recipe because I was only serving 8 people and had a lot of other food and appetizers.  Wish I wouldn't have done that, they gotten eaten up way to fast!

These exceeded my expectations! My husband is begging me to make them again. I did not cook the bacon before hand. I wrapped the water chesnuts and baked them for about 15 minutes. I then turned on the broiler and broiled them for another 3-5 before pouring the sauce on and backing them for another 10. They were perfect. Crispy bacon, sweet and smoky flavor from the sauce. Delish!

Made these for the holidays, what a hit they were!  I did use precooked bacon just because it was on sale.  Didn't change anything else, except use the microwave instead of the oven to heat.  Full power for 20 seconds as the bacon was already cooked.

Made these with "Guilin Chili Sauce"...I live in China and there were a number of choices at the store.  It was not a sweet sauce, but rather had more of a kick to it.  I personally think I would try a different kind of chili sauce next time but since there is already brown sugar in the recipe I didn't want something too sweet.  Others really liked it though.  I also used fresh water chestnuts which were a pain to peel, but I cut them up into halves or thirds and cut the bacon in thirds.  Very good appetizer!

Wow! These are great. Like other reviewers, I wrapped the water chestnuts in bacon first. Then cooked then for about an hour. I then warmed the sauce up. Plated the wraps and drizzled the sauce over them. So simple but such a hit. I will be making these again.

I made this for New Year’s Eve on a whim, tired of making the same stuff all the time.  It sounded a little strange but the reviews were great so I thought I’d try it…the reviews were right.  They were all eaten and were the first thing to go!!  Everyone was asking me to make them for future get-togethers.  Because I didn’t have time to cook the bacon, and then wrap the water chestnut, AND THEN BAKE THEM…I just wrapped the chestnuts with raw bacon, and cooked them for about 12-15 minutes on a broiler pan, to let the fat drip down and make the bacon crispy, and then flipped them over, cooked for another 12-15 minutes.  It gave me time to run around and finish my last minute things.  When they were done, I stuck them in a small crock pot to keep them warm and drizzled the sauce over them.  They did not get soggy at all.  I did double the recipe, and if you do that; you do not need to double the sauce.  I had lots of left over sauce!  Thanks for such a great idea that was easy and delicious!!

great recipes. usually i make these with just a splash of teriyaki sauce on them the last 3 minutes of cooking but these were different. I liked that that the sauce mixture made a glaze on them. I didn't cook the bacon first, though and I used sliced chestnuts because thats what I had on hand. Also, i think the 2 cans was a bit much but maybe there are fewer whole chesnuts in a can. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us! It was a hit at my new years eve party last night.

This recipe sounds familiar to one we used to make to screaming reviews!! Try adding chicken to the chestnuts and marinate chick and chestnuts in a soy sauce,garlic, and honey sauce for as long as you can, up to a day.  After marinating, wrap with bacon and cook in oven or broil but watch!!  I suggest cooking in a 350 oven for 30 mins. (need to let chicken cook) and then broil for a few mins., watching during broil so they don't burn!!  We always served using toothpicks, but no sauce, although I'm sure that would be great, but might not even be necessary!! Try them, I'm sure you'll love them and so will everyone else!!!

I've made these over the past decade and no one ever seems to get tired of these tasty morsels! I usually have to make a double batch in order for me to get any.
They go well especially for the holidays

I have been making this for years.  I use BBQ sauce on them and I don't pre-cook the bacon.  These are a great hit at partys and we never have leftovers

Insane good.  For spicy ones, I replaced the Chili sauce with "Rooster Sauce"  spicy red chili sauce.  It added a bite that several people went crazy over.

I guess the men in our house are quite spoiled by having already had bacon wrapped shrimp.  These were not even a distant second, in their estimation.  *sigh*....

Great recipe.  I made a couple small changes.  I used 3 cans of water chestnuts per 1 package of bacon.  I also uses a tad more chili sauce and a dash of cayenne pepper in the sauce.  I took other reviewers advice and pre-cooked the bacon to get a slight crisp.  I also let the sauce sit in the fridge for a couple hours to let the flavors steep.

We make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. They're so good! Never any left overs, and guests even ask to take some home with them. Definitely a big holiday hit.

Love this recipe, it turns out great everytime!!  I don't use the mayo / chili sauce - instead I just use brown sugar and ketchup.  I like it that way, the sweet goes really well with the saltiness of the bacon.  Will be making this again and again.

Made these delicious waterchestnuts a few years ago the exact reciepe for  a bridal shower they were amazing . instead of cooking the bacon in a skillet we broiled them in  the oven watching constantly it was way easier to wrap the water chestnuts in them this way and they werent saturated in bacon fat it was so delicious  we made enough for around 8 pounds of bacon and they were all gone with in the first thirty minutes everyone loved them

I make this all the time and now my extended family has stolen the recipe and makes it all the time.  We love it.  The only change is to use 1/2 or 1/3 of the chili sauce; it still has punch, just makes it edible for even people who don't like it spicy.

First had these at a friends house watching the UFC fights and this was more exciting that that fight that night!! I love both water chestnuts and bacon, NEVER knew the two of them together w/ that sauce would be so amazing! Now i make this at all our parties! It's a HUGE hit during footballs season!

I have made this a couple of times and I LOVE it! The first time I made it, the bacon was too crispy and kept breaking as I tried to wrap it. Better the second time around. Will definitely make again.

Made these for a Christmas party a few years ago and substituted Rooster Sauce (i.e.  Sauce) and they were the hit of the party. So simple yet sooooo good. The best part was the girlfriend of a friend that people didn't really care for; well she  had one and burst into tears because "It was too hot for her,"  Unfortunately/Fortunately she wanted to leave immediately; after she left everyone had a good laugh at her expense.

My family and friends love this recipe! I find it alot easier to wrap the chesnuts in uncooked bacon, then pour sauce on top and put in the toaster oven. Works like a charm.

This is the PERFECT thing to make as a guest to a party. It is sooo easy and super yummy! I have brought these a few times to pot-luck style events and people just RAVE about them.
