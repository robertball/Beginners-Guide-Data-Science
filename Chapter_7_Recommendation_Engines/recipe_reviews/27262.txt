Yummy and so easy with store-bought pesto and pizza crust! I made this with thinly sliced chicken on top of the tomato layer.  I also rinsed & dried the tomato slices to remove the seeds so it wouldn't be too soggy.  Very tasty - and using sliced tomatoes makes such a nice contrast in textures.  A keeper!

A classic margharita pizza to me is pizza crust, garlic, tomato, fresh basil, and mozzarella cheese. I heat minced garlic in olive oil until the garlic is well infused.  Brush the garlic oil on a Boboli, top with thinly sliced tomatoes, torn fresh basil leaves, and sliced fresh mozzarella cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted.  Variations are limitless on toppings:  spinach, mushrooms, onions, broccoli.  Keep it heart healthy by staying away from the pepperoni, sausage, etc.

I first made this pizza for my vegetarian sister and her 2 year old son.  They loved it!  My husband, who is usually a meat eater, loves it too.  I usually use a homeade pizza crust and bake it a few minutes before adding the toppings.  Then I bake for about 10 minutes and it comes out great.  Definitely a keeper!

great pizza recipe.  we added bell pepper and onion to ours.  also we used hunts tomato sauce with basil, garlic, and oregano.  I know it is not supposed to have sauce, but we just needed something more.

Tastes good. You have to like pesto though. I used vegetarian mozzarella cheese instead, and it didn't melt like regular cheese, but it was still good. I added diced onions. Next time I will probably add different toppings, but I guess it's ingredients is what makes it a "Margherita Pizza".

Just shy of perfect. I added spinach which really gave it that extra something. I also sprinkled a little Romano and Parmesean cheese (I had some I needed to use). The only other improvement I can think of would be to make the pesto from scratch. Great recipe!

Needs something else...If I make this again I might use spinach under the cheese and tomatoes...and maybe a different cheese (Meunster).

This is really good. I used a pizza crust from a can and DiGiornoÂ® Pesto. For the simplicity of it, I'm thrilled that it tastes like the gourmet pizza place down the street.
