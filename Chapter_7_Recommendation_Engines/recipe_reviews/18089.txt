I wonder if the 5 cups of macaroni is a typo, I believe it should read "5 cups cooked macaroni."  That is the assumption I used when making this recipe, but still I ended up adding more mayo and some milk on the advice of another reviewer.  Also, I used some dill relish in place of the pickle (same thing, right?).

I wanted to try this recipe because it was different.  We found it to be very bland and dry.  After tasting, I added more mayonnaise, garlic salt, celery seed, and a few other spices.  After chilling it was dry again from the pasta soaking up the mayonnaise, ended up adding a little milk.

I tried this recipe for a 4th of July BBQ. I was not that thrilled about the raw egg so I left it out. It is good and easy, but it needs a little something extra. I ended up having to use an entire bottle of Mayo because it was so dry. I will make it again because it is easy but I plan on tweaking it a bit and adding some spices to it.

My mother-n-law is full German and just moved back to the us from Germany. This is just like her recipe. But she DOES NOT add raw egg. I think that was a misunderstading in your recipe.

When I make it, I add Cilantro and use miracle whip. And when I want to switch it up I use turkey. It's very good!

Being concerned about raw eggs I just used more mayonnaise instead of the egg for the dressing so I'm not sure my review counts. This is a good, basic macaroni salad the way I made it, though the pasta tends to soak up all the dressing and you then have to add more.

I altered the recipe and added green bell pepper a tablespoon of dried dill weed and some seasoning salt. As the other reviewers stated the salad is a bit dry but I like a drier mac salad versus a creamy one. Tasted and looked great!

Did not like this recipe at all. Very bland. Quick and easy yes, but no taste! I also found it very dry :(

Tastes good.  Followed the no raw egg thing and we added some cheese.

This recipe wasn't too dry for us, however it was a little bland. I'm trying to pinpoint exactly how it could've been better. There are sooooo many ways you can make macaroni salad. I did have to add a bit of salt, probably could've been jazzed up in other ways too!
