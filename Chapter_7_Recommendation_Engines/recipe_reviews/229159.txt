My two sons thought this was the best. idea. ever. My husband did, too, to be honest. What an unique and fun idea for gross food not just for Halloween but for boys who like to pretend to eat gross things.

This is creepy, weird, and gross! I guess, that makes it good for Halloween. The recipe says cranberries or cherries work. I had both, so I tried each one. The cherries tasted by far better, but the cranberries looked real. Only thing is, I can't imagine pressing an entire bowl of these! I did about 20 total and was done. I would take a pic, but quite frankly they just look pretty yucky!

I guess it is all about how you look at something and how it could be used. These really do look like scabs when smooshed out. My kids agreed. I could see these as a Halloween cupcake topper.
