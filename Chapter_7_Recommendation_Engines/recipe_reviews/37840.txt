I make smoothies almost everyday and therefore, always have ingrediants around. However, I have never used cool whip as a main ingrediant. This was awesome! This tasted like the best strawberry milkshake my family ever had. It was a little thick for my taste so I added apprx 1/4c milk but overall, the taste was great! Will make this many mornings to come!

From Monday to Wednesday, my youngest daughter takes ten dance classes and is an assistant teacher for an additional three classes for the little ones. (not to mention piano lessons and field hockey) By Wednesday evening, she's beat, so when we get home, I always try and give her a little "pick-me-up" treat. She really loved this and so did I!!

Wow, is this recipe the tops....so rich and creamy and low in calories and fat!  

So let's do the breakdown for all of you counting calories (recipe + 1 medium banana added):
1 cup (8 ounces) low-fat ice cream = 280 cal and 6 grams fat
2 1/2 cups (8 ounce container) Cool Whip Free = 375 calories and 0 grams fat
2 cups (1 pint) strawberries = 90 calories and 0 grams fat
1 banana = 105 calories and 1 gram fat
2 cups ice cubes = 0 calories and 0 grams fat (heehee)
Grand total for 4 servings is 850 calories and 7 grams fat; For 1 serving it is 212 calories and 1.75 g fat.  
This smoothie is super filling and can almost serve as a meal.  I highly recommend it as it is exremely delicious.  Make sure to add 1 sliced banana, because it really adds a nice flavor.  I like my smoothies rich and creamy so I did not add milk to thin it out.

Another delicious recipe from the Kraft folks! We enjoy this drink with mixed berry yogurt and frozen blackberries. Its verrryyy thick, so I usually add about 1/3 cup skim milk. The Coolwhip adds a very pleasant flavor to the berries. This is a keeper.

I'm not a smoothie person but my husband loved this recipe and was suprised by how well it turned out seeing that you use cool whip.  So, I'm giving it 5 stars for him!

This was very creamy, excellent smoothie. I used a banana for the fruit and had to add a little bit of milk because my blender was having trouble blending it because it was so thick. Definately a keeper!
