This was great!  My mom makes something similar, but asked for this recipe because she likes it better.  Her recipe uses dill and she sautes onions with the garlic. I added the onions to  this recipe and the only other thing a did different was to use canned petite diced tomatoes. My daughter kept walking by the frying pan and dipping french bread in the juices.  I didn't have any sticking problems like some others, but I used my electric frying pan so I could control the heat better.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was unbelievably simple, unbelievably good.  Gutsy flavour - my kind of food.  The best extra virgin olive oil is absolutely necessary here.  Although I could easily make a meal of this with salad and flat bread, I had extra kids in the house and so coupled it with Zucchini Patties and some pilaf.  Everyone ate everything!  Make sure you have plenty of good bread on the table to mop up the delicious juices.

Oh my gosh - this is one of the most sublime dishes I've ever had! Absolutely wonderful flavor. Once I put sun dried tomatoes in it but it didn't give it anymore oomph. The Kalamata olives and garlic are all the flavor it needs. Kids and husband wouldn't touch it but that just left more for me!!! Will make this until I die!

I found the flavours weren't that complex and I needed to bulk it out a bit with some vegetarian bouillon granules and also topped with some sprinkled feta cheese. However very easy and good for a quick midweek meal.

I thought this tasted really great...I had a problem with the potatoes sticking to the pan though, while cooking...not enough of a problem to prevent me from making this again though!

Fantastic! I can't believe the complexity of flavors in such a simple dish. Warning to those who don't know what kalamatas are - these are not like black olives from a can. They are extremely pungent, so if you don't like intense flavors, you may not like this dish. This is not a failure of the recipe, but your own preference, and you shouldn't rate the recipe down for it. I'm thrilled at having an exciting new potato recipe in my collection!

Perfect for a simple, hearty meal.  It's incredibly easy to make, and very satisfying, even for non-vegetarians. You can easily substitute garbanzo beans for the olives, adding them at the end of the cooking time. Pair it with a spinach and feta salad and you have a real winner!

This was really a fun and easy recipe! I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't oily~but had almost a creamy texture from the potatoes and tomatoes. My overly picky daughter didn't like it but everyone else in my family liked it...we sprinkled about a tablespoon of feta cheese on the top of it which brightened it up and gave it some zing.

Who knew that this would taste fabulous AND be so easy to make. The olives blend in perfectly, expect the potatoes to stick while cooking but this is all forgotten when you take your first bite.

Loved it.  The only change I made was to substitue 1.5 Tbs. of regular olive oil for lemon olive oil and to add a pinch of grated lemon peel.
Excellent recipe!  Will definitely be a regular entree at our house.  Thank you!

We have this once a week for dinner, served a little crumbled feta on top and pita and a salad on the side. We usually double the recipe, because my 8 year old usually has three servings. I use pitted kalamata olives from an olive bar, and it is not too salty. Do not microwave or precook the potatoes; the reason the potatoes are cooked in the tomatoes and kalamata olices is to give the potatoes flavor. I would hazard a guess that precooking the potatoes decreases their ability to absorb the flavors and may make the dish too salty. Thirty minutes is not too long too wait for this simple and delicious meal. It gives you just enough time to make a salad, heat the pita bread, and set the table.

My boyfriend said these are the best potatoes he's ever had!  They were soooo easy to make.  One thing to keep in mind though:  DOn't use the bottled kalamata olives because they're WAY too salty.  either get fresh ones from an olive bar or something or find a good brand.  that was the only complaint, but easy enough to fix!  Definitely recommended for a quick, easy, yummy meal

This is a first for me but I did not like this and I was bummed because I love all the ingredients.  I really like bold flavors and I felt like this recipe was bland.  I needed to have an olive in each bite to have any flavor.  Also the sauce was... Well there was none.  I even added water and by the end it was just mush.  Its too bad cause I was hoping to like it.

This is pretty tasty.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and microwaved the potatoes beforehand.  For those who think the kalamata olives are too salty, rinse them before you add them - most of the salt content is in the juice they are bottled in.

I make this a lot when I'm low on groceries, since I usually have all the ingredients on hand. I leave out the olives because I don't like them. I usually use canned diced tomatoes, and I have quite often added zuchinni to the mix! Very, very tasty.

An healthy side dish that tastes similar to what I've had in Greece. Next time I'll make it into a main by adding olives (I didn't use kalamata because I can't find them unpitted) and crumbled feta. Onions are a great addition too.

This recipe is a staple at our house.  My husband doesn't care for kalamata olives, but my daughter and I both LOVE this dish.  I make it often when my husband is working late.  I use canned diced tomatoes with no added salt (there is plenty in the olives) instead of the fresh chopped tomatoes.  It is very easy to make and is a great comfort food.

great recipe - at first i wasnt so sure because it looked so unappetizing but my sister loved it and she is THE hardest person to cook for.  i added onions and sauteed them for about 15 min in the olive oil (while i was cutting up the potatoes) i added an extra clove of garlic (although it was pureed, not minced) and i mashed up most of the potatoes.  my sister and brother-in-law fought over who got to take the rest for lunch tomorrow!!

I make this dish exactly as directed and love it. The consistency is perfect, just like thick stew should be. This dish really has great flavour. This is one of my comfort foods, served nice and hot with some crusty bread.

Very tasty... the flavor comes from the kalamata olives, so don't forget them.  When it came time to eat it, the olives themselves were a little strong flavored, but the potato base to this stew was excellent.  This is a great side-dish.

I was skeptical, but this is a fantastic stew. It has a hearty and unique flavor that is often lacking in vegetarian recipes. You have to try it!

This recipe was delicious! My whole family loves it.  I've added this recipe to the regular menu rotation.  It is very easy, and tasty. Note: if you use canned tomatoes in the winter time, add the juice too. Otherwise, it will be too dry.

I usually like most anything but this wasn't what I was expecting. Six adults tried it and nobody liked it much. There was a lot - most of it - leftover. It was too oily, and the flavors just didnt' seem to go together the way I thought they should. I am suprised by all the great reviews, so it may have been an error on my end. However, if I'm going to eat something that oily, it better be darn tasty to make the extra time at the gym worth it :-)

We really liked this a lot. The little salty bites of olives with the potatoes. So easy and so few ingredients. A keeper!

My mum's been making this for years and now that I've moved out I make it for my boyfriend and I. Always goes down a treat even though neither of us likes kalamata olives.

This is an amazing recipe!  I made it over a week ago and just forgot to rate...  but it's everything a good recipe should be-- simple, tasty, and quick to prepare.  I added a touch of anchovy paste as this was cooking, but I am really not sure that it needed it, just had some that needed to be used.  Hit it with a little feta crumbles before serving alongside sauteed lemon chicken and it was wonderful.  Leftovers were just as good, if not better after letting sit.  My husband practically licked the plate clean, and has requested this be a regular.  Make sure you use good kalamatas, as they are the predominant flavor in this.  Only had canned tomatoes in the house, but still fantastic, just drained one can.

This was excellent.  I made this for both of my parents and the loved it.  I followed this recipe exactly except I substituted the fresh tomatoes for canned San Maranzo tomatoes.  I also simmered it low for just over an hour.  The extra juice from the tomatoes turned into a thick sauce.  One of the best potato recipes ever and I will most certainly make this one again!  thanks

This hit the spot. I love Greek food and after recently becoming a vegetarian I was unsure of what EASY (moussaka and spanakopita need a bit more time commitment) mains I could prepare that do not involve meat. I only added in 1/4 cup of oil, I upped the tomatoes to two fresh cups,I chopped half a cup of olives and used half a cup whole olives, after adding in the initial oregano I sprinkled more on top, I added 4 cloves of garlic and squeezed about 1/2 a lemon in it. I let this simmer for an hour however, this was not done in 30 mins. The extra time made the sauce very nice and thick. Note I kept on adding in water and letting it cookout because my potatoes kept on sticking on the bottom, probably because I didn't put the 1/3 cup of oil in! The end product was excellent though, the water did make it more saucy /"stewy". I served it with greek salad, lemon pilaf and "yia yia's tzatziki sauce".

I really liked this a lot and would have rated it a 5 star except that my husband did not go crazy of it like I did. It was so simple and so tasty.  You really need to make sure you use the right olives because that is where all of the flavor comes from.

This was very good. Although if you start with raw potatoes it takes ALOT longer than 30mins. But I think that the raw potatoes obsorb alot of flavor because it does take long. I also had to use a whole 28oz can of tomatoes as the potatoes started to dry out and stick. Also doubled the garlic and added Feta cheese as suggested. Big plus! Kalamata olives a MUST, don't even bother with regular black olives as the flavor is not the same. After all that did'nt need to add any salt as we usually don't anyways to our food. Give it a shot but might need to play with it a bit.

This was very good!  I had to add a lot of salt and pepper at the end, as per my preference, but I was really pleased with the way it turned out.  It tasted a lot like tomatoes, with the salty hit of an olive every once and a while.  As a note for future chefs... don't forget to buy your olives without the pits.  I think I spent fifteen minutes de-pitting my kalamatas!

Very good.  My version was a bit bland, but I think that was because of:  I may have used too many potatoes (I don't have a scale), so the ratio may have been a bit off; and I didn't use kalamata olives (therefore the salt content was greatly reduced).  I used 3/4 c. of regular black olives and 3/4 c. of garbonzo beans.  And 2 small cans of diced tomatoes.  Given my alterations, I'd probably cut back on the potatoes, add a little salt and a little extra oregano.  PLUS, I only used 1/4 c. of olive oil.  I used a non-stick pan and had no problem at all.  I will make this again to fine tune it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Although it's nothing too special, my family really liked this recipe.  However, I'm unsure how it would turn out if following exactly as written.  To make it less thick, I used 1 can of organic Italian diced tomatoes AND 1 can of organic stewed tomatoes instead of fresh. Also used fresh oregano, double the garlic,a touch of onion, and a dash of crushed red pepper.  Sprinkle with feta and serve with a greek salad...yum!  Although it took about 20-25 minutes longer to simmer.  And using a potato masher on it before serving gives it a better texture in my opinion.

This stew was wonderful! It was even better the next day - totally yummy! I didn't have any kalamata olives, so I used "normal" black olives instead. Turned out great. I'm sure, though, that kalamata olives give this dish a special flavor, so I'm going to use them next time. I also used two cans of pizza tomatoes, instead of fresh ones (lazy me... ;)!

I microwaved red potatoes halfway, cubed them, and dropped into cold water. I rinsed twice to remove starch released by the knife and they did not stick much. I used fewer olives, cut into thirds and it was not salty at all.

This recipe was very disappointing.  I deliberately searched for Kalamata olives in the store and they ended up making the dish too salty.  After one bite, it left a bitter aftertaste and no one in my family would eat it (including me).

Very tasty way to use olives!  Incredibly simple.  I peeled and microwaved my potatoes [cut in half] for about 10 minutes and didn't have any problems with them sticking to the pan.
Careful not to use salty olives...

Maybe I did something wrong, but this came out very dry and not at all stew-like for me. I still tasted great and we ate it all up, but I would hesitate to call it stew. Maybe next time I need to add some water for the simmering part.

This is a very good basic recipe.  I couldn't help myself, tho' and added a splash of olive oil
and sprinkled on some Feta cheese before digging in!  It's really tasty!

So sadly, I didn't have any kalamata olives on hand. So in order to replace the "tang" I added lemon juice instead. Not the same I know, but WOW! This was fantastic! My potatoes had to simmer longer than 30 minutes, more like 45 minutes, because I threw them in raw. I also added some condensed chicken stock for extra flavor. Otherwise, fantastic recipe! I can't wait to make it next time with the olives!

This was a great recipe - it would still be great with a little less olive oil, it was a little on the heavy side there - but the flavor is outstanding. Will make it again, definitely!

I LOVE this recipe. I found it on this site a few years ago and it is a favorite at my house. My husband and son don't like kalamata olives, so they just eat around them.  BUT, the flavor of the olives is what makes this dish stand out, so don't leave out the olives if you have someone who doesn't like them. I'm guessing they will still love the flavor of this dish!

Simple and delicious.  I doubled the amount of garlic.  Next time I will add a bit more tomatoes and olives.  This recipe makes a lot, so I will also cut it in half.

LOVE this!  Only thing I changed was to use a can of diced tomatoes, juice and all, hoping for more to dip bread in.  Even with the extra liquid, there really wasn't that much to sop up.  But what was there was yummy!!!  Definitely need kalamata olives and not just whatever you normally have on hand.  This is my new favorite way to make potatoes, and I plan to make it again and again!

This was fantastic!  I made it as described with maybe a little less olive oil and the result was a very satisfying and flavorful vegetarian dish. Garden fresh tomatoes, potatoes and oregano were a plus but I think this will be a cold weather staple at our house with canned tomatoes and dried oregano.

Delicious! A simple recipe with a nice Greek flavor. I highly recommend this as a side dish w/ Chicken Dish.

We made this to go with some Hawaiian chicken and grilled corn on the cob and this is by far the tastiest potato dish we've ever had.  We didn't even need to add any salt or pepper to it - perfect just the way the recipe states!

My parents and I really love this stew. My mother lived in Greece before she had me so anything I make at home that reminds her of those days, she instantly loves. I found that I cooked the stew a bit too long because the potatoes fell a part a bit and it sort of turned into a chowder almost, but it was still good. Next time, I will be sure to watch it closer and I am sure it will be perfect!

The best and easiest potato dish!  I used fresh oregano.  Just grab a bunch and throw in there.  I added more garlic and pureed with olive oil.  I also pureed 1/3 of a can of tomatoes and added another 1/3 can of it.  Just a pinch of salt and that's it.  Very yummy.

This was far tastier than the simple ingredients would indicate. I only had sliced kalamatas, so used about 1 1/4 c.of those and a 28 oz can of herbs and spices diced tomatoes. I also reduced the oil to 1/4 c.  My husband rated this a 9 out of  10, which is extra great considering how easy this recipe is! I served it with hummus, pita and a green salad with feta, red pepper and pine nuts.

We loved this!  So much flavor.  Definitely use kalamata olives instead of regular black olives.  We used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh ones.  Easy to make and delicious.  Oh, and don't forget the feta...it really adds the zing to the dish.

This isn't something I make often, but when I get a craving it's perfect. I leave out the olive oil, but I have to becareful that it doesn't stick to the bottom. I add some crumbled feta cheese when it cools and it's great. Nobody else in my house likes it, but they don't like Greek food in general.

This dish has terrific flavors and is easy to make.  I used a small can of stewed tomatoes and sprinkled 
feta cheese on before serving. Dee-lish!

Not bad at all, I used "normal" olives, and didn't add salt. We ate it in pita bread with hummus.

Great flavour and texture although it looks a bit odd. Next time I make this I will have to cut the recipe in half as it is a lot of food.

This was tasty but it took too long to cook the potatoes.  I recommend boiling them halfway or microwaving to cut down cooking time.  Pretty good otherwise.

I added more kalamatas (I'm a freak about them), the juice and zest of one lemon, more oregano, and feta crumbles at the end.  It was sublime!!  I don't know what these "too salty" people are talking about?!?!?  :)

I was vegan for a couple years and this recipe was one of my weekly standards.  The only change I made was  instead of using only  one type of potatoes, I used russet, red potatoes, carrots, and sometimes turnips.  I liked the subtle variation in textures this created.

I sautéed a chopped onion in when the potatoes were half done.  I also cut the olives in half.  It was delicious and even better on the second day.

This was a flavourful and easy side dish.  I used a  bag of baby potatoes for extra ease of preparation.  It was good just the way it was but definitely one could add extra ingredients to make it fancier.  I did crumble some feta cheese on it, and next time I think some minced flat leaf parsley would add a nice bright note.  My son was not crazy about the Kalamata olives; I had also thrown in some sliced green olives, and next time I'll just use those.

This is a very good vegetarian potato dish that is interesting and also relatively healthy. I found the amount of oil to be way too much as I was frying the potatoes but I was worried they would stick if I used less, so after frying the potatoes for a few minutes  in the suggested amount of oil I moved them to a pot (did not have a good lid for the pan) and then used that pan with the oil later to fry zucchini patties (totally agree with others, a nice combination with the potatoes).  I used yukon gold potatoes which I had cut into dice of about three quarter inch length (2 cm) and cooked them for close to 40 min. to get them to be soft, it did not turn into mush. I quartered the Kalamata olives which helped spread the flavor of the olives to the potatoes more evenly. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. While the potatoes were cooking on low I added small amounts of water to the pot, just enough so it would not stick, probably around half a cup.  My family liked it a lot.

We loved this. It's very similiar to the potatoes you get at a Greek Restaurant and this is what I was looking for. I made it exactly as written but at the end added the juice of one lemon just to give it a bit of zing. Excellent, thank you!

A divine accompaniment to a lean chicken dish, or great on a bed of warm quinoa/rice. Fingerlings were available (which made prep a breeze), along with fresh oregano. I agree with most other reviewers that the broth is great for dipping. Hence, add a loaf of rustic bread or grab a loaf of French bread at the check-out line. (Just so you can dunk your bread in all the juices).  Once plated, I did serve with a bowl of fresh sliced lemons. A little hint of citrus was a nice touch.

I have been making this authentic Greek recipe for 10 years. It is really great - my whole family loves it and we have made it for our extended families as well. It is always a favorite. I use one 15 1/2 ounce can of tomatoes and a sprig of rosemary instead of oregano. It seems to take closer to 40 minutes for our potatoes to cooks so plan ahead.  You can certainly make it with less olive oil, but it won't be nearly as delicious or authentic.
