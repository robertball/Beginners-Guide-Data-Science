Don't have a quick pot, so I roasted in oven.  Potatoes were done seperately with herbs and oil.

I used a cut up chicken. All the pieces were juicy and well flavored. I will make this recipe again.

Tasty dish!  Tweaked the cooking process due to a glass cooktop and an oven that was out of commission. What else does a guy have to cook with? A gas grill! Used chicken breasts instead. Put the chicken in a iron skillet and a bit of chicken broth to brown each side, then added the potatoes and herbs/lemon mixture. Low heat for about half an hour. Turned out great with plenty of leftovers.  Will be using this while camping in the summer/fall season. Two thumbs up!
