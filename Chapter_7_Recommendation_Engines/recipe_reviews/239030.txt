This is one delicious cookie.  I have made these for Christmas for many years.  They are absolutely my family's favorite.  Even though they are not baked, they are a bit labor intensive as rolling into balls and coating with coconut, and then I bag each cookie individually and tie with a ribbon.  Worth it.  My coworkers loved them too.  I suggest having two bags of coconut as you might need extra for rolling in.

If you are looking for the cookie that will stand above the rest, this is definitely it!  The only thing I did differently was that I used candied cherries and chopped them finely. ONLY because I had run out of maraschino cherries! Today I have to make more since they got eaten up immediately!!  Thanks for sharing.
