I have always loved savory dishes featuring sweet potatoes.  Roasting them brings out the natural sweetness and flavor which is enhanced with the thyme and garlic.  I could make a meal of just this fish.  Thank you, hhsandy!

I LOVED this recipe and will make it again, again and AGAIN! It was sweet and savory with a hint of heat. I didn't follow the recipe exactly (as I hate measuring). Instead, I cubed one large sweet potato (which was just enough for my husband and me), tossed in some olive oil, heaping tbsp. of jarred roasted minced garlic, pinch of salt, couple of shakes of red pepper flakes and didn't have any fresh thyme on hand so just substituted it for ground thyme. IT WAS AH-MAZING! I cooked it at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes.

Love this recipe and how it makes the potatoes' flavor savory instead of sweet. A great option to make the sweet potato.   more versatileI.  I cut the potatoes into chunks as another reviewer suggested and they were done in about 25 minutes. Definitely will make this again.

I made this and it was awesome. Never had a sweet potato that didn’t add extra sweetness. I loved it and my parents and son did also. My husband doesn’t like sweet potatoes and this recipe did not change his mind any, I give it all stars anyway. Didn’t change a thing.

the garlic and thyme combo was delicious, but I really wasn't expecting it to be so filling! I had 8 ready for a side dish for 3 people, and we couldn't finish it! It was really delicious though, I will definitely make this amazing recipe again!

Not a fan of the sweet type of sweet potato dishes. So, this was right up my alley! Husband loved it as well. The only change I made was using dried crushed thyme, preserved from last summer's herb plantings. Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe.

After we made this we tried this with rosemary and garlic instead of the thyme (because we had a surplus of rosemary and no thyme)  and it was amazing!

These were delectable! The slightly sweet of the potatoes the savory flavor of the thyme and the hint of hot from the red pepper were a perfect combination! Will definitely be making these again!

I made it with fresh rosemary.  Very flavorful.  And I love garlic so I used 5 cloves with only 3 medium potatoes.

I didn't have thyme so I used parsley. I would recommend flipping them half way through cooking so they don't burn.

These were very tasty.  I will definitely make these again.  
I did have a problem with baking time as at the 35 minute mark, I smelled burning.  Oops!  I am at high altitude so this may have been the reason (?) so next time I will bake at 30 minutes instead of 40 minutes or just adjust the temperature.  Even with the blackened bottoms (my family forgave that) we all liked the way they tasted.

I cubed the sweet potatoes instead of cutting into rounds.  These were a BIG hit at Thanksgiving.  These potatoes will definitely be served regularly at my house.

I omitted the garlic and added chopped fresh rosemary (equal to the portion of thyme).  It was delicious!  Roasting vegetables can be tricky, either it takes too long (at lower temperatures), or they have to be turned every 10-15 minutes to prevent burning.  I will follow these directions for roasting my root vegetable melange (parsnips, carrots, shallots, beets and sweet potatoes) for Thanksgiving this year!

So easy and delicious!  That sweet and savory business is wonderful.  I cubed and didn't measure, like another reviewer, and ended up cooking a bit longer... until the fork slipped in easily.  Will definitely make again!

Made it as written except used dried crushed thyme since I had no fresh.  Really good and super easy.  If you cut them thin you can reduce the baking time .  Liked the crispy outside edges.
