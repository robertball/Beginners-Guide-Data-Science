This is a good soup. I am vegetarian, so I omitted the hot dogs and used veggie broth. I also added a potato to thicken a bit. After simmering for an hour, I had to add probably close to 2 additional cups of water to make it a soup. I pureed 2 ladles full of the soup in the blender and mixed it back into the soup for some creaminess in the texture. The soup is thick and hearty and nutritious, great for a cold day. Some fresh, warm bread and a green salad makes it an easy meal. Next time I may experiment with some spices, because although it was good, I felt maybe it needed a little kick or a subtle spice in the background. But all in all a god recipe. It makes a lot of soup and it's very economical, so it was great to make on a Sunday for lunch at work during the week.

This was great!  I added a cup of frozen corn once it was simmering.  I also added some parsley flakes for color and flavor.  I didn't have celery, so I used an extra carrot.  Everyone really liked it.  I would definitely make it again!

I, personally, never liked adding hot dogs to my split pea soup (yellow or green), but my cousin has 2 young granddaughters (grade school age) and a husband who can't get enough of her pea soup whenever she adds them. She boils the franks separately, grinds them up a bit in her mini-chopper, distributes  them into separate soup bowls and pours the soup over them. The kids feel like they're "diving" for their hot dogs and their bowls are empty in minutes.

My husband loved this soup...something about the hot dogs that magically makes split pea soup more appealing! This is the first time that all of my split pea soup leftovers got eaten. Guess that means I have to make it again.

Really good soup - if you omit the hot dogs... Maybe will add some spicy sausage next time.

This soup is wonderful!  I did need to add 2 more cups of chicken stock and I also blended 4 cups to make it creamy as well as chunky, I didn't have mace spice so I used a pinch of nutmeg and it worked out perfectly.  I did not add the frankfurters-I agree for a full meal that a sausage of some sort would be great as well.  I only gave 4 stars due to some changes to the recipe.

This was an awesome soup. After i softened the vegetables i threw them into a crockpot along with the split peas. I tossed the franks in about three hours before it was time to be served... Warms you up, through and through. Excellent.

Thanks for the recipe. I loved the soup. I had about one cup of lentils, so I used that and only used 4 cups of chicken broth. I used the same amount of veggies that the recipe called for and I pureed them. I didn't have mace, so I used a pinch of nutmeg instead. I also threw in a bay leaf, some tony chachere's seasoning, salt,pepper, and garlic. I used boars head franfurters and put it all in a crock pot. My husband thought it was ok (but he's tough to please) and my daughter fished out the frankfurters and ate them. I ate 2 bowls and have been eating leftovers for lunch. I think it's super good!

Not bad. Definitely needs something more for my taste buds in the way of flavor. Didn't really like the frankfurters, I used turkey. I am thinking next time I will get a ham hock or two and make a nice broth from those, then add in the other ingredients. I used two carrots and I think next time I will use a little less peas (2 cups), add 2 cups of V8 and add some more spices (like parsley and perhaps some Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt). Overall my kids and Hubby really liked it and ate it up. Thank you for the recipe :).

The soup minus the hot dogs is just delicious!  Next time I will use her suggestion of ham instead, and add it earlier to give the flavor time to mesh, as I think that would go a lot better than the hot dogs did.

I loved this soup-so simple to make but with great pure, depth of flavor.  I don't normally put hot dogs in my split pea but tried it this time with Boar's Head franks.  I didn't think they added anything special to the soup so next time will leave out and just serve with croutons on top and a side salad.

Made as written but with cut up hot sausage.    Delish. Would have been good with hot dogs but I had none.  Ate with hard crust garlic bread.

Excellent soup!  I tried it with the ham and added potato.  When it is 0 out, this soup will warm the bones.
