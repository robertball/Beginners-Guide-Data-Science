I would use just 1/2 cup (one stick) of salted butter in this recipe.  
Hint:  make a double broiler by filling one medium saucepan 1/2 full of water.  Place a *slightly* smaller saucepan on top.  Boil water on high or and reduce to medium when water comes to a boil.  To make this a less-messy project: Open your bag of marshmallows and place them in a bowl to the right of the dbl-broiler. Place your krispies in a large bowl to the left of the broiler. Place your wax sheet to the left of the krispies, and pick the marshmallows up with a fork, dip in sauce, then roll the caramel around the marshmallow to drip off the excess, roll in krispies, and with your pointer finger, push the marshmallow off of the fork from the bottom. let it cool on the sheet then re-arrange them on a platter once they have cooled. Enjoy!

These were great!  I took the advice of some previous reviews.  I used the tooth pick idea, which worked great. And I just used about a third stick of margaring and a half can of sweetend condensed milk.  I think if you omitted the margaring and the milk completely the caramel alone would be to thick.  Also, next time I make these I will definitly freeze the marshmallows for an hour first.  They melt quickly in the hot caramel mixture. yummy!

I have made these for 6 years in a row now at Christmas time.  Some variations I have tried as there is so much carmel left, I roll the marshallows dipped in carmel in nuts (any kind) these are a delightful variation.  This carmel is great for apple dip also.  I have freezed this before and it keeps for about 2 months, careful when reheating as it scorches so very easily.

I made these for a treat at a big family dinner.  They disappeared!  I used tongs to dip the marshmallows in the caramel and it wasn't messy at all.  I fill a large bowl with the rice krispies, then I just drop the marshmallows into it, about 4 or 5 at a time, then I cover them and let them sit a minute. I've made these a few times, very easy, quick, and not messy.

These were good right after I made them, but within an hour or so the rice crispies were soggy. Didn't care too much for them then! Definitely for a sweet tooth as is!

Not bad.  I had only half the marshmallows, and half the caramels.. (thanks to husband and son!) but halved was enough to satisfy us.  These are VERY sweet.WOW.  But really easy and gooey to make.  Nice to make in hot weather.. the only thing on was my stove.. for a few minutes... thanks!

Yum! Always had these at Christmas growing up.  They are better made with Mackintosh toffee (3 bars) and it should be 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup condensed milk for that amount. They taste even better straight from the freezer!

These are delicious! My mom has made them since I was a kid, but used Mackintosh toffee which has a nut warning. Was glad to find this recipe since my son is allergic and Kraft caramels are nut free. Did not notice a taste or texture difference at all. Tried to leave out the margarine as suggested by others but it set up too quickly and was hard to roll the marshmallows in so I added it. Fussy little treats to make but worth it! Used holiday rice krispies for a festive touch.

Very yummy recipe.  This was pretty easy to do, but I had to get into the groove.  The first few made a mess, but then I decided to do the toothpick idea and that worked out well!  All I had was Rice Chex, so I put some in a big baggie and mashed them up a bit and dipped the coated marshmellows in that.  Oh boy were they delicious!  I also dipped some in chopped pecans.  I think next time I'll throw some toasted coconut into my Chex.  I also froze the marshmallows to make the dipping easier.  After dipping ALOT, I decided to throw the remainder of the marshmallows into the caramel, stir, and add a bunch of the Chex cereal I hadn't crushed up.  Just like rice crispy treats, I stirred this all up and pressed into a buttered pan.  These are a big hit too!

I've made this every year for the past 3 years and it's always a hit.  I bought some cute toothpicks to dip them into the caramel sauce with; that way you don't have to get the marshmallow off the fork.

My mother-in-law hires a lady every Christmas to make her Christmas 'cookies'. I have been looking for this exact recipe for forever (since the lady wont give it to me!) Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe. Its some work but worth it. You make enough caramel to use almost 2 bags of marshmallows. These also freeze well. Thanks again for a wonderful recipe!

this are incredible.  A friend of mine has the same recipe and I made them last year!  they are pretty sweet but if you put the marshmallow on a lollipop stick and wrap them in cellophane they make a great class party gift for the kids in the schools.  I do however use two bars of mcintosh toffee and not the wrapped caramels.  It just seems to have a better taste to them.

These were a big hit at my house. I let 4 and 6 year olds do the dipping and they really enjoyed it. They made a HUGE mess but afterwards they argued over who got to clean it up. A good way to keep kids occcupied. I had lots of caramel mixture leftover after running out of marshmallows.

I love these, so fun to make with the family!  We only used about half the caramel sauce, so I saved the extra and used it as a fun fondue the next night!  Delicious!

I did use real butter, not margarine. They are a little messy to make, but so worth the effort! Really sweet, but so tasty. My mom used to make these when I was little, and never had the recipe until now. Thanks so much!!

I was worried that these would be a pain to make (and clean up after), but they were surprisingly easy and not messy.  I used the assembly line method.  I used the toasted coconut marshmallows and cut them in half.  It looked like they were too small, but the caramel and rice crispies add a lot - they still turned out being only slightly smaller than a golf ball.  I kept the marshmallows in the freezer, pulling them out in batches because they thawed fast.

I was so tired of cookies that this was a great recipe to stumble upon.  I used real butter and mixed rice crispy cereal (1/2 chocolate and 1/2 regular).  I also did the assembly line right at the stove and kept the butter, caramel, milk mixture on a low warm while I worked on a double batch.  We used metal meat kabob sticks and they were the perfect length for easy dipping and rolling.  The kids loved helping with this one.

I made these last night because my friend had made them for Christmas and I loved them.  Her recipe was a little different.  She doesn't add butter and to tell you the truth, I couldn't tell the difference.  I stopped buying margarine years ago.  It's all chemicals.  My friend cuts her marshmallows in 1/2 and freezes them for about 1/2 hr so it's easier to dip them.  I found using the whole marshmallow makes them too huge so I did cut them with kitchen scissors and used skewers to dip them.  Next time, I may leave out the butter.  They are time consuming though unless you have people helping you.  I'm not sure who can do them in 20 minutes.  After doing 2 trays, I gave up, threw a few marshmallows in the caramel, melted them, threw in some krispies and pressed them in a pan for a big krispie treat.  My husband got a good chuckle out of that.  I'm tempted to try that toasted coconut idea.  Sounds yummy!  Eat up!  The diet starts tomorrow!  Happy New Year!

My Grandmother made these for years every Christmas and it was a family favorite.  She called them "Haystacks" though.  
While it certainly can be messy, there are tricks which other reviewers have offered which work well.  
I've used skewers, toothpics and the tongs and they've all worked relatively well.  The outcome is what everyone enjoys the most.. 
I don't think the sticky process of making them takes away from the popularity and quality of these treats.

These were awesome!!  Fabulous for S'mores!  I used the tip from a previous reviewer, and froze the marshmallows before dipping.  I admit, I rolled them in Cocoa Krispies because I'm a chocoholic.  I bet these would be good for a kids' party with something colorful like Fruity Pebbles...  Next time I plan to try toasted coconut.  Yum!!

These were really great! I thought they might be a little sweet, but they came out perfect. My girlfriend used them at her daughters school when it was her birthday. It turned out to be better than cupcakes. All the kids loved them. She just used mini bamboo skewers so each child had their own and it wasn't so messy.

It's not quite as easy as it sounds (it's kinda messy), but the final result tastes pretty good.

These are so delicious and addictive they are dangerous!  The caramel is awesome and would be good as an ice cream topping if you thinned it with a little milk or cream.

I thought these were really good.  I agree that dipping the marshmallows got a little tiring, maybe I wasn't motivated.  I only did about half a package, but everyone loved them.

I had some doubts about the taste in the begining, but it turned out very good.  Easy to make, too.  I made them with a class of preschoolers and they loved it!  We did use a toothpick in each one to dip with, as suggested elsewhere.  Excellent!!

Great recipe, and not too bad to prepare if you're organized.  While the caramels and condensed milk were melting (I omitted the butter), I poked each marshmallow onto a toothpick.  I agree with a previous review that suggested cutting them in half.  The toothpicks were handy for dipping in the caramels and crispies, and for eating them later.  I might omit the condensed milk next time and just use the caramels by themselves, as they were very sweet.

YUM! Who knew marshmallows could taste so good! Better than regular crispy bars.  These have a creamy carmel flavor.  As for the mess, other than some loose cereal, everything went into the dish washer and was easy to clean up after.  Kids had a ball rolling the carmeled marshmallows around in the cereal.  I took these to bible study last night and they were a hit.  People who did not care for marshmallows had seconds and thirds.  The recipe makes A LOT and so I packaged them two to a small snack ziplock bag and sent them to school in the kids lunches.  Thanks for the recipe.  But we will not be just making these at Christmas, this will be an all year threat in our house!

Like inside-out krispy treats.  Great result...made tons of caramel sauce, more than needed to coat marshmallows...used over ice cream that night.  All were devoured.  Even those who aren't crazy about marshmallows liked them!

These tasted very similar to regualar rice krispie bars.  These were very messy to make and took awhile to make them.  They tasted good, but I think I will stick to regular rice krispie bars in the future!

These are fun and really good.  Fairly easy for the kids to make however they have to be careful not to burn themselves on the pan.

Fruger, thank you.  I didn't have to freeze marshmallows. I made 2 10 ounce bags. With enough carmel mixture left to add to the left over rice cereal. The boys took care of that part!
I made this exactly as you submitted.  I thought the tongs worked very well. Hardly any mess to it. Just what my packages needed!!

These are good, except they were kind of messy when I was making them. I'll try again. Also, had to reheat the caramel mixture, because it was starting to get hard to dip the marshmallows. Maybe I was just slow at dipping. :)

These are fabulous!  This is the first time I made them, next time, I will cut the marshmallows in half as they are quite large when rolled in rice cereal - I will also try partially freezing them.  Rolling in nuts & maybe toasted coconut!  Easy, I used 2 wood scewers and it was simple!

These are very much like Rice Crispy Treats in taste but much messier to make. The taste is good but if you have small children or are not in the mood for a meesy clean-up I would stick with regular rice crispy treats. I have a six year old and I'm still trying to find all the rice bits he got everywhere...lol. Thanks for the recipe.

I had a hell of time making this recipe.  Although this recipe was tasty, the resulted mess farly outweighs the tastfulness.  The recipe itself is simple but make sure to have a vaccum around because you will surely need it. :)

I would give these 5 stars if they were not so messy and time consuming to make. It begun to get a little tedious dipping each marshmellow in caramel and cereal. These would be a lot more fun (and messier!) to make with children, but it was still fun to watch my nieces enjoy eating them.

This recipe was excellent! My family loved them! I used the mini bamboo screwers and it wasn't messy AT ALL! I also rolled half of them in toasted coconut, my hubby and his mom LOVE coconut and they really enjoyed this varriation. Highly recommended recipe!

I did about half the marshmallows and thought - there must be an easier way to do this, I was making a huge mess (but my dogs were happy...) so I cut up the marshmallows, put them in the bottom of a square pan, mixed the caramel & cereal together and poured it over top.  So they were square and not round - they still tasted yummy!

These are messy to make but worth it!! I love to freeze them and eat them cold. So simple so divine.
