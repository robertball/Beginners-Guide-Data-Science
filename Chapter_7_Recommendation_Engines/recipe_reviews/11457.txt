I wanted to use this for my Chocolate Gingerbread cut-out cookies.  However, the icing was setting up too fast and forming a crust.  So to adjust it for cookies, I added 3/4 cup more powdered sugar, 1 Tb more milk, and 1/2 Tb butter.  I was then able to frost all my cookies perfectly well and sprinkled them with clear sparking sugar crystals (please note, the icing gets harder as the chocolate in it cools).

this is a great icing for frosting sugar cookies.  It dries very quickly.  I would not suggest using this for a cake or cupcakes, as it would be too hard to spread such a large amt. of it.  I loved the flavor as well.  Used Ghiradelli unsweetened chocolate blocks.  Perfect amt. of chocolate.  thanks for the easy recipe.

the icing came out okay, a little plastic in appearance, and it sets a little too fast. I decided to add 30ml of cream and used a double boiler. the cream was used to smoothen out the graininess from the sugar and to increase fat content to delay setting and increase pourability

This simple and tasty icing is excellent for cookies.  It did set up quickly so I just added a bit of milk as I went along.

I must have done something wrong, because this didn't work for me at all. The chocolate wouldn't mix with the sugar, even using a mixer.

Tastes good, but unfortunately too difficult to work with.  Sets up way too quickly.

Very good. I followed STARFLOWER's review on this recipe except I didn't add 3/4 cup more sugar I only added a bit more than a 1/4 cup because the mixture was way too thick for more. I kept the batter in a double boiler and kept it over the heat to keep it from crusting. Work fast is all I can say - but it comes out very very pretty. I used a pastry bag to make zig zags, and flower shapes and black and white cookies(used the "Butter Icing for Cookies", from Barbara) and used the "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe on this site.

I tried to use this for my cake.  Spreading it was easy because I did it immediately (and the cake was still a little warm) but we did not like the taste or texture.  I got hard.

This icing is super easy to make plus I always have these ingredients on hand. It's sweet and delicious. It's perfect for cookies. I iced Mrs Sigg's Peanut Butter Cookies (AR recipe) with it and sprinkled chopped peanuts on top. It hardens quickly with a nice glossy look.

Perfect sugar cookie icing. The consistency was just right and the flavor was really good. I'm not sure why other reviewers had trouble with it setting up too quickly. I was able to ice 2 dozen sugar cookies without a problem. I even made it with baking cocoa instead of real chocolate and was very pleased!

Perfect!  Used cream instead of milk and added just a tiny splash more.  Used a silicon spatula to combine till smooth then loaded into decorating bag and piped onto cookies.  Worked out great and tasted good too.  Used semi-sweet mini-chips since it's what I had.  Will absolutely use again to pipe onto cookies, brownies, and other desserts.  Seems like it's a bit thick to use as a dipping icing though but could probably just add more milk to thin it out.

Kids were yelling for chocolate donuts. I didn't want to go out, but I did have a can of biscuits in the fridge. Rolled the biscuits out to get donut size, punched a hole in the middle using a cap from the extract bottle and deep fried them at 350°. The powdered sugar, chocolate, and milk all went in the microwave to melt. Mixed and let it cool for a few seconds. Dipped donuts and BAM. Turned out perfectly.

I added one more cup confectioner's sugar for a total of 2 cups, one more tablespoon milk for a total of 3, plus 1/2 tablespoon butter and it was finally the perfect combination to use for my cupcakes. Set quickly, but not too quickly and wasn't too runny. Chocolatey and delicious.

The fast set-up time mentioned by other reviewers suited my need to get some cookies ready to mail in a hurry on a rainy day.  However, it set up so fast that it was hard to get sprinkles to stick, even doing one at a time! I think next time I may try adding another tablespoon of milk.  This is good tasting icing, and would be ideal, as is, to use as a cookie filling.  It was enough for 2 dozen medium cookies. If it was a little thinner, it might be enough to cover quite a few more.
