I have been looking for a basic Scotch Bonnet / Habanero sauce for a long time and this is the best one I have found.  I pretty much copied the recipe but omitted the Jalape√±os and replaced them with more scotch bonnets. I also used jam sugar (that's what we call it in the UK anyway) which has added pectin in it and made the sauce a little thicker.  Any ideas what the shelf life is in the refrigerator with this amount of vinegar?  Thanks for posting it.

This was a very tasty and very hot hotsauce! I didnt have any scotch bonnets so i used red habanero,jalepenos,and thai peppers.I didnt have any fresh garlic so i used garlic salt and omitted the salt I added about a half teaspoonlemon juice. ended up tasting really good.You will need to open some windows or wear an oxygen mask because it is really hard to breath while cooking it.

Awesome!  My husband loves hot sauces... and did you know they are healthy for you!  The hotter the better they are.  I kept the seeds in and got maybe about 2 cups of hot sauce.  Definitely the best hot sauce out there.

This sauce is excellent! I can not recommend it enough! I made it almost exactly as the recipe said. I used 18 habaneros and 6 jalapenos, all WITH seeds. The only difference was that I decreased the sugar to 1 Tbsp and added a can of sliced peaches. Because of my change, it came out a little too sweet, but it aged wonderfully. After a couple of weeks, the jar or so that I had left was FANTASTIC! Sweet and very hot! Goes great on so many things.   If you like it less sweet, I would recommend either sticking to the recipe, or perhaps using 1 Tbsp sugar and half a can (or less) of peaches.

Great recipe to make your own.  I use this one for the basis of many of my recipes by simply adjusting and adding new ingredients for some amazing sauces.  My latest has been a variation of this one... Reduce peppers to only 12-14 Scotch Bonnets (don't remove the seeds), reduce garlic to 3 large cloves, 1-2 tomatoes, increase vinegar to a tad less than 1/4 cup, 1/4 cup of fresh orange juice (or to taste), and a few dashes of curry.  For the onion, I use a sweet/vadalia.  Everything else is the same. It still packs plenty of punch but has subtle hints of citrus.  If you try this variation, let me know.  Thanks to "bla" for the original recipe!

very good recipe and method. I filled 3 chili sauce bottles. I used 10 scotch bonnets(habaneros) + 6 jalapeno + 6 Serrano. I removed all the seeds from the all the peppers. Strong garlic flavor so cut back a few cloves if that offends you.

a little thinner than i was expecting but quite tasty.. I might add a dash of curry powder next time...you need to open windows and run a fan when the veggies begin to simmer as it's hard to breathe with all the pepper juices going wild!

Fabulous recipe. I have tried variations of this recipe with scotch bonnet, jalapeno and thai chili peppers. Every time I get a jar of dynamite paste. One change I make is to reduce the sugar, as 2 tbsp is a bit too sweet for me. 
A word of advice, though. Don't prepare this on your kitchen stove if you have people around who don't share your enthusiasm for this recipe. The aroma can be overwhelming. Thanks for sharing this one.

I made this for someone that wanted liquid fire...the hotter the better. So I used straight Scotch bonnets and no Jalapenos; then followed the recipe exactly. My victim absolutely loved it. I tasted a tiny amount and discovered a fruity note that was pleasant. So I decided to use a drop or two in my fruit sauce for meat now and then or when I want a little heat in a dish. Very good sauce in tiny quantities (for me.) I did use a bit of food coloring to get the beautiful color.

Hot and Carribean!

Just an easy tasty hot sauce... Tried to make it more tropical by substituting 1/4 cup mango for the sugar.  Juice of 10 key limes, with the white vinegar for a total of 1/3 cup.  Used Spanish onion, and a 1/2 tsp of curry powder.

Very spicy!

I found this excellent.  My only change was to substitute red Fresno peppers for the Jalapenos, because blending reds and greens in liquid sometimes looks nasty.  Also, I subbed Agave nectar for the white sugar, and low-sodium salt substitute for salt.  Check out some of the sauce I've made!

Fire sauce! Yum. This recipe can be much easier with the help of a food processor. Throw in the peppers (seeds and all), onion, garlic, and a couple of whole tomatoes. Blend it all up and then put it in the oil pan, and the tomatoes give it enough juice so you don't have to add water. Then proceed with the recipe. Use any type of hot peppers. Make it doubled or tripled and freeze some.

Super recipe! Followed it almost exactly: since I only had 16 Scotch Bonnets I've used 8 Jalapeno's (on these I've kept the seeds). The result was really amazing and it gave me two jars and a bottle of this delicious hot, hot, hotsauce.

Just a piece of advise: use gloves and toss them in the garbage bin once you've handled the peppers. Then wash your hands really well. While cooking, make sure you have some exhaustion system in place or else open the window of your kitchen wide open, since the vapours can really give you an hard time.

Fantastic recipe. I used Caribbean Red pepper instead of the jalape√±os and left the seeds in. I also added a chopped carrot.

I made this recipe, but I only followed the ingredients not the technique or preparation. Basically all you have to do is give to smooth consistency, and then cook it for 10 minutes. And cooking the sauce is optional. My way cuts down on your prep time and cooking time.

This sauce is awesome. I have made this recipe a few times. Once with scotch bonnets, a couple times with ghost peppers, and recently with chocolate naga vipers (amazing). I omit the jalapenos as they turn the sauce brown. Best approach I've found is to start the onions, get them translucent, then add the garlic. Once the garlic is fragrant and starting to soften add the peppers. Cook the whole thing until the skins of the peppers are starting to get slightly blackened in a few spots. Then add the water. I fluctuate between covered and uncovered to try and reduce the water to exactly the desired volume for blending, while still cooking all the peppers. You do not want to boil off all of the water. Use a little less sugar for hotter peppers to keep the bite and a little more for sweeter ones. When using hotter peppers: COOK THIS OUTSIDE!!

Make sure the wife's out of the house when you make this beauty or you'll definitely hear some bitchin' LOL 
I've made this sauce many times cause it's always a flavourful scorcher which I enjoy but find it to be the most successful when  you add either a jar of peaches or can of pineapple into the mix.

Woah buddy! This is a darn good recipe! Its got a great smoky flavor followed by the POW of spice. I used scorpion peppers and habaneros instead because that's what I have in my garden . But wow is it spicy and flavorful. My roommates absolutely loved it and one of them doesn't even like the spicy stuff. Great job!

Delicious, and hot. I made it without seeds for the first go and it could have been a touch hotter maybe. It does have a juicy, sweet hint which is great. I added 1/2 tsp of mustard powder, toned down the garlic a little and used half white sugar, half demerera. Yum. I'm now trying version 2 with peaches as per another suggestion in these reviews. Bring on the hot sauce!

This was a great recipe! It was my first evet attempt at making a hit sauce,  and I am pkeased with the results.  I typically use Franks and have found it to be dull lately and I was looking for something with more kick! Well I have found it now.  I used 14 Scotch Bonnet and 6 Jalapano. I kept the seeds from the Jalapano,  but did remove the seeds from the Scotch Bonnet as this is big step up from a franks style sauce! While prepairing the peppers,  I used the ziplock bags that you typically use for meat.  While cooking,  I did open all the windows in the kitchen area as I don't have an exaust fan above the stove.  I didn't have an issue with the fumes while it was cooking.  The end result was great, the peppers I bought were mixed colours (red,  yellow and orange) so when those were mixed with the Jalapanos,  it turned out to be a light green/yellow colour.  For clean up,  I cold rinsed everyting used for cooking before washing with hot water.  Overall,  it was easy to make,  has a great taste!

This is an awesome recipe.  Although I made mine strictly with jalapenos, it works with any hot peppers.  I used less than a tbls of sugar and about 3 cloves garlic to make it to my taste.  This sauce is great on anything you want to "kick up a notch".  2 thumbs up on this hot sauce recipe!!  I am going to try to can some for winter use.  Love it!!!  Thankyou for sharing this recipe!!

We grow gobs of this pepper here in Costa Rica. It grows in poor soils and tolerates heavy rains and drought. The bugs leave it alone for obvious reasons.  The pepper has an incredible flavor, sweet and rich.  The heat comes a few seconds later, and lasts. The afterburn, I call it.  I prepared the recipe with 20 full sized scotch bonnets--no jalpe√±os. Otherwise, exactly as per recipe.  As with any hot sauce, heat tolerance is a personal issue.  It is a GREAT sauce, just use it carefully to your taste.

I used cayenne and jalape√±o peppers because that is what is growing in the garden. This sauce is nice and spicy (I am sure more so with scotch bonnets!) and with great flavor. I added a little more salt and a couple of small tomatoes because they were there. Very easy! I will use this recipe often

I used 5 types of peppers as I had grown them and wanted to use them up. Great taste and very hot,  I never take the seeds out.   Ghost, Habenero, Cobra, Cherry Bomb and Jalapeno.   Will make again!

Can be a bit too spicy for some.  I like to make it with  12 Scotch Bonnets and 3 Jalapenos as the peppers here are quite spicy.

Made this recipe as directed, with the only changes being keeping the seeds in the peppers and adding some curry powder. Absolutely outstanding! Was so popular among our neighbours that I had to immediately make another batch as my stock got scooped up. For me, this is a good level of heat. For my wife, her tongue was still burning the day after trying it. So it just depends on how accustomed you are to hot foods. Thanks for this recipe!

It‚Äôs so hard to find a hot sauce that really lives up to the name. This recipe is a total winner! I made it with only the scotch bonnets, but kept the seeds in and omitted the jalape√±os.  WOW!!!  If you really like your sauce HOT, this variation kicks it up several notches and has that unique scotch bonnet flavor. A little bit goes a long way.. and it tastes amazing. I will never buy hot sauce from a grocery store again!

Followed the recipe; with the exception of the sugar (not a fan); but substituted 1 1/2 cups of sweet peppers to provide some balance.  Tastes fantastic fresh; can't wait for it to age a couple of weeks.

We used Carolina reapers and ghost peppers instead of scotch bonnets. We nearly killed ourselves making it. Lower the heat on the stove.  Feels like pepper spray in your lungs when you cook it.  Recommend using eye goggles and a bandanna/face mask.

I strongly recommend this based plan recipe for hot sauce, whatever peppers you're into. Conservation is up to a year and that stuff is freezing friendly. You can add blend of herbs, spices, making it your very own sauce. Fourth batch since I tried it with Scotch, Ghost, Habaneros, Tree peppers. As far as I know, when Jalapenos are not available you can use mild peppers (in appropriate quantity to build uppon) and KEEP ALL the seeds of those beast. Dont waste precious capsa√Øcine! Red onions are the best and don't put that much sugar. Looking for Carolina reapers to update y'all :)

It was not what we were looking for in a hot sauce flavor or consistency.  It is definitely hot, but it ended up tasting like blended cooked peppers.  I think the flavor I am looking for would require fermentation of the peppers.  It was worth a try, and I am sure would meet the needs of some.

made as described, then tweaked to taste the next go round.  will make with carolina reapers  as soon as i can procure some.
tweaked as follows: 1/2 sugar, 1/2 garlic, 8 thai chile peppers(including the 18 habaneros), only 75% of the salt.  will probably only use half the salt from now on.

I have made this sauce multiple times. I have used more jalape√±o than the recipe calls for to make it a green color . also have added a 3rd pepper to it red chili to make it even hotter . the sauce is delicious either way . I also add a bit extra sugar to manipulate the taste buds a bit.

I used scotch bonnet chillis from my plant plus some birds eye chillis and jalape√±os. 
This should last me until next harvest.

This turned out really good.  Very hot but very tasty.
If it weren't for all the slicing it would be awesome.  I guess you could throw them in the food processor before cooking instead of slicing.

I used 9 chillies from my garden plus 3 small habeneros - still turned out great.
