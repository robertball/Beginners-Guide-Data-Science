This chowder is the BEST! My husband and I went to Alaska fishing a couple years ago and we brought a LOT of Halibut home with us. We got tired of most of the ways I fixed it until I found this recipe online. It has been a really big hit with everyone that tastes it. It is great for potlucks, something really different! I changed it just a little, I used Vegetable juice (like V8)instead of tomato juice, canned diced Italian tomatoes instead of canned whole tomatoes mashed and about 1/3 cup of chopped fresh parsley instead of 2 Tbsp. Works GREAT for us! Thanks!

I absolutely loved this!  Made a couple minor changes - halved the recipe, as I only had about a pound of halibut.  I had no apple juice so used water, then added a couple chopped carrots for sweetness to offset the acidity of the tomatoes.  I used spicy V8 instead of plain tomato juice and since I had no fresh parsley I added some dried oregano to keep with the Italian theme.  I resisted the temptation to add anything else - I was thinking maybe some beans or pasta to make it more of a hearty meal, but I'm glad I did not.  Ended up with a light, simple yet very satisfying supper.

I had a party of 8 for dinner so I used about 4 pounds of halibut and added a pound of peeled prawns.   Everyone raved about it but I thought the sauce overpowered the flavour of the halibut.   I will make it again though.

I am from Alaksa and I have tried other chowders before and this is the first one I have made and prefer above the others. I changed it a little by adding a little more garlic and to expand the serving size I added a cup of elbow pasta. Perfect meal for a cold day!!

My husband and I enjoyed this meal immensely. I used talapia and added several fresh vegetables that I had on hand. Very good.

Excellent chowder, added only carrots to it, enjoyed it very much.  How about adding cheese tortelli, might try that.

Yum. Used tilapia and scaled it back a little for just my husband and me. Didn't have tomato juice, so I used tomato sauce. We both really enjoyed it, and it was very Weight Watchers friendly.

I loved this recipe and more imporantly so did my husband. The only thing I changed was the fish. I love my halibut to much to put in soup, so I used cod and shrimp. The flavors were great and I will definately make this again. Its a keeper.

Really good, different kind of soup.  I halved the recipe but used only 12 ounces of halibut and it was perfect for 2.  I had diced tomatoes, so used those in place of the whole tomatoes.  Also did not have a fresh red pepper so used a jarred red pepper, cut in strips, that I added at the end.  It turned out to have a fabulous flavor.  We all liked it and it smelled heavenly while it was cooking!  Thanks for sharing.

In spirit of full disclosure, I tweaked this recipe, but we GOBBLED it up!  I added chopped carrots to the sofrito at the beginning of the recipe.  When I added the fish (I used tilapia filets), I also added drained and rinsed cannellini beans and artichokes, and some zucchini in Italian sauce/herbs (all tinned; I'm cleaning out my larder).  I also was lamenting the lack of apple juice in my house, but ended up adding extra water and about 3-4 tablespoons of cinnamon apple jelly.  AWESOME, sweet and fishy tastes together, and it made the house smell fantastic!  Also, I threw in some fresh dill and basil, along with the dried thyme and parsley.  Successful, and I'm glad I used the apple...it added a lot of character to the soup.

My first taste was not so impressive.  it tasted alot like a cabbage weight loss soup I have made before.  I was tempted to throw out.  I out it in the fridge and took a bowl of it to work 2 days latter and oh my!  The flavors settled and absolutely fabulous!  I made as written with all dried herbs.  Great recipe - definitely let it sit in your fridge a day or two.

I love Manhattan style chowder, but  found myself  w/o  fish stock, so I tried this.  Too much tomato, which overwhelmed the fish. It turned out more like a spaghetti sauce than a chowfer.

Delicious. I made as per recipe except I added a can of fire roasted along with the whole tomatoes and I used extra spicy clamato juice in place of the tomato juice. I used fresh thyme rather than the dried..

Made this for Sunday family dinner.  Large group used 3lbs of cod (halibut was to expensive for my budget) and a pound of shrimp. Added carrots and Merlot to it as well. Also added half a cup of water and used two cans of 28 oz peeled tomatoes. omitted the salt as I'm on a low sodium diet. Used thyme, rosemary, and black pepper to season it. Sauteed all the veggies and garlic before I added them to the soup. Everyone (including the fish haters in the family) loved it. My uncle asked for leftovers for lunch tomorrow and my mom asked for me to make it again as well as the recipe. 
I might add rice next time to add a bit more girth to it. very light meal as of now for those watching their weight.

Loved the simplicity of this recipe. Feel free to throw in a couple diced potatoes and extra Italian seasonings. I had some long squash in the fridge and it stretched the  just over half a pound of halibut at $27 a pound I used nicely.

I've made this recipe more than once with a variety of fishes and it is yummy and easy.  You can easily substitute ingredients based on what you have on hand (i.e. apple sauce for apple juice, fresh herbs for dried herbs, chicken for fish).  This soup is a great creamy chowder alternative for those of you who cannot have dairy or gluten.  I highly recommend!

Love this recipe! I added chopped yam and used water instead of apple juice. Great, easy weeknight meal, add a salad and some crusty bread and it's a crowd pleaser.

I have made this 2x with sea bass my husband caught on a fishing trip. I am a horrible cook and was able to follow as written. I only wish my husband caught more fish!

I have now made this recipe several more times. I now chop all ingredients (except fish and herbs) as written and add them into a lightly sprayed crock pot I cook on high x 1 hour ad use a had mixer to break up my tomatoes. (Also a great tip. We are a family of 2. I buy juice boxes of apple juice and small cans of V8 for cooking. Apple juice and grape juice are great substitutes for wine.)Return the crock to low for about 5-6 hours with fish. If you use diced tomatoes and use frozen fish cut into cubes you can do the whole thing on low 8 hours. Put herbs in last 1/2 hour so they will not taste bitter.
