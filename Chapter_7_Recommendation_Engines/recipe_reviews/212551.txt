I just made this.  I feel like I have to start over because the Pace mixed with cream of celery tastes very much like V8 and not at all like corn chowder.  I know that my husband and kids will not eat this.  Gotta figure something else out, quick.

This is pretty tasty for a recipe using canned soup. I think the Picante sauce probably is what makes this recipe.  I liked it and have made it again and again only using homemade cream of celery soup.

I loved this chowder!  I modified for what I had on hand (cream of mushroom instead of celery, homemade salsa instead of Pace picante), and I simply threw it all in the pot after the bacon was cooked.  I also threw in about 2 cups (2 large handsful of "fiesta blend" shredded cheese instead of putting it on top.  I added about a quarter cup more milk to make it a little thinner, but it was still thick and hearty.  I'll be making this again and again!

This was a quick and easy meal to put together I loved it. I did exactly as the recipe said except I added potatoes and it turned out great extra hardy for the tummy.  Thanks!

This was very easy and fast, ready within minutes!  It has kind of a tex-mex feel to it, not quite what I expected but good.  Surprisingly my husband really wanted seconds, normally he is not such a fan of soups!

I used fresh salsa.  My husband loved this!  He never takes seconds on soup!  All my 4 kids ate it well, too!  A keeper!

Good, but the reddish color and picante flavor weren't the traditional taste we were after.

Every time I make this, whomever I serve it to just raves about it. Very creamy and decadent and versatile, you can dress it down for  simple nights or sports events (tailgating) or you can dress it up by serving in a china or crystal dish during afternoon tea. This dish can fit in at early any event with almost any group of people.

We enjoyed this recipe. I made mine in the crockpot...used chicken straight out of the freezer, and added everything else except the cheese and green onions. I cooked on low for 8 hours. At 1/2 an hour left of cooking, I shredded the chicken and added the cheese and onions. At this point it was a little bland, so added a little cumin and onion salt. Very good and hearty for a cold night!

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  It didn't taste fresh at all...processed.

This was my 1st try at chowder and it was good. I did a few sprinkles of tobasco sauce instead of the picante and it was great.

I don't even like soup but I had two bowls! I doubled the recipe and used spicy cooked chicken to add a bit of a kick.  I also threw in some sliced carrot to add colour and more veggie goodness.  Delicious!
