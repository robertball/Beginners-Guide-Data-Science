We didn't like this at all -- the ginger doesn't go well with the winter squash, it totally overwhelmed it.  We ended up tossing the soup.  I think without the ginger it may have been OK, but bland.

I loved this soup! I didn't have any pecans and it was just great. Also, I tasted it before I added the heavy whipping cream and next time I make it I will leave it out. It was great either way...creamier with the whipping cream...less fat without. The combination of the apples and the squash were perfect. *One thing...it took longer than I thought to peel the butternut squash!
