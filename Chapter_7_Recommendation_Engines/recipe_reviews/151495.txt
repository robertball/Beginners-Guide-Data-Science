These turned out pretty well! I used raspberry jam because my grocery store is small and didn't have preserves. I microwaved the jam a little to make it blend better and saved some to swirl on top.

Great Recipe! Made with home made whipped topping instead of the frozen stuff! though it made double the topping and made much more fluffy! I froze the extra and you can use to fill cupcakes or fill a chocolate cake!

I made these for a friend's birthday who loves raspberry and chocolate anything. We ate these up in no time. Next time, I'll double the batch because they went too quick!
