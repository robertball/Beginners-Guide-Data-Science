I concur with the first review of this recipe- the empanada method is impossible. And don't EVEN think about making this unless you have a food chopper to get your mushrooms and other fillings into "small dice". But I did find a way to make this work. If you have a mini-muffin pan, purchase a box of pre-made pie crusts. Roll them out a little thinner, and use a 3" diameter glass or cookie cutter to make little circles of dough. Be sure to flour your work surface. Spray your little pans well with cooking spray, and fit the little circles of dough into the cups. Then fill with the filling, which I must say is very delicious. Bake at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes or until you can see that the dough is browning. I served these at a party the other night and the guests were highly impressed that I made them. They looked storebought.

Unfortunately, I had high hopes for this recipe and it was not very good at all.  First of all, it was impossible to roll the biscuit dough into 5" circles, even when I doubled it to two biscuits per circle.  It resulted in empanadas that couldn't be easily sealed, and the filling came spilling out as it baked.  Also, the dough tasted odd with the mushroom goat cheese mixture - I will not make this recipe again. :(

This was just so-so.  I used the "Grands" size biscuits and had no problems rolling them out or stuffing them.  The filling just wasn't that exciting.  I think the chilies made the filling soggy, and the goat cheese flavor was lost.

The filling is great but I will definitely leave out the crunchies on the outside ... it was a weird texture.

I lived in Buenos Aires for a while, and I'm always looking for new empanada recipes. I used latin market empanada shells (make sure you get the right kind - there's one for baking and one for frying). But the goat cheese and mushroom filling is just delicious. You can make these empanadas and then freeze them until you are ready to bake/eat.

These tasted great, but I burned the first batch completely.  The cooking time can be reduced by about 10 minutes. Beware!

I did not make these as empanadas, but used pre-made phyllo cups in the freezer section.  These were loved by the 3 guests I had.

These were delicious!  A few tips: as someone else mentioned, they are easy to burn -- put them on the lower rack of the oven, or on the top rack but check them after 10 minutes and every 2 minutes afterwards.  Also, use a fork to press down around the edges to seal the dough so the filling won't leak out.  I also used more garlic & cilantro to add a little more flavor.  Dipping in a salsa verde is a great combo.

The filling was wonderful.  The biscuits could have been better but over all, straight out of the oven they were yummy.

I make something similar to this. I would try using pastry puff instead, it doesn't burn as easily as it is a little thicker.

I used pre-made pastry rather than using the dough for these, but the filling is awesome. I often make it when veggies come for fajitas. They get this filling instead of the chicken pieces. In fact, they have to fight everyone else to keep it because it's SOOOO good.

Rating it a 3 because only utilized half of the recipe. Bought grand biscuits and followed instructions to roll out biscuits, then filled with whatever I had in fridge and baked at 450 for 10 mins.

Loved the concept and would make the general product again, but thought it had very little flavor.

I used pie crust instead of biscuits and sealed them with a little egg.  Perfect!

I made these to take to a party along with another empanada recipe.  These were great.  I deleted the cilantro as my family does not like it and upped the garlic.  Other than that - no issues.  No problems rolling the biscuits out and we really liked the crunchy cornmeal on these.  We will definitely make again and the other recipe I tried, we'll make again but use this recipe for the biscuit/cornmeal outer part of the empanada.
