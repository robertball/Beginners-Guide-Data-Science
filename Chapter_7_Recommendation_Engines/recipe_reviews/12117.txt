Wow does this bring back memories...my Grandma Helen used to make this all the time and everyone loved it! She used to call it "Cherry O'Cream Cheese Pie". This was very easy to make and very good and while it's not a "cheesecake" it's not bad for so few ingredients and being "no bake".  I followed the recipe exactly but I did change up the graham cracker crust this time. I used a chocolate version to give it a "black forest" flavor. Definitely chill it for at least 3 hours and don't overbeat your ingredients for those who found it didn't firm up. I'm sure then it'll come out just like hers did. And like Grandma's always do, she'd add whipped cream on top! Those were the days...

For Firmer Pie: Try Knox (unflavored) Gelatin. Into 1/3 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice, mix in 1 1/2 to 2 tsp & let it stand for 1 minute (lemon juice will 'swell' or thicken).  Incorporate into cream cheese/milk mixture.  If you use fresh--crush your pulp or strain it.  Do not use too much of the Knox or your pie will be more gelatinous than the creamy texture this delicious pie is known for.  Using the Knox means you don't have to sacrifice your lemony flavor by cutting it due to 'soupy' problems and you do not have to add extra cream cheese either which to me, cuts into the other flavors.  Try not putting all that 'cherry glop' (sorry, I hate tha stuff) on the whole pie but spoon over individual slices.  This will keep pie filling from 'saggin' because of the heavy weight of filling.  It also keeps pie from leaking after a few days (if it last that long) making the pie look 'unappealing'.  I have never had a problem with soupy-ness or a pie that doesn't set at all. The Original recipe itself just yields a pretty soft texture.  However, I experimented years ago with unflavored gelatin because I like my pies to cut 'clean'.  This will do just that for you. And because it is unflavored...you don't interupt the original taste of the recipe.  Call it an 'invisible band-aid'. I use sweetened thawed strawberries or frozen cherries mixed with sugar.  I lost the recipe & knew someone would have it here.  Thanks for posting.

This has always been a favorite of our family also. For anyone who loves cream cheese this is a winner!!! Actual preparation time is about 15 minutes, and do yourself a favor by using true vanilla extract and real lemons for the juice. You will be tempted to eat many helpings but beware, this pie is incredibly rich and you will pay a price for overindulgence. Simple and delicious......  Jason Bennett

I read the other reviews and was worried that maybe it wouldn't set or would be too lemony but I followed the directions and it was PERFECT!!! OMG, sooo yummy! I agree that someone must have used evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk. It was perfect as is!

This pie tasted OK, it was the consistency that was the problem.  Even after being in the fridge for 4 hours, it didn't firm up.  It came out more like a thin pudding than a pie!  I made it exactly as directed, with full-fat ingredients.  The flavor was also extremely lemony - next time I might put more cream cheese in - the flavor of it was hidden behind the lemon.

for those who can't take the sweetness of it all this might help use two packages of cream cheese instead of one and instead of sweet milk you can just use sugar that way you can taste as you mix to see what works best for you i have made this for years and it really is a great recipe.

This is very very sweet. My refrigerator didn't quite make it set, so the cherries sank right to the bottom. Next time I think I'll freeze it overnight instead of refrigerating it overnight. Also, it got a little bit lumpy. Not sure if it's just my refrigerator, but I wasn't thrilled.

My mom used to make this when I was a kid, so I was thrilled to stumble across this recipe. I find 1/3cup of lemon juice to be too much, so I cut it back to 1/4cup.  If I don't have a graham cracker crust in the house, I simply put the cream cheese in casserole dish, then top it with the cherry filling. Super easy and delicious. I'm guessing those that are having problems with the consistency are using evaporated milk instead of condensed. BIG difference.

I used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat crust, fat free evap milk and light cherries.  This was so refreshing, and still so sweet for all the fat/calorie cuts I made.  Will definitely make again and try different toppings!

This was a last min thing I did. Just needed to fill an extra pie crust I had  made.  This was for my Hubby and he liked it. I only had 2 cans of bing cherry in sugar. I think it would of been better if I had had the cherry pie filling type. But, it was supper easy to make and turned out good!  Had to thicken my cherries with some corn starch to give it the correct texture, but otherwise I followed the directions.

I have family members who can only eat gluten free food.  I made this without the pie crust and they loved it.  You can use different fruit toppings for a variety.  This recipe is almost too easy.

I have made this recipe for years. Really good.. follow recipe exactly.  I sometimes put blueberry pie filling instead of cherry for something different. You can also fill up filo cups with the filling instead of a pie crust and top with a blueberry or strawberry (rolled in sugar) for a "fancy" quick dessert.
 Quick note:  Use real vanilla and real lemons. Makes a big difference in the taste.

Made this recipe almost to specs, but I only had about 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice.  Didn't take it to the dinner as planned because I was afraid the missing lemon juice would effect the flavor, but I was wrong.  Delicious!!  Didn't seem to hurt it at all.  Will make again and again...and maybe lighten the lemon juice amount since some reviews complain of the recipe being too lemony.  Thanks for a keeper!

I made this using low fat cream cheese and fat free sweetened condensed milk and I made another one using the full fat stuff. No one could tell the difference! I've made this pie for years and it always is a huge success.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I love that it is so simple and no bake.  It was a little too rich for my taste.  If I were to make it again I would definitely let it set overnight.  I let it set 5 hours and it was still too runny, next day it was much better.  And I did use sweetened condensed milk, not evaporated.

Follow direction, instead of the cherry pie filling, I used the entire package or container of strawberry glaze and sliced fresh strawberries. Mix together and spread on top of cream cheese filling the next day.  Diane

Like so many others have stated, I've had trouble with this in the past due to the cream cheese collapsing (even after 6 hrs., or more, time to set). THIS time I added 1tsp of plain gelatin. What a difference! The pie is firm, even after slices have been taken from the pan. Can't wait to make it again!

This is one of my husband’s favorite desserts. We did make a change recently and we love it even more!  We use strawberry pie filling instead of the cherry.

One of our family favorites!  I don't typically use the almond extract though.  I used to make as a pie with the graham cracker crust, but have recently started making these as dessert cups with mini nilla wafers as the "crust" in the bottom, then just spoon filling on top.  To do 8 6-oz servings, you need to double this recipe. For those complaining about the cherries sinking or the filling not setting, I wait until just before serving to put the cherries on.

This is the first 'pie' I made as a teenager in 1974 using bottled lemon juice!Please use Sweetened Condensed milk NOT evaporated milk. Also, stir juice, vanilla and zest (if using) into smoothly beaten cream cheese/milk mixture. Let set up in fridge 2-3 hours THEN top with pie filling or spoon filling on slices after plating to keep filling from sinking into pie. Easy, refreshing dessert.

The recipe is great.  To those of you that are having problems with the cheese filling not setting, you are either using evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk or you are not letting it set up in fridge BEFORE you add cherry pie filling.

Only had six ounces of creamsheese, but substituted the other two ounces with two tablespoons of unsalted butter worked out well. Defiantly will make again.

I've made this a couple of times.  First time with a pre-made crust (which is definitely just "ok").  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 c.  This time it's for Thanksgiving so had to make the crust.  I think the butter/graham cracker crust ratio is way off.  I had to double the amount of graham crackers to get the right consistency.  Which is OK because I like graham cracker crust and had extra crackers.  But, I don't get why the ratio was so off.  It would have been swimming in butter.  Next time I'll either double the crackers as I did today, or cut the butter in half.  Yummy pie though.  That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I've made this for years. Great for summertime BBQs. I always add cool whip to help with the consistency of the pie. I usually don't measure how much cool whip to put in it. Maybe add 2 cups  or more will do.

This pie is a staple at our family gatherings, we love it! We use fresh lime juice rather than lemon juice. For the topping we’ve always used sliced fresh or thawed frozen strawberries. The recipe is extremely simple.

It tasted good for what it is ( a pie ),  I think I looked at the wrong recipe and was actually looking for a cheese cake.  
It isn't firm like a cheese cake, but firm enough for a pie.  Just wanted to help others  who may be thinking cheese cake.

If your pies don't firm up, it's because you didn't use enough lemon juice. I use 1/2c instead of 1/3c, works perfectly and adds a bit of pucker. The old original Philly cream cheese pie recipe used 1/2c.

I used to make this recipe as a kid often. It was just as I remembered, easy and tasty. However, after tasting it I remembered that I liked to increase the lemon juice by half to give it a bit more tang, toning down the sweetness.

This was good but not great. I did try it after it was in the fridge for a few hours, and it wasn't holding it's texture very well; was very loose. The next day it was a little better. I was just expecting something a little firmer I guess. Just not wild about the texture or flavor.

I loved the flavor. Exactly what I was looking for, kinda tart with the amount of lemon juice the recipe calls for. I only gave it 3 stars because it set for hours and never got firm. My experience with cheese cakes is limited but I guess it didn't set because it was a no bake recipe.

The cream cheese never set. The cherries sank to the bottom of the pie.

It turned out like soup for me, too.  Perhaps it's like a previous reviewer mentioned, that the milk should be a smaller tin (not 14 oz.).  Unfortunately 14 oz. is all the stores near me carry.  So, I guess this is one recipe I won't be serving again.

Tasted OK . . .

Good! I made this for a family dinner when I really wanted cheesecake but didn't have enough time to make it. I took the advice of some other reviewers and added gelatin to the lemon juice about a minute before adding it to the batter. It really helped it to set nicely. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I doubled the recipe to make 2 pies and used fresh lemon juice. One I topped with can cherry pie filling, the other fresh sliced strawberries. They were delish! Loved it!

My first time making this was for Thanksgiving....I used a premade crust for it,though. My family loved it! My Mom and little brother requested a pie of their own for Christmas.  :) want a bit of a twist try it with chocolate graham cracker crust. That was my second time making it.  :)

After reading the other reviews I was worried about it being too sweet and not setting and the topping sinking.  I added two eggs to the filing and baked at 350 for 35 minutes in a a water bath. Looked like a professional cheese cake. I refrigerated the pie overnight and added the topping several hours before dinner and continued chilling it in the refrigerator.  To give it a black Forrest look I used a prepared Oreo crust and strawberry pie topping. Yum yum!

I am so happy to have found this recipe.  I used to make this back in the 80s, but then I lost the recipe.  I've never liked any other cheesecake nearly as well as this.  It's creamy, soft and delicious!  Two thumbs up! Thanks for posting it.

This was super easy and quick, I had no trouble with mine setting up right.  I used regular cream cheese.  I put everything together in the blender for just a couple of minutes cause I didn't really read the directions about seperating it but it worked out just fine.  I put in tartlet shells and I topped it with frozen raspberries cause that was I had on hand.  Thought the sweet of the pie mix was perfect against the tart raspberries with no sugar.  Would be great with a lemon curd topping too. Thanks!

This is a great recipe (very basic and simple) I just multiplied it to make a 18x18 square for 100. It came out perfectly!! so simple. However I replaced all the cherry filling for fresh blueberries mixed w/ one whole can of blueberry filling. Make sure you are using CONDENSED milk. This recipe is a keeper Im gonna try it topped w/ home lemon curd yumm :-)

I love this pie.  Ive been making it forever.  If you want more of a tangy taste, cut the vanilla and add a little more lemon juice.  This recipe also works best if the pie can sit for atleast a day in the fridge.  You can also cut the cherries and have it  plain.  Its still great!

This was sooooo good!  I used light pie filling, fat-free condensed milk, fat-free cream cheese with a shortbread crust.  The cheese mixture didn't firm up even overnight but I always assume that *diet* ingredients are the reason, not the recipe.  Will definitely make again; this was a big hit!

Very good and very easy! A little on the sweet side, but it is a dessert! I made it in a 8x8 pan, cut it into bars and let each person spoon the cherries on top. It was a hit!

My husband loved this recipie to my surprise.  He and I are fans of NY style cheesecake and I didn't think he would go for this.  He devoured it.  I made the graham crust extra thick with the Nabisco graham crumb recipe on the box and made the pie in a spring form pan.
