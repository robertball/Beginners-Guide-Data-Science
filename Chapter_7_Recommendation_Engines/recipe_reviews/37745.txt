My family loved it, and it was so easy!  I'll make it again.  the only thing I changed was I used more than 4 cups of bread cubes, depends on what size loaf of bread you're talking about.  I prebably used 6-7 cups.  It was great.

This recipe was VERY quick and easy and it turned out great!!  I added dried cranberries instead of the raisins and it not only tasted great but it looked nice too!

Everyone loved this at Thanksgiving- they passed over the pies for this.  The apples are tender and there is a wonderful cinnamon flavor and excellent texture.  I will definitely make again.

Came out a bit too soggy.  Next time I'll try without the milk required.

Needs more pudding in it I think... or less bread.

I find, I can vary the ingredients, like cranraisins, instead of apples, grapenuts, rather than walnuts.  Of course, the grapenuts are softened, when baked.

Some of my guests liked this, but I was disappointed.  I think the lack of eggs kept it from rising a bit, it could have used some sugar and a pinch of salt in the recipe.  It came out looking very flat and heavy. I served it with a lot of vanilla ice cream and that seeemed to do the trick.

I am unfamiliar with making bread pudding, but most I have seen have had a creamy, soft texture. This recipe did not say to cover before baking and so the top became very hard and dry. Is this supposed to be stirred while baking?  Also, as there are many varities of french bread, what kind of french bread is recommened? The recipe calls for apples chopped but the picture looks like they are sliced. If I were to make this again, I also think more pudding mixture is necessary, maybe using two large packages of pudding and a little more milk.

Great recipe.  Very easy to make and the best of all everyone loved it.  I put nuts and raisins, next time I will leave nuts out. Moist on the inside but a bit dry on the outside.  Next time I will cover for half the time.  Will definitely do again.

I thought this was good but not great.  My boyfriend thought it was a little bland. I probably won't make this again.

So easy and yet very yummy!  I love bread pudding and found this to be a simple recipe.  I love the apple flavor.  I use walnuts but not raisins & tend to add cinnamon & nutmeg to the mix for added flavor.
