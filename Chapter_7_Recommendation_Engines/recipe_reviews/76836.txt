I used fruit that was in season and that was fresh. If the fruit isn't ripe, the salad-treat won't taste very good. SO use melons, strawberries, grapes, blueberries, kiwi or anything fresh. I used a pineapple sorbet that worked just fine. My only change would be to use Sugar Free Jam. The Strawberry Preserves was a little too sweet for my liking, especially with the already sweet ice cream. I think even a fig jam that is mild might be really good as well... Don't forget fresh mint, it adds that extra punch!!! Its very easy especially for a large crowd and I would make it again!!!
