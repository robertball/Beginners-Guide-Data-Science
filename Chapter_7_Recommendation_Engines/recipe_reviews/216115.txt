I thought this was a pretty good soup. I didn't add the artichokes though. I blended half of it up a little for the kids and I liked it that way too. Next time I make it, and I will,  I will add more spices

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!   The recipe called for the turkey to be cubed but I chose to shred it for my own personal prefrence. I didn't have any artichoke hearts so I left them out but I added some frozen corn for color.  I also added black beans in addition to the chick peas.  For presentation, I  garnished it with chopped cilantro and Mexican crumbling cheese.  Delicious!
I will definitely make this dish again!

Made this for a weeknight dinner and it was very tasty! I didn't have the exact vegetables called for so I subbed zucchini for the yellow squash, and red pepper for the green. I thought 4 cups was a lot so used about 2 1/2. This seemed to be the right amount. I also added some garlic. The only thing that seemed a little strange was the garbanzo beans. They weren't bad; just not really necessary. I served this over a pile of rice in soup bowls and everyone enjoyed it. Healthy and filling and leftovers for lunch. Planning to make it again!
