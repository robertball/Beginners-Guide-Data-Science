This is my favorite way to cook salmon and can easily be adjusted for one person.   My husband only likes his salmon broiled or baked but this I much prefer.   Highly recommend this method and recipe.

So glad I found this recipe, as this is now my favoite way to cook salmon. It's very moist and doesnt taste "fishy" at all. It's very quick and simple and healthy as well!

YUM!  This was awesome!  I've cooked other fishes this way before and was curious to see if anybody else had done it, or if there was a Salmon En Papillote recipe on allrecipes.  I'm glad I checked it out.  I'd had a huge fillet of Salmon in the freezer for too long.  This recipe was fast and that's my favorite kind of recipe.

I made this with a big handful of chopped fresh spinach under each piece of salmon, instead of using asparagus.  For seasoning, I used Johnny's seasoning salt.  I baked it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, as directed and it turned out perfect.  The lemon was really good with the salmon and spinach.  For a side dish, I briefly sauteed spiralized zucchini, caramelized onions, sliced mushrooms, and Adobo seasoning.  I also served fresh cantaloupe cubes.  It was a quick and tasty company dinner with a minimum of fuss and practically no cleanup.

This was a great recipe for salmon.  I usually don't care for lemon with fish but this was very mild.  The salmon stayed very moist and was delicious.  Served it with New Potatoes with Caper Sauce from this site and we just loved it.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

This was delicious! 
My baking paper sheets were not big enough to go around the salmon and asparagus so I used aluminium foil instead, and needed to cook it for longer, but it turned out great anyway. 
I'll definitely make this again!

Moist, and tender lemon salmon.  I used my first fresh garden asparagus (better than store bought:) and parchment paper bags that I found at the store.  I really liked this as written, DH thought it needed something.  But he couldn't tell me what he thought was missing though!  I'll play with some old bay for him, maybe a little red pepper or red peper flackes?  I'll let you know what he decides it needs. . . Thanks carly!

It was good but still a little more fish taste than I was expecting.  Added a lobster bisque sauce over the top to help hide it.

The salmon was cooked to perfection in 20 minutes. The asparagus (thick stalks) could have used another 5 minutes. Next time (and there will be many next times) if I have the thick asparagus stalks, I'll slice them lengthwise before chopping. Did not have any green onions, so I put in thinly sliced yellow onions and garlic. Excellent - quick and elegant!

Gene loves this!  I use very little onion on mine and it is very good.  Use normal amount of onions on Gene's.

So very good! No parchment paper at our local grocery store, so I used foil without any issues. Next time, I will add more asparagus as it came out so delicious and tender! Most definitely will make this recipe on a weekly basis. Thanks!!!

I made it exactly per the recipe.  It was very moist.  Next time I will add more seasoning... like maybe a store bought seafood seasoning and will add more lemon juice.  But it was definitely a good base recipe for salmon.  And there was absolutely no fishy taste.

I was kind of skeptical about this recipe but I am SO glad we tried it. No fishy salmon smell during or after cooking and the fish was moist and tender. I loved the asparagus and green onions added to each parchment packet. I would probably add a little more asparagus to each next time. I might also try throwing in a little dried dill weed to each packet. That's always a great herb to use with salmon. We will definitely make this again!

Super moist and delicious.  I didn't have lemon, so used lemon pepper spice and still tasted great.  I also didn't have parchment paper, so used foil.  Will try again with different veggies.

OMG...the best salmon we've had at home or in a restaurant.  The parchment paper really seals in the flavors and makes the salmon so delicate and juicy.  My husband loved this dish!

I used larger pieces of salmon, but overall it was still great. Getting them wrapped was a bit of a struggle.
