I have one suggestion for these potatoes.... don't make them. A waste of time and money. The taste of cinnamon with these potatoes is gross. These don't even rate one star, but there is no lower choice. SORRY!!!!

Would not make this dish again.  It was edible, however, teenage girls would not go near it.  Not even a "pretty" dish.  Sorry,  Nannie

Not sure what the other complaints were about.  I've made these several times and really enjoyed them, as has everyone else.  Just a few changes to the recipe -I used a little less butter, subsituted milk for the cream and combined nutmeg with the cinnamon.  Very nice!

I made these as an alternative to my recipe for funeral potatoes as they were so drastically different it surprised me.... but I'm stuck with my recipe... I just couldn't handle the yucky cheese or the cinnamon it was awful!  I will stick with my own recipe
