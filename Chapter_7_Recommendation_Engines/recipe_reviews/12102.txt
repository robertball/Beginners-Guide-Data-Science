tastes fantastic, but if you don't eat everything at one time the refreezing makes it rock hard, so you have to thaw it and then it melts and falls apart.

it does taste very good though.  i'd recommend making it when you know it will be finished the first time you serve it

This was the first pie to go on Thanksgiving. The kids of course loved it because it was chocolate. I snazzed up the recipe by adding oreos that had peppermint creme filling. The flavor was subtle but definitely gave it more zing. Very very good!

I made this pie for my grandfather's 
birthday and not only did he love it,
but so did my entire family!  Now they
beg me to make it for all of our family
gatherings!  Best of all, its so easy and
tastes great with low and non-fat ingredients!

It was rock hard, and the crust did not want to come out of the pan. The texture was not creamy like I expected, it had frozen crystals throughout. It finally tasted pretty good once it sat on the plate and thawed out.  My suggestion would be to freeze it for maybe 20 minutes to make it set, then store it in the refrigerator until serving time.

I'm not a big fan of DQ's frozen ice cream cakes but my family is and this had a similar taste. I didn't measure how many oreos I used, just added until I felt it looked right. I let some oreo chunks be large while others were crushed fine and this made for a nice pie. Plus, it is a breeze to make. Thanks Kimberly.

I loved this because it was soooo easy and yummy!  I forgot to cover it when I put it in the freezer, so it tasted a little like the freezer. :)  But that was my fault. I even got the low fat whipped topping and the cheap brand of cookies, and it was still soooo delicious! I also put some cookies on top.

Great recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  I did use a ready made oreo pie crust and I put toffee in the mix instead of cookies.  My family loved it!!! Thanks.

Doesn't get much quicker or easier than this. Any dessert recipe that doesn't require baking time is right up my alley. Using my microplane, I garnished with a mint chocolate candy bar. YUMMO and thanks Kimberly!

This was quite good and easy, but a lot of time with the pie in the fridge. First I had to set the pudding for a couple of hours. I also put crushed Oreos on the top to make it more interesting. I used Reduced Fat Oreos, since they are crushed anyway.

AMAZING!!!  Couldn't have asked for a better recipe...it IS like DQ's ice cream cake...only better!!!  This is fun because you can try many different variations....maybe vanilla pudding with crushed heath bars in the pudding and on top?  I will try new variations...this is a keeper...for life!

I'm not sure why this calls for freezing. In the 100 times I've made this, I've never froze it, just let it set up in the refrigerator.

I used crushed thin mints and a few crushed Andes mints instead of Oreos. Also, I didn't freeze it but I left it in the fridge overnight before bringing to a work thing. It went great!
