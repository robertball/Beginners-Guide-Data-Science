Amazing flavor - just the right mix of sweet and spicy.  I used serrano peppers since I couldn't find scotch bonnets. Also used 2 onions instead of 3.  Marinated 3 pounds of thighs for 2 days and grilled. My wife and I both loved it and will definitely be cooking this again.

Amazing flavor!  I subbed yogurt for the olive oil because I was using thighs instead of breasts.  Makes a ton of marinade, half the recipe is plenty for 3 lbs of meat.  I boiled off the marinade and then mixed a small amount into a container of fat free honey greek yogurt for an amazing sauce.

This is a great recipe, I grilled chicken thighs, then cut the meat off the bone and served over rice. My neighbor liked it so much she sent over chicken for me to "jerk"!!

This was good.  I made it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, marinated it overnight and grilled it on a grill pan on top of the stove,  I left out the peppers.  It had a good flavor but I think it would taste better with bone-in chicken with skin on the grill.  I might try that next time.

I don't normally take the time to leave reviews on recipes I've made but I had to leave one on this. This jerk chicken caught my fiance and I completely off guard. I actually marinated it for 24 hours in the refrigerator and it turned out simply amazing. I will never try a different recipe for jerk chicken. This will be my "go to" every time now. I even forgot to add in the onion and it still turned out ridiculously good. I also used 6 jalapenos I stead of scotch bonnets, because the grocery store didn't have them and they didn't have habaneros either. I will use 10 jalapenos next time because I didn't taste any heat whatsoever. Thanks for sharing this outstanding jerk chicken recipe!

Thanks!  Great recipe and, like you said, easier than the list of ingredients mike make you think.

Only change for me worth mentioning was not measuring.  I didn't have a full cup of vinegar left (or need it tonight for the 3 of us).  Well, everything was added in eyeball proportion ( 2 oranges, some oil, etc.) straight in to the blender.

Oh, also, I used boneless chicken breast (one per person) and pounded them to about 1/2 inch thickness.  I like to do that for grilling unless the presentation is negatively affected.  For this recipe, the presentation was appropriate and it helped speed the marinade (which I did for only 4 hours) and the grilling.

My wife and daughter loved it!

Oh my, what can I say? This was superb, fantastic. The flavor was wonderful. The next time I make this I will double the chicken. My husband and I cleaned our plates of one whole chicken. The aroma when it was cooking on the charcoal grill brought back wonderful memories of Jamaica. FYI I couldn't find the Scotch bonnet peppers so substituted Serrano peppers and they worked just fine. I wore gloves and a mask when I was cleaning them as I did remove all the seeds and it was plenty hot for me. I hope to find the bonnet peppers the next time I make this. I also marinated mine for three days.

This recipe is amazing - didn't change a thing. The right amount of flavour and heat. So flavourful. Make sure to use bone-in and skin-on thighs as it really adds to the flavour. This makes a TON of marinade and is super simple - just add all ingredients to a food processor and you are done. This is now one of my favourite chicken recipes for sure. My friends still rave and ask for it. Having it again tonight! Yum!

Don't know how someone could find this bland!  It had a lot of flavour!  I love spicy but only used 4 peppers instead of 8.  Absolutely delicious!!!

We had always wanted to try Jerk Chicken and I'm glad this was the recipe we picked, because it was absolutely delicious.  I brined bone-in chicken quarters and breasts for a day, and then marinated them in the exact recipe for another day.  The chicken was grilled at about 300 degrees on a kamado grill with some pecan wood added to the coals until the breasts reached an internal temperature of 165.  The whole family thought it was amazing and we'll be making this at least a few times a month.  Many thanks to Lisa for an outstanding recipe!

Was awesome.  I switched hot pepper flakes vs the peppers as I didn't v want it too hot.  Really nice flavor.  Recommend making a couple days in advance as the flavours blend and settle beautifully. 
I used boneless chicken.  Will use chicken on a bone next time for better  texture

I made this for some friends and they thoroughly enjoyed it!  I didn't have access to a grill so I baked it in the oven for an hour and then broiled it for ten minuets. Also, I used drum sticks and thighs instead of breasts and I  substituted the scotch bonnet peppers for habanero peppers. Great flavor and the perfect amount of spice! I saved some of the leftover marinated chicken for when I can actually grill it. I highly recommend this for anyone who needs to get their jerk chicken fix. ??

I always follow the recipe exactly if I'm going to rate it, and this one rated excellent.  Only issue is the amount it makes.  Cut the recipe in half or double the amount of chicken.  Nice one, Lisa!

Made as directed and it turned out great. Marinade is a good consistency and the recipe makes plenty of it. Holds
up well to grilling without burning to easily.

Great recipe! Based on other reviews, I used skin-on, bone-in thigh meat which turned out moist and full of flavor. Marinated for ~24 hours. Baking in the oven with pyrex (we don't have a grill) took a little over an hour but the prep time and cook time was well worth it! I used 6 serrano peppers but might try a little more spice next time. Served with simple basmati rice with butter and salt.

It was really bland! It made a ton of marinade and I froze half, so I may try it with boneless chicken breasts and marinate for longer. I did about 10 hours and you could hardly taste the flavor of the marindade. Hopefully without the skin and 24 hours of marinating, it will absorb more flavor? This recipe was a big disappointment.

This was a delightful recipe; my husband liked it so much that he suggested I make it the same exact way next time. I did use a lot less pepper because my husband and 2 year old cannot handle that type of heat. I look forward to making this during the summer when I can grill it. Being that it has been a cold winter; I made it in the oven.
