I am the one who uploaded this originally (it was years ago, so I forget the username and pw I signed up with) and I always kept forgetting to fix what I incorrectly listed the red peppers ingredient as - 3 TABLEspoons when it should be 3 TEAspoons......I've noticed some like it "hot" but, nonetheless it really was meant to be that much LESS spicy.....still happy to see that many have enjoyed it.
