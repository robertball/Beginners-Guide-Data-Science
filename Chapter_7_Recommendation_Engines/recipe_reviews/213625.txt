RUN - do not walk to get parsnips!  They are like white carrots - mine were pretty big and I used 4 large parsnips and 4 average sized carrots.  OH MY GOODNESS - so GOOD.  I used the immersion blender but just mixed them into a semi-chunky texture - butter and a bit of kosher salt and these are  perfect!

I used half carrots, half parsnips.  Mine did not turn out very smooth because I probably slightly undercooked the vegetables (they were soft but still had texture), plus not owning an immersion blender, I tried using a hand mixer - I SHOULD have dragged out my food processor! But it was still delicious, a lovely change from our usual side dish.  I'd like to experiment with different herbs or spices next time, maybe add a teeny drop of honey or even maple syrup like I do when I roast these vegetables together.

We got some carrots and parsnips from our CSA so was looking for a recipe that used both. This fit the bill perfectly.  I added just a touch of cinnamon for some extra flavor.  Although my kids weren't thrilled with it, my husband and I both enjoyed it.  I will make this again should I find I have an abundance of these veggies once more.

By golly, this really was fabulicious! A great alternative to mashed potatoes, and very easy to make. Stayed w/ the 4:1 ratio of parsnips to carrots as called for by the recipe submitter, and glad we didn’t veer off course as the wonderful flavor of the parsnips shined through. The 8 medium and large sized parsnips weighed in at 2 pounds, and 8 ounces of baby carrots were used. We made the following ‘tweaks’: 2X snipped chives as listed, and added 2 tablespoons honey and a dash of nutmeg. Thank you ‘Always Cooking Up Something’ for a fantastic vegetable dish.

My 7 month old LOVES this! I prefer it with a little dash of nutmeg - great suggestion by other reviewers! - but he can't get enough of it as is. Good stuff. Thanks!

I found this to have a bitter aftertaste. I tried adding curry as another reviewer suggested, which helped a little, but I think I will find another way to use parsnips from my CSA

All I can say is...DELISH!!  Hubby and I have been trying new veggies and neither of us had ever had parsnips.  This is a great starter recipe and we didn't change anything.  Will definatley make again soon.

Excellent recipe.  I used 3-4 large parsnips, 5 carrots, and a stick of butter. Stick blender worked great but I think a food processor would work well too.  Made a nice side dish for chicken instead of potatoes. I think it would even be a great addition to our Thanksgiving menu.

Kind of bland when I tried this, so I added curry powder and nutmeg.  Roast the veggies a bit longer when on top of the stove for a fuller flavor.

Where have this been my whole life? It absolutely delicious! I puree all the ingredients in a food processor and added salt and pepper to taste.  AMAZING. Will become a new favorite in our house!

Delicious! My only modification was holding off on the additional 3 tbs of butter and add a few splashes of cream. Can't wait to make it again. Yum.

Turned out so good.  It is difficult to find fresh parsnips in my area (Dallas-Fort Worth) and parsnips have to be very fresh or I find them to be bitter.  Hopefully, more people will discover them and our market will improve.

I used this recipe as a guideline.  I used half parsnips and half carrots but I also added a leek cut in half lengthwise  (white part only) and thinly sliced.  I boiled all the veggies up together added the butter and mashed but left it chunky and added some salt and pepper.  I don't think any other spices are needed as the flavour of the veggies are best on their own.  Will make again.  Easy and tasty.

Loved it!!! We are a fan of carrots and parsnips so this was a no fail dish! I added chili powder for a kick and nixed black pepper and salt. People can add that as they see fit. I also used a potato masher and smashed till it looked fantastic!! Definitely will do again!!! Thank you for sharing the inspiration!!!

We don't have a stick blender so we used our normal blender. We boiled the vegetables, drained the water, put the butter in the pot with the veggies to melt, then put it all in the blender. We used a tamping stick to push down the veggies into the blades. It turned out great, we will make again.

I tried this because I'm always looking for ways to work new/different veggies into our dinner rotation. This was just ok. My 3 & 6 year olds did not like it, and they are generally pretty good eaters when it comes to veggies, and they LOVE carrots,  but the parsnips definitely gave it a wierd flavor. I followed the recipe as written  but accidentally mixed up how many of what I was supposed to buy, so I ended up using 3 medium parsnips and 6 carrots. My husband said it tasted "different," I didn't think it was terrible but it definitely won't be in our dinner rotation,
as it is I have the feeling I'm the only one who will be eating these leftovers.

Great healthy substitute for potatoes! I followed the recipe then added salt & some horseradish to enhance the flavor. Add a little horseradish at a time until it suits your taste!

So I was not sure how I would feel about this going in. But I grew a lot of parsnips and just harvested them all and was thinking "What can I do that's quicker than roasting them?"  So I tried this recipe and I'm glad I did!  This was simple and so tasty!  I probably used only 4-5 Tbsp butter because it was what I had left.  Otherwise I didn't change a thing.  The butter makes it taste rich but the carrot and parsnip sweetness come through.  Loved it and definitely making it again soon!

Love this and make it regularly.  We have done it mashed by had and with an immersion blender.  The smooth texture is better in my opinion, but if you aren't able to blend the mixture, don't avoid trying it!!  The flavors are delish!

Very good but a quick tip.  Try to avoid the really big parsnips when you make this (over 1.5-2 inches at the top), they seem to add a bitterness to the recipe.

Yum! Served with Salmon Tango (on this site). Did it a food processor added a bit of hot water to get a smooth consistency.

This was okay for me. I added a little nutmeg like other reviewers suggested. I had never eaten parsnip before, and I found it to have an unusual taste. Not bad, just different. I didn't have an immersion blender, so mine was chunky.

Easy recipe, delicious results.  We don't have an immersion blender so I poured the boiled carrots and parsnips into the kitchen blender after draining and added chives and butter. Blended til smooth, prodding with a wooden spoon to keep the mixture moving.

I got a nice smooth texture with the following modifications to the technique: drain the cooked parsnips/carrots and return to hot pot.  Add chives and whole stick (8T) of butter, stir until melted.  Transfer mixture to food processor and let food processor run for several minutes until vegetables are smooth.  If you have a small-ish food processor you may need to do this in batches.  If the vegetables cool too much during this time, pop them in the oven at 350 for a few minutes until hot again.

Very nice, here's my take on it:
- cooked everything in 2/3 water, 1/3 milk with a bit of chicken broth, gives a nice taste
- used half carrot/half parsnip
- also some yellow green beans and just a bit of potatoes (the latter are unnecessary but I do recommend the beans)

Fabulous change of pace vegetable. I followed the recipe, but not necessarily the proportions. I just used the one huge parsnip I had and three carrots. Delicious.  I will definitely make this again.
