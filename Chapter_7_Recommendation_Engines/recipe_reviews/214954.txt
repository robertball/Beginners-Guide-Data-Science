I halved the recipe, used chipotle chili powder as that is what I had, and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp. Do not use the listed amount of salt as the sauce will be way too salty!
I brought the sauce to a boil then let sit to thicken slightly.
Besides heat and saltiness, the sauce really has no other taste, I would think onions or garlic would be a good addition.
