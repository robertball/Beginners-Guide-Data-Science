I chose this recipe because one reviewer had said it was very "custardy"...we LOVE custard!!

We LOVED this recipe...I can't wait to make it again...and again.

I screwed it up and added the coconut to the blender...oops...so I also added more coconut to the top...it was fantastic!! Wonderful custard like "pie" that tastes like a macaroon!

I had to bake mine a little longer than the recipe calls for.  About 10 extra minutes.  Easy to make!!

I found this same recipe in an old cookbook I bought at a garage sale, titled, You've Got to Be Kidding!  It also features other delectable delights such as Earthworm Cookies. This pie is absolutely delicious and amazing because it makes its own separate crust, filling and topping; all out of the blender! My recipe instructs to blend as you count slowly to 10, and it instructs to put the coconut in the blender with the other ingredients.  As such, it provides a nice buttery topping for the pie.  It also fools skeptics of the pie who think they don't like coconut.  This is a definite keeper in our house.  If you love custard, you'll love this pie.  Incidentally, I do not try the Earthworm Cookie recipe!

Tastes great and so easy to make.  I stirred the coconut in with the other ingredients and then sprinkled 1/4 more on top.  This recipe is a keeper.

GREAT PIE!  This pie is so simple to do.  I throw all the ingredients into a blender, including the cup of coconut, and pour into a buttered pie dish. Then I top it off with extra coconut. 40 minutes is the perfect baking time.  It always disappears. Thank you Rosie De Coito for sharing!

Great "as-is" in the recipe the 1st time I did it! 2nd time,since my family dislikes coconut,  I ommited the coconut and made it with a touch of almond xtract in the filling. When I removed it from the oven I then topped it with Raspberry jam(slightly micro'd easier to spread)then let it set till cool. My family prefers it cool (even cold), warm or cool it's..... Awesome !!

I thought for a quick fix, it was delicious. I did have to bake it loner to get the middle to set, but no biggie! Custard like filling with toasted coconut topping. Simple yet scrumptious. I was out of Bisquick, so I made my own baking mix: 2 cups flour, 3tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 2tbsp of shortning. I sifted dry ingredients and used a whisk to mix in shortening. PERFECT!!!

This tasted identical to a coconut flan I made last summer.  Actually, I'll be honest - I liked it okay because I like custard and flan - but it didn't taste like a pie at all.  My boyfriend hated it and couldn't finish one slice.  This would be a great recipe if you just renamed it - Coconut Custard or Coconut Flan

I have been making this pie for many years.  The only thing I do to make it less custardy is to add 1/2 cup coconut to the blender, and then add an additional 1/4 to 1/2 cup sprinkled on the top.  You can add different flavorings such as coconut extract, rum extract, almond extract. Very delicious.  I do like it better the next day and when it is well chilled.

I have been making this very recipe for 30 years and my mother since the 60's - my husband & I ate half one nite and half the next - irresistible if you like a coconut custard pie.  Consider a 10 inch pie plate because the 9 inch glass will be almost full to the brim.  It also may take a little longer than 40 mins.

I used a can of light coconut milk which was 1 1/2 cups and added a 1/2 cup of regular milk to make it 2 cups total. I did find that a 9 inch pie plate is to small for this recipe and next time i'm going to use a 10 inch pie plate. I served each slice with a dollop of whipped cream and both me and my husband loved it. It was like my favorite coconut flan at a local resturant, but without the caramel. Thanks for the great and very easy recipe!

Just like mom used to make.  I used 1tsp.vanilla and 1tsp. coconut extract just to bump up flavor a bit.  Turned out great.

Followed the instructions exactly as written but both my husband and I did not enjoy this. We thought it tasted like eggs with coconut on it. Unfortunately, the whole thing ended up in the trash!

I made several changes, and everyone seemed to like it, so I'll give it a 4 star.  I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk.  And instead of using vanilla, I used almond extract.  Bake time was about 50 mins.  I think that it could've gone in for maybe a few more.  I will probably do it again and not use almond milk.

Thanks but NO thanks! You'd better REALLY like an eggy custard (and I cut back 1 egg and added a bit more baking mix). Not much coconut flavor and the so called crust was similar to watery scrambled eggs. What a disappointment after it baked up so beautifully.

YUM!! This is delicious - I made it just for me though; everyone in my house either doesn't like 'custard' desserts or doesn't like coconut so that just means more for me! lol This was so easy to make too, I'll make it again for my friends & myself.

The easiest coconut pie ever!  Very flavorful.  Prepared as written with the exception of baking about  10 extra minutes.  The custard is not too sweet which I prefer.  A big hit with the family!  Thanks so much for the post.

My mom has been making this for years, I call it Mrs McClure's Coconut pie.  She was a neighbor a the cabin that gave my mom the recipe.  It's fast and easy.  I have cravings for it sometimes and it brings back wonderful memories of my childhood.

This is great comfort food. Ingredients I had on hand (but my aking mix was over a year past Use-by date) and turns out yummy. We ate it warm. The little left in the fridge was not so good. Will get more Bisquick and keep this one in mind.

This recipe is clever.  Somehow some of the ingredients collect at the bottom of the pan and create a soft crust.  The coconut floats to the top and turns golden brown.  The center is like a vanilla custard.  I love this recipe!  It's so easy to make!

I made a Gluten Free version. I just substituted the Gluten Free Bisquik for the regular Bisquik. It took extra time to cook. I'm not sure if it was 13 or 18 extra minutes but I think 18. It was absolutely delicious!

This pie is great with all the original ingredients. Whatever you do, don't use Splenda.  Ugh -- I did not care for it when I used 3/4 C. Splenda rather than sugar.

The consistency and the look of the pie was great - even I was impressed at how pretty it looked! But the taste was so-so, maybe it was the ingredients I used but it tasted kinda of rubbery and the hubby commented on the bitter aftertaste.  I'll keep toying with the ingredients and hopefully will get something better.

I've had this recipe for years.  Use Bisquick baking mix. This is the only recipe you need for coconut custard pie.  So quick, easy, and so yummy.

Recipe is very easy to make.  I added additional coconut to the top as it was going in the oven.  I let it bake about 10 additional minutes.  I used a mixer and not the blender and it came out fine.  This recipe tastes more like a custard than a pudding and tasted too much like eggs for my family; however my neighbors thought it was great! It is pretty neat how it makes a "crust" and it looks just like the picture when it is ready to serve.

I lost this recipe and I am so glad I found it here.  This is a wonderful, easy recipe.  It has the taste of egg custard with the crunchy, golden, coconut topping, mmmm, so good.  I prefer to add the coconut in the blender so that it gets chopped a bit.  Warning though, it's addictive!

Great recipe and so easy too. I felt it was a bit eggy tasting and next time will go with the suggestion of many others to try using 3 eggs and upping the coconut. We all enjoyed the pie and one more thing, I had made two, one I kept in the oven a little longer  to crisp the top more and that one was our favorite.

My Mother In Law made this pie for our family, we love Coconut but my kids didn't care for the jellied crust.  It has a defninte egg-y flavor sort of like tapioca.  If I am going to the trouble to bake a pie I would just as soon make a real crust.

Followed this recipe but added a splash of coconut extract to boost the coconut flavor. I love the custard and texture of the shredded coconut. I made it for co-workers and they loved it!

Yumola...I love custard pie.  Actually I love the custard and not do much the crust....well this solves that problem.  It is delicious...just dumped everything in the blender...but I did use almond extract, just because I love that flavor...going back for a second piece...:-)

Made the first one exactly as directed and loved it. The next 3   I added 1/4 cup more sugar. For us this recipe is perfect. Can’t get enough of it.

I've been looking for this recipe for years, and it turned out just like I remembered. I used my mixer instead of a blender and melted the butter for better incorporation. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. It is a smooth, custardy pie that's not too sweet. Three people have already asked me for the recipe. It was a huge hit!

Really good.  Had a very interesting consistency - reminded me of Butter Muchi (Hawaiian dessert).  Followed the recipe with only one minor exception.  I divided the coconut into two 1/2 cup portions - putting 1/2 cup into the batter and the other 1/2 cup on top of the pie. Next time I might toast the coconut that goes in the batter.

I tried making the pie and yes it is a little doughy. I followed the directions accordingly. It could’ve been the bisquick mix vs. flour unsure ??. I will try another recipe to see if there’s a difference in texture.

I generally followed the directions (I used a hand mixer rather than a blender) and this one is a keeper.  My husband isn’t a coconut fan, but even he loves it.  The ingredients are always available in my home and it takes minutes to assemble. The custard is delightful and it’s crazy how the crust magically appears.

I substituted butter milk for regular milk and increased the sugar to one cup. I also added 1 ½ tsp of baking powder. It came out amazingly, I only wish I had taken a photo before it was eaten! I’ll definitely get a photo the next time.

My favorite pie is coconut custard pie. I don’t like pie crust. This is the best pie ever! I ate 2 pieces and would have kept on eating it i had  just finished supper! I did not chane one thing. My pie pan got a little full so I used a small Pyrex bowl and ended up with a “personal” pie.
Thank you for this recipe!

I found this same recipe when I was first married and made it often. That was 46+ years ago and it's still an easy go to dessert. I always have coconut in my freezer and everything else is always a staple here at home. Yummy with fresh fruit !

Easy to make and love the texture (firm) and crust(crusty). The taste was really good as well and I love coconut. In fact I just planted a coconut tree in my backyard! I did turn the oven off about 15 minutes early and left the pie in for about 3 hours (with the oven off) because I had an appointment I needed to keep which might have accounted for the firmness and crusty top, but I really thought that improved the pie as I didn't want a pudding pie!!

Love it, but it's more of a custard, very flan-like, with minimal crust. I subbed flour plus 1/2 teaspoon baking powder for the baking mix (per a recipe for baking mix) and used almond extract as suggested by another reviewer. Really easy and good! Warm was good, but I prefer it fully cool. I will definitely make this again!

So easy. I made slight variations just because of what I had on hand and I have a shallow pie plate.  I made approximate 3/4 of a batch
Used half evaporated skim milk and half coconut milk; used coconut oil instead of butter and used Trader Joe's Pancake Mix. Everything else the same.  Absolutely delicious

It was delicious but I may of put the coconut in the blender also. It ended up like a custard tart with a coconut topping. Is that correct?

I've been making this fast, easy and scrumptious recipe for years. I got it out of one of those 'checkout' paperback cook books, just titled 'Bisquick'. Those little cook books are packed away, so I'm glad I found the recipe here. I could remember what ingredients went into it, but not the exact amounts. Thanks for posting.

I thought it was super,because it takes only about 5 minutes form start to cleanup.  The best custard than you can even make if you stood there stirring forever. I also put the coconut right in the blender with the rest of the ingredients. Terri

I love this recipe.  I was out of vanilla extract one day and used what I had in the pantry...a butter nut extract.  It's delicious using that as well.  Easy easy easy...and good.

This pie was pretty good. Because I had no coconut I used almond extract, sprinkled sliced almonds on the top and after it was baked and cooled I drizzled carmel sauce over top. Delightful.

Very good, easy pie.  Don't fret if you don't have any baking mix on hand, you can also use equal amount of flour for the mix.

My grandmother used to make this pie every year at Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas. I have been looking for the recipe for years and it is my all time favorite pie. It tastes just as good as it did when I was a kid.

My mom and I have been baking this pie for years. We make it for every big holiday and it is always a hit. Make sure you really grease the pie plate or the pie will fall apart when you try to pull it out. It's awesome topped with cool whip!

Thanks for submitting this recipe! I just gave it to my mother who's made it many times during my childhood. This is an easy and delicious treat!
