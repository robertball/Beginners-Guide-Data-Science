Simple, excellent recipe.  I used a 7 lb bird so I threw in some extra garlic, lime and masala.  The smell of the chicken roasting reminded me of apple pie. The masala gives it a nice spice and the lime a tangy kick. You can never use too much garlic and I recommend more than 10 cloves.  A+ Countess, nice job :)

I've made this twice now and both times it came out great.  The smell in the house was amazing and being that I love Garam Masala I was ever so pleased to try this.   Expect a juicey chicen and a great taste from all the garlic and lime combo.   The only thing I did different the 2nd time was add more lime juice prior to putting the rub on and added extra garlic.

I had a 5-1/4lb young chicken and aside from changing the end roasting time-20 min per lb. I too added extra cloves under the skin and some sea salt to the masala. THIS IS AN AWESOME RECIPE- 3 adults devoured the whole thing! This is now a regular in this house. Thank you Countess!!!!!! LOVE IT!

Keeping to my New Years resolution to follow a recipe 100% the first time I try it (though there are ways around that rule).  I just made the chicken and I'm very impressed.  I had to make my own Garam Masala as I didn't have any pre-made.  This was a very educational process.  Just look at the number of Garam Masala recipes on this site alone.  I chose one and loved the results.   Those folks that didn't like this recipe should do some research on how to make your own.  The variations of ingredients mean that every time you make this recipe it can taste different from the last time you made it.  I'm going to use variations on more chicken, shrimp, talapia, etc.  I think this recipe is a true winner for how easy it is to make, yet how complex the flavors can be with some effort.  Thank you Countess!!

Yum! My husband, friends, and I love this unique, flavorful roasted chicken. It is so easy to prepare. The skin roasts perfectly with the lime juice. I only use 1 garlic clove because I don't like too much of it. I press it and then put the little pieces under the skin, rather than whole cloves. Very delicious!

It was my first time cooking a whole chicken and I choose this recipe because it looked simple.  I loved the results! The cooking time was spot on and it was very moist.  I didn't have a lime so I substituted a lemon and it was good.  I also added some cayenne red pepper with the garam masala for some kick.

This was delicious.  What was bad about it was there was not enough for leftovers.  Next time planning to make 2 chickens at once for leftovers.  I made fresh naan and dal and dinner was complete!

What a interesting idea! I left out the lime, as most people said it didn't add anything, made sure to rub the masala UNDER the skin, and stuck some pats of butter in there as well. It went great as a protein bonus for the meat eaters to a vegetarian Indian meal.

The bird turned out nice and moist, but the citrus was hard to define. I used a whole lemon, squeezed it on before the garam masala, then put the rinds inside the cavity. Instead of using the "20 mins per pound" rule, I used a thermometer with an alarm when it hit 180 degrees. Then I let it rest, tented in foil, for 10 mins while I made some pasta as a side. Pretty good; I liked the lack of salt; will probably make again with a tweak or two!

while I have to admit, the house smelled really good while this was cooking, and the breast meat was very juicy, there didn't seem to be any identifiable flavor to it.  Probably will not make it again - too many other recipes to try in my lifetime

All the flavors blended well together and it made the roasted chicken a lot more exciting than normal.  The only things I did differently were to cut up the garlic a bit because my cloves were big and add the lime juice before the garam masala because I didn't want the lime to wash away the spice.

Super easy and really good! But I probably won't bother with the lime next time--it didn't really add anything.

I really wanted to like this recipe because of the garam masala.  I followed it pretty closely (didn't add any other ingredients to "spice it up" as so many reviewers do).  However, instead of cutting into the skin to insert the garlic, I loosened the skin on the breast side and put 10 cloves of garlic in various places under the skin.  It does smell delicious while it's cooking, but I couldn't even taste the lime, and I'm not sure I understand why the chicken is cooked breast side down.  When I flipped it over, the breast side was not very appetizing-looking.  I probably won't make this again.

This is a fantastic way to enjoy a roasted chicken!
I followed the recipe exactly.
My chicken was a 5 lb-er, so the cooking time was longer.
I'll definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe is easy and delicious. Roasting the chicken breast side down kept the white meat juicy, and the garlic cloves inserted under the skin added wonderful flavor. Once the garlic is roasted, it loses its sharpness and becomes mellow. Great eating! I will definitely make this recipe again!

Unique easy recipe, flavor is good and it comes out juicy. Used a 6 pound chicken and added more garlic, one extra lime and another 1/4 cup Garam Marsala. This one’s a keeper!

I wanted to love this chicken for the garam masala, but in the end I couldn't taste much of that or of garlic or of lime. The chicken was tender and nice but not especially flavorful.  I think I will try this combination of flavors on chicken breasts, where every bite will be infused with garam masala.  I don't think I will try it again on a whole chicken.  It did smell wonderful cooking, though.

This roasted chicken was exceptionally moist. Burying the garlic inside gave it zing, but I still found it needed a bit more flavor. Next time, I'd probably include a sprinkle of salt and garlic and/or onion powder along with the garam masla.
