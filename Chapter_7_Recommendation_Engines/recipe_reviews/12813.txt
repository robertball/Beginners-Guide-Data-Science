This recipe didn't turn out well for me.  One problem was that I used wheat bread instead of white, and wheat bread is usually thicker than white bread.  The bread absorbed a LOT of oil, and it was very difficult for my 12-year-old son and me to eat even half of the bread that surrounded the shrimp.  We eventually just pulled the shrimp out of the bread and ate just the shrimp.
