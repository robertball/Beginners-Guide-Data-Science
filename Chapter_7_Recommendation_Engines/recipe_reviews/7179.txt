This is a wonderful recipe.  The dough just gets better as you let it sit in the fridge.  Because it makes so much, you can just pull out what you want to cook, punch the rest down and put it back in the fridge.  You can also make cinnamon rolls out of this recipe as well.  Roll it out into a rectangle, spread butter on it, sprinkle it with cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I also fine chopped some apples and pecans and put in it as well.  Roll up along the long side, pinch and seal the edge, then cut into  inch wide rounds.  Place cut side down on parchment paper and let them rise.  Pop them in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Mix 2 T melted butter, 1 t. vanilla, 1 T milk and enough powdered sugar to make a thick spread and drizzle it on the rolls while they are still hot. Yum!

This recipe is now a family tradition for xmas morning!  Of course...it is going to be made way more often than once a year...I'd be hard pressed to pick out which was Cafe Du Monde's (fresh in the cafe) and which was this recipe in a taste test.    There is a STEP MISSING from the recipe and it is crucial!!  After you have allowed the dough to rise punch out the dough flatten and then allow to rise a SECOND time...only needs to be for an hour.   This will ensure the beignets are full and fluffy inside and not flat and well...not fluffy inside.  Cheers,  Dane

I surprised my husband with a batch of warm beignets.  He was very impressed!  The beignets reminded me of the ones from the original Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.  I didn't feel the flavor was too bland as some readers suggested, but it does require more powdered sugar then the recipe calls for.  I'll probably add a little vanilla to enhance the flavor next time.  Sorry I missed the hint about putting the powdered sugar in a brown bag.  I had powdered sugar all over my counter and floor.  Definitely a keeper!  P.S.  Since I was unable to use all the dough in one batch, I stored the remainder in the refrigerator overnight.  The second batch of beignets came out just as crisp and moist as the first.   day.

Anything French in nature can be daunting...(even French toast for me sometimes)!  However, these aren't really that hard to make!    Here are some things I learned from this recipe which may seem like a no-brainer to many, but I wasn't really sure having not ever fried in oil before.    *Use a quart saucepan - not a frying pan.  I know, seems silly, but maybe this will help someone.    *I didn't use an entire packet of yeast, but am wondering if it really would have mattered much.  It calls for 2 1/4 tsp and there's a bit more than that in the packet.    *Don't just wait for the beignets to float to the top, they really need to plump.  Make sure you flip them over so one side won't over cook.    *Don't cut the pieces too small - they'll cook too quickly and not plump.    *I didn't refrigerate the first "test" round and they turned out 90% correct.  The second batch - fine - after refrigeration.    *Am certain that butter would be fine instead of shortening.  It's really just needing the fat component in the recipe at that point.    *I used wax paper and a dusting of flour to pat out my dough.  I used a pizza cutter to make the squares.    *Be sure to use a paper bag with powdered sugar to toss/shake the cooked beignets.  Super easy and less mess.  Don't use a ziploc - they will stick to the sides.    I hope this helps other beignet novices out there!  I will make these again each year for Mardi Gras!

Excellent recipe that everyone from small children to grandparents love.  I SUBSTITUTED BUTTER FOR SHORTENING because they have found that trans fats (hydrogenated oils like shortening and margarine) are unhealthy. 

Otherwise, they were excellent, easy, and kept in the fridge for about a week as a ball of dough.  This recipe yields a lot more than 10 servings, I think.

Didn't have evaporated milk, so I did the cardinal sin, and replaced it with sweetened condensed.

Turned out beautifully. Just needed to get the chicory coffee out. :)

Great recipe.

These remind me somewhat of Funnel Cake, these are less messy and very good. Great with a little added vanilla extract and sprinkled with cinnnamon/sugar! Could pipe in French Cream Filling or Almond Custard Filling found on this site (fruit/fruit fillings would be good also)

I am a Yankee farm girl who married a ragen cajun LOL. I had very little knowledge of traditional New Orleans food. I made these for my husband and asked him what he thought. He danced around and yelled BON BON and gave me a big kiss. He grabbed a plate full a cup of coffee and headed to his favorite chair! He looked like a four year old who just got a puppy for christmas! Guess that about says it all! Thanks so much, you saved my yankee hide! LOL

Yum!!  This was so easy.  I didn't refrigerate this dough at all and it was still easy to work with.  I was able to inject creme and jelly filling in these too because they puff nicely.  If you have a doughnut cutter, roll the dough to about 1/2 inch, they make great doughnuts too.

These were great, light and fluffy.  They reminded me more of what I got in New Orleans at Cafe du Monde than their mix does.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Keeping the oil just right was kind of tricky. Too hot and they don't get crispy, too cold and they don't puff up. Once I got the right temperature they were great.
I have to say I liked the ones in New Orleans better, but maybe that's because I didn't have to do the work.

Great!  Reminded my husband and me of sitting at Cafe du Monde in the Big Easy.  Only thing is, as written, the beignets are a little bland.  I added 1 cup of confectioners sugar.  Maybe a little vanilla extract would help, too?  But, the texture is to die for, so I still give it 5 stars.  Oh, also, it doesn't seem to make sense to put a yeast dish in the fridge, but don't worry.  The yeast is more for the yeasty flavor than the rising ability.  I put it in the fridge overnight and it still rose a little.  Also, don't be afraid to add up to an extra cup of flour to make it into a workable dough--it didn't affect the quality of mine at all.  Thanks for a great version of this secret recipe!

wonderful, light and yummy! i used butter, and they were very good.  i used my 'fry-baby', and they cooked up in just minutes. my batch made waaaaay more than i thought it would, so i have followed another reviewers suggestion and made up some cinnamon rolls. they are rising in the fridge to bake off in the morning. thanks for an excellent recipe! UPDATE: the cinnamon rolls were unbelievable! so delicious, yeasty, moist, the best i have ever had.  made the beignets again for a large group, and they all raved--especially the ones who had eaten the ones at cafe du monde. thanks so much for this recipe, i am making the dough now for a batch of cinnamon buns!

I loved these.  I think they were better than the beignets they serve up the street from my house.  Just make sure you add about 1-2 Tablespoons (yes I said tablespoons) of vanilla, it will give it the kick it needs and use more powdered suger.  Another note, make sure the dough is not too thick when you roll it out, or they will be too doughy in the inside.

I did not enjoy this recipe.  It was easy, if a bit time consuming, to make.  I found the beignets were very bland.  My husband liked them, though, so that's why I gave it 4 stars.  Next year I'm going to Mardi Gras, so then I can try the original.

I agree with the others that said this was a bland dough.  I even added some vanilla extract into the mix.  If i tried these again, i would add more sugar, salt, and butter (instead of shortening).  This makes a ton of dough; I halved the batch and will end up making around 30-40 of them.  Make sure they are rolled out relatively thin, they poof up quite a bit.  My husband thought they were better with maple syrup on top of the powdered sugar on them.

Made beignets one morning and they were very good but had lots of dough sitting in the fridge for more than a week. I read another reviewer who said the dough makes great cinnamon rolls so I decided to try. 
The dough rolled out beautifully even though it was in the fridge under plastic wrap for at least 10 days. It took a little longer for them to rise but they are in the oven now and looking delicious. Amazing.

Wow...my husband and daughter loved having a New Orleans type breakfast this morning, complete with a chickory blend of coffee that I happened to have. Been to Cafe DuMonde too many times to count and they said these were even better. For most of them, I used the traditional powdered sugar, and a few with cinnamon/sugar mixture. After cutting them with a pizza cutter, I let them sit for about 15 minutes while finishing up the bacon and when they cooked, they quadrupled in size--just beautiful. I am definitely going to take the previous reviewer's advise and make cinnamon-pecan rolls with the rest tomorrow. And maybe next time a spinach/mushroom type mixture since it's not sweet unless coated with sugar.  This is absolutely a great find.

Wow!!!! These were sooooooooooo  yummy!! I'm catering a series of dinners, and we had a Mardi-Gras themed dinner on Mardi Gras (duh), and I couldn't figure out what to make for dessert. Then I came across this recipe! How could I forget beignets? I made a double batch of the dough, put it in the fridge, and then rolled them out and fried them out fresh at the dinner. They were a monster hit. However, the recipe serving size is waaaaay off! I almost made a triple recipe because I was cooking for 50-60 people. I'm glad I only made a double recipe! I was frying up beignets for over an hour, and probably got 150 - 200 out of this, if I had to guess. But don't worry, every last one got eaten about 20 seconds after getting dusted with powdered sugar :)  I did add a touch of cinnamon to the powdered sugar. Wonderful!!!

Delicious!  Only comment is that I made a half batch and it makes a TON of beignets.  Not sure what a portion is, but I probably could have made 50 or so from a half batch...

Very nice.  Not too much work either since you break up the work from the night to the morning.  That being said... this did make an awful lot though.  10 servings???  WOW.  I found the exact same recipe elsewhere online and it says that it makes FIVE DOZEN.  I will probably half this recipe next time.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe pleased a crowd of beignet-lovers for Christmas breakfast. Thanks so much for the recipe!  I am a believer in trying a recipe as it's written when I first make it, and make adjustments in subsequent attempts. But after reading reviewer comments, I did add one teaspoon of vanilla. Perfect!

Made these today. The only modification I made, other than halving the recipe.. was adding 1 tsp of vanilla. Everyone raved about them!!! My only problem was that some of them didn't puff up. I know that probably had to do w/my inexperience frying things, and I only let them sit in the fridge for about an hr, so I didn't knock a star off. LOL.

This recipe is a good beignet recipe. Its a good idea to follow this recipe and chill the dough for 24 hours instead of letting it rise like other recipes. Adding vanilla was a great idea but it needs to be more than half a teaspoon, otherwise you can't taste it. When I made them I made about 5 dozen if they are cut into two by two squares. But it depends on how thin the dough is rolled out and the size of the squares. Cook them in the oil for about 30 seconds on each side in 360 degree oil. Super Yummy! Love them!

Wow! To the people saying this recipe is bland, you are obviously NOT from Louisiana! They are not supposed to really have a flavor! That's what the powdered sugar is for! I thought these were delicious!

Okay. My 3 year old daughter LOVES The Princess & The Frog...she asked if I could make these, so I found this recipe. This was my FIRST ever attempt at both making anything using yeast/rising AND first time ever deep frying! It came out beautifully!!!   I didn't have any confectioners' sugar, so I made a granulated sugar/cinnamon mixture to roll them in, it was verrrry good. Almost like a mix between a doughnut and a churro!   Also, instead of cutting them into squares, I used a little cup that was about 2" in diameter and just used it like a cookie cutter...this made the process VERY fast! It made about 60-70 beignets. Next time, I'm going to try the powdered sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe and for helping me break my yeast and frying phobia, my husband will be very happy. =)

Yummy! I don't have anything to compare this to since I've never had a beignet before. But these are so good. Lightly crispy on the outside and soft and yummy on the inside. I didn't have any evaporated milk and I was out of milk so I used heavy cream, its all I had. Also subbed butter for the shortening. Again because its what I had. The dough is super sticky so make sure that you really flour everything real well or you will frustrate yourself trying to scrape the dough off the table and the rolling pin and yourself!

I've never been to New Orleans so I have nothing to compare these with. That being said, how can you go wrong??? It's fried dough! I was looking for something to meet the "fried in oil" tradition of Hanukkah without my inlaws tradition of Dunkin' Donuts; hence the beignets. The dough was very easy to work with and I rolled these out and had them cut up and ready to go hours before dessert. That way they were fresh and hot and oh so yummy when were were ready for dessert. I made these last night dusted with powdered sugar but had way too much dough for our small family so I covered and fridged the rest for the next day (if you do this, make sure they are well dusted top and bottom with flour so they don't stick). Today I fried up some more (they puffed up just as lovely as yesterday) and sprinkled them with granulated sugar, perhaps tomorrow I'll try cinnamon sugar. My hubby who misses his traditional D.D. jelly donut put jelly in the middle of 1 uncooked piece of beinet dough and topped with another piece of dough and pinched it all the way around and fried it up, then dredged in sugar. YUMMY! My son just came in from college class and threw in a few to fry for a snack and he concurs, 5 stars!!We have definitely left beignet tradition but I love a recipe that I can play with and create my own twist. Thanks Regina, my who family enjoyed playing with this!

The word beignet (pronounced bey-YAY) comes from the early Celtic word bigne meaning "to raise." It is also French for "fritter." Beignets, a New Orleans specialty, are fried, raised pieces of yeast dough, usually about 2 inches in diameter or 2 inches square. After being fried, they are sprinkled with sugar or coated with various icings.
No matta how ya do it its yum!

These turned out great!!  I read all reviews before I made them to learn from those who had already.  The only change I made to the recipe was adding just a tad of vanilla.  I took the advice of someone who reviewed previously and punched the dough down the next morning and gave it another hour to rise.  I feared the sticky mess I would create in the kitchen and therefore did not roll and cut the dough.  I spooned it out and made in ball forms of about an inch.  It made tons!  Shared with several neighbors who were all delighted!  I made half with powdered sugar and half with cinnamon sugar.  Definitely will make again.  Next time will try to roll and cut in squares!  My hubby is from New Orleans and loved them!

Make sure to roll 'em out 1/4 inch, not too thick. Then let 'em rise awhile so they won't be quite so dense.

The dough could use some spices to bring out a little flavor. I think next time I'll add some lemon or orange peel.

My family absolutely love these.  I made them right after we saw The Princess and the Frog, as requested by my 5-yo daughter.  They are now a family favorite!  I will be making the dough with her this afternoon and then cook them tonite for dessert.  Just make sure your oil is NICE and HOT!  Love them!!

Kimberely, your photo is beautiful and very professional looking! I made these last Spring when my sister got me some Chicory coffee from New Orleans. I have never had the famous ones in New Orleans, so I didn't have anything to compare them to. I thought they were very good, my husband thought they were a bit doughy.

This was a great substitute recipe.  I usually buy the mix from a local dealer that handles Cafe du Monde products. They were out of the mix due to the hurricane and so I tried this recipe.  Very yummy.  My only suggestion would be to put the powdered sugar in a brown lunch bag, place the beignets in the bag and shake.

fantastic! These make a TON! followed another posters advised and used the remaining dough to make cinnamon rolls 2 days later and they too were amazing, great texture/flavor. These are best made into smaller beignets than the ones they make at Cafe du Monde. and I need way more powder sugar, that might be a personal preference though. So yum! alone or dipped in thick hot chocolate or coffee. (my dad's from Louisiana & I lived in France, so I know what I'm talking about! :)

My neighbors, hubby and kids all loved this recipe.  My first batch (20) rose beautifully in the fridge.  However, I rolled it out too thin so there was a crispy outside with nothing in the middle.  I used the left over dough for cinnamon rolls (10 -fabulous) and another batch of beignets (40).  The left overs don't rise as well after being in the freezer but rolling them out a little thicker sure helped the insides.  Not as good as the Disneyland beignets we had last week...but fabulous!!

I was looking for the recipe from The Jazz Kitchen in Downtown Disney and noticed this recipe is very similar to the one posted on The Jazz Kitchen's website. My beignets didn't come out as fluffy or as soft as the one in DTD, but it was still good. Next time, I'm going to add a bit of vanilla (like others have suggested) and 1 more tbs of evaporated milk because my dough came out a little hard and dry. Maybe it's because I used my kitchen aid mixer to blend all the ingredients together...hand mixing dough always comes out with better results. Also, please note that this recipe is massive, even when I halved it. I need suggestions as to what to do with the extra dough!

I have improved this already good recipe by cutting the sugar to  1/3rd cup and adding 3 teaspoons of malt powder plus a splash of vanilla extract.  Fried in lard - what else?  Yummy.

PERFECT! Made some today and they are so so so beautiful and delicious. I'm impressed and so is everybody. i halved the recipe and left dough in the fridge for 48hrs or longer as I realized I didn't have enough flour for rolling the dough and oil for frying ;p Love how 'light' they are, hollow inside and crunchy on the outside. words dont do these gems justice. I'm so thankful for this recipe. until my hubby and i can afford a trip to new orleans, we'll make these often ;) thank you thank you!!!

I am from Louisiana and have been in Georgia for 8 years.  I missed beignets so much and was unsuccessfull in finding a worthy recipe, but this one is wonderful!  Tastes just like it did when we had them for school breakfast and at many dine-ins.  Great Job!  This one's a keeper!

This was quiet an experience. I had to figure out what size worked for me, but they were wonderful when I got the hang of it. I surprised my Zasha with these, as he always talks about "Beignets from Brocato's" in New Orleans, of which he has very fond childhood memories. Against such tough expectations, this recipe measured up. And that's saying a lot!

Made 1/2 batch today as a trial run for a Super Bowl party next weekend.  Made the recipe exactly as printed and they came out great!!  What I found out:  make sure to roll the dough thin so they cook all the way through; flipping them a few times during cooking browns them evenly; remove them from the oil when they turn golden brown (we didn't like the more done ones); next time I'm going to add cinnamon to the dough for a different twist on the original.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Another review from a south Louisiana native who knows what a beignet should taste like.  This recipe was pretty good, but not the same as cafe du monde in NOLA nor the cajun village in Sorrento.  With that in mind, it wasn't worth all the effort.  I guess if I'm desperate for beignets, I might make it again someday, but it took at least 2 hours, maybe more, to make dough, roll it out, and then deep fry.  Not to mention additional time for kitchen clean up (children + powdered sugar = total mess).  Way too much time for me to invest in a recipe that falls short of the real thing.  Also, I fried in canola oil, because that was all I had on hand, and I suspect that had something to do with the lack luster results.  Vegetable oil probably would give a better taste.

These tasted awesome! They tasted really good warmed up.  Drizzle with honey and sift on powdered sugar.  Delish!

Hey, I used Paula Deen's recipe and they are exactly the same! The thinner you roll the dough squares, the more they puff up. But don't roll the dough out super thin, or the puffs will pop. The beignet themselves aren't really sweet, so add lots of powdered sugar!

Delcious!  The recipe is huge.  I would say it makes 100 servings.  Don't know what I will do with all the batter!   Oh, yes I do.   I'll make different shapes, sizes, make some cinnimon rolls.  Such a nice fluffy outcome.  I did add 2 Tablespoons Cook's Bourbon Vanilla and some Cook's Lemon.  Wow!  Any favorite flavor will be nice.    For a rougher edge when some were about half cooked I removed them and opened  them in half and  placed  them back into the hot oil... mmmm nice and held the powdered sugar so nicely in the crunchy crevices.  Be nice to make a thin powdered icing to drizzle over them too... Even Chocolate in it...   Drizzle melted chocolate morsels over some....  Great recipe

Very close to Cafe Du Monde beignets and very easy to prepare. (Much better than the mix they sell at Cafe Du Monde.) Now I have something to hold me over until the next time I get to New Orleans! Thank you.

These Beignets were the best I've had with out actually going to Cafe Du Monde, I'm glad that I can still have warm, light beignets living in Montana! I couldn't figure out how long to chill for so I settled on about an hour and a half.

excellent recipe!  the only change I made was to put more than enough powdered sugar in a brown paper bag, put each beignet into the bag after sitting on paper towels, and shake them so that they are completely covered in the sugar.  it's hard to be cafe du monde, but these are still wonderful and reminiscent of the originals. :)

Delicious! I've never heard of these so-called doughnuts before. They taste a bit bland without the sugar, but once you top 'em with it, great! I roll them in sugar while they're still warm so the sugar sticks to the doughnuts better. I love it that way. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Definitely will make again :0)

*** update:
this time i kicked it up a notch by coat the beignets with powdered sugar blitzed with nuts and cinnamon. they were superb!

I loved these beignets...very tasty and easy to cook. BUT the amount in the recipe makes a HUGE amount...I made them for my baby shower and with 20+ people there were still leftovers. I would definitely recommend cutting the amounts (at least) in half.

They aren't to sweet, so my family really liked it. However, next time I'd add some cinnamon or something, the doughnuts were too plain for me.

These beignets are really, really good. I've make them a couple times and though they are time consuming, they are so worth the effort. They only down side of this recipe (if it could be considered a downside), it makes a lot of beignets, so be prepared for leftovers.

I added vanilla to the dough as others suggested. I think I may have punched it down and let them rise too many times. They were not as light as I thought they would be. But, I am willing to try these goodies again!

F A B U L O U S!!!!!   My husband ate about a dozen of these.  I made only half the recipe and I still got alot.  They are so light in the center and a bit cripsy on the outside......mmmm.  I did add some vanilla extract to my batter.  Delicious!!!  I've made these so many times now and they NEVER fail to deliver.  You can use powdered sugar, brown sugar or vanilla sugar to coat them.  Hubby loves them with brown sugar.  Delish!

Good recipe. Make sure to let the dough rise atleast once before refrigerating. When youget ready to us it let it warm a bit before frying.  Makes big puffy beignets. Served them for Book Club when our monthly choice was "Zeitoun" set in New Orleans.

Great sleepover snacks AND for breakfast the next day!! Added 1/2 tsp vanilla as suggested in previous reviews. Tossed them in a cinnamon/sugar mixture in a brown paper bag and VOILA!! My kids L-O-V-E these and ask for them often. Good to know you don't have to use the whole batch but can save it in the fridge for another day.

Really pretty easy to make, and my house full of teenagers loved it.  I was more like meh.  Kind of tasted like fried bread and less like a doughnut to me.  I'll make it again because it's so easy and the kids were so happy.  Might try cinnamon with the powedered sugar.

This was a fantastic recipe. I have never had beignets before, but this has sold me on them. I suggest making sure they turn dark brown when they are frying to make sure they are cooked inside. Will definitely make again.

after much thought I am giving this two stars and I will explain why.  the dough turned out really awful and had to use almost another 3 cups of flour to get it to do anything and then all I could do was pinch it off and drop it in the frying pan.  well I finished frying them handed one to the hubby to taste and they were all doughy on the inside.  :( so I reheated the oil split them in half and went about frying them all over again.  got about 20 done and the smoke detector started going off.  apparently my oil DIDNOT want to try again.  and i don't think i do either at least with this recipe.  i am not even going to tell ya'll about the mess thats now in the kitchen.  the reason i gave it 2 stars were because the 10 that turned out right were good.

I made this recipe with my French students and they were in love! The whole hallway smelled like fried food though and I had to appease the other teachers by giving them lots of samples! I took the advice to let the dough rise again after punching it down the first time. I'm not sure what a difference it really made since it didn't rise much afterwards. I may try to grease the bowl before placing the dough in it to rise. It was difficult to scrape it off the sides.

Absolutely amazing!!!!  I've never had the beignets in New Orleans but I think these taste great.  They are like mini-fried doughs from fairs.  The recipe yields a very large amount so I actually freeze a portion and make them later.

Fabulous!  I'll admit that I was nervous when I let the dough sit overnight and it looked like bread-  but I fried it up and it was just like how I remember  them tasting.  The neighbors were impressed!

Just made these yesterday and they were very good. I've never had actual beignets so do not have anything to compare.  My kids helped "decorate" them.  I gave one a brown bag with powdered sugar and one with cinnamon and sugar.  Then for fun my son got a bowl of chocolate frosting we made and my daughter got a strawberry (she loves everything pink!).  The whole time they kept saying how this was so much fun while their mouths were stuffed with a new beignet. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this recipe at least three times and then I started about changing it up a bit. I add a teaspoon of vanilla. When I roll out the dough I spread a cinnamon and raisin filling on the dough, as well as brown sugar, about a 1/4 inch of a loose sprinkling , roll it into a log, slice into 1/2 thick rounds, let them rise a bit and drop them in hot oil or place them on parchment paper and bake.  Great breakfast rolls.
I've also made a cinnamon raisin brown sugar loaf of of bread. I rolled out the 14x9 rectangle (1/4 to 1/2 inch thick)put butter on it and spread the topping. I roll up this up and place it seam side down in buttered bread pans...wow!!
Update: I made another batch of dough this afternoon and rolled it out, cut them into beignet shape. I got out a paper plate and some parchment paper. I made a few layers of diamonds with parchment paper between each layer. I put a plate on top (upside down )secured them with a couple of rubber bands for freezing. Now I can cook up as few as I want each morning and they'll last about a month.

OMG! Thank you so much for this recipe...... it may not be Cafe Monde but it is really close. I added 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract to the batter and topped these off with powder sugar and cinnamon.  I will definitely make again.

I made this as written, except I did punch down the dough and let it sit another 30-40 minutes before going on to the final step. The pastry is light, slightly crunchy and a wonderful texture, but I did think a little vanilla as others suggested would have given it the flavor I was looking for.  Overall a great recipe.  In my opinion it just needed a slight bit more sweetness other than the powdered sugar.   Also, it makes a ton of dough.  I am going to try making the cinnamon rolls tomorrow as another reviewer suggested, or maybe some funnel cakes for later tonight?

This is a great recipe! My whole family loves this. It does make a lot but it lasts a nice while in the fridge. Someone else said they used this basic dough (extra dough) and made cinnamon rolls. I tried it and they came out wonderful as well. Nice use of the extra dough for something different. Be sure you have plenty of people to eat this because it does make a lot!

This was an excellent recipe ! My beignets came out perfect !!! It was my first time making them and I will definitely be using this recipe in the future to make more :) P.S. You probably will not use all the dough in one night and if you put a little flour on your hands it makes it easy to manage the dough especially if you don't want to refrigerate it for 24 hours. Other than that enjoy because I know my family and I did .

Followed the recommendiations of letting it rise and also the cinammon roll dough. I have to say this in my new recipe for cinammon rolls. The secret to great cinammon rolls, fyi is brown sugar and real butter.

These have been a special treat in my family since I was young.  We have a family campout every summer & my Mom mixes the dough ahead of time & stores it in a cooler. We use a propane deep fryer to make them outdoors for the 30-40 hungry campers at break-fast time.  They're always a hit!

Delicious!! I make these before I got to enjoy the real thing at Cafe du Monde, while I was enjoying the beignets at the cafe I was amazed at the familiarity, thanks for this recipe! Can't wait to try it with a touch of vanilla

I don't want to rate anything or add it to my recipe file until after we've tried it at least once.  This should be added in ALL CAPS with a minimum of 10 stars.  These are as good as they get.  My whole family says "Thank you"!!

I was weary of how they would turn out because my dough looked like a mess...but they turned out great! I will definitley be making them again. Delicious and very easy.  I also added almond extract to the dough for a little extra flavor.

These were a HUGE hit at a recent brunch.  I definitely concur that you'll need more confectioner's sugar than the recipe calls for.  Also, the recipes claims that it serves ten with the proportions provided. For me, the recipe made roughly 60 2" x 2" beignets.  Thanks for sharing!

I don't know.  I must have done something wrong, but these didn't turn out how I would have liked.  Bland, even though I added more vanilla and sugar.  I heated the oil to the required temp, but they still were somewhat gooey  (read: uncooked)on the inside.  Finally I made very tiny balls, but they just didn't seem right.  Will try again, though.

I've been to New Orleans and loved the beignets but these were not at all like I remember.  They could use something because they were very bland tasting.  I didn't even finish frying all of them because I was so disappointed with the results.  Maybe that's why everyone else doctored them up with other things.  They could have used some vanilla or serve them with jelly. I won't make again. Sorry. I had such high hopes.

This is a great recipe! It is a large recipe so I froze it in three freezer bags and made one each weekend. They were a BIG hit with family and friends. I rolled them in powdered sugar twice, once right after they drained and again when they had cooled. Wonderful with Cafe au Lait.

As a native of southern louisiana who has lived in a city near new orleans all my life, I can say these are fairly decent beignets.  They can't compare to cafe du monde, or the festivals beignets, but they are not bad.  Need lots and lots of powdered sugar though.  More than the recipe lists.

excellent! i didn't have a thermometer, but i heated the oil on medium heat and it gave the beignets a nice golden color. the chilled dough didn't hold its shape though, so it worked better to roll the dough out and place it on a cookie sheet in the freezer for about 10 minutes beforehand.

Superb! The trick is to let the dough rest enough and then roll it out thin, so the beignets puff up and end up more airy than doughy. That way, this recipe made us about 200 of them! (You can store the dough in the fridge for a couple of days if you don't want to make all of them at once. It only gets better.) We added some vanilla sugar we had in the house (made with real vanilla beans) to the confectioner's sugar dusting, and it just gave the beignets an ever so sophisticated fragrance and taste.

Hi Y'All,

I think you forgot a step.

The dough should be proofed so it can rise a bit before refrigerating (or not if you don't want to).

If you get these in the French Market, they are usually pretty puffy.

Add Vanilla and a pinch of ginger or cardamom for more flavor.

Thanks for this recipe.

My mom, an avid baker, was always whipping up a variety of yeast-based breads while I was growing up. There is almost nothing more heartwarming than the smell! Naturally, I wanted to replicate that delicious yumminess as an adult, but I always failed to make an airy and delicious bread. I've always blamed it on the fact that I don't have a mixer or bread machine to do all the work for me, so I have do the mixing and kneading by hand. This recipe is the first recipe that allowed for that and turned out beautifully. I will say that I deviated slightly from the recipe (although I don't imagine by much--I just didn't measure it) as I put in the whole packet of yeast.  I let the dough refrigerate for 24 hours before punching it down and letting it rise for another hour in the fridge before frying up those puppies--perfection! As many other reviewers noted, this recipe makes A TON of dough, so I too tried a few different ideas mentioned by previous reviewers. For baking the other tasty bites, I pulled a piece of the dough and let it sit on the floured counter, covered, for about 10 min before working it into whatever new iteration is would be fore the day. On day 3 I made cinnamon rolls with oven at 375 for 20 min (or about when I started to smell the amazing aroma wafting from my kitchen). Then day 4 were the meat pies--this time setting the oven at 350 and baked for about 20. NOTES: For everything I baked, I did make sure to roll the dough quite thinly because it rises and fluffs

Great base recipe!  This recipe made a TON, so I plan on keeping half of the dough in the fridge hopefully until next weekend. 

I did make some substitutions...instant yeast (which is all I had)- 1.5t. I did not have evaporated milk so I used the substitution of 3/4c whole milk and 1/4c half and half. I subbed butter for shortening, added a splash of vanilla, and a little bit more flour than called for-maybe 2-4T more, just to make the dough more workable. 

Since this was my first time to make them, the sizes of mine were very irregular but they turned out great! I did coat with powdered sugar in a paper bag, which made for much less mess. These were great!

Added a teaspoon of vanilla extract as many suggested. This recipe is a win! Made it a few times for family and it's still top of hubby's request list. Made me a super mom too as the boys totally worship me when I make these :) thanks for sharing.

Perfect recipe. It a large amount of dough so if you intend to make these for two or three people I suggest cutting the recipe in fourths. Other than that it was just like my mom used to make for me on Sundays every once in awhile as a kid.

Loved this.  I found them easy to make and they were delicious.  It makes a ton of dough though, a lot more than what my small family could eat, so I am going to try the cinnamon roll idea, that another member suggested, with the left over dough.

This was an excellent recipe with very easy to use instructions. I followed what a couple other reviewers said and added a teaspoon of vanilla and some cinnamon. I also let it refrigerate over night and let it rise twice, I don't know if that changed anythingn since this was my first time making them but they were really good to me! I had them with milk and raspberry jam which was amazing! This recipe does make A LOT of dough so I used the rest of it to make cinnamon rolls which turned out beautifully. I will definitely be using this for holidays and other family gatherings.

I halved the recipe and accidentally added about 1/4 cup too much evaporated milk so I had to add more flour so it wasn't too sticky. It's in the refrigerator now and tomorrow I will make them. I can only hope they turn out alright...

The BEST Biegnets ever! May need more flour, but should be very slack. Use lard. Cut recipe in half for 4 servings. Needs to be rolled out very thin. Cut in wedge-shapes to flip easily in deep fat fryer. Roll out extra dough and freeze on plastic wrap. Do not sub for condensed milk.

The recipe itself was easy and the result was awesome. So before I made this, I read as many reviews and followed every tips. Still some of my beignets was too thick and didn't cook all the way and at first my oil was on high 400 degree and some of my first batch was cooking too fast and doughy. Just keep in mind to roll it thin and make sure your oil is very hot and lower it down to 350 before you put the first batch.  Another thing, don't get freak out when your dough rise so high, mine did and I was freaking out!!

DELICIOUS!!! My family loved them!! I'm making more of them as we speak! I also tried stuffing them! Just put a piece of chocolate onto one of the Beignets, then place another Beignet on top. Pinch the edges then fry as you regularly would. Dust with powdered sugar and enjoy a chocolate filled Beignet!! Or you can fry them like the recipe says, then pinch a small hole in the bottom or the side and fill with pudding or custard using a pastry bag! My family enjoys them with chocolate pudding the most!

These beignets were wonderful, and the dough had great flavor!
 I had never eaten a beignet before, and was used to the taste of the Mexican dessert, sopapillas (which haven't much flavor in the dough.)
I like these much, much better than sopapillas! I am glad I tried them! :)

This is the first time I've made these. They came out with a nice little crunch to it and hollow in the middle. It required a lot of powdered sugar to get sweetness, otherwise they're just little bland puffs. But they're good! A nice glaze will go well on top! I'm going to try a suggestion to bake them with things in it. Also, my dough was in the fridge for a few days! this really puffed up nicely and I have so much left over. Not sure what to do with it beside trying to make cinammon rolls or something. Also, I sprinkled a few with cinammon and powdered sugar. So good!

LOVED this recipe - I used butter instead of shortening, and I think the flavor was the better for it.  I'm thinking of trying almond and vanilla flavoring in the future, but neither are really necessary.  It was so easy to just stir up the batter and have it be ready the next day!

I live in Mexico city and last year my husband and I went to New Orleans to visit our relatives and they took us to the traditional café where the original beignets are served. I loved them and this recipe made me feel like I was there again. But if I'm 100% honest, this recipe is even better. Congratulations!!

These are good. Like other reviewers I used sweetened condensed milk because it's what I had in my pantry.  I sprinkled some with powdered sugar and some with cinnamon granulated sugar. My family liked the cinnamon better.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These were delicious!! I was in the same boat as another reviewer who didn't have evaporated milk. I used sweetened condensed milk instead and they turned out just fine. I used a small star cookie cutter and they were so cute! They were puffy and golden. Also, we tried topping them with hot fudge and it was fantastic. I would highly recommend this recipe!

Great recipe.  I think that substituting condensed milk for evaporated milk, as one  reviewer did, is an excellent choice.

Well, I have never had a beignet, so I guess I didn't know exactly what to expect... but we didn't really like these.  I added cinnamon and extra sugar to the dough so they would be sweet, but they still weren't.  If it weren't for a ton of powdered sugar, we wouldn't have eaten a single one.  I guess I was hoping the beignet itself would be a little more flavorful.  Sorry!

These were really good.  Only reason they didn't score 5/5 stars is because they weren't quite as wonderful cold as they were fresh and hot from the oil.

NICE! One of the nicest and easiest sweet donut recipes I have seen....

I understand that if you have these with chicory coffee the calories and fat don't count (at least that's what I tell myself)....this will be a weekend tradition even if we just make a small batch and have no company.

I'm a dad suddenly learning to do a lot of different recipes for my kids and I've made beignets before but this recipe doesn't say anything about letting yeast rise, when it has risen and what it should look like to avoid a bad mixture, oddly enough it also says to shove it in the fridge for up to 24 hours? So how long does it take for it to be ready to use? because other recipes say to let it rise for 1 to 2 hours in a warm place so this seems counter productive. Sorry but this recipe seems to just shove everything into a bowl and even the pictures of the completed beignets don't look appetizing and i feel like I'm setting myself up for failure by cooking it your way despite what the reviews say definitely not tailed for a novice like myself because ive had to google the yeast components and the mixture raising parts of it when I think it should be noted some where. 
Other beignet recipes turned out great so I'm not sure this is the recipe for me.

Too light and fluffy to be the real thing that I already miss - I've heard they use rye flour among others which might help achieve what I'm looking for. Either way this is a pretty great recipe, I halved it and left it in the fridge overnight to make the next morning. I just patted it out in golf ball sized handfuls with a bunch of flour before frying. For people new to making doughnuts this is a really quick and simple one

Obviously everyone who said this was a bland dough has not had beignets. It's the same principle as cream puffs or pie crust. 
The sweetness is from the topping or filling. 
Don't tweak or add to this recipe. It's perfect.

It was a huge gooey mess. No way could I even puck it up, much less roll it out. I know I measured right. It just didn’t work. I was really disappointed and so were my guests. I used a whole lot more flour to give it more body but I still couldn’t roll it out. I’ve only been cooking for 60 years so I’m not inexpert. I wonder if there is just too much liquid. I double checked all ingredients. Too bad

Great! I added 1/2 tsp to the dough.  Halved the recipe and made half the dough into beignets one morning and the rest of the dough into cinnamon rolls the next morning. Served a family of 4 well :) thank you for the recipe!

I  made a few beignets from this and decided it was just too much work keeping the temperature right.  They were as I expected them to taste.  The remaining dough sat untouched in the fridge for at least 4 days.  I used the rest of the dough using as little extra flour as possible to roll out for cinnamon rolls.  I read in a cinnamon roll recipe to add about half of a cup of heavy cream over the cinnamon rolls before baking.  They were so good!!!!  I made a simple powdered sugar icing for the top.  Baked at 400 for maybe 14 minutes.  I did add vanilla and extra sugar to the original dough .

The beignets were a hit. I sprinkled each of them with powdered sugar. Some of them I drizzled honey over. Others I filled the insides with Nutella. Delicious all around!

When I cut this recipe in half I made these changes 
1.5 teaspoon of yeast 
1 cup of sugar
1/2 teaspoon of vanilla bean paste 
1/2 teaspoon of Saigon Cinnamon 
3 tablespoons of salted butter 

I let the dough rest 18+ hours then used a Mickey shaped cookie cutter to cut and serve. Very light and airy. This half recipe made around 18-20 which was perfect for our dinner for four.

No changes.  Delicious.  Just got back from New Orleans.  Wanted to try.  Was great.  Like sopaipillas but added richness of eggs and evaporated milk.

I made this yesterday, chilled it overnight and deep fried them...dough was so sticky I couldn't roll - added flour.  Consistency was not workable.  Made a few odd pieces - really bad news.  Completely tasteless, except for sugar.

Last year we visited cafe du monde way too many times on our trip to New Orleans. My son has been asking for beignets ever since. New Years morning I finally whipped up a batch. Here’s what I learned-1- ADD VANILLA!!!2- Dough was really sticky so I added an extra cup of flour. It helped but I ultimately add more flour again anyways as I roll it out using a floured surface. Don’t be afraid to add more flour. 3-You can make day of. I made the dough and let sit on counter while oil heated up. 4- I fried in my Instant Pot. Let oil heat up on high sauté mode. I used a thermometer but it didn’t get up to 360. So I used the water test instead. (flick a drop of water in the oil and if it pops, the oil is ready)5- shake in a paper lunch bag with powdered sugar. 6- it makes A LOT of dough. I plan to make cinnamon rolls as other reviewers mentioned. They also said it’s good on the Fridge for a week so I plan to take my time.

It was amazing but I’d just be careful with the sizes of the beignets because it took me a little playing around with it to get them successfully cooked all the way through.

Loved this recipe! I definitely recommend what others have suggested in using a paper bag to coat the beignets with the confectionery sugar. It was suuuper easy to do. Also, the cinnamon roll recipe another user shared was wonderful.

As far as ingredients I followed this recipe to a tee (somewhat, LOL!). I even bought a thermometer to assure the correct hot water temperature for the yeast and oil for frying. 
Modifications: I felt a little weird about adding the sugar, milk and egg mixture directly into the yeast so I first mixed those ingredients and set aside.  Then I followed the directions to prepare the yeast.  That's it! from that point I continued with the directions as instructed.  Oh, before I forget, I also added 2-3 tsp of vanilla and allowed yeast to rise in the refrigerator for 24 hours (patience is key;-).  Having recently visited New Orleans I had the privilege to visit both Cafe Du Monde and Morning Call (which was my favorite), I have to say, these  homemade beignets were as crispy, light and airy as any that I've had over the years in New Orleans.  The family loved them!  They also freeze very well. Cut them up prior to freezing, flour wax paper and layer. Take them out of the freezer an hour before frying and you're good to go. From reading the varied reviews I think patience, adding vanilla or the flavoring of your choice can make the difference. The ultimate complement came from my mother in-law when after having my beignets she ordered beignets at a local establishment which served a New Orleans menu, she told me mine were much better!

These do not taste like authentic beignets at all. The dough is incredibly bland, and they don't puff up like they are supposed to.

Be sure to knead the dough before chilling and knead again before rolling out the dough. I rolled to 1/4" thickness, cut into squares  then let rise again for about an hour. Recipe is very good. I might add a little more sugar to dough next time.

Made these for Christmas this year. I used a stencil to create trees and reindeer in them with the confectioners sugar. My oil was a little too hot so they were more brown than golden, but still tasty.

Worked awesome! Texture was perfect! (Fluffy and airy)I used a piping bag when putting them in the fryer. Added vanilla extract and it was perfect! I temp. the water right at 110*F before I added it the the yeast. I think having the right temp is critical.

Great recipe as written. We make the dough Christmas Eve night for beignets and mimosas on Christmas morning. We have been doing half powdered sugar ones and half cinnamon and sugar. I put the cinnamon and sugar in a paper bag and drop the hot cooked beignets in it. We like both ways.

Great recipe, tired this first time without any alterations and it turned out just like what the recipe said! We did not find it bland or plain it was just nice! For uniformity I would suggest using a cookie or any mold cutter. Even in the fridge it will still proof, leave it for at least 4 hours. I used lard instead of shortening as its healthier. Will use this recipe for all events and will try making chelsea  or cinnamon rolls with this dough as suggested by some reviewers.
Thank you for this recipe which is a definite keeper and its goes well with coffee or tea.

I made these for a staff meeting when the food theme was meals from your cultural background. My coworkers loved it and my former roommate, who's from Ivory Coast, loved it too.

They didn't taste bland when I made them, but that's probably because I accidentally added the powder sugar to the dough mix in addition to the regular sugar. After the beignets cooled off I drizzled them in honey and added sliced strawberries to the side.

This is a quite simple recipe but it was a dud imo. Unless a serving is 10 beignets, then the proportions are way off. I had enough to dough to make about 100 beignets. I made a batch of about 10 for a test run. They were completely bland..I mean no flavor at all. After reading some of the reviews, I added about a tbsp of vanilla extract..still no flavor. Unless you've mastered this recipe, I would cut the ingredients in half. I wasted so much dough due to the complete lack of flavor. Next time I'll cut the flower and yeast in half, use butter or butter flavored crisco, and add a tad bit more sugar.

This was a very easy and versatile recipe. While I made regular beignets, my wife took some of the rolled dough and cut out doughnuts and finished them off with a Cinnamon sugar shake. Will definitely be making again!

I love this recipe, it is always a huge hit. one day I made them but forgot I was out of powdered sugar. I tried one plain and had an idea. I laid all of my puffs out on a baking sheet, melted a half a cup of butter and used a pastry brush to brush each one liberally. I then sprinkled each one with Italian herb blend and parmesan cheese. They were AMAZING!!! :-) this is now my go to appetizer. Serve with marinara or ranch sauce for dipping.

Loved it! Tastes like I'm back in New Orleans. I had the beignets at Cafe Du Monde, and I thought these were ALMOST as good. However, my husband (who didn't wake up earlier enough to go to Cafe Du Monde) tried beignets at another restaurant on our last day in NOLA, and these were MUCH better. So to him, I'm an even better cook ;-)  Followed the recipe exactly, no problems. I think the cooking temp is the biggest factor in the success of the recipe

It's a great recipe. Very similar to ones I had before. The dough is sweet but lacks a little something though. Perhaps a half teaspoon of vanilla would help. Only other thing is that the recipe makes an enormous amount of beignets, it says ten servings but I'm not sure what the author's idea of a serving is because I had enough beignets to fill a large brown paper bag over halfway. I just put them in there with the powdered sugar and turned several times to coat them. It makes less of a mess this way. All things considered these came out delicious and I was very pleased. Difficult to stop eating them actually.

Delish!!!!! I made these with my kids for Fat Tuesday! Seriously yummy! We made the dough last night and the only thing I changed was I added a splash of vanilla. We refrigerated the dough over night and before school this morning they pressed it down to let it rise again. After I picked them up from school this afternoon we rolled our dough out and haven't quit eating them since!! This makes a ton so I bagged up some for family & friends and we are making special deliveries tonight! : )

This was a very good recipe. My dough turned out very sticky and I couldn't roll it out, so I pinched off pieces somewhere between teaspoon and tablespoon sized. The oil worked better for me between 320 and 340 degrees F. Next time I will add another half cup of flour and a teaspoon or so of vanilla. Still, it was delicious and I had plenty to share.

WE made these for Hanukkah.  The whole party joined in.  As fast as we made them, people ate them.  Easy and better then the box mix from cafe du monde.

We made these at Christmas one year for an early breakfast December 26th. They were so easy to make and very delicious! Also, they weren't time consuming at all. We fed all 16 family members in record time! They were a hit.

Thanks for this recipe!

You can't go wrong with fried dough.  But it seemed to make much more than 10 servings.  I think that I had enough to feed everyone on the street.

Simple to make and heavenly when served warm and fresh.  Was very impressed at how well they cooked.  Only requires 2-3 minutes in the deep fryer; I would recommend flipping them over halfway into the cook time.  We had more success using a large Zip-Loc bag for sugar-coating.
