The other reviewers who made this into meathballs crack me up! :) The whole point is to avoid a sandwich that consists of small balls of meat.  You know -- it's about avoiding that biting sequence that goes something like "bread, meat, sauce, more sauce, little bit of meat, whole lotta meat, lots of saucy bread, etc."  For my part, I used four cloves of minced garlic instead of the garlic powder and enjoyed a sandwich in which the biting sequence was more like, "bread/meat/cheese/sauce. . .bread/meat/cheese/sauce."

Yum! :)

HELPFUL TIPS: After making this for several years, I realized that i never made a review & many things weren't mentioned enough so it's confusing to know what to follow.  1. Just tastes better to have the traditional balls instead of slicing!!! 350 for 30 min or until outside is nice brown color (i just use 1lb).  To make it easier, you can still follow directions and make log (width/height of desired meatballs), but cut PRIOR to putting in oven.  If I do make these into sammies b/c I only have hamburger buns, I make log into RECTANGLE with desired thickness and bake for 30 min at 350 (so tender)!  2nd, DO NOT add a T of pepper. A tsp is fine, and there is no need for salt. 3rd, add a tsp of italian seasoning or make your own combination (oregano, basil, garlic powder).  4th, my husband is not a fan of onions but doesn't mind if I stick green onions in.  Last, if you like more of a meatball texture ...add an egg. I don't.  I DO like that I can make ahead and then when ready, re-heat meatballs in marina sauce which I have in a saucepan.  Then just stick in oven when the men in your family want a quick meal (i have all boys)! For the marina sauce, I use what I have on hand (chunky spaghetti sauce)!

Thank goodness football season is over.  Do you have any idea how many times I had to make these on Sunday???? The only thing I did different was used steak buns.  Took a clove of garlic and brushed it over the inside and bottom side of bread, brushed outside of bread top with olive oil.  Popped the meat inside with mozzerella cheese, put on a baking sheet baked until cheese was melted and tops were browned.  The guys loved them, all through football season!!!!!!!!!  Now there wifes want the recipe, don't think so!!

This was wonderful! It was a hit with my family! I only made two changes. Instead of 1 1/2 pounds of hamburger, I used one pound of hamburger and 1/2 pound Italian sausage. I also reduced pepper to 1 teaspoon instead of tablespoon.

Very good sandwich. My husband is from the East Coast and loves this sub! I made this as stated the first time and it was good. From then on, however, I adjusted to our tastes by adding 1 1/2 tsp. of oregano and 1 1/2 tsp. of basil to the loaf. I add one egg, and a full cup of mozzarella cheese to the loaf with extra cheese on top. I also leave out the onion. We always serve this on lightly toasted buns with sauteed onions and peppers. Delicious!

I just thought this was Ok.  The meatballs were missing some seasoning and came out a little too much like a hamburger for my tast.  I do like the idea of baking in a log shape to help keep the sandwich together.  Also, I put the bread in the oven for a few minutes to toast it prior to loading it up (to keep it from getting soggy).  Then I made the sandwich and wrapped it according to the instructions.  No soggy bread.

This was GREAT.  I did dump a bunch of spices in the meat before baking b/c I always like my meatballs well seasoned.  Added dried basil, garlic, red pepper flakes, parsley, onion powder, etc.  SO moist and I also spread garlic butter on the hoagies before adding meat and cheese and toasting and did not add the sauce.  Served with sauce on the side to dip into (can't do soggy bread at all).  My husband was dreaming of this and it was not a let down at all.  Great idea to slice it instead of meatballs, so slipping meat on these sandwhiches!

I rolled them into balls for meatball subs. YUMMY!!!! Next time I will bake them in the sauce instead of adding the sauce later. Mushrooms and black olives would be good on them.

I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs on hand so I just used plain bread crumbs and seasoned them with dried parsley, oregano and cilantro.  I also added some minced garlic, garlic salt and an egg, and I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Really simple and good!

Will definitely make this again but only 3 stars because it needed WAY more seasoning. I thought I added enough which was more than what was called for but it needed even more, pretty bland. Loved the "loaf" concept, made for a great sandwich for sure. Followed advice to avoid soggy bread but will maybe cook the meat in the sauce next time for flavor and to keep the meat moist. Thank you for sharing this, I will continue to make this until it becomes my own:)

This was a HUGE hit with my husband, and my mom and dad. I also loved it. I made a few changes, used 2lbs of meat, added a bit more bread crumbs, didn't use as much pepper and added a bit extra cheese in the meatloaf as well as after putting the sandwiches together. Will definitely be making this again!

These were great! And the whole family loved them! Great taste, tender meatballs. Simple easy meal that doesn't require a whole lot. Although i didn't form the mix into a log- I shaped them into balls and they were fine. Will keep this recipe on hand.

This was my first time ever making meatball sandwiches at home. They were soooo delicious. Instead of the loaf, I made individual meatballs and added mushrooms to the marinara sauce.

Very Good, my husband just gave a few tips for a manly meatball sandwich.  He says Meatballs are better, and a little bit of a sweetened marinara sauce works awsome.  After I put it onto the bread, I left if open faced on tinfoil and put the cheese on both sides of the inside, then broiled for a couple of minutes. Beautiful!

I LUV meatball sandwiches, and this one's great! One thing that's great to do is add some 1/2 in. cubes of fresh mozzarella cheese to the center. This works better if you're making actual meatballs, in which case you'd make a little thumbprint in the middle of the raw ball, press the cube in, and wrap the meat back around the cube. It gives the sandwich an extra surprise, especially if you think the meat lacks flavor!

I used turkey meat and whole grain hoagies for this one.  I don't eat meat....so my husband was the taste tester.  He said it tasted like something he would get at Subway.  So I would say it's a pass.  He ate them for dinner and lunch the next day.  I will definitely make these again.

i made these (subbing ground turkey for beef) for a bridal shower today, and they went over very well.  they have a nice firm texture that was good for sandwiches, so they weren't too crumbly and falling apart.  thanks!

i tripled this for the game tomorrow.  However, I shaped the meat into patties and cooked them in the oven.  Otherwise, I sauteed 3 large cloves garlic in olive oil and omitted the onions and garlic powder (a friend is allergic to onion).  I also added extra italian seasoning and basil.  In addition I threw in about 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese.  Made "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site for the sauce.

I used some leftover meatloaf, assembled and put it in the oven. It didn't heat up very well, so after the oven, I took it out of the foil, put it on a plate, and microwaved it for one minute. That made it a close match to a deli meatball sandwich.

These sandwiches were AWESOME! I had to add more cheese to the meat mixture cause we are cheese-aholics but other than that it was great for my family and our friends that seem to come by everytime I fix these subs!

Really tasty. I made a few changes to the original, 1/2lb of ground pork along with the 1lb of ground beef, french bread instead of hoagie rolls, red pepper flakes, and sliced fresh mozzarella instead of the shredded.

I made this according to the recipe. My husband and I loved it. It was easy to make, I actually made it ahead and refrigerated it overnight. I served it on hoagie rolls, but I may try it over pasta next time.

This was so Yummy!!  My hubby really doesn't care for meatball sandwiches but he really liked this one!!  I used ground turkey breast and on the second try omitted the onions (daughter didn't like them)and they were very yummy.  On my second try I actually balled up the meat mixture for meatballs and it took about 20 minutes to cook through(I am extremely impatient)and they tasted the same as if I made it the original way.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Five stars for the awesome solution to an age-old dilemma:  how to enjoy a meatball sub without playing the catch-the-saucy-meatball game everyone loves so much.  It should have been a no-brainer, but I've been eating them for years and never thought of this... What a forehead-slapping moment reading this recipe was. I scaled the recipe down because it was just me eating, and I just made a mini-log and baked it for about 20 mins, then just slid it right into my pre-toasted bread.  For an extra treat, try brushing your bread with a little olive oil and sprinkle some cheese on before toasting.  I hate soggy bread, so I heated the sauce separately and then added it to the sandwich at the last second before sprinkling more cheese on top.  Absolutely perfect meatball.. er, meatLOG sub experience! I also upped the spices and added basil/oregano because I love robust food.  Thanks so much for this one.. you've truly changed my life.. or at least the part of it that involves meatball subs!

Husband declared this the best meatball sandwich ever.  Reheating tip - heat slices and sauce in saute pan for a few minutes before assembling sandwich.  LOVE the flat meatball sandwich.  It's a forehead-smacker, it's so obvious.

Oh my goodness!!!! My daughter was craving meatballs, so I started searching for a recipe that looked good. I liked the thought of a loaf rather than balls and gave it a try. I made this 2 nights ago and my family asked for it again tonight. My husband, son and daughter all loved this VERY tasty recipe. My daughter has friends over all the time and has requested this for the next time everyone is here. Just follow the recipe the first time and make adjustments if you feel it's necessary, but we all think it's great as is. I do use onion powder rather than fresh simply because I don't like biting into an onion. I bake it in a big glass casserole dish so the grease drains away from the meat (how I make my meatloaf) and it all comes out perfect.

Pretty good and certainly a lot neater than regular meatballs in a sandwich. Next time, I would certainly toast those buns first. Instead of forming a log and putting it in a baking dish, I put it into a disposable aluminum loaf pan into which I had punched holes, then placed that on some throw-away chop sticks in a baking dish to catch the drippings. It comes out easily after it's cooled a bit.

I really liked the idea of shaping the meat, but I knew that it was going to need more seasoning; I added garlic, garlic powder, onion powder and Italian herb seasoning. I also thought 50 mins in the oven was WAY too long - ours were done after 35, and probably could have come out 5 mins earlier. Anyway, we enjoyed this. Thanks!

This is a well-loved 'team meal' dish- skimp on the sauce so the bread doesn't get soggy,wrap it up in heavy foil and it travels well. Kids can 'customize' their sandwich with hot pepper flakes, banana pepper rings, extra sauce, extra cheese to their individual tastes. Serve with salad and fruit, cookies if the coach permits, and you will have a happy group. This is what I 'have' to make when it's my turn to feed the team.

Oh my goodness, the PEPPER!  I used a TEASPOON and they are still extremely peppery. I can't imagine how they would be with a whole tablespoon! Yikes. If I make this recipe again, I will use 1/4-1/2 tsp of pepper.

Holy Hotness!! We always make a recipe the way it was written the first time we make it, especially if my husband is cooking that night. I could barely eat them they were so spicy! I do like that they were slices and not meatballs. Next time I will cut back a lot on the pepper and I think we will enjoy them much more!

Was good for a different kind of meal.  Plus, you can freeze them in the freezer in the foil packets.  When you're ready for a hot lunch or easy supper with no work, let them thaw for a little bit, heat your oven to 350 and put them in for about 30-45 minutes, just enough to warm it up again and let the cheeses ooz!

Why didn't I think of doing this before!??  Great time saving idea and my kids loved it because they didn't have meatballs slipping out of their sandwich.  I made this the day before we were planning on having it for dinner.  I sliced the meatballloaf and warmed it through in the marinara sauce on the stovetop. The only thing I will do differently is add parmesan cheese to the mixture and add the mozzerella on top.  We loved it!

I made it into meatballs. I just like the idea of a meatball sandwhich better. There's just something comfoting about biting into that big sloppy mess and getting a big mouthfull of meat. These were just OK flavor wise...not great, but not bad either.

This the BEST meatball recipe I have ever tried. I only had 1/3 LB of ground beef thawed, so I adjusted all the other ingredients accordingly. I'm making it again tomorrow! My whole family loved it, so it will join our list of regularly made meals!

I followed this recipe exactly, except I made meatballs and had to cut down on the cooking time a little.  It turned out wonderful, better than the local sub shop.  My family loved it, my husband took some to work the next day and demanded I make it again.  I definately will be making it again, very soon hopefully!

This was a nice flavored dish. I made patties out of this and cooked these on the stovetop and simmered them in the marinara sauce then topped them sliced provolone and let it melt. I served this on a sesame seed bun that I buttered and toasted. My son gobbled his up, DH and I both thought this would have been better if I had used pizza sauce instead and only a dollop of it on top. Not bad overall though, and made a really nice quick meal that was a little different from the norm,(whatever that is for us). Thanks for sharing, we enjoyed trying this.

I'm not sure why this sandwich is called 'meatball'. It's more like a meat loaf sandwich. But they sure are tasty. I added an egg to my meat mix to help it stay together better. (It kept falling apart when I tried to shape it in a log). That's the only change I made. My hubby loves these sanwiches. Thanks Wyatt, for providing a new family favorite!

The first time we made this it was so good, just like Subway!  YUM!!!  The next time we didn't have any french bread, my husband said regular store bought white bread would work just fine.  Well it doesn't, the pieces of bread became all soggy and we ended up just eating the meatballs.  So stick to the french bread,  it really makes the sandwich FANTASTIC!

AWESOME!!!  I reduced pepper to 1 tsp as well and added the egg...best dinner I have made in a very long time!!  Everyone in the house loved them and I cannot wait to cook them for friends and family.  For those who make them into balls...try the loaf, I loved the idea and they don't roll off.

Everyone in my family loves these sandwiches!  The kids have been begging me to make again soon...so I will be making them tonight!  I follow the recipe to the "T", and it's perfect every time.  We also find them very good for leftovers (if there are any) the next day.  Just heat them back up in the oven until hot.

These were great! I went ahead and gave it 5 stars, because I know they can be and it was my poor choice in rolls. I also made them into meatballs simply because I couldn't imagine eating a meatball sub without them in meatball form(it also cut down the cooking time considerbly and only took a few minutes to form them). My hubby is a huge meatball sub lover and these made him very happy. Thanks so much!!

SO GOOD. I had some beef to use, but didn't want to do just plain meatloaf, so I was excited to find this recipe. I didn't have any real onion, so I used the dehydrated kind instead, and it was fine. For the bread crumbs, I did crushed crackers w/ 1 tbsp. of Italian seasoning, but I would do a touch less seasoning next time. I added spices to tomato sauce to create my own marinara, and used an 8 oz. can. We used one long loaf of French bread cut in half, and it was the perfect size for all the meat. Overall, this was exactly as delicious as I thought it would be, and it was very very filling!

I love these sandwiches!  I am 7 months pregnant and I have craved meatball subs my whole pregnancy so I order them everywhere I go but these ones beat all the restaurant subs.  They are spicy and full of flavor but not too spicy...even my two year old loved them.  I did roll the meat into meatballs rather than meatloaf.

My boyfriend and I make dinner for his family ever Sunday night, and his mom and dad just loved the recipe.  Every week she craves it again.  
Tips:
Next time I would put less pepper, it turned out really spicy.  And, I would go easy on the cheese (I got a little carried away and didn't measure, my fault).  But, other than that, I know we will be making that again.

What a great idea.  I love the idea of the loaf, makes it so much easier to put on a roll.  My family doesn't really like spicy foods, so I used less than half the pepper.  I had made my own sauce to top it off with the cheese.  Delicious! Getting ready to vacation at the shore (car ride) so I baked 2 loaves and froze them to assemble the sandwiches for lunch on vacation.

My family enjoyed these sandwiches very much.  I did add an egg to the recipe and some parmesean cheese, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  Meatball sandwiches can be a little messy at times and this one really solves that problem.

Tasty!  It was a little greasy on the sandwich, but the taste was good.  Three of the four people in my family really liked it.  Next time I'll cook in the meatloaf pan instead of the 8" square to help with the grease runoff.  But it was easy and a nice change for a quick dinner night.

This sandwich was amazing, easy, and fast. The only caution I have is to make sure to mix up the meat loaf well (I had to use my hands). I served it with tater tots and made sure to top it with gratuitous amounts of cheese.

Very tasty! I also chose to make mine into meatballs rather than a log, muah ha ha ha! I had left overs and am looking forward to eating them tomorrow, I'm sure they'll toast up nicely in the toaster oven! Thanks, I'll definitely be making this again.

This was just "ok".  I used the amount of black pepper called for in the recipe because I like spiciness/pepper, but I agree with previous reviewers that it calls for way too much. I added some tomatoes and green peppers, as well as topping it with tomato sauce and parmesan cheese for the last 10 minutes of baking.

I altered a few ingredients to fit what I had on hand and did add an egg as others suggested. Left as loaf and sliced, LOVE the concept. It was sooooo delicious. Next time I'll try with ground turkey for a healthier option. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is such an easy recipe. I added an egg, left out the onion, and made them into meatballs instead of baking it whole. Hubby couln't stop eating this. My picky 4 and 6 year old also loved these. I will definately be making these again. Thanks for the recipe.

You may want to cut back on the black pepper - - one tablespoon makes the meatballs pretty spicy.  Yes, I made them into meatballs.  But the submitter's interpretation was pretty clever.  I used provolone in my sandwiches instead of mozzarella because that was what I had in the refrigerator.

Awesome recipe and easy to make. I topped with the sauce for the last 15 min. of baking. My husband loved it. I used sliced provelone cheese instead of shredded mozzeralla.

I actually used this recipe as a base and added and changed it around a little bit because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand... My kid brother doesn't like spaghetti or spaghetti sauce, so I took the leftover meat sauce and added an egg and two pieces of bread and made the meatballs from that mixture.  It was yummy this way, but the meatballs were very very  fragile and broke apart easily.  You only have to cook them for a short time- 15 minutes or so, just to cook the egg. I also made sure my sauce was really spicy. The other change I had was that I used "Texas Toast" style bread (the very thick white bread), and I sprayed it with cooking spray and put it in the oven without the aluminum foil.  My version was yummy comfort food, and it didn't take very long... however it probably wasnt as pretty as it could have been.  It was still good though- thanks for the recipe!

The concept of making this into a log is great. But I did add ground pork with ground meat and a little more seasoning. This way it didn't have a hamburger taste. But all in all it turned out very good.

It  is meatloaf on bread. Imstead of using ketchup you use spaghetti sauce. It wasnt meatballs at all. The name is very misleading.

I have made it several times. It is perfect for me and not as messy as meatballs. Making it in a loaf works very well. I've made these for potlucks, Super Bowl. So when the mood hits? I make this. Everyone that has had them has enjoyed them.

3.28.18  I needed to shorten the time to make this recipe, so I approached this a little differently.  First, I just couldn’t relate to a meatball sandwich with sliced meatballs, so I formed the meat into the traditional round shape and baked @ 350® for about 22 minutes.  I heated up my marinara sauce stovetop (Basic Marinara for the Instant Pot® on this site), dropped the meatballs into the sauce to warm up, and then into the roll.  After the sandwich was made, I just put it under the broiler until the mozzarella was melted.  A good sandwich served with potato salad and pickles was a tasty and simple dinner.

These are not traditional Italian meatballs and I think that is why they worked so well on a sandwich! Will defiantly make again.

Excellent! Few things I did differently I cooked the onion and garlic prior to adding to meat. Used less  pepper about 1 teaspoon. Also added Italian seasoning.I made the meat as meatballs and stuffed 1 cup of mazarella inside them. Cooked with marinara sauce topped it off with more cheese.

I have made this for my children time after time they love it. I substitute 1/2 lb of italian sausage for 1/2 lb of ground beef. This recipe will never leave my recipe box. I even have a hard copy to make sure it is NEVER lost.

Now that my children are grown and it's just me. I still make this and keep the assembled sandwiches wrapped in foil in the fridge for a quick dinner/lunch. Makes life so so easy.

Unfortunately, this recipe didn't turn out well.  My husband couldn't finish the sandwich.  He felt it was very bland, seemed too moist.

This was a great recipe! My husband said I out did myself that was a great complement thanks so much for sharing! I did add a couple of spices as some of the people mentioned, I added dry parsley, dried oregano, red pepper flakes , dried basil, and instead of onion I substituted with onion powder and the taste was amazing!

I don't know about this one!  I like it but for me - it was missing something that I could not put my finger on!  I served it the second night without the sauce (just as a sandwich - but that wasn't it either.  I will continue looking for a good meatball sandwich recipe...that has more kick to it!

mmmm.  who doesn't love a good meatball sandwich?  this is great football season food in my house.  i used 1 lb. beef and 1/2 lb of pork sausage, and made it into balls (which took less baking time.  i started the meatballs off in the oven (about 20 min), but then finished them in a pan of marinara sauce (another 10 min or so).  i also used slices of provolone  instead of mozzarella.  i may reduce the amount of pepper next time, but that's proably due to the strong sausage flavor.  thanks for a great recipe!

Very good! it was my first time making meatballs and it turned out really good because it was so simple.  I followed some of the other reviews and rolled it into balls instead then baked it in the oven for 30 mins and was serving it with spaghetti so I then cooked it in the spaghetti sauce for about 10 mins and it was perfect.

Wonderful!  This is better than at a sub shop!  It was very easy and not much cleanup.  I made meatballs and reduced cooking time to 30 min.  Last 10 minutes I drained grease and cooked with spaghetti sauce.  Served with provolone instead of mozzarella.

This recipe made really good meatballs.  I used one lb. ground beef and half a lb. ground pork for added flavor.  350 for 30 minutes, after browning in a skillet.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy!  One of those creations I wish I would have thought of.  It's not only easier to prepare, i.e. not rolling into balls, but it also stays on the bun better.  Bravo!!!  We have a new recipe staple in our family.

This was GREAT!!!  I had to substitute garlic salt because i had no garlic powder, so I had to adjust a little.  But they were really tender! I served them with curly fries seasoned with fajita seasoning. My brother and husband both said it reminded them of the Subway ones!

I skipped the onions, used ground turkey meat....and made them into traditional balls (per boyfriend's request). They were SO good! This meatball recipe was better than any restaurant meatballs we've ever had. We literally had this 3 days in a row. The leftovers kept getting better. This is definitely going to be made again and again! I'm thinking that making a large batch and freezing it would be good too! Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This was the best meatball recipe I have found! I went ahead and made mine into meatballs, baked in oven alone, then poured off the fat and added my sauce and cooked alittle longer and they turned out great! Got raves from everyone! I'm making these again tonight...my search for the perfect meatball recipe is now over! Try these...you won't regret it.

Excellent recipe!  The only thing I would change is reducing the amount of pepper from a tablespoon to a teaspoon.  Its too overpowering.  I will definitely make this again.
