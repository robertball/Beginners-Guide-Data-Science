I thought this recipe was good. I give it 5 stars for being quick and easy to make and 3 stars for overall taste (4 stars overall). Next time I make it (and I will make it again)I will:

(1) Sauté the garlic. I am a huge garlic fan but the fresh garlic taste in this recipe was overpowering and did not mix well with the other ingredients. I think the flavor would be better if it were sautéed for a few minutes.

(2) Add a few more vegetables...perhaps mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes. You could even sauté the mushrooms and the garlic together.

(3) Add some freshly grated parmesan cheese. The goat cheese was good but I think the added tang of some parmesan would be delicious.

I re-heated this recipe the next day and it did not work well. It still tasted good, but it was not the same. This is not necessarily a bad thing though! A recipe like this, full of fresh ingredients, shouldn't be saved for leftovers.

Overall, this was a very tasty dish...thanks!

I made some changes:
added pine nuts

sauteed garlic in olive oil first, then added arugula until wilted and coated, before adding to the rest of ingredients.

We really enjoyed it.  Very tasty, and easy.

I LOVE goat cheese, which is how I came across this recipe on the site.  Frankly, I didn't even know what arugula was before making this dish.  I enjoy trying new and interesting things though, so the arugula did not discourage me.  I made it...and it is delicious!  I wasn't sure what to expect of the final result because I haven't made many recipes where you mix a bunch of fresh, cold garden ingredients with hot pasta...but it works!  Delightful!

This was ok. As suggested by the other reviewers, I fried the garlic first. I found the end result to be a little bland. Parmesan cheese helped a lot. I think next time, I will use sun dried tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes, and maybe add grilled portabello mushrooms.  Still, a great base recipe--Thanks!

This made a fantastic summer meal!  I used spinach instead of arugula, added shrimp and chilled it overnight.

Delicious. Sauteed the garlic in the olive oil along with about six sliced baby bella mushrooms. Poured that over the cheese and arugula and let it sit at room temp for about an hour. Tossed in a handfull of kalamata olives too. Very versatile recipe, I think you could substitute a variety of ingredients depending on what you have on hand: artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, even add shrimp or sausage.

Wonderful! Changed it a bit . . . I started by sauteing some red onion in some of the olive oil. I added baby spinach to the arugula for a total of 4 cups, which I added to the onions to "wilt." I felt like I didn't have enough greens after that, and added a little more spinach and about 2 more cups arugula to the pasta. My package of goat cheese was 4 oz, so I was a little short on goat cheese - but I don't think it made a big difference. I did add maybe 1/2 cup shredded parmesan. And I used grape tomatoes. Will enjoy this for work dinners for the rest of the week! Yum! (Oh! I did not bother to chopped the greens . . . )

I did not change a thing!  I found Argula at the Wild Oats Store (popular chain) after going to 2 regular grocery stores.  Goat cheese was easy to find..and I do not think it has the same taste as Feta.  I would personally not substitute this.  I love the sharper flavor!  When I served it up...I thought it needed something and I sprinkled on about 1/2 cup of Parmesan and a bit of leftover Mozerella.  This was half way through the meal and everyone liked it better with the additional cheeses!  I added them to my recipe card.  I love the ease and I will make it my way again and again!  YUM!

Very good and refreshingly light!!  I adapted this according to my picky husband's taste -- used parmesan instead of goat cheese; sauteed arugula with garlic and whole grape tomatoes and added shrimp to complete the dish.  I'll definitely make this again!

I thought this was really easy and delicious!! I sauteed the garlic in the olive oil while I was preparing the rest of the ingredients. Then just poured it over the cooked pasta. I also covered the top of the dish with fresh grated parmesan cheese - about a half a cup. A good addition. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent!!  I made it with whole wheat penne.  Yummy.  I also sautéed my garlic for a couple minutes because I don't like to eat raw garlic.  I also saved a little of the pasta water and added that to the dish.

Made it as written, except I subbed romas for the cherry tomatoes. Being a HUGE arugula and goat cheese fan, I figured I'd like it, but it was even better than expected! Be sure to use a good goat cheese, good olive oil, and ripe, fresh tomatoes.. oh.. and don't substitute the arugula if you want full flavor. It has a peppery bite that stands out in this dish.. wouldn't be the same without it. All of these ingredients play a very important roll in getting the best flavor for a recipe like this. Absolutely excellent, thanks so much for sharing!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some wonderful goat cheese I had.  This recipe was suggested to me and I'm so glad I tried it!. The flavor of this recipe is outstanding, and more importantly my husband and teen daughter both loved it (and they think they don't like goat cheese)! I sauteed some sliced baby bella mushrooms that I had on hand with the garlic, and subbed chopped roasted red pepper for the tomatoes. This dish came together in less than 15 minutes total, which is another reason I'm giving it 5 stars! Don't hesitate to make this recipe, it's awesome!

I loved this! Super easy; knowing the high nutrient content of arugula have been looking for a recipe that my (young adult) son would enjoy. A previous recipe using it wasn't a bit hit but both my husband and son liked this very much.  I used fresh from the garden, grape tomatoes instead of cherry and didn't exactly measure the salt, pepper and garlic... but used about the recommended.  My son did say he would like it better if it had more moisture, so I suggested he ad a sprinkle of flavored vinegar which he did and liked better. I liked it as is.

Not to bad, the pasta was a little dry, not enough sauce for the. Dish I think. I would make this again and alter the amount of liquids a little.

This was an incredible meal. My family really enjoyed this even though they are committed carnivores! The way this recipe stands it is perfect. And the beauty of it is that if it doesn't suit your tastes, it is easily adapted to a variety of tastes! My youngest asked me to cut the garlic by half next time, but my eldest loved it the way it was. I thought maybe a few flakes of red pepper might be nice, but my wife would not care for that. We discussed it over dinner and have decided that this one makes it into the family recipe book!

We LOVED this recipe! With good ingredients like arugula and goat cheese it is hard to go wrong. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes so I used a can of diced and it still turned out great. This is a really good vegetarian dinner to put in our rotation. Highly recommended!

This tasted almost like a gourmet mac 'n' cheese; the goat cheese made it nice and creamy! I used yellow pear tomatoes from the garden and about half the goat cheese (it's all I had), and it was delicious. It actually tasted better as it cooled, and I'd definitely suggest only lightly heating the leftovers; otherwise the tomatoes get too mushy.

Excellent!!!!  I didn't have arugula, I just sauteed fresh baby spinach with olive oil and minced garlic until it was wilted, took it off the burner, mixed in the goat cheese until it was slightly melted, then added the tomatoes and pasta.  Like others, I sprinkled Parmesan on it too.  It was REALLY good!

This was really good.  I wanted the arugula to wilt down a lot, so I drained the boiling pasta water over it, in a colander.  It worked very well.  I don't love the strong flavor of arugula, so I liked this recipe, with other flavors.  I did use feta because I don't like goat cheese.  I also used whole wheat penne.

This recipe is easy, super fast, and delicious. I don't like arugula, so I substituted spinach. I also cooked the tomatoes and garlic for a bit first, and added parmesan and shrimp like some other reviewers suggested. SO good!

Really loved the goat cheese in this. Roasted the tomatoes with garlic before using them, and had it with rosemary/olive oil bread. Delicious!

This recipe is fantastic! So easy and quick, and delicious. I add some sun-dried tomatoes for a little extra flavor, but this recipe can hold its own.

I prepared this with feta, and it was delicious. It makes a wonderfully simple and elegant dish. Perfect for spring and summer dinners. I sauteed two crushed garlic cloves and removed them before adding the pasta. The peppery greens, which I often find to be a little too sharp for my taste, turned out perfectly. I live in Italy, and my Italian boyfriend makes it clear if a dish works or if it doesn't. He loved it. This will become a reoccurring dish in this Tuscan household. Next time it's goat cheese. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this recipe last week and it was delicious and a keeper.  Because my husband like to have some meat in his meal, I browned 1/2 pound of ground, mild, Italian sausage and tossed that in just before serving.  He loved it.

I actually made this is a hot dish, sautéed the garlic in olive oil with the salt and pepper (I probably used about 4 cloves) and added about 3-4 cups of arugula and about a cup of spinach and then added the tomatoes.  I let that sauté until the leaves wilted and then added the goat cheese and melted that until it covered the ingredients.  When the pasta was done and drained, I added that to the sauce and made sure the sauce covered the pasta completely.  This was really yummy on both the first day and heated up.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the first time I think ever that my husband actually said he liked dinner without me asking, and he had seconds!  I used goat cheese with sweet basil and I think it kicked it up a notch.

We liked this recipe alot. I did add sauteed shrimp, which really added to the flavor. Next time I will saute the garlic and maybe add a few fresh mushrooms and try arugula and spinach

We enjoyed this recipe but I did find the arugala a little biter.  My husband is a big salad eater so he enjoyed the change.  I'm thinking of either trying to adding some spinach or just doing spinach the next time.  Loved how easy it was to make.  Loved the goat cheese. (I usually use gorgonzola with other salads so this was my first time with goat cheese.)  Will make it again - especially since my husband like it so much.

This was super yummy and easy to make. I sauteed the garlic in the oil first and this worked perfectly. Great as is but I think it would also be wonderful with some crumbled pancetta too.  Will try that next.  Either way, this recipe is a keeper!

Excellent! I made it with whole wheat penne pasta for dinner. I think it would also be great for a special luncheon dish, served with a green salad and a glass of chardonnay.

MMMMM...fabulous!  Admittedly, I altered the recipe a bit, but nothing drastic to change the integrity.  After reading other reviews, I did saute the garlic, but did so along with some cremini mushrooms and chopped sun-dried tomatoes (sauteed in some red wine, yum!).  I then added the cherry tomatoes to this mixture and also threw in some shrimp (we were having some soup as a side).  I put the arugula in separate dishes with a bit of the olive oil, then added some fresh parmesan (instead of goat cheese as hubby and I are not too fond), then added the pasta and sauteed mixture to each dish.  This was EXCELLENT!!  This dish is so yummy, the added mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes take it to another level!  DEELISH!

We loved this! Next time, we would try with sun dried tomatoes instead, but overall, it was a fantastic flavor. The goat cheese and arugala work so well together.

Tried this last night, and it was great! The goat cheese creates a nice creamy sauce thats not too rich and the arugula adds a nice spice note. I added sauteed diced chicken breast with onion and tossed everything together for a fast and easy complete dinner, I'll definitely prepare this again.

This was excellent!  I adjusted based on what I had on hand.  I used julienned roasted red peppers instead of tomatoes, sauteed the garlic in olive oil and added sliced baby bella mushrooms to it, adding a bit of white wine at the end as they sauteed.  Wonderful recipe!

Holy smokes, this was good.  I used quinoa instead of pasta, sauteed the garlic, and subbed spinach for arugula since it's what I could find.  I went heavy on fresh ground pepper, too.  So fresh and delicious!

I am giving this a 4 because I made a couple changes (I know, shame on me!), but I was wanting to use up some mushrooms I had on hand.  Plus, I know from previous experience that raw garlic can be very overpowering, so I sauteed the garlic with some sliced mushrooms, and then proceeded with the recipe as posted (oh, I only used a tablespoon or so of the olive oil - but otherwise it was the same!).  My husband gave it two thumbs up.  Just add a simple salad and a glass of wine, and this is a very light and tasty, easily-made dinner after a long day at work!

Very tasty and perfect for warm weather. The peppery bite of the arugula is perfectly contrasted with the smoothness of the goat cheese. Even my extremely picky 14 year old is having seconds. Next time I might add more tomatoes, just because she really likes them. I bet you could put some grilled chopped chicken in this with good results too. Thanks Christine for this recipe!

Oh my goodness gracious! This is one of the best things I've ever eaten! My husband and I are totally hooked! We loved it so much I am making it again tonight for dinner. I love how quick and easy it is to make, perfect for when I work 12 hour shifts and need to make a quick meal. I think it'd also be great as a pot luck dish, because it still tastes amazing at room temperature. I might add a few extra tomatoes and pack the arugula when I measure it, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!

Made it exactly as written.  My husband thought it was only OK, but my 12 year daughter really liked it.  This is an especially good use of slightly wilted arugula that is no longer well suited to a green salad.

The goat cheese and arugula were both firsts for us.  I made it in an electric skillet, sauteed the garlic in the oil, then added the arugula for the slightly wilted effect. Then I stirred in the rest of the ingredients and it was great!  We would definitely make it again possibly throwing in some chicken for my husband's benefit.

Nice for a change of pace for dinner. We used zita, subbed in feta, added bacon and parmesan and the juice from half a lemon. I cooled the pasta first, so it was more like a pasta salad, which my family prefers. Also, sauted the garlic with some minced onion and mushrooms. I know, I made quite a few changes. But it came together fairly quickly and easily. Would make it again.

This was pretty good.  I added some parm and fried up a kielbasa and added 3/4 of it into this to make it a little more manly.  Still pretty good.

This was good but it needed something more. Maybe caramelized onions?  Also, I will cut back on the goat cheese next time.

Very tasty!  Instead of using a 1/4 cup of olive oil, I used 1/8 cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar.

Delicious! My first experience with goat cheese. This was easy to make, really fresh tasting and yummy. I'll be making it again and adding some more things to it based on reviewers' suggestions.

I could not decide if I like goat cheese or not.  (This was my first.)  I will probably try parmesan next time.  I couldn't find just arugula, but found mixed with spinach and the combination was great.  Overall, this is a wonderful recipe.
*Heated and ate the next day and it was really good.

This was very good and quite tasty.  I added some cooked chicken that I had as well as some marinated artichoke hearts.  The peppery flavor of the arugula was smoothed by the richness of the goat cheese.  I can't wait to have this leftover tomorrow.

This was outstanding...my husband complimented with the FIRST bite which is unusual for him.  I was tempted to just use a spring mix but decided to use all arugula and was glad I did, the peppery bite of the arugula was a perfect compliment to the creamy goat cheese and tomatoes. I used a whole wheat/flax seed penne.  I will surely make this again, OFTEN. Thank you!!!

If I could give this 6 stars, I would.  Simple and so good.  I followed the directions except I sauteed the garlic with 1/4 cup of pine nuts.  Fantastic.  Thank you so much for this amazing recipe.

I made this for a potluck because it was easy to make and held up well over a few hours.  In my pre-run, I learned that pain tomatoes made the overall dish a little bland.  I took the suggestion of sun dried tomatoes and it made a huge difference.  At the party, it was a hit.

This recipe has become a trusted standby since I first made it a couple years ago. Back then, I had some fresh arugula from a CSA and, never having had it before, didn't know what to do with it. This was perfect!!! Fresh ingredients are a must. I usually leave the tomatoes out all together (not a big tomato fan) and it still tastes fabulous. Thank you!

Goat cheese has a marvelous tang.  I enjoyed this dish but I may have it without the cheese next time...just to make for lighter fare in summer.  I diced the plum tomatoes and let them 'rest' in a bowl with one garlic clove, chopped in half and olive oil.  Then after an hour I simmered everything.  I added fresh basil and dropped in a bag of arugula/baby spinach toward the end.  I let that wilt down, about 10 minutes and then tossed immediately with the penne.  My grown daughter loved it.

I had everything on hand except the goat cheese so I used parmesean cheese instead.  It came out great!  My husband gave it 4 stars and I gave it 5.  Since I'm the cook I giving it the 5 stars I think it deserves.  Thanks for sharing this simple, quick, excellent recipe.

I loved this!  I did use asparagus instead of the arugula and i roasted the tomatoes with a little olive oil before adding to the pasta which gave them a deeper, sweeter taste. I will definitly make this again!

This was excellent--very quick and easy.  The goat cheese provides a nice coating to the pasta--almost like a sauce as it gets melty due to the temperature of the pasta.  I couldn't find arugula at the store so had to use spinach; it was still pretty good.

Excellent recipe that combines all the fresh ingredients of the summer. I live in Southern New Jersey and buy all the fresh ingredients in our neighborhood roadside stand. I use regular or plum tomatoes. Instead of the goat cheese I’ve also tried it with Feta cheese and added black olives. My fiancé didn’t use to eat whole wheat pasta before… he eats it with this recipe. :)

This was absolutely delicious but like other reviewers, I sauteed the garlic in a little olive oil before adding it to the mix. This dish combines many of my favorite flavors. Thanks, Christine!

The flavor was just fantastic...however I have to give it one star off because the garlic was WAY too strong.  My children wouldnt eat it and we are usually big garlic eaters.  Either my garlic was too strong or there was too much for the recipe.  Next time I will 1/2 the garlic or roast it first.

Simple easy recipe with great taste....I modified it to add Blue cheese rather than goat cheese because I had it at home and tossed in a few pine nuts for crunch....
Definitely will do again....

I am a huge goat cheese fan, but even I thought it was a little overpowering in this dish. Next time I will either use half the cheese or twice the pasta. For a healthier version I used whole wheat penne which was awesome. Pinenuts are also a good addition. Every dish needs a little tweaking for me, so overall it was a great and easy dish that my family will have over and over again.

Thought this was wonderful.  I was worried about my goat cheese because it was so soft that it wouldn't crumble, but after the olive oil was added it just made a kind of luscious sauce.  Added, because of previous reviews, small cubes of mozzarella and offered fresh grated Parmesan and grilled chicken for folks to add on top.  Used a regular fresh tomato, chopped, rather than cherry or grape tomatoes.  Without anything more, it made a lovely summer supper for 3-4 people (altho French bread would have been nice with it, too).  Easy to make, and very few dishes to wash.

This is absolutely a 5 star recipe!  We belong to a CSA and had a bunch of Arugula to eat.  I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was fantastic.  My husband loved it too!

Very easy recipe. My husband loved it. He ate the leftovers the next day cold for lunch and loved it that way  too. I used regular tomatoes since that is what I had on hand. I also added a little buffalo mozzarella to it as well. All of the fresh ingredients that I used came from a farmer's market and were in season. The goat cheese was locally made too. So it had a really good fresh taste. Great summer recipe but I  probably won't make it when those ingredients are out of season.

This recipe was a complete success. 

The only thing i would change would be the garlic, either make sure you cut it up into SUPER tiny pieces, or sautee it first. Getting a big chunk of garlic can be unpleasant(not only for you but the people who have to smell your breath afterward).
I also used a mixture of blue cheese, goat cheese and feta. Afterward, I topped it off with slices of grilled chicken breast. This combo turned out fantastic! 
My boyfriend is a real red meat and potatoes kind of guy and he loved it!

This is a very good, SUPER SIMPLE ane FAST pasta dish that is different for a change from the traditional red sauce.  Only warning is to be sure to wash the arugula well! It really holds the dirt/sand and it ruined my dish once.  I make this several times a year.

The best salad I have ever had!  Argula was hard to find, but well worth the search for this dish.  The flavors are superb together.  I wouldn't make any substitions unless you cannot find fresh cherry or grape tomatoes.  Firm plum tomatoes work well in that case.  A big thanks to Christine L for this recipe.  I am been serving it at least once a week since I found it!  Family loves it, too!

This was great, especially for the summer!  The only changes I made were to make the mixture the night before and let it marinate (so that the flavors could combine more) and I used spinach (I couldn't find argula).

This was delicious!  Since I didn't have arugula on hand, I substituted the spinach that I did have.  I couldn't keep this around for leftovers because it was GONE.  My husband loved it, but think this would be a great idea for the "ladies who lunch" crowd that I host every so often.

This pasta was DELICIOUS!  As suggested by others, we added mushrooms, which we sauteed with butter and the garlic.  We also replaced the goat cheese with feta cheese.  We will definitely eat this again and again!  A+++

We make this all the time and find that crushing the garlic in a press helps it blend with the oil and cheese. I also add a little grated lemon zest and some additional oil. For a variation, it's good with fresh raw spinach or even with blanched and chopped broccoli rabe. If you use the broccoli rabe, which is pleasantly bitter, you have to blanch it until tender.

I can't believe how quick and easy this was, yet it is sophisticated enough to serve for company. Delicious too! (For those having a hard time finding arugula, try your local farmer's market if you have one, or a natural foods store.)

This is a terrific and fast dinner recipe.  I couldn't find any arugula so I used mixed salad greens, which has some arugula.  I scaled the recipe to 2 servings and it turned out great.  I will keep this recipe as a vegetarian dish the next time I have vegetarians over for dinner.

Amazing blending of flavors and simple ingredients!  I used 100% whole wheat penne pasta and spinach instead of arugula--it was great hot and cold.  I added chicken to part of the recipe, which was delicious. I am following Dr. Ian Smith's , THE CLEAN 20, and this recipe is perfect.  I will DEFINITELY make it again!

I made this by my self for my parents and it was so good. It was very easy to make and ended up tasting delicious. The blue cheese is very good and I think it’s best to estimate when using the blue cheese not use exactly 4 ounces.

Easy to make and very flavorful. This was a hit with everyone who tried it. I used 3 largish cloves of fresh garlic and mixed the garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil together about an hour before to let the garlic flavor come through.

Really good but I added a half lemon for juice, it just needed a little something extra, and the fresh lemon juice was perfect!!!

I didn't have any arugula or tomatoes but it was still really good.  Even my one year old loved it! I would make it again!

Love it !! One of our fav's... we do add a package of feta to the goat cheese and warm it slightly in the pot after all mixed together at the end. Gives us a creamy cheese finish at the end still keeping the freshness of the arugala

This is a fantastic side dish for any meat. Everyone loves it. The secret is to QUARTER the tomatoes that give it a zing, and finely mince the garlic. I put everything together except the pasta and let it sit for 30 minutes so the flavors combine before cooking the pasta.  I also added 4 TBS of hot pasta water to the dish. Last time I made this I added a teaspoon of lemon zest and that really added flavor. Instead of the baked potato, this was terrific with a perfectly grilled filet mignon.

This recipe was amazing! However I am not a fan of goat cheese, so I used marscapone instead. What a delicious, fresh recipe!

This was great and super easy!!  I used more sum dried tomatoes and extra goat cheese.  Used a little fat free half and half to thin it a bit.  Really really tasty.

This was extremely meh. I didn't like it at all. I at first used raw garlic and then thought  about how gross that would end up, so sauteed it. When the pasta was done, it was still pretty not great, so I sauteed some mushrooms for about 10 mins until they'd given up their juice, and poured juice and mushrooms into the pasta. Also I used spinach and heated w/ the pasta and cheese until it was slightly wilted.

That made it marginally better. I think it might have been really delicious if I'd used feta instead of goat cheese. However, husband liked it, so 3 stars instead of 1.

I did not like the flavor. I had even made changes that I thought would help, like using hand-crushed tomatoes that had been canned last year. If I try this recipe again, I may use fresh crumbled mozzarella. I think it was the goat cheese that made the overall flavor that I didn't like.

So freaking awesome! The longest part of prep was waiting for the pasta. For those of you that would like this a little saucier, save some of the pasta cooking water and add it a little at a time until it's the consistency that you like. This one is a keeper for sure!

I added in about 1/4 cup good parmesan and used 1/2 cup reserved pasta water when making the sauce (or adding the goat cheese really).
I think the subtle nuttiness of the parmesan took the flavor up a notch and the pasta water made it very creamy.
I added lots more tomatoes as I like them and the cooked ones kind of disappeared.
Will most definitely make again as I stated here.  Nummy

An instant addition to my favorites. The goat cheese makes this feel very rich, although in reality it isn't all that heavy. And it is incredibly easy to make: so few ingredients, and nothing complex in the prep. You literally just mix it all together. I'm looking forward to making this again in the future!

I have made this recipe several times and always an entire box of penne pasta using an 8 oz goat cheese log in the recipe. I do add a diced onion, sliced mushrooms and sliced red peppers that I first cook in the olive oil. Last time I also added a finely chopped small dried jalapeño and it was quite good. Just enough heat lingering on the tongue. I also add pasta water to make the sauce more creamy and adhere well.

My arugula was spoiled so I used romaine, goat cheese is too strong for me so I used feta.  Would add roasted nuts of some sort next time but it was wonderful and fast.  My dieting husband had to have a second helping.

oh my goodness - this was amazing! on the spur of the moment, i wanted to make a pasta dish with goat cheese - looked here and found this recipe. thank you christine for sharing! i loved the creaminess of the goat cheese, the bit of peppery-spiciness of the arugula and the tomatoes (i used grape tomatoes out of preference) added that perfect little "pop" of flavor. this dish definitely stands on its own without any meats added. 
my only changes were - as mentioned, i used grape tomatoes (my personal preference), i added a little extra garlic (as is typical for me) and only used 4 oz of goat cheese (only size i could find and to be honest, it was the perfect amount). 
i will be making this again for sure!!

This is very good.  I used spinach instead of arugula and added shrimp.  The only suggestion, don't add salt, the goat cheese makes this dish salty enough.

My husband I loved this dish.  I added leftover artichoke quarters and only used one clove of garlic.  It was a huge hit!  We will definitely make this again.  Next time I would like to try spinach and maybe add capers.

Just made this with baby spinach & spiral noodles , otherwise as per recipe - was absolutely delicious, and so easy . A little bit of garlic bite, but I think that is was made it work so well. And was just creamy enough . My opinion did not need any changes, otherwise would taste like any other cheesy Alfredo dish.

I made this adding roasted chicken and asparagus. This made a full and tasty meal!  The arugula was spicy. It was fresh from our garden, but a bit more mature which gave it  more bite. Go with baby arugula if you want a milder flavor.

Made this tonight and it's fabulous.  I used baby spinach instead as well as added some artichoke hearts. Otherwise didn't change anything and I'm loving it!

Easy and tasty! I liked someone's idea to sauté the garlic. And another person's idea to add pinenuts.

When I first prepaired it and tasted it I loved it  but I guess I made the mistake of putting it in the refrigerator while the rest of my meal cooked.  When I took it out to serve it, it became dry. I added more oil to it to spruce it up a bit and that helped but it was defiantly better before I put in the refrigerator. 

I will make it again and just serve it right after its done.

I made this for my husband and four teen/young adult children. Only two of us really cared for it, one ate it because it was in front of them and the others didn't touch it. It's a bit sharp (I expect that with goat cheese) and could use a little "creamy" factor to make the flavor a little more mild. We added grilled chicken to it for protein which was a nice touch.

Easy and delicious!  Best eaten the day it's made.  Next time I will try making a roux to better bring out the flavor of the goat cheese and coat the pasta better.

This is one of my favourites! The only modification is that  I've always sautéed the garlic in olive oil and the remainder stays the same. So delicious & easy to make.

1st time, made as written. Goat cheese was over-powering for me.

2nd time, made following changes:
  used mozzarella instead of goat cheese,
  added rice vinegar,
  added parmesan.

Next time, I plan to:
  either leave out garlic or saute it,
  might add sunflower seeds and/or avocado.

Don't underestimate a recipe with so few ingredients! These are all bold flavors and blended well. Added a little extra garlic as I always do, and I used fresh cherry tomatoes from my garden. Will definitely make again as a quick meal or snack.

I didn't know what to do with goat cheese and I had some arugula. But I added a kielbasa (turkey for lower calories), sliced and cooked with the garlic and olive oil. I added about half a cup of red wine and some balsamic to the pan, then tossed the goat cheese and arugula and tomatoes into the pan as I turned it off. 

Wonderful! My husband really loved it. The red wine/balsamic and sausage gave it a nice color with the red and green, and a wonderful flavor. 

This is a great basic recipe. I love using arugula and this is the way--fresh.  Thanks for the recipe. 

P.S. My goat cheese doesn't "crumble". I had to slice it and slide it in.

This recipe is super good and easy.  The only changes I made were to add more arugula and saute the onion with a little garlic.

I had arugula in my garden, and it was quite spicy and maybe a tad overgrown. But this was delicious!! I Substituted cream cheese for goat cheese (it's all I had), and added some partially cooked (in with the pasta pot) orange pepper. This was really good cold, the next day!

Really liked this. Only change was to add chicken mushrooms and lightly sauté the whole mixture before adding to the pasta. Can't wait to make with shrimp!

I have served this to guests a number of times  to rave reviews.  A couple of times I roasted the tomatoes before adding them.  Roasting the tomatoes creates more sauce.

Very satisfying vegetarian dish that is super fast and easy to put together. Perfect midweek dinner. Made it exactly as written. Will be a keeper, if in the mood for meat chicken or shrimp would be a great addition.

Traded arugula for spinach because that's what I had in the fridge. Simple, quick and tasty. Definitely room to add other ingredients. Used fresh goat cheese.

Two and my kids did not like this but my husband and one child did. I thought this was very bland. No flavor. It could be so  much better with some extra spices or something. I will not make this again. I did follow the directions exactly.

Delicious. Made with fresh garlic (one small clove, as it was just for me) and added some fresh basil and fresh lemon juice. Used gluten free corn pasta. Adding the hot pasta wilted the arugula just enough. Love love love this.

This is a fantastic recipe! The finished product looks a little messy, but it's a really easy, quick, and flavorful side dish or main dish. The goat cheese makes this dish creamy while the arugula gives a peppery bite. Highly recommended for something a little different than your average pasta.

This is so easy and delicious.  I have a hard time finding arugula, so I've tried beet greens and red chard.  Both were great.  I blanched both before combining.

Very yummy! Agree with some other reviewers that it's slightly bland. Will double the amount of arugula & tomatoes next time which may help with that. May also try adding some lemon juice next time per other reviewers.
Sauteed garlic and arugula in the olive oil before adding it to cheese- good idea.

I used shredded mozzarella because that was what I had on hand, and added a little Italian sausage.  I don't care much for arugula by itself, but the combination of flavors was very nice.

Great pasta but it definitely does not need two teaspoons of garlic! I found t to be too garlic-y, and I love garlic! I'd go for 1/2 tsp of garlic or none at all! And I'll try olives in it next time as well! Thanks for the start!

This went over VERY well with my boyfriend and his friend.  The original recipe I found a bit bland so I changed a few things the next time I made it.  Following the advice of other reviewers I did sundried tomatoes instead of cherry, and I sauted the garlic with some mushrooms before adding it, and it was amazing.  I strongly suggest using the sundried tomatoes.

This was easy and very satisfying. I substituted sun dried tomatoes instead of the cherry tomatoes. I also diced one zucchini and sauted it with the garlic before adding to the mixture and it gave it some extra texture and nutritional boost. I did add a little extra olive oil when combining ingredients because the goat cheese seemed too dry. Great recipe for those that like goat cheese!

I didn't have arugula or cherry tomatoes... so I improvised. I sauteed garlic and scallions together after the noodles went into the boiling water. Added a bit of crushed red pepper and basil, s+p. I had about 2/3 can refrigerated of canellini beans, so I tossed those in pan with the onions and garlic. Then I added frozen spinach. After they all had a chance to fuse flavors, I added in a handful of zante currants. After the noodles were done, I drained and returned back to pot, added goat cheese, gave it a couple of stirs, and then added the spinach mixture... have to say it's pretty much the bomb.

This was simple and yummy!  I did saute the garlic in the olive oil and some white wine, and added the arugala to wilt, then the tomatoes to coat.  I used almost a whole box (16 oz) of pasta and thought it was still very cheesy.  I will use less olive oil next time because the cheese added extra oil to the dish.  I'll try pine nuts too.

Very tasty, though I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I sauteed the garlic in the olive oil with some red pepper flakes, then added fresh basil and oregano and the tomatoes.  Then I added that to the pasta with the goat cheese and arugula and I also added chives.  Used more arugula and tomatoes.

3.5 stars.  I added mushrooms and asparagus.  I bought sun dried tomatos to put on but did not like the way it tasted when I added, so only put a few.   Sprinkled with parmesean before serving.  All in all, it was good, but not great.

This was very delicious!  I added mushrooms which I sauteed with the garlic and also added some black olives.  My other advice would be to let the pasta cool a little before adding it to the sauce.  My goat cheese all melted from the heat.  It still tasted great but I would have liked some crumbles.

I made a variation of this recipe to go with grilled burgers for dinner and thought it was delicious - I could have just had this and been happy :) I used 4 oz goat cheese, because that's what I had, and mine was a bit too soft to remain in crumbles.  I also used a bag of arugula blend salad instead of just arugula (I used the whole bag), I forgot the garlic and I used the newer veggie pasta - I think it's called garden delights? I also added beets to the salad and maybe a TBS balsamic.   It was so good, I'm planning to make it again tonight, but with bowtie pasta, and plan to top each serving with beets so the whole dish isn't red :)

This had a wonderful flavor!  I highly recommend using fresh ingredients, especially the arugula as it gives it a spice that keeps it from being bland.  I reduced the recipe down to 4 servings so I could use a 4 oz block of goat cheese.  I sliced up some link sausage and sauteed it to go with it and had dinner ready in about 20 minutes.

This dish had such rich flavor and my husband loved it, too. I didn't have any goat cheese on hand, so I used fresh grated Parmesan instead and it still turned out good, except for the cheese melting and sticking together in clumps. But I'm guessing the goat cheese doesn't do that.

Very good! I eyeballed the amounts and used 2 cans of tomatoes in place of chopped fresh, and sauteed it all together. The goat cheese goes a long way, especially if you decrease the pasta as I do, so watch how much you use and adjust to taste. I added several shakes of oregano and basil and it was very delicious. Adding chopped spinach and mushrooms is great too. Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful! I brought it to a wine party matching this dish with a Pinot Grigio. It was a hit! Everyone loved it. I added some sauteed mushrooms and a little more garlic. I can't wait to make this again for another occasion.

This was really good.   I used feta instead of goat cheese and tortellini instead of penne.  It was so quick and easy.  My husband wasn't crazy about it b/c he thought the arugula was too bitter.  I'll try again w/ spinach.

This was very tasty and easy.  I would maybe cut back on the garlic next time since it is raw, and it overwhelms to peppery taste of the arugula a little.

This tastes really tangy at first, which could be good or bad depending on your tastes. I used spinach and regular onions and they worked well. The taste really grew on me. I had it for lunch the next day and thought that it reheated well. I just added a touch of milk before popping it in the microwave. I would make this again.

YEA BABY! We loved it! Im still chewing gum to mask the garlic on the day 
after... but worth it! Still talking about the great blend!  Have it when you dont
have to be close the next am with clients. LOVED IT
