What an easy and delicious recipe! 5 stars for simplicity alone! I actually used some leftover brown rice in place of the insta-rice to make it even easier (just threw the already-cooked brown rice in at the end to heat up, and let it sit for 5 minutes like the recipe says). I liked the flavor too--pretty straightforward, but good. I could see adding a bit of wine to deglaze the pan after cooking the chicken, onion, and garlic for a touch more flavor if you felt so inclined (I will do this next time--and there will be a next time for this recipe!!). I might add some oregano too. Also, I simply salted to taste for this recipe, and I think we used approx 1 tsp. 2 tsps would have been too salty for our tastes--so I would definitely watch the salt. Served this topped with some freshly grated Parmesan and a side of roasted broccoli. Perfect easy dinner! Thank you so much for the recipe!
