My rating is just for the pork chop marinade and not the mustard sauce. I had three fat boneless sirloin chops and this made more marinade than we needed. I didn't have Sherry vinegar, so used plain Sherry wine instead, and I added some toasted sesame seeds. The chops marinated all day in the refrigerator. We grilled our pork sirloins over charcoal and the thick rich marinade gave such a wonderful finger lickin flavorful crust to the juicy tender meat inside. I think this would be great on chicken also. I will try the mustard sauce at another time, just didn't have all the ingredients for it.

Great marinade!  I thought the sauce was phenomenal but my husband found it to be too thick and sweet tasting.

Far and away the best marinade I've made including quite a few good marinades from this site.  This is in a class by itself.  Exceptional flavor that I could easily see using on chicken and beef as well.  The marinade was so simple, just assemble and measure a variety of ingredients and grate a little ginger.  The only challenge was obtaining all the ingredients as there were a few our rural grocer didn't have that I ordered from Amazon (got free shipping when had enough stuff for $25).  The mustard sauce was good though it took a little more easy effort.  But it's the marinade that rocked our boat.  However, I agree with other reviewers that using both the marinade and the mustard sauce is well worthwhile and a great counterpoint.  And the chops were so tender and moist even though we used a good though not high end cut of pork chops.   While I added a few things to the pantry that we weren't familiar with, we liked each one and will use them all in this and other dishes.  So for those having to add a few items to the pantry, these ingredients are not one trick ponies.  For those who are likewise unfamiliar with Hoisin sauce, it is like a thick, not so salty, teriyaki.  Of course, the marinade altered it into something immeasurably better.  It was a happy learning experience and a dining delight.  This is a blue ribbon winner.  My husband and I would happily give more stars if such were possible.

Visually this should receive 5 stars but because I wasn't very impressed with the finished product I had to knock it back to 3 stars.  The sauce was delicious but the meat was not overly flavorful.  My advice would be to make extra sauce for dipping.  Pork is so dense that it's difficult for marinades to soak through very deep and that was the problem with this (and all pork dishes) in my opinion.  It looked sooooo good when it came off the grill but the flavor was a disappointment.

I have made this several times already and I just had to comment. Don't be thrown off by how many ingredients there are, they all work beautifully together and the taste is amazing. don't try to add more or take away anything. you will NOT be disappointed! TIP: if you are using the think chops marinate overnight and remember to turn them or if using the bag option, adjust the chops in the bag, several times. i use boneless chops about an inch thick ( i have small kids and its just what we buy lol) the flavor is amazing. USE the sauce. creme fraiche is hard to come by where i live so I use sour cream. (not saying this works for dessert, it will separate, but in this it does.)

My rating is for the marinade only since I didn't make the sauce. Since I only used two small boneless pork chops I reduced the amount of ingredients by 1/4 and made modifictions based on what I had on hand and the short (less than an hour) marinating time I had. I substituted powdered garlic and ginger for the fresh since they pack more of a punch in short marinating times. I substituted apple cider vinegar for the combo as written and I used agave instead of sugar because it has a less sweet taste. I eliminated the pepper since I thought the other ingredients added enough flavor. I don't have an outdoor grill so I cooked these on my electric countertop grill for about 8 minutes. These were very tasty and moist. I served this with a saute of green beans, mushrooms and garlic topped with toasted sesame seeds to continue the Asian theme. Will definitely use this marinade again and try it with chicken and tofu as well.

This turned out exceptional.  Make sure you don't over cook.  I tppk them off when my meat probe said 140 degrees.  Followed recipe as is and a all that was left were the bones.  Made it for six and all asked for the recipe.

These chops were packed with such delicious flavor!  My chops were 2" thick.  Next time I will use chops about an inch thick.   I marinated it for 24 hours and cooked it in a grill pan on top of the stove finishing it for 20 mins. in the oven.  Very juicy.  The mustard sauce was to die for!  I will always keep the ingredients for this recipe in my pantry for chops as well as chicken breasts.  I also will always keep this mustard sauce in my fridge. It would be so delicious on many foods.  The only changes I made were to substitute parsley for cilantro and plain greek yogurt for the creme fraiche in the mustard sauce.  Many reviewers stated that the chops were so flavorful without the sauce.  While this is true, the mustard sauce really knocks it out of the park!  Definitely give this a try.

This was an excellent marinade for babyback pork ribs.  After baking marinated ribs in the oven for 2.5 hours at 300 degrees (wrap pan tightly with foil) - then drain the fat and apply a glaze to make them look appetizing.  When guests arrived, we then did a short grilling on the outdoor grill and basted with more of the marinade before serving.  Everyone raved!  Didn't use the other sauce.

Amazing!  Fantastic!  Made a few substitutions, but it didn't matter to outcome.  Thought I had rice vinegar, but didn't, so had to sub.  Found Mirin in the pantry (Japanese sweeten sake, made from rice wine), so used that insead of rice vinegar and did not add the sugar called for, since it was sweetened already.  Also, couldn't find sherry vinegar, so used cider vinegar.  For the dipping sauce, used sour cream instead of creme fraiche.  Marinated pork chops overnight and hubby grilled them in his kamado grill.  Made a great Father's Day meal!  Served with grilled corn and braised cabbage.  PS.  You gotta watch Chef John's video...he is a hoot (as well as a talented chef)!  Note: The mustard sauce balances the sweetness of the the marinade...it's a must have for the complete experience! :-)

This was great! I dont usually eat pork at all, but this recipe made me want to try it again. Im also not usually a fan of foo foo sauce person, but the sauce actually made the pork taste even better! I mean just in the marinade alone they tasted great, but the sauce just added even more flavor to them! I really enjoyed this recipe!!!

This is the best mouth-watering tender piece of meat.  Make sure that you let the meat rest before cutting to retain the juices.

After making this recipe, my family thinks I am the most amazing cook! :) My in laws say they've never tasted such tender and delicious pork! Everyone was licking their fingers and fighting for the last piece of meat. We used this on ribs, the longer you marinate the better (I've made it twice now) I also substituted the sugar with honey and it was delicious, I also did not have the sherry vinegar so just skipped it, it was still absolutely amazing! Everyone asks me now to make "my" amazing marinade! ;) Shhhh! Thanks Chef John!

I was looking for a last minute idea for dinner and Chef's Johns recipes are always easy to make. These were by far the best pork chops I have ever made. I did not have the sherry vinegar, so I replaced it with dry sherry. Remember to only add as much heat/spice as your family enjoys. I also only had time for the chops to marinade three-hours. Grilled them using the indirect heat on a gas grill, basting them several times, for about 25-30 minutes. The family said they were the best they ever had. The chops look beautiful and tasted even better. I served them with the dipping sauce. We thought the sauce was good, but not necessary, the chops were just perfect without any dipping sauces.

Hands down the best pork chops we've ever eaten in our lives. We used very thick chops, each chop weighed about a pound. I did make the mustard sauce. It was great on the pork chops, not so great on my rice. These are definitely on the make-again list!

I really wanted to like this, but it wasn't for us. The flavors didn't work well and the mustard sauce was just too over powering - even in a small amount.

This is my second rating of this dish.

I have really enjoyed this marinade. Infact I have been buying the Hoisin sauce in the 20 ounce bottles lately. I've been marinading chicken thighs during the day and grilling them on my Big Green Egg for dinner. The BGE is a grill, a smoker and an oven in my back yard. I bake them in the BGE at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes, until they are 195 degrees and the skin is a little crispy. I baste them with the marinade 3 times while they are baking and they are really, really good. 

Try it... It just as good on chicken as it is on pork chops. I use the dipping sauce on the chops but not on the chicken.

I love to cook and try new things. This recipe is fantastic!  Tender, melt in your mouth with great complex flavors. The only thing I added was to bacon wrap the chops, stealing the idea from another recipe.  Can't wait to make it again. This is really, really good!

Amazing!  Best pork chops ever!  I didn't have the ingredients to do the mustard sauce, but the marinade was great.  I cooked them inside on a grill pan and used thick cut chops.  A new family gave!

I pretty much went by the recipe, and it was Fabulous! By far the best recipe I have gotten from allrecipes. I also did an acorn squash with this. I cut the squash into 3 inch strips, marinaded   it in gobs of butter, and bourbon barrel maple syrup. Put the squash right on the hot grill, turning and basting with the butter, maple syrup marinade. also delish!

Very good dish.  Surprised at the mustard sauce.  Not much of a mustard fan, but this stuff was good.  Lots of work, but worth it for the flavor.  Make extra sauce, steam or stir-fry some veggies, and use the sauce on those as well.  Yummy!

Marinade was delicious, but cooking the pork as long as specified makes it dry and bland. Next time I would limit the pork to 2 minutes a side at high direct heat to get the grill marks then at most 5 minutes a side at medium indirect heat to get moist medium rare pork chops.

The food wad good, recipe itself was confusing. I turned my grill on high, followed the directions and moved the chops to a lower heat area after 8mins, then they were done a few minutes after that. If I left them on for the full 25mins, they'd have been shoe leather. What was I supposed to do with the reserved half of the broth?

It's a long ingredient list but don't let that scare you off. These were fantastic and the hot mustard sauce made them even better! I made a firecracker sauce to go with the mustard sauce and served it all with chunky skin on mashed potatoes.

Didn't like the mustard sauce, but the meat reminds me strongly of the "meat on a stick" we get at Chinese restaurants. Yummy!

This recipe is amazing.  The marinade and the mustard sauce were more than 5 stars. I especially liked the mustard sauce (note: used sour cream vs creme fraiche).

Easy to make and delicious! I didn't have bone in pork chops just pork loins about 1/2 inch thick, so I didn't cook them as long as the recipe indicated. But other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Very tasty. Served at a BBQ got rave reviews from the guests. Marinated pork over night and they were flavorful and moist. Definitely a keeper, will be making again!

Amazing dish, I set this up tonight and paired it with Garlic whipped Potatoes and did some corn with sauteed onions. And even had some asparagus that I cooked, blanched and grilled. I do agree with Chef John that a smoked grilled flavor is the best but I didn't have any coals tonight so in place I used a teaspoon of liquid smoke. Came out amazing!! Thanks for the recipe Chef!

I marinated these over night and broiled them since it was too cold outside to grill.  The marinade makes for a nice flavor in the chops.

I made the marinade only for thick pork loin chops. I dont really see the point of the mustard sauce as this was very flavorful and rich by itself.  Keep extra sauce for dipping!

I thought this was excellent! I especially liked the mustard sauce and have used it on other things ------ cheese and crackers, sausage.  I didn't have sherry vinegar but it was fine. I will definitely make it again. The grill time was fine for me but my spouse who likes all things well-done would have grilled his longer.

I have a great marinade I've been using for the past 25 yrs, but I thought I'd try this one, and boy, was I glad I did.  My husband and daughter loved it!  I didn't change a thing.  I did try it with chicken and it was very good.  I tried it with ribs, and it was "Okay" Definitely finger licking good!

4.5 stars!  These were delicious!  We found that the cook time that was recommended was a little too long which was why I didn't give it 5 stars.  I couldn't find hot mustard powder where I live, so I used prepared hot mustard, and it was delicious!  We thoroughly enjoyed both the meat and the sauce.  The sauce would be good served on chicken as well!

I am rating the marinade portion of this recipe only, as I did not make the mustard sauce.  I used pork tenderloin rather than chops and made the full amount of marinade, which was plenty.  I followed the recipe to a “T” and marinated the tenderloin for about 9 hours.  Well, I had high hopes for this recipe, however I thought the hoisin sauce overpowered everything else in the marinade and that’s all I could taste.  Sorry Chef John, but this one didn’t do it for us.

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the cooking time as I had pork loin chops and they weren’t as thick as those called out in the recipe. I can’t say enough how much we enjoyed it! I agree that the chops are dee-lish on their own, but I must say that the dipping sauce puts the dish over the top. I think It’s important  to have a really good hard sear on the chops as well. I will definitely be making this again!

I didn't  make the sauce because I was feeling lazy and I had a feeling the marinade could carry the show by itself.  It can! But now I feel I really need to make it again and make the sauce too.  I have a feeling the sauce will up everything a notch.

I made this for my husband and daughter last night and they loved it.  My husband rarely eats pork, so this was a nice surprise.

I followed the recipe for the marinate and let the pork sit overnight.  I doubled the recipe since I was using 6 chops and added a couple of drops of liquid smoke since I'll be using a gas grill.  The smokiness came through.  I saved 40% of the marinade for basting as instructed.  I didn't make the mustard sauce and didn't miss it...although I might next time and may use chicken drumsticks or breasts.  Delicious!!  Thank you, Chef!!!

Fantastic! I marinated for a full day and served it for a group of friends and we all loved it, will definitely make it again. In the sauce I substituted a teaspoon of  fresh grated horseradish for the cayenne pepper and added a tablespoon of honey.

Outstanding!  The sweetness of the marinade mixed with the mustard sauce is amazing.  I used sour cream as I didn’t have any Creme Fraische on hand.  One of the best meals we have had recently.

Really good and kind of different from what I usually cook up. I followed the recipe as closely as possible, but I didn’t have sherry vinegar so I used balsamic instead. Also, I was not able to find powdered hot mustard so used hot mustard paste. I marinated the chops for 24-hours, dried them, then seared them on the grill for 3 minutes each side. I then cooked them over indirect heat, basting and flipping every them every five minutes for 25 minutes. They turned out very pretty. Even tho I hate eggs, I still made the mustard dipping sauce exactly as Chef John did in the video. When I did the taste-test, I could taste the egg and I didn’t care for it.  But, I still tried dipping my first bite of pork chop in it and I don’t know why, but OMG, it was delicious! I served with red cabbage and mashed cauliflower. I would make again.

I made the marinade, not the mustard sauce. Because I had 6 large pork chops, I doubled the marinade recipe, and it made more than enough. I marinated the chops for 24+ hours, then I grilled them.  They were amazing and I will definitely make them again!

I also liked the marinade very much and plan on trying it with chicken next. The sauce was too tart for me, probably the vinegars. Since it’s now November here in New England, I “grilled” my chops on an indoor grill pan. Still tasted great!

absolutely love these pork chops!
the mustard sauce is HOT and you could cut the amount of mustard sauce served by half but still works for leftovers and anything else you many want to use mustard sauce on

Made this 3 times so far!  Dad loves them!  This recipe  has started me using my parents charcoal grill that had been untouched since the 80s.  Think I over cooked them first couple of times but the third time was the charm.  Thanks Chef John!

Ok I'm a HUGE chef John fan.  So I made comparing this to his other fabulous recipes. This one was too sweet for me. The mustard sauce was ok, but not exceptional.  Yes I had to make a couple substitutions, but that's nothing new.  No creme fraishce, subbed sour creme. No spicy Chinese dry mustard, used a little extra regular dried mustard.  Boneless pork chops so I adjusted the time. They turned out picture perfect.  Just not quite a typical chef John phenomenal taste.

Made this for my supper club peeps several time since they went crazy over it!  The creme fraise/mustard sauce recipe makes a lot so I froze the leftovers in ice cube trays and popped out what I needed whenever I made the pork chops.  Freezes great and saves some time!

This was delicious.  I would have given it 5 stars, except that it took quite a while to make and requires many ingredients.  Since it's cold outside now, I pan fried the chops instead of bbqing them.  I also pounded them flat because I didn't have  a significant length of time to marinade them.  Nevertheless, they were soft, juicy, and delicious.  When I make this recipe again, I won't bother with the mustard sauce, although it was great.  But the chops were juicy and tasty even without the mustard sauce.

Even with low sodium soy sauce the marinade was a bit salty, but it was easily fixed by adding a pinch of sugar to taste.

This was fabulous! The marinade for the pork chops was perfect and the mustard sauce was a great accompaniment to the chop. I only used 2 T. of sugar and I couldn't find hot mustard powder so I just used hot Chinese mustard. It was awesome!

Absolutely one of the best pork chop recipes I have ever used. The marinade penetrated the meat after 8 hours and the homemade Dick sauce was very flavorful. I smoked the chops on a Traeger pellet smoker.

These are delicious!!  I didn't have any ginger, so didn't include that in the marinade, and didn't have creme fraiche, so didn't make the mustard sauce.  We loved them, anyway.  Next time I will make sure to have all ingredients on hand, and follow the recipe, but even with the missing ingredients, thought they were one of the best ways we've fixed pork chops.

I made no changes except my chops were 1" (jealous of Chef John's). These were exceptional!! A new favorite, since both my hubby and I absolutely love the flavors of both the glaze/marinade and the sauce. My mouth is watering just remembering our dinner last night! Served w/ plain mashed potatoes (cheated, store bought) which was perfect considering how much flavor in chops/sauce. Chef is right, the sauce shared on the chops is phenomenal! Next time I will also serve broccoli or sugar snaps. Hubby took leftovers for lunch and he will happily share the scent w/ coworkers but not the lunch. I did marinade overnight b/c something came up. Fantastic! Thanks, Chef John for a memorable new addition to our recipe bank.

The best thick center cut chops We've ever had. So moist and flavorful; my wife doesn't usually like pork chops but this one made her a believer in pork! I didn't even make the sauce for topping it off, could only have been better.

Very delicious!  We almost skipped the mustard sauce, but we are so happy we didn't as it may have been our favorite part of the meal, because it complimented the side dishes as well as the pork chops.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Used chops on the bone and they really tasted good, left them for 24h in the marinade. The "sauce" was way too vinegary and was discarded asap, and the chops don't need it in my opinion

This was delicious!  Just the right amount of heat and you must make the mustard sauce to go with. I made a few substitutions only because i didn't have all ingredients on hand. 
i actually used boneless chicken breasts (3 large) rather than pork.  Other subsitutions: regular sherry instead of sherry vinegar; dry mustard instead of hot mustard powder; regular sour cream instead of creme fraiche.
I only had a few hours to marinate as I didn't plan in advance.
I can only imagine how good this is if you followed the recipe 'cus it was awesome with what I had on hand.
Served with the lime cilantro rice on this site. 
Although good on it's own, the mustard sauce really makes this special.

I made it just like Chef John's recipe.  It was  excellent.  We used the Big Green Egg and that gave the chop a wonderful smokey flavor.  We are big fans of Chef John because everything  turns out perfectly.

Wonderful recipe, though I omitted the extra  sauce because I am not a fan of Dijon mustard, and we didn't need the extra calories.    Just the marinade alone and cooking these on the grill made for a great dinner!

I was initially put off by the number of ingredients but I found most of them in my pantry and after tasting the final product, I would go out tomorrow if need be and buy every ingredient again to make this dish.  Just an outstanding and memorable combination of marinade and sauce.  Not only great taste, but the dark color of the marinade topped by the yellowish sauce offered a great visual presentation.   Number 1 dish for company now.

Dee-licious. Broiled in oven due to rain. The mustard sauce ROCKED. Will definitely make this again, and will steal the mustard sauce recipe for my next roast pork.

My husband said these were the best pork chops he's ever had in his entire life!! They were delicious!! I made them in the oven though (350 for 10 minutes on each side) because it's -10 degrees outside right now. I can't wait to make these on the grill this spring! I didn't make the mustard sauce...I had all the ingredients but I completely forgot. I'll make it next time. This recipe will definitely be on my go to list when hosting summer BBQs.

Followed the recipe and they were great. Cooked in gas BBQ with hickory smoke. Awesome chops! Cut down on total quantities as it makes quite a bit of marinade and there were only two chops to do. Might add a little more hot sauce next time, just a personal preference for spice.

This was o.k., but I thought the amount of ingredients was a bit much.  A lot of the ingredients are already in hoisin sauce so it seemed repetitive.  I have other recipes that are more streamlined that I like better.

Wowza! I prepared this marinade as written for four smallish bone-in pork chops and prepared on the grill...moist, flavorful and delicious.   Wouldn't change a thing.  I would love to try the sauce next time.  But as a quick, flavorful marinade, the best.  Winner and a keeper.  Thanks, CJ.

Great recipe - the whole family enjoyed it and we didn't even cover it with the mustard sauce - just grilled the pork chops and basted with the leftover marinade.  I didn't change a thing and the chops came out very flavorful, not dry and barbequing it made them delicious.

This was delicious! !!  Followed the recipe other than the turmeric (didn't have) and it turned out AWESOME!! I used a grill pan instead of charcoal and I know that would have been better, but time didn't allow. Will definitely make this again.

So much flavor. I used two large boneless 1" thick pork chops and left on the grill for 25 minutes. 20 minutes with 5 min rest before cutting would have been fine. Such bold flavor. certainly a do over!!

The marinade was really good, a unique flavor.  I really liked the sauce as well but my husband didn't care for it too much.  The sauce makes way more than you would need for 2 large pork chops.  I probably could have made 1/4 of it and still had some leftover.  Really easy to make though, just takes some patience at the grill.

Excellent pork marinade!  I've made it 3 times and got compliments each time.  Since hoisin sauce’s ingredient list starts with sugar and water, I leave out adding the white sugar.  You don’t need it. I didn't have sherry vinegar, so I just used half that amount of sherry.
I use a vacuum dish to allow the marinade to really penetrate for hours, check out a FoodSaver Quick Marinator.  I then slow cook the pork chops (don’t dry them out). Wow!  The chops are great just like that.  The mustard sauce isn’t worth the extra effort in my mind, but I’m not big on sauces when the meat is so great.
Serve this with Grilled Soy-Sesame Asparagus.

Made this recipe "by the book".  I absolutely loved it but my husband took a couple of bites and said he didn't care for the flavor... said too much of something.  I'm not sure what was "too much" but he wouldn't even finish his plate full... disappointing because I thought it was wonderful.  The meat was tender and the flavor was interesting.  Guess it's just not for everybody.

We loved this recipe.  Easy, delicious and quick, well the cooking time.
Did not need the sauce.  On the marinade, called for 1 1/2 tsp hot sauce.
We put in 1/2 tsp of Sriracha sauce.  Perfect amount of heat for us.
We also used a cast iron grille to get the grill marks and then finished
in the oven. Sliced the meat and added the remaining marinade. Meat was tender 
lots of flavor.  I would recommend this to any level of cooking skills.

This was delicious.  It was so full of flaor, just a little spicy, a nice change!  I didn't grill due to weather, but I cooked under the broiler until done.  My other half asked for seconds, and that was a first!

I followed the recipe exactly as described. I think this is the best grilled pork chop I have made. It is great without the sauce, but it is amazing with the sauce.  It is worth doing the mustard sauce.  It is quick and easy and adds an extra punch.  This will become a regular on my summer grilling menu.

This was OK, certainly not worth the cost of the various ingredients. I was skeptical of the mustard sauce until I read another reviewer's comment about the egg rolls...I love the hot mustard sauce with eggrolls! The pork was good with it, but equally good without it. I would make another, simpler recipe for asian style pork next time.

Good Lord! YUM YUM YUM! My husband and I both love to cook and we really enjoyed this recipe.  We followed it exactly.  The mustard sauce really does compliment the pork so well. This is definitely a keeper.  We marinated the chops over night. We cooked them on our cast iron grill to get the grill marks and then put them in the oven on 300 degrees F until it read 140 degrees basting every few minutes.  We also made braised cabbage from his site (Foodwishes).  I
made loaded mashed potatoes and served it with Weyerbacher's Merry Monks ale, a great ale for this meal.  Thank you for another fabulous recipe Chef John, you ROCK!

Another "Marinade Only" review: It is really great on pork. The sweetness is exactly what pork loves.  I picked up a couple bone-in pork chops at safeway.  I had to talk to the butcher to get thick cut pork.  Anyway, the marinade doesn't really penetrate like beef - so give it plenty of time.  I don't think you can overdo it with time.  I followed the recipe exactly and the results were delicious.   Adding a little more glaze while it's cooking in indirect is important.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This rating is for the marinade only. The marinade was amazing! I made the marinade exactly as directed using a low-sodium hoisin sauce. I did not baste with the marinade because I was using a George Foreman type grill and I didn't want to clean up the mess, so I took the reserved marinade and heated it to boiling in a small saucepan, while the pork was cooking, to ensure that it was safe to eat, and used that as a sauce over the pork and the broccoli/mixed veggie stir fry/jasmine rice that we ate with it. Will definitely make again!

These chops were simply incredible.  I was initially concerned with the thickness of the chops which was 1-1/2" (butcher's recommendation), but they were super moist, tender and succulent.  Since I had minimal time (3 hours) to marinade, I used a Jaccard meat tenderizer to pierce the chops before marinating.  

I didn't use the mustard side sauce since I thought there was enough flavour (and calories) in the basting sauce.  I served them with garlic smashed red potatoes (as suggested in the recipe).  My husband said he has become a pork chop lover again!

So delicious, and the pork chops turn out super tender. I marinated mine for 24 hours. My only recommendation would be to go easy on the basting, because the sauce is very rich. Goes well with white rice.

I don't feel like I can honestly rate this recipe because I altered so much BUT it turned out delicious anyway!  So, I substituted a lot of ingredients or omitted because I didn't have it on hand then I just mixed it all together and poured it over the chops then baked them for 35 mins at 375 degrees.  The remaining liquid I reduced on the stove then basted the chops when ready and served.  We loved it!!  That's a 2 year old, a 9 year old and a 16 year old that loved the chops clean!

I did not have all of the correct vinegars or ingredients for this, but I was interested in the direction of them. I used a raspberry-pomegranate vinaigrette dressing as the bulk of the marinade, some veggie oil, and S & P. My hubbie was very skeptical, thought it would be too sweet, but he was singing a different tune when he tried the end product. I used 5 boneless pork chops and served the dish with a spinach and cucumber salad. Very tasty meal!

This recipe was very good.  I used very thin pork chops and marinated them overnight.  I prepared the mustard sauce too but found my family like them better without the mustard sauce.  I am going to try it on chicken too.

Wow, these are sooooo good.  I only made the marinade as I didn't have ingredients for the sauce but I think I'll make the sauce the next time too. It was perfectly flavorful and kept the pork really, really moist.  Revised:  I made these again and the mustard sauce was really a nice addition to the pork.  I recommend you try it.

WOW!  taste like Chinese pork ribs. The side sauce is fantastic. I don't think you need it, but you will be glad you made it. We used it to dip our asparagus in.

Not one of my favorites. I thought it was a little too sweet. My oldest son liked it, but my second did not. I thought the marinade was good, but did not care for the sauce.

Great flavor, awesome marinade.  Didn't make the sauce but it didn't need it. Only marinaded about 3 hrs and it was good, would be better if I'd had the time for the 6-8hrs. definitely use a temp gauge, mine only took 20 minutes to cook thru to 140 degrees. Will definitely make again

This is really tasty and easy to make. I marinaded for the day, but next time will do overnight. The BBQ sauce is great on its own, but the mustard sauce added an unusual extra kick. I used it on pork chops and chicken -- both were great. Really good meal, and I'll make it again.
