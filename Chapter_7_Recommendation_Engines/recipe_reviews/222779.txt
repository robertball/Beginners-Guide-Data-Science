I added cumin and soy sauce and didn't put in the Worcester sauce. It's so juicy and very easy to make!

I subbed carrot for mushrooms. I didn't have horseradish mustard, so I used 1 T horseradish + 1 tsp yellow mustard. These tasted fantastic, but they were a tad bit salty and didn't hold together too well. Next time I make these, I'll use two whole eggs instead of 4 yolks and reduce the salt to 2 tsp.
