This was awesome!  Not difficult to make and absolutely delicious.  Honestly, I have never had better seafood bisque than this one.  I made a few very slight changes, but I seriously doubt they made much difference.  Instead of all lobster, I used one lobster tail, several very large scallops cut into fourths, and about 4 very large shrimp, chopped.  I used 2 ½ cups fat free milk and 2 ½ cups half and half, and I used a nice drinking sherry, not cooking sherry.  The seafood and milk changes were simply because that is what I had on hand.  But, I never use cooking sherry, as it is so salty.  As it turned out, I did have to add some salt to the bisque, but at least I was able to control it.  So after all, the cooking sherry might work fine.  I served the bisque with a simple green salad and crusty bread.  My husband commented that it was wonderful, and wants me to make it for company soon!

Fate was against me as I made this recipe - my grocery had no lobster, I got crab legs instead and they were bad!  So, I ended up with two cans of chunk crab meat - and it was still great! A lovely, heart-warming recipe...

This soup is delicious.  I had scallops I had to use - so I guess I would call my version "Scallops Bisgue".  The scallops were very large so I cut them in quarters. I used 2% milk - and it was fine. I also added 4 cloves of minced garlic.  I didn't pay attention to the comment about the cayenne pepper - "add to taste".  I just put it all in and wow - yes, gives it a lot of kick - so be careful!  It was actually very good though!  I didn't have scallions - so I just did without, but I think the scallions would have made it that much better.  SO I will be making again and again and next will try with Lobster.  BUT any seafood would be delicious.  Its such a great base for a seafood bisque.  Thanks for such wonderful recipe!  UPDATE:  made this again and this time used scallops and canned crabmeat.  Forgot about the kick of the cayenne pepper and added it all.  Next time I think I will leave the pepper out as 2 family members wouldn't eat it because of the spice.  I figure you can add cayenne to your own taste, but once its in there - its in there - so better off leaving out.  This time I also tried with 4 Cups of Fat Free Milk and 1 Cup of half and half and didn't even notice that it was lower in fat!

I read all the recipes available here and this one sounded the best. Needless to say it did not disappoint!!! I actually was going to make it with just lobster shells (add to the simmering onions and let sit with the reduction until bright red) but tails were so cheap at 5.99 a piece I bought two and got more than enough for serious lobster flavor. First of all, I sauteed with butter instead of olive oil, I love butter and use it whenever I can. I used shallots instead of green onion and added minced garlic and white pepper in addition to the suggested spices. It turned out wonderfully and I served it to my family first; my father who doesn't care for lobster ate 3 bowls. I served the bisque in toasted sourdough rounds (breadbowls). I will absolutely make this again, next time with crab, I think!!!

Wonderful Bisque!  I have made this recipe several times.  Followed directions exactly, came out perfect and have varied a little and came out perfect.  Some of my variations: I used fish stock once instead of Chicken both, butter instead of olive oil and used shrimp and crab meat instead of lobster.  I have a pot of this on my stove as I type :)  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

This recipe is amazing!   I did alter it a bit...added carrots and celery...and instead of all milk I used equal parts heavy cream and milk.  I made this recipe for 20.  We used 5 large broiled lobster tails instead of claws....asparagus and cheddar garlic drop biscuits to complete our Christmas Eve brunch.

i had to tweak this recipe a lot but i still found that i didn't achieve the taste i was going for. i used lobster broth instead of chicken stock but still found it to be slightly bland and a little too milky. 
i'm still searching for the perfect lobster bisque after trying this one.

DELISH!!!  I did not have white wine so I used  Stella Artois beer: 1/2 cup.   I used  just a PINCH of the cayenne pepper and it produced a wonderful heat that complemented the dish.

I have made this soup a few times and there is never a drop left! I make it with 1% milk. I served this last Christmas to 20 people and everybody asked for more.

Fantastic! I did make a few changes though. I substituted a cup of milk for heavy cream and omitted the cayenne but doubled the Old Bay. This is the second time I have made it and my boyfriend loves it. Thanks!

Everyone I've ever made this for absolutely loves it!!   Although they disagree about how much cayenne it needs.  I think it's perfect they way it is written except I usually add the tomato paste after all the other liquid ingredients are in and then just let it dissolve on it's own.  The suggestions of others are also quite good and make a nice variation.  I think iluvpastry might have misread the directions about the tomato paste and added the whole can because the 1/2 of a small can seems to me to give it just the right color and flavor.

This is the best recipe for lobster bisque!  I made a few subs out of necessity.  1.  I used 1 cup of sherry because I was out of white wine and 2.  I used 2.5 C heavy cream and 2.5 cups whole mild to make it creamier.  I also left out the green onion because I forgot to buy it.  This is the closest I've ever come to recreating true bisque like you find in New England - thank you!

I followed this recipe exactly, against my better judgement.  Lobster bisque is one of my favorites but I didn't care for the worchestire sauce flavor.  Next time I will omit and hopefully have a better result.

This bisque came out nice. Beautiful color and taste. The cayenne made it out to be more of a southwesty tasting bisque. I guess I was trying to find something different and found it. But I think I will go with a more New Englandy recipe next time. I would add less cayenne next time unless you really know you want it spicey. I thought the spice took away from the lobster taste I really wanted. Probably would only make again if I knew somebody who would really like it.

Used 5 tbs butter instead of olive oil. Used lump crab meat, claw crab meat, and lobster pieces. Doubled the Cayenne Pepper.  Used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk.  Might want to consider adding additional flour if you want it thicker, but using the suggested amounts seemed to be fairly thick.  Had a great taste and a bit of a zing. Served in bread bowls, which was great (very filling!) and also toasted the inside pieces from the bread bowl and used as a "cracker substitute".  Thoroughly enjoyed! Don't be afraid to add your own touch to the recipe!

Very good.  Will use less tomato paste next time.  I used 4 cups of half and half instead of milk and lobster tails instead of claws.  Added instant potato buds to thicken it up as we prefer a thicker chowder.

I absolutly loved this recipe!  I did make some adjustments because of what I had in my kitchen but it turned out beautifully.  I had quests over and one of them literally had four bowls of this.  Plus I got a call the next day from two of the other guests to get the recipe. My adjustments were: I used 4 cups of whipping cream and the rest regular milk.  I added garlic to the onions when sauteing and I used a whole can of tomato paste instead of half. I also added some crab meat to bulk up the seafood factor.  I will definitly be making this again in the future!

I picked this recipe because it had the more complex components such as Sherry but relatively simple.  Unfortunately, I won't be making this again.  I like my bisque much creamier and the ceyenne pepper was just too much.  This soup is spicy & bisque is not supposed to be spicy.  My husband did like it a lot but if you are looking for a traditional bisque, this isn't it.

This soup is every bit as good as the indulgent version you will find at a restaurant. I'll cut back on the cayenne next time, but other than that, it is perfect.

This has become one of my regular dishes. Easy and delish. Works beautifully with canned crab as well.

Delicious!!  My first try at making lobster bisque and it came out great - easy to make, too.  I used 3 lobster tails - sauteed them in the onions until onions were translucent, removed tails and set aside.  Then I added the tails back in once the milk, broth, and seasonings were added and let them simmer in the bisque for ~10 minutes (used meat thermometer to test - 145 degrees was perfect - thoroughly cooked but very tender).  I removed the tails and let the bisque continue to simmer for 5 mores minutes while I removed the shells and cut the lobster into bite-sized chunks.  I omitted the cayenne pepper because I do not like spice but think I may add a tiny pinch next time.  Will also try shallots instead of white onions next time, too (just because I love shallots).  Great recipe as is!  Thanks!!

Simple and very easy to make.  After putting  all the ingredients together, after a few simple tweaks, I put everything in the crock pot to cook.  Delicious and a now a family favorite!

I make this every Christmas as part of our non traditional Christmas dinner. Compliments the crab stuffed mushrooms also in All Recipes and the Tritip. Delish!!

I made it last night with a few slight changes. After adding the broth and milk it was pretty clumpy. I don't like biting into onion anyways so I ran it all through a blender. It made it really smooth and creamy. The lobster was super expensive so rather than spending a fortune on 1 1/2lbs lobster, I bought a 1/2lb lobster tail and subbed the rest with a small package of artificial crab meat, a cup of scallops and a cup of cocktail shrimp (shrimp and scallops cut into bite sized pcs). After allowing the last 3 ingredients to simmer while the lobster tail cooked I tried the broth and it was good but was missing something. I ended up adding 3/4 stick of butter and it made all the difference in flavor.  It was runnier than I would have liked so I slowly added cornstarch until it thickened to my liking. After adding the lobster, the soup ended up sitting on simmer for about an hour and a half before we were ready to eat but it turned out quite well! There is a very slight bite to it probably bc of the cayenne so if you don't like spicy I'd cut the cayenne back a little. I don't really like spicy but it wasn't too much for me.

Definitely needs heavy cream instead of milk. Or a combination. It didn't really have the taste of bisque as it was bland and too much tomato paste. Very disappointed in this recipe.

Hey Folks, this is THE one!  I use a blend of milk & cream for the consistency we like.  Almost any seafood works.  Make a day ahead, sans seafood, then add seafood & gently reheat next day before serving.  This blend of sherry & white wine is so yummy!!.  Annie:  THANK YOU!!

This is just awful. It tasted like an onion/tomato broth. Not at all like a restaurant style bisque. Wasted a lot of money.

This tastes nothing like lobster bisque. Overall this recipe was bland. The tomato paste was too much leading to an overpowering taste. And the cayenne didn't fit in at all
