My husband and I love this recipe. For two salmon pieces, I use 1/2 cup sour cream AT LEAST 1 1/2 tsp of curry powder and I add maybe 1/8 tsp of coriander to add a zing.  Really, I just keep adding the spices 'til it tastes good!  Put a piece of tin foil on the baking sheet to reduce clean up.

Very quick,easy and delicious.  I didn't have sour cream so I substitued mayo and added some garlic powder to the curry. A squeeze of lemon completes the fish..will make again.

This recipe is wonderful. I add a lot more curry powder than it calls for (approx. a quarter cup) and I add some garlic powder to the mix.  It is very moist and flavorful!UPDATE: Added thin sliced onions (about a half cup) and Cyenne pepper to the mix. Oh yummo! :)

I had a leftover bottle of green curry paste and a can of coconut milk, so I figured why not? I doubled the amount of curry paste, added some garlic powder and lime juice and mixed it all in with the coconut milk. I decided to marinate the salmon in it for about two hours prior, and I ended up baking it with all the marinade poured on. Ended up with a wonderful flavor, and I was super-pleased that it came from such a simple recipe. 4/5 only because I ended up substituting a major ingredient; I have no idea how this tastes with sour cream.

First of call, thank you to the 1,300 plus members who have saved this recipe, and for those who have taken the time to recreate and review.

Here is a bit of clarifying information re some differences between curry 'paste' which my recipe calls for, and curry 'powder'.  I created this very simple recipe using Yellow Curry Paste. The brand name I prefer is Mae Ploy, a well-known Thai brand.

Here is the ingredients list: Garlic, lemongrass, shot, dried red chile, salt, galanga, cumin, cinnamon, star anise, tumeric, kaffir lime peep and coriander seed.

On the other hand, a typical curry powder, McCormick's is the most widely used one here in the U.S. contains:  Coriander, fenugreek, tumeric, cumin, black pepper, bay leaves, celery seed, nutmeg, cloves, onion, redd pepper and ginger.

Very different products, and like apples to oranges when comparing the 'right' amount to use. McCormick suggests 2 teaspoons for a standard 4 serving recipe as a jumping off point, however this particular recipe was not formulated using the quite different tasting powder.

Call it a pet peeve, but I will never down-rate a recipe as being 'too mild' or 'too plain' or 'not enough flavor/heat etc' when substitutions have been made, as in the case of paste vs powder.

Yogurt is a great sub for the sour cream, and I have made it with both regular and lowfat sour cream as well as lowfat plain (regular and Greek) yogurt and found it quite good.

Hopefully this claification will be of help!

I made this tonite.  Wow! Was this ever good.  When i went to the store they had red, yellow, and green curry paste..I chose the red.  I added some crushed garlic and a little pepper, and a squirt of lemon when the fish came out of the oven.  Served with brown Basmati rice, carrots, and broccoli.  Simple and good and healthy.  The house still smells great.

Thanks!

Pretty good and darned easy. I did have to double the curry paste to get enough flavor, though. (I used massaman curry paste -- I wonder which kind the recipe writer used?) I also added a bit of garlic and salt, and garnished the finished dish with cilantro leaves and chopped peanuts.  People who are substituting curry powder -- it is probably tasty in its own way, but curry powder isn't substitutable for curry paste. It's a different beast, really. Please don't rate this recipe low if you substitute curry powder and it doesn't work for you.  I think the recipe's pretty forgiving, though. If you mix the spice with the sour cream and it tastes good at that point, it will probably make tasty fish. If it tastes bland at that point, add more spice! The basic technique works with other flavors, too.

I loved it! plus it's easy and fairly quick. My wife liked it but was less enthusiastic than I. As a beginning cook, I don't know what curry paste is. So I followed other suggestions and used curry powder. Ended up using 2 tsp for 1 cup sour cream. That was just the exact ratio for me, but a little bit strong for my wife.

A little bland for me.  I will try this again since it's so simple and quick (took less than 5 min prep time) but will give a good, tart plain yoghurt a try instead of the sour cream.  That should go nicely with the curry.

I'll first admit I used curry powder rather than paste. This recipe is great because it provides plenty of flavor without overwhelming the salmon with a more complex spice treatment. The fish is quite moist. The result of such a simple recipe is a less layered taste than a traditional Indian preparation, so serve this with basmati rice and the Easy Curried Cauliflower from this site, which has more "layers" and quite a kick, and call it a successful dinner. That's what I'll be doing.

I really loved this recipe. Although, I doubled the curry paste, if not tripled (I didn't keep track). It was so spicy that we were sweating. And the leftover sauce was great on rice.

This salmon recipe is great.  It's tangy and spicey at the same time.  Gives a nice flavoring and takes the fishy taste away that can occur during cooking.  It's great with a nice white wine as well.  I also tried this on the BBQ and it turned out great.

Curry paste is not the same as curry powder. Curry paste is.. well.. a paste. Personally I think paste is ten times better than powder. I have used brown and yellow, but I think green would be just as good. Depending on the kind of paste you get, one tablet is good, or even one tablespoon.

Depending on the brand of the paste, you may have some trouble mixing it into the sour cream. I heated up my paste a bit of oil with some garlic. Added a bit of cayenne for a good kick and topped off with some cilantro and steamed peas. Yum.

Very tasty! I used thai red curry paste and substituted plain low fat yoghurt for the sour cream to lower the fat content. I might increase the curry paste next time for more 'bite' but the salmon was moist and full of flavour.. A definite keeper.

What a great idea. Since first making this, I've used the stuff-in-sour-cream concept several times--like with garlic and herbs, chopped jalapenos, whatever--and it always turns out great. I do prefer anything with curry in the name to be a little spicier, so we added extra curry paste (much better with paste than powder) and garlic. But anything with three ingredients that tastes really good is a keeper.

This was very good! Salmon turned out moist. I did however only have curry powder so I used 1 tab curry, added some coriander,cumin,chili, onion and garlic powder. Topped this with scallions and cilantro. Also do not forget the salt.

This was pretty tasty. It was fast and simple. I subbed yogurt for the sour cream, and that was just fine. I think I quadrupled the curry paste, but I didn't keep track. I also added a touch of honey for some sweetness; It could have used some garlic powder and lime juice but I didn't have any. All in all, this was something I would make again.

Super easy!!  I always try recipes as written the first time and adjust as needed the second time.  The only thing I will do next time is add more curry paste as we prefer a little more 'kick'.

WOW! so simple, so terrific! I used 1/2 yogurt, 1/2 lite sour cream and red curry paste from a can. The taste reminded me a bit of the red rooster chili mayo in sushi.  What a great flavor! We served over kasha with sliced summer tomatoes and cucumbers.

Pretty good, however, curry was a staple in my house growing up, so I made a few changes; some chopped cilentro, a bay leaf in the sauce, salt to taste, cubed potatoes, minced habenaro, and garlic. I served it over rice with stuffed mushrooms, and it was gone in no time.

Very good! I am always looking for new salmon recipes and I would never have thought to put these ingredients together. I used green curry paste, and probably quadrupled the amount. It was delicious with fresh cilantro sprinkled on top after baking.

Since I didn't have curry paste, I simply used curry powder.  I found this VERY bland, so I tried garlic powder, tumeric, salt and added more curry.  I thought that maybe the salmon would add to it's flavor.  However, I feel it simply ruined some otherwise good salmon.  It was moist, but really didn't have any flavor, what I did taste was bitter (maybe from too much curry or the tumeric).  Sorry, we didn't care for it.

It's not bad, it's not good.  I put a lot more curry powder + garlic powder in with the sour cream and it was still pretty bland.  Thankfully I seasoned the fish with salt, pepper, and more garlic powder before topping it with the mixture.

Simple and delicious, I've used both sour cream and mayo as did another user. I use curry powder, a lot since I like the flavor and I add garlic powder or minced garlic and onions or onion powder.

I thought this was pretty good and my husband loved it.  I only had curry powder so I upped the amount and added some other spices.

It doesn't get much easier than this but we didn't think the flavors worked that well. There are much better salmon recipes out there that require just as little effort. Thanks anyway.

This was a nice last-minute recipe when it was almost time to grocery shop again.  The salmon was very moist and went well with some mashed sweet potato.

I made this but didn't have curry paste and instead substituted with curry powder.  I mixed it in with the sour cream until the mixture tasted right.  And it was delicious!  Such a simple recipe and so tasty.  The fish was moist and full of flavor.  Thank you for sharing this!

Makes a pretty good meal.  I had curry powder, so I heated up a bit of olive oil first, sauteed some leek and then mixed in about 2 Tbsp of curry until it turned into a paste.  Mixed the paste into the sour cream and followed the recipe.

Boring.  Even though I doubled the red curry paste, added coriander, salt and pepper, this was still too flat tasting.  Won't be making again.

For a quick dinner with only two ingredients, it was really pretty good.  I was out of curry paste and substituted about 1 tsp thai chili paste and approx 2 Tsp of curry powder.  Plus, I used light sour cream.

Wasn't bad, wasn't great either.  Made just one piece to try it out.  Even living in Alaska I didn't want to try a new recipe and waste a whole fish on a recipe that didn't wow me.

Plain yogourt instead of sour cream, a 1/4 cup curry powder for the paste and the garlic powder and thin onion slices as recommended by another reviewer.  Very good.

Oh my gosh!  This dish was heaven from the sea.  I've been eating fish and shellfish for the past 3 months and was running out of recipes.  This dish added a lot of spice to my pescetarian lifestyle.  With every bite my tastebuds bursted with flavor.   This baked curried fish was quite delectable!  You MUST try it.

With so many other great ways to prepare salmon, we won't be having this again.  No one in our family particularly cared for this.  I could probably think of better ways to give curry flavor to salmon.

Didn't care for this one. I did sub plain yogurt for sour cream as I do in all recipes. Kinda bland as is. I won't make it again.
