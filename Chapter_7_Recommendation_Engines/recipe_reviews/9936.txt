I made a double batch and at first it seemed too soft to roll out. I let it sit for about an hour and it was fine. I rolled some of them a little too thick the first time and they didn't puff up evenly. The rest were rolled about 1/4 inch thick before I rolled them with the springerle rolling pin and they came out great.

The person who left the previous review must not have had springerle before.  Springerle is a hard cookie that is very good for dunking; however they will soften up over time.  I find this to be a very good recipe.

This recipe is almost exactly the one I use that was handed down to me through my mother from my German grandmother and probably her mother.

Any recipe that uses anise oil will have a black licorice taste. A springerle is a subtle sweet biscuit, German in origin. It does tend to be drier than what most Americans are use to in a sweet. As a previous review suggested, placing it in a storage container will soften it.

Incomplete directions - The dog won't even eat them!  Look like biscuits.  Taste like cough syrup. Need to improve this- a lot!
