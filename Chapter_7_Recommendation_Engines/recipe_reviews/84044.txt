I made this with a few changes, used cream of wild mushrioom soup and beef consomme with only 1/4 cup of non fat sour cream. I also added lots of vegies with the mushrooms. It was delicious and a hit with the whole family!

For those concerned about calories this is my take. I used frozen low fat beef meatball, low fat sour cream, egg free medium noodles and low sodium beef broth, 2 tbs tomato sauce and garlic (to taste) I browned the meatballs, then added veggies, stirring them in the residue which helps the flavour.  I added the tomato sauce and garlic and proceeded as the recipe says.  With the added tomato sauce, recipe not as dry.

This recipe was really great!  I did have to add more broth for the noodles because they wouldnt soften.  I also added some parmesan cheese when serving.

Marmaduke I have no idea what it means but it turned out to be a very good stroganoff.  We loved it.  I used Sherry cooking wine rather then the Burgundy wine because that’s what I had home.  I used a little bit of beef bouillon in water to make more liquid to cook the noodles in.  Turned out very good and easy to prepare.

Very simple.  I used bow tie noodles instead of egg noodles.  Possibly these noodles required longer cooking, because I had to add extra broth and cook longer to get them done.  We loved It!!!  I will definetly make this again!

Good recipe.  Very homey tasting, comfort food.  Noodles didn't get quit cooked enough, I had to add some broth and extend the cooking time.  It was actually better as leftovers.  My husband gave it 5 stars.  Will make again.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it was sooo easy to make.  I didn't add the lemon juice because I forgot it at the store.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef.  I will be making this recipe again.

I'm a compulsive recipe changer, but this was a great base to work with.   I used probably 3-4 cups of fresh mushrooms. I didn't have any consomme so used a beef bouillion cube. I probably added about 2 cups of water, and about a cup of wine (I just added to taste). Didn't add salt and used white pepper. Used about a cup of sour cream. Used the recipes onion, garlic and the 3 tbsp of lemon juice. Didn't use butter, just fried the ground beef and once it was started added the onion and garlic. Also added about 1/2 tsp of marjoram and 1/4 tsp of dried cilantro. Cooked the noodles in the sauce and it turned out the right consistency. Didn't have parsley so didn't use it.

Two things made this almost inedible. 1. The lemon juice must go.  It completely ruined it. 2.  Why not just preook the noodles and add them later.  Not only was one can of beef consomme not sufficient even two cans did not provide enough liquid to cook the noodles.  I finally remembered an old trick I learned somewhere and added a larger can of chicken broth which finally cooked the noodles and "gentled" the taste of the beef broth enough to be able to eat some of it.  Without the lemon juice that might have made it actually edible.

Outstanding.  By far the best stroganoff ever. Followed the recipe exactly - except I used leftover rare prime rib in place of the ground beef.

We like this recipe best with Campbell's beef broth instead of the consomme. Difference is the consomme has a tomato-y backbone. This is a great recipe to serve a large family or a family of big eaters.

Made this for myself a couple of Sunday's ago. My bf went to a concert with one of his buddies, so I was cooking for one : ) My bf doesn't like stroganoff, so this was my only chance to make it (and I had a craving for it to boot). While I like this recipe (for ease of preparation - especially not having to boil noodles in a separate pot!), I thought it called for a bit too much sour cream. IMHO, an easy fix b/c I can just add to taste next time (and there WILL be a next time!). My only modifications were omitting mushrooms alltogether (I DESPISE them - I know, kinda defeats the purpose of "stroganoff") and skipping the fresh parsley garnish (just didn't feel like using it). I had no problems with my noodles being crunchy, but did need to cook them a bit longer than directed to soften them. Served with a side of green beans and a dinner roll. Thanks for sharing JAFWARE!

Very easy and tasty. I added some grill seasoning and worcheshire sauce. I subbed low fat yogurt for the sour cream to cut a little of the fat. We like the Simple Hamburger Stroganoff recipe here a little better for this type of dish.

I made this recipe, with a few changes.  I made the meat mixture into small meatballs and sauteed them.  Also, because of some reviewers comments, I made the egg noodles separate, so I had plenty of sauce.  I omitted the lemon juice because it just didn't sound right. It was a hit with my family and a quick weeknight meal.

Delicious....I used Cabernet Sauvignon instead of burgundy, used beef broth instead of beef consumme, added 2 heaping teaspoons of prepared horseradish, thickened it with a little flour, and both my husband and I loved it.  Husband did request that we have it over mashed potatoes next time.

I decided to make the noodles separately because I read the reviews and didn't want to chance it.  The sauce had a nice flavor.  Husband loved it and would have rated it a 5.  I thought it was ok, and would have given it a 3 or 4, so I settled on a 4.  Nothing really wrong with the recipe, but it didn't excite me.  I left out the lemon juice because it seemed odd.  I was thinking later that it would have been good with a different type of meat besides, ground beef... maybe a sliced meat.

This is a great recipe.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and added more liquid.  I added a half cup of beef broth and doubled the wine.  It turned out great.  This recipe is easy and tasty.

We just had this for dinner and it was great! I used egg noodles and they cooked down fine. The only thing I did different was not use the lemon juice. I didnt think it went with it. and I used a bit more broth and a splash or 2 more wine. 
It was a winner in my house, and the one pan cooking was great..

My family loved this recipe! Even my picky 4-year-old had seconds. The only thing I changed was to cook the noodles separately, minus a couple of minutes cooking time, then I added them to the mixture to finish cooking. I'll need to double the recipe next time!

This was just not for us.  I may try this again leaving out the lemon juice and adding a cup of chicken broth along with a bit of Greek seasoning.

Had this for dinner tonight and it was great!  Like most of the other reviewers, I omitted the lemon juice.  I also put in a few extra noodles.  I didn't have any problem with the noodles cooking through and  everything turned out perfectly.  It tasted just like my Mom's Stroganoff.  I'll definately do this one again!

A very tasty dish - after some modifications.  First, as many reviewers have said, the noodles didn't get fully cooked.  Some of them started to burn on the bottom of the pot, so I needed to add some water.  I recommend cooking the noodles about halfway in a separate pot of water, then adding them to the beef mixture.  Second, there were nowhere enough noodles for the amount of meat.  I added more noodles and it was great.

This was fantastic and so easy.  To the reveiwer who found it almost inedible it is obvious that they must have done something wrong.  The only thing I agreed with with that review was to leave out the lemon juice.  As far as he said about pre-cooking the noodles that is not necessary and would defeat the purpose of an easy one pot dinner.  This turned out great and we loved it!  A true keeper!

This was absolutely wonderful!  Based on the prior reviews, I added extra beef broth(didn't have consomme) to make sure the noodles cooked but I think I added too much because I had to doctor it up to make it a little thicker.  The taste was wonderful!  Next time I will add more noodles and mushrooms.  I also did not add the lemon juice because I didn't have any but when I make again I will omit because I liked it just the way it was!  Thanks so much for a great, easy recipe!!

This is a great recipe.  My husband and I both enjoyed this dish.  Since I work full time I am always looking for quick and easy meals.  This one fits the bill.  I did tweak a bit, using round steak strips for stir fry instead of ground beef, for more chew power, and added just a bit of freshly ground nutmeg and about 2 tsps of sweet Hungarian paprika. End result was yummy.

This recipe was GREAT. I substituted beef broth for the beef consomme, used slightly less ground beef, and about 1 1/2 cups of light sour cream. When I make it again, I'm going to use more mushrooms, and more broth (mine seemed to come out a little dry, which is why I used more sour cream). All in all, a really great recipe--especially if you need more ground beef recipes--like me!

This was quick and easy to whip up with ingredients on hand. My husband liked a=it and the kids ate it without complaining. I am sorry but I didn't like it, I think it may have been because I used cooking sherry because that's what I had, so I'm still giving 5 stars because no one else complained. I might try it again with the burgundy and see if it makes a difference for me. Thanks for a quick meal!

Simple, quick and tasty - what more could you ask for? I didn't have/use the wine, I used 2 cups of beef broth instead of the consommé, and I put Ina few shakes of Worschestershire.

This is freaking fantastic!  Used my favorite red (cab sav), added 1/2 red bell pepper and a handful of green beans for color.  Tried to make it more figure friendly by using 93% lean ground beef, 1tbsp light margarine and 1 tbsp evoo in place of butter, 3/4 cup fat free sour cream, and whole wheat noodles.  Used 2 cans fat free low sodium beef broth.  
Thanks for a great dish!

Have to agree with other reviewers.  There was just not enough liquid.  I ended up having to change the recipe to get enough liquid.  Probably would not make again.  Thanks

I can't give this recipe a great rating because it didn't WORK.  There was not enough liquid to cook the noodles in, and when I added the sour cream, the whole dish was pretty much sour cream and noodles because all of the original liquid was gone.

This is a wonderful recipe that everyone always loves.I've made it numerous times now, and yes, the amount of liquid has varied.  But it's not the recipe's fault.  The slight differences in the amounts of the ingredients, the type of pasta, the temperature you cook it at, and even the number of times you lift the lid "to check" will affect the outcome.  So use your judgement and have a little extra broth on hand.  Don't pass this one up, it's great!

We weren't really impressed by this at all.  Even after adding extra seasonings, it was sort of bland and the lemon gave it an odd flavor. It also needs more liquid than called for - I added extra wine and beef broth.  I don't think I will make this again, sorry!

I have never made beef stroganoff and may never have eaten either, so am not sure what it should be like.  But we really liked this dish; it is great comfort food.  I love what the wine & the consomme did to good old hamburger adding a lovely depth of flavor.  I did parboil the noodles and do think they would have been underdone had I not done that; it didn't look like there would be enough noodles either, but it was just the right amount.  My crimini mushrooms had gone bad, so I ended up having to use canned mushrooms which I added after the onion/garlic had sauteed; it worked.  I omitted the lemon juice; didn't seem to fit with the other flavors. Left out the salt as there is salt in the consomme.  Also took the advice of another reviewer and tossed in 2T of creamy horseradish; I think that really made the dish for us.  Thank you, Jafware!

Husband made this last night and loved it - put double the garlic, double the mushrooms and used a lean beef steak sliced thinly.  He cut the butter in  half and used a little olive oil to brown the mushrooms, garlic and onions and stirred in light sour cream at the end. He was in heaven!

Fit for a dog....Marmaduke.    Did not like this at all because of the way the recipe is written and also did not like the taste.   Lemon juice does not belong in this dish.   Cook your noodles separately and forget the way this recipe is written.

This recipe was great. I used cabernet instead of burgundy and left out the lemon juice. I also used bow tie pasta but only because I could not find egg noodles at the local grocery store. Finished off the leftovers for lunch the next day....yum

This was an excellent recipe. The only changes I made was to add a can of beef broth for the noodles and I left out the salt. It would have been way too salty (and I do like salt) if salt was added. I wrote the previous rating after we had it, but my husband just announced that he really didn't like it much. So I am lowering my rating to 4 stars.

Made this last night. Did not have any wine but used balsamic vinegar split w/ water. It took a little longer for the noodles to cook then stated but I did use a little more noodle then alloted. Very good though. Even as left over for lunch it was good.

This was a great stroganoff (better than my mom's egg noodles and cream of mushroom soup, for sure!).  I ended up doubling the recipe, so I used 1 cup of wine, but I think next time I would only use a 1/2 cup anyway.

Did the receipe almost exactly.  My grandson does not like mushrooms, so they were not used, but we all loved it.  I am making it for adult company next week with the mushorrms.  We did add a bit more water.  It is great!

Really very tasty. Easy to put together. Great to not have to pre-cook the noodles. I loved it. Will definitely make it again!
