I've long suspected the key to the awesome salsa at my favorite authentic Mexican restaurants was canned tomatoes, so I was excited to try this.  I made it twice: the first time, I followed it exactly.  The thing about salsa is that it's very subjective and easy to tweak, so I gave this five stars, even though I found it a little too soupy, a little too hot and it was missing something... which I realized was onions and garlic.  So I tried it again: draining the tomatoes, adding two tablespoons of diced onions, a 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and taking it down to one jalapeno.  Success!  This is a great recipe to tweak for your own tastes.  Love it!

So simple yet so delicious! It has a nice amount of heat, without popping your eyes out.  The only tweak I made was to add a bit of salt since I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I used diced tomatoes, so I only had to blend for about 8-10 seconds.   I made some baked tortilla chips with whole wheat tortillas. So good! I gave hubby a taste and all he could say was WOW! This is a keeper! It's a nice recipe to have on hand when unexpected guests stop by.

This is fabulous salsa. I do not care for pepper black or white and I do not like hot foods, ironically I loved this. I was so tempting to reduce spices or use some fresh garlic. Don't change the spices. I used 1.5 cups of fresh garden tomatoes peeled and chopped and then added a can of petite diced tomatoes to make the 28 oz size. For the jalepenos I used about a 1/2 can drained 4oz size of diced jalepenos. They are already prepared. The salsa was kind of like the restaurant salsa, they serve with chips, if it was completely fresh. I have made a lot of salsas and this one is really good. I put it in my Vitamix on about speed 7 or 8 for 7 seconds. Thanks, Roberto.

I make this salsa often. It definitely reminds me of restaurant salsa and I love it! I can't always seem to get a  consistent spiciness. Sometimes I've used 3 jalapeños and it's overwhelming then I would try 2 and it didn't have enough kick. I think it may just depend on the size and quality of the jalapeños you get. Otherwise I still love the ease and taste of this recipe and if I'm not so lazy I can get the spice just right by adding 2 jalapeños and parts of the 3rd until it's just right.

I really enjoy this salsa but I sometimes add a bit of cayenne pepper and other things for a little spice. I added some chipotle powder for a little heat, but the flavor and texture is great. Thanks for sharing such a simple, but effective recipe.

I can't believe more people haven't tried this. It is fantastic! I used fresh garlic and salt insted of garlic salt, and also added some chopped onion. Will surely be making this again!!

This was amazing!  I thought I had white pepper and when I realized I didn't, figured I'd just double-up the black.  Well, I put in 1 tsp instead of 1/2 tsp...and that little mistake turned out great!  Definitely easy and will be a go-to salsa for our family now!

This is a really good recipe. By mistake, I bought a can of high quality (Italian name) seasoned diced tomatoes but it made this salsa even more delicious!!

Great base recipe! I halved the recipe, but used double the cilantro (2T total), and based on another review I added the juice from the can a little at a time so that the salsa wouldn’t be too watery and only used 2T of it. I had to tinker with this a lot based on what I had on hand, and it still turned out very well. I gave the recipe 4 stars because I think there would have been too much liquid for my taste, and I think salsa needs diced onion so I added that as well. Plus I omitted the white pepper and jalapeños since I didn’t have them and needed this to be pretty mild for some sensitive taste buds in my family. I did shake in a bit of cayenne pepper to give it a touch of heat.

This recipe is awesome.  I do drain the tomatoes as I like a thicker salsa.    I have used canned tomatoes and a combination of canned and my frozen garden tomatoes.    Both work equally well.

Much like my tried & true recipe, but I always put in a tablespoon of salt free chicken bullion. Make sure the canned tomatoes are bonafied whole peeled San Mariano tomatoes — twice as expensive/twice as good. Substitute Serrano pepper for some of the Jalapeños for higher spice level.

Loved it!  Only thing I did was substituted more black pepper for white pepper.  Added few sprinkles of Savory Spice Company's Charcoal seasoning and it was outstanding!  Great to have a canned tomato salsa option!  Luv'd it Ü

Just OK.  Needs a bit of zing to it which can be achieved by adding lime juice.  Also, more cumin is needed, salt and pepper

My new signature salsa! All recipes are suggestions, I grilled 2 jalapeños and used 1/2 the suggested canned tomato and BAM the family was nuts over it.

I was looking for something quick, simple and delicious and this is it! It's very similar to one from a chain restaurant we go to. I would never have guessed that canned tomatoes would make such a tasty salsa.

WOW!  I finally found a salsa recipe that tastes like going to the restaurant!   I did not use canned tomatoes, I boiled fresh tomatoes with the jalapeño and peeled them.   I added maybe a teaspoon of finely chopped onion and fresh grated garlic, but other than that I followed this recipe and it is REALLY REALLY GOOD!  Thanks for sharing this recipe ??
