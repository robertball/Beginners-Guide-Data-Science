One of our favorite (if not our favorite) Chef John recipes! No changes necessary, you have to taste this one to believe.

Only comment is that the amount of gravy this made was way too much for the 10 sausage patties I ended up with, but my husband was eating the gravy with a spoon, so this wasn't really a problem.
