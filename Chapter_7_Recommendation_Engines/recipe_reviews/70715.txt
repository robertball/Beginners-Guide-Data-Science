I was really dissapointed with this recipe.  All it tasted like was soy sauce and way too salty.  Waste of my fish :-(

After reading reviews where people said it was too salty, I added a little honey so try and counter that. At the end of the day it was just fish, nothing special about it.

We LOVED this marinade! We cut the soy sauce in 1/2 after reading the other reviews and it was perfect with talapia!

Easy and delicious! I used this marinade on orange roughy and I was really impressed with the finished result. The fish was great and the marinade was quite easy to prepare. I liked this marinade because it was light and not too heavy and did not overpower the flavor of the fish. I will definitely make this again.

I used Jack Daniel's for the whiskey and it gave it a bit of a sweet flavor. Very good. Next time I'll try the low sodium soy sauce, though, because it was very salty.

After reading some of the other reviews, I used a little less than 1/4 cup of soy.  I was afraid of using to little, but apparently that was unfounded.  I couldn't taste much other than the salt.  I wanted to like this recipe.  Anyway, I made a sauce to go on top.  I combined some bourbon with honey and the tiniest bit of soy for color, then reduced it down to a thin sauce.  I found it balanced the saltiness of the fish well.  I didn't measure it though. Next time I may tweak the recipe by further reducing the soy and adding a little bit of honey.

I would not waste bourbon on Tilapia. If it was up to me, just cook Tilapia in Italian Dressing, it's cheaper, less sodium and a cheaper solution to "discard the marinade".

Enjoyed this very much. Based on other reviewers I decided to add a little brown sugar for sweetness and it was perfect.

Very good except for those guests that have a history of alcoholism. I know much of the bourbon burns off while 
cooking. but there are other great fish marinades too. This recipe takes away the gamely fish flavor when blood line not cut out and I used with tilapia then a tomato -cucumber salsa
after marinating fish awhile ( an hour) then rinsing  off the marinade before cooking fish a few minutes each side. Using reduced (low) sodium soy sauce made it not too salty.

I have made this twice now - with mahi mahi and swai. We love this marinade! Both time, we used the grilled fish in fish tacos. Delicious!

I did not like it at all. I even used low sodium soy sauce. Also, bourbon really don't go well with fish, its better with beef.

Wish I had looked at reviews and thought about this before I pretty much ruined the fish and good Kentucky bourbon.  WAY TOO MUCH soy, so salty it gave me a headache.  Might be good with 1/10 as much soy.

I was worried about the saltiness so I added a splash of water. I grilled and seasoned with fiest lime mrs.dash and it was AMAZING!  Also I used amberjack for the fish:)
