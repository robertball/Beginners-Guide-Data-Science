I wasn't sure about this when looking at the ingredients but was pleasantly surprised when the flavor exploded in my mouth!  Not much on olives but they are yummy after soaking up the combination of flavors!  A bit too greasy for my taste (probably just need to back off on the pepperoni a little) but this is going to be great left-overs with mashed potatoes tomorrow night!

This was an easy way to have a really nice family sit-down dinner... even my picky 15-year old son raved about this (he did pick out the olives, but my wife and I loved it just the way it was!) The ONLY thing I'll change the next time is to have the ingeredients because this was waay too much for the three of us (even considering the left overs!)

Give this a try I think you'll be glad that you did!

I didn't have olives, I wish I did because that would have been outstanding!  I chopped up carrots, mushrooms, and zucchini and added it to the sauce just to hide some veggies for my kids.  Served it over rotoni noodles.

We loved it!  We wanted pot roast, but a different type of pot roast.  This was great!  We added green pimento stuffed olives as well and they added alot of flavor.  Served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Delicious!  It's a keeper!

We really enjoyed this roast! I chose a lean chuck roast and followed the recipe exactly only the pepperoni I could only find in a three ounce package which worked out great. I served it over baked potatoes like a loaded baked potato with steamed corn on the side. The juices from the roast made the potato delicious! Highly recommend this recipe as a nice change to your usual pot roast recipe. Also great recipe for chicken. I use frozen "grilled and ready" breasts and we love the sauce mixed with fluffy white rice as a side dish. Very versatile recipe.

I thought this was a great recipe.  Made exactly as stated except my roast was only 3.25lbs (the biggest the grocery store had) I really don't think the pepperoni added much to the dish.  I didn't have the "greasy" issue another reviewer had with the pepperoni.  It was absolutely foolproof and there no leftovers - so no pictures :(  So sorry.

This was yummy! My 8 year old had 3rds of the roast. He liked that it tasted like pizza. My husband who does not like to try new things loved it.  I used turkey pepperoni to cut down on grease. Also I would use less liquid since it doesn't boil down in a crock pot. Will make this a lot this winter.

My family flipped over this recipe.  I also used turkey pepperoni to reduce the fat and I thought that worked great.  I also trimmed my chuch roast.  I ended up adding carrots at the end and used beef broth.
I was surprised at the sophistication of this and had to have a good laugh at the fact that on the Top Chef final, Mike made a pepperoni sauce!

Made this yesterday! IT WAS HORRIBLE... I made it exactly how it's written, and it had a weird taste. It was also bland at the same time. Everyone ate it stating it wasn't bad, but no one wants it again. I'd rather make regular pot roast than this!

Great taste!  But as I feared as I ate from the slow cooker - too much fat...  You have pepperoni and a fat-laden cut of beef...  But there is a solution:

Put the pot in the fridge after cooking and before eating...  Give it a few hours, and voila!  The grease has congealed at the top of the stew...  Using a flat spoon, work out the grease layer (mine was about an 1/8 of an inch) - and if you want to save any ingredient that was attached: use a pan to melt the grease and a strainer spoon to rescue the pieces...

It still tastes good, and your heart will thank you!

My family really enjoyed this meal. We put it over mashed potatoes and with the left overs I plan on removing most of the juice and saut√©ing it with bowtie noodles. I only used a 3# roast and it still made plenty for our family of 4, TWICE! I used diced tomatoes(what I had in the pantry). I also used one bag of the mini pepperonis instead of full size, they are more manageable for little ones and less greasy.

Wow this was so easy, and taste fantastic.  I was a little leery, roast and pepperoni? It turned out great. I tried to stay as close to the recipe as possible, the only difference is I had to adjust quantities because the roast was smaller than I thought. The broth was a little spicier than I thought, so be careful on the pepper. This will be a staple going forward.

I will make it again. Very easy and not just your basic pot roast.  Will cut back on onions somewhat

I am not a huge slow cooked beef fan because I find it dry.  I decided to give this a shot and it is absolutely delicious.  It is tender, juicy and flavorful.  My family loves it and our dinner guests raved out it and begged for the recipe.  Two thumbs up from me.

This was a wonderful alternative! I did make some changes as follows:

1) Switched green olives for the black;
2) Omitted the pepperoni;
3) Added lots of vegetables, including carrots, onion, celery, daikon radish, turnip, and parsnips. 
4) Made it more Mediterranean by adding balsamic vinegar, a bit of a very high quality olive oil, capers, and lime juice. 

It was terrific, and the next night I turned the leftovers into a soup (first removed the olive pits), which also cooked all day in the slow cooker.

Didn't use the total amount of pepperoni listed (don't get it on pizzas) and used a London Broil I had on hand. Will try a chuck next time. Also added some sliced green olives with the canned black ones. This made an excellent, different pot roast that was easy to put together. The ingredients meld nicely for a good flavor. Served with mashed potatoes.
