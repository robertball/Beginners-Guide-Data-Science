This is a really good pie, but I think it would have been better if some of the cool whip in the filling was substituted with more pumpkin to give the pie more flavor.

I used skim milk, fat free Cool Whip, fat free pudding mixes and a reduced fat graham cracker crust to help keep the total fat and calories down and it was delicious! I am planning on bringing this to Thanksgiving dinner to offer a desert option for those watching their diet!

I don't use the pecans in this recipe, it interferes with the creamy texture. I've tried with and without and the without had everyone complimenting this recipe

This is soo good and soo easy.  I have used both pumpkin pudding and chocolate pudding.  I think there are several flavors of pudding that would be good such as butterscotch, vanilla... mmm good!!  I have made this many times.  I prefer the shortbread crust with chocolate pudding, yet graham crust works good too.

Tasty, but my pie turned out to be the consistency of a thick pudding.  Is that how it is suppose to be?  Because the picture looks more like a traditional pumpkin pie and mine .... well its a big pile of mush.  Tasty mush though :-)  I really like the caramel on the crust.

It is easy to make but the pumpkin part of the pie isn't very sweet.  No one even took a piece at Christmas -- in all fairness, this pie was competing against a Blackberry sourcream pie as well as cherry cheesecake....

Very simple and yummy.  I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin pie, but this was awesome!  I made it w/ SF caramel syrup, FF/SF pudding mix and skim milk (sorry, I'm a dietitian, haha)

I tasted this at a demonstration booth in Publix.  Delicious!  I made two pies when I got home.  In one version I used some Pumpkin Spice pudding boxes leftover from last year (I omitted the spices with this one.)  The flavored pudding really made the pumpkin stand out.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! My cousin and aunt made this pie for Thanksgiving and I couldnt get enough of it. The texture is just perfect, and the caramel and chocolate gave it just the perfect "turtle" taste. I would definetely recommend this pie to anyone!

I made this for THanksgiving. It was easy, and turned out to be a lighter alternative to traditional pumpkin pie. I even used Sugar Free caramel and Sugar Free Vanilla pudding, with Skim milk and lite Cool Whip  for my diabetic Mother in law, and she loved it! I only had one large Vanilla pudding (6 servings), though the recipe calls for 8 pudding servings.  I cut the milk to 3/4 cup and it turned out just fine.

This was definitely a great looking pie and was the first to go at Thanksgiving but I personally thought that the vanilla pudding made it a little too dense. Next time I will only use one package of pudding.

Wonderful!  Followed the recipe exactly, except I drizzled the caramel the night before I served it without thinking it wouldn't look pretty the next day.  It had all run together but still tasted great!!

This is a wonderfully lite dessert after a large Thanksgiving meal.  It has the right flavors & right sweetness.  I do not use store-bought graham cracker crust as it has no flavor, but made my own.  Just made this for Thanksgiving 2008 for the 1st time & thought is was perfect. Much better than a pumpkin cheesecake or pumpkin roll & a nice change from traditional pumpkin pie.

my step mom made this for Thanksgiving
instead of graham crust she used Pillsbury crust-fantastic-then you can skip the caramel & pecans in the crust

We all loved this pie! I did do something a tad different. I did use more pumpkin & bit less cool whip & used the spices from Libby's original pumpkin pie recipe. My pie looks a bit soft in photo, but it was the last piece & it sat out for a bit before I could grab a photo!

The pie tastes okay but nothing too spectacular.  The ice cream topping base remains soft & runny and would have been much better if you substituted with melted caramels instead.  I'm glad that I made a pie to test with my family before Thanksgiving guests arrived.

Very yummy & super easy!  Did increase the pumpkin and may omit the nutmeg next time (since I'm not a big fan).
