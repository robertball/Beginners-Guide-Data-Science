My family enjoyed this. Since expectation is key here I didn't expect the crust to resemble a traditional yeast crust so I didn't have a problem with it. It is quick easy forgiving and has all the pizza flavors my family enjoys. I chose to use sausage onion peppers and Parmesan. I eyed the amount of sauce since everyone I know who makes pizza doesn't use a measured amount you just eye it. It is a great quick evening meal. thank you!

After reading reviews (and considering ingredients I had on hand) I decided to switch it up a bit. I used a 2qt dish reduced bisquick to 1 2/3c used the same 1c of milk and added 1/4 Parmesan cheese and 2T of italian seasoning to the crust mix. I think the seasoning makes a big difference in the crust! The extra milk keeps it from being too biscuit-like...it's definitely more like a thick crust pizza. Add sauce and toppings of your choice (I used cubed pepperoni and fresh mushrooms) with a ton of cheese and mmmmm that was good! I did not put extra dough on top - used it all on the bottom. My family loved it! My changes will serve 3-4 people.

My family liked this but like my husband said it needed more ingredients like sausage olives more cheese and more sauce.

The recipe was too bready. The biscuits did not really taste like pizza crust. It was easy but not very flavorful.

I've made Bisquick bakes before so I expected the breadiness. In order to add some balance and vegetables I added a frozen block of chopped spinach (water squeezed out first) to the dough as well as a liberal sprinkling of garlic powder. It not only added some much-needed vegetable it added a lot of flavor too (while still making it acceptable to my kids).

not bad for a replacement for when you have that craving for pizza. Made per recipe came out really tasty. Will try using more additions to dough.

There was away too much dough. If I made again would use about 1/3 of the Bisquick.

I liked it. As someone else commented it s about expectations. This isn t a pizza. It s a biscuit pizza bake. That being said I also listened to other commenters and seasoned the dough. I also added bacon bits as one of the toppings replaced bisquick with carbquik for lower carbs and milk with cream to also lower the carbs. Mini pepperoni work well with this recipe so they get all the way into all the books and crannies. With the biscuit like flavor I d say this could make a good breakfast pizza as well.

Agreed with some other reviewers this too much bread. Taste of the other ingredients was fine but we didn't really care for all that biscuit texture

Very easy to make simple ingredients but the Bisquick made it dry and flakey. last week we made with regular pancake mix and it was much better.

This is really good really easy and really quick. Unfortunately its really bready (sp?) too. I followed the recipe regarding the Bisquick and used sausage mushrooms and pepperoni and extra sauce. It turned out great but as others have said I will cut down the Bisquick by at least a third next time. Other than that my husband really liked it and I will definitely make it again.
