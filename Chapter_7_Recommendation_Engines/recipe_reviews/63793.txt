This is the best brownie recipe in the world!  (At least that's what I think, my husband doesn't agree...)  I grew up on this recipe.  I found that the trick to making these turn out scrumptious is to not over bake them. They are very chocolaty, chewy, and moist.  They are good even with out the chocolate chips.

This is a very good recipe! Needs motifications however, but once that is done this turns out to be one of the best brownie recipes I have made. I use Sharffen Berger sweetened cocoa powder. That makes a huge difference in the taste and quality. This recipe as is makes extremely thin brownies so if you like some body to your brownies double all ingredients except the cocoa powder, flour, and butter. With the cocoa I add just one extra 1/3 cup, flour I use 2 1/3 cups, and butter I use one stick. These make for very excellent brownies! Not to cakey and not too chewy. My hubby is addicted to them as I am as well. They look nothing like the picture Hershey provides however. Even making them the exact way the recipe states does nto make them even resemble what's in the picture. I have now made these with cinnamon, peanut butter and chocolate chips, and white chocolate and chocolate chips. Can't go wrong it seems!
Oh! And there's no need to add only a portion of the melted butter in the first steps. You can add all the butter at once with the cocoa powder, baking soda, vanilla etc... Just one sauce pan to heat the butter, a mixing spoon. and a large bowl is all you need to make these.

Brownies were a little "cakelike", plain, bland...
I used margarine, so maybe with butter they would be better...??? 
Just definitely not gooey chocolaty and yummy like I expect brownies to be.

I just made these and can hardly stay away from them (they're for a work potluck) They are so moist and smell delicious! As stated earlier, you do not want to over cook them. I didn't have dark choc. chips so I used semi sweet and they worked just as well.  You wont believe the way your home smells as these bake.  So yummy! THANKS!

These are very fudgy delicious brownies.  The dark chocolate chips are a definite must--I don't think they would have enough chocolate flavor otherwise.  I frosted them with Chocolate Icing III from this site which elevated them into the chocolate heaven realm!  BIG hit with my 4 little brownieholics!!

This is a great recipe! The brownies were moist and tasty. I had been using a recipe that I grew up with but couldn't find it. Now I don't need it. This is now going to be my brownie recipe!

Absolutely the best brownies I ever made.  They were a HUGE hit with a dark chocolate glaze drizzled over them.

Chewy and yummy!  I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of nuts - but I think I'll add the full cup of chocolate chips next time and a 1/2 cup of walnuts.

These brownies turned out great!  I followed the recipie exactly, and this was my first time making brownies.  A few people that tried them said they were pretty rich, but I loved that :).  The only thing I did different, was I sprinkled more chocolate chips on top before putting the pan in the oven to bake.  A girl can never have too much chocolate!

Chewy, chocolatey, yummy! These are the best. I cooked them in a slightly smaller pan (about 10" x 7"), but didn't increase the cooking time. This worked well because they came out moist and chewy. I served them to our guests with some icecream and everyone had seconds.

These are the best brownies I have ever had!! (Though I changed the dark choc. to milk choc. chips as a personal preference) Not too cakey, not too fudgy, and all the chocolate you could ever want. YUM!!
