I am the one who submitted this recipe. I just wanted to say how incredibly easy this recipe is and it is foolproof. I have been making these for over twenty five years and they are always a big hit. They are relatively small made the way the recipe is written. If you would like you can make them larger just by dividing the dough circles by four or six. They are always well received and they freeze very easily. Both after you bake them or before. For before, just place them on a cookie sheet in the freezer. When frozen keep them in a plastic bag in the freezer and thaw them when ready to bake. Enjoy!!

These are delicious!  I made 1/4 a batch to see how they would work, and now I know they DO!  I went a little short on the parmesan, but next time I won't.  I'll also mix the butter and cottage cheese better so they are smoother.  These would be good with some herbs added---I'm thinking dill or thyme would pair well.  Here's what I did about the stickiness of the dough.  I put my dough ball on parchment paper and flattened it out quite a bit for the refrigeration.  Then I rolled it out, and they were not rolling up the way they should, so I just put the thin circle back in the fridge for about fifteen more minutes.  That's all it took!  I baked them 19 minutes before they looked like my photo.  Thanks for the recipe!  EDIT:  I had trouble reheating these.  I need to try them again!  Just a warning!  :)

I was skeptical about this recipe since it has no yeast or leavening-- the little rolls are the same size taking them out of the oven as they are when you put them in the oven.  Sorry, I just did not like these; I adore parmasan cheese so went ahead and tried them despite my reservations, and while the flavor was good, the overabundance of oil from the butter and cheese made them way to greasy for me.  I know I cooked them long enough--any longer and the bottoms would have been burned even with parchment paper, and still found them gummy...not like the crescent I was expecting...

Delicious and surprisingly easy.  These are like buttery, rich, savory little rolls - not really "bread-y".   I used the chive-cottage cheese I had on hand and grated Pecorino Romano since that's what I had.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making theses since they first appeared in Marlene Sorosky's Cookery for Entertaining in  the late 70's. I do sometimes use cottage cheese with chives and always use more parmesan. She recommended separating the dough into 6 balls for appetizers which is the only way I have ever made them - it remains my husband's favorite appetizer.

I've never made crescent rolls this way and don't believe I've ever had a better recipe. I found that these still cooked great when you add other things like cheeses or apple butter or marmalade or even crab stuffing. Thank you ma'am for enhancing my Southern cooking!

I'm not sure what I was expecting. But mine turned out like little blobs of dough, not resembling a crescent roll at all. The dough was very sticky and hard to roll out.  Then while baking, they flattened out and lost what little shape they had. The taste was ok but felt more like a puff pastry.
