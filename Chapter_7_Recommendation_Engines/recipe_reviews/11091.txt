All of the one star/negative reviews are obviously from people who are not willing to invest the necessary time to make this recipe.  To say "it never did reach  hard ball stage" is a ridiculous statement.  As with any taffy-type candy, it takes a while, but of course it will eventually reach that stage.  I made the popcorn balls this afternoon and they turned out great.  The only thing I may do differently next time is to take the candy to crack stage so it is a bit more brittle  (personal preference).  Thanks for this good old fashioned recipe, Lynne.

I loved this recipe, it tasted just like my grandmother's popcorn balls. I think those who tried this recipe and did not wait long enough for the sugar mixture to turn to hardball stage, just did not wait long enough. It did take quite some time to get to that point over a medium/low fire but it did reach the hardball stage. The end result was WONDERFUL and the mixture did not "sugar" after it had set for a few hours...they were perfect and tasted wonderful, just like Grandma's.
Thank you Lynne for posting this recipe.

I did this recipe for my children and never made popcorn balls before. I added yellow food coloring to the candy mix and candy corn to the popcorn before the candy mix was added and shaped them like corn on the cob for Thanksgiving. I love the recipe thanks so much. Angie

The trick to getting this recipe is a thermometer! They came out ok, but a little chewier than I like. 
For those having trouble with the syrup, DON'T cook over medium heat! It will take too long and you won't have a workable syrup. Mix, enough to combine, then let it cook over high heat (and yes, it's still going to take about 10-15 min.). Watch it carefully! (mine jumped from 220* to 250* in about 10 seconds)Good luck!

These were a disaster for me too.   )o:  Seemed like I had to cook and stir the syrup mixture forever and then it "sugared" after just a few hours. My girlfriend said, she loved ME but these were the worst popcorn balls she'd ever had! Ugh! Going to try a batch that calls for butter.....

Couldn't get it to the hard ball stage.  The mixture is WAY to watery.  Must have gotten mixed up.  Looking for another recipe.

I loved this recipe it was simple enough for me and my children to make it together!  We used a candy thermometer to make sure the syrup was the right temperature.. at the end I lightly salted the popcorn balls to give it a "kettle corn" taste.

This recipe did not turn out for me at all.  I wonder if the amount of water and corn syrup did not accidentally get rearranged.  Mixture was too "soupy" and never got to "hard ball" stage when cooking over medium heat.

These are just like the ones my mom made for my class when I was in the 4th grade!  that was quite a while ago.  I remember it was a special treat and they were for Halloween.  Thanks for the memory.

Great recipe. Reminded me of my Dads popcorn balls. Those of you who had trouble with the recipe didn't let the mixture boil long enough. So what if it takes a few extra minutes. It is well worth it!

Tastes just like the old days.  Next time I'll use food coloring to make them more festive and so I can easily tell which popcorn isn't coated.

Excellent popcorn ball recipe.  I love this recipe because its a "walk away and do other things recipes"  don't stand and watch the pot, check back and stir from time to time.  They taste so good, the easiest recipe ever!!

Cooked this mixture 35 min over med heat as recipe called & never came to "hard ball stage".  Popcorn balls never formed correctly.  Need a candy thermometer for this recipe.

1 1/2 cups water?  Typo ?  Waaay to much water. Mixture would not thicken. I ended up adding a bunch more sugar and more corn syrup. Another helpful hint don't POUR the HOT liquid on the popcorn, drizzle it.

My step-dad first taught me how to make these and ever since then we've made them for christmas.  We put different color dies to make them festive.  They are great fun for kids because you can really get your hands into them.

These were exactly the recipe I was looking for to make the same popcorn balls as I had as a kid. The taste of these brought back a summer watching Superman while eating colored versions of these popcorn balls. Tip: If first time making the hard candy, be patient. The water you add from the recipe basically boils off and gives you the hard candy syrup at the end. Took me about 20 minutes of boiling to finally reach the hard ball stage.

I cut the water in half , used sorghum instead of molassas and added a can of Spanish peanuts. The trick is to cook the syrup a little longer than soft ball but not quite hard crack. It takes away the stickyness. Flavor was lovely and everyone called for more. It helps to take out just the popcorn you can ball up quickly and put the rest in a warm oven. You may need to reform the balls if you make them when the popcorn is too hot, but that's no big deal. Just squeeze them together again.

This recipe was pretty easy, given that you're making popcorn balls. It took about 45 minutes to get to 250°F. I rolled mine into 2.5" balls and made about 30. Very tasty!!

I am surprised by the 1 star ratings.  Like any candy or treat dishes it takes time and patience and a bit of strong arm stirring.  Actually considering some dishes I make, this is relatively easy.  That being said, they remind me of growing up.  We would color them with a drop or two of food coloring for a holiday season.  A huge hit!  I love popcorn balls... one of my favorite treats.

loved this! the light corn syrup was a nice light flavor. i used dark corn syrup once and it tastes EXACTLY like cracker jacks. both recipes cooked to the soft crack stage?, no thermometer, i just listened for it to crackle in the ice water. not sticky, set up nicely, no problems at all with either one.

This recipe tasted really good. I used a bag of Orville's Naturals Simply Salted popcorn. I popped it in the microwave and heated the sugar,corn syrup,vanilla and vinegar in a sauce pan. I waited until the mixture got hard like candy and poured it over the popcorn. But then all the popcorn shriveled up. I tried to make them into balls but it all fell apart. Was I supposed to let the liquid cool first?

Good flavor, but VERY chewy. Almost too chewy to eat. Maybe I didn't let the syrup mixture go long enough, but the tooth pulling combined with pots that are going to be challenging to clean makes this a recipe I won't be making again. Just not worth the effort and elbow grease.

Cook On High And Keep  Stiring It Off And On It Seems.Like It Takes About 30Min On high But It Will Thicken Up Some And Keep Alittle Water Near You And Add A Drop Every Once In Awhile AnD  If You Hear It Crackle Then You Know it IS At The Hard Ball stage And Ready to pour. This Is A Great receipe

I made 2 batches of these this afternoon. They turned out wonderful. It does take patience to wait for the sugar to come to temp. Approx 1 hr cooking time. I made these at different temps. First at 280deg and the second 270deg. Needing a candy thermometer, I liked 270 better it was a little more chewy like I remember. I did not add the vinegar either time. I am taking the same recipe to make some hard candy also,minus the popcorn this time.

This is identical to the recipe I have from my husband's grandmother.  It does take "forever" to get to hardball stage, (it stayed at the same temperature for me for 15 minutes or so before it finally started to climb) but they are really good.  It is hard to get them into balls without burning your hands, yet fast enough that they don't cool too much.  They are chewy not crunchy, but I would guess if you want them crunchier, then cook the candy longer, like to soft crack or hard crack (280* to 305*).  Yummy treats, but an investment of time and effort!

Easy enough and fun!  Do be careful when creating the balls.  Some of the syrup is cool enough to handle and then a hot spot finds the palm or fingers resulting in blisters.   I made 23 balls with this recipe and will be making more this evening.  I add color and some holiday sprinkles as well.

I have never made popcorn balls before, except for watching my Mom make them when I was little. I thought it wasn't working, then I started reading comments, and slowed down, and had some patience. I never heated the mixure on medium. I had it on medium high. It took about 20 minutes to be just right. The thermometer stayed at 200f for the longest, then it started to inch its way up. When it got to be 225f it climbed to 250 in seconds. Yes it was hot...I don't suggest waiting to long to ball the popcorn though, because it will candy, and be to hard. Now, the only disapointment that I had, was trying to clean the pot and bowl!!! Nobody said it was going to be easy! I did forget to add the vinegar?? OOOPS, but it still turned out ok!

I made this for my daughter's birthday party. We had a fall carnival theme. You do need to be patient to get to the hardball stage. I haven't made these since I was a little girl with my grandmother. She would be proud of me! They turned out perfect and everyone loved them. Be careful bc it's hot! I used a stick of butter to coat my hands each time I made a new ball to keep it from sticking to me too.

I did not care for this recipe. No matter how long I cooked the mixture, it never got firm.  I cooked it on high until eternity and it still never got firm. I only tried this because I lost my other popcorn ball recipe. I should have read the bad reviews before attempting to make this.

I don't know what happened with this recipe but in pouring the liquid over the popcorn, the popcorn deflated before my eyes...shriveled into tiny hard kernals.

I liked that there was no butter in this recipe.  It tasted good but the sugar did crystallize.  I took some to my son's preschool class for his birthday and they were a hit with the kids.

Turned out great. I used a candy thermometer. I was surprised how long it took to get to the correct temp. I almost gave up thinking I did something wrong. Grandkids loved them.

This is the recipe that my mom and grandma made. My dad used to beg mom to make these. As kids we’d help with buttered hands and one of us (4) always got a blister from the hot syrup. When we’d trick or treat, dad always had first dibs on popcorn balls. I have many sweet memories all around these sweet treats.

My mother used the same recipe 40 years ago for us kids when we had parties at school. The kids would ALWAYS ask us if our mom was going to make popcorn balls. She passed the recipe down to me and I made them for years for my kids, now I gladly make them for my grandchildren. The recipe has not changed at all! I just make them different colors. We NEVER get tired of them!!

Didn't seem to be quite enough sugar syrup for that much popcorn, but it made the amount of balls needed with lots of loose, sweet popcorn left over!
