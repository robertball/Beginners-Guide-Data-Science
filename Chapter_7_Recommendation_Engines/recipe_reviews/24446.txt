I usually make brownies with cocoa, but decided i'd use the unsweetened chocolate i had sitting in the cabinet.  I was under the impression that each wrapped block was 2 ounces and only ended up using half the chocolate the recipe called for.  They brownies were still very good and fudgy.  
One thing i noticed was that the ingredients calls for vanilla extract, but the procedure forgets to mention when to add it.  Don't forget to add it when making the brownies!

These brownies turned out wonderfully! I like them pretty fudgey- not cakey. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and baked them in a 8x8 inch glass pan. They were perfectly done in 30 minutes. I've been looking for a simple brownie recipe to send to my brownie-deprived friends in Russia. Thanks!

I found this recipe a few months ago, and now I always have to keep unsweetened chocolate squares on hand so when my fiance says, "Hey, why don't you make those awesome brownies tonight?" I'm ready!  A few tips from someone who's made this several times: I add a handful of chocolate chips and a handful of walnuts and it's great.  One time I forgot to set my oven timer, and so I had to guess whether they were done, which I'm not very good at.  A toothpick came out not quite clean so I let them go a little longer, and then a little longer... I kept them going until the toothpick came out clean, and that batch came out awfully dry.  Each cut brownie would crumble on the plate.  Next time I made them I experimented and threw in a little applesauce to get them a little more moist, and I took them out of the oven when the toothpick was just a little shy of being clean.  Very good batch!

Also, for some strange reason these are always much better on the second day, and even on the third day.  I say, make a batch and enjoy a little brownie that night, but save most of them for the next night.  Really good recipe for serious chocolate lovers!

I have finally found the perfect brownie recipe!!!  I prefer brownies to be really fudgy, like brownie mix brownies, but my husband likes them more cakey.  This recipe is the perfect middle ground for us.  I didn't have a 9x9 pan, so I used an 8x8 and baked them for about 35 minutes.  I also tried them in a mini muffin tin, baked for about 17 minutes, to make great brownie bites!

These were excellent and SUPER easy too!  I only had semi sweet chocolate chips, so I used about  1 cup of them. Then to balance things out I used 1 cup of sugar, rather than the 1 1/2 cups that the recipe calls for.  I also added some nuts (pecans) that I had on hand.  They're simple, tasty and sweet.

These were pretty good but not exactly what I was looking for. Time for brownies tend to be different for each oven. When the sides start to pull slightly from the pan; they are done. A tooth pick for a tester is not for brownies as they are supposed to be moist and chewy and tooth pick will be sticky!

I was rather disappointed by this recipe. I baked them JUST at the prescribed time limit (25 min) and they turned out quite dry. I have never had trouble with my oven temperature in other recipes and I lined my pan with parchment so I'm guessing that the time should be 18-20 minutes if you want them to be gooey. Another option might be to reduce the flour by 2 Tbs. I managed to save them by melting 2 ounces of semisweet chocolate with 1 Tbs each cream and butter to make a ganache to spread over top. They are now more like a cookie and at least they taste good, but definitely NOT fudgy!

This was very good and simple. I doubled the recipe and put in a 9x13 glass pan. I didn't have unsweetened chocolate squares so I used semi-sweet squares and cut down my sugar by 1/2 cup. These came out so fudgy. I made sure I didn't overcook, because this will effect the "fudginess" of the recipe.

These were nice tasting, but didn't turn out fudgy for me.  they were almost a mix between a really gooey brownie and cake.  Sorry, but i've gotta say these didn't hit the spot for me.

Simply awesome. I used the "Perfect Brownie" pan thing you always see advertised on TV to make these, and their chewiness makes them the perfect brownies for me. YUM

This recipe is no good. Way too much sugar and they don't taste like brownies at all. My husband said they taste like caramel not chocolate, but that's a bit generous. I was very disappointed.

Delicious fudgy yummy.  I wanted something baked and chocolate that didn't need milk in the recipe.  They also took more like 35-40 minutes in the oven, not 25.  Only change I made was using two pieces of baking chocolate, 'cuz I only had two, and used cocoa powder and applesauce to make up the other two pieces.  Had to eat these with plain water, but they were so good it didn't matter.

Very chocolatey and fudgey!  You MUST take them out while a toothpick test still shows batter!  If you wait until the toothpick is dry or almost dry, as for cake, they will be rock hard.  I took a cup of coffee, boiled it until it was reduced to about 2-3tbsp and added it to the batter.  This added an extra layer of flavor that I really liked.  I think I'd also add a pinch of salt and don't forget the vanilla.

I love this brownie recipie !! However i did not use unsweetened chocolate, i used 3 oz. of semi sweet chocolate. Also i only did a cup sugar. 
I thought it was even better because it was perfectly in between rich and sweet.
just an idea but the recipie in general is very good!!. I was pleased.

These brownies are a chocolate lover's dream.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for just under 25 min.  Before I baked them, however, I spooned about half a cup of dulce de leche over the batter and cut it through, and about half a cup of crushed pretzels.  They are awesome!

These are very fudgy brownies. Not the least bit cake like. They had a nice chocolate flavor and were super easy and fast to mix up. These are much better than any package mix. However good these are, they didn't make my favorites though. Excellent fudge like texture. Thanks for sharing, my family is going to gobble these up in a flash!

The flavor was awesome, but the texture was not what I wanted. I thought they'd be chewier... but they definitely are fudgy like the title implies- they almost melt in your mouth, they're so much like fudge!

Definitely a 5 star recipe.  Extremely easy and only one bowl to wash!  Be very careful not to overcook; I left them in for 25 minutes and wished it had only been 20.

The texture and consistency of this brownie were exactly what I've been searching for!  Too many brownies, even the ones promised to be "fudgy," turn out more cakelike.  Not these - they're definitely moist and rich!  But there was something missing in the flavor.  I can't quite figure out just what it was.  Perhaps I'll try adding a few mini chocolate morsels to the batter next time.  Thank you for this recipe; I will be making again, for sure!

These brownies were very "meh." They satisfied the sweet tooth my hubby and I had, but didn't do much more than that. They aren't very flavorful and were quite unimpressive. I won't make them again.

Awesome recipe...I put them in the oven for only 20 minutes and they came out perfect. I added the frosting from the zucchini brownies from this site and they were gone as soon as I took them out!!

Not bad, Better with some choclate icing on them. lol I will probably find some more recipes and do some trials to see which one works out the best. Im sure there are better ones out there. But I will say that this one is the easiest brownie recipe ive done so far.

Very good taste. And quick and easy too. I used 2/3 of the sugar and they were just the right sweetness. But they're not fudgy! I guess I expected them to be different, thicker and chewier. And they weren't very soft either!

I made these brownies hoping for the perfect recipe.  But when I took them out they were still gooey.  I figured that was just the "fudge" in fudgy brownies.  But I didn't enjoy the texture, although all my friends and family loved them.  After a day, the brownies were SO much better.  Delicious at 2 in the morning:]

These are REALLY good!  Quick and easy to make!  I didn't have unsweetened chocolate squares, so I substituted unsweetened cocoa powder and oil (3 tablespoons cocoa powder plus 1 tablespoon oil per oz/square of choc.). Came out AMAZING!

Amazing and I mean amazing! I was skeptical that a 9x13 pan would be moist, dense and chewy. However these baked at about 35 minutes deliciously! I followed as the recipe said and added pecans as well. Best brownies I have made and no need to but store bought! Thanks for sharing!

These were ok, but not the best.  My husband and I both like the Betty Crocker double chocolate mix better than this - seriously. I'm going to try another fudge brownie recipe on this site.

I guess I didn't read the recipe right because I did not put enough chocolate in, which made for some weird brownies. also forgot the vanilla but couldn't really tell the difference. The recipe wasn't very clear. I might try to make these again to get it right..

It took three time, for me to make. The last one I went with using foil in the tin. It help to keep it shape and easy to take out too.

hands down the best from-scratch brownie recipe I've ever made. the only change I implemented was melting the chocolate down completely with a tablespoon of butter and just softening the rest of it. I doubled the recipe and these were completely done in like 20 minutes so i'd say keep a close eye on them.

This was a great recipe all so for those of you reading the review that substituted whole wheat flour for the flour. It was grain and bad because you shouldn't substitute that in a quick breads recipe like brownies. Normal breads on the other hand are a different matter.

Tonight is my second time making these brownies. My husband and I love them! They are perfectly fudgy, very chocolatey and have the perfect amount of sweet for our tastes. The first batch was gone in two sittings :0 ! 
I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter this time and they' still taste super amazing!! Awesome recipe!

Like other people, I used chocolate chips (semi-sweet), decreased the sugar by 1/2 a cup, and didn't bake them as long as recommended because I really wanted them to be moist. They came out strangely light brown in colour and very dry. I had to mix up a thin icing at the last minute just to try to improve them a little.  I'll try it once again exactly as written because I always find it annoying when people mess with the ingredients and then complain. But I caution you not to substitute as I did because I was very embarrassed to offer them up on my treat day today.  Thank heavens they weren't my only offering.

I doubled the recipe and use a 9x13 inch baking pan. used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar and added 1 cup toasted walnuts and 1 cup raisin soaked in hot rum.
DELICIUOS. first time i made the recipe following the instruction and using a 9x9 inch pan. the result was a thin and crunchy brownie-big cookie too sweet for my personal taste. Now, with changes, i can say they are the best!
thanks for recipe

Very good brownie recipe! They're very chewy and chocolate-y, maybe even too sweet. I'm still looking for the perfect "compact" brownie but these ones are great for company.

The recipe was really easy to follow,very simple and I was amazed at how quickly I managed to get the mix made up. 

The final product was yummy,though i think i might have over cooked mine a tad as it had gone spongy at the edges. Sweet and choclatey and gooey. Very nice! i think you could add to this as well nuts maybe or chocolate chips even!
