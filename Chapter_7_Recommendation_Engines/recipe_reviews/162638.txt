I really like how this bread turned out, and it was super easy. A bit dense, but a little while after making it I got sick with the flu, and this makes great toast and was very easy to keep down. All the other recipes I found require a bread maker, which I don't have, so I was very happy to find such a easy recipe that doesn't require a bread maker. Definitely going to start using this bread instead of buying store made bread.

I found this recipe to be easy and it turned out great. I just left it to rise overnight and came out stunning.

The flavor, texture and appearance was excellent and no KNEADING!  Yeah!  One caveat...I think the cook time is waaaay too long.  I took it out at 30 minutes and it was very brown and definitely done.  Maybe my oven temp is not accurate, but I think I even could have taken it out at 25 minutes.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.

I doubled this to make a loaf of bread and rolls.  Very easy bread, and makes a very basic white bread.  Good as rolls or sandwich bread.  Bakes up beautifully as well.  I baked the rolls for 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven and they browned perfectly; the bread was done in 40 minutes at the same temperature.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first attempt at baking bread and it turned out pretty good.  I will probably let it rise longer so it isn't quite as dense, but the taste is great and my husband actually wants to use this bread to make his sandwiches.  I figured out the cost to be around $1.50 for one loaf.  I will probably grease the top (brush with oil) before it goes in the oven next time so its not so clumpy on top.  Thank you for this recipe!  I can save a lot of money by baking it myself.

Simple, delicious and  quick.  Wanted home baked bread with breakfast this morning and chose this recipe.  Was not disappointed.  My whole family enjoyed this loaf.  Thanks for sharing.
