I cut the recipe in half from 20 to 10 servings and I used chicken stock instead of the veggie base/water. Garnished it with cilantro and crumbled bacon and it was very good. Spicy yes but it is supposed to be. I will make this again and Happy New Year 2010!!!!

I made this recipe exactly as written and we all LOVED it!  Yes, it is spicy...but that should be expected as the description DOES say it's very spicy (honestly, have you ever had a chipotle pepper that wasn't)?  This was an excellent dish to have on a very cold day.  Even my picky 14 year old daughter ate it up!  I would not change a thing with this recipe and urge you to try it if you like spicy foods.

The carrots totally ruined this for me, they made it too sweet, will try again without the  carrots, and  add more garlic and chipotle , a cheese garnish would be good, creative idea , but it needs tweeking...

Came across this recipe last year when I was looking to expand my vegetarian cooking capabilities.  I remember it being so spicy, I could hardly eat it.  I made it again this year with a few adjustments.  I cut the recipe in half, then I doubled or tripled all the veggies.  I did not pre-cook the veggies, I just threw everything into the crock pot, because I was short on time, and a few hours in a crock pot will turn them into mush anyway.  I put in only half of the "better than bouillon soup base - as it has a lot more sodium than the nutritional info in the recipe seems to imply.  I crushed two big cloves of garlic, and chopped up only about 3 chipotle peppers from the can, and added them and whatever sauce was sticking on them into the crock pot.  (Two large and one smaller one.) I'd say that the majority of Americans would still find the result to be quite spicy.  Be careful with those chipotle peppers and Adobo sauce!

I guess I was not supposed to soak the black-eyed peas overnight, so the result is a little soupier than expected, and was ready more quickly than the recipe states.  But that worked out well, because I skipped lunch, so I was hungry early.  And it was yummy-licious, and I'll have to make it again soon!

My husband likes this, but it's too spicy hot for me and I only added two chipotle peppers, and none of the sauce. Very smoky flavor. If you like that sort of thing, and heat, then this is for you!

We love we had this tonight and it was great! I made some additions of jalapeno instead of Adobe because I didn't have any. I also added spinach, roasted diced tomatoes, kale, potato. It was soon good along with homemade cheese bread. YUM!

Excellent black eyed peas!!!  Cut the recipe in half. Used Siracha pepper sauce and diced jalapenos instead of chipotle peppers and Adobe sauce.  Worked just fine, not too spicy at all. You should add some salt to the beans when cooking. Did not add on this batch, and had to add to taste on each bowl. Some of the best black eyed peas I have had in some time.

I loved the flavors in this! My only complaint is that, like a previous reviewer said, the carrots made it too sweet. Next time I'll cut down on them, or skip them all together. Also,I cut way back on the chipotle to make it a little more kid friendly but I added some extra liquid smoke and about a tablespoon of smoked paprika.

Too few veg and too much chipotle.  The heat overwhelmed every other flavor.
