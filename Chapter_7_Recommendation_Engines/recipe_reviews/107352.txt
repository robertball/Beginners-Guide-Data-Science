It was okay. Not traditional, but a new type of dish. I think that everyone who CHANGES the recipe.. they did not even make it the way it said. If you are gonna change it, create your own recipe.

I made this dish for thanksgiving dinner tonight. Instead of using the french dressing, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup. I put just a couple of drops of the dressing in it. then instead of the french onion things, I mixed together plain bread crumbs with some hot and spicy bread crumbs with a little italian seasoning. when it was done cooking then I shredded some mozz. cheese on the top and put it back in to melt the cheese. My Husband loved it. And he is hard to please sometimes. this was a big hit.

This was good, but the taste of the French dressing was a bit overpowering. Make sure you like this type of dressing before making this dish. However my husband and I still liked the combination, and will make it in the future, with a bit less dressing or an additional can of green beans =o)

My family and I love this recipe.  Since we don't eat pork, I substituted bacon bits for the bacon.  It was definitely a hit!

For the first time everyone was asking me for the recipe, not the other way around.  The kids even loved it!  Plus the big bonus, no leftovers!

This was okay. It was certainly easy to make and the colors of the beans and bacon together made for a pretty dish. I loved the taste combination of the bacon and the green beans, but I wasn't a huge fan of the French dressing element. I used homemade French dressing and a lot of it pooled at the bottom rather than sticking to the beans. If you try this, I'd recommend using the thicker store-bought dressing. I might try this in the future using ranch dressing instead.

Wow, I was very pleasantly surprised by the end result!  I doubled the recipe and used fresh green beans because I had a surplus of them on hand.  I made the French dressing from scratch - after reading someone else's review saying that their homemade dressing was too thin for the casserole, I added some cornstarch and barbeque sauce to the dressing.  I also used seitan bacon to make it vegan friendly.  I added a teaspoon each of ground flax seed and nutritional yeast, and I topped it with my homemade cashew based grated-cheese type topping.  I would have never thought of this on my own, but I will absolutely make it again!

I made this pretty much according to recipe.  I did use frozen Italian style green beans (which I blanched and then cooled in ice water) instead of the canned.  Also, after reading the other reviews, I cut back a bit on the dressing.  This dish was well received by my guests.
