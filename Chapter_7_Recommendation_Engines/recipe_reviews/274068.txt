What a fun cookie to make! I followed the recipe as written. I did have to add about a minute or 2 to get my cookies golden brown. They cooked best on the foil vs. a baking mat. Super thin and yummy tasting cookies.

Theses were tasty, crispy and easy to make. I scaled the recipe in half and got 5 very large cookies. I used milk chocolate chips, personal preference. I also baked them for 9 minutes and they were barely starting to brown. Next time I will make them smaller. Thank you for the recipe.
