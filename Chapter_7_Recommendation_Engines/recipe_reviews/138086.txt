Great recipe (and I VERY rarely give 5 stars)! Followed it exactly. I have a couple of tips: 1) After whisking, wait for the froth on top of the mixture to dissipate before pouring into the ramekins. I poured the hot water and put the dishes in the oven before the froth went down, and the froth baked... making my tops bubbly and brown and ugly. I had to scrape them clean before I could add sugar to the tops. 2)PLEASE use a quality cream. I used a cheap cream because the good quality one at the store was close to its expiration date. The creme brulee was still wonderful, but we could definitely taste the poor quality cream.

This was a great recipe. I substituted the Irish Cream with Amaretto, and the results were fantastic. I would definently make it again!

Excellent.  First time I have ever made Creme Brule, and I stuck right to the recipe.  It was excellent.  I decided to try a recipe from another web site to just compare and it couldn't touch this one.  I will stick with this for good.  Thanks Grace

This turned out excellent! I used a butane torch to broil the sugar and served it with fresh whipped cream (that I added Irish Cream to) and a chocolate clover leaf. Suggestions: Be very careful not to let the liquid get too hot. To test when it is ready, coat the back of a spoon and run a line with your finger down the center. If the line stays, your liquid is hot enough. If it curdles, blend it with a small amount of milk and pour it through a strainer. Also, cook the custard to between 165 & 175 degrees. Any higher and it will separate.

Very good, but with only a subtle hint of Irish Cream flavor. Would have liked to see it more pronounced, so I'd suggest adding more. Rather than superfine sugar I used the coarser, demerara sugar.  My ramekins were shallow rather than the 6 oz. custard type ramekins and needed just 25 minutes of baking time, so the specified baking time is only approximate!

I followed the recipe exactly, and although time consuming, it was very easy to make. I didn't have Irish Cream on hand so I made it without and it was wonderful.

Followed this recipe exactly as written, and YUMMM! Do be careful when incorporating the hot cream / sugar mixture into the egg yolks--I strained the mixture through a sieve, and found a few teeny bits of scrambled egg.  The custard sets up beautifully--great recipe!

This was wonderful.  I put them umder the broiler but it is definately worth investing in a torch.  The upper half of the creme brulee was warm instead of the whole thing being cold.  Wonderful texture also.  I may try different flavors next time.

Excellent!  This was very easy to make.  I didn't have Irish Cream so instead I used Frangelico (hazelnut liquer).  I have a kitchen blowtorch which worked perfectly so the custard stayed chilled.

This was so delicious, I wish I had made larger portions! After asking Santa for a kitchen torch for a few years now, I finally got one and made this for New Year's. I didn't have Irish cream on hand so used up the end of some chai liqueur. It was amazing!

I made this on Valentine's Day and it turned out perfect. The irish creme gave it a nice flavor. I was on a time limit so I put the oven at 375degrees and baked it for 15-20 minutes. Let sit in the water bath for 15 minutes before putting the ramekins in the refrigerator. Used a torch to melt the sugar. Very yummy and rich!

Great, easy recipe, and it can be scaled down if, like me, you only have four ramekins.  Quick tip for those who hate waiting for the froth to subside: pour the cream mixture into the ramekins, then light your hand torch and quickly whisk it over the tops.  The froth will disintegrate.

I made this today and it turned out perfectly.  Tricks: Slowly bring the sugar and cream to temperature.  It doesn't take long, I think medium heat may be too high.  Also, slowly pour the cream mixture with the egg yolks.  There will be a considerable amount of foam once all of the cream has been mixed; this is where straining it before it goes in the ramekins is so important.  If it is not strained there will be a nasty layer on top. Update: I think I have perfected the recipe.  Instead of using 1/3 cup of sugar use 1/2 cup.  Also, instead of using vanilla extract using a vanilla bean.  Split the vanilla bean in half, scrape out the inside, and place both in the heavy cream.  Heat the creme and vanilla in a medium sauce pan.  In a mixing bowl combine the egg yolks with the sugar.

Just as a note 3 tb of Baileys is approx. 1 airplane bottle, if you want to try it without buying the whole bottle.  If you do end up buying the whole bottle, but don't like to drink it, may I recommend the Irish Cream Chocolate Cheesecakes also on this site. --Grace

TIP: To get superfine sugar just use regular sugar and put in a blender for just a short time and you will have fine sugar instead of buying it in the store.

Now this was incredible!!!!! What a great recipe. really important to follow the directions, especially when tempering. 3 tablespoons of the hot cream mixture at a time to the egg mixture and wisk at the same time. the creme brulee was so creamy and what an incredible flavor. I made 12 ramekins and our guests went crazy. They were really impressed when I pulled out my torch that I purchased at bed bath and beyond just for this dish. Used raw sugar to make the candy carmelized coating. Thank you for a truly incredible desert.

In reference to one of the comments. You dont have to cook the custards to 165 degrees, you are not making a filling for cream puffs. When you put your ramicans in the roasting pan w/water (water bath) it will cook in the oven. I have made my fill of creme brule's and you just need to dissolve the sugar,and you do need to strain it!

I've never made Creme Brulee before and this came out perfectly.  I didn't add the Irish Cream this time.  To check if it is "set", I used tongs to pick up a ramekin add 'jiggled'.  When only the center moved a little, it was "set" - about 55 min.

This recipe is definitely worth keeping around! Similar to other reviewers, I didn't have Irish Cream on hand so I used Frangelico - Hazelnut Liqueur and I was not disappointed. Other than using the different flavoring, I followed the recipe to a T and the crème brulee came out light, creamy, and delicious!Even my dinner guests that don't normally like crème brulee couldn't stop eating it (one practically licked the ramekin clean!). Just a note for first timers, when done mixing the ingredients together, the "custard" is more liquid than thick.

The literal translation of this rich dessert is "burnt cream" and this recipe is a good standard and works well. In French kitchens a Salamander is used to burn the sugar and is still my preference since I don't like the idea of a "fuel" torch close to food. When lining the pan with a towel soak the towel first otherwise you may absorb all the water before the custard sets, putting too much heat on the side of the dish.

I've made many varieties of creme brulee.  This one had us all raving last night.  The Irish cream flavor that comes through is great.  Everyone was very surprised to find out that I only used 3 tbs of the liqueur.  I will definitely make this again.

Having never made Creme Brulee before (but eaten my fair share!) this recipe was my first attempt.  It was a huge success, and resulted in a fight between the hosts of the dinner party that I brought them to over who got the last one.  I did a practice run the night before, and did find that the "foam" on the top baked into an ugly crisp, but solved that problem by stirring the mixture with a wooden spoon to dissolve the bubbles before pouring it into the ramekins.   The creme brulee was dreamy, with just a hint of the Irish Creme...so good, I am making it again tonight!

I have made this recipe twice with sugar as the recipe calls for and once with pure maple syrup to make it healthier.  It is scrumptious either way!  I recommend using a torch instead of broiling the top to keep the creme chilled.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was amazing. Honestly, I would much rather have this homemade creme brûlée than any of the restaurant ones I've tried.

Spectacular recipe. We were looking for something special to make for our New Years Eve dinner and did a test run of this. Turned out fantastic and has been added in to the rotation for "guest desserts".

Wife loved it and she has it all the time when we go out to eat.  I did not use the Irish Creme and kept the vanilla at the same amount as the directions.  I only used 5 egg yolks due the extra large Costco eggs I was using.(they are monster eggs)   I had previous tried the allrecipe creme brulee post using the double boiler.  This recipe turned out waaaay better than the double boiler recipe. We had some blackberries so we places a few on top to add some color and taste.  Good stuff!!!

I loved these, but wish they had a little more "irish cream flavor" in them... I halved the recipe and was able to fill 4 small creme brulee dishes.

This is fabulous! I used Kahlua instead of Irish Cream & added a dash of Pumpkin Pie Spice and got rave reviews from a few creme brulee die-hards. I would recommend straining the mixture thru a fine mesh sieve at the end of step 2 before you fill the ramekins to ensure you get the smoothest, silkiest texture. An excellent recipe, thanks!

i was looking for a good base creme brulee recipe and decided to use this one minus the irish creme. i didn't know what irish creme tastes like, so i didn't want to but a big bottle just for a little bit. turns out, its amazing even without it! made a whole variety of them,added fresh blueberries, semisweet chocolate chips, fresh rasberries, and fresh peaches. they were awesome!!

Very very addictive so make plenty. Buy a propane torch they cost about $3 and the tip about $12+ depending on the kind you get. It's worth getting the torch. Propane is 100% better than Butane, and you don't need to get a fancy "just for brulee" torch, just go to home depot, walmart, loews, etc. It's all the same for less money and more gas.

This is the first time I ever made Creme Brulee and it turned out delicious! I cut this recipe down to one serving just for myself and the Irish Creme flavour wasn't overpowering, but just right. The only thing I would recommend is investing in a torch to caramelize the top. I put mine under the broiler and it heated up some of the Creme Brulee by the time the sugar got caramelized. Otherwise, yummy and easy recipe.

I left out the Irish Cream, because I didn't have any and it was still perfect.  I'll never forget this recipe.  My boyfriend of several years took a bite of this, his eyes became wide and he said, "I didn't think it was possible to love you more..."

I rank this recipe a 5-star just for the brulee alone, I didn't have the Irish Creme liqueur on hand...I do have maple liqueur that I may try next time, but the basse creme brulee in this recipe is excellent exactly as written.  I used this recipe along with a merengue cookie recipe so I could use both the egg yolks and whites.  Thanks for sharing.

I never knew creme brulee was so easy.  Separating the eggs is the most time consuming part!

I have served this many times and it is always loved.  Depending upon the audience I will fore go the alcohol and increase the vanilla.

Learning how to make Cream Brulee in cooking school was one of the first custard style desserts we had to learn to make. I could make them in my sleep. I didn't have access to my old recipes so I used this one. I'm not sure what happened, but it lost almost half it's volume when it was baked. I'm going to have to start over again and try a different methoid.

WOW I have to wholeheartedly say, this is probably the best recipe I've pulled from this site.  Hubby and I were at a fancy restaurant the other day and had some superb creme brulee, so of course I wanted to try at home.  This is even better.  It's a tad time consuming, but not really all that difficult.  I heated the cream and sugar to about 140 degrees with no problems.  I whisked briskly but tried to not get it frothy.  I had no lumps or froth.  The hardest part is dealing with the water bath, transferring everything in and out of the oven.  Mine made 4 medium and 3 small ramekins.  All set up absolutely perfect.  Husband had a fun time torching the sugar in the raw we used on the top.  Which by the way, tasted great but was probably too course to melt exactly right.  Simply unbelievable texture and taste!  The irish cream with the creme brulee is divine and melds perfectly.  Reviewers aren't joking, the irish cream flavor comes through very well.  I might even lower the amount if I make it again.  I will definitely make this again the next time I have a craving, or if I truly want to impress someone at a dinner party.

One word...heavenly!!  I didn't have heavy cream, only whipping cream, so I used that instead, and I feel like that made it not so heavy of a custard.  Everyone loved it...hubby even had seconds!!!!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe :)

Made this over the weekend for a St. Patrick's day party. Everyone loved them!!!  Followed the recipe ingredients, adding a pinch of salt in with the sugar when dissolving it in the cream. Let the hot cream mixture cool about 20 minutes before VERY SLOWLY whisking it to the eggs. Before pouring custard into ramekins, make sure to STRAIN IT!  This removes any lumps and the froth. Filled 7 (4-ounce by 1-inch deep) ramekins 3/4 of the way full and baked in a water bath for 45 minutes, until centers just slightly jiggled. Cooled on the counter in the water bath until just cool enough to touch, removed them letting them cool about 25 minutes more, then wrapped them in plastic wrap, chilling over night. Used brulee torch to caramelize sugar on top. Irish cream flavor was excellent and not overwhelming at all. Will totally make again. One guest already called and asked me to teach her how to make them!

Excellent, easy recipe.  Bake and cool time does depend on ramekin size - I used the small, shallow oblong ramekins and it only took about 25 minutes to bake and set and half hour to cool.   Will definitely be making this again with more flavors!

I made this recipe exactly as listed.. with a little extra flavoring as the listed amount wasn't enough to make the flavor pronounced, but it was AMAZING! It wasn't too rich or too sweet. It was just perfect!

The Bailey's adds a subtle, wonderful taste.  Refrigerating for the afternoon along with the superfine sugar use makes for  a "must-have tap factor" to the top. I highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe was fantastic.  I made it for my wife and family and they loved it, said it was the best they ever had (probably humoring the new cook !!!).  Honestly, it turned out better than I ever thought, was super creamy & tasty.  I topped it with a puff of whipped cream and strawberry.  I also used raw turbinado Maui sugar & it caramelized very easily with the torch.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was soooooo good. like silk on my tongue. I love creme brulee and this was by far the best I've ever had, including when we go out. I used Bailey's Irish Creme with a hint of caramel and it was perfect. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very good recipe!  Very hard to mess up.  I do make either 1.5 times or double the recipe to fill my dishes.  Always get rave reviews!

These were pretty good. Bought a torch for this recipe (I'd been wanting one for quite  a while). Could imagine any number of liqueurs in this. The Irish cream was pretty subtle. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was very good, but a little time consuming and not quite as good as another recipe on allrecipe.com. I used 3 Tbsp of Irish Cream and it gave it a subtle flavor. I followed the instructions for 50-60 min baking time so I set the timer for 40 minutes and they were totally overdone. Next time i'll try 25-30 minutes. I had no problems with the eggs scrambling.

I often make creme brulee but this was the first time I put in Irish Cream.  It works very well.   The complements were enthusiastic and very sincere.  Every one loved it....But who doesn't love Irish Cream?  Thanks for a new, fresh idea on a old recipe.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! The only thing I changed was using 2 tsp. Vanilla and 2 tsp. Kahlua in lieu of Irish Creme - it turned out just like what you get in a restaurant. I also didn't place the ramekins on a towel. Worth trying, you will love it!

Great recipe.  Served this instead of cheesecake for Easter dinner.  When the family heard there will no cheesecake, they were all disappointed.  The cream brulee disappeared quickly.  Followed the recipe and it was perfect.  Make it the night before and refrigerated.  Torched the top before my guests arrived and decorated it with raspberries and a sprig of mint before serving.  This was a great make ahead desert.  Nothing to do when the guests arrived.  Thanks for making entertaining hassle free.

Texture was nice and creamy.  Very tasty.  Couldn't really taste the Irish cream though.  Also it makes a really small amount.  I am not sure what size ramekins make 6 but I made 4 average ones and only about 1/2 full.  I could have made just 3 good size ones.

I made this recipe for Sunday dinner.  The flavor was great and everyone loved it.  As for the Bailey's taste, it was lost in the dish, nobody cold tell it was in there and I used more than what it called for just so we could taste it.  Great Brulee but forget the Bailey's.  I followed the recipe exactly but just added more Bailey's.  Thanks for a great desert though!!

This recipe was delicious! Do try to caramelize the sugar with a blow torch, I followed someone's advice by putting these under a broiler, and it just didn't work out.

Had to substitue Kahlua in place of the Irish Cream as I discovered my Irish Cream was no good, but this turned out fantastic. I was a bit leery as the last time I made Creme Brulee was 6-7 yrs ago and I made either vanilla or chocolate and figured a box of pudding was just as good - that recipe also had you melt the sugar on the stovetop then pour/drizzle over the custard - it just wasn't the same crispy topping that you would get than if you used a torch. 
This recipe was super easy and super tasty - I highly reccomend adding a liquer or some other flavoring of your choice.(Instead of going plain vanilla - but that is my personal prefference) 
This was a hit with my parents, my husband and I as well as my younger thirteen year old brother and my two kids ages 7 and 4 - a recipe for all ages! Everyone loved it! I was almost hoping one of the kids wouldn't like theirs so I could have more!
Next time I will try it with Irish Cream, but I can bet it will be great either way!

Excellent recipe! It's the first time I've prepared creme brulee and it turned out almost perfect. "Almost" is there because it was a bit too sweet to our taste. I'll try to use 1/4 cup sugar next time.

My 14 year old daughter made this for a french class assignment... we sub'd Caramel Bailys for the Irish Cream and our ramekins were a bit deep so it took a little longer cook time but this turned out excellent. Broiled the sugar on top under the broiler and it turned out perfect!

Sooooo good!!   I've never attempted creme brulee before and I was a little timid about it.  It was so easy.  The Irish Cream gave it a wonderful flavor.  I will definitely be making this one again!

My 11-year old daughter has decided that Creme Brulee is her favorite dessert (after a trip to Disney).  We made this together and loved it!  Add a sliced and fanned strawberry to the top and you'll never know the difference.  Thanks for sharing!

This was my first attempt at making Creme Brulee.  It was excellent and I will make it again.  I doubled the recipe and made ten ramekins for a party.  I topped each with a chocolate dipped strawberry just before serving only because I had made a platter of them and forgot to put them out earlier.  It added a nice touch.

Ran out of ramekins and had to buy more just so I wouldn't waste the Irish cream goodness.

Simple and delicious.  We could not taste get even a hint of the Irish Cream so I will have to compare with a batch made with out it to see if there is a difference for me.

Not sure what the hype is all about with this recipe. I made it exactly as stated with quality ingredients and while the texture was great (near perfect, I would say), all I tasted was egg yolk. Perhaps the Irish Cream is just throwing the flavor off for me, but I think I will try this again with fewer yolks (maybe 4 or 5) and perhaps a bit more sugar or natural vanilla.

My ramekins are too big, I think, & the servings were too deep.  Use shallower ramekins next time. And try traditional creme brulee without the Irish cream.  Got to use my new kitchen torch, though!!  Very cool!

This is delicious and sooo easy to make.  Mine came out smooth and creamy and you can really taste the Irish cream.  It gives it just a little bit more interest than plain Creme Brulee.

This was a great hit at a dinner party I had last month.  I ended up using the broiler, but can easily see how a torch would more evenly distribute the brown topping over the custard.  Loved the Irish Cream flavor - definitely not too strong.  Will definitely make again.

I did the recipe word for word. There was enough glaze left to save in a small Ball jar. When we had the cake on the second day I put the cup of glaze in microwave and heated it just to warm. Then as each person got a slice they poured that luscious sweetness over their slice......YUM!

I have made this several times.  Lately I started substituting  vanilla sugar for the white sugar and used vanilla paste in place of the extract.  Makes the flavor phenomenal!

I have also made this with bourbon cream instead of Bailey's and think I like it even better!

Cheers!

I don't put and irish cream, but I do increase the vanilla. After I caramelize the sugar on top, I add fresh berries when they're in season. DELICIOUS!!!

Followed the recipe as written but used home raised Duck Eggs (larger yolks!) and vanilla paste (great flavor due to the vanilla beans).

I must have whisked too much because even though I poured the creme mixture evenly into each of the ramekins, each ramekin had lower and lower levels of creme once baked. I believe the very first pour had mostly whisked foam and as I poured the last, that one had mostly creme mixture.

Even with trying the two most creme-volumned cremes, my husband & I could not finish each of our dishes...they were soooo rich...we could only eat half of each! Possibly because of the duck egg yolks or possibly our pallets are changing for really rich, sweet desserts. But, the other halves went back into the refrigerator for another go at it tonight. I also think the remaining cremes will probably be tough since each has less and less creme in them.

Amazing recipe.  I have used the same recipe with substitutes for the Irish crème, like Godiva Liquor.  It is outstanding with any flavor  you want to use.  I just use the same amount of liquor with whatever flavor I want to go for.

I've made creme brulee before but wanted something festive  for New Year's dessert.  I tasted the custard (before baking) and noted that it tasted so sweet even though I cut the sugar by 1-2 TBSP.  The Bailey's Irish cream is so sweet on it's own.  I would consider going w/ 1/4 cup sugar (not 1/3) but I like my desserts less sweet generally.
To off-set the sweetness, I added about 1/4 tsp salt (the Real Salt brand) and it really balanced the excessive sweetness.  It tasted like salted caramel!  We'll see how it tastes after we do the brulee...
Ok update!  I increased to 5 stars because the taste was perfect so I take back what I say about the 1/4 sugar.  I think 1/3 cup is ok (maybe less 1-2 TBSP).  This recipe was met with rave reviews and I will be making it again.  I hope it becomes a tradition!

I have made this the last 4 years at Christmas.   Recipie never disappoints.   The only thing I would add is a glass of ice and pour the remaining Baily's over it until the cook is done...

I made it exactly as written except I doubled the recipe to make 8 servings
For a dinner party. Everyone loved it. It has just the right amount of Irish cream flavor, not overwhelming. It was very creamy custard. Yum.

Easy, dreamy and delicious. Couldn't taste the Bailey's much though. I'm making it again today... adding MORE Bailey's!  :-)

Excellent recipe. I was looking for a recipe without vanilla extract, as I didn't have any, and this was fabulous with no vanilla (I omitted), and I used Torani Hazelnut Syrup instead of the Baileys. Yum and easy.

Made it as written.  Next time I'd check it about 7-8 mins earlier so it'd be just a bit softer, however this was one of our favorite renditions of Creme Brûlée.

Can't believe how easy this is.  Irish cream adds  great flavor.  Wish I would have removed the frothy/bubbly top before putting in oven as it creates a bubbly crust which doesn't change the flavor, just the texture.

Easy as the recipe says and if you want to change it up add a little amaretto or any wonderful cordial to the mix for added flavor.

I'll definitely make this again.  Loved the custard.  I'm still trying to perfect getting a good crisp on the sugar. That's the only reason I gave it a four which is my fault rather than the recipe. I didn't change a thing and it was so easy to make.
