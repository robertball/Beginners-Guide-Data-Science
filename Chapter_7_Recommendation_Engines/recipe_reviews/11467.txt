At 83, I'm close to age of great grandma. I had this recipe a way back, too, and lost it. It was a favorite, so I'M SO HAPPY TO FIND IT AGAIN. THANKS.

I wanted to try to make a cookie using the dates I had and I happened to have frosted flakes, too. I thought the cookies were great. I'm not a big fan of dates either, but the cereal really gave the cookie a sweet crunchy texture, and the cookies were chewy on the inside, just the way I like it.

Was looking for a recipe to use up left over dates in & tried this one.  Great cookies, easy to make, and taste yummy.  May have to buy more dates & make more now. (:  Sandy

Next time I will make a bigger batch so I can have some.  I think my hubby ate a dozen right off the bat.

Teaspoon sized dough rounds makes alot more than two dozens. I made teaspoon and tablespoon size rounds and both were good. The rounds are indeed quite crunchy. I probably would cut my dates in smaller pieces next time. I used vanilla and almond Special K cereal. Good, but I prefer chewy cookies.

I made the recipe exactly as described.  Delicious cookies.  My husband likes a crunchy cookie and this fit the bill.  The recipe is a keeper for us.

I turned these into maple and date cookies for Thanksgiving and everyone went crazy for them!
I used 1 tsp vanilla and  1 tsp maple extract. Makes a lot of cookies.
