This is a very tasty combination of ingredients. The sweetness from the dressing works well with the salty bacon. I made half this recipe as I only needed a small cheese ball. The mixture is very soft at first. I wrapped the ball in plastic wrap and refrigerated it for about an hour before rolling in the parsley and nuts.

This was my first time to make a cheese ball. I was pleased over-all, but it was REALLY hard to get it into a ball shape. Maybe it's just me, but it was sooooo gloopy that I could barely get it together and roll it in the parsley. I do think it needs more flavor--garlic and herbs. Ironically I liked it better the same day I made it, not the next day. The sweetness of the french dressing had permeated the flavor by the next day and I am not into that flavor combo. I may make it again if I know it will be eaten the same day, and with the addition of some ranch (or Italian) dressing mix.

I needed a “French” app and this one looked perfect. Easy to make and delish. I followed the instructions and placed the mix on plastic wrap to form the ball.  You have to use a spoon to serve. Will make it again.

Creamy and delish.  Used pecans instead of walnuts.
