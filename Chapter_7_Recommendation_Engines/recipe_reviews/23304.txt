I actually chose this recipe because of the name, but it turned out to be a really wonderful dinner!  I made this for my boyfriend and another friend, and none of us missed the meat that is usually in stuffed peppers.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks!

Needs something more in the mix, it didn't hold together well and was flavorless unless it had some topping with it.  Next time I will add some tomato sauce to the filling, too.

My pic is the one with three colors of peppers  This turned out beautiful.  I used red, yellow, orange and green peppers for added color. My meat-eating-man ate two of these and asked for it to become a regular meatless Monday meal.  I did use fresh herbs as opposed to dried and I added a little bit of Worcestershire to the tom sauce.   This is a great make ahead meal.  I made it Sunday and refrigerated until Monday.  This is a fabulous recipe!  I've now made this five times.  The last time I used goat cheese in the filling and going forward that is what we will do.  THIS recipe is asked for often by meat eating man and boy.

This recipe is fantastic.  Had to reduce the amount by 1/2.  Also removed the celery - the combination of peppers and celery did not work for our family.

So delicious! I baked for about 40 minutes and they were a little crunchy, so in the future I will cook for a full hour.

These were good but it definitely needs more sauce - next time I will double it.  To the tomato sauce i added some oregano, basil and a dash of cayenne pepper(we like it a bit spicy)  It is a definite keeper!

I doubled the amount of tomato sauce, which I think made it better. Next time, I may throw a little corn it it, as well.

Susie's Stuffies are great! I cooked up a batch to impress my girlfriend.  I'm not a particularly good cook, and I found that the recipe was perfectly laid out and easy to follow.  Didn't have any tarragon, but it still tasted great!  P.S.   Those are my tasty looking stuffies displayed as the featured photo!
