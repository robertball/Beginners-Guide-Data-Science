We really loved this recipe! I didn't change anything because the sauce tasted so good as is ( used sugar free syrup and low sodium tamari because that's what I prefer). I did marinate it in some of the sauce for about thirty minutes before baking which helped capture the delicious flavor. Thank you so much for sharing!

A little too sweet for me, but I would think that people who like sweet main dishes love it. Felt a little too rich, too.
