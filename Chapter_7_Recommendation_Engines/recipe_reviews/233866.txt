All 5 people I prepared these for enjoyed them. A bit on the salty side but not a bad flavor. The pepperoni tasted like summer sausage. My biggest issue with this recipe was the dough; normally I make my own. I followed the recipe exactly and had so much trouble getting the dough the right size and to stay together.  I had a lot of leftover mixture.  Next time I'll definitely stick to homemade dough.

For us, this recipe made 6 triangles. I browned up a 16oz package of  sweet italian sausage but could only fit half in the triangles comfortably. They looked and tasted REALLY good! Husband and company loved them- they're perfect for a weekend meal or game day snack!
