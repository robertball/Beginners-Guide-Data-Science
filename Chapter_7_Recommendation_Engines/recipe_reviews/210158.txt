5 stars for the simplicity and how fast and easy this was to make. I didn't have bertolli jarred sauce, I just used some leftover that I had in the fridge. I crushed up a dried red chile pepper which made this very spicy!!! Don't do what I did and burn the garlic and crushed red pepper. I had to take it out and start over. Very tasty and cheap!!

Great little recipe.  Quick and easy.  Followed recipe exactly as written, and entire family thought it was the best spaghetti ever.  Definately will do again next weekend.

This was really good, and so simple. I had to make my own sauce though, because I didn't have any on hand, which is rare. I'll be making this one again.

Awesome sauce!  Made with spray olive oil however.  ONLY use 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.  Was plenty spicy for me, unless you want it REALLY hot!  Served with spinach salad with red onion slices & grated Lavender cheese with Ken's Italian dressing, wonderful compliment to the noodles!

I love this recipe for Arrabiata. This is my back-up recipe for nights when I'm clueless about what to make for dinner. I normally add some frozen broccoli or chopped up spinach to the sauce for something more than just pasta and sauce.

Tastes like something from a restaurant!  This has become a weeknight staple.  I like mine with some goat cheese on top.
