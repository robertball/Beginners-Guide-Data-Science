I used organic black beans and organic canned corn that I rinsed and drained really well before using in this recipe. I cut way back on the cilantro because I had homemade salsa that already had a whole bunch in it. Instead of lemon juice, I used fresh lime juice. Other than that, I kept every thing else the same. This is FABULOUS. I literally could not stop eating it. My oldest son and husband also really liked it, too though my husband did say that he would enjoy this more if he could scoop it up with tortilla chips! Very VERY good.

I liked this recipe but did make a few changes. I decreased olive oil to about 3 tablespoons vs 1/2 cup and used juice of 1 lime vs the lemon. I also added a diced a red pepper, a hot pepper and a hint of sugar. I think once it is chilled it will taste even better! So easy!

We really liked this but I used just half the amount of olive oil called for. Also, while I did have it sitting out for me to use, it was only after I had made the salad that I noticed I forgot to add the salsa.  No matter - it was light and delicious without.

Yummy! Headed to a potluck event and pondering thoughts of what dish would hold up and be yummy at the same time. This one works with the assistance of some tweaking. I added one fresh tomato chopped, an English cucumber, chopped and made fresh salsa.
FRESH SALSA: One can of stewed tomatoes, half jalapeno,two cloves garlic, 2 Tablespoons of chopped onion,  a couple of Tablespoons of cilantro and a dash of salt.Make sure you use stew tomatoes. They add a touch of sweetness. The fresh salsa makes this dish taste really good. Did not add the extra garlic to the salad recipe since it is in the homemade salsa.

I like to brown cumin in a skillet first and use fresh cooked or freezer corn. This dish is amazing w/ a chip, on fish, tacos, chicken or just by itself! Thank you for your share I lost my original recipe which was very similar.

I tried this recipe as is and it was great! I really like different kinds of beans, so the next time I made it, I used white beans and pinto beans in addition to the black beans. Like many of the reviews, I used less olive oil than the 1/2c called for. I love red onions, but the second time, I did not use a whole onion as I felt a whole onion was a little over-powering. Great recipe though. I count calories, so the only thing that was unclear to me is what  serving size is.

excellent.  I added bell pepper and I couldn't stop eating it.  Best if chilled for 4-5 hours.

The spicy black bean salad was a great success.  I used the the not salsa and gave it a real spicy taste.  It is a good side dish to add to your menu especially when you have guest who are vegetarian or vegan. It is a good summer salad and not difficult to make.  It will be used again this summer.

Made this to be a filling for some burritos. It was so yummy! And my vegetarian daughter loved this. Definitely let this chill for a couple of hours. The flavors blend very nicely.

Made this for Father's Day. Put it together in a matter of minutes--made the recipe exactly as posted. I let it sit all night in the frig because my experience is that most cold bean salads are best after 24 hours. I used fresh salsa that I purchased in the produce section at the supermarket, not the bottled type sold by the tortilla chips. This one is definitely a keeper; it is delicious. It's spicy but not too spicy, a little bit crunchy because of the red onion, has lovely color and texture, and makes a great side to barbecue. I will definitely make this recipe many times in the future.

This is a decent recipe as written. The dressing is very good (I cut the oil in half and used lime instead of lemon juice) However next time I will add fresh chopped bell pepper and tomato and omit the salsa. The salsa seemed to overpower the taste of the dressing. If time allows, marinate as long as possible. Thanks, this is a keeper for sure.

This is great.  Handy to have if you are a busy vegetarian.  I have also seen a similar one with avocado in it for more protein.  I agree it is handy in the fridge as it is very nice heated on tortillas.  I used half lemon, half lime juice for some extra zip and threw in a jalapeno.

I thought this recipe was okay, but like many reviewers, I didn't like so much oil.  What I did was to substitute the oil with a half cup of Bolthouse Ranch dressing (only 45 calories for 2 T. Yogurt based, found in the refrigerated case at stores).  I used 1 can of black beans plus the can of corn  and 1 cup of chopped red onions, 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, coarse ground pepper, and 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.  Sometimes I add a cup of jicama, chopped, for crunch and 1 cup of quartered grape or cherry tomatoes, when in season.  A squeeze of fresh lime juice and refrigerate.  I do not add the garlic and salsa.

We had it first as a side to chicken.  My 15 year old son said it was dangerous, when I told him it was good for him, the "Hello!" was heartfelt.  We had it with friends as a salsa it was even better!

The first time I made this, I made it as written except I reduced the oil by half.  It was pretty good.  The second time I made it I substituted cider vinegar for the wine vinegar and that made the difference - it was really good.  I think it needed the higher acidity to balance the oil.

Simple,delicious and easy to throw together.  I prefer to use green onions instead of red, though. Oh, the olive oil may very well solidify in the fridge, so let it sit out a few minutes before serving.

Made this for a party this weekend and it really great!  The only thing I changed from the original recipe was cutting down the olive oil to 1/4 cup as others suggested.  Making it the night before was a good idea--it tasted fantastic the day I served it and was a big hit with the vegetarians in the family.

Oh my goodness!  I just finished making this and when I tasted it, I almost skipped the refrigeration part, LOL!  It's delicious.  I prepared it following the directions exactly with the exception of the amount of oil.  I only used 1/4 cup.  Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe :)

After reading the reviews, I used half the amount of olive oil.  In addition, as a personal preference, I decreased the amount of onion and used frozen sweet corn.  This healthy dish was light and delicious, and I highly recommend it.

This recipe is wonderful, only change I made was to use only 3 tablespoons of oil as suggested by others.  My husband said it is the best salad he has ever tasted.  I think it tastes better on the day it is made.  Thank you for the post

Really great recipe!  Will taste even better once it has time to chill.  I added chopped orange bell pepper and reduced the garlic to 2 instead of 3 cloves.  The cilantro just gives it such a fresh taste.  Love it!

I make this recipe all the time.  It is just me so I make half a batch each time.  It is great for a quick lunch just by itself.  I also took it to our Drop in potluck and everybody loved it!  Had to make more when I got home as there was none left.  I will try the less oil and as I have trouble getting fresh cilantro the dried works too.  Mixes well with rice or quinoa.

This was really DELISH!! The only changed I made was used imported Spanish sherry vinegar as I did not have any red wine vinegar... The flavor was amazing!!   I will for sure use this vinegar the next time I make this... I made this to go along with my carnitas meat and cilantro lime rice.. I just layered in a bowl to make burrito bowls... Fantastic!!

Very good!  Used a 1/3 of the onion and 1/2 of the oil, plus no cilantro.  Just personal taste.  I ate as a side, put on cheeseburger for topping or ate with tortilla chips.  Easy and Delish!

Although not spicy, it's definitely as good as any salsa or appetizer to eat with tortilla chips in any restaurant! I added 1 chopped red bell pepper and 1 cup of cherry tomatoes and all the flavors just came together! Delicious!

My wife and I loved this.  The only changes I made were I added some chopped red and yellow bell pepper to give it color.  If I made it again I would cut the oil in half and not put so much salt in.  We put them in wraps with lite sour cream and guacamole.  One reviewer suggested shrimp and I think that would be great.  The recipe makes enough for a party.  I agree that it is better made a day ahead to let the flavors meld.  This is a definite keeper.

A good base recipe, although low on vegetables for my taste. I tweaked it based on another recipe, decreasing the onion and cilantro slightly and adding chopped yellow, red, and green peppers. I used slightly more vinegar, including adding a splash of balsamic, and I replaced the lemon juice with a smaller amount of lime juice. I also added a very generous splash of hot sauce.  I used only a small sprinkle of salt.

I used 1 can of black beans only; a can of Rotele diced tomatoes instead of salsa; 1/2 small sweet round onion. It tastes  good; quick & easy to prepare & make ahead for a cookout, picnic & entertaining.

I have made this twice; the first time as written.  I agree there is too much oil which muddies the flavor.  I cut the oil by half, upped the vinegar and substituted lime juice for the lemon.

This is easy to put together, uses ingredients in most kitchens and can be slightly varied to suit individual tastes.  It makes a great side dish and could be used as a main dish for vegetarians. Next time I'll probably add jalapeños or canned green chiles to ramp up the spiciness.  The combinations of the different veggies makes great crunchiness and a lovely table presentation.

Amazing...love this salad, make it all the time now. Good as is, also good with some avocado chopped into it (on the plate) - chicken makes a fine addition to make for a hearty meal.

I have been making this for over a year. All my friends now ask for it as part of our pot lucks we have.  Try it simple easy and tastes great. (Let it marinade for 2-3 hours ) or else the left overs will taste better than the meal.

I gave it a full star review even though I made a couple of changes because the basics are here...people can modify to their personal taste as they please but this recipe is definitely a starting point. I reduced the oil to a splash and substituted the the vinegar with plain white vinegar and the salsa with left over Pico de Gallo mixed with a bit of Louisiana Hot Sauce, made my beans from scratch instead of canned, used frozen corn instead of canned. I omitted the onion because there was plenty in the Pico de Gallo. What can I say? Simply divine! Can't stop eating it! I am worried there won't be enough left for dinner tonight! ;) I plan to serve whatever is left tonight with panfried garlic, chilli fish and cajun spiced rice! Yum!

Followed recipe exactly, except we aren't fans of cilantro and left it out, also cut the oil in half,  and we loved it.  So good as a side salad, keeps well for days.  Great dish to take to a pot luck.

This is excellent!  I've used it as a side dish, and as a salsa with chips.  It always goes over great. I,too, used half the olive oil called for.  Other than that, it's a keeper!

Needed a side dish to bring to a barbeque and this worked as both an appetizer with corn chips and for a salad with the meal. Loved it, and it's a great recipe for tweaking... have some fun with it. Thanks.

Very good.  It was a hit at the UMCK choir potluck.  Used half as much oil as called for, and substituted Adobo with cumin for the salt.

This was great!  Halved the recipe, used homemade salsa and a little less oil (per other reviewers' suggestions).  Took it to "lunch with the girls" and everyone enjoyed it.  It's great for last minute as most of the ingredients are on hand.   Thanks, kmhammer, for a simple, healthy salad.
