Unbelievably good! They really do taste just like meatballs.
Hints - 
* It is vital to use a stuffing mix with seasoning (I think some of the reviews that say it was bland may have used just bread crumbs).
* I added about 1/8 - 1/4 tsp pepper, a couple of dashes of Cayanne, and 1-2 cloves garlic.
* It seemed a bit dry when I was stirring it, so I added a few Tbsp cottage cheese.  There are probably lots of things you could use.
* definitely turn them a few times during cooking to get a more even brown.

My family loves these at our holiday get-togethers. I stick to the recipe, and just add a bit of garlic powder. I make a dipping sauce from 1/2 cup light sour cream, 1 tsp mustard, dash of worcestershire, and 1 tbsp of soy sauce (adjust to taste). Healthy and good!

These were FANTASTIC! My guests devoured a double recipe of them! Per reviews already posted, I added salt, pepper and a T of Worchestershire. I also baked them in mini muffin pans. They were superb!!

LOVE them! Made them for Christmas and everyone wanted the recipe. You do not need to freeze/thaw them. Put them in the fridge for half an hour so you can roll them into balls, but you can cook them immediately after rolling them (just watch as they won't need as long to bake). Altermatively, freeze them for a few days and then cook them fresh later. Or you can cook them the day before your event and then reheat in the oven the next day to serve them. Any of these ways, they all taste awesome!! I added 2 minced garlic cloves, reduced butter to 1 1/2 Tbs. Also used a clean kitchen towel to squeeze out all liquid from spinach before adding to mixture. I'm having more people over and making them again. So very tasty!

I made these at a small dinner party for an appetizer! The guests loved them and I alos thought they were pretty good! I would make them again. The only confusion I had was what exactly the stuffing mix was so I used pepperidge farm herb stuffing.... is this right?

I tried these using fat free cheddar and egg beaters and used kelloggs corn flake crumbs instead of bread crumbs to lighten it up a bit and make it lower in carbs and fat but they didn't have much taste. I added salt and pepper to it but it needs a little more spice of something and I don't know what. That will be the fun of it to make them again and try a few spices. We used fat free sour cream to dip them in and that was good. Thanks! I will try again!

I use this recipe w/out the cheese and when cooking, turn the spinach balls after 10 minutes to brown more evenly. The first time I had these it was in a candlelit room and I thought that I was eating meatballs! Even non spinach lovers will like them!

Yummy!  I used the seasoned stuffing mix and also made the dipping sauce recommended by another reviewer: 1/2 cup light sour cream, 1 tsp mustard, dash of worcestershire, and 1 tbsp of soy sauce  They disappear fast!

These are tasty and more importantly for me, forgiving.  I went a little rogue and used half a cup of cottage cheese (as per someone else's suggestion), 2 tbl spoons of olive oil instead of butter, and added parsley because I had some extra I needed to use.  I also used a blend of asiago, romano and parm from Trader Joe's instead of cheddar.  No dip needed!  They were a hit!  Oh, and I say forgiving because I misread the directions and formed the balls and then chilled them in the fridge (skipped freezing all together) and they still came out great, just maybe a little less shapely than if I chilled the batter first...duh.

This has been a family favorite for many years at my house. I add some hot pepper (pizza style) and my daughter adds a bit of french dressing. At Christmas time we call them Holly Balls on St. Patrick's Day they are Lephrican Balls...I will have to try them with a dipping sause that sounds good.

Wow these are delicious!! I used fresh spinach since I had it on hand and I used olive oil instead of the butter and they were soooo yummy with cocktails! I skipped the "freeze" step to go head and cook about half of the recipe. The other half I am going to leave in the freezer to have on hand in case people stop by or if I need a quick appetizer. Next time I might add some additional herbs and/or spices and maybe try some other cheeses (mozerrella swiss etc) I am so pleased I found this recipe!

Hard to stop eating these. I used fresh spinach fresh parm and feta because it's what I had and ended up needing more bread crumbs(about 3.5C total). I also forgot the onion which I think was missed and made a simple marinara for dipping. They seem drier at room temp than they are warm. So might be hard to "set out"

I made these exactly as stated.  My bf and I thought they were great - but next time will reduce the stuffing mix by about 1/2 C.  These were a bit dry - but with that modificationm - they would be awesome!!! :D

If you love the taste of stuffing your guests will love these! I made these for 2 parties & both times they were eaten right away. Next time I think I will use shallots instead of onions to give them a sweeter flavor.

Once you get past all the refrig/freeze/thaw these are easy and tasty. Used Way Easy Pizza Sauce from allrecipes for a dip but ranch would probably have been good too. Tasted better after a day or two.

I will say it was easy to make - however I agree with another guest that they were a little bland kinda like eating spinich stuffing. I too was not to thrilled and had alot left over - no one wanted to take them home. So - I probably would not make these again - the recipe sounds tasty - but I personally thought it was rather bland.

These were quite pretty however I must admit I was disappointed. They were dry and kind of tasteless. I have subsequently looked further on Allrecipes and seen similar recipes with more butter and spices... and I would suggest you look elsewhere too. A good concept but just not a great recipe.

Awesome. I add Elk Sausage and Sage Sausage shredded carrots and a ton of freshly chopped garlic. Tonight I tried it with whole wheat bread I toasted in the toaster in place of the stuffing mix! Delish. Easy to freeze and reheat in oven.

I was excited to try this recipe but the final product didn't have much flavor. It definitely needs some salt in the recipe to help it out but I don't know if that will solve the bland taste. Sorry but didn't live up to it's rating.

I'm not sure what the big fuss is. These were bland and needed a sauce to add flavor to it. (I used Teriyaki sauce) My guests were polite and said they were good but noone had seconds!

These weren't bad but they weren't really good either. I followed the recipe using seasoned stuffing mix and added a little extra seasonings. They still tasted like they were lacking something. Maybe needs a sauce? They mostly just tasted like stuffing. I don't really think they tasted like meatballs as some reviewers said. But I guess if you're a vegetarian its close enough.

These turned out great! It was hard to not devour them before taking them to a party I’m going to! I doubled the recipe as most reviews said they went fast. I followed the recipe with some minor changes. I didn’t freeze/thaw them, just left them in the fridge for about 1/2 an hour. I also used about 3/4 of an onion and added garlic salt. SO YUMMY! I’ll definitely be making these again.

These were great everyone loved them and they were fairly easy. I did bake them a little longer than recommended and did roll them around to get a crust on the outside while they baked. Otherwise perfect easy appetizer and a great way to use up spinach from the garden!

I made these for my family first before I brought them to a function and thought they are okay but need something to spice it up a little. I will try again with maybe garlic salt etc. My husband really liked them which is a good thing. He usually is my worst critic so I did something right.

I didn't change a single thing...although I admit I didn't measure the salt and pepper. These went over very well for our Christmas Eve supper along with sausage balls. We dipped the spinach ones in ranch dressing. Yummy! Will probably make again for a party or appetizer meal.

4 stars as written, 5 stars with reviewer suggestions. I used seasoned stuffing mix, added garlic and cottage cheese to the mix and made them in mini muffin tins. I made a dipping sauce of sour cream, mustard, Worcestershire and soy sauce (all of these changes were from reviewers). Took them to a Super Bowl party and they were very well received. Got a thumbs up rating from all!

Very easy. I skipped the freezing/fridge part all together. I put these into a mini-muffin pan. I used 16 oz bag of spinach and a half cup more cheese and an extra egg. Came out delish! I’d probably add more spices next time (even though the bread stuffing I used was seasoned, I still like a lot more flavor).

I have made these a couple times. they are quite good. I don't do the freeze part as it doesn't seem necessary. I have had people who don't like vegetable eat a number of these. they are pretty good alone but I included a ranch type dip with them the second time much better. also can't help but add that I hate when people change just about everything about the recipe and then give it a bad review.

The blue cheese and asparagus work well together but I felt the bread did not complement this appetizer. I'm sure if we had served these up at a party people would have said they loved them but we tried them pre party and in the cold light of day they were just OK.

It was delicious but don't use the amount of onion use about half of that. As a replacement use more of the stuffing! It goes really well with dill dipping sauce

I followed the recipe used a box of stuffing mix made for chicken that already had seasoning in it. I agree with other reviewers it needs more. Definitely salt maybe a kick of garlic or as other reviewers suggested worchestershire? I did NOT re-freeze it. You DO need to put it in the fridge for the 30 min. to form the balls. I used a tablespoon measurer to form the balls and popped them in the oven for 10 min. Really good and made 26 good bite-sized appetizers that way.

Very easy and delicious. I did not make them ahead so didn't freeze and thaw but it's good to have that as an option. I brought mine to a party and they were gone fast!

These were so good! I only had minced onion on hand so I used that instead. Also added some crumbled bacon to half the batch and baked them in mini muffin tins. Everybody loved them!

Very good. Best served warm is only difficulty for a large pot luck or party. Serve them when the gathering is at your house so you can make sure they are eaten when hot. Delicious!

Tasty and easy appetizer for my get-together! I skipped the freezer part and baked them on a Pampered Chef stone. I cut a few minutes off the bake time so they didn't dry out too much and they were yummy!

These were very tasty and I'll make them again. I used pork stove top stuffing. It would probably be even better with ground pork added in. Next time I'll chop the spinach even finer. As the chopped frozen spinach out of the bag was too long.

These appetizers were all right but I didn't think the flavor was too exciting. I had to completely rework the "dough" because with the recipe written as is it didn't stay together at all. It was way too dry so I added another egg which wasn't enough so I ended up having to add some cream cheese to give it more stickiness. I don't think I would make this particular recipe again because of the problems with the dough being too dry and something needs to be added to flavor it up a little more but it was fun to try. Thank you for the recipe Diane!

Great "make ahead" dish. Served them at a party and they were the first item to run out. Even got asked for the recipe. My grocery store only carries the plain stuffing mix at Thanksgiving so I used boxed sourdough stuffing mix. Turned out great.

It was pretty tasty and easy to make so I might make it again if I can serve it hot. They were room temp by the time they were served. I did use the Peppridge Farm Herb Seasoned Classic stuffing mix combo cheddar and mozzarella cheeses and olive oil vs butter. No pre-freezing but did turn them once. Would compress them more next time before baking. They didn't look very appealing but taste pretty good.

I add 1/2 cup Feta cheese and 1 cup of FRESH parmesan cheese the good stuff! Add oregano (1/2 tsp) fresh ground black pepper and fresh Italian parsley to the mix. I sauté' the onion (sweet onion) in the butter before adding it to the mix... imparts a better flavour. I serve these with a homemade honey Digon mustard dip - I mix it too taste. I make them quite often so I double the recipe put balls on baking sheet into the freezer when frozen I pack them in small packets and back into the freezer. I freeze them uncooked then bake. They freeze well. On occasion I added cooked Kale to the recipe. If I am baking the same day I do not freeze them. Tip make sure you squeeze out the excess water from the spinage else they will be too soft to ball up.

Friends loved it! I did not follow the recipe because I did not thaw or drain the frozen spinach. I think it actually made them moist. Will make for Thanksgiving because I used the Herb dressing mix; nice complement as an appetizer.

Party hit!! MUCH better than the other Spinach ball recipes. Im a bit OCD about how frozen spinach tends to have huge fibrous stems in it so I do take the extra step after draining of going thru it by hand while it's in the colander and picking out the big ones.

Amazing! I skip the freezer step altogether and the balls are incredibly moist. Place the mix in a plastic sandwich bag in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or a few days. I bake them for 25 minutes in mini muffin tins sprayed with olive oil cooking spray. Flip balls after about 15 minutes. I've made them 3 times for dinner in the last week! Tonight they are a side dish to beef stew and last week they were a great appetizer while waiting for the corned beef to finish in the crockpot after work.

The one thing I cut down by 1/2 was spinach. I just thought my girls wouldn't like all that much. I wanted to form a ball for baking sheet. But I have a cast on on my arm. I used cupcake pan scooping with an ice cream scooper. Very easy to make i will refrigerate them in a bag to heat when wanted especially for breakfast Tina Haf

They were ok.  i think if they had sausage also, it would have been a 5 star appetizer.
