I grew up to love zucchini because of this "frittata" as we called it.  It was everyday food for us, but only during summer when Grandma, and then Mom,  grew zucchini in their garden. I feel for the submitter, because it's difficult to put this down in recipe form!  It's never measured precisely, and the ingredients are never carved in stone.  Add mushrooms, onions, and/or chopped tomato if you like, which is what I did today.  I use fresh garlic, not garlic powder (grandmas didn't have garlic powder!)  and not nearly as much Parmesan as the submitter directs - we use grated Parmesan at the table just like salt and pepper - just sprinkle it on to your liking.  I didn't need a recipe for this, of course, but I wanted to let others who aren't familiar with this know that this is the real deal in Italian households - no plain ol' scrambled eggs for us!  Times have changed since I was a young girl with so many fruits and vegetables now almost always available in our food markets. Now I can enjoy this profoundly nostalgic, simple plate of food all year round.  (Best, I might add, with toasted, homemade Italian bread!)

I grew up eating this as our garden was always abundant with zucchini and I still make it frequently. I start with sliced sweet onion (and a little chopped fresh garlic if you like it) . Saute onion in olive oil until softened; add the sliced zucchini and cook until tender. Add a little fresh chopped basil to the zucchini if you have some in your garden! Pour the eggs with Parmesan over the mixture and cook until set. Serve with a nice piece of crusty bread and a sliced tomato.

Having some zucchini and wanting to use some up I'm glad I found this recipe! I did mince up a clove of garlic and used some of that instead of using the powder. This was great! Thanks for sharing!

What a healthy and delicous breakfast!  And I must admit a nice change from my usual yogurt.  I used fresh garlic instead of powder and added some onions and tomatoes to get more veggies.  This went great with multi-grain toast!

This recipe is very similar to one that my mom always made for us in the summer time when zucchini was abundant. Her version doubles all of the amounts, add 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, line a pie pan with cresent rolls and brush with one tablespoon of mustard. Then add the zucchini mixture. Bake at 350 for 40mins OR until center is almost set. Allow it to rest for 10-15 mins then slice and serve.

This is an excellent recipe! I made a couple changes, but I think it would have tasted great as is. I crushed a couple cloves of garlic into the hot olive oil and sauteed it for about a minute, then added the zucchini and some white mushrooms I needed to use up. Definitely a keeper :).

This is a good recipe but here's how to improve on it: saute 1/4 cup chopped white onion with the zucchini.  The onion imparts a (just slightly) sweetness to the zucchini that keeps it from being bitter.

This was delicious and super easy for breakfast.  I followed the directions and the seasonings were just right for us.  My nine year old and I loved it.  I will make this again.

My husband and I thought this was very good. I needed a quick lunch that used up some garden produce. The egg flavor complimented the zucchini nicely. This was quick, easy and tasty. I added onion to the saute. Good. I will make it again.

Simple and delicious!  My son, who hates zucchini, gobbled it down and asked for seconds!  My alterations: grated zucchini, 2 fresh garlic cloves in lieu of the powder, and a sprig of fresh chopped rosemary.

I took "goodcooks" recommendation and added the basil right at the end...what a difference. This recipe went from really good to great! I also added 1/4 red pepper and 1/4 red onion sauted with the zucchini. Super fantastic!!!

Wonderful combination of tastes in the morning! I sauteed garlic and onion with the oil first and then added the zucchini. While those were cookin, I cut up some jalapenos and bell pepper. After adding those in and letting them soften up, I poured in the egg mixture which included salt, pepper, soy milk, Parmesan, rosemary, oregano, and basil. I served it with toast and salsa on the side. Delish!

I love this recipe! I sometimes add some onions,  which gives it a really great taste and I omit the cheese, as I like to cut down on calories.
My Italian friend adds just a pinch of cinnamon which adds a Middle East taste.

yep, made this sort of thing for years during zucchini high season.  I grate and squeeze and lightly saute (just until a bit brown around the edges) zucchini before I add the eggs.

Delicious, and a great way to use those ever-abounding zucchinis in the late summer/early fall.  My husband (who also cooks) told me that the "presentation" factor was a bit lacking, but that didn't seem to affect the end result - no leftovers!

I made this for breakfast and my husband loved it. I used chopped garlic from a jar instead of the powder and used grape tomatoes from our garden (as pictured). I made it for myself one weekday morning while my husband was at work... I substituted the Parmesan for feta.. something my husband can stand. Even better!! :~)

This tasted very good.  I made it for one person so only used two eggs and one small zucchini.  I used 1/3 of a cube of frozen garlic because I didn't have powder.  Many thanks LinH for the recipe!

Very filling and delicious.  I used minced garlic and cooked it with the zucchini rather than use powdered garlic.  Also doubled the recipe for four people.

I thought this tasted pretty good, but it seemed to be missing something which I am trying to figure out. I was thinking maybe fresh garlic, a tad more olive oil, a sprinkle of minced onions. I made 1/2 recipes just for myself. I am glad I did because no more than that would have fit in my pan. 1/2 recipe could easily serve 2 also, as suggested, by the servings. I ate some with some 100 cal. honey wheat toast thins. It was very filling. TY

OMG! I never would have thought to combine zucchini, garlic, parmesan cheese and eggs! What a great combo! I followed another reviewers advice and substituted fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Quite delish! I will be making this again for sure!

I prefer it cooked with a little butter instead of olive oil.  It was quick, easy and good.

I discovered this fantastic receipe when I lived in Seattle, Washington 20 years ago on a local Radio Show cooking show hosted by Kathyn Kauhlman. It was a daily show and she had some really incrediable receipes to share with her listeners. 
I have made this fantasic recipe on the weekends and everyone who has tasted it truly is impressed and of course have shared this receipe. It most certainly is one of our favorites. Hope everyone will try it and will truly enjoy it as much as my family does!

If you can find avocado oil, it's a rich and healthy stand-in for the olive oil. As someone stated, you can add so many things to the basic ingredients. I happened to toss in some tapenade. Wow!! d'avo is the avocado oil brand I used.

This is absolutely delicious.   Been making this for years.  The recipe as stated is good.  It's one of those recipes that you can add anything you like.  I just happened to make this for breakfast this morning and had some left over fried potatoes that I threw in with the mixture.  A little Franks Hot Sauce on top and yummy..

Very healthy option for any time of the day! RE: GOODCOOK...thanks for your recipe as well! Might have been better to submit yours as a "II" version since it will be more visible to others than as a "critic" of this one?? I love anything that's Italian cusine having married into a family from Lake Como!

I just made this for the 1st time tonight and am really happy I found this simple recipe. I made one serving for myself and adjusted the recipe slightly to make it healthier. 1 1/2 tsp of oil for only 1/4 zucchini is really a bit much. I used 1 egg white, 1/2 tbs parm cheese and 1/2 tsp olive oil, 1/2 zucchini, garlic powder, pepper, and omitted the salt. I cut it into pieces and topped it with slices of avocado and roma tomato. It was DELICIOUS! I had a crisp Fuji apple afterwards. If If I'm really hungry I will use 2 egg whites and a whole zucchini. I cannot wait to make this again tomorrow!

Zucchini & Eggs Haiku: "Halved the recipe, was just me eating for lunch. Just needed color." Nice and easy dish to make, and while I ate some tomatoes on the side, I think adding diced tomatoes, (along w/ maybe onion and minced garlic instead of garlic powder) would've made these eggs eggceptional.

I do something very much like this in the oven in a small casserole dish brushed with olive oil- cut up a large zucchini, add two to three eggs, stir it all together with red pepper flakes, garlic, salt, oregano, then top with cheese. Good topped with pimento cheese instead of parmesan for a "Southern" flair as well.

My husband made this and he rarely tinkers with ingredients, so we ate this pretty much as written.  I'm sure I'll play with it a bit, adding spices and herbs, when I make it myself.   It really only selrved the two of us for brunch so it should be at least doubled if you're serving this as a main course for the whole family.

Oh wow, this showed up in my email and I opened it up to see if it was the same recipe my SIL gave me 15 years ago - it is.  This is an excellent side dish (I serve it as that) - so tasty, perfect textures, never met anyone who hasn't liked it yet.  Pretty much failproof,

Awesome!!! Okay so I did add a lot more...but I wanted to experiment. I added 1/2 chopped onion, 1 chopped tomato..and here is the best...I added water about 2 cups..let it come to a boil and added stone ground grits. I let the grits cook down until no water left...added the eggs and cheese!! YUMMM!! Loved by all here at home!!! Thanks so much for the great idea!!

A very delicious "anytime" dish!  I did saute some thinly sliced sweet onion with the zucchini and added a small amount of water to the egg/parmesan mixture.  I fixed this for a quick supper served with a handful of grape tomatoes.  But it would be good for brunch, lunch, well, anytime!

Fast, simple, healthy, and tasty.  I used one small zucchini, one egg, and a 6” non-stick skillet and it made one perfect portion.  It’s not a mind-blowing dish but it is very good.

Didn't think it could taste that great. Played it safe by using a yellow zucchini because I was worried that if I used a green one, it would have a bitter taste. Used some green onion to give it more flavor. I must repeat it!

Delicious! A new way to make scrambled eggs. I was out of the zuchinni so I substituted summer squash and it was good flavor. National Calendar Day is National egg day today so I decided to try a new recipe, simple but tasty!

Very simple and flavorful. Easy to tweak based on ingredients on hand. I've added brown rice and a couple extra eggs & we loved it that way, too.

It was alright. I didn't particularly care for the zucchini. I added onion and that made the eggs really good with the garlic. Now I have a new way to cook eggs at least.

I have  made this several times for breakfast and lunch this summer when I had so much squash I didn't know what else to do with it!  It made for a delicious and quick meal.  Note that I did use yellow squash mixed with the zucchini several times, and that worked just as well.

Nice!  I fixed this just this morning and my husband was unsure about me doing something different to our traditional scrambled eggs.  He tasted it and said it was "good but could use some cheese."  When I told him it had parmesan cheese, he said it was good again.  While we were eating, again he said it was good and had seconds.  Wow, I got him to eat vegetables that early in the day.  Recipe is good as stated.  I can see experimenting based on your own tastes buds but I think this is basic enough for most to enjoy as is.

Just OK for me.  Recipe did show me that zucchini would be a nice addition to other vegetables in an omelete.

Hey good cook.  Why don't you post your recipe as a new recipe rather than trash this one.  Let  others decide which they like better and which they prefer to cook.  This is a really quick,and easy "anytime"meal.  I stopped reading your view after the first sentence.

This is on of my all-time favorite combinations - with bonus points for being easy, cheap, and versatile. I do prefer fresh garlic, but have used powder. I like a little sauteed onion, but don't always add it. I often cook it in omelet form rather than scrambling. Sometimes I add some tomato (halved grape tomatoes are nice in it), or even shredded carrot, a little cabbage, some cauliflower or broccoli, whatever. I typically don't cook the zuchhini first, but that's just my preference. I'm sure there are a million small changes that others might like as well. Bottom line: this is good stuff. Thank you for sharing!

just read this recipe this morning and immediately made it for breakfast!  I added a little hot sauce and fresh sliced tomato over the top, it is very good! (eating right now!)  :)
