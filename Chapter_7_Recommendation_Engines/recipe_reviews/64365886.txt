Although I am the submitter of this recipe, I don't eat sausage. I got this recipe from my "uncle" (by marriage) in Sicily and posted it when someone asked how to make homemade sausage. But I posted this recipe knowing I would never try it. At least I thought so. I ended up making some the other day  and can't tell you how good this is. I don't like sausage because it is so greasy, not this recipe. I used half veal/ half pork.  Not only is it not greasy, it has an exceptional flavour and texture as well. I used a dry Sicilian wine and feel this was important. I didn't stuff it in casings, instead using it loose in a recipe. The outcome was a flavourful, lean sausage. I may just start eating it more often. :-)
