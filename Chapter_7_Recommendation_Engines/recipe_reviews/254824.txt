I did not care too much for this soup. I found it bland (with a hint of thyme). I would make sure to use a really flavorful bouillon, maybe use more potatoes, and less corn.

Used butter instead of Gee, and used extra garlic because allergic to onions. I Did not freeze ahead but cooked it on the stove and it was great.
