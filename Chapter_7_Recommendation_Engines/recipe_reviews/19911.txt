We really enjoyed this recipe!  I made two small changes though because it's what I had. 1)I poached 3 large chicken breasts in chicken broth and then chopped them up for the recipe and 2) I used one can of Cream of Chicken soup and one can of Cream of Celery soup.  I think it turned out great.  It's even better the next day.

This was pretty darn tasty. I prefer fresh chicken, so I stewed 4 large breasts and cut them up instead. I also added extra cheese and extra ritz crackers on top. My husband loved it. It was really interesting because the noodles didn't seem like noodles, yet they provided a nice, starchy texture like what you'd expect in a casserole like this. I wonder what potatoes would be like? I would even consider leaving the chicken out next time and serving as a side dish. Also, as weird as it may sound to others, I think this would be absolutely delightful with green peas mixed in, so I may try that. I'll definitely be making this again.

IMPORTANT: Hi I am the original poster. I lost my original account due to marrying and changing my old email. :( If you like spicy try my "different chicken divan" with rice and use 1 TBS Curry only.  For this recipe, I said use a LG sour cream. In my mind that is the Mayfields LG container. So if you don't use that size, it will be dryer. The Large container of Sour Cream mentioned means Mayfield's brand Large. It is 1 lb 8 oz. (or 680G)  Now I have to buy more SCs to make it as big as Mayfields brand, which is not available in my current area. Hope this helps! It IS super creamy! Anyone who did not like it either did it wrong or just didn't like it. I always use SWEET ONIONS. I never precook noodles as it makes mush. I do cover it for the first half of cooking, did I remember to say that??? It was a few yrs ago that I posted this. This has great flavour if done correctly. People will fight over who ate the last bowl!

I have this casserole cooking in the oven as i sit here and type. I couldnt figure out if it was one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom.....or 2 cans of each. Now i wish i would have cooked my noodles first. I'm nervous! We'll see how it turns out!

I made two 9x13 pans because I feed nine people, but expect leftovers.  There was none left!!! I did add some jalapeno and cheddar chips to the topping and it gave it a bit of spice. I also used shredded chicken instead of canned. My boys loved it and were even scraping the casserole dish.   This will definitely be served again.

REALLY REALLY good! I predict this one to eventually be in the hall of fame.  My husband, who is the pickiest eater in the world (hasn't liked any of the recipes from this site in 2 years), really liked this one.  It is simple, and I cut the fat and calories by using reduced fat versions of the ingredients.  Thanks for a keeper recipe!!

Man, was this good!  I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey and everyone raved.  I was concerned that the noodles wouldn't cook since the only "liquid" in the recipe was the sour cream and cans of condensed soup.  But they cooked up fine.  Thanks for the great recipe, Lisa.

When I make this recipe, I reduce the butter and onion to only a few TBS each and cut the cheddar back to 2 cups and I love it!  Such great comfort food.  Also, I prefer using non-canned chicken for this.

I also sauteed the diced, boneless chicken breast in the onion, and added some fresh minced garlic as well.  Its delicious, and a definate stick to the ribs, rainy evening meal.  Next time I think I'll add some crispy little fried onions to the cracker/cheese topping.

Loved the dish will cook again, also the noodles was good just like it said. and it is 1 can of each for the ones that couldn't decide. Will cook this again and it is in my faviotes.

Love this recipe but made a few tweeks also.... I decided to cook my noodles, used fresh chicken breasts instead, which I seasoned with onion and garlic while it  cooked, I also added small early peas and instead of using the crackers, I melted some butter and added italian bread crumbs and poured that over the top for the last 10 mins. of cooking.  Yummy!!

I like this casserole a lot.  I used 1-1/2 lbs chicken tenders that I boiled until done and cut into chunks.  I also used homemade cream of chicken soup.  Result was very tasty. The noodles near the edge of the pan didn't cook all the way....so next time I might add a bit of milk to make more sauce.....but my whole family and guests liked it anyways.

I really liked this dish I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I mixed some of my onions in wth the chicken mixture, and I added extra cheese.  I think next time I will add a splash of milk.  Like many other reviews I was concerned about not cooking the noodles but the turned out pretty good.  They were much harder around the edges and I think the milk will help with that next time....This made the best leftovers.  On day two all the flavors had melted together......revied review: this has become a regular meal in our house but we found we prefer the noodles cooked first it makes for a much creamier dish.  We have tried it as described, adding milk and precooking the noodles(very aldente) and precooked is the best

Adding 3/4 cup of frozen peas and substituting crackers for Reduced Fat White Cheddar Cheez-its on top was a tremendous success!  I've also tried crumbling potato chips on top which is also tasty, but not if you're planning on having leftovers as the chips are sadly soggy by the next day.

Pretty good but I found two exceptions to the original recipe.  1) DO NOT use low fat sour cream - it separates when cooking and the presentation is bad. 2) Make sure all of the noodles are covered.  I did not and had crispy, uncooked noodles around the edges.  Had I known of these two problems I would have had a better dish.  But overall it was pretty darn good.  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this recipe and all I can say is OH WOW!! It was amazing! I made it exactly to the recipe and my family gobbled it down. It's very filling, so it made plenty for our family of 3. I just can't say enough...it's so good! Definitely something I will make again and again. Thanks Lisa for such a wonderful recipe!

Great dish! I didn't add the crackers or mushrooms because I didn't have them on hand. I added a small bag of mixed vegetables, 1/2 cup of can milk and 1/4 cup of water; Seasoned to taste. Some family love it and others thought it was ok. It smell so good cooking!

I made it a bit differently, I only put in 2 cups of shredded cheese, Cabot extra sharp to be precise. Then i added mushrooms, broccoli and celery. I also found it to be a bit bland, so i spiced it up with sea salt, black pepper, white pepper and garlic.

This was excellent!  It also smelled terrific while it was baking... I was a little skeptical about baking the uncooked noodles, but they turned out just fine.  However, I put the last bit of cheese on top of the crackers and it was crunchy... next time I will put it under the crackers to avoid this.

I made this tonight and my hubby and I LOVED it! There's only two of us, so I halved the recipe so we have lots of leftovers. The only changes I made were to use fat free cream of chix soup and fat free cream of mushr. soup. I used whole wheat pasta. I also used more than 2 oz of crackers and I mixed them with melted margarine and the cheese, and spead it on top. I had to bake it for about 40 minutes. It was amazing though! I will def make this over and over aain! Thanks for such a great, easy and quick dinner!

The top section of this casserole was good.  Very tasty with the noodles, chicken, cheese and toasted crackers.  But it was WAY too creamy... sour CREAM, CREAM of mushroom, CREAM of chicken!  Overall it is good, couldn't eat too much of it because it was so filling.  Will definitely make again.. just need something sweet or spicy to break up the CREAM!  (I used RITZ for the crackers and low fat everything else)

This was very yummy!! I only made a few changes. Instead of using dry noodles, I used 16oz of frozen Reames noodles. Next time I will add more noodles. I used one can of each: cream of celery, cream of chicken, and cream of mushroom. I also added 1/2 cup milk to the soup. I used 8oz shredded of the following:sharp cheddar, mild cheddar, and monterey jack cheese and 4 oz of pepper jack. I used 1 1/2 TBS Black Pepper, 1 TBS Marjoram, 1 TBS Basil, and 2 tsp lawrys seasoning salt. When I was frying the onion, I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and one of the cans of chicken with juice. I opted for french's onions on top. I found that if you let it sit for 5-10 minutes when it comes out of the oven that it thickens up. I will definitely make this again. I will try adding peas or broccoli next time. Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

This was good....but way too much cheese.  Would use 1/2 or less.  I used 2 breasts and 2 legs and thighs. Boiled them and shredded.  I am not sure how canned chicken would be.

Great recipe!! Only added about 1/4 of an onion. Added peas & some jalopeno juice. Next time I will cook the noodles on the stove top and use a differnt type of noodle. The egg noodle came out a bit pastie. Flavor was great!!!

Instead of using 3 (10 ounce) cans of chicken chunks I used a few frozen chicken breasts which I cut up and cooked.  I was concerned how the noodles would get soft, because it didn't seem like there was enough moisture in the casserole when I put it in the oven, but the noodles softened and it was quite yummy.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Although I did think it was almost too creamy, like it maybe needed a little water.  Mine was more chunky looking than the picture.  Overall, though, very yummy dish.

Did not really like this dish at all. The noodles didn't cook all the way and the flavor was bland. My kids liked it other than there was too many onions. Bottom line - waste of calories.

My family loves this dish!  Not being a fan of mushy canned chicken I chose to use fresh chicken instead.  I also eliminated the butter and added a few sliced mushrooms

Good tasting casserole, but the noodles weren't cooked all the way.  When making it, I noticed that there wasn't enough liquid to cook the noodles, so I added an extra can of cream of chicken and water.  Still, some of them are too crunchy.  I think the amount of noodles should be decreased (maybe 6 oz instead of 8), and the cooking time should be increased to 40-45 minutes.  Either that, or boil the noodles first.    Otherwise, I used boiled and shredded chicken breast, added red bell pepper to the onion, and omitted the cheese entirely.  Husband likes it a lot and I'm sure I will too once I get the noodle situation fixed.  Thanks!
UPDATE 6/7: Made this again and boiled the noodles first, used two cans cream of chicken/8oz light sour cream, a little milk, and I added the cheese this time as well as some poppy seeds.  Very good, and the noodles were soft this time.  Even reheated in the microwave, it's rich and creamy.

This was a very easy and quick dish.  My family really enjoyed t. Theonly thing different I would do is only use 2 cups cheese not 3.  I love cheese and that just seemed to be a bit much.

Bland. Bland, bland, bland. I wish I'd added more than just pepper. We all ate it but we didn't really enjoy it. I think with an extra sharp cheddar, some spices and elbow macaroni, this would be better. I probably won't make this again.

This had great flavor, easy to make. I used cream of chicken soup and chopped up some mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions, cubed up 1 chicken breast and sauteed it with garlic, added 1 1/4 c. milk, almost doubled the cheese, and used french fried onions on top instead of crushed crackers. Very tasty, will make this again.

Would never make again. It sounded very good but ending up not tasting good at all to me or my husband. I followed the recipe to the tee, If I did like it i would at least cook the noodles for a couple of minutes before mixing together. Just an FYI for someone else if interesting in trying.

OMG! this was so delicious. I followed some of the original poster Lisa A's suggestions. I didn't use the curry but I did use the 1.8 lb sour cream. I used the light Daisy because I love it more than the others. I also added a can of celery soup, 2 stalks of thinly sliced creepy, used 2 cups shredded cheese & didn't use any on top. This made the casserole super creamy. As I speak we are having it for lunch. It was just as creamy as yesterday. The noodles were not dry at all.

Super easy, really comforting dinner. I only used two cans chicken to save money and it was just fine and flavorful. At the last second I realized someone had eaten the Ritz crackers so I used French's Fried onions on top instead. It was a great substitution. This is a delicious basic recipe that you could really have fun with creating variations. Love it!

UPDATE - I have now made this recipe about 20 times in the past two years and  I still love it... only thing I don't do is put the cheese on the top, I do mix two cups with the chicken mixture and that makes it cheesy enough.. 
_________________________________________
Made this over the weekend and it was as hit.  My one year old and I ate it for lunch and dinner and she loved it (which is something that you barely say with a 1 year old).  The only adjustments I made was using fat free cheese which did not melt on the top but melted in the casserole.  I used fat free sour cream, lower sodium soups and reduced fat Ritz and used wheat egg noodles.  I tried to make it as WW friendly as I could and it was still so amazing and creamy that I cant even imagine how GOOD the original recipe must be.  Sad to say that I will be making it again tonight to eat for lunch the rest of the week as the leftovers are even better.. YUM YUM

I gave this recipe four stars because I did not follow it to a T, but it was still great. What I did was first scale down the recipe, I used a half can of cream of mushroom and a whole can of cream of chicken. I only used 1 can of canned chicken and a half bag of noodles.  What I did was cook the noodles for no more then 5 minutes, cooked the onion until softned. While the noodles where cooling, mixed the soup, onion, cheese, milk and seasons (season all, lemon pepper, onion powder, garlic power and a pinch of red pepper flakes). I mixed everything together and poured in the milk slowly. I did not use alot, but enough to make the mixture creamy. I then added the noodles mixed everything together and placed in a casserole dish. I used fried onions on top since that's all I had. Baked it for 30 mintues and it came out creamy. I did not use sour cream as I did not have it and felt I did not need it.

This was very good!  The changes I made were I used roasted chicken from the store, lite sour cream, cheese, soup and whole wheat egg noodles.  I also used Italian bread crumbs for the topping.   I tried to reduce the calories a little bit.  Everyone liked it will make it again.

I used 9x13 ceramic dish.  Dried out the noodles. The dish kept cooking after I took it out of the oven. Use a metal pan and use a smaller size so the noodle are not spread as thin across the bottom.

This is one of those comfort foods you love to eat on a cold snowy day. I used fresh chicken that I stewed with 1/2 of the onion and 2 cans of chicken broth. I then made my own sauce with the juices from the chicken. Instead of the buttery round crackers I used Pepperidge Farm Corn bread stuffing. It is absolutely delicious!

This is a GREAT recipe! I used macaroni and a combination of canned chicken and frozen, grilled chicken. I also added a can of peas and seasoned with Lawry's. Great homestyle cooking, very rich and creamy. Will definitely make this again, incorporating mixed vegetables and mushrooms. Thanks for this recipe!!

This was very yummy.  I made a few modifications.  First I sauteed the chicken in the butter and onion after the onion had softened.  I added all the ingredients, except the noodles and crackers to the chicken and onion mixture and warmed on the stove while thoroughly mixing. I also added some frozen peas and carrots, paprika,garlic powder, and salt and pepper. Then I added the noodles, cooked al dente first.  I crumbled the crackers on top and warmed in the oven for 15 minutes.  This kept the casserole very moist.  So I made more than a few modifications, but the base recipe was a great help.  I served 8 adults and 6 young children from one 9x13 pan.  We also had salad and bread and all made for a very good meal.

great comfort food. i use cream of chicken & cream of celery soups. many times in making this, i found that the top noodles don't really get cooked all the way - they get kind of crunchy. you can cook the noodles beforehand and just put this in the oven long enough to warm the dish/melt the cheese.

This was SOOOOO good. I used fat free sour cream, and healthy request soup, and it was  fantastic. Instead of buttery crackers, I topped it with canned fried onions. So tasty!

This is super easy.  I used the canned chicken and omitted the onion, so it only took maybe 5 minutes to open the ingredients and mix it up. The canned chicken was just fine if you're ok with that.  I added a little minced onion to maybe make up for the cooked onion, and used cream of chicken with herbs soup.  I also left off the crackers on top and it was just fine being just cheesy.  It is really creamy and salty, but it's not billed as a healthy meal.  I would like it with even more noodles.  My noodles cooked fine, but I did add some broth to make sure.  If you cooked the noodles first, you could add more and make the casserole stretch even further.  I give it 4 stars b/c it's so easy, but we enjoyed it, too.

When your family is fighting over the leftovers, you know it's a great meal.  You can make tweaks to this recipe depending upon what you have on hand, but it's a winner every time!  Everyone loves it, and I've shared the recipe with others and they've raved, too!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was so yummy and very easy to make. I substittited 6 baked chicken thighs that I seasoned with Mcormicks mesquite chicken and a little lemon pepper. Using canned chicken just did not appeal to me. Also, I added about 1/2 cup chicken broth because I was afraid the noodles wouldn't cook enough. I also substituted the egg noodles for multi colored rotini noodles and it was excellent. I only used 1/2 onion (sweet yellow, added about 1 tsp of freshly minced garlic and this recipe was nothing short of PERFECTION. Thanks, it was an instant hit and I will be adding it to my favorite recipe collection. YUM!!!!!!!

This recipe has become a new favorite.  I add one soup can of water to reduce the richness, and it's perfect.  My roommate and I nearly licked the casserole dish clean!  It's so good!

It is ridiculous how good this is. I made this last night and it was very well recieved. I thought it was perfect, but some might want to go easier on the cheese. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very very good.  I added a couple things - in fact I have decided to turn it into my own recipe - which I have now submitted - hopefully it will be accepted soon :)
It's called Fiesta Chicken Noodle Casserole.
Thank you so much Lisa for your great recipe "starter".

Would give this a 3.5 rating if I could. It was OK. No one really cared about it. Kind of bland even though I added fresh cracked black pepper and nutmeg.

Very good.  I didn't have cans of chunk chicken, but had boneless chicken breasts that I cut up and cooked ahead of time.  I precooked the noodles also.

This recipe was so good! So creamy, but the crackers gave it some crunch. I added about a teaspoon of minced garlic to the onion mix and added some jalepeno potato chips to the cracker topping for some kick. Destined to be a must-have in our house!

This was great. I made one change only because my bag of noodles was 12oz, so I added a can of cream of celery soup to the other two.  If I were to make this again, I would drop the 2 cups of cheese you mix in to one cup and maybe decrease the sour cream to 8oz and add 8oz milk as this was super creamy/rich. Even though it tasted great, I will probably add a little pepper or Cavender’s seasoning to it next time to up the flavor.  Two things that pleasantly surprised me: 1. I don’t use canned chicken but wanted to follow the recipe and it was good! 2. I didn’t think onions on the bottom would work, but it did! Hubby went back for seconds!

Is this the most nutritious dish you’ve ever eaten? No.... but if you need something fast and easy for a team pasta dinner, this is the way to go. Extremely kid/teen friendly. What’s not to like, cheese, noodles, ritz crackers and butter??? Easy prep, fast cooking, crowd pleasing.

I was looking for a quick casserole to make for a neighbor recovering from surgery.

I didn't have any canned chicken but I did have some chicken hindquarters I had smoked the day before.  I cleaned and chopped 3 cups of thigh and drumstick meat.

Also I substituted Mexican blend cheese for the cheddar and topped with French fried onions.

The neighbor gave it rave reviews as did my wife.  It will be on our menu again.

This was a good and easy thing to make. The only change I would make would be to use a roasted chicken as a meat source.  Thanks to the original poster.

I've made this twice.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  For the most part, my family liked it, but we felt it needed a little extra umph.  So, the second time I made it, I made a few changes:  I used 1 can of cream of celery soup & 1 can of cream of chicken.  I sauteed  onions & added some sliced celery, cooking until soft & then added some sliced fresh mushrooms.  I only had 1 c. of sour cream on hand so I added an additional 3/4 c. whole milk to add more moisture to cook the noodles.  I also added an undrained small can of diced green chilies. I followed  the suggestion about covering it for the first half of baking, but when I took it out of the oven to remove the foil after 15 min, it was still cold in spots & I knew baking it another 15 min would not be nearly long enough.  I turned the heat up to between 375 & 400 & baked it another 20 min.  I then removed it from the oven & sprinkled the top with crushed Ritz crackers.  I returned it to the oven & baked it (uncovered) another 20 min....so, almost an entire hour baking in all.  I was worried the uncooked noodles would be a problem, but they turned out perfect.  I also added some frozen peas & used some frozen left-over chicken from another meal.  The dish was incredibly creamy - absolutely luscious!

I made this recipe last night and it was good. Since there are only two of us I changed the recipe a little for smaller portions and that is where I probably caused my problem... It was a little dry and too much cheese...I will make it again because I liked it but, I think I will use less cheese and another can of cream of chicken soup... It was simple and easy to fix and that is my one requirement anything else I can work around... I do have a question though. The original recipe call for 2 cans of cream of chicken and mushroom soup.  Did you mean 1 can of each or is it sold together? Thanks for the recipe..

This was a great base recipe. I did make a few little tweaks and it turned out AWESOME!! I dont eat canned meat so I used boneless skinnless chicken breast that I had cooked in the Crock Pot with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and chicken stock. Once done I chopped the chicked and used this instead of canned. I also used 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom (Cream of Chicken has that weird canned meat yuck), aged white cheddar cheese and chopped cooked applewood smoked bacon!  I did follow the recipe regarding the sour cream and onions but I topped it with Panko instead of the crackers for more crunch. My kids LOVED it and it was just as good the next day for leftovers.

I used this recipe to make my first casserole EVER, so I was a little nervous, but it turned out GREAT. I did tweak a few things, however: I used a fresh roasted chicken, I added some chopped celery and I cooked the noodles about halfway beforehand, because many people said the noodles might be too dry. I made it for family dinner with the in-laws and it was a hit! I will definitely be making this again. The only thing I'll probably do different next time is mix the onion in with everything else, rather than just letting them sit on the bottom of the pan. Thank you!

I didn't care for this at all.  Maybe it was the overly creamy soup mixture, or the pastiness of the egg noodles (maybe try to cook beforehand?)  Either way, I won't be making again.

This recipe was surprisingly a lot better than I thought it was going to turn out.  I was a little confused when reading the recipe it states use 2 cans of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom.. I was unsure if it meant 2 cans of each or just 1.  I ended up using 1 can of each and I was a little scared after mixing it together with the noodles that it wouldn't be enough "juice" to cook the noodles.  I ended up adding about 1/2 cup of milk for good measure and it turned out perfect!  In fact it was even better the next day.  This recipe makes A LOT so if you aren't making it for a big crowd expect a lot of leftovers!  My husband LOVED it.  He said it was the best chicken casserole he has ever had.  We will absolutely be making it again!

I hate to be negative, but this was barely even edible.  The sauce tasted horrible... The only reason we were able to eat it was because we were literally starving before dinner.   DEFINITELY NOT a keeper, sorry :-(

MMMMMMMMM:) I did make a few minor adjustments.  I added celery and water chestnuts for texture and used Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper to taste.  I also boiled and shredded 3 chicken breasts instead of using canned chicken and I used sharp cheddar cheese...extra sharp would be tasty as well. Enjoy! :)

I used:  fresh chicken breast cut, cooked with onions and seasoned with paprika.  Used 3 cans of soup and one can of milk.  Used more noodles crushed (12 oz.).  I baked covered for 30 minutes then uncovered, added crackers and cheese and baked 10 more minutes.

This was FANTASTIC!  I reduced the sour cream (because I didn't have enough), and used a mexican blend of cheeses (that's what I had in the fridge), and it still turned out great!  I think I'll add a little milk next time, to make it a little more creamy.  Thanks for sharing this recipie!!

We loved this recipe!  This is a good way to use up leftover chicken.  I added some cut up celery to the onion and sauteed it, then added some chicken boullion.   It helped to make it more moist.   Also, the best thing about this was the addition of sour cream.   Makes it creamier and moist mixture.  Will keep this recipe as one of our favorites!

Very tasty and easy! Instead of bland canned chicken I used a pre-roasted and seasoned chicken from the grocery store. Needed to bake an extra 15 minutes so the noodles were completely cooked. Make sure you cover all the noodles with the sauce otherwise they'll be crunchy.

***1/2 stars actually.  Couldn't decide if this was a 3 or 4.  My husband said it was a three.  For the record, I used 4 poached chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken.  I cooked the noodles for 3 minutes because I was afraid to put them in uncooked. I used low fat soup and sour cream. I used 1 can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken.  It tasted good just not anything spectacular.  I would take this to a pot luck because I think most people would like it.  It's just so rich cream soups, sour cream, butter, butter crackers, cheese.

Too much sour cream!! Next time I will half the amount and maybe use cream cheese with chives instead. Also, french fried onions worked much better as a topper! Ritz crackers were boring and mushy. Honestly, no one liked it.

I have made this twice now and it is becoming one of my husbands favorites.  I use boiled chicken breasts and a can of cream of chicken w/ mushroom and a about 3/4 can of the broth from boiling my chicken and it comes out perfect everytime.  I don't use the cream of mushroom soup at all.  Really good stuff!!!

This is a WONDERFUL casserole! I changed a few things in my version to make it a bit more 'homemade'. I do not like to use canned soups so instead I made a rou (sp?) and added chicken flavoring to it. It really gave it a "cooked all day" taste. Delicious!

We were very pleased with this recipe.  I used boiled/chopped chicken breasts and boiled the noodles for about 3 mins before mixing into the casserole.  Next time I will also add about 1/2 cup of chicken broth to it also, as my husband (who really liked it) said it was a bit to thick for his taste.  Also, I halved the recipe for our family of 4 and we had leftovers which were eaten for lunch with no complaints!

I halved the recipe and had to use penne pasta instead of egg noodles, substituted cheddar cheese soup in placed of shredded, eliminated celery soup. I secretly added a can of tuna (besides the chicken) for the omega 3's!  I was worried about this being dry so I made a small amount of roux (1/2c. milk and 2 tbls. flour)  to add moisture.  For the crackers I used keebler club snack sticks.  My daughter and I ate half of it before the guys got home!  Will make again.

Yum! This was super easy and it was very yummy. I was a little concerned when it stated to add the uncooked noodles but the noodles came out soft and tender! Thanks for the recipe, its a keeper.

I really love this recipe, but added some changes:  I used boneless, skinless chicken beast (2) that I browned and then chunked up. And for a little more texture, I added a drained can of water chestnuts.  Perfection!

Excellent and super easy. I use store bought rotissere chicken instead of the chicken chunks and it turned out great. I double the recipe for my family of 6, have made it several times and there is never any left. Perfect for a homemade meal with very little work.

I thought the onion was a little overpowering. I added garlic and crushed black pepper. I think it's missing something, kind of bland. Instead of using butter crackers for the topping, I used crushed up foccacia crutons. they added a lot of flavor, and I wished I had put a layer of them in the middle.

Not enough chicken combined with too much cheese.

If I made it again, I would add more chicken and cut the cheese in half, if that.

Great recipe! I've done a few versions, sometimes with canned chicken,  sometimes rotisserie.  I've also adapted it for my slow cooker, which is really convenient for potlucks. I always stir in a 12 oz package of mixed vegetables before pouring the mixture into the pan or crock.

I made this last night and this turned out really tasty. First, I read through most of the reviews and then I tweeted the recipe based on other reviews. This is how I prepared this dish.  I used 12 ounces of bow tie pasta, 1/2 can cream of chicken, 2can cream of mushroom, 2 Cups Tyson Grilled Ready Diced Frozen Chicken, used Onion Powder instead of the onion, and decreased the amount of cheese to 2Cups. I sautéed the diced chicken breasts in a small amount of olive oil along with 1/8 tsp of minced garlic, and seasoned with Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Cayenne Pepper and Pepper. Then prepared the rest according to the recipe, I did mix the 2C of cheese in the soup chicken mixture. I added 1/2C evaporated milk and 1/4C water to the mixture. I cooked for 20 minutes with the crushed crackers and butter. Removed from oven and added 1/4C crushed crackers with 1/2C crushed French Onions and baked the remainder 25 minutes. Turned out so tasty, we had leftovers tonight and it tasted even more awesome. Definitely making this one again.

Made this recipe as written wth the exception of cream of celery in place of the mushroom soup and 3 large chicken breasts cooked and chopped.  The noodles cooked perfectly.   It was so easy I let my grandson make it by himself.  I was actually shocked how good it tasted!  Not only did I like it but so did my 4 extremely picky grandchildren.  That is a win, win in our family.  We served it with a nice salad, peas and cranberries.  Happy kids happy dinner.  I will definitely make this again.

This is the second time I made this.  This time I used 4 poached chicken breast vs the can.  I needed more sauce and was out of soup and sour cream so I used half a jar of Ravi garlic Alfredo sauce. It gave it a nice garlicy  kick

Everyone liked it.  We cut the recipe in half and still had left overs.  Mix the onions into the mix as opposed to layering them on the bottom.

This recipe is what I think of when I think "comfort food." I use a rotisserie chicken, not the canned. Depending on who is eating I can tailor this recipe, but I think my favorite is to saute mushrooms and celery and add it. I am not a fan of onions, but I used minced dry onion and garlic as I mix up the casserole -- we get the flavor without the big chunks of onion.
   Don't worry about the noodles being uncooked -- cover the casserole for 30 minutes and they will cook. I uncover the pan and leave it in the oven for an additional 10 minutes to get a nice crunch on the cracker topping.

This tasted good. I added a small amount of chicken broth, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Definitely needs some texture. Next time I think I will add frozen peas or other vegetables. Maybe a crunchier topping.

Made this for a pot luck, it seemed to go over well, there was none left to bring home.  It was very good and the only thing I did different was substitute 3 cubed cooked chicken breasts for the canned. It was easy and delicious.

My 8-year-old daughter just said, "This is fantastic, mom," while she was gobbling it up.   I have picky eaters and they loved it.  Personally, I thought it was fantastic too, but I would add in some broccoli, tomatoes, and other veges.  I was worried about the noodles being completely cooked, but they were perfect and not mushy.   I used two cans of cream of chicken, only because that was all I had.  And, yes, two cans of cream of whatever is the right amount for those of you who weren't sure about how many cans.  Definitely a keeper for my family.  Oh. I did cook fresh chicken chunks with the onion.   Not a fan of the canned stuff.

This was really good. I added some sharp cheddar as well in place of some of the mild. I am going to try adding some broccoli or peas next time. Definitely going to make again.

We enjoyed this! Just used regular chicken boneless breast in the package not canned because I never use canned chicken. Left out the onion and used onion powder for my picky husband. I boiled the chicken breast and noodles before al dente and shredded the chicken and mixed it all up and baked it in the oven. I'm always never sure if the noodles and chicken will be cooked through all the way in 30 minutes so, I like to boil them first. Also topped with cheese and italian bread crumbs since I had no crackers.  Came out great!! I imagine you can throw in whatever veggies  or other stuff you want. Thanks.

This was sooo good and made so much.  I could've eaten the whole thing in one sitting.  Super yummy.  We used onion flakes instead of a real onion.

Super creamy but too heavy on heavy on the sour cream in my opinion.  Would try this again but would cut the sour cream in half and add a can of cream of mushroom or chicken.

This is the type of chicken noodle casserole that come to mind. Exactly what I was looking for.  Next time I will use an extra large bowl to mix it!

I liked the flavor and my kids did too. However, it either needs more liquid in the sauce or the noodles need to be par-boiled first. I cooked it for 45 minutes and the noodles were still grainy.

I made this for supper tonight and it was delicious. I didn't use canned chicken but boiled chicken with celery and carrotts and spices. I also had the recipe reduced to 4 portions and having that feature saves me a lot of math. I will definitely cook this again.

Been making this for a while now. Thought I would add my adjustments. I always make double or triple the amount so I will swap out one can of mushroom for a can of cream of celery. I use french fried onions on top instead of crackers or browning onions. And I add a can of peas to the chicken/soup mixture. My family of 6 loves it.

I give it a 3 because I used cream of chicken and cream of celery.  I would give a 2, but since I didn't follow exactly, I gave it another star.  It wasn't very good, the cream of celery was really what gave it taste.  I cooked covered for about 35-40 minutes and then uncovered for about 15 minutes.  Pretty easy to make, but not much taste.  Kids liked it though, thank you!!

It is a good base recipie.  The canned chicken is a little off putting to me so I used 3 real chicken breasts and boiled them with some salt and olive oil. I added 1/4 cup of peas and 5 stalks of celery (sliced) and some salt and pepper. Next time I am going to scale back on the sour cream as the 1 pt is too much. I also cooked the noodles before I baked in the oven.

This was certainly very easy.  Some reviewers seemed to have a concern about the soup.  You need a total of 2 cans of soup.  Each one is Campbell's Cream of Chicken & Mushroom condensed soup.  I put the onions in the bottom of the casserole and layered the noodles next.  Mixed the wet ingredients and put them over the noodles and finished the rest of the recipe.  I wanted to make sure the noodles were covered.  I was surprised the noodles cooked and were tender.

Soooo good! I made a few changes to the basic recipe. I only had cream of celery and cream of mushroom, so I used those. I grilled 2 chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken. I also didn't add more cheese on top, there was enough in the mixture. I substituted french fried onions for the crackers. Also I added broccoli-which is a must for my family! Very yummy!

I make this all the time but usually I cook everything separately and then put the chicken mixture on top of the egg noodles. Both ways are really good. I also only used cream of chicken soup.

We really liked this.  A LOT.  I did use some suggestions though.  I halved the recipe...used left over chicken breast....added frozen mixed vegetables, lawrey's season salt and minced dry onion instead of fresh.  I had to bake mine for about 45 - 50 minutes.  Delish.

This was excellent.  I sauted diced raw chicken breast (4 boneless, skinless breasts) in butter and extra virgin olive oil with some garlic powder.  I used two cans of cream of chicken soup (little unsure of this as the directions were not real clear) and I accidently put all three cups of shredded cheddar into the mix.  I then sprinkled just about a half cup of shredded cheddar over the top.  It came out perfect in 30 minutes with a crunchy cracker topping.  Will definitely make it again.  Great idea for a potluck!

This was very good and easy to make!  I was a little confused by the recipe and wasn't sure if I should add 1 can each of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom (to make 2 cans) or to add 2 of each...I finally decided on 2 of each.  I also used a little more cheese than called for, and just dumped in a full 12 oz. bag of whole wheat egg noodles.  I used light sour cream, soup, crackers, and cheese, and omitted the butter (using butter-flavored cooking spray) when cooking the onions.  My boyfriend and I thought it was very tasty, and I'll definitely make it again!

Very good!  I added garlic and about 1/2 milk.  At the suggestion of others, I also added carrots, peas and celery.  My best friend stopped on her way home and she tried it and loved it.  (Did I mention she HATES celery)  Even with the celery she thought it was wonderful.  I was worried about the noodles, but they cooked wonderfully.  This recipe will be a staple in our house

This was really good, but I think it needed more noodles and more chicken.  Also, you don't need to saute the onion first.

OMG!!!! A very tasty recipe. I made this dish one night for a pot luck and i didn't get one bite. So i made it the next night for my family and found out why i it was gone so quick the night before!! I left the recipe the same except i used 3-4 chicken breast. I just boiled them and chopped them up. I like breast better than can. Though the canned chicken is nice and quick.

Good recipe, but feel it needs something.  I used boneless chicken breasts instead of canned, and cream of chicken with herbs soup.  I added minced garlic to the onion while it was cooking.  It was just ok for me.  I think with some added spices it would be better.

This recipe is very good but I did make some changes.  I used 3 frozen chicken breasts and boiled them with chicken bouillon cubes, then cubed the chicken.  I cooked the onion in some olive oil and added it into the rest of the mixture.  If you are confused about how much canned soup to use...definitely use 4 if making the full recipe.  I used 1 can of low fat/low sodium cream of chicken and 1 regular and 1 can low fat/low sodium cream of celery and 1 regular (my husband hates mushrooms).  I used low fat sour cream and also added a can of sliced water chestnuts for some crunch.  I also filled one of the empty cans with milk and stirred that in so it wasn't quite so "thick."  I was kinda worried about not cooking the noodles first, but they were just fine.  Fairly easy and have enough leftovers for days.  Will make again

This was good, but I plan some modifications next time.  I used real chicken and added a small amount of milk to the mix.  The noodles were soft all the way through.  I think I'll try different soups, perhaps cream of celery.  I'm curious if 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken would do the trick as the cream of "chicken and mushroom" seems expensive!  My 3 year old not thrilled with this dish.

So easy & so yummy!  My mother in law and I (who love casserole's) loved it, but my husband did not.  I used minced onion from the bottle rather than cooking real in butter.  I just mixed it in with everything & it was faster and very tasty!  Used a little less than 1 cup of cheese on top, used Ritz crackers crumbled up & only used 2 large cans of Swanson's white chunck chicken. Can't wait for leftovers at lunch today!  This one's a keeper!

The first casserole that all 5 members of my family loved without me changing anything!!! I did use boiled chicken breast because they are always on sale and much cheaper than canned. It is keeper. My husband wants me to put in some veggies next time like a pot pie. We decided that it could be called Chicken Helper Pie. That is a good thing in my house of 3 teenagers. UPDATE-10-10, I now cook the breast in a cast iron skillet and then cook the onion afterward. I add a can of evap milk and about 3 T of thyme. For a topping, I put down a layer of sliced almonds and then add the crushed Ritz. YUM. My kids fav meal, well except for the one who love Chic Pesto Pasta from this site and Chinese Sesame Sauce on Stir fry veggies with chic. Who needs cookbooks when you have Allrecipes.com?

Very good dish. I ended up adding some minced garlic, shallots, and mushrooms to the onions while cooking. I 1/4 milk to the noodle mixture and I added some french fried onions to the cracker topping. We will make this again, but I will halve the recipe as this make a lot of food. Again, very good!

Could be good with some tweaking, for the most part though, we did not care for it. Also, the recipe does not specify whether you use condensed or regular soup.

This was so easy and my kids loved it. I reduced the serving size to 4 and used one can of cream of celery soup and a large tablespoon of sour cream. My kids don't like onion, so I left those out and just melted butter in the baking dish. Also, I heated the canned chicken and seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper. Perfect!

Made a nice quick dinner. I did cook a couple of breasts in the onion and butter rather than use canned chicken. I alsoadded a tsp. of Worchestershire.

This was super quick to make and I halved the recipe but I had to drastically alter it because I was making it for my 1 yr old. I left out the onion and crackers. I substituted freshly grated Parmesan for the cheddar (because it was moldy!), halved the sour cream and added 1/2 a can of chicken broth because I was nervous about the noodles not cooking.  I also covered it while it baked because I didn't have any cheese to top it with and the noodles were sticking out of the sauce. After 30 mins in the oven, I still found the noodles a bit undercooked. I was short on time so I just stuck a small portion in the microwave for 30 secs and it was much better. Even with the changes, my baby girl loved it and gobbled it all up. I will definitely try the recipe as is the next time but will probably add more broth to help cook the noodles. Thanks!

This was a very good dish. I was actually looking for aside dish for chicken breasts I was preparing. I followed the recipe leaving out the chicken. I chopped zucchini and sauteed with the onion adding pepper and parsley while it cooked. I used a combo of cheddar, monterey jack and mozzerella for the cheese as I had that on hand. Very easy and tasty.

Everyone loved this dish.  I have to say, I was skeptical about all the mixture fitting into a 9x13 dish, so I used a 3 quart casserole dish, and it took an hour to warm all the way through...but that was my fault, not the recipe's.  So, all in all, and excellent quick dinner, that will be added to my weekly recipes.  Thank you.

This is a definite crowd pleaser. I made changes and it is wonderful - better second day even. Definitely a new favorite at our house:  Stewed chicken instead of canned, reduced cheese in half (at least), used about 1/2 pint sour cream, precooked noodles about 3 or 4 minutes, added a can of water.  Sauteed crumbled ritz crackers in butter for topping.  Yummy!!!

This recipes is a good start to an easy,cheap meal. I used Mrs.Dash orginal seasoning to the chicken and was generous with the chili,and pepper. I decided to use cracker crumbs for topping. I melted 1-1/2 Tablespoon of butter, added a 1/4tsp paprika to season cracker crumbs.  a Nice alternative to Tuna.

I thought this was just ok.  It was a little salty for my taste.  It was easy, though.
