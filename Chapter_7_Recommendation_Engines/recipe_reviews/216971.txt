Okay, no way were these done in 20 minutes at 325.  I checked them and they were still very pink.  I put them back in at 350 for another ten minutes.  That was better but they were still a tiny bit pink in the middle. When they were done, I tasted one to see how it was.  Hmmm, okay but the teriyaki was sure a very subtle taste.  I decided that rather than just basting them, I'd make a glaze.  I threw together some teriyaki, a couple tablespoons black raspberry jelly along with some cornstarch and cooked it down a bit (sorry, I don't have exact measurements) until it made up a glaze and threw the meatballs in there.  It decidedly improved the flavor and the teriyaki taste.  Without the glaze and the extra cooking time, this recipe would have been a total loss.  With the glaze, I might make it again.

I make these and serve as a meal with white or fried rice and eggrolls.  Nice alternative to italian meatballs.

This recipe was simple but quite good.  I am going to serve them at my daughter's bridal shower so I had to do a test run.  I added a small additional amount of the teriyaki sauce to the recipe.  It was very good.
