Just made with 4 peaches sitting there on the counter...halved the sugar but stayed with the recipe. Lightly, delicate peachy but extremely good.

I made this just as a breakfast spread and it turned out really well!  I was a bit worried that it wasn't going to thicken, but it definitely thickened really nicely once it cooled and is delicious!!  I only made half of the recipe so I didn't can it as the recipe states because I'm sure it won't last long!

Used 6 small peaches rather than large ones called for in recipe.  Very sweet with the amount of sugar used but I didn't test sweetness of my peaches.  Turned out well and would make again.

This took way longer to thicken than recipe said.  Good, but not great. I added a drop of vanilla cuz I didn't have rose water on hand. Flavor of peach very mild. Next time I'd strain pur√©ed peaches thru cheese cloth...

Great recipe.  My peaches were really sweet so the first batch (using 4 cups of sugar) was a bit too sweet for my taste.  The second batch I used only three cups and like it much better, but it really depends on how sweet the peaches are.  I also thickened the second batch in a pot on direct heat but really watched it closely to prevent any scorching.  This will be a great gift of summer flavor when I give them out during the holidays.

This is so yummy! It was easy, and is a real hit with the family! I will make this again for sure. Made it just like the recipe said.

This curd is DELICIOUS!!! Silky and peachy and delicious. I did have a problem with the double boiler part of the procedure: I stirred it for 30 minutes over the double boiler but it wouldn't thicken, so I transferred it to a regular saucepot and it thickened up quickly. I did not use the rosewater. I estimate that this recipe made about seven 8 oz. jars. (I didn't have enough jars, so I'm not sure.)
