This is so good, I have found the secret to a good flavor is to buy Itallian Pesto, it makes all the difference.  I like to cut the chicken into bite size pieces, I have added broccoli to the chicken as well... yumm!  For those who love shrimp, this is to die for! If you use frozen shrimp, remove tails and be sure to cook the water out, don't over cook as the shrimp will get rubbery!

I fell in love with Pesto after fixing this recipe!  I did leave out the tomatoes because I do not like them hot.  I do think the next time I fix this, I will use the frozen chicken breasts that you buy in a bag because I think they are easier to pound a little flatter.....I think it would be even better then.  The calorie count shown here is not the same as on another recipe site, however.  That one shows 410 per serving..... which makes more sense considering the fattening ingredients.  P.S.  You need to let the chicken stand at least 10 minutes in the covered skillet to let the cheese melt and soak in the sauce.

Montreal seasoning instead of pesto.
Also, doubled the sauce.

We love this recipe!  It is in our regular rotation.  The kids call it green spaghetti & beg for it.  We cut up the chicken in chunks.  To thicken the sauce we use milk instead of water.  Sometimes we add some karo syrup for sweetness but then add a tsp of vinegar to contrast.  My husband is the one who doctors this recipe & does it by taste.  We serve over angel hair pasta.  Such a light refreshing taste compared to the rest of our recipes.

So simple and so yummy!  I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts and doubled the sauce.  I did leave out the tomatoes as we do not eat them.  My hubby (who is extremely picky) enjoyed it as well.

This just wasn't good, perhaps I didn't do something right, but there isn't a whole lot of ways to mess it up.   Perhaps it was the brand of pesto.  The smell alone wasn't appetizing.  I only took one bite and couldn't eat anymore.  My husband, who eats almost anything I make couldn't even finish his.  It just wasn't a good combination.

Followed reviewers recommendations, and doubled the sauce ingredients. Also added broccoli florets, and used milk instead of water. Served with angel hair pasta. This quick, simple dish received rave reviews from everyone in our house!
