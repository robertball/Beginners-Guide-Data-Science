I'm sorry, but these were not so hot. They tasted ok without sprinkles & icing, (A little like "Teddy Grahams") but once the icing was on, they were too hard to counteract the icing. Everyone thought these looked odd being chocolate too. :(

Pretty good flavor--not too chocolatey or cinnamony.  However they were not chewy, but a nice crisp cookie to ice for Christmas or Valentine's Day. Don't put too close together on the cookie sheet though, because they do grow!!!

I think these cookies place a nice spin on chocolate sugar cookies. They're chewy and delicious.

After recently coming across cinnamon M&M's, I decided to make these cookies with them.  They're yummy.  The cinnamon/chocolate flavor is subtle - and I would keep it that way.

The only other thing I did differently was to replace the shortening with butter.  When I did that, I chilled the cookie dough in the fridge for an hour before shaping and baking.

I doubled up on the chocolate and the sugar, but these cookies still were not very chocolatey.  The cinnamon pretty much takes over the flavor, and I wouldn't exactly describe them as "chewy".

However, I still give these cookies a higher rating, because they are quite tasty and they are still a nice change for cut out cookies.  I also varied the recipe and drizzled white chocolate on top.

These did not work out at all. Dough was extremely sticky so I put in the fridge which then hardened too much. They spread waaay too much in the oven. The taste was really lacking and I think the cinnamon overpowered. I had even doubled the chocolate as was suggested by other and it still was not chocolatey

Very good cookies.  Instead of rolling dough out and cutting shapes, I rolled dough into balls and sugared them.  They needed a little more cooking time, but they came out nice and chewy.  Great recipe!

This makes a great simple dough to roll out and cut with cookie cutters.  I didn't have mollases and needed a brown cookie for dog bone shaped cookies.  So this was perfect!  I like the hint of cinnamon and doubled the chocolate as suggested by others. I baked for 10 minutes.  Recipes with shortening will be crispy if you bake too long, so it's better to underbake if you don't want a crispy cookie.    Definitely worth a try!

These cookies were not chewy, but more crunchy like a snap cookie.  We also had trouble rolling them out, so we ended up just rolling them into balls and then rolling them in sugar before baking.  They are a nice change, not too chocolaty.
