This was remniscient of chilly winter saturday afternoons. Although I must say there is no need for BOTH egg noodles AND potatoes (one or the other should do). Additionally, there is no need to first sautee the onion and garlic. Just throwing them in the pot works fine. And don't forget the salt and pepper- I threw in some fresh basil and thyme for extra flavour.

This recipe was so delicious-highly reccommended, especially for the cold season! My family and I loved it. I substituted vegetable broth (for the chicken), and regular noodles for the egg noodles since I'm vegan. Also added in some sun dried tomatoes. You can really use whatever variation of veggies you have in the kitch or what veggies you prefer. Will make this again!

Enjoyed this on a spring cold snap!  I made a double batch--might as well chop a whole cup as half-cup of all these veggies.  I doubled and rounded up everything except the noodles and potato--only added 3oz of twisted egg noodles for the double batch--plenty thick, filled with wonderful veg.flavors.  Lowered the carbs--and cleaned the veggie bin!  Will make again.-Be sure to use fresh veg!THANKS

Very easy to make.  Just cutting up the fresh vegetables takes time, but it's worth it.  I chose to use all organic vegetables and vegetable broth and slow-cooked it with dried chickpeas instead of the white beans.

Delicious and so easy! I didn't change too much, but did add two diced up chicken breasts (browned them first with the onion and garlic) and used low sodium broth. I also cooked the egg noodles seperately and added them to individual bowls. They tend to get too mushy otherwise and do not store as well it you have leftovers. Overall great, easy soup that I will make again!

Really smelled nice while cooking! I added jasmine rice instead of egg noodles as I had none. Needed salt though, but wonderful.

I omitted the egg noodles and used white wine and herb chicken broth.  It changed the flavor some.  It didn't have much substance even though it called for many vegetables.  I might add barley to give more substance next time.

What a great recipe! Simple and delicious. No, you don't have to saute the onion and garlic first, you can just toss then in with all the other veggies, add the broth and simmer away. But . . . it does add a bit of a more complex flavor if you do.
Also, think of this recipe as a basic start. Add the veggies and seasonings you love, mix and match and don't be afraid to toss in some canned tomatoes (you don't even have to drain them first), a variety of beans, etc. Make it your own by putting in what you and your family enjoy and you will love this dish!

I loved it!  I didn't include the noodles and instead I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and it was fantastic!  I will surely make it again.

I just made this for dinner and it was FANTASTIC!!! And it was super easy , I already had  pre chopped broccoli and mushrooms. So that made the prep work go faster! I added everything but the cabbage(just because I didnt have any). oh and I used bouillon cubes and water, just cause thats what I had on hand! This soup is very delicious, I will be making it often!!

Great, veggie-filled soup :) I eye-balled a lot of the veggie portions (ended up doubling some). Definitely will add some spices/seasoning next time to give it that extra kick!

This is a great soup.  I did make my own additions, only because I was originally looking for a beef soup.  First, I doubled the recipe.  I browned one lb. of beef (cubed for stew) in the oil before adding the garlic and onion.  I used low sodium beef broth instead of chicken broth.  Also, I used 2 cups of regular small tube pasta instead of egg noodles.  I didn't add the beans this time.

It was great, a perfect start for what I had in mind.

WOW!  I too sub. chicken broth with vegie and added more corn cause I love corn.  Prep did take a little time but the end result was so good and for me, comming off an 11 day internal cleanse, this was the PERFECT soup to introduce food again to my system!  Will be making again for sure!

Great recipe. My advice is eat healthy. Way too much salt. Cut down by using low-sodium canned products when you can. 1 starch is all you need. Go fresh veggies all the way when you can. There is a lot of spices that you can sub for salt to get a great flavor.

Great, healthy veggie soup. Easy to make, but was a bit bland so I added thyme, basil, tarragon, parsley & it DEF needed some tomato paste! Tasted absolutely delicious after that. I also threw in some chicken wings. Yum & healthy :)

You can't beat a good soup and this is a good soup. If you want to make it just a little more special make your own chicken stock and soak fresh navy beans overnight rather than using canned. Cans are fine at a push (depending on how much BPA you want in your diet)!

I've used this basic recipe for several years, and it is very flexible.  I almost always include a tablespoon of freeze dried herbs - Lighthouse SALAD blend. They market it for salads, but it is perfect for chicken stock types of soup, like chicken noodle.

This soup is awesome. It is also a great one to mix around the ingredients and add/subtract stuff. It's hearty and refreshingly brothy. I made it vegetarian by substituting veggie broth for the chicken.

This is such a basic soup. There really isn't anything wrong with it (other than limited seasoning and an excessive addition of potatoes AND noodles AND beans). Broth and veggies are a base to many soup variations. It's hard to call this anything special. But for some newbie cooks maybe that's a good thing. I would suggest being creative and making many taste adjustments to your own preferences.

This was good.  I substitued califlower for the cabbage as suggested by another user.  I also substituted frozen mixed vegetables for the frozen corn as that is what I had on hand.

Great soup.  I cooked the onion, celery, mushrooms and garlic together.  Then added the rest of vegetables and the broth.  I also added 2 bay leaves for flavor.  Took thebay leaves out and added the noodles and beans.  I left out the potatoes since I used the noodles.  Loved it.  I will use this recipe again!

This came out great! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth but otherwise kept pretty much everything else the same. Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper!

Very good! Added chicken, and lots of black pepper.  Just use whatever veggies you have on hand.

This was a good recipe. I did do some changes though. I did not put cabbage in the soup becasue I dont like the taste of it. I also made my own chicken broth. Other then that it is a great soup!

Very tasty with all the different veggies and I was surprised because there weren't any spices, although I did add a tsp of salt and pepper.  Followed the recipe exactly except I used a chicken carcass for the broth, so there was some chicken in it, and I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some for later. Served with French loaf bread to soak up the juice. Delish.
My wife couldn't figure out why it was called "Spring" Vegetable Soup because most of the veggies are fall varieties here. Thank goodness we have excellent farm markets in Delta BC, that gives us access to fruits and veggies that are out of season!
Will make again!

I LOVE this soup! It is definitely a comfort food on chilly or sick days. I used thin buckwheat noodles instead and I really like how it came out.

Only change I made was substituting whole wheat bow ties for the noodles.  Cooked a little longer, but was a nice healthy swap.  Made a really nice lunch and went together very quickly.  Will definitely make again.

This is a very kid friendly recipe.  Everyone liked it and happily ate.  It is a bit bland.  The recipe makes a lot.  The 4 of us barely made a dent.

I will make again, but is not one of my favorite recipes.

I loved this soup. I didn't have mushrooms or cabbage but used everything else. It is flexible enough that you can use whatever you have on hand. I also added some fresh grated parmesan cheese on top. Excellent. Even my carnevore husband who asked "just soup for dinner?" loved it and ate it for lunch the next day too. Must have been those chuncky egg noodles that hooked him.

Very easy to make. And great if you want to clean out your vegetable drawer. I would suggest preparing all of your vegetables the day before you plan to make the soup. As another reviewer suggested, you really don't need noodles, potatoes, and beans. I used one can of white kidney beans. If you enjoy soup, and want to add lots of vegetables to your diet, this is a great recipe.

This was delicious and a great way to use up some vegetables. We nixed the potato and added extra egg noodles. We also used chickpeas as well as black eyed peas.

I was surprised at how much I liked this soup without any seasonings!  I added salt & pepper to my bowl and found that I actually liked it better plain - this from a salt lover.  Next time I will skip the potato - no need for 2 starches and less chopping, but this recipe is a major find!  Thank you!

Very easy and tasty soup. We used lots of carrots and some corn, parsnips, baby bok choy, and the white beans and noodles. I'm always glad when my daughter likes something made of veggies. thanks!

I know I would enjoy this soup. There is only one thing I would add, which does`nt take anything from your soup and that is a cup and a half of fresh cut okra right out of your garden. Thanks for a great recipe. I know I will make it over and over. especially on a cold or night with some hot or cold pieces of corn bread.

I make this all the time but I usually leave out potatoes and noodles because we are diabetic. If your soup is bland, add Better Than Bouillon chicken paste broth (or vegetable, they have a lot of flavors.)  If you use a good broth is makes all the difference.  There is *no MSG* and it is actually made from chicken and not artificial flavors.   I also add V8 juice which has a lot of  flavor.  If one cannot make a flavorful soup it is not the failure of the recipe author.

Loved it, all the vegetables were really good.  The recipe calls for egg noodles and white beans, those were my least favorite part of the soup.  Next time I’d replace those with barley and chicken.  But overall very good soup and good for you too.

Delicious! Added stewed tomatoes, basil and thyme. Used shirataki noodles since I can’t have egg noodles and omitted potatoes. Topped it off with parmesan cheese and some red pepper flakes. Will definitely make this again.

So tasty! Love this, will make it again. I left out the potatoes (noodles is enough) and the mushrooms as I didn't have any, but increased the cabbage, spinach and broccoli, then added a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and about 3 TB of sun dried tomato pesto. Really good. I also increased the recipe by 50% because I wanted to freeze some - not sure how it will do but it's worth a try to be able to pull this out of the freezer some busy night!

I made this delicious soup last week, ate it almost every day, and now that it's gone, I'm off to the store for more ingredients to make another batch.  

My advise is MAKE A LOT OF THIS SOUP.  And get some good bread to go with it.  The only changes I made were to add a bit more egg noodles, and more potatoes.  I added 5 small to medium yukon gold potatoes, and I left out the mushroooms, because I'm not a huge mushroom fan.  This is fast and easy, healthy, and most of all, it's delicious!

Made the pasta on the side to add to the bowls as we served. Omitted the mushrooms and added celery.
Perfect soup for the crock-pot.  Can relax with a book while supper is cooking.
Will make again for sure.

Delicious soup but even better with the addition of Chinese 5 spice to taste.

Really easy. I added a can of Trader Joe's organic fire  roasted tomatoes (Rotel). Really gave it some jazz. I also halved the noodles. Great tasting and lived the big serving of veggies. Will make it again.

I have been making this soup for years and it's delicious on a chilly night. The only change I make is to use veggie broth instead of chicken broth.  It's fast and easy to prepare too - great for a busy week night!

I used Orzo pasta and leeks, left out the cabbage. Also added two cups of water before adding in the pasta and then added fresh basil just before serving. It came out really good and surprisingly creamy!

Simple and good. I was craving soup with lots of veggies and this fit the bill. Didn't have cabbage so I threw in some celery, also added some cooked chicken. Needed a good dash of salt and pepper, plus a little crushed red pepper as another reviewer suggested. If you're not eating it all in one sitting, a great trick it s to boil the noodles separately and just add them to each bowl (from Jamie's Minestrone on this site).

I didn't add noodles, halved the amount of broth, and used carrots, spinach, tomatoes, radishes and mushrooms.  Added 2 tsp of seasoned salt and a 6 oz can of tomato sauce, plus some fresh basil and parsley.  Without the salt and tomato sauce it would've been very bland.

I didn't enjoy this soup at all. It's very light and I prefer a heartier soup. It feels like random ingredients are just thrown in.
