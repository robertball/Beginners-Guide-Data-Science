These are great!  I left out the red pepper flakes because I didn't have any, but added some Frank's Chile and Lime sauce.  I also used burrito sized tortillas and baked them in the oven instaead of in a skillet.  I sprayed a pan with Pam, put the filling and cheese on half a tortilla & folded it in half (this recipe made 4 for me), sprayed the tops with Pam and baked at 350 for 10 minutes then broiled the tops until browned.  Cooking in the oven helps when you want to have them all done at once instead of one at a tme.  I served with homemade guacamole, sour cream and salsa.

This was SO yummy. Messy but yummy.

Only thing I omitted was the red pepper flake. I knew the jarred salsa I had on hand would be hot enough without adding
the flake. This scaled down well for me,
making two small-ish quesadillas. Very filling.

Every Wednesday night, my roommate, his girlfriend, and myself take turns cooking dinner before our favorite TV Show LOST!  My roommate's girlfriend is the only vegetarian, so cooking vegetarian meals has been something new for my roommate and I.

Well, let me tell you, this recipe was a big hit!  The quesadillas turned out crisp and delicious!  Pretty much followed the recipe to T except I substituted a mexican cheese blend for the montery jack.  Garnished with sour cream, salsa, Chalulu hot sauce, and the green tabasco.  Fantastic!  Will definately make them again!

I thought this was really yummy. I read the reviews and left the brown sugar in the recipe, maybe used a tad less than 1 Tbs.  I thought it added a nice touch.  I added cumin. Instead of using salsa, I used fresh chopped tomatoes that I put on top of the warm mixture in the quesadillas along with some chopped green onions.  I will definately be making this again.  Its a great meatless dish, but I may try it with chicken some time down the road.

This is a quick easy dish that my family loves.  I have made it twice.  The only change is folding over the quesadilla to make it easier to handle.  Thank you for this healthy meatless meal.

Loved these!  I am not a vegeterian but am trying to not eat meat one day a week.  I added chopped jalapenos and a little lime juice and left out the red pepper flakes.  I also just used cooking spray instead of the oil.  I took the suggestion of baking in the oven for 10 min at 350 and then broiling at the end and that worked well if making multiple quesadillas at one time.  Stove top works fine if you are just making one.

You truly don't miss the meat in this recipe.  I was somewhat skeptical at first.
For the onion I used a red onion and used only a third of it.  I used half cheddar and half monterey jack cheese.  Next time I'm only going to use about 1/2 T of brown sugar.  Per other reviews I baked them in the oven for 10 minutes @ 350 and then broiled them for about a minute to brown the tops.  Great Recipe!  My husband loved them.

Great!  The only change I made was I didn't cook in skillet but did two at a time in a 450 degree oven.  I spritzed two tortillas with oil and placed those sides on the outside of the quessadilla so they would brown up and get slightly crispy.  about 10 minutes and you don't have to flip over!

These are EXCELLENT and so simple to make! I omitted the olive oil and used Canola Spray instead. I also omitted the butter and used the spray. I added fresh chopped jalapeno and a little chopped cilantro. My husband went nuts over these. I paired them with a Puffy Chile Relleno Casserole and it made a perfect dinner.

The filling for this is delicious, and adding chicken or ground beef is delish as well, my only suggestion is in preparation.  I always spray Pam on one side of the tortilla (or you can brush on oil or spread butter) lay the tortilla in the hot pan and place cheese on one half, add topping over cheese then add additional cheese on top and fold over.  It's easier to flip it back and forth over the folded side and the cheese on both sides hold it all together and make it neater to eat!!!  Just cut into 2 or 3 wedges!

The taste of these quesadillas was excellent, much better than our normal quesadillas. I used frozen Southwestern Corn and added chicken for a heartier meal. My only complaint was that we had to knife and fork it, because it was so messy. Of course I'll be making this again, though. Next time I might use the filling for a Mexican Lasagna, which would be good too.

Mmmm...I loved these!  I omitted the sugar and seasoned with cumin, salt, and pepper.  I added more salsa as well.  I buttered the tortillas and layered the filling so the cheese could act like glue to keep the top layer from just falling off.

I wanted something to go with some chicken taco soup I had in the freezer, so I decided these would be a good match.   I did make a number of changes.  I combined the beans, corn and onion, adding a chopped jalapeno that needed to be used, and a little taco seasoning for more flavor.  I was concerned that the salsa might make the tortillas soggy, so I left that out.  I omitted the brown sugar altogether.    I totally forgot to sauté the onion, so I just warmed the mixture in the microwave.  I decided these might be easier to handle if I folded the tortilla rather than stacking one on top of the other.  I put the butter in a skillet over very low heat and when melted, I added the tortilla, swirling one side around to make sure it was evenly coated with butter.  The warmth of the burner assured that the tortilla would be pliable and wouldn’t crack when folding.  I used both pepperjack cheese and cheddar.  I layered in this order:  cheese, bean mixture and then cheese again.  I wanted the cheese to act as a glue to hold these together.  Once assembled I transferred them to a cookie sheet and  baked them at 350 for 15-20 minutes.  I served these on a bed of shredded lettuce, along with salsa and sour cream on the side.  These were great!  We both liked them and I would do them again the same way!

We've used this recipe twice now, and both times it was absolutely delicious! 

Now, I made one fortunate mistake when made it the first time: I accidentally bought (organic) refried black beans instead regular black beans (duh, I know). In any case, I had to do something. Therefore, I prepared and cooked all of the ingredients exactly as stated in the recipe; however, I cooked the refried black beans separately. I then layered the tortilla with cheese, corn mix, refried beans, and light cheese and cooked it as normal. It was delicious... absolutely delicious! 

It was so good that we used the refried black beans the second time. However, this time I cooked the onions; added the corn, brown sugar, red pepper, and salsa; cooked it for two minutes; and then added the refried beans to the corn mix. I constantly stirred the mix for about three minutes on medium/medium-high heat, and then let it simmer on low heat while I added the cheese to the tortilla in another pan. Using a spatula, I then placed a fair amount of the mix in the center of the tortilla, followed by a little cheese. As I placed the second tortilla on the top, I lightly pressed in the center to spread out the mix. 

It was even better than the first time!!! This recipe is a keeper!

(I also recommend using one tortilla instead of two. Add cheese and the corn-bean mix to half of the tortilla, folded it over, and cook as normal. They’re much easier to manage in the pan.)

Very easy to make, but surprisingly tastey.  I used a four cheese blend instead of Monterey Jack and it added to the flavor really nicely.

My family and I dont eat much meat and decided to try this recipe without meat first and we loved it. I did do a few small changes; I added a pinch of dried green onions, garlic salt and onion powder to the pan after all the other ingredients.  I also added a little bit more salsa then let it all simmer on low for about 8-10 min instead of the 3 suggested. Because we dont fry anything I put the cheese and mixture on only half a tortilla shell then folded it in half and heated up on my George Forman using non stick spray (this cuts out all that need for butter).  I served them with multi-grain corn chips, salsa, guacamole, and pico de gallo.  Made a great summer dinner.  Next time I might try adding the chicken like suggested but dont think it needs it.

This recipe was great! I didn't have regular salsa on hand so I replaced it with some corn and bean salsa (why not add some more beans, right?).  I also used dried minced onion to make this recipe even quicker and because my husband likes his onions as minuscule as possible.  Next time, I'd add a little more heat to this - maybe some cayenne pepper or hot sauce.  I also put cheese on both before adding the bean mixture and after so that the tortillas would have something to adhere to (otherwise, you'll have a bunch of the bean mixture falling out when you flip it).  Overall a great recipe - even for my husband who thinks that all meals need to include meat!

These were delicious and simple to make. I baked them (15 minutes at 350) so I could make more at a time and also tao save the oil used in frying. Addwed ground beef to my husband's who likes to have meat with supper, and he liked it too. Served with salsa and sour cream, and chopped nutritious salad from this site. Thanks!

This was a simple healthy meal. You can use whole wheat tortillas or also add chicken or refried beans. Since I didn't want to take the time to cook 4 of these on the stove, I cooked them in the oven on 450 for 7 minutes. Spray the cookie sheets lightly with cooking spray and also the tops of the tortillas and you will have one quesadillas for everyone in 7 minutes! No need to turn.

Outstanding! I didn't use brown sugar and added a couple dashes of salt to the bean mixture since my corn was salt free. I used salsa verde, and sharp cheddar cheese. Sprayed flour tortillas with cooking spray and baked in a 350 oven for 15 minutes till brown and crispy. Yummy served with sour cream! Will make again. Easy and delicious!

I love the simplicity of this recipe.  I think the Monterey Jack cheese makes this!  I usually wouldn't cook Mexican with Monterey Jack cheese.  I cooked mine in the oven as other's suggested with broiling for 2 to 3 minutes at the end for browning (don't forget to spray with non-stick cooking spray!)  I doubled the salsa and did not add the in sugar at all.  Mine made 9 healthy but small quesadillas.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!!! what a tasty little dish for someone who thought they didn't like black beans!I wouldn't buy them or try them,and then was gifted 2 cans.(ugh!) I searched recipes and found this--my thoughts were"Well,its easy,has good reviews& I won't waste too many ingredients!!"Boy, did I ever get lucky!! I followed the instructions until the second step,after I softened the onions,I removed them from the skillet.The second step I PURPOSELY BLACKENED the CORN & I think really enhanced the flavor!! I also did add some pre-cooked chicken(because of husband) and also added 1/2 teasp.of chili powder & cumin, and some mexican blend cheese along with the monterrey jack cheese called for. I cooked these on a flat-cast iron skillet & I served this with some mexican rice, guacamole, and sour cream and salsa on the side. My THANKS to EFASSE for a great 5 STAR recipe!!(Oh, and the liberty to add to the recipe,thank you!)

Very tasty!  But I had a hard time flipping them without all the beans and corn falling out. Next time I will put mixture on half of the tortilla and fold - much easier to turn over.

Not bad at all. A bit too sweet, I think if I make again I would skip the sugar, as the corn is already pretty sweet. Could have used more cheese to glue them together better, mine were really messy and didn't stay together very well but that could just be me, I seem to have that issue with quesadillas! I baked instead of fried and broiled the tops for a couple of minutes to brown nicely. We enjoyed them as is, but I think something like cream cheese to hold the filling together a bit better would be a nice addition.

These were so good! I was a skeptic, but my sweetie loves quesadillas and I was looking for a way to make them meatless to save money but still be filling- jackpot! I'm not a salsa person, so I left that and the red pepper flakes out, then added some fresh basil from my garden and squeezed half a lime into the mix. I think cilantro would probably be good in this too.

Wow!  I was pleasantly surprised!  I've been trying to simplify my cooking, having two little kids.  I have to admit that my hub and I are kind of snobby with our food so I didn't expect much from this recipe.  I added chili powder, cumin and garlic powder, as suggested by others. I also cut the sugar in half.  When I tasted the bean and corn mix, it wasn't impressive but when put together and topped with sour cream, guacamole and more salsa, it was great!  I will be making this again!

This dish didn't go over very well with the family. It was too sweet.  The corn combined with the onions and brown sugar was just too much sweet for one meal.  My vegetarian kids asked me not to make this ever again.

As an experienced quesadilla maker, I thought these were pretty good. They were quick to put together, and the ingredients give it a little twist. I would recommend sprinkling cheese on top of the bean mixture to make the whole thing stick together better.

Perfect recipe is perfect. Made some minor changes - substituted white sugar for brown sugar, omitted red pepper flakes because I used a hot salsa, substituted mozzarella/provolone cheese for Monterey Jack. Also garnished with plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream - yum!

Very good i left out the pepper flakes because i don't like hot spicy food. And instead of the flour tortillas I used the corn tortillas. Because i eat Gluten-Free. It was easy and tasty.

The recipe was good but I was craving a little more flavor.  I used green onions instead of regular onions and also used the 3 cheese mexican blend.  We added some chicken too... I think next time I may also put in some pepper jack cheese to add more spice and also may be squeeze  some fresh lime as well.  Overall we enjoyed it though!!

I love this recipe..since I discovered it, we eat these at least once a week.  The only change I make to the recipe is that I blister up the tortillas one at a time on the stove before I make the filling.  Then I place the tortillas on a cookie sheet, top with cheese, filling, more cheese, and another tortilla and bake at 400 for 8 minutes until the cheese melts.  This way, the tortillas are crispy and the inside is gooey and delicious!  The filling keeps great in the fridge for a few days-we always eat the leftovers.

This is an awesome base recipe! However I did make some alterations. I prefer more heat than sweet, so I added fresh diced jalapeño instead of red pepper flakes, fresh diced tomatoes as well as salsa, and minced garlic. I used a pinch of brown sugar and served with fresh avocado. My husband said he prefers this over a restaurant quesadillas!!!

My husband and I loved these!  I left out the brown sugar, and used a little more salsa...not sure how much, just a couple extra spoonfulls because we love salsa.  I heated them in the oven instead of a skillet so they'd be done at the same time.  Buttered two cookie sheets, laid down 4 of the tortillas, layered cheese, filling, more cheese, top tortillas. I brushed the top tortillas with a little melted butter, baked at 350 for 9 minutes and then broiled on low for about 2 minutes.  Delicious!!!

I've found that when you try and flip the tortilla stuff spills out so what I do is use one large tortilla put cheese and filling on half of it and then fold it over to form a half circle.  Both sides of the tortilla are cooked and no flipping!

These were a nice change from our normal quesadilla recipe.  I halved the amount of red pepper, since I don't like spicy food, but will add a bit more next time.  Very tasty and the filling is good all by itself if you have leftovers!

I really enjoyed this easy and tasty quesadilla recipe.  I didn't change anything except to add a little bit of cayenne pepper and cumin to the bean/corn mixture.  Served with avacado and salsa.  It was delicious!

This is so easy and delicious.  The only thing I don't measure is the cheese.  I just throw a hand full on over the filling.  The trick with flipping is to let the cheese melt and bind the filling to the tortillas, otherwise you have a mess.  The medium heat is important here because you don't want to burn your tortilla before the cheese has a chance to melt.

Not bad. I folded mine in half so they were a bit easier to eat. They still were a bit heavy and messy, but thats just fine, I don't mind getting my fingers dirty.  I loved the bit of sweet flavor from the brown sugar.  It was great paired with some rice, salsa and sour cream. I just wish I had had some guacamole.

This was pretty tasty. I spiced my black bean and corn mixture up with chili powder, garlic powder and cumin. It's pretty tricky to flip the quesadilla using 2 whole tortillas. I made a big mess trying that the first time. It's much easier to do one tortilla folded in half. I'd definitely make again.

Very good for a quick lunch or a snack.  Left out the brown sugar, used bottled spicy salsa rojo, added adobo, extra pepper flakes (i like spice) and a bit of cumin.  Used corn tortillas and queso quesadilla. Dipped with crema surprimo and it was defiantly muy rico!

Very delicious and VERY messy! I used green onion cause it's all I had on hand. Also added some sliced chicken breast and fresh cilantro to the salsa mixture and just heated it up in the microwave. Also to cut back on calories I just sprayed the tortillas with Pam before frying, no butter needed.

We really like this. I would say the spice is very low on our taste scale but the flavors were still great! We will make these again.

These came out ok. I love sweet and spicy so I was hoping for something out of this world but got "good" instead. I think the problem is that I usually make my quesadillas with chicken, carmelized onions, green onions, black olives, lots of cheese and some refried beans for glue. So - compared to what we're used to the flavor intensity was under par. For ease and cost though, this makes a good, quick lunch.

This was a simple and quick recipe to make. Hubby rated it as a 3, said was good, not bad but needed something. My daughter Emily said it was awesome gave it a 5. I was in the mild with both of them. I will make these again, but will agree with the both of them that they were good. Hubby and I agree that maybe I should add some cumin, chili powder or more red pepper flakes or maybe less brown sugar. It needs an added kick. Please give this a try people. It's a really good recipe. Worth the try. Will make them again.

I did not like this recipe at all.  I made no changes to the recipe, but I did mash the beans.  I think it would be much better without the sugar.  I don't think I'll try it again.

I've made this twice and both times we couldn't believe how good it was.  The only thing I did different was leaving out the chopped onion.  There's enough onion in my homemade salsa that gets added.  I'll be making this again, again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm a sworn meat eater and I LOVED this! At first, as a quesadilla it was messy and a little oily, so my husband and I reduced the amount of butter used and made sure to fold the tortillas for easy handling.

This was amazing! I omitted the salsa during the mixture cause that weirds me out and I didn't have any for some reason! Added some minced garlic with the onion and a little garlic powder and these turned out great with some sour cream.

Can't get much simpler and delicious!  I used frozen corn, and the salsa I added was mango and peach.  I did add the recommended amount of brown sugar, even with the sweet salsa I used.  Loved it!  I do recommend adding some cumin and chili powder for a nice little touch.  Next time I plan on adding the small can of green chilies.  It's easier for me to use 1 tortilla and only put the mixture on half and fold over.  To get even easier, the mixture would freeze very well, and could be taken out for last minute meal plans.

This recipe is good but not great. I prefer my quesadillas on the savory side and the corn + brown sugar made it a little too sweet for me. Next time I would omit the brown sugar.

Very delicious! I used dry black beans I'd boiled up earlier in the week, and added green chiles and fresh lime juice to the mix. Spooned mixture into large burrito tortillas, tossed in some fresh baby spinach, and folded burrito in half to cook. Served with El Fenix salsa and sour cream. Great vegeterian meal.

I was pleasantly surprised with this simple yet tasty recipe.  I did not change a thing (except I used whatever cheese I had in the fridge!)  The brown sugar and hot pepper flakes combo really added a nice sweet and spicy kick to this meal.

Modifications on the basic recipe included: adding garlic powder, chili powder & about 2-3 oz cream cheese (to mixture after it was heated. I reduced the 1/4 cup salsa to about 1 or 2 TBSP.
Reduced brown sugar from 1 TBSP to 1 tsp, not too sweet, as some said it was who added the tablespoon.
I used mozzarella cheese, as that's what I had on hand.
After heating the tortillas in the microwave, I filled one side of a tortilla, flipping one side over the other (less messy when grilling), making sure there was cheese on top & bottom of filling, then grilled it in the George Foreman grill.
To serve, I topped them w/shredded lettuce, fresh made pico de gallo, salsa, and sour cream. 

My husband and I LOVED them, didn't miss the meat at all!

First time making quesadillas. used a black bean, hamburger, onion, and corn combination. Added salsa and sour cream to above combination towards the end. Cooked a flour tortilla in a second pan, melting the cheese first, then scooping up the bean mixture. Added some cilantro and topped with second tortilla shell. Worked great!

I followed the recipe except for partially mashing the beans, adding a little spinach, and using Salsa Verde b/c I didn't have regular salsa on hand.  The quesadillas were ok... WAY sweet for our taste (no sugar is needed b/c the corn is plenty sweet enough).  What it does need is Adobo seasoning or other Mexican flavors (and admittedly a stronger red salsa would have helped, but at least we had sour cream).  Unfortunately the jack cheese and red pepper were overpowered by sweetness, so it wasn't really enjoyable.  I'd highly recommend not using the brown sugar and/or not using "sweet" corn to limit the sweetness in the filling.

These were awesome! My meat and potatoes husband had seconds. I used frozen corn and no pepper flakes because the salsa had plenty of heat for us. Baked in the oven so I could make more at one time. The filling would make a great dip too!

Great recipe! Tastes really good and I have leftovers. Nice and easy to make too! Next time, instead of using two tortillas and managing to spill half of the filling out when i tried to flip it to crisp the other side, I will just use one tortilla and fold it in half. I may also use frozen corn rather than canned just out of a preference of flavour. 
I'm planning to make this for my boyfriend sometime soon!

Extremely yummy for so little ingredients. I added some garlic anD sautéed with onion. We ate them on fresh and easy's jalapeño and cilantro tortillas. I baked them for 10 minutes and then seared them on a skillet for a minute on each side. This prevented all the stuffing. To fly out when flipping. .

Yummy!!  I added some garlic and cumin.  My 17 year old son was skeptical until he took a bite.  He ate 3 more and had some as leftovers the next day.  Will def use this recipe many times over! Thanks!

I was scared of the brown sugar. lol Having said that made it as is! FREAKING awesome. So much flavor. I think this is one of those recipes you could tweak. I love it as is though! OH man Vidalia onions would be good as well.   My family and I are reducing our meat intake and this recipes offers flavor and substance!!!!!!

The combination of the brown sugar and the cheese made me queasy, and on top of that I found it rather bland. Next time, I intend to skip the brown sugar, add more salsa, and maybe add a mix of cumin, red chili powder, and minced garlic.

Nice change from regular quesadillas. I loved the sweetness of this dish, although my husband prefers spicier quesadillas.

Great! Made these as written with the exception of using frozen corn as I don't buy canned veggies. Will definitely make again. The filling also tasted great burrito style the next day with some salsa. Thanks for the recipe.

I made these for my 4-year-old son and I for dinner tonight.  We both really enjoyed them.  I used whole wheat tortillas and left the red pepper flakes out.  Served them with sour cream, salsa, and sliced avocados.  A great meatless meal.  I think chicken would be a great addition if you absolutely need meat.  I will definitely be making these again!

This is a definite 5 star for me.  It has a little heat from the red pepper flakes, a touch of sweetness from the brown sugar, a light crispiness from the pan-toasted tortillas and a rich creaminess inside from the melted cheese.  It's just a perfect balance all around.  

I prepared this almost exactly as directed except I skipped the butter and just sprayed a non-stick skillet with butter-flavored cooking spray.  Also, I added a little diced green and red pepper along with the onion.  I topped with extra salsa but wished I had sour cream on hand too, so I'll get some for next time.  

By the way, the ingredients and directions as stated would make 4 whole quesadillas, so the serving size assumes that half a quesadilla is a serving.  I ate a whole one and doubt I would ever want less.  It's too good!

YUM! YUM! YUM!  I just made these, and they are so good.  I didn't have any salsa, so I substituted BBQ sauce, and it is delicious!  I also used my homemade tortillas, which also make any quesadilla so much better!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I've been trying to eat less meat and therefore, am on a search for dazzling vegetarian recipes.  This fit the bill.  I baked these instead of fried them and got awesome results.  Next time I'm going to omit the brown sugar and try with cumin and cilantro to see how that tastes.  Served with a dollop of fat free sour cream.  "Naturally Yours" Fat Free Sour Cream is the best.  It's the kind with black and white cow print on the container. Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good - and good for you!  The only minor problem with mine is that they weren't cheesy enough to stick them together, so they were a little messy.  The flavor was great and they were quick to make.

Made this recipe as directed. My 11 year old vegetarian, who has never touched a quesadilla in his life, cleaned his plate. My meat eating husband asked for seconds.  It wasn't messy because I didn't overload the tortillas with the bean/corn mixture.  
Thanks so much for sharing!

Really, really good! I used frozen corn thawed in the microwave. Folded the tortilla for less spillage out the side (for little ones that really helps), finishing it under low broil in the oven really gives it that nice crunchy texture. Served with sour cream and salsa. Yummy flavors. Used slightly less brown sugar and it gave it that extra special 'something', definitely don't omit.  My husband and boys loved it. Said they would have it any night! Thank you! Happy Hour/Football game worthy!!

I have made this several times and my husband I love it.  I make it as written, but skip the butter.  I use a 10" tortilla, lay it flat on my griddle, let warm for several seconds, flip it over, spread cheese over whole thing, put filling on half and fold over.  Cheese melts quickly and glues it together.  I grill until it is hot and crisp, flipping once.  I  like mine with homemade pico de gallo and sour cream.  The lime and cilantro and fresh tomato tartness really compliments and balances the sweetness.  My husband likes guacamole with his.

Followed recipe exactly, just without red pepper, and it was fantastic! I would say that a great portion of the flavor is dependent on the salsa, so make sure you get a good one.

Five stars for a great recipe and base model for all types of additions and changes!  My first change was to use the large 10 inch tortillas, filled one half to the middle, folded, put on med- hot griddle, adding a second quesadilla fold edges meeting in the middle.  Very easy to turn over with spatula inserted from the open side, nothing falls out, and I use plenty of two percent Mexican cheese shreds for glue. Onion, refried beans, salsa, cooked shredded chicken, taco or chili powder, chopped jalapeños from a jar, heated in same skillet as onion was cooked til consistency thickened, add cheese last, layered on tortilla half then on griddle, no mess.  Served with sour cream, salsa and chopped lettuce.    Bill

Made these tonight, but had to make some changes because I wasnt able to get everything as called for. Couldnt get black beans, so used kidney. Added more corn (to make up for lack of beans). Used 10 inch tortillas, but wont do that again, they are hard to flip over. 
Hubby had been working the yard all day so wasnt sure they would be filling enough, but he ate two and didnt have room for a third one. Will make this again (but then more according to the recipe).

Yummy, a great meatless dish.  We try to eat more meatless dishes mostly because its cheaper.  I did not cook them in butter just a dry skillet worked fine.  And I added about 1/2 tsp each cumin and chili powder, delicious!!!

I'm a vegetarian, but my husband and kids aren't. It's hard to find meatless recipes they like, but they LOVED this. It's very filling too. I made 2 big quesadillas for 4 people (had leftover bean/corn mix). I didn't use pepper flakes, but DID USE fresh squeezed lime and cilantro.

We loved these at our house. I did a few things different. First I skipped putting the brown sugar and pepper flakes in. I tossed in some grilled chicken and added more salsa in the mix. It was a huge hit at our house.

I just tried them for the first time. Awesome. The only thing I did different was, I had some left over chicken wings from a fast food joint. They were spicy wings so I shredded them, added them to the rest and OMG.

I absolutely love this recipe.  It's my quick and easy go to when I need something tasty for dinner but don't have much time.  The hint of brown sugar and red pepper flakes makes for a nice sweet/spicey contrast.  I use this recipe often when teaching children and youth how to cook a vegetarian meal.  It's always a crowd pleaser, even amongst the kids who say they have to eat meat to enjoy a meal.

I made this dish last night and my cousin and my boyfriend loved it! I didn't use the red pepper flakes, but i did use a half pack of taco seasoning and it gave it a great taste.(If you have ever eaten the southwestern egg rolls from Chillis thats what it taste like) Great recipe!

Delicious! A fun spin on traditional quesadillas with a sweet flavor that compliments the onions well. Left out the red pepper flakes, still great. The whole family enjoyed so we'll be adding this to the rotation. Thanks for the great recipe!

It was ok. I went light on the brown sugar, but the salsa I used was also a little sweet and the whole thing came out too sweet for me. I added cumin to try and balance it, but still not right. I think this could be very good but it would take some work to figure out the right seasonings.

So good, I know its a veggie recipe but I added chicken! YUMMY! I chopped the chicken and cooked it with taco seasoning like I was making chicken tacos. I also added carmalized onions once the chicken was cooked.I cooked the quesadillas in the oven on 425 until crispy.

My family and I really liked these quesadillas. I try to incorporate more meatless recipes into our diet and this one was very satisfying, and left us feeling full. The flavors were good, although I might make it a little spicier next time. Very easy, just takes minutes to make so it's good for a  weeknight meal. Yum! Oh, and we used way more cheese than it called for, because how can you have Mexican without tons of cheese? Anyway, great meal, EFasse!

These were good...I think it is a good start...but needs something else?  Not as flavorful as I had expected.  I did not use the brown sugar - because I thought the corn made this mixture very sweet as it was!  Will probably make again - but will add more things to add flavor!

Microwave tortillas in damp paper towels rather than putting them in the oven.  Up cream cheese to 5 oz.  Add 1 regular-size can corn to bean mixture.  Omit jalapeno peppers.  These were sooooo good!

I loved this!  I love black beans and corn together and I've never really made quesadillas before.  I used my own frozen corn, and eyeballed the amount.  I used multigrain tortillas but otherwise made them as instructed.  I liked the sweetness and the spicy came through too.  I will keep the filling in the refrigerator so I can make these for lunch a few more days!  Thanks!  Minor update:  it is now the next day and I had refrigerated the leftover filling.  Today I only used one tortilla, filled half with cheese and the filling and folded it over, then put it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes.  Just as good as yesterday when I made it as instructed!

After a weekend of BBQs, my fiance and I needed a break from meat- this was perfect! I followed the recipe exactly, apart from the way I cooked them. I placed the filling on one half of the tortillas, and folded them in half, then grilled them in the George Foreman for about 5 minutes- they were browned perfectly, a lot less messy and no need to cook them in fat either.

YUM! Didn't exactly follow the recipe: put black beans, frozen corn and canned mushrooms in a bowl with garlic salt and microwaved. sprayed outside of tortilla, filled with mixture and sprinkled shredded cheese, topped with another tortilla. Baked at 425 for ten minutes or so... EASY, QUICK, and DELICIOUS! My 8 yr old even loved them!

Pretty good and easy to fix. Next time I will leave out the brown sugar and kick up the pepper flakes a bit. The corn would be sweet enough to balance out the pepper. Will be making this again as well as experimenting with other combos.

A delicious "Meatless Monday" dinner. Quick and easy too. I used frozen corn and baked the quesadillas in a 350 degree oven (instead of frying them in butter). This is a keeper recipe.

Very nice recipe.  I made a few changes:  I only had yellow sugar on hand, so I used that in place of the brown sugar.  I chopped up a shallot instead of an onion because it's easier to finely chop, but the flavour is pretty much the same.  I used frozen corn instead of canned corn (a little healthier).  My kids are picky eaters, so I had to reduce the heat a little by using the red pepper flakes on the "adult" portions, keeping them out of the mix for the child portions.  I cut out the butter and used Pam, opting to bake in the oven, according to instructions posted by another reviewer.  Delicious!

put cheese on one tortilla and some bean/corn mixture, microwave to get cheese to melt.  Spray butter squirt on other tortilla and more cheese, put in frying pan.  Flip tortilla from microwave onto one in frying pan.  Squirt with spray butter.  Flip to brown when first side done.  Great with extra salsa and sour cream.

I found these to be overly sweet, and I didn't even add the sugar. Aside from the sweetness, they were quite tasty. I took them to a friend's potluck cut into wedges, and they were a hit.

So good!  Followed recipe except I baked the quesadillas in the oven for about 10 min at 350 degrees and then broiled until brown.  I could eat these every week!!

Pretty good.. I followed the recipe exactly.  I have a quesadilla machine so I used that to cook them.  I normally cook onions and peppers for our quesadillas, but corn an black beans was a nice change (and quicker and cheaper)

These are to die for.  I love these, and have made them about once a week since I found the recipe.  I love that I can change the ingrediance the way that I want to.  I also really like the brown sugar addition.  It gives a really nice flavor.  I do cut down on the butter, and use spray butter instead.

I gave this a 5 but my husband and son gave it a 3 so I compromised with a 4.  Great flavor, great smell, fairly quick.  I fixed them in the oven as suggested and was pleased how well they browned with no butter.  They were very messy, next time I will fold each in half so the beans and corn don't fall out every time you pick them up.  I will definitely make again.  Great with "the best spanish rice" recipe for a meatless Monday!

Wow!  These are really good.  We really enjoyed them.  I thought they would be a little bland at first, but the flavors really come together great.  Wouldn't change anything about this one.  A definite keeper.

Really watch out for this dish if you aren't a big fan of corn. Seeing as corn is a major ingredient and my husband doesn't like corn, he wasn't a huge fan. I'm not a big fan of quesadillas and I LOVED this dish.

Both kids requested that this become a regular meal. It was very simple, healthy and delicious. I will definitely make this again. I did skip the onion and red pepper flakes and used about 3/4cup of salsa.

Made these for dinner tonight and they were really good.  Would never have thought of using brown sugar but it worked well as a sweetener to balance. the spice.   Will make these again, possibly for the Cinco de Mayo dinner.  Maybe next time I'll add shredded chicken and leave out the corn.

I am not a huge fan of black beans, but I took a leap of faith and tried this due to the enthusiasm of the reviews and was not disappointed.  This was so tasty and easy that I will definitely be making this dish often.  Thanks!!

One word says it all - YUMMY!  Even my meat eating husband and son loved these, without any meat!  These came together very quickly and are so delicious.  I fixed them on the griddle so I could cook 2 at once.  Browned up nicely and cheese melted great.  We loved the flavor the onion added to this recipe.  Thanks EFasse for a wonderful recipe.

these were really good and easy i used a small onion and i didnt use butter at all. only a little evoo to saute the onion and i used spray cooking oil for the skillet. a good vegetarian option for when i dont feel like eating meat, or making a big huge meal

****this is an update...the sauteed onion is completely unnecessary(since salsa has onions) these are soooo yummy if you just heat up a can of black beans corn and about half cup salsa and i used a blend of mexican cheeses. Quick and delicious!!! and the family loves it too so that helps. also i left out the sugar. didnt miss it.

Delicious!! I followed the recipe but I did add chicken to make it more of a meal. I also filled the tortillas with the filling, rolled them up and stuck them in a 9x13 pan. I sprinkled the tops with mozzarella cheese. I preheated the oven to 350 and baked for about 15 minuets. Super yummy and filling! I made this with the mexican rice from this site.

These are really good.  The only changes I made were that I only used a light coating of butter inside a teflon pan.  I also lightly sprinkled the cheese before and after adding the bean/corn mixture to make sthe quesadillas would stay together without being too cheesy.  A definite keeper and I will make them again.

These were  so easy and so delicious!  I did add a little bit of cumin and some lime juice and i was ready to eat the filling right out of the skillet.  My 5-year old daughter ate 1 1/2 of these, so they are definitely going into the dinner rotation.

If you have 8 flour tortillas and use 2 for each serving - the number of servings is 4, not 8.  That mistake changes the nutritional information, as well.

These quesadillas are AWESOME!!!  I adjusted the portions down for just me, used cayenne pepper instead of the pepper flakes, garlic instead of onion, and added a little cumin.  I also sprayed my griddle with olive oil spray instead of using butter.  They were absolutely fabulous!  I will definitely be making these again and often!

Yum! Yum!  I add a little extra salsa, brown sugar, and red pepper and its perfect.  Also, I assemble everything and just stick it in the oven long enough to melt the cheese.  Much easier!

Good but not great.  It was a good meal to serve my vegetarian daughter-in-law. I would make again but maybe add some extra spice as we like things hot.

Good hearty meatless quesadilla. They hold together better if use one tortilla and fold it half. We used the tortillas at Costco that are uncooked and you cook them yourself. I didn't bother with the butter since I don't usually use it to make quesadillas. For cheese I used a Mexican blend because that is what I had.

These were awesome!  I did change a few things because I didn't have the recipe ingredients on hand.  I used taco seasoning instead of red pepper flakes, and instead of salsa I used taco sauce, (I don't like tomato chunks :)  I also spread a tiny amount butter on each side of the tortilla, and it make them a bit more crispy!  These will for sure become a normal in our house!

These were pretty good,but they really needed some spices as the final result was rather bland. Next time I'll add some cumin or a packet of taco seasoning.  I also added a minced garlic clove and could've easily left out the brown sugar as the corn adds plenty of sweetness for us, the brown sugar almost made it too sweet.

Yummy!  These are great for a meatless meal.  They are filling and you don't find yourself wondering where the meat is.  Watch them carefully when you cook the filled tortilla.  They brown very quickly.

Excellent alternative to a meat entree!  My husband has to have his meat dishes so I wasn't sure how this would be received.  It is filling so he didn't go away hungry and he even suggested that we have them again - maybe adding a few small shrimp next time!  The only change I made was using a 4 cheese Mexican blend instead of the Monterey Jack.

Delicious. Omitted the brown sugar and added fresh garlic, cumin, and chili powder to the bean mixture. I also put the beans through the food processor so they'd be a bit spreadable. Baked in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes instead of frying. Loved it. Thank you :)

I love this recipe and go back to it often.  I try to prepare a few vegetarian dinners per week, and it's hard to find ones where my husband doesn't miss the meat.  This one is always a hit!

This is an excellent recipe! I made it tonight and had to substitute cheddar cheese for the monterey jack cheese and tabesco for the red pepper flakes. It was so delicious and even my meat-loving husband agreed!

These were delicious.  I thought I knew what they were going to taste like before I ate them because I've eaten a lot of dishes with black beans and corn.  I guess it's the brown sugar that chaged the flavor.  At any rate these are everything you want in a recipe...quick, easy and yummy.

UPDATE   I am having these for lunch today and realized since the last time I rated these someone turned me on to baking them at 350 for about 15 minutes.  Much better and much healthier.

Very good.  I doubled the salsa and used frozen corn (thawed) instead of canned.  I also baked them at 350 for 10 minutes then broiled them for a couple of minutes.  Much easier then doing them on the stovetop.

I was actually hoping for a little more based on the ratings. My hubby did not think it was filling at all and DID miss the meat. However, we enjoyed it and really liked it as a filling for breakfast burritos with just eggs added the next morning.

Pretty good alternative for our usual quesadillas. I did add chicken, garlic, jalapenos, and some chili powder to kick it up alittle. Thanks for the recipe! We will definitely keep using it.

These were just OK to me, but my husband loved them. They were very good with chopped green onion, and I really liked the addition of cilantro as well. I will halve the sugar next time and double the onion.

This was a HUGE hit last nite! I didn't have black beans so I used pintos -- I think virtually any unsweetened canned bean will work. Other than that, plus using my quesadilla maker instead of frying, I followed the recipe to the letter. It yielded 3 slightly over-stuffed 10" large quesadillas, but I could easily have stuffed a little less & made a fourth. I served them up with plain sour cream and they were GREAT! I'm sure the 2 left-over slices will disappear very quickly today. Can't wait to do it again next week...

I've made these a few times now, and love them. Not spicy enough for me though.I add some green HOT salsa to liven it up a bit, and diced jalapenos.  I tried canned corn, but fresh corn is much better. I even tried some chicken/jalapeno sausage diced up, browned and thrown in. The filling holds up well in the fridge and can be  used for a couple days of leftovers that are just as good as the original meal.

Delish!  I was planning on making just a black bean, corn, and cheese quesadilla, but I found this and it spiced up my idea.  I left out the onion since I don't like onion, and didn't have any red pepper flakes, and so I added a little bit of garlic powder (I LOVE garlic).  YUM!

Wow, these are so tasty and easy!  And cheap!  It doesn't get better than that.  Even my husband (a serious meat eater who grumbles every time we have a meatless meal) really enjoyed them.  I added some cumin and fresh garlic and it was perfect.  I think in the future I would cook them in the oven, as others have suggested, because they're kind of hard to make on the stove without making a mess.  Will definitely make again!

YUMM!!!  This is a great dish!  I omitted the brown sugar and instead used sweet corn; and used Pam spray instead of butter.  Cooked in the oven (with flipping once) as another reviewer suggested, so I could serve all at once for a dinner party.  I made this a meal with a green salad with El Torito brand Mexican Ceasar dressing with home made tortilla strips on top (just cut up a corn tortilla and fry in a little oil).  Also served with no-fat sour cream, avacado and homemade salsa (tomatoes, jalepenio, cilantro, onion, & lime juice.  Great healthy meal, will definetly make it again.

Very easy recipe and very tastey.  I did NOT add the brown sugar .... And am glad that I did NOT.  The corn adds its own sweetness for the dish.  I would make this again.  No need to worry about flipping the whole tortillas .... easy as 1 2 3!

These are cheap, tasty, and easy.  I omit the sugar, it just doesn't need it. I just spread black bean mixture and cheese on one half, fold over other half, put them in the oven at about 350 deg., flip them once after first side starts to crisp up. These are a regular at my house.

I made these quesadillas tonight for my husband and I and they were absolutely fab-u-lous!!!  We loved them!  I did change the recipe a little, so here's what I did:  I sauteed half a medium onion in olive oil, added a large clove of minced garlic and about 1 tsp of jalepeno puree.  Once the onions were translucent, I added about 1/2 can of black beans (drained and rinsed) and 2/3 can corn.  Once these ingredients were heated through, I added about 1/3 cup of salsa, 1/2-1 tsp cumin, salt and about 1 1/2 Tbsp brown sugar (would have been better with only 1 Tbsp though).  I heated this through and turned the heat off for a half an hour or so (I don't think this step is integral to the dish though!)  I used 6" flour tortilla's; I sprinkled one tortilla with Tex Mex blend cheese, added the black bean mixture, added a bit more cheddar and topped with another tortilla.  I sprayed the tops of the tortilla's with Becel spray and baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes and then broiled for about 2 minutes.  The end result was three very tasty and healthy quesadilla's which I suspect are going to become a staple in our house.  Just delicious - thanks for a great recipe!

These were very good. Next time I will omit the brown sugar. I didn't care for the sweet aftertaste. 
Also, I added some cumin for some extra flavor.

These were very easy to make, and tasted great. Next time I will probably add a bit more salsa to the mix.

This was SO good! I used frozen corn instead of canned because I prefer the flavor. I also used a Mexican cheese blend instead of just Jack. It is much easier to make if you use one tortilla and do the "fill half and fold over" method rather than doing the "sandwich" style that is suggested in the recipe. This is a great, inexpensive and a filling recipe that is great when coupled with a salad.

I skip the onion and sugar. Add minced garlic and used rotel rather than salsa, allowing the liquid to reduce in the heated black beans and corn. Adding chopped spinach or other veggies turns out well, also.

This is a go-to vegetarian meal for us now. As mentioned on my other reviews, it's been difficult to find vegetarian meals that I can prepare (that taste good!) That don't take a lot of time or tofu (I still can't cook it properly). This was quick to cook up. As always, I eyeball the seasonings, but I also cooked the salsa in with the black beans and corn. It really helped meld the flavors and make it pop.

I doubled the recipe and folded the tortilla in half instead of using 2 tortillas for one quesadilla.  I used a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes instead of the salsa.  After the quesadilla was cooked on both sides, I cut them in half.  I used  24 taco size tortillas, which became 48 quesadillas.  I made them in the morning and put them in a slow cooker on warm for a lunch time pot luck picnic.  The bottom quesadillas got a little soggy, but most of them were just fine.  It was a tasty finger food for a picnic!

I thought this was very good. You can change so many things if you like. I actually liked the brown sugar flavor inside the filling. My only complaint is I had a mess when I accidentally overfilled them. Next time I will try oil on the outside instead of butter as well.

I made it for my young kids and they loved it with a few changes, Used whole wheat tortillas, Mexican blend cheese, very little salsa, a pinch of cumin powder and baked it in the oven at 350 for 10  mins.

These are simple and absolultely amazing! I increased salsa to 1/2 cup and use corn tortillas for gluten free. I garnish with diced scallions and the sour cream is a must!

The filling was easily enough for 4 or more tortillas. I made two and froze the rest of the filling. I baked the quesadillas and that was much less stressful. I think next time I will bake for about 8 minutes, flip them, then turn on the broiler to make sure both sides are lightly crispy. I didn't have sour cream on hand but I was dearly missing it, although they were good even without it.

AMAZING!  This was my first time making one of these.  My daughter is a vegetarian and I thought it would be nice to  make this for a family dinner.  I love the brown sugar in it.  Adds a little sweetness but not too much.  We ate this for dinner three times last week.  My husband whose NOT a vegetarian LOVED it!  Kudos to this recipe!

I added cumin and fresh cilantro to the bean filling. Serve with homemade guacamole for best results! I used one tortilla folded in half to cook two at the same time. I also use avocado oil instead of olive oil, just my preference.

Really nice. I lightened them up and spiced them up.  Half the oil. Cooking spray instead of butter. Added 1/2 onion, 1/2 green pepper, a jalapeño pepper, tsp chilli powder, tsp chipotle powder and used  5 large shells folded in half . I did not add brown sugar and I only used 1.2 oz cheese per serving. Counting calories.  Thank you for a wonderful base recipe.

This recipe is stellar! I use it pretty frequently, but I sub in low-fat cheese and corn shells (for less calories, sodium, and carbs.) Inexpensive, fiber friendly, low-fat and filling? Yes please.

Made it tonight. Used rotel instead of salsa and Frank's Red Hot in place of the pepper flakes  and it turned out DELICIOUS!!!! Paired it with a salsa and sour cream dipping sauce. Definitely will make this again, actually I think we are having left overs tomorrow. I eve plan on using the bean amd corn mixture as a dip in the future and replace the tortillas with tortillas chips :). Thanks for the idea

I paired this with tortilla soup for my first venture in making a vegetarian meal. My family and I enjoyed very much. I was unsure of it because I am not a bean fan, but very glad that I tried it. Most definitely will cook this again.

We tried this tonight to increase our vegetarian meal choices because meat has gotten so expensive. It was super easy and far more flavorful than I expected. Definitely a keeper. We used dry black beans (1/2 cup of dry beans = 1 can) that we simmered until tender. Also frozen corn instead of canned. I also used about half a 16 oz jar of medium salsa, and olive oil instead of butter. I forgot the sugar but will probably add it next time. Really loved it like it is, though! Thanks for the recipe!

Great tasting, easy to make.  My family LOVES this recipe.  The first time I made it, the filling fell out all over the place as we were eating it.  Was NOT easy to handle.  The next time, I folded the tortilla over in half and that made it so much easier to eat.  Overall, the recipe is great, as is.

It was alright, nothing really special.  Something seemed a little off about it - I almost wonder if I would like it better if I left the corn out.

Very yummy!! I left out the red pepper flakes and sprinkled some chili powder instead, since it's all I had. I also used only 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar, based on another reviewer's suggestion. I added a little more salsa, 1/3 c. just because the mixture looked like it could use more moisture. My store only had marble cheddar cheese, so I used that. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Delicious and quick! No point in going out for Mexican now. This is going to be a regular dish at our house.

Amazing dish!! We are meat lovers and this was fantastic as is! Modifications: I sprinkled each side if tortilla (outside, facing pan) with Cajun spice. Also added to the sautée some  red & yellow bell peppers as well as mushrooms, and some cilantro at the very end. Used cheddar instead of jack. 5 stars!!!!

This recipe was fantastic and filling! I am basically a carnivore but I didn't miss the meat at all. Word of warning for newbie cooks the most difficult part of the recipe is flipping the quesadillas in the pan make sure the bottom tortilla is nice and crisp depending on your stove this may take a minute or two longer than stated. Doing that will make it way easier to flip it over to get that nice crunchy taste! Enjoy!!!!!!

Another recipe that I tried thinking skeptically it couldn't be that great since it was so simple, but I was simply wrong.  It was demolished by our crew and we will definitely make it a permanent repeat!  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious. Made mostly as written, the only change being that I used frozen corn instead of canned. We both loved these. I made them twice last weekend, and they have been requested for dinner again tonight. Good for you, delicious, and inexpensive to make.

I added a diced Hass avocado and a little garlic to the recipe.  My husband doesn't care for Mexican food, but he loved this!  To reduce the amount of butter used, I just took a stick and rubbed the pan when I needed.  Also, any leftovers are great as a burrito, or scrambled in with some eggs for breakfast!

Great!  Quick, easy and yummy. Couple changes. I used canned Green Giant Fiesta corn. I also mixed the cheese right in with the beans and corn.   I used the smaller flour tortillas and I browned one first, removed, put the other in to brown, then put the bean mixture on the first one.  By time I did that, the 2nd one was browned and put it right on top. That way, no flipping needed!

One word to describe this recipe: Fabulous! The only thing I did different was omit the brown sugar and used the Mexican cheese blend which included Monterrey Jack cheese. I used the utz brand sweet salsa which has sugar and so the brown sugar was unnecessary. This recipe was great and I will make again in the near future. Thanks EFasse!

Made this recipe last night.  My husband and I both really liked it.  I followed the recipe but added cut up cooked chicken breast.  After making the first one & having trouble turning it, I added more cheese to the top and pressed down the second tortillia.  That way when I flipped it it didn't come apart!  Yummy for sure!!!!

Too sweet for me, but ok. I don't use the butter - I heat my skillet until a water bead jumps, dip the quesadilla in water, shake off and set in pan. When the edge curls, I sprinkle with a bit more water and flip. Finish according to recipe.

I just made this for lunch and it was absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was to use fiesta blend cheese because that's all I had.  This was the best quesadilla I have ever eaten. Perfect blend of spice and sweet.  My kids loved it too!

I love 'black bean and corn' anything!  These are delicious.  Hint:  if you like these for camping, just get a jar of black bean and corn salsa and a bag of cheese and you can make this on a camp stove with a lot less fuss.  You might need to drain a little liquid off your salsa if it has a lot or you'll have soggy quesadillas.

These were so yum! At first I was skeptical because of the brown sugar.. but it totally made the dish! The first time I made them I didn't have any onions, only had mozzarella cheese on hand and less salsa than it called for but they were delicious. I even added some leftover rotisserie chicken I had in the fridge. Thanks for this!

I LOVE these. So spicy and sweet. I usually double the red pepper for a spicier kick. I also use frozen corn, not canned, as I never have canned corn on hand. Substitute 1 cup frozen for canned. Delicious!

The rest of the world likes this recipe much more than I.  I have to tell you that flipping a loaded tortilla sandwich is almost more than I can handle.  I find using a 12" flour tortilla and folding it in half (like a traditional taco) works much better if you have to make a lot of this.  Then just cut it in half and you get the same, slightly bigger wedge shape for dipping.  I found using about half the cheese worked well.  I also tried using olive oil instead of butter.  I like the olive oil better -- you get a nice crisp shell . . .  but I seem to be the only yes vote.  This recipe makes a lot -- easily enough for 4 and there is no "going half" on it once you open the cans. Much better served hot.  Does not re-heat very well (pretty soggy).

This is a great basic and quick yummy recipe.  We were in a hurry so I mixed ingredients in bowl.  I used onion powder instead of fresh onions, added cumin, and left out oil, sugar and butter.  I used a nonstick pan, placed tortilla in pan with the bean and corn mixture along with leftover chicken shredded and then added cheese, placed another tortilla.  Heated it for 1-2 minutes, flipped it carefully for 1-2 more minutes.  Topped with more salsa and a touch of sour cream.

This is delicious as is.  But the second time I made it, I felt it needed more authentic Mexican flavor.  I added 1/4 cup of fresh chopped cilantro, 1/4 teaspoon of cumin, juice of 1/2 of a lime, and one chopped fresh jalapeno pepper.

If you don't want to mess with all the "flipping" of a quesadilla... make it a "toasted" or "grilled" burrito style.  That is, put the contents on one tortilla, roll it up burrito style... then either grill, broil, or put in a pan... to toast the tortilla on all sides.  It makes it less messy to eat... but the results are the same.

I really liked these and my picky toddlers ate them too. I added chicken for my husband, but I personally think they are just as good without it.  Next time I will get a little sour cream to serve with it.

This is great for a "no meat" dinner. I usually have all these items on hand so it's an easy fix.. My husband loves it & it's basically a healthy meal. I add sour cream, he adds hot sauce. Very good!

This very tasty recipe was super easy and fast; I think the recipe really over-estimates the preparation time (and I'm not that fast in the kitchen). I followed the recipe with the following changes: (1) given the amount of beans and corn, I felt the onion should be increased, so I doubled the amount and it wasn't oniony at all, though I sauteed them pretty well; (2) I used a chipotle chile salsa (from Trader Joe's) which added a great smoky flavor that my wife and I though was a significant improvement; (3) I tried using butter as recommended on the first quesadilla, but saw no need for it, so I just dry grilled the subsequent ones and they were delicious.

These were pretty good. I was expecting a little heat and a little sweet, but I tasted more sweetness than anything else. I think the corn makes these a tad too sweet. I would have liked these much more had I subbed a spicy corn blend for canned sweet corn (my grocer is now selling three different varieties of Mexicorn, chipotle being one of them). Other than halving this and using 10 in. tortillas instead of 8 in. ones (my quesadilla maker requires the larger tortillas), I made no changes. Shredded lettuce, pico de gallo and sour cream complemented our quesadillas nicely. Mexican rice and margaritas completed our simple weeknight meal. All in all, these were decent but I need to play around with the ingredients a bit to suit my tastes. Thanks for sharing, EFasse. :-)

I really liked the taste but couldn't flip when I put one tortilia on top.  Tried one and folding and that was easier. Need to view the video.  I think my tortilias were too big.

This is a great recipe. Easy to prepare. I did not have Monterey Jack cheese only sliced Havarti, which I cut into strips and placed on the tortillas just it says in the recipe. Added some cheese onto the black been mixture before putting the second tortilla on. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

This is one of my favorite things I've made with black beans! I thought I had a can of whole kernel corn but didn't, so I used some of my fresh creamed corn I had put in the freezer this summer. I drained it before mixing it with the beans. I omitted the oil and butter to save calories and used low carb tortillas as well. I served it with plain Greek yogurt and extra salsa on the side, and of course, my husband added hot sauce to his. A delicious meatless meal!

I thought this would be a good make shift Monday night meal that would just get us by; but as it turns out my husband thinks it is one of the better recipes I have tried.  An extra perk for adding this to our meal rotation is I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  I rinsed the skillet I prepared the filling in and used it to to cook the quesadillas in same skillet .... so easy clean up in the kitchen.  Nice to find a recipe that is this easy for me and also keeps "The Colonel" happy.

When I make these I use 1 tortilla. Spread mixture on 1/2 & fold over.
I use refried black beans.  They act like glue to hold remaining ingredients.  Less mess & easy to flip. Also I chop green onions no need to cook.  No brown sugar. Personal choice.  Check your fridge for leftovers.  This is also a good recipe to use up leftovers for  lunch.

This is a great combo of flavors, but the recipe is lacking in seasoning and (for me) heat. I used black beans cooked with garlic, onions, and chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Added drained fire roasted tomatoes and used leftover grilled corn off the cob. Layered low fat jack cheese on multigrain tortillas with spicy bean mix and caramelized sweet onions. Served with 0% FAGE greek yogurt & fresh guacamole. It was surprisingly light, spicy and delicious! Perfect with a Corona and lime.

OK I did the lazy mans version of this and used cheddar cheese soup for cheese and a can of Costco chicken because my roommate wants meat in his meals but this was still very good. I always read reviews to get a feel or what can be done with the recipe. I added Costco chopped jalepeno and cumin. I fried up the tortillas before hand and put it in the oven for 6 minutes at 450 folded over with the filling inside.Next time I will take the time to chop the cheese. Recipe really divides nicely for 8 people. I made 4 and have enough filling in the fridge for 4 more Quesadillas for lunch tomorrow :)

I will definitely be making this again. Not only is it easy to make, but the ingredients are cheap as well! (which is a bonus for a broke college student like myself, lol) The flavor is simple, but it's a classic and it paired really well with Mexican rice and some fresh lime juice. Instead of making them in the pan, I baked them in the oven at 350, for about 8-10 mins and I layered the cheese on both the bottom and top of the quesadilla to prevent the tops from coming off. I didn't use the full tablespoon of brown sugar and I probably used more than the amount of cheese this recipe called for, but otherwise I stuck to it and it turned out great! :)

This recipes is AMAZING! It's on our Top 10 list :) We eat these at the very least once a week. My husband makes me use hot salsa, so I secretly leave out the red pepper flakes :P Sometimes we leave out the onions just because I hate chopping them. Otherwise, we don't change a thing! You won't regret trying this recipe! It's a keeper!!

My family loves this recipe!   I leave out the sugar and its sweet enough if you use sweet corn.  I also browned the tortillas on a non stick griddle so I didn't need the butter.  A healthier version but just as tasty.  I definitely use the red pepper flakes though it adds just the right amount of kick.

Do it just like it says and read all of the reviews to determine what changes sound good to your taste, I did, and these were WONDERFUL! Left everything as stated in the recipe except the red pepper (my picante was medium and after cooking it kicks up the spice plenty) added some chopped cilantro and about a tablespoon and a half of whipped cream cheese (all that was on hand) to the bean and corn mixture. I made sure to heat long enough for the liquid to evaporate so not too soggy. BTW--you have to crisp the tortillas on the inside portion of each side before adding the mixture and colby-jack cheese to the middle putting the crisped sides to the inside and heating together to melt the cheese and brown the outside. I used cooking spray instead of butter, but saved heating the oven by cooking the tortillas on both sides. Served with sour cream and home made guacamole. FABULOUS!!!

This was very flavorful and easy! I would definitely recommend it, and I know I will be making it again. The only change i made was no oil, just sprayed the pan and added garlic with the onion. Next time I make it however, I'll most likely bake it because I like my quesadillas crispy, and the mixture was so moist that it made the tortilla soggy and messy in the pan. I also will add some fresh cilantro, but that's just my taste preference. I'm obsessed with cilantro and I try to use it whenever it goes with a recipe. Thanks :)

Absolutely delicious!! Easy to throw together, but a bit difficult to flip in the pan. If you have a quesadilla maker, definitely use it with this recipe. But it's just as tasty with the topping spilling over. :)

Really good. Also makes a good side dish with just the onion, beans, and corn sauteed and a dash of cilantro.

I did not care for this recipe.  I had high hopes because of all of the great reviews however it was just not good to me.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it was bland and too sweet for my taste.  I also didn't enjoy the corn mixed in with the black beans.  Will never make this one again.

So yummy!  My meat eating husband said they were better than the chicken quesadillas I usually make.  Loved them and will make again and again.  I am trying to go meatless one day a week and these are perfect.  I added spinach to them as well because I had some I needed to use up.

I made this earlier in the year and forgot to review it.  This is a fantastic meal for vegetarians.  And even for us non-vegans too!  I baked mine instead of drying in butter.  Delicious!!!

This was pretty incredible. I just added some salt and pepper and a dash of cumin to the bean mixture. I only had muenster cheese and some shredded mild cheddar. Great combo.

These were excellent quesadillas. They're tasty, filling and, most importantly, very quick and easy to make on a night where you don't much time to plan or make dinner. I took another commenter's suggestion and baked my quesadillas instead of frying them in a pan, and it worked pretty well.

I love these, very easy to make and tasty as-is (I've made it a few more times without the brown sugar, just a personal preference). My husband loves these too, and he usually prefers some kind of meat to eat. A frequent quick dinner in our home!

Very yummy.  I did omitted the sugar because the salsa I used was on the sweeter side.  My meat loving hubby thought it was good (which says a lot to me).

I made these tonight and they were a big hit.  I followed the recipe except only came up with a net of 3 quesadillas.  I guess I loaded them up a bit.  They were very good. I served with guacomole, salsa, and sour cream. The recipe is definitely a keeper.

While this was a bit bland for my tastes, Mr. LTH really enjoyed these and I appreciate how customizable these are.  Next time, I will double the filling to freeze for future (even) easier quesadillas!  THANKS, EFasse!

I love this recipe. This is one of the few things both my husband and I can compromise on when I want a meat free dinner. He just throws some leftover chicken on his. I have made this both as directed and have changed it due to what I have on hand (5 stars all around.) A few tips- use a large tortilla and fold it in half, it's so much easier to flip that way. You can leave the pepper flakes out and use pepper jack cheese. Sour cream is a must when serving. I ALWAYS use medium salsa mild is too bland. Cilantro and lime juice also make a terrific addition. Thanks so much for the yummy versatile recipe!

I used whole wheat tortillas. I also used frozen pinto beans and frozen corn to cut back on the BPA exposure from cans. Didn't have red pepper flakes, so used tiny amount of cayenne pepper. It was delicious! Served with lettuce, salsa, guac, sour cream.

I was a little leery about using brown sugar in these but I did and they were delicious!  I took the advice of others and baked them in the oven instead of skillet.  My 2.5 year old daughter also scarfed them up!  Love when we can find meatless entrees every once in a while!

This recipe was great!  Very easy to throw together; really, the only thing that took any time at all was chopping the onion.  These proportions made large quesadillas for myself and my boyfriend plus some extra filling.  I did not use the butter, as I cooked them in my panini-maker and just sprayed the panels with cooking spray.  My only complaint was that the mixture was a little mushy, so it made the tortillas soggy (at least it did when I used my panini-maker).  I would suggest using a chunky salsa.

We've been making these as-is at least once a month since we discovered this recipe. It makes everyone - veggies and carnivores alike - very happy. Thank you!

Excellent!!! I didn't have salsa so I used almost a can of rotel (tomatoes and chilies). I added some chicken to the husbands, nut had mine as is. It was really good. I liked the sweetness, but could have used a little more heat (probably b/c I left out the peper flakes as well). GREAT recipe!

We used Morning star Black bean burgers and fresh sweet corn. Fried the tortillas and put some monterey jack cheese with some sour cream and salsa! WONDERFUL! The WHOLE family went NUTS over it!!

These were good. I loved that they were really fast to make, perfect for a weeknight! I used mild salsa so I added some hot sauce. Also, I would use a little less brown sugar next time.

These were great!  I have made them many times.  They are a little sweet, which we like.  You could leave the brown sugar out.  Tonight I made nachos with the mixture, adding cheese onto the chips and baking a little in the oven, then serving with guacamole and salsa.  Wonderful!   You could make a burrito with the leftovers, freeze them, then pop them in the microwave.

Great recipe to make if you are short on time, but want something filling. I like how simple it is, but I might add grilled red pepper in the future. I warmed them up on the Forman grills and served it with mashed avacados.

Very nice just difficult to eat as it slides apart (maybe this is becuase we put too much beans/salsa) but it's delicious. I would like to find a way to eat this more decently so that I can prepare it for "guests" aswell and not only for friends and family.

Unbelievable! Used less cheese but more veggies (onions, green pepper, mushrooms) to lower the fat and increase the fiber. The seasonings were point on. Had plenty of extra filling for leftovers, which were still just as tasty.

The only change I made was substituting taco sauce for the salsa, but that's just because I really don't like warm salsa. I also tried to make it a little healthier by using whole wheat tortillas and used cooking spray instead of the butter. It turned out great and I will definitely be adding this to the rotation! Thanks for sharing!

I give this four stars because it is missing some crucial spices to enhance flavor.  I made it as directed, and the second time I added chili powder and cumin to the onion and a little bit of extra salsa.  This is a GREAT base recipe, and probably is good on its own for those that don't like intense spiciness.

I've made these several times now and it's delicious!  I use a quesadilla maker and cooking spray, but other than that I make it as per the recipe.  I do use whole wheat tortillas and pico de gallo style salsa.  It became a family favorite the first time I served it.

This was great.  Simple but really yummy and filling.  I eyeball portions, but can tell that as written was good too.  The only main difference I do is I melted the spices right in the olive oil, THEN added the onions (for me it was frozen onion & pepper strips from BJs - cheaper and faster) and frozen corn and sugar.  I also used a little Cumin and Adobo, dash of Cilantro and touch of lime juice and garlic.  I rinsed the beans while that was cooking, added them with a little hot sauce (had no red pepper flakes), cooked that while I prepared the tortillas.

I too baked them.  A trick to make them less messy to eat: put a thin layer of cheese on the bottom tortilla, THEN add the topping, then add more cheese.  It helps "glue" it together.  Otherwise it slides a little when you try to cut it.  I used a pizza roller/cutter to make our wedges, and I didn't have to fork & knife it until the last one.  

I also used a little shredded manchego for extra depth.  Any way you make this relatively close to the recipe will be great!

Served it with fresh avocado & salsa.

I made these tonight, making a few changes as others noted (adding cumin, omitting pepper flakes, omitting butter and baking/broiling them), and adding one grilled chicken breast that was shredded.  I also used fresh made pico de gallo instead of salsa.  I served with sour cream, additional pico de gallo and homemade guacamole. They were fabulous and I will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing.

DELICIOUS! Wanted a vegetarian dish to serve my vegetarian daughter, but this was so easy and delicious that I now make them all the time. I find that this recipe makes about 12 quesadillas. And to make it easy, I spray 2 large baking dishes with cooking spray, fill the quesadillas, fold them in half, place them in the dishes, spray the tops with cooking spray, and bake them at 350 for about 15 mins. The leftovers are just as good if you put them in a COLD oven and heat until the temperature hits about 350. Don't microwave the leftovers!

These were very good and easy, but I thought it needed about double the salsa (I guess it depends how hot yours is -- I used medium).  Great and crispy straight out of the pan

We really liked these, and the brown sugar was a nice addition.  Tonight I'm using cotija cheese for a little changeup, but not changing anything else.  Good recipe.

Yum, these were super simple and really quick to make.  I followed the directions exactly and used sour cream and guacamole for dipping.  Will definitely be making these again.  I also put in some chicken in my hubby's since he likes to have his meat at each meal.

These were yummy, yummy!!  No changes needed.  I did have canned black beans with jalapenos on hand, so I used those and they added a bit more of a kick.  Put a little low fat sour cream on top.  Really good meat free meal.  I will definitely make these again and again!!

Awesome! Filling and nutritional. But 40 minutes from start to finish? Took me about 15. I can only assume that is if you are cooking 8 separate quesidillas-40 minutes is the total time.  I only made two. These are very quick to make!

Looks like these are a hit with the family for future meatless Monday meals, in fact hubby went back for seconds  .. We started this tradition about 4 yrs ago and are always looking for something new .. this was easy to prepare and I had everything on hand .. I would say the only change I made was that I had some white corn tortillas in the fridge that needed to be used up rather then buying floured ones and because my husband and older son like spicy they added jalapenos to their quesadillas .. Like one of other recipients of this recipe, I also baked in the oven at 350 .. a very good idea when trying to prepare for a family meal .. will definitely make again

Excellent recipe! I used mexicorn, El Fenix salsa, and unsalted butter instead of olive oil. These were a little sweet and a little spicy. What was really surprising is that my beef and potatoes loving husband wanted some too and he loved it but he thought it was too spicy for him. I loved this!

I think I like them with a little less sugar than the recipe calls for, and I had some leftover reduced-fat sausage that I added to one batch (and that was a super-delicious addition).  I highly recommend these for a healthy, quick, and wallet-friendly meal!

So easy and so delicious and so cheesy. My son and I loved these. Hubby was away and isn't partial to black beans. He doesn't know what he missed. This recipe is a keeper.

My meat loving husband didn't even complain when I served this for dinner. I added a good amount of Taco Seasoning I (which I keep in the cupboard) to the beans and corn while they were heating. That was the only thing I changed (aside from not using the butter, and using UNCOOKED tortillas), and we LOVED these. I will definitely make them again.

My husband (a big meat-eater) and I both loved these! I took other reviewers' suggestions and they came out perfectly. I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 Tbs. and added chili powder, garlic powder, and cumin to taste. I don't like spicy food, so I didn't add any red pepper flakes, but my husband does, so we added jalapenos to his quesadilla. I used whole wheat tortillas and served with sour cream and salsa.

Only rating four stars because there is NO NEED to cook these in a pan and flip them.  That was so much trouble.  My husband came in and was like why are you cooking it like that?  Put it in the oven on a pizza brick and wala, just as crispy without the butter.  This was great!  Served with sour cream, salsa and guacamole.

Followed the recipe exactly...these were good, just not amazing. The family inhaled them and they were easy to make so we'll probably have them again. Might add some black refired beans to make it less messy

This is an excellent recipe. I particularly liked the crunchy-crispy quality of the tortilla. We added leftover fried chicken meat and it was wonderful.

Good vegetarian meal! I also added mushrooms and green pepper since they needed to be used up in my fridge. Used monterey jack cheese since that is also what I had. Great recipe to improvise. Leftovers can be heated easily in microwave next day. Thanks for sharing!

The great thing about quesadillas is that you can fill them with so many different ingredients. I omitted the brown sugar and the pepper flakes. I put about a table spoon of Cayenne chili pepper and a table spoon of cumin. Like others suggest putting the ingredients on one tortilla and folding over is better. I put cheese on both sides. I added a cup of salsa and simmered until liquid left. I served with homemade guacamole, sour cream and homemade chili verde and rojo.

Everyone enjoyed these and they all went. My solution to flipping the whole tortilla in the pan was to put a small cake plate over it and invert onto the plate then slide it back into the pan

I cut this recipe down to 2 servings and made 1 quesadilla in my Santa Fe quesadilla maker.  I used zero oil and zero butter.  Used sliced green onion because we prefer them over yellow onions any day, 1/4 cup each black beans and corn, 1/2 tsp brown sugar (not really into sweet foods), 1T salsa, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and 1/8 cup  of cheese.  Topped with sour cream and more salsa.  Didn't even miss the meat.  These would be great with some grilled chicken tossed in too.

These were amazing! This is a very versatile recipe. I've made them twice now, and the first time I didn't have all of the right things, so instead of black beans, I had to use red kidney beans, and I didn't have salsa, so I used taco sauce. I used a full 16 oz bag of corn to thicken it up. Received rave reviews from my toddlers, and our vegetarian friend!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe with only a minor addition: I sprinkled a little cumin and garlic powder on the onions as they were sauting. Also, reduced the butter to one teaspoon - more than enough for my nonstick pan. Will certainly make again and again.

I made this last night and did nothing different except add some cumin...because I love cumin. This was amazing! I cooked mine on a griddle and folded them which, as others have said, made it much easier to flip. On the griddle I could cook three at a time. Add a side of bluebayou's "Fresh Tomato Salsa" and you have a wonderful healthy meal that tastes like you're in Mexico.

Great recipe/idea! I only gave 4 stars because I modified the recipe a bit. I used diced tomatoes instead of salsa, added a bit of cumin, used cheddar cheese and cut the brown sugar in half. I would also recommend getting bigger tortillas and folding them in half for ease of flipping.

I just made these, and they were okay, but next time I would leave off the top tortilla and fold them over.  There are almost 200 calories in one tortilla, and I found that having two of them in one serving was just too much.  Other than that, they were good.

We used frozen corn instead of canned and baked in the oven, 350 for 10 minutes.  These were really easy and delicious.  We used a bit more cheese than called for I think.

This was really great tasting and my family really enjoyed it alot, I left out the red pepper flakes since mild goes over better then hot at my Mom's house and I used 5 inch tortillas instead of the 8 inch, big hit will be making in the future for sure, thanks so much :)

SO GOOD!!!  Wow,  the corn and black bean mixed with the brown sugar, salsa, and red pepper is delish. Instead of using 2 tortillas I just used one and folded it.  That made it easier to flip.  Other than that I made no changes.  Can't wait to make this again.

These were good, I liked the sweetness from the brown sugar.  They could definitely use some tweaking though.  I think adding chicken and other spices would be good.  ETA:  Made these again w/ grilled chicken and liked them so much better!  It added the extra something I was looking for.

Great easy recipe. I did tweak a bit. I used frozen whole corn, added diced chicken and used chipolte chili instead of the red peper flakes. Had a nice crunch to the tortillas and was great with sour cream. Served with black bean rice.

Easy and excellent! I left out red pepper flakes and added finely chopped sweet orange pepper. Used mild salsa to try to keep it kid friendly. Kids "sort of" ate it. lol I loved it!

Only thing I did different was add green pepper in with the onion, used pepper-jack cuz that is what I had in my fridge and as usual, used my panini press to cook them :)  Fast, Easy and Tasty... totally worth a try.

Excellent! Per other recommendations, I used 1 teaspoon of brown sugar. I did not really use the red pepper flakes- just a shake or two. I added a little more onion for my own taste and 2 tablespoons green chiles to compensate for red pepper flakes. Baked @ 350 for 10 min then broiled on low.

This was really delicious.  Really enjoyed the brown sugar with the heat.  I decided to add more heat , used more red pepper flake - next time I might add pickled jalapenos too.  Great, easy recipe for a work night.

I have three teenagers, one of whom is a committed vegetarian. This recipe received rave reviews from all, including the parents and the non-veggies, and I love it because it's so easy she can make it even for herself for a healthy and tasty dinner. I served it with salsa, sour cream, and homemade guac to up the nutrition as well.

A fantastic combination of spicy and sweet.  I've made a version of these before, but the addition of brown sugar is excellent.  The only change I made was to use non-stick spray in place of butter.  Thanks for the recipe!

Used others suggestion and cooked the quesadillas in the oven then broiled with cheese.  Outstanding!  We're not vegetarian but even my 11 year old loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Fantastic.  I added one large chopped chicken breast that I had seasoned & browned in skillet with Taco Bell taco season mix, about two tablespoons of chopped onion & approx 1/4 cup water. Didn't have the red pepper flakes, but everything else I kept the same.  Wonderful. Thank you EFasse for sharing this.

Made this today and it was great.  My meat loving boys, 9 and 13, said they didn't miss the meat at all.  It was a hit with the whole family.  I usually make changes based on other peoples' reviews, but I didn't have time to read through but did add 1cup instead of 1/4 salsa to the mix and will make the same way next time.  I may use my griddle so I can cook both sides at one time (I don't like baking b/c it doesn't taste like a quesadilla to me).  Tip:  on the last one I overfilled so I squished out the extra filling and sauteed it in the empty part of the pan and once I plated the quesadilla, I put the beans and carmilized corn on top of that and it had amazing flavor.

I thought these were pretty good although a bit too sweet for my liking (I can see why this is popular with the kiddos). Even with the pepper flakes added, this was a very mild quesadilla which could have used a little more zip. Maybe cilantro and cumin? Also, I think this would be good with some shredded chicken.

The ingredients are simple, yet this tasted really good.  I liked the hint of sweet and heat.  It was a good balance.  I added some chicken to mine, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This is great for a quick, easy meal!

Great Recipe.  I made a couple of alternations though.  First, I skipped the red pepper flakes - didn't have any, didn't miss them.  Second, I substitued Pam cooking spray for the oil and skipped the butter entirely.  I just browned the tortillas in a dry pan and they came out fine.  Definitely a keeper!  Hubby and DD loved it.

Very good.  Used the George Foreman grill instead of the stove.  Had a little trouble with some "leakage" of the stuffing since there was more pressure on the quesadillas than there would be in the pan.  Will try it in the pan next time since it seems like it may work better.

UPDATE:  Tried in a pan and was MUCH better this time.  Also added a little cumin, chili powder, and garlic power.

This was so good, quick, and easy! The perfect dinner in a pinch! I didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I added some chili powder and some garlic. It definitely wasn't enough filling for 8--maybe I was just putting too much filling in, though.

Unfortunately, we weren't fond of the brown sugar and my husband didn't like the corn.  Other than that though they weren't bad.  I can see myself making these quesadillas again but leaving out the brown sugar and adding a little chili powder or cumin.  A couple tips: I mashed the beans some with the potato masher so the mixture would stay together better.  This was a good call.  Also I made my quesadillas in the toaster because I have terrible luck with them on the stove!  All I did was heat the tortillas one at a time in the microwave until flexible, spoon the filling onto half the tortilla and sprinkle with cheese, fold the other half over, and carefully put the quesadilla in the toaster.  Then toasted until lightly golden.  Even though we weren't fond of the filling on its own, I thought it was reasonably good once made into quesadillas.

These were super delicious, and very easy to make. I had some leftover black beans from some veggie burgers I made so this was perfect. They're sweet, but savory, too. It was just what my stomach wanted tonight. :)

These were excellent and very filling! My husband is a huge meat eater and he didn't mind that these were vegetarian. A great way to introduce a meatless meal into the rotation!

These are so yummy.  I didn't add the sugar and I also toasted them in a dry pan instead of using oil.  They were very good.

This is the BEST quesadilla reicpe ever!  Oh so easy...my whole family loved it and begged for more. I made a few small changes...I had no salsa so I used rotel I also added a dash of cumin. I used kraft shredded american/chedder mix of cheese. I also left out red pepper flakes because I had little ones eating this. Mmmmmmmmmmmmm! Will make again and again! Pair it with Newman's mago tango salsa and some quacamole...you will never eat mexican out again!

Added a little cumin. Made a great, fast dinner. If you're not very adept at turning quesidillas, melt the cheese on one side, take out of the pan, put in the second tortilla and cover with filling, then put the toasted cheese one back on top.

So Good and So Simple!!  This is one of those easy recipes that you wonder why you didn't think of it, but I am sooooo glad you posted it!!  I use a mixture of pepperjack and cheddar and leave out the red pepper flakes.

Made this exactly as written, except I used a little more onion (1/4 med onion). My husband loved it, but I only thought it was ok..I think it was too much corn for my liking. Will make again though with some modifications.

Wow I didn't realized how much corn and black beans would fill me up! I was feeling quite hungry and made one with one tortilla folded over.. I'm stuffed and it was pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised. I'll probably have another one for lunch tomorrow. The brownsugar gives the onion the caramelized effect and blends nicely with the rest of the ingredients

This recipe was just okay for me. I was out of onion and therefore didn't use any but that was the only change I made to the recipe and I doubt the onion was a make it or break it ingredient. I think this recipe definitely has potential but it's lacking something. It could use some more flavor to it (and I'm sure the type of salsa used makes a huge difference here).

This was terrific! I made with corn tortillas rather than flour due to gluten-free needs.  We assembled them like tostadas and they were just amazing.  The sweet spice hotness flavor was just right. We used Tostitos restaurant style salsa.

YUM. This was a great basic recipe for filling some flour tortillas. The changes that I made were to add an entire small onion, substitute the canned corn for frozen, a large garlic clove, finely diced and 1 can of chopped, stewed tomatoes with the juices drained. I let them all simmer together til the liquid reduced and rolled them up with black olives, sour cream and pepper jack cheese. My kids loved them!

I absolutely love this recipes, the flaver is a bit sweet and tangy. It certainly doesn't need any meat but chicken does taste good inside as well.  I make this every couple of months. Thanks so much!

These were phenominal!  The brown sugar gave it a distinct flavor that I thought accented the red pepper flakes so well.  My meat loving boyfriend even said these were good!

Yum, these were very good. Hubby just deployed, yet again, so I need recipes that I can assemble quickly. This fit the bill, and my not quite 2 year old ate it. My corn was super sweet, so I omitted the sugar, I also omitted the pepper flakes since the baby was eating it. I sprayed it with vegetable spray and baked it in a 350 oven for about 15 minutes. Served it with Spanish rice, salsa and sour cream, can't wait to have it again.

WOW--Thanks so much for this recipe. My 2 yr old loved it for lunch. As recommended I doubled the recipe and doubled the salsa. When we were done with lunch we made burritos and froze them for my husbands lunches. Very convenient recipe....

I used homemade beans, raw red onions, and some leftover (corn off the cob) cream corn like no other instead of the corn and sugar.  Added cilantro and kept salsa on the side with some sour cream.  Also served leftover beef  fajita quesadillas with the leftover peppers and onions.  Kiddo liked the black bean and corn better.

This is very filling and tasty!  I didn't use the red pepper flakes. The quesadillas with the filling are a little hard to flip over so it can be messy-- but that is OK. We cut up some avocados to serve with the quesadillas as well.

Much milder than I had expected. I followed the recipe as written, adding the brown sugar, medium salsa, and the red pepper flakes, but it was still mild, with more of a sweet than spicy taste - probably because of the supersweet corn. It still tasted good, just needed some extra heat.

I made these quesadillas for lunch today and they were excellent. I almost omitted the brown sugar and I am glad I did not because it does give a nice flavor. I added pinto beans instead of black, just a preference and I also added cumin and fresh cilantro.

Yummy!!!  I used refried black beans and monterey/cheddar mix because that's what I had on hand.  Made a nice slightly sweet quesadilla filling.  My husband and I really enjoyed these quesadillas and they were SO quick and easy to make.  This one is definitely a keeper. Update:  We make "delishadillas" at least every two weeks.  I tend to double the recipe and make the second can of beans a can of refried in order to bind all the ingredients well for spreading on a tortilla.  I melt the cheese directly into the mixture before making the quesadillas to save time and mess.  This is one of our very favorite meals and it is so quick and easy to make.

I make these as vegetarian and sometimes I add leftover shredded chicken.  Both are excellent.  Instead of regular corn, sometimes I substitute Mexicorn.  I also add salt, 2 cloves garlic (everything tastes better with garlic)  and cumin.  I also find them easier and less messy to handle if I spray a cookie sheet with Pam, load the contents onto one half of a large (not 8") tortilla, fold over the the other side, and then spray the tortilla with Pam.  I bake them for 8-10 minutes at 350F.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these!!  I tried them out last week when our vegetarian neighbors came over, and have had them three more times since!  I can't get enough.  My only change was using frozen corn instead of canned, and I baked them in the oven like some other reviews suggested.  They came out perfectly.  Serve with salsa & sour cream for a killer quesadilla!

I have to admit I was a little hestitant when I read the ingredients of this recipes.  I made it exactly as the recipe reads.  I did make it ahead of time and put it in the fridge until I needed it.  So easy for a vegetarian meal topped with salsa and sour cream.  Definitely a keeper - Thanks!

I liked this better than my traditional chicken quesadillas. I didn't even miss the meat. I added frozen corn from a bag and I cut back slightly on the amount called for in the recipe. I also added a bit of southwestern seasoning. Yum!

Love these! A great quick dinner especially for nights when hubby is on the road and I don't feel like cooking a big meal for just me and the kids. All three kids, ages 18 months to 6 1/2 years, love these!

I never really had black beans before but this was really good. My boyfriend loved these we added shredded chicken to them...used salsa with a little bite to it to add extra flavor. Had guacomole with it didn't have any sour cream but both would be good.

Great recipe!  I will make this again and again.  I have actually already sent it to several friends.  Like suggested i folded ours in half and fried two at a time in my 12" cast iron skillet.  I added one cup of frozen corn instead of canned and it was nice and crisp. Came out amazing.  My husband did request the addition of chicken as he is a big meat eater.  When i used the leftovers for lunch i actually just added some ham in his and he said it was excellent.

These are pretty good.  I think next time I will add some shredded chicken.  These are more of a quick snack for my kiddos before we head out for football, soccer, bball, ballet, tap.... you get the point.  Great go to meal.

Seriously, the best quesadillas ever! To the person who said not enough spice, get a better salsa! I actually had everything on hand for a salsa (homeade) and garden tomatoes so I made my own. These are to die for awesome! Will make them for dinner and serve with mexican rice.

Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty! I used wheat tortilla's and I cooked them on our grill instead of pan frying. Even my kids loved them (I also omitted the hot pepper because of the kids, but still yummie!) Great way to get some veggies and beans into them!

This recipe as is didnt have enough flavor for me so i added some cumin, garlic and a little salt.  Also cut the brown sugar way down.  I suggest you add a little, taste a little until its to the sweetness you like.  Four stars because it really needed the extra spice for my family.

This was a big hit with my wife and me. I veganized mine by using margarine in place of butter and using Follow Your Heart Vegan Monterey Jack. I forgot the red pepper flakes but they were tasty none-the-less. Thanks so much for this great recipe; I'm sure it will become a regular for us.

As a 19 year old teenager I looked at the vegetable mix in the pot and wondered if I would really like these as much as everyone else did. But then once I tried them I thought they were great. I also ended up folding them in half because flipping things scares me. But, like other reviewers said I wish I would have cut down on the sugar and added more pepper. Maybe some jalapenos because I love spice. I will definitely make these again because they were just so easy!

These were okay.  I think I didn't care for them because they were so difficult to flip and to eat.  Corn and black beans kept falling out.  I think I prefer a basic cheese quesidilla with a side of beans/corn.

This recipe okay. It was too sweet. I followed it exactly, except for adding some minced garlic to the onions. I don't think that was a good idea because of the sweetness of the corn & sugar. If I make them again, I will not add the garlic, and I will not add the sugar.

Very good and really easy to make. I make this for my husband and I and just give my kids quesadillas. We added some cumin and green chilis because we like it spicy!

Make my own quesadillas on the fly regularly. Followed this recipe to a tee. Well, I did add spinach because I had some that needed eaten. These were great. Don't think I'd add the sugar next time. Corn is sweet enough.

Delicious!  I followed this recipe to a T, only adding jalepeno's, because I like everything just a little bit more spicy.  Great mexi-vegetarian treat!

very good. the filling was delicious just by itself. once cooked up in the quesadillas though, they were a little dry.  next time i think i will use more salsa. also, the type of salsa you use has a big effect on the flavor, so consider that when shopping.

Just finished eating some of this. I found it made a TON of filling, we ended up with leftovers of the filling in the fridge. The filling really makes it, unexpectedly sweet and brings out the flavor of the corn. Next time I might use 1 1/2 tbsp of brown sugar and double the red pepper flakes. This was good enough for company or a party, plus it's cheap and healthful. Only sub we made was whole wheat tortillas to make up for the fat in the cheese. Satisfying for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

These are fantastic!  What a nice change of pace for a quick weeknight meal.  This was actully the first recipe I made from this site, and it kept me coming back for more.  I have made them three times so far, and every time they have come out great.

I made these tonite and we enjoyed them enought to make again. These are the changes I made from suggestions from other reviews.  I used chili powder and cumin instead of pepper flakes ( will probably use some flakes also next time.  I added some additional salsa and instead of canned corn, I used Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn (yum). Left out the sugar - corn made them sweet enough.  I had some cooked chicken so I shredded some of that onto 1/2 of the whole wheat tortilla, topped with 2% cheddar cheese (I was out of Monteray Jack - might use PepperJack next time), then put on the bean mixture and folded over the other half.  Cooked in the fry pan in a little olive oil instead of butter.   It's easier to flip and to eat the folded over quesidilla than the double tortilla one.  I topped it with low fat sour cream and and salsa - good and good for you!

It's a healthy recipe as long as  you don't add too much cheese.  I made mine w/ 2% milk mexican cheese.  Easy quick meal.

Awesome! I never really cared for black beans but between the cheese, corn and salsa who noticed. I forgot to add the sugar but they were probably better without it. My 'pickest then most' 5-year old ate until he bit into a black bean. Oh well, nice try. But we made a New years resolution to eat at least two meatless meals a week. This is going into my regular rotation. Oh, and DH is finally full!

OH MY GOD.  This is WONDERFUL.  I threw it together right quick so all I did was sautee the onions in butter and throw in the can of beans and corn, little sugar little salt and WHA-LA this stuff was GOOD!  I couldn't have eaten mine fast enough.  Seriously.  My kids even loved it.  The Monterey Jack was the best addition to a not even completed and A+ recipe.  Will do over and over and  over again.  Thanks !

These were awesome =) This makes a LOT of quesadillas and even then, the filling was kinda falling out. But I did add a little chicken to it.

So yummy and easy to make.  Makes enough for four servings.  Too much for one person.  
Found this on the internet @ https://www.unlockfood.ca/en/Articles/Budget/All-About-Beans.aspx
Dried beans that have been cooked can be kept covered in the fridge for 5-7 days or frozen for up to 6 months. Label with a date and store beans in an airtight container made for freezing food or wrapped tightly in heavy foil.

Very good! We're a small family, so I opted to use part of a bag of frozen C&W Southwest Blend (peppers, black beans, corn, etc.) and it worked out fine. Thanks for sharing your yummy recipe!

Very easy & quite quick to put together when you prepare the filling ahead.  My reason for the missing star is the addition of brown sugar in the recipe - waay too much "sweet" for our palette in combination with the corn, so I was glad I went with my instinct & left it out. Our adult son doesn't like sour cream or guacamole, so we had extra salsa with a good squeeze of lime juice & a grind of habanero pink salt - the tang perked everything up!  We are vegetarians too, so I love to see plant based  recipes coming in from so many creative chefs. Thank you!

This was so yummy !  I did make a few additions. I added some fresh garlic to the pan with the onions. I added fresh spinach to make it a little healthier.  I also added fresh cilantro to the mixture. Lastly,  I offered guacamole and additional fresh cilantro along with the salsa and sour cream as toppings. Super easy, fast and delicious!!

These are fantastic. I honestly hate quesadillas, I think they aren't filling, I've eaten so many plain cheese ones in my life that just the thought of eating them turns me off, but these have changed my mind. I love the sweet savory flavor of them, the flavors work so incredibly well together. Even my husband who hated anything black bean after I made him eat a bunch of black bean burgers, loved these quesadillas. The beans made them especially filling.

Great taste. I take these to party’s as my appetizer on a baking tray sheet and heat in the oven as suggested in another review and then broil for a minute to get the whole thing crisp. 5 Star.

This is my new fave quesadilla recipe! I love it. I added zucchini, red pepper, cilantro, cumin, garlic and onion powder, and salt. I used soft taco size tortillas and folded them in half instead of using two, and frozen corn,  shredded mexican cheese, omitted the pepper flakes. Then I cooked them on my panini grill. They weren't messy for me. I will be making these more often!

After reading other reviews and not having all ingredients on hand, I decided to try this anyway--I'm glad I did. I started out with a pound of ground chicken, added chopped onion and banana peppers. Then added refried black beans w/green chilies & jalapenos, and a can of well-rinsed creamed corn. I used some taco seasoning, left out the brown sugar, and added cumin. I fixed these in the oven at 450 for about 5 minutes till turning golden. We love them. Will make again. Just throw things together that you like--it just might work.

Fabulous meal! I added Kirkland brand canned chicken and used wheat tortillas for adults and white tortillas for kids. Wheat tortillas stuck a little more to the pan than white tortillas. I used Pam spray instead of butter and they toasted nicely but the wheat still still stuck to pan.

I love this recipe because it is easy and versatile! I sauteed diced red peppers and diced jalapenos with the onion in lieu of the salsa because I didn't have any on hand.  I also used sharp cheddar. Don't be afraid to sub. It was delish! My husband said he would be a vegetarian for the night and to be sure to add this dish to our weekly menu.

So simple and tasty. Next time I’ll cut back on the brown sugar as the corn lends enough sweetness to the recipe. 
Served with the usual suspects ie salsa, sour cream etc and you’ve got a good dinner on a warm evening. Enjoy

Every family member volunteered their approval so this is a keeper.  I used a parchment on a half-sheet, olive oiled the down-side of the tortilla in one layer.  Then, cheese followed by bean/corn mixture. Then more cheese. Oiled the top-side of tortillas as final layer.  Baked in the oven for 15 minutes.  I think the brown sugar was key in balancing the salsa, as mentioned in the video.

This was a fantastic quesadilla recipe! Thank you!  A few tips I might add are as follows: 1. Smaller tortillas, such as fajita size, are much easier to work with, as they can be flipped with minimal fuss or fallout. The smaller size tortillas also allow for more individual servings; they are perfect for younger kids; easy to hold and eat, either cut into triangles or left whole, and there is not a lot of waste.  I used soft taco sized tortillas initially, and they were fine, but for the subsequent quesadillas, the smaller ones worked better. 2. If you grate your own cheese, it seems to melt better than the pre-shredded cheese. I also found that scattering a bit more cheese on top of the filling will glue the top and bottom tortillas together. I didn’t change anything else, and this recipe was terrific! I used organic canned black beans; they are a bit smaller than non-organic, and canned corn with no salt added. I also used organic jarred salsa, and I think those ingredients made a difference in taste. Just very clean and fresh tasting. Doing without the casein in pre-grated packaged cheese also made a difference, I believe. I am going to try this sometime with diced green chile, white beans, Colby cheese and chopped tomatoes. Thank you again!

We used frozen corn instead of canned and really enjoyed this recipe.  Next time we are going to leave out the sugar entirely as the corn is sweet enough on its own.

I added the juice of a lime, cilantro and some jalapeno.  The final result was very messy.  I think it was the combination of the salsa addition and the Monterey jack which is a softer cheese when it's melted.  I'll make this again but probably with cheddar because I think it will hold together better

These were good, but I would use a spicy or regular salsa next time. I used a mango peach salsa and it lacked the flavor I expected. Great to pack for lunch the next day and reheat.

I've tried a lot of corn and black dishes that were always a bit bland but the little bit of sugar really brought out the flavors. I found these very filling and will make again.

I made it exactly as written, I would definitely skip the brown sugar if I had to do it again. Corn is sweet as it is, brown sugar just makes it way too sweet. Overall it's an easy recipe but not worth the time or the clean up. Skip all the cooking, just drain and rinse beans and corn, put some on a big tortilla, add some brushetta or pico-de-gallo (even better if you like it spicy), chopped jalapeno (fresh or pickled), cilantro, green onions and cheese. Fold it in half and toast on a pan or in the oven, flip to toast on both sides until slightly crispy. Serve with sour cream and salsa.

I liked it, although I did not have any of the red flakes. I added some sour cream to the bean and corn mixture.  Husband suggested I add ground beef (he likes the taste of ground beef) but I feel it is not necessary since the beans are filling and have protein. Easy to make.

I absolutely love these.  I’ve used the recipe many times but I had left over pepper jack this time so I added that with cheddar and oh my gosh!  I couldn’t stop!  I also did the raw refrigerated tortillas this time and it made all the difference.  I won’t make it any other way! ALSO BIG THING: it’s already sweet from the salsa and corn so I left the sugar out as well and it was still sweet enough! Bomb!

I liked this, and it definitely serves 8!  With sides, this makes a lot of meals. 

I thought that the filling was a little bland and will next time use either spicier salsa, chili seasoning, or pepper jack cheese to give it a kick.  Adding shredded chicken would be a no brainer to up the protein on this dish if desired!

These were great. I made them with fresh corn that I had frozen. I also added some left over chicken from the night before. Salad on the side and we were good to go.

Sorry, but I didn’t like it! Maybe because I left out the  sugar? But it just tasted plain and wasn’t worth getting fat over it

This is a go to meal. I use other veggies in addition to the beans and corn such as mushrooms, bell peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, etc just to give more texture.

these were good however I couldn't get the two tortilla method to work without making a huge mess. So I got some inspiration from the picture on the ALLRECIPIES website and used only one tortilla folded in half. Worked perfectly.

I layered cheese, filling and cheese again.  Cheese holds it together better. I fill 1/2 of tortilla and flip the other side on top of it, I used a flat pancake type grill, browned one side then flip it over and browned other. Then cut it in half. I used chicken and without both excellent. I have made it already several times.

This is a great option for a vegetarian appetizer.  I used 6 inch tortillas, quartered them, and served with sour cream and fresh salsa.  Everyone thought they were tasty.

Really great recipe. I don't like onions so I added onion salt (like 2-3 shakes. nothing crazy) to the butter  instead.I also cubed and boiled some potatoes for about 14-15 minutes to get them to be as tinder as the corn kernels and black beans. I then added the potatoes to the corn and black beans then dumped them into a pot/pan to mix with the sugar and salsa. I used mild salsa, but I think it'd be even better with something spicier.

This is a solid start. The only additional thing I do is put in a small can of green chili’s with the onion. The initial frying of the green chili’s brings out the flavor and really takes these to the next level.

My family really loved this recipe. I also made my 7 year-old daughter a cheese quesadilla and she preferred this one. She even asked for the leftovers in her lunch-box which rarely  happens.I followed the recipe very closely.  I wasn’t sure if we would like the brown sugar, but it added a nice subtle sweetness.  We are adding this one to our regular recipes. Thank you for posting!

We decided to make one vegetarian meal per week. Hard to do when kids don't like vegies. This recipe was a great hit. for kids and adults. I  added 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce  to the corn and bean mixture. Like other reviewers, I used one flour tortilla, heated it on one side flipped it and added cheese and bean mixture and folded  and heated it for one minute, cut them in half  and served them with sour cream, salsa and avocado on the side.

I had no idea vegetarian food could be so good! I also never thought to play with the ingredients for quesadillas. I barely tweaked the recipe for my picky kids, using just the beans and corn for theirs (next time I'm making them eat the other ingredients because you can't tell the bits of onion from the corn) and very minimal mods for the adults; I went very light on the pepper flakes because I'm the whitest person I know when it comes to heat but next time I'll add a bit more. I had pico de gallo salsa so I didn't add more onion. Holy , these are soooo good! The mild sweetness is addicting when combined with the tiny bit of heat from the peppers. I struggled with getting the tortillas out of the pan because it had taller sides and was exactly the same size as the tortillas, but once I figured that out, it was super easy. I even made the 11 and 9 help make them! Even Husband will be making these, and he's of the opinion that anything more involved than throwing a frozen pizza in the oven is too much work most evenings. These are stupid good.

This was a quick and easy Vegetarian recipe. For the meat eaters in the house, I added shredded rotisserie chicken to the sauteing onions. I also added ground cumin, garlic salt, and ground red pepper to the saute. They turned out great. Thanks to the originator of the recipe for a simple and easy dinner idea!

EXCELLENTE - I skipped the brown sugar, red pepper flakes, and salsa. Reserved the salsa for a topping with fresh homemade guacamole! Seasoned with cumin, chili powder with lime, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper (basically taco seasoning). Made in the form of a half moon, oiled cookie sheet with olive oil and baked in the oven on 425 for 10 mins. The entire family (which includes picky teens) loved! Try meatless, save our planet and give your digestive system a much needed break from processing meat! You won't be disappointed!

I made this for my kids and I. To my surprise, they absolutely live it. I omitted the brown sugar from the recipe, but it was a hit. I will definitely make again.

Very tasty.  Filling mixture didn’t hold together, quesadilla fell apart.  I used more salsa which also made the filling too wet and made the tortilla soggy.   Next time   I would make as a burrito, make sure to reduce liquid, and possibly more cheese to hold filling together.

This is a very simple recipe and good for someone new to cooking.  It’s also a quick meal for a weeknight.  Even my picky three year old likes them and didn’t mind the black beans,

I followed the recipe exactly and had trouble with the flipping over in the frying pan.  I might do what one person said and bake them in the oven next time, or just make the filling and use it in my burritos instead.

I LOVE this! I also added Chicken, Green Chiles, chopped Red Bell Pepper  & Frank's Chile and Lime Sauce.( Did not add  Red Pepper Flakes or sugar)
I use 1 Burrito size flour Tortilla and I cook it on 1 side on Medium Heat until it starts to brown, then turn it over and place fillings, starting and ending with cheese on half and fold over  ~ I always have Sour Cream on the side ~
YUMMERS!
I know I made some changes, but I love to share what I think others will enjoy!
Thank you so much! I will be making this often!

These were great, though I did tweak it. Did not use salsa, added about half a green pepper, and included  additional seasoning to the beans and corn besides the brown sugar (salt, pepper, paprika, adobo). I also used frozen corn and reduced sodium canned beans. I also added cheese to the top of the bean mixture as well to get the top tortilla to stay put!  My first time making these, and I don’t cook often, but they were quick and easy to make. Turned out pretty good, and I’ll definitely do it again!

Good - Added a chopped red pepper as well and simply sauteed with the onion. I suggest only using one tortilla per quesadilla and folding it over. Very hard to flip with 2 tortillas and made things messy.

We really liked this. Followed the directions without changes to ingredients. The only thing I did differently was to use one tortilla, fill half with topping and flip the other side over. This makes it easier to flip to cook the other side without everything pouring out. Easy to make, had everything in the cupboard already. Will definitely make again.

Better than I thought it would be as I was cooking! left out the salsa and baked them in the oven (450 for 10 minutes— each filled tortilla folded in half rather than a stack of two). I almost left out the brown sugar but I’m glad I didn’t, it really added something good to the flavor. I’d also leave the salsa in if I could!

I was so surprised how good these are! Thought they’d be bland but they were delish. I crimped the edge of the tortillas as they cooked and they held together, no mess.

In an effort to move the family towards vegetarian meals I tried this out. My kids aren't too picky but it's always an adventure trying something new. The family loved this recipe and asked that it be put onto the permanent rotation list. As an added surprise I mixed the cheese with NON DAIRY CHEESE! About a 50/50 blend. They loved how creamy it was. I had larger tortillas on hand so I made them kind of like an omelette instead of using two tortillas. 5 stars all the way!

Definitely loved these! It was super quick and easy; plus, it's great for lunch the next day! Only thing is I ended up putting in 1/2 cup of salsa, 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, but that's only because I'm a girl who loves things on the spicier side.

I  think they should be  called corn and bean. I really liked this recipe in concept but if i would make it again i wouls put in a lot less corn. I could not taste the black beans at all.  Other than that delicious. I think it could be improved by adding some roast veg. Red bell peppers or yams instead of corn.

Delish!  We've recently decided to go meatless and have been searching for recipes.  This is a great one.  Used a small amount of ground red pepper instead of the flakes and added shredded cabbage.  Assembly was cheese on half a flour tortilla, veggie mixture then a little more cheese, fold tortilla and baked at 250 degrees til heated through.  Served with sour cream and salsa.  Will certainly make this again.

Because I'm sensitive to chili and hot sauce, I used salsa verde. I also didn't add any sugar. The frozen corn I used was sweet enough; you don't need the extra sugar.

This was surprisingly tasty.  I used one tortilla, put the cheese & filling on one side and folded it in half instead using two tortillas to make one quesadilla. I would definitely make this again.

I will definitely make this again - it was fast, easy and delicious! I added some grilled chicken, as my meat loving husband thought he needed it. I would like with or without the chicken. One change I would make in the future is to put a layer of cheese on top of the bean mix, then the top tortilla.  I love cheese and it would be less messy.

Love this recipe. I have made it a few times. The first time I made this recipe, I follow the instructions. They were a bit messy ,so the second time I made this recipe, I didn't add the salsa to the mix. Instead, as a topping I used sour cream and fresh tomatoes on top. so good! This is a great twist on a cheese quesadilla. It was a big hit! So full of flavor!

Simple but good. I only put one tsp sugar because I was afraid of it being too sweet. Maybe next time I will add a little more.

It was good but a little bland.  I only used 1 tsp. brown sugar.  I'll make it again but will add jalapenos and cilantro.

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I added sautéed chicken breast bites.  With salsa and sour cream, it was super satisfying!  Even the heated-up leftovers were good.  Will be making this regularly!

We really liked the flavor of these.  I baked mine after brushing the top and bottom generously with olive oil.  Turned out nice and crisp.  Left out the pepper flakes.  Used spicy salsa which gave  plenty of heat for us.

These were delicious and satisfying, even for my meat-loving family. I made them as written (except for using whole-grain tortillas) and I can think of all kinds of variations to change them up. Thanks for the great recipe!

Left out the brown sugar and used spicy salsa.  Do not put any oil or butter in the pan when you have assembled the quesadillas.  There is no need.  Just dry fry them and then flip and do the other side.  Fewer calories too and not greasy.

We liked the idea behind this but we didn't find this very flavourful. It was hard to flip and not lose all the filling too. We won't be making it again.

Made exactly, thought it was pretty good.  I make a different veggie quesadilla but this one was so easy and quick that I will make again.

I found it a bit bland. I added some more salsa, some cilantro. Wasn't a fan of the sugar.  I also served with guacamole as well as salsa and sour cream.

I thought this was great.  I went ahead and made the whole batch since it can be used in plenty of other ways, but we only made three folded-over quesadillas.  The only changes I made were adding about a third of a yellow pepper, not adding butter to the pan, and folding over the tortillas.  This was a nice addition with pineapple salsa chicken.

Hit the spot! Didn't have onions so had to omit them but still turned out great.  Next time I'll be sure to add the onions and maybe some other veggies. Loved it!

These were great!   I used pinto beans instead of black beans because I think they have a more subtle flavor.   I loved the sweetness the brown sugar added.  I will definitely make these again.

Good flavor! I followed the recipe except I left out the unnecessary sugar. The corn adds plenty of sweetness. I will make again! I didn't have 8 tortillas so I ate the extra filling with chips or by itself.

This turned out  good. I did not need to add the red pepper flakes because my salsa was HOT.  Also, I did not use any butter in my pan and I folded my tortillas in half to heat.  I really enjoyed the flavors and will make again. 
 This recipe will  vary depending on the quality of and the  spiciness of the ingredients you use! Take the recipe and work it to what you enjoy!!!

An easy and quick recipe that tastes delicious.  If you want more heat, add some diced jalapenos and/or green chiles.  I also spread some chipotle cream on each tortilla so they would stick better when the cheese melted.  While I thought the brown sugar would make the mixture taste sweet, it gives the right balance with the flavor of the salsa and heat of the pepper flakes.  Definitely will make again as it's easy and the ingredients are inexpensive!

This is a great recipe. Pretty simple to make and I had all the ingredients on hand, except salsa.  I made it without since I was making it for my kiddos. They ate it up, always a good sign!

Easy, delicious and addictive. We are major carnivores, but my husband's cholesterol levels demanded we cut back on meats. So we tried this, and loved it! I did bake them in the oven at 350 degrees for ten minutes instead of frying them individually, as one reviewer suggested. We will definitely make these again.

This is a favorite recipe of both my and husband and I.  I use all the ingredients as listed, but I do not make it the same way.  I always read the reviews before I print a recipe and in this case I wrote a couple of their suggestions down and that is how I make it.  As suggested, I mix the filling and cheese together since it holds together better and I added some cumin.  I also chose to cook the quesadillas in the oven at 350 degrees  for 10 minutes.  I also broil the tops for a short time to brown the tops.  This method works great and I thank the cooks that made these suggestions.  I have made this many times and it is delicious.

Easy to make and yum to eat! My tin of black beans came up a bit short so I made up for it with cubed red bell pepper. I did the assembly in the fry pan as directed, but finished it off in a low temp oven - helped with being able to serve everyone at the same time. Served with Mexican Rice II (from this site) and with the usual fixings (pico de gallo, guacamole and sour cream) for a meatless meal.

Very good!  Did not have any salsa so I used a fresh tomato diced and some Franks sweet chili sauce. Omitted the sugar because the chili sauce was sweet enough. Would be great with some cilantro.

Delicious recipe! I didn't make any modifications, but I was feeling pretty lazy and used onion powder instead. I also used some garlic powder. Came out awesome.

I made this as directed minus red pepper flakes because the kids don't like spicy.  They were fast, easy, and delicious!  So nice to have everything in the pantry already for an inexpensive crowd pleaser.  My husband spiced his up w jalapeños and hot sauce while the rest of us stayed mild. I liked mine w a fruit salsa. Refreshing! Thanks for posting! We folded ours in half to brown on the griddle and lost less beans than stacking the tortillas on top of each other.

I had to restrain myself from eating the bean mixture while I was making these! The quesadillas tasted AMAZING! Parents said these were better than a restaurant!

I love this recipe! My partner and I take turns picking recipes and he picked this one. It turned out to be one of the best recipes we've ever followed! We're both in college, so we don't have a ton of time or money. This recipe is REALLY easy and we usually make extra filling so we can throw it in the fridge or freezer and make more quesadillas throughout the week. I love that they're spicy and sweet as well.

I did use chili powder instead of red pepper flakes and I loved the added spiciness. We also made the quesadillas in a panini press instead of a skillet, it only took about 2 minutes for each one.

Seriously my new favorite quesadilla recipe! Made this recipe exactly as it says and loved it! I'm not a left-overs person and I ate this for three days straight! I'll be sharing this recipe with friends and making these for my husband when he gets home from deployment. Thanks for sharing:)

Very nice and light. I thought it was perfect, my wife thought it was a little bit too spicy, but she's also a wimp.  Very easy and quick to make. Going to try these another day with a different kind of salsa.

Also, we made this with a side of avocado and sour cream, which really added a lot. Highly recommended for future chefs :D

This is a wonderful dish! I bring it to potlucks so that both vegetarian and non-vegetarian eaters can enjoy and I never have left-overs; my coworkers can't get enough of these quesadillas. Truly a favorite at our house as well.

I love these-I followed the recipe exactly, and have repeated this dish several times. If you have a meat-eating person in your life, it is easy to add in chicken or beef. I found that modifying which tortillas you use can save on calories. I found some "healthy" wraps and saved about 100 calories per tortilla. Also, the corn and bean filling is so delicious, it's good on its own. Love it!

I was looking for something quick, easy and filling. oh and delicious! This was all of those things! I had peach salsa on hand which gave it a little extra sweet flavor. yum. next time I will add rice and try Cajun seasoning instead of red pepper. this will be a new go to recipe for me. I could even out it over lettuce for a taco salad. it's so versatile. thank you for sharing!

This is CRAZY delish!!  I used fajita sized tortillas and it made a LOT!  Also, a little tip:  spread a thin layer of Kraft Mayo on the outside of the tortilla before placing them in the pan, instead of the butter. It makes it perfectly crispy and has ZERO flavor, believe it or not!

Followed all the directions , but then basically served these up like Tacos after we cooked the shells.  Very Good, I agree  that the tablespoon of brown sugar really does add something. We like onions we added much more.and served with chopped lettuce tomatoes and  sour cream on the side.  it's a keeper.

Delicious!  I wasn't sure I'd like this but we bought cans of black beans at Costco and needed a way to use them up.  Very surprised at how good it was!  I did the "folder over" method since I'm not a talented "flipper".  Didn't change a thing!  Thanks for the recipe!

My Wife loved this and was even more shocked to find I made a veggie meal! 
I used fresh corn from our local farmer's market and she suggested the brown sugar could be omitted because the corn added so much sweet to the mix. Husked and microwaved two ears for about three minutes till just under-done so it was not mushy after cooking with the other ingredients.  I used LaPreferida organic black beans and they were awesome.
We made tostadas the first night and she made a burrito the next with the leftovers!

This was so good. I added shredded chicken and green onions alongside the regular onion.  I also used a little chili powder with the red pepper flakes and salt and pepper. I think it needed a little bit more spice. Thanks for the recipe! Very filling!

Dry baked instead of buttering it up a frying on a skillet. Also used chipotle sauce with salsa to spice it up further.

We like these so much, I double the recipe. I prefer to fold the tortilla in half after filling, rather than placing another on top and flipping. Either way, they're tasty!

Four out of five of my family members enjoyed these.  I omitted the pepper flakes because my husband can't handle spicy foods and I have small children.  My vegetarian child however didn't like it.  Said she didn't care for the way the flavors blended.  I would make it again.  I thought it was messy but very good!

I've used this recipe for years! Quick, easy and tasty! I tweak to my taste by leaving out the sugar.

Make this all the time, the best.  I add leftover chicken if I have any, otherwise it's fine like it is.

Followed the recipe as written.  Absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to have the left overs for lunch!  Light, crunchy, not too sweet, not to hot.  Fast and easy to make.  Quite filling as well considering there is no meat in this dish. Will definitely add this to my favorite recipes.

So yummy! Perfect for "taco Tuesday" and it was meat free so my daughter was happy. I omitted the red pepper flakes and used cheese more liberally but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Very easy and fast! Topped with salsa verde, fresh pico and sour cream. Will defn be making this again

The super picky hubby loved these and even asked for seconds!
I omitted the brown sugar and the red pepper flakes and added ground cayenne pepper instead. We dipped the finished quesadillas into sour cream and salsa and they were amazing!

I used nonstick spray instead of the butter and oil to lighten it up a bit - I like my fat and calories to come from the cheese! I questioned the brown sugar, but I'm glad I left it in. These were very good.

Excellent. This recipe has become a staple easy, delicious meal for my wife and I. I usually use more onion (maybe a 1/2 cup), omit the red pepper flakes, and top with sour cream.

So easy to throw together, and thrifty too, I sauteed an onion and a pepper first; and threw in a little hot sauce and cilantro.

This makes for a light and tasty meal. Toasted my tortillas with butter and that added a nice warm, crepe-like taste to it. Would definitely be making this again.

This was amazing! I omitted the brown sugar and red pepper flakes and replaced with a few teaspoons of taco seasoning. The butter on the tortilla is a must. It reminded me of the southwest egg rolls I love that I get at a large chain restaurant.

Yummy! I omitted the brown sugar and made them in the oven instead of on the stovetop by brushing the tortillas with butter and putting my quesadillas on a cookie sheet. You can also make these with refried beans as well. Delicious!

I paired this with a broccoli - cranberry salad. Yum. I didn't change the recipe this time, but next time ... and there will be a next time ... the sugar will need to cut down. The corn brings enough sweetness that 1 tbl of sugar is too much for my family.
Thanks for the recipe!

I skipped the onions because I am not a fan. But this meal was easy to make. But if I make it again I will use a half can of beans, more salsa and less sugar. But it was decent.

It is everything we were hoping for. I had frozen the leftovers and the other night had a pretty boring taco salad going on. We heated up the leftover put them in the salad and it was so good. 

I am going to remake it tonight and add chicken then I will make it into a street taco.

Did not add the brown sugar.
 Try adding one chopped chipotle  pepper for extra smoky/spicy flavour.

I cooked the quesadilla on the grill pan on top of the stove rather than saute it in butter.  It turned out perfect and my husband and I loved it. Served with green chili stew - a great combination.

I made these tonight! Because I didn't have black beans, I substituted red and orange bell peppers (it's what I had at the moment) I followed the recipe to a T and it still turned out great! My family loved it! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Super quick and easy to make! Recipe is great as is and easily modified for personal taste. I used cooking spray then added cheese on both top and bottom layers, making it cheesier & easier to flip. I added garlic and coarse black pepper too. Also cut sugar a little to 2 teaspoons and upped red pepper to 1 teaspoon (I love spicy food). Even my veggie averse hubby gave it 2 thumbs up!! Definitely a keeper!!

So simple and so awesome. I've made several times now. I did go without the brown sugar and because I like it extra spicy I added chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.

Made these for dinner tonight they were great! The only thing I did different was use the burrito size and baked in oven, then broiled till a little browned as other reviewers did. We had them with guacamole and sour cream, with roasted red pepper quinoa  on the side. There's so much you could do with them also, Thanks for a great versatile recipe!

Great recipe! It was fast, easy and delicious. My husband and kids loved it. I used more cheese but other than that I stick to the recipe.

Really enjoyed it. Found the quantities insufficient so pretty much doubled it for the same number of tortillas. Also I added some fresh, chopped tomatoes, coriander and jalapeños. Cooked in the oven and served with sour cream

This is a wonderful vegetarian recipe! It was filling and very flavorful. I altered the recipe just a tad. I used about a teaspoon of butter instead of the oil for each quesadilla and I used one tortilla, folded in half, rather than the two on top of each other. The two made it very difficult to flip, but using one tortilla folded in half helped bind it together, making the flipping much easier! I also left out the red pepper flakes and brown sugar. Neither was necessary to complete the flavor profile.

Great supper. It's a bit dense, so I added two tomatoes and a zucchini to balance it. It also needed more spice - cumin, salt, and pepper, all helped bring out the flavors.

This was very tasty. I would recommend putting the cheese and filling on only half of the wrap and then fold over. This makes it much easier to flip over.

I'm definitely going to make this again! I did have to substitute a few things though but it turned out yummy
I added a few seasonings to it to make it have more flavor. First I added Chile powder, then garlic powder, and then a touch of salt. YUM!

I make these all the time, however I grate extra sharp cheddar directly into a non stick pan. I put the tortilla on top and load it up. I then peel it up off the pan, let cool for a couple seconds and it becomes a crunchy shell. We sometimes just make cheese chips this way too ??. The trick is you have to wait until the cheese really starts sticking to the shell. If it's not sticking I'd wait a little longer.

Delicious and so easy.  I did not add the brown sugar to the filling and I did not butter the tortillas, just fried them in a skillet greased with some non stick spray.  Plain cheese quesadillas aren't quite enough to be a meal on their own but putting the black beans and corn into the filling makes these a meal on their own, I will definitely be making these again.

Awesome!  Great for my veggie lover daughter and I added chicken in for the rest of us.  I also used half the amount of brown sugar.  Served with Avocado, sour cream and salsa on the side.

it was good. but i would change a few things the next time i make it. For one this time i used ancient grain tortillas next time ill use white ones. Also i would add more cheese and salsa. for my first time doing it i think it turned out pretty well.i can't wait to make it next time. I found they are a bit messy so the next time i prepare them i will fold the tortilla in half.

This was so yummy! I didn't add the red pepper flakes because I've been a little intolerant of spice since chemo.  I also baked it at 350 for about 15 minutes so we could eat together as a family and it was awesome!  I used some Spinach, Garlic, and Pesto wraps and it was amazing!  Even my picky 3 year old and my almost 2 year old loved them.  I also served with sour cream.  Awesome!

Easy and delicious. To be fair, I had never had a bean quesadilla before so I didn't have much to compare it to, but this exceeded my expectations. I had just moved and had limited ingredients on hand, so the onion got fried, followed by beans, corn, and salsa. I was worried that the quesadilla would fall apart when I tried to flip it, but apparently cheese is a really good glue.

What's not to love here?! Customize to your tastes, have fun with it. I shaved the corn off of 4 ears after I boiled them. I used mesquite marinared chix breasts that I diced up real fine. Added green pepper, green onions, white onions, black beans, fresh cilantro & shredded pepper jack & cojack cheeses. I should've added more cheese as I believe more would've held these together better. Once folded over taco style, I used toothpicks to hold them together. I made a triple batch of these, trying a few different things. I opted out of the stovetop method & used my oven. First 2 batches I panned out on 2 foil lined baking sheets. I baked these on 450 for 20 min. I should've baked a lil longer for a crispier "crust." Still a golden blonde crust. The second time around, I baked 4 quesadillas.- 2 on top of another laid side by side in a glass pyrex 9x13 pan. This method took a lot longer to obtain the crisp golden crust. Baked at 450 for 30 mins! Next time I will add diced tomato & jalapenos. Delicioso!!

I added a couple of small sweet peppers and I omitted the butter; I used my panini maker to grill.

I make this twice a month for meatless Monday. The black beans are plenty of protein even for my boyfriend. I usually broil them in the oven on low and then fold it over or add the top tortilla. To get that fried look, you can spray a 1 second spray of olive oil cooking spray over the top tortilla and broil on high until you like the color. Usually 1 min for me. I use a pizza cutter to get perfect triangles.

I just realized I hadn't reviewed this...but this recipe has been in my normal rotation since I first tried it years ago.  I make this at least once a month.  I've tried different variations and they were excellent (switch up the cheeses or veggies depending on what I have on hand - but I always have the black beans and at least some corn).  The only change I make on a regular basis is to use the Foreman instead of in a skillet because it's so much easier.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe is amazing! I used stevia instead of brown sugar. And I made my own homemade salsa. (Once you make your own, the stuff in the jar doesn't cut it anymore). And this is knock your socks of good and easy too!! Definitely putting this one in the rotation.

I'm the kind of guy who doesn't consider a meal to be a meal unless it contains meat, and boy did this recipe change my mind.  Even my extremely picky picky girlfriend loved these!  I added some diced fresh jalapenos and a dash of cumin while cooking.  As many reviewers have already stated, the easiest way to make a quesadilla is to use one tortilla and fold it in half and then just flip it along the fold when you need to (much cleaner that way).  Definitely a new go-to vegetarian meal in our house, thank you!

I used frozen corn and should have left out the sugar. They were sweet enough on their own. Also should have made them on one tortilla and folded it, they were too hard to flip. I also piled guac and pico on top. Yum!

When making this recipe i left out the brown sugar since i didn't want the extra sweetness and i left out the red pepper flakes so the kids would eat.  This was really good and i will be making again.

These are yummy, but don't stay together very well. I've started using the recipe for burritoes instead and I just add rice to it. It seems to hold together better that way!

My husband and I really like this. I've made it twice, now, following the recipe both times, except I added a pressed garlic clove with the onion and I  buttered the fry side of the tortillas as thinly as possible. They browned better that way. And sprinkle the cheese on the bottom and top of the filling and the tortillas will stick a bit better. They're still "goodly messy" but so good.  9/18/17  Still good.

It was overall pretty good. I am not a very experienced cook which may have contributed to my rating of 4 stars instead of 5. :) I only used about half the recommended brown sugar and didn't have any of the pepper flakes, so I used a slightly spicier salsa to make up for it. I recommend it, its easy and fast to make.

Excellent! Followed it to a T & was great!! I use 1&3/4 tsp of turbinado (brown) sugar now. I've only changed that after making this many times, bc it's a huge hit. But that's just my preference. But everyone else loved it & I've shared recipe dozens of times-- always pleased & can't believe how easy to make! Was dinner again tonite actually

These are absolutely delicious. My husband nor I are vegetarian but I've been trying to find vegetarian meals to cook every now and again. My husband's a huge meat lover but he gobbled these up in no time. In fact, we both couldn't seem to get enough! I didn't change anything other than doubling up on the black beans and corn. That way we had (some) leftovers ;) It's incredibly simple ingredients but who knew they would be so delicious all together? It doesn't take long to make either and it's a real life saver when I've been at work all day. Thank you so much for sharing, it's become a staple in our home!

This was absolutely delicious, even with whole wheat tortillas. The filling is good enough to eat by itself.

I made these today for lunch, and oh my gosh it was delicious. I changed the salsa to about a half a cup and added a bit more red pepper flakes and it was perfect. So yummy, so easy to make, the filling is delicious. Really such an easy recipe for a quick lunch/dinner.

This was a great recipe! It was messier than expected, with some of the filling falling out of the sides for the first batch, but came out very delicious! It was very filling even without meat. I could barely finish my plate! I'll make it again.

Everyone loved this.  I made it with frozen corn (thawed) instead of canned and omitted the sugar.  Also added a bit more salsa. Paired it with refried beans and guacamole.  Everyone said to make it again soon.

Super easy and quick to make.  I added a bit of canned chicken (Costo/Kirkland brand) and it tasted delicious.  Will definitely keep this one on hand for Mexican night.  LOVE IT!!!

Delicious!  I added some chopped baby spinach and roasted green peppers and omitted the red pepper flakes.  Cooked them in my quesadilla cooker so omitted the butter.

Added a diced sweet potato and left out the sugar. Delicious!  Will try baking them as suggested in other reviews, as it was a bit time consuming doing them one by one in the skillet.

These were simple and delicious.  I did everything exactly as the recipe states, except I added a 4 ounce can of spicy diced green chiles and did 1/2 sharp cheddar cheese and 1/2 pepper jack cheese.  I was a little apprehensive about flipping a whole quesadilla, so I folded it in half, which made turning it over much easier.  My husband, a meat and potatoes kind of guy, loved these and requested I make them again.

Extraordinary, yummy, satisfying, pretty.  I soaked and cooked my own black beans and corn, and used organic wheat tortillas and organic cheddar cheese.  Though I am not a vegetarian, I do enjoy vegetarian meals, and this is one that I will have regularly....and feel confident to serve to others.  I didn't use the red pepper flakes, for I do not care for "heat."  If I had had on hand a quality mild salsa, that - to me - would have been like icing on a cake.

This recipe is one of our favorites!  Easy to make and hearty!  I did not add the brown sugar the corn was sweet enough and I also added green pepper with the onion.  I also baked these in the oven so did not use the butter.

I love this recipe. It's so quick, so easy, and so healthy. The second time I made them, I forgot to add the sugar, and I didn't even notice. They're delicious.  I like to slice the finished quesadillas into quarters and then "dip" them into the salsa or salsa/sour cream for added yumminess.

Used fresh corn and cooked with the onions. Also skipped the pepper flakes as I used a hot salsa. Delicious! Used cooking spray for tortillas, didn't miss the butter. A keeper!

This was delicious and so easy!  I used frozen corn, 1/2 tbsp brown sugar, and left out the red pepper flakes because my homemade salsa is pretty spicy.  Oh, and I was out of onion so I just used dehydrated onion flakes.  I had some basmati rice left over from last night's dinner so I added some lime juice, cilantro, and cumin and added that to some of the quesadillas.  Yum!!

A good starting point.  Not enough flavor though.  Needs more spices and cheese, etc.  Turned out nice 'n crispy.  Made 2 large ones in 2 lg. pans and split between our family of 4.  Would modify if made again.

We love these and have used this recipe several times. I halve the sugar. I skip the red pepper flakes and put in a chopped jalepeno. I serve these with salad or veggie soup, and fruit or sorbet for dessert.

Absolutely love this recipe.  I make this recipe as it is written and it comes out perfect every time.   The only alterations I make is with what kind of salsa I decide to use.  It is great over rice as well.

I made this today for lunch. It was a great experience in the kitchen. I'm a big fan of spicy so I was abit stand off on the brown sugar but used it anyways and added more spice. I included 1/4 a tablespoon of spicy Szechuan five spice by Asia  and I dd two cans of black beans to one corn and a can of diced tomato in garlic and onion then added 1-4 more salsa and left out the onion because I didn't have it. Very very good it was a save the day last minute recipe I had it all ready in under 30 minutes. We made a dipping sauce out of sour cream and schirracha sauce it was differently delicious

Simple and semi-healthy.  I suggest using whole wheat tortilla shells, dry black beans prepared, frozen corn, and adding some chopped peppers.  Makes them even healthier.  You don't need to fold them or bake them.  Just make sure to put half the cheese down, then the topping, then the rest of the cheese and smash.  You can flip it onto a pan, plate, or lid and then back to the other side on the stove. And do it on medium-high, not medium.

Very easy and tasty. I used corn tortillas and half of the butter, added chopped jalapeño and a bit of homemade taco seasoning. Very difficult to flip over, the mixture falls out, ate with a fork and knife. Sour cream and extra salsa On the side.

Put mangos in this meal instead of salsa and brown sugar and it was a winner!

My family loved this recipe.  It is so simple to make and easy to add other ingredients to as well.  My husband was skeptical because of the beans (he's not a fan of beans), but he asked me to make it again this week. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a super quick favorite in my house, the only thing I change is folding a tortilla in half instead of using one on the bottom and one on the top.  It's just easier to flip that way.  Very tasty and filling!

I love these.  I make them a lot.  Only thing is, they must be eaten with a fork because they're usually too thick to stay together.  Also, they're very filling.

They are correct this dish is delish quick and easy!  Just be careful with the cooking time so you don't burn the brown sugar. I first cooked chicken in the skillet with onions red and green peppers. I also folded the tortilla in half which made it fuller and easier to flip.

I have made this several times.  It's a great recipe for using up pantry ingredients.  I make it as is.  The only thing is that it makes a lot more quesadillas than it says it will.  That's okay.  I just save the filling in the fridge, and it makes a quick lunch the next day.

These are THE BEST quesadillas EVER! We made these for vegetarian friends last night, everyone LOVED them. Thankfully we made a lot so we had leftovers today! I plan to make these again for family when they come to visit! The only thing we did differently was to omit the sugar, the corn makes it plenty sweet.

My first time making quesadillas.  I really enjoyed these....my fiancé' who " doesn't like Mexican food" thought these were fantastic. I watched the video to help with flipping the quesadilla while cooking. I also think putting cheese below and on top of the filling before you put on the top quesadilla and letting it melt a few minutes before flipping helps keeps the contents from spilling out.

These were delicious. I used agave nectar instead of brown sugar (2 tsp) and 1/2 tsp cumin as well. I did what many people suggested and baked them at 350 for 8min. I will definitely make these again!

We all loved this dish! I have a teenage boy who has a bottomless pit for a stomach; he ate one and was satisfied. Definitely will serve this again. I made one small addition of finely diced green bell pepper in equal amt to the onion.

These were great!!  I omitted the red pepper flakes (salsa was enough spice), and baked/toasted the quesadillas in the toaster oven.  We topped with guac, sour cream, and more salsa.  Delicious!!

This is a good recipe but I made a few changes.  My family did not like the sweetness of this so I did not add brown sugar.  I added cumin and "Rooster sauce" to give it a little kick!!!  My family loved it!!!  Will be making it more often!!  This is a very filling meal and inexpensive!

We prefer it with less-to-no brown sugar (spicier instead of sweeter), otherwise, this is terrific.  Sometimes we'll eat this as suggested, other times we'll add chicken or steak and all the fixins.  Lately, we use this instead of refried beans, saving us all those calories and the sodium.  Oh the sodium!

So I added a handful of cilantro when it was finished and that added a lot of flavor.  I added about 2 teaspoons of cumin to the onions and also added salt, pepper, and the red pepper flakes to the onion.  Tip:  If you mash up the bean mixture while it's cooking, the contents won't spill out when you flip it.  I like it all a little mashed up, it's not just chunks of beans that way.  

Great, easy, and healthy recipe!  I would give it a 4.5 for an easy weeknight meal.  Just have some sour cream on hand, and some guacamole to add on top for even more flavor.   Also this made barely enough for 4 quesadillas, I highly recommend doubling the recipe for left overs. It would probably taste great tortilla chips baked in the oven.

Enjoyed having this quick and easy-to-prepare meal during the weak.  My king requested me to make the quesadillas again and as he ate the last bite he said, "This one's a keeper. Good job babe!"

I followed this recipe exactly except for frying it. I baked and broiled it according to the instructions from other reviewers. It was delicious and so easy!  I will make this again for sure.

It was a very easy and good recipe. One of my kids doesn't like black beans or corn so I just put baked beans and cheese,and he liked it a lot. I highly recommend this recipe for people who like tacos,tortillas,and grilled cheese.

These are DELICOUS. The ONLY tweak I made was adding chicken seasoned with Goya Adobo. They even made great leftover lunch on second day. Everyone raved and I can still taste them! Very simple, too.

Made this as an easy weeknight dinner, it was delicious! Only thing I did different was adding in some shredded chicken because my family are not vegetarians. So easy and filling too!

I am the vegetarian in the family; however, my husband and 15 year old LOVED these!  I mixed all the ingredients but the hot peppers and onions and made my son's first and then added them before preparing for my husband and I.  A do again for sure!

Made this according to the directions but without the red pepper flakes since we don't like heat. It was pretty good but lacking oomph (probably because of the lack of red pepper) so next time I think I'll try green onions and adding a little cilantro. Great base recipe that I'll return to, and I was skeptical about the brown sugar but liked it in the end.

This ranks among my family's favorites. We generally use corn tortillas, and spray Pam instead of oil. I mix up a batch and stick in fridge. The boys make it for themselves for lunch or a snack. They beg me to make it.

Great recipe! Loved the hint of sweet from the brown sugar! Do NOT leave it out! I baked mine in the oven then broiled for a minute or two to get the tops brown.

Best quesadillas I've ever had! I added grilled chicken (which I pre-seasoned with Tony Chachere's). My honey devoured them and we both agree we've never eaten better quesadillas. Will make this often!

I used 11 oz of mexicorn instead of regular corn.  The brown sugar blended nicely. I also used the red pepper flakes and it wasn't spicy.  This was excellent.

This was extremely easy to make and my husband and 2yr old daughter loved it. I made more than the recipe called for and used frozen corn instead of canned, but it still worked out and tasted great.

This was really good and filling; providing protein in the black beans so it didn't need any meat. Did not add onions as a preference, but stayed true to the recipe for the rest. I believe the grandkids will like these as well. Oh! I also mixed salsa w/ sour cream to dip the Quesadillas. That was yummy!

These were a huge hit at my house!  I lightly butter the top tortilla before flipping to ensure both sides brown up equally.  Otherwise, this recipe is good just as written.  Thanks for sharing, EFasse!

This is a very tasty dish! I decided to try something new for dinner and these were simple and so good. My mom, sister, and my sister's boyfriend enjoyed them as well! I'm not big on meat (eat it once or twice a week)but my family is so I added some ground turkey to it for them and it turned out to be a great addition! When writing the ingredients for this recipe down I somehow wrote mozzarella instead of Monterrey jack and when I realized my mistake (after returning from the store of course) I decided to use some pepper jack cheese that I had instead which worked well. I also put a small amount of butter directly on one side of each tortilla (instead of in the skillet) to ensure the tortilla would be more evenly browned and crisp. Other than those few adjustments, I kept the recipe as is and think it turned out great! Thanks for sharing this yummy treat. :)

I used the recipe as a guideline only, after reading the reviews.  They made sense.  I sauteed black refried beans, frozen corn (no need to thaw), green onions, then add cumin, cayenne, generous shakes of Tapatio, and salt and pepper.  Heat all that thoroughly, then spread the thick paste onto half the raw flour tortilla, cover with medium cheddar (my preference) and lightly brown on both sides.  I rate my recipe a 5!

Thanks you so much for this lovely recipe,EFasse. I added 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1/4 tsp of coriander.  I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese so I used mixed blend Italian (wonderful).  I used 4 burrito size tortillas and baked in the oven 350 degrees for 8 minutes and then broiled until toasty on the middle rack.  Awesome!!! Topped with peach salsa and sour cream.  I will defintely use this recipe again and again!!

These were very good!  Next time I think I will try cutting back the brown sugar to just a teaspoon as I thought they might be a little sweet for my tastes.  However, we still enjoyed them very much and thought they were as good or better than we get at restaurants.  Thanks for sharing, EFasse!

Wow, the brown sugar makes the recipe!  My husband and I loved these!  I've made quesadillas with corn and beans before, but they have never tasted this good.  I do not use the butter at all.  The tortillas get nice and brown on their own.

Such a unique and wonderful flavor. This is gonna be a regular in our house:) I actually used black refried beans (homemade) instead of canned beans, green onion instead of onion and a little tapatillo instead of salsa... oh man so good.

This was such a great recipe. I have recently decided to stop eating land animals and I am looking for alternatives to things I normally eat. These were just as good as chicken quesadillas. 

I added taco seasoning, garlic, tomatoes and a little salsa to the filling. 

They were great.

This was very good.  I didn't change anything, but next time I will just dump the whole 15oz can of corn.  And definitely I take the other reviewers' advice - I sprayed the tortillas and put it in the office at 400 for 10minutes and broiled it for couple more.  Yummy!  Update 1-1-2018: As you can see I've been making this for several years. I still sautee the onions, but now I just dump drained cans of corn and black bean w the salsa into the onion pan. No sugar needed. I then sandwich this filling between cheese and tortilla. My family size has more than doubled so the oven is the only way to go.

I didn't have high expectations for such a simple recipe but boy was I pleasantly surprised!  This was awesome!  Even my boyfriend who isn't a fan of black beans loved it!  Only change - added diced grilled chicken, left everything else as stated.

I made these for dinner and they were delicious!  We are not vegetarians but we try to do 3 dinners a week with no meat so that's why I selected these.  My husband and I both really liked them.  I will definitely make them again and I might add a little cumin and cilantro to the bean and corn mixture.

Made this for my boyfriend and he loved it! I used a whole wheat tortilla which was a little thin but still tasted great.  I used about 1/4 cup less beans and 1/3 less of the corn.  I also was able to use it in my quesadilla maker and it worked great.  Will surely make again!

Very good.  Made it exactly as written, but took the extra step of browning one side of the tortilla first, flipping it, and then adding the filling-as another reviewer suggested.  This made them extra crunchy,

This is a tasty quesadilla and a good way to introduce vegetarian food to my carnivorous husband (who went back for seconds).  The reason for only four starts is  that while it tastes good, I think with the addition of a couple of ingredients it could be phenomenal.  I will experiment with adding cilantro, lime, and/or cumin next time.  It needs just a little more pop of flavor.

This was delicious! And very easy to make. I think this might become a new weeknight dinner staple for me.

I made two minor changes: garlic instead of onion & taco sauce instead of salsa. 

It was definitely a hit! Delicious, easy, and filling. I had it with some sour cream for dipping.

Great base! I would have never thought to add brown sugar. Perhaps I will use a little less next time. My additions: garlic, pickled jalapenos, cumin, chili powder, freshly ground black pepper, and cayenne. I also mashed the beans after they cooked (personal preference).

Excellent recipe and no meat, so frugal.  Has made it into my regular rotation of meals.  And is also great for leftovers.  The only change I made was to use hot sauce instead of the pepper flakes.  I'm sure the effect is the same.

Always a big hit in my household!  Sometimes will add a bit of canned chicken to make a non-vegetarian version.  Changes that I consistently make include 1) adding some ground red pepper as well as the red pepper flakes (I have a red pepper addiction), 2) using only one tortilla per quesadilla and folding it in half for the cover (makes better portion sizes), and 3) lightly coat the top of the tortilla in EVOO and grate fresh Parmesan on top before cooking in the oven at 350 until the tortilla is nice and golden crispy - roughly 10-15min (produces a crispier result than pan frying in butter, and requires no flipping).  I also love sour cream, so I use this as a garnish.  May try adding cilantro next time.

I added a some chicken breast (cooked and cubed) to this recipe. The flavor was delicious.  However, rather than cooking the quesadilla on the stove, I use our pizza dish.  I normally flip the quesadilla after about 5 minutes.  It gives it a nice crispy shell.  Yum!  Thank you for sharing!

Made as a side dish to Blendtec's tortilla soup.  Also cooked a couple chicken breasts to shred and add to soup.
Used coconut oil in place of both the olive oil and butter. 
Followed all other ingredients except for adding an extra 1/4 cup of salsa (1/4 cup bottled and 1/4 cup fresh) and a cheddar jack cheese mix.
Followed others suggestions to bake instead of frying.  Brushed outside of tortilla with melted coconut oil and placed on tin-foiled cookie sheet. Sprinkled cheese on one side, added bean mixture and sprinkled more cheese on top then folded in half. Was able to cook 3 at time for 10 min at 350 and broiled for 2 more.  
Perfect compliment to the soup and will definitely make again.

This is a fantastic and easy recipe. I added 1-2 Tbsp of chopped cilantro to the bean and corn mix after I removed it from the stove and was glad for it. Traditional quesadilla garnish of chopped lettuce, sour cream and salsa made it a perfect meal.

Pretty good. My son's never had black beans before and he ate it. It was a little too sweet for my liking as the corn was sweet as well, but it definitely was interesting. Will make again!

This was an excellent recipe. I'm not a fan of beans but being vegetarian they are an important part of my diet. I mashed them then cooked as directed. Perfect! I used fake cheese for my lactose-intolerant dtr, and that worked perfectly well too.

On my, These are excellent!  I followed  another poster's suggestion and baked them rather than fried, and I used Canola oil spray.  Didn't use the red pepper because I was using Monterey Jack cheese (had it but no plain Jack cheese).  The brown sugar really adds.  these will bee a new staple.  Thanks for sharing.

Super! I made the beans in the pressure cooker and you don't need butter to warm up the tortillas, they're not crepes! I'll ask a friend for a recipe for tortillas she makes herself. My husband loved it!

I have tried this recipe twice and it has been delicious both times. I have been omitting the salsa because I like to put it on top rather than inside the quesadillas. I bake the quesadillas so they are done simultaneously.

After the first time, I froze the corn and blackbean filling to use again later and it came out wonderful after cooking, so if you aren't making for a big group like me, don't be worried about having left over filling.

I thought they were great - tasty and filling.  I subbed sharp cheddar for the monterey jack, just because that's what I had.  I also added a little sprinkle of chili powder.  It was extremely quick and easy - perfect for a hectic weeknight.

I made these for Teacher Appreciation week at my son's preschool and it was a hit!  I used Kraft's Santa Fe Blend Cooking Creme (in dairy section) to spread on before adding bean/corn/salsa mixture - this was a huge tasty addition - added some "heat" to it instead of using pepper flakes. This is a must keep recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

These quesadillas were fabulous! I was skeptical about that brown sugar at first, but I could hardly tell that it was there when I ate the finished product. My fiance is a big meat eater and he usually isn't wild about meatless dishes, but these were delicious and filled both of us up using inexpensive ingredients! I will absolutely make these again.

This recipe tasted great!! I was a bit worried about adding in the brown sugar as I've tried bean recipes before that called for sugar that tasted horrible.  Since I'm a vegetarian and my husband is not I'm always looking for recipes that we both can enjoy insteaad of making two seperate meals. He loved it and didn't even mind that there was no meat. I'll be adding this one into the weekly menu. I did add in some garlic and brown them in the oven versus on the stove top. Don't forget the salsa and sour cream for dipping once they are ready to serve.

Just made this last week and it was yummy.  Did add shredded chicken thighs (for hubby) and increased the red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon.  Also used whole wheat flour tortillas and Mexican cheese as that is what I had on hand.  I folded them as it was easier for me to handle.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the easy recipe.

Excellent, simple quick recipe. Big hit at my house. Can add chicken for the non vegetarians. I've made this 3 times now in the past 2 weeks. Huge success.

Oh.  My, these were yummy!  They'll be a keeper in my recipe rotation for meals!

My changes - left out pepper flakes, since I was also making them for my 21-month old, and used thawed frozen corn instead of canned.

Made this last night, was great!  I did add left over grilled chicken breast.  I mixed the filling, added the chicken and cooked on top of stove in lightly sprayed skillet.  Definitely going to add this to the regular rotation for leftover usuage!  thanks!

This was quick and delish! I skipped the onions and  used a can of Carribbean Style Black Beans that has red bell peppers, Anaheim chili peppers, onions, lime juice, and carribbean sauce along with the black beans. Soooo good and very filling.

I made them last night and they were fabulous! I made a few modifications. I added 1 TBSP Chili Powder and 1/4 Tsp of Cumin to the salsa and brown sugar and mixed thoroughly before adding to the beans, corn and sauteed onions. I also added a can of green chilis. Instead of frying I used a 9x14 baking pan. I covered it in foil and baked at 350 for 20 min. I then removed the foil and baked an additional 10 min uncovered. Everyone loved them. I won't hesitate to make them again.

This was very tasty...to make it easier for me, and less messy, I used burrito-sized tortillas and used one tortilla folded over for each quesadilla. To help the black bean/corn mixture stay inside the tortilla, I placed a little cheese on the tortilla, added the beans/corn, then topped it with more cheese. Worked great! I also added shredded chicken for my carnivore husband!

Totally LOVED these.  They were so easy.  The cook time is deceiving.  Since there are only 2 of us, it only took me 5 minutes to cook up 2 quesadillas.  We saved the rest of the filling for lunches and snacks.  Once you make the filling, you can make these in no time whenever you get hungry.  Great for on the go families and teenagers!

We loved it!  I did not even attempt to use two tortillas, I folded each one in half.  Served with yellow rice and a salad.  Nice change of pace.

My whole family loved this, even the pickiest of eaters!!!  The only change I made was adding chicken to it (since I can't get away with not having any meat in a meal)

This was seriously soooo good!  I love the filling, I had a hard time not eating it by itself!  I bet it would be awesome on top of a green salad!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Loved this recipe!  I left out the red pepper flakes because I didn't have any.    I also skipped the oil, and use garlic flavored veg oil spray to brown the Quesadillas.   We topped ours with sour cream, onions, black olives and salsa.  Yummm....

Wow I really did not enjoy these. Pretty sure it was the brown sugar that destroyed them. Couldn't get over how brown sugar and cheese tasted together. Will not be making again.

Very good! I omitted the brown sugar and used around a cup and half of salsa. We used our quesadilla maker. Yum! Next time I will add a touch of sour cream in the mixture.

Very good base recipe.  I took others suggestions and decreased amount of brown sugar, but wish I wouldn't have - I didn't notice anything sweet about it.  I added shredded pork for my meat loving husband who usually doesn't eat corn and he loved it! This recipe allows for so many variations that I can't wait to make it again.  This is definitely moving into the rotation.

I didn't change anything about the recipe, but the beans I used were spiced in the can, and I used low carb tortillas.  These turned out delicious.  I might try adding tomatoes, but they were good as is.  Thanks for sharing - excellent!

These were good but I think I will add chicken next time and probably omit the brown sugar.  The corn and the brown sugar make it just a little too sweet.  These were a good "starter' recipe.....there are many directions you can go with it!!

I let the kids assemble and grill these on the Foreman grill, they loved it. We didn't use the brown sugar. We used the Mexican blend shredded cheese as the only substitution.

Delicious and very easy to make. I baked them in the oven like someone else suggested. I will make these again!

these are good but next time I will definitely use fresh corn off the cob because canned corn just has that canned taste that I don't like. then these would be perfect. I also used half a medium sized onion. didn't have red pepper flakes so left them out, and used pam cooking spray instead of butter when frying the quesadillas.

Wonderful!  We didn't have salsa, so we used some Rotel (drained) in place of it, which worked perfect.  We also used frozen corn since that's what we had.  And while frying it in butter isn't the most healthy option (as opposed to the olive oil we usually use) it sure is de-lic-ious!!!  The salty-buttery goodness coating the outside definitely makes it.  Definitely full of flavor and a keeper of a recipe!

I thought this might be a little boring & almost didn't make it but I didn't have much in the house for dinner & I'm so glad I did! It was cheap, pretty healthy & delicious! I did add some diced jalepenos to the corn/black bean mixture. Will definately make this over & over!

This recipe was so simple and yet so delicious! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except I substituted flour tortillas for wheat and I also used chipotle pepper seasoning instead of the red pepper flakes. The chipotle seasoning is a little smokey and paired very nicely with the brown sugar. I will make this recipe again and again and again!

This recipe was delicious! A little sweet but when it's topped with spicy salsa it's perfect. My meat loving husband was very skeptical but after giving a try he loved them. I will be making this again

These were great. I made this last night for dinner ALMOST exactly as recipe calls for. I did take other reviewer's hints and added some lime juice and cumin and used frozen corn because that's what I had on hand. I also had half a green pepper in the fridge that needed to be used so diced that up and cooked it with the onion. I think you do need more than the 1 1/2 cups of cheese the recipe calls for. I used 2 cups and think it could have used even more than that. (My husband ate the leftovers cold the next day and told me they were great cold too.)

Delicious, easy, and filling! I've always been a fan of chicken quesadillas, but I certainly don't miss the meat. Be careful with the corn and beans when you filp them over though--they tend to scatter if you're not careful.

So tasty. I just made these for lunch with minor changes. I cooked the onions for a couple of minutes then added a clove of minced garlic. I used fresh corn and homemade salsa. Also added cumin to the bean/corn mixture and stirred in a couple pinches of salt just before serving. Extra good with corn tortillas. This was a hit with everyone around our table. I think I might add pinto beans next time too.

We all loved this, even the 4 year old!  The only change I made was to use about a cup of frozen corn instead of the canned.  Served with tortilla chips and Simple Guacamole from this site.  Next time I may have to double to recipe to have easy leftovers for lunch during the week.

These make for a tasty and quick meal. I didn't bother to measure the onion; I just used a whole small one and used pepper jack cheese, so I didn't add the pepper flakes. Like other reviewers, I also baked at 350* for 10 min, and then broiled till golden.

I've never made a recipe using beans before (never ate anything either) and this pleasantly surprised me that I would WANT to keep eating beans :)  I said it deserves 5 stars but my husband said 4 (and he's anti-beans so that is an excellent rating for him).  I followed directions exactly.

Very good, quick, meal.  I threw this together in just a few minutes and it was quite tasty.  I added cumin and garlic powder.  I also used frozen corn with no problems.  Glad to have another meatless meal to add to my recipes.

The filling was good, but nothing exceptional.  I made these with the "Homemade Flour Tortillas" recipe, dried black beans and a little extra butter/cheese.  It made for a fine dinner.

My family loved this recipe!  The caramalized onions and brown sugar make kids love it.  I used frozen corn (thawed) as canned corn has an entirely different flavor.  Served w/ a Rotel/sour cream mix as garnish.  Super!!  We will certainly make this again.

These were great!!  I couldn't bring myself to put the brown sugar in though . . . I'm sure it's great that way but at the last second when I was about to do it, I just couldn't-I like my savory food to be savory and I was worried it would be too sweet.  I didn't miss it but I may try it sometime just to see the difference.  Even without that though, these were great, easy, inexpensive and we all enjoyed them.  I think they are probably divine cooked in butter as recommended but I too took the oven bake and broil route.  I topped them with shredded iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, avocado, sour cream, & salsa.  Delicious!!!  I had some leftover filling which I ate on top of green lettuce blend today for lunch, topped with some cheese and used salsa as a dressing, it was so good!  This is something I will definitely make again!

We love Mexican food.  This is now a new family favorite.  I could not make the fast enough.  The only changes I made was adding our favorite hot sauce, using cheddar (because that is what I had) and I cooked them in a pan with non-stick cooking spray.

I love this recipe, but I tweaked it a little based on another quesadilla recipe I found on allrecipes. I diced up a peeled sweet potato (large), boiled it (20 min) and mashed it. I mixed the mashed sweet potato with the corn and black bean mixture that I had simmering for ~20 min, since I like my beans broken down a bit.  I then made the quesadillas with corn tortillas and extra sharp cheddar (half of it was low-fat cheese).  I always use corn and black bean medium salsa and the sweet potato really neutralizes any bite from the salsa.  If you like your bite and want to use sweet potato, I would suggest a hotter salsa.  I also simplify it, just using 1 can salasa, 1 can corn, 1 can black beans, 1 sweet potato with cheese and tortillas.

My husband and I enjoyed these quesadillas.  I reduced the brown sugar slightly and shredded a chicken breast which I added in with the black beans.  I put them in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes instead of using the skillet.

Easy and delicious! I added some green pepper and did a layer of cheese on both ides of the bean mix but otherwise followed the recipe. The best part is you can put the filling in the fridge and heat it up to make a fresh quesadilla later.

The filling was good, but messy as a quesadilla. I tried the leftovers as burritos, and it was great -- and less fattening!

I love this quesadilla recipe! I reduced the pepper slightly but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was great with whole wheat tortillas.  Even my 3-year-old enjoyed it.  I had some of the leftover filling with brown rice with cheese on top.

Wow! These really hit the spot! I followed the recipe exactly, except added 1/2 c salsa instead of 1/4 c. They were soooo good. I made them in my quesadilla maker! I'm excited to have extra filling so I can make them again this week! It was the perfect lunch! I might double the recipe next time and freeze in single servings so they're easy to heat up and make on short notice. Thanks for the recipe! Will make again and again!

This was so amazing! I just got done making and eating this great recipe. I didn't add the onion as I'm not a fan and I used mexi-corn. Didn't use any butter to heat the tortillas either. I've never had black beans before so was skeptical, but it was wonderful! And I'm stuffed. LOL Thank you!!!

Great!! I made my own bean in the crockpot.  I cup black beans w/1 tsp salt, cover with water on high for 4 hours.  Also added a bit of cumin for a Mexican flare.  They were delish!!  My teenage girls & husband all loved them.  Definately will make again.  Goes great with homemade tomatoe soup!

Heaven on a plate!  This was an absolutely delicious treat.  Took the advice of many of the other reviewers, and added a bit of taco seasoning to the mix.  Also baked the quesos instead of frying - didn't need cooking spray or oil as the tortillas crisped up nicely on their own.  Instead of folding, I sliced each 10" tortilla in half, piled filling on one side and simply topped with other half of tortilla.  Served with fresh avocado salad, sour cream, cilantro and shredded lettuce.  Delish!

I was hesitant to make these because my husband misses his meat in a meal. But our whole family, carnivore included, LOVED these. We now cook them a couple of times a month.

Couldn't believe I got my husband to eat a meal not including meat, but he survived! Used less brown sugar ~2tsp. and added 1/2tsp. cumin for a nice taste. I folded the tortillas over for easier flipping. You can also bake at 350 for 10 minutes, broiling for a minute to brown the tops at the end--especially useful if you need to feed a bunch of people at one time.

I love this recipe, it's a little different every time I make it, but always is yummy!  I make it every week or so, and any leftovers are saved to serve over corn chips and salsa.  It's even better the next day.  My picky meat-loving partner even liked it!  I have had success with stovetop or oven made quesadillas, just be sure to turn the oven to at least 400*F.

Good recipe for sure!  I opted for the folded versions, and did them in the oven so I didn't have to wait for more :)  A little bland for my tastes, but that's easily adjusted with some hot sauce and sour cream.  I'm thinking next time I'll go with some others and throw in a jalepeno or habenero to give it some kick!  Definite keeper though!

Awesome!! I didn't add the pepper flakes because of the kids & I used peach salsa which I would highly recommend.  For some of them I used leftover spicy shredded beef. They were pretty messy but delicious.

These are fabulous!  I have been looking for some protein-packed vegetarian options that are tasty enough to make my meat and potatoes loving, veggie-hating husband to enjoy with me and this fits the bill! He liked them more than the chicken quesadillas he normally loves.  I also made them for a pot-luck get together and they were a big hit.  Great with red wine, and great re-heated as leftovers.

These are pretty basic, but for some reason are incredibly tasty!! I'm not a big meat fan, but I think that these would be appealing to most anyone. They say beans and corn are a popular combination for vegetarians because they deliver an important group of vitamins that work better if consumed at the same time. Would be tasty with avocado.

These were very good. I made a mess when flipping so I just put a little on one tortilla and folded it over and that helped keep the filling in.

I omitted the brown sugar and added a bit of cumin instead, since I'd rather not add sugar to anything other than dessert.  I also baked them at 350F for 10 minutes and then broiled them for 5 minutes, as suggested by other reviewers.  A nice, hearty twist on an old favorite.  The toppings completed the meal nicely.

This will become a dinnertime staple.  Super great, healthy meal.  I just started using dried beans recently and after following the quick soak recommendation on the bag, I threw them into a crockpot, covered them with water, added a bay leaf and some salt and pepper.  3 hours on high later, I had really, really yummy black beans that were better than any canned I have ever had.  They were great in this recipe~

What a quick and tasty meal !   Although my hubbie is a "meat eater", he enjoyed this very much.  I too, added  just a touch of  brown sugar, as well as some Cumin to taste.   I will definitely make this again.  Even though this is a vegetarian dish next time I think I will added some shredded chicken ( to make the hubbie happy).  :)

I liked this one...different though. I used frozen corn instead of canned, totally omitted the butter and doubled the amount of salsa in the mix. The brown sugar added a very slight sweetness while the hot pepper flakes balanced it out with a lil heat. Served with low fat sour cream and extra salsa. Will make again. Thanks!

Very nice...great flavor and easy to make (my primary criteria).  I think it worked better for me when the butter was gone from the skillet, though.  The first one seemed a bit soggy.

My husband - who never cooks and is a picky eater found this recipe and...WOW!!This was wonderful. We did omit the brown sugar and red pepper flakes and instead added cumin, cilantro and chipotle chili powder.  We also added in slices of cooked chicken breast. Such a great starter recipe that is easy to "mix and match" with other flavors. Even the kids loved this. Will be making this often!!!

Fantastic!  My husband thinks everything has to have meat in it, but I wanted a meatless recipe.  He actually loved it, it had a great mix of flavors and we will definitely repeat.

My family really liked these.  I used more onions and more salsa (probably twice as much). I folded the tortillas as recommended in an earlier review.  We served them with low-fat sour cream and additional salsa.  Will definitely make again.

Made recipe exactly except added chicken as well. Was really good, but seemed like it needed something. I think adding tomatoes in addition to the salsa would be a good choice. Served it with salsa and sour cream  . Was a healthy dinner for us.

These were great. Especially with a little hot sauce/sour cream on the side. I give it 4 stars because I think it could use a little bit more flavor...maybe some more seasonings, I dunno. But still good and I'll make them again.

My husband and I loved this easy to make dinner with a couple of minor variations. I used low fat Mexican blend cheese to cut calories. Instead of oil and butter, I sprayed the pan with Pam before mixing in the black beans and corn and onions. I also baked the tortillas in the oven for 5 minutes instead of frying to cut back on the fat. Sprayed a baking sheet with Pam and brushed a little olive oil on top of each tortilla before baking, which made them crisp. Served with guacamole and fat free sour cream. Delicious!

This was delicious! Will make again. I did not put the red pepper flakes in because I have a little guy and did not want to make it too spicy for him. I added a little more cheese in my husbands. He loved it and said he would eat it again. I was a little surprised because he is a carnivore and I did not add any meat. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I love, love, love this recipe.  It's cheap, healthy and filling.  I also bake mine at about 350 for 10 minutes like a number of other reviewers suggested.  The filling is also great served over rice.

My bf and I loved this recipe!! It has actually taken the place of a different quesadilla recipe that I nomally make. I just didn't add the onion b/c I don't eat them and I didn't use any brown sugar. Everything still came out great!

Made this last night and it was a huge hit! Even my 2 toddler boys gobbled them up. Only changes i made was to leave out the pepper flakes (for the boys) added a little cumin and a pack of precooked chicken breast chunks. I also cooked them all in the oven with pam as one reviewer suggested so that they would all come out at the same time and just flipped them halfway through. i will definately make again!

OMG!! Best Quesadilla EVER!! Super easy very tasty and DH kept asking when I would make them again:)I read some reviews and tried baking and frying, both were good but I prefer the fried:) I did use pepper jack cheese instead of monteray jack, just because it was what I had on hand.

Delicious! Instead of cooking in olive oil, I cooked the onions, beans, corn in PAM cooking spray. I also omitted the brown sugar (and didn't miss it!). Truly a healthy, delicious recipe!

This is really great! I have made almost the same recipe before, but it was always missign something...it was the brown sugar, that little bit of sweet makes ALL the difference, thanks!! I did spread some goat cheese on hte tortillas as well, gives it a gourmet twist...yum!

This is soooo easy and good! I didn't make it this complicated, or vegetarian. I just used a little bit of leftover canned chicken breast, black beans, corn kernels, cheese, and only used some leftover mole from Mexican take-out for seasoning. So easy, so good, I loved it! I will be making this again.  **Update: Followed recipe exactly this time, but somehow overlooked the brown sugar...? Really good, will make it again!

I didn't know the brown sugar would make that big of a difference in the taste.  It was delicious, my husband loved it as well.  Be aware that this does make a large portion. (Great, more left-overs)

Maybe these are just not my thing, but they really didn't do anything for me.  The taste was not memorable but did leave me feeling queasy.  I'll stick to plain quesadillas with tomatos and guacamole in the future.

This was very good! Left out the pepper flakes for the kids' benefit and served it with guacamole and sour cream.  Also, used flavored flour tortillas.  Very yummy.  I'm sure it will become a favorite around here.

Very quick recipe that my husband loved! Good for days you still want a home-cooked dinner but worked a very long day, thus wanting to make something quick and simple.

Pretty good recipe! I did not have some of the spices needed so my quesadilla lacked in the flavor department a little bit. Next time i'll use the spices and add ground beef! Thanks!

These take a little more time than your average quesadilla, but they are sooo much better.  I didn't know quesadillas could taste so good!

I have made these a few times with rave reviews. The only difference is I sauteed a whole onion and red bell pepper together, added the black beans, corn and seasoned with a package of taco seasoning. Served the quesadillas with sour cream and gucamole. A great recipe for football season!

These were alright.  We didn't care for the sweetness of the brown sugar.  If we make again...we'll probably leave that out.

These were good but not spectacular.  I modified it though.  I put hamburger in it because my husband will not eat dinner w/o meat.  I didn't have red pepper flakes or onion, but I did add green onion. My husband said they were delicious.

Yummy!  This received 2 thumbs up from my whole family.  I added double the beans and corn, lime juice, cumin, and chile powder.  Baked and then broiled to crisp.  DH complained that I didn't make enough! Might add chicken the next time, but it really is great the way it is!  Thanks!

These were so simple & I took the advice of another review & cooked them in tortillas in the oven. I sprayed the tops with Pam & broiled the tops after they were done cooking to make it crispy. THen I used a pizza cutter to cut slices. It was a bit messy but very tasty!

Great recipe!  Because of what I had on hand, I used a combination of mozzarella and cheddar cheese instead of monterey jack and I didn't add the red pepper.  They were still delicious.  I also baked them in the oven as another reviewer suggested.  Yum-Yum.  I will certainly make them again!  Thanks so much!

This was a solidly good recipe and I was pleasently surprised by how well the brown sugar worked with the salsa and the rest of the ingredients. Next time i think i'll try it with barbecue sauce; definitely a keeper.

I just loved this recipe!  I used a bit more crushed pepper flakes because we like things a bit spicy.  The only complaint I have was it was so difficult to flip it neatly in the pan.  Next time I may use one tortilla and fold in half that way I only have to worry about one open end.  I will definitely make again and will try with chicken as other suggested.

Excellent recipe! I made it close to as written, but added chopped fresh tomato instead of salsa to the mixture and used green onions because I like them better. I had much more filling than could fill 8 tortillas.

They were very good for the first couple of bites and then my husband and I couldn't stand to eat any more. I'm not sure what it was. They were close to being good, something just didn't taste right. They were easy to make, and have potential. Just not for us.

When I decided to make these I was not expecting anything special, just a quick and easy meal. After making these I can attest to the fact that they were quick and easy, but oh my goodness the taste exceed my expectations. These were so yummy and flavorful. I made them again a few days later.

These were a wonderful healthy meal.  I followed the recipe, just choosing ingredients to make it lite.  I used spray butter to spray my skillet instead of regular, and I used high fiber tortillas.  The sugar is minimal for the amount of beans and corn there is, but you could even cut that out if you wanted.  I will be making these TONS for lunches and quick dinners!

Loved it...wouldn't change a thing! The mix of textures and flavors was perfect. The brown sugar made it a little sweet, the salsa and red pepper flakes a little spicy, the cheese did not overpower the other flavors. I will definitely be making this one again.

These were fantastic! The only thing I did different than the recipe is put in 1/2 cup of Salsa instead of 1/4 cup. I started out with 1/4, but it got lost in the beans and corn. It had the right flavor for me by doubling it. I loved the brown sugar in it, and the tortillas cooked in butter topped it off perfectly.

So easy and delicious! I used canned seasoned chopped tomatoes - b/c i was all out of salsa. I omitted the brown sugar and used 2 tsp of cumin instead. I baked it in the oven for 10 minutes and broiled it - with a close eye. I served it with Mexican Rice II - Soooo good!

This was my first time making any sort of quesadillas, so I was very impressed with the way they turned out - delicious.  The only problem that I had was that, for turning as well as eating purposes, the two tortillas didn't seem to stick together.  I would recommend using a lot more cheese than the recipe calls for.  Once the tortilla is on the griddle, I'd put a layer of cheese, bean/corn mixture, another layer of cheese, top with tortilla.

Yum!  These were so good.  I did brown some diced chicken in with the onions because my family thinks they need meat with every meal, and I used the corn cut from 2 fresh ears instead of canned.  I also added a little less than 1/4 tsp. of ground cumin for more of a smoky taste.  The little bit of brown sugar gives these just a hint of sweetness, but it goes so well with the other indredients.

I followed the recipe and did what several others did in folding the tortillas in half and baking them.  I just don't get it.  I didn't find these very flavorful and they fell apart.

This was really good and easy to make since I had all of the ingredients.  I think I will make it with meat next time.

I made these exactly as directed, including adding the brown sugar and cooking them in a pan and I thought they were excellent!  I wouldn't change a thing.  The pan frying really melted the cheese evenly and gave a yummy buttery consistency to the tortilla, also turning it golden brown.  They were even better the next day, reheated in the toaster oven. Yum!  We will add this to our vegetarian rotation.

I made two batches.  One with chicken left over from the grill and one without.  They were both great and my kids loved it. (one is vegetarian, one isn't)  This is definitely a keeper!

WOW!  This was my first attemptat quesadillas, and it was fabulous!  I added diced cooked chicken that had been marinated in a chipotle marinade.  That made it spicy enough that I didn't feel it needed the red pepper flakes.  For salsa, I used fresh salsa because that's what I happened to have on hand.  Ohhhh, it was so yummy!!  And colorful, too.  I sense a new family fav coming on :~)

**Update**  I'm adding a star and changing my review because I needed dinner in a pinch the other night and I was able to whip this up.  You know what?  It was pretty tastey for a meal on the fly.  I thought this was good, but I thought it was more of a lunch type recipe than dinner.  I'm not sure I would make again.

these are really good. My husband's reaction was "you mean to tell me there's no meat in these?" but he gobbled them up quicker than anyone else!

Made these for dinner tonight and they were great! I didnt use the sugar or red pepper. I think theyd be a little too sweet with the sugar. Very tasty, had them with some guacamole. Yum!

I thought this was good! I'm starting to do one meal per week as a meatless meal, and this was our first one. I thought it was really good, my husband wasn't really a fan, but he is also apalled by the idea of not having meat at a meal so I'm taking his negativity towards this with a grain of salt. I followed the recipe to a "t" and I thought it was great! I made one into a quesadilla and the other into a roll up tortilla and I thought both were great! Will definetely make again!

This was a good basic recipe. I didn't have the salsa on hand but it tasted great anyways. I added some cumin and thyme for taste to the beans and corn. I dipped it into sour cream. I will make different variations of this recipe again.

These were great! I made the recipe as written and is was easy, delicious, and cheap. I wouldn't go so far as to call it health food, but you could definitely eat worse. I have been trying to find some vegetarian recipes that my meat loving hubby would enjoy. These quesadillas will be a staple at my house from now on!

Easy weeknight dinner. Followed the recipe as written except I grilled the quesadillas instead of pan frying them with butter and added way less cheese. Ate them with guacamole and sour cream.

A very filling filling. I even forgot the brown sugar & it was still yummy. This mix could also work great as a tasty side item or chip dip. Yummy sprinkled with cilantro!

Delicious!  I made these exactly as written except I cut way back on the cheese.  These were great.  They were quick, simple, and healthy which is perfect for just what I was looking for. It was also very easy to cut back on the portions so that I could just make enough for me without having leftovers.

This was good to the whole family.I added spinach because my 2-year old wouldn't eat a cupcake if it was green,so every chance I get to hide greens I take it,and it works well with the mix.Next time (which may be next weekend!)I'll leave the sugar out to see if the sweet corn is enough.Guess what were having for Sunday brunch,mmmmmm!!!

My husband and I thought this was a tasty dish, but a little plain for the amount of work.  I have tried a very simple bean and corn tortilla recipe that tasted very similar.  I imagine it could be transferred to quesadillas and taste very similar to this recipe.

I've made this multiple times and it's always a "5", even without the addition of the sugar. I use frozen corn instead of canned and any type of bean I have around. I also microwave the tortillas after filling them and fold them in half to melt the cheese. My kids love them, my parents loved them and my vegetarian friends love them as well.

These are VERY GOOD! I made them exactly as the recipe called for...... I think I did put a bit too much filling in each one ---- as they were VERY messy to eat. Stuff was falling out all over the place. Ahhhh but that just made it more fun, my husband & I got to laugh at each other! Definitely putting this recipe in my Favorites.

Good, easy recipe.  The addition of brown sugar adds something special to the taste!  Instead of using one tortilla on top and one on bottom, I spread the filling over half of a large tortilla and then fold in half.  Reduced a lot of spillage!

These are great!  I skipped the red pepper & butter.  The tortillas do not stick to a non-stick pan since they are made with lard.  I also added cream cheese.  My family loved them.

I thought this was just okay.  We felt it had too much corn.  The flavor was good and it was easier to handle after it cooled a bit. Next time I will use pepper jack cheese instead.

I followed the bean and corn filling recipe exactly. The only thing that I did different is I grilled the tortillas on the grill to eleminate the butter (extra calories). I had extra filling left over, so the next day I made a soft shell taco with it and it was even better than the Quesadillas. I think I will start using the filling for tacos instead!!!

Great taste...I omitted the sugar, as suggested by some other reviewers, and that was probably a good choice. The corn sweetens the flavor enough. Also, I ended up having to use extra cheese to help the tortillas stick together...might want to plan for that when making these. Awesome Cinco De Mayo party food!

Surprising and wonderful! even 1 yr old loved the beans.  subbed chili powder for pepper flakes and did add chicken, but would still be great without.  Our new favorite "LOST"  menu for Wed nights!

These weren't bad. I halved the recipe and added cumin and chili powder to the bean mix to give it more flavor. I thought there was *something* missing, but I don't know what. Not bad though.

This sounded like a good combination, but mine turned out BLAND and really messy!  My husband liked the filling over chips for nachos, though.

Very good!  Followed this recipe as written (may have added some extra cheese!) and had no complaints.  My 3 year old was a little turned off by the texture, but the taste was great.  Boyfriend raved!  Will continue to make.

I will be using this recipe many times! So delicious! A bit of a sweet taste from the corn and the small amount of sugar. The only change I made was that I added a bit more salsa into the mixture. I also used half cheddar and half monterrey jack cheeses with much success! Delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good recipe.  I really liked it as it was, but next time I will add scallions and garnish with chopped tomato and lettuce.  My husband requested (and enjoyed) that his be made with leftover chicken and it cooked up just as easily and tasted great too.

Pretty tasty, but I think it was the salsa and yogurt that gave it most of the flavor.  Could have used more spice of some sort.  I did add a bit of cayenne pepper for kick.  Decent recipe though, and the boyfriend thought it was pretty tasty.

We were very surprised by this dish. It was fast, easy, healthy and tasty. My boyfriend is not big on veggie meals but totally dug this. The filling tended to fall out the sides unless you used lots of cheese but I didn't mind. I love creative and unexpected recipes like this!

This recipe was super easy to make.  I, personally, didn't care for the brown sugar.  There is such a variety of salsas out there too.  Make sure the one you use actually has some flavor to it (ours didn't, boo hoo).
