I was very reluctant to make this recipe...I mean,come on now, the combination of creamed corn and tomato soup and sauce?!?!  But at my husband's urging I broke down an made this for him.  I am glad I did.....it is VERY GOOD!!  I will be making this again and again.  The only thing I think I will change will be the addition of a can of whole corn.  So don't be afraid to give this one a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!

I am enjoying the dish right now.  I had made it for dinner (early) and decided that I'd like to taste it for lunch and it's a very flavorful dish.  Leaps and Bounds better than any box hamburger helper.  I did have to do a few things different. First I didn't have egg noodles but used elbow noodles in it's place.  I didn't have creamed corn so I  used regular canned corn and drained it and added a can of cheddar cheese soup.  I also added a little extra salt and also added garlic powder.  I omitted the pimentos since I didn't have them on hand.  I still would imagine this recipe to be just as good if I had made it according to directions.  Thanks for the recipe it has just the right amount of heat for me and I really enjoyed this dish and I'm sure my 4 kids and husband will as well.

This was a wonderful recipe and everyone loved it. Because of lack of ingredients a few things were altered.  I used cream of mushroom soup because I didn't have tomato soup.  I also omitted pimentos and jalapenos.  I added some black pepper and garlic powder to the mix. Pleasantly surprised how well it turned out.

My husband and I really didn't care for this at all.  It was a whole lot of effort for something that tasted like glorified hamburger helper.  The kids liked it, but they like a lot of other things I make, so I don't think they'll miss this one.

I made this exactly to the directions and its good but I needed to add a little more salt and It doesn't need to be in the oven for more that 10-15 minutes. The cheese came out burnt after 15 minutes in the oven but it still tasted great and I will be making it again

This turned out wonderful. My entire family and company enjoyed it. I left out the pimentos and chilis and used fresh mushrooms. I didn't want to burn the cheese, so I added after I plated it. I will definitley make it again.

Good "go to" recipe when you need to feed the family. I used frozen corn rather than creamed corn, roasted red peppers rather than pimentos, and I used macaroni noodles rather than egg noodles but it was easy and very good.

This was tasty - pretty much what I thought it would be like. Just your average casserole. Nothing wrong with it at all - yet, nothing too exciting about it either. It's not a recipe I will keep - just because there are so many other similar ones to try. Might as well move on and keep preparing new ones for variety. I followed this recipe as written. I was worried about the jalapeno because I have two small children. But, it did not make it too spicy and my one year old gobbled it up. A very satisfying meal for my family.

This came out surprisingly tasty and the leftovers were good for lunch.  It has a southwestern flavor to it.  I made it mostly as written, but used onion powder in place of onion, red pepper instead of green, and omitted the dry mustard and mushrooms.  I also had less jalapeno on hand than called for, but next time I would use all of it.  If I had corn or tomatoes on hand that I needed to use up, this could be a good recipe to add them to.

Loved it!  I kind of wondered when I saw the creamed corn mixed with tomato sauce, but it really was good!  I left out the jalapeno and pimentos only because we don't like them, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  I'll surely make it again.  By the way, I got ten good-sized servings out of it.

I saved this because it sounded like something my husband would like.  He did and so did I.  I used jarred pickled jalapeno  nacho slices and loved the flavor they added.

For me, native and living in Spain, this was a different way of cooking noodles.  It came out full of flavour, very nice to the mouth and easy to make.  My whole family loved it. For sure, I will make it again. Thank you.

This was a really good meal to cook when everybody is working and don't have much time! I took out the pimentos and the mushrooms and added celery and a little more water because the egg noodles came in 12 oz. I would however make this again and I would recommend it to people
