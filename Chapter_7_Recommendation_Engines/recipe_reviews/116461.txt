I really like this recipe. But it needs a few changes. First of all there is WAY too much milk, which I am sure is the reason for the mushy mess and longer cooking times people are encountering. Reduce the milk to 1/2 C at the most.  Secondly, to increase the volume lost by the milk, increase to 8 eggs. For extra flavor add ham cubes and or cubed breakfast sausage. Layer bread, meat, cheese, repeat. Then pour egg mixture over top.  Let sit over night and cook for 1 hour. And whatever you do, DO NOT forget to grease the pan or you will have a gigantic mess.  (I learned this lesson the hard way!!)

I had some left over croissants that I needed to use so I decided to try this recipe since I had all of the ingrediants in my pantry.  After reading the reviews I decided to add the milk one cup at a time until I got what I thought was the desired consistancy noting that after a night in the fridge most of the liquid should be absorbed by the bread.  I ended up keeping all the ingrediants and measurements the same only cutting down the milk from 3 cups to 2 cups.  This turned out perfect and it was easy and simple to make.  I wondering if people end up with to much liquid because it calls for 7 slices of bread.  I don't know about you, but 7 slices could leave you with different amounts of bread depending on the size of the slice, thickness ect.  My guess is that if you got a runny mess there was not enough bread used.  I used 7 croisssants which would have been more volumne than if I had used 7 slices of bread.  Hope this helps.  I'll be making this again and can see where you could add in a lot of different ingrediants to make this your own.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good! Prepared for my family Christmas morning breakfast and had rave reviews. I followed the recipe almost exactly except used only 2 cups milk, doubled the bacon and added 2 eggs. It was perfect! A keeper and so easy!

Super easy and tastes great!  Don't omit the mustard powder, I think it makes the recipe.

The recipe is very plain, but could easily be tweaked to personal taste.  I was looking for a recipe for a guest that can't handle any heat/spice (this was perfect).  So when I make it again, I'll probably add some onions and chiles.

Be sure not to over cook.  

I increased the ingredients for 10 servings and cooked it in a 9 X 13 pan.

This is one of the worst recipes I have ever tried.  Even my husband (who'll eat just about anything) threw his away.  I had prepared this for a special Easter morning surprise, and we ended up going out for donuts...  Would not recommend!

This was quck and easy to make. I added a small can of drained diced green Ortega Chiles and a couple shots of Tabasco Sauce. I served salsa on the side. My friends and family enjoyed it very much. Would make again.

Excellent!  I made this for our Friday morning breakfast at work and received rave reviews!  I didn't have any meat products, so we had it without - but it was still great!  This one is a keeper!

Quick and easy.  I used precooked cubed ham instead of bacon so it took even less time to prepare.  It is a pretty basic base recipe, so even the pickest kids will eat it.

I used sausage instead of bacon for my family.  We enjoyed it Christmas morning and the leftovers are even good warmed up.  A keeper.

This was a great recipe!  I made it for coworkers and it was a hit.  So easy and quick to make...I used precooked bacon to make it even quicker.  I think I will use more bacon next time, but otherwise, it was perfect!

Really good with a few tweaks. I changed bacon out for spicy sausage, lowered the milk to two cups, upped the eggs to 8 and the cheese to 3 cups. I also added a can of diced green chilies.

I was looking for a recipe that I could use a carton of eggs that was getting ready to expire and some leftover coctail breads and cheeses.  This was perfect. 

important tips:

1. Don't skimp on the greasing!  This will totally stick to the bottom of your pan.
2.  You don't have to let this sit over night.  Baking immediately after preparing it won't ruin anything. 
3.  This recipe is very forgiving.  You can add extra eggs and other items, like peppers, sausage, turkey whatever flavor combinations you prefer.  Just make sure you pat and drain any excess water or grease off the items you wish to add.

This had a really good base for experimentation and leftovers.  It's also great because like a pizza, I was able to stratify different layers of vegetables and meats to suit my family.  My partner and my section was layered with hot sausage, jalepenos, havarti,cheddar bacon, onions, and garlic.  The kids simply had bacon and cheddar. And it was all in one pan!

In my opinion, everyone should have some version of this in their recipe arsenal.  It will come in handy for any crowd.

Thanks for the inspiration for a delicious Christmas breakfast!

Great recipe all around :)  I think the key is to whip the wet ingredients with the whisk attachment on a kitchen aid until they are frothy, no sogginess and it puffs up nicely.  Also, I used a good quality organic white bread & farm fresh eggs.  Next time, I will add sausage & sage to give it a more savory taste.  As it was , it was great the first day with maple syrup drizzled over.  Even better the next day warmed up with a side of ketchup :)  Thanks!

Good recipe...I tweaked it a bit with less milk and more eggs, added ham as well as the bacon.  I also increased the pepper and mustard & added a bit of garlic for a bit more diverse flavor.    I still needed to cook longer than the 55 minutes, it was more like 1.25 hrs.  Delicious, my family really loved it.

Ended up mushy.  Should probably use less milk and a heavier type of bread, like italian maybe.

LOVE this! Especially as someone who doesn't like sausage, it's a great substitute to the "normal" casseroles. I usually use the entire pound of bacon though.

Very good--I substituted 1 lb browned sausage instead of bacon and used whole wheat bread with the crusts and it turned out great!

Used turkey sausage instead of the bacon and left the crust on the bread.  I love the fact that you assemble this the night before and then all you have to do is bake it in the morning.  Saves so much time and clean up in the morning.  Pan was gone in minutes - everyone enjoyed this one - Thanks!

I made this for a carry in at work and it disappeared very quickly and I could hear a lot of compliments as my co-workers were eating. I also decreased the milk to 2 cups and added more bacon and an additional egg and it turned out wonderful. I may just make this for Christmas morning.

We've used a similar recipe for years Christmas morning. Instead of the bacon, I brown 1 lb of turkey sauage.  It's delicious topped with some extra sharp cheddar cheese.

I used challah with crusts, about 4-5 cups--enough to cover bottom of pan.  Sprinkled with 1-3/4 cup finely shredded cheddar.  Beat 8 eggs with 2 cups 2%milk, salt and pepper and 1 tsp. onion powder poured over top. Sprinkled 1/2 with chopped cooked spinach, All with thin slice tomatoe and 1/4 c. cheddar and light sprinkling of shredded parmesan.  Covered with wax paper and weighted top in fridge overnight.  Let sit out 15 minutes then bake at 350 for 55.  Really good!

My grandmother has been making this casserole every Christmas morning for as long as I can remember.  Best breakfast I've ever had.  My husband, who doesn't like eggs, will even eat this with a little salsa on top.  I try to switch up what meat goes in it (ham, sausage, bacon), or add a veggie (broccoli).

I made this for a potluck breakfast for work.....I thought it was good, but slightly bland. Everyone else raved about and loved it. I didn't use bacon, sub'd sausage instead. I loved that I could make it the night before and just pop it in the oven in the morning.

Quite easy to put together (the night before) and toss in the oven in the morning.  The taste was excellent!
Made the following adjustments based on comments and personal preference:
-lowered milk to 1 and 1/2 C (might try 2 C next time?)
-increased to 8 eggs
-used 1.25 lb gnd sausage
-grilled onions, garlic, & bell peppers prior to adding the sausage
-added some extra cheeses on top (what was in fridge, including some feta)
I will certainly make again for family/friends.

This recipe is wonderful as is, but I love potatos, so I added a layer of tater rounds to the top and they got nice and crispy like I like them and it was terrific!!! Thanks for the recipe. I will be making it again for Christmas morning.

This is a great recipe.  I made it for the family on Christmas morning.  I think I left the crusts on by accident, and used some leftover bacon and ham in the casserole.  It was fabulous.  Thank you!

This is by far the WORST recipe I've ever tried from this site.  It was terrible.  The cooking time was way off and the taste was bad.  My family hated it Christmas morning!  They ended up with refrigerated bagels instead!

Very VERY bland.  I even added onion & broccoli. I guess it could be better with sausage AND bacon.  Do not use wheat bread - white would have been better.  I ate mine with salsa on top, just so it tasted like something.

Absolutely fabulous, kept well when it had to be reheated for latecomers, and good reheated.  The make ahead part is the best part of all.

I had a great Christmas Casserole recipe and lost it.  This one is the closest one to the one I lost that I could find.  I used french bread instead of white bread and added a little cayenne. additional pepper and garlic salt.  It was wonderful!  My family loved it.

I made this for breakfast this past Christmas, and it was great! SO easy to assemble the night before, and just throw it in the oven in the morning! My family of 5 devoured the whole pan. My only concern was a little to salty, but I DID use a whole pack of bacon. My husband thought it was The Best!

Thank you for this easy breakfast idea!  I followed reader's suggestions to add more egg and decrease the milk to 2 cups.  I also added some Onion Onion seasoning from Tastefully Simple and that added a touch more flavor.  Will definitely be a repeat at my house!

Great basic recipe.  I used Texas Toast, which works well with the amount of milk needed.  It's also easy to customize by adding peppers, onions, mushrooms, meats, or whatever else sounds good.  My family loved it.

This is a great recipe.  It did come out a bit soggier than my husband likes, but I will try the suggestions next time (less milk, more eggs).  Either way, it was super tasty!  I did use yellow mustard instead of dry since I didn't any on hand.

Definitely needs less milk, my first try was VERY runny. I used sausage instead of bacon the second time and loved it. I've also made a GREAT vegetarian version with broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, and feta. Yum!

We just made this for Christmas '06. It was fantastic! My husband prepared it the night before and I put it in when I woke up the next morning. We followed the recipe exactly give or take on the time. I took it out when it looked ready. My kids ate this all up and asked for seconds. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast and it was a hit with all members of my family.  I would use a bit more bacon - very crisp or ham next time.  I used whole Wheat bread and skim milk to cut the fat and add fiber.  It was great!  Loved the make ahead thing especially for Christmas - put it in when we woke up and it was ready after gifts.  A new tradition for our family!

Thanks for this great basic recipe that's easy to alter to ones taste.  I use a whole loaf of bread and add a couple more eggs.  As I'm vegetarian, I use crumbled up vegetarian sausages.  I'm always asked to bring it for any brunch I attend.

I made(mostly)as directed and it took an extra 20 minutes @ 375 to get the jiggliness out of it. Next time will add some eggs and take out some milk. I used a rustic roasted garlic loaf, pork sausage, mushrooms and white cheddar. It was still delicious and got all eaten up!

This recipe always gets a "wow" from my hubby for breakfast or even a nice change as a dinner dish. Alterations that I make are spicing it up with more pepper and mustard or other spices. Alternately, I like replacing the bacon with hot sausage or chopped ham. It works well with 100% whole wheat bread too, just be sure to chop the bread into small pieces.

A wonderful recipe. I topped each piece with a spoonful of sweet onion salsa.  We had company staying at our house. After everyone went to bed I prepared this as written except I used canned real bacon bits and saved the time it took to cook the bacon.  I put it in the oven and set my oven timer so it would be ready at breakfast time. I also set the timer on my coffee pot and set the table except for what I needed to take out of the refrigeator the next morning. We woke up to the wonderful aroma and breakfast was ready in no time.  My guests were impressed and wanted the recipe.  I will be fixing this for my company often.

AWESOME! My husband and I loved this dish.  We did add some ham and onion to the recipe.  Great when you dont have time to tend to the meal.

A big hit at our house.  We did use 1/2 the cheese (used reduced fat Mexican cheese) and 5 links of lite pork sausage (chopped) instead of bacon.  Great!

This is a great Christmas morning time saver.  I have made a similar recipe for years and lost it. I was so happy to find this under breakfast casseroles. The only differnce with mine is that I put 6 slices of bread (crusts removed) on the bottom and use shaved or sliced ham instead of bacon.I also put 6 slices of bread on top of the ham and cheese then pour the mixture over top. I also aded a little worchestershire sauce. In the morning, I sprinkle corn flakes on top mixed with 1/4 cup melted butter or margarine and pop it in the oven.
