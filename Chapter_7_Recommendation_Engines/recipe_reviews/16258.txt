I think this is a great recipe.  I used what I had.  Skipped the corn and celery.  Didn't have canned chili either.  Here's what I did.  Added garlic, celery salt, used homemade taco seasoning, chili powder and used rice instead of noodles.  Made the rice, dumped everything else in the frying pan.  Added the rice once it was done and put the whole thing in the oven.  I have oven safe pots so I skipped the casserole dish.  Also topped with cheddar cheese.  Excellent dish!

This recipe is filling and easy but to add more taste, mix some shredded cheddar cheese into the casserole and turn up the heat on the oven to about 350 for 20 minutes and it has more flavor.  Good, easy, fast and cheap!  That gets me!

This tastes very similar to "chili casserole" also found on this site. In addition to the 1/4c salsa, I added 1/3c taco sauce to make it a little creamier, used macaroni noodles instead of egg noodles and mixed in about 1/2c of sharp cheddar cheese in with it all. Apprx 5 minutes before completion, I sprinkled another 1/2c cheese overall to melt.  Very tasty and hearty lunch. Warmed us up in this frigid MN weather we're having here! Thanks Sara.

I loved it.  I served it with cornbread.  My bf loved it.  So good I sent the recipe to everyone I know.  So good I have made it once a week for 3 weeks.  I did change it a bitt.  Added some garlic and added hot pepper flakes to the burger.  Also added some colby jack cheese on top.  I made it with expesive and cheap chilli.  It works well with both. I even printed it out and added it to my recipe box with all my grandma's old recipes.

Tried this recipe again last night and used Campbells Chunky Chilli.  This dish came out with very little flavor.  I would not recommend using Campbells Chilli use Nally's or store brands even Aldi's chilli.  I have used many different types of Chilli and this recipes works, but not with Campbells.

It is very good but I altered it because of the reviews I read, the original way may be a bit bland. Instead of noodles I had mexican style rice, I added colby jack cheese, instead of regular skinless diced tomatoes I substituted stewed tomatoes which gave it more flavor. I also added some corn chips on top to give it a bit of texture. Then when I served it I added a dallop of sour cream. Made it a lot more flavorful and a bit spicier. :)

I made this last night for my family and it was a huge hit! I substituted rice for egg noodles (was out of noodles), and used salsa with cheese blended in instead of regular salsa. I also added a little garlic to the hamburger and onion as I was cooking it, and added shreaded cheese blend on top of the mixture, baking as directed. My wife had seconds and thirds, and my 5 year old son loved it too (and he is pretty picky). I will try this again!

I just made this the other night and it turned out really good! I didnt have everything on the list so I had to alter it a little. I didnt have any celery so I just ommited that. I didnt have any chili so I used pork and beans and spiced them up with some red pepper flakes and kicken chicken seasoning (really gave it great flavor!) I used rice instead of noodles as recommended in the other review, topped it with cheese at the end and served it with a dollop of sour cream. Great reheated for lunch the next day too. My husband wants me to keep it as a regular dinner option. : )

I modified this recipe a bit.  I left out the celery and the salsa (because I didn't have any) and exchanged the egg noodles for two chopped potatoes since neither I or my husband are big egg noodle fans.  Because I put in the potatoes, I upped the cooking time to about 45 minutes and upped the oven temp to about 350.  

The result was a hearty meal a little thicker than chili but with the same great flavor.  It actually seemed better warmed up the next day than right after it was cooked.  Yummy topped with cheese and sour cream!

We loved it, including the kids.  Used more hamburger and fewer noodles, just because that's how we like it, and added cheese to the top, but other than that used the exact recipe.

I followed this recipe exaclty, only omitting the corn and adding shredded cheddar to the top before baking.  It was delicious!  My 15 month old devoured it!  This goes great with a salad with catalina dressing!

I varied the recipe a little, I cut out the celery.  Used a can of diced flavored tomatoes with green chiles to add some zest.  Topped with monterey/cheddar sprinkle cheese before baking.  Then I had sides that everyone could add if they wanted... sour cream, salsa, jalapenos... and WOW they all loved it!!  Will definately use again especially when I don't want to mess with tacos.
Thanks!

Made no changes and it was pretty blah. I prefer the layered hamburger casserole with the burger/tomato sauce mix (with garlic), layered with the noodles and sour cream, topped with cheese.

I found this to be lacking in something and it had a lot of liquid. I suppose that's to be expected considering the ingredients. I used elbow macaroni rather than egg noodles and I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site instead of a packet of seasoning mix. I also added in a seeded and veined jalapeno pepper. I mixed about 1 cup of cheese into the mixture itself and then topped with cheese. I do think the cooking temperature has a typo on it and it should be 350 degrees, not 250 degrees. But, on the bright side, I did get to break in my new Le Creuset gratin baking dish making this.

This was a basic recipe....great base but needed to alter the entire thing.  Or it would have been very, very bland. I used 1 lb of 95/5 hamburger and minced fresh garlic to fry in the pan with the meat.  Then used smart macaroni noodles (14.5 oz box).  Then used the can of beanless chili, along with about 6 oz of tomato sauce, about 3/4 cup medium salsa, and a few dashes of hot sauce along with the pack of taco seasoning.  Also added a 4oz can of green chilis.  Like others said topped off with about a cup of finely shredded xsharp cheddar cheese.  I omitted the corn and tomatoes.

My husband loved it -- i did tweak it a little. I used a packet of williams chili seasoning and a can of red kidney beans instead of taco seasoning and canned chili. I also added garlic salt and a small can of diced green chilies.  I used frozen sweet corn instead of caned corn. It was very good.

This meal was pretty good. I added jalapenos and garlic also some hard tortilla shells underneath the cheese. I still want to experiment with this one as it was kind of bland. Next time I will try rice as recommended by other reviewers. But all in all not bad.

Okay. I’m one of those folks who cringes when someone changes up an already popular recipe. That said...Didn’t have celery, so substituted a diced green pepper. Since this has a Mexican flair I had to add 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro to the hamburger browning. I’m from Wisconsin, so by law I was required to add shredded cheddar cheese! And finally we crunched up some tortilla chips into the finished casserole. YUM! That’s what my wife said!

I didn't have the canned chili and celery so I omitted them. I used 7 oz. of macaroni noodles which I had on hand and cooked for six minutes. The lack of chili made the recipe look dry so I added one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and 1/2 c. hot salsa vs. 1/4 c. salsa. If you heat the ingredients on the stove, as directed, bake at 250 otherwise bake at 350 as recommended by others. Following the recipe instructions is the key to the bake time. With the addition of tomato sauce, I also added a 1-2 cloves of minced jarred garlic for additional flavor. I warmed in the oven then added cheese during the last five minutes of the bake time. The kids loved it!

I didn't have any canned chili or celery, so I just put in more salsa and a little bit of left over nacho cheese sauce. I used whole wheat macaroni instead of egg noodles, and put in some garlic and topped with cheese... Actually found it really tasty, not bland at all.

I had leftover hamburger and grilled corn, so I found this recipe. I made it with my homemade taco seasoning, added cheese and skipped the celery.  I thought it would be just another "taco casserole ". But it was so good. The corn gave it a nice sweetness.  I will definitely make again.

My husband and son loved it. I didn't have any chili so I just added a can of kidney beans. I added an extra pack of taco seasoning. I wasn't that crazy about it. I thought it was like fancy hamburger helper.  I will fix it again because the family liked it.

The recipe is not very flavorful (as written).  It needs many changes to make it better.

I doubled this recipe, a used 1 can of chili w/o beans and 1 can of ranch beans w/jalepenos. I added 1 can of regular tomatos, and 1 can of tomoatos w/ green chilis. This added a nice spicy flavor my family likes.
I topped it with cheese and crushed taco chips. Great recipe, will definitely make again and share with others. Thanks Sara

A little bland. We didn't finish the casserole. Pawned it off on my brother (he'll eat anything) Definitely not a keeper.

The family loved this recipe.  I loved this recipe because it is so easy to make, the only thing I had to go and buy was a can of chili.  Most of all it is economical and a balanced, nutritional meal.

Pretty good stuff. Left out the beans, didn't have any. Didn't see the need to dirty another dish so mixed and heated on the stove then added noodles. I felt oven time may have made it dry. Tastes like homemade hamburger helper! I bet adding cheese then oven time would make it really good! Thanks for the recipe.

I used macaroni , corn, black beans chili, and a chili packet  and omitted celery because that’s that’s all I had in the house. I also used a mixture of Rotel and diced tomatoes along with the salsa. I bake it for 15 minutes and then added a 3 cheese blend on top and then baked it for another 5 minutes at 350 degrees

I make this type of casserole quite often. I make it either with noodles, beans or potatoes. I always add and top it with plenty of grated cheese. Then I serve it with bowls of shredded iceberg and chopped tomatoes. No matter what I cook, I always fix a green salad as first course. It makes for a nice and simple dinner.

Great base recipe.  I altered it a bit based on what I had but the family loved it and we'll make it again.   

Instead of noodles I used large shells and I added garlic and bell pepper to the onion and celery blend.  I also used half fresh ground beef and half leftover taco meat.  Used chili seasoning instead of taco seasoning and stirred in a little leftover nacho cheese.   Fiesta-style corn and fire roasted chili-style tomatoes for a little extra flavor.  Once it was heated through I sprinkled the top with cheese and then returned it to the oven to melt.  Delish!

Don’t omit the celery! It seems counterintuitive for a Mexican-ish dish, but it really adds a nice touch. Per another reviewer’s recommendation, I added a cup of sharp cheddar to the mix before baking, and baked at 350 for 20 mins. I’m the only one in my family with a spicy palate, but I would like to try with jalapeños and/or a hot chili.

This was a good, easy to make meal.  I didn't see the point in including a can of chili since the recipe already includes ground beef.  I substituted a can of Rotel tomatos with green chilies and increased the amount of salsa to 1/2 cup.  I also sprinkled shredded cheese on top before baking.  This was a good, hearty meal - perfect for a cold evening.  I'll definitely make it again.

Anything my 5 year old likes gets 5 stars. I was skeptical even when I was making it. why celery? and corn? And egg noodle?? But they all go together very nicely complimenting each other's texture and flavour. I called it a taco noodle rather than "hamburger". I forgot to put salsa but it was still good. Just so you know, the ingredient list says Salsa, but the direction had "taco sauce". I assumed they are the same thing.

I made this just as written with the exception of the celery. I found it to be very flavorful and quick to make.  This is going into the regular rotation.

Easy to make, cooked it at 350 instead 250.  Husband said 5 stars, but I thought 4.  Left overs were better the next day!

This is a Tex-Mex Ground Beef Casserole , Not a Hamburger Casserole as there is NO Ham in it ,.... just Ground Beef !Or 
one could make this with Ground Chuck or what the Butchers often refer to as Chili Meat which is Ground Beef but a courser grind than regular ground beef ! To Kick this Up a Notch, one could add a can of Chopped Green Chilies to it ! Leave out the celery , and substitute with chopped Roasted, Peeled, and de-seeded Poblano Peppers and top it all off with a blend of Mexican Shredded Cheeses. Serve with Tortillas, either Corn or Flour , warmed  or Tortilla Chips of choice

My family loves this dish. I followed the recipe except for adding too many noodles. I used the 12 ounce package and forgot to hold back some of the noodles. Still delicious!

This recipe is easy to make and tasty!  I did make a couple of simple changes... I added one can of black beans to boost fiber and protein, and because they taste good. I also added one tsp of spicy Mexican chilli powder. Additionally, I added  a cup of shredded Mexican blend cheese. A dollop of sour cream per serving added an extra touch.

I made this tonight, and it was most awesome.  I made it by the recipe, just to get a feel for what it might need next time if any. Happy to report liked it just as is.  Did not do the cheese thing however, but will try adding some on a reheat tomorrow.

Mediocre at best.  I followed the recipe and now realize that all the great reviews are from people who didn't!  The flavors just don't come together well.

I made a big batch of this & used 3 Corning casseroles.  Tweaked by adding onion soup instead of beef broth; also added some garlic.  Baked all 3 at 400 for 45 minutes and everything was well cooked.  Even with the changes I found it a little bland but will make it again, tweaking the seasonings - maybe half tomatoes & half tomato soup with a tiny bit of chili pepper.  The taco seasoning sounds interesting too.  Took one casserole to potluck & it all disappeared.

I used this great recipe as a base. I was short on food & time. I used 2lbs ground beef. 2 can diced tomatoes. 2 cans corn. 1 1/2 cups cooked rice. 1 pouch taco season. garlic, salt, and pepper as needed & mixed it all together and added about 1 1/2 cup can cheddar cheese (like from Sams club or Costco) delish even my picky kids ate it!! Waiting to see what the husband thinks! =) thanks for sharing. I really needed a quick and easy dinner!!

I made this as directed - and added a little chedder cheese as other reviewers had suggested.  It was good.  Although, tasted a little bit like a fancy hamburger helper...which might have been a bit easier ;-)

Fast, easy, inexpensive and flavorful!  You really can't go wrong with this.  I made it last night for the first time with the recipe as-is and it was wonderful.  I'll probably experiment a little with a little more in the way of peppers or jalapenos next time when my girlfriend isn't partaking - but that's just because I love spicy food.  ;)  The flavor as-is is wonderful.

There is a mistake in the recipe because it says salsa in the ingredients list but in the directions it never mentions salsa but taco sauce so I used taco sauce instead. It was very good and I will definitely be making this for the next pot luck and in between that time at home because my husband loved it.

Unfortunately, after gathering all of the ingredients, I realized that I didn't have a baking dish I could use in the oven. I had to adapt, so I cooked up the beef, onion and celery in a pot with the taco seasoning, salt, pepper, and hot pepper flakes. Once the beef was cooked, I added the tomatoes and salsa, and simmered a bit. I added about a cup of water, kidney beans and corn. Finally, I through in the egg noodles and let them cook in the juices. I served it up with a dollop of sour cream, crushed tortilla chips and shredded cheese on top. It was so good, my husband and I each had two bowls! The best thing was, since I did have to modify the recipe, I had barely had any dishes to clean up at the end. :)

Needed a quick fix dinner tonight and had all the ingredients on hand for this.  We all loved it.  We like a little heat, so I used a hot chili and added 4 jalapenos.  I served with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream and cornbread.  If you like tacos and burritos you can edit as you would those.

This was delicious.  I grew up on the standard beef casserole, which I never made once married as I always remember it as being pretty bland.  This one tastes a whole lot better and is so easy to make!

This one was good and hearty, and easy to make. I try to avoid recipes that call for packaged spice mixes, because they increase the cost substantially. I also didn't find it terribly tasty. No "Hmmmm, this is great!" comments. 

For a quick and filling dinner, it did the trick though and the leftovers weren't totally ignored, which is a good sign. It's a good stand-by recipe, though I won't call it my favorite. High rating on ease of preparation and for having common ingredients, but medium-to-low on overall flavor and desirability.

I used a can of sloppy joe mix and rotini macaroni noodles, the can of diced tomatoes had green chile's so I skipped the salsa, froze 1/2 of it for another meal (before baking) and served it with tortilla chips and fresh asperagus sauted in olive oil and garlic, fed 4 hungary folks!  This would go well at a covered dish dinner.

Yummy!  It has a lot of flavor and isn't your basic casserole.  I added a sour cream, cracker, & butter topping for crunch on top.  Thank you, Sara!  It's been made a couple times already and will be made again!

Very good. Used 1/2 egg noodles and 1/2 elbows because that's what I had and it turned out great. Kind of a twist on basic chili mac!

Made this as written minus celery and it was disappointing and bland.  I can't say I won't try it again but definitely would not make it again as written.  That being said I think it's on the right track to something quick and yummy with a little experimenting.

Holy Moly is this every good!  It makes a LOT, but it's worth freezing to enjoy a couple more times.  My only "negative" is that both Corn and noodles in the same dish is a little carb heavy.  Next  time I'll probably add a can of Black Beans and skip the pasta entirely.  Thanks, Sal for a great recipe!

I made this exactly like the recipe. It was quick and easy. It was a little bland, so you may want to add some cheese, sour cream, etc.  I also did not put it in a 10x15 pan. I combined everything in the noodle pan and put that in the oven. Could not see a reason to dirty another dish.

I made this, and will definitely make it again. I made two changes to the recipe--I substituted Rotini pasta for the egg noodles because I'm not a big fan of egg noodles and I left out the chili because my son really dislikes chili. My family found the taco seasoning to be a bit much, so next time I'll either use less or skip it, and I think it would be even better with shredded cheese on top, so I'll probably add that. The celery was nice, but we don't use celery much so buying a whole stalk just for a single rib is a bit of a waste.

Super easy and quick. I will definitely make it again. I left out the taco sauce as I didn't have any. I think I will try using salsa next time. I doubled it and upped the oven temp to 350°. Loved the corn in it. Even the grandkids ate it up!

Everyone loved it.  I did not add the corn.  We had fresh sweet corn on the side.  Added cojack cheese on top with sour cream to be added as desired.  Will be making this again.

Not my favorite casserole.  It actually  took a bit of time to prepare and in spite of the many ingredients  required  the taste was quite ordinary.

Great comfort food dish! I added a 1/4 cup of Mexican blend cheese to the mix before baking then, a half cup on top for the last five minutes. Was surprised the recipe didn’t call for any salt and pepper!?! I had to add it on my plate. Will definitely include it in the ingredients next time. The dish tasted even better the next day as reheated leftovers! 
  I will certainly be making this dish again!!

ONLY change I made was to add fresh mushrooms saute'd with the ground beef, celery and onions, and shredded some cheese on top and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!! The chili and taco seasoning definitely set it off!!!! WONDERFUL RECIPE and definitely a KEEPER!!!! Made it last night, and tonight we put the leftovers on tortillas as a burrito with some guacamole and sour cream!!!! Even better!!!!!

Oh yeah....actually, I didn't bother to put it in the oven last night..... just to keep from heating the kitchen up and just did it all on the stove. STILL FANTASTIC!!!!

When I made my dish, I decided not to add the Mexican seasonings to this one. Instead I used my seasonings ( garlic pepper, parsley, seasoning/salt, pepper). I also added canned chopped tomato, minced garlic, oregano, freshly chopped celery & onion. I guess you could say that I made it with an Italian flair. I then topped it all off with shredded cheddar cheese. I also opted not to use the oven since it was already cooking on the stove top & it was an extremely hot summer day! I also used cooked macaroni instead of noodles for this one. It turned out Great! It was delicious as well as filling & nutritious.

I thought this was just OK.  It was lacking something.  It did not taste bad, but it was not great.  If I try this again  I may increase the salsa to 1/3 cup and use a medium heat level instead of a mild heat level.

I feel terrible writing a negative review when so many others loved this, but we really disliked this dish. I don't think the flavors were bad (I followed everything exactly), but the noodles just gave it a bad texture/taste. Maybe with rice it would be better.

Since I am vegan I sub the meat with veggie protein. I added just a hint of vegan cream cheese and sprinkled the top with vegan parm. Its comfort food at its best. Not something you should have all of the time due to the fat content but if your craving comfort food (yes, we vegans like comfort food) then this is your recipe!

Even with the taco seasoning and chili, I thought this casserole was pretty bland.  I might make it again, but, next time, I would add the taco seasoning while browning the meat, onion and celery.   I little salt and pepper might help too.

I also think 250 F is too cool.  Better to bake it at 350 F for 20 minutes, I think.  I made the recipe according to the directions and still had to heat plates in the microwave.

I added some shredded cheddar cheese to the top before baking.  I think that was a good addition.

Not bad, just not great.  Leftovers were gone the next day.

This was good, easy.  The celery adds a bit of a crunch to it.  The only addition was to top it with shredded cheddar cheese.

I really liked but a couple of things - in my opinion it needed salt and I placed shredded cheddar cheese on top.

Made it and loved it.  I think next time I'm gonna use rotel tomatoes in it tho. to give it a little kick.  I also used Pace Picante sauce for my salsa. On the chili I used a chili with beans and it was delish!!  I omitted the celery only because my family doesnt like it...Will forsure b making this one again!!  Its simple to make and a real crowd pleaser!!  Would b a perfect casserole for any occasion. Church, Family gathering, etc..I say...yay on this one!!!

Okay. A lot of ingredients just make no sense so I changed it up. Also, doubled the recipe to get more food for an actual family to eat.

I followed the original recipe, but I mixed Corn Bread and poured it on top of the casserole and baked it for 35 minutes at 375 degrees (per instructions on Corn Bread Mix) .  It was DELICIOUS !  Definitely will make this yummy dish again!

This is an awesome recipe!!!! I made it without salsa because our family doesn't like spicy things very much, and we added sour cream and cheese to our individual bowls as we wanted to. I'll definitely be making this many, many times!

Followed the recipe almost exactly.Substitutions were made due to not having one ingredient. I didn't have any salsa, so added another can of diced tomatoes. I used one can of Rotel diced tomatoes, and another almost full can of regular diced tomatoes. I also just eyeballed the amount of noodles, so may have added a little more than called for. Given these minor changes, the recipe was very good. My husband and I both enjoyed it. I will make it again. The really nice thing about this recipe, is that you can add or delete ingredients as you wish, and it will still be delicious. Thanks for the recipe. It is definitely a keeper.

this dish is actually one of my grandmothers  ancient recipes, so heres her version of it, which I think is perfect. use one pound ground beef, half a can of mushroom, a can of corn, egg noodles, and 2 cans of tomato soup. mix it all together once all items have been cooked separately and enjoy!

I didn't use chili, and used one can of Rotelle, w/lime and cilantro instead of tomatoes.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic but will use fresh garlic next time.  I didn't cook the egg noodles in advance; instead, I added 2 cups of beef broth at the end after adding veggies and then added the noodles.  I brought the mixture to a boil and then simmered on medium low for aprx 10 minutes to allow the noodles to absorb the liquid.  It was a little salty to me, though the rest of the family didn't think so.  I might add a little less seasoning next time or I might cook the noodles in advance next time.

My 9 year old picked the recipe and it was easy for her to follow along and help out with. We omitted the corn per her request. Turned out good!  My kids (5&9) went back for seconds and they’re pretty picky!

I didn't variate from the original recipe, but I did top it off with some asiago-parmesan, and romano cheese, delicious!

It was amazing!  I used a bag of frozen Niblets corn since it's so much better than canned corn. I didnt have salsa so i used an 8oz can of tomato sauce to give it the liquid it needed.  It was spicy enough since I used a package of 'Hot' taco seasoning. I used rice instead of noodles. 
I sprayed my pan with non-stick spray, then put parchment paper over that and sprayed again to prevent sticking.
We treated it like nachos. We lined our bowls with tortilla chips,  piled on the casserole, sprinkled pickled jalapenos over it  and then a dollop of sour cream.  Super good. Will make it again.

Turned out great.  My daughter added cheese because she said it didn't have enough flavor.  I would also try without the taco seasoning in the future.

This was a great easy one dish meal. It makes a lot so I ended up freezing some of it. I did add some Ranch Style beans I had in the frig and some sour cream. Topped with a little cheese.

Not much, but I did squeeze a fresh lime into the mixture.  I used a blended Mexican Cheese for topping.  I used Hot Dog Chili for the chili.

Easy to make.  Good for a potluck dish.

Made with some suggestions from others such as stewed tomatoes for more flavor.  Added cheese and taco chips and to serve needed taco sauce.  After the changes it still didn't have enough flavor.  The next day it was way too dry.  I added 1 cup beef broth and consistency was much better.  I make a similar dish with rice that I will probably stick to.  Was fun to try something new but probably won't make it again.

I made some changes based on availability and preference. I omitted corn and celery. I used chili spice packet instead of taco powder and kidney beans. Instead of chili.  I added shreddded cheddar when it went in the oven. Tasty and easy. I’ll make again, I’m sure

Was great! Added Cayenne Pepper and some extra chili to thicken it up. I also used rotini because I didn't have egg noodles Next time I will cook longer to reduce it and thicken up more.

I hate celery and I have a neighbour that can't digest onion! What to do? I substituted both for a can of diced green chilis, cooked with the meat and then made the rest of the recipe as written. People raved about it, wanted leftovers and/or the recipe. It was a huge success!!

I used frozen Picksweet Seasoning blend instead of chopping onion and celery. I added garlic cube and cilantro cubes (frozen). I used my on seasoning instead of mix (garlic powder, cumin and chile powder). I added Hatch chiles. Topped it with cheese. 
We loved it!!

This is an easy recipe full of flavor.  I fixed it as written but tasting as I went.  I added about 1 tsp of cumin and 1tsp of garlic powder.  I had to make it ahead of time.  I kept it refrigerated for the day and heated it in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncovered.

Family loved this. The only change I made: I do not like canned chili. Something about the texture/mouth feel of canned chili creeps me out. So I omitted the chile and substituted a can of Rotel with chilis. I also did not have any celery, so that got left out. Leaving out one stalk of celery certainly did not change the taste, given celery's relatively bland flavor. I also used salsa verde in place of red salsa, though I don't think it made any difference. Be prepared: it makes a big casserole; and as delicious as it is, I was grateful: there'll be leftovers.

I made this for dinner and everyone liked it.  I doubled the recipe but instead of corn I used black beans and I also added 1 cup of sour cream.  I also took the advice of others review and added cheese to the top.  This is a keeper and I will be making this one again.  Thank you for a great and easy recipe

Instead of the chili, I added a can of kidney beans and I replaced the corn with yellow peppers. It was delicious. To save on dishes, next time, I will warm it up on the stove top.

Excellent  recipe! I followed what was suggested but did add to this by adding 3 cloves garlic, 1/3 cup of salsa rather than 1/4 cup and then added fresh ground pepper plus some turmeric. 
I’ll definitely be fixin this again soon!!

yes, I used rice instead of noodles I did add corn but next time I will add corn with peppers and onions ( can). My granddaughter went wild over this and so did my husband. Our son does not like anything with corn in it so he would not even try it. Ho! well that is his lost. This casserole was great I would fix this for any meal even when company comes over. You could even freeze this if you use rice. Noodles get to soggy

I used the recipe but did things totally different.  I browned the beef with the onion and celery.  Rinsed to remove the grease because the burger I used was high fat.  I added the rest of the ingredients, including UNCOOKED egg noodles and 4 cups water to the skillet.  I heated to boiling then reduced to a simmer  and cooked, covered about 15 mins.  then uncovered and cooked until noodles were done and the casserole was nice and thick.  I dished it into bowls and topped with shredded cheese.

I honestly loved this recipe and so did my family. The only changes I made was to spice the meat and veggies with garlic powder and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Otherwise I just doubled the recipe and used elbow noodles because that's what I had on hand and doubled the salsa. I mixed cheese inside the mixture before putting it in the oven then put some extra on top to melt before serving. This will probably be added to the family rotation because it wasn't too spicy and very flavorful! You will be going back for seconds (or thirds)!

It was ok. Good use with hamburger. I was running out of ideas with hamburger. I probably wouldnt make it again. It's pretty much like Hamburger Helper Chili Mac but more time. Just ok. :-)

I used the previous suggestions and used rice.  Added rotel tomatoes & reg diced.  Used mexican cheese in and on top.  Added extra cumin and red pepper & chili powder.  Omitted the salsa.  Browned ground meat with onions & garlic.  Once everything was in pan I added the rice, let it meld then added everything to a casserole dish and baked at 375 for 20 mins.

Pretty good and easy.   I added a cup of shredded cheese to make it a little creamier.  Also, I used a can of Mexicorn and a can of Rotells instead of the salsa and regular corn.

This is the perfect casserole!  Made as written with the following changes or specifics: used 90% lean pastured ground beef, Trader Joes vegetarian chili, a jar of Trader Joes Corn & Chile Tomato-less Salsa (in place of both corn & salsa) & homemade taco seasoning (from this site).  I didn't have the baking dish it called for so baked in very deep glass vessel, done in three layers with Trader Joes shredded Mexican blend cheese, including on the top.  As other reviewers advised, I baked it at 350 degrees.  OMG!  YUM!  A very homey, comforting dish with a spicy kick.

I happened to have everything this recipe called for and made it has described except I tripled the salsa. We had last minute drop in guests the hamburger dish I had planned to make needed to accommodate 8 people. We still had left overs. Thank you Sal for saving the night. We had compliments by all.

Followed the recipe and added cheddar cheese on top and the family loved  it! 
It took me less then forty-five minutes from start to finish. 
Not bad for a home cooked meal.

It was very tasty. I had to add some half and half to reduce the saltiness and make it more creamy. I did add Mexican cheese on top. Everyone loved it. Thanks.

We liked it - my 14-year-old LOVED it. I made a couple of adjustments based on what I had in the cabinet - substituted red beans for the chili, and Pampered Chef southwest seasoning for the taco seasoning, and chopped bell peppers for the celery. Next time I'll add a can of tomato soup to bind it together a little better, and substitute Quinoa for the egg noodles. This will be GREAT warmed up!

I made this. and it turned out great ! I skipped the celery and I used 6 cups cooked min rice instead of noodles and I also left out the salda. I mixed in 1cup mexican blend shredded cheese then baked at 350 for 15 minutes then sprinkled. a little more cheese on top and baked another 5 minutes. I served this with sour cream and salsa all rolled up in a flour tortillas. Everybody loved them.

We loved this dish. I did not have chili but had all other ingredients. I used about a cup of tomato sauce and 1/2 cup of water.   I added cheese on top about 5min before baking time was over.   Very good.

Easy and very satisfying. I changed things based on others' reviews: rice instead of noodles, omit celery, add shredded cheese on top, and I also subbed onion powder and jarred minced garlic. One other change I made was to top the casserole with broken fritos and more shredded cheddar, then returning to oven for another 5 minutes. Great recipe, and I'll definitely be making many more times!

One of the easiest, best recipes I've tried on this site so far. I prepped the night before and when the girls and I got done with a busy day of hiking, we threw it in the oven. I added 10 minutes to the cooking time for the cheese. We finished more than half of a 9X13 inch pan in about 10 minutes! Excellent!

My husband and I both loved this recipe and I didn't even have all of the ingredients!  We were actually shocked at how tasty it was.  I didn't have any canned chili or noodles on hand, so I just made the recipe with the rest of the ingredients.  The only thing I did different was I added about a cup of salsa and I added some shredded cheese to the top.  Other than, I made it exactly how it is written.  It was delicious!  I paired it with a dollop of sour cream and some lightly salted tortilla chips.  Fantastic recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight and had to list my review right away. I did make a few changes out of necessity. I browned 1 lb ground beef and drained, added 1 chopped onion and 2 stalks chopped celery and cooked until tender. Added the taco seasoning packet, 1 cup of water, 1 can of black beans(drained),1 can of Mexican flavored Rotel with the juice, I skipped the corn because I didn't have any. I used white rice in place of the noodles and mixed it in with the ground meat mixture, put in a greased baking dish, topped with shredded cheese and baked for 20 minutes at 350. Served with avocado, sour cream and chopped cilantro. Yum! I would have hit it with a squeeze of lime if I had any.

Yeah, no.  It was OK but a little too spicy. Maybe if you cooked the taco seasoning into the ground beef (adding water) it would be better. Served 2 casseroles, and the Easy Mexican Casserole was the BIG hit!

I used ground Venison instead of beef.  I also put the taco seasoning on the meat while it was cooking as well as cumin and mexican chili powder.  I will be making this again it was so good.

Delicious. Substituted rice for the noodles and added black beans as well.  I simmered in a large skillet instead of baking in the oven.

This is going to be one of our favorites!  The only thing I changed was the noodles - used the regular macaronni noodle.  But otherwise I followed the recipe.  I will have to serve with cornbread as I read in another review.

This was so yummy!  We added a can of mixed beans, and omitted the canned chili. To make things a little spicier, we sauteed the onions and celery in jalapeno olive oil, as well as the beef and then mixed everything together.We used rice instead of noodles and topped it off with crushed up tortilla chips and lots of cheese. Definitely a family favorite!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have the stewed tomatoes on hand, so I substituted Rotelle, tomatoes and green chiles, which added a little heat.  Will have this again.

This was actually the best hamburger casserole that I've had.  I liked the Mexican flair to it!  I followed the recipe exactly except just used a half a can of corn and omitted the celery.  Oh, I added cheese on top too.

This was pretty good but not spectacular, and easy.  I mostly made it as is, except I always substitute onion power or juice since I have a cooked onion texture hang-up.  It sort of reminded me of a mild chili with noodles.  Has the added bonus that I usually have these ingredients around so it's good for spur of the moment.  Also good for lunch leftovers for work.  Cheese nor sour cream occured to me (duh), but both sound like good additions.

This was very good, even my 7  year old daughter liked it. My 16 year old son loves things a bit spicier, so he added more zing to his, but said it was a definite keeper.

We enjoyed this dish.  Of course like everyone else I did a little rearranging of the ingredients.  Due to the picky eaters around my house, I left out the onions and the celery and put the corn as a side dish.  I sprinkled shredded cheese on top and it ended up very good!

I thought it tasted much too "canned"- seeming as most ingredients do come from a can.  Not bad, but probably won't be making again.

The family thought that it was bland and my son didn't like it at all. I would make it again with my own variations probalby with more seasonings and with cheese.

This was okay for me. Pretty decent with some crushed tortilla chips on top and cheese. Not sure if I'll be making it again though.

This dish had very nice flavor, but I found it very dry, and I added large can tomatoes as well as almost 1 cup of salsa.  I grated cheese and crushed corn chips for topping and was good, but overall don't know if I'll be making this one again.  Sorry.
