excellent blend of flavors.  used calamata olives and oil cured olives.  pan seared each side of tuna for exactly 3 minutes each side to maintain pink inside.  served with thinly sliced eggplant dipped in light batter and sauteed in olive oil till crisp.  will cook again!

If you like tuna and olives, I think you would like this.  If you don't, why would you try?!  Couscous by itself can be bland and dry for me, so I mixed in vegetables that I roasted with a little garlic and rosemary.  Adds vitamins, too.  Although if I were to make this again, (hubby wants me to) I think I would rather pair it with a good green salad and some crispy roasted potatoes.

This dish was good, but if I make it again I'll probably play around with the ingredients. The olives and the lemon juice made it quite tart -- I might halve the lemon juice and maybe try adding some sugar. The "pan-seared" made me think it would be rare inside, but if you cook according to directions it's done or a little overdone throughout. I probably will try making it again, because I did like the olive-wine sauce. With preparation time (and I'm a pretty slow preparer), it took a little over an hour to make.

Gourmet flavor with simple prep—my favorite kind of meal. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a few more olives and used olive oil instead of cooking spray. The sauce was very tangy, but the bite was balanced by the velvety texture of the rare tuna (definitely go with rare--you won’t get the same flavor and texture if it’s well-done; I seared a thick steak for about 2 min per side). The sauce tasted pretty strong before I reduced it, but it mellowed out after simmering for 5 min. I’m not a fan of couscous, so I served this with the Mediterranean Greek Salad from this site, and it was a great combination.

My wife really loved this recipe.  (I am not sure if she was just being sweet because I cooked two recipes from here two nights in a row.)  The sauce was excellent but if I make this again, I will reduce the time on the tuna a bit.

This was fabulous, flavorful, and extremely filling. I made it for my husband on Valentine's day and he was very impressed. I will certainly make it again.

The sauce tasted kind of wierd with the Olives, and did not reduce very well after the 2 minutes.

The tuna was very flavorful. The fennel was subtle but totally MADE this dish. I only had a dry red wine on hand but it tasted great!!

This is a very interesting and taste-filled dish. I highly recommend this to someone who likes something different, or medeterranian food. A caveat: it is a bit time consuming to prepare, but very worth it. If you are having a dinner party, this dish is sure to impress.

Fantastic! I was a little apprehensive about the green olives, but the wine, olives and garlic went very well together.  I used frozen albacore tuna steaks and there was no fishy taste at all and the sauce was delicious.

Extremely flavorful. I fixed this for four adults and they literally cleaned their plates. A great recipe for a special occasion. Make you have plenty of time for preparation. It's worth it!
