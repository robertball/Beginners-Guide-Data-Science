This recipe. Is not your traditional pancake---but it is definitely delicious if you like sweets. We love this in our house! You don't pour the sauce on but tear off a piece of the pancake and dip it in the sauce. It is yummy-licious!

For the pancakes I used half AP flour and half whole wheat flour which meant I had to increase the milk just a touch because whole wheat flour tends to soak up the liquid quicker than AP flour. I made no other changes. Honestly this was so incredibly sweet it was inedible even for my kids. On top of that the pancakes tasted mostly of baking powder and sugar. I'm sorry this recipe just wasn't for us. I feel terrible being your first reviewer of your recipe and it just wasn't for us. Maybe I could try the syrup with a different pancake recipe and re-review.

The peanut butter sauce in this recipe is fantastic. I used all of the sugar water so it was more of a syrup consistency. If I was basing my rating on the sauce alone it would have warranted a five star. I will definitely use it again. The pancakes as written in this recipe did not work. The batter was a dough after the addition of 3/4 cups milk. I added an additional cup of milk to get it to the right consistency. They came out alright after that but they were very sweet. I would recommend cutting the sugar in half.

I followed other reviewers' advice and cut the sugar in half. These still tasted like a dessert. It was sickly sweet. My kiddos simply picked at them. I could not finish even one pancake. I would not make these again.

Wow! Three are too sweet. I used half the amount of sugar and still feel that it's too much. Also had to double the milk. Might be because I used whole wheat flour. Not terrible... but not great.

I made these this morning for my family and they were a HUGE success!!! With a few alterations based on the previous two reviews I would HIGHLY recommend!!! I cut the sugar it called for in half. Using 1/4 c in the simple syrup and 1/2 c sugar in the batter. I used a lot more milk than what the actually recipe called for. I cannot give an exact measurement because I just added until I got the desired consistency. In addition to the peanut butter I melted down a small handful of chocolate chips. (I'd guess around 1/2 c) The pancakes were wonderful just by themselves. They were thick yet fluffy and delicious!!! The sauce was amazing too!!! My very petite three year old ate 3 pancakes!!!! The only reason I'm giving it four stars and not five is becuase I do feel some alterations are necessary. Thanks for the base to a wonderful recipe! These will be a new favorite in our house!!!

The peanut butter sauce was tasty. I used peanut butter powder instead of regular. The pancakes were almost too sweet and I had to add a lot more milk to reach the proper consistency. Even after the addes milk the finished cakes were rather dry. I don't think I'll make be making these again although the sauce is a keeper.

I would like to start out by saying I only made the "syrup." It was very disgusting looking and just did not look appetizing. Although it tasted OK I would have preferred something more viscous.
