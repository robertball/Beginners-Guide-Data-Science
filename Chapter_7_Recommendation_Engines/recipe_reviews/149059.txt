My kids love making these cookies.  We have fun with all our cutters.  Be sure to butter your cutters to make removing them from the cookie easier.

This worked great! I would like to suggest that you "re-piece" the scraps. It works to smoosh them back together to get more cookies.

Who doesn't love a Rice Krispie Treat?  We added purple and green sprinkles to the cereal, cut out stars and flowers, skewered them and called them Tinkerbell wands for my 3 year old's birthday party.  Too cute!

Peanut butter is a must have for this recipe!  I just stir a tablespoon or more in with the melted marshmallows before the cereal.

Easy! The kids loved making these, and eating these! My girls and I cut out hearts and tiaras for their princess party. I used gel food coloring added to the marshmallow mixture. I used Betty Crocker's butter cream frosting- the only kind I make- and added some gel food coloring to this as well. They were a big hit at the party. Fun fun fun!

Crispy crunchy and gooey, sweet but not not overly sweet. We loved these!
