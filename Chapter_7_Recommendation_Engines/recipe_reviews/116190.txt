I made this for a party with 20 attendees.  Cheesecake was also served.  At the end of the night the tart was completely eaten and half of the cheesecake remained.  Several people said they really liked the tart.  It did have a very nice flavor.  My only problem was that it had bit too much liquid and some spilled over one side of the crust.  The liquid was sticky and made removing the tart from the pan difficult.  I am making this again Christmas day and plan on cutting back on the brown sugar a bit (1/4 cup)and removing the tart from the pan as soon as it is out of the oven.

This tart was a huge success and tasted great.  It was also incredibly easy.  I increased the cranberries to 3 cups fresh (or 1 package) and increased the apples to 3 medium.  This eliminated the juice problem from too much sugar, I also omitted the butter.

Right on with the tartness of the cranberries and the sweetness of the apples. I made as directed but used 4 small apples and the entire bag of cranberries and forgot to add the dab of butter before applying the top crust. Overall, this was a nice change from Grandma Opals apple pie from this site which is killer.

This is amazing.  It is hands down my favorite recipe found on this site to date.  I didn't use the butter and i made two in much smaller tart pans.  I also took one reviewers advice and did 3 cups of cranberries and 3 apples.  Worked amazingly!  It was more than halfway eaten only minutes after i pulled it from the oven.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit!   Was a great change/addition to all the pumpkin desserts that are always made.  I used a whole bag of fresh cranberries that I ran through my chopper and 2 granny smith apples that after they were peeled did the same thing.  Super easy to make and baked up beautifully!  I used a leaf cookie cutter and cut out 6 leaves and arranged them on top of the tart before baking.  40 minutes was perfect!

So surprisingly yummy! I used Granny Smith apples and it turned out perfect. I also used a regular pie pan and it worked out fine. Serving this a la mode is a must!

Really easy and very pretty. Next time I'll use the same concept, but maybe with a cheesecake layer on the bottom.
