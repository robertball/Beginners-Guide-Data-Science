This did not taste like a pumpkin soup. It was more like a thin bean broth and cumin soup. The cumin was completely dominant as that was all I could taste with a heavy ginger after taste. I even reduced the ginger. I hate rating recipes low even oddly despite wasting ever costly food ingredients. The photo looked great too but unfortunately no one would eat this one and attempts to fix it afterwards just did not amount to changing the odd heavy flavors much.

I added shredded chicken to make it an all around hearty meal.

Great taste and body. I added about 50% more Ginger and Cumin.
