Used skim milk & Splenda Brown Sugar Blend to get the calories down. I did cut the peach slices into chunks because, otherwise, I'd just be cutting the slices with my spoon while eating.  I cooked for a total of 4 minutes (microwave times will vary) and was rewarded with a warm bowl of oatmeal with tasty bites of peach.  Very, very nice and quick and easy, too!  Thanks, Marcie, for a new breakfast favorite!

I also cut the peach slices into chunks. Scaled the recipe to 2 and had enough for 3 :) did it all on a pan on the stove, seemed easier, worked great and tasted wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

I don't own a microwave and used 1-2 fresh peaches for this recipe. It took about 20 minutes on the stove and turned out great! Will use less sugar next time though. I used less and it was still too much.

Yum! I made this using fresh peaches (1-2  peaches will replace the canned), and did it on the stove top. I put the peaches and brown sugar in first (cut the sugar; it was a bit too sweet), and cooked for a few minutes until the peaches started bubbling and getting a bit caramelized. Then I added the remaining ingredients, tossing in a few raisins as well, and cooked until the oats were done. The kids loved this.

I loved this recipe!  I did use a large fresh peach and substituted with unsweetened almond milk. I think the next time I will cut back on the brown sugar though.

This was great! I substituted canned, light coconut milk for regular milk and coconut sugar for regular sugar. I also added a little vanilla and cooked it on the stove. It was delicious and a great way to start a chilly Sunday morning!!

I used honey instead of sugar, and coconut milk instead of whole milk. I really enjoyed the recipe. I love oatmeal and the fresh peaches, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract really worked well with the other ingredients!

Totally good! I hate oatmeal and this is actually yummy. My only tip is cover on the last 3rd minute because mine expanded in the microwave and I had to clean it out which put a real damper on the day. I used soy milk instead of regular milk and it was still super tasty

This is a nice tasting oatmeal. I only made half a serving, and along with my coffee and toast, it was plenty for me for breakfast. Mine only took 60 seconds total to cook in the microwave.

Good recipe. I used canned peaches in fruit juice. I used some of the fruit juice to thin the oatmeal. I used all milk instead of half milk and half water and cut the brown sugar in half. One tablespoon of brown sugar is more than sufficient. I may be cutting the brown sugar down even further to just one teaspoon. All in all, very tasty.

For a 5 point WW friendly breakfast, in a microwavable bowl, add 3/4 water and 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the old fashioned oatmeal and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Remove and add a container of Del Monte Peach Chunks, no sugar added, 3/4 cup of unsweetened Almond Milk, 3/4 tsp. Truvia Brown Sugar Blend and a couple of packet of Truvia sweetener. I really enjoy a hot sweet dessert type oatmeal with a cup of coffee to start my day!

Aside from using a fresh peach, I made no changes. I like the taste of this, and while it's a lovely texture I think a little more liquid may be needed. A dash of vanilla extract would be a welcome addition as well as toasted chopped pecans. This is a great recipe!

So good! I made it on the stove top because I always boil over oatmeal in the microwave and I wanted to double the recipe. Made no changes other than that.
