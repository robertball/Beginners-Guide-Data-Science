It was great no easy to make but would like to see what oven temp to use.  I went with 350 which seemed to work well.

Life saver!  Had a large bag of  thawed frozen berries and didn't know what to do with them .  I found this recipe and it was just what the doctor ordered.  Drained most of the liquid off the berries, put them in a greased 9X10 pan; sprinkled maple sugar on them; then put the topping on. (I used coconut oil instead of safflower oil and added a little cinnamon.) Also made it GF friendly with Bob's Red Mill All purpose Baking Flour. It was a hit at coffee hour. Served it with Vanilla Yogurt.

Delish!!  I used 2 cups blueberries and 2 cups raspberries. Baked it in an 8”x8” glass baking dish for 25 mins at 350*. I used regular flour and vegetable oil. We ate it warm w whipped cream. Definitely will be making again!!

Easy recipe with some blueberries and plumbs from the backyard.  Cooked @350. Used honey instead of brown sugar.  Making again with blackberries and peaches.

Great recipe. Easy to triple for a crowd and quick to put together. I added a spoon of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the fruit. Baked at 350 (recipe doesn't say). Served with speculoos cookie butter ice cream! Loads of compliments.

Very easy to make.  I did substitute coconut oil for the vegetable oil.  I thought about adding cinnamon, but didn't.  The flavor was delicious...it didn't need it.  I might add more topping next time...maybe.
Great with ice cream!

Quick and easy.  I substituted Splenda and Agave for sugar.  Lower in calories and was delicious!
