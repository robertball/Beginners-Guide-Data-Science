I changed this slightly to make it easier for me.  I used crushed pineapple and I added a dash of ground cloves.  It dissappeared quickly!  My husband loves it!

I fixed these on the George Foreman grill tonight and we really liked them. I omitted the red pepper just because I forgot to buy one! Very good and I will surely make it again.

I thought this was a great light summer meal.  I also made it into a wrap.  I used pineapple chunks and put them on the grill in tin foil and some of the honey mustard sauce that I made from another recipe on the site.  I also put the roasted red peppers on the grill in tin foil with light seasonings.  Used more of the honey mustard to top it off.  Everyone loved it!

I marinated the chicken in a honey mustard dipping sauce I made from the site, and then put the chicken on the bbq and toward the end basted it with teriyaki sauce.  Everyone loved this sandwich!

Love love love it :)  The only thing I changed was I made it more "sandwichy" and added mayo and lettuce as well. I didn't use exactly a tbsp of honey mustard.  I brushed each side, grilled it and brushed it again. I also grilled the pineapple and the red pepper slices on the top rack of the grill.  I def recommend that -- Peppers are so much better grilled.  My husband and I ate these on a night when the kiddos weren't home though -- and we went back for seconds.  FANTASTIC.

We liked these sandwiches - a nice alternative to the turkey sandwich or beef burger.

It was ok.  I think I might need to add more honey mustard after I put the sandwich together.

Nice flavours, but I think next time I'll put it in a wrap to make sure everything stays together.

Really good but added provolone cheese, Carmelites onions, and used more of the honey mustard :)

I liked it!  Easy and quick.  I broiled since it was rainy outside.  I also broiled the red bell pepper strips.

I have tried this before but never used the honey mustard. I used something but can't remember what, senior moment! Just got a new outdoor George Forman grill (love it) Easier for me than gas & cleans very nicely. People laughed when I told them about this recipe, until they tried it. No more laughs! I wouldn't change or add a thing.

Very simple. We liked it. I would've liked a little more sauce for a richer flavor. It seemed a little dry, just going from the recipe.

Good basic grilled chicken sandwich. I used Chef John's Honey Mustard Sauce Recipe and cooked this on my George Foreman. The meat did need salt and pepper.
