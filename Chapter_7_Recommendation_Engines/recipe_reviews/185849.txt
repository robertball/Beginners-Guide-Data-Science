I fixed this for dinner last night and it was absolutely delicious.  I halved the recipe and the only subs I used were sliced baby bella schrooms and I used olive oil spray for the oils.  I followed it exactly right down to cooking the filets 5 min on each side then resting for 10 min at which time I finished the sauce.  My husband likes his meat more well done so I sliced him two medallion sized pieces off the tenderloin roast and my rare-medium piece was thicker.  For the guacamole I mashed two avocados and used lemon juice but I didn't have a fresh jalapeno so I took a jar of salsa and rinsed it off leaving the diced chilis, tomato, and onion chunks.  I used about a tablespoon of that!  LOL Creative Cooking at it's finest.  I served it on the plate with tri colored tortilla strip salad toppers on top.  It was a refreshing taste to go with the richness of the meat dish.  For my starch I used a russet potato, peeled, cored, and spiral sliced on my apple peeler, then cooked it in butter, ground pepper and sea salt in a frying pan.   I can attest that it did take about two hours to fix.  I pre-slice/cut/measure all my ingredients before I start cooking and that made the cooking time smoother.  It wasn't the greatest choice for a week day meal but it sure was good!  I wish I had taken a picture of the plate and will be sure to next time!  Bon Appetite!

I followed the recipe loosely, using boneless chicken breasts instead of filet mignon as I felt it was a better fit - I prefer my filet with salt, pepper and little else.  (Ok, maybe a dab of butter).  I also altered the seasoning to what you might use for fajitas. I skipped the beurre blanc because it was not needed, and better suited for fish or seafood.  This is a nice dish with a beautiful presentation but the recipe itself is unnecessarily lengthy and complicated.  Just cook up some peppers, top them with a nice filet (or in my case a well-seasoned chicken breast) and a dollop of guacamole.  Done.

The green peppers were so good that we are going to start cooking them with other meals too. We didn't have shallots so we substituted with onion using half a medium onion in the dip which turned out to be too much but next time we'll use less. Definitely a great recipe to try out if you have a lot of time to get it ready like on a weekend.

What a great recipe!  I tried this last night and it was a big hit at a dinner.  One of my guests is a culinary school graduate so I knew I had a high bar to clear.  I made a few adaptations to the recipe as follows.  I made a spice rub (smoked paprika, garlic salt, brown sugar, salt, chili powder, black pepper, onion powder) and appied it to the beef the day before I cooked it.  I roasted the tenderloin in the oven at 275 degrees until it reached a temperature of 140 degrees.  This slow roasting method (a la Alton Brown) really sealed in the juices and kept the meat tender.  After the meat reached 140 degrees, I removed the tenderloin from the oven and rubbed it with an olive oil and herb combo and then pan seared it for 1-2 minutes each side.  I then let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting. When cutting it, the meat had the nice red color and was very juicy and tender. I put the bell pepper and mushroom mixture on the plate, put several slices of the tenderloin on top, and then poured over it a delicious cilantro-lime butter finishing sauce. I put the guacamole on top and then sprinkled tri-color tortilla strips on top.  I have included a picture. Voila!  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will definitley be making this again at my next dinner party. Even my friend's 6-year old asked for "seconds"!
