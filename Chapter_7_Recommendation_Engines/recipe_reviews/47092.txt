This was simply delicious. The orange and soy flavor is a perfect accompaniment to turkey. Has definitely become a new family favorite.

This was a very tasty and aromatic recipe, but I've made better with no recipe at all!

I just made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out wonderfully!!!!  I'll definetly be using this recipe again and again!  The one thing that I changed was before I put the turkey in the oven, I sliced 6 cuts into the sides of the turkey and placed 1 tbsp of butter into each opening.  It helped make the turkey even more moist and tasty.  Great recipe!

Very good, smelled wonderful while roasting, and browned up nicely.
