I tried this recipe once with apples, and as crazy as it sounds, I tried  bananas too. It was wonderful! Dice the bananas and spritz with lemon juice before adding pudding mix. This recipe is also great when added to a graham cracker crust!

This recipe is very good if you add mini marshmellows and chopped cocoa nut instead of the peanuts. This is very good.

I was amazed at how good this was!  It tastes almost exactly like Scotcharoos bars, only it's full of healthy goodness!  I thought it was a tad soupy, so I think I will add some sliced bananas to it next time to add more chunks to the pudding/Cool Whip mixture.  I also chopped the nuts, so there was more peanutty flavor in every bite.  I will definitely be making this recipe often!

TOTALLY loved! I was really surprised with this recipe. 1st, I wasn't sure about adding peanuts & pineapple. 2nd, was if my kids would love it and it being a waste. Which it wasn't. I'll make this again and see how it tastes without the pineapple. But 3 of my children really loved it. 3rd-ly, I made fresh whip topping and added a whip topping stabilizer so that, my whip topping wasn't runny when combined. I think that was a better fit for what I was going for because the pudding really thickened up everything. Will keep this recipe in rotation with other fruited dishes. TY. Will make again.

I used sugar free pudding to reduce the calories.  It wasn't my favorite salad but my company really liked it.  We used pecans instead of peanuts because that's how I originally had the recipe.  I really really liked the pecans and would not want peanuts.  We thought it would be awesome with some cream cheese in it, some toffee bits and some caramel drizzles in top.  But that wouldn't be too healthy, would it?

This was a good base fruit salad.  I wasn't able to use nuts due to allergies so I had to add other things to give it some more flavor.  I think with the nuts it would have had a yummy taffy apple flavor.  Without the nuts I added coconut, maraschino cherries and mini marshmallows

I've used this recipe for a couple of years now and I always get rave reviews!  The only alterations I make are to add 1/2 package of mini marshmallows, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

I didn't add the peanuts but may try it next time.  This can be low fat if you choose the right ingredients and then you won't feel bad having a second helping (because you will).  It takes like a caramel apple and the pineapple is wonderful in it!  Thanks!

This was not very good at all.  Most of it went uneaten.  It was also not a very appetizing dish to look at. I'm just glad I did not spend a lot of money on ingredients.  Sorry.

Just made this recipe for a funeral dinner, and it was well received. I've already been asked for the recipe:) 
I did make one change and that was to add a bit of crunch and garnish. I crushed 1 sleeve of graham crackers, added 1/3 cup melted margarine and 1/3 cup sugar...then toasted in the oven about 8 minutes to crisp it up.  I added half of this mixture to the salad, and used the other half to sprinkle over the top for garnish. Great recipe -thanks for sharing with us. God Bless

This was very tasty. I used a can of pineapple tidbits instead of crushed because I like the texture better. Omitted the nuts because I didn't have any but I bet it would be even better with them. I also used sugar free/fat free pudding mix and lite cool whip. Nice snack without the guilt.

Made for a church covered dish lunch and seemed to go over well. Only change was to use pineapple tidbits instead of crunched pineapple. Also got bright red apples and left the skin on to provide a little more color.

This was awful; very soupy and the apples were very mushy after sitting overnight.

I've been making this salad for years and have tried it with crushed pineapple and tidbits; I like the texture of the tidbits better. Also, I exchange the peanuts with cut up Snickers bars. Fold the Snickers in last or your chocolate will get stirred up too much. Bananas taste good in this too.

A family favorite!  Due to dietary restrictions we substitute mini marshmallows for the peanuts.  Kids LOVE this stuff!

This was good and I was asked for the recipe at a Thanksgiving gathering but I think it needs something extra to kick it up a notch. I did substitute pecans for peanuts (personal preference) and French Vanilla Cool Whip for the plain whipped topping but it still needs something. I'm thinking of adding toffee chips the next time...and maybe more butterscotch pudding or perhaps butterscotch flavoring.
