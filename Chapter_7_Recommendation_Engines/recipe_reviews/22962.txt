Another interesting cocktail. I've never had anything like it. I like it, but I'm
going to need to make another one to be sure I REALLY like it. ;)

Decent enough drink but I cannot rate this as Swamp Water. The genuine recipe for Swamp Water is 1.5 oz. of Green Chartreuse with 6 oz. pineapple juice and a quarter lime. It should be served in the traditional Mason jar glass, preferably with the Swamp Water gator on it. This was all the rage back in the '70s where it originated. Bars used to serve it in the correct 'glasses' and I had an entire set at home. You can often find original magazine advertisements for the drink for sale on eBay.

This is a fabulous drink. I found a tip by mistake. I served it at a party. I then put the extra in the refrigerator. After I drank some a week later and found the lemonade had fermented and it was the best thing I have ever had

Very nice for summer. Minor variations since nobody around here carries lime-flavored vodka any more. One time I added a tablespoon of key lime juice, another time a couple of drops of  (highly concentrated) lime flavoring from my baking supplies. Both work but I like the key lime juice a little better,
