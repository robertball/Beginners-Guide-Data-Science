Made it exactly as directed. My family was not a big fan. First they do not use Almond Milk or fresh Thyme in anything so it was a quite different than they were used to. Not that it's a bad recipe, just not for my family.

I sliced 10 potatoes.  I used 2% milk, 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1 c. chicken broth, 4 tbsps butter, 3 heaping tsps flour to make the sauce.  I didn't have Thyme, but I did put a Bay Leaf  in the sauce.  I added sharp cheddar and onion to the layering.  It looks AMAZING and the sauce is DELICIOUS!
