Good, but not near chocolate-y enough for us. I didn't bother swirling the caramel on top of the cocoa, I just stirred it in with the chocolate sundae syrup and the milk in the saucepan. My kids drank this as is but my husband and I stuck our mugs under the Keurig (eight ounces coffee to four ounces of cocoa) so we could have a "caramel mocha". I'd make this again but I think I'd stick with a homemade cocoa and add the caramel sundae syrup to it. It's a great idea and a good way to use up odd glass jars of sundae syrup in my fridge for a weekend treat.

This was fantastic!  I did not have the Smucker's chocolate topping so I used the chocolate syrup I had on hand.  I did have the caramel topping, though.  My kids LOVED it!!!

I never made hot chocolate like this before, but I came across the recipe using the Dinner Spinner App on my iPhone. I cut the milk back by 1/2 cup but followed the recipe otherwise. It makes a great tasting basic hot chocolate.
