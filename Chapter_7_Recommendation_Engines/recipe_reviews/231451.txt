Just made this, super fast and easy. Didn't have gomasio, used a little shiso furikake and dash of sea salt. Delicious!

This was only the second time I've cooked collards. First time, my wife wouldn't eat them. This time, she had seconds. Caveats: I didn't have mirin, so I used sake + raw sugar. I didn't have gomasio, so I used furikake, and only 1T of that. I did use the optional onions. I was quite pleased, especially since my large bunch of collards cost 29 cents.

It was, as advertised, quick and easy. But the collards tasted bitter. Maybe it was my batch. I was disappointed.
