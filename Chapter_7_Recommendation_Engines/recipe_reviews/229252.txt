Just made this and loved it!  The only thing I did differently was omit the brown sugar in the apple pear mixture.  I thought that the 3//4 of a up of brown sugar in the topping mixture was plenty.  It was.

I made this for dinner tonight, but since I am trying to lose some weight, I cut down on the brown sugar.  Having scaled the recipe to four servings, I used 1/4 c. in both the crumble and 1/4 c. in the fruit.  It was perfect!  My husband deemed it amazing, and I wish I could have had a full size portion!  Thanks for a keeper, Mel.

Thanks for sharing a great recipe. Simple to make and my entire family loved it served with vanilla ice cream. I made exactly as written and would not change a single thing.

I really liked this recipe and decided to change it up a bit just to see what I could do since the basic recipe was so good!  Mostly, like a couple of other posters mentioned I cut down on the sugar on the actual fruit some.  But that would be to personal taste.  But what I also did was try different fruit!  I think this would work great for just about any seasonal fruit you could think of!  My current fave is nectarines.  I just cut them up like apples and then tossed them in a small amount of the brown sugar and put the cinnamon in the topping instead of on the actual fruit.  Everyone that has tried it has said it was wonderful!  :D

Made this last night & my teenage son ate half the pan after his soccer game! We loved it with ALL the sugar plus chopped pecans on top for extra crunch.  Served it hot with vanilla ice cream & it was AMAZING! Tasted like apple pie ala mode but better!  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

I made this as directed and has too much sugar.  I think I would cut the sugar mixed with the apples down to less than half and add some lemon juice to balance the flavor (depending on the tartness of the apples) .  I would also add some salt to the topping to balance out the sweet there.

I wish I would’ve read the comments before I made it. Too sweet but delicious. I will make it again with half the brown sugar.

We have an apple tree & a pear tree, and this is my go-to recipe for using up all of that fruit! So easy, and I always have all of these ingredients on hand. I use a deep dish stoneware pie pan and substitute chopped walnuts for the almonds (just a personal preference). The BEST part for someone like me who is trying to use up fruit is that you can make the filling part (fruit, brown sugar, cinnamon) and FREEZE it! I freeze batches of filling so I can make a delicious dessert with fruit from my own yard any time I want!

I didn't add nuts but I did add Heath Bar Tidbits to the apple pear mixture. The recipe was easy to put together and delicious. The Heath Tidbits added extra flavor and crunch.

I made this with several changes others used. I used only apples and cut the brown sugar with the fruit and in the crumble in 1/2. Used 1/4 cup but might cut it down further. I also omitted the nuts but will try them the next time I make it. The only problem I had was there was liquid in the bottom of dish. Not sure why. Next time I will add a thickening agent. My husband said it was good but a tad sweet. Will make again. Is a very easy and simple recipe. Thanks for sharing..

This was way too sweet for me and had too much crumble. The crumble portion could have been halved.

I made this exactly as written except added a very few dried cranberries to the topping. Should have added them to the fruit mix as it was very wet. Otherwise quite good except as others noted, the amount of brown sugar made it sickly sweet. Will reduce the sugar by half next time and add a bit of corn starch and lemon to the fruit mix. I must add though, my husband loved it just as is!  Thanks.

I  adjusted the recipe and made it in an cast iron skillet, I've received nothing but rave reviews. With the combination of the Apple's and Pears it's a perfect match. Thanks go out to allrecipes.

A nice addition to our Thanksgiving dinner! The only change I made was to cut back on the amount of brown sugar that was to be added to the fruit mixture as the pears and apples I chose were both very sweet varieties.

A fabulous dessert!  I've used fresh blueberries and reduce the brown sugar a bit in both the blueberries  and the oat flour mixture because of health issues.  It has become a favorite with my family.

Made this substantially as written in order to give a fair review of the original recipe. I did cut back brown sugar to 1/2 cup tossed with fruit because the fruit was very sweet on its own (and because of other reviews). I had an abundance of pears that needed to be used so they didn't spoil so my fruit mix was 2/3 pears and 1/3 apples; didn't use any nuts because of a "nut hater" in the family. Mmmm ... Good stuff!

I used large flake oatmeal and halved the sugar as other reviews suggested...omG, good thing I made a double batch!  Will be making this again.  It was  unanimous hit.

I took the advice of others, omitting the sugar from the fruit mixture and adding a bit of salt to the crumble. It doesn't taste bad, but there is too much crumble and it is a bit dry. I think that decreasing the oats and flour by a bit, and increasing the fruit (using a bigger pan), would address that.

For what it's worth, I didn't bother peeling the fruit. It didn't make it any less delicious (and increased the fiber content!) I did take the suggestions of reducing the sugar to about 3/4 cup total, 1/2 cup in topping and 1/4 cup in fruit. I also doubled the cinnamon!

I think it should've cooked a bit longer or hotter. I think the apple mix was missing a splash of lemon juice and some cornstarch. The juices were watery and didn't stick to the apples. And the topping was not good at all. The oats didn't get moist enough and it ended up dry.

I used gluten free baking flour, a 1/4 c brown sugar in the crumble and 1/4 cup brown sugar in the fruit and it turned out great!!! And totally gluten free!

I added some dried cranberries in with the apples and pears, but otherwise followed as written. Mixed reviews from the family. I personally didn't like the "crisp" part at all. Heated and served with ice cream and it was a little better. Will not make again.

this recipe is so much easier than others I have tried: chop the fruit (my pears ended up being bad, so i used frozen blueberries), thow in the pan, mix the dry ingredients and put on top! easy peasy! and delicious!
