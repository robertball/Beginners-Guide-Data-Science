Just a heads up... On step 5 I think "waxed paper" should be "parchment paper" (waxed paper in the oven is a no-go). Thanks for the recipe

Easy to make.  Left out the cinnamon and added a bit more honey, some cashews and slivered almonds.

This recipe is great! It's simple, doesn't require a lot of ingredients, and best of all it's quick! My brother loves this and he's not one to throw out compliments. I'm going to double or triple this recipe next next time since the original recipe was obviously not designed for a hungry family of 5.

Super easy to make. Easy to alter. I added raisins after it was baked. Delicious.

Loved this granola, I added a couple teaspoons hulled hemp seeds and flax seeds before toasting oats and coconut, and a 1/2 cup dried reduced sugar craisens before baking.  Its great eaten out of hand or as a cereal with milk. Gluten free goodness.

Not bad. I wanted a gluten-free recipe, and this was easy and quick. It worked well in my brunch to use in parfaits with yogurt, fruit, nuts, and seeds, but if I wanted cereal to just eat with milk, I'd go for a more interesting recipe.

Delicious! And so easy to make. I made it with all the optional ingredients, plus a decent amount of chopped almonds & a bit of extra honey & coconut oil. LOVE the combo of flavors!

Made the recipe as stated. Pretty simple to make. I like my granola a bit sweeter, so I would add a touch more honey.

Excellent recipe without refined sugar!!!! I added almonds and less cinnamon. I like it sweeter so I use the extra honey...and sometimes a little more than that.

Delicious! I made 3 batches and it made my house smell yummy. Kids gobbled some up right away too! I did forget to pre-toast the oats and coconut so just baked for 8 minutes and then stirred and baked another 8 minutes. Perfect!
