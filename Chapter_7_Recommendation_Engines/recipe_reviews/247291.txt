There is no doubt -- it IS delicious!  The dough is very thick and must be spooned on top of the fruit mixture but -- my dough did not spread as it baked and so it was more like a cobbler than a cake -- it would have come completely apart if I had tried to flip it over -- so I just served it directly out of the pan as a cobbler.  Everyone loved it with vanilla ice cream over top.  I will make it again calling it what I think it more resembles!

Pretty good over all. A little bit dry though.

The  cake  batter is missing a liquid.  Maybe milk?  My cake batter came out like cookie dough.  I plopped it on the nectarine brown sugar butter  layer and baked it.    This  cakes fell on it's face.    I was disappointed.  It's  not sweet.

I only changed the pan and added extra fruit!  Bundt pan was beautiful! Will taste great with vanilla ice cream!

I made this without tweaking it and it was wonderful!!! My Great-Nephew's loved it and they are both very picky!
