Tasted great! Everybody went back for seconds. It took a bit longer to set for me (maybe 35 min).

The egg dish was very thin and flat.  Not enough filling to fill up a 9X13 pan.  I would make it again but increase the volume. The overall flavor was very good.

Delicious.  I used a few more potatoes, regular diced tomatoes and  a tiny sprinkle of parm on top. Kale can sometimes be strong and bitter, but it wasn't in this.. not at all.  Will make this again
