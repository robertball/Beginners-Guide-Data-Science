WOW!! So good! I made them with almost 2lbs of hamburger meat, it made 13 egg rolls. I used 1/4 cup in each as suggested. I added a little extra cheddar, and a few slices of american to give it more of a cheeseburger taste. It also made it a little creamier. The cooking time was too long, I burnt my first batch. Then I followed the directions on the wrap package, the rest came out fine. Oh, and I left out the pickles because hubby doesn't like them. We dipped in fry sauce. (ketchup and mayo) Next time we will be trying mushroom swiss burger egg rolls. :)

This was a hit at my house, something rare with a 3 and 5 year old.  I did change the filling a bit.  I made half of it the way it was written and for the other half I used the meat, cooked and crumbled bacon, onion, bbq sauce and cheddar cheese.  One pound of meat definitely is not enough to use all of the egg roll wrappers, but it easily fed my family.  Like someone else suggested, I thought it wasn't enough oil, but I just let them cook on one side and then flipped them.  It was less than 4-5 minutes on each side, but just watch them and you'll be fine.  I'm definitely making these again.

This recipes was actully super yummy.  Right after they come out of the deep fryer place on a metal wire rack with papertowels under to make sure all the greece gets drained!  I also made the dipping sauce added a tsp of mustard and a drop of worcestershire - perfect! I will make again !

Delicious!  I used mayo instead of mustard since I have some that don't like mustard, and dill pickles.  Kind of reminded us of Krystal burgers, only better!!  I also made a mexican version with refried beans, a bit of salsa and shredded cheddar mixed with the beef, and a slice of pepper jack chs...dipped in sour crm and salsa...YUM!

These were great! I had leftover egg roll wrappers to use up and this was the perfect way without having to make regualr egg rolls again. The only thing I changed is instead of mustard we used ketchup. My hubby doesn't like mustard. I think next time we might try to put bacon in them too.

I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. The pickle/relish and mustard was omitted. Very good. Couldn't cook them fast enough.

I have to first say that I used this more for the idea of making cheeseburger eggrolls, as I did not use the same filling. I basically used the filling from 'Slider-Style Mini Burgers' from this site and added in the chopped dill pickles. We thought these were great and was a fun twist on a regular cheeseburger. Served them w/ ranch and 'Roasted Onion Mayonnaise' from this site for dipping. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe was edible but not impressive. Granted I baked instead of fried but the mixture itself was overall bland. My husband who made it with me said, "That was a lot of work for a plain cheeseburger." I have to agree. He told me to toss this recipe and I plan on it.

My kids liked it, but I thought it was a bit bland.  I like the BBQ sauce idea and may have to try that next time.  Use the Egg Roll Wrappers recipe also on this site!

Used won ton wrappers to make these as apps. Would only change the cheese from cheddar to american for a creamier texture. Can't wait to serve them with some ketchup & mayo!

Great recipe as is and with lots of potential.  Even my picky son took a couple of bites...he's not big on pickles so he didn't eat much but thought they were okay.  Next time we're going to try it with mushroom & swiss instead of the pickles & cheddar.  Thanks!

Made these for my husband tonight, he really liked them.  I tried a bite and they did taste good.  Next time I make them I will try and lower the calories and fat.  I took the suggestion of adding bacon and some Bar-b-q sauce to the mix.  I also mixed a bit of breadcrumbs and mayo in too.  I didn't have any problem with the wrappers busting, fried very fast. Pretty heavy meal, not for everyday, but fun for a change every now and then.

I am giving this 4 stars because I didnt' follow the recipe exactly. I baked these on a parchment paper lined baking sheet versus frying them. The kids liked them. I thought they were ok. I didn't think they had a whole lot of flavor. Would probably add salt and pepper like another reviewer suggested if I made these again. Maybe even some garlic.

These were fun to make and eat.  I totally forgot the onion because I was watching TV at the same time.  I would suggest some seasoning though, after I made the first two, I went back and seasoned the meat with a bit of salt, pepper, and italian seasoning.  Delicious!  Will make again.

Delicious, and pretty easy to make, I was very happy these turned out so well. First time using egg roll wrappers,  but everything was explained step by step, and we enjoyed the flavors together. We used chipotle ranch as a dip.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe to the letter.  My daughter and I loved them (but wanted more cheese) but my husband did not, he's not a fan of pickles and thought the pickles were overwhelming. So...the next time I omitted the pickles and used chunks of velveeta instead and they were AMAZING!! Making them again tonight (with revisions of course) as a matter of fact!

While I did make a few changes, we really enjoyed these.  I doubled the cheddar and added worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper.  The onion did give it a Krystal burger flavor, though it turned off my picky 9 year old so I would probably make some filling without onion next time.  I think other reviewer's bacon idea would be a nice addition too.

Tried this recipe. Loved it. Grandkids ask for it everytime they come over, about every two weeks. Did not change recipe, but did change a little in cooking style. I prepared 5 eggrolls at a time. Started those cooking then rolled up 5 more while they cooked. Saves a little bit of time and gets the grandkids to the eggrolls a little faster.

I like food with flavor so i changed this some but it came out amazing. i didn't add the pickles and I added worcestershire sauce, montreal steak seasoning, garlic powder and adobo to the meat and instead of cheddar cheese i used american and added shredded lettuce.

I made these yummy morsels for a party and people were standing in line for them!  Adults and kids love them.  Tastes like a McDonald's cheeseburger in a wrapper.  The dipping sauce is fantastic!
