I have made this many times, except that I use plantains instead of bananas.  Also, I add cumin, oregano and bay leaf (in Venezuela we get it in piowder form).

Born & bred in Miami, I was skeptical about this dish, even as I served it up.  HOWEVER, with just slight tweaking, my family and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Tweaks:  added cumin (a must for authentic cuban flavor), used 3 (10oz) cans of Rotel diced tomatoes.  Also, my bananas were slightly green.  Yum-a-licious, seriously!  The tweaks kept me from giving this a 5* review...

I'm always looking for new ways to cook pork and this was easy and delicious.  Nothing needed to be changed - I made minor ones - used Goya seasoning to season the meat before cooking and again at the end in place of the salt and pepper.  I also had some leftover canned corn which I added.  I cut the meat into bite sized pieces, therefore, 20 min. of cooking time was plenty - it would have been dried out if I had done 30 min.  I served it over rice but the next time I'n going to serve it by itself (it is filling) and put out some crusty bread with butter. Thanks submitter.

This recipe was fantastic. I must be honest, I only made it because to me it sounded too weird not to try. :) It was very easy to make. The blend of ingredients gave this a sweet yet spicy wonderful taste. We will be making this one again and again!! Thank you so much!!

I was browsing for recipes when I came across this, and found it unique, so I tried it out. I was really surprised by how well everything came together, it was super easy to prepare and easy to make. I was definately impressed by the taste, all those unique flavors in one, definately not for the plain and boring, that's for sure. I served over egg noodles, and will definately be making this recipe again.

This recipe could be spiced up 'criollo'-style with hot chili peppers to taste if desired or leave it mild and smooth without the hotness. I used plantains because I like them better with meat.  I also liked the goulash better served with rice.  Thanks for the recipe - as all the reviewers indicate it can tweeked or left alone and you still have a good dinner.

Do not let the ingredients put you off on making this extraordinary dish.  This was fantastic, the sauce was delicious, the bananas gave it a nice touch.  I did add a 28oz can of tomatoes as one reviewer said it could have been saucier and I am glad I did.  We served it over egg noodles and it was a perfect meal.  Thanks for posting this one.

I HAD to try this simply because of the strange combination of the strange combination of ingredients.  It wasn't "bad", but I definately thought it could have been a little bit "saucier", maybe more tomato? Interesting, but not sure if we'll try it again.

I was alittle scared when I saw bananas and tomatoes in the same dish, but what a GREAT combination of ingredients. On my first attempt I used plantains as others suggested,as well as rotel tomatoes, cumin and chili powder. I served it over Brazilian Rice (from this website).The dish was delicious, but found the plaintains to be bland. I used bananas the second time I made it and the flavor was very nice.  I also cooked the pork first, removed it before cooking the rest of the ingredients and put it back in to cook a little more before serving.  I found the pork to be too dry when you leave it in the whole time (first attempt).  All in all great recipe!  Next time I make it I might try pineapple in place of banana....a little sweet with a little heat!

Okay dish.  Wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping.  Adding the bananas gave it an interesting taste but it was still pretty bland.  I added about half a can of water and then reduced it with heat to make his saucier and served over rice.

It was okay but I probably won't make it again.

My wife simply loved it! I think the combination of flavors is perfect! I only added some chilli peppers (2) to make it a little spicer.

I was looking for something "different" and decided to try this. I had all the ingredients but after reading ALL the reviews, I decided to embellish.  I am amazed that some would add water and then claim no flavor! Really? Duh!! Added to the recipe as posted...Cumin, Sazon and Italian seasonings and went ahead and salt and peppered. Added 2 cups Italian diced tomatoes and 1 can mild Rotel and a couple of splashes of V-8 juice. Diced up a sweet potato I had as well for added sweetness. 
I threw in some Elbow Macaroni and a handful of Quinoa and cooked it right in the same huge covered skillet which soaked up the juice nicely. No need to cook noodles separate and dirty up more pots! The pasta and quinoa is so much more flavorful cooked right in with the recipe! 
This was FANTASTIC on our 1st 2013 COLD Florida day (32 degrees) :)

This was just delicious!  Used 2 bananas, +1# country ribs, and 4 cups diced tomatoes because that was what I had!  I also didn't have onion that day, so I used onion powder and added cumin.  My whole family loved it.

I followed this recipe, except i added three mild chili peppers, an extra can of tomatoes,and some cumin.  The flavors together are a good combination, but my husband and I both found it way too sweet with so much banana.  I will make this again, with a little extra tweaking. I will maybe use only half of one banana instead of a pound.  It also needs a little spice so I will still use some chili peppers, or maybe a tiny bit of chili sauce or paste.  Its a good starter recipe though and seems to be pretty versatile.

My guy and my friend were going on about Cuba having the best pork.  I've never been, so did a search for "Cuban pork" and decided to try this out.  The combination intrigued me and sounded pretty off the wall! I used pork chops rather than a roast, and added cumin as someone here suggested.
We all liked it-a lot!  My friend is a Chef and it even passed her taste test.  Thank you for posting this!

Curiosity got the best of me and I had to try this recipe.  I cooked it with the lid on and had no problems with lack of sauce.  There was something about the taste that just didn't grab me, although it wasn't bad, either.  I served it over egg noodles, but think I might have liked it better over rice.

Although this is the first time I made this recipe, I used the reviewers' suggestions and used 3 cans of Rotel tomatoes with chilis, added cumin, and cut the pork into tiny pieces.  I thought it was good, and my husband really liked it, but we both still thought it was missing something.  I liked it paired with egg noodles, and I might make it again.  But first, I'd like to figure out what it's missing.

My husband and I felt it was to sweet with the bananas.  So next time I think I will use less or leave them out.  I served it with the egg noodles and it was pretty good, other then the sweetness.

I made this recipe for 45-people and did not receive one complaint. When you read that you put in diced bananas you think that it would be disgusting. but the bananas pretty much dissolve and make and thicken the sauce giving a great consistency and flavor. As far as the cayenne pepper I let every one season theirs to taste.

I made this recipe as written but added some cumin as suggested by some of the other reviewers.  It was tasty but somehow unmemorable.  Some more exact guidance with the various spices might be helpful.  "To taste" is not much help when one has never tried a recipe before.  I would appreciate it if the person who originally posted this recipe would specify how much cayenne, how much pepper, etc.  The bananas might not have been enough.  Are the bananas in the recipe for flavor, for texture, or both?  I'm not familiar with plantains, so would they have been better to use?  I think this recipe could be better, I just don't know how to improve it.

We had something similar while on vacation in the Dominican Republic.  I substituted plantains for the bananas and it was simply wonderful!

I was intrigued by this recipe, but it was pretty gross.

Not sure why this showed up under Canadian recipes.  It was good.  Not used to having a sweeter goulash.  Worth a try though.

This was very interesting. I just didn't love the flavors enough to ever make it again.

Fantastic recipe! I was so curious I had to make it! I served it with rice, and added an extra can of tomatoes as suggested by another  reviewer. The flavor was great -- I love when the recipe says "season to taste"!
This one is a keeper!!

Delicious!! As some people mentioned the lack of flavour, I added chipotle. I also added diced zucchini as I had it on hand. It turned out great. It went very well with rice. I served it with bean salsa&chips and ice mint tea. It was a perfect hot summer lunch. I may try with pineapple the nxt time.

This was excellent.  The bananas work very well with diced tomatoes.  I used the tomatoes w/chilis for added spice.  It is a keeper and would work with chicken also.

Not one of my favorites. I followed the recipe exactly but felt the finished dish lacked flavor. Probably won't make again.

I made it - but with lots of changes so does that mean I really made it? 
Anyway, I got lots of compliments the first meal and lots of middleschoolers coming into my classroom asking what smelled so good when I took leftovers to school for lunch.
It was thick, spicy and AMAZING with these changes I made by combining this recipe with Chef John's Goulash recipe plus some of the previous reviewers suggestions:

1t cumin 
28 oz chopped tomato 
14oz chicken stock
2 stalks celery
1/4 of a chopped kabocha 
seasonings from Chef John's Goulash:
2T Paprika
2t crushed caraway seeds
1t marjoram
1/2 t thyme (fresh 4 sprigs)
1 bay leaf
1/2 t cayenne

Had fun with this recipe at the soup kitchen.  No one could guess that there were bananas in this.  Very easy and quick to make.

It was fun to make but the taste was just a little off. It seemed a lot like mint to me, oddly. Other people liked it, though.
