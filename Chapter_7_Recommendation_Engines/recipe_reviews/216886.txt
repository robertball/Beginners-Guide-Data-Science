I have always loved ordering this dish from Silver Spoons, and find this recipe very similar.  It is labor intensive bu so tasty, and looks beautiful--a good company meal!

Very good! Lot's of little steps but this will be my go to dinner party dish. We have a shellfish allergy so I omitted the shrimp and increased the sausage. Used can chicken since I had it on hand. Also decreased the seasoning by half and it was still flavorful with a big kick.

One of the two or three best things I've ever made.  Bechemel, Jambalaya, and Puff Pastry... not a combination I would have ever thought of, but whoever did is a flippin' genius!

I don't understand the people saying its lots of work, just brown all the meat (except the shrimp) in a skillet simultaneously, make the Bechemel in the sauce pot at the same time, combine the rice in the skillet to soak up the juices / brown bits and assemble the casserole.

It could be easier, but then you would have to tip your waitress!

This recipe is amazing and while it does seem to be a bit of work...it is amazing...I have been making this at least once a month for over a year now....I make two at the same time (it costs about the same) and freeze one for later or if company stops by....Once you have made it a few times it is a snap and takes very little time at all....especially if you plan to have leftovers through out the week as ingredients...I have also used prepackaged pie crust instead of the puff pastry so I don't have to wait for thawing...overall this is just an excellent recipe...

I saw a seafood mix of shrimp, crab and calamari when I went to buy shrimp and decided to try that instead of just shrimp.  Adding the crab was a good choice but not so much for the calamari.  Other than that, I went by the recipe exactly and everyone thought it was pretty good.

Yummy!  I think I added too much Cajun spice.  My nose is running!  I made my own Cajun spice from Allrecipes.  Some  people recommended cutting back on the salt in the spice recipe, which I did, but if you cut back too much, the sweet flavor is missing.  I ended up adding salt to my own plate.  Yes, I would make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so fun to make...a challenge but fun! It puffed up nicely and is a beautiful toasty brown color. It taste's awesome, however I agree with others, if your cajun seasoning has salt...use less. I used 2 tablespoons and it was still too much! Next time I will reduce to 1 tablespoon. Overall this is a wonderful and impressive dish!

Takes some work to make but worth it. First time I've tried something like this. I don't experiment with seafood much. It's delicious and packed with flavor. The shrimp gives it just the right consistency. I see that someone used a mix of shrimp, crab, and calamari. I think I might have to add the crab along with the shrimp next time and see how it works out.

Delicious!  I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand (increased chicken and sausage because I had no shrimp).  If you use the kind of Creole seasoning with salt, be careful not to use the full 3 Tbs; it will be too salty.  I may try steaming the sausage with the rice next time to save a pan.  I baked the dish for 25 minutes, which left the bottom crust doughy.  I think I will try baking the bottom for a bit before adding the filling next time.  I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing!
