A bit too sweet for my taste. I think next time I’ll cut back on the honey. It has a very clear honey taste into it. Probably use half or even a fourth of what was called for. Also only 4 minutes at 325 then 350 wasn’t enough time for frying chicken. Had to crank it up to 375 for about 6-8 minutes total.
