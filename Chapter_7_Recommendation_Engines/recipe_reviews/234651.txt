Breaded these mid-afternoon, put in the fridge, and took out about a half hour before I was ready to start dinner.  This made Sunday dinner very easy.  I just felt like there was something missing from the sauce, but not sure what.  I used chicken tenders, and had no whole wheat bread, so I just put some of my homestyle bread in my mini chopper to make the bread crumbs.  Next time, I'll probably put the chicken under the broiler at the very end, just briefly, as I would have liked a little crisper breading.  However, it was plenty moist, we liked it, and I will make this one again.
