I'm sorry, I didn't like this as much as I thought I would. I love raita, so this recipe sounded like a nice twist on that. I ate it the first night with some roti and it made for a nice light summer meal. The flavor was very strong and sour because of all the yogurt. I made the recipe exactly as written. In my opinion, there is an excessive amount of yogurt in this recipe.  I'd recommend adding more cucumber because I couldn't taste them at all, and using less yogurt. I also recommend eating it as a dip or a topping for kebabs, lamb, chicken or wraps, instead of on its own. Eaten on it's own it's a 1 star recipe - in small quantities as a topping or dip, it's 3 stars. A very healthy recipe though! Thank you for sharing!
