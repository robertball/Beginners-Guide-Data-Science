This was wonderful!!  I did make 2 substitutions, I replaced the egg plant with quartered button mushrooms and the broad bean with green pepper strips.  I will definately make this again for a change of pace.

This is a great dish full of flavor. Wonderfully colorful too. I served this with Chicken Breast cubed up. On the side I had Berber Bread and Black Olives. Also served with my Moroccan Mint Tea. Reminds me of my Morocco.

If the vegetables were to be grilled on a regular grill instead of the stove then the recipe would be very good, however I thought the stove top didnâ€™t do it justice.

I was disappointed in this dish.  The sauce was overwhelming and none of the vegtables retained an individual flavor or texture.

Very delicious!  I prepared this meal for my vegetarian friend, but I liked the dish as much as her.  Great sauce, wonderful taste combinations.  Pretty easy to make.

since i read the other reviews first, i cooked the vegetables shorter which helped keep the flavors, yet there were still "grill lines" - also I used just a few table spoons of flavorful tomato sauce instead of a can of plain tomatoes - that with the balsamic made a nice sauce. this definitely goes well with couscous, which i cooked in water (healthier) and still tasted great.

This tasted like vegetables with balsamic vinegar on them, which is fine if that's what you want.  I probably won't make it again though.  I also realized I don't like couscous very much, which certainly sways my opinion.

This was pretty good. I would probably add some garlic or something more to flavour it but it was a change from my normal cooking to taste the vegetables so clearly without curry or spice or sauce on it. I liked the tomatoey flavour. I will probably make this again because it is so easy.

The balsamic was a little overwhelming might try red wine vinegar if i ever make this again.  It needs something otherwise the couscous is too dry.

This recipe was light and healthy. It was definitely lacking garlic, which I added to the olive oil before the rest of the vegetables. While some complained that the balsamic was over-powering, I thought it could use even more than the recipe called for. I will try this again but with more garlic, onion, and experiment with other spices.

Loved the basic idea of this recipe but made a few changes.  First I tossed the cut veggies in olive oil and kosher salt then grilled them over direct heat on a gas grill.  While they grilled I simmered the diced tomatoes with a clove of chopped garlic, about a 1/4 of a tsp. of dried basil, 1/4 of a tsp of paprika, and about a 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  I didn't have any beans around so I skipped those.  I also used whole wheat couscous.   The result was fantastic!  A great quick and healthy recipe I'm sure I'll make again.

Very good! Made a few changes: added some garlic and dried basil to the veggies for some extra kick. Broiled veggies inside as it was cold out today. Then served on rice noodles...I'm gluten free, so that is always my substitute which was great. Also, topped with a light sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. My hubby's comment, "great recipe....would be better with chicken!" -of course! Will surely make again!

I'm extremely liberal when it comes to following instructions, so usually recipes are more like 'inspiration' or 'starting points' for me.  This was a great inspiration.  I took veggies from my garden--long/slender eggplants, basque grilling peppers, summer squash, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes--and simply grilled them in a fry pan w/olive oil, sea salt and pepper.  When tender, I added a tbsp or two of balsamic at the end and then poured atop the couscous.  I reserved some veggies just to eat plain and they were delicious!!!  I can see making half/half couscous and quinoa in the future to make it more healthy.  Easy recipe to improvise/change to your liking.  Great recipe for people like me that can't seem to follow strict instructions!!!  Healthy, tasty, and beautiful on a large serving platter!

Easy and healthy Recipe! It could definitely use some kick, so next time I'll add garlic and some fresh herbs like basil.

The vegetables are great, but the directions for cooking the couscous don't work.  Better to follow the directions that come with the couscous.

Good flavor, I think the individual veggies retained their flavors and the sauce still brought a nice addition to the mix. I personally don't care for couscous so I mixed it with the veggies to absorb the leftover liquids. I also only cooked the veggies in a frying pan for about 6-8 minutes (I think that might have been a little too much).

Bland. I suggest adding a lot of garlic or chopped olives, or something for flavor.  Four stars because it's vegetarian and healthy!

This was pretty good with a few changes.  First, I had to use chick peas instead of broad beans, and that actually worked out very well.  That was strictly because I could not find broad/fava beans this time of year - I've never seen frozen ones and don't like canned, but love fresh.  I also cooked the couscous according to package directions - bringing 1 cup vegetable stock, 1 tbsp olive oil (or butter) to a boil, stir in couscous, remove from heat, cover and let sit five minutes.  Otherwise, this dish just needed about 3 cloves of garlic and some fresh oregano and basil for more flavor.  It was kind of a pain, cooking all the vegetables - I only had a small grill pan, but that actually worked out well since the eggplant, zucchini and peppers/onions all needed various cooking times - I did them in batches, so it worked for me.  My only other issue was I didn't seem to have enough sauce - I'll double the tomatoes if I make this again, and leave the vinegar as is.  When I served it, the couscous was really dry underneath the vegetables - it would have been better if there was enough liquid to trickle down and flavor the couscous.   Finally, I didn't, but someone mentioned adding goat cheese to this - THAT, along with more seasonings and increasing the sauce, would make this a total 5-star recipe in my book!  Next time....

Admittedly I adore couscous and Balsamic vinegar, so I would probably like this recipe not matter what. But it has become a staple for us in the summer. 

I use a grill pan so I can just toss in whatever veggies I have around. We've used the vegetables in the recipe as well as mushrooms (white and portabello), yellow squash, left over edamame, etc. 

I just throw them into the grill pan starting with the ones I want to cook the most. I prefer onions quite wilted but other veggies I like crisp. 

Tossing with the tomatoes and vinegar makes "grilled vegetables AGAIN?" into something special. 

I also serve it over rice.

Great, flexible recipe.

Good recipe.  I followed pretty closely with the exception of the eggplant (not a fan) and broad beans (which I didn't know where to find in the store).  The couscous was delicious.  I did feel like the dish needed something else so I added fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  This was a healthy recipe!  I plan to make it again maybe with risotto instead the next time.

Definitely one of my favorites.
I don't usually grill vegetables but this time I thought about trying something new and it was worth it.
I was tired of eating the "normal" couscous recipe and this one met all of my expectations. It actually tastes better than it sounds.
Thanks!

This recipe was only ok.  I agree with the review that the veggies were overdone so the texture was mushy and the sauce was nothing special.  Next time I'll try adding garlic and other spices for at least some kind of kick, as well as barely cooking the veggies so they retain their natural crispness.

after reading the reviews, i added in more veggies so the sauce wouldn't be too overpowering.  i would guess that i doubled the veggies.  also, i simmered the sauce separately, then only incorporated the veggies to keep the flavors more independent.  i served the sauce and veggies over pasta, and then topped with a bit of crumbled goat cheese (which is usually paired with balsamic vinegar and tomato sauce).  also, roasting the veggies in the oven works just as well.  

all in all, great recipe, will make many times!

I thought it was amazing... like bruchetta over couscous.  But then again I have a thing for balsamic vinager that could explain it.

I found out through this recipe that my husband does not like couscous - reminds him too much of Malt-O-Meal. CousCous aside, we both really enjoyed this dish. Next time I would use less than the called for amount of tomatoes.

This is a 5 star recipe if done with a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano. That makes a huge difference in my opinion. Based on other reviewers, I did the tomatoes and balsamic vinegar in a sauce pan and let simmer on low until the vegetables were done!  I cut up the veggies for the outside grill. Of course I had to use what I had on hand which was everything from the recipe except beans and eggplant.   I substituted mushrooms and asparagus. Honestly you can use whatever you have on had.....but you definitely need the onion and peppers!  They become so sweet when grilled on a medium setting.   I also lightly garlic salted and peppered the veggies once while grilling them.   Grilling veggies can always present a problem if you don't have some sort of way to keep them from going through the grill.  I have a grill basket and a flat cast iron griddle that has the grill marks on one side. It took about at least 20 minutes to grill the veggies, but well worth the time!   (The asparagus goes last because it cooks so fast)  I served over brown rice but it is great with couscous as well!  Assemble in the kitchen.... a ladle of rice or couscous, lots of veggies, a ladle or two of sauce, then I used the asparagus as a decoration.  PS.  I also served a grilled vegan Italian sausage brat with it and garlic bread!  Yum Yum

Such a savory flavor!  We used all fresh veggies instead of canned. My husband and I put the cut veggies with the oils in foil packs on our grill, also marinated chicken in balsamic with brown sugar and garlic and grilled that as well.  Instead of the couscous we served it over cheese tortellini and it was a big hit!

I really liked this dish.  I used a large eggplant & zucchini and had a lot of vegetables but it still worked fine.  I think this would also work great over pasta, for those who don't care for couscous.
