We've made this twice now and it does come out very dense.  I was thinking my baking powder was too old til I read the first comment about this dish. It is tasty so we'll try it again. We'll  I'll try to remember to post about the result.

I didn't make the cake but used the icing recipe for peanut butter blondes. The icing is great.

This is good.  It is dense, as previous reviewers said, and probably more like a "sheet cake" than an Angel Food cake, but it's easy, delicious, and doesn't require any exotic ingredients or much preparation, so it's a keeper.

The peanut butter flavor certainly overwhelms the apple in this very dense chewy "cake" than more closely resembles a slightly dry bar.  While generally tasty this treat take some work to get down or maybe just begs for a glass of milk.
