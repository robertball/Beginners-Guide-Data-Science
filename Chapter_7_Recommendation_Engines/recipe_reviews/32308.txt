This punch is sooooo good and easy to make. I used it at my wedding reception three weeks ago. I have been to a lot of weddings that had nasty punch and I wanted something really good and easy. Well, I got so many compliments and people told me this is the best punch they ever had. We are using it this week at my cousin's first birthday party!

I made this for a homeschool Christmas program.  I tripled the recipe and was glad I did.  I couldn't keep the bowl filled up and I got many compliments.  One little boy tugged on my dress and said that it was the best punch he'd  ever tasted in his whole life!

This was great punch. My family had a Retirement party for my mom and I was in charge of the punch and this one was the best of them all. I wanted a recipe that didnt ask for sugar to be added. This punch had just 3 simple ingredients and simple to make. Thanks

I used ginger ale (walmart brand even!) and it turned out great.  What a cheap punch.  For reference, there were 30 ladies at the shower and I filled the bowl twice and that was perfect.  I also pre-scooped the sherbet 
(I used raspberry) so it was ready to put in the punch at the shower.  Yum!

Excellent and so easy. Will be my all time favorite when I need a punch recipe. Did sub rainbow sherbert for strawberry and ginger ale for lemon-lime. Worked great. Perfect taste combo.

I made this for a party at work. Everyone loved it. to keep this punch colder, I had a small silicone bundt pan that I filled with  hawaiin punch about 3/4 of the way, then froze it. I then added thinly sliced oranges and sliced strawberries and put a little bit of water , just to cover and froze that. I added this to the punch before adding the 7-up. It kept the punch cold for about 4 hours.

this recipe was a hit at my 3 year-old's birthday party. All my relatives asked how I made it, and they drank it all! I made it according to the recipe, but used raspberry sherbet and Minute Maid Brand fruit punch from the refrigerated section.

I made this punch for a child's birthday party, everyone loved it. So I made it for my Bunko group - they loved it too. I received so many compliments on this, and it was so quick and easy. I used rainbow sherbet and it looked bright and fresh.

I made this for the children on New Years Eve, and the adults drank as much of it as the kids did!  I used rainbow sherbet and floated some pineapple chunks in it, and it was a HUGE hit!  I will make this again and again!

I made this for a baby shower and everyone raved about how good it was.  Good thing I made a double batch because it was gone in no time.  WARNING: make sure everything including the punch bowl is well chilled and make the punch 10 minutes ahead of when you want to serve it because once you pour the carbonated soda in it turns to foam for a few minutes.  Stir every few minutes so the foam dissipates and you will have a delicious (and drinkable) punch.

My mom taught me how to make this. She made it every Christmas. It is so simple and tasty. She used rainbow sherbert, Hawaiin punch, and Sprite. But, the brands do not really matter. She would put it in a big punch bowl with a ladle. We loved it as kids.

I used Sprite, Hawaiian Punch and Berry Sherbert. Just don't forget to chill the liquids, ours was a tad warm, but no one seemed to mind because the taste was right on. Next time I will chill. You could float some lemon, lime or orange slices and some cherries for decoration.

Used Hawiaan Punch and 7up. Couldn't find strawberrry sorbet so I used raspberry.  I halved the recipe and it filled up my punch bowl.  Went over great at my pink princess party.

I made this punch for a father/ daughter dance at my daughter's school. And it was so good. I pretty much tripled the recipe (3 gallons of fruit punch, 3 2-liters, and a 5 quart container of ice cream/ sherbet (found at Publix if you are in the southeast). I would put in a punch bowl- honestly- the ratios weren't perfect. When it would get low, I would just refill the bowl with punch, then the soda, and then the sherbert to keep it cold. The frothy, cold beverage was perfect for dancing girls and their dads and the color was a nice addition to our red and pink post- Valentine's Day dance. We had 150 ppl and it was enough punch (we also served soda and water) for the night. I filled a few cups at the end with the very last of it. It was literally good to the last drop. Thank you for this simple, perfect recipe. A crowd pleaser to say the least!

I've tried this punch several times now and it's always a big hit and very easy to make! I used Old-Fashioned Ginger Ale, Hawaiian Punch, and rainbow sherbet.  The kids love it.  Some adults used a little Malibu Rum to spike it!

Love this punch!  I've made it several times for parties!  My punch bowl isn't quite big enough for everything, so I usually leave a little bit of the fruit punch (Hawaiian Punch) out.  Also use lime sherbert most of the time too!

I made this for my daughter's Valentine's Day party yesterday and it was a HIT!  Very good, easy, and fun.  We put heart shaped ice cubes in each cup.  The proportions of the three ingredients don't have to be exact.  It would be good even without the fruit punch!

This seems too silly to be good, but it is! This is not gourmet, nor is it fancy, but it is delicious and couldn't be any easier -- that's where the five stars come in. The ratio of effort to results is outstanding!

I used raspberry sherbet (couldn't find strawberry) and Juicy Juice fruit punch. One note: this brand of punch is NOT a beautiful red color. It is more of a brown, which I didn't exactly realize until assembling. Even though the color went a little off target, it was still really popular at the baby shower -- the punch bowl was empty at the end!

This was just okay to me, but my guests, for my daughters preschool graduation party, loved it and went back for seconds.  I used the frozen concentrate fruit punch mix, rainbow sherbert since no one had strawberry, and a 2 liter of sprite. 
I'll use this recipe again in the future.

Just what I expected, but boy is this sweet! Much too sweet for my taste, but it fit the bill for my daughter's 11th birthday party. I froze Hawaiian Punch in a bundt pan and floated that with the sherbert. Just what I was looking for, but be prepared for sweetness with this one!

I love this punch.   I had a party for my 10 year old and made it with raspberry sherbert, ginger ale, fruit punch and crushed pineapple.   Was delicious and everyone loved it.    Was great until my crystal punch bowl exploded (broke a clean break in half) and had the most disasterous clean-up job in the world.  Was like a comedy horror movie.    My dining room and my clothes were ruined.   Great tasting punch, though.    (This is an honest to God true story).

I say this punch is ok. I've definitley had worse. I think next time I'll use less fruit punch and more lemon lime soda. I had hoped this punch would have more fizz.

I was so happy to find this recipe - simply because it was SO easy, and I didnt have to "make" a mix and freeze it. I did tweak it - using raspberry sherbet, a can of pineapple juice and a 2 liter of gingerale instead. It was SO good! I made it for a baby shower and the bowl was empty! Was a hit with both kids and adults.

This punch is absolutely delicious! We enjoyed it so much, that between my boyfriend and I, we killed the entire bowl before the party began. Luckily, I had enough for several batches. This punch is like crack and very addicting in that aspect. I'd make sure to have enough on hand for multiple batches because it won't last long.

This was a big hit with the kids at the b-day party. The sherbert puffs up around the edges so it's tasty as well as visually appealing. I just realized that the recipe calls for two bottles of punch to one of lime. I used 1 to 1 and it was fine. Refrigerate the bottles of carbonated lime and fruit punch before you make the punch. This will help the sherbert melt slowly.

Excellent punch and couldn't be easier!  I made this for an 8th grade end of year party (about 15 - 8th graders and their parents).  It was an absolute hit!  Everyone loved it, kept raving about it, and coming back for more!  I used Hawaiian Punch for the fruit punch, and I also substitued rainbow sherbet b/c I couldn't find just strawberry, and it worked out fine - maybe even better (according to my husband).  The recipe made 2 punch bowls full (my punch bowl), and I ran out - might want to have enough ingredients to make extra.  I'm making it again tomorrow night for my business debut party!

I made this punch for a baby shower, and thought it was very good.  I appreciated how easy it was to make, especially when there were so many things going on!  I used Minute Maid punch, a store brand soda, and raspberry sherbet.  It wasn't too sweet, which was nice since there were so many sweet desserts.

I made this for a bridal shower on Saturday and everyone loved it. I have a standard size punch bowl and it wouldn't hold two containers of juice plus the soda and sherbet, so I just used one and it turned out great.  I'll make this again!

this was very good...I used 2 liters of soda (accidentally) and it still turned out great, probably would have been too sweet if I would have only used 1 liter...will definately make again! All I could find was berry rainbow sherbet by Dreyers.

Used this for my daughter's sweet 16-  Had lots on hand to make multiple batches but only needed one batch for the 60 kids as they mostly drank the soda.  It was yummy though!!  Best when the soda is just added as it is more fizzy.  Have everything chilled ahead of time so the sherbert doesn't melt too quickly.

YUMMY!!  We were having a party and my 3, 9 and 12 year old put the ingredients (which weren't measured) into a picher and stirred it.  It was thrown together and DELICIOUS!!  You cannot mess this recipe up!!  I wasn't able to find strawberry sherbert, so I used raspberry sherbert and low sugar hawaiian punch and it was DELISH and loved by ALL!!  Definitely a keeper for all upcoming birthday and other parties!

This is so easy to make! I made it for my baby shower and everyone loved it! A handful of ladies asked for the recipe!!! I used raspberry sherbet instead of strawberry because that was all i could find, and it tasted great.

We served this at my sister's "blue" themed wedding.  We bought blue fruit punch and pineapple sherbet.  The possibilities are endless.  It was a huge hit.  We ran out!!!!  People will love it so be prepared.  Can easily add orange/lemon/lime slices on top, or cherries, this recipe is so versatile.

Great recipe! I used Berry Sherbert and it tasted wonderful. Got so many compliments on it! I think it could've been a BIT more carbonated...so maybe a litle more lemon lime soda next time?

My mom made this for birthday parties when I was growing up and it was always a hit.  It is also great with rainbow sherbert and if you plan on serving it on a really hot day, try making some ice cubes out of the bottled punch and add to the finished product to keep extra cold.

This was great, especially with my secret ingredient-- vodka! I can't really give a suggested amount; I just added it until I thought it was sufficiently strong for our group. This would obviously vary for others.

I used this punch at my wedding. We couldn't find strawberry sherbert so we used raspberry (which is the flavor I had the 1st time I tried this type of punch) It turned out wonderful. The one in the punch fountain was not frothy because of the circulation of punch but still wonderful. The punch fountain had enough for 50 people (we had 26 at the reception) and it was gone in less than an hour. Everyone wanted the recipe!

This punch recipe is just great.  It is simple and definitely a crowd pleaser.  It is also pretty fool-proof: I just kept adding more fruit punch, soda, and sherbet as the punch got lower in the bowl.  I made it for my cousin's baby shower (she was having a girl, so I wanted a pink punch) and it was one of the most raved about menu items.

We served this to 12 kids at our Halloween party and it didn't go over well at all.  None of the kids went back for seconds.  I made this using 100% real fruit juice punch so maybe that was the problem.  Won't do this one again - sorry!

I used Hawaiian Punch made with Splenda and Fruit Punch sherbet. Also added some frozen strawberries and mini marshmallows to the punch. Next time I'll try it with frozen pineapple chunks. So delicious!!! It was definitely a hit at Christmas Eve dinner. Thanks for this simple and tasty recipe!

This was simple to make. It was nice that it didn't require very many ingredients. It had a very nice light taste. The pink color was perfect for the baby shower I hosted.

Super easy and everybody loved it. I made 300 servings for an event and we couldn't keep the punch bowls full! I will make this again. I used Hawaiian Punch, store brand lemon-lime soda, and rainbow sherbet. It was perfect.

I've made this with every sherbet/juice/soda flavor combo imaginable and it's always perfect.  Use diet soda to lighten it up a bit.

Everyone whom I asked said that this punch was good. If I didn't solicit feedback, I don't think that they would have been banging down my door for the recipe. Just a basic good punch for a party.

This was really good. The best thing is that you don't have to worry about starting it one or two days before you need it. I used raspberry sherbet instead of strawberry and 7-up. It was almost too sweet but really good. Add a little rum for the adults and everyone is a happy with this simple awesome punch.

Used this punch for a pampering party for an expectant mom.  This was very pretty, as shown in picture.  It was well received and it went fast.  I had to substitute raspberry sherbet for strawberry, but it was still good.

Also made this for the baby shower. It was very sweet, but still very good. It tasted a lot like a smoothie. My store didnt have strawberry sherbet but they did have raspberry so I used that. This would be great for a kids party because kids love really sweet drinks! The mommy to be really liked it and had atleast 3 cups of it. So its a keeper!

This recipe is great! I couldn't find the strawberry sherbert so I used raspberry instead...delicious! It was definitely a hit at my baby shower and the pink color of the punch tied in great with the "baby girl" theme of the party!

I should rate this 5 stars as I think I was the only one at my son's 1st birthday today who thought this punch was a little too sweet.  I also used rainbow sherbet.  It had a really nice taste though and it went FAST, the kids at the party LOVED it.  Just a little too sweet for my liking but it could have been the fruit punch I used.  I prefer the Luscious Slush Punch on this site but this is way easier to make and almost as good.  I will make this again and try a reduced sugar fruit punch or a different brand.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have never seen strawberry sherbet so I improvised and used a 100% Ocean Spray Mango Citrus juice, Sierra Mist (no HFCS) lemon-lime soda and orange sherbet.   Delicious and easy.  Just remember to place sherbet in fridge to soften a couple hours ahead of time.

Made this for my sister's afternoon wedding shower, and it was a huge hit! Perfect for all ages, and was a great alternative to the 'usual' fruit frizzy punch.

Very good!  Couldn't find Strawberry Sherbet but Dreyer's/Eddy's makes an Orange/Raspberry/Blackberry blend that worked out great.  It didn't make the punch a funny color by using a lime swirled sherbet.

I made this for my son's first birthday party.  I used rainbow sherbert instead of strawberry, but it turned out delicious!  Super easy to make too!

I made this for Thanksgiving.

 I used Minute Maid fruit punch (next time I will try the lower calorie less sweet version). I was worried about keeping this cold so I followed another readers advice and made a frozen ring of orange slices with some of the juice. I opened the juice carton seal shook them up and put the cartons of Minute Maid in the freezer for about an hour or two and then shook them and moved them to the fridge this made them of a slushy consistency. 

I put my frozen juice orange ring in the center of my punch bowl and scooped the sherbert in. I used a quart of raspberry sherbert and a quart of rainbow.I poured the slushy juice in and then poured in my Sprite. 

My family really loved this and asked me where I got the recipe. I am not a soda drinker so I thought this was a little sweet. I think Hawaiian Punch would have made this WAY too sweet. I will try this next time with ginger ale and I will just use one flavor sherbet as well.

This punch went over so well at Thanksgiving! It was gone FAST. I followed the advice of other reviewers and froze my juice into a large cube to keep the punch cold. I used raspberry sherbet, Minute Maid fruit punch and 7up. The only thing I’d do next time is add more 7up because the fizzy aspect makes it so good. I am modifying this to make “grinch punch” tomorrow for our Christmas get together and I’ll use lime sherbet, green Hawaiian Punch, and 7 up. I bought 2 liters of 7 up this time. :) You really can make this recipe your own!

Easy and Refreshing!  I altered the recipe, used 1 bottle of Hawaiian Punch, 1 bottle of Diet Ginger Ale and about 10 small scoops of Berry Sherbet (Dryers brand) - turned out great.  Make it even better by adding a shot of Berry Ciroc or Champage to your cup.

The best punch ever. I always use a rainbow sherbert. For adult version I add a strawberry wine.

I made this for a boy's baby shower but I needed it to be green so I substituted a few ingredients...
Hawaiian Punch - Green Berry Rush
lime sherbet ice cream 
frozen lime juice 
lemon lime soda
(for every 2L of soda, 1/2 containers of other ingredients)

It doesn't sound appealing but it's delicious!
We went the extra mile and froze fresh kiwi and strawberry in the juice in a bundt pan. It really is the topping on the cake.

If you double the recipe, I would suggest an extra large punch bowl.

This was pretty good.  I used raspberry sherbert because I couldn't find strawberry.  Everyone at the party really liked it.  I halved the recipe becuase I was making 2 different punches.  I'm pretty sure it would be good with any kind of sherbert you like.

I work at a place that happens to have no a/c through most of the building. This recipe made it bearable this summer. We had to constantly stay hydrated. This recipe went a long way in helping. I used Gatorade Fruit Punch, rainbow sherbet, and Sierra Mist to get the flavor we all loved.

This was really liked at my party. I made an adult version and added rum. Put in at least a half bottle and adjust for your personal taste.

I made this for a baby shower and used raspberry and pineapple sherbert.  It was so delicious that I am going to make it again next week for my Dad's surprise 80th birthday party.  I know it will be a hit.
