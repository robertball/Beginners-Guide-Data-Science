Absolutely wonderful way to make salmon.  I used 1 T EVOO & 2 T butter to sauté the floured fish in.  I also put my floured fish in freezer for 15 min to keep the flour on better while sautéing.  Love the caper lemon butter sauce.  Yum!

Excellent!  As the recipe mentions as an option, I substituted chicken for salmon.   I followed the recipe exactly but cooked the chicken longer, turning frequently until cooked through.  Incredibly moist with flavour flowing all the way through the chicken.  Next time salmon!

I love this recipe. Now I understand why the picata is such a specialty.  Based on the number of peices of  white bass fillet I prepared. I used more butter, flour, white wine when more is needed, and last chicken stock. I'm looking forward to preparing more sauce for  my chicken. Thanks, for the recipe.

I added a little more olive oil prior to cooking the garlic and then after the garlic was done I added a little of the leftover flour from dredging the salmon to make a roux.  Then proceeded with the rest of the recipe.  At the end prior to adding the salmon back in I added a touch of heavy cream to the sauce.  It was a great dish!

I made it following the recipe exactly. It was the best salmon we’ve ever eaten! It was for a celebration of our adult daughter’s birthday and it was loved by all diners!

Quick, easy, and very tasty.  Very much like what you would expect in a nice restaurant.  Will be making again.  Remember that with a good fillet knife it's easy to remove any skin remaining on salmon fillets, making the dish even cheaper if skin-on is a more economical way to purchase the salmon, and capers keep well in the fridge.

Absolutely delicious! Made as is but with just 2 filets to allow for extra sauce over capellini. My boyfriend’s favorite dish is chicken piccata and he was very impressed with this recipe. So much that he asked me for the recipe to be sure we always have the ingredients on hand. I highly recommend.
