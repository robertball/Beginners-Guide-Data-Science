This was excellent and turned out perfectly! I had to make one small change. I could not find mango-peach salsa. I found peach salsa and mango-pineapple though so I bought a jar of each one of them and used those so obviously omitted the can of pineapple. I expected this to be way too sweet (might have been if using straight pineapple) but the cayenne gave it such a kick that the faint sweetness was welcome. The chicken was great in tacos but would be great on a salad too. Definitely a keeper!
