This was wonderful.  I do not care for celery so was ommited.  Did not haave shrimp soup so used mushroom soup.  Other than that I followed directions to a T and it was Wonderful.  Will make with shrimp soup the next time. Very Very Good.

This was delicious! My whole family loved it, even my three girls. This will definitely make it into our trusty recipe recall. I didn't have the scallops and didn't care for the celery, so I omitted those; I also exchanged the cream of shrimp soup with cream of mushroom soup. It turned out quite well.

MMMMM it was delicious! I didn't have brocolli, so i omitted that and it turned out fine, I used a can of mushrooms and that worked too. Plus, I subsituted the cream of shrimp with cream of mushroom. The recipe is pretty much a foundation. I added squid, a lot more garlic and I guess you can add your sort of stuff in there too. Its an easy recipe, so thanks for posting!

This was just ok for me.  I like celery, but it really over powered the dish.  If I make this again I would cut the celery back to 1/2 a stalk or 1 stalk max.  I did not have a good selection of scallops at the grocery store so I used crab.  The crab worked out well, I liked it better then the shrimp.  The shrimp became slightly tuff.

My trial of this recipe as a result of receiving fennel in my by-by weekly organic delivery.
I had cod and shrimp on hand and I adjusted the recipe to reflect that and I skipped step #3 altogether.  I didn't strain the broth/sauce either (couldn't bear to discard all those veggies) I must say it is very tasty, rich and with complex flavors.
