so good! i sauteed the anchovy with the oil and butter first (b/c then the anchovy dissolves and your left with that great salty taste and no one complaining about eating little fish!).  then i added water and beans and boiled - so good!!

This recipe sounds really good but I haven't made it yet.  I'm writing to alert others who, like me, must watch their sodium, fat and/or caloric intake, that the nutritional information accompanying this recipe is deceptive.  It breaks this recipe down into 4 servings; however, with only a 9oz package of green beans and nothing else to bulk it up, this dish will serve 2 at the most unless you serve really tiny portions.  For those of us of who must watch our salt, fat and/or caloric intake, an accurate (and realistic) nutritional analysis is very important.

These were really good! I had a bag of 'steamfresh' green beans, so I just cooked them in the microwave as directed on the package, and in a small pan, I sauteed the anchovies w/ the oil, the garlic and I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes. I cooked that until the anchovies melted and then added the lemon juice. I tossed that with the green beans and seasoned them with black pepper. These were really great for something different and I'm glad I gave them a try. I will be making these again! Thanks for pposting. :)

Husband doesn't much like anchovies and, I think, had made up his mind that he wasn't going to like this before he'd even tried it. I, on the other hand, liked it alot. The flavors blended really nicely. I made it with fresh green beans. Thanks!

Fresh (blanched) green beans. 3 inch ribbon of anchovy paste (more next time). Added a couple T's of minced onions. 3 X garlic. As others did I simmered all except beans then added a bit more water with beans.

Surprisingly good.  The anchovy taste isn't overpowering and complements the green beans very well.  I added a little extra lemon at the end of a little extra tartness and it was fantastic!

I followed the recipe exactly and liked it very much.  However I think one must be very careful to blend the anchovies and the lemon, so that neither one is predominant.  I, although I love lemon, found it a little too present.

This was good but loved by everyone. I used a steamfresh bag of green beans and used the oil from my anchovies. I may make again.
