The rub was perfect! Added a little more cayenne and smoked paprika for more heat and it turned out great!! I find that if I just rub in the rub and cook it the crust turns out better than if I let It sit because then it turns into more of a glaze.

I felt bad for this recipe as the review before mine was 3 stars only. It was a great rub, that's for sure. I put the rub on early in the morning. My only issue with this recipe was the rub turned into a glaze and slid off the pork leaving one heck of a burned mess in my baking dish. I had enough rub for 2 pork roasts. Used one today and froze the other with the rub on. We didn't find it spicy at all,as the other reviewer did. This is a really good recipe! Glad we tried it. Thanks for sharing DADCOOKS.

Pork Roast with World's Best Rub Haiku: "Used 3 pound pork loin, only needed half the rub! It IS really spicy." As indicated by another review, yes, it's a fiery rub, but I also found it to be too sweet w/ even the 1/4 c. of brown sugar from my halving all of the seasoning. I can't imagine using all of the rub on a 2-3 lb. cut of pork. My pork loin was done in about the time indicated by the recipe, and we were too impatient to eat (smelled really great while baking!) Daughter would not eat it ("milk milk milk! Too spicy!") and I found that I only liked it once it had sat out for awhile and I was able to slice it really thin and put it on a sandwich. If I were to make this rub again, I would decrease the black and red peppers along w/ the brown sugar, but keep the rest the same.

This recipe is awesome!  I did not have time to marinate it as long as called for. I put the roast in a ziplock bag after rubbing it with seasoning and put it in the refrigerator for 2 hours. I then put it in the crock pot on high for about 4 hours or until it was falling apart and then cooked it on low for another hour or 2.  Very tender and tasty!

I made this rub with a 3lb pork loin without letting it sit for 4 hours and it turned out super.The rub actually turns into a nice crust that holds in the loin juices perfectly. It had the wonderful sweet hot flavors we love in my family,I didn't have dry mustard so I ommitted it but do not omit the cumin because that ads a special taste that the rub would not do well without.I made it for last Thanksgiving and my cousin begged me to make it again.I may use this rub on my spiral ham this year.Thank you for sharing, this is the best pork rub ever!If you find it too spicy you are a wimp :-)

Oh My!!! This was an awesome recipe made for guests with rave reviews - not too spicy, just a nice warm glow on the tip of the tongue.  Will definitely make a batch of this rub to keep on hand for other meats and fish...Yum

I made this for New Years dinner...wanted a change from plain pork loin.  My family Loved IT! Don't change a thing.  The gravy it made was fantastic! I cooked 7.5 pound loin  in an aluminum pan and rested it on celery stalks to keep it off the bottom of the pan, then roasted at 450 degrees for 20 minutes then lowered to 350 degrees till it reached 160 degrees internal temp.  This will be our New Years Day dinner from now on.

I made this for a dinner party last night. The roast turned out incredible!! I made 2 pork tenderloins and followed the directions to the 'T', with red potatoes and carrots, the pork was juicy and so flavorful, and got many compliments! Will definitely make it this way again!

Best pork roast rub ever!  Have used it several times now, and it's been really awesome every time.  I do like to add a large chicken bouillon cube au jus after slow cooking a roast in a crock. Makes the best dip for pulled pork sandwiches ever.  Big hats off to the rub's creator(s)! You done did good!

Made it exactly like the recipe called for...it was delicious.  For those who think it is too salty I'll bet they used something like Mortons Iodiized Salt instead of the Kosher Salt that the recipe calls for...it makes a huge difference.  I put the rub on both sides of the roast and wrapped it in saran wrap, then I put it in the roasting pan and put it in the refrigerator overnight...about 16 hrs later I took it out and baked it in the roasting pan on a rack.  The crust on the roast was perfect.  I'm going to use some of the leftover to make some pork fried rice. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for my family (I have a 1 yr old and a 2 1/2 yr old). I omitted the crushed red pepper and halved the cayenne powder to ensure it wouldn't be too spicy for them. Also, I was ready to cook when I found this recipe and didn't have 4 hrs to let marinate, so I took a fork and poked lots of holes in the roast to get the rub into the meat faster.

I can't describe how delicious and juicy it turned out, with just enough spicy heat that my kids could handle it but still had a little kick. Lots and lots and lots of flavor. I cooked it to 150Â° internal temp. So tender, cut like room temperature butter. This rub recipe is a keeper!

Next time I make this I'll plan ahead so it has time to marinate, but I'll still poke holes with a fork. Other than that and keeping the same spice change as before, I plan to make no other tweaks.

Followed the recipe to the t. Let it sit with the rub for about 4 hours and then put it in the oven. When it got to almost temperature, took it out of the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.   Served with a couscous salad. Tender and tasty. Loved by all.

This rub is excellent! Just the right mix of sweet with a kick. I didn't think it was too hot at all. I followed the instructions exactly as written, though I used it just 1 hour before cooking. I put the rub on a 3.5 lb. center cut pork loin that was about 15 in. long and there was still some left over, so most folks may want to cut this recipe in half. I smoked the loin for a little over two hours (@ 225Â°)  to an internal temp. of 140Â° and the rub produced a very nice semi-glazed 'bark' over the meat.  'World's Best Rub' is quite a claim (and Google friendly, which is how I found it), but darned if it ain't close. Highly recommended!

Very good. I have made this twice; first time followed directions exactly. Second time I followed reviewers suggestions and did not marinate, just rubbed the mixture on the roast. Second way produced a spicer roast. From now on I will marinate. So if you like spicer, rub on, milder, marinate

the only change I made was not using cayenne pepper and thyme (I did not have either in my spice cabinet)  Was not too spicy.  My husband said I could use it again,  Served it with roasted sweet  potatoes and some raw vegetables.  Will use it again.

I followed the advice of previous reviewers about not marinating the pork before hand to get a crust rather then a glaze. I omitted the dry Mustard, Ginger, & Red pepper flakes only because I didn't have any on hand. My pork loin was only 2lbs. The amount of rub was plenty to coat the 2lb pork & sprinkle on top of some potatoes that I put in pan along side it. My oven took 1h10mins to reach 160 degrees internally. I really liked this recipe even with the omissions & the extra time in oven it took.

A little spicy for us. Added 1/4 cup more brown sugar and it was awesome!  I double it and freeze the rest until I want it again. Great on chicken too.

Loved it!! I added a bit more smoked paprika and doubled the recipe (except for the cayenne) because I like to make slits through the roast, fat side up and stuff a bit of the dry rub in. It turns out amazingly well with the added flavor. Instead chilling my roast overnight I make the rub when I need it so it develops a beautiful crust as it bakes. It's my go to pork rub recipe now... It's sweet, smoky and has a little bit of heat and the whole family loves it.

I only had a 1 1/2 lb pork loin and it was my fault that I didn't notice that before putting the rub together, because it was way too much rub for my little roast.  But probably too much for a little bit bigger roast as well.  Aside from that, it was pretty darn peppery.  I mean the only thing I could taste at times was pepper (not even the other spices, just the pepper).  Otherwise it was pretty good, everyone in my family ate it anyway.  If I do make it again, I will cut the pepper in half.

Great recipe! Iâve made it several times and itâs by far the best rubbed pork recipe. The glaze is almost candy-like, with a spicy tang. I use fresh ginger and substitute some of the spices with a premixed Cajun spice...as it has most of the ingredients called for. Highly recommend this recipe. Always a hit with friends at potluck.

I've made this probably a dozen times, as many people mention in other reviews 2 hours is all you need. I literally can't taste any difference of any kind when it's marinaded any longer than 2 hours. I've pre-made these and left them to marinade for 48 hours and never tasted any difference.

I did make some alterations of my own:

1. Instead of mustard powder I like to coat the tenderloin in dijon and then roll it in the spice mixture.

2. There is way too much chili flake in this for my taste, I use half the amount.

3. Also too much pepper, I cut this in half also. It's easy for guests to add their own pepper to their tastes.  

4. If you're careful not to use too much you can actually use this on yukon gold potatoes with butter as a great compliment to the tenderloin

This was very good.  I baked it in a much smaller dish so the juices would surround it.  After I remove it from the oven, I sliced it in slices half way through and poured the juice over it.  It was perfect.

I made this and it's become my favorite rub.  My wife really likes it.  Has a bit of heat but not overwhelming.

We like this so much that I've used in on salmon and have had some remark that it was some of the best salmon that they've had.

I did cut the salt in half

This is pretty good. For the first time ever, I had every single ingredient on the list in my pantry. I cut down on the brown sugar and the three peppers a little. I will cut down on the peppers even more if I make this again as the flavors were great but my menopausal self can't take all of that heat.

A bit spicy, so either cut back on the spices or add more brown sugar. Also, doesnât need to marinate. I rubbed it on and cooked right away and it was very tasty. I recommend adding some foil to the bottom of your roasting pan.

so good!!! I had a 1.5 lb pork loin so I was afraid of the sugar really burning if I seared and then also put it in a super hot oven. But I loved the thought of the sweet and spicy together, so I put a little salt and pepper on it first and seared in olive oil for just a minute, then let it cool off a minute before I put it in a ziploc with the rub and marinated it pre-seared for 2-3 hours. I let it sit out of the fridge for 15-20 minutes before putting it in the hot oven. I just knew it would be a disaster! But after letting it rest 12-15 minutes, I let my husband take the first bite and OMG he was like wow this is so good! Winner winner pork loin dinner!! This goes on my permanent rotation for sure!!

I didnât make any substitutions to this rub! I marinated a 5.5 pound pork loin for 51/2 hours in the refrigerator. I roasted it at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours until thermometer reached 143 degrees. There was enough rub!

it wasn't bad, it just didn't have a flavor that i cared for much.  i was disappointed, after reading all the rave reviews.  it has a bit of a punch, spice-wise, but not overly-hot.  i like each of the spices in the recipe, don't know why it just didn't resonate for me.

We loved this recipe. We used this on 2 pork tenderloins. The rub did turn into a bit of a glaze, and it was great.

EXCELLENT!  The blend of spices was perfect for pork loin. Everyone loved the taste. I went without the cayenne pepper flakes which gave the meat just enough heat for my family. I also added a teaspoon of Mesquite flavoring for hint of smoke.

Complex favors. Nicely spicy ! Decreased brown sugar to 1/4 cup for 2.5 # roast. Had put rub on 8 hours in advance and refrigerated.   After reading other comments,  would put rub on closer to roasting.  The juices would have burned but I noticed the pan was dry and added water during cooking  .
Next time will make sure the roast just fits the pan. We really enjoyed it and would make again.

I have made this rub many times. The only change I make is with the cayenne pepper. My family doesn't like too much heat so I cut that in half. This is the most delicious rub I have found. The pork tenderloin is moist and tender melting in your mouth! Amazing!

I made this rub with the intent of cooking a pork loin on a bbq rotisserie.  I used a 5lb pork loin from Costco.  I padded the pork loin dry, and added the rub, with no brown sugar, to the loin, and vacuum sealed it overnight in the refrigerator.  Cooking time on the bbq rotisserie was roughly 90 minutes.  I pulled it off of the bbq at 158 degrees, and let it rest for 15 minutes on a baking sheet, covered with foil.  In my opinion, this is one of the best pork loins that I have ever made!  Our Memorial Day guests loved it!

Awesome recipe! Here's how I fixed it:
I didn't have brown sugar, so I substituted a couple tablespoons of molasses and about 1/4 cup white sugar. I also marinated everything in a ziplock bag overnight, and then browned the meat in a skillet with some bacon grease. I put the loin in my crock pot and then used a splash of apple cider to deglaze the skillet, then added that to the meat. After being in the crock pot all day, the pork just fell apart and had a wonderful sauce to pour over it. Next time I make it, I will have brown sugar on hand and will use the seasonings as a rub before trying it on the BBQ grill. It seems like a versatile recipe--I will definitely make it again!

I omitted the cayenne pepper, and the red pepper flakes due to a dislike for spicy things among some in my family.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of  sage to the rub mixture. 
         I put 2 cups of beef broth into the roasting pan to help keep the pork moist and added two sliced apples to the pan for extra flavor. I cooked the roast at 250 degrees instead of 350 and slowly roasted it for 3 to 4 hours. I used the drippings from the pan to make a really thick pork and apple flavours gravy using only flour and water and it turned out amazingly moist and flavourful. This turned out to be the best pork roast I've ever made!! :)

Used a little less brown sugar than the recipe called for but really good. I would suggest searing all sides before putting in the oven but totally great.

I followed the directions for the rub exactly and used all of it on a 3 pound pork rib roast.  It sat in the fridge overnight.  I cooked it on the rotisserie until the center was 145 degrees.  It was very juicy and tasty!  Will definitely make this again.

I used the rub but smoked the meat with hickory wood chunks. Tremendously delicious, even with only a 3 hour marinade in the fridge. The dry rub is excellent.

The rub was spicy, tangy, sweet, hot, and made you go back for more. The brown sugar turned it into a candied syrup and was just perfect! If I was to add anything it would possibly be orange marmalade for a little bit more tang or orange zest. Definitely a winner and will be going into the recipe book as a keeper!!!

Family doesn't care much for hot or spicy food like me, but they ate this up.  Has a nice low heat to it, but not overpowering. I made it per the original version and will do so again.

Will definitely make this again.  Applied rub to and wrapped roast (2.5 lb) in foil.  Refrigerated overnight before baking in a 300 degree oven for 3.5 - 4 hrs.

Excellent rub. Everyone loved it, Daddy got Rock Star status in the kitchen (only). Higly recommend making double the recipe and storing the excess for the next roast.....you will want to do a next roast, trust me. 

Thank You!

The perfect balance of sweet and smolder. I put this on the grill over indirect heat for 1 1/2 hours, flipping once. I don't want to go so far as to say it was perfect, but if I have never tried barbeque before in my life, and I tried this, I don't think anything else would come close to this experience. I couldn't take a picture, because by the time I thought about taking one, the roast had disappeared. I'm putting this over ribs next time. Quite memorable.

I made no changes to the instructions other than cooking it right after applying the rub.  I did not let the roast set for any time at all.  The rub made a great crust and the meat was very moist.  I will use this recipe again!

It was really good.  There's kind of an Asian flavor to it with a bit of heat and the ginger. I found that it marinating it for 24hrs kind of made the meat firm.  I cooked it to 150Â° internal temp.  
It was really good tho!  :)

I thought the rub was tasty but didnt penetrate the meat. And I may have overcooked it because it was dry and tough to cut.

I used this on pork tenderloin, which I smoked over apple chips in my gas grill.  Everyone loved it, but the heat was a little much for the kids.  Next time, I'll dial the cayenne back a bit, and use regular paprika instead of smoked paprika.  (If I were doing this in the oven, I'd use smoked).
