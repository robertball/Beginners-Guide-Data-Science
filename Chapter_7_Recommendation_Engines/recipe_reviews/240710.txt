Super easy, super juicy, and oh so tender. I am not a huge fan of pork chops but nobody would have ever guessed that if they would have seen how quickly I inhaled these. I plan on using this on the venison and wild duck in my freezer. Thanks for sharing duboo!

Well, I'm glad it's no longer a secret. So simple, great flavor, and beautiful color to the chops when done. Will try this again on the grill and perhaps some chicken. Do marinate overnight or several hours. I added some fresh garlic. I did not taste much of the hot sauce, but then my drops may not have been big enough.

Virgil's Top Secret Pork Chop Marinade Haiku: "This was super good! And super easy to make, (but my chops were dry." By no fault of the recipe-submitter, my pork chops (that were the crazy thick ones from Costco, and that I'd marinated in this overnight) came out a bit dry - browned them fast over med-hi, then moved to the oven to finish baking, but just barely left them in too long. The marinade itself was delicious and imparted a deep, crusty brown color around the exterior of the chops, but I'm not sure that I like it quite as much as AR's "Pretty Chicken Marinade", which I also use on pork chops. But I'm glad that Virgil shared this b/c we still enjoyed it alot!

OK so I only gave it four stars because I didn't have soy sauce and I will re-review the recipe once I can actually make it as directed. This is a great recipe! For some time now I've been trying to figure out how to use up an impulse purchase of raspberry infused balsamic vinegar. (Yeah... Don't ask). I uses it instead of the soy sauce and the results were truly outstanding. I look forward to trying this with the soy!

I made this marinade for some pork chops that went on the grill.  The taste was just so, SO GOOD!  Full of flavor but does not overpower the taste of the meat.  Instead, it acts as a tenderizer.  The meat is perfectly infused with layers of delicious flavor; beyond juicy and melt-in-your-mouth tender.
I made this as written and the only thing different from the original recipe was that I did not marinate the chops overnight (did not have enough time); they actually marinated about 5 hours.   Next time, I plan to give them more time to bask in this amazing marinade...
That said, they were STILL incredible!
You know how, when a meal is just really, really delicious and everyone is just basically SILENT through the entire meal; because to engage in conversation would be to interrupt "The Savor"? 
That was us when we sat down to these amazing chops!  DEEEELISH!!!! The only sound was that of our silverware clinking! 
Today, I am trying the marinade with some steaks (also headed to the grill) and I will update my review after our meal.
Enjoy with abandon, people!

My go to marinade for pork chops is Stubbs. When I found myself with four lovely pork chops and no Stubbs I tried this marinade. I marinated the chops overnight and then broiled them. Fantastic! This is a lovely marinade recipe and I use it again.

Meat stayed moist & had a good flavor.  Will definitely use this marinate again.

Thank you for this recipe.  Exceptional flavor.  I can actually make pork chops that taste great now.  Made as written and I wouldn't change a thing.

I downsized to two portions and marinaded loin chops for 8 hours. The result was moist and tender but the marinade flavor, the soy sauce mostly, was just too strong for us. I think this one is just a difference in taste.

EASY & FLAVORFUL!  I served with a side of applesauce and sweet potato fries.  My only change was to skip the hot pepper sauce due to health issues.  I cut the recipe in half as I was only making 2 pork chops.  It was so easy to put together and marinate overnight.  I couldn't wait to get cooking them as most of the work was already done.  The house smelled so good while they were baking.  I imagine these would even taste better on the grill.  I'll be trying that when the weather breaks.   Thank you for sharing duboo!  You have a winner here and a winner of a father-in-law!  Thanks to him too!

Iâ€™ve been making this about 3 years and now, and have never reviewed it until now. I usually put the marinade in with the pork chops the night before I plan on cooking them, and let them marinate 24 hours.  This is a truly delicious way to cook pork chops, and I would not cook them any other way!

This was really good.  It's simple to make and the basic recipe could encourage you to experiment with it.  We used it on Costco pork chops, soaked overnight, and cooked on our T-Fal table top grill.

I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder but thought it really added a nice flavor to grilled pork chops.  Very easy!

This is a great marinade! I only had time to marinate for 4 hours, the pork chops turned out juicy and very flavorful! Nice color too. I followed the recipe as written, I was afraid that this was too much Worcestershire sauce but nope! Perfect!

I used this tonight for grilled pork loin chops bone-in. I only had five hours to marinade but the flavor was still delicious. I cut down on the soy sauce a bit as someone suggested. This one is a keeper.

I am always looking for  a new way to serve pork chops and this marinade was fantastic!  I marinated my pork chops all day while I was at work.  The pork chops were moist, juicy, and have amazing flavor!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as is except I used extra light olive oil. I marinated overnight and grilled the next day. Pork chops were juicy and delicious. My husband does not often compliment the food, but he complimented these pork chops.

I followed the recipe pretty exact the only change I made was I used olive oil. I had 4 pork loin chops I marinated for a little over 24 hours. We then grilled them on medium (350') about 8 min per side. Great flavor really liked them a lot! Some say the soy sauce is too much but I liked the extra tang in there. Thanks for sharing!

This marinade was a huge hit with my family.  I didn't think ahead and only marinated for a couple of hours and threw the pork chops on the grill.   They turned out so good they would of put a hump on a camel.  Thanks for sharing Virgil.

I enjoy trying a variety of marinades, and this is very definitely one of the best. I only had time to marinade the thick pork chops for 2 1/2 hours and that was still long enough to infuse them with a memorable flavor, surprisingly intense for such a short marinading time. I did use extra virgin olive oil rather than canola oil.

I highly recommend marinating overnight as stated in the directions. I didn't have time to do that and although my pork was a beautiful color after grilling, it didn't have much flavor. Thanks for sharing. :o)
