The only thing I would change in this recipe would be the amount of seasoning salt, it was too much.  Perhaps there was a mistake in quantity?  I feel that 1.5 teaspoons of seasoning salt would be sufficient.  Also, I agree that it does tend to taste better after sitting in the fridge overnight.  Our family will continue to use this recipe!!

This dip was great, served it to company and they loved it!  Definately make it the night before, as suggested to enhance the flavor.  It didn't taste right when I first mixed the ingredients together, but 24hrs later, it was excellent.

If you love simple things, this is for you.  I put this dip in a loaf of fresh round bread & then serve it with breads, veggies & chips!

This is a very good dip, but I definitely suggest cutting the season salt in half and go from there.  It was way too salty.

I forgot to pick up a dip mix at the store, so I looked for a recipe from scratch and I found this one. I will never use a dip mix from the grocery store again! This was great! I think I might use it for little Christmas handouts next year - just the dry ingredients with a recipe gift tag.THANKS!

Good, basic and reliable vegetable dip. Nothing weird or exotic here, therefore there's nothing not to like.  I backed off on the onion quite a bit and used fresh rather than dried parsley.

Much better than plain ranch dip for veggies or chips.  Better made a day ahead - more flavor that way.

The amount of seasoning salt HAS to be a typo. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons and it was a perfect balance of saltiness. Using a full tablespoon and a half would result in disaster.
I halved the recipe as it would have made entirely too much.
I also have a preference for fresh herbs and used fresh for both dill and parsley. I added quite a bit of dill, several handfuls and it still resulted in a mild taste. 
I made it the nite before I planned on using it and the flavors meld well that way. The dip had a very different (and much better) taste the next day.
I used very thinly diced red onion and slivered green onion to add some color.
The dip was perfect altered. I'll never buy store dips again.

Excellent dip! Substituted 0% Greek Yogurt for the mayo and used fat free sour cream to make it healthier. Huge success! I'm not a fan of store bought dips, let alone dill, but this was delicious!

I cut the seasoning salt in half and still found it way too salty. Next time, I'll use a pinch and add it gradually until it's where I want it to be. That said, this is a very dill-y dip and I liked it, seasoning salt issues aside.

I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the necessary salt adjustment - I used 1 tsp. of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning. My family's favorite dip by far!

Very good dill sauce. very easy to put together, took me less than 5 minutes actually. I scaled this down for two people using 1cup mayonnaise and 1 cup sour cream, added fresh italian parsely, fresh dill and little salt to taste. As for the grated onion, I chose to scale back a lot on this. I let it sit for over 6 hours and the results was a real nice flavorful dilly dill sauce. I was very pleased with the overall balance of flavors. I am glad that I did not add 1 1/2 T of salt, seems like a whole lot for the recipe. I served this alongside with, "Potato Salmon Patties," from this site, a nice complement!

I took this recipe to a gathering and they loved it.  I made it with fresh dill instead and cut the dill down to 2 tablespoons.  It's delicious but high in fat.

Like many other reviewers this has good flavor EXCEPT there is way too much seasoning salt.  I had to double exerything in this recipe except the salt just to make it palatable.  And that was after letting it sit a day.  I would start at 1/2 to 1 tsp salt NOT tabelspoon.

Great dip, but you definitely need to reduce the amount of season salt.  I used dried onion instead of fresh, and the second time I made it put a couple sliced green onions in it with the dried onion.  I like to cut the mayo with about 1/4 plain yogurt.

Great dip, but I would suggest using half the seasoned salt at first and then adding (or not) from there to suit your taste. I adore salty foods, but this was a bit too salty for me and my salt-loving family. I ended up adding extra sour cream, mayo and parsley to cut down on the saltiness. Otherwise, this is an easy and delicious recipe that I will definitely make again.

Used this recipe as veggie dip for my x-mas party.  I'm not a fan of mayo, so I used 2 parts lite sour cream to 1 part lite mayo.  It was perfect.  I also substituted shallots for onions.  As others stated, let the flavors meld for a few hours before serving.  Delish!

I thought this was a really good dip, though my only complaint is it had a bit too much of a mayonnaise taste. Next time I'll use 3/4 part sour cream to 1/4 part mayo and I think that'll make it perfect for me. I also halved the recipe and it still made quite a lot.

This recipe is great! The only things i do differently is  1.5 Tsp of salt (the 1.5 Tbsp is too much for me) and I add about 15 slices of chopped up dried Hormel beef. If you do this make sure to rinse in cold water first to cut the salt in this as well. Delish!

My son-in-law made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and it was excellent, EXCEPT FOR THE AMOUNT OF SALT.  I think the salt in the recipe should be cut down to teaspoon, but slowly add the salt in and keep tasting to make sure you have it right. 

I wanted to be fair by giving it 5 stars knowing that the next time we make it the salt will be reduced.

Excellent recipe and very simple.  I did add about 1/2T sugar and a little less seasoning salt but this recipe is one of the best.

OK.  Just waaaaay too salty, and I like salt! Next time I will try cutting back seasoning salt to 1/2 the amount.

Thank you so much for sharing this-it saved Christmas! We were devistated when we found that the whole town was out of dill dip, and while looking at the ingredients in this I still had my doubts but if it was good enough for a mother to want it protected forever it was good enough for me, and it was AMAZING! We didn't have time to let it rest before serving but it was still great, the dill had such a strong flavor (you may want to cut back a touch if you don't love dill as much). I don't think we'll ever buy dill dip again! Thank you!

Very good, but as said by other reviews it was very salty.  I would recommend adding the salt by tsp. until you are satisfied with the flavor.  Also, this does make A LOT of dip!  Next time I will halve it.  I can see why your mom didn't want you to share this recipe, it's very good and the flavor is so close to store-bought but almost better!

Could use less dill. The taste was way too strong. About half the people liked it and the other half did not.

Quartered the recipe (for 2 people)so I used 1/2 c each of light mayo and non-fat sour cream.  Also halved the seasoning salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  As other reviewers suggested the flavors of this dip need a day to fully develop, DID NOT taste right the day is was made.  Will make again!

My mom & I have made this dip for YEARS!  It's so yummy & everyone loves it.  When asked what I should bring to a gathering, everyone always asks for the veggie tray & dip .   mmmmmmm So Good!!!  Only difference we have in this recipe is we add a few dashes of worcestershire sauce and 6 or so drops of tabasco sauce.

This is a yummy dip!  I halved the recipe since I didn't need quite so much.  I made it the night before and used 1 1/4 cups fat free sour cream and 3/4 cup low fat mayo, it was healthy and yummy with carrot sticks, cucumber and celery!  Even my hubby who doesn't care for dill enjoyed this dip!

This recipe makes a very large amount. I prepared it as written. I felt it was a little heavy on the mayo taste and quite salty. I would decrease the salt, especially if serving with chips. I also found the onion flavor to overwhelm the dill flavor.

delicious and a big hit at the memorial day bbq that I brought it to along with an array of vegetables.  I used fresh dill which was great but I would substitute dried during the winter months.

My husband and I really liked this dip. I followed the advice of others and decreased the salt. I did not make it for the veggie dip, instead I made it for our fish tacos. It was a great spread to the tortillia shell. This is our replacement for tarter sauce, too.
Very tasty!!

Way too salty. I cut the season salt in half and it was still too salty. I had to add a cup of Miracle Whip to cut the salty taste. I also added minced garlic. Turned out good.

Add a can of corned beef and serve with bread toasts or crackers! The dill and corned beef blend is PERFECT for St Pats and really good. Or for those meat-eaters in your life. Use a hand mixer to blend in the beef so it's not chunky--canned corn beef ain't pretty.

It was good, a little strong for some reason? I cut it in 1/2 all but the season salt and only added 1tsp. I served it at a party last night and people didn't devour it like my last dip so thats why 3 stars. I wouldn't discourage people from trying this though, It may have been just something I did wrong. Thanks

Awesome just as written.  Only change I made was to use "light" mayo and sour cream.  I used the amount of salt called for and it was fine...guess we just like more seasoning on our dishes.

I made this to go with the veggies at thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! I used fresh dill and fresh scallions and instead of the seasoning salt, I added a little garlic powder (about 1 tsp.) and black pepper (1/4 tsp) and some salt to taste. Next time I make this, I will try it with low fat sour cream and no mayo to make it healthier. *Update: I have made this with light sour cream and low fat mayo and could not tell a difference in taste- I would recommend it! I have also made it with fat free sour cream and no mayo to be super healthy and it was also good, but i would recommend using light sour cream.

I will NEVER  buy dill dip again.! Excellent & so simple to make!!!

After reading some of the reviews on how salty the dip was. I added the season salt slowly  & found the amount of season salt was perfect for it. The freshly grated onion really makes the dip. I wouldn't change anything in the recipe. It's PERFECT the way it is.  Thanks for sharing your mother's recipe!   :-)

AWESOME! Will never buy store bought veggie dip again! I replaced the onion for garlic (personal preference), used lite mayo and sr crm and used Tastefully Simples seasoning salt (only 1.5 tsp & NOT tablespoons as called for). It makes a lot and there was still NONE left!

WOW - was this SALTY! I only used less than one tablespoon of salt and had to double the other ingredients again to cut the salt and it was still too salty! I agree with Tanya Joe's idea - maybe it should have been 1 1/2 tsp, not tablespoon.  I will use it again because it is nice and fresh tasting but cut the salt to 1 1/2 tsp.

This dip is so quick and easy.  It tastes great right away but is even better if made the day before.    I've made this three times now and it is definitely a keeper.

Made exactly as listed because I forgot that everyone said to cut the salt. At first taste it was extra salty - BUT as a party food with drinks and sweets, it was FINE! I put 1/2 in a bread bowl and saved half for a party the next night, but had to refill the bowl before the first party ended. Definitely enough for a party and too much for a family snack.

This recipe was easy to make ahead of time, however, I definitely would only make 1/2 of the recipe the next time as it made way to much.  I used garlic seasoning salt and listened to the other review and used 1 1/2 tsp.  instead of 1 tbls.

Still prefer my good friend Michelle's dill dip recipe but may be able to tinker with this one to see if I can match it by adding cream cheese to it and using fresh dill.

A simple, flavorful dip. I used dried, minced onion in place of fresh and more dill than called for (I didn't measure, just judged by taste). And I took the other suggestions about salt. I actually used only a pinch or two of salt and it was just right. I served this with a giant fresh vegetable platter (baby carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber and grape tomatoes) at an Easter brunch and everyone loved it!

WOW! So delicious! I did not have seasoning salt, so I used a homemade version from this website and per other reviews, I used about 1 TSP instead of TB. I also used chopped green onion for the grated onion and I used fresh dill because I have a ton in the garden right now. I used probably 1/3 of a cup of chopped fresh dill, maybe more. I used lite Daisy sour cream and regular Hellmans.  It was perfect. It sat for about a day and a half before we tried it and the flavors blended perfectly. We used this for raw veggies and potato chips. I think I would use it on a baked potato next time, too. I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty for two meals with guests where we had veggies out.

This dip is fantastic for chips or veggies.  I will only use a dash of salt, if any.  As it sits, the onion and dill give it all the flavour it needs.  Definitely a keeper!

I agree about the salt - I forgot to read the reviews (like I always do before making a recipe from here), so now I have to double (I had only made a half-batch in the first place) to counter-act the saltiness!

I use a mix of fresh and dried dill, and sea salt instead of seasoning salt. Dill has a significant amount of vitamin A and vitamin C, as well as trace amounts of folate, iron, and manganese. It also helps digestion, fights against free radicals and more. A perfect and healthy dip for your fresh veggies!

I have been making a version of Dill Dip for years.  This was good (though needed to cut down on portion and salt) Great for veggies.  My variation: 1/2 cup Olive Oil Reduced Fat Mayo,1/2 Cup fat free greek yogurt, 1.5 tablespoon of dry Dillweed, 1.5 tblspoon dry minced onion, 1 Tblspn Lawry's Seasoning Salt.  Must meld for at least a couple of hours.

This dip is excellent.  I serve it with swedish rye bread.  I buy a round boule, holllow it out, put the dip inside the bread.  Tear up small bread hunks to dip with.  I usually use 1/3 Cup of dried onion instead of the fresh. It's really great at holiday parties.  Enjoy!

This was ok. It was way too salty for my taste, but I did have a few people in the office tell me it was delicious. Different strokes for different folks, I guess. I did think the salty flavor fit well with sweet Hawaiian bread. Next time I will defintely use less Seasoning Salt.

I made this pretty much as written and this is great!  I did half the recipe, as I do not need 4 cups of dip all at once LOL.  I also purposely used fresh dill, just as a preference.  I used light mayo and sour cream as well.  While making this, I found that I was all out of dried parsley, so I had to sub using fresh.  I also cut back on the seasoning salt due to other reviewers.  I let it sit over night before I tasted it, and it is pretty darn good.  Will more then likely make this again.

Great recipe!  I used low fat mayo and maybe a 1/2 tablespoon less of dried dill.  Chilling for 24 hours is the way to go.  Gives the flavors time to meld.  It was a big hit with chips, crackers, and baby carrots.  Thanks!!

Wonderful dip! We ate right away, and it was very flavorful. My husband chose the wine, and looking again at the recipe card, I see he was right on! Can't buy a better dip! Thank you!

I am addicted!  It is good with veggies, pretzels, crackers, tortilla chips, on cucumber sandwiches.  I thought the full recipe would make too much dip so I made a half batch the first time.  We licked the bowl clean pretty quickly, so I now make a full batch for parties.    I cut the salt down to 1-1/2 t.

I made it following the directions and it was way too salty - even after letting it sit for 2 days.  Once I added a lot more sour cream and mayo it was heavenly and addicting!  Will most definitely be making it again but with much less seasoning salt.

I needed a made from scratch recipe that did not contain cream cheese and this worked perfect although I will reduce the salt the next time.  Recipe makes a large batch so I halved it.

It was a pretty good Dill Dip, would cut the seasoning salt down next time as so many others have suggested.  Also you so need to wait at LEAST 24 hours before eating this dip.

I didn't add as much season salt as it says because I'm not a big salt eater.  Made a day ahead and put it in the fridge to let the flavor of the dill come out.  Served in a bread bowl and everyone loved it!!

Great recipe - everyone loved it.  I've made it twice now.  I use fresh dill and I think that makes a big difference.  I also add a little garlic salt and garlic powder.  I made it without the seasoning salt but I thought something was missing so I added just a little (maybe a teaspoon or so) and it was perfect.

Perfect and tastey, I used 1/2 tblsp of garlick salt for the seasoning salt and followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  I cut the recipe in half and still had a little left....not saying that it didn't go...there were only five of us.

A fabulous break from Ranch Dip! Wow---so flavorful! My son-in-law is on a low-salt diet, so we made it w/o the seasoned salt. No one missed it! But if you want a bit of a salty flavor, I think just 1/2 - 1 tsp. would be plenty.

Too salty by far to me, but everyone else liked it.  The second time, I ommitted the seasoning salt entirely and it tasted pretty good.  Maybe just a dash would be best.

This was easy and good. Per other reviews I cut the amount of season salt by 1/2 and used tony catchers brand cajun seasoning. It had a good flavor with veggies. Easy and inexpensive, much better flavor than store bought.

This is great.  I halve the whole recipe (I don't have many to prepare for) and only use 1 teaspoon of seasoning salt. I have made it with green onion instead of grated onion and I love it that way also.  Definitely more flavorful when refrigerated overnight.

There must be a misprint on this recipe because 1 1/2 Tablespoons seasoned salt is outrageous. I never put that much in to begin with. I now put only 2 teaspoons to a whole batch and it is perfectly wonderful!!!!!!! It might also depend some on what brand of Seasoning salt you are using?? My reasoning is that you can always put more n later, but you can never take it out after you've dumped it in. It's better after refrigerating overnight, but still good right away. It's so good you can't stop eating.....similar to chocolate for me, but more healthy (w/ veggies of course :)

We substitute plain yogurt for the mayonnaise.  The longer it sits, the better the dill flavor gets.

This recipe is super yummy.  My family likes it on top of sliced cucumbers. I did cut down on the season salt. Used 1 1/2 teaspoons and it turned out just right for us. My advice is to start with a little then after it sets, taste it, and add more if you like. This is definitely a must try recipe.

I didn't use the salt and added 2 small jars of marinated artichoke hearts and 2 small cans of crab.. Great dip.

Soo good!  I made this for a party and it was a success!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used less seasoned salt...I used about 2 teaspoons.  So easy!

This is delicious dip! I made it exactly by the recipe and then decided it needed a bit more dill -- perfect. It definitely needs to sit overnight for flavors to blend. It is very good on baked potatoes also -- a nice change from plain sour cream!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars only because it was AWESOME with salted pretzels. Otherwise, to me, for a veggie dip it was a little bland. But then again, I like saltier foods. But seriously, I couldn't stop eating it with the pretzels!

Wonderful...even without the onion.  I added a little bit of a lemon herb mixture that I had on hand.  Gave it a little extra zip.  A keeper.

Easy to prepare with very few ingredients. No more dip seasoning packs for me! I don't like onion so I left it out but if I make it for company I will put it in because without it, there's something lacking.

Great dill dip!  Significantly improves after chilling.  I like to hollow out a round of brown bread and put the dip in the bread bowl and serve with fresh veggies and the leftover bread.

Awesome.  I used this as dip for a pumpernickle bread and veggie tray.  Everyone raved about how good it was.  Most people thought it was some fancy name brand.  I had enough to easily feed the 17 people at my thanksgiving dinner so I would suggest halving the recipe if you don't plan on having too many guests.

This is good stuff. I took it to a meeting and got complements, the best of which was that I didn't have any to take home. (I also reduced the season salt amount; I think that was a misprint.)

Very flavourful and easy!!  The only thing I did differently was use 1.5 tsp of seasoning salt as per earlier comment and it was just enough.  I would make this again!

I read the reviews and cut the season salt in half. Didn't think it was dill-y enough so added an extra tsp of dill. Also added 2 tsp of paprika to sneak in  extra vitamin c(I do this to everything I make,  paprika doesn't change taste). Will definitely make again.

Made as stated, I give this 4 stars.  The flavor is really good, but it is too salty and has just a tad too much of a mayo taste.  Next time I will cut the amount of season salt in half and taste test from there to see if more is needed.  I think I will also cut back the amount of mayonnaise to 3/4 cup and taste to see if more is needed from there.

Pretty good, obviously makes a LOT.  Unfortunately, it's way too early for my husband and I.  Still good enough to eat, but only very little at a time.  Next time, I'll halve the seasoning salt.

Just watch the seasoning salt. I would only put in 1/2 then try it.  It was a little to salty for me

This is a good recipe, but it is way too salty. I think there might be an error in how much seasoning salt to use. I had to keep adding more sour cream and some sugar to tame the saltiness!

Used Pink Himalayan instead of seasoned salt. It was delicious and I was asked to share the recipe the first time I made it. Love it is made the day before. Next time I will try the 'light' versions of mayo and sour cream and see if it is as excellent.

Excellent taste!
Modified
2 Cups of Vegan Mayonaise
2 Cups of Zero Fat Greek Yogurt
Fresh Cut Parsley - Fresh from Garden
Quadruple the amount of Dill  - Fresh from Garden
Added: Garlic Powder,  3 to 4 Finger Pinches of Salt, Grated Lemon Zest, Lemon Juice.

Great basic recipe with room to substitute.  Tastes very rich and creamy.  My six year old was leary, but he loves it.  Going to bring it to a first grade class for them to dip fresh veggies from their school garden.

It's a great recipe.  The only thing I had to do was reduce the amount of Mayo and salt.  I'm just not a fan of mayonnaise.  Definitely make ahead so the flavors have time to blend.

Halved recipe and used Greek yogurt for the mayo. Used minced onion flakes and fresh dill. Used sea salt but to make it more like seasoned salt I added some pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. It came out really good!

Recipe is good, it’s what I was looking for- but the amount of salt is too much.  I figured as much before making it, reduced it in half and it was still salty. Went back to the store, bought more sour cream and mayo...added more dill and all other ingredients except salt.  Perfect!  I recommend using maybe a half teaspoon salt.  You can always add more, you can’t take it away.

This was an excellent dip and easy to make. One adjustment I made as another reviewer had said, is to reduce the amount of salt. I found 1 tbsp to be good for my tastes (and I like things a little saltier than most).

Followed the advice of others and cut the seasoning salt down. I only used 1 teaspoon and it was perfect, 1-1/2 tablespoons would have killed this! I used onion powder because my husband won't eat onions. This makes a lot of dip. Dill dip is great served with a vegetable tray or even on pretzels.

The first time I made this, it turned out great. Be sure to let it sit overnight before serving! There was a LOT of it. The second time I adjusted the recipe by cutting the amount of servings in half on the site and used dried onion instead of grated and bay seasoning instead of seasoning salt. Still turned out awesome!

As written, this recipe tastes way too much like mayo. I'm going to try to double up all the other ingredients to half the mayo taste and see if I can salvage this.

Excellent recipe! As other reviewers stated, I decreased the amount of seasoned salt by about half. I also added a dash of lemon pepper because I love the combination of lemon and dill. All around a quick, delicious dip!

I used to get the store made dip from the deli back home. Now that we are living overseas and can't get it I tried this recipe. It tastes just as good, if not better than the stuff from the store.

Tried this for the first time on Thanksgiving.  It was a huge hit.  I agree with some of the other reviewers in that there was a bit too much seasoned salt for my taste.  Plan on making it again for a larger crowd at Christmas.

I think this recipe is to salty also. I'm wondering if it shouldn't read teaspoons for the seasoning salt instead of tablespoons. I made the recipe using 4 cups of mayo,4 cups sour cream, etc. To get rid of the salty taste I lowered the servings to measure 1 cup of each and the appropriate measurements for all other ingredients. Added to the original mix and it seems to take a lot of the salty taste away.

Wonderful recipe!!! Glad you shared. Very easy to half and still tastes wonderful. I added Bon appetit seasoning. My husband said it's the best dip he has had. Much better than the onion packs and sour cream you can mix up.

Pretty good but make sure you go with less seasoning salt.  I put in 1 1/2 tsp and it was still a bit on the salty side.

This was really yummy but I did have to make a few adjustments. The mayo was a little too overpowering, so I added an extra cup of sourcream. I do not recommend using Miracle Whip for this recipe - way too sweet! I also added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and some onion powder in place of the grated onion. Served it with rye bread and it was a hit!

I had to give this only 4 stars as it was not a huge hit at the party I served it at.  People who ate it really liked it, but it wasnt irresistable.  
I would make it again though, as people really did like it.

Terrific recipe.  I should have halved it though for the wedding shower I hosted for 25 women.  I used organic seasonings I had dried myself.  It made it truly yummy.  I thought it was too salty.

So delicious! As a previous reviewer said, the grated onion is really the key here. I didn't really measure anything with this recipe, just whooped it all up together til the taste was right for us and we loved it. I'm thinking adding a splash of lemon next time. Thank you!

This is a staple for me now.  The fresh grated onion is the key - I add extra.  It is better if you make it ahead, but is still good if you make it last minute.

This dip was ok, but next time I would add just a hair bit more dill and sour cream.  Had to much of a mayo taste.  Plus, I would scale it down.  I made the original recipe for about 15 people, and I still have a ton left over.

I used light mayo and sour cream, and no one was the wiser.  We sampled it yesterday, and it was good... but letting it sit overnight made it fantastic.  I've never seen a platter of veggies go faster in my life!

I've been looking for a dill dip or sauce I've had at a restaurant served with chilled asparagus.  This isn't quite it but was good, if a little bland.  I added some garlic and replaced some of the sour cream with plain yogurt to make a thinner consistency.  I'll keep tinkering with this one!

This is a great simple dip to make!  I did use Spike seasoning instead of season salt and added a dash or 2 of Parika!  I served with sourdough bread pieces and there was nothing to take home!

This recipe is loved by my friends.  I always get asked to bring it to parties.  It has a fresh taste due to the dill and is great with a veggie platter.

I think this is the best dip I've ever made.  It was so easy and did taste even better the 2nd day.  It is especially great for dipping veggies.  I'll be making this over and over.

I used this dip for vegetables and it was OK, but way too sweet. I did use miracle whip instead of mayo though......

Great dip! I let this dip sit overnight in the fridge and to me it was a little bland the next morning. So I added extra of everything except the salt that added the zip for me. Loved it, thanks!

Easy to make and tasted great.  I put it in a bread bowl and dipped bread in it- everybody loved it.  It lasts a long time too.  I kept it in my fridge about 3 weeks and kept using it do dip veggies.  This recipe makes tons-it can easily be halved.

This recipe is so delicious, I'm glad I found it! And I can't believe how quick and easy it was to make.  I didn't have fresh onion either, so I used some dried chopped onion instead and it was still tasty.
