I thought this was very good- much better than the other mongolian beef I tried at home. Only change I made was to also add one onion, sliced...to me, mongolian beef in restaurants always has that. It did have a nice kick to it...my husband thought it was one of the best he'd had! Thanks for sharing- I will make again, although I may reduce the hot chili oil next time. I served over rice, and it was delicious!

Excellent! I followed this recipe exactly, except for skipping the salt at the end (taste it first, I'm a bit salt-sensitive, so you may decide you want it). I was a little skeptical about the freezing and thawing and freezing again and thawing again, but it all came together beautifully and tastes very much Mongolian Beef-y. I ate way too much. Thanks for the recipe! :)

This was the best Mongolian Beef I have ever had ANYWHERE. It was especially better the next day after all the flavors had time to blend with each other. It was even more spicy...mmmmm good. A MUST make if you like Mongolian Beef. A+++

This was yummy!  I had some red swiss chard from our CSA box to use and I was looking for a recipe that would work well for our family - this was great!  I didn't use the hot chili oil or the red pepper flakes because I was suiting tastes to a 1 and 3 year old, and I actually used beef broth instead of the chicken stock because it was expiring soon :)  We'll definitely make this again!  I also think it would be a pretty easy recipe to prep the meat ahead of time when it goes on sale and keep it frozen for later use.  Thanks!

Great flavor.  Gave it 4 stars because i had to omit the red pepper flakes and take the oil down a bit on second cooking.  Was so spicy kids couldn't eat it and our lips burned first time around, but once adjusted it has become a staple to use our chard.

Delicious!  This was my first attempt at Mongolian Beef.  I followed this recipe as written with the only exception of halving hot chili oil and red pepper flakes (cannot tolerate overly spicy food and I followed previous review comments).  Will definitely make again.  Heck, I never even bought swiss chard before, but oh my!  This is a must make!

Skirt steak works better here than flank if you can get it. Follow the "cooks note" about partially freezing before cutting and be sure to cut against the grain. Always my favorite dish while having the priviledge to work for 2 years in a chinese restraunt. This is as close as it gets..maybe better. It's meant to be hot..manage the heat with the chile/seasame oil, we use whole dried chile peppers on "step two" of the recipe and you can simply crush red peps and put them in seasame oil to  make your own hot oil. this makes it easier to find your prefered heat level for next time. We did not use char but what a perfect place for it. Topped with maifun rice sticks and of course Jasman rice on the side. Peanut oil is also a key ingredient. Flash cook the meat very hot dont over do it. Thanks for this great recipe

I wouldn't call this Mongolian beef exactly--its diluted/mellow flavors remind me of Green onion beef; however, it's a good base to tweak.  A bit too sweet; missing something!

Had to substitute the sherry (who has that anyways?). Not sure if that's the key or not, but it was too vinegary and was missing that nice brown sauciness you get from real Chinese food.

This is not Mongolian beef! I even used a beter cut of meat, rib eye roast sliced thin. I have never left a review before but decided it is now time. Do not waste your time if your looking for a true mongo beef recipe

My family said it was "OK" but I personally thought the sauce was awful. Way too sweet for my taste and had sort of a sort of "allspice-y" scent to it.  I'll give it this - it was flavorful, I just didn't care for the flavor.

Excellent taste! This is very spicy..I would reduce the chili oil and red pepper flakes.. otherwise excellent flavor. Better to have less spice than too much. 
Remember you can always add spice,  you can't take spice away! We served with fried vermicelli rice noodles-this added a little something different than white rice.
Will make again!

I don't like spicy-hot foods, so I left out the hot chili oil and only used 1 tsp. pepper flakes.  Also didn't have any oyster sauce.  Very tasty, although still a little too warm for my liking.  Will try 1/2 tsp. pepper flakes next time.  Love the flavors and textures.

This was terrible.  Way too spicy for us.  One bite had us running for bread & water to cool our mouthes.  Didn't taste anything like the Mongolian beef I've eaten before.

This was a very nice meal served over white rice.  Not as good as our local Chinese resurant, but very good.  My family is looking forward to having it again.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I didn't taste anything like Mongolian beef to me. My brother really enjoyed it but he doesn't like mongolian beef. My husband said it wasn't bad but didn't taste like Mongolian beef (that is his favorite chinese dish). I could barely eat it and gave up half-way through my dish. I would not recommend this.

I made this recipe according to the directions. It was really too hot for me. I would recommend cutting back on the hot chili oil down to just one tablespoon, instead of three.

My husband and I didn't like this much. It had kind of a sour taste, and the sauce was not nearly as spicy as I would expect with that much chili oil and red pepper flakes. Our 8 year old daughter said she liked it though. Our search continues for a good mongolian beef recipe.

I’m not an expert on Mongolian food but this is delicious!! It had quite a kick and I too would hold back on the chili oil a bit and use more peanut oil.

We like this dish a lot. We've been making it for several years now. For the most part we make this as directed. My only add is mushrooms, which I toss in with the meat. The next time I make this I'm going to add red bell peppers, I think that will add to this already great dish.

I tripled the recipe. 6 tsp. of crushed red peppers seemed beyond crazy, so I put in a slightly heaped single tsp. (In the tripled recipe) I didn't have the pepper oil, so I put a few splashes of a hot pepper sauce. Instead of the chard, which I didn't have, I added several handfuls of diced carrots, a drained can full of water chestnuts, and a drained can of sliced "baby corn" (they look like mini corn on the cob). We just like more veggies. I followed the recipe for mixing the sauce ingredients and then mixing in the raw meat. I did not do the whole freeze and thaw thing--the point of a wok recipe is that it is fast. I just let the meat marinade in the sauce in the fridge for a couple hours. We all loved the finished product! The reason I only gave the recipe three stars is because had I used the 6 tsp. of crushed red peppers in my triple batch it would have been inedible. Scaling back that one ingredient made for a wonderful, still slightly spicy dish. We eat tons of ethnic recipes, and this one will go in our "keeper" file.

I love spice , so if you don't I would cut out or cut  down the chili oil and pepper flakes .  The dish had a wonderful flavor, will definitely make it again.  I was skeptical on the freezing part, but it worked!

Upon reading all the reviews i made 2 seperate batches of this recipe.  One for my husband and I and then 1 for my children.  I didnt use the hot oil and only 1 tsp of crushed red peppers for my children's recipe and for the adults i made my own hot chili oil by adding 4 tsp crushed peppers to the 3 Tbsp sesame oil, i only added 1 additional tsp of the peppers later.  Everyone at the table loved it!  The older kids even liked a few pieces of the adults. I dont know that it tasted like Mongolian beef, but this was awesome!  I served over brown rice and a small bowl of miso soup. If you are spicy sensitive substitute the hot chili oil for sesame oil, but if you like spicy then this is a perfect recipe for you!!!

This was a surprisingly good recipe. I followed the recipe exactly because I had never made anything Mongolian before and wanted to make sure to get it right. I'm glad I didn't change anything because it came out delicious! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

O M G! That Was The Best Ever. I Made This For My Whole Family, And My Husband Who Is Picky About His Flavors Of Food And Freshness, Loved It so Much. I Did Double Up On The Sauce Though To Make It A Little Extra Goopy. Fabulous Recipe.

This recipe was easy to make, however it did not taste "Mongolian".  
This tasted more like a hot and spicy beef dish.  I will keep searching if anyone has any ideas...

This was excellent.  A bit hot for the hubby, so next time not as much red pepper.

This was a delicious recipe! I didn't have any hot chili oil or red pepper flakes, so I substituted it with Sriracha hot sauce instead to give it a spicy kick. Also skipped out on the Swiss chard, and added some sauteed onions. It still turned out great and I'll definitely be making this again! :)

Wow! Delighted the entire crowd : parents and teen-aged sons.  Easy too.  Except for toning down spices for more immature palates (like husband's), I followed recipe exactly.  Would add more chard next time as there was plenty of sauce and we like greens.  We fought over the tender left-overs for lunch the next day.
