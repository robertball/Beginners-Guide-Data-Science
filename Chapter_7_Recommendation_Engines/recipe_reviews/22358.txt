I love hot chocolate especially when it can be made in the microwave.  This was really good.  I added a few shakes of cinnamon to mine just for extra flavor.  I used about 3/4 cup skim milk and about 1/4 whole milk.  Turned out great.

If you think this was bitter you obviously got the measurements of cocoa and sugar wrong. Perhaps you did notice the measurements were in TABLEspoons for sugar and TEAspoons for cocoa? If anything this was a little on the sweet side! Tastes GREAT!!

Simple to prepare though it is just as easy to just use prepared cocoa mix. Tastes the same.

This is really good and simple. A little too much sugar for me so I'd probably find a way to cut back on that either by adding water or less sugar. But this is very good and creamy.

This leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. It needs more sugar. I will stick to my usuasl brand.

It's perfectly chocolate until you get to the bottom of your cup!  I stirred thoroughly, but there was a good amount of cocoa that didn't dissolve; definitely a bittersweet ending!  And not the smoothest hot cocoa either.

Easy yet great tasting. I think it is creamier than traditional cocoa mix but then again I did splurge and use whole milk. Also added marshmallows to the top (can't be cocoa without the marshmallows.)

This tasted good but it wasn't anything special, and then I had several dirty dishes to clean. I will continue to use the powdered hot chocolate mixes instead.

This is by far the best hot cocoa I have made yet. After i take it out of the microwave, I put it in the blender ( i like it shaken, not stirred, haha) for a few seconds, transfer it to mug and top with whipped cream and a few chocolate bar shavings!!! Thanx Hershey's!!!

This has been a regular at our house for quite some time. Sometimes I make myself a cup and put miniature marshmallows or a spoonfull of marshmallow cream on top, (I like the cream the best). Or sometimes I make it by the pot for the whole family. Either way it is a treat on a cold wintry day!!

Kids like this better than most of the pre-mixed powders. We mix the dry ingredients in bulk ahead of time, so it's practically as convenient as pre-mix, but less expensive. I usually add some nutmug around Advent season.

This was very good if not better than any store bought mix I've tried.  Definitely comforting on a cold night! I read that one other reviewer had problems with cocoa that didn't dissolve.  To avoid this I simply sifted my cocoa after measuring it out- no more lumps.

My kids have been playing outside in the snow.  So, I just made this cocoa for them.  They loved it!  It's definitely a keeper.

Delicious. I had been looking for a hot chocolate recipe that I could make lactose-free. I used lactose-free skim milk, and added a dash of cinnamon. Word to the wise though--- stir well before drinking!

This is a wonderful recipe. I changed the 2 tablespoons of sugar to 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon. It came out just right for me, my friend even thought it was a little too sweet. I will try just 1 tablespoon of sugar next time.

great recipe that's so easy to make! I found it to be a bit too sweet, so I might cut down on the sugar the next time I make it. otherwise the chocolate taste is just perfect :D

Best hot chocolate I've ever had!  I changed the 2 tsp Cocoa Powder to 1 tbsp, and it still came out great.  Add some cinnamon on top for an extra kick.

My husband and sons were working outside on a bird house for me and it was freezing due to the winds.  (Knocked over my purple martin house)  I decided to suprise them and tried this recipe and they really liked it.  I added some whipped cream on top and it warmed them up nicely.  Thanks!

Very good.  My cocoa lumped up; I will sift next time.  I only used 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon of sugar, as noted above.
