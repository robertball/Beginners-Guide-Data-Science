Delicious, simple, elegant.  Wonderfully flavourful.  
We used 1 1/2 tbsp of fresh rosemary and 1 tbsp of fresh basil instead of the dry as well as fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Also used reduced fat swiss cheese slices and they worked great.
Will definitely make again!

This was absolutely wonderful!  A terrific appetizer, as a flat bread and accompaniment to a meal (as I served), a side for soup or salad, delicious.  However, I believe this would be a five star if made with fresh rosemary and basil.  Dried herbs, unless soaked in liquid over time, just don't have the fresh, robust flavor this tart deserves.  A definite keeper with these revisions.  Addendum 10/21:  I have been using this as a quickie appy with raves, my guest tonight said "this is fabulous, where do you buy it?"  Excuse me!!!!!

As written this is probably a 3-star, but fresh herbs significantly improve the flavor.  My tart was somewhat watery, and I would suggest seeding the tomatoes and patting them dry before putting them in the crust.  I found this to be a light and refreshing summertime treat that's easy to make.

This was very nice for a light meal, but it seemed more like a "white" pizza than a tart.  I did add a little bit of sun-dried tomato pesto to the crust before the other ingredients because I thought it would be too dry.  Also, I used fresh rosemary and doubled what the dry ingredients had called for.  I also used whole, fresh basil leaves, and simply  covered the entire crust with them (I love basil!)  I also used garlic powder instead of the salt, and used "Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt" instead.  It came out great!  My sister, who I think is an excellent cook said, "Why is this SO GOOD?!"

I made this with fresh basil, I put the sliced tomatoes on kitchen towel to soak up some of the moisture, and I added a little bit of Parmesan. I think it would be good with goat's cheese too. It took about 15 mins in the oven. Thanks!

Very good tart!  I used a Crisco pie crust and some flavored boursin cheese for this.  I did drain the tomatoes a bit so they wouldn't be soggy.  This was so easy to make, and very delicious. I made this the day before, and it didn't get soggy.   It was a good dinner with salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I used fresh rosemary and basil.  I'm curious how this would be with mozz instead of swiss, but I had some swiss that was about to go bad and this was a perfect way to use it.  Very yummy and fresh tasting.
