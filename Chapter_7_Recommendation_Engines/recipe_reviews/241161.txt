There is double the coconut flour in this recipe, otherwise it is a basic recipe. So, put only 1/8 cup (2 tbls) of flour. Also add 1/4 cup of cream, H&H, milk or other liquid. To make them fluffy, separate the eggs and beat the egg whites, folding them in to the mixed ingredients at the very end. It will still be thick, not runny like a wheat flour pancake batter.

As this recipe is written, I was unable to eat these pancakes. 2 eggs and 1/4 coconut flour - (Bob's Red Mill (R) brand) with 2 Tbsp of coconut oil made a dough, not a batter. I added one more egg and this didn't help. In the end, I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream and that turned it into a very thick batter that I could scoop out with a spoon. I started off with warm oil and room temperature eggs but it still wasn't liquid-the coconut oil goes back to its solid state anyway. I attempted one pancake with the original ingredients and it burned into a blob after the oil melted again. After adding the aforementioned ingredients I was able to make the pancakes. The initial taste is nice. The texture is eggy and delicate. I couldn't finish the plate though, after about 5 bites I'd had enough. Sorry, Nicky, this just didn't work out for me.

this was the worst pancake recipe I've ever seen.  It was yellow muck !   Tried to add some Almond milk so that I could at least pour it out of the bowl, but then it was too sweet.  Horrible do not bother wasting your eggs !!

I would give the recipe as written zero stars, as it is both incomplete and contains too much coconut flour. Cut the coconut flour quantity in half, add 1/4 cup of heavy cream and a teaspoon of baking powder. Also, separate the egg whites and fold them into the batter at the end. These changes will give you an actual pancake batter and more delicious results.

I had to give this recipe a 5 star because of what it is.....a low carb recipe!   When you are on the low carb diet it is so hard to find something like this, sure, it is not like regular pancakes but when your desperate for something that resembles pancakes this fits the bill nicely!  I added cream to mine.  Pretty good, I was very happy.

The pancake  batter is like dough so I added some almond milk to try to help it. Unfortunately it only made it worse.  The batter was the consistency of pudding and it broke apart in the pan. It was gritty and doughy once it made it to a plate. Next time I'll read the reviews  before  making.

As soon as one adds the coconut flour it turns into a rock hard lump of dough.  I would suggest adding a half a cup of coconut cream or regular cream or maybe even almond milk to make it a bit more runny.  Or better yet, another egg.

I fried up one pancake and even though the taste was ok the consistency was really not great.  It was very crumbly and super dry in the mouth.  Definitely did not look like the image attached to this recipe.

It's going to take more than a teaspoon of Stevia and a little vanilla to make these edible. The batter is really thick, pancakes come out mealy and bland, and needed shaping with my hands before going into the pan. Any suggestions for improvement would be welcome.

It came out more like a paste and was not pourable. Next time I make it, I'll try less coconut flour. But the taste was great

It came out like dough, not batter. Obviously milk/cream was the missing ingredient. I added almond milk. Didn’t care for the texture. Will try heavy almond milk cream next time.

Something seems to be missing, like milk.  I made this just like it say, but the batter was much too dry and thick, even with a little water added. Tasty, though! Just too dry and not batter-like.

I think this recipe is missing the liquid ingredient - 1/4 cup heavy cream.  Add this and another egg (3 total) and it should turn out fine.  I've made this several times using a different recipe, which includes the liquid.  Almond (or even regular) milk will also work.

So I followed the recipe exactly but it was really thick so I added water to get a pancake batter consistency. Needed to add a lot of water for smoothness. Not sure I’d use this recipe again

I followed the recipe exactly did not make any changes even though I thought it was strange using two eggs and only a quarter cup of the flour...  it was flat looked more like Crepes and tasted awful.
So I redid the recipe with 2 cups of flour and added cinnamon.  They were amazing !!

After being on the ketogenic diet for2 months I decided to try the coconut flour pancakes. I added water not milk to the very thick mix , which thinned it out, making it the consistency of a cornmeal or buckwheat pancake.  To me it was like eating an Almond Joy without the chocolate on it.  I used Splenda rather than the Stevia. Not bad. I also cooked them on my griddle with butter not the coconut oil. That maybe why the others were too sweet.

Very disappointed with this recipe. It is more dough than batter. I too feel I wasted my eggs.  It fell apart when I put the dough in the pan and burned even though on low heat. This is after I tried with medium heat and it burned. Have given up on coconut flour pancakes for now..

Read the poor reviews and decided to try anyway.  I used honey instead of stevia. It was a little more like a paste than a batter.  Tasted pretty good. A bit dry.  Will add a bit  more coconut oil to the mix next time.  Also I used a little reg. pancake syrup and added sliced banana on top.

I read the reviews and should have used less coconut flour.  I added 3/4 cup low fat coconut milk, 1 egg, 1 tbsp coconut oil, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 packet of stevia.  The batter looked like the consistency of cookie dough.  It didn't form into pancakes and ended up being crumbly.  Despite the looks of it, it still tasted good.  BUT, I probably will try a different recipe next time.
