I dont know what other people may have done wrong but you could taste both the chocolate and the peanut butter. I used a graham cracker crust and it was perfect. I also used a sugar free chocolate pudding mix and I made my own whipped cream because the already made stuff is nasty. I topped it with Newman O's and chopped up peanut butter cups. It was very light and not too heavy which I was very pleased with. I will be making this again very soon!!

Quick and Easy! Almost like a large Reeses cup! I modified a bit and used a regular crust, plus added chopped chocolate chip cookies for the the top.

I made this pie along with 17 others for Thanksgiving this year. It was gone in under 5 minutes. Everyone was surprised to learn how simple it was to make. Very rich! I should have made 2!

Awesome! So easy and cheap too! I used a graham cracker crust with chocolate pudding, as to be not so chocolaty. Same peanut butter, but din't top with cookies,didn't have,but was good without! Will make again thanks!

I chose to use a cook and serve chocolate pudding. I was disappointed that the chocolate flavor did not come through at all. It was just a sweet peanut butter pudding pie.

VERY EASY.  Used Peanut Butter Oreos as a garnish with an OREO crust. I only used 1 1/2 C of milk for the pudding. I think the dessert would serve easier if it is frozen until about an hour before serving.  Otherwise its kind of "loose".  I thought the layer of peanut butter was a good addition.  This isn't a gourmet pie by any means but it does deliver on taste and it is SO easy. THANKS MIKE!!

Yummy and easy! I modified this recipe to lower the fat content and not feel so guilty eating it! I used a reduced fat graham cracker crust, fat free jello chocolate pudding, and fat free cool whip! Delicious!

Great Pie. Don't forget to cook the pudding mix. That step is not listed in the instructions.

This pie was a bit rich for me but the chocolate cream pie lovers in my family will definitely request it again.  Tastes like a large peanut butter cup.  I added a layer of our homemade chocolate sauce on the bottom but did not change anything else in the recipe and it was easy and turned out great, for those that love chocolate and peanut butter!

like others, I used a graham cracker crust. I used sugar free pudding and sugar free cookies. Took it to our Thanksgiving gathering. There were about 15 pies there - and this was the only one to completely disappear!! Everyone loved it. Will definately make again.

This pie is great to throw together for an impromptu dessert! It can chill while dinner is cooking.

As suggested  I also used a (large) graham cracker crust. Was very good and will make again.
Just make sure you buy "INSTANT" pudding...

So easy and so yummy! I used a graham cracker crust, and mixed 1/2 tub of cool whip in with the pudding. I poured it over the peanut butter and chilled in freezer. Took it out and topped the pie off with some more cool whip. I finished off the pie with chopped up peanut butter cups. Took this as a dessert to my daughters house. What a hit!!!

Very easy to prepare! Made it for my husbands birthday because chocolate peanut butter is his favorite.  He loved it!  Will have to make again.  Very rich and great flavor.
