Excellent flavor!  I tripled the recipe and used only pecan halves.  I also added the salt in with the other spices and omitted the raisins.  Baking time ended up being approximately 40 minutes to achieve a crunchy texture.

These are very good.  I would cut back a bit on the cooking time, they tasted like the sugar burned slightly.  I added dried cranberries instead of raisins.

I absolutely loved this recipe. Very easy and nutritious. I have made this on several occasions for the holidays. It also makes the house smell wonderful as they bake.

Delicious! I would recommend adding a dash of vanilla extract to your egg whites. Also, don't bake them too long, because they'll get a funny burnt taste!

Did not add raisins, but otherwise kept with recipe. It was delicious! All my friends and family hope to see it again from my kitchen.  I will definitely use this again.

Maybe it's just me, but I was not impressed with the taste of these nuts at all.  No burst of flavor. Just  cinnamon and sugar coated nuts. Did not bother with the raisins. Just OK if you're looking for flavored nuts.

I doubled the recipe and used only walnut halves for a movie night at our neighbor's home recently.  Everyone loved them!  I didn't bring any home...

didn't care for these at all!  I'm normally a fan of spiced nuts but didn't care for the flavor of these.  Cooking time was also off.  Nuts weren't done at time stated in recipe.  I'll try another recipe.  I wouldn't use this recipe again.  Sorry!

Very easy and tasty recipe. It also makes the kitchen smell great! I didn't add raisins. A 20 minute baking time was enough to make them crispy in my oven.

These are addictive.  I used dried cranberries also.  I even messed up and put the cranberries in the oven too.  Next time I will try to do it correctly.  My husband has made me promise I will make them again next week.

My whole house smells incredible! I'm not too crazy about the cloves or raisins, but oh man these are heavenly!
