Here's how much my family liked this salad. My son didn't touch the portion on his plate until I urged him to have a bite. So he did. "Oh," he said after his first bite. "OH!" he said after his second bite. "This is really good!" he said, as he shoveled broccoli salad into his mouth. "Can I have some more?" he said. My husband ate two helpings of salad and said things like, "So is this the official Minnesota State Dish?" So yes, this is a winner. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't change a thing and let it sit overnight before serving. Recipe says 8 servings but 5 of us polished it off easily as a side dish. Delicious!

This was the first thing finished at a barbecue this weekend. I had never made a broccoli salad using anything other than raw broccoli, so I was concerned I would mess it up. It turned out perfect! I wish I had made more though, I've already been requested to make it again!

So good. We used more broccoli—about a pound and a half—and kept the rest of the ingredients the same.

I followed this to the letter and was dissapointed at the finished dish. The olives took over the taste of the dish. If you love green olives you will love this salad.

My mom makes a similar salad but does add sliced almonds. I really have to be in the mood for this one because I am not a huge fan of mayo. But I do love it on a hot summer day.

Lovely simple salad!  I omitted the olives (five children under ten years old in my home!), cooked the broccoli a bit longer by accident, and stuck the salad in pitas to make sandwiches.  It was a great warm winter dish enjoyed by all but the youngest two ages 3 and 1!!

If you love green olives, you'll like this.  Unfortunately for me, I'm not the biggest fan and the olives overpowered things for me.  My husband thought the eggs just didn't work with the rest of the ingredients and I have to agree.

I really liked this. I left out the celery seed as I didn't have any and used dried dill weed but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I will make this again as it was really tasty.

This was pretty good. It was different. I followed the recipe with the only exception of only having a white onion. If/when I make this again I will probably do less onion, it was a little overwhelming for me. However, my mom and husband liked this a lot.

Love this! My mother used to make it back in the early 80's but it was never called Minnesota anything, just Broccoli Salad. Glad to find this recipe again! I don't see the purpose of par-boiling the broccoli (we never did) so I skip that step and save myself the trouble. It's just fine if you let it sit overnight, and I don't change any ingredients. Great as is!

This was a really good! A change from the usual bacon and nut salad. It had great flavour and I did follow the rescipe. I wouldn't change anything the next time I make it.

LOVE this recipe. 

However, like most folks, I did make a few changes.
First, bacon really does make everything better.  I added an entire pound that I baked in the oven first and then chopped.
Second, I added a pound of cauliflower.  So, basically doubled the recipe.
Third, I'm more a yellow mustard potato salad kind of girl... I put in 3 serving spoons of mayo and then enough yellow mustard (prepared) to get to the right taste.  Very specific I know.  I really hope this help! ;)
I also added dill pickle relish to taste - more along the potato salad theme.  And a few stalks of small dice celery for a bit of crunch, too.

As the hubby doesn't like olives, we left those out... 
I think I would also leave out the celery seed next time as it's not very noticeable anyways... and of course, using prepared mustard, no need to add powdered.

Once  I tweaked it... LOVE it.  The recipe was the perfect spring board to more my style of salad.  I made it for Christmas and now that the holidays are over, I'm planning on making more just to have in the fridge.  YUM!

Wonderful. Omitted eggs, used black olives instead of green and  olive oil mayo to make it healthier.
