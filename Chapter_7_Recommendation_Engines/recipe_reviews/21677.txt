I love this cake - the only adjustment my family makes is the topping which is 1/4 c flour, 1/4 sugar 1 tbs cinnamon and 2 tbs butter softened - mis till crumbly then put on top of cake then add chips and walnuts!  Great for a party and if you feel adventurous you can make it in a bundt pan and just reverse the order of the layer!

This is a wonderful cake.   Try it reheated and topped with icecream for a real treat.   I also add 2 Tbls. of dark rum to the liquid and dates, but allow the cake to sit a couple of days to ripen.  Thanks.

this cake has great textures and with the dates and nuts is fairly good for you, too.
The topping is crunchy, the middle is smooth and the bottom for mine was slightly chewy.  It looks nice, too, without alot of work.

Too much sugar for the topping, otherwise it tasted good.

I love this recipe, it reminds me of my mom as she use to make this when my sister and I were growing up. She would always add way more chocolate chips!
I only altered it slightly by using only 3/4 cups sugar in the cake and no sugar on top.
Easy and good ;-)

My family has been making this cake for about 50 years with rave reviews!  My husband always made one to take to work for office parties and told everyone the recipe was a family secret.  We never varied the recipe but the other suggestions of adding cinnamon or rum would be excellent!  I'll definitely try the muffin version since most of the time it's just two of us and I can freeze the rest.

This is an amazing cake.  It's not terribly pretty on the plate, but you can cover up a lot of imperfections with Cool Whip or vanilla ice cream.  I'm lazy so I always buy the dates already chopped up.  I view it as a somewhat healthy dessert because of the dates, but deep down I know better.  It actually gets better over time.

I really enjoyed.  Followed recipe exactly.  It was sweet, but I like sweet things.  Tasted good both warm and room temp.

Cake was certainly moist and a variation on standard chocolate cake but it didn't quite pack the flavour in for the calories it most likely has.  Wouldn't recommend for a special occassion but good for lunchbox treat.

I have had a version of the recipe since 1960. Was given to me by my mother-in-law.  
have never had a (flop).  In our family this cake will always be Grandmother Zeman's Chocolate Chip-Date Cake and it's still my favorite.  :)
