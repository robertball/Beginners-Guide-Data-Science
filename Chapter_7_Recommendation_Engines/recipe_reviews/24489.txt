This is the best way to make this classic drink at home. The orange juice makes all the difference--it transforms an average drink to a delicious beverage! Also, don't be afraid to follow the recipe loosely. Even if you approximate the measurements, it's so fool-proof that it always turns out beautifully.

well, after reading the great reviews, I hate to leave a not so great one, however, we just thought this tasted like fizzy oj... I might decrease the amount of oj next time and see if that makes it better.  It was refreshing and pretty, just not anything too spectacular.** UPDATE- Okay, we tried them again, and this time I only used 1/4 cup orange juice, used about 3/4 cup sprite and 2 TBSP grenadine... MUCH BETTER this time!!!

Good, but it was more of a low-budget restaurant version of a shirley temple. I added a bit (1/4 cup) of not-from-concentrate orange juice and it was much better. Still worth making, though! :)

It was a good drink, but I have had much better. Preferred it with no orange juice.

Five stars for being pretty and for being fun to make and drink.  However, the drink itself is not that special.  I agree with another reviewer who said this tasted like fizzy orange juice and, while that's delicious and refreshing, it still was just fizzy orange juice. If I had the option I'd rate this 4-1/2 stars. I could see how a child would get a real kick out of this!

Hey wow this tastes so good! I made a few servings and served it to a bunch of friends at a get together we hosted. Everyone loved the drink! I said I found it here and they all said "Let me see the recipe! I want to try!" Anyways Shirley temples are now my favorite drink in the world! I am so glad I found this one because it tastes mighty good.

I had all of the ingredients to make this so I whipped one up. It was great without stirring the grenadine in, since you drank everything at once. It was very easy and probably took me about two minutes to prepare. A wonderful variation off of the original recipe.

Not as good as at the restaurant, but still very tasty. I thought there was WAY too much orange juice. Instead, I used 1/4 orange juice, 1/2 cup SPRITZ UP, 2 tbsp grenadine syrup. Much better this way.

This was great - it took me back to when I had dinner out with my grandparents when I was a kid. It was pretty close to what I remembered. I had a jar of maraschino cherries to polish off, so I made a bunch of these. I'd never used grenadine syrup before, but I found out where to get some.
I did make this exactly as written, and mentioning the straw was a nice touch - it's perfect for trying to "spear" the cherry at the bottom of the drink when you're done - another fun thing I remember from my childhood. One important omission, though - this should be served in a glass filled with ice; an iceless version is not the same.
Also, fresh "lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage" is a must too - as it goes "flat", the drink loses some of its original appeal.

Since I didn't have any grenadine syrup, I used cranberry juice as a substitute. I poured the sprite and orange juice together, and then froze it. Once it froze, I poured cranberry juice to the rim of the glass and then froze it again, topping it with a cherry. Only a thin layer of the top froze, so it became slushy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

When I was a kid, stationed in Argentia, Newfoundland, they served us Shirley Temple's with ginger-ale, what a neat twist this gave. My kids raved and raved how zippy the orange juice was in this drink....they gave all high 5's. Thanks!

A great drink, with or without the OJ!  I also use ginger ale sometimes.  This is a quick and easy way to make something a little more special than plain soda.

Had this as the non-alcoholic option for a game night this past Saturday and it was a big hit - it's also very pretty with the seperation of color before you mix it. I had a sip and thought it was very good, but than stuck to the Sangria Sangria recipe from this site!

I made this as a drink for our grandchildren to join us  at  cocktail time.  I didn't have lemon lime soda, so use ginger ale instead.  At first my grandson said he didn't want one, but when he saw how fancy his sister's drink was, he wanted one too.  They both loved it, and thought it looked very special.  They both rated it as a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

Exactly what I remember as a child! I used half a cup of orange juice, 2\3 of 7up, about 3\4 ounce of grenadine, 1 ounce vodka and it came out perfect! To get the grenadine to pool on the bottom tip the cup slightly as you pour from the edge like you would to reduce head on a beer. Love it thank you for this recipe!

A very pretty, layered mocktail for those who don't drink alcohol.

This was perfect to make for my kids for New Year's Eve to get to celebrate. So pretty. I have 1 child that doesn't like carbonation so I just added some pineapple juice instead of the 7 Up. Very festive!

I served this at a Mother's Day brunch I prepared.  Everyone really liked them.  They had a nice sweet taste, and went very well with the mostly breakfast food.  I even made a spiked one for my boyfriend with vodka-that turned out okay, but the virgin kind is definitely the way to go.
