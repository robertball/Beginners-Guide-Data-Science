I did not use linguine in this dish. Because I wanted to eat this dish with my kids, I used one package of tofu shirataki pasta (low carb "pasta", recommended by Hungry Girl). I also tossed in a teaspoon of homemade italian seasoning and a little more salt/pepper when I mixed the ingredients together. I'm glad I added the italian seasoning, I think it would have been pretty bland without it. My kids seemed to enjoy it, my oldest child asked for seconds and I was happy I could enjoy dinner with my family and not worry about carb count as much. I'll make this again.

This dish was AMAZING!! The juices that cook off all your veggies are what makes up the sauce.. It turned out so good. My husband wasn't too keen on the meal as soon as he saw the zucchini and grape tomatoes... but ended up loving it.

This was DELICIOUS!  I added 1 summer squash and used sweet apple chicken sausage. I omitted the pasta and added sliced sweet potato for more nutritional value without losing the heft. I roasted the potatoes separately and found that the main mixture still needed much longer than 30 minutes to get a good roasted flavor; around 50 min.  I would describe this as clean and healthy. A keeper for sure!

This recipe was very flavorful and super easy to make! I did make a few changes. I added a yellow  pepper and an extra zucchini. Also added a clove of garlic and fresh parsley to the vegetable mixture. I also used 1 1/4 cups of fresh grated parmesean cheese mixed in when everything finished. No offense to Johnsonville, but I used all natural, organic chicken sausage with garlic and gruyere cheese. Delicious! Will definately make this again!

This was an extremely tasty dish, and my husband loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the type of sausage was a perfect fit, which nicely complimented the roasted vegetables.  I intentionally bought a yellow pepper for the added color, since the red and green were brought out by the tomatoes and zucchini.  We will definitely make this again.

This was crazy good! Great way to eat your veggies.  The only changes I made were adding more seasonings (1 teaspoon each: Basil, Oregano, Minced Garlic) and I instead used Whole Grain Rotini. Sprinkled some shaved parmesean after it was cooked..yum! Had the leftovers for lunch today, and they heated up nicely! Will definatley add this to my dinner rotation.

This was really easy and very flavorful.  I changed a few things simply because of what I had on hand. I used  smoked sausage, instead of the chicken sausage, and reduced the olive oil to 2T.  I also used penne pasta.

This dish is the absolute best.  I needed something that wouldn't take long to fix after work.  This was easy and has wonderful flavor and colors with all the veggies.  This recipie is perfect also because it is so versatile.  You can change it up, add different seasonings, veggies, meat. I have made it twice and my store didn't have the chicken sausage so I used the jalepeno cheddar brats one time and the lil beef smokies the next and I put the meat on it sooner so the flavor would soak in.  I had also added a couple of dashes of balsemic vinagar. It was awesome. This is a perfect year round meal because in the summer I can see making it without the meat with a little extra seasoning, tossing with the pasta and refridgerate and the next day adding grilled chicken or shrimp for a cool dinner on a hot day.  GREAT!!!!

Awesome recipe!  The sausage has so much flavor and then all the veggies with it, yummy! I did use corn (gluten free) pasta.  Will be making this a regular dish in our home as long as they keep making that chicken sausage!

Hubby thought it smelled good while cooking, but turned his nose up at the sight - however(!) it was wonderful and he's ready to have it again soon. I did add creole seasoning, shots of balsamic vinegar and hot sauce, and used cheddar/jalapeno sausage along with about 1/4 cup of white wine. I'm only sorry I didn't serve it in bowls to sop up the juices. Typically I don't try recipes from the main products, but am so glad I gave this a try. AND, to top it off - it's quick and easy!! Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good.  We used italian chicken instead of the sausage.  Seemed like a nice healthy light meal, not our usual meat and potatoes.  We love meat and potatoes, but this was good for an alternative.

The sausage was very good! The veggies added a lot of flavor but it wasnt enough for me, next time i will add some type of sauce because it was a little bland and i will change the pasta to penne. But i enjoyed it and will make again with some garlic bread!

This dish is divine.  The roasted veggies totally make it...they are yummy.  Made a few minor changes; didn't use zuchini but threw in some brocolli & a few cloves of garlic.  Loved it!

This dish was fantastic!  The store was out of the Johnsonville sausage so I used an organic brand instead.  The only thing I added was some feta cheese once it was fully cooked.  Easy to make, feeds a lot:)  I will make this again!

I didn't give this 5 stars because I like my pasta dishes with a little more sauce in them. But I really enjoyed the vegtables in this dish. I followed the recommendations of others and I added one clove garlic, fresh parsley, and a little more salt and pepper. I think I would have rated this with fewer stars without the extra flavor. I also used roasted pepper and asiago chicken sausage. very yummy and refreshing..

This was delicious and so easy to prepare.  I served it over whole wheat linguine and even my picky husband enjoyed it.  The chicken sausage was tasty but I may make this again without any meat at all.

I really love this recipe! I use different veggies because I don't like mushrooms or peppers. My favorites are yellow squash, zucchini, & eggplant. Also, I just rough chop a big tomato instead of using grape tomatoes, and it works great! I actually get some tomato juice from them, which helps create some sauce for the pasta. My husband doesn't like vegetables, so I just use the pasta and sausage and add some marinara sauce for him. Today I'm going to try it with a potato and leave out the pasta. And I'm going to puree some of the veggies to add to hubby's marinara. 
This chicken sausage is great, but you can also sub any other hard sausage in a pinch (sorry, Johnsonville). Sprinkle a bit of parmesan on top either way, though.

Amazing taste from such a simple dish that I didn't expect too much from. What a pleasant surprise this was! My husband isn't a big eater and rarely goes back for seconds. Not only did he get a second helping but two hours after dinner he went back for 3rds!
