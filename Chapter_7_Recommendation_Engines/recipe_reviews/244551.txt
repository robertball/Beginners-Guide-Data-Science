This is the first recipe I tried when I began making dolmas, and it was such a good one that it has remained the only recipe I've used since. I double the ingredients so there is enough filling for the entire jar of grape leaves. What I do differently from the recipe is I finely chop some onion and saute it in olive oil along with the rice before adding it to filling ingredients. I've found this reduces the cooking time needed for the rice. I consider this my definite go-to recipe for anytime I'm planning to make dolmas.

Wonderful receipt... doubled the amount of rice and only used half of the grape leaves in the 16oz container... I could not stop my self eating. I would recommend it again and again.

This is my new "GO TO" for lamb and rice stuffed grape leaves.
I've been making stuffed grape leaves for 50 years.  Being a young bride, who was learning to cook, a lovely Lebanese lady shared her recipe and taught me to make them. Never thought of adding currants or cinnamon....yummy addition.

Delicious! I did not use the currants, but kept to the recipe otherwise. Really nice flavors! I am no stranger to making/eating grape leaves and these were some of the best, BUT not better than my mom's, lol. Thanks for another great recipe, Chef! :)

hands down the best stuffed grape leaves! it was hard to find a recipe that used lamb and an authentic spice mix. these were spot on! the only thing I would say is double the stuffing because you'll have plenty of grape leaves in a jar.

Excellent start for this standard recipe and thanks to Chef John.  I added one onion and a couple of garlic cloves. Also added some dill. Could not find currants but will next time. Seems like there is so much flexibility with this because of the multitude of flavors which are endless. Also did not use olive oil because of previous comments from others about the fat from the lamb and they were correct.  

I need to add a little more time to creating the sauce that goes on this. Traditional sauce is an egg, lemon and broth juice which is whipped and spread over all.

Wow they were really good!  I did a couple changes, tho.  Since I had to grind the meat off some lamb chops for the ground lamb, I added in 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 of a small onion, and 1/2 of a preserved lemon and ground them together.  The lamb meat I used was fatty so I left out the olive oil.  I had to cook them for 2 hours.

Good but I didn't necessarily like it more than the vegetarian dolmas.

It was great! My middle eastern husband loved it! Didn’t have pine nuts or currants. Precooked the rice a bit and the meat a bit too. Doubled recipe. Had extra and not enough grape leaves ( was using the rest that we had) so stuffed gutted tomatoes and pepper. Cooked it for 45 minutes on low, as directed. About the grape leaves: I rinsed them but soaked them in a sieve with water in pan for a couple hours to get rid of the sour taste. I wasn’t in a hurry and this took me about 2 hours but it was my first time. They taste awesome! So proud!

This is a wonderful and flavorful recipe! MashaAllah! I did not have lamb and used halal beef instead. I also used Black Rice instead of processed white rice. It was great! MashaAllah!  I will make sure to make a double batch in the future. InshaAllah

Yes, they are a bit labor-intensive, but cooking is a "labor of love" after all. Worth every minute. Even better w/o the meat.

I usually have dolmas with just rice, and they are pretty okay. But with lamb? Unbelieveable. So delicious, can't wait for someone to make them for me again!

These are absolutely delicious! I normally don't like dolmas, but these had so much flavor. Love the tangy lemon, spices and lamb filling.

Chef John's right about the time factor--these do take a while to roll up. But the lemon and lamb really take these to a whole new level. Brought them to a work event and people  really loved them. I'm reserving the broth for another use---too good to toss!
