I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I forgot the cinnamon.  Didn't matter because it was just pure fruit flavor goodness, not overly sweet!  Not only is it delicious, but it takes no time at all to get this into the oven.  Teresa, we enjoyed your blueberry crisp!

Made this last night for a family dinner.  Everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe but found that, after cooking for about 20 minutes,  the topping was too dry so I drizzled about three tablespoons of melted butter over the top.  It came out perfect. Will definitely make this again and again!

Delicious!  I was cleaning out my freezer and found a bag of blueberries that we had picked.  They needed to be used up so I found this recipe.  It is easy to make and tastes great.  We had vanilla ice cream with it, which is necessary in my opinion, as this is very sweet and the ice cream helps cut that sweetness a bit.  I'll make this again, and maybe will even try it with blackberries or cherries.

8-24-2018 ~Given the limitations I had to work around when making this, I can still say I couldn’t have asked for a better result.  First, I scaled this down to one serving which could almost guarantee an iffy result.  I had no tapioca here at our place in Naples, so I substituted cornstarch with a guess.  I had no orange juice and wasn’t comfortable using lemon, fearing it would negatively affect the sweetness factor as well as camouflaging the pure blueberry flavor I desired.  I used water instead, as well as omitting the cinnamon altogether for the same reason.  Finally, I was using a new convection toaster oven here for the first time and was uncertain how to adjust the time.  Twenty minutes proved to be perfect, and even at that I found I had to cover the crisp with foil toward the end of the cooking time to prevent it from overbrowning.  The result was perfect – neither too dry nor too juicy, just right, and with the perfect level of sweetness.  Hubs said to mention that he had nothing to say while he was eating it which meant he was totally enjoying the experience.  For myself, I really appreciated a crisp with no oats.  This was just darned good as well as darned quick and easy.

I had 1-1/2 cups of bluberries to use up, so I scaled this recipe down to 2 servings. Both mixtures were enough to fill 4 small ramekins. I baked them for exactly 30 minutes, and they were perfect. They did sink in the ramekins quite a bit, but still turned out tasty. This came together quickly, and was a great way to use of those berries! Thanks for the recipe.

I subtracted the white sugar so they wouldn’t be too sweet the second batch around. It was perfect. I used paleo flour instead.

I scaled this down to 2 servings but increased the blueberries to  2 cups. The blueberries were frozen, and I let them sit out a bit while I did other prepping. I didn't want to open a new box of tapioca for 1 1/2 tsp, so I looked and found that corn starch or flour could sub. I baked this in a 1.5 qt baking dish, and it was a lot more blueberries than topping. Nice change from using oats. Had warm with whipped cream, but will do with vanilla ice cream. Thanks, Teresa, for this easy and delicious recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Perfect served warm with a dollop of vanilla ice cream! I took other rater's advice and poured additional 3 tbsp. of butter over crust when baking as it did look dry.
