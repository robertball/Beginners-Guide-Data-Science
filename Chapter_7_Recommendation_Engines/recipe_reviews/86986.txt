This was a fantastic recipe. The flavors, the colors, everything was great. I skimped on the feta (only used about 2 ounces) and the oil to cut down the fat. It still turned out great. This would be really nice with real tomatoes, too.

Holy Cow!   This recipe made me a believer in black eyed peas!   I made pretty much as called for in the recipie except for a previous reviewer suggestion to use a balsamic vinegar reduction -- to do this, I took a mid-quality balsamic and boiled it down to about 1/3 its original volume, and used the recipie amount of the concentrate.
My New Year's Eve party guests LOVED the flavors - we used it as a dip with some very crisp rice crackers.

I had a package of steamed black-eyed peas that I didn't know what to do with, so I gave this recipe a try. It was delicious! I cut the recipe in half since I'm single, but I still used 1/2 an onion as 1/4 of an onion just wasn't enough. All the other ingredients I just cut in half. I also used oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, so I drained and chopped them without pouring the boiling water, since they were already quite soft. I used fat-free feta cheese to cut the calories a bit. Altogether this was a fantastic high-protein and very nutritious salad. Would be great for a light lunch or supper in the summertime, and for potlucks, especially if there are vegetarians. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Totally great recipe.  This is the first one I've tried on this site that I didn't tweak, I made it exactly as written.  It was really yummy!!  I would suggest to everyone to do it the night before you are serving it because the flavors really come together overnight.  Thanks for submitting this!

Easy way for Black-Eye Pea Salad is to just get you a jar of salsa and mix to your own consistency and let sit in refrigerator for 2 hours.

I love beans of any kind, but my family doesn't like them.  I am always looking for ways to prepare beans that are simple and quick to prepare and easy to scale down to a serving or two.  This fit the bill.  I had to make a couple of substitutions as I made this spur of the moment and did not have a couple of the ingredients on hand...It was still yummy (I'm sure I would like it better as written:)  I halved the recipe and used 1/2 can diced tomatoes instead of sun-dried because that is what I had.  I used white onion instead of red and I had no feta so I substituted an Italian cheese blend.  I ate this for lunch today with some rye crackers-Yummy and Filling.  I cannot wait to go to the store and get some sun-dried tomatoes and feta (both which I LOVE) and try this again!!!  Thanks for lunch:)

This is SUPER delicious!!!  I made this to go with our family New Year's Day brunch, and everyone was raving about it.  I did have to make a few substitutions (out of necessity, not by choice), and it still turned out fantastic!  I only had about half the sundried tomatoes the recipe calls for, I left out the bell pepper (a lot of relatives that HATE them), and I had to sub goat cheese for the feta because the store was out.  I also used fresh beans that I soaked overnight, then simmered to al dente, and sprinkled with a liberal amount of kosher salt.  Still, the final result was out of this world!!  I would love to try it again with the feta and bells, but I can honestly say, this recipe is deserving of its 5 stars and I will most defiitely be making it again...often.

This recipe is both excellent and easy to make! I used crumbled goat cheese i/o feta, and it turned out great.  The spiciness of the red onion and green pepper is balanced by the hint of honey. This is a keeper in my recipe file.

Maybe it's the black-eyed pea taste itself, but we didn't care for this at all -- less so the next day. Too vinegar/sharp tasting. This is definitely not one of those recipes saved to my list of "greats" that I'd like to make regularly.

Absolutely delicious. I upped the vinegar and dijon and decreased the olive oil. Fabulous.

I really enjoyed this...made it in advance and had it for dinner. I did use sun-dried tomatoes from a jar and did not have to rehydrate them.

Delicious, couldn't keep it away from my coworkers.  Used a jar of sun dried tomatoes in olive oil and used the olive oil in the jar.  Next time I would try to cut the sun dried tomatoes more.

Sounds like good salad! They do many similar salads like this in the Mediterranean, using white beans, pinto beans, black-eyed peas and even mung beans, almost the same as this but minus the cheese and usually fresh instead of dried tomato. But why not both... (The mung bean one is also really nicece, give it a try; you can substitute lemon juice for the vinegar too.)

I'm glad I did not rate this the same day I made it because I honestly wasn't impressed.  Having let it sit in the fridge for a couple of days, I forgot I even made it.  Just tasted it again and what a difference! Good mixing of flavors and I'm adding to my vegetarian lunch menus.

What a nice surprise!  It was one of those last minute cookouts when I went through my pantry and found all I had was a couple cans of black-eyed peas. Found this recipe and it was an absolute hit! A real keeper.  Everyone loved it...even those that don't like black-eyed peas.

I can't believe how good this was.  I am not a fan of the traditional black eyed pea, so this recipe appealed to me.  I honestly thought it would be one of those items that sits on the table out of obligation (New Year's Day), but it literally was inhaled by everyone.  I loved it.  I improvised the dressing because I had a balsamic dressing on hand, but I did add the dijon and the honey.  I made it a day ahead and refrigerated it overnight and it was wonderful. It got rave reviews from everyone.

Both myself and my husband, who is not a big veggie eater, loved this recipe! I had some extra fresh basil on hand that I tossed in, and it added a really nice flavor. I also made the following substitutions, based on what I had in my pantry: canned tomatoes for sun dried and agave nectar for honey.

I just finished making this and it already tastes amazing. I would make this again and again. Super easy and quick. No trouble at all. I used dried peas and soaked them over night, cooked them for an hour on the stove the next day until they were real tender and then soaked them in cold water to cool them off for the salad. Worked like a charm. The rest is in the recipe.

This was great. Light and refreshing if eaten immediately. More depth and richness if left to marinade.

I used Gulden's mustard (because I love it!), spring onions (since they were growing in my garden and it's spring!), and a red sweet pepper for great color and taste. I didn't have feta, but I don't think it is missing it. 

I agree that it would be even richer with a reduced balsamic. I could see this also being tasty with some chopped basil, or a little oregano. The spring onion was nice for a crisp, light taste, but I think the red onion would be even better for a more complex taste.

I could see myself making this salad a couple times a year.

Made for a New Year's bowl party in which I was going for a "lucky food" theme.  Used jarred sundried tomatoes and refrigerated overnight.  Followed another's suggestion and used a (3:1) balsamic reduction.  The dish was well-received, however I thought the reduction made it a little too hearty.  The flavors were good, and it was certainly easy to make!  Would make again.  Next time, if in winter, I'll use a 2:1 reduction.  In summer when you're looking for light and refreshing, I'd recommend following the recipe re the balsamic.

Ohhhh...this was very good and very refreshing.  I think I prefer eating black eye peas this way than the traditional way.  The sun dried tomotoes really set it off.

I did not care for this at all.  The flavors didn't work well together for me.  I didn't serve this.

I was excited to find this recipe because I love black eyed peas. It turned out great. I made a couple of substitutions though because I’m no fan of either sun dried tomatoes nor mustard. I used a tablespoon of mayonnaise in place of the latter and diced pimento stuffed green olives for the former (although black olives would probably do just as well if not better). Great one.  Thanks for sharing.

What a great blend of flavors!  Easy and tasty!  I followed the recipe used onion powder instead of red.  Excellent and was a big hit!   Thanks

Great recipe even the kids liked it. However I made a couple of changes. I used fresh tomatoes, half the honey, and 2 minced cloves of garlic. Didn't use feta as didn't have it in so made up some bacon bits. YUM

This recipe was so easy and everyone loved it - especially on day 2 after it had a chance to really marinate.  I did use basil olive oil and celery instead of peppers - just what I had on hand. Since we're Greek, I skipped the feta (we have that on every salad)but I'll definitely include it if I take this to an office or neighborhood gathering.  I was thinking of adding bacon next time - anyone tried that?

Didn't have all the right ingreds. so I did what I could. Instead of black-eyed peas I used black beans - used Rotel instead of the sun-dried tomatoes and skipped the feta accidentally so I threw on some Parmesan. I also sauteed up a few cut up chicken breasts and threw in some brown rice.  I thank you for the general idea - the dressing was fab. and we LOVED the salad I ended up with. I was going between this recipe and a salad I just had at The Cheesecake Factory. I think it ended up just as good!  Totally appreciative!!

This is such a great recipe!  I use fresh tomatoes, also drained whole kernal corn.  Chopped fresh jalapeno adds flavor too.  You can use Italian dressing if that sounds better to you.  Easy recipe to customize and perfect if black eyed peas aren't your favorites. I think  almost any fresh veggies would work in it.  Make a day or two in advance if possible.

Great!  I use a this recipe as a New Year's salsa type dip to serve for good luck.  I use Frito Scoops and everyone seems to love it - and it brings plenty of good luck and good health in the New Year!

Great recipe!  I don't eat onions (heartburn), so I added red peppers to make it colorful.
