This was wonderful.  I did make some changes...left out pimiento, g pepper and mushrooms and I doubled the shallots.  Also, recipe doesn't say when to add mayo, but I stirred it in at the end. My whole family loved it.  Will definitely make this again

This was a huge success when I made it for dinner guests recently!  It was rich and creamy, and had just the right amount of seasonings that didn't overwhelm the taste of the crab meat.  The only changes I made is I didn't use the mushrooms (I never had crab imperial with mushrooms, and my guests don't like them), and I used red bell pepper instead of the green as my guests don't like them either.  I used it to stuff lobster tails with, adding the crab half way through the cooking (at 350 degrees), then stuck them under the broiler just long enough to get them golden and bubbly.  They're still talking about it.

This was excellent!  It tasted like something you would get at a resturant.  I am from Maryland and have grown up on Good Maryland crabs.  This recipe won't let you down.  Will definitly make again!  I used jumbo lump crab meat and would highly recomend to use only the best!  My husband Loved it!

I live in Virginia where blue crab is a standard. I was very disappointed in this recipe. How you can have Crab Imperial without butter is beyond me, so I added butter. But really I think there are probably much better recipes out there. Crab is delicate and delicous without all the mushrooms, green pepper, etc. I would have liked a little garlic also. Don't waste a good pound of crab on this...

I found cooking the sherry almost dry and using only 1/2 cup of mayonnaise produced an excellant product. Put under the broiler for a minute to brown nicely.

Substituted minced celery for green peppers, omitted the mushrooms and doubled the shallots. I could not find gruyere cheese in the grocery store so I just used deli swiss. This was very good only next time I will use less sherry.

Perfect a special holiday menu, such as Christmas. I minimized the green pepper. Added minced celery, a dash of worceshire sauce, and a smidgen Old Bay seasoning. They're still talking about it...

This is excellent!  Didn't add the mushrooms and only a little bit of green pepper.  It was a little runny so next time I will reduce the sherry so there is hardly any left at all.  Also didn't have gruyere cheese so had to use sharp/monterey jack mixture.  Next time will use the gruyere cause I'm sure it will be so much better.

It was good but we didn't get shallots. The store clerk gave us the wrong thing [green onions], but otherwise it was good.

I followed the recipe and the crab turned out wonderful.  We ate it as its own dish but want to try it over a baked potato the next time because it is so rich.

This is exceptional! Used some for stuffed flounder, and the rest in a casserole dish for another night. Thanks for the recipe.
