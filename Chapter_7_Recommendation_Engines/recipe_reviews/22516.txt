I loved this bread. I made a few changes that perhaps made it better.

Instead of the oil and the butter, I used 1/2 C of sour cream, and 1/4 C of milk. Instead of the 1 1/2 C of sugar (too sweet for my taste), I cut calories by using 1/3 C honey, and 2/3 C splenda gradular (or 18 packets of sugar substite). I didn't add in any raisins, coconuts, or walnuts (my boyfriend dislikes all of them), but added one chopped nectarine with the mango (I used 2 mangoes, a little over 3 cups). Instead of the cinnamon, I decided to try using ginger (1 teaspoon)--and it turned out great! Finally, I used 6 texas-sized muffin tins instead of the loaves--they were ready in 30 minutes. For about 300 calories per 6 oz muffin (with the changes), this was amazing...

For those whose bread did not rise: This uses baking soda exclusively, which requires an acid ingrediant to "activiate" it. Try using buttermilk or yogurt for some of the butter or oil, or add a teaspoon of lemon juice. I used sour cream--same idea. I had no problem with having this rise.

Or, try using baking powder for some of the baking soda (I used 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda)

It always amazes me that people on this site change the stated recipes all around and then have the audacity to rate it low! Something I'll never understand. Anyhow, tried the recipe as is with chopping the mangos and didn't care for the texture, so I made it again and put them in the food processor and it was great. Also, the second time I made it, I baked it at 325 degrees since it is so moist and needs time to cook from the inside out. Thanks for a workable recipe!

This has the bones of a fantastic recipe, but having actually tried it in its original form, I agree with the other reviewers about modifications being necessary for the bread to cook through properly and rise. Like some other reviewers, instead of just using the 2 tsp of baking soda called for, I used 3tsp baking soda, 1tsp baking powder, and 1tsp fresh lemon juice to get this bread to rise (otherwise it really doesn't!). Also, I baked at 325 degrees for about 50 minutes with both loaves in the oven at once -- cooked through perfectly.  Like others, I pureed the mango and because I used sweetened coconut, I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups so the flavor of the mango has a little more chance to shine.  Excellent quick bread.

This was really delicious.  When I tried it the day I made it, it was just okay.  The taste was good, but there was very little mango flavor.  After being in the fridge for a few days, it was delicious.  It needs a couple of days for the flavors to come together.  One thing I noticed is that it didn't rise very much, and the mangos settled to the bottom of the bread.  What I'll do next time is chop the mangoes into smaller pieces and mix the mangoes with a little flour before I mix them into the batter.  Regarding the rising, I read in another review that this is the way it is.  This is a great way to use mangoes.

This bread is great because it is extremely moist and filled with a range of textures.  However, if you really want a strong mango flavor, be sure to use VERY ripe mangos. I brought this bread to the office and the whole loaf was gone in less than two hours!

This is one of the best sweet breads I have ever had.  It is a great way of using mangoes.  This was the first time I have made it and the only change I would make is to use less sugar.  I did not have butter and used margarine for recipe and pam to grease the pan.

Very good.  I omited the raisins, and pureed the mango.  It reminds me a little of carrot bread with the coconut as texture.

I have never used mango's before but this recipe turned out great tasting. It didn't rise very much but the taste was awesome. I took it to work and everyone loved it, even the people who said "I really don't like mango's" I made them try it and they said wow it tastes great!

I tried this in my bread machine which was unsuccessful.  I had to place the pan in the oven to finish baking.  Even with this minor delay,  it turned out great.  Even my husband who doesn't like mangoes asked for seconds.  I substituted chopped dates for raisins and doubled the coconut while omitting the nuts.  Definitely give it a try.

Delicious recipe, but I did make some changes that may have changed the taste.  I cut sugar down by 1/4, and sub'd 1/3 cup of oil for apple sauce.  Instead of raisins and nuts (I had none) I used 1 cup combined of chopped dried mango/apricots soaked in rum, and added 1/2 tsp of cardamon and 1/2 tsp ginger.  I messed up trying to follow other reviews and accidentally added 3 tsp baking powder/1 tsp baking soda, so cake rose very nicely, but perhaps was slightly salty (but only because I knew).  Apricots were perfect addition since they added the zip that is in fresh mangoes, but seems to be lost when it is baked.  Can't wait for next mango season to make this some more!

This is the best quick bread I have ever eaten.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated except one cup of the mango I pureed and I omitted the walnuts.  I also used Ataulfo mangoes which are sweeter, less stringy, and are currently in season.  The whole two loaves were eaten up by my husband, myself and our 1 year old in a matter of days.  It is very moist, not too sweet and really tastes nothing like mango, more like carrot cake with a tropical twist.  So yummy.  Will definetly make again and again. Update:  Made this again with regular mangoes...totally different.  Mangoes were super ripe this time but the Ataulfo ones I used before just dissolved into the bread.  I found the texture a bit too stringy this time.  I think I'll stick to Ataulfo next time. Update #2: Today I made Magic Mango Bread with some substitutions after getting some suggestions and it turned out great.  I subbed in one cup whole wheat flour and one cup AP flour instead of two cups AP flour.  Also subbed in one cup splenda and half a cup of splenda brown sugar blend instead of 1.5 cups sugar.  Better than my last batch that I made according to the recipe.  I must mention that the last batch I made I added the dry to the wet and probably over mixed in the KA... Next time I think I'll try to sub some of the oil/butter for apple sauce or sourcream.

Oh, wow!!  This is the best dessert bread I've ever had.  I'm a big peach fan and when baked, the mango really resembles baked peach.  I made a few changes: I added 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. baking soda, and 1 tsp. lemon juice.  I omitted the butter and cut the oil down to 1/4 cup and added 3/4 cup applesauce.  My husband doesn't like raisins in bread so I didn't add those.  I cut the sugar added to 3/4 cup.  I made 4 mini-loaf pans and baked for about 45 minutes.  I love this recipe and the bread is our new family favorite!

OK, so the other reviews are so good, I think maybe I did something horribly wrong.  This was not bread, but mango ooze.  Although I did not put in raisins or nuts (not fam faves), and I did add a teaspoon each of coconut and rum extracts, I don't think the added 2 teaspoons of extract accounts for the mess.  I was originally concerned that with 3 cups of mango and only 2 cups of flour it might be a little gooey, but gooey doesn't come close to what this was like.  I cooked it for 1 hour 20 minutes when I finally had to take it out because I had to leave the house.  The taste is great, but it didn't turn out like bread of any kind.

I have a friend who is gluten intolerant, so I am always looking for recipes that can be made with rice flour.  I used 1 ½ cups rice flour, ½ cup tapioca starch, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, substituted 1 cup of sour cream for the butter and omitted the coconut.  The result was wonderful.  I will definitely make this again, and will add it to my gluten-free recipes.

This tasted great though I did make some changes. The mango flavour wasn't pronounced. It is very moist and dense, definitely quite filling. It's a little different from traditional quick breads as this had a sort of bread pudding texture. Many reviewers mentioned having issues with the loaves rising; what I can say is that I used one teaspoon each baking soda, baking powder and lemon juice to try and avoid the problem. It really doesn't rise all that much, but that's fine with us. I used a teaspoon each of cinnamon and ginger. I decided to use applesauce and coconut oil to reduce fat and keep the 'tropical' theme going. Cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, and used brown sugar instead. I only had 1 1/4 cups of mango, so I used some cantaloupe and leftover fruit cocktail to make up the difference. I mashed the fruits, left them a little chunky and strained as much of the excess juices that I could squeeze out. Omitted the walnuts. As mentioned it was indeed very moist, but oh-so-flavourful! Will definitely make it again.

I made this last night and it was amazing!!! I read a lot of the reviews and took bits and piece from them. I added sour cream instead of vegetable oil and I didn't add nuts (not a fan of nuts in my sweet breads). But it lovely and moist and I will definitely be making this again. OH! And I pureed the mango before adding.

I found this recipe after a friend mentioned trying mango bread and how great it was. I thought it was ok at first but FANTASTIC the second day after the flavors had really melded together. It was so fruity and nutty, a really great bread. The mango keeps the bread moist. I put a little coconut on top which browned nicely for presentation. I will probably make this for neighbors and friends at church instead of other quick breads for Christmas this year.

Wow, this is one great quick bread! I followed the recipe exactly as I wanted a sweet bread. The only exceptions I made was using whole wheat flour. I did puree most of the mangos and chopped the rest into small bits. I also sprinkled walnuts and coconut on the top, pressing it into the batter before baking. I also added one teaspoon of fresh lemon juice as one reviewer had recommended to make it rise properly. I can see how frozen mangoes will work just as well and will continue to make this once mango season is over!

definitely worth making.  i substituted "mango sauce" (similar to applesauce - available at some grocery stores include trader jo.s) for the oil to make it low fat, and this turned out to be a very moist, fruity bread.

sooo good.  i will definitely make this again, when i have lots of mangoes that need to be eaten before they spoil!  i halved the sugar, and only used 1/4C oil and 1/4C butter, and it still turned out yummy, moist & sweet.  thank you!

Super good, but you can save yourself some money on the mangos and buy peaches.  There isn't a strong mango flavor.  I did omit the raisins (dislike), coconut & walnuts (didn't have).  I also added PB chips.  Delish!

So, I did what one of the reviewers said and increased the baking soda to 3 tsp. and added 1 tsp. of baking powder. I pureed the mango, but it ended up being a very soupy batter. I used two mangos, which, chopped made 2 cups, but pureed made 1 1/2 so I added pureed pineapple. I think if you do puree, you need to go by the chopped measurement instead of modifying it like I did. I also cooked it at 325 like one of the comments said for 1 hour and 10 min. They were browned on the outside but "jiggly". I took them out anyway hoping they would firm up as they sat. They rose in the oven then fell about 40 min. into baking time.
I think if I make this again I would increase the flour to at least 2 1/2 cups and use 2 cups pureed fruit rather than 3. My house smells wonderful though.

This was OK but the mango favor did not really come through liked I had hoped.  It reminded me a spice cake.  I may try this again with a few modifications.

Really good recipe!  I made only one loaf and used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup white sugar.  Two eggs as well, plus some ginger because I like it.  My husband can't eat nuts and my daughter won't eat raisins, so I threw in some Craisins to good effect.  My mango pieces stayed mixed throughout, perhaps because they were small.  I will make this again, for sure.

The bread was delicious!!!. I did make some changes in the recipe used 1cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour and used baking powder instead of baking soda (didnt have any). I used very ripe mangoes and the result was awesome. I also used yogurt instead of butter which made it a healthier option. It made two full loaves and 6 muffins too. Will definately make it again.

Very much a cinnamon bread! Couldn't really taste the mangos. I used my Magic Bullet to puree 3 mangos, maybe I needed more? Bread was also very dark. Thanks for letting me try something different! PS Didn't add the walnuts, raisins, or coconut to this, personal preference.

Instead of having my mangoes chopped, I pureed them in a blender. I also used 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda, and added 1 tsp lemon juice. Because I had no nuts, raisins and coconuts, omitted those. My loaves were moist and dense, but with a springiness to them. A little sweet for my taste, but absolutely delicious with a perfect texture. Will make again and again.
Thank you for posting.

I followed the advice of others who said to put 3 teas, of baking soda and 1 teasp. of b powder so the bread rises.  I must say although my bread still did not rise the bread the bread itself was great flavor and my husband loved it!  I will make this again!

I used half whole wheat and white whole wheat flour, reduced both the butter and oil to 1/4 cups and added applesauce and yogurt instead. I didn't have raisins or nuts to add. For a healthier version of this recipe,  it turned out very good. Nice change from banana bread.

I LOVED this!  I used whole wheat pastry flour, unsweetened applesauce for the fat, and cut down on the sugar because all I had on hand was sweetened coconut.  It was so moist it was like cake!

Mixed all ingredients exactly as written in recipe; baked in buttered bundt pan. Came out perfectly.  Delicious, moist.  Brought it into work and it was devoured to high praise.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I made this as written however I mashed the mangos with a fork and baked them at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.  Super moist, very delicious, very much like a buttery, slightly fruity cinnamon taste.  I know other reviewers though they did not rise enough, but I thought the texture was exactly as a quick bread should be, moist and dense.

Moist and incredibly tasty. Took a loaf to my mother-in-law's for a get-together. She bakes loaves all the time. Well, we had my loaf and her zucchini loaf out and people kept coming back to mine! I had no leftovers where she still had about 3/4 of hers. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was a tasty disaster. Full disclosure: i didn't have enough mangos and had to add a banana.Other thing I did different was to use coconut oil instead of regular oil. Also added a little bit of baking powder. Anyway, end result was tasty but crumbly and stuck to the bottom of the pan. It was good, but not great, and since it was a mess I don't think I'll make this again.

So moist and delicious!! My mom made this for us but she only used 1 cup of sugar, and it was the perfect amount of sweet. Of course the Mango we used came from our back yard and were tree ripened sweet (it makes a big difference). We are making this a regular mango season recipe!!

Delish! Smelled wonderful cooking, too. I chopped the mango into very small pieces and I like the texture that produced. Used shaved coconut, macadamia nuts in place of walnuts, and craisins in place of raisins. Next time (there will be a next time!) I'll sub in applesauce for half the fats, as the texture is greasy to the touch; maybe I'll use coconut oil for the fat, to keep the tropical flavors going. I would also use a bit less sugar, as it's quite sweet. Still, a good recipe as-is, and a great way to use up some mangoes when I've bought them in bulk!

I thought this receipt was NOT going to turn out only from my mistakes - I was having a hard time making it due to being distracted, interrupted a few times by ringing phones, doorbells and family but it turned out great!  I had prepared and measured everything in advance and when I peeled the mango I realized I didn't have enough to make 3 cups.  So I measured the ingredients I had already prepared (wet and dry) and placed half of them aside so I could make the rest tomorrow and use the mangos I had cut.  Then in my distraction I ended up putting half of the dry ingredients back in again by mistake!  So I ended up having to bake it using half the mango and everything else as listed - and EVEN with messing up the order of mixing and half the mangos, it was fantastic.  I was experimenting because I need to prepare some mango dishes for work next week and I will definitely be making this again (and ensuring I have enough mangos this time!)  Great recipe, thanks  for sharing!

This tasted delicious!  I substituted the butter for applesauce and addded vinegar (no lemon juice on hand!) for the baking powder to work.  Thus, I didn't have a problem with it rising.  My mangoes were actually tart so the sugar called for was fine; otherwise you may want to halve it.  The other reviewers were right - this did not taste that great the first day.  But by the next day, it was amazing!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I loved this recipe it was easy and delicious. I coated the mango in flour before I added it to the batter so it wouln't sink and a teaspoon of lemon juice to make it rise. I even gave it to a friend as a gift and her family ate it in one night my family did the same things. Great recipe!

I'm a mango fanatic and I was quite satisfied with this mango bread.  Granted, it didn't have much mango flavor, thus I'd suggest adding a small amount of pureed mango to the batter.  Dried cranberries make a nice raisin substitution for a more tart bread, but the sweetness of the raisins compliment the mango nicely (if using mangos that are still a bit tart, which I recommend).  I also used 1 c chopped walnuts for a nuttier bread.

Very good.  It's not too sweet, just right.  I didn't put walnuts or raisens in and it came out great.  My daughter and I love it.  Similar to carrot cake.  I think it would make a great cake with vanilla frosting on the top!

This bread is wonderful! It is very moist!! After peeling and cutting the first mango, I realized that the second one was not quite ripe enough.  I substituted the remaining mango needed with banana, pineapple and peach! I know it sounds a bit too fruity--but it was delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was amazing in every way. It was moist, the mango was chewy, and it cools down quickly. Very good w/o the raisins or walnuts and some extra coconut. I also used sweetened shredded coconut (instead of just regular coconut) and flax (instead of eggs). Definitely will be making this again.

I am not a good baker! But, I really wanted to try this bread. I am not crazy about artificial sweeteners, and wanted to make it healthier, so I made the following changes:
I used 1 cup all purpose and 1 cup unbleached flour
3 tsp baking soda (after reading other comments)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon because I really want to taste the mango. 
5 medium mangos - about 3 1/2 - 4 cups. (1 ½ cups of it I pureed) I did NOT use store bought, I used my mother in law's which have no fiber and taste like candy! Unfortunately I do not know the "type". 
butter -a quarter of a cup (1/2 of a stick)
canola oil - a quarter of a cup
¾ cup of organic whole cane sugar, and it was still a little too sweet
3eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tsp lemon – (another reader suggested this for rising but I forgot to add it and my bread did not rise)
1/2 cup raisins – I omitted these (again in hopes of increasing the mango flavor)
I used 1 cup walnuts(love walnuts)
¾ cup of desiccated unsweetened coconut
The rest is pretty much the same, except that due to laziness I used my Vitamix to blend the dry ingredients, then separately the wet ingredients, then combined the 2 in a bowl.
I also had to lessen the cooking time to 35 min. Probably because I have a convection oven? Maybe due to the ingredient change?

Loved this bread. The only changes I made was omitting the raisin because my family does not care for them and I puréed the mango instead of chopped. The bread was very moist and flavorful. Will absolutely make this recipe again.

This is a very moist, sweet bread. I added 1 teaspoon baking powder with the baking soda. Instead of vegetable oil I used coconut oil to add to that tropical flavor. I substituted sliced almonds for walnuts (they seem more tropical than walnuts to me). I used four mangoes (about 2.5 cups) that I mashed. I baked at 325 for 50 minutes; lower your over temperature to 325 and cover your pans with aluminum foil halfway through or your bread will be very dark brown. Many of the mangoes did settle in the bottom, but you still get some mango in every bit. This is very tropical, perfect with coffee or milk in the morning. Definitely sweet enough without any topping or glaze.

This mango bread turned out great. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and omitted the rasins. My mango was mashed. The bread had a good flavor and was moist. The walnuts and shredded coconut made the texture better.

This bread tastes pretty good although not as "tropical" as I expected.  I found the Mangos to be a pain to cut up but that is just me.  very moist, would probably do it as more of a coffee cake in a 8x8 next time maybe with some kind for icing....  bread bakes up darker than I expected so I thought it was done, toothpick came out clean, took it out and realised it wasn't done and had to put it back in.  would make again if a few mangos fell into my lap like they did this week but wouldn't go out buying mangos to make this.

I omitted the vegetable oil, raisins, walnuts, and coconut. I didn't have the vegetable oil on hand and was not keen substituting for something else i.e. canola oil. It was cooked for a little over 40 minutes. It was brown on the top and toothpick test came clean. The result : smooth, moist, and yummy mango bread. One caveat, we couldn't taste the mango. So I might experiment by either (1) subsitute vanilla extract with a mango extract if there is such a thing (2) put more mangoes. But overall great recipe to work with and serves its purpose.  Will definitely bake again.

Very tasty!  The bread falls apart easily, and while I"m told that happens to the majority of fruit breads, I've also been told (have yet to try) that greek yogurt should thicken it up just enough to hold together better!  Will be trying this again!

I enjoyed this easy recipe.  I used durian instead of mango and omitted the walnuts and coconut.  I also used a bundt pan and dusted it with cinnamon sugar, then coated the top of the batter with cinnamon sugar as well and that made it even sweeter!  I also went with 1/2 baking soda and 1/2 baking powder as that's always resulted in good quick breads for me in the past.  I will definitely try this recipe with mango in the future.

This recipe was OK - very moist, but shy on mango flavor in my opinion.  I followed recipe exactly, but I did "process the chopped mangos with my hand mixer" which produced some juice, but left mostly chopped mangos.  Everybody at work loved it, except myself and the other two ladies who like to bake...

So amazing! I cut the recipe in half because I only had one bread pan, but then I accidentally put in double the amount of vanilla extract I needed. No matter-this was amazing all the same! So moist and the mango tastes soooo good. This was a hit when I brought a couple pieces to work. :)

Hmmm. I think I'll try this again, pureeing the mango as others have said.  It was good and I didn't have trouble with it rising, as others noted.  I wonder if the rising issues have something to do with how acid the particular mangoes you use are.

I added 1 teaspoon of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and pureed half of the mango as others had suggested. I also used only 2 tablespoons of butter and the rest coconut oil (no vegetable oil). I baked them in muffin tins. Wonderful!!! Thanks for posting this great recipe!

Loved this recipe! I'm just glad that my first baked bread experience happened to be this great tasting mango bread!  It was easy to make, very straight forward instructions.  In addition, instead of using walnuts I threw in some macadamia nuts.  Good stuff!

Deliciously MOIST! I changed the recipe to 5 servings and used a can of mangoes, which was PERFECT. Pureed it first in the blender and mixed it into the recipe the way that it was written. Thanks for some DELICIOUS BREAD!

My husband grew up in Kailua, Hawaii and his grandmother always made mango bread for him.  This bread is very sweet and dense.  Instead of all purpose flour, I used whole wheat flour.  I mashed the mangoes instead of pureeing or chopping them.  Also used pecans instead of walnuts.  With the coconut flakes, the bread was a bit too sweet.  Next time, I will try the recipe omitting the coconut flakes.

I am not a very experienced cook of baker but made this recipe as is.  I found it very moist and somewhat crumbly when cut but the taste was so good that people couldn't stop eating.  Everyone suggested that I not change a thing the next time I make it===also to let them know when the next batch was ready. GOOD recipe to be sure.

Honestly the best bread I have ever eaten! On my 4th loaf, I doubled the raisens, nuts and added a little extra coconut! The coconut was sweetened so I used a little less sugar. Fabulous! Now I always have a loaf on reserve in the freezer (just incase of emergencies!)

My daughter and I made this mango bread yesterday and it was absolutely amazing! We made it as a cake though and it was just incredibly delicious, neither of us could pass by it without taking a piece. I recommend this to everyone because it is just the right amount of sweetness; yet very addicting! Thank you for this amazing recipe! 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!

I really enjoyed this. Like other reviewers mentioned, this is a very dense and wet bread.
I only used two cups of mango and substituted the last cup for one cup of banana.

Really delicious, going to make again today.

Wow!!! Double wow!  My family loves it.  We finish half of the cake(I bake it in a 8"square tin) after dinner.  It is easy, simply delicious.  But I cut down the sugar for the mango is sweet.  I didn't put the last 3 ingredient and it still taste so good.

OK, I was going to make this WONDERFUL sounding recipe and prove all those nay sayer wrong.  Well, it was so less than wonderful. Now I will admit I did not add the coconut, nuts or rasins but added more mango that called for, also added lemon juice, a little ginger and a pinch of cardamon.  It really tasted like a really good peach cobbler.  Not at all what I expected.  It was very moist.  I don't think I will be making it again this way, I may try it without the mango all together and replace them with cranberries and walnuts.

No matter who I served this receipe to, those that had eaten Mango Bread before, those who hadn't and those who said they didn't like mangos, all raved at how moist, and delicious this receipe is.  Best Mango bread receipe I've made to date.

I made this recipe last night substituting 3/4 cup applesauce for the oil and adding 1/2 stick butter (unsalted).  Also, I did't add the raisins or nuts only the coconut.  Wow, is it moist, almost like mango pudding, but very delicious.  I took one to work and it was gone within minutes.

DELICIOUS!  I used very ripe mangos and I chose to puree them along with some cinnamon chips (since I ws out of ground cinnamon), used almonds instead of walnuts and threw some chocolate chips in instead of raisons since I hate them.  Very good, but I'll agree with others that there really isn't a dominant mango taste to this.  Reminds me of banana bread, with just a hint of mango taste.  I'd make this again for sure...thanks for the recipe!

Very good bread, but I agree the mango flavor is quite mild.  Made only one loaf since the 2 over-ripe mangoes I had were on the smallish side.  Cut back a bit on the sugar as well as replaced the butter/oil with yogurt/applesauce.  Omitted the walnuts and raisins (personal preference), but added a squeeze of lime.  The bread is super-moist and tastes oh-so tropical with a dollop of lime curd (made from 'Perfect Lemon Curd').  Thanks!

This is a very good bread...however, it was too moist...probably my fault...added too much mango.  I added raisins and craisins, and slivered almonds (no walnuts).  With the exception of the moistness, I have nothing bad to say about this bread.  I'll make again.

After reading the reiews I was expecting a great loaf. It was not at all great! I pureed some of the mango as some had suggested for extra flavour & I use olive oil in all of my baking(with no negative results...ever). The mango flavour did not come thru and the rest of the loaf was just as flavourless??
Ate half, threw out other half & froze the remaining loaf. I will not make this again & have taken it out of my recipe box. Too bad, I love cooking/baking & have done my share in this life time & am never disappointed with the outcome taste.

Fabulous! This bread is moist, sweet, and addictive. It doesn't have tremendous mango flavor but it's still awesome. Even my 5 year old tried some and loved it, which surprised me. Made a couple of changes: replaced the oil with applesauce and used pecans because I was out of walnuts. The loaves didn't rise a lot but they turned out of the pans easily. Next time I may reduce the sugar a bit. Definitely a keeper to have on hand when mangoes are in season!

This was fabulous!!!  After first coming out of the oven, it was really flaky - after putting it in the fridge, it solidified some and got the consistency of banana bread.  Very good.  I pureed the mango and added extra coconut instead of the raisins (personal preference).  Highly recommend this recipe!

This is delicious!  Reminds me a lot of fruit breads I ate while in Maui last year.  I made this and took one of the loaves into work; the entire loaf was devoured in less than an hour, and I was besieged with requests for the recipe.  I omitted nuts and raisins because of picky eaters at my house, and increased the amount of coconut to 1 cup.  Be sure to follow the recipe's directions; beat the shortening/sugar/egg mixture until light, not just until it's mixed, and allow the batter to rest for the 20 minutes specified in the recipe.  Thank you for this yummy recipe!

Very good.  I used craisins instead of raisins (bc I didn't have any).  I think this substitution made it better, gave it a tangy zip.  Husband and kids loved it!

I tried this recipe despite the latest poor rating and thought it was EXCELLENT, a flavor like no other.  I followed the recipe exactly and am so glad I tried it.  The previous rater must have not followed the recipe or did not know what they were doing, this bread is so moist...THANK YOU!!!!!!!

This is such a good recipe for when you want a change of pace from the typical quick breads (banana, cranberry, etc).  It is easily adaptable to whatever fruit you have on hand, and it freezes well, too.  I made mini-loaves - we ate the first loaf and I froze the others.  It was really convenient to just pull out a couple little loaves when we had overnight guests (no-fuss breakfast!), and they loved it, too.

My mother-in-law loves Mangos but is alergic to the peel, so she can only eat them if someone else does the peeling.  I decided to try this bread for her as something different.  What a hit!  We had a house full of people, the night I was cooking it and they could barely wait for it to come out of the oven!  As a matter of fact...one loaf was eaten, completely, right when it came out of the oven!  I refused to let anyone touch the 2nd loaf until the next day.  My mother-in-law, and everyone else, loved this bread!

I'm thinking the loaf pan size isn't quite right. I used two 7" round pans, which in theory are smaller than 9X5" pans. Yet the result is only about an inch high in the pan. This recipe seems like it would fill a single 9X5" loaf pan with a little left over.  Followed some of the suggested revisions. Cooked at 325 for 55 minutes. I have yet to taste, as it just came out of the oven and I'm following the advice to let it sit overnight. The photo given with the recipe doesn't look like there are any chunks in the bread - it looks perfectlysmooth, so I wonder if this was a stock photo and not from the current recipe.

A lot went into this recipe for it to come out with so little flavor. I should have made pumpkin or banana bread instead.

This recipe was AMAZING!!  It was moist and so, so good.  I loved it with the mango, but you could definitely substitute other fruit. I also used craisins instead of raisins and didn't put in nuts (just personal preference).

I agree with others, it tastes better more days it sits...... but not much mango/fruity flavor comes through.... just tasted like a banana-less bread.....Definitely needed a lower oven temp for baking..... did two loaves..... one at the suggested temp, other at a 325 temp.... 325 had no gooey dough....better texture

It made 6 mini loaf pans (silicone). 
I did change the fats ... instead of the oil and butter i used 1/2 cup of greek yogurt & 1/4 cup almond milk. (make sure to whip the yogurt and sugar first and then add the milk to the wet ingredients) 
The sugar was a little much so I changed it to 3/4 cup of white sugar. (although I might change it to honey next time) 
I added a 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger to add a little zing. 
Make sure that you use really ripe mangos. I diced them into 1/2 inch cubes. 
Cooking time took about 45-50 minutes @ 350. 
They rose well and tasted great. 
Got a lot of praise. Good thing that it is mango season
It came out to 336 calories per loaf.

This is a fantastic Mango bread.  I did not have coconut, only  roasted macadamian nuts.  Did not add the raisins, because our grandaughters hate them in desserts, but even without these ingredients, it was a hit!  This is a keeper from now on.

Thank you for sharing!

This is an unappetizing cake. The flavor profile is not for me. Firstly, there's no mango flavor in the cake; the raisins, coconut, walnuts overpower it. I was a little upset by that because I used delicious mangoes that I could've enjoyed fresh. Secondly, the coconut, raisin and walnut combination does not work for me. It tastes off. And lastly, the bread does not rise. If you must try this recipe, use 3 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp of lemon. It'll still be a very dense bread. 
Honestly, I'll stick with banana or apple if I want a snacking cake. This cake is a waste of mango imo.

This in now my "go-to" sweet bread recipe.  I make it for my family as well as take it to parties and pot-luck dinners.  I now take a few copies of the recipe with me when I share because I have been asked EVERY time.  Depending on the where I'm taking the bread I might not add the nuts.  Only tip, don't use over ripe mangos, to much liquid.  Some people have suggested using other types of dried fruit, replacing the raisins and even substituting papaya for mango.

I was a bit skeptical,  worried it'd be too dry but omigod, it was absolutely perfectly moist and flavorful!  

I made some changes:  Used Rice Flour instead of wheat flour and used half a cup more of mangoes and didn't do coconut flakes or raisins but only walnuts.  Everyone loved it!!!  

I will try to use a natural substitute for sugar next time.  Agave, maybe?  

Can't wait to make more to share with more family and friends!

Thank you for this superb recipe!

Loved this recipe with the following modifications:
Reduced sugar to 1 cup
Replaced half of the oil with butter
Used self-rising flour since that's all I had.
It turned out wonderfully.  
Thanks, Chinky!

Delicious! I didn't have raisins or walnuts and added extra mangoes, but followed the recipe otherwise. Was delicious. I lowered the temperature by 15 degrees because my bread pans were dark colored. Came out moist and yummy!!! Will make again every time my mom's Miami mango tree is in season :)

This bread has been such a hit that I've made three batches in two days! My family, coworkers and friends are all requesting it!  First batch I made for family was without raisins, coconut and walnuts (they aren't fans).  It was yummy but a little more like cake.  But very good and fluffy!  The other batches had coconut and walnuts and I think it is even better.  Helps to make it more like bread as mangos are pretty juicy so I think it helps to absorb moisture.  We have a absolutely delicious mango tree so I'm always looking for new recipes to use up our mangos!  This is definitely a hit and being stored for next mango season as well.

I followed the recipe exact except I omitted the nuts and coconut. And I puréed the mango. I did not have 2 loaf pans so I used a 9x13 pan cooked a little higher temp and for 40 minutes and came out nicely. I also added one tsp of lemon juice to help it rise.

I made this exactly as written except I substituted pecans for walnuts because that's what I had on hand. Amazing bread! I then realized this should be my new base quick bread and I made a pineapple bread and a zucchini carrot bread from this recipe by substituting fruits and veggies.

I used this recipe and a couple small changes one of the helpful reviewers added and it came out wonderful. It doesnt rise a whole lot, but the bread is moist and does cook all the way through nicely. I'll be making this again in the near future.

Changes I made:
1 Tbsp baking soda;
1 tsp baking powder;
1 tsp fresh lemon juice;
1 1/4 cups sugar;
1/2 tsp ground ginger;
I also measure out 3 cups of chopped mango and ran it through the food pocesser to spread the mango flavor better throughout the bread. 

My oven tends to burn my baked goods when I follow recipes exactly, so i had the heat somewhere between 300 and 325 and only needed to bake my loaves together in the oven for about 40 minutes rather than 50.

First time using the original recipe was very good. Second time I modified somewhat to fit my families tastes.  Using 2.5 cups flour, adding 3tsp baking soda, 1tsp baking powder 1sm pkg vanilla pudding 1tsp ginger .5tsp nutmeg 1tsp cinnamon .5tsp salt.  The wet mix .5cup butter .5cup sour cream 3eggs 1Tb oil 1tsp lemon juice and 1cup brown sugar I did use the 3 cups mango however I course ground them . The reason I cut back the sugar, the mango are extremely sweet from our trees ...you may have to adjust depending on the fruit. I baked in a bundt pan on convection set at 325 for 1hour or until toothpick is clean.  I drizzed a cream cheese glaze on top after cool!

This bread is wonderful. I followed the recipe as written with 2 exceptions. I used coconut oil in place of vegetable oil and after greasing my pans I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar. I only tasted bits of the bread myself since I have to follow a gluten-free diet, but I got rave reviews from all who tasted it.

This bread is delicious. I also made a few changes as suggested by other posters. I used 1/2 cup Earth Balance in place of butter and 1/2 cup sour cream for the oil and added 1 tsp. lemon juice. I only used 1/3 cup white sugar and added a couple squeezes (I didn't measure) of good local honey. The coconut I used was sweetened, and I do not have much of a sweet tooth. For me, a little sugar goes a long way. I used 1 tsp. of baking soda; 1 tsp. of baking powder. The mangoes were from my neighbor's tree! Not sure the variety, but they did turn out a little stringy, even though I pureed them. Oh, I also added 1/2 a banana to the mango puree, used golden raisins, and macadamias in place of walnuts. Other than the little bit of stringiness, this bread is spot on. Moist, and not too sweet.

This recipe is very similar to one that has been passed on in my family  from Hawaii except it called for less eggs. I subsituted 1 C oat flour and 1 C whole wheat, coconut oil, and 3/4 C coconut sugar  to make it a little healthier. Turned out very moist and just the right amount of sweetness.

I used a reconstituted package of dried mangoes from Kroger. I used only 1 cup of sugar and baked in a 9x9 square pan. Straight out of the oven it is a little dry. This moistens/tastes better after it has sat in an airtight container for at least a day. I may try adding in banana next time for some extra flavor/moistness, also maybe more cinnamon and some nutmeg. I couldn't taste the coconut, so maybe creating a coconut frosting would help.

Good recipe, great way to use ripe mangos. Looked at a few mango bread recipes, liked this one with the coconut.    I didn't have raisins, didn't have walnuts, so added chopped pecans instead.  substituted nonfat plain Greek yogurt for the butter.  My house smelled fabulous.  The bread is delicious, tasted it warm. The only thing that is a bit strange is that the bread is a good texture, but the mango pieces are soft....but still delicious. I think I would chop  the fruit smaller or run in the blender next time.

Great recipe! I used 3 teaspoons of baking soda, overripe mangoes and pulp that didn't require processing, and a four-loaf pan. I also added cardamom to the dry ingredients.  I didn't have a problem with the rise or texture and the loaves were moist and delicious.  They were even better the second day.  I'll definitely make these again.  Thanks for sharing!

I wasn't to sure of this at first and I didn't read the reviews until after it was mixed and waiting to go in the oven so the only change was dropping it to 325 degrees for 50 min and I left out the raisins and walnuts. It was EXCELLENT. I took one loaf to the pottery studio and it was gone in 2 hrs and had people asking for the recipe. Thank you SACKPAC for sharing!!!

I used this recipe to make 2 dozen mango muffins and I was very pleased with the result.  I puréed 3 cups of mango that were too ripe to stay in neat, cut cubes.  I also increased the baking soda to 3 teaspoons and used dedicated coconut (and skipped the nuts and raisins).  After 20-25 minutes at 350 degrees F, they were perfect and delicious.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  A wonderful way to use the bag of overripe mangos my husband brought home (with the leftovers, I made a mango sorbet).

We have an abundance of mangoes thanks to one of my co-worker's overflowing tree! So I am glad I found this recipe.  I substituted the oil and butter for an equal amount of coconut oil. Used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and  1/2 cup of white flour.  Less than one cup of sugar as well.  Did not add raisins or walnuts.  Came out great!  A little less than I would have liked to fill two pans but It still made two delicious loaves. Fabulous!  -Naples Paradise

I made this recipe, I substituted 1/2c honey for the sugar and used whole wheat pastry flour. It is delicious, house smells divine.Will make again since we have plenty of mango at this time of the year in Florida.

I made this with smaller mango pieces so that they were even in the bread. Same thing, not too much mango flavour but I love the texture with walnuts, raisin & coconut! I also used powdered sugar since I didn't have enough granulated sugar which made it easier to mix with the batter. Great recipe!

Just made it and I think all homemade bread is better after set up in the fridge. Only thing I did different was add 1 1/2 tap baking powder since previous comments said it didn't rise. But the BP made it almost like a cake and it's supposed to be bread so I should have just followed the recipe as followed. It's still delicious!

I am yet another person, who used this recipe as a basis.  Here are some modifications I did.

I put in ginger, no cinnamon.  
- I made a crumble on top of coconut, sugar, flour and butter with cinnamon.  
- I omitted the coconut from the bread itself and opted to put on top.
- no raisin or cranberries, although I considered it!
- I had an overripe banana that I through into the mix
- added 1/3 c. buttermilk (for moistness) - omitted the oil
- added mandarin zest, and the rest of the mandarin orange beated into the mix
- beat the sugar and butter until it was fluffy


So finally, it's a totally different recipe all together, and perhaps I should post it as such...

vibrant and full of flavor!

I made this with a few flavor modifications to suit our tastes.  I pureed the mango, swapped macadamia nuts for the walnuts, and omitted the raisins and coconut.  This bread tastes awesome, especially warm right from the oven, but I had a major issue with it rising.  The middle sank terribly and was underdone, while the edges were perfectly done.  I ended up throwing it back in the oven for a little while longer but I think the recipe needs a tweak to make it rise evenly.  Then it would be a 5 star!!  :)

Excellent and sweet.  I split it 50/50 mango and crushed pineapple. The bread was a little too moist and not as cohesive as it would have been without the pineapple but the flavor was outstanding!

I enjoyed this bread.  Instead of butter I used yoplait mango and peach 6 oz yogurt and add 1 teaspoon of baking powder. I  omit the raisins, coconut and nuts because I had none. I also reduce the sugar to a cup and mash three large mangoes. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing. I was really looking for something to do with mangoes besides smoothies now I can.

I made this mango bread for the first time during mango season last summer (2011). I took one to work and everyone raved about it for weeks. I just made it again, hoping it will be as delicious as last time!

I made this bread omitting the raisins & walnuts and substituting the white sugar for raw sugar and it turned out perfect & delicious! I made enough to share with our neighbors and they all loved it! We live in Costa Rica and it is raining mangoes! The mango trees are filled with hundreds of ripe mangoes all over. I felt like I needed to come up with a way to use them. This was the perfect solution. I will definitely make this again...I plan to make muffins next time using this  same recipe.

This is delicious, but stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I used light colored non stick bread pans, lightly greased (per the directions) with Crisco.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I was able to loosen the sides with a plastic knife, but the bottom stuck on both loaves.  It was definitely done, the toothpick was clean, and any longer would have burnt the tops.

This was REALLY good... I used all oil (didn't have any butter in the house).  I also forgot raisins but I did have craisins so I used those. Really good. Used chopped macadamia nuts instead of the walnuts. Yum.

This was delicious.  My oven gets really hot and so mine was done in 25 min @350.  I used others suggestions of 1 tsp.baking powder/1 tsp soda.  I pureed the mango.  I also cut back on the sugar.

This bread is great.  I used 5 very ripe mangoes. I blended most of them in the food processer, leaving the last one to cut into chunks.  The bread is very moist and delicious.

Great recipe!  I had some frozen mango that I needed to do something with and this worked perfectly.  I ran out of raisins at the last minute, so I ended up using half raisins, half chopped dried apricots, and I didn't have cinnamon, so I used a dollop of apple cinnamon jelly and it still turned out great.  Can't wait to try this with REAL cinnamon.  I'm sure it'll be even better!

I really liked it and so did my grandma who loves mangos.  I wasnt a big fan of the walnuts though, just a personal preference though.

Mangoes are too expensive in my area to waste on this recipe. It just didn't bring out the wonderful flavor of mango; dull, dull, dull. Surprisingly, the loaves were dryer than expected. (I couldn't stomach eating the last bit of the 2nd loaf and threw it away.)

This was a delight!  I only used a handful of rasins..probably half a cup, as I don't care for cooked rasins very much.  I used fresh coconut, mmm..good, but difficult to achieve given the shape of cracked coconut and the shredder.  I crunched up some almond slivers in place of the walnuts.  I will make this one again! Thanks.
