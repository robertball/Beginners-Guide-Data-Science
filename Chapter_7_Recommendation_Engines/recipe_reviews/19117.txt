Really nice recipe! I added extra apples like some reviewers before me. I also added chopped almonds and almond extract which I HIGHLY reccomend! Very tasty! My only complaint was that once I got the icing on there, the combination was a little too sweet for me. I think I would cut back on the sugar in the cake it's self, as the icing was really yummy. I will deffinetly make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)

Great cake, great frosting.  The cake is moist without being soggy or oil-saturated.  Pleasantly autumn spiced with nice chunks of sweet apple (I used apples from our tree and I haven't a clue what they are - all I know is that they are sweet and hold their shape).  The frosting was gorgeous.  I generally have no problem using shortening in frostings, particularly if I need it to be pure white, but in this case I felt this frosting begged for butter.  Since there was already a fair amount of nutmeg in the cake, I used apple pie spice instead of nutmeg in the frosting, as I'm not a fan of too much nutmeg. I beat the frosting a good long time, which made it luxuriously fluffy and smooth.  Once frosted, I sprinkled it all over with freshly ground cinnamon/sugar.

This is fabulous.  I made it as directed except I used slightly more than 2 cups of apples, I added some ground cloves, too, and I did not make the frosting. I don't think the cake needs it, and it would probably be too sweet for us. Instead, I made a cinnamon sugar mixture and sprinkled it on the cake before baking--it made a great crispy topping. The cake itself has a very light texture. Great recipe!

This is a cake that will impress ! Lovely taste, with an amazing topping. Keeps well in the fridge. For non spice lovers try omitting the use of nutmeg, and using real vanilla in the frosting (insted of cinnamon and nutmeg).

Loved this cake (and don't omit the frosting!).   I mistakenly peeled too many apples, so I actually had 4 cups of chopped fruit.  I baked in the 9x9 inch pan, but the additional fruit required me to bake this almost 60 minutes before the toothpick came out clean.  Next time, I'll still double the fruit, but I'll bake in a 9 x 13 pan.  DELISH!

This was really dense and moist and so tasty. I used 3 big apples in the cake and used fresh grated nutmeg and it tasted really spicy. For the icing I just used a nutmeg/cinnamon/powdered sugar and milk mixture instead of the thicker frosting, and it tasted really good anyways.

Needed a quick dessert for some friends who decided to bring a pot luck dinner at the last minute.  Quick, easy and delicious!  Not a crumb left.  Made exactly as written, using butter as the shortening and just a pinch of nutmeg since I don't care for it.

One word: YUMMY!
I didn't make the icing this first time, and I don't think it even needs it! (I bet it's delicious with it too though). Will definitely be making this again. Oh, and I added chopped walnuts to it.

We really enjoyed this cake. We didn't think the frosting was necessary (we did try it & it was good). I'd serve it plain with some whipped cream on the side. A keeper.

So good!  And easy to make!   I ended up using 3 large granny smith apples and instead of the icing I made a cream cheese icing (with the same seasonings...added vanilla).  It turned out perfect!  I can't wait to make it this fall!  Perfect for breakfast and dessert...

Well....I don't see what the big "tado" is about this cake!  I've had numerous apple cakes that would put this one to shame.  The nutmeg was way TOO much...and honestly I thought the cake was quite bland.  I tasted it before I made the frosting, and decided not to waste the ingredients. Sorry!

I had lots of apples so decided to try this out, had my mom and brother over for dinner and they loved it.  I thought the icing might be a bit too much, but tried it and loved it with the spices!  I made another one a few days later!  I am making one for the guys at the hunting cabin.  Hope I get some leftovers, but doubt it! :) I like trying new recipes and this is definitely a keeper!  Thanks

This cake was a big hit with my picky husband. It was a great way to use apples after apple picking at the farm and makes the house smell so good while it's baking. The frosting is a bit sweet so I would use a lttle less next time and use leftover for sugar cookies, Thanks for the recipe.

Will make this one again! (maybe for Thanksgiving dessert) I would prefer some more apple chunks in it, but that is just my preference. This cake is sweet and delicious.

I substituted butter for shortening in the cake and it came out light, fluffy and scrumptious! I also substituted unsalted butter for shortening in the icing and half and half for eveaporated milk and it came out light and fluffy as well. It was a bit on the sweet side and made way too much to ice the cake with. I have a ton left over. Next time I think I'll only put 1 cup of sugar. My husband and I ate this with hot tea and it was perfect for a cold autumn night.

Great recipe. Light and moist at the same time. Just the right amount of spice. Love the addition of brown sugar to really ramp up the richness. A keeper.

Mmmm, this cake was so good. I made it exactly as directed except I used a different frosting only because I had some leftover from another cake. The next time I make this I will add one more cup of apples because more is better right?!

Like others I increased the apples to 3 cups.  It worked out that one apple made one cup when diced up so I used 3 apples. I also added ground cloves (a half teaspoon) to the batter.  It took longer to cook than the recipe suggested (55 min), but that might be because of the extra apples.
I also agree with other reviewers that the frosting is too sweet.  I tried to make it less sweet (after I tasted the final product) by adding regular milk, but that didn't really work either. I ended up using 1/4 of the frosting I made just to put a thin layer on top to make it look nice without impacting the flavor too much.  Next time I'll probably just sprinkle powdered sugar over the top for looks instead of frosting.

I was hoping for more of a spice taste because of the name but didn't get that.  Overall not bad, just next time I will double the spice.

Delicious cake!  Every time I make it, it gets rave reviews.  I use cream cheese frosting instead.

I live in Denver, so I'm still playing with the recipe so that it stays together, but it's otherwise a delicious cake.

This was really good.  When making the cake, it seemed as though there were too many apples.  I cut it down to a cup and a half.  I wish I would have added the full two cups.  The cake rises so much that the apples spread out.  I made my own icing to cut down on the fat a little bit.

This is really good.  I added a little more apple because I like apples, and it turned out perfect.  I just got a new oven which has cake bake setting.  In that setting, it took about 55 minutes to cook through.  It came out moist, just perfect amount of sweetness.  Since I don't eat icing, I left it out.

Could not believe how quickly this got eaten. I was worried it might be too much spice, but even my kids loved it. I agree about the cake being sweet, and not needing glaze for that reason; but it's kind of plain looking without it--needs something on top.

This cake was much better than the apple cake I made over a year ago.  It's not dense and it is flavourful!  I think the icing makes ties it all together, as it adds another texture to the cake!  So creamy!

This was a very tasty cake. It had a nice crumb, was moist and the spice was very good. I made the icing, which was good as well, but next time I make it,  I will serve it without the icing and just use a drizzle of caramel sauce and possibly some glazed pecans and let the cake be the star!

This was a lovely apple treat!  My sons class went apple picking and he brought home a lot of them.  Easy way to use apples.  Being from UK, I made custard tonight to serve over them.  Very nice easy recipe.

This is my most requested cake. My family calls it Chris’ amazing apple cake. I did make a few changes to the recipe. I substituted sugar in the raw for regular sugar, decreased walnuts to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup craisens .  I also added a tbs of rum to the caramel glaze.

First time, followed the recipe. The  cake was good, the icing was not. The icing had no flavor except sweet. I added extra cinnamon in the hope it would help. It didn't. The next time I made the cake, I put in 3.5  cups of apples &  1/2 cup of walnuts. No icing.  I plan to cut back the white sugar next as the cake is a bit sweet. I'm also going to try making it as muffins. Without the icing & adding extra apples & walnuts, this recipe is 5 stars.

Ok this cake turned out great, Yes I changed it some what!
Though only to simplify the sponge mix.: 2cups plain flour,1 cup brown sugar,3tsp baking powder,1/2 tsp soda, 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, and in this case adding the cinnamon and nutmeg. just bung it all in a bowl and mix for 2 mins, then I added 2 diced apples .came out great. use the basic mix for lots of cakes and always come out great!

My husband and I had this last night. We both loved it! Aside from cutting back on the sugar (used 1C coconut sugar only), I followed the recipe. Thanks for this terrific recipe. It's a keeper!

I made this for my church ladies circle and they insisted I add this recipe to our 150th anniversary cookbook. I have never had that reaction before. I did'nt include the frosting and they insisted it did not need it.

I made as directed. It was moist and delicious. I do agree with other reviewers that the frosting, while very tasty, makes it too sweet. I will definitely make again.

I used 3 Granny Smith apples and left the nutmeg out of the icing. I also had to use a bundt pan because I didn't have a 9x9 pan.  This is an absolutely delicious cake.  Will definitely make it again.

My sister in law made this cake for me while I was visiting recently.  I loved it!! It was so good we enjoyed a piece for breakfast with tea! This cake is perfectly spiced, moist and full of apples. I added about 1/2 cup extra and did not chop them too small. The icing complements the not too sweet cake perfectly. This cake makes a wonderful addition to Fall meals and Is a great way to use the abundance of Fall apples. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe that is now in our family faves cook book.

I didn't make the frosting, and I bet that would have added to this. Without it, the cake tasted like a boxed spice cake mix with apples added to it. It was a tasty though!
