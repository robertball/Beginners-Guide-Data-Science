These are INCREDIBLE.  They made my house smell like lavender while they were baking!  I'll be hinting that I want for these for my Mother's Day breakfast........The muffin cups will be almost full, but don't let that scare you--the recipe is perfect, instructions are perfect, just make sure you like lavender if you make these.  The taste is not overpowering, but you can tell that it's there (and I love it!).  Thank you for sharing such a delightful recipe!!

We absolutely LOVED these muffins! They have everything in them we like; Blueberries, bananas and just a hint of lavendar. And, yet they are not dense and heavy. I made them per the recipe with no changes, except my blueberries were from my freezer and I added them frozen. Also, I used a corn oil/canola oil blend. I will make again for sure! This recipe is a keeper.

Wishing I had more overripe bananas to use!  These are absolutely delicious!  I varied the recipe only slightly:  1) Used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup since the fruit adds plenty of sweetness, 2) Subbed out 1/2 the oil and used unsweetened applesauce instead, 3) added a tiny dash of vanilla.  These muffins did not have a strong banana flavor, so if you're looking for that you may need to adjust the quantity of banana.  I prefer it with only mild banana flavor though, and thought the blueberry and lavender added such a nice, fresh touch.

Very nice.  The lavender is noticeable, but hubs still liked the muffins.  I wasn't sure he would . . . .however, it gives a subtle flavor.  without the lavender, I'd definitely add vanilla or cinnamon, but with it was rather lovely.  The muffins do not overfill, rise nicely, and are a tad dense but are nice little muffins for breakfast or a snack.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't add lavender.  I was looking for a good banana blueberry muffin recipe and decided to try this one despite the call for lavender, which I didn't have. My boyfriend eats two at a time. My kids ate 'em.   They were good and I liked them.  I didn't think they were very moist and thought they were pretty dense.  But I also just realized that I doubled the recipe and didn't double the banana count. :/ Although, I thought the banana flavor was strong enough using two bananas.  I cook, but don't bake enough to know whether or not that would've affected the moisture and density.

These are so moist and yummy! I only made a couple of changes, reduced sugar to 3/4 cup, substituted applesauce for oil and upped the blueberries to 1 1/2 cups!! Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!  I also used frozen berries and thawed bananas that I had previously frozen for smoothies. ~Linda from Cedar Hills, Ut~

These were a bit sweet for me.  I will use only 3/4 of the sugar, if I make it again.  Otherwise, an excellent use for my leftover bananas, and lavender!  I used frozen berries, btw, and it worked perfectly.

Half of my family is lactose intolerant so I use unsweetened almond milk in place of regular milk but besides that I stick to the recipes if I rate them. This recipe deserves all five stars, moist, tasty, the three flavors are a wonderful compliment to each other. I have played with the recipe for fun and found many wonderful variations of this one, so if you need to make a change here of there this recipe is very forgiving and should still come out great. Thank you, Suzanne, for this wonderful, great and unique take on blueberry muffins. They are perfect!!! We eat these a few times a month and will continue to.

OH. MY. GOSH. I am not normally a muffin person, but WOW. I will make these again, and again, and again. I used 2 tsp. lavender flowers. While using frozen blueberries is ok, use fresh if they are in season - it's worth it! I also used 2% milk. Make sure your bananas are beginning to brown, and use 2-3 regular-sized or 2 very large.

We liked these a lot.  I didn't have whole wheat flour, so just raised the all-purpose flour to 1 1/2 cup.

These are absolutely fabulous. I made them according to recipe and they turned out great. Everybody at the Easter brunch party loved them. It is just the right amount of lavender: not overpowering. I also made a batch using gluten-free flour and those turned out amazing as well. I will definitely be serving these again!

These turned out fantastic.  I did not have any lavender so I added vanilla.  Made 12 perfect sized muffins. I found them a little sweet for my taste so I would reduce sugar to 3/4 cup next time.  My family loved them.  :-)

Im trying not to be one of "those" people, but i didn't use the lavender in the recipe. I was making a late night breakfast for the kids in the morning and didn't have the lavender on hand. However, the kids ate them all up. No talking; just eating. That says a lot. I would make these again.

I used three very ripe mashed bananas and topped the muffins with turbinado sugar. I would probably bake them for an extra two minutes next time, but that's all I would change. Really delicious and got lots of compliments.

Loved them!  Made as "mini" muffins, used frozen mixed berries instead and added 3 T of flour due to my high altitude baked at 350 for about 9 min.  Would lessen the sugar to 1/2 but otherwise they were perfect :P

I did not like the muffin mix. Loved the mix of blueberries and lavender together, it made these muffins have a unique flavor. I would use a different muffin mix and add the blueberries and lavender. The only thing different that I did was use lavender sugar instead of plain sugar for that extra lavender flavor.

loving this. the lavender was noticeable  the combination of the blueberries and banana worked out really well  it has a suitable and subtle flavour yet thinking that the banana will make it heavy I was wrong they were not heavy and dense my children cleared it out in 2 days wow that is how recommendable your recipe is

Very moist. I had frozen blueberries and was too impatient to defrost them. I used 2 different pans. One with cupcake liners, and the other in a mini fluted metal cupcake pan without liners. The unlined ones cooked in 20 minutes on 400 degrees in my convection oven. The lined ones are still in at 26 minutes and are still not done. The frozen berries probably effected the moisture level. I tried one and they very mild and lightly sweet. This is my first lavender cooking experience despite having some big lavender bushes in my yard. I'm excited to try it in something savory. These are worth making. A nice change from over sugary muffins.

These were moist, and the texture was good. I like lavender, blueberries and bananas, but the flavors combined were just a bit off. I think  it's just a personal preference, nothing wrong with the recipe.

These turned out wonderfully! The only change I made (this is Allrecipes, of course I didn't fully follow the recipe) was using whole milk instead of 1%, because that is what I normally drink, and I figured it wouldn't detract from the recipe. (Not worth buying one of the pint-sized 1% containers at the grocery store nearby or hunting for a smaller 1% container at a different store.) Southern all-purpose flour (like White Lily) is better than northern all-purpose flour (like Gold Medal) for making fluffier, lighter baked goods like biscuits, but given the banana component of this recipe (and my preference for dense, gluteny muffins over cakey muffins), I went with northern flour. My girlfriend had vanilla sugar (white sugar infused with some vanilla flavor by putting vanilla beans in it for a while) she made on hand, so we sprinkled some on top of the muffins, and it made a great garnish.

I love muffins but these weren't the best. They had a good flavor but were crazy dense and heavy. I am not sure what I did wrong but they were as heavy as a rock.

These turned out beautifully!! I have never used lavender for baking before, and it was so amazing! It gave these muffins a very nice taste and they smelled good too. I had bees trying to get in through the kitchen window. :)

I had some bananas past prime and had just purchased blueberries today at the market. Went looking for a recipe to use both and found this one.I just happen to grow a big patch of lavender! These muffins are easy and delicious.I will make them again. The lavender sends it out of the ordinary to extraordinary. Impressive.

I was looking for recipes to use some of the lavender that grows in our garden. Happened to have an abundance of blueberries in the freezer and plenty of very ripe bananas on the counter so this was perfect. My husband, daughter, and I all loved them. The 2 youngest kids were not big fans. Perhaps a more sophisticated palette than one belonging to a 7 year-old is required. I found the lavender to be subtle but delicious, especially as it enhanced the smell of the product and left a lingering taste on the tongue. My husband thought they were really good and was surprised when I told him that they contained lavender. I found them to not be overly sweet and thought that the fruits/herb provided a nice balance of flavors without any one standing out more than the others. Will make again often.

Wow! These muffins are heavenly. My kitchen smelled AMAZING! This was my first time cooking with lavender and I am mighty glad I did! I didn't have overly ripe bananas so I browned the bananas myself in the oven. I placed 2 bananas on a foil lined baking sheet and baked at 275 degrees for about 30 minutes. I ground the lavender buds in my small coffee grinder. I substituted buttermilk for the 1% milk because I just happened to have buttermilk. I used frozen blueberries that I removed from the freezer at the last minute so they didn't have much time to thaw. I will be making these muffins again!
