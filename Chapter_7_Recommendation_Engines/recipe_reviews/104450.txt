I am a fish only eater but had never tried pollock so I was excited to try this recipe.  It was spur of the moment, so I had to make some modifications using what I had in my fridge...yellow pepper instead of green and I skipped the cheese.  Turned out pretty good.  Would definitely make it again.

Pretty good.  Will make again.  I cooked my onions in a skillet on a stove top first, since I don't like them as raw.  I also added a 1/2 clove of garlic, minced.  Didn't have the green pepper, but it would be good with it, so I will probably try that next time and cook it with the onions on the stove top first.

I have just cooked Pollock Montreal.  It was extremely tasty and satisfying and we enjoyed it.
Not bought pollock before - thought it was only for cats! But the recession bites and we bought a pack of frozen pollock to try.  It was skinned and the fillets were v. scrawny - that's when I looked for a recipe that would improve them.  Pollock Montreal did all that.  Thanks!

Very good but I did make some changes.
I seasoned the fish with pepper and organo. Then place the tomato on top and cooked. I then saute the onions, mushrooms and garlic. Placed them on top after the fish cooked with Provolone cheese. Not a real fishy taste. One thing is that I used the frozen Pollock and it really shrunk when it was cooked.

Simple to make, great tasting, and using a fish that is economical, and hugely under-rated.

I was surprised with how good this was.  The pollock fillets that I used were about 3 ounces a piece so I used 4 of them and reduced the cooking time some.  In order to ensure that the peppers and onions would be soft I microwaved them for a few minutes before placing them on the pollock,  this was a nice spin on pollock, thank you for the recipe.

Since pollock doesn't have a lot of taste alone the trick to this dish is to add flavor.  I used canned stewed tomatoes, paprika, "Everglades Seasoning", and a southwestern style cheese.  It was pretty darn good!

The fish can out great, I used a mix of mozzerella and cheddar.  I took the advise of another reviewer and sauteed the peppers and onions first and I think that made a big difference.  I served it over pasta with cooked artichokes and tomatoes drizzled with olive oil.  Good base recipe - can do countless things with it!

I made this tonight.  I don't like fish, but I could get this down.  My husband LOVED it.  I did add some garlic and sprinkled some fresh chives over the top before serving.

Just made this tonight, I did adjust it a bit though due to what i had on hand. My husband who does not like fish LOVED it! I will definitely make this again. this is what I did. Sprinkled fish with salt & pepper to taste, sprinkled with paprika, and then grated Parmesan cheese. set aside. sauteed Sm.onion(sliced),1 clove garlic (minced), 1 can diced tomato(did not have fresh). spooned this on top of the fish, sprinkled with some cilantro for that extra kick.baked about 20 minutes at 350. Turned out great!

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe except that I added garlic and used provolone cheese and diced tomatoes. I also used mushrooms. My family absolutely loved this dish but I thought it was so-so. I will probably make it again sometime though.

This was good, but I made a few modifications only because I didn't have what was called for. I used black pepper and cayenne pepper on top of the fish. I didn't have green peppers. I used red onion, tomatoes from a can, and a little chopped garlic. Then instead of cheddar I used shredded Parmesan. I'm a new cook so mostly I make things up having, no idea how they'll taste. :)

I used 4 pollock fillets. I carmelized 1/2 large yellow onion cut into slices. I also sliced two button mushrooms, 1/2 red bell pepper, 3 green oinions sliced into super skinny little rounds, 1 roma tomato in thin slices in rounds, and 1 clove garlic. I cooked the red pepper in a separate pan until softened. Once the onions were carmelized I added the mushrooms and garlic to the onions and continued to cook them until the mushrooms were softened. Meanwhile I was cooking the pollock in the oven until almost done. I had sprinkled the fish with the paprika, pepper and some salt. 
Once everything was cooked to where I wanted it, I put the carmelized onion, garlic and mushrooms on the fish. Then I topped the fish with the thinly sliced tomato. I then put a hefty amount of parmesan cheese over that, then lightly sprinkled some finely grated mozzarella over that! Then I baked until the fish was flakey. I put the oven on broil and put the fish in the broiler. After I took it out I sprinkled the green onion on top. This was delicious!

Made this for dinner tonight.  Great choice being that I happened to have everything on hand and it was Good Friday.  Tasted great but I added garlic and mushrooms and also sauteed the veges before baking.  EXCELLENT!!!!  Especially with the hearty amount of vegetables!  Thanks for the recipe I will make this again and maybe even try pan frying the fish-just for fun!  Thanks again!  :-)

Excited to see a Pollock recipe on here.  I skipped the cheese and added garlic and olive oil.  Sauteed yellow and red peppers along with the onions instead of green peppers on a separate skillet.  Gave it a delicious Mediterranean/Spanish kick.

My goodness! This is awesome, usually finicky with fish, I love fish but hate fishyness, the fact this is a cheap fish i was nervous but it came out great! I didnt have paprika so i added "fish seasoning" with garlic Cajun and salt and pep. Also sauteed the onions first and then just added cheese and tomatoes. when I added the cheese I put a few squirts of lemon juice on it. I served with pan fried potatoes and carrots. Amazing dinner and cheap too!

i used garlic pepper, a bit of flaxseed for breading, and provolone cheese...and this was STILL bland.

I always rinse fish beforehand to get rid of the fishy taste, and I am kind of sad I did...I was longing for ANY sort of flavor!! The veggies were my favorite part.

Nice combination of fish and vegetables. I used additional seasoning on the fish (because I like it with a lot of flavor). I added oregano and garlic to the paprika and pepper in the recipe

I really enjoy this site and have found a large number of great recipes. This particular recipe was not one that I cared for. It lacked flavor in my opinion. I read the reviews and tried to learn from others, but I still couldn't achieve a taste that would bring me back to this recipe.

It was definitely edible. I also served with steamed veggies and rice. I used chile powder instead of paprika. I definitely think I need garlic to repeat this recipe. Also, I suggest sauteing the green peppers and the onion before baking.

This was really good! I read the other reviews and sauteed the onions and green pepper first and added garlic. I will make this again, for sure. I might add a little more seasoning next time, since there wasnt a whole ton of flavor to it.

I used cayenne pepper having no paprika and havarti cheese to balance the spicy seasoning. Fantastic! I pre- sautéed the veg first as many suggested - I used onion, red pepper and mushrooms with a layer of raw spinach between the veggies and the cheese. Fantastic!

This recipe would have been much more enjoyable had the fish not been pollock. This was my first time eating this type of fish and it was nasty!

Amazingly good, however I did salute peppers and onion (please do, you won't regret it. Provolone cheese. Next time I will lightly salt fish before veggie topping. Add tomato on top if you salute. Mm good.

Too much work for so little flavor. Sautéed onion and peppers per suggestions. Assembled and baked as directed. Taste was fair at best. Would NOT make again. Pollock is a good, reasonable fish that is easy to cook with much less fanfare.

I loved it! I will make it again. I made some changes based on what I had on hand. I used butter and stewed tomatoes with onions and garlic. I also used green onions. I baked frozen green beans in the same pan with some butter and garlic. It was really good.

15 minutes does not finish the meal... I let down my girl on my first night ever of cooking.... Pollock is a fishy tasting fish... this thing needs to be cooked forever, I think (not much of a chef myself).

I thought this was a nice change from the usual fish. Everyone ate and gave it the okay, but were so-so about having it again. I also added garlic and diced celery, which I did first on the stovetop with the onions.

Really tasty! I did add lots of extra spices including Old Bay, paprika, oregano, garlic, and also mushrooms, as suggested by many of the reviewers, and sautéed the veggies first.  I also used an Italian blend of shredded cheeses rather than just slices of cheddar. When serving, I had the shaker kind of grated parmesan which seemed to go very well with it.  Used a red  bell pepper and a green Italian pepper, rather than a green bell pepper, because that was what I had. The fish had sat in the fridge for a week.  I washed it carefully and dried it off with a paper towel before seasoning it in the pan on both sides and dotting it with bits of butter to round out the flavor.

Even without the green peppers this was delish.  I added my own spices like thyme, white pepper, and sea  salt also.

First time to use pollock, hoping it wouldn't taste too fishy.  It was great!  Very mild flavored white fish, the kind you can bake with whatever you have on hand.  I had a package of fire roasted vegetables, used that instead of the onion and bell pepper (pretty even exchange).  I think I could use spinach with a sour cream based sauce, or something interesting with lime juice.  Can't wait to experiment.  So try this recipe and then whip up your own version.  I think you will be happy you did!

Very easy to assemble... I did need to cook it about 10 minutes longer, but other than that I didn't change a thing... My BF really liked all the flavors, since Fish is usually pretty bland... Will make this again!!

Well, of course I didn't have all the ingredients, but truly enjoyed this recipe!  Even my husband complimented it!  I use the Pollack, onion,  mild thick and chunky salsa and shredded cheese.  Very good.

I actually doubled the recipe and baked it for 35 min.  It was a great supper one we will have again for sure.  I did add about 1/4 tsp garlic powder when I put on the paprika.

This recipe also works with fresh haddock.   I do spice it up a little and scatter a few chopped black olives over the tomato.  Also usually use swiss or Monterey Jack cheese and grate some parmesan over that.    This recipe is certainly a good base and can see where it would give pollock a bit more taste.

My whole family really enjoyed this dish.  I did saute the veggies in a blend of eevo and butter first, as some suggested.  Because several commented that it was bland I added minced fresh garlic, salt & pepper and rosemary to my saute. And in addition to the onions and peppers(red & yellow)I added mushrooms and in the last minute or two fresh spinach.  Seasoned the pollock with olive oil cooking spray, salt & pepper and old bay.  Then topped with veggies and a slice of tomato.  In the last few minutes I added shredded sharp cheddar. I think next time I will try another cheese as I didn't really taste the cheddar.  Maybe something with a stronger flavor like feta or asiago would taste better to me.
