Absolutely Delicious!  A great breakfast casserole to serve for overnight guests that will keep you with them and out of the kitchen!  I took the advice of others and used Ore-Ida Potatoes O'Brien.  I used one extra egg and 2% evaporated milk.  I used cheddar cheese vs. pepper jack. For people who complained that this was not "spicy" enough, it's a breakfast casserole it's not supposed to be filled with a bunch of spices unless you want heartburn all day.  This is a great recipe because of its versatility.  You can substitute another breakfast meat for the ham or put some in addition, add veggies such as chopped fresh tomatoes or mushrooms.  You could also change the pepper jack cheese to whatever cheese blend you prefer.  It's up to you.  I would suggest making the recipe once first then play around with it.  It's definitely a keeper!  I served it with fresh fruit, toast, and bagels.

I made this for brunch on Christmas morning.  I doubled the recipe using a 9x13 baking dish.  I also used O'Brien potatoes which I feel added a lot of flavor. The pepperjack cheese is a must--it really adds a nice zip to the casserole.  It turned out perfectly and everyone loved it.  It was also great the next day leftover.  I will definately make again!

I made this with potatoes O'Brian, added some sour cream and used spicey country sausage instead of ham. A little garlic powder and lots more onion turned this from bland to delicious. Thanks for the idea Lorrie.

Followed this recipe exactly as stated except I used 1/2 a grated onion instead of the green onions because that was what I had on hand.  This turned out just OK; not great but not bad either; just kinda ho-hum.  I usually make a breakfast casserole that uses crescent rolls and no potatoes that I love and I think I will continue use it instead of this recipe.  I think the combinatin of the evaporated milk and the potatoes gave this a strange texture that we did not care for.  Not really sure why the recipe calls for the evporated milk instead of just using regular milk.  This also took much longer to cook than stated in the recipe.  I had to bake it for an hour and 30 minutes before the center set up.  Sorry, this one is not a keeper.

This was really good.  My husband absolutely loved it!  He almost ate the whole thing by himself.  The only thing that I would do differently the next time I make it would be to substitute half of the Pepper Jack Cheese with Cheddar Cheese and maybe add more seasonings like garlic powder and oregano.

I cringe when I see the bread/milk/eggs brunch casserole recipes; so this was the ticket for me!  Made it on Christmas morning and it was delicious.  I used O'Brien potatoes (cubed frozen hash browns with peppers/onions), and it made it very flavorful and colorful.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  P. S. This recipe should be added to the brunch category!

I also add in cooked sausage, also you can use hash brown patties instead, just crumble.
*Here is my update on this:
I double this recipe using a 9x13 pan, using 1 bag of hash browns, cooked crumbled breakfast sausage, 2 C cheddar/jack cheese. Let this sit over night bake off in the morning for about 1 hr.

Made this for a Ladies Brunch yesterday.  I  followed  the advice of other rewievers and used the frozen Potatoes O'Brien instead if the regular shredded potatoes.  Akso took their advice and did not use the entire can of evaporated milk.  I generally don't measure when I cook so I just added what I thought was enough cheese to it.  We keep a kosher home so instead of ham or bacon I substituted chopped frozen (defrosted and drained) spinach. It was delicious.  Next time I will brown the potatoes first to give it that extra texture and flavor but it is going into the "keeper" file.

My husband walked in the door and said "What are you cooking - it smells good". I substituted shredded Cheddar and diced green chili peppers for the pepper-jack and added 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard to milk-egg mixture. It was good. A keeper.

I made this exactly as written, and my entire family loved it, which is unusual in my house.  I used cubed frozen hash browns, and the only thing I might do differently next time would be to roast the potatoes before putting in the casserole, to give them a little firmer texture.  Otherwise I won't change a thing.  Thanks for a "keeper" recipe!

A GREAT recipe!! The pepperjack cheese gives it a nice "kick" that some meals lack.  This is good for breakfast or dinner and my family always eats every last bite...never fails. I plan to use my leftover easter ham to make this again...and again..and again.  Thank you for sharing this with us Lorrie!

I like the idea of this casserole.  I found mine to be a little dry...(not quite sure what that means, but that's the best I can describe.)  I like the flavor though.  And since I didn't have any ham, I just chopped up some lunch meat and used that with good results.  I guess you could mix in a can of cream of mushroom soup with the potatoes before you add the rest of the ingredients.  That might give it some moisture.  Happy Cooking!!

I heart breakfast casseroles, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this dish.  I made 1-1/2 times the amount but kept the evaporated milk the same. That was plenty of liquid. I think anymore would have been overkill. I didn't really measure exactly on the ham and green onions; I just threw it on there, and that was that. The casserole turned out wonderfully.  The bake time was about 58-60 mins.  The second time I made this, I added double the ham, double the green onions, and a half cup Mexican style cheese in addition to all the other called-for ingredients. It again took ab 60 minutes to bake. Great recipe for the breakfast casserole lover. I think you will like this if you like hashbrowns, eggs, and ham!

Very yummy and easy.  I used russet potatoes, cubed quite small, since used what was on hand.  Doubled recipe as well.  So changes were....6 c. of cubed russet potatoes, 1.5 c. of shredded cheddar, 1.5 c. chopped ham steak, 1/2 c. Vidalia onion finely chopped, 1 clove of garlic finely chopped, 8 eggs, 12 oz. heavy cream, 12 oz. 1% milk, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, kosher salt.  I did saute the onion and garlic in butter before adding to casserole.  It came out delicious.  Would like to try with pepper jack cheese next time.  One note: if using fresh potatoes, chop small or will not cook enough by time egg is cooked.

I used leftover ham and omitted the green onions, simply because I didn't have any. Several reviewers mentioned there being too much liquid left after cooking so, with twenty minutes baking time left, I simply removed the lid and then sprinkled with a bit more cheese. After letting it stand a good 5 minutes, it sliced nicely. We all loved it, especially my 6-year old. He devoured his and asked when we are going to have it again. Will definitely make this again, thanks for submitting! *******Update******** 5/28 My 6-year old has been requesting this since I made it with the leftover Easter ham! I subbed bacon for the ham this time and he said he liked the ham better :) This time I used fat free evaporated milk and noticed no difference in taste. I couldn't believe how much fat was in regular evaporated milk! I had never checked before today :( Anywho, we love this...very simple to make and really tasty :)

I made and baked this the day before which made and worked well rewarmed the next day.  I made my own has browns with a cheese grater and browned them before adding the other ingredients.  Next time I will use regular cheese.

My family enjoyed this recipie, and it made for a quick weeknight meal.  I added onion, more garlic powder, a dash of paprika and some spicy brown mustard to the egg mixture to give it more flavor.  I also had a problem with it cooking completely, it was still wet and had to be microwaved even with a longer bake time.  Maybe using less evaporated milk will solve that problem?
Overall very good recipie!  Thanks!

This was delicious! I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 for 55 minutes. Used only 1/4 C. white onion, medium cheddar, and added 1/4 C. green pepper. Also I used frozen diced potatoes. The only change I would make next time would be to mix the potatoes, ham, onions, and green peppers together before topping with cheese and egg mixture. Tasty!

I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan.  I would like to try it next with perhaps prebrowing the potatoes some how.  While it was very good as written, I think it would be tasty with the flavor of the browned, perhaps slightly crispy potatoes

I have made this at least 9 times now!  Started out following recipe exactly, which is great!  Now, I also put cut up cooked bacon all over the top for a meatier recipe and add cooked sausage to the ham!  I put it in a big 9x11 dish w/more eggs and it feeds a crowd!  My entire family asks for this at yearly get togethers (I serve w/fruit salad).  You can do so much w/this - stick to recipe or spice it up, etc.!  It's fabulous!  Thank you!

This was a hit at my house!  I made it for dinner one night and my husband even ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning!  Everyone liked the spicy flavor from the pepper jack cheese.  Since we love cheesy food, I also added some grated cheddar.  I'm sure I will be making this again soon...possibly with leftover Christmas ham and any leftover cheese from the party tray, and maybe I'll try a few dashes of cayenne pepper sauce to the egg mixture for an extra kick.

This recipe rocks! Everytime we have copmany I make this and there is never any left over. Even my 8 year old picky eater loves it. I would suggest sticking with the evaporated milk and not substituting regular milk because it tends to make it a little watery.

This is a very bland version of what I enjoyed at home growing up.  Skip the pepper jack & go for a more flavorful cheese.  Or, follw my mom's lead & vary the ingredients by season.  In the Winter she would add in equal amounts ham, green pepper & onion with colby or mild cheddar for a Western casserole, in the Spring, she would blanch & cut up a pound of fresh asparagus & use muenster or sharp cheddar for Spring casserole.  In the Summer, it was well drained diced tomatoes & lots of onion & substituting bacon for the ham along with  sharp cheddar.  In the fall, chopped broccoli & medium cheddar.  This recipe reminded me of those wonderful eats of the past.  I had forgotten about them. 
 Since I have a pound of asparagus in the refrigerator and some extra frozen hash browns on hand,  I think I shall make another one using mom's flavors & this as a proportion guide for the other elements.  So, while not the tastiest recipe I have found here, this may prove one of the most adaptable.  If you liked it, but didn't love it, I hope you consider some of my mom's variations.

A little bland when following recipe but this is a very good basic recipe that can be easily tweaked to your tastes!

My husband and I thought this casserole was great!  What a great solution for leftover ham.  I used potatoes O'Brien which saved time chopping onions and served with a green salad.  The only problem I had was it took so long to cook - 1hr 15min in the oven and another 5 min. in the microwave??  Not sure what I did that it would not cook fully...but still yummy.

Oh gosh, this is really yummy!  As other's suggested I used frozen O'Brien hash brown potatoes; otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  Hubby and & I really liked it...I WILL make this again!  Thanks Lorrie for sharing this.

Family enjoyed this casserole.  I made as written, but added some red and yellow bell peppers that needed to be used up.  I did mix this recipe up the night before, let warm-up on cabinet 30 minutes before baking and rested 10 minutes when done baking before cutting.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and my husband even went back for seconds. Based on what I had on hand, I used 2% milk instead of evaporated and a blend of cheddar and mozzarella instead of pepperjack and used more cheese than the recipe calls for. I would really like to try it again with the pepperjack, though.

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 x 13-inch glass baking dish for 1 hour.  I used a 12 oz. bag of frozen hash brown potatoes with onion and peppers and a little more cheese.  It turned out great and I received requests for the recipe.  This recipe is a keeper.

Tastes good, but hashbrowns are mushy.  Will brown them first and then bake next time to make them crispier.

This was easy and delicious, I made it for dinner one night. I added a bit of fresh spinach leaves. Next time I'll try the Potatoes O'Brien that other reviewers have mentioned. Easy to make, tasty, great for a quick dinner!

Great easy recipe.  Didn't have evaporated milk on hand, so used cream of mushroom soup with a splash of skim milk.  Used Turkey Bacon instead of ham.

This breakfast casserole is much better then the ones with all the bread.I made this with American cheese and chedder cheese. We don't care much for pepper jack. It was really good. And it was a good way to use left over ham. I will make this again!

I loved this! The only changes I made was to use O'Brien cut potatoes in place of the Hash Browns, I added a can of green chills  and I used Canadian Bacon in place of the ham.  It was good on it's own but it would be killer breakfast taco filler too

Delicious!  I added garlic powder, oregano, and dijon mustard to the milk/egg mixture as suggested by other reviewers.  I also used nitrate/nitrite free packaged lunch meat.  My family loved this, even my picky 7 year old son!

Ok so I followed the recipe exactly and mine had to cook for 1 hour and 30 minutes before it was done in the middle.  By the time the middle was set the ham and green onions were no longer recognizeable.  I will not make this again.

I only gave this 3 stars because I made my owon version.  I didn't use green onions, because my family doesn't like them and instead of ham I used sausage.  Instead of pepperjack cheese I use colby and cheddar.  It turned out really well and my family ate it right up.

This is very good and very similar to another recipe I have that uses hash brown patties, ham, eggs, jalapeno peppers, and shredded cheddar cheese.  I increased the eggs to 6 and only used a 5 oz. can of evaporated milk and the casserole was still quite watery.  I baked it for another 15 mins., still watery, so I had to finish it up for about 4 mins. in the microwave.  I would say just eliminate the evaporated milk altogether.  My other recipe does not use it and it comes out fine.  Still a good recipe, however.  Thanks, Lorrie!

We love breakfast casseroles in our house and this one was delicious. Our biggest issue was that it  wasn't bigger! I look for recipes in 13" x 9" pans; this one was only 8" x 8". But I'm sure it would be easy enough to increase by half to fill a larger dish. Also, next time I think I may add some canned green chilies to it for a little extra spice. Hubbie loved it just the way it was though.  :)

It was fine fresh and pretty much the same left over.  I thought the frozen hashbrowns made the dish a little watery and mushy.  If I try again, I'll brown the hashbrowns before layering up with the rest of the ingredients.

I made this with leftover Easter ham. It is a very good breakfast casserole! I followed the suggestion from others and used the Ore Ida Potatoes O'Brien. I put the casserole together and then put it in my oven. It took longer than the recipe says to fully cook: about an hour rather than 45 minutes. I will also add a few more spices next time. A great base though, and plenty of room to improvise!

Great Dish - used 1/2 pepper jack cheese, 1/2 sharp cheddar.  Definitely use high quality sausage, drain thoroughly.  Super easy for weekend or holiday brunch.

I didn't have Cheddar cheese, so used mozzarella and pepperjack.  We all liked it, but I think cheddar would have been better.  Next time.

Yum.  I have a hash brown casserole my family loves but this really mixes it up.  I added some additional veggies to the original recipe and then made a version that was veggie only with peppers, asparagus, mushrooms, etc. and both are great

Yes, I used Medium Cheddar ( on hand) & 1/4 cup chopped Jalapeno peppers- it was fantastic & will do it again, next time I'll use pepper jack cheese & no peppers! Could also add  mushrooms, mixed veggies- the possibilities are endless!

After scaling the recipe down to just 2 servings, it seemed like a lot of work and time - for just two - but well worth it. We liked it very much.

Not bad. Used Ore Ida O'Brien potatoes as recommended, and 10 oz evap milk b/c that's what I had; used sharp cheddar and some red pepper flakes b/c that's what I had. Used turkey ham. Did take an extra ten minutes to firm up.

Someone made this recipe a couple of years ago for a potluck at work and it was awesome.  She shared the recipe with me for Christmas this year, and when we made it at home it was just as good; everyone loved it.  It is easy to make, not too spicy, and very filling on a cold morning.  (The directions call for a "2 qt" baking dish; in our house we call it "9x9".)

This is a favorite in my house and at my work potlucks. My stepdaughter hates eggs but loves this.  You can throw it together the night before and bake it first thing the morning.  It's also great as leftovers.  This is also easy to adapt by changing cheeses and/or meat.

Really good, simple recipe that went over well on a "Breakfast For Dinner" night. Thank you for a such a tasty recipe. 
Too much salt for my liking so I will cut back on that next time. (Making it again this week.)This time I going to use breakfast chicken sausage instead of ham. 
Changes:
Added jalapeno pepper flakes because we like zing.
Shredded my own potatoes for hash browns because that helped cut the cost of the recipe.

Suggest sauteing mushrooms and onions, and then mixing all of the ingredients together rather than layering.  Added some corn, garlic powder and oregano.  Took a bit longer to set in the middle. Maybe needed a little more salt&pepper.

I really did like it and will probably make again with some adjustments. As I was making it, I thought that 12 oz. was a lot of milk to add to four eggs.  My only adjustment in making this was using 5 eggs and it still took 1 1/2 hrs to cook.  Next time, I'll reduce the milk.

This is not only easy but delicious.. You could add a ton of variations if you wanted. I did make as is.. Pepper jack adds a little kick.. My kids tolerated the "spicy" but next time may try a different cheese.. Thank you for this easy delicious recipe!

This was delicious!  I forgot to buy the pepperjack cheese, so had to use sharp cheddar, but I was very happy with the result (so were my B&B guests).  This will be a regular weekend breakfast item!   I used Bob Evans potatoes (in the refrigerated section) and because they are already seasoned,  I didn't add the salt.  Glad I didn't since the potatoes already had plenty of salt for the entire dish.    Thanks for the post!

This was a very good light supper or brunch dish! I prepared it exactly as written EXCEPT I followed the suggestion of other readers and pre-cooked the hash browns until crispy prior to making the dish and added a bit of Dijon mustard.  Serve with fruit as directed or with a green bean or lettuce salad as I did. A keeper in my house!

I love love love this dish! I use 2% milk, sharp cheddar, some hot pepper, ground black pepper, loads of minced garlic, and onion, probably 6-8 eggs, and yes it really does take 1.5 hours to cook. But excellent, simple, easy to make ahead and freeze, and it is fairly cheap to make! I think we have this once a month or so at my house...good base recipe though...thanks for sharing

So easy and tasty! This may just become a tradition at our house. It was wonderful to just pull it out of the frig. and bake it! I doubled the recipe and I am glad I did our family of 6 was hungry enough to gobble it up this morning! I used cheese slices which worked out well.

My family found this recipe to be a perfectly filling Christmas breakfast.  I liked the idea of making it the night before, after my three little one's went to bed.  With a little help from my wife, we made a dbl serving, in a 9x13, added mushrooms and garlic, colby, and chedder, saulted the onions and mushrooms with garlic.  Will share this one with future guests, thanks.  Oh yea, skipped the salsa until serving, and added little Franks Hot for some pep.

This was very good. I don't know if it was the size of my dish, but I had to use 6 eggs to get the right consistency.

Pretty good, but needs a little more spice or something to jazz up the flavor. I added more cheese and a dash of garlic powder, but it still was somewhat plain.  Didn't have pepperjack, so used mexican cheese with some green chilis from a can.

Please understand that I had to totally change this recipe for health reasons. My husband is unable to eat a lot of the listed ingredients, so I had to substitute quite a bit, but this still came out very tasty. I sustituted 2 cans of diced potatoes(drained)for the hash browns, several slices of fat free swiss cheese for the pepperjack cheese, but also added some red pepper flakes for flavor, shredded chicken for the ham, 1 onion cooked in chicken stock for the green onion, 1 c. Egg Beaters for the 4 eggs, used fat free evaporated milk, and omitted the salt and pepper. Next time I may add some cooked spinach. My husband asked me to make it again soon.

This was ok but I won't be making again.  I think it was the potatoes that gave it a weird texture and I think I may have preferred cheddar cheese or maybe co-jack.

Very easy meal:)! I didn't have the green onions or frozen hashbrowns. Used dehydrated hashbrowns that I prepared and cooked before adding to the recipe. I also added 1 more egg. No problems with too much liquid, I actually overcooked it a bit :( . All three of my kids liked it.  Next time I think it could be better with more cheese, like others have written... Possibly try cheddar as well.

I made this for Christmas Brunch and it was super!  I followed the recipe and can't understand how anyone would have thought this was bland!   Everyone loved it and it will become a family regular for any holiday meal.

I took other's advice and added 1 extra egg. Also, instead of green onions, I added 1 can of diced green chiles. This was really good. It did need a little bit extra to cook, but it was delicious! My husband said he thought it needed more cheese, but in my opinion, everything could use more cheese!!!

I just tried making this for me and my boyfriend, it was pretty good! he liked it alot. I added 2 more eggs than the recipe called for, and I used alittle more pepper and garlic powder. Also i think next time i make this i'll use more cheese...i thought it didn't have enough! That was the only thing about it I didn't like, otherwise it was good!

My husband and I both thought that this recipes was really good. I made it exactly as the recipe stated to except that we doubled it ensuring that there will be leftovers. I didn't taste the pepperjack all that strongly and would probaby serve with some hot sauce on the side next time and maybe put some garlic and green peppers in the caserole.

Great Recipe!  I made it Thanksgiving morning for early arriving guests!  I made a few changes: subsituted with turkey sausage, used 1% milk, sauted onions, and topped with green salsa and sour cream!! I doubled the recipe can't go wrong with this one.

This was not terrible, but I won't be making it again.  I though it was kind of dry and didn't turn out anything like I expected.  It was also pretty bland.  My husband said he liked it but hasn't asked me to make it again so I'll take that as a no.

Made the recipe according to directions but found that even after baking 10 minutes longer than called for there was still quite a bit of liquid.  Everyone microwaved their portion so it wasn't inedible. The dish was very tasty but it definatly needs some adjustment in the amount of liquid used.

I really liked this, but thought it could use a little kick also.  Next time I'll use a little garlic salt and maybe more onion.  I had to bake mine longer also - the center had trouble setting.  I served this with a really yummy chili sauce on the side that gave it a little more kick.

I liked this recipe - especially the pepper jack cheese. A good way to use up leftover ham. The only thing I would change would be to add some chopped, green chilies.

This is an excellent breakfast/brunch receipe.  I added extra eggs and milk to fill the pan I used.  I made it the night before, that makes it easy.  The pepper jack cheese is essential because it gives the casserole its kick. While baking it makes the house smell great. Thank you, I will make this again.

This recipe is a good base, but needs several additions.  It doesn't have a lot of flavor.  Definitely not enough cheese.  I about doubled the cheese with cheddar in addition to the pepper jack.  I also added garlic powder, oregano, and ground mustard but it still wasn't quite enough.  Need to add salt and pepper and I would also add the green chiles that someone else suggested.  And I used the o'brien potatoes.  With those additions, this is a good make the night before easy breakfast meal.

I added a half of a fresh red pepper (chopped) on the top of this casseroel before baking.  Very colorful and tasty.  I think it would have been too bland without the red pepper.  Next time I think I'll add mushrooms and red pepper flakes to zip up the taste a bit.  Otherwise, very easy and great for a quick breakfast or dinner.

I found this quite ho-hum.  I thought the pepper jack cheese would spice it up a bit but it wasn't enough.  It was filling and certainly wasn't horrible.  Just a little bland for my tastes.

I made this for dinner tonight, and couldn't get
to my computer fast enough to offer rave reviews!
My very picky children loved this, as did my husband, but he'll eat anything!  It was quick 
and easy.  A great way to use up leftover ham, which until now, I've never known what to do with.

I made this twice so far, and it's delicious. The 2nd time I added 1 additional egg, added extra pepper jack cheese on the very top, and covered with foil in the oven for the first 30 minutes, and it was much more better

I have made this or a variation of this for many years. It is most versital recipe that can be made all year long. I usually use frozen hashbrowns, a whole onion ( diced ), thick sliced applewood or hickory cured bacon ( diced and cooked ahead of time ), shreaded spinach, and colby jack cheese. It's always a wonderful treat!

I had to add quite of bit of cooking time.  When I took it out at the given time, it was runny on the bottom.  After addition time in the oven, my family couldn't leave it alone.  My son put Salsa on it.  Breakfast is just not breakfast without Salsa around here.

I used O'Brian frozen hash browns and 4 Mexican cheese shredded cheese. Replaced ham with crumbled sausage. Doubled the recipe (except Evaporated milk)  Four adults polished off the 9x13 casserole.  :) It was most favorably received!

Excellent!  Doubled recipe to feed a crowd. Used hash browns with onions and peppers and also substituted Monterey Jack cheese instead of pepper jack due to young kids eating it.  I will definitely make this again!

I’m giving this a 3 star as is. I wish I would’ve listened to some of the reviewers and used the Potatoes O’Brien. To me this casserole was missing something-maybe the potatoes needed to be seasoned with something. Also, the bake time on this casserole is way off! I ended up having to cook it for 1 1/2 hours and then my cheese topping was completely browned and no good. Next time I’ll cook the casserole without the cheese and add it to the last 10 minutes of bake time.

I thought the hashbrowns should probably be on top and broiled at the last to be crispy.

Easy recipe, I took the advice of others and used Potatoes O’Brien. I added Hot Italian sausage to the chopped ham and used cheddar cheese  along with the Pepper jack.  Everyone enjoyed the dish.

This one is a  winner.  My son and husband absolutely loved it. I didn’t make too many changes. I didn’t find shredded pepper jack cheese, so I used slices instead and only one layer.  It was just the right amount of spice.  I also added some fresh chopped tomatoes and a red bell pepper. This was perfect, as I had leftover ham from Christmas and can’t think of anything better that I could have used it for. I will definitely be making this again.  I served oranges, blueberries and bananas to go with because it’s all the fruit I had and it went very well with the little spice from the pepper jack.  Thank you Lorrie for this one.

Made as written (except for pepperjack cheese, as it was for children. I used Colby Jack) and it turned out very nicely. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 dish. For adults only I might use a more spicy mix with jalapenos or chillies.

This was a great egg casserole!  I doubled the recipe and used 12 eggs instead of 8 for the doubled egg casserole recipe.  I also used a three cheddar cheese blend instead of pepper jack.  My whole family loved this!!

I added one extra egg, and used dried minced onion in place of green onions. Made this at 10am to have for dinner. Served with tea biscuits. Perfect size for 4 dinner servings. Nice to make ahead and pop in the oven after a long day of work.
Super yummy, thanks for sharing!

this was very good. I did add sauteed shredded onion and diced bell pepper and an extra egg. one reviewer mentioned that is does take much longer to bake than the recipie says and I agree. I baked it for a little over an hour.

Really want to like this but it takes too long to cook. This is my third time making it and it still takes 90 mins to cook!! Tried covered, uncovered, this time covered then uncovered and still takes too long. Maybe next time I’ll use less milk or use regular milk.

Thanks for sharing. I used grated cheddar and grated monterey jack since that's what I had on hand. Used O'Brien potatoes as others had suggested. I made this for guests and they enjoyed it, and went back for seconds! Success!

This recipe tasted fairly good.  My husband said it could have used some bacon, and I agree so next time I will add some bacon. The pepper jack cheese gives it a nice kick, but that may be too much spice early in the morning.

If I had the option, I'd give it 4.5 stars. My wife and I both really liked it, but would add more to it next time. Mushrooms and spinach, maybe some white onions in addition to the green onions. When I was making it I didn't think the pepperjack cheese was enough, but it ended up being just the right amount and gave the recipe a better kick than expected. Absolutely going to make this again!

We like this made in muffin tins, it makes 12 btw. Gives us more crusty part, which we love. I had Colby Jack cheese, which was a little mild. Adding cooked sausage or bacon would be good, as would browning the ham and regular onion.

This was really easy and good.  Just one suggestion, I would have liked the hash browns to be crispier and maybe would cook them first in the oven  till crisp and then filled with the rest and baked again, but nobody else seemed to care or notice.   They loved it.

I followed the directions, preparing it the night before and refrigerating until morning. I used regular hash browns and mixing in green onions and spices with them.  I used more cheese than the recipe called for and added lots of ham.  I also added cooked bacon on top prior to baking.  My husband and I loved it.  Very moist.  The great thing about this recipe is that it works with customization to satisfy everyone.

I give this 5 stars for how easy and flavorful this breakfast casserole was!  I would not recommend substituting fat free evaporated milk (like I did) as it took about 20 minutes longer in the oven to set up.  Next time I am going to try O'brien hash browns and leave out the onion which is in the O'briens... saving even more time!!!

I  used Potatoes O'Brien but otherwise made this exactly as written. My husband, who has never been a fan of breakfast casseroles loved this one! Next time I will layer it in a Bundt pan because I had trouble getting it done in the middle. We'll add this into our monthly rotation. It's so easy to mix up and has ingredients that I always have on hand. I served it with fruit and zucchini bread and it made a perfect Sunday night dinner! It will be great to have this recipe for when I forget to take meat out of the freezer. Thanks for sharing!

08/20/17:  Made for SS class.  I used a whole bag of hash browns, doubled the eggs, used shredded Monterrey jack cheese, doubled the pepper-next time triple, used 1/4 t salt and 1/2 t tony's-next time it needs a little bit more, added garlic powder-next time maybe add a little onion powder as well.  1 can of milk was plenty.

I was cautiously optimistic while putting this together last night as we are not really casserole lovers (at least not the way I make them). Since there are just 2 of us, I halved the recipe (more or less) and used a 7" Pampered Chef round pan.  I didn't have green onions so I added some grated Walla Walla Sweet onion. As a personal preference, I added some Dijon and sweet paprika to the eggs but otherwise followed the recipe.  This morning I baked it for 45 minuted and it was done even in the center.  I think the secret for getting this all the way done is to use smaller pans (9" or less).  The verdict: my 8 y/o thought it was too spicy but after adding a dollop of sour cream he enjoyed it.  I thought it was very good.  On my second piece, I added a sliced just-picked Roma tomato and a little fresh basil. That was also very good. Now, on my third piece... ;)

This was just Ok for me. I'm a huge fan of breakfast for dinner, but I found it on the dry side. Maybe I used too many hashbrowns? I added 2 extra eggs as well and more shredded cheese on top. I doubt I'll make this again.

I did 5 oz of  evap milk like most comments suggested then did 8 oz sour cream for the egg mixture....did potatoes o brian instead of hash browns. Turned out nice. I think im gonna do cream cheese instead of sour cream and heavy cream instead of evap milk to try a creamier attempt next time.

I absolutely love this recipe.  This is my favorite breakfast casserole.  With that being said, I think anyone that is making this recipe should consider whether the 1/8 tsp of salt is enough for the amount of food.  I found that the salt needs to be tweaked a little bit from 1/8 tsp.  (This, of course, varies among cooks.  So I don't use it when judging a recipe.)   I have made this recipe numerous times.  I am currently using about 1/2 tsp at this point.   I have also used Monterey Jack cheese as a viable substitute.   Almost anything would work.

This was very good but a little bit watery. If I make it again, I will probably add more eggs and less evaporated milk. Also, after pouring the egg and evaporated milk mixture over the top of everything, including the cheese, the cheese still got too browned . If I make it again, I'll mix the cheese into the casserole a little bit, or, cover with a loose foil tent until the last 15 to 20 minutes, or, simply wait until the last 15 to 20 mintues before adding the cheese. I had to take the hard brown layer of cheese off (it came off in a big slab) and I had to replace it with more cheese and bake it for an additional 15 minutes for the newly added cheese to melt.

I made this for Easter brunch yesterday, as I needed a gluten free casserole for my celiac guests.  I doubled the recipe for a 13x9 pan and roasted the O'Brien hash browns as suggested.  It didn't necessarily keep them crispy (they'd been sitting in liquid all night!), but perhaps it did add a bit of extra flavor.  I think next time I'll use more hash browns.  This recipe was okay, but everyone (who didn't need G/F) much preferred the Zippy Egg Casserole to this one.

To get a true layered effect you really have to add the different ingredients a bit at a time while the casserole starts cooking to keep items from sinking all to the bottom.

I prebake the hash browns for 20 minutes at  425.  I use  the pepperjack, but mix some swiss and cheddar with it.  I use regular milk or cream if I have it.  I make it that day, not the night before.  Then I bake it for 45-60 minutes.  To make it quicker I use the refriderated potatoes and pre cooked sausage crumbles instead of ham.

This one was not only easy to make, but it was quite a crowd pleaser too! I diced 3 cups of ham slices left over from a baked ham and used the refrigerated hash browns (as opposed to frozen per the recipe), sliced up some cherry tomatoes  and sauteed diced onion in place of chpped scallions (which I did not have). I also used 6 eggs instead of 4. It turned out delicious! This would also be a really easy recipe to adapt to whatever you may have around or leftover. I baked for 45 minutes without overnight refrigeration BUT my hasbrowns were slightly less cooked that I prefer. Next time I will cook for 55 mins or possibly longer if I make ahead. I generously fed 6 adults.

I doubled the recipe and used 10 eggs. Used Cooked sausage instead of ham, buttermilk instead of evaporated milk and topped with small can of diced green chilies and homemade salsa. Increased baking temperature to 365 and baked until golden brown and set. The increase in temperature and time may be because I live at 10,300 ft. It was really delicious. Everyone I served it to loved it!

I made this without making any changes. I really liked the fact that it made enough for two people with some leftover to reheat during the week for a quick breakfast. I will be making this again.

Best best best breakfast casserole and sooo easy. Didn't have hash browns so sliced some potato cooked it half way on a pan. Changed the veggies up a little, decided not use meat thou. Still amazing!!!  Used only 4 oz of milk. And it was still delicious. Wasn't watery, cooked perfectly at 20-30 min.  It's a keeper ????

I used leftover spiral ham, used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of evaporated milk (which I never have in my pantry).  Added some fresh sliced mushrooms cause we love them. Used the hash browns but might crisp them up next time.  I tried a different recipe using tater tots the following weekend, but this was definitely the better of the two. This is a keeper! Already have requests to make it again.

There is an optional step of refrigerating over night. Do it! I made it and served it on Sunday and it was good.  Although a little bland. Had leftovers the following day and it had become very tasty.

Made this for Christmas breakfast.  I added one additional egg and used O'Brien potatoes.  Took longer to cook than indicated (perhaps because of the changes).  Good but a little bland.  I will make again but will experiment a bit - green chiles instead of green onions and maybe try sausage instead of ham.  Thanks for the flexible and really quick recipe.

This is delicious! The only addition to the original recipe was some cayenne pepper to give it a little kick. I used some left over ham from Christmas Eve dinner. Double win.

Excellent!! Made this for my husbands out of town guest and they loved it. One dipped the potatoes in ketchup:) but they ate half the casserole between the two of them so to each their own.  Very easy & quick to prepare. I made this exactly as written. Can easily be adapted to your liking by adding various  vegetables or different meats. Next time, I may add an extra egg, mine were on the small side, to add more egg to the mixture. Definitely a keeper!!

Delicious! The first time I made it I substituted all shredded zucchini for the hashbrowns and I loved it! Also added 1 clove grated garlic in with the onions. Trying it again with half zucchini and half hashbrowns as the zucchini alone cooked down very flat.

So easy to make!!  My family likes things a little spicy so I substituted Jalapeño salt for regular salt and red pepper flakes for the black pepper.  Along with the pepper jack cheese it was just the kick we love.

Wow, this is really good!  I hate when people change up recipes but I didn't have ham and happened to have kielbasa in the fridge. Sliced the kielbasa into half moons and threw that in instead. Great flavor though I'm sure it would still taste great with ham. I've got to figure out how to make this over the campfire, I'm thinking this is a great camp breakfast.

Mine took a lot longer than an hour to cook. I added fresh diced tomatoes and used sausage and bacon instead of ham, potatoes O'Brien and sharp cheddar. The flavor was good but not eye popping. I think using the suggested pepper jack would have been better. I will probably try this one again with some modifications.

Very good, if a little bland. Used O'Brien potatoes as suggested and about 10 oz of the 12 oz. can evaporated milk. I probably could have used the whole amount and will next time. Had to flavor it up at the table with garlic powder and some hot sauce, but other than that it was a good recipe and I will make again. Consistency was nice and it was ridiculously easy and quick to prepare.

This was a great dish, very easy inspiring by adding spicy sausage also tobasco sauce to pick up the flavor.
Was not able to get the shredded pepper jack cheese in the store that was dissapointed.
This was very inspiring once again, heavenly delicious.

Delicious!! I used a little more than a cup of cheese. Also added about a teaspoon of Dijon mustard to egg mixture. Instead of the salt and pepper, I used 1/2 tsp. of my house seasoning which is salt, pepper and garlic powder. I thought it was excellent. Had a nice zip to it! Tastes much better after letting it sit overnight.

This casserole was very good. I didn't give it five stars simply because I think there was too much liquid.  Next time, I will use a lot less evaporated milk.  After reading some of the other reviews, I get the impression people were expecting a lot more flavour - perhaps because of the Pepperjack cheese.  This is not a mexican dish.  It truly is a breakfast type casserole, eggs, hashbowns and ham.

This was really good.  Mine took about 30 minutes longer to bake because of all the liquid.  I think this is a great recipe--good as is or you can change it up by adding veggies, different cheese, hot sauce, etc.

It was good.   It didn't blow me away but it was a good way to use left-over ham.  I had a leek instead of green onions.  I added more salt than called for and was glad I did.  I served it with picante sauce and sour cream to liven it up a bit.

This recipe is awesome! We cut the evaporated milk in half, added 2 tablespoons of green chilies, 1 tablespoon of jalapenos, then spred about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar the last ten minutes of baking. Yum! This is great for any meal of the day.

This meal was very simple and satisfying. My six year old daughter was able to help me make it. (She loves to help out in the kitchen) I did make a few modifications with good results. I added another 3/4 cup of hash browns, added one egg and substituted cheddar cheese for the pepper jack. I simply didn't have pepper jack on hand. The cheddar was still good. I also substituted a can of green chiles for the green onions and added a couple of dashes of garlic and onion powder. Everyone in my family loved it!

This was fabulous with the following changes:  I doubled the recipe (to feed my family of 5 -- big eaters) and used a 9X13 baking dish.  Because of the reviews of wateriness I only used 1 c of milk (after doubling of course) and baked for a full hour for everything to set.  To the egg mixture I added one can of green chilis and a handful of dried onions.  Everyone loved this, and it was quite filling (we had about a serving of leftovers).  Very quick and easy -- thank you!

I found this recipe really bland.  With all the ingredients, I would have thought that it would have had more taste.  Added some chile sauce to the leftovers and that woke it up some.  Will probably not make this again.

This was a very good recipe. I made few alterations to it. I used Cheddar cheese instead and omitted the evaporated milk. It turned out really good and the whole family (kids included) kept tellig me how good it was. The only change I would make in the future is doubling the batch because with a family of 5 I had no leftovers and kids wanting more.

My family didn't like this as much as I did. I thought the flavor was good and it was so easy. And that counts for a lot in my book.

This casserole was great. I added some green bell peppers and mushrooms, it gave it a wonderful flavor. It was almost like a breakfast casserole, my husband said I had to make this more often.

Very tasty and easy.  Everyone had seconds.  I'm rating it as a 4 because I had to make a few changes.  I only used a 5oz. can of evaporated milk instead of 12 oz. and I still cooked it for one hour.  I couldn't taste the cheese very well and so I added quite a bit more on top after it had cooked.  Next time I'll try sharp cheddar.

This was really good! I accidentally used green peppers instead of green onions, but I think I would like it better this way anyway!  Do cook it about 50-55 minutes and throw in more cheese, potatoes, peppers and ham, I think it absorbes more of the liquid this way.

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish.  I was not sure about the peper jack cheese but it added alot of flavor.  I might try adding sour cream next time.
