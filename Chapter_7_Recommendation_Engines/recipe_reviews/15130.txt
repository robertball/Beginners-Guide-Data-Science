This was OK, it was pretty average. I don't know too many people who would use 40 year old sherry for a salad dressing. It's not exactly cheap.

i used red wine vinegar for this and used it in another pasta salad recipe i found that i needed a red wine dressing for. when i tasted this i thought the basil was a little brave with this and would cut it down next time. other than that solid recipe really and the measurements ( with the exception of the basil) are pretty right on. thanks.

Kind of standard but better with the dijon; didn't care for the parsley addition.

I don't think it is an unreasonable gripe that since this recipe has nothing to do with Zinfandel, which is a variety of red grape, that it is not only misleading but incorrect to call this "Zinfandel Vinaigrette."  That said, I did like the 3:1 ratio of olive oil to vinegar, but the parsley and basil combo did not appeal to me. I substituted fresh dill and did add the optional Dijon. This was a good, but fairly average HERB Vinaigrette.

Really enjoyed this dressing reminded me of one I had at a local Cuban restaurant. The salad it topped was comprised of mixed greens, navel orange sections, julienned jicama and toasted pumpkin seeds, yummy! Couldn't afford the 40 yr old sherry vinegar, but I'm sure it would be fabulous with it. After I refrigerated it overnight, I did feel it needed the Dijon mustard for kick, so I added 2 tsp and that was just enough. Thank you Marbalet for sharing your recipe!

This is a nice dressing, and I bet that it would be really good with an aged sherry vinegar!  It could have used the Dijon for sure, and I wish I'd thought to put some feta cheese on these tomatoes before snapping the photo.  I did cut the oil to 1/2 cup because I like the zest of vinegar in my salads.  I am puzzled as to why this is called Zinfandel!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good.  Pretty standard, really.  I didn't have any sherry wine vinegar, so I used 3 parts tarragon vinegar and one part balsamic.  I used it on a salad very shortly after making this, but it definitely tasted better the next morning.  Will make again the next time I have shallots and a salad in need of dressing.

I like the addition of the basil, shallots and garlic to add some elegant flavor to the basic vinaigrette, but I personally don't care for plain olive oil type recipes. It tasted too oily to me as is, so I added a tablespoon of dijon mustard and a small squeeze of fresh lemon. I know some people eat foods with no more than a drizzle of EVOO, but that's not for me. Otherwise I really liked it.

I really liked it. Nice, tangy addition to our dinner salad. Easy to make too. :)
