1) 1-3 habaneros for desired hotness (personally I prefer three; but my wife prefers one); 2) The can of plain diced tomatoes should be drained reserving the juice; the juice can be added to the processor at the end of the second step pulsing the processor again if the salsa is too thick. I would like to thank Denise Smith of "D's Famous Salsa" for the original inspiration to dive into salsa making!

OMG this is gooood! I'm from San Diego and am really picky with my salsa. This is the real deal. I was a little apprehensive about all the 'heat' but it's not too much. I followed the recipe exactly! I'm looking forward to eating it after it has sat in the fridge for a couple of days - if it lasts that long! UPDATED 3/20/11 - I make this regularly and I wanted to send out a warning to others who are not used to working with hot peppers. You really need to wear gloves or be extremely careful to not touch anything especially mucous membranes after handling these inferno peppers. The first time I made these I didn't use gloves and I touched my mouth (Not the smartest I know but you can learn from my mistake!). At first the burning was really intense on my mouth but the tingling lasted for HOURS on my hands. Anyway I get asked to make this salsa all the time and I'm always taking home an empty bowl. Recently my husband's office rated some store bought and some homemade salsa's and this one won! I love this salsa! Thanks Jeff!!

I substituted 1 small bhut jolokia and 3 brazilian starfish (aka atomic starfish) for the habanero. Great flavor and nice heat. If you really like it hot include 2 small bhut jolokias. Be warned...using 1 bhut jolokia makes it too hot for 75% of people and using 2 bhut jolokias makes it too hot for 98% of people.

SO GOOD! This recipe is perfect for those who their salsas spicy and not chunky! I omit the carrot and cilantro (personal preferance). Be sure to drain both cans of tomatoes. If you like your salsa chunkier I'd only put half the can of diced tomatoes and half the chopped tomato in the food processor and simply stir the rest in afterwards.

Thanks for a great recipe...I didn't have a habanero pepper so I added a couple of chipotle peppers from a can in during step one. It turned out great.

Great salsa! I didn't have the carrot or green onion so I just threw in a little extra white onion. Also added extra garlic and used italian stewed tomatoes because that is all I had. AMAZING!:)

My husband loves this recipe and I don't use the carrots in it. I do use chili peppers Habanero peppers and jalapeno peppers. It's really hot when the seeds are in it which is the way my husband likes it. I do have one question about being able to freeze this or not.

Seemed a litttle salty to me but I may have measured wrong.
