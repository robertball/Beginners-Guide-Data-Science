The grocery store didn't have strawberry cake mix so I used vanilla cake mix and vanilla pudding mix, it was awesome!

I made this last night for a co-workers birthday today.  It is delicious!  However, I probably would reduce the oil to 3/4 cup.  I also added 2 cups of white chocolate chips -  yes, it's very sweet!  Also, I microwaved the remainder of the strawberry frosting and drizzled it over the finished cake.  Pretty as well as tasty!

I made a very similar cake to this before (Lisa's chocolate cake ~ from this site). The main thing with this recipe is to reduce the oil to just 1/2 cup (1/2 cup of apple sauce also works very well). I did add one cup of white chocolate chips and 1 teaspoon of strawberry extract and one teaspoon of almond extract.  I baked two of these cake for the guys at work and everybody loved it.  The cake had disappeared so fast.  The result was a very moist and flavorful bundt.  certainly be making this cake again.  Forgot to mention I used the Pilsbury cake mix.

This recipe and the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe are now my go-to recipes for cupcakes. They come out so perfectly moist, fluffy, airy, and light with beautiful flavor and they rise nicely too. I think I put my first batch (which I did vanilla instead of strawberry) in the fridge for like an hour or two, and they were even better afterward. Love!

Used Pillsbury strawberry cake mix with pudding already in mix, 1 cup of sour cream, 3/4 cup of oil (other reviewers stated), 1/4 cup of pureed frozen strawberries that were nuked in the microwave, 4 eggs, and 1/2 t. of imitation strawberry extract.  WOW!  This is going to amazing with my strawberry cream cheese frosting!!!

We have made Too much Chocolate Cake and yesterday tried this recipe but with Lemon. Everyone said this was the best lemon cake they have had. I frosted it with the Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting by Carol and it was AMAZING! These recipes will be a go to favorite from here on out.

I made these last night and I was very disappointed. They are so oily. The oil soaked through the cupcake liner. They taste like they aren't cooked fully.

Substituted applesauce for the oil as suggested and used low fat sour cream too. I found this to be an excellent cake that you can throw together in the time it takes to preheat the oven. Not made from scratch but customized enough to make it stand out. Had a nice crispy exterior and moist interior. The cake is not very sweet but the frosting gives it that extra sweet note. Will definitely make this again. Also will try the chocolate and lemon version.

I made this recipe as a layer cake instead of a pound cake.  It was quite good, but I thought it needed a bit more moisture so I split the layers and drizzled them with a sugar syrup containing two teaspoons of strawberry extract.  I iced it with a cream cheese icing to which I added the remainder of the canned strawberry frosting. I took the cake to a church function and received a lot of compliments on it.  It was very rich but did have a heavier texture. I think it is probably best served as a pound cake as the original recipe was intended.

Absolutely delicious! The best strawberry cake I've ever eaten. I followed the recipe, but when finished I microwaved the frosting and glazed the cake, which made for a pretty pink drizzle and didn't overpower with frosting. This recipe does NOT taste like it comes from a mix, but note that I used name brand ingredients. It is wonderfully moist and sliced up nicely without falling apart.

I used strawberry cake mix, vanilla pudding, cream cheese icing, and added a bit of strawberry flavor and topped with the remaining icing.

I'm truly sorry but I've never given 1 star before and have rarely given only 2. The flavor here is artificial and not much of it.

Love it. I also lessened oil to 3/4 c but added 2 heaping T of strawberry preserves to batter. Decorated the buttercream/cream cheese frosting with valentine hearts and sprinkles. Pay attention to baking time it’s longer than box recommendation and don’t open oven to check til around 50 min.

My 10 year old son made this for his grandma's birthday.  Great recipe for kids- easy to follow and turns out great!

I added 1/2 cup frozen strawberries like other did.  The cake itself was delicious and everyone loved it.  Next time I would probably just add powdered sugar to top - it was a little too sweet with the icing.   Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!!! Has become my husband's favorite, and he doesn't really like sweets.
