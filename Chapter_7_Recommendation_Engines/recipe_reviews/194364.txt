My young kids thought the cream cheese was a little overpowering but it was a big hit with all of adults. This actually surprised me given the simplicity and use of so few ingredients.    I think the combo of the cream cheese with the apples makes for a interesting flavor. Almost like it better than my current apple pie recipe. Super simple, looks pretty and not too sweet. I'll definitely make this at least a few more times this season.

Mine was tasty.  I only used 2 apples, and no whipped cream, so it was a hand held food, and really nice.  The cream cheese added the perfect creaminess.  I'd make it again.

Very easy, very tasty. I didn't bother peeling the apples and followed the recipe exactly...except I didn't bother putting any cool whip on top because it was great as is.

I was skeptical because it was sounds so simple but it came out great. The only changes I made was adding a little nutmeg and vanillia extract and I used half white sugar half brown sugar. I also left out the cool whip.  I really enjoyed the tart and creaminess of the cream cheese with the sweetness of the apples and the crunchy crust.  Even my picky eater husband loved it. This one is a keeper!
