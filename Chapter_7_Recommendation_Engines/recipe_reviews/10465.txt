These cookies were amazing.  We ran out of granulated sugar so we made a glaze with confectioners sugar and a little milk.  They were like little turnovers.

Turns out to be a very tasty, cakelike, old-fashioned cookie ... but set aside a few hours to make them.  I only got a dozen and a half out of this recipe, but they were well received.  Crimp gently with a fork.  Dough is tender and rips easily, but if you seal it with your fingers only they'll leak.

When I made this I must have made the dough circles bigger than what it is suppose to be but I can't imagine putting the pineapple sauce on anything smaller. I ended up with a dozen cookies. However, we loved the cookies. My husband took a few to snack on at work and his co-workers tasted one and asked him to have me make more!

I made these for Christmas '07 cookie trays.  I liked that the old-fashioned taste and appearance, but I'm not sure many others did.  The filling is reminiscent of pineapple ice cream topping, which I happen to love.  If you don't, you probably won't like these cookies either.

The recipe sounded great and I was trying to find some way to use a little leftover pineapple... Unfortunately, the filling just did not work for me. And that's okay, I had to throw out what was in the pan (it was like a big, gluey, hard mess!) but it wasn't a big deal. I had already made the dough, so I just did tablespoon-sized drop cookies. They came out so soft and yummy, very similar to the Carrot Cookies with Orange Glaze recipe my mother's been making since I was little but without the carrots and spice. Not too sweet, so my husband (who has no sweet tooth at all!) enjoyed them. Thank you, Jady, I WILL try the filling again one day!

These were okay. Kind of rubbery. I probably won't be making them again.  However, the plate was empty by the end of the night someone in my house must have liked  them.
