This works well for certain ovens.  Here is the fool proof plan!  After your calculated 500 degree blast turn off the oven.  In 30 minutes check the oven temp by setting it to bake at 325 degrees.  If your oven is below 325 and begins to heat up your oven either has a vent fan or cools off too quickly.  No problem.  Set it to 275 and leave it for the next hour.  You are now at 1.5 hours after the blast.  Turn oven off for the last half hour.  Perfection.  If your oven is over 325 one half hour  after the first half hour blast you should be good with original recipe.

This is a fool proof method for making the best medium rare prime rib. Your seasonings can be changed according to your preference, but what's listed works perfectly. It's the cooking method that is the key. It cannot be stressed enough, the roast MUST be at room temperature in order for this to work. If it is the least bit cold in the middle of the roast, you will come out with a very rare roast. A mistake I only made once because I was worried about leaving it out to get warm. Don't worry! It will be fine! I usually purchase 4.5 to 5 lb roasts and take it out of the fridge for a minimum of 5 hours to be sure it is room temp. It comes out absolutely PERFECT and juicy every time.

I know this is a culinary no-no, but we don't link pink meat, so while I partially use this method, I didn't do it exactly as Chef John suggests.
I had a 4 lb boneless rib roast, which I let sit out at room temp for 4 hours. While the meat was coming to room temp I also let my butter sit out to soften. I placed the butter in a small bowl, added about 1 Tbsp of extra virgin olive oil, 4 tsp of coarse kosher salt, 2 tsp freshly ground black pepper, 6 minced garlic cloves, and 2 tsp of thyme. (We don't care for Herbs de Provence.) I mixed this up with a fork then slathered the meat all over with it. I roasted the meat for 20 minutes at 500 degrees to get a nice crust, then I reduced the oven temp to 325 and continued roasting for another two hours. This gave us meat which was almost well done. It was still absolutely delicious this way, and perfectly flavored and juicy. Served with some twice baked potatoes and green beans. Perfect meal!

I have used this recipe for years and it works perfectly- ONE THING that will cause the meat to be less than medium rare, besides not having the rib at room temperature, is the fan in newer ovens!!  I had no issue for many years until I got a new oven in 2012.  Many new ovens have a fan that comes on when you turn the oven off.  It quickly lowers the temp, which, obviously, will not work for this recipe.  Since I have a built-in oven, I  actually shut off the breaker to the oven so the fan doesn't come on.  Otherwise you can just unplug it.  I guarantee that was the problem with folks who had theirs come out rare!

I was really skeptical - I'm a thermometer checker with my meats and keeping the oven off for two hours with the door closed about killed me! I had a 7 pound prime rib roast and with the exception of the seasoning (I make my own), I followed the recipe exactly as written - roasting at 500 degrees for 35 minutes and then oven off for 2 hours.  Turned out perfect.  My husband was beyond impressed.  I also made Chef John's Beef Au Jus.  A meal my entire family loved.  Thank you!

I wish there was an ability to give 10 stars! Chef John, I followed your directions... (except I was all out of Kosher salt so I only used sea salt, dang it)...and I got rave reviews. Due to having big eaters and more people than normal, I made an 11.13 pound rib roast and the directions worked for that big of an item. I couldn't believe it. Thank you so much. I have deleted the other prime/rib roast from my recipe box and now only have yours. Words cannot express my gratitude.

Absolutely, the easiest way to make perfect prime rib every time. But do not be tempted to open up the oven door until time is up.

OMG .. I have never been able to do Prime Rib correctly and I finally cracked it using this recipe. Thank you thank you thank you!  The only alteration I made was to do the math (# of lbs by 5 mins per lb) and then I added about 5 extra minutes to the total time (ie my roast needed 19.5 mins in the 500 F oven, and I did it for 25 mins) this was simply because I wanted some meat on the outside edge closer to medium (for me) and medium rare inside for hubby. The plan worked to perfection and gave us exactly what we wanted for a fantastic New Years Eve dinner. I have never been a huge fan of prime rib and this recipe has won me over. I'll prepare this again and again, a big hit!

(I might cut back on the pepper next time, but this wasn't a huge issue, just personal preference

I also made Chef John's Au Jus to go with this and it was incredible; like liquid gold as my husband said!

Prime rib was perfect, juicy and perfectly pink.  Followed the recipe exactly with a 4 lb prime rib.  Loved it!  Love the video to really get a good sense of how to apply the butter and herbs.  I'll be trying more of your recipes in the near future for sure!

I've never written a review here before, but I just had to for this. Today I cooked a 6.2 lb rib and it was perfect. The only thing different that I did was to use fresh Rosemary and Thyme, minced, and 10 cloves of garlic, minced, in the butter.  I didn't have Herbs de Provence, and did have the fresh herbs, so that's what I used. I'd seen the garlic idea from the Garlic Prime Rib recipe on this website. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly!  We do a rib for Christmas every year and before, it was a  shoot, it seemed, as to whether the roast would come out medium rare or too done. This recipe has changed that for good!!  The hardest part was not opening the door until the 2 hours was done.  Otherwise, it was easy peasy!  And SO good. I've attached a picture. Thank you so much for giving us a foolproof way to perfectly cook a standing rib!  As a few others have said, I'd give it more stars if I could.

UPDATE: Christmas 2019 and I'm trying this method in a brand new oven. I forgot to disable my smoke detectors, but the brand new oven door is sealed well. Still do not have a high-temp meat thermometer but again, with a brand new oven, 500 should be true. My roast was 4.03lbs so 21 minutes then 2hrs in 'off' oven. The roast is perfect!

Love this recipe.  But, I need such a big roast that I'm using two in the same oven. Does anyone know if I'm to use the roast time formula for just one of the two (they're both approximately same weight)?

I made this recipe last night for our Christmas Eve dinner.  I must say that I was extremely nervous because I prepared a 14.7 pound 5 rib roast!  Even though the recipe claims that the "math" is the trick, I was concerned that putting my roast in for 74 minutes at 500 was going to burn the outside.  Well, just to let you all know, it was perfect!  I was amazed!  My family was definitely enjoying the meal.  Thank you for making me look like a pro.  :)

I had a great result. Preheated to 500...(hint to the one that complained of a smoking oven, a clean oven should prevent this,  I learned the hard way lol.) My roast was exactly 5 lbs. 5x5=25 and I added 5 minutes to err to the side of caution.  Solid 2 hours later, removed from oven, set aside and lightly covered in foil while I made the "jus" that he also has a recipe for here. The meat was a perfect tender pink throughout and just delicious. The jus took it over the top. This was my first prime rib but it sure won't be my last. I couldn't have asked for a better result.

This is a perfect recipe.  My roast was almost 8# bone in....I stuck slivers of garlic in the top, rubbed it with soft butter, crushed garlic & rosemary....then topped that with kosher salt!  I will never cook this any other way!

We just did 3 18 lb standing rib roasts for a catering gig and people couldn't say enough positive things about this. Used my secret blend of spices but followed roasting directions and was the most tender, moist, evenly coked medium rare prime I have done in ages. Was a little afraid that wouldn't work with roasts this size, but a dream! Thanks, Chef John, you saved my bacon!

My family celebrated Thanksgiving with my wife's sister, while I shivered and shook with with some kind of crud. On Friday I followed the recipe and technique and was able to present a very good prime rib for the family.
Our oven is a good gas unit and the meet was a bit undercooked for all but me.  The next time I will increase the minutes at 500 degrees and make some changes in the seasoning.  
Tonight the leftover roast is simmering in the stock pot with potatoes, carrots, mushrooms and onions for a great beef stew for the family.

Our family actually learned this same method of cooking prime rib at 500 degrees, multiplying the weight by 5 for the minutes to cook, etc. from our butcher in Indiana back in the 1980s.  Needless to say, this method has been around a while. This recipe never fails and has served us well with Prime Rib for over twenty years...it's amazingly accurate and delicious.

I would truly love to give this the 5 Star Rating I was expecting to give when placing my two 8# roasts in the oven on Christmas Day. Unfortunately after the 2 hours we pretty much had raw beef on our plates. The flavor was great (I knew enough not to attempt butter at such a high temp for that long) and there was plenty of salt/seasoning adhering to the roasts so that wasn't a concern. The Au Jus turned out too salty ~ I wish I'd thought to use some wine to mellow it out before serving although noone other than myself seemed to think it was salty.  I can only conclude that the meat must have NOT been as room temperature as I thought it was after hours of sitting out. I will make it a point of trying this method again with another rib roast and plug in a remote reader digital thermometer to watch the interior temp during that 2 hours.  Good excuse for making another roast for my birthday, right? In our house, we choose our special dinner entree (or restaurant...)  hee...hee.... I'd love to be able to revise this rating with a 5. I'm giving it a 4 only because I'm assuming it was something I did that kept it so rare.

Chef John, if you have any comments about roasting 2 separate same weight cuts of roast at the same time, please let me know. There was enough separation between them to allow for heat circulation ~ I'm just stumped.

I was really nervous making this. First time I tried to make prime rib a few years ago using a thermometer I ruined a 143.00 rib roast. ( over cooked) so I  watched Chef Johns video and printed out the recipe and proceeded to follow it to the letter. This was AMAZING!!!! I could not believe how great this was. My mother loved it. My daughter and her fiancé really enjoyed it too. Thank you so Much Chef John you've  just gotten yourself another fan. I let the roast sit out for 6 hrs as suggested. And did the math for a roast that was 9.22 lbs. the hardest part was not opening the oven door. What a great way to make the perfect rib roast.. I did pull it out 15 min earlier because it was a big roast and was afraid if the bones got to hot might over cook. It was perfect. Pink moist and delicious. Also made the beef au jus from his other video. So easy and made me feel like a culinary king.. Thanks again Chef John...

I tried this recipe on Xmas Day 4 years ago after I read a dozen reviews so I made a couple of adjustments.  First, I did leave my roast out of the refrig for 6 hours before I cooked it.  Take your roast out at 9:30AM, wait 6 hours.  I started cooking at 4PM for a 7 lb 1 oz roast (bone in) that I ran longer than the prescribed time.  The calculation would have dictated 35 minutes at 500 degrees, I added 4 minutes for a total of 39 minutes and it came out a PERFECT MEDIUM (hot pink, very slight red center, with the outside being close to well done but nice and crisp).  Roast was on the table at 6:45PM.  During the afternoon I prepped the rest of my meal easily.

For me, I have now used this 8 more times since then as of Dec 1, 2017 with the following formula: 5.3 minutes for every pound of meat (bone in).  I have gotten a perfect hot light red/pink center with no blood every time (now 8 times).  Perfect outside color and even a bit warm when served after sitting 2-3 minutes before carving (don't microwave meat to warm it, it changes the texture and taste!).  I have roasted sizes between 5.6 lbs through 8.4 lbs without a problem - can't speak for anything smaller or larger than this size.

You MUST get your roast to room temperature before cooking for this timing and oven setting to work.  Also, if you don't watch the video, roast your meat with the "bones down" so the top fat layer crusts and crisps because it is exposed to the searing hot oven elements.

I hope this refinemen

Ok I had a 20.14 lb prime rib big one I was so worried. I followed the receipt along with the seasoning and cook time, yes had to do some math to figure it out 1hr and 30min in the oven at 500° shut it off and did not open till 2 hrs 30 min,  yes house filled up with smoke had to disable the fire alarms. Prime rib came out  perfect so delicious and medium rare. Rave reviews I had to share.

This is a great recipe....and I love the method.  I used some crushed garlic in my butter compound and also added a bit of olive oil to bring up the smokepoint.  At 500 degrees, butter smokes in my oven....but it is a bearable amount and if you have good ventilation, the results are well worth it!  Because I have a smaller electric oven, it cools a bit too quickly for this recipe. (which I knew going into it and the Chef's instructions are quite clear about a full size oven).  After my sear time of 5 minutes a pound, I reduced the cooking temp to 250 degrees.  Since I did not turn the oven off completley, I also let it rest about 20 minutes before carving.  I took a nine pound roast out at 134 degrees and it rose to 136 over about 20 minutes.  Meat was perfect.  Great recipe and easy to make!

Despite being skeptical, I made this for Christmas Dinner. I put a rub of butter and Montreal Steaak Seasoning instead of Herbs de Provance.  4.5 roast, 22 minutes at 500, then l hr and 40 minutes until the therm. read 130.  I took it out then as I didn't want to overcook it.  It was perfect.  I had enough drippings to make a thin gravy.  I let it sit out overnight and the internal temperature was 63.  I put bunjie cords on the oven door so I didn't open it by mistake.  It was amazing to me that the meat actually cooked with the oven off.  It was beautifully pink.  I will use this recipe from now on.
I can always rely on a recipe from Chef John.

I really wanted to love this.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Like another reviewer experienced, my smoke alarms went off which always scares all of us.  (Especially the dogs with their super hearing)  After 2 hours when I took it out, it was way, WAY too rare.  The only part that was cooked was the outside of it.  It also still had that wiggly consistency.  Had to cook it again the next day.  Was really awful, and we both like rare-ish roast beef!  Will never make this recipe again.  Sorry Chef.  Just wasn't edible to us and creeped me out looking at it.

This 78-year old (79 in eleven more days!) cook has made many rib roasts in her day.  This is the third time I have used Chef John's fail-proof method for preparing a rib roast and every one (from 3-6 lbs.) has been PERFECT.  I have been a bit more adventurous with my seasonings than the recipe calls for and the taste has been miraculous!  My almost 75-year husband thinks he has died and gone to heaven each time I've made this meal!  But it is the 5-minute per pound rule that is priceless!  There is absolutely NO guess work, you don't need a meat thermometer and the results are great each time.  I will never again make a prime rib with any other method!!!!  Thank you so much, Chef John, for this recipe and the many other recipes that I've "borrowed" from you.  You make me look good in the cooking department!!  (People seem to think I can cook!) ;-)

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!  As many other reviewers, I was also nervous.  I did however keep a meat thermometer in it while in the oven....one that has a cord to outside the oven so you can read the temp!  And I let it get to 120 and took it out of the oven. So it was rare, instead of medium rare.  Served it with his recipe for au jus! YUM!!!  Prime rib is at a local grocer now due to Easter.  I will be going back and getting another to make this recipe again! AWESOME!  And I did find Herbs du Provence too!  YAY! Everyone loved it!!! It is foolproof!!!

It was flavorful and tender- but it can't be emphasized enough that this will not work unless you bring the roast to room temperature.  I ended up with an extremely rare roast that was cold on the inside- I love rare but I definitely don't like cold meat!  My guests wanted medium rare and it was a hassle trying to microwave everyone's plates- plus it ruins the beef.  Also, I am very reluctant to leave any meat sitting on the counter until it is room temperature.  In summary, great taste but does not cook as presented in the recipe unless you warm the meat first- and you do that at your own risk.

Perfect, and so easy. Echoing other posters, do not open the oven, not even just a tiny crack. Highly recomend watching the video; even though the recipe is simple, there are a some very helpful hints (such as the salt...) I used pepper and rosemary in the rub. My roast was still a tiny bit frozen in the center, so I increased cooking time by 10%  (33 minutes vs 30) and that did the trick. 

Also made Chef John's au jus which is simple and very delicious. Thanks, John for a wonderful Christmas Eve meal!

This recipe has totaly become a staple in our household and has a place on our Christmas table.  I do have to admit, I was terrified the first time I cooked it. But as long as you follow his instruction to a t,  yours will come out perfect like mine did.

This recipe is all about the method.  If you don't like the salt, butter, etc.,  season it the way you want.  But if you want a perfectly cooked prime rib...follow this method.  I've cooked our Christmas Eve Prime Rib four times, and this method worked best for me.

Also, note:  the same method works no matter the size of the roast. I usually cook for 20-25 people so I use the full rib roast - 16 to 18 lbs.  Multiply by 5 and I'm putting that baby in a 500 degree oven for  80 to 90 minutes!

Also...very important.  Getting the roast down to room temperature is crucial for this to work!  Seems weird to have a slab of meat just sitting on the counter for 4 to 6 hours, but you have to get the internal temperature to a good starting point. Don't worry, it won't go bad.

I have a new Electrolux Induction stove w/convection oven and I guess it's better insulated than most because I had to pull the roast out at 1:15. when it had already hit 135 degrees and was climbing.  Instead of medium rare the prime rib was medium well / well done.

Thank You Chef John, I' m so impressed!  I made a Standing Rib Roast (4 bone - small end) according to your recipe for Christmas Eve and my Husband is still raving about it!  When we sliced the roast my guests ooh'd and ahh'd then proceeded to devour it and raved about how tender and juicy it was. I was a little aprehensive not only about cooking the roast for the such a short period of time (7.59 lb. roast - 38 minutes @ 500 degrees) then turning the oven off, but by also leaving the roast at room temperature for 6 hrs prior to cooking. (A must!!)   I cooked the roast according to the recipe and the roast came out a perfect medium rare.  I did use a digital thermometer (just to be on the safe side) and I watched as the internal temperature started to rise and after two hours the temperature was a perfect 134 degrees!  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this recipe to anyone. Honestly, you won't be disappointed....perfect with Chef John's Au Jus recipe.

Amazing! I used a boneless roast but the color and flavor was perfect.  Next time I might cut back on the salt. It was great and very flavorful. The video was a great primer on how to do this.

OMG I had a 2.5# bone in prime rib roast and used the 5 minute per pound thing for the first time - genius!!!   The last time I cooked a small roast like this it was totally overcooked (using another recipe) so this one was definitely a welcome success!!!   the only way I will cook prime from now on!!!

best prime rib we have ever tried. We have made many recipes and this one always turns out amazing. the secret behind this roast is NOT OPENING the oven door and calculating the proper cooking time/pound

I've enjoyed Chef John's recipes in the past but this one was a total failure.  Followed the directions exactly as written but the rib roast was well done.  Wasted a $80, a beautiful 6.5 lb prime rib and ruined Christmas Eve dinner.  Stick with a meat thermometer!!

This is a very old and great way to make ANY beef roast, not just a prime rib.  I've been doing them for years and I'm over 80!!  And a good au jus is with water, beef broth base, a little soy sauce and butter.  Add the juice  from the cooked roast.  Another old recipe!

Loved this recipe.  17lb Prime Rib came out perfect with the appropriate adjustments (for size).  Made it last year and again this year.   Going to  add fresh minced garlic to butter mixture.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this yesterday for Christmas dinner and it came out perfect.  I placed the 5.20 lb. roast on a plate for 4½ hours to allow for it to get to room temperature. The only thing I did differently for the butter mixture was I used garlic powder instead of the herbs de Provence because I did not have any of that. I cooked it according to the guidelines stated in the footnotes section of the recipe. My 5.20 lb. roast cooked for 26 minutes (5.20 x 5 = 26) in the preheated 500° oven.  I then shut off the oven and let the roast sit in there for 2 hours.  It came out looking perfect and it tasted wonderful. This will definitely be the recipe I will use in the future.

Hands down, the best way to cook a prime rib. I too was real nervous the first time, but the moment you slice into perfect prime rib, you will be sold! I have an older oven, and understand what Chef John is trying to tell us. Having said that, I have been cooking long enough with that particular oven, that I am confident in where to set the dial. What I also do is to throw the self-cleaning lock lever. I find that not only reminds me not to peek, but also keeps a tight seal on the door! Thanks again, Chef John, for another amazing recipe and technique!

I tried this on a dry aged rib roast prepared as shown on ATK for 5 or 6 days.  Without trimming I left the roast out for about 8 hours. I put on the rub, preheated the oven to 500 for a couple of hours and then used the 5 minutes times my 3.7 pound roast after aging.  It had lost nearly .5 pounds.  After 17 minutes in the 500 oven I turned off the oven.  In less than an hour, 56 minutes, in fact the probe thermometer went past 117 degrees.  I was baffled.  While decision making, it passed 125 when I pulled it from the oven and wrapped in aluminum foil after pouring of the drippings which I intended to use for roast potatoes and Yorkshire pudding a la Anne Willen.  The temp continued to climb until it reached 144 or so and I knew my dream of rare roast beef was gone.  What could I do.  Just waited.  It quit climbing soon after and was about 125 when the potatoes and Yorkshire pudding were done.  Both were fantastic and I made a red wine sauce with what was left of the fond and fat.  I cut off the bones and sliced.  It wasn't dark brown but there was only a hint of medium in the middle slices.  The edges were tough but the rest was pretty tender and the fat was tasty but still not the roast of my dreams.  I have made rib roast many times using varied techniques such as all the way at 250 and a blast at the end and a 350 with a digital insert and this was the most disappointing.  Maybe I messed up the science with the dry aging or let the oven cure too long???

Never going back!  I had a 10.8 lb prime rib, so wasn't really sure about this. 54 minutes at 500 - turned the oven to 125 (didn't know if I would have the fan problem mentioned by others, so played it safe)  - perfect!

I did my own spices, but followed the temp/cooking guidelines.   I followed someones suggestion of turning off my oven via the breaker due to the oven having a fan to cool it quicker.    I must caution (especially since I have a repair man here as I type) when using this method.  By turning off the fan, the oven was at a high heat for too long and ended up burning up a thermostat thingee (sorry if that is too technical, lol) and the now there is still a problem with the buttons.  Waiting to hear how much that will cost.  So yes, roast turned out AMAZING, but be careful not to burn out your electrical components.  Who knew?

I just made this for my family for Christmas Eve dinner! It was fantastic. I had a 7.5 lb roast. It was a little rarer, so maybe a few more minutes at 500 would have been good, but everyone loved it! I wish there was more left over for French dips tomorrow! It was difficult to trust the recipe and not open the oven door, but I prevailed and it was well worth it! Best prime rib I've ever made!

My husband I made this while my beef loving brother was visiting us. We took great care to make sure it was at room tempurature. It was 13 lbs and we took out of the refrigerator at 7am and did not hit room temperature until 5pm. We dry aged it for 5 days covering with cheese cloth the first day and new cheese cloth used days 2-5. It was a group effort  my brother made roasted garlic mashed potatoes and I made asparagus with hollendaise. The prime rib was incredibly moist and juicy. This was the 2nd time we had made it and plan to make another one for Christmas next month.

Ok i was a serious skeptic. My 50 dollar roast and a house full of company what could go wrong. I made the marinade from the garlic prime rib. Did exactly as this recipe said. 30 minutes for my 6 pound roast, shut off the oven and waited 2 hours wondering the whole time if it would work  Without a doubt the roast was spectaclar. Beautiful  crust on the outside, perfect, pink in the middle and so juicy and tender. I wont do it any other way ever again.

Used a 7 lb. roast and directions worked perfectly. I had my kids over for Christmas dinner tonight and we couldn't be happier. I made Chef John's twice baked potatoes as well as his au jus recipes so the whole meal was fantastic.

perfect. We use 7 min/lb. and it comes out a little better than med. rare. We only do it this way now. Wait for prime rib roasts to go on sale and buy about 4. Even turn out great once they are thawed and room temp.

6 lb. roast came out perfectly!  I did cover the burner over the oven vent with foil and put a pan on it to hold heat in once the oven was shut off.

The flavors are great, but the cooking method will leave the meat very rare. if you like really rare meat, you're going to love this recipe.  Otherwise, after the initial cook time at 500°, turn the oven down to 350 for an additional 30 minutes and then shut it off for the remainder of the suggested cook time.  I did it that way and the meat came out a perfect medium rare to medium.

We have new oven with fan - simply adjust temp to 250 after the 500  timer. Worked awesome for us. No fooling around to keep eye on multi temps, no need! Just pop roast in oven at 500, then change it 250 after the 500 cooking time. Walk away for 2 hrs. Enjoy your family until the time is up. Worked perfect for rare-med rare of 8 lb roast.

I made a 15 pound roast using this method and it turned out amazing!!  (Second time making rib roast with this recipe)

I was skeptical about cooking at 500 for 74 minutes, but I trusted the recipe and reviews.  I received a huge number of compliments about how great the meat was

Turned out perfect again, thanks

I will use this recipe every time, thanks for sharing!

Wow. I made this for New Year's Eve and it was spectacular. By far the best roast I have ever made. Cooked it uncovered and of course fat side up. Did an 8 lbs prime rib and followed the recipe exactly. I resisted the urge to check on it. That was the hardest part.  I was nervous because after an hour of turning off the over, it no longer felt warm. It came out a perfect medium rare and wonderfully warm. My guests thoroughly enjoyed it and asked for the recipe.

Unreal. Spot on fool-proof method to make the best meal you'll ever eat. After I rubbed down the roast with the herbs I draped 3 or 4 pieces of bacon over the roast before I put it in the oven.  Follow cooking times shown. AMAZING RESULTS!!!

Tried this recipe for the first time for new years day dinner. Turned out perfect!! I did purchase a oven thermometer and checked the accuracy of my oven. My oven is over 23 years old and I had some concerns but to my surprise it was right on!  My prime rib was 7.71 pounds so I cooked it for 40 minutes and shut it all off and continued like Chef John said for 2 more hours! Final results, perfection! I have never cooked a prime rib in the oven. I have always cooked it on my Farberware Rotisserie. I was a little concerned but everything went well. Next time though I will use the seasonings we are use to using and love some much. Instead of the Herbs de Provence I will use Quebec Steak Seasoning. That will be the only change. 
Once again thank you Chef John for another perfect recipe!!!

My roast was a little underdone.  It was hard for me to gauge this because I cooked two 6 pound roasts.  I didn't want to calculate the roast as if it was 12 pounds, because they were 2 separate roasts but cooking them for the 6 pound times was not enough either.  Flavor was awesome though!  Can't wait to try again.

I TOTALLY forgot to set this out to bring it to room temp. in time!!!  I had it setting out for only about 2 hours.  I had a 8.27 lb roast.  I used a rib roast that already had the ribs cut but then tied back on.  I really like that it saved time cutting them off later.  So back to forgetting to set the roast out.  I did my best to bring it up to room temp. by putting it on the radiator.  So my roast called for 41 min. I did 45 to make up for the other oops and when there was 20 minutes left of the "resting" time I turned the oven on to 375.  My party likes theirs a little less rare so I cooked it for about 25 minutes.  It was super juicy and just right with enought pink in the middle for the rare folks.

OK; I was a bit skeptical about this recipe.  I had a beautiful 10 lb Prime Rib Roast and didn't want it to flub since I was entertaining my inlaws and all.  But man-oh-man....this has got to be the most "full-proof" way of cooking prime rib.  My roast came out just perfectly cooked--beautiful medium rare color.  Everyone raved about the flavor.  I also made Chef John's au jus and it was a "Wow"!  Thanks Chef John.  This recipe will be a definite keeper, for sure!!!

Chef John's recipe appealed to me because I could predict the timing of the roast ... and hence, the timing of our dinner! The roast, removed after 2 hours in the closed oven, registered a perfect 130 degrees. Unfortunately, our guests arrived 45 minutes late. I watched in alarm as the temperature continue to climb, and by the time everyone had arrived, my perfectly cooked prime rib had reached 142 degrees F. So imagine our delight to slice into that roast and find that it was still pink and juicy! Even the end pieces, which had no pink at all, were amazingly tender and moist. 

I served the meat with horseradish sauce and Chef John's delicious, easy au jus. Everyone gave the prime rib 5 stars! Today I pressure-cooked the rib bones to make bone broth for prime rib soup. Great way to use up that one slice of leftover meat!

This recipe will not work if you have an oven with a fan that cools it. I cooked my seven pound roast for 35 minutes at 500 degrees. When I checked after a half hour with the oven off, my oven was below 325, so I set the oven on 250. It took about  2 1/2 hours all together. Make sure you use a meat thermometer. My roast was perfect. I let it rest about 15 minutes.

I made it using a 17 pound roast. It came out  perfect. I used a Oster 22 qt. Stainless Steel Roaster oven. Place it outside in patio 475 degrees ( max setting) for 85 minutes. Turned oven off and let roast sit for 2 1/2 hours. This prime rib was the best ever. Using this Oster 22 qt which cost me 35 dollars was best for cooking this outdoors. No smoke or smell in house.

The roast must be a room temperature before you put it in the oven and do the calculations to the exact pounds and your roast will be perfect.  I cooked a 10 pound roast
Everybody raved about how tender and pink it was.  Kudos to chef John

Made it for Thanksgiving dinner, arguably one of the most high pressure meals of the year. Was a little nervous that I'm trying a new recipe but decided that all the reviews couldn't be wrong. I bought a 7.17 lb roast from Costco and followed the directions to a T. Baked for 36 min at 500 and then turned off the oven and let it soak. Upon cutting, you immediately notice it’s a very uniform medium rare throughout the entire roast, even when comparing the sides of the roast to the very center of it. Some of the other traditional methods don’t get that, it’s probably more similar in results to a reverse sear method of cooking. All in all, it turned out perfectly. Like others have mentioned, it will smoke a bit so open windows and turn on fans. .

I have made this before, following the instructions exactly. It turned out good, but was a little too bloody for my husband.'s taste. After looking through some of the other reviews  i decided to try leaving the oven temp on low (200 deg) for the 2 hours after searing the roast (4.98#), for 25 minutes. This cooked the roast to medium (pink), and kept it at a nice warm temperature for eating. Turned out fantastic, and was delish! This worked out well for us. I did set off the smoke alarm during the searing process, so make sure your oven area is well ventilated!

IT WAS PERFECT!!!! The 8.32 prime rib I got for Thanksgiving this year was crazy expensive, so I HAD to get it right.  Chef John's equation worked perfectly.  Thanks for making me love math, Chef John!  We ate that thing for four days.  Four heavenly days.  Oh, I only had fresh thyme, not the fancy French herbs.  Made a compound butter with it and it worked like a charm.  A yummy, yummy, charm.

Followed this recipe exactly and the prime rib turned out absolutely perfect!  I think it's the best we've ever had!  The only problem I encountered was the smoke created from the butter cooking at such a high heat.  We had to open the windows and air out the house - not so fun.

Followed directions and had beef out 6 hours. I used a less then 3 pound roast - was nervous that it wouldn't work as it was so small. It came out a perfect medium rare.

Very good.  It is hard to trust the formula but it works.  Do not peek.  The first time I tried it my son opened the door and I had to re-do a little time.  The second time I did the roast with a much smaller cut it came out perfect.  I warned everyone in the house on "pain of death" not to open the oven.

This is the absolute best prime rib ever! I cooked it for early Christmas dinner and everyone said it was better than steak house prime rib. I added a little garlic, and white pepper to the butter herb blend. I was so surprised at how well it cooked. The perfect rare all the way through. The ends were "NOT" well done with the middle too rare it was just perfect all the way through. If some people like more well done you can boil a piece in auju juice.

Just perfect!!! If you want, you can cut the ribs off first, but be sure to reweigh the roast for cooking time. Stick to the formula of 5 min. per/lb. and DON'T OPEN THE OVEN DOOR for 2hrs, and this will be the best prime rib you have ever had! THANKS CHEF JOHN! BEST CHRISTMAS DINNER EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was amazing! I was not able to find the herbs needed so I purchased a special prime rib mix, and blended it with the butter. It was SO hard not to open the oven lol! But im glad I didn't. This was cooked to perfection, and my husband and I enjoyed every bite!

Absolutely my favorite recipe !!! My family loves the perfection, tenderness & taste of this delicious prime rib. Make certain 100% certain you follow the math otherwise you can over cook & dry it out. Tip (save the lbs from the wrapper)

I'll admit, I was a wee bit nervous - not only was I cooking a $150 piece of meat, I was serving it to my in-laws for Christmas dinner.  I followed the directions to a "T" and even taped the oven door shut with blue painters tape to make sure no one wandered by and decided to take a peek.  Once again, Chef Jeff didn't disappoint - the meal was fantastic! As my mother-in-law said, it was a meal to remember! (note: I served it with the au jus, goat cheese mashed potatoes, sautéed cherry tomatoes, and string beans with shallots)

I had a 4.5 lb rib roast and followed this to the letter.  My roast was beyond well done, inedible.  Very disappointing end to an $80 piece of meat for Christmas Eve dinner.  I am not an amateur cook either - I just don't know what went wrong.

I followed the directions to the letter and my roast turned out overcooked. I am not sure if I would change the cook time or reduce the post-cook time. However, I would never waste another expensive roast following this recipe.

Exceptionally easy and absolutely foolproof.  I've made this several times.  Present it whole to your dinner party and slice at the table.  The visual is outstanding.  

I've made this with several preparations for the seasoning.  It all depends on your family and guests preferences.  I used a garlic paste-type rub from Emeril Lagasse's website last time and it was a huge hit - and smells wonderful while cooking.

Only downside is not being able to use the oven for other dinner items.  I planned dinner around it and used my BBQ grill as my second "oven" to roast potatoes.

The cooking time to weight ratio is perfect....I don't use the butter method but do rub it down with lots of garlic salt, pepper, salt, candian steak seasoning and a bit of rosemary.
also like to layer the bottom of the pan  with a healthy bed of ruff cut celery, onion and carrots which comes out unbelievably delicious.
I am wondering doing this with a whole strip loin. Any feed back on that would be great.

Don't usually cook such small roasts but happened to end up with 2, 4-ish lb. roasts, both 2 bone. I've made this many times but last night used a higher roasting pan with a wedge rack inside. Honestly just used seasoning salt (Hy's) with extra fresh cracked pepper after butter rub. These two roasts cooked together and turned out amazing! I was amazed at how perfectly medium rare they were with a narrower band of crust than the usual larger roasts cooked using this method: more red/pink. These cooked on the rarer side of medium rare, our perfect preference. Yummmy! This is a perfect roast for two. You each get a rib, some sliced prime, and enough for full leftovers the following day!

I made it twice -- once with a HUGE prime rib (7 ribs, approx 20 lbs) and the next time with a tiny 2-rib roast.  I followed the directions *exactly* and both were superb!  Perfect both times.

I cooked a 13lb Bone-in prime rib for Christmas Eve dinner.   I was a little nervous about cooking on 500 for over 60 minutes but after reading other reviews with the same concern my nervousness subsided.   This is the best prime rib I have ever had!!!   There are some reviews that said it did not turn out (mostly still raw).  Check your oven temp with a oven thermometer to ensure your oven is heating properly.  Then keep a probe in the meat and set the alarm to 130 degrees.  There is no way you can mess this up.

Easy and Perfection! I was a little hesitant about this recipe, with the cost of the roast you don't want to screw it up! But it was absolutely perfection!  Chef Johns note on the initial cooking time for whatever size roast was spot on. I cooked an 8 lb roast at 500 for 40 min and then turned off and left alone for 2 hours. There will be smoking at this heat, but didn't get bad until the last 20 min. and even then, the smoke alarm didn't go off.  Just be sure to have your vent on. Everyone raved at how perfectly cooked it was. Even the end pieces were med. rare! While resting, I made Yorkshire pudding which is always a nice accompaniment to the rib roast.

I followed the recipe exactly with an 8.28 lb rib roast. I cooked it for 42 minutes @ 500 then cut the electricity to the oven (my oven has a fan that helps it cool down faster which seemed to be a problem in some other reviews I read). Left it in for 2 hours then removed and sliced for eating. The roast was medium-well! My guests ate some of the roast but we gave away the leftovers (and there was quite a bit left over). Very disappointed..

I hate when people give a recipe a bad review and they had changed it completely.  I am not going to do that.  I followed this recipe to a "T" and it was almost raw when I served my Christmas dinner.  I love medium rare and can even do rare on occasion,  but even the outer piece was too raw to eat, thus ruining my Christmas dinner.  The roast was out of the fridge for 10 hours, I added 5 mins to the cook time and I did not touch the oven door.

Now I will also say that after an additional hour+ cook time, the meat was the most delicious prime rib ever.  The favor and crusting were to die for. (5+ stars!)  In the future I will prepare my prime rib this way and cook it at 500 for the required time per this recipe, but then I will lower the heat and trust my meat thermometer!

I used the math, and yes, I have a good oven.  The result was a very under cooked center, that in order to serve to guests, had to microwaved!  Fortunately it was an unseasonably warm Christmas day and I was able to leave my doors and windows open to allow for all the smoke to be vented out of the house from the 500 degree searing step.  The flavor was good, but I'm not sure it was any better than the usual low and slow method I normally use.

After YEARS  of making SUCCESSFUL prime rib, this recipe does not work. No, my oven has no fan. Yes, I let the meat out for 4 hours. Yes, I cooked it for the 5 minutes per pound prior to letting it sit  in an unopened oven for 4 hours. Rare as all hell. It is currently trying to catch up in a 350 degree oven while my guests wait. Going back to my old recipe. Don't bother.

GREAT recipe!  I've always found prime rib to be very intimidating, but this made it a breeze.  The only things I altered were I made the herb butter blend a mixture of Herbs de Province and Penzey's English Prime Rib rub, and since I wanted to aim a little closer to Med - Med Rare, I roasted it initially for 6 mins per pound.  It came out BEAUTIFUL, juicy and flavorful.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks Chef John!

I cooked a 16 pound roast for Christmas EXACTLY as Chef John said....500 for 1:15 mins then turned the oven off.  I used an internal thermometer and let it go until 130 Internal temp....oh my it was absolutely perfect.  Thank you!  My Au Jus was not as good but my creamy horseradish saved me.

Chef John never fails! Every recipe I have used of his has always been spectacular, this one included! I followed the recipe to the tee, and it was the best Prime Rib, ever! Cooking a 15.25 Prime Rib Roast, I was afraid it wouldn't be cooked enough, but it was perfect! My entire family loved it! Thank you Chef John!

I have an older oven so I kept mine in the oven about 10-15 minutes longer than expected and it was perfect.  I've made it twice now and it's so delicious.
Thanks so much Chef John fir another Fabulous recipe!!!  Yummy

I'm not sure what went wrong but I used my remote thermometer to keep an eye on the prime rib. It reached temperature in less than half the time this recipe called for. If I would have let it stay in the oven for the time the recipe called for, I would have eaten a very well done roast with the tenderness of a shoe. Next time I cook prime rib, I'll go back to the way I used to cook it.

I did everything that was told to me. step by step. time by time. I came out bloody and raw.  I did the time thing and was so dissappointed.  Did this for my husband for Fathers day.  Really disappointed.  Never again. Need to make a stew or something for the beef.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I used olive oil instead of butter, and added a few minutes to the cooking time because my guests don't all like rare meat. It turned out something like medium-well, but still pretty good. Next time I'll still use olive oil but follow the time directions exactly.

We followed the cooking instructions  that have you turn off the oven after 25 minutes at 500º (5 lbs), turn off  the oven, and leave for 2 hours. Worked beautifully!

I made this recipe this way every Thanksgiving because in Canada Thanksgiving is earlier and they are not as plentiful on the US Thanksgiving date. So I celebrate with Prime Rib. This prime rib has always turned out to perfection. I followed the instructions as listed and will never deviate from them. I have never had a better tasting prime rib in my life. A 5-star winner hands down. Merci Chef John

Disappointed this didn't turn out as planned.  Followed instructions explicitly as to method and cooking time: 9.6 (rounded to 10)minutes at 500 for just under 2 lbs, then oven off and meat rested for 2 hours, and it was medium well to well ??.  Flavor was good but next time I will try leaving it to rest for much less time.

Great recipe! A lot of comments on cooking a large 5lb  and up roast. Well be aware the “5 min/lb” rule doesn’t work well with a small 2 bone roast. Cooks way faster so I keep a meat thermometer inserted and start watching around the 1 hour mark.

I followed the directions a stated.  I did do one thing different, since I was time constraint I out the 6.43 lbs. roast into the microwave and once an hour set the defrost to 3 minutes.  I did every hour for 5 hours.  The roast was totally room temperature.  After applying the butter I use Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt as the seasoning. I baked it for 33 minutes and let the roast do the work.  It came out perfect.  This really does work and I am so glad I found this recipe

I have used this cooking method for prime rib several times over the last year and it is foolproof! Will definitely make you look like a culinary rock star to your family and friends. We serve with baked potatoes, creamed spinach and salad for a decadent special meal. Change up seasonings to whatever you would like and use the leftovers for delicious cheese steak sammies, soup/stew or even a beef pot pie. Thank you Chef John for making me look so good in the kitchen!!

its a beautiful recipe and having made it twice now with a manual gas oven, I have learned to rely on a grill temp monitor for the interior of the oven as well as a temp monitor for the roast.  I have made it with 6 pound (no bones) and a 4 pound with 2 ribs.  I follow the directions making sure to keep the oven within 5 degrees (F) of 500 degrees for the time listed.   I also take the roast out at 140 to 145 degrees internal temperature and letting it rest for 10 minutes brings it to medium rare perfectly.  I also use a cast iron pan with ridges instead of a roasting pan.  I heat it up on the stove and drop the fully rubbed roast with rounder side up into the hot pan.  that way it doesn't stick.

Excellent! Only did 1.45 pound prime rib. Cooked 7.30 minutes and let stay in the oven for 2 hours.  Next time I would cook it for 6 minutes to get it a little rarer.  Great job chef john

Huge hit with my family!  I used a brine of water, brown sugar and kosher salt 24 hours before bringing roast to room temp. Added a little garlic salt and msg to the spices but otherwise followed the recipe.  I used a boneless 6# roast but need to figure correct timeframe as it was not as pink as my family would usually prefer, but still very moist, tender and flavorful. Will definitely make again with minor adjustment to cooking time.

It was really good.  But the timing, for me, was not as expected.  First, I put a thermometer in my oven and checked it.  Yup, spot on at 500F!  Good.  So, on we go.  I let the meat out at room temp, uncovered, for about 6 hours.  Even still, when i put the meat/oven thermometer in the meat as I put it in the oven, it was only 43F so I worried.  To back up, the butter going on the meat was a headache.  I SHOULD have patted that meat totally dry first.  Oil and water don't mix and the little bit of moisture on the meat "repelled" the butter.  Not good.  I was not happy.  PAT THAT MEAT DRY!  The spices listed are spot on/good!! I preheated for 30 minutes.  With the "in oven" meat thermometer in the meat, here's how my timing went during that final 2 hours:  27 min. mark: 61F.  1.5 hours: 121F.  1:35 hour: 124F.  1:40 hour: 125F. when I pulled it.  We prefer prime rib at around 125F and it was perfect.  Had I left it in the oven to the exact 2 hour point, I'm sure it would have risen to 128-130F.  My advice: get a good in oven meat thermometer so you can keep an eye on it and get it to your exact preferred internal temp.

I tempered the meat for 9 hours for an 8 pounder and it came out perfect.almost all the negative reviews are for undercooked meat.the written instruction say 4 hours.the video says at least 6.i think the recipe should be revised to reflect the discrepancy as I believe this is leading to the raw meats which are probably too cold in the middle when they go in the oven.

My prime rib did not have a bone, but I liked this receipe enough to try it anyway.  It was perfect.  Follow the directions to the letter and I don't think you could go wrong.  So good and so easy. I did not put it in the oven as soon as my oven was heated up.  I actually let it heat up longer just to make sure it was good and hot.  Great receipe!

Can't honestly say if this works or not but want to warn others of some potential issues:
1) Cooking at 500 pretty much guarantees you are going to get come burning and smoking of the drippings.  This set off EVERY smoke detector in my house and it took 30 minutes to get them all to turn off.  So open some windows before you start or, better yet, do this outside on the grill.
2) My Jennair oven has a "feature" where the fan runs once the oven is turned off, to cool it off faster.  I didn't even think about this until someone walked by the oven and said, "why is the fan still running?"  I immediately realized this method would not work for me as the oven was cooling off way too quickly to fully cook the meat.  So if you have an oven like this, this recipe won't work for you.
I wound up finishing the meat on my propane grill at 350 ... a win-win as I was able to maintain the temp and get the smoking drippings out of the house.  Sadly for me my meat thermometer is broken so I went by time and did not get the nice pink middle, but the flavor is fantastic.  I definitely recommend the rub, and the initial high-temp sear, if you can do it w/out smoking yourself out of your house!

Seriously, THE BEST!!!!  I read so many of the reviews as I was terrified that my 17.5 lb bone-in roast was going to come out completely torched since it would be in at 500 degrees for 87 minutes.  I paced in front of the over, worried every time I thought it might be burning just to see (through the window with the oven light!) that it was sizzling but was not becoming charred.  Let it sit for 2 hours with the door closed, while I was sweating profusely and worried that this $175 roast was toast for our mid-year Thanksgiving celebration but...(wait for it)... IT WAS PERFECT!!!!!  Take it from me, it was wonderful, our guests raved about how incredible it tasted with the butter and herbed crust - and not a shred of it was left, except the bones for our dogs!  This recipe is a keeper!

I used this method to roast a sirloin tip and incorporated Carlos Guerva's suggestions.  Good thing I did because it turned out my oven was cooling down way too quickly.  I don't particularly care for herbes de Provence  so I used Montreal Steak Seasoning with the butter but next time I may only use S & P with the butter.  I won't use any other way to cook a roast - why would I, when this was so good!  The hardest thing is to get the meat out in time to get it to room temperature

This is the easiest recipe to follow you will ever try!
I have made it several times and each time it comes out to perfection - this is on my family’s rotation for “special dinners”!

Although I played a bit with the seasonings, to personal taste, the formula for roasting is PERFECT, and we'll definitely be enjoying more Prime Rib!

Made  exactly as stated. 25 minutes for a 5lb roast. It was rare and delicious!  I was so worried I would overlook it and at $13/ lb I did not want that to happen! It turned out perfectly and everyone loved it.   To reheat what was left I cut the pieces about 1/2 “ thick, and put them in the microwave on warm for 30 seconds each. They stayed rare! The hot gravy warmed them even more. Cold horseradish sauce went super on it instead of gravy for me.

I loved this recipe.  It was really easy,  and very, very good.  I wasn't sure it would work, but it did, and the roast was gorgeous.  I had a seven pound, three-rib roast, and just a note - he's not joking that you need a lot of salt!

Absolutely perfectly cooked! Followed the cooking instructions exactly. I didn’t have the spice called for so used a mix of my own, but I think that’s the part that is personal preference. Stick with this cooking method and you can’t go wrong...even for those that think they don’t like medium rare!!!

I have made this now 5 times with different  size prime rib roast's each time. It comes out fantastic, perfectly medium rare each time and very moist not dry.

Our 2 year old grandson ate almost a whole slice himself, he loved it.

The directions say to leave it at room temperature for 4 hours, the video says 6 or more.  I left mine out for 7 hours on the counter. 

You can't go wrong with recipes by Chef John, and this one is no exception.

Let me start by saying I am terrified of beef. It's too expensive to screw up. I got a bit of confidence on NY strip and Rib-eye steaks after talking to the meat guy at Publix, cooking on the grill. First attempt on rib roast was Paula Dean's recipe; good but medium to medium well, and I am good with a med-rare to rare. So this X-mas I did a 8.84 pound rib roast for 44 mins, and OMG, followed Chef's recipe with an over abundance of seasoning and it was *Muah* perfection. Light medium on the end slices and varying degrees towards the center of med-rare to rare-slightly medium on the edge. OMG will never do it another way, might change seasoning, but the 5 mins per pound at 500, cook, turn off for 2 hours; never ever will I mess with that formula

I followed the instructions exactly as written - 500 for 20 min. then turn oven off for 2 hours.  The recipe was for a 4 lb. prime rib, and mine was 4.75 lb.  It came out mid-well to well done!  The only thing good was the crust.  Don't trust this method, use a meat thermometer!!!

Did not work for me. Followed this recipe exactly. Roast was not done. I finished cooking in the oven and roast was excellent. May be my oven, not sure. I have an new, highly rated oven. You almost can't ruin Prime Rib. Just roast it to the desired temp, rest and you are good to go. No need for this recipe. Large margin of error. Also set off the smoke detector!

Although I let this sit for a few hours to bring to room temp, the meat was nearly raw in the middle, very tough and was bleeding when I cut it. I've been leery of this technique but thought I would try it since I wasn't entertaining.  I will go back to my old way (low and slow) as this didn't work well at all -- very expensive mistake.  Never again!

This recipe was amazing! I made it for my husband for his birthday, he was skeptical, wanted to be sure I had a back up plan so I didn't ruin the expensive prime rib. Did check the temperature about an hour and 40 minutes into the two hour period. Turned it up to 275 for the last 15 minutes and it was  perfect!  This is the only way I will cook prime rib in the future. thank you

I was skeptical that this recipe would turn out well.  My experience with high heat cooking, then a long rest time in the turned-off oven, has been notoriously uneven and never perfect.  Well, I can now say I have found perfect!  This had to be the moistest, most well-flavored rib roast I've ever prepared, and the inside was done just right.  I did let it sit in the oven for just a little less time since I love the meat rare, but the end result was spectacular for everyone, including those who will only touch well-done.  I will never make another version of this roast again.  Thank you for the perfect recipe!

I had my sister and brother-in-law over for a prime rib dinner as that is their favorite meal.  I followed this recipe to a tee, and they said it was the best piece of meat they have ever had (they are in their 70s).   I have never calibrated my oven, so I'm not sure how accurate the temperature is.  However, the only thing I would do differently the next time is to cut back the "resting" cooking time to 1 3/4 hours rather than 2 hours.  The meat was more med-well than med-rare but still so tender and delicious.  The butter/spice rub made for wonderful drippings and, thus, delicious gravy.  Thank you, Chef John, for another great recipe.  The only recipe I will use going forward for prime rib.

worked flawlessly for a 10.5lb roast. I had the butcher cut the rib bones off, then tie it back on to make sure it cooked well AND carved well.

Rave reviews from my guests with this recipe.
Mine turned out a little more cooked that medium rare probably because I had it in a cast iron pan and it retained the heat longer.  This pan made it very easy to make Chef Johns au jus since I just removed the roast and carried on with the next recipe.

Fantastic BUT recipe does not print with the cook's note, so be sure to jot that formula down in  case your next roast is a different size. It is also VERY important if your oven has a vent fan to follow Carlos Guevera's advice about reheating the oven partway through. It works perfectly, have had several perfect roasts!

Really turned out great!  It was left in the oven 30 minutes longer due to late guests.  However, I like my steak med well so it was perfect for me and a few others that prefer their meat cooked medium to well.  It had a great flavor and we will always use this method for prime rib!

I had an 11.6 pound rib roast, followed directions (except I didn't have herbes de province, so I put fresh garlic, fresh thyme and fresh rosemary in my mini blender and used those in the butter). Had the roast out for six hours to get to room temp, slathered it with the herbed butter, put the oven on to 500 degrees and baked the whole damned thing for an hour and six minutes before turning off the oven. Two hours later, my roast reached 147 degrees internally and I had beautiful juices to make the gravy like it shows. Such perfection! My family raved! Outer slices were more well done for my hubby (who likes it that way) and inner was perfection rare for my kids and me. This is the only way I'll make prime rib from now on.

I had a 3.91 lb roast so followed the directions to a tee.  When I took it out after the 2 hours, the meat thermometer registered over 140 degrees (I pulled it out because I was afraid to see how high it would go!) and the meat was well done!  Ruined!  We like our meat rare so this was a big disappointment.  For a roast this size I should have checked it after sitting in the over for an hour.  Needs some tweaking but one size obviously doesn't fit all!

This was the first time I have ever made a roast. It turned out wonderfully! Easy to adjust the recipe and tasted great. I adjusted everything for a small, 2.5lb roast. I used "I can't believe it's not butter" soft  spread instead of butter to cut down the fat a bit. Great recipe go-to for new or experienced cooks.

The rub for this recipe was excellent BUT if you are cooking a large roast like I did yesterday, absolutely DO NOT use the weight x 5 minutes method to cook. I basically ended up with a $130. medium piece of meat. So disappointed since most of our family love their meat med rare to rare. It had a good flavor but was overdone. The roast was over 12 lbs which according to this recipe cooked at 500 degrees for 66 minutes. Probably should only have cooked 40 minutes at the most. Cook with caution. ??

I have used this recipe for four years, each Christmas, and it's a winner.  NOTE:  With a larger roast, get ready for some smoke in the house at the beginning!  But totally worth it. 
I'm vegetarian, but this is such a foolproof recipe even I can master it.  Calculations for larger/smaller roast take out the guesswork and it comes out perfect each time.
I rely on the tastebuds of my 8-12 guests, and they rave about the flavor and tenderness of the roast.  Father, husband, sons, and brothers won't let me touch the grill 365 days a year, but they stand back and let me cook Christmas beast with contrition.   THANKS Chef John!

I made a 14lb roast this way and was very apprehensive about this method of cooking it.  About 30 minutes into the cooking time at 500 degrees there was some black smoke rolling out of the oven, probably because it was an older style oven that didn't completely seal.  I stuck it out, however, and figured that if it was ruined on the outside at least the inside would be good.  My fears were unfounded.  The roast was perfect and I will make many, many more of them this way.  Large or small, this simple way of making a prime rib is an easy way to impress!

Made this recipe today for a 2.5 lb. standing rib roast and followed it specifically, right up to the time it was on the last step of waiting for it to reach an internal temperature of 140 degrees during the last two hours in the oven. Fortunately, I have an oven light and a meat thermometer in my prime rib. It hit exactly 140 degrees after only one hour after turning the oven off.  I took it out at that point, and it was perfectly medium rare. That being said, I'd highly recommend a lighted oven and a meat thermometer so that you can monitor the progress without opening the oven door. After this experience, I've also just ordered an oven thermometer so that I'll have a better understanding of exactly what temperature my oven is at, as now I question my oven's performance. This piece of meat is too expensive to take any chances on. I hope this review will help someone.

Two changes.  First, I had a 13 lb roast, so I cut it in half and separated the two halves on the rack by about an inch.  Then, I used the calculation based upon a 7 lb roast, 35 minutes.  Second, I just used pepper, garlic and rosemary for the spices, then salted th butter per instructions.  It was, as everyone says, perfect.

I used this recipe on a 10.5 lb. Prime Rib for Easter dinner.  I admit I was nervous!  I followed the recipe to a "T" and this is by far the best prime rib I have ever cooked.  It came out perfect.  My family loved it and I cannot say enough good things about it.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.  I also made the au jus, it too was excellent.  Thank you Chef John!

Holy Smokes this was the BEST prime rib we've EVER HAD!!!  I KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE BALL PARK for my hubby's 50th Birthday dinner!!  I was SO NERVOUS....I kept checking the oven thermometer, through the window, to see how quickly the heat was dropping and my hubby kept saying it's STILL COOKING!!!  It turned out PERFECT!!  The Au Jus was AMAZING!!  My hubby and family were IMPRESSED!! Thank You John for sharing your recipe!

I purchased a 19.9 lb. prime rib for 20 guest I didn't have a pan big enough so I cut a piece off and cooked a 17.19 prime rib for 1 hour and 26 minutes at 500 d my oven is not one of those fancy DSC, Viking or popular expensive ovens. Amazingly!   it work out great although the end pieces turn out  medium which was ok because there were a few guest that didn't want rare or medium rare.
This was the second time I used this recipe and it works like a charm thanks John,

I made an 11.5lb roast for New Years day party exactly per Chef John's instructions. The meal was a huge hit, and the 5 minute per pound rule @ 500 degrees, then 2 hours with oven shutoff produced a perfect medium rare roast that was juicy and tender. His herbed butter rub with kosher salt treatment is a nice subtle seasoning, so the meat itself is the star of the show. Thermador dual fuel range got its first major workout too, and that thing can really cook.

This was my first time making prime rib.  I was skeptical about this cooking technique.  It was the best, perfect medium rare prime rib we've ever had.  So tender and flavorful.   I think we have a new Christmas Eve dinner tradition!

I had a 10 pound boneless roast and it turned out PERFECT.  The only bad thing was the smoke rolling out of the oven while searing at the 500 degree temp.  I may skip the butter next time and just use seasoning.

I made a 12.25 Lb prime and it came out OK. Followed the math exactly but I thought it was a little overdone. Way too brown.  Next time I will not skip using a thermometer.

This is amazing and so easy!  Everyone loved it!!  I don't like a lot of seasonings so I just brushed the roast with butter and rubbed kosher salt into it.  If you want it to be rare, you will need to reduce the cooking time.  Also, when you take it out of the oven, you need to be ready to slice and eat it.  It will cool quickly.  Next time I will warm my plates in the oven drawer.  Wonderful recipe.

I make this a couple times a year. The recipe is fool proof, if you follow it. The meat MUST be room temperature when you start. And you must NOT open the oven door during the two hour resting/roasting, no matter how tempting. 
I use a mixture of Kosher salt and Sarah's Mediterranean Sea Salt, and it always turns out Amazing. It's so rich you want to serve it with simple mashed potatoes and that's it.  I also save the bones and boil them with some red wine and garlic to make a stock which I freeze in muffin tins. Any time I need beef stock I just grab one of my "meat muffins" and pop it in. Instant YUM!

This is the best prime rib!  We were dying to open the oven and look but we didn't.   We did a 14.25 lb with no bones and it was cooked to perfection!

I made this prime rib using a 5 lb roast and a 16 lb roast.  Both were great!  I dried the roast and generously salted and peppered, then I used fresh garlic and rosemary in the butter rub.  The 5 lb roast didn't smoke up my house but the 16 lb roast did.  If I make a big prime rib again I will make it in the outside oven.  They both turned out perfectly!  So easy and no worries.  His formula is fantastic!

Followed directions for cooking exactly. However i seasoned it the day before and left in the fridge overnight uncovered . Then left it out at room temp for 4 hours. It was perfection. will never do it any other way... going to try a pork roast the  same way.

Perfect. I did a 12 pound roast covered in about 2 sticks of butter mixed with 2 generous pinches of herbs de provence (used maybe 3/4 of one stick of the butter) and then sprinkled with maybe 5 not so generous pinches of kosher salt followed by several medium sized cracks of fresh black pepper.  Previous to this i pulled my roast out of the fridge about 7 hours prior to cooking.  Funny enough it was still cold to touch when i began cooking.  Anyways i cranked my oven to 500f, stuck it in with the ribs cut off and then trussed together bone side down in a roasting pan for 64 minutes 12.235lbs *5 minutes.  After the time was up i shut everything off and guarded my oven with my life for the following 2 hours.  I stuck my meat thermometer in prior to coming but i picked a bad area so it registered the 135f around the time the rotating finished.  Anyways i ignored it following the instructions.  At the end it was a beautiful gbd with a nice crunchy crust that had a nice sound to it when i talked it with my carving knife. At carving time the first few slices really worried me as they were well done but after the edge the beautiful medium medium rare revealed itself.  The hostess began serving later than expected and their oven was in use so it was not reheated. I was worried about reheating anyways.  It was served on the cool side with warm juice and a great blue cheese sauce recipe.  It was a great success, seasoned perfectly , and everyone loved it.  I was unable to convert the

I followed the directions exactly.  My oven is digital and only 2 years old.  The roast was half raw and I had to continue cooking it.  Maybe increase the actual cooking time at 500 degrees before turning it off.

Woohoo!  No problem trying this method for the first time for Christmas dinner with a 13.795 five rib roast!  It had the perfect mix of well done on the ends and perfect medium rare on the inside.  Everyone raved!  I added cloves of garlic in the fat layer in addition to the slather of butter mixture.  Wouldn't hesitate to do again next year.....

We had a 14lb Prime rib for our Christmas dinner. Followed the instructions as to adding 5 minutes per cooking  time per  pound. Didn't quite know how much butter and herbs to rub in it, so I did maybe  5 tablespoons of butter, and mixed my herbs de province and herbs de France liberally into the butter (I did not have enough herbs de provinvce). Rubbed it liberally with Kosher Salt. Baked on a cooking rack with pan underneath to collect juices. Though it still made my smoke alarms go off, perhaps from the grease hitting the top of the oven, since I did not have it on the lowest rack. Definitely let it set in the oven for two hours after cooking time with door closed. It turned out perfect, and I had rave reviews from all of my family. They could not get enough of it. Keeper recipe!

Followed this recipe exactly with one small exception... we wanted it to be a little more done than medium rare so we added 5 minutes to the cooking time at 500 degrees and then left it for exactly 2 hours.  When we took it out,  the outer 1/4 inch was done but the inside was a solid 117 degrees and very underdone.  We even cut into it in case the temp had been higher and then fallen.  Nope,  the inside was almost raw.  As I write this,  the roast is back in the oven at 350 and we're impatiently waiting for it to finish. The oven is gas,  the door seal is intact and does it not have a fan.  Epic Christmas fail...

I have had great result using this recipe for a boneless prime rib.  Now I need to fix a bone-in one.  Can this same easy method be used with the bone-in roast?  Would there be a difference in the minutes per pound for the initial 500 degree cooking?  Thanks!

I'm sure this would be great but I have tried it twice and both times I had to turn the oven back on to cook the meat as it was raw inside. Perhaps my oven just doesn't hold the heat.

Great recipe!  My prime rib turned out perfect.  Changed it a little on the spices and used basil and garlic salt along in mixture with the salt and pepper.  Highly recommend this dish for any holiday or special occasions.

This is my go-to method for prime rib! I have a son with Asperger's who is very, very particular about what he will and won't eat, and he absolutely LOVES prime rib. The only thing I do different is I use 2tsp crushed garlic rather than herbes de Provence. I mix the garlic with butter and kosher salt, and spread over the roast before cooking. It's wonderful!

Positively delicious!  I made a 12.5 LB Prime Rib Roast for my husband and sister in law's January birthdays, 2 weeks ago. It came out perfectly.  From now on, I will only prepare/roast a Prime Rib via Chef John's full proof method.
Definitely need a pristine oven in which to roast the meat at 500 degrees, as it does get smokey in the kitchen.  The smoke readily dissipates once the oven is turned off for the Prime Rib to finish roasting for the remaining 2 hours.
Thank you Chef John.

Chef John, as always,  never disappoints. Used the garlic rub recipe on this site as the rub but I used this cooking method.  Will forever cook my prime rib roasts this way.... INCREDIBLE! Thanks again Chef John.

I cooked a 10 lb bone in roast, let it sit fo nearly 6 hours. I followed the recipe completely except I added five cloves of garlic to the butter.I applied the butter and seaasoning maybe a little to heavy because I thought the oven was going to explode in flames. But besides all the smoke the roast came out perfect.
The hardest part for me since I also cooked Turkey and stuffing, yams and fresh bread was timing since the prime rib required 2.50 hours of oven time.
everything worked out having to reheat the turkey. everyone loved my dinner. Thanks

After much debating with myself, I decided to give this recipe a try for our Christmas Eve dinner. I took it out of the fridge for about six hours prior to cooking, rubbed it with seasoned butter (thyme, basil and a bit of garlic) and stuck it in my preheated 500 degree oven. When I took it out after the two hour resting, It was cooked almost to perfection but....it was just about cold. The au jus I made with it heated it up a bit but really missed that nice warm piece of beefy goodness that a prime rib offers. Next time I'll go back to the Foolproof Rib Roast recipe on this site or, better yet, invest in a good remote thermometer so its cooked to perfection.

My first time making prime rib.  I had a 10 pounder.  I also had to use the oven thermometer to keep the inside temperature of the oven "stable" at 500 for 50 minutes - so for those without an accurate oven you MUST babysit the 500 F portion of the roasting else you won't get what you expect..... I used a William Sonoma oven thermometer.   The meal was a success - just what we expected and a hit with the guests!! A+

So easy and PERFECT in every way. Seared crust on the outside, pink juicy inside. My 12 yo daughter inhaled her slice and my husband had declared it better than any steak house we've had prime rib at in the state. Follow the directions... start with a room temp roast- I left my 5 lb boneless roast out on the counter for 5 hrs. I cooked it at 500 degrees for 27 minutes, turned off the oven for 2 hrs ( no peeking) and viola! A PERFECT delicious prime rib roast. Sorry to go on, but it was so good, so perfect, I'm slightly giddy with delight. Thank you, Chef John for a outstanding prime rib roast recipe!

I did 2.6 small one and it was perfect.

I'm going to a try a 6.5 for the holiday's.

Anyone have advice for that size. 500x33-35 minutes or so. Then off and wait it out?

Thank's Chef John!   I've on two other occasions tried cooking a prime rib and both were failures... expensive ones at that.  After watching your video, I figured it was worth a third try and this time it came out "perfect" !   Instructions are easy and I made sure the roast was a room temperature which I think as John stresses several times is the key to success.

It doesn't get better than this!  Made this for Easter dinner for six, and everyone LOVED it.  Every slice had a perfect, tender, pink center, and the brown meat around the edges was amazingly tender and tasty.  Melt-in-your mouth good!  I didn't change a thing.  My roast was 6 lbs, and I cooked for the exact time calculated per Chef John's instructions.

I followed this recipe almost to a T, herbs de Provence butter mixture, room temp roast, however, since my family likes a more med to med well doneness, I added 5 minutes to the 500 degree temperature.  I stuck to the two hour sit in my convection oven that I locked so I wouldn't peek, and I Should Not Have Added extra time.  I roasted the prime rib in a black cast iron skillet since I was planning on making the au jus immediately after.  I should not have added extra time. The roast was med well to well.  The au jus was phenomenal per chefs recipe.  Don't be worried about the time. Had I not added 5 mins and used convection roast.  I should have stuck to 30 mins for my 6 lb roast.  I did wrap the roast in foil while I made the au jus.  I served it with garlic mashed redskins and fresh green beans.  Did I say I should not have added extra time? Trust this recipe! It would have been perfect otherwise. My bad!

I received this recipe in the AllRecipe Magazine and tempted my very first prime rib.  It came out perfect with the seasoning, timing and method of cooking.  The only thing I need to figure out is how to serve the meat hot.  My family didn't like eating not-hot meat.  Does anyone have any suggestions because the rib came out perfectly medium rare.
I made the horseradish cream sauce on this website and it was perfect too!

Om-nom-nommy and easy. This recipe is also great if you think you might lose the electricity, because it only needs those few minutes of actual energy to cook, and you can eat the beef sliced cold as well as hot.

Much to my father-in-law's delight, I made this on New Year's Eve. It was dee-lish. I bought the roast too late to let it come to room temperature first, and my roast was between 7 and 8 pounds. I added 5 minutes to the 500-degree cook time to try to compensate, but it was still a bit too rare when I pulled it out, and so we all had another glass of champagne and it went back in the oven with a center cut for 40 minutes more at 425. The house smelled amazing, and we almost ate the whole darn thing that night.

I had a 13 lb prime rib for Christmas this year. My family all has their tried and true way to make a prime rib. I wanted to try this recipe and WOW!!! It worked great by following the instructions. We had to cook at my son's house. They said the house was getting smoky but that the meat wasn't burning. I told them to keep going! BOY!!! There were 12 of us and they all said it was the best prime rib ever!!!!!! My husband does his own rib rub but we did the butter too so it would brown nicely!!! Going to cook it this way from now on!!!! Thanks Chef John!

Worked like a charm as written with an 8 pound roast.  The crust was just heavenly; everyone was cutting little bits of the crunchy crust to have with each bite.  I used a thermometer to guarantee a medium rare roast  because who wants to guess with a $100 roast?  I used the Beef Au Jus recipe, also from Chef John and everyone loved it as well.

I don't know if it was my oven, my cut, or something else, but other than the outer edges, this thing was tough as nails and lacked flavor. It came out medium rare, but the fat didn't marble.

I have tried this recipe three times already, and each time it comes out perfectly. I try to wait until prime rib goes on sale so that way I don't spend a whole lot. I'm going to try making this for my parents during Christmas (mainly my Daddy). So we'll see how they like it!

I have used it twice with great results. You leave it in the oven for 3 hrs after a short time cooking at high heat and cook it another 20-30 minutes after the 3 hrs depending how you like it cooked. It is fool proof.

This recipe definitely produces a medium rare end result but I didn't like that the meat was room temperature when I took it out of the oven after the two hour's. My husband sliced it up and I had to pop it back in a hot oven to warm it back up. I don't know if it was worth the roast hogging the oven for two hours so that nothing else could be cooked with it. Good flavor overall

For some reason I've never been brave enough to try cooking a prime rib for Christmas dinner.  After reading your recipe and the comments, I purchased a 7 lb roast and, after turning off the smoke alarms (thanks for the hint Denise), cooked it just as directed, adding a bit of time due to the size of the roast. No surprise-it turned out perfect! I couldn't believe the amount of meat my teenaged grandsons, father & husband ate...you'd think they'd never eaten before!  The ladies ate far less, but it was loved by all! I served it with asparagus and twice-baked potatoes.  The easiest dinner to cook for a holiday ever! Don't forget to reset the smoke alarms! THANKS Chef John.

12/22/18...I’m still using this recipe every Christmas, but noticed that the latest posts concern the meat being pink.  I would like to point out that the meat stays pink even when cooked thoroughly  with this method.  Just saying!

My husband and I bought a 10 pound prime rib for a family dinner.  We were nervous about cooking it at such a high heat and then simply turning off the oven and waiting.  We decided to try it because we LOVE Chef John's lamb breast recipe.  This recipe is just as fantastic.  The prime rib was cooked perfectly and the dinner table with ten guests got very quiet as everyone dug in.  The dipping sauce was the perfect accompaniment.

Fantastic! I used different spices (2 tsps. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder) & omitted the butter as my roast had a nice fat cap & it turned out perfect. This is now my go to recipe for perfect prime rib!

Wow, I agree with the other reviews.  This roast was beyond belief.  We cannot have dairy, so we did the garlic slices in pockets, slathered with spicy mustard and then salt/peppered all over.  For the au jus, we used ALL of the drippings, lol, and the au jus was so yummy.   It really helped to warm up the beef, but some of it also ended up on the mashed potatoes!  Best au jus ever.  Thank you for posting.  I've only made prime rib about 15 times, and this was the first time we utterly loved it.

I made this for Christmas and my Family thought it was the best prime rib I've ever served.  As directed, I marinated overnight and removed from the fridge a good 6 hours prior to roasting.  As promised the internal temperature rose to a perfect 145 degrees after searing at 500 degrees for 35 minutes, turning the oven off and letting the roast cook on it's own for another 2 hours.  I removed from the oven, covered the finished roast w/foil and it sat for another 45 minutes before we actually ate, but it was still plenty warm. This has become my new "go to" method and recipe for a rib roast!

I love a good restaurant prime rib.  I could never figure out how they did it until now.  I have used this method twice now and both turned out so good, none was left.  I made a 5lb prime rib the first time and then 11lbs the next.  The formula works great.  I was a little skeptical about doing the 11lb roast with this formula but did it anyway.  I was thrilled with the results.  Thanks Chef John....I don't need to go out anymore to get awesome prime rib.  My wife, children and even the in-laws loved it.

Awesome recipe! We made this for Christmas last Saturday. We followed the recipe exactly for a 6lb prime rib. So, 30 min at 500, turned off the oven and didn't peek for 2 hours. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and had a delicious, rich crust from the fat and butter and herbs. It did get very smokey in our kitchen and it was kind of alarming at first with the smoke and the sizzle of the melting butter, but we just took down the smoke detector and trusted the recipe. The meat was juicy, tender, flavorful, and just perfect. Frankly, it was better than the last time we had prime rib at a steakhouse in town. My husband's only quibble was that the prime rib was a bit cool, but then, we did have to let it sit for 30-40 min while we waited for the green bean casserole to finish cooking, so that could be our fault for not eating right away. Served with extra-hot horseradish, Chef John's au jus, Mrs. Gerry's mashed potatoes, my mom's green bean casserole, and french bread. Oh, and last night we used the leftover prime rib to make beef stew. ^_^ It felt horribly decadent to use such good meat in stew, but we needed a change and it turned out amazing, too.

Was a bit skeptical because our Kitchenaid electric oven has a cooling fan which turns on when the oven is turned off.  So I had a back up plan just in case, BUT I didn't need it.  I followed the recipe exactly, brought the roast to room temp, seasoned the beef, did the math and in it went. Came out PERFECT, even with the cooling fan that can't be turned off.  Will be my prime rib recipe moving forward. Tasty, tender and fool-proof!

Perfect! I used this for a boneless rib roast that was nearly 8 lbs. The math method made it turn out absolutely perfect. Well done on the ends and medium rare in the center.

AMAZING! I tried this recipe for the first time on Christmas Day! I watched Chef John's video on making perfect Prime Rib - the one that refers to 'Math' and followed this recipe exactly. I had already purchased a 7 lb. boneless prime rib, but would have purchased the bone-in had I watched the video before shopping. I split the 7 lb. piece in half and followed the recipe as if I was cooking a 3.5 lb. piece. It came out PERFECT, just as the video showed and this recipe indicates. Thank you Chef John for showing me the way, the entire 7 lbs. was devoured by the 12 people I served!

Like the other cooks, I was skeptical about cooking for a short time and leaving my expensive meat in the oven and deal with out-of-comission-oven. BUT as my DH puts it - it is the best prime rib he's tasted! Watching Chef John's video is always helpful (he mentions that there's lavender in herbes de Provence). I just chopped up rosemary, thyme and parsley from the roasting herb pack with softened butter and garlic. It was delicious and perfectly made. I used 5-6 lbs of the boneless . Left it in for 29.30 minutes and turned off the oven. Tried the Beef Au Jus - I have to make adjustments to that, but other than that it everything turned out great! Thanks for the recipe, Chef John!

Fixed this recipe for prime rib on Christmas Day. Had 9 guests for dinner and the roast was fantastic. Had a 11.27 lb. standing rib roast and baked 57 minutes @ 500 degrees. Turned out perfect, and was so easy. Enjoyed by all.

This was the first prime rib I've ever attempted, and it came out beyond perfect using this method! I did use my own blend of seasonings, as I thought the butter might be a bit much. I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a bit of onion powder. I had a 5.3 pound roast, which gave me 27 minutes. I did leave it at 500 degress for 30, because I had a feeling it may have still been a bit cold in the middle. Perfect, perfect, perfect! I will be sharing this method will my family and friends!

This is a great recipe. I did a  8 lb. rib roast ( choice meat) using this method and it was wonderful. Will use it as my new standard rib roast recipe. Had used a similar recipe by a well known southern tv host but this is better. Outside of the roast is more appealing and tastier. Used a 1/4 lb. of softened butter, pepper and garlic powder as "rub" then poured on the kosher salt, discarding excess that did not adhere to roast. Try it and you will have a wonderful meal.

Like the taste of meat?  If so this is a good recipe if you leave out the herbes de Provence and the butter (there is plenty of fat in the prime rib already).

I think I paid less for my first car than I did for this prime rib.  However, precisely following the Chef's method resulted in a perfectly cooked medium rare rib roast.  The au jus made it even more of a hit for our Christmas family get-together.  Grand-daughters having seconds made my day.  The left over beef reheated in beef stock was a real treat for a couple of days.  I used the bones to make the Chef's beef stew and it turned out to be as good as any stew I have ever had.

I never leave reviews but everyone who ate this says it was the best they have ever had. I used to just use Allrecipes to find my recipes but now I use Allrecipes and add Chef John before any food that I search for. He has the best recipes and they NEVER disappoint.

I made this for about 30 of my BRUTALLY honest friends for a Christmas party. I stuck to Chef John's recipe and it turned out being the BEST PRIME RIB I've ever made!  Now my friends have the impression that I'm  SUCH  AN AMAZING cook.  Well that's a first!

Boneless: Yesterday for the Chiefs and Packers games we made a 10lb prime rib without the bone in and it worked great. Hubs is a great cook so he whipped up a selection of spices to add with Irish butter and we used lots of kosher salt. In the future, we'll use less butter, spices and salt and may decrease the initial cooking time to get a more rare result. But this was perfect for all the palettes at our house last night! We also used a Circulon baking dish with rack and the clean up was a breeze. Baking in this way will create a little bit of smoke; we had cleaned the oven to help cut down the smoke, which I think helped. During the course of the two-hour rest the smoke will go away.

I made two of them (that made me nervous) on Christmas Day in one oven. One was 8 pounds and the other was 9 and they both came out perfect!!! My stepfather who typically does the prime rib on the grill even grudgingly admitted: "That was a good prime rib."  Followed the recipe exactly!! Once again can't go wrong with Chef John!!!

So I made this for my moms birthday dinner, because she’s a Christmas baby, and she deserves to be treated special! I have never cooked such an expensive cut before so I surfed around for good recipes and stumbled across this one, and I’m so happy to have found it! The main course was a huge hit, my mom and brother loved it! I will absolutely make this again, everyone was super happy. With some minor tweaks it will be perfectly suited to our tastes, but don’t let my desire for adjustments worry you, the original recipe is fantastic and well worth a try!

This standing rib roast turned out beautifully. I followed the recipe nearly word for word and had no problems at all. The only thing I changed was that because my oven has a fan that cooks it down when it’s turned off I had to just turn the temperature down to 200*. That way it held the heat and the roast was perfectly done and was as flavorful as it could possibly get. I wish I could give it more than just 5 stars.

I've made several different Rib Roasts over the years, but Chef John's is by far in the top 3-4. I will be doing this again for Birthdays and other festive events. Highly recommend that you give it a try!!

I have made this every year for New Years Eve for the past 5years running. This year I even went huge with a 10lb rib roast. Still worked perfectly. This is a cannot fail method (unless you have some family member open the door). So take the time to follow it to the exact detail. Room temp, use the math, and sit back and wait for delicious perfection.

AMAZING!!!! I followed the method precisely and received a beautifully cooked prime rib in return. Just WOW. I used an 11 pound rib roast and it was perfect. It fed eight people with about a pound or so left over for Chef John's Guinness Beef Stew.

COOK'S NOTE: This creates a LOT of smoke. Your house is not going to burn down, but I would make it on a day where you can open a window or two.

Although I’m an experienced cook, this was my first try at making a prime rib. I prefer meat rare, and my husband likes his medium rare. I had a special challenge, though, because I was hosting a New a Year’s Eve dinner for guests who won’t eat meat if it’s even pink. I followed the ingredients list, and added seven minutes to the initial cooking time at 500 degrees. It was a huge leap of faith with a pricy piece of meat. After the roast had sat for its two hours in the oven, we crossed our fingers and pulled it out. I had cooked it fat side up, and at first glance it looked a little dark. I figured my guests would eat anything short of a charcoal briquette, so I was hugely relieved when my husband began carving and revealed the most beautiful piece of beef I have ever seen. The outside slice was more cooked than I would personally prefer, but still pink. The next slice was a nice medium rare. You could hear the juiciness of the meat while he was slicing. I had to stick my guests’ portions back in the oven for a few minutes, and served theirs just very slightly pink on the inside. I was proud of them for saying it was cooked enough, and we sat down to taste. My favorite part of any prime rib is the salty, crunchy outside. I was never sure how restaurants accomplished this, but now I know. The first bite was the best prime rib I have ever tasted. My husband and guests concurred.

Made this for Xmas dinner. Glad I read the reviews to get ideas about keeping the oven temperature from cooling if you have an oven with a fan (I do). Consequently I over cooked the meat to more a medium than medium rare. Everybody loved it and even I got my rare fix by eating the bones. Served with creamy horseradish sauce. Delish!

I would not recommend covering with foil but you can use a deep roasting pan (about 7" deep without the lid) and cook in that. It will prevent splattering in the oven and allow the roast to brown better.

It's come out great each and every time. I've done boneless and with bone-in. Boneless is a little easier with nothing to mess with and easier to carve different sizes. 

I've done this in our convection oven on bake and cook it a touch longer than the 500-degree calculation. (Our GE electric oven has a fan that runs when you shut off the oven so I've been concerned that the fan is actually cooling off the oven, but somehow it works.)

Havent made this for awhile but comes out delicious. My cousin also swears by this cooking method.  One MAJOR word of Caution. Our ovens accumalate a surface film of grease as we are baking and roasting over time. Your oven Must be CLEANED before you set it to 500 degrees or it WILL SMOKE because of the grease.   Dont want a fire.   Cooking through time we all learn through our mistakes.  Just wanted to share.

This prime rib had loads of flavor however, the cooking process did not yield a cooked roast after two hours and a half. The prime rib was very raw and inedible so I braised the cooled roast and cooked in the oven for another half hour or so.

Well  my roast was 5.8 lbs and using the calculations I cooked at 500' 27 minutes turned off oven and let finish for 2 hours.... the first few cuts were superb.. then it was  tartar.......(RAW). so had to replace in oven 30 more minutes.... so I was frustrated b ut my first time doing this so I figure since the oven was old and not air tight I did ok.   i used a butter and garlic thyme and onion with parsley rub (i made up)  it was delish... with my roast I complimented with candied al-dente carrots& walnuts and saute yellow squash , red onion and celery ( very small cubes)   no gravies or au jus or horseradish   ( i spaced)   Thank you for the recipes and direction...Suz

I've made this a couple of times. It's a keeper with the exception of the herb butter.  I'm not a fan of fennel with beef so I make my own herb butter but the cooking technique is spot on. Perfect temperature EVERY time!

WOW. I am a Brit and we don’t get Prime Rib at home. I moved to California and was gifted a 6lb boneless Prime Rib for Christmas. How to cook it though. I was dubious about the approach, very different to English roasting. Loved the video and the humour so I followed it to the letter. I served up the most delicious plate of perfection. This is pure genius.

In short..... It doesn’t get ANY Better than this!! 
I’m a good cook, that I’ll admit, and my family claims my meals are that of a 5-Star Restaurant (I think they’re very kind)!   But, with several meal categories under my belt, there is one that has petrified me- truly..... and that is Beef!  I’ve always wanted to make Beef Tenderloin, or a Prime Rib, but I could NOT unleash my fear that I’d spend $$$ on the meat, and then ruin it by overcooking it!
Chef John’s “Perfect Prime Rib“  IS JUST THAT~ PERFECT

I followed his recipe to the letter & minute - although I may add just a little more spices next time (we love garlic), but that is simply individual preference, but you will NEVER MAKE A BETTER PRIME RIB THAN THIS ONE!
I am (as my family & friends are) forever grateful to Chef John and this recipe!!  It deserves 1 million Stars!!  It truly does not get any better than this!!  Enjoy!

I made this last night but was epic fail because the oven was a steam oven and the meat came out well done. I'm going to remake this again in a standalone oven with heat rakes on top and bottom.

First, I'm definitely not the world's best cook!  The only reason that I'm giving this recipe 4 stars rather than 5 is that it would have been helpful to define what "room temperature" means. Yes, I know it's kind of obvious,  and the recipe definitely mentioned several times that the key to this working is that the roast has to be at room temp before cooking -- and it even commented that at least 6 hours is recommended.  My mistake was that I only had the roast out for 3 1/2 hours and it was 9 pounds.  I had the digital thermometer in the roast and it was 48 degrees F when I started cooking it at 500 degrees.  I did the multiplication and kept it at that temp for 46 minutes, then turned the oven off.  However, at 2 hours the temp was only 84 degrees, so I had to turn the oven back on and it took another 2 1/2 hours to get to 120 degrees, when I took it out and it rose to 130 degrees.  So ........ should "room temperature" be defined as maybe 60 degrees? Or higher? 
      Having said that -- the softened butter with the salt, pepper, minced garlic gave the roast a wonderful flavor.  Taking it out of the oven at 120 and letting it sit made the roast perfectly done with beautiful pink center.  So -- I will definitely try this again, but with a true room temp starting point.  And, the meat thermometer is also essential.

My husband and I started a tradition last new year's eve of cooking prime rib. I was so glad I found and used Chef John's recipe for perfect prime rib because it was perfect! So, I'll be using this recipe each new year's eve. As the old saying goes, if something is not broken, don't fix it.

Perfect every time, and have made it many times. For the negative reviewers, make sure the roast is room temp. throughout, not just externally. I have given this recipe to dozens, and all have had the same success.

I gave 1 star because this only worked before we replaced our oven. IF you have an oven manufactured in 2010 or earlier, this is the BEST recipe ever.  IF you have a newer oven, your meat will probably come out raw (that's what happened to mine).  We have a gas range so, on the newer models, there is a fan that pushes all the hot air out when you shut it off...I would love to see Chef John come up with a revision for this recipe to factor in these conditions.

Followed the instructions exactly and the prime rib did, in fact, turn out perfectly!  My roast was 12.5 lbs so I was worried that it wouldn't work out for a bigger roast but it did!  I had 11 pleased and impressed dinner guests.  Thank you Chef John!!!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used a little different spices. If you like raw meat you'll like this. The outer inch was cooked but the rest was blood red. It was nothing like what I get in a restaurant. I used a thermometer when I took it out of the oven and it read 130 degrees but it was undercooked (jiggly red) and cold by time I plated it. Disappointed.

Made it exactly as stated inn recipe with 1 exception - used poupon mustard instead of the butter.
Came out perfectly.  Flawless.  Will never make prime rib any other way.  Thank you Chef John!

I used this recipe with a 5 pound prime rib. It came out perfect.   I am going to attempt an 11.5 pound prime rib for New Year’s Eve buffet. I’m going to follow the advice of another and check my temperature after 30 minutes because the roast is so large

The recipe was fine.  The problem is I filled my entire house with thick smoke from the burning butter.  I should have known better but there should have been a suggestion as to how to stop the butter (and fat on the roast) from going up in smoke in such a hot oven.

The recipe is correct and I have a double oven and used the lower traditional oven instead of the convection oven. I had a 8.69 and cooked for 43 minutes at 500 degrees before I let set 2 hours. The prime rib was perfect. BUT...what is not said in these reviews is that for heating the rib roast that long at 500 degrees, the interior of the oven is splattered with grease, not only splattered, but there is a thin layer of grease allover the insides on the oven.  The oven now has to be completely cleaned. Also, what is not said is that the baking pan is splattered with grease and the 500 degree oven bakes the grease on the pan and it is difficult to remove, if not impossible. You may ruin a baking pan with this method.  I also used an internal digital thermometer to check the roast. I was concerned at the end of my 44 minutes at 500 degrees, that the internal temperature was only showing 57 degrees, and was afraid that it would not reach 140 degrees that I wanted for medium. I had a church function and returned after 2 1/2 hours and found that the internal temperature was 147 degrees. If I have gotten back in 2 hours, it would have been about perfect. So do not be concerned if you have a low temperature reading at the end of the 500 degree baking period. It will rise.

Chef John nails it with this recipe. Super easy to follow with results to die for!  The Au Jus recipe is a “must do” as well, the perfect compliment. We will be using these two recipes again next year. Thanks Chef John!

Surprisingly it turned out! BUT 30 min left and we touched the outside of the oven and it was cold. My mom, sister and I looked at each other & panicked. I decided for the remainder, to turn the oven on at 175 degrees for the rest of its time. We felt relieved that maybe we could save it but to our dismay that was a BIG mistake and we should have NEVER touched it. We sliced it open and noticed it was a little more done that we’d liked. ! We shouldn’t have touched it, we all agreed in unison, we should have left it alone. We shook our heads and ate our meat but it was really tasty and the sear was perfect. I didn’t do herbs de Provence but garlic and fresh rosemary. It was really good. Next time, 500 degrees for 25 min (ours was 5 lbs) and DO NOT TOUCH!! My mom has an electric oven not gas and I’m sure if we would have followed the directions it would have been perfect. Oh well. Next time!!

This recipe is perfect! 
I did make a few changes instead of butter I used olive oil and fresh rosemary, thyme and garlic chopped small and a few other dried ingredients along with plenty of kosher salt and put them on while it was resting for the warm up to room temp. I had also removed the bones and tied the whole cannon up with butchers twine. It was a 6.3 pound roast so I blasted it at 33 minuets at 500° F and let it rest in the oven for 2 hours and put the door lock on after shutting it off just in case prying eyes wanted to peek. I did this for my husbands birthday party dinner and everyone loves it! It had a perfect bark on the outside and very pink and juicy center with lots of flavor. Right between rare and medium rare.

I made this and used the advice of one reviewer who suggested turning the oven to 325 for the half hour after initial 500 degree blast to make sure the oven stayed hot. I then turned it down to 275 for one more hour and then turned the oven off for the last half hour. I used my own spice crust made from salt, fresh-cracked black pepper, fresh minced garlic, fresh thyme and fresh rosemary. I let the roast sit for four hours at room temp before preparing (a 5.87 lb bone-in prime rib). The meat was done perfectly, but ended up being cold by the time I sliced it and got it to the table. I might try just keeping the oven at 275 for the final half hour next time so that the meat stays hot. I will definitely use this method again.

I had a 7.5 lb prime rib roast completely thawed out, set out for the required time before seasoning meat to go in oven, a brand new oven, & I followed the instructions to the letter, I even added another 10 minutes to the time to "sear" it at 500 degrees. after the time it was to be in oven to sear it I turned it off and left it there WITHOUT even thinking about opening the door for the 2 hours the recipe said. But when we went to slice it for dinner it was still raw, except for the beautiful crust on the outside of the roast. 
Next time, I will do my old try & true. Of 32minutes per pound until inside temp is 135 degrees.

PERFECT!!! 
This is the first recipe that I followed from this website. I followed the recipe exactly as recommended. The prime rib came out better than what I get in the restaurants here in Las Vegas.

Perfect prime rib!  The only thing I would do differently is to untie the roast from the bones and season all the way around the roast and retie.  I used my own prime rib rub from a Better Homes and Garden recipe, it's similar to this one.  This a foolproof recipe.  If you wanted it a little more 'medium' vs. medium rare, maybe add 1 more minute per pound at 500.  The key is really letting it come to room temp before baking.

Smoke filled kitchen followed by overdone roast. My 13 pound bone-in prime rib was brought to room temperature over 9 hours. The butter melted quickly and caused a substantial amount of smoke during the initial cooking period. Not the worst I’ve eaten, but far, far, far from perfect.

EASY !!!  My roast was 6.5 lbs. Did the math - would have made my 9th grade algebra teacher pound.  BTW, I did NOT season my roast with the butter-spice mix as in the recipe.  I seasoned my several days in advance (liberally seasoned the outside of the roast with kosher salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion power and wrapped in in plastic wrap, refrigerated).  At 500 degrees butter will burn and smoke.  When I cooked it for the cooking time before turning off the oven, I still had smoke in the kitchen.  But I guess that's what windows are for.  So no real problem.

My Christmas dinner came out perfect.  No real fuss and an easy cleanup if you use foil.  Sweet !!!!

Very good! We did set ours up on a rack in a pan. Seasoned heavily with prime rib seasoning, celery seed and garlic. Put beef broth with minced garlic in bottom it made a great Au jus. We cooked a 9 1/2 pounder for 47 minutes at 500 degrees then turned off and left in until it reached 120 degrees brought out and let it rest for about 45 minutes, it was perfectly medium rare! We also set ours out of fridge for 4 hours at room temp first.

I love this recipe! I didn’t use butter, enough fat left on roast,. Couple of suggestions: use a disposable pan, don’t worry about cleaning your oven until after cooking this succulent roast, open windows and doors prior to roasting so you stay ahead of the smoke from high heat roasting. That being said, this was the easiest and best prime rib I have ever roasted.. Christmas dinner was a huge hit!

Ok, so the meat was great, but...  I had a roast just under 20 lbs.   I’m giving this only three because the seat was 97 minutes which started to smoke badly after about 20.  Fan on high and windows open helped, but it was pretty bad.    Could not get it to stop which put a damper on things for a while.  After I shut it off, temp was at 97.   Climbed steadily.   After an hour I pulled it out at 128 cause I was just not gonna let it go more.  Not sure if I did something wrong but an hour early was tough to recover from with sides.

This was very easy and cooked perfect. I also added large baking potatoes and  made more butter with herbs De Provance to put on the potatoes. And they were also perfect.
Will do it again.

The commentor, Carlos Guerva, nailed the oven alterations!  I made 2 bone in prime rib roasts last night for the very first time, one 17lbs and one 8lbs (the calculations!) and they were AMAZING! I was SHOCKED.  I was very apprehensive re: methodology, etc., but my guests, 17 of the harshest family critics, raved.  I used fresh herbs, room temp roasts (after forgetting to pull them out early enough, hello trash bags, laundry room sink, lukewarm water!), a bit less butter, salt and pepper. Yes, it's going to smoke a bit: have a clean oven and a good ventilation system. Gnawing on some leftover breakfast ribs as I craft this: even better the second day. Didn't have time for the aus jus, though can only imagine how much it may have complimented any already stellar piece of meat: next time. Thanks for helping me SLAY my very first hosted Christmas!

This was absolutely perfect!!! I had a rolled roast so I multiplied the weight by 6.5 minutes at 500° and left the roast in for 2 hours. It was perfect! I will use this recipe from now on - my new go to preparation method for a rib roast, rolled or standing. We live on a cattle ranch and like our meat rare to medium rare so that you can taste the meat! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!

MADE THIS FOR CHRISTMAS IT WAS GREAT. JUST ADDED BLACK  PEPPER TO BUTTER BEFORE I PUT IT ON THEN SALTED THE ROAST.  BEST AND EASIEST WAY TO DO RIB ROAST. THE SMELL WHILE IT WAS COOKING NEARLY DROVE ME AND MY WIFE CRAZY, JUST WISH I  COULD COME UP WITH A CANDLE THAT  SMELLED LIKE ROASTING PRIME RIB.

I love prime rib.This method of cooking it put it right over the top. It was a perfect pink medium rare all throughout. Beautiful crust on the outside. I did the spices in the butter my usual way. Lots of Garlic, Montreal Steak Seasoning, Thyme and Rosemary. I roasted it exactly as was instructed. 4 hours on the counter. My roast was 4.2 pounds so 22 minutes at 500 degrees. Oven off. Left it in oven 2 hours. No peeking. I served it with a simple Horseradish Cream. Scrumptious.

I have made this recipe a number of times.  It is perfect every time.  Go an extra 5 minutes on cooking time if some of your guests like it more done, and the middle will still be beautiful.  I cook a 10.5 pound rib roast and it is perfect.  All of my guests rave about it.  You can also leave it in the oven longer than 2 hours if other things are not ready.  

Tip:  if you have convection probe, put the probe in the meat.  Then without opening the oven, during the cooling phase, you can check the temperature to make yourself comfortable that it is really cooking to the right temperature.

Folks; this is by the BEST  prime rib recipe that I’ve made.   Super still all the way around.   Only thing I did different was made some slits in the meat and pushed whole cloves of garlic in them.    I was super leery about 500 for X amount of minutes, but I did it as stated and BOOM!!   Best Prime Rib EVER!

This is a no fail recipe! My roast was 11.5 lbs. for 8 of us. All that's left is the ribs. My warning is to make sure your oven is clean before your start. Something had to burn off before we smelled the wonderful aroma of the roast. Thanks you Chef John.

I made a 6 lb roast for Christmas night.  I used the calculations noted in the recipe.  I had a few people that like their meat a little more done the medium rare so after an hour I turned the oven on to check the temp.  It was 190 so  I heated it up to 280 and turned it off again and waited another hour.  It was perfect.  It was one of the best prime rib roasts I have ever had! I did add some fresh thyme and rosemary to the butter.  The oven did smoke a little due to the high heat and fat.  It was definitely worth it!!

Wow, it was delicious. My oven lost heat and I did have to use the "cook @ 275 for an hr, then let it rest" method but it came out perfect! I was able to find herb de provence at the local Publix and used that with the butter. It worked well.  The final result was moist, full of flavor and delicious Prime Rib! Will definitely be making this one again.

I made a 9,31 lb roast and followed the directions precisely.  Cooked at 500 for 47 minutes then turned the oven off.  Meat stayed in for 2 hours. My roast came out INCREDIBLE!!  Perfect pink color.  Only thing I will change in future is sprinkling with far less Kosher salt than I did, but this is MY method from now on.

I cooked for 60 minutes at 500 degrees, turned off the oven waited two hours exactly.  This was the best medium rare prime rib we've EVER had! I added lots of garlic and fennel seed to the butter rub. It worked out perfectly.

Made my first prime rib tonight for Christmas Dinner for my family and in laws!! This was a big deal and the pressure was on! !! Used a 9.49lb Costco’s Standing Prime Rib and it was the most expensive meat I ever bought at $160! Nervousness was an understatement. I followed the recipe exactly (besides adding fresh pressed garlic to the butter spread), had faith in Chef John and all the reviewers, said a prayer while I put the meat in for a 48 min seat at 500 degrees. Because my oven has a build in fan, at the 30 min mark (after the 48 min blast), I set the temp to 275 for one hour. At 1.5hr mark, I turn off the oven and let it sit for another 30 mins. Took out the roast at 2 hour mark. Check internal temp and it was a perfect 130. because my in-laws were late, the roast sat and rest for another 30 mins and it was perfect!! RAVE REVIEWS all around!! My FIL said this was better than Lawry’s Prime Rib in Beverly Hills. (We just went a week ago so he could definitely compare.) Chef John’s Perfect Prime Rib will now be our Christmas dinner tradition. The most important tip. Make sure the meat is a room temperature before putting it in the oven.

I have been slow cooking my prime rib for years and the doneness varies. I used this recipe and it was perfectly cooked. Yes to the viewers that complained about the smoke it does a lot of that so we opened the doors and let it cook.

Pretty much made this as written - was outstanding!  Only difference was using a low-fat option for the  au jus - which worked well for us.

I have an oven that was installed in 1954, built on 1954. It bakes perfectly and to the minute on timed things. I wasn't sure how it would be but IT WAS PERFECT!
My first prime rib ever. 5lbs, Seasoned with penzys prime rib rub the night before, preheated the oven to 500 put it in for 20 mins, turned the oven off and left it for 2+hrs. Slightly crispy on the outside, tender and sooooo yummy on the inside, perfectly medium all the way to rare!

The meat did taste great. I went  with the herbs de provence, couldn't even tell there was lavender!!  My problem was the smoke!!And  for half an hour!! BTW, my oven was not needing cleaning EITHER.. Maybe, the recipe should say clarified butter, IDK, I feel stupid that I didn't think of that before I smoked up our kitchen and adjoining rooms. i'm not new to the kitchen....Hmmmm Butter in a 500* degree oven, and for 30 mins. ( did the math of weight x 5) NOT A GREAT IDEA.  In the future I'll definitely remember this one.  Either use ghee, or a high temp friendly oil. Also cut slits in thru the top fat cap and inserted slices of garlic.  Was very disappointed there was no au jus?? Just the left over fat/butter. Wondering why. Meat = 5 stars, method = 2 stars. Also after oven off for 1 hr. was worried about my oven not keeping the heat in, so glad I checked, meat temped out at 100*, turned it back on to 300* for last 45 mins. Just right, 125*. Rare in the center,  Med rare out towards the ends of a 5.88 pound prime rib.

Have used this recipe for a few years and it is the best. Beats trying to slow cook at lower temperature. 
I did find the tip by another reviewer of checking the oven temperature after an hour and if it's below 275, give it a boost back up. Came out perfect medium rare.
Hit the pan juices with a spray of cold water and you can get the fat out quickly, then reduce it down a bit for a nice au jus.

I've been using this cooking method for years! It's 100%  full proof as long as you follow the directions  thoroughly. Personally for the outside rub....I cut way back on the salt and use "Malabar Pepper". I feel seasoning is all personal preference. My hubby had a heart attack a few months back so he's suppose to be limited on his salt intake. So go with what you like with seasoning :)

The most amazing prime rib I've ever made. The crust is to die for and the whole thing takes the guesswork out of cooking prime rib. So easy! Follow the recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed. It does need to roast in a newer digital oven.

I was so skeptical when I first saw this cooking method.  But, it works.  I’ve used for boneless and bone-in, and get a perfect roast every time.  6 pound, 8 pound, as long as you used the calculation for cooking time, you’ll be fine!

I followed the instructions exactly as written for a 4 bone roast. It was better than I could have hoped for. The roast was better than I’ve had at my favorite restaurant. I served it with red bliss potato’s, green beans, carrots, and every one just loved it! The only down side was the oven smoked quite a bit while cooking at 500’ for 40 plus minutes, and after this I’ve been told that everyone wants a repeat, and not just for Christmas dinner.

As I have struggled in the past making these roasts (under done, over done, not seasoning it right), I will say this is our 3rd time doing this recipe and not sure I would attempt to try any other recipe, as this one is full proof.  Some have said on these reviews that it was way to raw when it was done. All I can say is, then you did something wrong! Here are the errors that can be made. #1 mistake, not letting the roast sit out for 2.5 hours - 3 hours  before cooking. #2 not trusting the 500 dgr thing for the 5 min. per pound and then turning the oven off. #3 mistake is, DO NOT open the oven door for any reason. In fact, it is best to throw the lock on the oven, to secure the seal and do this for 2 hours. Then take out and foil over for the half hour resting period.
Avoid all these 3 mistakes and you will have a medium rare roast. If desired a little bit more done, add 1 minute per pound of the 500dgr cooking time. This will give you a medium rare  center and more of a medium rare - medium on the outer area's. 
This year I am trying 1 thing different that I will share (even though we have not cooked it yet). 
I bought the roast already thawed, so I stuffed garlic cloves throughout the roast (including putting holes deep into and shoving garlic down them). Then I poured a half cup of Worchestershire and salt and peppered the roast. Bagged the roast and froze it. I took out the roast 2 days ago, to allow it to defrost in the fridge, in which continued to marinade it on the un

I never thought I would be able to cook a prime rib. So it was with great trepidation that  I bought a rib roast as a test run. I followed  the recipe to the letter and it was a thing of beauty!! The real deal was even better than the test run. Thank you.

I didn’t think this would work with my little 2.2 pound one rib roast, but it was perfect!? Since my roast was so small I only set it out for two hours and followed the calculation, which meant baking 11 minutes before turning off the oven for two hours. I stuck some oil & garlic salt-rubbed and pricked 6 ounce Yukon potatoes? into a pan on the side and they came out moist and yummy. I served it with Chef John’s au jus on the potatoes, and horseradish sauce from a similar rib recipe here. Thank you, Chef John!

I was so nervous the first time I cooked a Rib Roast, but this recipe is perfect.  This will be my third year in a row and it just doesn't fail.....follow the directions exactly; especially check the directions for the weight of the roast.  It is delicious!

Absolutely delish. I made this for Christmas dinner last year and it’s was a hit. I taped the oven door to ensure no one would open it. I also made the au jus sauce and it was the bomb. This is our tradition every year. All we talk about is how good the prime rib was along with Mac and cheese, dinner rolls, and asparagus.

I have made this numerous times in an RV oven. Somewhere along the way I must have read the directions for a "lesser" oven for holding heat. I made notes that I let it sit after cooking for 30 minutes and then place in a toaster over at 275 degrees. When the meat thermometer starts to move at about 125 it is done. I have never had any luck with the au jus I think the butter burns and it is too salty. I make it in a cast iron skillet.

Followed directions to the letter.....roast was VERY RARE, TOO RARE, BLEEDING RARE. Usually use Paula Deen that calls for roast to sit in oven for 4 hours after turning heat off. Love Chef John but this one missed the mark. That’s for other tips like how to reheat and use of leftovers.

I want to give it a 5 because the first time we made out Christmas roast this way, it was perfect. We got a new convention oven to replace our old non-convection and made another the following year. We followed the recipe to the nines and the roast was raw on the inside - not med rare but raw - uncooked. This new oven cools down so much faster. I am thinking it is the fan? We did not use the convection setting for the initial roast. Will not do this again with the oven we now have. So the second attempt was ) because there was no mention of this problem so a 1. Averages out to a 3.

I made this for Thanksgiving 11/28/19, and this recipe was so easy and delish!  I made a 8lb, cooked it for 60 minutes total.  I made sure the oven door stayed closed for the entire 2 hours.  It was the perfect medium rare!  I was devoured by 4 adults with only bones for left-overs!
Thank you!!

Did this for Thanksgiving yesterday and it was AMAZING. I've never made prime rib in my life and was able to follow this recipe to make, arguably, the best prime rib I've ever had. It was a huge hit and got high praise from the main meat connoisseur of my household.
One modification I made, instead of Herbs de Province, I used Italian Seasoning - turned out tasty as heck!
10/10 would make it over and over again.

WOW! Fantastic!!  I followed the recipe to a T, and it turned out perfect. Absolutely amazing. My son and husband raved about it and couldn't stop eating it. We had left-overs that made fantastic sandwiches the next day. This is a keeper. Thanks Chef John!

I made my own seasoning but used the thyme, butter and garlic. Followed the cook time. 11 lbs for 55 minutes and the the oven went off for two hours. I rested about 30 minutes. Absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked.

Loved it.  I either will add more butter next time or find a rib with a little more fat on it to make some more drippings for the Au Jus.

I've used this formula for 4 roasts of different sizes ranging from 10 lbs. to 18 lbs. and they come out an absolutely perfect medium rare every time. I have the butcher cut the roast away from the bones and tie it back together. When I'm ready to cut the slices, I can cut different thicknesses for my guests as I remove the roast from the bones and place it on a platter. I put a temperature probe in the center of the roast and it's amazing the way the temperature rises after shutting off the oven. Chef John is a genius. One final note, If you have one of the newer electric ovens with convection, when you turn off the oven, the convection fan automatically comes on to cool the oven. You must shut off  the circuit breaker to the oven when you turn off the oven.

I followed the instructions to the letter and the roast turned out absolutely spectacular.  Beautiful med-rare throughout.  The bark on the outside has incredible flavor and sears in all the moisture.   The butter tends to smoke a little bit, so ensure that the hood fan is on high.  
We cooked a four-bone roast, came out absolutely perfect, as good as any Prime Rib joint in town (maybe better).
Highly recommend this method, totally fool-proof, as long as you enjoy your beef med-rare.

This was amazing only trouble I had was my oven! It’s a new oven so has a cooling fan when oven is turned off so did as one reviewer suggested turn the breaker off so as I’ve stated the best prime ever but when I turned breaker back oven oven won’t work having it serviced tomorrow I’ll be so disappointed if I can’t use this recipe again any suggestions

Wow! So easy and after the initial 10 or 30 mins (depending on size) I don’t worry about it for a couple of hours. No more dealing with thermometers, etc. Mine came out a little more than med rare but I think I will round down next time and I forgot to start timer after the initial 11 minutes (plus my rig was pretty small). Otherwise, perfect!

Made this just as instructed and it came out perfectly. I have never purchased this cut before as it is very expensive but there was a fantastic sale at Safeway last Christmas and so I sprung for it. Follow the time exactly (and watch your husband closely to make sure he does not open the over---that is the hardest part). I did have a problem finding the herb mixture for  teaspoon herbes de Provence, but I found the recipe on this site for making the mixture myself, and it had all the herbs I already had on hand. Now I can use that combination for other meats too.  Happy cooking. Waiting for another fantastic sale.

OMG!! Best Prime Rib Recipe Hands down!!! Comes out perfectly rare- medium rare. Just never ever open the oven while it’s slow roasting. I guarantee you will make this over and over.

BETTER THAN RUTH'S CHRIS! …..By Far, The BEST way to cook Prime Rib.  Keeping in mind that prime rib is meant to be served pink in the middle.  However, If you want medium to fully cooked, this isn't your recipe.  You will have to modify it. I purchased my meat from Costco's (Might sound odd, although they carry higher quality, then most grocery stores, where I am located)  

Side note to some oven comments: Yes, a dirty oven will smoke a great deal - Start with a clean oven for rest results.

Chef John is the only one I admire in the kitchen. 
Pure Talent, natural on TV !

AMAZING Recipe!!

No changes to instructions. However, Not having all herbs to make herb provence, i pulled from my garden to fine chop together rosemary, greek oregano, sage, chives, parsley.  Added sea salt & crushed peppercorns.  I will always cook my prime rib this way forever.

1st time was excellent.  Making it again this saturday.  My neighbors grandson works at Disney, and he took leftovers to work. All of the employees wanted to know where he got this prime rib!  They said it smelled delicious and couldn't imagine going to Epcot for a better meal :)
Thanks for making me look like a rockstar!
Excellent!
Our oven vents at bottom, placed towels in vents to cook for 2 hours.  It didn't catch fire like BF freaked out.  
Amazing results!

Easier than preparing a boxed meal.  The seasoning options are endless obviously but as far as the actual cooking method goes.....  There's no excuse to not have prime rib several times a year.

First off I didn't hear you must have a bone in the meat.  Second, I had probes in the oven and in the meat.   I set the oven for 500 degrees and it didn't reach 500, so it was set as high as my oven would go, 550.  The oven would only go to 445.  Well, I cooked it the 30 minutes .. I have also a probe in the meat and it's set for 135.   With so much control with the probes, I should have a tasty cow. Well, at one hour the meat was at 135 and the temp of the oven just went under 275.  So, I took the meat out then and there.  When I went to eat the meat it was 156, at medium rare.  Too done for my taste.  Tasted okay, but not the best I have ever had.  I probably won't be cooking it like this again.  Liked the molds of salt/flour that I did the first time cooking prime rib.  Going back to that recipe.

ok, let me preface this by saying chef john NEVER makes bad food.  For all of you out there that want to know how this recipe applies to more than one roast at a time, I will tell you my experience.  I had a 6 lb and a 7 lb roast.  mathematically, that would be 65 minutes at 500.  Probably should have been my first clue.  so needless to say, it was WAY overdone.  however, it there was also a modification I made by another user that said after 30 minutes turn your oven back on to 325, if it starts heating up again that means your oven isnt holding the heat long enough.  so, in order to counter this you he recommended putting the oven on 275 for the next hour then turn off for the last 30 minutes.  so, honestly, I dont know EXACTLY where this failed, but it was an unmitigated disaster on Mothers day no less.  Kind of an expensive experiment project and would be nice to know from the man himself where the science lies when doing more than one.  In any case, thanks CJ.

Amazing Easter Sunday Prime Rib Dinner!  Thank you Chef John for sharing an easy to follow recipe for prime rib.  First I covered it with a marinade of olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, fresh garlic and butter.  I put it back in the refrigerator for a few hours.  Then took it out for an hour before cooking.   Next I put it into a preheated oven at 500 for 20 minutes.  After that I turned off the oven and left it in for 2 hours.  Then took it out to rest.  The meat thermometer read 130-and it was perfectly medium rare.  I then put it back into the oven at 375 for about 20 minutes to heat up for our actual dinner.

Thank goodness I have this recipe.  Made this several times and it is pure perfection when finished. I've learned after several attempts that you should use kosher salt and not table salt, and include a little more than you think is appropriate. It works out every time!

I used this recipe with a 2# roast and it turned out well.  Problem with butter/500 degrees/smoke detector.  Next time I will rub the roast.  Used a Montreal steak rub.  I liked the recommendation to check the oven after 1/2 an hour for 325 degrees and if lower than that temp, turn on oven to 275 and roast remaining time.  I will definitely make again.

I decreased the cooking time to 12 minutes for a 1kg sirloin tip roast and also mixed in a few tablespoons of Worcester sauce with the butter and seasoning . The result was a medium rare roast . It was delicious, my second time using this recipe and I will definitely use it again

I made this recipe and made sure that the roast was room temperature.  I cooked it for 5 minutes extra at 500 degrees and it was superb.  Next time, I will follow the 5 minutes per pound since I like my beef medium rare.  My guests were not sure that this recipe would work but they raved about how it was cooked perfectly and was juicy.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Easiest and best prime rib ever.  Every oven tends to be a bit off in actual temperature so if you have a way of measuring the exact temperature, do so.  500 degreees for 20 minutes was perfect.

I’ve done this twice, once with a small three pound roast and once with a larger five pound one. Follow the directions and don’t skip steps, and use the note at the bottom to tune your cooking time. This is PERFECT and the easiest rib roast recipe there is.

Only way to fly peeps! Betcha I’ve made this 50+ times, easy! And not just for special occasions!  Boiling hot aus JJ is essential as are heated plates. I serve a separate ramekin of horseradish cream I make fresh as well. Sides end up pointless, no room really to eat them! LOL So I serve a simple wedge salad about an hour before dinner. Let guests garnish their own lik wedge of lettuce with diced tomato, bacon, and cheddar cheese , sharp, grated fine. Creamy dressing like ranch, thinned a bit is a hit.
Herbs de Provence....don’t skip, always fresh! Most important! 
Just OUTSTANDING!

I use this recipe for the last 3 Christmases.  Everyone is blown away. I've been going an extra 5 minutes on cook time because the previous year some thought it was a little under cooked. I've used this recipe for cooking up to an 18 pound roast. Perfect. Very important to have a well sealing, well insulated oven to work properly.

This recipe is awesome! I followed it exactly (other than adding some garlic to the butter concoction) and my 6 lb. rib roast was perfectly cooked.  I had read through the reviews and saw the cautions regarding ovens that have fans (which mine has), so I cut the breaker as soon as I turned the oven off.   Must have worked because it was just right after 2 hours.

Obey Chef John (come on... who doesn't?) and you will produce the BEST roast of  your entire cooking life. Your husband - if you have one- will be weepily nostalgic for at least a week, and then you will break the bank and do it again. The ease of preparation belies its magnificence. Just do it.

I bought a great prime rib, and followed the instructions exactly, but since I like rare meat, I cut the initial time a bit. It was so overcooked it was nearly inedible. Well done. A waste of good beef.

Loved it, though a tad too rare. I did the recipe for 6 min per pound and worked great. First time, I followed the tip and used aluminum foil to cook, but as I'm writing this , my mouth is watering as I look through the oven window at the roast without foil. Soon to know the difference.

Made a 5 lb. roast and followed the directions to a tee, including checking my oven temp. after 30 min. of shutdown.  There was blood running out after the rest time so I had to cook longer which totally ruined my 'medium rare' liking.   Hubby liked it because he likes a medium cook but I was disappointed.  Used the rest of the roast in a soup so I didn't have to toss it.

I had a houseful over and wanted the best Prime Rib.  I wasn't disappointed.  I prefer my roast a little more on the well-done side but my company raved about it.  How can I complain about that?

After reading 1000 post I thought I'd be smarter than everybody. To stop the smoking I would add water to the pan. In my haste and lack of coordination I spilled some cold water on the oven glass door. I thought no big deal,  but was a big deal.  Door glass broke. Good news is it's only $45 shiped,  will replace it next week. Adding water kept it from smoking just used boiling water if you want to do it in case you spill it. I have a KitchenAid superra oven that has a cooling fan after shutting off the oven. It does however have a dehydrating cycle that allows me adjust the oven 130 degrees for the last 2 hours which work great. I had a wireless temperature probe in the prime rib as it cooked to 127 degrees at 2 hour mark . I must say it came out better than I thought it would will do it again this time of boiling water.

Omg amazing. I was scared because of some of the reviews but I cooked a 2.9 pound prime rib and it came out medium rare. I got sick on Christmas so I had to freeze my rib roast. On 1/09/19 I took it out and left it on the counter overnight and it was thawed by the morning. I did the butter and spices.  The only think I would say is be careful with the salt.  I added a bit to much but I scraped some of it off.  Thanks so much chef John for the great recipe!!!

Turned out awesome!!! Better than a restaurant! I did follow one of the reviewers suggestions about turning the oven to 275 for an hour after the temp dropped below 325. Worked like a charm otherwise I think it may have been very rare!

Perfect New Year’s prime rib.  A bit scary at first because of the high heat and closed oven for 2 hours. But my prime grade rib roast from Costco came out perfect.  Last year I tried the “check the internal temperature of the prime rib” - far inferior method, turned out too well done even though temp appeared correct.

This was my first attempt at Prime Rib and it was perfect. I followed the recipe using the suggestion to check the oven for temp, found my oven was slightly cooler than desired, so I turned oven on for remaining cook time it was beautifully cooked and delicious. I would recommend this recipe any day.

This gave us a range of medium through medium rare for our 14 lb. roast, which was just perfect! We didn’t use butter because the fat cap was HUGE. Will definitely do this again.

This was fantastic!  I had a Rib Roast (bones removed) of about 7.5# (trimmed of excess fat) - used a butter, Dijon mustard, rosemary, and pepper rub then salted.  I roasted at 500 for 25 minutes then put the oven on warm for about an hour before I turned off since my oven has fans that run to cool.  Had a meat thermometer inserted from the start (but read from an outside location) so pulled it out at 127 and rested 20 minutes (uncovered).  It was perfect!  We ate about 1/3 of the roast that night then used the rest for sandwiches and snacking the rest of the week.

We followed this recipe very closely. Simply put..AMAZING! The herbs & resting time are the only minor changes we made. We slathered in alot of butter as suggested. Our local Kroger had an awesome course sea salt and herb de Provence mixture that we used. However it was an herb infused salt so it was more salt heavy than herb heavy so we did add more herbs to it as well. He is right when he said the more salt crust the better. You can't overdo it. After covering it with our salt/herb mixture we then put even more regular coarse sea salt all over it. It gives a great looking finished product but you really don't taste all the salt. We used a remote meat thermometer probe that we could monitor without opening the door and we actually didn't need the entire 2 hour resting time. We pulled it at the temperature we wanted which was about 130. I would recommend one of those thermometers just to ensure the temp you desire. This was our Christmas meal and everyone was truly impressed! Thank you Chef John!

Did the check after a half hour of turning off the stove and found temp had dropped to about 281, so from now on I will be running the 275 degrees for an hour fix suggested in the top comment.  I did a 7.77# roast doubling the portions, added some pressed garlic cloves to the butter mix.  Delicious!

I have been making my rib roast this way for years except without butter and herbs.  Only S&P and lots of garlic inside the roast.   With several more cloves roasting on the side - one can never have  enough  garlic!  If you can afford this cut of meat,then you should be able to afford a thermometer that will monitor the progress.  Every oven is different, some don’t hold the heat as well.  If yours is that way, lower the heat to 300 and pull the roast when it reaches 120, cover with foil and several towels and let rest.  When cooking a whole roast, I almost always cut it in half.  This gives double the end cuts and in this family those pieces are pretty popular.  Even the end cuts are medium rare and can be pan fried for the die hard well done folks.    Cannot emphasize enough the importance of bringing the meat to room temperature for at least 4 hours (I go 8) and resting after cooking before carving.  Put a lock on the oven door - once it’s open the magic is gone!  If your butcher will cut the ribs off and tie them on, you end up with all the flavor of the ribs and easier carving.  We’d only do prime rib at Christmas, but those ribs are pretty tasty on the grill the next time the Weber gets fired up.   I’ve also done a rib roast (indirect heat) on the Weber.  The thermometer is essential for success so you don’t have to open the lid to check the meat.

Ours weighed 11.40 lbs so we seared at 500 for an hour and turned the oven off and let her sit for 2 hrs. Seriously the best prime rib I’ve ever had! Everyone RAVED about it. Sadly there were no leftovers.

This was the best prime rib I ever had. Followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect. And the best part is how easy it is to make. I never tasted something with so much flavor and so little effort to make. Thank you Chef John

My family loved the prime rib. You must double the 'rub' portion, though, the spices and the butter. We would do this again.

When I checked my oven after being off for two hours it was ice cold and the meat was not done. Fortunately I caught it before dinner was ready and was able to finish cooking it with heat. It did turn out perfectly cooked but not as the recipe advised.

I have made many prime ribs, but this recipe is the absolute best I have found.  Making sure the meat comes to room temperature is key.  Thank you Chef John!!!

I have used this recipe twice now for the last two Christmas Seasons and it turned out fantastic both times.  The first year I cooked Prime Rib Roast and the second year I used Top Sirloin Grade AAA and even though the meat is a slight bit less tender than Prime Rib it was still awesome!!  And not as hard on the budget!  
Honestly I was quite skeptical of this recipe for the simple fact that Chef John proposes leaving the meat on the counter for at least 6 hrs.  I searched for reviews and googled safe meat refrigeration or non refrigeration and it certainly didn't support Chef John's technique.   
After much thought (after all we are serving food to friends and family) I decided to leave the meat on the counter for at least 6 hours like asked.  Well I can honestly say that doing this had no affect whatsoever on the safety of the meat.  The recipe turned out exactly as claimed I can't emphasize how important having the meat at room temperature throughout the meat for perfect results.  What's nice about this recipe is how one can shave different meat slices according to people's preferences.   I had one guest who has colitis and was hesitant on rare/medium rare meat so I was able to offer the outer portion of the roast which gets cooked more thoroughly (outside 1/2") or offer a rare or medium rare from inside the roast  to others which is what I like.  
What's also great about this recipe is that I had leftover au ju and just poured it onto the leftover meat and had great juice

So good! I rarely cook prime rib and it is very expensive, so I was anxious, but it came out perfect.  I put masking tape over the door to be sure no one opened it - good thing I did!

I cannot brag more on this recipe... follow the timing and instructions and you will  have the perfectly cooked prime rib.   I start by seasoning - rubbing with olive oil and a little liquid smoke, sprinkling liberally with Canadian Steak seasoning and extra dried rosemary. I press the seasoning into the meat the night before, cover with a plastic bag on the roasting pan and hold for "warm up" the next day. Cook and enjoy! The only criticism I have is that the searing hot cooking does cause a greasy oven. Thank goodness for self cleaning ovens but OH MY the rib roast is SO worth it!

I followed the directions and this came out perfectly.  I used butter seasoned with Montreal seasoning instead of Herbs de Provonce (only because I didn't have any on hand) Came out great.

We made this for our Christmas dinner..flavor was superb! Ours was not a bone in rib roast, however I read many other reviews that were not as well and theirs turned out perfectly so decided to try it! Unfortunately, ours was not the perfect medium rare we desired. It was more medium well. It was very tender and very flavorful and that is why I still gave this a 5 star rating. It could very well have been our oven..I did read a suggestion in the comments to check the oven temp 30 minutes in and see what the temp was holding at by turning the oven on and adjusting the temp setting until the oven turned back on, and if it was under 350 to set the oven at 275 so the oven would kick back in to hold  the temp. I also locked the oven door to help hold the heat in. We will definitely use this recipe again tho..hopefully we will have our new oven by then..if not, I'll use a remote meat thermometer to keep a better eye on the temp of the roast.

Prime rib perfection! I’ve tried many prime rib recipes over the years and this recipe will be our “go to” from now on! I was a little nervous about the “shutting off the oven” concept, but the proof came when we carved into the 10.88 lb roast and found it perfectly medium rare. It was also seasoned to perfection - I did score the top before spreading the butter/herbs on. Delicious! Thank you for this recipe!

I have made this more than once for our family Christmas supper following the roasting directions and it came out perfect each time, just as pictured in the recipe.  I had a 13 lb. roast that I dry aged in the back of my refrigerator for 10 days.  About 5 hours prior to roasting, I took the rib roast out of the refrigerator to get it as close to room temperature as possible, although by roasting time the internal temp was still about 45 degrees.  This did not seem to affect the outcome.  I removed the cheesecloth and brushed the entire roast with avocado oil (high smoke point) and rubbed in homemade Montreal Steak Spice Rub (see below).  When ready, the roast was approximately 12 lbs.  This meant 60 minutes in the 500-degree oven, turn the oven off, then two hours in the closed oven - do not open the door.  I inserted a remote thermometer.  Because I am sometimes absent-minded, I taped the oven door shut with duct tape!  
The internal temp rose to 125 degrees in less than the two hours (glad I had the thermometer!), so I removed from the oven and tented.  This gave the roast 40-50 minutes of rest time, which appeared to be perfect.  Little juice escaped during that time and when sliced was extremely tender and juicy.  I had a hot cast iron skillet ready, as one adult in attendance and my grandchildren don't care for pink/red beef.  15 seconds per side on 3-4 slices did the trick.  The bones removed easily with a sharp knife.  The crust was steakhouse tasty.

This was my first time cooking a bone-in prime rib roast and I have a brand new oven that the apartment owners bought that was not displaying a correct temperature.  I bought a thermometer to place inside the oven to keep track of the temperature.  I placed the roast inside the oven at 500 degrees and cooked it for the correct time then turned off the oven.  I made the cardinal mistake and looked at the roast through the glass door of the oven after one hour in the off  position.  The inside oven temperature was under 175 degrees.  I got worried and TURNED ON the oven to 250 degrees for the last hour.  It still came out perfect.  Maybe a little more rare than the video.  Tender and tasty.  Better even than in the restaurants.  My wife loved the taste and tenderness.  I will use this recipe again and I hope I have a better oven next time so I can faithfully follow Chef John's cooking  instructions. If not, I'll try my way again.  
    A side note, the butter mixture DID NOT create a lot of smoke.  I didn't have to turn on a fan or open a window.

I used a different rub on my roast and your method. The roast turned out perfect even though it sat in the oven for about 3 hours. Definitely will use again.

Truth be told I was a little nervous about this recipe but after reading all they comments it seemed I'd be crazy not to give it a go.  How true!  It was absolutely perfect.  Since I have a new stove I followed the suggestion given by Carlos Guerva to check the temp after 1/2 hour.  As a result I did continue cooking ag 275 for another hour as recommended.  It could not have turned out any better!  Thank you.

This was an extremely nervous experience. 20 folks...21lb. - 7 bone Prime Rib. I'm a good cook but this process was nerve racking because I couldn;t check it. Too many folks to disappoint. End result. This was magic.  Pulled it out after 2 hours and Voila. Absolutely perfect and delicious.

Three ribs equaled 8.5 lbs and fed ten people perfectly.  Add one more rib if there are alot of big appetites.

I was a little nervous as my roast was only 3.22 lbs. 16 minutes @500° did not seem like enough time to get the nice brown crust. Plus I do not trust my oven, it's  electric and seems to blow a lot of heat out after turning off. So...after several minutes into the 2 hour off period, I turned it back on to 350 for a couple minutes. Maybe  twice, don't remember.  Anyway I did use a meat thermometer and it hit 130° 47 minutes early ! Took it out, let it rest a long time and it was perfect. So I guess I needn't have panicked adding that extra oven-on time.
Will do again. Next time no modification!!

I made this for Christmas dinner last night. Followed the recipe exactly (we had an 8lb roast with ribs still attached). This was by far the best prime rib we have had. Even better than some of the restaurants that specialize in prime rib. Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

I never cooked a prime rib myself and decided to try this for Christmas dinner for my family. I was a little skeptical of the process, but followed the recipe and instructions. The meat turned out PERFECT! Everyone (8 of us) watched as I cut the first piece and they, and I, were amazed at how perfectly it was cooked. And moist and delicious, too!

PERFECT! Didn't change a thing. Spiced perfectly. This with the Au Jus was Christmas dinner and it was gone and begging for more. Buying a bigger one next year. My caterer backed out so this was an emergency recipe find. I am not known for cooking. This, the garlic  red skinned mashed potatoes, garlic green beans and a portobello spinach w zip sauce which I will post saved my ars. When I announced at the end I cooked it..the family was stunned. My boyfriend..who is a bit of a chef himself had never heard of this method and agreed....perfect! Thank you!! My photo is the before..

I had a large roast, 9.5 lbs, so 48 minutes at 500 got a little smokey but was well worth it. Perfectly cooked, tender and oh so flavorful. Will always use this method.

I made no changes. It came out very rare. Several guests were unhappy so we put a few slices back in the oven for a few minutes. I probably will not use this recipe again.

Loved it.   Tried to soften the butter, ended up melting it.  Alas, with the herbs, pepper and salt covering the meat, followed the recipe to the letter and time.  A perfect result.    Chef John's Beef au jus turned out great as well.

Well... I started this recipe at 500 as per instructions. Then I started reading reviews. I was horrified to read that the roast HAD to be at room temperature or it wouldn’t work. I had only set it out for a half hour!  I turned the oven off at 20 minutes as stated and tried to think what to do. Rare is a good thing, raw is not. So I came across one review that told how to check the oven to see if it will stay hot enough. If not, the suggestion was to set the oven at 275 for an hour and then turn it off for the last half hour. So what I did was set it at 275 for the rest of the time. And lo and behold, when I tested it with the thermometer it was at 129— perfect!  After resting for 15 minutes it was a perfectly cooked medium rare roast. I know I lucked out. And the next time I will remember to bring the meat to room temperature so I can follow the recipe as written and not worry so much about whether or not I ruined an expensive piece of meat.

This is the only way to cook a Prime Rib with consistent results every time!!! We have followed this method of cooking prime rib  for 2 years and each time the results were nothing short of amazing. This time we purchased Wagyu A5 grade 16lbs of roast at $1200. We cut 5.6lbs for roast and cut 8/1.25 inch Ribeye Steaks. For us we cooked in oven at 500 for 28 minutes following the instructions with no deviations and turned off oven at 28 minutes and let the magic run its course (5 x 5.6=28). In order to ensure perfect cooking temperature we utilized a digital thermometer and pulled the meat out of oven at exactly 125 degrees. Keep in mind temperature on roast will continue to rise to about 135 as you let rest. Wagyu A5 quality meat is the best you can get and he quality is nothing short of amazing. Please reference 3 posted pictures of Wagyu A5 quality.

Awesome prime rib recipe.  Like everyone else I was a little skeptical about the cooking times, but it turned out perfectly. I did change from 5 minutes per pound to 6 minutes per pound because I'm not a fan of prime rib that is too rare. It turned out perfectly pink throughout and moist as could be. Thank you for the recipe.

Perfectly med rare. I shoved a few garlic cloves in the roast before cooking it. Cooked an 8.5 lb, used the math for roasting time. I also covered it with foil. Super juicy and delicious.

OMG!  This was amazing!! So glad I read the reviews about how to make this using a newer oven with a fan that cools the oven after it’s turned off! A huge help!!  Our meat sat out for about 2 hours instead of 4. Still perfect! This is most definitely a keeper! I can’t believe we forgot to take a picture! Used a whipped horseradish cream recipe from this site also! Yum!!

I adjusted time at 500 degrees to 38 min. for a 7 1/2 lb. roast. Then turned oven off for 2 hours ( did not open oven) The meat thermometer was in the roast and after 2 hours the roast was barely 119 degrees.  It did not work as planned.
  I am now finishing cooking it at 325 degrees until it comes to 140 degrees internal temp. Estimate about 2 hours more cooking time. I wish I had tried one of the other prime rib recipes.
The oven is calibrated and bakes everything else perfectly.

Chef John, every Christmas morning I roast a prime rib roast for our family breakfast.  This year I took your cooking advice and followed this recipe (with reservation) It came out AWESOME!! I had a 11.57 lb. roast, cooked it at 500 degrees for an hour, then shut the oven off. Waiting 2 hours, took it out and sliced it... OMG.. Perfect!!

Followed directions exactly and when the beef was supposed to be done the temp was only 110. 
Put oven back up to 350 and am waiting for it to come up to correct temp.

I followed the instructions and it turned out awesome!!   I did have to use the trick sent by Carlos of checking the oven temperature after 30 mins of turning it off  and did have to set it to 275 degrees for 60 mins.  Then shut off for the last 30 mins.    I have a new oven that does not hold the heat...but with that extra trick it turned out perfect!

Thanks so much

I do use what we all call the house seasoning.  Which is Paula Deen's house seasoning, 1c. salt, 1/4c. pepper  1/4c. garlic powder and put it on liberally while roast is getting to room temp.  This is the only way I cook my prime rib.  Chef John has given a fool proof way and is much better than paying high prices for a slice of prime in restaurants.  If any leftovers slice thin for sandwiches.  my husband now buys a bigger roast so we have leftovers.

Good flavor, but mine was done in less than 1 1/2 hours.  Ended up with meat that was overcooked as I was trying to keep it warm until the rest of the dinner was ready.

Works perfectly.  I've used it 3 times now to make a perfect rib roast, varied sizes, and it works every time.  Going to try it with a boneless roast tomorrow......I hope it works as well. I'm going to actually use a meat thermometer this time.

I did this last year (2017) for Christmas and the results were perfection.  I'll be doing it again this evening for Christmas Eve dinner cooking a boneless Rib Eye Roast.  I know the Chef says to use a bone-in roast, but I've found it doesn't matter.

This is the easiest roast recipes.  I have cooked this for several types of roasts, and it has been a success each time.  The only thing I do differently is to wrap the roast with 4-6 pieces of bacon. Take care to calculate your high-temperature time for the weight of the roast.

While I used a slightly different spice combo, this COOKING METHOD IS PHENOMENAL!  I made an 18 pound roast with 90 minutes at 500 degrees, two hours with oven off, and 30 minute rest. I fed twenty-eight senior citizens, with mushrooms, twice baked potatoes, Coca Cola jello, and blistered green beans. NOTHING LEFT!

Have done it twice with roasts around 8 pounds in the same oven. I had increase resting time (after the oven is turned off) about 20 more minutes.

I take issue with the 1757 calorie per serving listing in the nutrition information.

Easy and works perfect every time. Be sure to let the meat come to room temperature before cooking as the timing will not be right if you take the meat right out of the refer.
This is very true if you follow the directions your prime rib will be perfect as all of Chef John's recipes.

Perfect as promised. The timing using the math calculation produces a prime rib that is slightly more on the rare side of medium rare so I may increase the time a bit the next time. Instead of using the recommended seasoning, I used 1 tablespoon of Montreal Steak seasoning and 1 teaspoon of fresh ground pepper. It was great.

This was the most expensive cut of meat I've ever made. We got it from our in-laws as a Christmas gift. I was so worried because I had no idea how to make my most favorite cut of meat. I was sure I would ruin it. 
So when I found a similar recipe (same instructions, different seasonings) to this one I thought what the hell, I can either give it a try and hope for the best or let it go bad in the fridge while I worry about it, so I thought lets give it a try! What's the worse that could happen?
I was so stinking nervous thinking there's no way this can actually work. But after I carefully followed every step of these super easy instructions, I took that baby out of the oven and I made the first cut...….PERFECTION! Now, every Christmas I make this for friends and family and it's come out perfect every single time!

After reading all the reviews, I decided to try this method for my first ever prime rib. Since I have a newer oven, I knew I had a cooling fan so I lowered my oven to 200 after the 500 blast so that it would not get too cold. I also used a meat thermometer that I could read from the outside of the oven. I took the roast out at 130 degrees and I let it rest for 45 min. It was perfect! Medium rare with great flavor! The next day, I put the leftover slices in a pan and covered them with au jus to heat them up. They were just as good! Awesome recipe. Thanks Chef!

NOTE: Once you turn off the oven from 500 degrees-- DO NOT OPEN IT UNDER ANY CONDITIONS until the final click of your clock. Opening the oven door before then significantly reduces the set temperature, and GREATLY increases the chances of a ruined roast. Once that roast temperature drops--you cannot reheat it.  I added a tspn of garlic powder to the rub, for each 4lbs of weight. ?? Bon Appitite

I'm giving it 3 because of of one thing.  5 minutes per pound at 500 F.  I did a 14 pound roast and thr butter burned on the bottom of my pan so bad it made my house stink horribly with 15 people coming over.  I did it many times with smaller roasts and if WAS PERFECT.   There is a limit of time that butter can be at 500 F before it burns.  I think maybe a different method for anything over 10 pounds.  50 minutes is long enough otherwise smoke fills the house.

This was my first attempt of making prime rib! My husband loves prime rib and I wanted to surprise him with a great meal ( he normally does all the cooking) and he said we no longer need to go to a restaurant for him to eat prime rib anymore. This tasted better than any place we’ve had it before!!

I've followed this recipe exactly and have made it several times and it has turned out perfectly every time. The last time was at my mother in law's and I had to guard the oven as she was convinced it would not turn out well for the dinner party of 10. Maybe you can teach an old dog new tricks.

I made this last year for Christmas dinner.  1st time I've ever made a successful Prime Rib Roast!!!! It was superb!  My house didn't smell bad at ALL and no smoke.  I think my oven may cool off a little too quickly , because it was more rare than I'd like but that's an easy fix!  I couldn't be happier and am making it again this year!

The only thing I played with was cooking method.  I preheated to 500 on roast, then when I put the prime rib in, turned it the oven to convection for my minutes.  I found it roasted a little better.  It could be just my oven but I used this recipe many many times before trying the convection and it turned out perfect for me. I followed this recipe otherwise and wouldn't change a thing.

I used a different recipe for the initial basting, however the cooking time was performed and I must say it was perfect Medium Rare and very delicious.  I plan on using this method of cooking Prime Rib from now on.

The only changes I made I added garlics and onion powder. I didn't have kosher salt so I used black lava sea salt.  I also drizzled the bottom of the Pan with Olive oil so the butter would not smoke.

I have been making this for the past few years and it turns out perfect every single time.  I too hate when people rate a recipe but make changes to it.  I had to do that too based on the ingredients I had and other reviewers comments.  I dont buy herbs de provence so I use the standard Roast seasoning you get at any grocery store.  I bought a new house recently and the oven has a self cooling on it, so I turn the oven down to the lowest temp (100) and it still comes out great.  I've shared the recipe many times and the only time there is a complaint is when they don't follow the directions.  NO opening the door! Thanks to this great recipe I'm the designated prime rib maker in the family.

My late husband used this method and I "thought" I would never forget it, but I did. Have tried to duplicate it, unsuccessfully, for over 25 years. Couldn't get the timing right. Thank you, Chef John, Christmas 2018 will see a Perfect Prime Rib finally grace my table again. I'm practically in tears with joy at finding it.

I love this recipe. The recipe will not work if the meat is not room temperature.  I used rosemary , garlic, butter and salt  to season the roast. It  cooked perfectly.

Wooooooooo!!!    Yeah Baby!   This came out great!  Very easy to do and the aroma of the cooking meat just drives you crazy!  The hardest part of this recipe is the wait.   But it's worth it!   Some tips: Use a little more butter than you think you want to use.  Tape the oven door shut - the aroma is so good .  If you opt to warm your plate in the oven, make sure you REMEMBER that the plate is HOT.  I almost dropped my plated dish on the floor because my old man brain forgot that the plate was hot.   In the end follow the directions and enjoy the delicious, tender and moist meal.   I had mine with rice, stuffing and asparagus.

Absolutely the best prime rib I've ever eaten.
I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT - I cut pockets throughout the rib top and bottom and stuffed it with 12 halved garlic cloves.

Make sure to use the prime rib weight to initial cook time calculations. So simple and it works amazingly. I insert thin slices of garlic into the meat and place the mixture on overnight. I find it enhances the garlic flavor that my family loves.

Excellent recipe. I used a 9.6 pound roast and it came out perfect. I made minor changes in that I put garlic in rows between the ribs and added 1.5 minutes to the 500 degree time.  All the excess butter and grease fell off the roast and the family loved it.

This rocked! Very simple and fool-proof.  I'm allergic to lavender so used thyme and rosemary in my butter. I served this with the pear/Roquefort salad also on Allrecipes and very simply steamed asparagus, as well as wine.  The entire meal required less than 30 minutes of actual work, yet was a Glam meal.

I made no changes. Followed the directions to cook my 6 lb roast @ 500 for 30 minutes, left it in the oven for 2 hours, maybe a bit longer. It was cooked to perfection, and the buttery, salty flavor from the rub came through beautifully on the roast and in the au jus. Heavenly!  This was SO easy. 

And, as a bonus, this recipe has convinced me that when we redo our kitchen next year, I am going with the 48" range with 3 ovens so I have some other ovens to work with while this is resting for 2 hours :)

For years I've used another prime rib recipe from this site, but I found the results (doneness) to be inconsistent, although everyone always raved about how good it was.  My husband actually convinced me to to try this one a few months back, afraid it wasn't going to be as good.  Today I dug in my heels and told him I was trying a different recipe.  I'm so glad I did, it turned out perfect.  A couple things to note:
1.  I had an 8.5lb roast (3 bones), and let it sit on the counter for 4 hours.  I roasted it according to the formula for my roast's weight and it came out perfectly medium rare.
2. I changed the spices to my regular go-to blend, and just patted them on dry without the butter.   I'm glad I didn't use butter, as the oven had a fair amount of smoke coming out of the vent for almost an hour.  I kept my hood fan on as well as the house fan the whole time to keep the smoke alarm from going off.
3. Made the Chef John's Beef Au Jus (link in recipe) and strained it prior to serving.  The proportions of fat/broth/flour were perfect.
Will definitely make this my recipe for prime rib going forward.  Thank you Chef John!

Update: I tried this recipe at our cottage on an oven that's very "basic" (read: cheap).  It didn't turn out as well, it was too underdone.  Could have been the seal on the oven wasn't was good, I'm not sure.  I still use this recipe at home though with great results.

I cooked my almost 6 pound Prime Rib roast yesterday and it was delicious. I added 3 minutes to the required time at 500 degrees. 33 minutes total as I like it medium rare but slightly more towards the medium side. Just saying that you can adjust this great idea to your taste. I found the Herbs de Provence at Safeway.

I made this and it was good. I didn't use the herbes de Provence as I didn't have that, I did use lemon pepper, bake at the 500 degree and left it to set in oven for the 2 hours....it came out perfect and wonderful.  Had enough left over for later that week. I will use this recipe again. I used a oval shaped cast iron pan about 2 inches deep.

Followed John's guidelines to a 'T'.  My gas stove is still quite new but it was just a bit too 'MOO' even for me. By that I mean a bit too raw in the center.  Followed the math correctly but I think I will add 1.5 to 2 more minutes at 500 next time.  Overall?  Absolutely delish!

My fiancé and I both agree that this was the best steak/prime rib either of us have ever had! 
I varied on the spices (steak rub, garlic, rosemary), but other than that, this is THE way to cook a rib roast from here on out. I also put a half cup of stock in my roasting pan below the grate that the roast was on. Literal perfection.

Absolutely the best prime rib I have ever had.  Had it made it for Christmas Eve this past year and am about to make it again tomorrow for a birthday dinner.  The recipe was perfect exactly as written.  My family all loves their beef rare and this certainly didn't disappoint.

This method is amazing!  I was hesitant about leaving it in the oven because of all the curious family around, but I posted a warning on the oven and used packing tape to seal it even after a verbal exchange with everyone.  This was perfectly medium to medium rare when complete and delicious!  This is a permanent method for Prime Rib now.

Wow what a perfect recipe... my roast was almost 5 lbs and doing the math as explained inn the recipe the Prime Rib was cooked to perfection!!!

Everyone who enjoyed  firmly stated that it was restaurant quality and I have to agree....

I did not have to cut the ribs off because as soon as I took the roast out of the pan, they just fell off.  

I would recommend using a cast iron skillet or other heavy open proof skillet because it was easy to remove form the oven, remove the grease and prepare the au jus directly on the stove.

As an additional safety feature I placed a sign on the door "Do Not Open" as much for me as everyone else because it smelled so good cooking !

I have made this 5 times already and it is the hit with every group! I change up the seasoning part to match my groups tastes but other than that, it is a FAIL SAFE way to cook the best prime rib ever! If you follow the 5 minutes per pound rule of cook time it will be a borderline rare to medium rare every time. And of course for your guests that may want a more medium cut, a minute or two in hot au jus will fix that. The most important thing is the temperature. I use an oven thermometer to make certain it is 500 degrees before cooking.

Made it 6 times already.awesome foolproof recipe. I roasted it at 5 min a pound then 6 min a pound. We like 6 min a lb better. 7 min was too well. Possible an oven issue.but it’s a brand new oven by GE. Try it ,this recipe makes everyone a gourmet cook. Easy peasy! Thanks chef John.

One reviewer suggested testing the oven after the first heat blast. That was crucial for me because I had to turn it back on to finish the cooking. Although I would recommend 250° instead of 275. Turned out great and the aus jus was the topper. SO GOOD!!

This was my 1st attempt at a prime rib! Absolutely amazing! Perfectly cooked. Delicious crust!! Thanks to whoever put the note about checking your oven temp by turning it back on- as my over lost temp more quickly than it t should have- amazing suggestion.

I made this about a month ago and it was unbelievable. I used a 6 pound boneless prime rib and it was nice and pink/red and my family was in heaven. It was perfect. I didn’t change a thing. Followed the recipe exactly. I decided to make it again for Easter dinner yesterday and bought the same cut of meat (13.91 pounds for 12 people). I did the math just like before (5 min/pound at 500 degrees, then shut oven off and let sit for 2 hours). It was extremely over cooked and no pink meat in sight. I paid $125 for the meat and was so disappointed with the results. I’m guessing this mathematical formula does not work for large cuts of meat. I notice that people’s questions aren’t always answered on this site, but if anyone has had a similar experience or has an explanation as to why I had my results, I sure would appreciate some feedback.

Made this recipe with a 3 lb prime rib.  Cooked perfectly inside.  The outside of the roast was not as crispy as I prefer but I wonder if that was because it was such a small roast and only  at 500 for 15 minutes.  I will definitely cook all my prime rib this way!  So easy.

Used this and it was absolutely perfect!  I did follow Carlos Guerva's suggestion in the review for dealing with an over that cools down too quick (cooling fan!)  Everyone was amazed with the flavors and the perfect pink!

I wanted to make a dish for Xmas Dinner and found this recipe. Could not have been easier, I follow  exactly except I dry aged my 8 lb rib for 48 hours in the fridge.  My family was amazed as I was, I recommend this to everyone . I was also surprised on how this method was able to keep this expensive piece of meat from shrinking allowing to serve up to 12  with one big piece for me. Thanks Chef John!

I will never make a prime rib any other way. I didn't have any herbes de provence so used a combination of oregano, basil, thyme, pepper and fresh minced garlic. While we do like rare beef we prefer our beef roasts cooked just a bit more so I used 6 minutes a pound at 500 and it turned out a perfect medium to light pink. This is so easy, definitely a keeper!
 For those experiencing a lot of smoke this requires a clean oven. Even a little spill smokes a lot at this temp.

Foolproof, delicious!   I used salt, pepper, thyme n rosemary.  Left it on the counter for 3-4hours beforehand , need to take the chill out of the meat so it cooks evenly.

I've been making prime rib for a few years now and this was a big disappointment.  When the roasts go on sale during the holidays I always purchase & freeze extras so we have apx 3-4 roasts a year for birthdays and special occasions.  I ALWAYS rely on a meat thermometer to be in my roast while cooking so I can keep an eye on the temp.  NEVER rely on time with any prime rib recipe.  Ok... to start I was wanting to try a new recipe and see if there were better methods than my current as I usually have a bit of overdone meat around the edges & I was hoping to even it out.   I made NO changes to the recipe & let my roast get to room temp before cooking.  Today, I had an 8lb roast.  I think 40 mins was too long to blast at 500 degrees as I had a burnt crust all over the top and a smokey kitchen.  I shut off the oven after 40 mins, checked my oven temp (newer convection oven) after 30 mins and it showed to be at 335 degrees so I continued cooking and walked away.  At this time, I was a little concerned about the temp of my roast because it was already at 90 degrees, it usually takes much longer with my other methods to get to this temp.   This should've been my first clue but I instead chose to trust the method and rating of this recipe.  I went to help the kids with their homework in another room for a short while.  Upon my return I found the roast to be at 125 degrees!!  I yanked it out and let it sit for about 10 minutes while I put together some quick side meals. before carving

Was absolutely perfect. I have a newer oven and thought it would keep the heat well, but I used a thermometer, and found that I needed to follow Carlos Guerva's tip to check it in 30 minutes and bump it back up to 275 for an hour if it was less than 325. Worked perfectly!

I followed Chef John’s instructions and it came out perfectly. The meat was moist and tender and delicious. The outside was crisp and salty. I have not used Herb de Provence before and it was amazing. I made sure mine had lavender in the melange!  I had already cut off my bones and used them in a different recipe, so my roast was boneless. But it didn’t seem to affect the outcome. I will be making this again. It is a real showstopper if you are having people over!  My only question is how do I make Yorkshire pudding if I’m not allowed to open the oven? Lol!

I could never cook prime rib properly and hated spending the money on such an expensive cut of meat until I tried this recipe and now we all love my prime rib. Thanks for sharing and I won't use any other recipe when I cook prime rib.

This is my go to recipe for Christmas dinner, always comes out great. If its a little to rare for you, you can always slice it and warm up the slices to cook them a little more.  I recently used this recipe to cook  a bottom round roast and it came out great too, it was no prime rib but it was a nice roast beef!

I made it exactly as written except for the seasoning and I let it sit out at room temp for about 3-3.5 hours. It turned out mouth watering goodness!! Even my 3.5 year old was smiling and dancing as he ate it because it was soooooooo good!! Sorry, no pic.

This came out great!  I’m glad I read reviews from some cooks about the type of oven you may have...mine is a fairly new one that has a fan that comes on to cool down the oven when shut off.  The suggestion was to shut off the circuit breaker to the oven after the initial 500 degree blast to prevent it from cooling down too fast, therefore preventing too rare meat.  We did this and the roast was perfect!

Followed Chef John’s directions exactly!  I was a bit worried when the calculation for my 12.77 lb roast came to 64 minutes at 500 degrees. My oven is a bit of a beast so this was more medium than I like, but the rest of the family love medium. Next time I will only go an hour and a half with the oven off. Still getting rave reviews the following day. Chef John’s au jus recipe was also perfect!!

I've made Prime Rib this way several times now, and it never fails to amaze me how perfect the result and how easy the method is .  Kudos, Chef John for including the formula for larger or smaller cuts-it is a huge help.  CAUTIONARY TALE...do not be tempted to "LOCK" the oven door as I did.  Thought that would seal in the heat.  MY BAD.   DOING SO TURNED THE OVEN OFF. 3hrs later I had a raw roast with company  due in an hour.

Minor changes only:  while the roast was warming to room temperature, doused it with soy sauce for a little extra flavor.  
Perhaps added a little spice, here and there.  
The accolades were Unprecedented!  My guests couldn't stop raving over the prime rib!

AMAZING!   My first time to make prime rib. So good!  Whole family loves it!  When cooking at 500 I moved the rack down one below the middle so didn’t have as much of an issue with it smoking.

Made this twice:  once with a $4.25/lb rib roast from Kroger, about 3.5 lb - coated it in butter, seasonings and salt like this recipe.  Turned out awesome.  Second time, for Christmas Day, bought an 8.5 lb rib roast for $11.99/lb from a meat market.  Rubbed it all over with Cavender's Greek seasoning and did not use the butter and salt.  Probably did not let it come to room temperature long enough because the inside was too rare.  But wow, we ate from both ends and man oh man, it was fabulous.  Had the butcher cut the bones and tie it back up.  Was much easier to carve this way.  Got rave reviews from the family!   Saved the bones and threw them into a crockpot beef stew the next week.  WOW - there was a lot of meat left on those bones and it made my stew absolutely scrumptious.  Since I have two ovens in my kitchen, I did not have a problem tying up an oven all day on Christmas.  Put that bad boy in and let it cook all morning while we were opening presents.  Served it with mashed potatoes and green beans (forgot the mac & cheese - d'oh!).  Probably going to be my go-to meal every Christmas from now on.  Love love love!

Everyone loved this. I followed Carlos Guerva's advice on checking temperature, and I'm  glad I did- my oven did need that extra bit of heat to cook the prime rib.

Turned out perfect!  I tested my oven after reading Carlos Guerva’s comment and found it to be less than “heat fast” so I followed his recommendation for dealing with that.  Thank you, Carlos!  I wanted some more well done slices so I left the roast in at the initial high temp a bit longer (per another comment), and that worked fine as well.

I made this using Chef John's method, but seasoned with Pride of Szeged steak rub and it came out fantastic! I also took Carlos Guerva's suggestion regarding oven temperature drop, and had to turn back on to 275* for the hour. Will be making this often for the holidays.

I followed the recipe exactly and had a perfect prime rib.  I made an 8-1/2 lb. prime rib.  I also used Chef John's Au Jus recipe.  It was also perfect.

Made it exactly as written -- and, it is perfect!!  You will definitely want to follow Carlos Guerva's review with instructions about the oven temps as the new ovens all cool down so quickly.   I also made the Au Jus from Chef John - so good!!

I put off making a prime rib for years because the thought of screwing up a $100+ piece of meat bothered me. For New Years Eve I made a 7.5lb for the first time ever and there is no way I could be happier with the result. My wife ate hers without a knife it was so tender and my friend said it was as good or better than any he's had in a restaurant. My take was it was absolutely perfectly cooked, seasoned and could not possibly have been any easier to make. I can't wait to make it again.

Very easy recipe to prepare. Followed the instructions to the letter and was rewarded with a perfectly cooked prime rib. I will admit I was skeptical with the cooking instructions and had never heard off turning the oven off to cook the roast. Trust the instructions and you too will be rewarded.

We made this rib for Christmas. Butter in your mouth sooo Good. The only thing is the Au Jus it's not traditional more like gravy. Recommend making an Au Jus with cornstarch not APF.

This is the best Prime Rib I have ever eaten and I made it!       Oh-My-Goodness!
I've tried once before to cook a Prime Rib without the proper recipe.It was horrible. 
   I followed this recipe to the T and it came out perfect. My roast was 5.65 lb and so I cooked it for 28 minutes at 500 degrees and then shut off the oven and left it in there for 75 minutes. Wrapped it in foil and left it on the counter for another 10 minutes.  The outside was beautiful. Just like the picture. The flavors was so good. It was mostly medium rare which one of my sons is not fond of,  so he took the slice closest to the side. He gobbled up ever bite. I will make this the same again and again.

My first attempt at Prime Rib (7.6 lbs).  I usedChef John's math method and roasted at 500 degrees for 39 minutes followed by 2 hours in oven after turning off oven.  Meat temp at time of extraction: 138.degrees.  As you can see.: A perfect bark and restaurant perfect presentation.  Follow Chef John's video, you can't go wrong.

I followed the cooking formular exactly and the prime rib came out a perfect medium rare. I seasoned the outside of the roast with olive oil then salt, pepper and garlic before roasting.

I usually do Prime rib on the rotisserie, but this time I tried Chef John's recipe. Easy and as he said foolproof. Medium rare and delicious.  The oven did smoke a bit due to the high temp/butter,but it was worth it!

This recipe is amazing and - with some adjustments made for a really crappy oven - almost foolproof. My oven (and stove) is full of surprises. It either hyper-heats, under-heats or behaves.* I just never know. So following this recipe would have been unthinkable except that I've made it before.

One of the other commenters said they have an oven like this, too, and would periodically turn their oven on to 200 to warm it up again. It was stone cold soon after turning it off to sit! I took my lead from them and did the same thing. 

Additionally, we prefer our meat temperature cooked to medium. For my three bone standing rib roast, I added an additional 45 mins oven time.

Since I don't have herbs de provence, I used a blend of kosher salt, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, and black pepper. Massaged it into our happy beast and shoved it in the oven.

Perfection. Melt-in-the-mouth perfection.

I used ingredients for this recipe just as suggested.  Only change I made ( I don’t like pink meat either) which was suggested by another  user.  I cooked a 5.56 lbs bone in prim rib at 500 degrees for 25 mins then reduced heat to 325 degrees and cooked for another 2 hours this came out medium well or almost well done. Served with low cholesterol garlicky mashed potatoes and green beans. Yum made me look as if this wasn’t my first time making a prime rib. Bon appétit!

I would says medium rare would be a better goal, with cooking time at 4.5 times the weight.  I was happy with the flavor, but my people like it a little more juicy.  I will try this again with my edits

I rated it 4 because I changed the recipe.  This may have come out perfect but I read the comment of the guy that said to check the oven temperature at 30 minutes.  He said if it is below 325, set the oven to 275 and cook for an hour, turn the oven off for 30 minutes and remove the roast.
Don't do this.  Mine came out cooked to medium.  not what I had in mind.

I just made this for Christmas dinner and it was an absolute hit!  We had a 12 lb prime rib.  The night before, I washed it and patted it dry.  I then rubbed the meat with garlic and seasoned with salt and pepper on all sides, generously.  I let it sit in the fridge over night, uncovered.  I took the rib roast out first thing in the morning and let it come to room temperature, about 5+ hours.  I used the garlic mix from the garlic prime rib recipe from this site, put a meat thermometer in.  Did my calculation per Chef John's direction and then turned off the oven and waited the 2 hours.  Almost exactly at the 2 time, the temp of the roast was at 125°!!  Amazing!  I made the au jus recommended and this meal was absolute perfection!  Thank you Chef John!

This recipe is just too easy.   My husband followed the directions, popped it in the 500 degree oven for 30 minutes and then just let it sit.  We have a newer oven that is not convection and it had no problem cooking the roast to medium rare in two hours.   This will definitely be the only recipe that we use going forward.  And yes, we had to remove the batteries from the smoke detectors.

Great recipe that does not need any fooling with. Make sure that you have a thermometer in the oven so you can get it to a true 500 degrees. Oh and put more salt than you think you will need.

Instructions were not specific whether the roast should be covered in foil or not.  The rub was bland so the roast was as well.  The roast was overdone for me.  This was my Christmas dinner and my guests were not impressed.  Expensive meat to have this kind of reaction.  I will use the recipe I used last year and not this one. 

I don't understand the raves other than the meat isn't over cooked.

I saved this recipe because we loved the herb de province butter on the roast and loved how the 500 F blast crisped up the outside of the roast.  However, our oven loses heat too fast and we prefer your roast medium rare.  So I turned the heat to 325F and cooked till done, about 20 min per pound at the lower temp.  Hum!

Came out perfect! Just as the instructions said.
I didn't have Kosher salt, so I used  Himalayan sea salt instead.

I did an herbed olive oil rub first then applied the seasoned butter rub, I added minced garlic to the butter rub. As I had a 10# standing rib roast I put it in the oven for 50 minutes at 500 degrees, based on the equation given at the beginning of the recipe. Turned out great ????. Only other thing that I would do is to cook the roast maybe about 20 minutes longer as it was just a bit too much on the rare side instead of medium-rare

Yes, at first I was a little skeptical. I cooked a 9.49 lb prime at 500 for 47 min, then shut the oven off, and to my surprise it was cooked perfectly. Will definitely use this recipe again!

I followed the recipe to the T, and it turned out to be the best prime EVER.  This was a 9.8 lb 4 bone Prime Rib.  I multiplied 5 minutes per pound and viola, perfecto!

This was a perfect recipe! I had never used Herbs de Provence before and I questioned the amount of salt and pepper in the recipe but only until I tasted it!  The "crust"  was savored as much as the perfectly cooked meat inside. It was honestly the best prime rib I have ever eaten and so proud that it was I who prepared it! Don't change a thing in this recipe, and make sure to do the math! ;-)

I made this and was very pleased that it worked so well. I bought a 15.86 lb roast and roasted it for 76 min at 500 degrees, then turned the oven off for two hours with the door closed. Came out absolutely perfect for me and my guests! Highly recommend.

I cooked a 7 lb roast and followed the directions perfectly. The rub is amazing however, mine turned out more medium to medium rare. We like rare roasts.  Next time should I cook it 4 minutes per pound to get rare

Yes! I'll certainly make it again. The crust on this roast was beyond delicious and it got standing applause from our family and guests. 
The only adjustment I'd make would be to leave it in at 500 about 5-7 minutes longer. This was a 6-1/2 lb. roast and I did the math...sort of. It came out pretty rare which was fine for all of us since we're committed carnivores, but in the future I'll double check with our guests first. Thanks!

Great recipe, my family doesn't not like the meat too bloody so I changed the cooking time a bit.  I turned it down to 325 instead of off and cooked for 1 hour and then turned it off and cooked for 1 hour.  I could have taken it out after 1/2 hour off and it would have been a little more pink.  I would not mess with the coating it was great!

I figured with all the positive reviews this was a safe recipe to try. Oh my goodness!! It was amazing. The meat was so tender we used butter knives - and the flavor was absolutely amazing. Even my family that doesn't like prime rib was gobbling it up. I used an 8.82 lb roast and let it sit out until the internal temperature was 50 (my research said that was sufficient). I had to double the butter rub but otherwise I followed it to a tee. Best prime rib I've ever eaten.

I made it exactly as the recipe call for and it was fantastic. My prime rib was just under 3lbs, so I cooked it at 500f for 14 minutes. Turned the oven off and let it sit for 2h. The temp was 130, perfectly medium rare. I also did the Au Jus. Just added a bit of red wine. Also excellent.

I must admit, I bought a pre-seasoned, but raw prime rib roast from my local butcher.  I have never made prime rib before, and was scared to death I would screw it up.  I stumbled on Chef John's recipe, and it was "the formula" that sold me.  Just in case, I  bought a digital thermometer with a leave-in probe to ensure my oven didn't mess things up.  Then, I simply applied his formula for cooking this really expensive piece of meat, and it was PERFECT!

This works perfectly. I used this method for a 14.5 lb. standing rib roast (following John's guidelines for larger roasts) with no issue. I did use a different rub and put on a bed of vegetables (which cartelized beautifully). Au Jus is great, too.

This almost ruined my $100 christmas prime rib. It came out well done! 8.48lb x 5 = 43 minutes at 500° rest two hours ... Also the au jus wasn't good either .

I made a 6 lb roast and this was an amazing recipe!  

Best one I ever made flavor was pure heaven, thank you for sharing! I also add garlic cloves into the meat and cut a grove between the bones and the meat. This helps when we are craving.

I followed Chef John’s instructions completely and it came out perfectly. The temperature was 124-126 and was a tad rare but I didn’t want to risk ruining it by putting it back in the oven. The au jus was delicious as well. Next time, I will use an indwelling thermometer to keep track of the temp.

I followed this and Carlos Guerva (a user with a review on this recipe page) and between the two of them it turned out absolutely perfect. After the initial 20 minutes at 500 degrees I turned off the oven for about half an hour and then did about an hour at 275 and then about 45 minutes with the oven turned off. I really thing that the key to doing prime rib is to make sure the meat is at room temperature before cooking it.

We followed the recipe exactly and the prime rib was just about raw on the inside. I can only assume it was what other people had mentioned about the oven  vent. If you have a newer oven I wouldn’t use this method. Love the other Chef John recipes though. Especially the perfect mashed potatoes. They were exactly that!

This roast was out of this world...my husband looked at me.. his words... Oh my good, I never tasted as good as this!  I only purchased a 2 rip Prime from Fresh Market , enough for 2  and was nervous to follow the directions , since it was so much smaller as I normally prepare. I added a Demi-glaze to the drippings... finger licking good. Chef John, my compliments! Can’t wait to prepare a larger roast.

No changes. Made it for a family Christmas dinner of 16. It was outstanding. Many compliments. So tender with a fantastic flavor and texture. Second time I made it I did not use convection setting. Instead, I used regular bake setting and no smoke. Both times I made it, it was fantastic and so flavorful. A recipe to be saved! Thanks Chef John!

This is the only method I use to make my prime rib roast. It's perfect! I have been using this method for years. If your oven smokes while using high temp. I would suggest that you make sure your oven is clean and free from oils and Just like any other oven recipes oven temps. are not all equal.

I thought the seasoning and butter left a nice outer crust that was very tasty but it didn't carry over into each bite, only the bite that had the edge on it.

I have been cooking prime rib for years. I’ve seen this recipe around but was always too afraid to try it. Decided I would try it for my Christmas Eve gathering. I must say I was very anxious while it was cooking for 46 minutes at 500 degrees. Followed recipe exactly. I was terrified that it would be raw or way over cooked. Much to my disappointment it was overcooked. A little pink but definitely cooked medium, not my preferred medium rare. I have a new oven that tends to hold the heat and I think that might have been a factor. The rub was fantastic. Provided great flavor. I will try this cooking method again.

I know that this is an "older" recipe but I have been making it for Christmas for 2 years now and it's awesome.  I have not had the smoking problem with my oven and I'm not worried about leaving the meat out at room temperature like some have mentioned because I figure that any surface bacteria that develops will get seared off in the 500 degree oven!!  It's super juicy and delicious.  My tripping point is some of my family likes it cooked for longer and so I'm tweaking the time at 500 this year and hoping for the best!

I used this "method" and after 3 hours I had a roast that was brown on the outside and raw on the inside. I have a "modern" oven, but I don't think all ovens retain the heat at a level needed to actually keep cooking the meat.

This was my first Prime Rib, an 8.3 lb one at that and I was a bit concerned (42 min at 500 degrees).  I followed Chef John's instructions and it  came quite well. It was closer to rare in the middle  and med rare on the outside.  I had the nice crusty outside. I did not have the smoking problems others have mentioned even though I have  an older  smaller wall gas oven as I live in an older mobile home.   I want to thank Carlos G in the comments for suggesting to check on the oven temp at 30 min. Your instructions  saved my prime rib from being totally rare. ( I figured the seal would not be as tight in my oven as newer ones. ) I did use herbs in the butter  - dill, basil and crushed rosemary, and of course the salt.

This was THE most delicious. Absolutely my favourite meal. My girlfriend laughed when I told her how I would cook it. She said, no way it would be done using this method. Did I prove her wrong. She was praising the results for days.

I did exactly as Chef John described.  The roast turned out well but the oven looked like a bomb went off in it.  It spattered all over the oven and even smoked while I roasted it for the first 40 mins.(8 lbs).  Delicious but seriously alot of work to clean the oven after a dinner party!

Had a 2 pd roast, used 1/8 c butter, baked 10 mins, but 2 hours too long!  Would reduce to an hr next time..,, but great flavor!

It is cooking now.  Am I the only one who had an issue with the butter sticking to the roast.  Every time I moved the roast, what butter it had on chunked right off.  The roast was room temp as with the butter.  I also wiped the roast with a paper towel the second time I attempted to spread the butter on it.

This method of cooking (20 minutes / 2 hours) is faultless; however, trying to smear herb-infused butter onto the prime rib is nearly impossible.  Next time I make this I will eliminate the butter and just use the herbs, pepper and salt.

I was curious to see if this method would also work with other roast cuts? Some family members don’t like all the extra gristle and fat that come on the PR.

I followed the directions closely, but this did not complete cooking in my Samsung range.  Possibly it could work in other ranges.  I had to turn the oven back on to finish cooking and still didn't get it done quite enough as it was very rare in the center.  Good recipe, just not with my oven.

This was our Thanksgiving dinner as I don't like turkey. 
Worked perfect. (Our roast was 4#). 
Mixed some special Southern Maryland seasoning with bacon grease and rubbed away... 
I did put the roast in as the oven was heating up as I wanted a nice crust. Placed a remote digital thermometer in it when I placed it in the oven and pulled it when it was 132 degrees. Let rest... YUMMY!

I love prime rib and this is far better than any prime rib I have been served in any restaurant. It can be intimidating to fixed this expensive of a roast but it is so worth it. And soooo easy!!

QUESTION: Has anyone tried using a boneless roast that turns out similarly? If so, what changes did you make?? I've only done the bone in, and it's so good that I want to be able to adapt it to a boneless version.
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this. I have made this recipe many times, and it is hands down my favorite prime rib recipe. I love that it applies to whatever size roast you have! Most of all, the roast truly does turn out to be a delicious and perfect medium rare. My daughter prefers hers cooked a bit more which I can easily accommodate after the fact by tossing it back in the oven for a spell. You do have to plan a bit since the roast needs to sit out so long before cooking, but prime rib is totally worth planning for! Try this recipe! It is super easy and scrumptious!!!

I cooked exactly like it said. However, I added kosher salt to outside of the roast the morning of cooking and blotted the outside dry several times to dry out the outside and make it crusty. So delicious. My mother-in-law told me (after she ate) she has always hated prime rib but absolutely loved this. I served it with au jus and sour cream horseradish sauce.

Wonderful recipe however, my timing was off.  The instructions were accurate but, my oven is convection so it was more medium than medium rare.  Next time I'll try 4 minutes per pound.

I LOVE this recipe!!!  I follow it exactly for everything except the seasonings...I add a small amount of garlic powder, since we love garlic. This doesn't change the flavor a lot from the recipe posted, just gives it a slightly better kick. This will be my 4th time making my prime rib using this recipe. Fool proof, delicious and medium rare!!!  I make a horseradish sauce to go with thi, which adds a nice touch.

It did turn out as said rare....I prefer medium rare. I rated it four as it was too salty...and gravy way too salty!!!!

I usually make the foolproof prime rib on this site for the holidays. It is foolproof and delicious. I will make it from now on.....It was a good time to try a different recipe since it is just for husband and I.  He liked it but commented on the saltiness.

I am a follower of Chef John....love most of his recipes.  But I won't make this again.

We made this at Christmas at the in-laws house and it was the star of the event! We made it exactly as directed and it was totally perfect. We served it with garlic smashed potatoes, port baked cranberries with orange zest, salad, and green beans. Every bit was eaten with gusto! If you are a certified carnivore this one is a keeper!

I've made this recipe 3 times now and it's come out perfectly every time.  I was very nervous about spending so much money on the roast but it was absolutely perfect, and my family raved about it for days.  I would not change a thing!  An inexperienced cook can make this foolproof recipe, even though it seems intimidating.

This is my new go to for Standing Rib.  I was fixing a boneless cut so I reduced the cook time to about 3 minutes per pound.  I also like it very rare.  It cooked the whole roast including the end pieces to a uniform doneness.

Prepared the rib exactly as Chef John instructed.  Outstanding results, although I admit I had doubts, enjoyed by everyone.  The math worked well on our 6 1/2 lb roast.  Highly recommend trying this easy way to prepare an expensive cut of beef.  Have now made it this way several times with predictable results.  Thanks again Chef John.

I had a 3.75 lb prime rib and followed these directions exactly and it came out too raw! I have a gas oven so I'm not sure if that was a factor in the roast being undercooked. The next time I will try another prime rib recipe as this one was disappointing

I had a 2 1/4 pound piece of prime rib and followed the recipe to perfection!  Because I'm watching my cholesterol intake I omitted the butter mixture, but using just salt, pepper, and some garlic powder made the roast delicious!  I definitely will use this recipe again.

This was my first time making prime rib ever. I followed the recipe though I did change the spice mix to fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, pepper and minced garlic. Other then the seasoning change I followed the recipe exactly and my prime rib came out perfectly! This recipe is so easy and tastes delicious.

Outstanding! Please follow re: time to get to room temperature and ensure your oven is hot enough. 
I thought I could fudge it with a Convection countertop setting @ 450...it worked but the result was "Bleu" rather than rare/med rare.
Oh, and I used salted butter as that's all I ever have and sliced fresh garlic into the fat...yum!

OMG!!! I can't believe how easy this is! I was always afraid to try doing a prime rib for fear of ruining an expensive cut of meat and the holiday meal for all.  But no more!! This is the fool proof method for making a medium rare prime rib.  The options are endless!

This was very good.  Unfortunately  my oven loses too much heat and I had to adjust the cooking time.   The seasoning was also excellent.    I highly recommend this!

I was definitely skeptical about cooking it for such little time and turning the oven off but what a surprise.  This was my first prime rib (I've always been afraid to ruin a pricey piece of meat) but it turned out amazing.  I will always cook any future prime ribs this way.

Thanks for posting this recipe, I have shared it with friends. People are shocked when I tell them this is how I have been making my prime rib for years.  Question from a friend, she has a gas oven, which she doesn't think holds temp as long as electric, does she cook it the same amount of time?

I used a more spicy rub but I used this technique and it worked great. This was for company so I also ran one of those digital thermometers into the center of the roast to make sure it came out right. I prefer an internal cooked temp of 135 and this came out perfect. Use the thermometer trick and you can take this any where you like.  Chef J is a genius - this really works well.

This recipe was so EASY and came out PERFECT!! The hardest thing was making sure no one opened the oven door! The only thing I did differently was used Chupacabra Rub. Very delicious! This recipe is definitely one that I will save and will be my go-to method for cooking prime rib. So many others recommended varying temps, checking doneness with a thermometer, etc. this one was SO hassle free! Thank you Chef!

This was so easy and surprisingly stressful for the first time. I wasn't sure I could trust my oven but everything worked out in the end. I didn't have the the exact spice required so I looked up the ingredients which i had and made my own. It was cooked perfect. Restaurant quality.

This is, by far, the easiest and best-tasting recipe for a perfectly cooked, medium rare rib roast.  Absolutely delicious, and super-easy!  I'll admit, I was a bit nervous starting at 500 degrees and just leaving it in the oven for two hours turned off, but it was perfect!  It was cooked exactly as described and the flavor was great!  I will never cook a roast any other way!

Perfect prime rib however, the butter smoked so much it drove everyone into a separate room and "ruined" my lady's new oven. I'm thinking some adjustment using a less smoky oil. Olive? Olive and butter?

Absolutely perfect technique! Yes I was nervous but it worked very, very well! Folks, we're talking good steak house quality prime rib results! I might reduce the pepper next time. And I think my stove isnt' quite as well insulated as others. I found the prime rib was a tad cold after 2 hours so next time (oh, yes, there will be a next time!!!)I'll just gave it a 5 minute blast of heat to warm it up.

I've tried a lot of recipes for the perfect prime rib roast and now I've  found it. Juicy, tender, and acclaimed to be the best one yet. I made a "similar "herb mixture, adding onion and  garlic  powder. Didn't  have time to get the 5 lbs roast  to room temperature but it still baked perfectly.

I have a 3 year old natural gas stove with digital control.  My roast turned out so rare I could have slapped a bandage on it and watched the cow walk away.
My suggestion is to put a remote read thermometer into the roast to be sure it comes to temperature before shutting off the heat.

It was good and was great to learn how to cook this cut.  However, I did follow another members recommendation and cooked it at 325 degrees for an hour and then let it rest for an hour.  It was still to rare for me...meat was cold I'm guessing because the oven isn't a spring chicken.

Oh my, this was so good! It turned out beautifully. I made my own herb mixture and used Chef John's au jus recipe.  Yum!

The foodwishes video says to leave the roast out six hours or overnight. My roast was just under 3.5 pounds and I left it out for six hours,  but it could have stayed out even longer.

Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!

Perfect recipe.  I have always been complimented on my perfect prime rib roasts but when my sister asked me for directions I wasn't sure how to describe my method so I googled and found Chef John's recipe.  She raved that it was perfect so I decided to try it when I had no company.  I followed directions as per recipe but added onions, parsnips and carrots around the roast.  I first tossed veggies in olive oil and tossed with salt and pepper.  The roast was perfect medium rare and veggies were yummy. Enough dripping left for delicicious gravy.  Roast was 3.3 lbs. with lots of fat.

Made this exactly the way it was written and it was absolutely delicious. Better than the local steakhouses where we usually go for prime rib.  We love it med rare so if you have people who want it less pink you'll need to let it stay in the oven longer.

Thank you Chef John, your recipe and the information on cooking the meat if you have a newer oven with a fan, from Carlos made it possible for me to make the 1st successful prime rib we have ever made.  It was fantastic!  Perfectly cooked.  Thank you to your both. :)

This is the easiest recipe to make.  This prime rib came out FANTABULOUS!!!   Everyone loved it and wanted to know my secret!  I cooked an 8.5 lb boneless roast for 7 people.  It was medium rare in the middle, PERFECT!!!  I'll absolutely use this recipe again and again!

I have made this two times and both times the prime rib turned out better than I could ever imagine.  The two times I made this recipe, I was cooking for 6 people, so I bought 10lb boneless roasts.  Instead of taking the weight of the meat x's 5 minutes, I took it x's 4.25 minutes as I didn't want to cook the meat for 50 minutes at 500 degrees.  My only suggestion for those who do cook larger pieces of meat is to multiply the weight by 4.25 minutes and  you will get the perfect pink you crave.

Happy cooking!

Perfect! Incredible! It is all about letting the meat come to room temp and cooking per Chef John's equation here. Honestly, the rub of spices on the exterior does not penetrate far and it not a make or break aspect of this recipe. This is our save-forever-prime-rib recipe now.

I have tried this 3 times with varying sized prime rib roasts (6-8 lbs).  The first time, we did not have our sides done at the 2 hour mark and meat was medium due to our error.

2nd time got closer and was at med rare/medium and while it briefly sat on each person's plate, it cooked to medium.

3rd time was the charm.  But I did a few changes.  First, instead of 38 mins with oven on, I only did 35 mins.  In addition,I used a Maverick meat thermometer and monitored the internal meat's temp.  When it hit 130, I removed from oven and it's heat.  Meat was medium rare and perfect.

This is a great way but rather than relying solely on the math (since meat and bone size, oven's working condition, etc) which all affect, it is best to augment with a meat thermometer.

This recipe was not complicated and yielded a juicy, flavorful end product! Though I did have to search this area for the herbs de Provence, the most difficult thing was keeping the oven door closed the whole time! (household members will smell it cooking and be tempted to open it!) Tape a "do not open!" sign to it!

I have made standing rib roasts before and labored a lot more than listed here.  I was interested to try this method because it closely resembles the way I cook a whole beef tenderloin (for Filet Mignon).

I followed "Chef John's" cooking instructions to the letter and I can say with no reservation that this is BY FAR THE BEST STANDING RIB ROAST RECIPE I have EVER used!

I made some small preparation changes.  I cut the meat away from the bone so that I could dry brine (salt cure for 24 hours) prior to cooking.  My family is not big on Herbes de Provence so I used salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder for seasoning.

The roast came out a BEAUTIFUL medium rare, all that nice red meat inside a crust of caramelized yumminess!  If you don't like rare beef then you might to consider a different recipe or alter the cooking time.  

Thank you Chef John for this most AWESOME recipe!

I had never made Prime Rib before so this Christmas dinner I decided it was time to do it.  Chef John's  great video for directions armed me well.  I followed the directions exactly.  I had a little trouble with my smoke detector, I believe it is because I have a very cheap oven without a good seal.  It was a little under done for our taste so I quickly put it back in my oven at 350 and cooked it while making AuJus (also Chef John's recipe).  The rest is history.  I do feel a little embarrassed for the constant moaning that kept coming from me. :)

Make sure you have a probe thermometer and DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR  PERIOD--!!! we did a 7 lb roast--500 degrees for 45 -50 minutes--turn oven off--AGAIN DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR PERIOD--wait for thermometer to reach 137-140 degrees for a true medium doneness ( However long that takes usually 2 1/2- 3 hrs) I REPEAT DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR !!! you can use whatever seasoning you like -this is what i chose to use - i seasoned mine the night before and plastic wrapped it-take it out following AM and let sit for at least 4 hrs (more for larger roasts)--- YUMMALICIOUS ---!!!

This the second year I have used this recipe and it is excellent.  I didn't let it set out to room temperature quite long enough.  Next time, I will take the prime rib out several hours before I cook.  That seems to be the secret to not having overly rare meat.  Even rare, it is delicious.

I had a 5 3/4 Lb 2 bone rib roast, cranked the oven up to 520 and cooked for 27 minutes, then turned the oven off. I had a digital oven thermometer inserted half way into the center of the roast and also used a timer. At 2 hours after the oven was turned off the thermometer registered 130 degrees right at what I had set for Med. rare inside. This turned out perfect and will use again.

I've made this twice now. I do have a baking stone in my oven, therefore, I believe this might be why it has turned out just a tad overdone each time. It is still delish, as it is prime rib, but I have found that I  wish I had taken it out about 3omin earlier each time. 1st time I figured I errored, so I adhered to the "don't open the oven door for 2hrs" rule again this time--SO, use a temperature probe while doing this so you can monitor the inner temp, but otherwise this is SO easy and basically fool proof to get a lovely prime rib.

I have never made prime rib and I was a little intimidated to say the least! However after researching many recipes I chose Chef Johns and I chose very wise I followed almost to exact with exception of tip from another reviewer who suggested to check oven temp hour in by setting oven to 325 and see if my oven would start heating. It did so their suggestion was to keep it at 325 for half hour Then turn oven off again for last half hour. I ended up with a moist delicious roast that was a bit more medium on the ends and med rare in middle which honestly was ideal for everyone I was serving! -some people didn't want completely pink and I was able to accommodate everyone!  The rave reviews did not stop! I am sooo glad I went w this and will never deviate as it was perfect!!

Loved this recipe for both ease of preparation and for the final outcome! I'd used a similar recipe previously but I failed to bring the roast to room temperature and, after the requisite cook and rest time, the roast was still raw! This time, I watched Chef John's video so got the message to bring the roast to room temperature.  Of course, by the time I figured out the importance to that, it was about 4 hours from our slated dinner time!  So we put the roast in a tub of water and within 90 minutes, the internal temperature was 65 degrees on a meat thermometer.  I pretty much followed the rest of the instructions -- didn't have the exact spices so fudged a bit by using thyme and oregano and sage.  Didn't have the lavender so am curious how that would have changed the flavor.  Used sea salt in lieu of kosher because that's what I had on hand. The best part was while the roast was resting , for the first time ever, I was able to join my family on a beautiful New Year's Day hike!  I loved not being stuck at home tending the oven!  You can be assured we will make this again.  Oh, as one reviewer mentioned, be aware that the smoke detector will go off!  We got new appliances 6 months ago and I was confident my oven was so clean, I wouldn't run into that problem but sure enough our smoke detector was tripped! My husband disabled the alarm for the 30 minute high heat period and all went fine!

I made this exactly as described with the exception of doubling the butter mixture that goes on top. For those of you that are wondering how it turns out with a larger piece of meat I used a 12 lb roast and it turned out perfect. I must admit shutting the oven off on a $130 prime rib before Christmas dinner was a little daunting but I had my trusty Brookstone thermometer stuck in it. I shut it off  after searing at 500 and watched the temp continue to ramp up to 145. It was perfect and got rave reviews. This was the first prime rib I ever cooked. Good luck ! One extra note on the salt. You need twice as much as you think like the video says, and I used salted butter.

Perfect!!! My guys like it a little toward the medium rare to medium side. Followed directions and at end of 2 hours turn the oven back on to 350 for 15 minutes. Perfect !!!

I followed the recipe EXACTLY as suggested. I just took the rib out of the oven, to have it register 111 degrees. Not exactly "Perfectly medium rare". Now it's back in the oven at 350, where it will come out nice and tough, after I cook it to a decent serving temperature. A $75 piece of meat, RUINED because of this recipe. Happy New Year.

Five stars for the method!
I used my regular seasoning for a ten pounder.
Rubbed with evoo (can take high heat better than butter) then 4 teaspoons kosher salt, 2 teaspoons each fresh ground black pepper and garlic powder (yes powder, just use a good brand). 
Viola!
And you can throw your baker spuds in at the same time and temp.

This is the second time I have made this rib roast. The first time it was perfect. Last night is was very good but I got worried because I have a new oven. I followed a reviewers suggestion and checked the temp after 30 minutes. It seemed to have cooled down too much so I turned the oven back on at 275 for a little while. I should NOT have done that. The roast was very good but closer to medium verses medium rare. So it was my own fault and next time will stick to the original recipe!!

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I had a 10 lb prime rib and was serving it for a dinner party.  The meat was tender and juicy.  I never opened my oven for two hours after I turned the heat off and just let it continue to cook.  Great recipe.

yes, I like all the rest had reservations ( no really, I made reservations...just in case it didn't work out!) but it was the most amazing roast I ever did. This has truly become a showpiece - everyone is amazed at the flavor and the perfect pink center. I actually lock the oven to prevent anyone from peeking in! served it with creamed spinach and amazing mashed potatoes....it even impressed my new sister in law.

My guys don't like meat as rare as in the video so I cooked it for 6 minutes per pound.  Came out perfect!  Thanks to the commenter who shared the tip on testing your oven to make sure it holds the heat. It saved the meal.

Best prime rib ever. There's no other way I'd cook it now. Hard to resist opening the oven, so like a few others I used a bungie cord for a reminder not to. Perfect!!!!!!!

Best ever and I didn't have to go out to dinner!  Tonight (New  Year's Eve 2016) will be the second time I have made this roast. I HAVE NEVER cooked a prime rib in my life for fear of ruining such an expensive cut of meat.  But not only is this fabulously delicious, IT'S EASY!   If you like prime rib, this is an absolute must.  Thank you Chef John!

This recipe is easy and delicious! Follow it exactly and it will turn out perfect! Please follow recipe and allow meat to come to room temperature! It will take 4 hours or more depending on the weight if your rib roast.  I read all the reviews and learned that from them all! This is the perfect recipe to impress anyone!

Thank you so much! My family agreed, the best prime rib we ever had! I wish I would've let it get to room temperature, but I can't imagine it coming out even better than it did. I've made a few of your recipes, turkey for example, and they are always incredible! Thank you!

although I followed the recipe  and had my meat out for 6 hours prior to cooking, the prime rib was still a bit undercooked. Not sure if I will adjust the 5 to 6 min per pound on the high temp, turn on the oven to 200 degrees after the high temp or if I will try a different method  altogether.

My prime rib was a little rare for some, but perfect for my taste. I would fault my oven for not maintaining the temperature once turned off.
 I have used this recipe for smaller roasts with great success!

This was the best prime rib I've ever had! Mine was just a small one so I only had to do it for 12 minutes. I did a salt and garlic rub and it was delicious. I too was getting very impatient waiting for the 2 hours to end,but omg,it was worth the wait!

Outstanding. I did add minced garlic to the herbed de province, but otherwise made as directed. Came out medium rare on the side of rare. Probably due to the age of the oven and whether the 500 degrees was really 500 degrees. Plan to do all future rib roasts this way.

I made a 7# rib roast and I have one of those ovens that when you shut it off it automatically blows out the heat so I was concerned the oven would cool off too fast.  So what I did was cook the roast the prescribed 35mins, turned the oven down to 200F for an hour and then shut it completely off the last hour and let it blow to its hearts content.  I also placed a baking stone ion the bottom rack in the oven and let it preheat and hold the 500F for 30mins before I placed the roast in the oven.  This ensures the stone is completely heated and it helps keep the oven hot and heated more evenly. The roast came out perfectly cooked.  I added another step to the preparation: because I had the room in my fridge I salted the roast and let it dry in the fridge for about 36hrs before I set it out to come to room temp and buttered it with CJs herb butter.  Scrumptious.  Also did his AuJus recipe.  Perfection!

So easy! Everyone loved it. Trust the method...it really works. We had an 8 lb boneless roast, so we used a roasting pan with a rack. The meat seared beautifully at 500 F. Will make this again.

I prepared a double amount of this recipe for a 20# prime (choice) rib roast. The flavor was really good.  NEXT TIME I will probably put the rub on it 4-6 hours early in the fridge, instead of waiting for the 2-hr period to bring it to room tem.  Didn't seem like the flavor went very far in, even with the slices I made on the roast.  I followed several other recipes for baking time (450* to start & down to 325* for 5 hrs) &  I wasn't as pleased with the slow cook - meat was grainy.  So I will carefully follow the 500* start next time.

This prime rib turned out beautiful, and tasted wonderful.  I was worried about the cooking method,  but literally 2 hours after turning off the oven, the roast was exactly at the desired temperature.   We put a probe into the meat while cooking as a precaution, but next time we won't now that we know the formula is  full proof.  Take a chance on this,  you won't he disappointed!!

The only change I made was I made an herb butter with fresh rosemany, thyme, garlic and cracked black pepper and covered the roast with it the day before. I added the salt before putting it in the oven. That however doesn't change the fact that this cooking method is stellar and fool proof as long as you follow the recipe and formula. It was fantastic and my guests just couldn't get over how perfect it came out and neither could I!

my daughter made this for Christmas with a 7 lb prime rib and it turned out perfectly. Could not have been a better done roast. I would have put it against any cut that I had from a top restaurant.

Great recipe! Easy to  make and it was delicious. I was a bit skeptical about leaving a roast out for 5-6 hours before cooking and was nervous about how it would turn out, but it cooked perfectly and everyone loved it as part of our Christmas dinner.

It was my first time making it, and it turned out just like what I would expect at a restaurant! It was so perfect and everyone was impressed with how juicy and tasty it was. The only thing I will do differently next time is to lower the middle rack so that the prime rib would be at the middle of the oven. My prime rib was quite tall so the top portion was more done than the bottom. This may be quite obvious for the experienced cook, but as a novice I realized it afterward. Big thanks to Chef John for our wonderful holiday dinner!

Turned out perfectly!  I would certainly do this recipe again.  My standing rib roast was 11.33 lbs, so exactly 57 minutes was slated, along with the two hour wait time.  I did have to switch my oven’s fuse box switch to off, as I have one of those ovens which has a fan inside to continue to cool the oven off, which won’t work for this recipe.   Thank you to the person who mentioned this in the comment section, prior to me making the recipe.   I also brined my rib roast in a strong coffee/onion and salt solution for 8 hours, rinsing quite well after brining.  It was both tasty and easy.

Be WARNED!  I made this roast on Christmas and while it turned out perfect, it also broke my oven!  I have a single built in Maytag, less than 5 years old.  I followed the recipe to a "t" and left the roast in the oven for 2 hours.  It was cooked to a perfect rare-medium rare.  However, when I went to turn my oven on, it would not operate.  According to my repairman, even in the OFF position, an oven will continue to increase in temp for awhile.  Some models cannot tolerate temps in excess of 500 (apparently mine is one of those models) and it caused a thermal fuse to blow.   
Please know that the recipe itself is very good and my family LOVED the roast!  But the method may not be right for everyone or every oven.  

Lesson learned- this was the most delicious and expensive roast I've ever had!

I think the cooking method was a really good one. I had a 10.55 pound standing rib roast. I wanted ours to be a bit more well done than Chef John's in his video. I added 5 minutes to the calculated 57 minutes for my sized roast. After the 62 minutes at 500 degrees and 2 hours sitting in unopened oven, the internal temp was still less than I wanted.  I just turned the oven on at  300 degrees and cooked the roast cook another 35 minutes until the internal temp got to 135 degrees. Removed it and let it sit for a bit. When I cut into it, it was just right. Also,  any seasoning  that makes you happy along with a good amount of salt will work just fine in the butter coating.

Followed it exactly as instructed and turned out perfect. Cooked about a 4.8lb rib roast, was very impressed and so was the company. Very nice to now have a fool proof recipe to follow for cooking such an expensive cut and don't have to worry.  Even made his Au Jus recipe with the drippings and it was superb. A+

I made this using a 16 pound boneless prime rib roast. I followed the directions to a tee! My roast came out overcooked. more medium to well done. I was so upset. There went 170.00 of meat!! my entire family with the exception of my husband likes their meet medium rare. hubby likes it done so he was the only happy one at my table.

After all the thousands of great reviews, I was disappointed.  I used a meat thermometer on the exterior of the oven, the oven was never opened and it was overcooked!  I sure didn't expect that!    I used an 11 lb prime rib roast and it was still overcooked.  Bummer, because I was counting on this being great for our Christmas dinner.

I rated this 5 stars because the crust and flavoring was delicious! I had to disable my smoke detectors because it does smoke in the oven. Because I'm pregnant and can't have rare meat I had to cook on 325 for 2 hours.

My rib roast weighed almost 7 lbf which calculates to 35 min active cook time.   However, I used a convection oven so I reduced cooking time to 30 min.   That was an error as the  roast turned out to be too rare in the center.   No problem as the roast was much larger than needed to serve 5 people.   I cut the medium rare meat off each side and served it.  The next day the rare center was grilled briefly to medium rare.   Excellent meat both meals.   There was still some remaining which was sliced thin and used to make  fajitas (which were outstanding) the next day.

Followed instructions for a much larger roast and it did not work.  Don't know if using gas instead of electric oven made a difference, but when we were ready to cut it, it was stone cold.

I really hate when people review recipes but they end up making major changes where  it doesn't even resemble the original recipe. That being said, I used the ingredients as written (but doubled, for an 8 lb. prime rib) and had planned to use this cooking method, but I chickened out when I started to run out of time. So, my 5 star rating is for the spices not for the cooking method. I loved the flavor! I served it with Chef John's horseradish sauce, which was excellent!

As an FYI, I set my roast out for 2 1/2 hours, preheated  the oven to 500 degrees but when the roast had been in for 20 minutes the house was starting to get really smoky so I turned the heat to 450 for the next 25 minutes. When the timer went off, I turned the temp down to 300 for 2 hours then let it sit for an hour while I finished all my other cooking. It was a little more done than I wanted (closer to medium) so I plan to try again with a 4 lb roast and will do it exactly as written.

I used this recipe for Christmas Dinner and, although I was somewhat uncertain because it seemed so strange, this was THE BEST prime rib ever! Better than any restaurant. I would do it every day if I could get prime rib at a reasonable price. Thanks for recipe!

This method has worked wonderfully.  I have used it with other cuts of beef roast and also for venison, elk amd moose roasts and tenderloins.  It has become my go to method as a way ro cook a roasr when camping.  I use a cast iron dutch oven and set it in the coals for the specified "high temperature" cook time and then just set it off to the side to finish.  For the prime rib roast, as soon as I pull the roast foam the oven,  I  brush a mixture of 2 tsp.finely chopped rosemary and garlic mixed with 6 tbsp. butter then tented roast with foil to rest.

as good a cook as i am, i'm not too proud to use an "idiot-proof" recipe and this one is as close to that as i've ever prepared. no turning the oven up and/or down and constantly monitoring the temp, heat the oven up, put the meat in, turn the oven off and go do whatever for two hours. i didn't use the herbed butter rub, however, i was trying to avoid smoking up the house too much so i used lawry's seasoned salt (as is in the lawry's prime rib restaurant recipe) and it came out tender with good flavor. i plan on picking up a couple more roasts while the prices are still low and vacuum sealing them and throwing them in the deep freeze. i already know what i'm having for easter!

I had a 9 1/2 lb prime and had never cooked one before. I used another recipe to come with a formula of 5 min per lb for cooking time. Left the door closed with the oven off after initial roast. 3 hr later we warmed the roast at 375 degrees for 20 min. The roast was perfect. Rare to medium rare all the way through. Dipped each rib into warmed au jus just before plating on a warmed plate. Perfection!

If you follow this recipe like Chef John says you will have the best prime rib ever!  This recipe is so simple it's crazy.  I put tape on the oven door to prevent my wife from opening it, she was getting nervous.  Perfect pink prime rib, juicy, and tasty.  I will use this recipe again!
I have used this recipe twice--PERFECT every time!!!

Used a bone in 4 lb roast. I did leave it cook for 5 extra minutes at 500 (25 min total) as we like our meat a little more well done. It turned out perfect, delicious! Made the au jus as well. great meal!

The center piece of our Christmas Dinner 2016 was my husband's favorite - prime rib. I'd only ever tried making it once before a few years ago.  Since I couldn't remember that recipe, I stumbled on this one.  Did Chef John say turn off the oven after 20 min?  Even after double checking that AND watching the video, I was not convinced I'd read/heard it right.  The reviews were very helpful.  I appreciated the tip about the fans cooling the oven too quickly after turning it off.  I had my husband trip the breaker as suggested.  My roast was just over 8lbs so it was 33min based on the calculation.  However, I'd not taken the roast out until 10am so by 2 it was still cold in the center.  By 4pm I didn't dare wait any longer and the center was still only 50degrees.  I gave it an extra 10 min at 500 just for safe measure.  The roast was perfect!  I'm a believer.  My husband's feedback - It was the best he's ever tasted (and he's had a LOT of prime rib!)   Not sure how often we'll be enjoying prime rib, but when we do, this will be the recipe we come back to time and time again.

I have made this prime rib roast several times now following the recipe exactly except I left the roast in the oven longer because my husband like his roast medium-medium well. This recipe is so perfect that I can time when I serve dinner and have a wonderful, perfectly done roast!  It's always a hit.  I have used the 4 lb roast and an 8 lb roast.  All were wonderful.

The prime rib came out perfect, pink inside, just the way we like it. My only problem was that the drippings burned in the bottom of the pan and I was not able to make the sauce. But the meat was so juicy that we really didn't miss it! Thank you Chef John!

This was PERFECT!!! After years of having over cooked roasts we were desperate to have a perfect medium rare prime rib. FINALLY!!!!
Exchange dealings for whatever you prefer. I think the butter and the cooking time are what is most important!

This recipe is spectacular!  My 1st time making "my favorite meal" was nothing short of "perfect".  The only thing I changed was the seasonings.  All I used to mix into the butter was about 2 tablespoons of minced garlic, a wee bit of parsley and freshly ground  black pepper.  Everything else was exact to the recipe.
It was everything I'd hoped it would be.

I followed the directions exactly, but I only had ground black pepper. We loved it, very tender, nice and pink the way we like it. So glad the directions told you how to figure time for smaller roasts, that's was a big plus, so is the fact I can put in the amount of servings on all the recipes. First time I have used herbes de Provence, now I will look for other recipes that use it. I will be making it again.

I don't think my oven retained the heat as well as it should have. At the end of the 2 hour rest, the roast was under-done and only 115 degrees. We turned the oven back on and let it cook for an additional 1/2 hour at 400, until my digital thermometer read 160.  Still came out great. Very tender, very tastey.

Followed the recipe exactly--we have a good newer oven, and I was skeptical despite that- have mercy was this good. I served it for Christmas dinner (with the au jus) and it was a huge success. Oh, and I let the meat rest at room temperature for almost 6 hours before putting it in the oven.

Didn't quite hit the rare temp even though I allowed the meat to reach room temp (checked) and followed directions exactly.   Salvaged at the end but had to hustle as I timed everything according to the projected end-time of the roast.  For me, I'll stick to the long and slow roasting method in the future.  I'm sure it's just that my oven didn't seal tight enough to retain the correct temperature but that's a tough variable to control.  Cheers to the great idea and salvaged it was still great!

I couldn't believe how perfectly done the roast was. My only issue was it isn't very hot when it comes out of the oven, but at least it doesn't have to gather. The calculation for a different weight roast was spot on. (My 4.29 lb roast had to cook exactly 21 minutes at 500 F.)

This was incredible!  Evenly medium rare throughout! The only issue I had was that the thermometer didn't reach more than 126 so I turned the oven on again to 350 (the temp I needed to cook my rolls) and left the roast in.   I think the problem was with my oven so will try to make an adjustment next time.  Cut the roast when the temp reached 130 and it was perfect!

Outstanding!!! I've actually never eaten prime rib before nor have I attempted to cook it. Yet in the past 2 days I've eaten it twice, by coincidence, prime rib was served at our family's Christmas dinner and was tough, over-cooked & dry. The very next day I used this method to cook prime rib for my family (not knowing we were having it the night before) & it came out beautifully!! Perfectly cooked medium rare, tender, juicy, flavorful prime rib. My family; kids included (age 5 & 4) devoured it and asked for thirds. I served this with the beef au jus recipe by Chef John along with a side of mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Thank you!!

My husband really wanted to try cooking the prime rib this way  but I was a wreck! I mean, who wants to risk ruining a 9 pound prime rib, but he was determined to give it a shot. I only had it out for 2 hours to come to room temperature, but Christmas in Orlando is pretty warm (85 degrees) so I figured that the 68 degrees it had reached was probably room temperature everywhere else. The only adjustment I made was to cook it at 500 an extra 5 minutes because of the room temperature issue. And yes, it turned out perfectly! This will be our go-to recipe from now on!!!

My wife and I made this  today for Christmas and it was awesome. We followed the directions to a T and we could not be more happy. This will be our go to In the future.
Good advice from other reviewers we used  was:
Make sure the oven is clean 
Cut power to oven so the fan doesn't run and cool oven. Thank you

Easy no pain recipe.  Works every time.  I have found the 'key' step to ensure success is to MAKE SURE to bring the Prime Rib to ROOM TEMPERATURE BEFORE placing in oven.  Doing so requires about 3 hours sitting out of refrigerator.  Great and easy and always gets compliments.

I was skeptical but followed the cooking instructions perfectly.  While I used the 1/2 cup of butter I used my own spices.  Make sure prime rib is at room temp AND butter mixture is room temp before smeering on meat.  Tip: Once you turn the oven off, keep curiosity seekers out of the kitchen and DON'T PEEK!!!  That is the key to this recipe turning out perfect!!!  I've bookmarked and will never cook a prime rib any other way!!!

I lost some sleep over cooking a prime rib - my first one - for Christmas dinner... But the recipe worked like a charm, and I followed it to the letter: 6 hours to come to room temp, 5x9.6 lbs for 48 minutes at 500 degrees, taped the oven door shut for two hours (because I'm me), and flipped the breaker on my oven to shut off the auto fan. It came out perfectly, and I can sleep easily again.  Until New Year's Eve dinner.... Awesome recipe!!

I loved the idea of this method because reliable rare prime rib has been my Achilles Heel (well, one of them) for a long time.  I'm rating this recipe pretty low so people will see the comment.  I made a full 7 rib roast weighing 16 pounds.  My problem is with the conversion of cooking time for higher weights.  It simply multiplies the weight by 5 so I ended up cooking at 500 degrees for 80 minutes.  The result was all medium to medium-well.  I think the problem is that a 2 rib,  4 pound roast (in the recipe) is exactly the same circumference as my 16 pounder and quadrupling the cooking time cooks much deeper into the meat.  I don't know how others got medium rare on big roasts.  The butter-based rub was fantastic and I still think the method will work (hundreds of people do), but I am going to try modifying the formula to add less time as I go up in weight.

I had a 5.5 lb Rib Roast, and kept it at 500º for 28 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfect.

Have to say that I've never made a rib roast. Due to the amount of great reviews this got, I went with this method. I had a 9.6 lb ribeye bone in roast. Followed th recipe to a "T".  48 mins on 500 degrees then let sit in the oven for 2 hours. Unfortunately, it came out medium well. Everyone raved how great it was, and I thought it was good too but would have preferred medium rare. I will try it again but maybe with 3 mins per pound instead of 5.

This was prefect. Used this recipe for a 5 lb. bone-in rib roast and I got exactly a rare/medium-rare.
I didn't have the herbs on hand but only used salt, pepper, and rosemary and it was still amazing.
I have a gas oven with a vent on top, so I covered the vent with foil prior to cooking and usedo the broiler pan that came with the oven instead of a roasting rack. 

This did give off a good bit of smoke, but what could you expect with butter at 500 degrees? 

WI'll use again for the 8 lb. roast in the freezer.

Very easy!   I made a 15 # rolled rib and cooked at 500 for 75 min.   Sat for 2 hrs as instructed in turned off oven.  I used garlic cloves in the meat and used a lot of Kosher salt.   The justices left were awesome.  Put on a small rack to get all sides cooked.   Next time I might cook it 5 minutes less at 500, but otherwise came out as described.

I never knew prime rib could be so easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as it called for. So yummy ??. The husband said I could make this anytime. Making sure the meat was room temp was key. My electric double oven has a vent fan so I turned off the breaker. It worked perfectly.

Made it last year.  I changed nothing.  I used a five pound roast.  This year I'll do the same but add more time to the roasting time... maybe 6-7 minutes per pound.  It was on the rare side last time.  Otherwise super good!  I made au jus and 'French dip' sandos with left overs.  Amazing!

I have never made a prime rib before and I was incredibly nervous leaving it sitting in the oven for 2 hours, but it came out PERFECT! My husband said he would wait 2 hours any day for prime rib like that. It was cooked perfectly and even though I don't like anything cooked less than medium, I loved every bite! Even though it set off my smoke alarms for the time the oven was on, this recipe will stay on my list for sure!

The meat was flavorful, and juicy. I believe that the side dishes and the good company added to the enjoyment of the meal. I don't think this meal could have been any better.

We tried this time/weight calculation recipe and were delighted.  It was no-hassle. no meat thermometers and no running back and forth from the oven when company is over.  The roast was perfect and already rested right out of the oven.  This decreased the kitchen to serving  time so everything on the table  was hot at the same time.     Two thumbs up!      Cindy K.

Well.  There it sat.  THE most expensive chunk of beef we had ever bought and I'm thinking, "Holy Cow, what came over me to buy this and think I could cook it ?!?  Oh Lord, puhleeze don't let me mess this up!"  Chef John made it so simple.  I followed the cooking directions exactly and the meat was perfect.  

The only variations were I did not use Herbes de Provence, solely butter, salt, pepper, and chopped garlic.  Second, I pre-cut the meat from the ribs about 80% around the curve, leaving the rest attached.  I then roast with the bones down and the meat up.  Disabling the smoke detector is a must.  HA!

We have made this four times and it has come out perfectly cooked each time.

Absolutely fool proof! I'm a Baker, not a Cook ( there is a difference ) and I followed the recipe exactly as it's written. I was a little scared at the 500 degree temperature, but it came out perfect! My family starts drooling at the mere thought of Christmas Prime Rib.

I followed the directions to a T but my roast came out a bit under cooked.   It tasted good nonetheless.   I will do this again but will cook it a bit longer and/or use a meat thermometer.

We made this for Christmas Eve last year and it was amazing. We are doing it again this year because everyone devoured it!

I've made this 3 times now.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using a disposable aluminum pan instead of my regular roaster (easier clean up and less chance of scorching) and I put a small amount of water in the bottom of the pan.
This produces an amazing prime rib-juciy, succulent and so flavorful....this easily holds its own against any prime rib dinner from a restaurant!!
Thanks Chef John:)

Was skeptical.  Made a 9 lb. roast and followed directions to a tee.  Perfect.  Was the best prime rib I ever made.

For Thanksgiving we don't do turkey, usually we do a roast but this year we opted for Prime Rib. With a dozen guests coming, we invested in 15lb of CHOICE cut. I've never made a prime rib before.  Needless to say I was incredibly nervous; if the meat didn't turn out what was I going to feed my guests?  I followed the formula to the letter and the meat turned out perfectly!  Seriously, the raves are still coming in. 24 thumbs up here!!!!

Made this for the first time on Sunday and it will not be the last time!  My worry was about my new gas stove:  it has a cool down fan that comes on as soon as you turn the oven off.  I read loads of reviews from people who said their meat was bloody and raw instead of medium rare but they had older stoves that maybe didn't hit the correct temperature to begin or didn't have proper insulation or seal.  No where did I read any reviews from anyone with a new gas stove.  I took a chance and followed the instructions to the letter.  It turned out absolutely beautiful.  I served it on a bed of roasted garlic mashed potato with a glass of red wine; PERFECTION :)

I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  So easy! I served it with a dijon horseradish sauce.  Chef John have you ever converted this cooking method to a beef tenderloin?  I know that a tenderloin would not have the fat layer to protect it, so I would assume a shorter sit time in the oven.  Any thoughts???

Did a 12 pound version and it was PERFECT, using the same cooking formula.  I will say, I did set the oven at its lowest setting, 170, after roasting at 500 for 60 minutes, just to keep the oven from cooling down too far.

I made my first prime rib roast for Thanksgiving, hurrah!!  I was a bit worried because I have an old stove/oven that does not have a window, however, I know my oven well.  At high temps, it gets 25F hotter than the dial setting.  I set it at 475 and  I knew it'd reach 500F.  I did not take my 4 lb roast out soon enough to reach room temp so I put it on the stovetop and set the oven to 300F to warm up the roast faster.  Once I put the roast in, I could hear it sizzling!  Exciting!  I put a big note on the door:  DON'T OPEN!!  After two hours the roast was perfectly medium rare, I was so impressed.  I give this recipe 5 stars for the cooking method but I docked one star because I think the flavor can be improved with some minced garlic, which I added to the butter.  I did not have any trouble with smoking as some reviewers stated.

I followed the instructions exactly but did insert a meat thermometer, just in case.  I have a oven that can either be used convention or convection.  I used the normal convention oven since this is how the recipe is written.  Unfortunately, my oven must be insulated better because the prime rib (7lbs) roast reached an internal temperature of 135 degrees around 45 minutes.  The prime tasted delicious but was slightly less pick than we usually like it.  It was also a bit chewy because it was not able to use the full two hours to sit in the oven.  Will try this recipe again but will have to adjust the temperature next time, 500 degrees was just too high for my oven.

We did this for Turkey day on our Grill!  I have a Charbroil Infra red (no direct heat) Grill.  I cranked it up to full power and get's to 500' easy.  I know my knob positions to get to this temp.  Put two seperate 5lb roasts coated exactly as the recipe called for in a 9" pan with a foil bottom (to hold the drippings) and not make a mess of the pan.  I would say the only thing I did differently was to cut the prime meat fat side up in small squares (striking the knife in square patterns) This let's the butter melt into the fat with the seasonings.  then i turned it down to one burner on low for the slow cooking part (being that it's outside and the temps in the 50's, I did not want to turn the grill to "off".) And it cooked perfectly.

It came out perfectly! Followed the directions to a T, with a 6 pound roast we did at 500 degrees for 30 minutes, then left it in the oven for 2 hours. Awesome!! Also made the au jus by Chef John - used half of it for au jus and then turned the other half into gravy for our mashed potatoes. Everybody said how good it was... juicy and tender, and not overdone.

This was PERFECT!!!  I had a 5.5 lb roast, but increased my butter and mixed in 2 TABLESPOONS of Herbes de Province.  I couldn't believe how good the perfect crusty outside was, and the meat was a perfect medium rare inside and tender and juicy. I simply used the pan drippings, skimming off most of the fat, to drizzle on the meat and a simple horseraddish sauce.  I loved the idea of only using my electric oven for 30 minutes!!   PLEASE, do you have a similar recipe for cooking a 12 lb bone-in turkey breast???

I used dried rosemary, thyme, sage, paprika,garlic powder, black pepper, and onion powder. I fully covered a 5.60 lb tied prime rib roast with these herbs and spices creamed into the softened butter. I avoided the kosher salt casing, however, due to diet restrictions. 

Following the instructions, my 500 degree preheated oven was ready for the roast on the rack in the roasting pan. Ten minutes into cooking every smoke alarm in the house went off!  And, they continued to scream until finally my husband yanked all of the batteries. OMG! Annoying!

Given we do not like rare or medium rare meat, I added a few minutes to my cooking time. At the end of 38 minutes I turned off the oven.

Two hours later I could not believe the bloody mess of a roast I had on my hands, it was seriously under cooked,. So much so we could nearly hear it mooing. Ugh.

I sliced our portions, turned the oven on to 425, barely let it preheated, stuck the slices in a shallow baking pan, covered it with foil, Baked for 10 minutes, reduced to 300 for another 15 minutes.

I was very surprised that the slices were not tough! They were so tender and delicious, and the nice butter/herb  crusted skin was phenomenal. The flavor was out of this world and the texture of the meat was outstanding!

I would give this 5 stars but I think the temperature and timing of the recipe needs some tweaking.
All in all though we had a beautiful roast with our red and gold butter steamed potatoes with broccoli, carrots and green be

The cooking times are on point for medium rare which is perfect and in my opinion a sin to cook any other way... I don't deviate from this recipe at all and I normally don't with any recipe so I can give a fair assessment of what the producer of the recipe was trying to achieve.  I made this for my husband for our wedding anniversary and made me the queen of his castle for it.  Thanks a mil

Absolutely fool proof! Works amazingly well with tougher cuts too because it seals in the juice and cooks so slow the meat is always tender and perfectly pink. I've used this method at least a dozen times over the past few years and will never cook another roast any other way.

Even though a few reviewers commented about the smoke, I wasn't prepared for it to begin so soon into the baking time and continue for the entire time!  The meat turned out perfectly, but the smoke was too much.  Next time I will do the low temp, longer baking time method....

I started at 500 but ended up putting my oven on broil to get it fairly crispy. Then turned the oven off & took it out at around 125 degrees internal temp and let it sit 10 mins or so.
 I cooked it in a cast iron pot, but I'm wondering if a roasting pan would've worked better for browning. It wasn't crispy but it was sooooo delicious!! I made gravy out of the drippings which was really yummy! I will most definitely make this again!

I tried with a 2.82 lb prime rib . I round 14.1 (2.82 x5) to 15 minutes at preheated 500 degree oven and then shut off and waited 2 hours just as chef Jones indicated.  The meat looked exactly like the one in the picture and it is perfect!!  So this recipe worked as indicated for me.

I have never made a prime rib roast before, but when my local supermarket had a coupon for it I bought one. I decided to cook it for Father's Day for our company. I read several recipes and decided to follow this one. After conferring with my son who cooks prime rib frequently, he told me it was an excellent method. Well, when I tell you my guests raved about it. They said it was the best they have ever tasted. I served it with Chef John's creamed spinach, which I also gave 5 stars to, and Yorkshire Pudding. My entire meal was a success.

I bought a new oven, and as a new hand in the family kitchen, this one made me nervous. An $80.00 chunk of beautiful meat was the last thing I wanted to ruin. No worries. It came out absolutely fantastic! After three more wonderful meals, my only addition wasI a couple of small sprigs of Rosmary on top. Chef, you are my go to guy for everything I cook.

I have made this many times and it turns out perfect every time!  Moist and tender. Use you favorite seasonings or rub. It is extremely important to bring the roast to room temp before cooking and DO NOT open the oven AFTER YOU PUT THE MEAT IN!  I put a sticky note on the oven door.   It won't work otherwise. Pre bake your potatoes while the roast is coming to room temp. Don't try to do it in the same oven.  Make your salad and set your table while it is cooking.  Then you have time to spend with your company. ??

We have made this PR for Christmas for the past 5 years, and will be doing it again this year.  This is hands down the best prime rib recipe I've found.  You can't ruin it and it turns out fabulously every single time.  I love Chef John's recipes.  This is one of my favorites and we are picky!

My first time cooking prime rib.. I was so worried about ruining such a magnificent cut of beef! I found this recipe. I did change the seasonings, to taste. I used only garlic, pepper and salt. OMGOSH... It was perfect! I had a hard time not opening the oven for the two hours.. I thought I would die, it smelt so good! I did have to keep my stove fan on, as the oven smoked quite  a bit. I have recommended this recipe many times~ And, am currently cooking one as I type this!

The best way to make prime rib!!! The key is to bring up to room temp just trust the recipe. Also even though it's very tempting DO NOT open the oven. I turn the oven back on at 350 for about 15 minutes just before serving then let it rest. I also sprinkle a little kosher salt on each slice when carving. Our family is a bunch of salt lovers!

AMAZING! I was skeptical because I only had a 2.5lb (one bone) prime rib so I was expecting it to be closer to well done. NOPE! Perfect medium rare! I used this same recipe a few years ago with a larger roast to perfection as well. I got a username/password for this site simply so I could rate and review this recipe because it's truly perfect. Thank you! Bon Appetit!

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly with a little trepidation, even tracking down some Herb de Provence.  It's really an amazingly simple recipe but resulted in the best roast I've ever tasted.

Perfect!  I'm not afraid of cooking/wrecking such an amazing cut of meat anymore.  My kids won't eat any pink meat, so I took the advice in a review and left it in the oven at 325 for 2 hrs.  It was phenomenal - the best meal I've cooked all year. It cut easily, the ribs were yum, the crust was perfect.  No smoke, no bleeding, no drama.  I even opened the oven door a couple of times near the end to put in scalloped potatoes and other stuff. Because I did continue to cook it, I did let it rest for 15 minutes before cutting.  Chef John, thank you so much for sharing these great recipes with us. #FoodWishesCookingSchool

I made this per the cooking instructions. I didn't have herbs de Provence, so I improvised with garlic powder, onion powder, crushed Rosemary, thyme and oregano. This was AMAZING!!! I made Chef's Au Jus as well. Incredible!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!

I made a small prime rib, just under 3 lbs, and it came out perfectly. Since I like mine Medium and my husband likes his Med-Rare, I cooked it for 1 extra minute at 500 degrees, then 2 hrs with the oven shut off ... so easy and came out great. The spices are wonderful, just follow the recipe.

This is the easiest and best recipe I have ever used for a prime beef roast. Thirty minutes per pound seems to produce a nice medium rare roast, the way we like it in my house.  There might some variation depending on the insulation of your oven. The only real prep work was making the herbes de provence. I used a recipe I found on this site and I quite like it as well. Simple and tasty...all good!

Turned out good. I used olive oil instead of the butter but I did use the same spice mix. This is not a good method for a house with a closed range vent system.  This method made a mess of the oven and leaked a significant amount of smoke which caused a stir at my household.

Perfect!  Unfortunately I didn't have the herb mix so I used salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to cream in the butter. The timing was absolutely perfect and a definite hit with my family. I'll always use this for my prime rib!

This cooked perfectly and was the best prime rib I have ever made.  Because of the cost I am very hesitant to try recipes for prime rib and run the risk of wasting the meat and ruining it.  This recipe takes away that worry.  I would give it five stars if the seasoning had more zip, but that is a personal preference.  The cooking method is the key.

This is the first review I have ever given. I don't usually give my opinion about things like this. That being said,,,, I have made this several times now.  I have changed the spices twice and this is by far and away the best, the most fool proof and the easiest way to make prime rib I have ever seen. It is done to perfection and is "melt in your mouth" delish. 5 stars isn't enough. Thank you Chef John!!!

Hi Chef!   I cook on weekends as a hobby. I live in the great state of Texas.  It is not my first rodeo with prime rib and I feel as though I have not perfected it to my own expectation. I like your recipe but I had to tweet some things.  I used a dry rub in the butter along with some  miscellaneous spices to accent the meat and I put a light dusting of dry rub (because that is what we do here) on the roast itself and now I am waiting for the meat to get to room temperature.   I am going to cook this per your instruction however add about 20 minutes to the cooking time so it is not too rare.  I have a little over four ponds but I want it about medium with dark pink in the middle.  I will post a comment on the finished product. Thanks for sharing and hats off to all us wannabe chefs!

I used my own spice combo, but followed Chef John's technique to a "T".   Turned out perfectly!  As others have written, it does make the house a little smokey during the cooking phase.

I'm a work in progress with this cooking thing, and this dish was easy and I've gotten more compliments than any meal I've ever made. Very good... I didn't have all the herbs so just improvised with what I had and turned out great.

Cooking time for wanted temperature was perfect.  However roast was almost room temperature at end of waiting time.  I cut slices and submerged in simmering au jus for a short time to quickly raise the temperature.  Summerge for just a few seconds to keep ar MR doneness.  Leave longer to raise temp for dinner guests that prefer M, MW, W temps.  Cooked 9.5 lb roast and used olive oil instead of butter and seasoned with garlic, black pepper, and Tony's creole seasoning.  Yummy!

I've made this roast a couple of times, the first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly, the second time, I added more garlic because my family loves it's garlic.  Both times the results were the same, a perfectly cooked medium rare prime rib that was to die for.   I have also used this same method for cooking other roast such as a New York Strip Roast, Top Round and Bottom Round roast.  Again they all came out perfectly medium rare.  I will never cook a roast any other way!  In fact the last time I made it, I also cooked a New York Strip Roast at the same time.  My plan was to have the New York Strip more on the Medium Well side so I put it in the oven 15 minutes before the Prime Rib Roast, added the Rib Roast on the same rack and the results were 2 perfectly cooked roast.  Medium Well for the Strip and Medium Rare for the Prime Rib..

Basicly, I loved it. But after reading many of the other reviews, I must chime in on some details. 

I followed the recipe exactly - save the pepper (I cooked it for my niece's birthday and she doesn't like pepper!) in my sister's oven. Techie that I am, I did use an oven thermometer - the kind with the digital readout outside the oven - and the internal temperature topped out at 125 - just a tad more on the rare side than I and the other guests preferred.

There is at least one variable that I have seen mentioned in other ratings that probably caused this - my sister's oven wasn't actually maintaining 500 during the initial cook! 

I'll likely never do this again in my sister's oven. And when I first do it in my own, I'll follow the recipe exactly, but I'll also record the oven temp as well as the internal temp of the roast. I'm actually really curious how well MY oven maintains the stated temperature!

Made this for Christmas dinner with Chef John's Beef Au Jus.  First time I ever made Prime Rib.  I also was nervous about making it since prime rib is such an expensive piece of meat.  But WOW!  It was AWESOME!  Followed the directions exactly & I also had a 4 lb. roast.  Nobody at the dinner table talked, all they did was say MMMM throughout the entire dinner!  Another masterpiece from Chef John!  This is my new Christmas dinner recipe!

This is my first review andI will definately make this again. I made this for Christmas dinner.   I've never cooked meat without a thermometer before or left it out on the counter for 4 hours and this came out perfect.  I only added an extra 5 minutes to the actual cooking time because I wanted it just a little more done.  Most flavorful prime rib I've ever made.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Oh I did poke the meat so the seasonings would go through.  I also didn't use salt because I only had salted butter on hand.  I really don't think this is changing the recipe.  Thank you Chef John for a perfect way to cook meat.

What a great way to cook a Prime Rib! It is effortless! No constantly checking the internal temperature. Just pop it in the oven and forget it. Whatever you do, start with the roast at room temperature and don’t open the oven door! The last time I made this I used the herbs de Provence but my family thought the lavender was too strong. This time I simply used the unsalted butter and coarse garlic salt. It was outstanding!

I had never made prime rib before and did some digging to find a good recipe. Chef John's recipe stood out to me because of the ingredients and how easy it seemed. Let me just say that it was AMAZING!!!!! I now not only know how to make incredible prime rib but I also have a new tradition for the holidays. The meat turned out absolutely perfect. It was beautifully seared on the outside and was tender and pink on the inside. The only change I might try is adding mashed garlic clove to the rub because I just love garlic. I also made the Au Jus by deglazing the pan with red wine and beef stock. The red wine gave it an extra zing that everyone loved. I HIGHLY recommend anyone looking for a prime rib recipe to do this one!!

Thanks so much for posting this.  I've made prime rib for years, but never had a technique that actually was dependable.  I tried this one and the timing was perfect and the roast came out exactly how my family likes it.
I used olive oil, fresh rosemary and thyme minced, and fresh garlic and pepper as the rub, then coated it in rock salt.  I used this cooking method and after the 2 hours was up, I removed it from the oven, knocked off the rock salt and carved it up.  I was amazing.

This is how I have done our Christmas prime rib 2 years running and it has been perfect both times (without a smoky kitchen, too)!  I used a boneless prime rib this year and it worked out fine with the same instructions.  The au jus is as delicious and easy as advertised as well.

I'm new at this so I followed Chef John's instruction to the letter, perfect.  I cooked my roast for 23 minutes then let it sit in the oven for 2 hours.  It was medium rare and delicious.

I made this fro New Year's eve dinner and everyone loved it. A couple of notes though. I had a 10 lb roast and the formula did not work. I could tell half way through the 50 minutes at 500 degrees that it was going to burn. Turned it down to 400 for the last half  and then left the oven off for the next 2 hours. having a meat thermometer in the roast saved the roast because it was cooked in 1.5 hours. Wrapped it in foil and covered with two bath towels until the rest of the dinner was ready. It was slightly over done but the taste was fantastic. Everyone raved about it.

Based on the reviews about the smoke detectors going off I was motivated to clean my oven in the morning before attempting this recipe.  It needed to be done anyway.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I did insert a probe so I could monitor the internal temp.  It was a 10 pound roast I was preparing for our New Years Eve dinner and did not want to mess it up.  Everyone agreed it was the best Prime Rib I've prepared for our gathering and we do this kind of thing at least 4 times a year.  I plan on making it this way from now on!

This was excellent!  Made it for NY Eve and had an 8# boneless roast for 11 people.  It was perfectly med rare (even after accidentally opening the oven and taking the roast out of the oven for a few minutes.)   It did create a lot of smoke in the house because of the high heat :(

Definitely would make again.   I followed the cooking time and temperature directions to the letter -- my roast was 3 lbs, so 15 minutes at 500 degrees and then turned the oven off.   After one hour, my oven was at about 300 degrees and totally cool at the end of two hours.   I did us a premade rub (Stubbs) on the outside, but that was the only change I made   It was delicious and yes, somewhat rare in the center, medium rare as you looked at the outer slices.   But, that is the way we like our meat, so it was perfect

I'm rating this 5 stars because of the method. My family likes their beef medium so I took this method and made the perfect Medium Rib Roast. It melted in your mouth.
For a medium Roast, using 5 lb Roast, prepare the Roast as stated but cook for 30 minutes at 500. After 30 minutes reduce the heat to 250 for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes (absolutely no more than that), turn off the oven and let it set for another 2 hours. I pulled it out and the temperature was between 140-145. Perfect.

Chief John is a genius! My entire family loves this amazing prime rib which I would say is the best prime rib I've ever had! I've made it several times and it's come out perfectly except for the time I set the oven for convection... Don't use this setting! Instead of turkey for Christmas, this is our go to. It's simple and amazing!

Used this recipe and calculations for a small prime rib roast - just 2.7 lbs, and it worked perfectly.  It was so hard to leave the oven closed and not check on it, but I'm so glad we did!

I have tried this method several times with limited success. The 2 biggest variables that you need to be concerned about is #1) Getting the roast completely to room temperature. 
#2) The oven model & how quickly it cools.
The Herbs De Province creates a wonderful restauraunt quality flavor. Trust your meat thermometer if you use this method.

Made this for our New Years dinner. This was so easy and the rib turned out perfectly. The rub was simple and spot on. Enhancing the flavor of the rib verses  making it  it taste different.  This is my Go To perfect Prime Rib " Every Time"

Prime rib is my husband's absolute favorite food. We had tried many recipes before with no luck. We were skeptical at first, but after following this recipe to the tee, the end result was perfect . We will most definitely make this again! Thank you Chef John for this flawless recipe.

This is not fool proof, unless you incorporate an internal meal thermometer to remove when beef  done; and with this method, it would be hard to know when.  I used a Viking electric oven with a great cooking history. I followed the recipe exactly, to a .4 minute cook time, but at 2 hours, the 5.68Lb piece (cooked at 28.4min) at 500 degrees was medium; nothing close to medium rare.    I used an internal thermometer and watched the temp rise as close to 160 degrees near the end, but was determined to follow the recipe, as I thought I might have hit the bone with my probe.  My  mistake was to not pull the meat when I saw the internal temp go higher than anticipate.  The final product was very good, as a prime rib cut should be, but this 'fool proof' recipe did not prevent this fool from overcooking.

We had a pre-seasoned prime rib and this method for cooking still worked amazing, the perfect medium rare.  We used the au jus recipe too, great!  I was skeptical especially when my oven started smoking but all turned out well with a 7lb roast.

Amazing! It cooked a 3 rib 7.78 lb Prime Rib bone-in roast perfectly, 
Our oven is a newer electric that I previously checked temperature for accuracy, and it is accurate. I did the 38+1 minute at 500 Deg-F. I lathered up the roast in the herb butter. I turned off the oven and never opened the dI also used my iGrill2 to monitor the temp at the small and large ends of the roast. At exactly 2 hours after oven was turned off, the roast was at 140F. It was perfectly pink from edge to edge.

I like how simple this steps are. For a non-savvy cook like me who really rely on exact instruction for success this math method is ideal. Too bad my oven did not hold the temperature well, so after 2 hours sitting in the oven the meat thermometer only reads 120. So I fired up the oven to 375F for 45 minutes and my 5.35 lbs meat got up to 140. It was ideal for us. Make sure you also do the Au Jus as well. The two paired awesomely well. Now my wife said we no longer need to go to expensive steakhouse for fancy prime rib. Thank you for this recipe!

Chef John is the go to guy for every meal inspiration. This roast worked out beautifully for New Year's Day dinner. Had a six pound rib roast. Rubbed it down with butter that I'd mixed with dried thyme, oregano, basil, and lots of black pepper. Popped it in to a 500 degree oven for thirty , then turned the oven off and just left it for another two hours. Tested my trust not to peek but my goodness what a delicious roast it was. Had to be the best I've ever cooked - or tasted for that matter!

I looked at several and I mean several recipes before I decided on this one.    This was the first time I have made a Prime Rib and it was for Christmas dinner so I was a little nervous (albeit  the price too).  I worried for nothing  it was a huge hit.  Didn't change a thing about the recipe.   The simple math you use in the recipe for cooking time was a blessing as my roast was 10 lbs.  The next day I used the bones and meat left on the bones and made a prime rib soup.  Wow that was really good too!.  Thanks Chef John for a terrific fool proof method.

I chose to season my roast a bit differently so I am rating the cooking process and it was AMAZINGLY PERFECT!  So easy and so yummy!

Don't be scared do it!  Just make sure your roast is at room temp and that you time the up front cooking process exactly to your roast weight!  You won't be sorry!

This technique worked well with a single roast, but I want to make 2 roasts (about the same size) simultaneously (instead of one really large roast). What changes to the cooking time/temp should I make? Thanks!

Fabulous! Perfection! I heeded the advice of others who stressed that you must let the meat come up to room temperature before cooking and that's about it. My 7 lb. roast was Choice but the texture was just like Prime and was so flavorful and juicy. I've made prime rib over 25x and never had such flawless results.

I was skeptical to make prime rib again because it's always hit and miss for me. However this was amazing! Just as good if not better than my favorite restaurant's prime rib! My family loved it! Follow the recipe exactly as stated and watch the video. Thank you Chef John!!!

Once again, worked like a charm on our 6.73 pound boneless Prime beef rib roast. Don't worry about the newer oven and the fan like I saw in another review. Just make sure you start it at room temperature. It will come out perfect as written. Used my own spice blend. PERFECT

This is without a doubt THE best roast beef I've ever made!  The only extra ingredient I added was a teaspoon of dry English mustard powder.  I live in England and I receive Allrecipe emails every day and without a doubt this is the best recipe so far and I will most certainly make this recipe again.

I have used this recipe for prime rib for 5 years now. It turns out perfect every time. I insert slivers of garlic and bay leaves in the meat. I rub the roast with soy sauce and season the top fat with salt, pepper and garlic powder. 
If you see ratings that report raw or rare meat, it's because those people didn't follow the instruction of warming the roast to room temperature. I let my roast sit out overnight just to be sure. And no, the meat will not spoil overnight. Thanks Chef John and Bon Appetit!

I made this for Christmas. It was the best prime rib ever!  I seasoned the prime rib and added garlic to the rub.  It sat seasoned overnight and I followed the instructions exactly.  It was perfect!  Thank you for this

I cooked this prime rib exactly as described and it came out perfect. This has got to be the easiest way to make a prime rib and don't worry you won't mess it up. I also inserted garlic and used a different rub along with butter.

Absolutely THE best.  Thank you Chef John.

Perfectly even medium rare 3lb rib roast with nice outside "crust" !  I mean perfect.  Made sure roast was at room temperature and seasoned generously with pepper and Michael Chiarello fennel spice rub (which contains salt).  Lined a small roasting pan with foil, placed a small rack in the pan to allow circulation, and laid the smaller roast on it's side for exactly 15 minutes (with convection fan on) at 500F as instructed, then turned oven and fan off.  Did smoke some, but the drippings caught in the pan made a fantastic gravy.  

Also made a foil pouch of mixed root vegetables and put them in exactly as the roast and they were perfect too !  15 minutes prep, 15 minutes cooking (for the 3lb roast), and a 2 hour wait for one of the best roast beef meals I ever had.  Can't be beat.

I love Prime Rib but never make it, or at least rarely make it because of some hidden fear I'll screw up a huge chunk of meat.  Not so with this!  Easy and maybe best I've had!  Highly recommend!

AWESOME!  AWESOME!  AWESOME!  
I not one to post things either but  I had followed Chef John's perfect simple turkey recipe and it came out awesome so i gave this one a try!  I have cooked prime rib many different times and this was the best!
Gotta say I was very skeptical to do this with a 150.00 prime rib!  12.62 lbs.
But It came out perfect! 
I only let it sit out about 45 min before cooking and I did have to open the oven once  to put a piece of foil on top because it was getting too burnt on top.
I will cook this again for sure!

I did this exactly as instructed. Timing included. Mine was overcooked. 2.25 lb prime rib steak. Cooked in 500 degree oven for  11 minutes and then turned off the oven letting it sit for 2 hours. Overcooked! I have the correct oven for this recipe.

Absolutely no changes. I did not have fennel or savory but it still came out tasting great. Very moist and tender. Will definitely make again after I get the missing ingredients for the rub and see how much that changes the flavor.

My first time making a rib roast. Super simple, technique. I would have liked my roast to be bit a bit more cooked so next time I might keep it in the oven longer by about 15-20 mins. Everyone was impressed with the flavor/texture of the meat.

Easiest and BEST Prime Rib I've ever made, and pretty much foolproof for any weight of Prime Rib you buy.
- Be sure to bring roast to room temp (2-4 hours)
- I didn't use butter or oil, but rubbed a very healthy amount of Salt, Pepper, Seasoned Salt & Garlic Powder to the entire surface of the beef.
- Use his math...multiplied my roast weight by 5, rounded up to the next number and used that number  as minutes to cook it at 500 degrees. 
- Shut off the oven for 2 hours, and opened to wrap it in foil. 
-Still warm and perfectly pink after surviving a trip to my son's home across town.
'Restaurant quality' and 'Oh my gosh...' were the reviews on Christmas Eve. Thank you Chef John!!!

Best Prime Rib ever!  Just trust the cooking time, it works. I cut the rib off in one piece and made a Rosemary, red wine and garlic marinade.  I applied inside the rib and outside and then reattached the rib using string.  Juicey and cooked MR from end to end. Just be disclaimed and keep the oven shut. Don't peak...

FANTASTIC!!!  I have ruined many a prime rib in the past, this time, perfection!!  I had a 4# prime rib, only adjustment was I added 5 mins to the initial 20 mins - mainly because of my nervousness from past failures. I used a garlic, salt, pepper & thyme crust. I have deleted all other recipes and will never stray from this one. The 4 hrs of sitting out allowing the meat to get to room temp is definitely key!!  Can't wait to do my next one!!

Made it 2 times in four days. First time I've ever tried prime rib. 3 pound rib was perfect! Perfect taste, perfectly medium rare. Attempted a 6.5 pound rib roast with same method and it came out barely cook. SUGGESTION: don't use this method for a heavier roast.

Perfectly cooked for our taste by adding 1 minute per pound. Cooked a 4.3 lb roast for 25 minutes as directed. Waited  two hours to open oven.  New oven, so it doesn't need tweaking if you have a new oven.  Stil pretty rare @ 6 minutes per lb, but very delicious.  Used sea salt, cracked pepper & fresh garlic with creamed butter. Just like steakhouse prime rib flavor.  Salad, mashed potatoes,  & Roasted asparagus made for a perfect Christmas dinner. Much easier than a turkey dinner (which isn't too difficult either imho). Pkg au jus & fresh horseradish put it over the top good.

The roast turned out good. I did marinate it for 2 days. Unfortunately my oven took a beating and the smoke detectors went off when the room filled with smoke. This is a new range. The door is permanently stained from the smoke and the inside had to be cleaned. Not good!!! So I won't be cooking it this way again. No one else said they had this problem. Plus I had removed most of the fat.

This is my favorite way to make prime rib! It's perfect every time! However, for the people who tried this and it didn't work out for, your ovens are probably too new. In newer oven models, when you turn off the heat the fans will turn on which will cool your oven down too fast for this to work. The one star reviews are kinda indicating this to be true. If you have a newer oven you may have to shut off your breaker so the fan won't turn on, or find another method all together. For everyone else....this is amazing and 100% fool proof! The seasonings are perfect on this particular recipe as well.

ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!!! The only change we made in the recipe was to add 10 crushed garlic cloves to the rub. we are big garlic fans. YUMMY!!! The easiest rib roast we have ever cooked. No messing with the thermometer or guessing the time for dinner. Woo Hoo!

Technique worked very well! I used my own combo of fresh herbs but as others have noted that is really less important and a matter of taste. Thanks!

We have double wall ovens and the cooling fan turns on once the oven is turned off.  To keep the oven from cooling down too fast, I put it on "Keep Warm" mode for the two hours.  My 7 lb roast cooked at 500 for 35 minutes then kept warm for 2 hours came out perfect!

Read the reviews pro and con, but followed the basic instructions. Rubbed the roast with olive oil, then a generous amount of McCormicks Grill Mates Cowboy Rub and a little flour. Four pound roast so did exactly: 20 minutes, then 2 hours. The oven did not smoke. Due to some of the negative comments the last 15 minutes I turned the oven back on at 375, it heated the juices and roast nicely. Sliced immediately, perfectly cooked.  Will definitely be using this method again, and again. I try never to try something brand new for guests, but won't hesitate to use this for next company dinner.

Wish I could give this method 10 stars. Followed Chef Johns directions exactly and was rewarded with a perfectly cooked medium rare prime rib roast. I was concerned that my roast was only 3 lbs but with the formula of multiplying weight  by 5, no problem. Thank you for sharing this!

Best of all methods for making prime rib. Added time because mine was 5.25 lbs. Also wanted mine med so left it in 2 1/2 hrs. It was perfect!  The  other reviewer was right, very hard not to open the oven door!

Complete  and  total  hit!  I used a horseradish  sauce  with 15 minced gloves of garlic. First I generously  coated with coarse sea salt and cracked pepper then coated the top with the horseradish  garlic mixture. I roasted at 500 deg for 37 min as it was a 6.5 lb prime.  The house  smelled as if I   were using a smoker and the final result after the 2 hr cool down process was a bit past medium rare.  Three guests went back for seconds (there were only 4 people  in  attendance).  This  is  definitely  my  one and  only  method  for a wonderfully  juicy and tender roast.  Thanks Chef John!!

Christmas Dinner 2015 Results:
A bit skeptical of the cooking time, but what the heck, let's give it a go. Stuck in an 8.2 pounder all buttered up with pepper only. Had it at room temp. Got the oven going at 525 just to get everything good and toasty. Dropped it to 500 when I stuck it in. Roasted for 45 min. At exactly 2 hrs, turned it off. Brought it out and let it rest for 20 min. Sliced 'er up. PERFECTLY done! Gonna give this method a go for a normal roast. Couldn't be happier.

Ok so I read all the reviews and was eager to make this for Christmas dinner for 15. I was extremely nervous about the technique with the 18 lb roast, but it was easy and fantastic!  Rave reviews from all, even my finicky 9 year old ate some! I didn't make the au jus but it didn't need it.  I rubbed butter with garlic, pepper and kosher salt to prep it, let it come to room temperature for 6 hours and I added 5 min of cook time to nudge it to medium rare /medium in the center.  It was perfect and pink and juicy and tender. I will make it again, everything else can cook in crockpots! Thank you!

Everyone in my family loved it!  I started with a 9.45 lb, 4 rib roast.  The internal temperature was only 45 degrees after sitting on the counter for four hours, so I cooked it an extra 5 minutes at 500 degrees (total of about 55 minutes).  Since I have a newer oven with a cooling fan, I followed a suggestion from the earlier reviews and shut off the oven at the breaker and added a large "DO NOT OPEN" sign on the oven door.  It reached 125 degrees after 1.5 hours, and 145 degrees at 2 hours.  Since I was monitoring the temperature, I would have pulled it out if it had reached 145 degrees (my family's preferred doneness) before the 2 hours were up.

Once again Chef John to the rescue in our home. I made this roast exactly to the recipe except left it in 5 minutes longer per other reviews and it turned out a perfect medium.  We had this with Chef Johns twice baked potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. Family raved it the best they ever had. Simply yummy

The high initial heat burned the fat cap, leaving it black.  The two hours of slow roasting gave me one roast that was medium-well done after resting.  The second roast was no better than medium after resting.  Those of us that we're looking forward to medium-rare were out of luck.

I have used this technique for several years, with a huge prime rib of 7 pounds or so, at Christmas.  It has always turned out perfectly, just as the recipe says!  Until this year. I had a 7+ pound PRIME boneless prime rib, purchased at an almost embarrassing cost.  However, I am growing older and losing my hearing.  I did not hear the timer go off, so instead of 40 minutes at 500, it was in the oven for about 55 minutes.  I was sure I had ruined it, since my family all prefers it quite rare.  When I turned off the oven, I opened the door to let out some of the high heat, then left it for the two hours.  When I got it out and started carving it, it was... PERFECT!  This recipe is magic.  I don't know how else to explain it!  My family of 9 (including two small children) ate the entire roast.  No leftovers.  Good thing I have another one in the freezer!

When I read this recipe I had a concern that not all ovens will cool down ate the same rate.  I was right.  I cooked my 4 1/2 lb rib for 23 minutes and shut off the oven.  After two hours the roast was only up to 114 degrees.  I had to ad lib after that.

As for the rest of it, the spices were excellent.  Over all the meal was a success. But I would not use this method if you don't have a leave-in meat thermometer.

I don't cook, bake, saute or sous vide.  Made this yesterday for Christmas dinner and it was awesome.  Definitely recommend PRIME rib roast and not Choice.  It was kind of scary making this for the first time due to the cost of the roast, but definitely will make this again!  My roast was 10.7 lbs and I modified the cooking to 20 @ 460, 8 @ 400, and 20 min/lb @ 325.  Temp hit 125 with about 15 minutes left and I removed it from the oven and tented it for 30 minutes.  Wow!  Fork tender.

I  purchased a 4.1 lb prime rib roast. I prepared it as the recipe noted except only added about have of the black pepper called for . Roast was on the counter for 4 hours. Then covered with the pepper, butter and then salt. . Oven temp preheated at 500 degrees. Put it in the oven for 20 minutes, then turned off the oven and, without opening the door, took it out 2 hours later. Internal temp  of the roast was 160 degrees. Mush too high for our liking. Meat was not pink at all but it was tender!!

Followed the recipe to the word, even the calculation for a larger roast.  There were enough of the delicious pink and more well done cuts for everyone's  preference.   I also used the Herbes de Provence spread.  It was a perfectly seasoned star for our Christmas meal.   Chef John rules!   Next time, we'll  try the garlic seasoned version!

I used a different rub ("Char Crust, Roto Roast")after applying a light coat of olive oil. I then added the kosher salt and let the roast (5.7lb) sit for 4.5 hours. After watching the video I wasn't sure I left it out long enough so I ended up bumping the time up by two minutes and let it sit in the oven 2 hours 15 minutes. The roast was great, although more medium than medium rare (my fault), but it was devoured!  Will definitely make again!

First time cooking a rib roast and I wanted it to be medium pink all the way through. Followed Chef John's recipe with these changes. Used vegetable oil instead of butter. Used "Amazing Taste" peppercorn, garlic & herb prime rib seasoning (found at meat counter in Publix). I adjusted cooking time to 6.5 minutes per pound. I cooked a 4 lb. roast for 26 minutes. Roast came out perfect. Between medium rare and medium. I did cover with foil briefly while preparing sides. Also followed his Au Jus recipe. This meal was as good as any I have had in restaurants.

Yes, I let the 11 lbs. prime rib set on the kitchen counter for 1hour and 15 minutes at room temperature instead of the 4 hours.  Then followed the John's directions to the minute.  Rib on the sides were medium rare and the rest was rare, exactly like the the majority of guests like their prime rib.  Everyone claimed that the prime rid was cooked to perfection.

I made this prime rib for my son's Christmas Day birthday party and everyone raved that it was the best prime rib they had ever tasted.   One of our friends said that she would never order prime rib at a restaurant again and asked that I email his recipe to her so that she could start making it for her dinner parties.  The only additions I made were to finely mince 10 cloves of garlic to add to the butter mixture, and to put my prime rib on a rack and add beef broth to the pan.  I still had to open the windows to prevent the smoke alarm going off, but all my efforts were well worth the time.  Thanks Chef John, I couldn't have done it without you!

It was very good, followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. It does cause a lot of smoke during the first part of the process, but it is well worth it.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it turned out perfect! Yummy, tender and perfectly cooked. I will use this recipe the rest of my life! My rib roast was 8 pounds so I used the formula (# x 5= 40) and because I wanted it medium I did a extra 5 minutes at the 500 degrees and then the oven was turned off and not touched for two hours. The house smelled delish the whole time. I pulled it out and let it rest about 15 minutes and it was amazing. I highly recommend this method for roasting  a prime rib.

I was so worried about cooking my  rib roast at  500 degrees then shutting the oven off for 2 hrs. but it came out perfect!!!  This is definitely the recipe I will use from this point forward.  I did have some people tell me that leaving a roast out for 4 hrs to get to rm temp is asking for trouble...that it is a safety concern.  That wasn't voiced on the reviews so I'm not sure...

Simply exceptional - a true hit at our Christmas Eve party.  I never dared to try to cook prime rib. This recipe dissolved my fear.  Use you favorite fresh herbs. I used butter, fresh garlic, thyme, salt and pepper. That's it.

I just made this and the meat turned out moist and juicy. I used  fresh rosemary and thyme,  and black pepper to mix with the butter to coat the meat.  It did create a lot of smoke in the kitchen even with clean oven. Everyone like the way the meat turned out .... Just didnt want a smokey kitchen.

I made this recipe for our Christmas dinner and it was wonderful!  While cooking it, my family continuously remarked how easy the cooking method was (nothing difficult about walking around a "turned off" oven!).  The prime rib was wonderfully medium rare, and hot and ready to eat immediately pulled out of the oven.  I agree with another reviewer that the kitchen filled up with some smoke (I believe it was due to the fat on the prime rib as well as the butter-based  rub), but it really only lasted about 20 of the 33 minutes our roast needed to cook at 500 degrees.  Cannot wait to make this again!!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This was fantastic! Made this rib roast today for Christmas dinner. It was perfect. I left it in the oven for 3 hours after turning the oven off. It was perfectly cooked and very tender and flavorful. Everyone loved it.

Works pretty darn good.  I was having a hard time because the recipe was a little unclear, whether the roast was bone in or not.  It also did not specify what room temperature is before you begin cooking.  With a little research, I was able to get things close enough to make this work.  I can say that the roast needs to be 65 -70 degrees and the 5 minutes works well for boneless to get a medium rare roast for #5er, giving a 2 minute for reheat after opening the door, 27 mins.  In 2 hours my oven was not hot at all, and even though I have a commercial Wolf stove, it cools a little faster than a conventional oven, as commercial typically uses more air flow than a home range because of commercial venting.  I had checked the roast at 1:45 and found that it was a little rare at 120 degrees, so I warmed things up till I got to 130 degrees at center for medium rare.  140 would be more medium, except at dead center.  These adjusted temps were probably due to the roast starting at 55 degrees after 4 hours or counter time, as my fridge is set to 38 degrees.  So when you leave a rating, be real specific on temps, type of roast and cooking times to help everyone make adjustments with their roast.  Great job John.

I've made this twice and neither time pleased with the outcome. This time the meat cooked so fast that the fat was still chewy. The middle was rare the outside two inches well done. It got up to 115 in less than an hour after turning the oven off. Thankfully I had a thermometer in it. I didn't compensate for the weight of the bones which I took off in order to make stock for au jus, so it may have cooked longer than it should have at 500, but I can't see that making or breaking it. I think I'll try long and slow next time.

I let my 5lb prime rib sit out for 6hrs before cooking & it came out perfect if you like med-rare. I substituted the seasoning for 2T of olive oil, 2t tyme, 1T pepper & 10 minced garlic cloves & rubbed all over meat. Sprinkled w/kosher salt, roasted on 500 degrees for 30 min & it was perfectly med rare. I made the au jus recipe from Chef John as well.

I was afraid to leave the roast in the oven turned off, so I kept the temp at 325 for two hours. One of the other reviewers recommended this, and it worked well for me, as I wanted it more medium than rare.

I followed recipe to the letter, a bit rare for my family's test. I just carved it as instructed and put it back in oven for additional 30 minutes for the doneness we desire. Great flavors, easy steps.

We went with a 6lb roast and though I left the over on 500 for perhaps 10 minutes too long (a little Christmas nap) we were very impressed with the finished product.

Definitely will use this method again!

The first time I made a prime rib using this recipe, it came out great for me (it was more toward the rare side than medium rare).  My husband ate it but would have preferred it a little more medium.  The next time I fixed the roast using this recipe, I increased the "math" from 5 minutes per pound to 5.75 minutes per pound.  It was a little more to the medium rare side and my husband loved it.    This is without a doubt the easiest prime rib recipe going.  And the crust using the herbs de provence  with lavender added the extra flavor needed.  I will be making this every Christmas using this recipe.  Thank you Chef John for this foolproof recipe.

Okay I have to say that although I love Chef John's recipes and have tried a bunch, I was skeptical of this "turn your oven off for two hours" technique. However, I did try it in the end and so glad I did. I had a 7.87lb roast and I kept it on 500degrees for 40 mins then turned off the oven and kept it in there for two hours. When I opened the oven it was pretty much room temperature which made me nervous. But I let the meat rest for about 30 mins and when j cut into it, it was perfectly done. I'll never make prime rib roast aNy other way ever again.

I've destroyed good peices of meat before and so I really wanted to make sure this would be a better outcome. I left the 6lbs. cut on the counter for about 4.5 hours however, when I checked the temp, the inside was still cold. Fearing an undercooked result, I opted to up the time by 5 minues (35 mins rather than 30). 

35 minutes in a pre-heated 500F oven, turned off and the breaker thrown (just to make sure a vent fan wouldnt take the heat once it was turned off), and waited....

2 hours later, my first look at the meat. Beautifully rendered, I pulled it and sliced into it. What a wonderful sight. The outside sliver was red and quickly turning to a nice pink.  Consistance throughout, it was a very nice pink hue when served.  Not to mention, everyone loved it, and went back for more.

However; now knowing the result, next time, I will opt to forgoe the extra 5 minute cook time as I would have prefered it even rarer in the center, but that wasn't the recipies fault, it was my own fear and adjustment.  But now I know.

If I could rate it higher I would. I didn't believe this would work when I read it, but I took a deep breath and tried it on my Xmas prime rib. It was better than perfect. I have made other roasts since then, all different sizes, and they all came out perfectly.

I cooked the roast today as specified,  on Chef John's site. I had an 8.85 lb. x 5 (min.)= 48 min. at 500 degrees. I cooked it an extra 5 min. because I was concerned the inside wasn't brought to room temperature. I then let it set in the oven for 2 hours. Excellent, Perfect! We all loved it. I rubbed mine with large crystal Himalayan pink salt (4 Tb.), pepper (about 1/8 cup), garlic (1 Tb.), oregano (3-4 Tb.). The only problem when you cook it this high is your smoke alarms will go off so make sure you have windows open and good ventilation. We had our alarms go off three times and say "fire!", "fire"  This was good because we didn't know our new hard wire spoke alarms would do that, so now we know. I will use this method again for sure.

very easy recipe, and the results were good. However, if doing a larger roast (mine was 9.75 lbs), I would either reduce the amount of time at 500 degrees (45 versus 52), or reduce the length of time after the oven is turned off. Au Jus recipe was good as well, but there again I would make it for 1/2 the number of servings you think.

I made this for the first time for Christmas eve dinner. I was on pins and needles for the whole two hours, wondering if this was some kind of a joke and I'd end up with a raw piece of meat we'd have to slice down and broil as steaks. It was too, too easy but it turned out perfect. A little less rare than I like, but the entire family raved. I'll be making this again. And again.

Perfect technique for perfect prime rib.  It is true that it limits the use of the oven for other dishes for the better part of 3 hours, but on the other hand, you know exactly when the roast is going to be done.  I make twice baked potatoes ahead of time, warm them in the microwave and finish them under the broiler while I am slicing the roast and making the au jus.

I really want to try this method but my question is, will this work for a 15lb roast? The others seem to be smaller ones.
Thanks!

The only change that I made was using dried rosemary instead of the herb it suggested. I just did not have it. As for everything else, I kept exactly the same. It is absolutely delicious and the roast from end to middle cook range is medium well to medium rare in the middle. Perfect for my family. Just be sure you pay attention to your time. It is the only way that we make our rib roast now.

After attempting to make prime rib 2 years in a roll (X-mas dinners) and totally over cooking, I stumbled across Chef' John's recipe.  After trying it his way, lets just say it was beyond easy and came out perfect!!!  Thanks so much for providing the instructions.

I followed all directions EXACTLY and my roast came out well done.  Apparently this doesn't work with a roast smaller than 6 lbs.  The concept seems sound and I put on my oven light (without opening the door) several times and was tempted to take it out after an hour but left it in for the full 2 hours as directed.  I will try it again but will take it out much sooner as we like our rib roast medium rare.

The easiest method for a perfectly cooked prime rib roast. I used this method on an eye of round,  which can turn into a piece of shoe leather, roasting for 7 minutes a pound, and it was pink from end to end and side to side with nice pan drippings.  Last week  I did a trial run on a standing rib, and it came out perfectly !!  For Christmas Eve, I'm making two 5 lbers and roasting for 35 minutes.  The only  problem with this method is that the oven is tied up for a long  period of time.

Perfect.  Every time.  Do it exactly as the instructions state and you'll get a perfect medium rare roast.  No more holding your breath when you cut it - don't worry. It's right! Thanks, Chef John!!

I think YMMV with this recipe depending on your oven. I learned tonight that my oven isn't too great and doesn't retain heat as much as it should according to the timing in this recipe. I cooked a 5lb bone-in rib roast and did about 27mins total at 500, then shut the oven off and let it sit for the suggested two hours. I had a meat thermometer setup to monitor the temp and it shot up pretty fast the first hour or so, then it plateaued at 122-124 for the remaining 45 minutes. So it was on the verge of rare and medium rare, which is a bit too much for my wife and I. It sounds like for others the same timing may result in a truer medium rare than in my experience. I'm glad I didn't overcook it I suppose... and I could have worked on the seasoning a bit more. Next time I'm probably going to stick with a more classic recipe of turning the temp down (rather than off) to get a little more cook on it.

I have made this numerous times and am making it again for Christmas Eve since it's now the meal of choice..Follow the directions exactly, and do yourself a big favor and put a note on the oven door "DO NOT OPEN".. I'm always fearful someone will try to open it since it smells wonderful and I wouldn't know where to begin to finish it if that happened. By far the easiest recipe and the most perfect prime rib. Highly recommend

I made this for Christmas Dinner for 15.  I got a 10 lb boneless prime rib which was very expensive.  I did the math and cooked it in a roasting pan on a rack for 50 min at 500 degrees in my new Bosch oven.  When we opened the oven after the 50 min cooking time and two hours with oven door closed my oven was a huge mess of splatters everywhere!!!! I was so sad that it did this!  The meat was good but I was so disappointed.  Today I looked at the video to see what I did wrong and the only difference  in the video was that I cooked it on a rack.  I'll never make this recipe again.  :-(

Absolutely the best prime rib I have ever eaten!  This is also my very first time making it myself.  This recipe is FOOLPROOF!  If you follow the directions, you CAN'T screw this up!   
I will admit though that half way into the cooking process, my smoke alarm went off.  I had to open the doors and a few windows to get them to turn off but it was SO worth it when I finally got to eat :-)  It was very easy and oh so good!

My wife took her first bite and screamed "Foodgasm!"  So good, so easy, and fool proof.  I followed this exactly as Chef John did it and I have to say it's as good if not better than any prime rib I've had at  a restaurant.  An easy 5 stars!

Did this cook in a Big Green Egg, it was incredible! I cut the time to 4:30/lb. because the Egg is so thermally efficient. This is now my 'go to' method for rib roasts. I will also try other seasonings and etc. in the future.

I have used this recipe many times with different size prime ribs and it always comes out perfectly. I change the cooking time according to Chef John's formula, 5 minutes per pound, and I get raves from my guests. They are always amazed how simple it is.

Hands down the best! We ended up having it 3 hours after it was pulled out of the oven, due to our crazy schedule. Hubby's comment: by far the best he has ever had, even way better than any steak house dinner! Guess what I am gonna make to impress our next guest?!

I tried this method for a 3 lb prime rib and it worked as promised. I added 1 minute to the time in at 500 because we like our beef medium. It was perfect. Thanks Chef John.

My husband has been making it this way for about 20 years. You need to know your oven. We tell people to turn your oven up as high as it will go. Also, he likes his rare and will adjust the 20 minute timing for a 4lb roast (5 min per lb) to about 19 min and 30 seconds to make it a little rarer. Once that happens, you will be very happy.  We also use a cast iron pan and make sure that the oven is clean before cooking. (PS we also heard that you can cook a turkey or chicken this way but have not tried it or found a recipe. ...ANYONE???)

We have cooked our standing rib roasts this way for years with flawless results!!  It must be said....if you want your meat more done than medium rare, you simply cook it longer per pound.  I read somewhere that for medium, you'd leave the oven on for 6 minutes per pound instead of 5, and so forth, still following the 2 hour rule.  Virtually fool-proof!!

I have done this before for Christmas and one thing I learned if you do not have a self cleaning oven don't attempt this. Especially in a cold climate. I did it without a self cleaning oven and it was raw, with a self cleaning oven no problem, perfect medium rare. Self cleaning ovens have insulation or more insulation than non self cleaning.

I have been enjoying this recipe since I was a little girl! My mother would put in the roast before the family went to church in the morning, and it would be PERFECT every time no matter what time dinner was served! I don't use any other method when I make Rib Roast. It is critical that you resist the temptation to open the oven door before the 2 hours...and be prepared for the oven to smoke a bit!

Have cooked many a prime rib using ever method imaginable. This is BY FAR, the easiest and fool proof method. As long as you are sure to get roast to room temp first, you can't fail. The seasoning is perfect. Highly recommend.

My mother submitted this recipe to a newspaper cooking contest in the 1960s.  She won first prize, and it is still the easiest, best and most consistently delicious recipe for beef roast  ever.  Thanks to Chef John for sharing this recipe with the multitudes.

I've made a version of this that I found somewhere else, and I can't recommend this method enough. I cooked it at 550 degrees at (and this is important for flexibility) 5-1/2 minutes PER POUND for a bone-in roast. (5 minutes per pound for rare, 6 for medium, etc.) I've cooked the prime rib using this method more than once and it's turned out so perfect every time that my friends were all "Oooh-ing" and "Ahh-ing" each time. I've cooked prime rib for many years, but none of them have turned out as consistently dead-bang as with this method. You HAVE to try it.

I followed the recipe exactly making the necessary time adjustments based on the weight of my roast and it was perfect. I was worried the roast would be undercooked because my oven was cold when I removed the roast but, after a moment of panick before carving the roast, there was nothing to fret about. Thanks Chef John!

Made this recipe once before, now making it as I type to compensate for no Thanksgiving leftovers! So simple and foolproof,  get rave reviews every time I cook it,  and the house smells amazing while cooking! My local butcher puts his special prime rib rub on at the time of purchase, and I make sure to let the roast get room temp before cooking;  that and a good electric oven are the key to this roast coming out so perfect! Other than that,  I follow instructions exactly.

I made absolutely no changes to this recipe and have made a probably 4 or 5 times.  It comes out perfect every time - Thank you Chef John.  The Au Jus that goes with it is also fabulous.  Making it again for my son's 25 birthday - by request.

I have made this recipe quite a few times now and it always comes out perfectly... even in my original 1960 ' s oven. I tried another recipe one time and it didn't work! These roasts are too expensive to play around with a recipe, so I just stick to this one. I also use this method when cooking other beef roasts in the oven.

I made PERFECT Prime Rib using this cooking method the very first time I ever cooked a prime rib roast. It's all about the timetable and making sure your roast is at room temperature before cooking. We seasoned it differently so you can do it as you like, just follow the cooking instructions and you'll never have a dried out roast again.

Perfect cooking method, I was skeptical, but it did in fact make a perfect medium rare on a nearly 4 lb rib roast.  I didn't use the herbs de provence, instead I seasoned with both a kosher salt rub and then a generous sprinkling of Montreal steak seasoning and it turned out FANTASTIC!

This was amazing. I made it exactly per the instructions and it was perfect- and I'm generally not a fan of prime rib! Made it with the beef au jus and both my husband and I loved it. Thanks Chef John!!!!

Fabulous! The recipe says to plan on 3 hours for it to get to room temperature, but the video says 6 hours. Watching the video was very helpful.

I made this with a Ribeye Roast for Christmas dinner using fresh ground Rosemary, Lemon Thyme, & Garlic with a sprinkling of Tenderizer over the meat first with my seasonings mixed into the butter. I cooked it per Chef John's instructions @ my sister's house in her less than accurate oven & it still turned out absolutely AMAZING! There were some corners that looked charred beyond recognition & even those pieces were juicy tender bites of pure Christmas Heaven! My husband now wants all roasts cooked this way & I'm not going to argue with him. This was by far the best beef we have ever had & it was fork tender. It was also a 8 lb roast for 8 people. It was wiped out as everyone wanted 2 nds & we were all nibbling on it even before fixing our dinner plates. We have eaten at some VERY EXPENSIVE steak houses in our day & this as said is the best beef we have had in our lives. Although I'm going to use my portable oven thermostat if I cook it at my sister's ever again (just cause that's how I roll!). Will be making many more of this man's recipes!

It was beautiful. I had no idea we could make a perfect restaurant quality prime rib at home.  We made this on Thanksgiving and it turned out better than I could have imagined.  It was so easy too.  I was a little wary of leaving the meat on the counter for 6 hours, but it turned out great and was safe to do. Chef John perfected this recipe, even down to the minute.  The video is great for reference.  We've made it again with the same results.  It's going to be a favorite now.

I followed it to the letter, but it came out way too raw. We ate the outside tonight.  I'll have to roast it again tomorrow.

I made this for New Year's Eve. I inadvertently left it in the oven for 1 1/2 hours at 500 degrees. I thought for sure it was ruined but I took it out of the oven right away and covered it with foil while I prepared the rest of the dinner. I was amazed when I cut into it and it was juicy and medium rare! The crust was delicious also.

I was skeptical with the ease of the directions but make many of Chef John's recipes so gave it a whirl. Being inquisitive I used a remotely placed meat thermometer into the prime rib and monitored it the entire time. As Chef John promised the internal temperature began to rise after about twenty minutes and at the two hour mark was 137 degrees. Cut open, a perfect medium rare, pink and juicy. Everyone loved it and it is now my only Prime Rib recipe! As a side note I also used his Au Jus recipe without the flour and it was amazing as well!

Didn't change a thing. This was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  My wife and 13 year old son were a bit wary about it being too rare, but one bite from the carving instantly won them over.

This is an AMAZING recipe!  I was a little nervous to make our Christmas meat this way but we did and it was the best prime rib we've ever made - by far (including the kosher method and the herb rub - both of those were good but not like this).  I won't ever do it any other way.  It was so easy!  We followed the recipe exactly and cooked the 6 lb. roast for 30 minutes.  We put a chair a few inches away and in front of the oven (with a note on it that said DO NOT OPEN!!!) so there weren't any inadvertent oven openings.  Besides oven problems, I wonder if some of the reviewers who didn't like this method may have purchased a roast that was too lean.  The butcher recommended that I purchase one of the roasts that had a little more marbled fat throughout.  It was so flavorful.  Highly recommended recipe!   Thank you Chef John!!

Thanks so much Chef John for this recipe!  I fixed an 11.5 lb. prime rib roast for Christmas dinner and it turned out absolutely PERFECT! Using a previous comment, I cleaned the oven the day prior and followed the directions exactly as written.  The meat was medium rare to a perfect rare in the very middle and the taste was out of this world. I changed the spice combo to some of our favorite herbs, sweet basil, thyme, and a touch of rosemary. Then I mixed those with the fresh ground pepper & room temp. butter.  Afterwards, I liberally sprinkled the kosher salt, as chef John wrote.  UMMMMM, good!

I just want to say, THANK YOU CHEF JOHN!I tried this recipe yesterday for my families Christmas dinner! If I could I would give you 10 stars! the taste was amazing and it was cooked to perfection. I have tried so many of your recipes and will continue to do so in the future. You have never failed me yet with any of them! Your recipe for Au Jus was also fantastic! My whole family raved about the flavor and perfection to which the meat and gravy was done!

I have done this three times.  The first (3# 2 rib roast) came out rare to med-rare.  The second was a 6# 4 rib roast and it came out med. rare.  The last time was a 10# 6? rib roast and it came out med-WELL.  All were choice grade.  I have a modern oven, followed recipe exactly except let the 10# prime rib stay out for 5 hours to bring to room temp.  Overall I like the ease but I would need to adjust the temps accordingly.

The method of cooking is by far the best for a perfectly done roast. I have been making this a number of years for Christmas dinner and always get complimented on finished - rare on the inside and done on the outside - roast. The herbes de provence adds a wonderful flavor.

I used A LOT more seasoningand probably mixed about 4 tablespoons of butter with about 5 or 6 tablespoons of herbs. There is so much meat I personally feel that it needs a lot of seasoning and that way the drippings become very flavorful too. Put lots of salt on! I used garlic salt. Chef John's timing calculation is FLAWLESS. Thanks for the recipe!

I used this method last year and it was perfection! I had 2 roasts and 2 ovens. I did my own seasoning. I will be making it again for Christmas dinner this year. I can't wait! Especially the peoples faces when they first taste it. Fantastic!

I was always hesitant to try a rib roast for fear of ruining a beautiful cut of meat. I found this method and I've successfully made three roasts that have turned out perfectly every time. My husband requested I make another roast for Christmas dinner this year and I'm confident that I will add to the number of successful roasts again this year!

My husband and I did a trial run before Christmas as we've never done this before. We used a 2.28lb cut and followed the formula accordingly. I was iffy about it, but now I want to roast everything this way!! I read somewhere to leave it in the refrigerator uncovered overnight gives it a better "crust", and that's what we did, but then added nothing but salt and pepper before roasting. My father in law is a chef at a steakhouse, and I'm pretty confident he's going to love it.

My husband said he loved his prime rib.  He likes it more rare. The inside is bright pink/red. The outside is done to my liking. I used exact method he said except I didn't salt because the salt will pull the juices out of the meat.

I did a 6.6 lbs Prime Rib and let me tell you how awesome it was.  When I cut the bones off it it was flowing with juices.  I carved the ends off and revealed a beautiful med rare Prime Rib. I wanted to test this method before I do our Christmas Prime Rib.  I now know that I am safe making it for my family. Thanks John! And making your oven hold heat is easy: cover the vent with foil or tape after you turn the heat off.

My family has been using this recipe for over 30 years. It's foolproof! Seasoning can be adjusted to your personal preference. Don't open the oven door once you start the roasting. Any size roast works. Roast for 5 minutes/ lb.

Hi Chef John,
I followed your Prime Rib recipe to a "T" had my brother and sister-law for dinner (tough critics)and they were so impressed with my cooking skills thanks to you! I must say I'm a pretty good cook most of the time but not always confident of what I'm doing and with your help made me feel I can do this. You were right on the money! The 5lb Prime Rib(whoa expensive piece of meat didnt want to screw it up)was perfection and the Au Jus came out awesome it also was the star of the meal...all I kept hearing from my guests and my hubby was deeeeeelicious! I finished the meal off with your recipe for Pumpkin Cheesecake....it came out perfect and more rave reviews from my guests. You make things so easy to follow you are definetly my go to for recipe ideas when I need to make  a tried and true and star studded meal. Love You Chef thanks so much. Oh and I love your videos your so entertaining and your voice soothing lol. :)

I have made prime rib at home for years and impressed many of guests but it never is as perfectly cooked like this.  It is foolproof!!  It's beautiful.  Totally amazing served with Chef John's (also seemingly foolproof) Au Jus.  With all that being said and we can say it again this method of cooking is amazing......I prefer my own spices and will use them from now on but will always always always prepare it this way with homemade Au Jus.  Thank you Chef John!!

My husband and I were skeptical but it turned out PERFECT!  This is also my first time cooking Prime Rib.  We both were amazed how easy and how it was cooked to perfection. I have tried a taste of my husbands Prime Rib while out dining and never cared for the taste.  I really do not care for beef roasts but this one surprised me!  The only suggestion I have is that we would have placed the the meat on a warmed plated covered with foil, after it was done, while we made the Au Jus which was also very good.  I had to put a piece of blue painters tape across the oven door to remind my husband not to open the oven!!

We have used this recipe several times and our prime ribs have turned out perfectly!  Notice the cook's note at the end of the recipe to figure out the exact cooking time for your size of prime rib.  We have cooked several different sizes of prime rib using Chef John's method of calculating the cooking times, and each were cooked to perfection.  Thank you for such an easy, perfect recipe!

This recipe was amazing and so easy. My first time making it and I was a little scared; did not want to mess up such an expensive piece of meat. However, you cannot go wrong with this one. Made a horseradish sauce to eat with it, yummy!!

Best recipe ever!  I have used this for both a 4.0lb and a 7.2lb roast and each came out PERFECTLY.  You can never have enough butter and seasoning on it.  Also, if you think you have put enough salt on it, put more.  Most of it falls off during the cooking.  I also add 2 minutes to the initial time because of loss of heat when opening the door.

This recipe works perfectly every time. I cook it in our basement suite oven which is quite old, but the formula is right on. If I had only one oven though, it would be such an inconvenience to tie it up for hours on end. That's my only peeve with this recipe.

I was a skeptic, especially using a new recipe for Christmas dinner, but it had so many great reviews I decided to try!  I tested my oven first to be sure it would hold the temp for long enough, thankfully it did.  I used my own seasonings, and followed the directions to a T.  It was the hardest thing to NOT open that oven door, and I think I threatened at least 2 lives as people would peer in the glass!  I have to say, I am so happy I tried this recipe, I will NEVER make prime rib any other way! It was absolutely amazing!! Using this recipe again for Easter tomorrow!

I followed the recipe and used Chef John's au jus.  My brother stopped by and couldn't believe how great it was.  When I told him how easy it was he asked for the recipe.  It was the best prime rib I've ever cooked and it wasn't the most expensive cut of meat I purchased(far from it actually, I bought it at Jewel)! It came out perfect right between rate and medium rare!   The au jus was also great, very easy and the flavor was perfect!  I should have taken pictures, next time I will!

I improvise the recipe a little. I added a tablespoon of mince garlic to the butter mixter and a table spoon of worcestershire. I also lower the temp after the recommened 500 degree to 250 degrees and stuck a meat thermometer in it. remove roast when it reach the desire temp. It came out perfect. I did not follow the  recommened way of cooking cause the meat was cold after the two hrs

Amazing!  I was skeptical but this not only was perfectly medium rare, but the flavour due to the rub and the crispy brown exterior was fabulous for presentation.  Thanks, Chef John, as usual a wonderful , elegant recipe.

Amazing! Followed the recipe to the letter, my oven only goes to 500 degrees and I will add about 30 seconds more time per pound in the oven today when I make this for the second time. Serving with loaded baked potatoes and au jus.

Great recipe. I have used it several times and it comes out great. I find that mine comes out closer to medium than a shade under medium rare by using the times listed.I may be using a thinner cut prime rib or maybe my oven thermostat is off a bit. I usually cut the time in the oven while it's off by 4-5 minutes and it works for me.

Has to be 5 stars: easy to make, reliable, and extremely tasty recipe. The seasoning was fantastic (herbs de provence) on the prime roast. I actually ate the ribs after removing them (see video) and they are just fantastic. One note to share for folks trying - pay attention to the shape of the roast. If the roast is either long or tall, you will want to let it sit less time in the oven and monitor internal temp.

Followed the recipe exactly for Christmas Eve dinner and it was PERFECT! Family loved it and everyone wanted to know how we cooked it! It's great knowing that I don't have to stand by the oven trying to get the meat done just right, one less concern!  Thank you!

I Ruined the 2012 Christmas roast, I Vowed not to repeat my mistake. CJ's recipe Saved my roast this year! Rib eye roast is Expensive, even if you find it on sale. The key to the success is getting the roast to ROOM TEMPATURE! It helps ensure even cooking. I took my 9 lb roast out 3 hrs before I cooked it @ 500 deg. for 45 mins. DO NOT OPEN OVEN FOR 2 HRS!! Afterwards, my external thermometer read 134. I had it set for 135. This gave me leeway since the roast was a wee bit cool & pink. My hubby likes med well beef, I heated up my cast iron skillet and seared the slices for just a few seconds. PERFECTION!! I pinky swear to never cook rib roast any other way again!!Thank You Chef John, this is the Best Christmas gift Ever!!

I have tried to make a prime rib or standing rib roast about 4 times already without much success.  I tried this recipe this year for Christmas and this was the first time that i can say that i was fully satisfied.  I did add some seasonings to the recipe.  Onion powder, garlic powder and Adobe.  About half a tablespoon off each.  And i used half a cup of butter because i had a larger roast.  Mine was 6.73 lbs.  I let it set out for about 6 hours before it went in the oven.  I probably should have let it set out 7.  It was well done on the outside for about half an inch.  Then the entire inside was medium rare.  Absolutely delicious.  Thank-you Chef John.

I have been wanting to try making a prime rib for a long time and was skeptical about this method of cooking.  I decided to give it a try today.  My prime rib was 4.78 lbs and I cooked it for 25 min @ 500°, turned the oven off, and let it rest for 2 hours per the instructions.  It was really hard to not open the oven, but I didn't!  The roast turned out perfect, Medium Rare! It was perfect!  My mother in law likes it well done, so I cut off an end piece, seared it in fry pan and then we were all happy.   Thanks for the great recipe and the instructions for modifying the cook time based on weight.

I have cooked a lot of prime ribs, this is by far the easiest way in the oven.  Tryed for the first time New Years day for the family and friends, did two at the same time, 1-8lbs, and 1-3lbs (had a few people add on for dinner at the last min. Put the 8 in at 525 for 40 min. and the put the 3 in with 17 min. to go then turned off the oven for the two hours......Perfect!  Thanks, have a great dinner!

Like Chef John said, "YOU HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD OVEN."

If you have a cheap oven or convection oven, this x5 technique will not work for you. Ovens heat up and then turn off over and over again to maintain the average temperature that you have set. Cheaper ovens do this more violently than others and may not be able to hold in the heat and convection ovens move air around to make the oven even hotter. You'll have to find another technique or roast it the old fashioned way. Hot at first to seal the meat and then low and slow to cook to TEMPERATURE, not time. Also, I would recommend this technique for smaller roasts (2-4 bones), I have NOT attempted this technique on a whole roast.

I have cooked prime rib this way for many years, but I always keep a meat thermometer stuck in it just in case and I also have an oven thermometer to make sure the oven temp is just right (when using other ovens).

The salted herbs and butter make the outside taste great but the inside is all about the meat itself! Perfect pink all the time and since its been cooling down in the oven for hours, its safe enough to cut it apart without burning you.

Don't throw out the drippings and burnt pieces! Try out an au jus or popovers recipe (they are easy).

Thank you, Chef John for helping me put the most perfect prime rib on our Christmas table! Our roast was almost 8lbs, 4 ribs and following your directions to the letter, it was the scrumptious centerpiece of the meal. The butter, herbs de provence, salt and pepper formed a beautifully scented crust; the interior was dark pink and juicey. Thank you for giving me the confidence to roast an expensive cut of beef to fine dining quality! My family and friends are impressed!

This method of cooking prime rib is the bomb!  You rock Chef John.  I bought a 4 rib 8.30 pound rib roast at about 124.00 dollars total.  I was super skeptical about that big of a roast working with this method.  I never had the courage to try and cook one before now and I am so glad I trusted Chef Johns recommendation on how to cook the perfectly pink prime rib!  My house was filled with compliments and the 8.30 pound roast turned out PERFECT!  Thank you Chef John!  I served this with your twice baked potatoes and I had one happy family on my hands at Christmas Dinner!  awesome!  Keep those great recipes coming Chef John!  You ROCK!

Used this recipe for Christmas dinner 2013.  Always scary to use a new recipe with such an expensive piece of meat, but this was, by far, the best prime rib I've ever made.  Definitely 5 star.

Followed the directions exactly for a 7 pound prime rib (35 minutes at 500 degrees, then 2 hours in the over) and it came out perfectly.  I will use this recipe for prime rib from now on. I've tried packing prime rib in a coat of kosher salt (messy and time consuming)as well as a variety of other regular roasting methods and this method is the easiest and the prime rib was delicious.  No need for any other recipe for me.

My oven probably isn't insulated enough.  My roast was definitely at room temp, so that wasn't the problem.  The meat was a little on the rare side.  But the worst part it was room temperature when served!  The butter burned in the oven and created, as others have said, a great deal of smoke.  I will not use this recipe again.  But I realize that maybe with a better oven and warmer kitchen the outcome would probably have been better!

This is the 4th prime rib I have cooked and I have to say, this method is by far the easiest and best. It was perfectly medium rare with an awesome crust. The only change I made was to season the meat the night before with sea salt, cracked black pepper and garlic powder. I then rubbed it with butter and added more kosher salt and pepper since I really like the outer crust. 

Like everyone says, the key is to make sure you bring it to room temperature before you cook it. I do have to admit, I was nervous about cutting into it after letting it rest, worried it was going to be too rare...my husband likes his a bit more medium than rare so I gave him the end piece. He told me (jokingly) that if I made it any other way, he was going to give me a black eye! I think it was a hit.

I have now cooked two prime ribs this way. They were different weights, but both came out absolutely perfect. I have an electric range that has a self cleaning feature, so, I cook the meat 5 min. per lb. @ 500F.Then, I turn off the oven, but pull the locking lever on the door (Normally used for self cleaning) and let it sit for 2 hrs. No heat loss, works perfect! By the way, why does the cooking time total 2hrs. and 20 mins. on your example,  but you show 6 hrs. and 30 mins. on your total cooking time at the end? It says no need for resting time.

Yes, this is the perfect roast. Of course I think all of Chef John's recipes turn out great. The secret is not to open the door for the allotted two hours.  Have also tried it with sirloin tip. Shygal

Best prime rib ever. I'll never prepare it another way. I suggest that you don't have side dishes that need to cook in the oven as the roast will cool too much if left to sit out. It was fine for baking rolls for 10-12 minutes but I wouldn't cook anything much longer.

I have been doing my prime rib like this (different rub) for years. People thought I was crazy so it is nice to find another recipe that is similar. Always turns out perfect for us medium rare meat lovers.

Every time I have ever roasted anything in an oven, I have always (without fail) used a meat thermometer.  I have had great success preparing prime rib in the past, and predictably have always used my trusty meat thermometer.  

I tried this recipe because of the rave reviews.  I am now a huge fan!!  This method is magic – trust it – use it.  I did not use a meat thermometer and the roast was perfect.  The thought of putting this kind of money in an oven with no back-up was a serious stretch for me but like I said this is magic.  I always wondered how restaurants were able to prepare prime rib so consistently great all the time – now I know.

I was a bit afraid of the butter because of the reported smoke issues, so I used a bit of oil with my herbs.  There was still smoke (and smoke alarms).  I realized I should have used the range vent on low to take care of this issue (duh) – next time I use butter.

I left the 5 lb roast out for 5 hrs then prepared it just as the recipe suggested. It was delicious, but I didn't like it being room temperature when serving. Also, it would have been nice to warn us about all the smoke! For the first 35 min of the baking cycle, I had to open all exterior doors and turn on the ceiling fans to keep the smoke alarms silent. I'm a huge fan of Chef John, but I think I'll stick to my old recipe for rib roasts in the future.

This Prime Rib was amazing.  I also use this same recipe for Eye of Round Roast, slice it thin after it is cooked and serve it with Au Jus and it tastes like prime rib.  Very easy, fool proof and soooo good.

It was awesome!  I was skeptical, but it worked just like chef said.  It was a little cool in the middle, but just a hair, and to be honest, it was my fault.  Make sure the meat is fully room temp, mine was pretty cool still, and then I let it sit for 15 min after coming out of oven. Bottom line it really worked and I am so happy I can finally cook red-meats.

This cooking method works perfectly!!  I used my own seasonings, so I'm not sure on that part, but my advice is to try this cooking method.  It is very scary the first time, but mine turned out PERFECT!  I won't ever use another cooking method for our prime rib.

It was really good, but after sitting in the oven for 2 hours, the meat was only luke warm, not much fun to eat. Anyone have suggestions for a way around this? I think I'll play around with it. Next time I'll try leaving the oven on for an extra 5 minutes, but still starting the 2 hour countdown, instead of turning the over off.

The 500 degree oven caused my whole house to become filled with smoke and the smoke alarms went off! When the 2 hours was up the roast was way too rare to eat (and I like my prime rib rare). I calculated the time just the way the instructions said. We had to put the $80.00 roast back in the oven on 400 for an extra 30 minutes, the rest of the meal was ready so it all had to be put on hold, including the Yorkshire Pudding!! All in all I was very disappointed. I also had trouble getting the butter mixture to stick to the roast. We ended up using a kitchen torch to soften the butter on the roast so it would spread, and then the spices slid partway off the meat and made one thick pile of "bark" on the top edge of the roast. It tasted great, but did not look very appetizing.

This was the perfect Christmas dinner. I had a 9 1/2+ pound roast(rib in)cut for me at the store. Prepared exactly as Chef John directed. WOW!!!!! perfectly cooked for me and my son, a little too rare for my wife and daughter in law (nuked theirs for a minute and 1/2 to cook more). Perfect....served with au jus, twice baked potatoes, broccoli and cheese, orange mandarin jello, dinner rolls and wine. Thanks for sharing.

The easiest and most flavorful prime rib that I have ever eaten or prepared!  As a previous reviewer stated, it is important that the roast be at room temperature prior to roasting and no peeking during the final 2 hours.  I can't say enough good about this recipe.  If you follow Chef John's recipe, you will never need a meat thermometer  for prime rib again.

This cooking method is awesome. I made 8 pound prime rib yesterday and it came out great. By the way the oven is old and not the best.  This method is easy and truly fool proof.  Thank you Chef John.

I was extremely terrified and stressed while preparing and making this recipe, its not cheap and my fiance was extremely excited when he seen that I had purchased it! It came out fantastic!
