I also wanted a authentic German Apfel Strudel, and because I was making enough to serve about 60 people I wanted something easy!  I substituted raisins for the poppy seed, but it turned out great!!!!  Will definately use this recipe again!

For Oktoberfest, I wanted real apfel strudel, not something made with a box cake mix.  This recipe was straightforward and easy to do.  Peeling 9 small apples took awhile, but hey! I wanted authentic.  I only used about 2/3 c water to make the dough.  More would have been too sticky and hard to roll.  Be sure to chop the apples so that they roll up evenly in the thin dough.

Ground poppy seeds is a popular ingredient in European recipies. Millions of people love it, so trust me, be a little open-minded and try it! Lots of delicious filling and very small amount of pastry.

Lots of time an effort yielded a disappointing result. The dough was, as another reviewer said, nearly impossible to work with. The ratio of filling to dough was also way off.

This looked more like Polish Makownik but with apples, so I tried it out.   The dough came out tougher than expected. Maybe because of the altitude I'm at? I'll tinker with the flour to water ratio next time.... I'll leave out the apples and cinnamon and replace with raisins and almond flavor maybe

I had no problems with the dough.
 My only “Issue” was there were too many poppy seeds.
I even reduced the amount and ground them up as one.
The flavor overall was good. Summary: 

Simple to follow; 

Dough was easy to work with and roll out; 

Cooked presentation was perfect; 

Flavor was pleasant (Could have done with a tad more Cinnamon, but that’s just me); 

Texture was overwhelming with so much Poppy Seeds.

I think the directions left out something that might confuse folks.  You spread it thin on sheet so that you can slowly pull the sheet closest t you up and in, which rolls the strudel with little muss and no fuss.  I learned to make this in Austria, and this about as authentic as it gets.  Thanks for sharing!

I am of Slovenian / Croatian decent, my parents used to make apple strudel with only apples and poppy seed roll with just poppyseeds. But I find this recipe interesting because it has both the ingredients and I think this is a great combination. Thanks for the recipe.
