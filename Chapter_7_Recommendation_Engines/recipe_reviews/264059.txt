my husband LOVED this salad. It was easy and quite good. I did not blanch the herbs as per the recipe and used them raw, the flavor was muted but overall it was a hit. I also added diced tomato, cucumber and black olives.

I blanched and made the dressing according to his directions, thinking the whole time that this better taste good enough to make it worth the extra effort.  It was!  Used red quinoa because that is what I had and left out the tarragon because I didn't have any, but it still turned out to be the best tabbouleh I've ever had.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on.  Also planning on growing some tarragon so I will have it next time.  Love tabbouleh because of the taste but also because I can use my homegrown herbs.  Great base for anything you want to add to it.

I admit, I too thought this better be good for all the effort...and it was!  I am always looking for recipes I can use fresh herbs from my garden and this made good use of my herbs.  Even Mr. Meat and Potatoes liked this as a side dish!   I'll make it again!

Very tasty. I didn’t have any fresh herbs so I used dry - 2 tablespoons for 2 bunches; 1 tablespoon for 1 bunch. This worked very well for a tasty side dish when I didn’t feel like potatoes, pastas or rice. I’ll look forward to making it with fresh herbs over the summer.

This is such a change from regular bulgar wheat recipes.  We all loved it to the last grain of quinoa!
