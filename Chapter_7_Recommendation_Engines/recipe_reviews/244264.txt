So decadent!  My sister made them just as the recipe said, including the maple syrup, then I made them as well with half the batch drizzled with syrup and the other half dusted with a little icing sugar (I'm from a Dutch background ).  Yum!  Probably not an item listed on any diet,  sad to say...

I made it the same way as stated and couldn't eating them! Definitely a keeper but they are on the heavy side.

The recipe calls four 4 eggs in the video he does 2 eggs. I went with 2. There was no puffing as mine sat deep in the oil, maybe weigh down by bacon bits. I only did half with bacon.  Could not get them to fully cook through do to oil being on the high side since I am improvised with a meat thermometer. I suppose I could add another egg to the other half  to see if that helps with optimum fluff puffiness to get them up out of the oil. Try a couple with the bacon first , its different but good but different.

This was great! I do think I'll leave out the bacon next time, and have it on the side.
