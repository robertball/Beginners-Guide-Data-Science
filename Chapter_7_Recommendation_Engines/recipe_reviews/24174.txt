I loved these mushrooms.  I did make a couple of changes (I can't seem to stop myself).  I sauted the chopped mushroom stems with some finely chopped onion and minced garlic before adding them to the prepared stuffing mix.  I also used 2 cans of real crab meat instead of the imitation, cuz I had some in the cupboard that I had picked up at the 99 cent store.  I also put a healthy pinch of grated Parmesano Reggiano on top of each stuffed mushroom before baking.  Had to bake these for about 25 minutes, though. They smelled wonderful while they were baking, and I took them to my card club and the ladies snarked them all up.

One thing:  Even though I used a 24 oz box of mushrooms, and piled them high with stuffing, I had quite a bit of the stuffing left over.  The next day, I bought another 24 oz box of mushrooms and made these again for just my husband and me for dinner.  If Gary only uses 12 mushrooms, and uses up all the stuffing, the mushrooms must be ENORMOUS.  Great recipe, though!  Will make again and again.

stuffed mushrooms are a holiday staple, but i make mine a little different...chop and saute the reserved stems and about 1/2 cup chopped onion... also, i use ham instead of crab.  (you can either us the canned ham, or chop up some deli ham).  -I've never tried them with cream cheese, but think it would be a nice compliment to the ham. -
also, for extra moist mushrooms (and to save a little fat), omit the butter and drizzle a little chicken broth over the  stuffed creations just before baking.

I just love recipes that I can throw together using ingredients I already have available; that much better when the food tastes so good that everyone wants the recipe.  This is one of those recipes.  I eliminated the crabmeat since I had none on hand and J_TATUM and LOTHRID both said this did not hamper the success of the recipe.  I used one and a half sticks of butter during step five, and a half stick during the preparation of the boxed stuffing, bringing the total butter usage to 1 cup.  This was in response to the postings which said too watery or too much butter.  It worked fabulously.  Served these at a dinner party with much success.

These are FANTASTIC! I did take the advice of other reviewers and reduced the butter.  I used one stick of butter to saute the garlic, then I added the cream cheese to the melted butter/garlic until it was melted and smooth.  I added this entire mixture to Stovetop chicken flavored stuffing and added two cans of Geisha snow crab meat.  It does make alot of stuffing but it freezes well so you can save some for another batch of stuffed mushrooms.  These taste unbelievalbe.  Whether I make 25 or 75 of these for a party...every last one is eaten.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!

I made these for an appetizer, and everyone loved them.  I didn't see the point of all the butter, but after checking on them in the oven half way, I understood that it is for cooking the mushroom.  I have made them since, and added stock to the pan instead of butter, it worked just as well. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made these to have as appetizers before our Christmas dinner and they were absolutely delicious with some changes.......I doubled the amount of mushrooms but really I could have tripled and still come out okay.  I omitted the crabmeat, used mushroom and onion flavored Stove Top and light cream cheese.  And the butter-there's no reason to use that amount!  I just used the few tablespoons it took to make the stuffing and that was it.  When I finished stuffing the mushrooms, I sprinkled them with a little Parmesan cheese, paprika and dried parsley flakes.  Right before baking, I also sprinkled on a dry white wine and poured just enough wine in the pan to cover the bottom of it.  Perfection!  Everyone loved them!

I used pork sausage instead of Crab and used small mushrooms instead of large.  We had to get more mushrooms because of the amount of extra stuffing.  I use 4 - 8 oz packages of small mushrooms.  It was wonderful.  Also, you don't need as much butter.  I only used about 1/2 cup.

Yum, yum, yum . . . wow, I thought I'd never find mushrooms this good.  We had a restaurant here in St Louis that closed and I've been searching for their mushrooms and this recipe is close to it.  I read most of the reviews and changed things a bit myself, I made this with pork sausage (no crab) and half the butter.  It was great and dont tell anyone but I ate 6 myself (needless to say I was full), I made 16 mushrooms and had plenty of stuffing left for Sunday dinner,  I stuffed chicken breasts with the stuffing like another reviewer said.  I still have to find something to do with the rest but I'd eat that filling on crackers really. Thanks Gary, great mushroom recipe.

this is a good recipe, but holy cannolis does it have an insane amount of calories!!! ONE mushroom is almost the equivalent of a Mcdonalds Big Mac!! ONE MUSHROOM!  I tried to cut it down since only my husband and I were eating these, i made 8 msrms. I used only 4tbsps butter, 4 oz crm chse, 1C stuffing mix, chopped garlic and small onoin. along with spices, it came down to about 148 calories per serving! still quite a bit but at least i can eat 3 versus eating only 1!

415 calories in each mushroom?!?! The recipe says 12 mushrooms, 12 servings, and 415 calories per serving?!?! I hope this is a typo. They were excellent, but never will make again if that is true.

This was a good recipe, but very garlicy.  I cut the amount of melted butter in half, and was glad that I did.  I think the mushrooms I used were too big because they ended up being really watery.  I will definitely make this again, but next time use smaller mushrooms, and stuff them a little less.

This was excellent!!!  A few minor changes.  First - I never use imitation crab meat - blech.  Only real crab meat will do.  I sauteed the chopped mushroom stems and some garlic and then added to the stuffing mixture.  I also used green onion and mixed that into the stuffing mix.  Lastly, being from the east coast, crab ALWAYS has to go with Old Bay, so I sprinkled about 3 generous shakes into the mixture.  Oh - and I topped with a pinch of locotelli cheese.  Perfecto!

These were amazingly delicious.  I did however make some changes based on the reviews I'd read here.  Firstly,  there was enough filling to stuff a ton of jumbo mushrooms - well not a ton, but certainly more than 12.  Secondly, 2 cups of butter just seemed like way too much fat.  What I did was this. Make up the stuffing mix according to directions. Sauted the chopped up mushroom stems along with about 3 cloves of minced garlic and 1/2 an onion also minced in about 1/2 cup of melted butter.  Mixed up the stuffing, sauted vegetables, crab and cream chese.  Before stuffing the mushrooms we poached them lightly in some red wine and beef stock.  Stuffed them and cooked as directed here.  Very Yummy!

This is an excellent recipe.  So many reviewers said that they had way more stuffing than needed I bought 15 good sized white mushrooms and cut all other ingred in half.  I cut the butter to just 1 cube (1/2 cp) and I used the full amount of crab.    I didn't add garlic powder or salt but I did add the red pepper.  I love that little bite of the red pepper.   I still had some stuffing leftover even after piling it on the mushrooms.  My husband loved it so much he just sat and ate it without mushrooms.   In the 10-12 min baking time the mushrooms don't get cooked at all. I would like for them to be cooked a bit more so I'm going to work on that next time I make them.  Otherwise they are perfect

Great Recipe.
Instead of just crab, I used minced scallops, shrimp and clams that I cooked in the butter and garlic. I used only 2 sticks of butter and added 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice and white wine.I also prefer to use Herb stuffing rather than chicken. The cream cheese makes this recipe soo amazing.
 YUM YUM.

These were great, but I changed things up a bit. First of all, made as written, the taste of stuffing would be overwhelming. I should have cut the amount of stovetop down to half or 2/3 at least. Cut cream cheese in half and used three cans of chunk crabmeat, which I think was perfect. I only used the butter in the stovetop and to saute the garlic. Subbed chicken broth in the baking dish and sprayed some butter spray on the mushrooms before baking and it worked well without the extra fat. Thanks for a great base recipe!

Awesome recipe! I omitted most of the butter. I used the 4 tbsp called for in the stove top mix, and sauteed the garlic and stems in 4 tbsp of butter. I added the cream cheese and crabmeat to the sauteed ingredients, mixed them well, and added them to the suffing mix. from there I added half a can of chicken broth, then the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a little bit of thyme. Lastly, I shredded some monterrey jack to top it off. Instead of crushed red pepper, I just sprinkled a little cayenne pepper on top of the cheese and popped them in the oven. Turned out fabulous, will definitely make again!!!

LOVE these! I have had many different versions of stuffed mushrooms and find these to be THE best.  The crab meat, chicken stuffing with cream cheese make these fabulous.  I make the stuffing mix the night before my guests arrive I fill the mushrooms, saute the garlic and butter, drizzle and bake. If you have left over crab meat stuffing mix, it tastes amazing in chicken.  Just slice open a boneless chicken breast put in stuffing (bread if you like) and bake.  Yumm-O

I have been making these mushrooms every year to go with my Christmas standing rib roast.  I really mound up the stuffing on the mushrooms and they are delicious and a hit every single time.  I see how other reviewers write that there is too much butter.  I do make it as the recipe states and a lot of the butter runs down into the bottom of the pan just so the mushrooms kind of stay moist and soak up all that yummy garlic flavor...so what I am saying is you are not really EATING all that butter.  But hey, I make them for a special occasion so decadence every once in a while is a real treat!  I have always made them with the imitation crab as it states in the recipe, but this year I am trying lump crab meat.  I can't wait till Christmas...GREAT RECIPE!

These were delicious! My husband is still raving about them weeks later and he can't wait for me to make them again. I did use real crab-meat (2 cans) instead of the imitation. I also added some Worcestershire sauce, onions, and bell peppers. I diced onions and peppers and sauteed them with the garlic. I had bought 18 of the stuffing portabella mushrooms and still had a lot of the stuffing leftover. Oh and when you pull them out of the oven grate some fresh parmaesan over top. You have to have some cheese. I will definitely be making these again for our next get together!

The biggest perk to these stuffed mushrooms were how simple and quick the stuffing was, and how great the end result tasted! I used the 12 biggest baby portobellos I could find, and almost managed to use all of the stuffing. Gary's gotta have HUGE mushrooms, lol. The only major adjustments I made was that I cut WAY back on the butter, and only used one stick, and I used light cream cheese. To make sure that the 'shrooms didn't dry out while cooking, I drizzled a little EV olive oil on them before and after stuffing them. They came out perfect, and a whole lot lighter than the original 2 cups of butter would have been. I would have liked to use real crab, but sadly, here in Denver, even cheap-o, gross canned crab is pricey. :( But even with the imitation crab, these mushrooms were fabulous.

Wow!  I gave this recipe five stars; even though I needed to tweak it a bit for our taste, the base recipe was da bomb.  Like other reviewers, I used only half of the stuffing.  Even so, I still have leftover stuffing (NOT a problem, as it will get eaten!)  I did not use the amount of butter called for; I prepared the stuffing with the butter called for in its preparation instructions, then sauteed two pressed cloves of garlic and the chopped mushroom stems in about another tablespoon.  Since I do not like the texture of surimi (fake crab) I added one king crab leg's worth of crabmeat, shredded.  For seasoning, I used garlic powder, onion powder, Old Bay seasoning, and a touch of cayenne.  Also, 2 tablespoons of sherry (dry, not sweet) went into the mix; sherry tends to enhance the taste of the crab.  Sprinkled with parmesan and paprika, and baked for 15 minutes.  (My mushrooms were large.)  All in all, this is a great recipe with stellar results.  It is excellent for company as well as a special evening at home.

These were great, economical, easy stuffed mushrooms that everyone really enjoyed.  The cream cheese made these really rich, and because of the butter I opted to use 1/3 fat cream cheese, no loss there, especially not in taste.  I tripled the recipe because I was attending a party for 25, and I ended up with way too much stuffing, trust me I generously stuffed the mushrooms.  I also cut back the butter extensively, using only three sticks for my tripled recipe.  I think using what is called for would make these greasy, still a great stuffed mushroom recipe.

I have been making a similar recipe for years, only without the cream cheese or fresh garlic.  The other reviewers are right- there is no need for all that extra butter.  I did find the cream cheese an interesting addition, but it makes the final product mushier.  So it depends on your taste.  I think next time I would use 1/2 or 3/4 only of the cream cheese amount.  One big tip- use a combination of crab.  I go a little light on the liquid for the stuffing.  When it's done with the five minute rest, add a can of white crab meat with all of the liquid from the can.  Then add 1/2 pkg of chopped imitation crab (which is real fish).  This adds the texture and color of fresh, lump crab without paying 16.00 a pound.  You are already adding garlic powder to taste, there is no need to sauté garlic adding butter. Add your other ingredients and top with quality parmesan and it's great.  This stuffs about 3 packages of baby bella mushrooms.

This was delicious! I did make a change, I left off the mushrooms all together because I hate them, but instead, stuffed red bell peppers.. Oh my gosh! fabulous! My husband and I were fighting over who got to take the leftovers the next day for lunch!  also, 2 cups of melted garlic butter was waaay too much for doing 4 pepper halves.. 1 cup was MORE than plenty!  Thanks for the great tasting recipe.... oh, one last thing, we used canned Bumble Bee brand pink crab meat.  NOT imitation crab meat!!  2 cans was about 2/3 lb of crab meat but it turned out great!

This recipe was a huge hit! BUT very fattening. You do NOT need all the butter! I used half a stick. It was plenty.  Also I used less butter in the stuffing. Also it makes 24 large mushrooms with only 12 stems. I tried a lower fat version and cut the cream cheese in half. It was still awesome! So a half a stick if butter and a half a package of cream cheese and less butter in the stuffing and your waistline and your taste buds will thank you!!!

This recipe is not only as good as our favorite restaurant mushrooms, it's better!  As others have said, this amount of stuffing will make far more than a dozen--more like 40 or so.  I made 20 with half of it, and froze the rest to use later in the week.    I did make some minor adjustments.  Instead of using chicken flavored Stove Top, I used the Savory Herb variety (I didn't want any chicken flavor at all).  I sauted the chopped mushroom stems with the butter and the garlic, and I also added and sauted some chopped onion in the butter for extra flavor.  Finally, I used real crabmeat instead of imitation (the Bumble Bee canned premium white crabmeat is expensive at around $3.79 a can--and you need 2 cans, drained, to make 8 oz.--but it is sweet and delicate in flavor, and well worth the price).    Overall, best mushrooms I've ever had.

Loved this recipe! I needed to quadruple it for a birthday party we were attending.  I read some reviews and decided to make some changes.  I used 4 24oz packages of button mushrooms and doubled the filling.  I sauteed the stems in some butter and added a finely diced onion, minced garlic, salt and pepper.  I used 1.5 pounds of crab meat.  I mixed all the filling ingredients together and seasoned it with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes.  I filled a pastry bag with the stuffing and piped it into the mushroom caps.  I only used one stick of butter with the garlic to pour lightly over the top of the mushrooms.  I added just a little grated parm cheese to the tops and baked them for about 15 minutes (I really stuffed them full).  Even just doubling this recipe I had a ton of filling left over.  But it was so tasty, I didn't mind! I will make some crab stuffed chicken breasts for dinner tonight! Everyone raved about them and I will use this recipe from now on! Thanks!!

I used real crab and reduced the butter to one stick (4 Tbsp went in the stuffing, 4 got melted and drizzled over the mushrooms).  I also sauteed the reserved stems and garlic in the butter for the stuffing.  Next time I may pre-roast the mushroom caps (to cook them more thoroughly and reduce liquid).  The filling mixture is delicious!

This recipe is pretty good but I liked my variation better. Instead of using a whole package of stuffing for the recipe, I used 1/3 package. I also sauted the mushroom stems and garlic with onion and celery. It added a lot of needed flavor. I omitted the red pepper and crab meat. Before filling the mushrooms, I seasoned the inside which helps flavor the mushroom itself instead of just having flavorful filling. 5 minutes before the mushrooms are done, I added a pinch of fine shredded parmesan cheese to each mushroom. They turned out much better than the original recipe. The tender mushroom, creamy filling, and the thin crunch of the cheese made these wonderfully delicious and addicting. Perfect for entertaining!

SOOOO GOOD!!! These were the best stuffed mushrooms I've ever had. I brought them to a party and literally everyone wanted the recipe. I ended up using 40 oz. of mushrooms. I used chive and onion flavored cream cheese. I sauteed the stems in 2 tablespoons of butter with an onion and 3 cloves of garlic. I only used 1 cup of butter to drizzle over the top and I sprinkled an Italian blend of grated cheeses on top. I baked 20 - 25 minutes.

I chose this recipe after reading all the great reviews for it.  However, I have to say that this is the first recipe that has disapointed me on this website.  The stuffing was rather flavorless, and the mushrooms were not cooked enough.  They are definitely missing something and I would not make them again.

This is a great recipe except for the butter component.  There is simply TOO much.  After a lot of toying with it, they tasted best when each mushroom was brushed lightly with butter, as opposed to pouring it on.  In addition, I think you could easily skip the canned crab meat, as it is expensive and overwhelmed in the recipe.  Also, just one batch of the stuffing in this recipe generously filled up 65 mushrooms.... and fed a whole party!

I didn't care for these.  I thought they would be creamy and have a good crab flavor (I used real, canned crab).  They weren't creamy and there were rather bland (couldn't even taste the crab), even with drizzled butter and parmesan baked on top.  I won't be making them again.

The use of the stuffing mix makes this recipe quick, easy and wonderfully seasoned - perfect for a small New Years party.  I substituted 1/2 lb. of sausage for the 1/2 lb of crab and topped it w/ Parmesan.  Had enough filling to generously stuff 35 regular sized mushrooms with filling left over. They were the first of the appetizers to disappear  and then I found guests in the kitchen eating the left-over filling with spoons!

I made these for a New Year's Eve party and everyone liked them, (reason for 4 star rating), except me. They were fine, but nothing special. I guess I'm not a fan of Stove Top. The only change I made was to use real crab. I wished I had just used the imitation, as the original recipe called for. Using real crab was expensive, and you couldn't even taste it. Advice for others tempted to use the real stuff, as I won't be making them again!

I don't know why I haven't rated this before!  I have used this recipe so many times!  Everyone (even non-mushroom people) loves this.  I am asked to make it all the time, my husband gets offended if I do not make it for him when I am taking it to a party or something!  A couple things I must note: do not skimp on the butter, and when you are serving these, spoon the butter over them before plating them!!! mmmmmm! And I have tried other brands of stuffing and I think it doesn't work as well, so stick with the Stove Top.

I prepared this recipe for a staff thanksgiving meal at work.  I wasn't aware of a contest for best side dish, and I wasn't present during the actual meal.  Upon my return, I discovered the mushrooms had won 1st place!  Kudos, Gary, great recipe!

I tried the first time just as it said and it had way too much butter for my family! The next time I took the advice of other reviewers and used only one stick of butter and sauteed the mushroom stems with garlic and minced onions and mixed it with the stuffing mixture. As other people said it was way too much mixture for the mushrooms but it came out delicious! It is a great recipe, thank you for sharing!!!

As written, this is very good, but I did adjust the recipe slightly to make it perfect. (The 4 star review is for the original recipe.) 1) Halve the butter.  2 sticks? That's gotta be a mistake.  2) Sautee the mushroom stems with the garlic/butter.  3) I use white mushrooms.  They're small, so if you use them, buy two packs.  Use all the stems/caps, but only use a single recipe of the stuffing.  You won't be disappointed - this recipe is AMAZING.

It was okay, but not what I was looking for.  The stuffing mix was too prominent.  Needs more seafood flavor.

Had a lot of leftover stuffing. Definitely get extra mushrooms. I also agree that too much butter is used.  I used about half the amount requested and it came out fine

These are awesome, the only adjustment I made to this recipe is that I cut down on the butter. But it does make way more than can stuff into the mushrooms.....you can cut back on all the recipe ingredients or utilize the leftover stuffing and spread it on crackers.  Yum.

Over the years I have tried several different recipes for these things, and found this one to be just "OK".  They were a bit bland in flavor and were made exactly as prescribed.

Delicious!!  The stuffing is amazing and is wonderful with a meaty portobello mushroom top.  I didn't have any crab meat, so I made it without.  I can imagine it would be divine with the crab meat, too.  A+++ recipe.  You have to try this!

These were great! The best i've ever had in fact. The only thing wrong with the recipe is that you have so much stuffing mix left over. I doubled the amount of mushrooms to stuff. Worked out perfectly.

These were really good. Instead of the imitation crabmeat, I used bacon.  I also did not use as much butter.  Very tasty!

Very tasty.  Recipe needs to NOTE that mushroom stems need to be reserved.  Do not need as much melted butter as indicated.  Can absorb a lot of red pepper/black pepper/other seasonings successfully.  Will also make a good dip for crackers or celery, perhaps with a bit less stuffing mix.

I agree, Gary never proofread this because 2 sticks of butter is just crazy. I used sausage, scallions, cream cheese and stuffing, which made a tasty stuffing for 3 boxes of mushrooms. I put a pinch of fresh parm on top of each one, and drizzled a melted half stick of butter over the lot. Cook time was close to 30 minutes. EVERY time, they get top reviews from my quests!

My dad even ate the three leftover mushrooms that sat on the counter overnight the next morning, haha.  He said they were too good to let go to waste.  The hubby liked them as well, but next time I will add more garlic for his tastes :-)

I am so glad I decided to test this recipe before stuffing 50 mushrooms for my party tonight.  We were so disappointed after reading all the great reviews.  They just tasted like mushrooms with stove top stuffing on top.  Just boring.  I'll keep looking. Sorry :(

Absolutely wonderful! My dinner guests gobbled them up as quickly as they could!  I cut the recipe in half, and ended up still with enough stuffing to fill 36 small white button mushrooms.  I only used 1/4 cup of butter, mixed with 1/2 cup chicken broth, and they turned out great.

I browned a 1 lb. roll of hot breakfast sausage drained fat and melted in the cream cheese then stirred together with the box of stuffing mix that I made. I used 2 pkgs. of large mushrooms and I still had 1/2 bowl of mixture left. When I made them I thought I made too many but, that wasn't the case at all they were the first to go,everyone loved them.

Loved this.  I added the crab but couldn't taste it.  Next time I'll leave out.  Way too much stuffing for the amount of mushrooms.  Double the mushrooms and halve the dressing mixture.

I made these to use up a crate of mushrooms someone gave us. Since my family doesn't eat mushrooms and I couldn't eat 30+ by myself (in one sitting anyway) I gave them to neighbors. Everyone loved them and asks me to make them all the time. A very easy, VERY yummy recipe. Thanks for sharing it!!

These are absolutely wonderful. My kid begs me to make these. I used only 1C butter. I make double the mushrooms for the stuffing mix, & I still have left over mix. I think next time I'll add a lil bit of butter/seasonings to the inside of the mushroom cap before packing them.

I made this hosting my first Thanksgiving and it was delicious!  I should have scaled the amount of stuffing down because we used the smaller mushrooms, and half of it is sitting in our freezer waiting for another gathering.

Served these for my hubby's 50th birthday party this past weekend.  BIG hit!  I had to make a few changes...I used italian sausage instead of crabmeat due to allergies.  I also only used 1/4 cup of butter.  I even made them the night before and set them on a baking tray in the fridge until we were ready to cook them...will make again for sure!

These mushrooms were a huge success.  I've made them twice and the only thing is that I didn't use the 2 cups of butter but instead put a drizzle of butter over every stuffed mushroom.   Also this recipe makes alot of stuffing way more then the 12 mushrooms.  Even when they are large mushrooms but the stuffing mixture does freeze nice.   Also try baking them on the BBQ it adds a nice flavor.

This is the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever made! There are never any left and I am always asked to make them for any holiday or just a family dinner. The only thing I omit is red pepper and sometimes add parm. cheese on top for a change!

These are fantastic!  I did a little bit different.  Used Snow  Crab, and when diced up the mushroom stems, I sauteed with about a tablespoon of butter and garlic and added 1-2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. Then added to the stuffing mixture.  I halved the recipe and that stuffed 2 14 oz packages of stuffer mushrooms.   Which was more than enough for several people.
I also only used about 1/2 the butter to pour over them (for the halved recipe, that was only 1/2 cup).  And before putting in the oven, I sprinkled with fresh parmasean.  Yummy!! :)

I used large portabella mushrooms and scooped out some of the innards of the mushroom so there was plenty of room for all the stuffing.  (Next time I won't scoop out as much)  I only used 2 TBS of butter in the stuffing and only 2 TBS of butter with the garlic.  I added all the ingredients to the garlic butter to help it all meld together well.  Definitely add the pepper flakes to the top.  I also added a little bit of shredded parmesan.  A definite keeper.  I'm glad I didn't let the initial 2 cups of butter in the recipe scare me off.

Very good recipe!  It did make a lot of filling, but I was able to use it as a casserole.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these at Thanksgiving and they were a HUGE hit. I used way more than 12 mushrooms and they were piled high. They also took a good 25 min in the toaster oven. I think this one is going to be a new tradition!

Tasty! ...I chose a pack of turkey stuffing and didn't use it all in the mixture.

I made this for thanksgiving and Christmas this year and everyone loved them.  It's easier if you soften the cream cheese first by mixing it with an electric mixer and then add the rest of the ingredients.  I prefer to add the salt, pepper, and garlic powder into the mixture before it is stuffed into the mushrooms, still tasted good.  I used 24 small/ med mushrooms and had half still left over.

I did as others have suggested and cut down on the amount of stuffing (also used the cornbread variety) and precooked the mushrooms beforehand to cook out some of the water. This received raves at two parties I brought them to. I made these along with Dinah's Stuffed Mushrooms and these were, hands down, the winner. Do add the red pepper flakes it gives a nice little bite.

A hit! Made them without the lobster meat to save on time and money and they were still great. Coworkers and family loved them and they disappeared quickly.

I think Gary is a genius!  I followed the recipe, but added provolone in the last few minutes of baking.  I did have lots of extra stuffing - we made another 6 mushrooms because I had a few extra on-hand, and I still have leftover stuffing.  I just ate some on a plate with a slice of provolone.  I think I have a new after-Thanksgiving tradition.  Yummy "mushroom stuff"!

Made these Friday for my husband. Like to make a surprise for him on Fridays when he gets home from work. He ate two before he took his coat off. 1 reviewer was right when she said there was way too much filling. I bought two more packs of mushrooms to use my remaining filling. Did not need so much butter either. I put my onion and garlic in the food processor. I forgot the garlic was supposed to go in the butter. So I had garlic in the butter and in the fillng. I used canned crabmeat. Except for the extra mushrooms, I had everything I needed already in the house to make this wonderful recipe. Will make again. Thanks Gary

Very tasty! Used real crab meat in a can and did not use that much butter(used I can't believe it's not butter for a healthier dish) and it came out terrific! Thank you for the recipes.

Absolutely delicious.  My husband and I loved these.  The only thing I changed based off reviews was the butter.  I used what the box of stuffing recommended, and 3/4 cup total for the mushrooms themselves.

These were just OK...edible and everyone liked them, but nothing that made me say "Wow!" Basically, all I tasted was chicken stuffing. First off, the recipe makes way more stuffing than needed for 12 mushrooms unless they are the size of dinner plates and I'm pretty sure 2 cups of butter is a typo. I'll keep looking for a different recipe.

Do yourself a favor and use real crab and only about 2/3 of prepared stuffing mix.  Also added a dash of Old Bay seasoning. Yummy.

These mushrooms are outstanding.  I used 2 cans of crabmeat and sauteed a small diced onion with the crabmeat and mushroom stems.  I then added the cream cheese to the pan and melted it.  I poured the mixture over the prepared stuffing mix and it was delicious.  Everyone loved these and they're so easy to make.  Tastes very gourmet!

This recipe is super yummy! Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe.  I, too, found it made far more filling than I had mushrooms for, so buy big.  Or get a couple of portobello's and stuff them with the use the leftover to make a great meal!!

These are awesome! I put the extra stuffing in a dish, sprinkle on some parm cheese and bake to serve as a spread for crackers. I also leave out the butter except for the amount called for to make the stuffing mix and use chicken broth in the pan with the mushrooms instead of butter to cut calories.

Fabulous! I followed other reviewers' tips and reduced the butter to 1 cup and sauteed the chopped mushroom stems with the garlic. I used 1 can of canned crab meat because its what I had on hand. I also added Asiago cheese instead of parmesan because I didn't have any on hand. Finally, my batch of filling ended up making close to 30 med-large sized mushrooms.

I added a tablespoon of olive oil to my stuffing mix since it seemed a little dry.  After testing a mushroom with only the stuffing, I decided to place a thin slice of Monterrey Jack cheese before baking the mushrooms.   I didn't get to add the cooked garlic on top of the mushroom but did drizzle the olive oil.  That seemed to help with the baking process and prevent the mushrooms from drying out in the oven.   The stuffing was enough for about 20 large mushrooms.  Everyone loved these, it was an easy recipe to follow and I will definitely make again!

Great recipe!  I cut butter by 1/2 cup, did not add crabmeat (used stuffing from Turkey Butt - made with sausage) - fantastic!  Not that they need the calories or fat, but I'm going to try a little cheese on top next time.

Okay I liked these, I really did.  I did ease up a bit on a garlic because I'm not a huge fan, but these really were better than I was expecting.  My only problem is I have enough stuffing left over for at least 24 more mushrooms . I'm not sure what I'm going to do with all that... but I'd recommend just making half or even a 4th if you just have 12 mushrooms.  Thanks though.

These were AWESOME !!!! Will definitely make again and again !!!  I did make a few minor changes...I put the stems, garlic and added 1 good sized shallot in a food processor to chop, then added just enough butter to a pan to saute the stems, garlic and shallots.  I used a 6 oz. can of lump crab meat and a 6 oz. can of small shrimp. I also added some Mexican shredded cheese to the mixture. After I stuffed the caps, I used olive oil to drizzle over the tops instead of butter. The texture was perfect, I'm sure the stuffing was the key. And as in some other reviews...I agree that this does make quite a bit of stuffing, and if you run out of mushrooms like I did, I just rolled the rest into little balls (like meatballs) and bake them on a rack in a baking pan along with the stuffed mushrooms.  They were just as good !!!

When I read this recipe, I decided it should be the main course instead of an appetizer or side. I followed the recipe exactly and was given very positive comments. This is a large quantity of food. Be prepared to freeze leftovers.

These were really good (and all 50 of them got eaten.. and fast) but next time I will make a few changes. I would skip the butter, except in the stuffing prep. Then half the cream cheese and add some shaved fresh parmesan cheese (not the grated stuff) or even blue cheese in its place. Will definitely try these again!

These are fantastic.  After reading the other reviews, I sauteed mushroom stems, 1/2 cup onion, butter (1 stick) and then added the cream cheese and crab.  I used real crab instead of imitation.  I also sprinkledsome parmesan cheese on top.  There was a lot of stuffing left over.  This is a very easy delicious appetizer.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Incredible mushrooms!  Family loved them!  Changes made - only used 3/4 cups of butter (besides what was used to make the stuffing) and I melted the cream cheese in with the butter and garlic for easy mixing.  So yummy!  We did have alot of stuffing left over after making over 30 mushrooms, but we didn't mind.  Taking the suggestion of another person, we ate it on toast and it was SOOOO yummy!  Thank you!!

These were pretty good - I think I messed up on the stuffing prep though because they were a bit mushy in the middle.  Also, no one could even tast the crab so I would probably leave that out next time.  Maybe I'll try wrapping them in bacon.   I served them on Christmas Eve, then re-heated the leftovers on Christmas day, they were definitely better the second time so I think the longer they cook, the better.

Delicious!  Was the hit of the pot luck supper at church!  The only thing I changed was that I used less butter and stuffed more mushrooms.

WOW, delish! We left the crab meat out, cut the butter in half and added broth with the butter.  I double stuffed the 'shrooms, so I didn't have very much stuffing left over.

These were a huge hit for my football snacks.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception I didn't use 2 cups of butter, probably about 2/3 cup.

I am with the previous reviewer - the recipe must mean HUGE mushrooms if they only used 12!!! I had so much of the mixture left over that I now have 2 tupperware containers in the freezer. 
Other than that, the flavor was good. I used half butter and half chicken broth for the liquid in the pan. My boyfriend (picky eater) ate at least 8 of them!

These were ok.  I only used about 1/2 the butter called for and they were still swimming in it.  I used about 20 mushrooms and still had leftover stuffing.  I would just recommend taking it easy on the butter, especially if you're trying to serve it as finger food.  They get really messy with all the oil.

This recipe is the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had!!! It made a ton of mushrooms that were gobbled up. I only needed 1/2 the butter all together. It did make way more stuffing than I needed, so I stuffed a couple portabella mushrooms and we ate them as an entree then I froze the rest for another event. The filling kept well in the freezer and tasted great when thawed.

Good! I used sausage instead of crab. Also, instead of 2 cups of butter, I only used 1/2 cup. and just mixed it into the stuffing, along with the red pepper flakes and pepper.  I made the stuffing in advance to save time.

My family is crazy for stuffed mushrooms, but I have to mix it up...I can't always use the same recipe.  This is one of their favorites with one exception...I don't use the crabmeat.  We're not big fans of imitation and when I tried it with lump crabmeat, no one really liked the combo.  Without the crab, however, they are awesome.

I used real crab meat for this.  First of all, there was way too much stuffing for the mushrooms.  They were very greasy. I just finished eating some and they made me sick. They did not taste good. There is too much breading. It tastes like one of those crab cakes that have tons of stuffing with a little crab taste. You could taste the crab meat but you could taste the stuffing more. I will not attempt to make this again.

Oh my goodness ... are these little guys SPECTACULAR! I made them for our Memorial Day cook-out and they were a huge hit! I substituted 2 (4.5 oz each) cans of crab for the 8 oz. imitation crabmeat, since that's what I had on hand. While they were baking, we and our guests were salivating waiting for them to come out of the oven! We love to get crab-stuffed mushroom appetizers at our favorite restaurant and these are so much better. They were still great reheated the next day.

I was trying to decide between this recipe and another stuffed mushroom recipe, and I'M SO GLAD I WENT WITH THIS ONE!!!!!   I used real crab and not imitation (I hate imitation crab).  The stuffing made ALL the difference, and it was not too crabby for my taste.  I made this for a potluck and my indifferent boyfriend ate TWO mushrooms.  I used smaller portabella mushrooms, and did have to cut down the butter - I ended up using about 3/4 cup of butter and 1 clove of garlic.  I can't WAIT til my lunch (leftover mushroom) today.....Gary, you're my hero!

What a fantastic recipe.  I made it for New Years Eve and it was the last thing I needed to make for ourselves and company.  I did it while our guests were arriving and couldn't beleive how quick everything is put together and in the oven.  I had to hide a couple because they were going so fast!!!

The basic idea of this recipe sound great. But, I think often there is a misconception that 2 cups of butter is the same as 2 cubes of butter. NO. A pound is 2 cups! I couldn't see any reason to use an entire pound of butter in this since there is already butter in the stuffing mix when prepared. 

I have done the unthinkable and altered the original but it works for us. I used half the butter, half the cream cheese, half the stuffing mix and the body meat from 2 large crabs. We were serving the legs and claws separately for a party.

I did precook the mushrooms a bit so they would be done. I was using Portobello mushrooms and they were pretty large. I didn't want them raw. 

The result was good. I may do more tweaking in my next try, mostly to get a bit more flavor. I am thinking that a shredding of cheddar goes well with all the mild flavors and would have been nice on the tops. 

Apologies to the original poster. I know how crummy it can be to see people change what you love as is. It was just that danged pound of butter that got to me.

After I made the changes I give it 4 Stars...First off I cut the cream cheese in half, I used reduced fat Or  Light   then I only used 2 TBSP of butter, 2 cups  almost gave me arteriosclerosis reading the recipe.    I moistened the stuffing mix with chicken stock & 1 TBSP of the butter.  I also dipped the tops of the mushrooms in Italian seasoned bread crumbs and sprinkled about 2-3 TBSP of Parmesan cheese over b4 baking I also used 3 TBSP chicken stock and  3 TBSP white wine poured into the bottom of the pan to eliminate drying of the mushroom caps.  Any time a recipe calls for 2 CUPS of butter.. Most of it MUST be Eliminated... Don't get me wrong butter is tasty but 2 cups is just to much. FOR ANYONE

This recipe calls for 12 large mushrooms. What it really means is 12 jumbo bowl size mushrooms for the ingredient sizes to make sense. I bought 24 large mushrooms, so naturally, I doubled the ingredients. I ended up with a huge mixing bowl full of the filling left over. The actual filling is quite delicious, but if you want to make a normal restaurant bite sized mushroom, the amount of ingredients can probably be cut in half, maybe even by 1/3. You definitely don't need 2 whole cups of butter to just drizzle over your mushrooms, unless you want them swimming in butter. Otherwise, the actual mushrooms taste great, I just wish I didn't waste so much money on all of the ingredients. I eventually just threw the left over filling away because I didn't have time to go out and buy more mushrooms.

It was excellent.  I put the red pepper in my spice grinder which helped to distribute the pepper a little better.  Also noted it made too much stuffing.  I made 25 baby portabella's and still had more stuffing left.  Next time I will reduce the stuffing.

We've tried this a couple of times using less butter also. One add ingredient that we tried was to add Swiss or Monterey cheese melted on top of each mushroom just before their done and they are extremely good!

Great recipe! I make it anytime I have a family gathering and it is always a favorite. The stuff makes way more then 12 mushrooms (if using the small ones) so I always buy 2 or 3 extra packs to make the most of it. I'm so glad I came across this recipe. It will be used for many many years to come!

This is a wonderful recipe that I tweaked because of the amount of butter.  I used lo-fat cream cheese, one cup of Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix prepared with butter and water, added the spices but also Montreal Steak Seasoning in lieu of the red pepper, then added only about 1+ tablespoon of butter on top dripping it over the mushrooms with a teaspoon.  For moisture on the bottom I added a half cup of white wine.   They were wonderful.  Two cups of butter sounds over-the-top regardless of the taste.

First try and it was great. A little tweaking is in order though. 2 cups butter is a waist. 1/4 cup will be plenty to drizzle with.  Half the stuffing or double the crab and fill 24 caps.  Love it, thanks for sharing

These mushrooms are delicious!  I did make a few adjustments.   First, I cut the butter in half and will probably cut in half again.  Like others, I sauteed the mushroom stems in with th butter and garlic.  I then added the cream cheese in with the butter mixture.  It melted nicely.  Overall, a fantastic recipe.

Doubled the recipe. It the only items I doubled were the mushrooms, crab and  garlic.  I had the perfect amount of filling.  I placed them in a metal pan and baked half way without the butter.  I froze them for a week.   Once I was ready to bake again I drizzled the butter only 1/4 C and garlic over them.  Showstopper.

They were delicious, but I don't see the need for 2 cups of butter. We didn't use all 2 cups of butter. Next time, we're going to go with 3 or 4 tbsps. instead.

I made these the other night just as the recipe is written. These were absolutely wonderful... I'd give them 10 stars! My sons and their friends couldn't get enough of them. The recipe made about twice as much stuffing as I needed, though. The leftover stuffing would be delicious stuffed in fish.

Awesome recipe. Makes enough butter (way too much actually) to drizzle and enough stuffing for 24-30 good-sized mushrooms. I used less than the whole box of chicken stuffing too. I only made 13 shrooms, so I froze the other half of the butter/garlic drizzle and crab mix. Also, a 1/2 lb of crab claw meat only cost $7 and I'm glad I used that and not imitation!

Didn't work the first time, there was way too much 'sauce' they were cooking in. So I think I just need to try again, because the ingredients were delicious, just the cooking method was a little off for me.

I just finished making these to taste test and see if they would be good for thanksgiving dinner, and well i can say i followed the recipe minus the amount of butter 1 cup was plenty, My family LOVED them and they are all picky when it come to mushrooms, even my husband and he asked me to make sure they are part of our thanksgiving menu. So 5 stars are well deserved and i will make these many more times :)

they were good but not what i was looking for. the stuffing mixed with the cream cheese great idea, but the cream cheese was to rich for me and my husband. i will try again with another cheese maybe riccota or jack or mozza.

phenomenal. we added gorgonzola and some red wine redux to the mix just because we had it on hand. loved the idea of using the cubed stuffing as opposed to finer bread crumbs. cream cheese was a great idea as well! we served the hearty portabellos over couscous.

Simply amazing! I hate mushrooms but my husband loves them. This recipe looked good compared to some of the others and it by far has changed my mind about mushrooms. The only problem is this makes WAY MORE than for 12 mushrooms. We've been eating the left over stuffing for 2 days for lunch we had so much left over but it still tastes good without being stuffed in the mushrooms.

Pretty easy and very delicious!  I used a box of cornbread stuffing mix because I didn't have any chicken mix, and I used one 6oz can of real crab meat.  They were so good, they were the first appetizer to disappear at Thanksgiving dinner.  But, when I baked them, they didn't seem to be getting brown enough on the top after 10-12 minutes at 350, so I wound up setting the broiler at low heat and just watched them until they were brown enough for us.  If you want good stuffed mushrooms fast I definitely recommend this recipe!

I made these without the crab meat, because I didn’t have any.  Other than the butter called for in the stuffing, I brushed the outside of the mushrooms with butter and drizzled some on top before baking.  I cannot imagine using two full cups – YIKES!  I filled the caps with a little of the stuffing to fill in the hole and then used my cookie scoop to mound it on top.  I also baked mine in a muffin tin so they would roll or slide around.  We loved these made the way I made them, but three stars for the 2 cups of butter indicated.  I wonder if it should read 2 tablespoons – that would be more like it.

These were great but made too much so I would recommend getting more then 12 mushrooms.  I really stuffed the mushrooms with filling too, more than the picture.

I made these to bring to a party and everyone loved them. I made them with no changes except I used small mushrooms so they'd be easy to pick up, etc... they were delicious. Thank you for sharing this~my "new" favorite Stuffed Mushroom recipe. A keeper for sure!

Absolutely to die for! I doubled the recipe, but not the butter. I then poured the butter, garlic, onion and chopped stems into the stuffing mix and added water to soften it. Topped with Parmesan cheese.

These are great and were a big hit at our wine tasting! Only thing I changed was adding 1/2 an onion to the butter/garlic, and then put that in with the stuffing/crabmeat/cheese mixture...saving some for drizzling. I also omit the red pepper flakes, but do sprinkle with parm cheese before baking! One more thing, this makes alot of "stuffing"...I stuffed 18 big mushrooms and froze the remaining stuffing mixture in a ziploc for next time!

A delicious recipe that was rather simple to make.  Using the amounts specified though, I had a lot of excess stuffing and butter.  It also took a little longer to fully cook.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe and definitely one I would suggest trying.

I halved this and it was just enough for 12 mushrooms.  Also used way less butter.  Was good, but next time I would use slightly less stuffing and cream cheese and more crab.

This was amazing! I always love the stuffed mushrooms from Red Lobster and these are soooo close to them. This does make alot of filling so I lined a 9x13 pan with the mushrooms and then spread the filling all over the top . As if these weren't fattening enough, I made a simple Lemon Cream Sauce with 2T butter melted in a skillet add 2T flour and let that cook down for about a minute, I added heavy cream and milk (approximately 3/4 cup each) 1 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese. Salt to taste. Let simmer until semi thick, remove from heat and add juice from 1 lemon. I poured this sauce over the mushrooms and topped with mozzerella cheese. FABULOUS! Thanks for sharing this recipe, it is so worth making and no wonder you recieved the highest reviews!

I have made these mushrooms 1/2 dozen times and the are always a huge hit!! Afraid by all of the butter I used one stick of butter and then a cup of white wine, and sauteing plenty if garlic, I also leave out the crushed red pepper, perfect for parties and special events( I made 2-3 packages of small mushrooms and freeze the other half, freezes well ) :)

Made these for a party - everyone really enjoyed them (while they were warm).  Don't let them get cold - set them out in shifts, keeping some warm in the oven.

Amazing!!!! The filling is delicious.  I had 16 mushrooms and a ton of filling left over.  I think I'll try stuffing it in some baked chicken tomorrow.  Will definitely keep this recipe.

Made this according to ingredients listed.  They turned out perfect. Great subtle taste without anyone ingredient over powering the other.  Made this for my son's 25th birthday and everyone loved them. Was asked by everyone at the party for the recipe.  We will be making this again for Super Bowl Party!

I thought these really lacked in flavor. The amount of stuffing this made was WAY too much for 12 mushrooms, probably could have made 48. 2 cups of butter for 12 mushrooms seems a bit crazy. They didn't taste bad, they really just didn't taste like anything more then chicken flavored stuffing. Not what I expected from all of the great reviews.

Spectacular!!  Made these for the first time on New Years Eve.  I don't do crab so substituted 8 oz of Bob Evans Sage Sausage.  Baked them longer than 12 minutes to get a nice crust on them.  Huge hit with the guests.  I did have a lot of stuffing left over so bought more mushrooms the next day and made more!  Absolutely yummy - will make for every party in the future.

Very big hit at my New Years Party.  I agree with other reviewers about the butter being way too much.  I used one stick for about 24 mushrooms.  Also this recipe made a huge amount of filling.  I could have filled another 24 mushrooms. I added a bit of chopped onion to the mix.

Wonderful, Wonderful! I made thgis recipe to take to my Dad's for Christmas dinner, it went perfect with the lasagna! Everyone loved them, I can't wait to make them again! The only thing I did different is that I only used 1 cup of butter and I used garlic powder instead of the real thing (due to the lack of stovetop space that day!) After stuffing a 9X13, I just topped off the whole casserole dish wit the remaining stuffing -it was like a casserole! But it was sooo good! Loved it!

I made these for my family for Christmas "dinner" and they loved them.  I used fresh crab, which you could really taste.  I didn't use all the butter, but ended up spooning about a tablespoon over each mushroom before baking.  I did bake them longer than indicated, because they seemed soggy at 12 minutes and I wanted them to crisp up a little on top.  I tripled the amount of mushrooms called for and still ended up with a cup of stuffing left over, and I really stuffed the mushrooms, so my sister and her husband are going to use the extra to make stuffed chicken breasts!

These were really good!!  I did make some changes for what I had: I used ground sausage instead of crab and only a few Tbs of butter.  Also added minced garlic and onion to the sausage.  Added 1/2 C of mozzarella and 1/2 C of parmesan in place of the cream cheese.  These were a hit on Christmas!!

soooo good....I filled at least 40 mushrooms with that stuffing recipe....Gary must have been filling Portobellos or something.  Super yummy....I even made them with vegan cream cheese because I have a dairy allergy...no one knew the difference and everyone loved them.  Next time I'll probably leave out the crab because I had some picky guests and you couldn't really taste it anyway.

Cousin Gary has a winner!  I never use imitation crab so I used lump crab meat (yum!) and as a variation I substituted Italian sausage (browned and crumbled) for the crab...WOW!  Amazing!  Everyone loves them...even two family members who say they HATE mushrooms!

I made some major modifications to the recipe according to other reviewers. I sauteed the stems and onion some butter (not the huge amount called for!) then mixed in everything else. I then stuffed the mushrooms with the mixture and didn't pour any extra butter over. The mushrooms were done in about 25 minutes, but the stuffing never got crunchy. The flavor was pretty good, but I wish the texture had been different.

It's not the best stuffed mushrooms recipe on this site but it's pretty good. As many reviewers have said, the proportions in this recipe can stuff a whole lot more than 12 large mushrooms.

This is the first time I made stuffed mushrooms and found it to be very easy and very good.  This recipe makes too much stuffing - I made 25 small mushrooms and have enough left over to make about 15 more!  I used real crab meat and only 3 sticks of butter and the mushrooms cooked perfect - not too wet - I think two sticks would be plenty.

The stuffing amount is WAY too much for the number of mushrooms.  I would say you could use 12 portabello mushrooms and be good.  Other than that, I think there's way too much butter and the cream cheese and chicken flavored stuffing mix drowns out the taste of the crab (I used real crab).  Next time I would decrease those amounts, by at least a third, and maybe add some minced onion, white wine, and Old Bay seasoning.

I made this for my DH's 30th birthday and it was a hit!  I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and I found that I had more than enough stuffing and garlic butter.  The stuffing is so rich that I may use less next time so that the mushroom can come through more.  I had lots of extra garlic butter and I may opt to leave it out next time and just lightly oil the caps before going into the oven.  I had a spare lemon around so I squeezed the juice over top before serving... it added a little something something extra.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these for Easter Brunch.  They were a huge hit.  Everyone loved them including my mom and sister, whom both don't like mushrooms.  I will save this recipe and will be making again.  I used pork sausage instead of the crab meat.  Next time I will not use as much butter.  i felt it was too much and didn't use all of it. Great recipe!

These were awesome.  I made two batches.  One, I substituted cooked sage sausage for the crab.  Took them to a superbowl party and they got rave reviews.

Was great. I added one yellow onion, 5 garlic cloves and sauted them in butter with the mushroom steams. Spiced up the mix with some cajun spice. used 6 oz real crab and 12 0z imitation crab. worked great, had to cook for 25 min. then topped with cheese, was not dry and plenty of flavor.

really easy and very tasty. these were pretty much grabbed off the baking tray before i could even plate them.  I did make one change I used up some leftover rotisserie chicken (shredded) in place of the crabmeat.

What a great recipe! This is definitely restaurant-quality. Have made these many times, they always turn out great. I do use less butter...... also add shredded mozarella cheese to the top.

I have made this recipe for Xmas dinner for several years and it has always been a big hit. We aren't real big on crab meat, so I use cooked Hot Italian Sausage instead. It gives it a nice kick and works very well with this recipe! Top with little freshly grated Parmesan for a  nice finish. Get extra mushrooms because the meat/cream mixture makes more stuffed mushrooms than stated in the recipe.

This recipe was definitely not a hit at my house.  I was told that the stuffing mix definitely overpowered the crab to the point that the crab may as well not even be in the recipe, and that it tasted too much like Thanksgiving stuffing.  Definitely not what I had expected.

Great recipe, although I must admit I accidentally didn't follow the instructions properly.  I had read that people said there was too much butter so I sauteed only 1/2c butter, the garlic, stems, and half an onion, then added it to the stuffing, cream cheese, and crab mixture.   They were such a big hit at a recent party that I am going to jot down my accidental revisions and keep this one!

What an awesome recipe!  The smells of this cooking was quite a welcome to my guests. The guest of honor said that he had never tasted a better stuffed mushroom even better than our best steak house!  I did use 2 cans of real crab in place of the immitation.  I also made the stuffing the day before to let the flavors blend.  Enough filling for 25-30 mushrooms.

DELICIOUS!  Way too much butter though...1 cup is plenty..and you can stuff close to 18 mushrooms (not just the 12) with the amount of stuffing it makes. ***You WILL be asked for the recipe by your guests!!

These stuffed mushrooms turned out amazing!!! I read some of the reviews and altered the recipe slightly to what others had to say. I made 25 regular stuffed mushrooms (they were the largest gourmet mushrooms I could find at the time). I used real crad instead of the imitation crab. And I cooked them for 25 minutes in the oven, instead of 12 minutes. They turned out amazing!!! Everyone enjoyed them at my dinner, they were the first to go!

I made these with ground sausage and herb stuffing, and some shredded cheese on top... SO GOOD!  My grandma happened to stop by and tried them, and said they tasted like they were from her favorite Italian restaurant.  I'm using the leftover stuffing in some chicken breasts today, I can't wait.  The stuffing mix tasted even better after sitting in the refrigerator overnight.  By the way, I used just enough melted butter to lightly drizzle- maybe 1/2 cup for my 16 mushrooms.

I don't like mushrooms myself but my husband loves them. He said he felt like he was in heaven. In the past he always felt like stuffed mushrooms was for special occasions but, these were so simple to make that I will make them for him more often.

These were okay; a little bland and needed something to add a little zing.  The cream cheese was almost over powering.  Had way too much stuffing for the mushrooms called for.  Could have made sever dozen more with what I had left over.  May make again but with some modifications.

I thought these mushrooms were very boring. They tasted just like stuffing plopped on top of a mushroom. I have made other recipes for stuffed mushrooms that have much more flavor and will not make these again.

Best stuffed mushroom recipe I'm tried in a while.  Tons of mix left over (I used smaller mushrooms).  I ended up stuffing about 50 mushrooms to use all the mixture.  They were a big hit!

These are AMAZING!  They are a very easy and affordable yet elegant and delicious appetizer to make.  I generously stuffed 24 button mushrooms, and could have done 10-15 more.  So unless your shrooms are gigantic...buy more!  Besides, they are so delicious 12 wouldn't be enough anyway.  I did cut the butter to 1 cup.  I also did not have crushed red pepper, so I sprinkled louisianna hot sauce on to of them before baking.  It gave them a nice little splash of color as well.  I dressed them up with the parsley flakes at the end.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Wonderful and so easy. I agree with the others about needing more mushrooms to stuff. Very glad I tried them.

Loved this!  Took these to a family Thanksgiving where about 20 families bring different dishes.  Mine was gone first and everyone wanted the recipe!  You will have a lot of stuffing mix left, I read the reviews and purchased 3 packs of fresh mushrooms and still had stuffing left over.  Also, I used about three fourths of the liquid (used chicken stock) called for in the stuffing recipe and white wine for the remainder of the liquid for stuffing.

Super yummy!

These were the hit of the party.  They were delicious!!!!! Lick the pan-good.  I had enough stuffing to stuff about 30 mushrooms, and they were the first to go. Best ever!

These were great! we used fairly large size mushrooms and only a little more than 1 cup of butter. Next time I make these the only change I will make will be to add a little chopped green onion to the mixture.

Very delicious and easy to make.  This is always a big hit at pot-lucks.  There is quite a bit of stuffing left over if you follow the recipe, but it is also great in bell peppers or large portabello mushrooms.

These were a big hit at my luncheon.  However, I must not have understood what was meant by large mushrooms.  I had a lot of stuffing left over.  I'm going to use it to stuff chicken tomorrow for dinner (got the idea from another reviewer.)  Also, used one cup of butter and not two.  It was plenty.

These were good, but the flavors were almost overpowering. I LOVE the taste of mushrooms but the stuffing and spices take away from it. Also, I wouldn't add the red pepper next time - it threw off the flavors. My boyfriend, on the other hand, thought they were perfect and liked them with red pepper. He ate about 12 of them (I made lots.) They are REALLY easy to make and fun to eat. I would make them again but leave out the red pepper, cut down on the garlic and maybe add more cream cheese and less stuffing so the spice isn't so overwhelming.

I have made these twice for parties and now everyone requests it. The only things I do differently is omit the chopped mushroom stems from the stuffing. (I save them for spaghetti sauce.) And instead of imitation crabmeat, I use 1 or 2 cans of REAL lump crabmeat. The 1st time I made these, I stuffed 85 mushrooms and they were all gone in 10 minutes. The 2nd time, I stuffed 120 mushrooms and they lasted a little bit longer! If you do not like mushrooms, put some of the stuffing mixture into chicken breasts or top some haddock or tilapia with it and bake for 12 minutes. Soooo delicious!!! Thanks to Gary for a fantastic recipe!

Great recipe and very easy to make!!!! I am trying to watch the fat in my dinners, and made this low fat.  I subsituted the cream cheese for fat free cream cheese, and used very little butter to put on top of the mushrooms.   I also used portebello mushrooms and low sodium stuffing.  This was still delicious!!!

These are ok but not the best I've ever had.The stuffing,to me, is a bit over powering.If you love the stuffing flavor more than the mushroom it would be your recipe.As far as the crab I couldn't really taste it in there.I'll be tweaking this recipe,maybe only using half of the stuffing seasoning pack.

This is a great recipe, my husband requests them practically every week.  I once used real crabmeat (canned), thinking it would improve the recipe, but the stuffing was actually mushier that way, so stick with the imitation crab.  This is a great appetizer, but I think one day I will try it with portobello mushrooms as a main course.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I always make this for get togethers and it is always a hit.  My husband hates mushrooms, so I have also used this stuffing for in stuffed chicken.  He loved it!  Great Recipe!  And my husband said he would never eat stovetop stuffing.

I was a little skeptical about all the cream cheese and it did turn out to be a little overwhelming to me.  I cut the butter in half.  The next time I may cut out some of the cream cheese as well.  My husband loved them though.  He ate the rest of the stuffing mixture with the scoops tortilla chips.  My 4 year-old liked them too.

This was my first attempt at making stuffed mushrooms and they were delicious! I also had way too much butter and a lot of extra stuffing left over.  Next time I will only use 1 stick of butter.  I took the left over stuffing mix and split bonelss skinless chicken breast and stuffed them with the mixture, baked them and it was DELICIOUS! Try it!

I made these for Christmas Eve and EVERY single person just LOVED them.  Every woman asked for the recipe and even the kids liked them.  They were gone in a flash.  I doubled the recipe and didn't have enough.  I strongly advise you to at least double, if not triple, this recipe.

Great taste! With all the reviews about lots of xtra stuffing left over,  took time to scrape out the mushrooms' "inners," left room for more stuffing. Plus added 1 can bioling chicken broth as I thought the stuffing was too thick. They were gone the minute I placed them on the table!

Made this as a Thanksgiving appetizer and everyone loved it!  I wanted it to be bite size, so I cut the actual recipe in half and substituted the large mushrooms with a pound of regular white button mushrooms.  Will do this again!

Excellent! Next time I think we'll use sausage and less butter.
Christmas 2006. We used sausage this time and sliced some green onions into the butter. As always, they were awesome.

Delicious and easy.  There was a lot left after stuffing over 2 dozen mushrooms, but I just sprinkled with parmesan cheese, baked it in a casserole dish and served with crackers.  Mmmmmm.  This one is a winner.  Thank you!!

Highly addictive! I followed the recipe exactly. Had to cook them a little longer than called for(could be oven difference). I'm not a very experienced cook, but these were simple and delicious! Had leftover stuffing even though I used 1 large, and 1 small carton of regular sized mushrooms. Tried using 1/2 the butter for drizzling, but ended up using what the recipe called for to begin with. My friends kept coming back for more, and will be making this themselves. Highly reccomended! (accidently put 2 stars instead of 5, can't seem to get it changed!)

This recipe was so easy and really good.  However, I would really recommend using about 1/3rd the amount of butter.  I also used light cream cheese.  They are really delicious but look a bit boring.  I would garnish with parsley or green onion for some color.

This recipe was very good, and so simple. I used very little butter to drizzle and I sprinkled the top with mozzarella cheese.  I also made an alternative recipe for my friends who do not eat seafood. I substituted the crabmeat with italian turkey sausage that I removed from casing and  browned with a little onion.  Both were equally good I couldn't make up my mind!!!!!

I hate to say it.  I did not like this one.  They were very greasy and had a strong taste of fake crab.  I think using real crab might help and cut down on the butter. However, I do not think I will even attempt this again.

Used this recipe for a wedding reception recently.  Everyone loved them.  Fancy, yet simple.  I don't like crab meat, but even I ate 3 of these.  Had mounds of stuffing and garlic butter drizzle left over, and we even cut the butter down by 3 cups.

These were great! The stuffing made about 40 mushrooms. It probably could have made more but after i was done stuffing them i was eating the stuffing out of the bowl:) It wasn't too crabby either. This is a great and simple recipe. I am making them again the next chance i get. Great appetizer.

My dad makes these all the time and I could not remember how to make them myself without asking him, this recipe was very helpful, though I will say that using just garlic powder instead of minced worked just as well, and instead of using cream cheese, I just used clam chowder, also adding parmesan cheese to the stuffing mix as well as on top really brought it all together. It was exactly as my dad makes it, perfect results, 100% would recommend this recipe to anyone else. Definitely get more than 12 mushrooms though, even with the large ones you'll still have much of the stuffing mix left over, which you can just go get more mushrooms and do it again.

I didn't have chicken-stuffing so I used Ritz crackers and chicken stock.  I used real crab (from Costco) and topped with gruyere cheese.  I baked with the tray at an angle to avoid soggy 'shrooms and they came out great.  These are a  real crowd-pleaser that I'll make it again for sure!

Yummy. I didn't have crab meat, so omitted. Also, it was summer & didn't want to heat the house with the oven, so tried this on the grill. Used 2-3 layers of heavy foil for a baking "sheet." Grilling time varied on heat & how full it was (longer time open to load). I did rearrange once or twice for more even cooking. Worked great!

Easy to make.  Nice thing to do with Portabella mushrooms.  I did not have any cream cheese so used parmesan instead - may not have been as creamy but probably fewer calories :-).  Prepared some of the filling without (imitation) crab for my two vegetarian daughters, then put crab in the rest.  Most of all I loved that it was so easy - and so much fancier than plain old sauteed mushrooms.

I substitute Italian sausage for the crab meat, and make sure to cook the mushroom stems in garlic and butter with herbs before adding into the cream cheese mixture.  Also, I use baby bellas so there are more to go around. GREAT appetizer for Thanksgiving and Christmas!
You can always sub Lite Cream Cheese and use reduced sodium ingredients if you're looking to save a few calories... ;-)

I enjoyed this recipe quite a bit.  I didn't change anything about it other than adjusting the measurements down for a smaller batch and using bigger mushrooms.  What I like best about this recipe is its versatility.  I will definitely be using it again.

GREAT stuffed mushrooms. I changed a few things, only because of what I had on hand at the time. I used sausage instead of crab meat (which I will try) and I used a big hand full of panko bread crumbs that I soaked in a little white wine vs stuffing. They came out delicious and will make these for years to come. Thanks for sharing!

Very good flavor. This makes a ton! I have ended up freezing about half the stuffing to use at another time. Freezes great so the next time all you need are more mushrooms and you are set!

I've been making these for years. I skip the mushroom stems and use about 4 packages of regular mushrooms instead of the stuffing mushrooms. The stuffing mix is plenty to fill all these mushrooms. I use about a cup butter which is enough . I use  a 6 oz can of white crabmeat. It is always a hit at parties.

I used crab meat claws and chunks and only about half the stuffing mix (moistened only, not prepared). Excellent and will definitely make it again.

Made for Christmas appetizer.  Followed advice of other reviewers and pre-roasted mushrooms in a little butter.  Also sauteed mushroom stems, scallions, and garlic in a little butter  before mixing with stuffing.  I don't recommend imitation crabmeat because of the texture and taste, but canned variety should yield better results.  Next time!  Skipped the garlic powder because I used garlic paste instead--next time will add garlic powder, too.  More onion flavor would have been good, so I advise a Savory Herb stuffing instead of a chicken flavor. Old Bay might be good in these.  All in all, they were good though.  Some chive cream cheese instead of plain would have boosted the taste even more.  Tons of stuffing left over so will be making more 'shrooms  with my proposed changes--for New Year's Eve!

These are so creamy, delicious and fairly easy to make. Put in a lot of filling, and make sure to cook the mushrooms for 10-15 mins, until fully cooked. Undercooked does not taste good, and is slightly crunchy.

I could not, in good conscience, use all that butter!  I reduced the butter down to a 1/4 cup and I used reduced fat cream cheese.  My boyfriend and I both loved them!

I have made these multiple times and they are always a hit!  The first time I make a recipe, I always follow the directions exactly with no changes.  That gives me an idea of what direction I want to take on it the next time. Now the only change I make is to use canned crab instead of imitation.  It is amazing!!! Worth the calories.

My only complaint is the stuffing falls out easily but I'm sure there's something I could do to prevent that, probably by using bigger mushrooms. I have alot of the filling left over so I'll have to get more mushrooms. I doubled the recipe and put the garlic powder and red pepper in the garlic butter instead of directly on the mushrooms which gave them alot more flavor, overall a good recipe now to see how my husband's coworkers like them.

I never made stuffed mushrooms before but wanted a classy snack for our New Years night in. These were AmAzInG...Super easy, minimal ingredients and totally worth it.

These are probably my favorite food in the entire world. I'm not going to lie, with such a simple name and simple ingredients I was skeptical, but wow... People go absolutely crazy over these, I've actually been kicked out of my stepdads house for eating the last one. He was maaad (and he hates mushrooms). I think they're amazing as-is, but after making them so many times (wonder if that's where this tummy came from?? Lol), I tweak them a little to my liking (I can't remember the exact recipe and can't see it as I type, so if anything is from the recipe, oops. Going by memory.) I like crab so I add 1 can of real lump or "fancy" crab meat (now that I think of it, I've never used imitation in these and wouldn't recommend it. Ew), then add either another half can or add the shredded meat of 1 or 2 clusters of cooked crab legs. I reduce the liquid when I cook the stuffing to a little under a cup, because I like the stuffing to be a little drier since it will moisten when cooking. I also cut up about 6-12 shrimp into small pieces, I really like the added texture and flavor. It seems to give it more substance. (I use very imprecise measurements, because I know I like very rich foods. Adjust to your preference). I drizzle them in butter then sprinkle garlic salt over them. When they're done I put a little slice of Monterey Jack on each of them and return them to the oven until melted. God, they're good. Very rich, but sooo good. They never last and are constantly requested

Great recipe, although next time I will try real crab meat instead of imitation. I think it would make it a five star recipe for me instead of four.

I found this recipe 2 years ago, and I have made them for Christmas and Thanksgiving since and they have been a hit!! The cream cheese with the stuffing is a perfect combination for these mushrooms. My family and I absolutely love them!

It was ok. I used sausage instead of crab meat. It does make a lot of stuffing and I reduced the quantity. But still had too much stuffing. The stuffing was the best part for me. Based on other reviews I reduced the butter but it was still too much.

These are great but it is a HUGE amount of stuffing.  I used 1/5 for a container of mushrooms.  I froze the rest in 4 equal portions.  It freezes great and is almost better afterwards.

This is a delicious recipe. I used fresh snow crab, omitted the red pepper flakes but used a few drops of Tapatio sauce and sprinkled a little grated Parmesan cheese on top!

These are delicious. I sautéed  the garlic and chopped stem pieces in the butter then added it to the crab(canned, not surimi)/stuffing mixture. I drizzled a scant amount of melted butter on top and sprinkled with good parmesan cheese before baking....yummmm. I only made 1/2 the recipe because I only had 1/2 dozen enormous white mushrooms that we bought from a local farm. I stuffed those bad boys to within an inch of their lives : ) and had just the right amount of stuffing. This almost never happens : ) Thanks for a great recipe. This ones a keeper.

This was an awesome recipes. I LOVE mushrooms so I was so excited to try it. Like most reviewers, I halfed almost everything but still had enough stuffing for 3 times as many mushrooms. I used probably half a stick of butter. A quarter for drizzling on too of the mushrooms, and a quarter in the chicken stuffing mixture. I also used real crab, from a can. And I poured dry wine into the bottom of the oven pan with the butter. Baked for about 16 minutes. It tasted wonderful!

Was really good. I skipped the crab and used chicken,also cooked the stems with onion and garlic cloves and added it to the stuffing mix. Everyone liked...even my teenagers. Will make again. Did have extra left,but just went to store and picked up more mushrooms and made again.

I made these and followed the recipe exactly. If this is only supposed to make 12 mushrooms, I'd like to know how big they are!!! This recipe actually stuffed around 40 Baby Bella mushrooms, so unless you're hosting a dinner party or want to eat mushrooms for days on end, make your own stuffing instead of using a box of stove top. I think the stove top mix took away from the other flavors. I couldn't taste the crab meat at all, just chicken flavor and red pepper flakes. Oh, and don't use 2 cups of butter, that was wasteful, one cup may even be too much. Other than that, I think I might make my own stuffing and add sliced almond to it the next time. It was still very tasty.

Followed the recipe exactly and these were a big hit with everyone. Started with just the stems from the first 12 mushrooms and had lots of leftover filling. The filling made an additional 15 mushrooms without adding the additional stems.  Was happy to get to make them two days in a row because of the additional filling. I'll make these again.

I've made these many times and they are excellent.  The filling is VERY generous if you are stuffing button mushrooms.  Like others here, I make changes.  I saute the garlic in 2 TBSP of butter and add to stuffing mixture, I use two cans of crab instead of imitation krab, I sprinkle a little cheese on each before baking, and I make a BUNCH! There are never any leftovers:)

Anyone, making these, beware of the amount of stuffing this makes.  Made these for family and they said they were really good.  (I don't eat mushrooms.)  The only thing is that it makes soooooooooo much stuffing.  The next time I make these, I will be sure to really cut down the recipe.

Very good.  The stuffing part made more than was needed for the amount of mushrooms called for.

Based on previous reviews I had very high expectations and this recipe fell short of the reviews. But this is still very good, yet nothing to brag about.  If you're looking for a new twist on the traditional crab cake this is worth a try but you have to improvise to get that "Wow" reaction I hoped for (based on previous reviews)

ALWAYS a hit at my house and at partys! I usually have to purchase double the suggested amount of mushrooms in order to use all of the filling but no one ever complains about leftovers when I make these so I don't mind.
Try these, you won't be disappointed!

I doubled this recipe for a Christmas party and I bought regular, bite sized mushrooms. I ended up stuffing 60 of them and every last one was eaten. I even have enough mixture to freeze and stuff 100 more! I did use alot less butter than called for and I omitted the crabmeat and added chopped onion.

I made this recipe for a family reunion for 40+ people and one batch was plenty! They were easy to make and were gone in no time at all. I did follow others advice and get bigger mushrooms, baby portabellas work great. I also added 1/4 lb more crab meat which gave them a richer flavor. Thanks for the recipe I will definately be making it again!

The best mushrooms ever!  They do take time to prepare and make, but trust me- anyone who puts these in their mouth won't believe they come from your kitchen. I make these for about every holiday and they are excellent!

This was soooooo good. I made these for my boyfriend and i last night and i must say i was thrilled with the results.  He and I both are fancs of the stuffed mushrooms at olive garden, but these are soo much better.  I like everyone else made a few changes.  I only used 2/3 of the pkg of cream cheese, added in pureed shrimp (About 15), used on 1 stick of butter (to cut the fat) and topped with cheese.  It was so delish!!!  We had so much stuffing left over that we making it again tonight! This was something we made together along with a little jazz music to get us in the mood.  If you get the chance you should definitely try it at as something you and your hunny can make together! :-)  Needless to say we will definitely be using this in the future. 10 Stars!

I too left out the crab meat and added a 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese to the stuffing mix instead. I also topped each one with some Parmesean, because there's no such thing as too much cheese. The first time I used the recipe the stuffing was a little salty, but after using low-sodium stuffing mix the second time I tried it, the stuffing came out much better. I'm making these again this evening with mozzarella cheese! Yum! Thanks for the recipe Gary!

This is the best recipe for mushrooms!  My family is always asking me to bring this dish. I add minced onions in the stuffing, and mozerella cheese on top. It's delicious!

Made this for Fathers Day.  The stuffing was great, but I took the advise of earlier reviews and cut the butter down to 1 cup, which was still too much, next time I'll only use 1/2 cup next time.

These were delicious and very easy to make.  I also cut the butter by half and didn't usy any meat.  I had to bake mine for about 20 minutes because I put a lot of stuffing in and then I broiled them so they were a little crunchy on the top.   Yummmmmmmy!

Definitely need to reduce the butter, and increase the mushroom size. I wonder if 12 large fresh mushrooms mean 12 large portabella mushrooms.

I use large stuffing mushrooms. Cut the stuffing mix to 1/2 pkg and increase real crabmeat to 1 lb.  Use 1-3 tbsp mayonnaise instead of cream cheese.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I made small changes: I got 2 packages of mushrooms(or around 24 mushroom) so I could use most of the mixture. I could only buy a 12 ounce package of crab so I put all of that in, all of the stuffing in, and put mozzarella cheese on top of the mixture. HEAVEN! My fiancee was in bliss, he loved them so much! Will def make again! THANKS GARY!

These were amazing! I didn't use as much butter as was called for. I think I only used what was needed for the stuffing and then drizzled chicken broth over mushrooms before baking. I also added a little bit of chicken broth to the bottom of the pan as another reviewer suggested.

Yum. These were outstanding. I was a little skeptical about the stuffing mix, but it was the key ingredient. I used 1/3 light cream cheese, and sauteed the garlic in 2 tablespoons butter. I did not use the 2 cups butter to pour over top, and I didn't miss it at all! Make sure you use the large mushrooms. Thanks!

These were really good although I did add a little onion powder and garlic salt to the mix before stuffing.  Also I doubled the recipe and it made like 50 mushrooms (aprox 2 inch in size)and I still had a bunch of stuffing leftover!  Also the cooking time was off as I saw a few people noted as well I cooked mine for about 20-25 minutes that seemed to be just right.

I screwed these up and they were still awesome. I completely forgot to add the cream cheese until I was putting the pan in the oven..and then it was to late. I can't wait to try them the 'right' way! I cut back on the butter to 1 cup and added chicken stock to the pan like some other reviews suggested. Also being that I served these for new years I used 16 oz real crab meat in place of the imitation crabmeat. Thanks Gary and Tina for a great recipe!

These are delicious! I've made these several times now and I've adjusted the recipe slightly to contain less stuffing and more crab. The stuffing was just a little overwhelming for me.   Made them for a couple of parties and everyone (who loves mushrooms that is) raved!

Just fantastic ... I used green onion and chive cream cheese instead of the regular.  Grilled these on Webber and the results were ...WOW! Great recipe ... Thanks!

The taste was exceptional, but the presentation on the plate was extraordinary: Very impressive. What I did different: cut the butter back to 2 Tblsp and used it to saute 4 cloves of minced garlic and 1/3 cup minced red onions, to which I added a 12oz chub of sausage. Sauted until sausage was cooked and broken up. Did not drain away fat and added the whole thing to the stuffing mix. Used 14 large, 3 inch diameter bella mushrooms and had plenty of stuffing. I served these as a side dish, but they could be the main course, they're that good.

Loved it,loved it,loved IT....with a few changes of course!! I didn't rinse them,instead I wiped them down (very well) with damp paper towels.I used 2 cans of Chicken of the Sea canned crab (the imitation crab in the seafood section of the grocery it way to fishy),one box of stuffing,one 8 oz brick of cream cheese,1 cup of monterey jack cheese,1/4 cup of butter,a dash of garlic powder and lemon pepper seasoning.I put them all really close together,drizzled them with butter and topped them (heavily) with Monterey Jack cheese.Baked them until golden brown and bubbly---FABULOUS!!!! Me and my boyfriend ate the whole batch in less than 30 minutes!

My changes: Used low sodium stuffing, extra crab meat (not imitation), sprinkled mozz. cheese on top before baking, mixed the sauted garlic into the stuffing, and only used enough butter to saute the garlic, thus eliminating almost 2 cups of butter. I cooked the shrooms on a baking rack so the drippings wouldn't make the shrooms soggy. I would give this recipe 4 stars, but I couldn't really taste the crab, and because of the shear amount of stuffing produced compared to shrooms. I used 24 large crimini's, and had more than 1/2 the stuffing left.

Made this for appetizers for an Italian dinner and they were a HUGE hit!  Although the stuffing makes alot and I saved it in the fridge for the next day.  For some reason was not as good when used the next day.

I had a lot of stuffing mix left over also and I made 24 stuffed mushrooms.  I also made more the next day.  Can't help but eat the stuffing mixture before baking. I sprinkled more butter with fresh lemon juice on top. Will make again and again.

I also cut the butter in half.  The mushrooms were certainly good, but not amazing.  Next time I would do less cream cheese and more crab.

My fiance and I both loved this recipe!  I used cornbread stuffing (leftover from Turkey Day) and also threw in a lot of spinach in order to pretend to be healthy.  :)  I was also out of crabmeat, but found some frozen shrimp lurking in the freezer, so I threw those in instead.  Thanks to Gary!

This recipe is a huge hit with my family and friends. I use 1 1/2 c. Pepperidge Farm stuffing in place of Stove Top and use 1/2 the butter called for (1 stick). I use regular musrhooms and make 24 instead of 12... and these are double-bite sized portions. Of course this being Rhode Island everyone loves the crab... I wouldn't mess with that.

This recipe is amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I had some giant portobello mushrooms that I got from Sam's (5 of them).  I stuffed them will all of the stuffing.  I did not cut down on the butter.  I sprinkled them with SHREDDED parmesan cheese and used real crab meat.  I baked them for around 45 minutes due to the fact that I had real crab meat.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  I love the use of red pepper to make it a little spicy.  GREAT!!

This recipe is AWESOME!! I made these as directed except without the crab.  I also sauteed them on a piece of foil on the grill and they turned out amazing.  We gobbled them all up!! Will make these often!!  Thanks SO MUCH for the recipe.

This stuffing is delicious!  Definatly makes a lot, but thats okay, I used up the extra to stuff chicken breasts.  My fiance asks me to make this stuffing all the time.  I do add extra crab though.

I have been making this recipe for some time and it is a big hit with everyone who tastes it.  I will never look for any other one for stuffed mushrooms as this cannot be topped !!!!

I agree that there was too much of a "stuffing" taste that overpowered the crab/cream cheese mixture.  I like the fact that the ingredients are ones I would most likely find around my house, but I would like to taste more of the filling besides stuffing.

Great taste, easy to make.  These are perfect starters for any party.  As with previous reviewers, I used 1 cup of butter instead of two.  I eliminated the red pepper as well.  I ended up using over 20  large cap mushrooms, and still had some left over.  Thanks for the recipe!

SO easy to make and SO delicious! I was eating the stuffing out of the bowl before I even got to putting it in the mushrooms :]  I didn't have any crushed red pepper on hand, so I sprinkled the tops with garlic powder, white pepper, paprika and ground black pepper. I was only making these for 2, so I bought about 15 small white mushrooms and still had a ton of the stuffing left over to freeze. Can't wait to pull it out again!

These were just ok.  What we didn't like about them was the stuffing - it made the mushrooms taste like pre-prepared food. I guess it's the amount of salt and preservatives they put in these things.  Maybe a better brand would have made this better but I think next time, I will opt for a recipe with all 'natural' ingredients.

LOVE this recipe. Anytime I make this, it's the star of the show. The only thing I did was cut the measurements of butter (for the drizzle) and cream cheese in half.

This was okay but terribly bland. The flavor of the stuffing overpowered the crab, and I put half the stuffing in the freezer before adding the crab! It was an easy dish using things I already had at home, but I will not be making this one again.

Really excellent. First time making them. My modifications were: no crab, didn't have any, and instead of using chicken mix stuff I used bread crumbs mixed with a dash of seasoning for grilled vegetables on each mushroom. I also garnished with a little bit of green onion as I had no red pepper. THanks for sharing this recipe. Fiancé loved it!

I made this for our Super Bowl party, and they were a hit! I prepared 30 mushrooms to use up all the mix because others had said that 12 mushrooms wasn't enough, and I still ended up with a little extra mix. I also sauteed the mushroom stems with some onion as others had suggested. Overall, it came out very tastey (the cream cheese is awesome in this dish) and I received good reviews from my guests. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was delicious!! I did, however, make a few modifications: I followed the advice of reviews to cut down the butter to 1 1/2 sticks butter, and then added the butter and garlic mix to the mushrooms after they came out of the oven, which made them moist and buttery, instead of dry. I would also not add the stems to the stuffing because it really does not do anything for it, and you'll end up with much more stuffing than you need. Be careful though, they can be slippery! I also added all of the seasonings after the mushrooms came out of the oven as well. 
Another thing I did was I did not use crab meat because my mom only likes crab alone, and she does not like anything even a little bit spicy so I omitted the red pepper as well. everyone loved them, and lots of people wanted the recipe! People kept asking for more of them, and a couple of people said they were the best mushrooms they'd ever had!

This was a great recipe! I would not recommend using the stems in the mix because you will end up with so much extra stuffing! I doubled the recipe and ended up cooking the extra mix. It was still really tasty though.

i made these tonight for the Patriots game. everyone loved them.  :)  i cut the recipe in half and it still came out fantastic!  the only change i made was to use only enough butter to top the mushrooms. i had about a cup and a half of leftovers so i froze them.

AMAZING!!! I served these as an appetizer at Christmas and had rave reviews. Everyone loved them. I used pork sausage meat instead of the crab and used low fat cream cheese. I also sauteed the mushroom stems with some spring onions. Tons of stuffing left over, so I actually ended up stuffing over 30 stuffer mushrooms.

These are simply the best..Half the butter and saute the mushrooms as others
recommend..Also I use half crab and half
sausage as I have some non seafood people
They are always gone 10 min after I arrive..A little time consuming but worth it

I made these mushrooms and followed the advice of other cooks – cutting the butter in half (or maybe even less).  I chopped the stems and cooked together with onion and garlic then added the cream cheese.  I added all of that to the stuffing and crab mixture.  I used imitation crab (pollock) and it was good.  I also decided to simply brush the mushrooms with melted butter that had a bit of garlic powder in it.  

I did have a bit of trouble though – when I cooked the mushrooms, the liquid came out and they were swimming in water.  Is there a way to avoid this?  Had I used the recommended butter, the mushrooms would have been submerged in liquid.  I ended up draining the water after they baked and I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and put them under the broiler for 5 mins.  

This recipe would also be good with a bit of real crumbled bacon and possibly using a flavoured cream cheese (such as garlic and herb or something?).  Other than that – it got rave reviews.  Thanks Gary for sharing!

I made these for a party and they were a huge hit.  I used fresh crabmeat instead of the imitation- that crowd was worth the extra money :) I will definately make these again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful! They tasted better than if we had bought them at a restaurant. Although it takes some time to put everything together (we cooked them for about 15 people), it was really easy and definitely worth the effort!

this was excellent with my changes!  I cut the stuffing recipe to 6, but still needed 10 medium sized mushrooms to use all the stuffing. Each mushroom had about 1/4 cup of stuffing, as these were used for a meal.  Also added approx 1/3 cup chopped green onion; used reduced fat cream cheese; just enough butter to saute garlic; used 1/2# REAL lump crabmeat; and added 1 tsp. Old Bay seasoning. These mushrooms were fabulous!

Great recipe; however, you will need more mushrooms for the amount of stuffing and far less butter.  I feel the crabmeat flavor is lost in this one; better to use sausage.

Really tasty!  I made the stuffing mix as directed (used low sodium).  I then browned turkey breakfast sausage and added the chopped stems and garlic to that to saute.  Added that to the stuffing along with the red pepper, garlic powder & cream cheese.  I did not use any more butter than the stuffing called for and these came out GREAT!

These mushrooms were outstanding.  I did use a little less butter to pour over the top, and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I'm Italian and garlic powder is a sin in our house.  :)  I would probably use a little less cream cheese next time, but they were excellent over all!

These were just AWESOME, but honestly, it made WAY too much stuffing for the mushrooms I had on hand...AND PS!!!  USE MORE CRABMEAT than it calls for!!  I used the leftover stuffing for "Crab Stuffed Chicken Breasts" recipe from this site and they were to DIE FOR!! ~ GREAT!! ~ Thank you :)

Very good.  I made these for a family gathering and everyone raved about them.  I'll be saving this recipe to make again!  You definitely DO NOT need that much butter.  I think I only used 1/2 a cup.  2 cups is too much!  You could probably get by just fine using only 1/2 of the stuffing called for.  Save the rest for another meal!

Thank you for this AWESOME recipe - so easy!  It was a HUGE hit at my New Year's Eve Party - there is actually enough of the "stuffing" to make a ton of these babies so I tripled the number of mushrooms I stuffed and omitted the crab.

I made this for the first time and took it to a party.  There was not one person there who didn't say something to me about these mushrooms!  Everybody wanted the recipe.  They were really great.  I did use less butter than called for, much less.  Followed directions otherwise.

Thought this was an awesome recipe!!  Made some changes; use less margarine (3/4 of a cup) and two cans of crab meat and 4-5 cloves of garlic.  Otherwise I think it is really great and a big fan with all my friends...even the ones that either don't like mushrooms or seafood of any kind!  Excellent

YUMMY!  We made them for Saturday and they were so good that we made them again for Sunday but doubled the recipe.  I took leftovers to work and I just emailed everyone at work the recipe.  I agree with others comments about the amount of butter - you can cut it in half.  The best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had.

Eliminated the crab meat, cut the butter way down, and sprinkled with mozzerlla cheese. Stillnot that spectacular. Probably won't try this recipe again.

These were so good!  I used about a third of a stick of butter, probably won't use any next time.  I also added the garlic to the stuffing rather than the butter.  My boyfriend liked them so much he ate all the leftover stuffing!

We had these stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer for Thanksgiving - we even placed the stuffing on sliced baquette and toasted it that way for those that don't like mushrooms.  BOTH ways were wonderfull......

I made this recipe for my father and husband.  They said they were very good.  Will make for them again.

Very yummy.  Will make again but will cut down on the stuffing mix for a creamier stuffed mushroom.

Way too much butter.  I only used half and got very good results.

We love this recipe. It is a favorite in our house, but you can cut the recipe in half. It makes way too much.

Very good, even without the crabmeat (I am allergic).  Definitely use twice the mushrooms and half the butter.

I did not use the crabmeat, nor did I add the mushroom extras to the stuffing. I did however add some green onion to the mixture. It took longer than I thought to do everything, but they turned out great. I did put some stuffing in cherry tomatoes, which I actually liked even better than the mushrooms.  I topped the mushrooms and tomatoes with some shredded cheddar cheese to add some color.  I will make these again!

A friend made these for a dinner and they were a huge hit.  So, of course I had to make them for Chirstmas.  They were wonderful!!!  Even a guest who says he hates mushrooms loved these.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be using this one quite a bit.

I made these with and without the crab meat and quite honestly couldn't tell the difference.  They were very tasty, but the measurements given seemed to be a bit "off".  I only used 1/2 stick of butter and had enough filling to stuff a TON of large mushrooms.  I also added a little shredded cheddar cheese to the mix and on top.  Very good!!

Very good.  I took the advise of others that rated this recipe and I used 30 large white mushrooms and cut the butter in half.  My family has requested these for every get together.  Fun and easy to make and even better to eat!! Thank you
