A great snack or side dish that's also healthy. I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup to make it a little healthier and it tasted just as good, if not better.

This is a simple different slaw recipe, has great flavor. I use apple cider vinegar, I think it has a better flaover than plane white vinegar.

Love this salad!  It's easy to make and gets better with time, except the noodles get soggy.  My solution....I don't add the noodles until we are ready to eat it.  I mix the noodles in as I go.  I used 1 cup of almonds instead of half sunflower seeds - just a personal preference.

I love this and the flavors haven't even had time to meld!  This came together so quickly, which made me happy.  I used Shrimp Ramen Noodles because it's what I had on hand.  I'm already looking forward to lunch tomorrow when I get to enjoy this as it's supposed to be.  THANKS for the recipe!

A favorite with family and extended family. Great with barbeque, on fish tacos, or as several of us say, "I could eat it by the bowlful!"  I tweaked it a little (but it is great as is, too) by toasting the almonds and ramen noodles in a little bit of butter until lightly browned. Fabulous!

I originally had this when someone made it for a potluck and I asked for the recipe and was referred directly to this one!!  The only changes I made were using red wine vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar (as others have suggested).  In place of the seasoning packet, and to cut down on sodium and MSG, I substitute it for 1/4 tsp each onion powder, ground ginger, garlic powder, and pepper.  Awesome!!!!

I used rice vinegar, peanut oil and sesame seeds  in place of cider vinegar, canola oil and sunflower seeds because i didn't have those ingredients on hand. I doubled the recipe for my family of six and everyone loved it. Very quick to prepare and will definitely be making this again.

Made this to serve with Italian beef sandwiches last night.  It was the perfect side dish.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!

I saw reviews with complaints about the "white vinegar" being too bland.  Please note that the recipe does NOT call for white vinegar.  It calls for white WINE vinegar -- there is a huge difference!!!!

Really good I followed the directions of another review to add the seasoning instead of packet. I substituted 2 T of honey for sugar and added 1/2 can of mandarin oranges. Perfect recipe.

Made this a second time and only changed two things:  used the broccoli slaw mix from Kroger (it did not have the kale and Brussels sprouts) and toasted the almonds.  This made a huge difference!  Loved it more the second time!

Loved this salad! I think next time I'll try rice wine vinegar and sesame oil to change it up to have more Asian flavor. Also, I could not find broccoli slaw at my grocery store so I bought organic broccoli and carrots and shredded them in my food processor.  A bit more work than packaged but you know what's in it.  Now if I could figure out how to reduce the calorie content, I'd make this every week!

Made with a kale and brussel sprout mix instead and added 1/4 tsp ground ginger to the dressing. Omitted nuts/seeds. Added ramen into salad right before serving. Added Thai coconut broth (check grocery stores) to some rice as the base, then salad and topped with some asian-inspired skirt steak. Delicious dressing for this dish!

This is one of my favorite side dishes. To make it lighter I use 1/4 cup oil and 1/3 cup Splenda. I usually toast the almonds, but, you don't need to. A wonderful easy dish.

Have made this for years. Always a hit! You may use a lot less oil and it will still be great. Don't put the dressing on until a few minutes before serving.

I can't tell you if this will be better the next day.  My husband eats the whole bowl-full every time.  It's perfect for summer dinners and I've made it once a week since I found the recipe several weeks ago.

Love this...Made a double batch for a cookout on Saturday.  Had it on top of pulled Pork leftovers yesterday and brought the last of it in a Tupper bowl for lunch today.  I use Cider Vinegar, added a bit of Soy and also (this time) subbed out the sugar for a couple tablespoons  of homemade blood orange marmalade to the dressing.  Lightly citrusy this time. Refreshing and healthy for lunch...even with the soggy noodles it's a winner.  Tossed on a few new slivered almonds for new crunch today.

Liked the recipe. 
For more of an oriental flavor, I added 2 teaspoons of sesame oil to the vinegar/oil dressing. I also added the sunflower seeds about 30 min before serving. 
Will definitely make again.

I love this salad. I used two noodles packages instead of one and used rice vinegar. I also substituted pepitas for almonds.

Definitely will make again. I was missing many things so just used cabbage, not broccoli, red onion, not green onions, whole toasted almonds, not slivers, etc. The base flavor lends itself nicely to modification.

This was great. I used apple cider vinegar, substituted 2 Tbs of sesame oil and reduced the total oil to 1/4 cup. Toast the sunflower seeds and almonds to give a nuttier taste. Add the ramen noodles just before serving so they are nice and crunchy.

Delicious! I used half veggie oil, half sesame oil, and it tasted delicious. I also tried it with a spicy ramen flavoring which gave it a nice kick that the kids loved. Great recipe, and it was easy to customize to our tastes.

Turned out wonderful.  I added the extra sesame oil for flavor as one reviewer recommended and it was too much oil.  I recommend substituting sesame oil for part of the oil instead of adding.

I've made this for my Ladies' Night get together and it was a HUGE hit!  What a wonderful and easy salad to make.  Seriously, it takes more time to sit in the fridge than it does to make it.  Next time, I'm going to add raisins or dried cranberries for a hint of sweetness but it is just perfect how it is.  Enjoy!

Nice, refreshing salad!  I used Ramen Chicken instead, seeing as I didn't have the Oriental on hand.  So easy and wonderful flavoring!
