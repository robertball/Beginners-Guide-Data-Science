this cake recipe seems off to me. i attempted to make it followed all instructions etc. and at the "batter" stage i had a very watery FOAMY mess. i'll give the benefit of the doubt and say that maybe there were some misprints in the recipe--the flour especially seems to be a starngely small amount. also the recipe called for using a 9 9 pan and with the amount of watery foam batter i had it would have bubbled out of the pan. unfortunately trying to make this cake into muffins only made it worse--the muffins boiled out of the pan and burned. also i tried adding flour to thicken up the batter and that obviously didn't help. i think this recipe needs some adjusting which is why i am only giving it one star.

Our family loves this cake. I double it for a 9x13 and omit the walnuts for the sake of one child. It benefits from a bit of salt and extra cinnamon. Cook a little longer if you are dealing with a gooey cake. A cream cheese frosting whipped cream or buttery sauce is the perfect finish.

I have made this recipe for years and its really good. I pour the boiling water over the oats and sugars and then add the rest of the ingredients in normal cake fashion. It's light and fluffy and rich.

Great recipe! I added shredded carrots cranberries chopped granny smith apple and a little more applesauce. I baked it in a sheet cake pan and cut into squares it didn't last a day!
