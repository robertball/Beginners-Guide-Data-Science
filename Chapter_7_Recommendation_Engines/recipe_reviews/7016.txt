This is a great, simple recipe for french toast. If your using thicker bread or are soaking the bread for a while, I would suggest covering the griddle or pan with a lid. This will cook the inside of the bread, making it less soggy....I also prefer to use butter or margarine in the pan rather than oil, gives it more flavor.

I enjoyed this basic french toast recipe. However, make sure the pan is completely hot before frying, because otherwise it sticks bad and you end up with a mess on your hands - like I did. :)

Great, classic french toast. I added all of the spices as suggested and enjoyed the taste, although I would probably use less nutmeg next time. I used the rest of a loaf of french bread that we had bought the night before, so that made it extra tastey. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and covered the pan with a lid so the middle would also cook.

YUM-O.  This stuff is amazing.  I have used several different kinds of breads and it all tastes amazing.  My advice is to try to use a thicker bread just because the thinner stuff tends to get a little soggier.  Thanks for the post.

This recipie was very tasty... we ate it so fast that we all got stomach pains.  But it took forever to cook.  Is there a faster way... maybe we soaked the bread too much.  Please respond.  Thanks and it was great!

Took way too long to cook. I had to add another egg to get a good consistency. Tasted bland.

Very tasty recipe. I added a tiny bit of ground cloves to it to zest it up. Will definitely use this recipe again.

This is a good, basic french toast. One word of caution, in case you are a french toast newbie like me- wait until you are ready for the next slice to dunk. I kept one of the slices in the egg mix for way too long and it soaked up too much. Quick dunk is all you need. Thanks for sharing!

Good recipe.  I used homemade bread and served with apple syrup and my family loved it.  If your bread is turning out soggy, lower the heat a bit so that the inside has more time to dry out before the outside gets overdone.  Also, try using whole milk or 2% instead of skim as skim is thinner.

I used Texas toast for this recipe and quadrupled it to use a whole loaf. This way, I'd have enough for this morning's breakfast and extra to freeze in two's, which means I could just pop the pre-made french toast in the toaster on busy mornings when I don't have time to make a hot breakfast from scratch. I did double the spices for a QUADRUPLE batch. I liked the addition of the nutmeg, as did the kids. I served this with homemade maple-vanilla syrup. Good stuff!

5 stars with a few changes: I doubled the eggs, and used just a splash of milk for a thicker batter. I didn't include the nutmeg and  eliminated the salt.  I melted margarine in the skillet over medium heat and sprinkled a little extra cinnamon on both sides of the bread while cooking. Family loves this recipe!  Very easy and very tasty.

This recipe is perfect.  Instead of using my same old through together french toast recipe.  I decided to try something a little different.  I did make a couple changes as I added more cinnamon, nutmeg and doubled the vanilla as I used imitation.  About half of the milk was replaced with coffee mate's coconut cream dairy creamer (refrigerated kind).  It came out absolutely delicious.  There are a couple other creamer flavors out for the holidays that I am going to try with this recipe.  All I've got to say is YUMMO!!!

This was so good!  I didn't have nutmeg, so just used cinnamon and vanilla extract.  I topped it with the Simple Maple Syrup recipe and it was so good!!!  Next time I will try it with nutmeg, but it was great w/o it!
Thanks for the recipe!  This will be my usual.

Great french toast!  I always add some sugar to the egg mixture.  Top with powdered sugar and serve with butter and syrup!

I made this for my husband and he loved it.  Besides tasting great, it smells wonderful.  The only change I made to the recipe was I used butter instead of oil to cook the french toast in.

This was super easy and quick.  Just be sure to dip the bread quickly to soak each side, then put right into a hot pan.  If the bread soaks too long in the batter, the inside becomes really heavy and soggy, and doesn't cook all the way through.  Also, let the pan get really hot and add a pat of butter, then put the bread in, and cover with a lid.  I served it with a bit of icing sugar on top, and some maple syrup.  My husband eats it with berry preserves.  Yummy!

This is a very good recipe, a definite keeper. I fried the bread in butter flavor Pam to cut back on some of the sweetness.

Very good, especially the flavor that cinnamon and nutmeg add.  I wouldn't change the ingredients at all.  This went over very well with my family.  It's the first time I've made French toast.  Watch your heat.  The medium high setting can burn the toast quickly.  I'm learning to turn  the burner down a half or full notch after the first batch.  I will definitely prepare this recipe again sometime.

this recipe has great flavor.  the spices lend a very nice and special touch to the original french toast recipe.  the only problem was that there was not near enough batter to make six slices of toast.  I only used regular bread, not even thick bread and there was still not enough.  I would suggest doubling it or possibly just using time and a half the original ingrediants from the beginning.  I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and used a little extra vanilla.  Delicious starter recipe and I LOVED the nutmeg in it!  thank you for the good recipe.

French toast is about the only breakfast food my husband can actually cook without burning down the house. But after I used this new recipe on him, he won't dare enter the kitchen to make his version anymore! This recipe is easy, quick and delicious.

Basic french toast. Wether your beginning to cook or an expert you will be loved for this. Happy to see a basic recipe on AR. I did a plain picture so a beginner can see what a done piece looks like. The secret to FT is cook on medium heat--dont rush it. It needs to cook all the way through.

I did not care for this recipe. I made this exactly as the recipe said and it was a soggy mess. There is way too much milk which makes the outside crispy and the inside soggy. Also very bland. Just tasted like a soggy piece of bread. I probably could have salvaged it by adding a couple more eggs but I didn't have time. Will not make this again.

Great recipe but as I noticed from others there were issues with the french toast cooking thoroughly.  I would suggest either letting the bread stale, or toasting the bread first.  This is how you end up with crispy french toast that is not undercooked.  I learned this from my mom as a kid.  The end result was that no one complained, and I actually received kudos from those in my household.

Absoloooootely YUM! I've made this as is and also 'lessened' this to a smaller quantity. I say lessened, because with a recipe like this you don't really need to go about halving it or quartering it...you can just sense your way around....in other words I'm also saying that this is a SUPER EASY and ADAPTABLE recipe! :) I did add less than a tbsp of brown sugar which I thought added yummy flavour as well....I once skipped the salt (coz I forgot) and thought it was just as awesome, so I never add the salt anymore! ;) I've made this with french bread, wheat bread, regular thin sliced bread, but never had any complaints about sogginess...but for those who do have that complaint, the tip (by a fellow reviewer)on covering it with a lid whilst cooking is an excellent one! :) All in all ... FANTASTIC! Thanks Jan! :)

Definitely do not use all the suggested nutmeg - 1/8 tsp. will be plenty!  I used plain old white sandwich bread and just did a quick dip in the batter.  I used 7 slices. cooked on med to med-hi heat. my boyfriend loved it!

I'm not sure how the flavor of the french toast on its own was because I served with country fried apples on top.  The apples have such a strong flavor it's hard to tell.  But overall, the dish was a hit!  I also suggest using Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon bread!

I didn't know there was any other way to make French Toast than this way.  I use the Texas Toast style bread and also cover it to cook the bread inside.

Very nice and mildly spicy. i made the following modifications - used 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder and kept the nutmeg at 1/4. Added 1/3 cup sugar which made it pleasantly sweet. was able to make with slices of read. Will make again. Total comfort food!!

This is a great recipe. The only things I changed was to add 1 more egg and add 1 tablespoon of sugar. The sugar provides the needed sweetness...

I never knew french toast was this easy to make. Boyfriend always made it just with egg and it was never sweet, so I just stuck to ordering it a restaurant. I made this with thick texas toast and it was just simply delicious. Next time, I will cut back on the vanilla extract and will definitely garnish it with powdered sugar. I will also cook on lower heat and for longer and possibly with a lid, as I too had somewhat soggy french toast. If the fire is too hot, the outside will brown/burn before the inside is done.

Very simple and easy to follow recipe.  The only trouble I had was getting the last of the egg mix on the last toast. :)
Also, watch your butter when greasing the pan.  My first toast was sopping with butter.

I added the nutmeg and cinnamon. I also added 2 teaspoons of sugar, and whenever I make french toast, after I have them all lined up on the griddle, I sprinkle extra cinnamon on all of them.  Only on that one side, though. Next time I think I will add 2 tablespoons sugar instead of teaspoons, because I still didn't think they were quite sweet enough.

The taste was really bland and the middle of my thickest pieces were still extremely soggy.  The batter needs something for a little more flavor and definitely some flour.  Through this mix out after making a few pieces.

Tried this recipe yesterday morning for my family.  I used Italian bread with sesame seeds and it was awesome!  Family loved it.  Saved in my recipe box.  I didn't change a thing, except that I recalculated the number of servings.  Served with fried apples and organic maple syrup.  Yum!

Very good classic French Toast. I used LOVE's Sweet Bread which I cut into 4 thick slices. I used 3 eggs with 1/4 cup skim milk. I soaked the bread slices and then added it to the hot skillet over medium high heat. I added a tab of butter to the skillet for easy cooking and more flavor. I did not want to add the nutmeg or vanilla extract as the bread is already sweetened. I topped it off with a little butter and maple syrup. Quick, easy and tasty. My tummy was happy!

One word....two syllables....PER-FECT!  This is simple, but delicious! It could not be better.  The tricks are to dip the bread (not soak it) and to have your skillet or griddle buttered and hot. Thanks for sharing Jan!

Delicious!  My only problem with this recipe was that, over medium-high heat, my French toast was still soggy one minute and over-browned the next.  I would recommend turning down the heat after a couple of minutes' cooking.  Aside from some dark spots, the final product tasted wonderful, and the texture was a perfect crispness on the outside and still chewy inside.

Boyfriend and I loved it - it tastes and smells awesome (we put no nutmeg though). Definitely burns easily on the outside but stays uncooked on the inside so putting on a lid helps to even out the heat. Adding more oil and turning down the heat a lot helps to make it crispy but prevent burning.

This recipe was okay. I wasn't wowed by it. I used my leftover Challah bread from Shabbat. My toast was still smooshey in the center despite the outside being done. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to prevent this?

This is a good basic recipe but needs some sugar and more intense cinnamon (another 1/4 tsp) Just be certain the cinnamon is fresh.  It makes a big difference. For those adding nutmeg be careful and use sparingly as this spice is very unforgiving when too much is used, it turns bitter.

After making this twice already, the third time I added 1 tsp. of sugar.  It was edible, but still not good. Maybe my family just doesn't like french toast.  I made this with wheat bread which the recipe states can be used.  Perhaps that was the problem.

I love this recipe! Its the only way I've ever been able to make edible french toast, one of my very favorite foods. My husband likes it and my son said it was the best breakfast he could ever remember having. Thanks so much!

Really Good! We left out the nutmeg though because we thought that would be weird in french toast.

This was soooo yummy!  French toast is one of my favorites and I love fixing it for dinner as well as breakfast.  This recipe was very easy to follow and so basic that you could add whatever other ingredients you like.  I didn't use the nutmeg simply because I forgot to put it in.  I served Pike's gooey syrup over this (also from this site).  Thanks much Jan.

This was Amazing. Made it  with shepherds bread.  I reduced the optional nutmeg to 1/8 tsp and added 3 tbsp of white sugar. Cooked it on a griddle with coconut oil. Served them with vanilla-cinnamon maple syrup.  My husband took one bite and just said "Wow". This is a keeper.

Simple and yet sooo good. The kids loved it. Super simple with the ingredients already at hand. It worked with the HARDEST bread and it did not take long at all! I did use butter instead of oil and I do use almond flavoring with french bread usually, but I know vanilla is good too.

Just the basic recipe I was looking for: this ratio of eggs to milk worked really well for us. I used lots of cinnamon and the vanilla extract and got just the taste I was looking for, thanks so much for sharing.

My husband and I found the nutmeg to be a little overpowering, so the next time we used a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg.  It was delicious!  You can't go wrong with pumpkin pie flavored french toast!

Simple and delicious.  I thought 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg would be too much, but it was just right.  I used regular sliced Italian bread, so there's no need to go out of your way to find thick sliced bread.

This recipe would also be WONDERFUL using Banana Bread. For best results, you'd want to use a dense/heavy Banana Bread to prevent crumbling.

I used store-bought whole wheat bread instead of the thick sliced bread. But I would have liked a more "eggy" french toast. Maybe next time, I will use more eggs and I'm sure thick sliced bread would be much better.

Great recipe! I doubled the recipe but only used 1 cup milk and no nutmeg or vanilla. I noticed many people say the custard is better baked, but I used a shortcut by using a coated skillet and put a lid on the toast for about 1-2 min per side with the skillet on MD-LOW temp. This way the custard bakes up a little. Keep flipping and covering. When the toast springs back to the touch on both sides, it's done!  I sifted some confectioner's sugar on top and let them go to town with syrup. **As an extra treat:** I also took the leftover mix, beat in 1 extra egg, and made a scrambled custard by pouring it into the skillet heat on medium and continually scraping the bottom then putting on the lid for a minute or so until it is no longer runny. It's a sweet treat to douse in syrup and a great side for the toast!

Wonderful!  I too use butter in lieu of oil.  I would also suggest a loaf of egg bread for your bread selection.  I slice them about 3/4" thick and it turns out fabulous.  FYI:  The egg bread doesn't get soggy in the center.  I drop my bread one side down in the mixture and immediately flip it and then transfer it to the pan of melted butter - medium heat.  Yum!

Thank you for this recipe. The french toast is perfect everytime. This recipe is a basic recipe that is foolproof. I usually double this recipe and use and entire loaf of white bread, cook the french toast on my gas griddle,  put it back into the bread bag, and separate each piece with a square of wax paper. It freezes beautifully and I reheat it for my kids during the week in the toaster oven. I also add  2 packages of Truvia into the egg mixture. Thanks again for my family's favorite breakfast recipe!!

This was an easy, basic recipe that turned out pretty well. I like to butter both sides of the bread to give it flavor before dipping it in the batter. I used french bread, and I would have put the top on the skillet to cook the middle if I could find it. :)

I used EggBeaters and skim milk and this turned out to be a really good french toast!  I left out the nutmeg because we are not big fans.  This is a classic, simple way to make a comforting dish!  Thanks!!!

As if this recipe needs another rating, but I couldn't resist thanking Jan for this one.  I have been making french toast like this for years, but mine never came out "just right".  This is the right blend of ingredients to give you "company worthy" french toast to serve to family or friends.  To put my own spin on it, instead of using milk I use Coffee Mate French vanilla (liquid) creamer.  This produces a wonderful, slightly sweeter version that is "bed and breakfast" quality french toast.  Yummy, and all three sons eat it up and lick the plate clean!  Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed!

I hadn't made french toast in years.  This recipe had the right amount of egg-milk mixture.  I used frozen bread so it wouldn't soak up the liquid and fried in butter.  It turned golden brown and was very good!

Yum yum yum! Very simple, but delicious! I used old fashioned Vienna bread (it's what I had on hand-would probably use thick slice or regular bread for this recipe), and it turned out great! Added a bit more cinnamon than called for, cause I love the stuff!

This was easy enough for my 9 year old granddaughhter to make AND excellent tasting.  She could even flip the toast in the air to turn it.

This is a great basic french toast recipe.  I like the added vanilla...never did that before.  Also, a pinch of salt...hadn't done that before either.  The egg to milk ratio is great.

I usually stay away from french toast recipes because I hate the "eggy" taste and they never seem done.  Well,hubby loves french toast so I decided to give this a try.  I am grateful for the lid tip!  These came out great! No "egg" taste here.  I also added  brown sugar to a batch and it was also great.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  This is a great basic recipe.  I'm sure this would be even better with raisin bread or topped with fruit and powdered sugar!  Update:  I;ve used this many times now and the results are always superb!  It deserves 5 stars for ease and taste!

Woke up today craving french toast... but didn't want to make it the same old way. This is nice... I like the nutmeg and vanilla. I used whole wheat flax seed bread. Will for sure make it again!

Very good!  I used reg bread (that was a day past exp so it was like a sponge) I used 2 Jumbo eggs & followed the rest of the recipe & it was just enough for 6 slices I wouldn't recommend letting the bread sit in the egg mixture any time just drop & flip otherwise it gets too soggy. Also we like a little sweeter french toast so on the second batch I added 1/4 C Dark brown sugar, you need to watch to not burn the toast because of the sugar.

I really liked the flavor of this. Not your ordinary french toast. I didn't add any salt. I'm glad I went ahead and added the cinnamon and nutmeg. It really made this great. The maple syrup went well with it. I used some french bread I'd made a few days ago and was afraid this might be a bit dry since it was a dip and cook and not a soaked overnight method, but this turned out so nicely, the bread toasted cripsy on the outside and the inside was soft and tender. I grilled this with about 3-4 Tbl of real butter, not the healthiest, but definitely the most delicious! I did add a couple of Tbls white sugar to the egg batter, that's just tradition. I'd have given this 5 stars otherwise.

This was good! I used milk, egg, and cinnamon.
I don't think I cooked mine long enough however.
I topped it with a big gop of butter and lots of maple syrup. My boyfriend topped his with powdered sugar. Yummy!

I thought this was a great basic recipe, which was what I needed to get started.  To spice it up, I added about a tablespoon of vanilla pudding mix and some orange zest to the milk/egg mix, then added chopped pecans right before they were done.  Topped with a little cherry pie filling, powdered sugar, and maple syrup, it was an artery clogging deliciously satisfying breakfast!

This recipe turned out great!  My mother in law came to visit, and she asked for the recipe.  The only thing I would change is next time I will add a little powdered sugar to the egg mixture.  I like my french toast a little sweeter.

I had a loaf of old bread to use up, so I tripled the egg mixture.  I froze the leftover french toast, and it is just as good the second time around.  I just popped a couple of pieces in the toaster oven.

This recipe was great. I cut back the milk as recommended in other reviews (I used 1/2cup). Next time, I will try adding a little confectioner's sugar to the batter, and also sprinkle some on the finished bread. This recipe was delicious, easy, and traditional. Will use often! Thanks so much!

Jan I have made French toast many times before and never thought of putting nutmeg in it.  I have put in cinnamon and vanilla though.  My family loved this special touch.  What I plan on doing the next time is making the egg mixture up the night before that way all of the cinnamon and nutmeg will be thoroughly blended.  I beat it with the mixer for about 5 minutes and I would still have to wisk it before I started the batch to frying.  That does not bother me too much cause I do that any way when I make it with the cinnamon.  Thanks for the unique change in having French Toast.

Quick, hot breakfast for the kids. I usually add another egg or two and slightly increase the milk. I just add cinnamon and not the nutmeg and vanilla. One thing to add, I usually have to keep stirring the mixture in between bread dunkings as the cinnamon separates easily. Being a busy mom I don't always have thick bread and sandwich bread works just fine. Yum!

This recipe is really good and easy, and you can even make it with cheap sandwich bread if that's all you have on hand. The key to this recipe is not to soak the bread too much. Put your slice in the mixing bowl, flip it right over, and then put it on the griddle. I experimented with soaking the bread more, and it ends up being soggy and undercooked.

Excellent.  Used a crusty italian bread and unsweetened vanilla soy milk.   Added 1/4 tsp of cocoa powder for variety.

This is a favorite in our house, loved by all. I use challah bread. Add a few chocolate chips, fresh strawberries, a tiny amount of powdered sugar to make it pretty and a bit of grade a maple syrup.

Made it exactly as shown and it was delicious! I understand what you mean about covering them but they weren't really soggy just soft. In fact that's just the way i like them! I guess to each their own!

I cooked this for myself this morning for breakfast and I think the taste was fantastic.  I changed the serving size to 1 serving and the only thing I can suggest is if you're going to do this is put 2 eggs instead of just 1(or 5/8 from what they say). There wasn't much  egg mixture for my 2nd piece of bread. I'm definitely going to add it to my recipe book!

Just made this for my family. I'm an amateur at best and it was a very simple recipe to follow. Was trying to make for one person so I used a little bit less milk and one egg. Added a whole lot of fruits and goes great with whipped cream

Recipe is very simple and easy. I was just cooking for me so used 2 slices of sandwich bread (only bread I had on hand), 1 egg, 1/3 cup milk, 1/4 tsp of grnd cinnamon, 1/8 vanilla, no nutmeg or salt. I hadn't made french toast in several years, and it turned out great. I definitely recommend this for anyone wanting a simple fr toast recipe.

Made this french toast this morning and it was great . I did add a teaspoon of brown sugar, just because I like to add brown sugar. I loved and my boyfriend went back to make him another slice. I will be adding this recipe to my recipe box.

Great basic recipe! I used margarine on the pan instead of oil and I skipped the salt. For me this is a key step. I laid my bread slices on a cookie sheet and lightly dusted them with cinnamon on one side because the spice will stay put in the crannies and provide an even coat of flavor. Seems to me when the spices are in the milk mixture they tend to sink to the bottom of the bowl, clump or run to the sides when you dunk the bread in. After I spiced the bread on a cookie sheet I poured the milk,egg and vanilla mixture over it then flipped them to coat. They cooked up nicely on my preheated double burner pan. No sticking with the margarine and they were not soagy at all. Saved to recipe box. Thank you!

It was very good.  My two boys enjoyed them as well.  When I asked if I should make it again they said YES!   The only thing I did differently I added cinnamon directly on to the bread slices as they cooked.

The only problem with this recipe is that it has ruined my kids from eating any other French Toast anywhere!  Don't be tempted to skip the optional ingredients - they all play an important role, even the salt which really acts to bring out all the other flavors.  I always make a double or triple batch so I have a cookie sheet ready in  300 degree oven and I put each slice on it to keep warm as I continue to cook the rest. This is also a great technique if you find some of your toast is stil kind of soggy.

The recipe itself is not bad, BUT if u add 2 tablespoons of flour turns into the most amazing french toast ever...I will never make french toast again with the flour, makes all the difference.

These were the best French Toasts that I have ever made.  In times past when I made French Toast it was a disaster.  However, I took the advice of another reviewer and covered my pan.  Very easy and good.  Thank you!

I didn't care for this recipe. For the first half of the batch of french toast, I followed the recipe exactly but found that the french toast only tasted like vanilla extract and nutmeg. It wasn't a bad taste, but it is not how I like my french toast. For the second half, I added another egg, a splash of milk, and a little cinnamon -- I essentially halved the amounts of the vanilla extract and the nutmeg, and the results were much better.

I've been making my French Toast this way for years (except I don't use the nutmeg). My husband wasn't a big fan of french toast until I had him try my version...now he asks for it often. I can't tell you what the measurements are because I don't measure I just do it by eye. All breads work according to your likes & dislikes, but we like it best with the Friehoffer 'Taliano bread with the seeds or the thicker texas toast type breads. If your french toast is taking too long you may be soaking the bread too long in the batter and that definitely will take longer. Another tip is that maybe you didn't have your griddle or skillet hot enough. My trick is to melt butter on your cooking surface first and you won't have any trouble with it sticking either. Just trying to help.

Wow, some of the best waffles I've tasted.  I'm glad I used this recipe instead of the pre-mixed box, that I used to always use.  I would recommended to all for simple delicious waffles.

Great recipe... I used three eggs and barely covered 6 slices and you have to re-beat the mix between slices or all the spices end up on the last slice on the bottom (I made a shaker mix of nutmeg and cinnamon for this to shake on the slices after soaking as its my daughters favorite) Dont add too much milk or youll have soggy toast and make sure the skillet is HOT

Fabulous french toast!!!  I am a big fan of nutmeg, so I put a little extra in.  Uncomplicated, easy, traditional french toast.

really simple to make. I ended up adding some fruit to it as follows. I thinly slice one golden delicious apple and one pear. In a pan I browned some butter and through in the pear and apple. I added some sugar and cinnamon, as much as desired. let the fruit sautee allowing for natural juices to come out. As the fruit cooked I added a touch more butter and a little bit of apple cider to allow for more of a "natural" sauce to happen. Once done I added this fruit mixture and sauce made by fruit onto the french toast. It ended up tasting a lot like an apple pie, plus the juices from the fruit created its own syrup, so the family didn't need any additional syrup. For an added kick sprinkle a touch of powdered sugar over french toast/fruit topping and finish with a dash of whip cream. I am defiantly keeping this in a regular circulation at my house. You can essentially do this with other fruits like peaches- it is like you were to make a filling for a pie or cobble and adding it to the top of your french toast.

Woke up in the morning and needed a quick and easy french toast recipe to make for my bf's bday.  5 stars for ease, but 4 for taste.  It was missing flavor...I guess that's where the syrup comes in.

This recipe was great, considering I don't cook that well. I only got 5 slices out of it, so if you're cooking for 2 or more be sure to compensate. I added some cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top.

This was my first time making french toast, and I really didn't expect it to turn out great. I was wroooong! IT WAS DELICIOUS! I'm not a big fan of nutmeg, so I didn't add it. But I did add vanilla, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Just ordinary white bread, too. I made sure the pan was hot first, as well. In any case, it was absolutely delicious~

I made a loaf of homemade bread last night just to make French toast this morning since I didn't have any thick sliced bread available otherwise.    I actually had to DOUBLE the recipe for the entire 2 pound loaf.  I used 5 eggs total in the recipe (try to get a little more protein in for my non-egg-eating 5 year old).  I didn't add the nutmeg but did add about a teaspoon of sugar and I used half and half for one half of the milk and the 2/3 for the other.  I think it added a creaminess to the taste.    I agree, too, with the heat being med-high it leaves a few spots a little more brown than I typically like but seeing that my husband ate 3 pieces, eldest son at 2 and my middle son ate 2, this is a keeper.  those kind of "finishes" at breakfast time definitely is not something to balk at!

I used butter in the pan to boost the flavor and all of the spices that were suggested. My family has been using the same french toast recipe for the last 20+ years. I tried this variation today and they loved it. It even beat out the family tradition. Go nutmeg. (^_^)

Yuck - too much vanilla and nutmeg! I usually just "eyeball" my french toast recipes, but thought I'd try an "actual" recipe. Definitely did not like this. Odd proportions of spices.

Very easy to throw together and the spices add such a yummy taste. Used thin sliced bread and did NOT submerge into batter- just quickly dipped and added to my hot pan. My nephew (3) and son (9) gobbled this toast up in no time at all.

Great taste.  I found that briefly dunking rather than soaking the bread and then covering the pan with a lid during cooking solved my soggy french toast problem.  Thanks!

Like the recipe says, there are many variations of this basic recipe.  Cut the milk in half, add a tablespoon of spiced rum, and use 4 thick slices of cinnamon bread and real maple syrup.  That's my brother's "secret" french toast recipe, and the best french toast I've ever had!  Enjoy.

I tried this and it's very good for regular slices of bread. For thick bread, (like, inch think, day old french bread -yumyum) I find it better to use 1/2 cup of milk, 1/4 tsp of all spice, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. preheat oven to 400*F, and fry the bread on medium heat until a very light brown. then put them in the oven for 12-15 min. it's so fluffy and light and actually cooks all the way through =)

I did use thin slices of bread, and yes it turned out soggy... but we love them nonetheless! I might've used a little too much of nutmeg because it was very overpowering... will omit it next time. To prevent serious sticking, use a non-stick skillet.

Very delish! 
I didn't even have thick bread and it still turned out great.
Although one minor issue is that the egg doesn't mix well with the milk.
Every couple of bread dips, sprinkle in a little more cinnamon!

Easy and flavorful!  I used a little extra cinnamon (LOVE cinnamon), and just a dash of nutmeg, and cooked it in butter instead of oil.  Perfect blend of ingredients!  I didn't have thick bread so I made sure each piece was just dipped in quickly on both sides without soaking real completely, and it cooked up just right.

This was a good basic recipe that you can really get creative with. I soaked my sourdough bread slices (flipping them once) for about 6 hours. It wasn't super-flavorful, but I will just have to keep experimenting with different spices. But, I will be keeping this recipe, thanks.

I really loved this recipe.  I thought it was quite flavorful, although, I admit, I didn't measure the spices very "exactly."  I think I probably used more than the prescribed amount.  What I like about this recipe is that it does not come out too thick or too eggy, and it has a nice, sweet flavor.  I used "french toast bread" that I found at Safeway.  It's thick, like Texas Toast, and already had some very light spices in it.  Texas Toast would, I'm sure, work well, too.  Make sure to use a thick bread so that it holds up well.

I think the "medium-high" setting recommended in this recipe is too high.  I put my burner on a medium high setting (6 out of 10 on my range), and it burned the outside of the toast without cooking the inside.  I turned it down to about 2 or 3, and it worked perfectly.  I used a non-stick pan and oil to keep the french toast from sticking.  These cooked in minutes for me, and were delicious!

Very easy, quick and yummy french toast. I covered my skillet to ensure that it was cooked through and added an extra egg. We topped it off with strawberry rhubarb jam and a touch of maple syrup. It was delicious.

If you are looking for a simple, classic french toast, this is it.  I found I needed 1 and 1/2 what the recipe called for (3 eggs, extra milk) for 6 pieces of bread.  Very good with powdered sugar and sliced bananas (and of course, syrup!).  Thanks for sharing!

Mine came out great! If you don't butter (or oil) the skillet for each one, they brown too quickly (for my tastes), and don't cook all the way through. But even the ones that came out more like bread pudding than french toast tasted excellent.

This is the perfect french toast recipe.  You can use just about any type of bread you want.  I usually add a little extra cinnamon.

This was delicious!  I used banana nut bread and followed other reviewers suggestion of covering it for a few minutes on low-medium heat to cook it through.  Then before I took it off of the griddle, I cut the bread slice into two triangles and slightly grilled the cut side of the triangle.  I made this for a surprise breakfast for my husband's birthday and he absolutely love it, as did my daughter.  Thanks!

mmmm. perfect. I used stale french bread. Don't cut it too thick- up to about 3/4 inch and it will cook all the way through! Use stale bread or put your slices in the oven for a few mins to dry them out a bit. The nutmeg was delicious in this recipe. Butter your pan so it doesn't stick!

I have found that for me to get enough for 6 slices of texas toast, I need to do 1 1/2 times the recipe on all of the ingredients.  Also, since the cinnamon sticks to the first couple of pieces of bread, for the remaining pieces of bread, I dip them and put them on the skillet, I then sprinkle some cinnamon on the side that hasn't cooked yet.  I find that the vanilla extract is essential for better flavor.

I made this french toast for a camping trip for 20 people.  God rave reviews!  I made the batter 2 days in advance and it turned out nicely.  There were lots of extras, which I froze when we got back in sandwich baggies.  They were great popped into the toaster for a quick breakfast!  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  It was great with butter and syrup and also nicely flavored alone as a quick snack.

As a Brit I really miss French Toast, it's just not the same here as it is in America. But I loved how easy this was to make. Needs a bit of sugar in the egg mix to make it a bit sweeter though.

Great! I used small slices of Sara Lee Honey Wheat Bread and was able to get 8 slices out of it. Nicey and easy for a quick Sunday morning breakfast. Some people mentioned it wasn't sweet enough, but I liked that because I get the sweetness from the syrup I add later. Saves a few calories without sugar added to the toast itself.

My first time making French toast, and i'm glad this is a good basic starting recipe. I followed the instructions, but my center was soggy because of my thinner bread. Thanks for the reviews, they were VERY helpful : use med-LOW heat, use a cover (I used foil over the griddle) and use a thicker bread. Thanks everyone!

Easy to make.It has become a breakfast favourite for my kids.
I blend 1 ripe banana with the milk.This adds some vitamins,gives great taste and cuts down on the amount of syrup kids like to pour on.
Thanks for the recipe.

I made French toast for the first time today using this recipe, and it really turned out great - just like in a NY Diner.  I was out of cinnamon so I used Pumpkin Pie Spice and dropped the nutmeg.  It turned out just fine.  I will definitely make this recipe many times!  I made this recipe with wheat bread.  Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly, but I left out the salt. Tasted great! My roommate came out of her room saying that the whole place smelled delicious. I think next time I will put some more cinnamon in, and maybe some brown sugar.

Good recipe- I used regular store-bought bread (thin) and soaked it in the liquid for a few seconds each side; next time I'll soak it less b/c it was a little bit soggy.  It still tasted good though.  Next time I will try it with thick bread from the breadmaker!  I also used fresh nutmeg, and the flavor was really strong.  I'll cut down on that next time too.

We use butter in the pan too - love the flavor. I like mine with cinnamon but The Boy won't eat french toast if I add either cinnamon or nutmeg. Maple syrup is a must!!

The batter of this French toast is really good.  I don't know what it tastes like with nutmeg, but I was able to make this without it and it tasted really good anyhow.  I'd like to try it with nutmeg next time.  

Regarding the bread, if you choose to use 6 thick breads, please be careful to choose bread that will not soak up the batter too much.  I used 4 thick raisin loaf slices and I was barely able to finish soaking the last slice with the amount of batter.  But whatever batter each slice soaked up made the bread taste really really good because the flavor soaked in all the way.  Be sure to cook well though, otherwise, I can imagine it being cold and soggy.

Perhaps the bread the recipe called for were for French bread.  I'll have to try with that next time.

My fiancee and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe with a syrup recipe with frozen fruit we found on another website.  

I gave it a four because of the ratio of amount of batter to bread did not even out, but it was delicious, nonetheless.  Thank you.

I followed this recipe loosely because I didn't have the nutmeg or vanilla. So to make up, I used some brown sugar instead. I used thick pieces of french bread, melted some butter with my brown sugar and mixed that with my egg, milk & cinnamon. It was really wonderful, thanks for posting! 

P/S Medium-high started to burn my toast, so I reduced to medium. That just might be my stove, but everyone watch their toast just in case!

I prepared this recipe doubled, with the cinnamon and vanilla but not nutmeg.  It was simple to prepare and delicious; I'll make it again.  I used white sandwich bread because it's what I had (I made this on a whim) and endorse the earlier recommendations of maintaining a hot griddle, not oversoaking the bread, and stirring the mixture between slice dippings to try to keep the cinnamon distributed better.  Next time, I'll be sure to use thicker bread, but the sandwich bread worked out alright.  Thanks, Jan!

The batter was pretty good.  I just wish I had used thicker bread.  I used regular sandwich bread.  It came out really thin.  It made about 10 slices.

The egg to milk ratio is all wrong. Way too much milk. That’s why it’s taking too long to cook for some of you. Half the milk or double the eggs.

This was a simple and easy recipe. I took the suggestion of another reviewer to cover while cooking to reduce sogginess. I think I will only use half cup of milk and one egg next time because I had enough leftover for two more slices...or I might just use thicker bread.

Avery good standard French Toast recipe and method. For anyone wanting to kick it up a notch, add only 1/3rd cup milk, and add in 1/3 cup of orange juice. After dunking the bread, dunk it into a similar shallow bowl full of frosted flakes, whether name  brand of generic. Then proceed to fry as directed, flipping each piece one time. My version adds a nice crunch to the average french toast, and I am certain that any number of other similar ingredients could be used within that basic recipe also.. Experiment!

Very simple and easy.  Made half serving i.e. 3 slices one egg, etc. I used regular loaf bread slices but let the  bread soak too long yielding 2 slices. Also, I set the burner to medium heat (6-7 of 10. Should have set it between 4-5). However, they were still tasty.

This was delicious with all the spices. I learned that French toast is best with old bread. Since I didn't have any,  I put it in the toaster on the low setting. This helps it to not be as soggy. Topped with butter and powdered sugar.

Simple and delicious!  I like to use french bread cut about 1" thick, and I've never had the "soggy" problem described by others.  But then I quickly dunk the bread into the egg mixture, leaving it only long enough to cover the bread. Maybe the use of the word "soak" is confusing to some. I use only about 2/3 of the cinnamon called for and just under 1/2 of the nutmeg indicated.

Awesome simple recipe for French toast! I ended up using 1-week old stale multi-grain bread from Sprout's Farmers market and it worked out perfectly. 

I added some more cinnamon and nutmeg as well as cinnamon sugar to the recipe than called for due to personal taste. I think with seasoning it's all about what you want to taste, and since you're cooking yourself, you can add or take away spices as you like!

The directions were only for a gas stove, and I have electric, but I guesstimated what a medium high flame looks like and settled at 5 on my stove. This seemed like a pretty standard French toast recipe, and that's how it turned out. I used butter flavored Pam and butter instead of oil.

It was pretty good but I added an extra egg and it cooked way better ( faster, more even). My husband loved it and we agreed that french toast will be a new addition to weekend breakfasts.

This is a great recipe. The ratio of egg to milk is perfect as well as spices. I didn't add vanilla b/c I was out. I added brown sugar and used butter instead of oil. Very happy with this recipe!

This is the best recipe ever! I don't change a thing about it! It is sooooo fast and easy to make! I always sprinkle more cinnamon and sugar when it is cooking! I also like poring some maple syrup on it while I eat! I could never get sick of this recipe. I definitely recommend:))))

Loved this recipe,  my husband doesn't like homemade French Toast and he definitely loved this ones!  I used half the nutmeg because of our personal taste.  I eat them only with powder sugar on top and they were yummy!

I followed this directions of this recipe to a T and did not care for it at all. The inside was soggy and the heat was way too high and charred the outside.

This was a great recipe.  I did omit the nutmeg as I don't like nutmeg.  The recipe cooks quickly if you just dip to fully cover both sides.  You should never really soak any French toast as the bread can fall apart.  I used Italian thick cut bread.  It was amazing. We added strawberries, blueberries and banana slices, with maple syrup.  Didn't need to cover with a lid.  Cooked in butter.  Delicious.

This was both creamy and juicy. Delicious! I added extra cinnamon and fried it until both sides were brown and crispy.  I drizzled some honey on it too.

Really wished that I would have read the comments fully before i started because it took forever to get the middles cooked. My boyfriend didn't even finish his cause the middle was so eggy still. He said it would have been fine if it wasn't for that.

The recipe is quick and easy to follow but not sweet at all. Add some caster sugar to the egg mix for better flavor.

Way to much milk. My first batch was to soggy. I had to start over with 1/2 cup milk. With that modification this tasted amazing. I added whipped cream and fresh raspberries on top.

Very good, basic recipe. The second time I made these I was going to double it but only had 2 eggs, so instead I just increased the milk to 1c. to try and stretch the mixture a bit more, and it was still great. Used a sourdough bread and served with real maple syrup, yum!

It's very easy and quick to make, which is nice when you're trying to make breakfast first thing in the morning. It has a lot of flavor (I used all of the "optional" spices and added additional cinnamon than was recommended).

Replace the milk with flavored (I used hazelnut) coffee creamer to make this recipe 100% better. 
I've never been able to ever make french toast taste right, but with some cinnamon, nutmeg, and coffee creamer, I have mastered the art of french toast.

Superlative: fast, easy, tastes great. I used whole grain spelt bread which has a definite savory taste but my 4yo demolished 2 slices, and my 2yo also ate heartily. Our batch cooked quickly because I used a big skillet to accomodate all of the slices and high heat. Thanks!

great quick easy basic recipe. I had some left over french bread from the night before and this quick recipe fit the bill for a weekday morning breakfast for the kids. My kids don't like syrup so this was flavorful enough for them to enjoy it with just a little powdered sugar. I used the electric griddle and it cooked pretty fast.

This was great simple french toast.  A bit heavy on the nutmeg.  Next time I would only do a pinch.

Very quick and easy recipe for French Toast. It was lacking flavor in my opinion, so I added some brown sugar, syrup & butter. This is a once and awhile treat for myself and the guys but so good when we do have it!

Simple, quick, and perfect. If you are getting raw soggy french toast, your heat is too high. How much you use depends on your bread consistency, size, and soaking time. I found it best to drop a piece in, give it a little squeeze, flip it over to egg the other side, and put it in the pan. For my taste, I added an extra bump of nutmeg. Will use this again soon but with a bananas foster topping. Heaven!

Easy, basic recipe I could make with ingredients I had on hand .. I added some fresh orange zest and used 9 grain bread.

Reminds me of french toast from my childhood. I had some homemade thicker and denser bread from a restaurant. I let each piece soak for about a minute. I cooked it on the griddle set at 325 for about 5 minutes each side until golden brown.

Very good and easy. I used Penzey's Apple Pie spice mix (two types of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and mace)for added flavor. 
Will make this again.

Nothing fancy. Just French toast the way mom used to make it. I suggest harder thicker types of bread like the Cinnabon bread.

Just made this recipe as follows, but took the suggestion to coat the pan with butter for extra flavor, added an extra egg, and a pinch of sugar. This was my first time making French toast and it was to die for! Thanks for sharing

It was just okay - I didn't think the flavor was bold enough - but I was in a rush and this looked easy enough. I don't think I'll try again BUT it wasn't horrible.

Overall: Good. I made this for 8 servings, and was left with 1 slice of bread left and not enough mixture for it.. Also, Id suggest not cooking them on such a high heat, that'll allow for the inside to cook a little longer.

Hubby and I enjoyed this, especially the spices. I think my only issue was that I used cheap white bread, which didn't hold up as well as thicker bread would have.

Perfect!! I made it for my daughter and she LOVED it. I used a good loaf of challah bread as the video suggested and it was the best French toast we have ever had. Very easy to make and my daughter asked me to make it again the next day! Thanks for an amazing simple recipe!

I made this over the weekend while visiting my son at college.  His girlfriend and a couple of their friends rated it two thumbs up. Putting the lid on the pan worked great. This is going to be my go to recipe. Thank you.

Good, easy recipe. The only thing I do differently is to add a l'il brown sugar. (It adds to the flavor profile nicely - and you'll need less syrup. *nods sagely*)

Wonderful French toast recipe!  My whole family loves it!  Someone had posted the suggestion to lightly toast my bread before dipping...perfect idea!  I put it in oven at 250 for about 2 min. This guarantees no soggy french toast!

Great...my grandkids like it, my wife, and my daughter in law like it.  Test passed.  I do not add the vanilla.  I do not add all the milk.  Add less milk and it might cook faster. Be patient, add the fruit and maple syrup.  Used whole wheat br. Seems to be a hit right now.

I normally make my family recipe for breakfast, but wanted to try something new and special for my stepdaughter's first day of school.  She didn't even finish two slices.  The nutmeg is extremely strong in this recipe and felt it was missing a little something.  I added another 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1 Tbls of sugar and it evened the taste out.  I don't use nutmeg pretty much ever, so it was probably just an unusual taste.

Really good recipe and easy to make.  I used regular sandwich butter bread and rolled the pieces in a cinnamon-sugar mix before frying them up.  My family thought it was delish!

We just finished eating this for brunch.  It was easy, but the mix did not make enough to coat 6 regular pieces of bread, much less 6 thick pieces.  Next time we will cook it on med. for a much longer time, as it was really soggy in the center.  We did not add the nutmeg, and the vanilla gave it a chemically after taste.  My 12 year old said, let's lessen the vanilla next time. (He actually made the recipe).  We served it with home made raspberry syrup and powdered sugar and paired it with poached eggs.

These french toast are great. I love surprising my girlfriend in the morning before she gets up. To add a splash of excitement to the plate I cut up and fruit i have in slices and neatly place them on the plate. Bona Petite!

This is the best recipe yet! I tried another French Toast recipe last time I made this, but it didn't have enough flavor. This one is great! The nutmeg adds a nice flavor and the soaking mixture wasn't too thick like the last time. I served it with powdered sugar, strawberries, and maple syrup.

This is a very easy recipe to scale down to one serving and makes a delicious, healthy breakfast, especially if you top it with unsweetened applesauce and cinnamon. (I used 1 egg, 3 T. skim milk, 1/8 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract, and 2 slices of 40 calories-per-slice bread)

The recipe is great, minus the nutmeg.  I used less than asked and still had a very strong nutmeg flavor.  Next time, I will eliminate it altogether.

Our family loves this recipe! We make it with french bread and serve it up with Maple Agave Nectar for the syrup and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. Yum! We love making it and eating it together. Definitely a recipe you should try. Enjoy! :)

For me, it was perfect measurements for 6 slices of french bread.  I agree with other reviewer who said to use butter in the pan for flavor.  Perfect taste (I omitted cinnamon and nutmeg).

There was too much milk in this recipe. It made the bread really soggy and took too long to cook. Even after cooking the toast was still too floppy.

I made this French toast to use up some challah bread I had made earlier in the week.  The liquid amount in this recipe was perfect for the thick slices.  I had decreased the amount of nutmeg because I use freshly grated nutmeg, however the nutmeg flavor was still more prominent that we would have liked.

Good stuff, the serving size estimate was spot on. I'm not a huge fan of the nutmeg, but my husband liked the flavor. I may cut down on the nutmeg next time though

Very good!  I used cinnamon raisin bread with no nutmeg.  And I used a lid while cooking to prevent soggy bread as suggested by others.

This is an excellent recipe and very easy.  Consider adding a little dark brown sugar to the recipe.  It does not take much.  Maybe a couple pinches but adds a little layer of sweetness.  Enjoy!

I think this recipe is great and all but it keeps coming out soggy.  It like eating soup with a firm shell. I tried using the lid of the pan. Didn't do much.

Good French toast recipe. I agree that there may be a little too much nutmeg. Just a pinch will do. Also, please note that the recipe says 6 slices...and it means it! I didn't even use thick bread just regular whole wheat bread. So, if you are making this in hopes to maybe squeeze out a few more pieces than it says...you'd probably be better off just upping the size. Overall, very good. I'm usually not very good at making french toast and in my opinion this recipe turned out good. Will probably make again.

Very nice. Easy to make.  I used a whole grain bread and it was hearty and filling.  Even my 6 year old who is picky and very skeptical of anything with 'egg' in it liked it.

This was very good - the best french toast I've ever made, actually!  Per others' reviews, I cut down the cinnamon & vanilla by half, added a pinch of salt, and covered the slices with a lid while they were on the griddle.  Will definitely make again.

Very nice recipe. I have been french toasts but did not the ratio of eggs and milk.  Since I am on diet, I use skimmed milk and sometimes skip egg yolks. I also add 3 tbsps of brown sugar in the batter.    Thank you for such a nice recipe ! :)

This has become our weekend staple. I use a thick raisin bread and everyone seems to love it. I also use a really good vanilla and that seems to make a difference.

Delicious couldn't keep my girlfriend from eating them straight out of the pan. The nutmeg was a very good touch and really filled out the flavor. I used fruit whipped topping powdered sugar and maple syrup to top.

Nice simple recipe, very tasty. Used Challa bread for mine and added a tad bit more vanilla since I like the taste. Popped some honey butter on it at the end. Yum.

Overall I liked the recipe, nice and basic. I used wide whole wheat bread and I was able to stretch it to 5 slices instead of 6.  I would also add more cinnamon next time.

Very good.  Made exactly as described but omitted nutmeg (did not have).  Had enough "batter" left over to cook a few more slices.  Thanks for the recipe.  Ansley

This french toast is pretty good. However, I do suggest covering the pan with the lid, like everyone has been suggesting. I also added a little more than 1/4 cup of sugar to the mixture.

I scaled the recipe because I only had one egg, but I left the spices alone at 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg. I also added about 1/8 tsp salt. It was perfect. If you find this bland, you probably should have added more salt.

I found this recipe excellent. I used thick Italian whole wheat bread. I only got 4 servings though, so would double it next time. Heated fry pan on stove with oil enough to cover pan on high, turned down to 5 and put soaked toast in. They cooked perfectly. I put both spices in and didn't notice much difference in taste so may add a bit more next time. 5 stars for sure. In my recipe box!

I used cinnamon bread which has thinner slices, so I dunked each side quickly before putting it on the hot skillet. It tasted great! I love vanilla so I didn't mind, but my boyfriend thought the vanilla was a bit over powering. I will probably halve the tsp of vanilla next time. Otherwise- we enjoyed it!

Never made french toast b4, but it was so good (the flavor), we had it 2 days in a row!  The second time I made it I used a non-stick pan bcuz with a skillet even with oil the bread stuck to pan.  The egg mixture was only enough for 4 slices of Texas Toast.

Outstanding recipe. The cinnamon and nutmeg make this recipe so much better than versions that just call for vanilla.  This will be a regular breakfast for us now.  Thanks, Jan!

This was the best French toast I ever made! I forgot one cook's suggestion, and didn't put the bread on the griddle when it was really hot, so it stuck. Next time, I will be sure it is hot before doing so. Otherwise, great recipe!

I added 2 table spoons of kaluha.  I also like to butter the pan first and sprinkle cinnamon / sugar mix on each side before flipping.  Delicious.

This is a really really good basic recipe.  It's really easy to tweak little things depending on what you've got in stock at the moment.  I've used hvy cream and it's an excellent substitute.  Be sure and heat up your syrup before pouring on the french toast

I added an extra egg to the mix because I like "eggy" french toast. I recommend adding no more than 1/2 a teaspoon of salt because I made the mistake of adding a whole teaspoon of salt and it was too much! I used thick slices of sweet bread for this recipe and thought it was superb choice.

Overall this recipe was good. My only issue is that it was a little too "eggy" for my liking. Next time, I may try using just one egg, instead of two.

Yum! This recipe gives good coverage for the number of slices recommended. I doubled everything and it was perfect!  This tasted just like the French toast my mom made - my favorite breakfast food growing up (even though we usually ate it for dinner!)

It tasted like your average french toast.  It was good, but not great.  I included all of the optional items.  I tried it at first with just the vanilla extract and the nutmeg added...it was definitely better with cinnamon.  This is a good, solid french toast.

This was pretty good. Cinnamon is the classic addition, but I'm partial to nutmeg. Just be careful that you don't use a heavy hand. Just a little too much of either will leave your guest with a funny look on their face...not that I would know about this of course...

Yum! This is a great recipe for a weekend morning when boring old cold cereal doesn't cut it. The recipe is fairly standard, however, (I think) the vanilla makes it taste extra-special. Perfect with a cup of coffee and the Sunday newspaper.

I used texas toast bread and instead of heavy cream i just used regular milk. I also use the vanilla and add a little bit of sugar to the mix. My husband is a huge french toast lover and loves this recipe!! Thanks for sharing!

Made this out of some Italian bread that had been in the pantry a couple of days past its prime. It was my first time making french toast. I didn't try it but my husband thought it was good, not great. Used all cinnamon rather than combined with nutmeg. I'll keep looking for my ideal french toast recipe.

Very good!  I used whole wheat sandwich bread.  I also used the vanilla and cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg.  Just the right amount of flavor!  I used a little pat of butter to grease the griddle.  I served them with fresh berries and maple syrup.  A side of bacon and some orange juice made this the perfect breakfast for a Sunday morning!

My husband made this for us using Multi-grain bread (which is thinly sliced but dense in texture). It came out very tasty. He didn't like how thin the mixture was--evidently other recipes we've tried have been yielded a thicker mixture. He was worried the bread would be soggy inside, but it wasn't--was perfect :)

Very quick and tasty.  I don't know why these people thought it took so long to cook... I did med-high heat, and turned the heat on before starting to prepare the batter.  Hot pan led to fast results.

Absolutely wonderful classic French Toast recipe everyone must have!! I love the combination of all of the spices (and occassionally will a little clove).  Keep in mind that if you use thinner sandwich bread to lightly dip it, do not submerge for it any length of time or it can turn out soggy (in this instance use a lid to help it cook).   This is definitely a keeper recipe =)

Great Basic French Toast Recipe. I add vanilla butter nut, cinnamon, pumpkin spice, vanilla extract, and orange zest to my batter. AND since I often use sandwich bread, the trick is to "DUNK" the bread, not soak it in the batter, this way it doesn't get soggy.

This was pretty good.  I think I let too much of the liquid mixture soak into the bread because no matter how long I cooked them, they were still soggy inside.  Maybe too much milk??

We thought this was an excellent basic recipe!  Making it the second time around we tweeked it to our liking.  We used 1/3 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of half and half and 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg.  We did use Texas Sliced bread but didn't soak the tar out of them.  We were able to get 9 slices out of the mixture.  We did as recommended, put a lid on the pan while they were cooking and used butter to coat the bottom of the pan.  We topped with Maple Walnut syrup and powdered sugar.  UMMMMM

This was OK. I'd like to give it a 2 1\2, though. It wasn't very sweet (even though we added sugar), and the spices were too strong. It tasted pretty good when it was covered in powdered sugar and maple syrup. Probably won't make this again, because I think everyone would have liked it more if it had been sweeter. Thanks anyway, I was glad to have the experience making French toast.

This was good. I made it as directed, but omited the vanilla because I'm out. I used regular whole wheat bread, and it still turned out great. My kids LOVED it. It only made FIVE pieces, though -- I will definitely double or triple the recipe next time. They were begging for more, but I was out of eggs!

Last time I tried to make french toast I screwed it up royally... I think I let the bread soak up too much mix and I ended up with egg toast.  The way to do it is just to dunk the bread in the mix and put it in the pan.  After about 8 years and ready to try again this recipe was easy, tasty and a definite do again... and again... and again.  It's my husband's favorite breakfast.  I wish I'd tried again 8 years ago!  It's super easy!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used a tbsp of butter for each slice of bread. (I cooked two at a time on a skillet, so 2 tbsp)  I think the butter brings the flavor of the French Toast a little better.  Also be sure to whisk the mixture often because the spices will float and the more its mixed the more even the spices will stick to the bread.  Once again spot on!

I use either Sara Lee Brown Sugar Cinnamon bread or Cinnabon bread to make this simple recipe.  I don't add the nutmeg and it still comes out really good.

I cook them all on my cheap little griddle.  I sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.

I never have any leftovers!  I think using the Cinnabon or Sara Lee bread is really what sells the french toast, but either way, I will look no further than this recipe whenever I make french toast.

Simply recipe. To be able to flip easier, I started with frozen, bread. It still soaks in the mixture well but doesn't fall apart when flipping. Since I used wheat bread, I used 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 2 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp cinammon. I also added 4 eggs and a little diet sugar but no salt. I used a non-fat spray before every batch. Before eating, I just sprayed on a little, fat free butter. Very yummy.

A good, basic french toast recipe. To me, the vanilla is not optional. The only way I got this to work in a regular pan was to use the "high heat" PAM spray in the pan, and to very *quickly* whisk both sides of the bread through the batter. Otherwise my cheap white bread fell apart completely and/or it took too long to cook.

I thought the recipe was a bit bland for my tastes, also the bread came out soggier than I expected it too (I did quick dips in egg/milk mixture to make sure this wouldn't happen)! I added in a lot more vanilla and cinnamon. Ate these with maple syrup. They were good, but I still haven't found the perfect french toast recipe yet!

We actually found this to be a bit bland.  I think that if I make this again, I will increase the cinnamon, nutmeg, and maybe even the vanilla.  I'll probably look for another recipe.

It's a good recipe I just wasn't wowed by it so I didn't feel I could give it 5 stars.  I used whole wheat French bread and it still tasted very good.  I didn't have any nutmeg on hand so maybe that would've kicked it up a notch for me.  I think I probably needed to soak the bread a little more.  There's that fine line between soaking it enough and not letting it fall apart.

This was a tasty basic recipe. I made mine using pretty fresh bread. I did not have nutmeg, so I used ground cardamom. I sprinkled extra cinnamon on it as it cooked. I thought it was pretty tasty. Next time I'll used stale bread. I also cooked mine using margarine. I think the buttery goodness definitely helped the flavor.

This is a great French toast recipe! I used Dutch Hearth sliced French bread and added a little more cinnamon to the egg mixture, omitting the nutmeg. Frying the bread on medium-low heat with a lid on the pan cooks it really well without burning. I topped it off with pure maple syrup, a dash of powdered sugar, and fresh strawberries. I really don't see how you could go wrong with this basic recipe.

This is a perfect french toast recipe.  I use "Jennifer Houde's Portuguese Sweet Bread I" from this site, cut thick.  I have been using this recipe for several years and my family thoroughly enjoys it.  Thank you.

This is perfectly good French toast.  Next time I will use bread that is more stale, so that it's not so soft inside.

GREAT traditional french toast recipe!  Works best if you cook on medium heat and use LOTS of the egg mixture...really put a thick coating on the bread.  It's a keeper!

I've been shopping around for French toast recipes and this is the best that I found.  I prefer mine without the nutmeg and add extra cinnamon.  Great taste.  I prefer whole wheat bread for sandwiches, but a white bread is best for French toast.

Absolutely delicious--tastes just like our favorite local breakfast spot's French Toast.  My husband said it was the best I've ever made, and he's picky!  Definitely a regular in our house on the weekends now.

Excellant base recipe! I add more cinnamon & vanilla extract. I find this turns out best when I use a crusty french bread loaf from the grocery store. Not so great with other breads. Thanks Jan!

Good french toast recipe that is easy to modify to your personal taste.  I used a whole grain bread and it was delicious.  I added a little brown sugar to the egg mixture and I cooked it in butter instead of oil (personal preference).  I also used the pan lid while cooking as other reviewers suggested.

I didn't have any nutmeg so I went without, the flavor was good. I look forward to making it in the future with the nutmeg. I cooked on med-high like suggested but I think next time I will turn it down. My first piece was burnt. All in all, good recipe, great french toast. I supposd I'm a little biased as french toast is my breakfast food of choice. :)

I reduced this recipe to two serving and used 2 eggs, increased the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp. and added a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice.  It was good but I think it could have used more spices.

My husband and kids are big eaters, so I doubled this recipe. All ingredients were doubled except the nutmeg and vanilla. It tasted great! And very easy to throw together for a quick breakfast.

Just like my Mom used to make.  I cooked on the same heat that I use for pancakes and that was a little too low (it wasn't getting browned at all).  I would cook on at least medium heat next time.  Great easy recipe.

It was just average for me. That's if I follow the recipe to the tee. There wasn't enough batter for all slices of bread if I soaked for the specified time and the temperature was too hot for my stove. I agree with other reviews about it missing something but im not sure what.

Excellent!  I used Texas Toast style bread and was able to whip this up for my 2 teenaged sons in minutes.  This is a wonderful 'basic' recipe and should be a staple in everyone's recipe box:).

Very good recipe. I think the problem people have with french toast is its usually too runny/goopy or flat. This is all the egg/milk ratio. At least thats usually where I goof. This recipe worked well for me. Usually I do French Toast using texas toast size bread, but when I tried this recipie I used what I had on hand, regular loaf of supermarket Wonder™ bread. Was not runny or goopy at all, browned well with no smooshieness. .....LOL....I just realized how goofy this review sounds...but how else would you describe french toast gone wrong....LOL....... 5 STARS, WORKS GREAT !!!! TASTE EXCELLENT !!!!

Yummy!  We used regular wheat sandwich bread, which I normally do not like for French Toast, but with the spices and vanilla, I forgot it was wheat bread.  Will definitely make again!

I am not a french toast fan, but my husband thought this was a great recipe.  I followed the advice of others and added a pinch of sugar.  If I make this recipe again, however, I think I will leave the nutmeg out. It is too overpowering.

Very good, I halved the recipe and made two toast with just regular sandwich breads.  I changed it a bit by adding a dash of banana extract to give it a banana flavor, it was wonderful.

A great basic recipe.  I don't think this recipe needs any improvement at all.  I appreciated the other reviewers advice regarding not soaking the bread too long.  I used Pepperidge Farms' Original "Bread with Substance."  My husband said he loved that the bread was thinner than what his mom used to use in her french toast.

This recipe is missing sugar. I thought syrup would be enough sweet, but it is not.  This needs at least 2 tsp of sugar in the mixture before dipping the bread.  I also had to add more cinnamon and vanilla flavoring.

I used pre-sliced thick french bread. It was schmoosy on the inside so cant help thinking it must be undercooked, but it was kinda burnt on the outside-- though it tasted OK, needed lots of syrup.   Maybe it's better on thin slices of bread coz I was able to use just 4 slices and they soaked up all the liquid already.

This was a very good recipe! I used thick slices of french bread and I used everything in the recipe besides salt. I think adding the cinnamon on top of each slice would have been an excellent idea! I'll do that next time:)

Delicious!  Whole family loved it!  I used Texas Toast because I like the bread a little thicker.  Even my picky son who’s not a huge fan of French toast loved it!

My 6 and 8 year old loved these. They also didn’t need as much maple syrup as with pancakes. I made it with Natures Own Honey Wheat bread and it came out great.

Do any of the reviewers on here even have taste buds?

And also, are you using ostrich eggs? Because I made this recipe, and it was the blandest French toast I have ever eaten. To ensure I was sane, i checked out other recipes to get a general feel for the egg:milk ratio, and generally you use 4 eggs per 1-2 quarter cup of milk. Why is this recipe so highly rated?

I don't understand why everyone is having so much trouble, I've been making French Toast like this since I was young. I have tried various types of bread and small additions to the liquid, as well as removing things. Now that I am diabetic I don't make sweet plates like this very often. There are some ways to reduce the sugar and carbs. Today I used sliced white bread,  and used cinnamon,  nutmeg,  cloves, ginger, and honey to the milk and egg mixture. I didn't have vanilla so I didn't use any. Once Cooked I topped with unsalted butter and maple syrup.

should be re-titled "soggy french toast" despite golden brown outer appearance, or perhaps egg and milk soup

pan with lid probably should be included in the cooking instructions

An amazingly simple recipe. I love adding cinnamon and sometimes nutmeg to the batter. I also always use brioche bread for flavor and texture since it has a lot of butter and eggs. My local supermarket has brioche bread with chocolate chips, so that’s always a treat. I personally like drizzling my french toast in maple syrup, honey, or sweet condensed milk.

Ingredients are nice but a tad simple. I added some pumpkin spice, more cinnamon and a tad bit of sugar to give the batter a better more savory taste.

I used fresh brioche from the deli and it was amazing. When I went back, they were out, so I used Sara Lee artesano bakery bread the second time I made this. It was still really good, but nothing compares to fresh bread. The better quality bread, the better the results will be. I don't have nutmeg, so I used pumpkin pie spice as a substitute. I used oil spray for the pan and it did not stick at all. I used powdered sugar and syrup on top.

Nothing special. I was hoping for a knock-your-socks-off recipe, but I guess the search continues for this gal.  It was rather bland tasting. Covering the pan sounded like a good idea, but the middle was still a bit soggy. This took soooo long to cook. I must have used really thick slices of bread (Nature's Own® Perfectly Crafted Thick Sliced White Bread), because this recipe only yielded 4 slices. I fried in butter and only 1/8 tsp of nutmeg. Kitchen smelled divine after cooking, though.

Great tasting recipe.  Love that it only uses 2 eggs and NO SUGAR.   Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Vanilla are great additions.    Also like that it is for 6-9 pieces of bread (depends on size, of course).  Also agree with other comments:  bread should be thicker than pre-sliced grocery bread.  We used french bread, cut on an angle for larger slices.  Fantastic.

I made this and it turned out excellent!  Our 12-year-old son and my wife both said it was better than what we get at our favorite restaurants.

I was out of nutmeg and substituted ginger.  I used the same measurements for the ginger that is called for with the nutmeg.

I'm not understanding the comments saying it "took too long to cook". It literally took all of 15 minutes from prep to actual cook time and I cooked multiple slices of bread. Also didn't have any issues with sogginess. You are supposed to lay the bread in the batter, press once, flip it over and do the same to other side. Should only take 2 seconds to do. You are not supposed to leave it to soak in the mixture. Just get both sides of the bread completely coated that's it. The will automatically suck some of the mixture in, but it won't be soggy. 

For cooking, I used butter instead of oil. Also, the settings on your stove top also matter. These don't need to cook super slow. Put it on medium to high heat to cook. Mine came out perfect in a single go. Let the butter melt and let the skillet get nice and hot before putting the butter. I did not add salt or any sugar, only used vanilla extract, egg, milk and cinnamon. 

Sorry but this is recipe is way too hard to mess up; if you can't get this right then you truly may not know how to cook. If 10 to 15 minutes from prep to finish is too long for you, I don't know what to tell you. 


I topped it with banana slices and spread a little cream cheese on each slice before drizzling the syrup onto it (I was reminded of a place I'd visited in San Francisco where they served cream cheese stuffed French toast which was AMAZING) and bam. Next time, may thaw out some of my fresh frozen fruits and berries just to make it more fun. I LOVE Fre

I made this as is to try, with both cinnamon and nutmeg.  It took no time to put together and was quite good.  Next time out I will add some bells and whistles....icing sugar perhaps, but definitely some fruit toppings to add additional interest and customize to individual tastes.

Good recipe to use. My family loves super sweet French toast so I use a can of condensed milk and cut a little with regular milk. I use a thicker bread and lightly dip due to using condensed milk. I also sprinkle a little more cinnamon on top of the bread  when I add to the skillet. Please use butter and not oil. it makes it taste Soo much better. I didn't use nutmeg as the recipe suggested. I also beat my mixture each time before dipping the bread in because the cinnamon like to rise together at the top. I also preheat my oven to 200 degrees, butter my finished French toast, and wrap in aluminum foil to keep warm while making the rest of the toast.  I hope you like my spin

We made the french toast exactly how the recipe said to make it and it was a squishy mushy wushy mess. My gridle is offended by how big of a mess we made. I feel like we are somewhat intelligent people and yet our french toast was bland, squishy in the middle, and burnt on the outside. Powdered sugar and syrup didn't even fix our breckfast.

It was delicious. I had exactly enough batter for six slices of bread, it cooked quickly and evenly. I added all the optional ingredients, might have been less nutmeg, I grated it directly into the batter without measuring.

Great French toast recipe,. Only had whipping cream, so subbed it for milk. Used panettone for some, regular bread for some. Lots of request for seconds on all. Also, if you’re like me and don’t like eggy flavor, just lightly dip flat on surface on both sides, rather than soaking.

There is entirely too much milk. I made a batch as instructed and the bread was so soggy that it took forever and even on medium heat the outside burned and the inside still dripped. I made a Second batch with half as much milk and it came out much closer to what you'd expect.

Pretty solid French Toast mixture; I'd recommend adding 1/4 cup of brown sugar if you aren't putting syrup in it

Very good! I used bantam chicken eggs instead and cut the recipe in half! Two of those eggs equal about one. The milk made the toast nice and fluffy, but a bit too fluffy! Still very delicious, but I think the two little eggs and splitting the recipe in half made it different than it should have been. I only had to use two pieces of bread, but it was perfect for one person (me)! I will use it again, but maybe use a little less milk! (I also used Strawberry Rhubarb Jam as my topping)

I'm just a husband who rarely cooks (the only breakfast food I knew how to make was scrambled eggs). I made this today for the first time and it came out great--my wife and son happily ate it with me. Great, easy-to-understand recipe.

Way to much milk! There was more milk than eggs. Even added another egg to thicken it up didn't help. I was left with soggy, mushy bread. I'd cut the milk drastically, at least half what the recipe calls for unless you like bread pudding as appose to French toast.

I will make this again!  I like the spices a d I added almond milk, coconut milk us good too! Frying in coconut oil adds better flavor instead of butter, it keeps it from burning  and makes it get crispy.

I used this recipe & days old croissants and they came out superb! My local breakfast place charges $15 for this (including bacon & eggs)and there's usually an hour wait. I made this in the comfort of my home with ingredients I already had on hand. It was soooooo good. Thank you!

This is exactly what I wanted. I used both of the optional ingredients, nutmeg and cinnamon. I also added white confectioners sugar after putting the bread slices on the plate.

I got good results from this recipe, but it only made enough for 4 slices of regular-thickness bread, maybe 5, if you really stretch it.

I’m giving it 3 stars because I think it was my chosen bread that caused it to utterly fail and turn into slop. Also,  flavor was a little light. I’d use far less liquid and more cinnamon next time.

This was my 1st time successfully making french toast at home. Normally I eat it while out to brunch or I pop some French toast sticks in the microwave. My toddler Ms Picky Pants took the first bite and I knew we won once she asked for a second, third, and so forth. 

I used Kroger's Private selection multigrain bread, no nutmeg and subbed a little extra imitation vanilla so that I wouldn't have to make a grocery trip. Also did 3 eggs instead of 2. I only dunked each side for about 3 seconds each and mine took no time to cook contrary to several other reviewers. 

Will definitely make again but will try it with the nutmeg and likely add fruit with powdered sugar.

This was prefect. Not sure about the negative reviews. Basic cooking, for many things, says wait till the pan is hot or it sticks. I didn't soak the bread, I dropped it in, flipped it over, put it in the pan, no waiting. Came out great. Use a dry bread.

The secret to plump french toast as other people have said is to cook this with a lid on, it cooks Faster as well! 
I'm a health nut so, I used sprouted Organic whole grain bread. I did cook it in butter and served it with a dallop for flavor. I also added 1 tbsp. Of raw sugar, I use almond milk, in the place of milk and they turned out restaurant quality.
The tip about dipping the slices fast and not letting them soak too long is spot on. I place them soupy side up in the pan and I believe,  the excess would soak through to the center Even on thicker slices of bread!
Amazing flavor with the Nutmeg!

This recipe is super great. I recommend using a brioche bread for perfect French toast.

I made this and thought it was quite good. I did double the amount of cinnamon it calls for, and I thought it was about the perfect amount. Will be making again!

Awesome sauce!  No changes, my family loved it.  I used day old French bread that my husband bought from Ralph's for 50 cents and I topped it with strawberries and blueberries that were on their way out.

I reserved some of the dry ingredients (after mixing them) and sprinkled them directly onto both sides of the French toast. This helped them all have cinnamon and nutmeg evenly. It was delicious!

This is absolutely delicious! I used to make french toast with just milk eggs and sugar but the cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla extract took it to another level! I would recommend adding one more egg, and also maple syrup tastes great drizzled on top when serving.

I made this for breakfast, and it just wasn’t that good. The nutmeg was a little too much, and I only added a dash. The bread was a little soggy, but that might have been user error. Also, the egg mixture only made 4 slices, and the last one wasn’t as good. If I make this again, I will probably to add nutmeg, and as another reviewer noted, it would be cooked better if I covered it. I would probably probably not add nutmeg, and I would make a little more egg mixture.

I haven't made French Toast in years. I usually eat breakfast alone, but today I had a craving. This recipe was fantastic! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I only got 3 pieces with the full recipe instead of the 6 listed. This was fine, as I said before, I was eating alone. Maybe it was the particular bread I was using? But when I started making just a half batch with the measurements listed, I knew it would not be enough.

Delicious!!!  My family loved it. I also like that there is no sugar in it versus some other recipes. I made it with brioche bread and it just melts in your mouth. Be careful not to have your heat too high so as to cook all the way through. Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe! My dad really liked it, although my mom didn’t like it as much because she usually eats it without pancake syrup and she said it wasn’t sweet enough.

I wanted a simple recipe for French toast, and this fits the bill perfectly.  I used fairly thick bread slices, so next time I'll take another reviewer's suggestion and cover the griddle in order to avoid soggy insides.

Fantastic! I love how Nutmeg and Cinnamon are optional spices and the french toast is still just as good. A thing to take into consideration is after the first batch, you may have to adjust the heat of your stove since the pan has finally heated up!

Outstanding! Made mine with 1/2 and 1/2 because I was out of milk. Used homemade bread and cut off the crust. Possibly the best french toast I'd ever eaten.

I have been wanting to find a solid french toast recipe that didn't just end up tasting like bread dunked in egg, and a recipe that I didn't have to refrigerate for 8 hours.  I used Kroger's French Bread sliced in 3/4 inch slices. I substituted the milk for vanilla almond milk and omitted the vanilla completely. I used all the spices and the only thing I altered was the nutmeg - brought it down to 1/8 of a tsp. I laid the six slices of bread in a 13 x 9, poured the mixture over it and let it sit about 15-20 mins, flipping once to make sure it was coated on both sides.  Cooked it on the stovetop and it was delicious!!

This is a staple in our home! It’s easy and tasty! I don’t change a thing and it always turns out wonderful! (Quick tip: just give the bread a quick dip. If it’s too saturated it’s really difficult to cook all the way through without burning it. If you do happen to over saturate the bread cook on low and cover with tin foil to cook evenly)

We loved this! This will be my new base recipe for French toast. The only thing I did differently was to add more cinnamon (didn’t measure) based on personal preference. Also, I was out of milk so I used coffee creamer instead. Loved it.

Didn't have vanilla extract, so left that out. Followed the rest and it was great! I used sourdough bread. It wasn't thick-cut so I didn't have the problem of it not cooking all the way through. Came out perfect. Put a little jelly and cream cheese on it - voila! Will definitely make again.

Halved the recipe for 3 pieces of thicker white bread.  Just the right amount of mixture ratio for soaking.  Turned out fantastic. I have messed up French Toast a surprising amount of times in my life. I love to cook, but I always seem to get the ratios wrong and the come out metallic tasting or too eggy. This recipe was perfect! No problems at all and it will be my go-to from now on. :)

Each time I make this it is soggy and will stick to the pan or burn before cooking through regardless of time or temperature. The flavor is good, though, but I prefer a crispier toast.

Worked great! I used buttermilk bread. I put the top on the pan for a minute while it cooked and it firmed up well. I also added a lot more cinnamon.

Great French Toast recipe! Easy to prepare and quick cooking time.  I added a little more cinnamon that 1/4 teaspoon, and it brought out the flavor more! This recipe is saved and is a must have for any french toast enthusiast!

I've made this recipe a couple of times and like it very much.  The only difference is that I use a thick pre-sliced Italian bread and leave it out on the counter (lightly covered) the night before.  This slightly "stales" the bread and keeps it from getting too soggy in the egg mixture the next day.

My boyfriend said it was very good! the mixture only coated 4 (as opposed to 6) pieces of bread for me, probably because I used egg-replacement powder, but it still turned out great nevertheless.

Great basic recipe.  Quick, easy and flavorful.  If you are using ordinary sliced bread make sure an lay the pieces out on the rack in the oven for about an hour before cooking though to have a firmer piece of toast.  You can speed that up with a little heat just dry the outsides a skosh.

Great, simple recipe! I added all the spices, and my nine year olds' football team buddies couldn't get enough. Stir before you dunk the bread and just barely dunk it. Double the recipe and do a whole loaf of thick bread.

The recipe isn't nearly enough for 6 thick pieces of toast. I got 3 pieces out of this. Strongly advise doubling for 6.

This is a simple and classic recipe! The only variations I did was to use cinnamon swirl bread instead of regular toast and occasionally if I'm feeling fancy will add real vanilla beans to the recipe. The scrapings from one pod should do it and it adds intense and delicious flavor!

My kids and I watched the video.  We all noticed that the pinch of salt looked like a tsp or more.  My kids started joking that maybe they like a little French toast with their salt.

We didn't use nearly that much salt and the recipe was good.  And we used Brioche bread.

Good recipe, but it was bland even with vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I needed to add more eggs because there wasn't enough batter. I altered the recipe because I had to make 9 slices, but I did my math right.

Made this last minute for my family and everyone LOVED it! Super easy and the ingredients were the perfect combination. I used rustic Italian bread sliced about 3/4" and leftover thick cut white bread and it worked like a charm. I know some complained about cooking time but I found it cooked as expected. French toast always takes longer than pancakes but it's so much better too!! Definitely a new family favorite!!

OK, maybe I am old fashioned and remember too much of the past French toast that I made for my kids and that my mother made for my family. I made this recipe with a lot less milk and still, the egg mixture was too watery. I am used to French toast that the egg mixture actually has a  coating of egg on it. I think the addition of nutmeg and vanilla to the eggs added some nice flavor, but the next time I make this, I will omit the addition of milk. Milk added to eggs works well in scrambled eggs to add to moisture and fluffiness, but I don't think it does anything for French toast that needs a good layer of egg.

Yummy with a couple tweaks. I forgot to use almond milk so I used whole organic milk.  I substituted half tsp. vanilla and half tsp. almond extract for the tsp. vanilla. And I substituted ground cloves for the nutmeg.  We had homemade bread so that made it extra good!

While I was making this dish just a few minutes ago my wife walked into the kitchen and said it smelled like Heaven!  We had some Simple Nature Sprouted 7 Grain Bread and I used butter in the electric griddle.   So Delicious.  You will love it.

This is a good, basic recipe. I used wheat bread and left out the nutmeg. I thought this had a little too much milk to egg. I usually use 1 egg per 2 pieces of bread. It turned out fine though. I guess it all depends on the size of your eggs and the thickness of your bread.

A very easy recipe to make such a simple meal for breakfast or any time of the day. My one disclaimer would be that the French toast seemed a little bland to me, although I did the exact measurements. Other than that, it cooked extremely fast and it tasted great once I added a little more ingredients.

I am writing this review for two reasons. Firstly, because it was the perfect balance of ingredients. I used cinnamon bread.
Secondly, I wanted to put a review on Allrecipes that was from this decade. lol

The only French toast recipe you ever need! I've been making this recipe for my family for a year and it is as tasty as any brunch spot in the city. We like to add a little extra milk and cinnamon, but it is also delicious as is.

This is a nice, easy, versatile recipe.  I added a bit of fresh ground pepper to the mix (I didn't use the items marked "optional" and my husband enjoyed the result.  I think it needs frequent turning so that it doesn't burn.

This recipe is perfect with thick slices of sourdough bread. I love that it doesn't have any sugar in the egg mixture. It cooks crisp and goes perfectly with a little maple syrup. I fried it in half butter and half oil. Both adults and kids love it. This is my go to recipe from now on!

Amazing it was quick and delicious! I'm 15 and people that are saying that it took way too long or didn't come out right y'all did something wrong. 
I cooked this for my family a couple of times and nothing went wrong but the first time it was ripping then I found out you have to keep applying more vegetable oil. Can't wait to cook this for my Future wife and kids! :)

This recipe is very simple to make. The vanilla adds to the taste that makes it really special.

Simple and good -- not too egg-y; I followed the recipe, but didn't use nutmeg. Perfect with thick "Sliced French Brioch" from Trader Joe's!

MMMM...so good. Used Texas Toast so  I doubled the recipe and spices except for nutmeg.  Left that the same.  Covered the pan while cooking and the French toast came out perfect!

This was my first time making French toast so I made according to the recipe for the first few slices. I sampled them with warm honey (very good) but since I had some batter left, I decided to experiment by cutting some thick-sliced Italian bread into sticks and adding about 2 teaspoons sugar and about 1 tablespoon Triple Sec to the remaining batter. So good and no need for any toppings! Great base recipe. Will be using this recipe again, with or without modifications.

This was a great recipe. I added a pinch of salt for taste and it seamed to really bring out the vanilla and spices. It was delicious.

Just like my dad used to make us when we were kids. It take as a little bit a patience because it doesn't cook through as fast as a pancake but it was worth the wait. I cooked it on a griddle and topped it with butter and maple syrup.

This is a keeper.  I used a bit of oil for the second batch as the spray oil I used didn't keep it from sticking a little in the pan.  I used 4 slices of bread and the batter was gone.  Wasn't enough for 6. slices of bread.  I would change the recipe a little the next time so I have enough for 6 slices.  I used simple white bread from the grocery store and it does have a tendency to soak up the batter really fast so that may be the reason.  Other than that - very enjoyable and hubby liked.

This was yummy! I made it this morning & it was a big hit.  I doubled the amount of cinnamon called for (we love cinnamon) and added a pinch of salt. I also replaced a little oil with butter in the pan (a trick I learned from my mother). It adds flavor & the butter is less likely to scorch when combined with the oil.

This is the third time I've tried the french toast receipe and it's turned out perfect every time. I use the Sarah Lee Artesano bread.  The only thing I have added this last round is 1 table spoon of brown sugar.

It was pretty bland so added a bit of white sugar and that made a huge difference. I'll probably make it again.

Great basic recipe you can adjust any way you like to your own tastes. I recommend the Texas toast instead of thinner bread, and like some others I just dip long enough to cover both sides and never have a problem with a soggy middle. My own little trick is to cook it in a little bacon grease! Not the healthiest, I know, but it does add a great flavor without overwhelming.

I made this with Challah bread and didn't add nutmeg because I don't have any in the house.  It is a very easy process.  I don't like spending a lot of time in the kitchen and this was perfect.

Perfect french toast. I do use 3 eggs for 6 slices of bread. ( My formula is 1 egg for every 2 slices of bread. ) I shake the cinnamon on the french toast while it cooks as I find it clumps in the egg mixture.

The toast wasn't that bland. It was ynder cooked so rather than just golden brown at medium high it should have been golden brown, firm at medium low.

This recipe is gloriously simple, yet tastes superbly superior to the usual cereal and milk. Gals, if you wanna impress all yo frands after that brilliant sleepover birthday party in less than ten minutes, this is the recipe for you. We skipped the salt and added a dash of maple syrup to our version. Not gourmet, BUT SO. MANY. NOMS.

I love what the spices do for the overall flavor, but the second time I made this recipe I deviated. I added a scoop of unflavored whey protein to the batter and used orange extract instead of vanilla, each slice was delicious and packed more than 10 grams of protein.

Used this recipe for more than 10 years with different bread. Always worked. Some time just egg & milk, sometimes with all ingredients indicated in the recipe. This morning I made it again and felt obligated to say: Thank you!

This was AMAZING! Thought I had to add flour to make it fluffy, but this recipe does that just fine. I substituted syrup for honey (waay less sugar), added strawberries and blueberries (added a nice fresh taste), and ate it with pork breakfast sausages and scrambled eggs, just to make the t more filling.

The french toast is just plain toast, barely tasting like french toast, and it took too long to cook for french toast. I do not recommend this recipe.

Great recipe, but hubby hates cinnamon in french toast. This will be my base for french toast, minus the cinnamon.

I tweaked the recipe a bit. For instance, I added 2 tablespoons of sugar (I used brown), and I didn't use any nutmeg. Also while cooking, I pressed down the top to ensure that it would cook properly on the inside.

Good, but recommend using raisin bread, as well as a little sugar and less nutmeg in the mix.

Found this recipe and was enjoying French toast in under 5 minutes. Tasted great! I followed the recipe, but skipped the nutmeg and added a little bit of regular sugar.

This recipe came delicious. I used Arnold country white bread and I got 7 slices out of this batter recipe. The only thing is next time I will probably cut the nutmeg in half and add a little extra cinnamon. It wasn't bad, but it was very nutmeg-forward.

Great foundation for french toast. If you are using the standard off the shelf loaf bread, leave it out overnight or for a couple of hours before dipping, it will stay 'puffy'. I add an additional egg, a shot of vanilla, a shot of sugar and cinnamon in the mix. (I didn't use the nutmeg)

Quick and easy, with a gourmet taste. I used pumpkin spice whole grain bread with it and the optional spices in the recipe complimented the bread. It was the perfect fall breakfast! I was able to make 8 pieces of toast versus the 6 listed in the recipe, though the bread was of typical thickness.

I always go to this recipe when I'm looking for a quick french toast breakfast for family. I make as directed and always use the vanilla that is "optional." (Vanilla is NEVER optional in this house!) The only note I have is I typically get at least 8-10 pieces of bread per batter. I suspect people who say this takes too long to cook are soaking their bread too much. I just toss the bread in on one side, flip it over and immediately place in a hot, oiled griddle. I've never had a problem with it taking long which is good because my boys are not very patient ;)

Pretty tasty! Try using a little honey instead of syrup for a healthier option. Also, frying in coconut oil gives a nice crunchy finish!

This is not good. Egg sticks to both sides of the bread and you end up with scrambled egg bread.

I used a loaf of English muffin bread for my toast. I read some stating these took forever to cook. They cooked super quick for me and this was not an issue. Others stayed to do a quick dip then cook to avoid them being soggy. Again, not an issue. I found with my thicker slices the mixture may have needed longer to soak in and get to the middle. Overall it was very delicious. I would definitely make these again.

This was a really good French toast recipe. I had to use banana extract instead of vanilla because it was what I had but it turned out amazing!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I liked it, but instead of using a slice of bread to dip, I used bagel thins. In the mixture I added some pumpkin pie spice. And after pan frying them, I put a 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon and a tablespoon of sugar and made cinnamon sugar, then sprinkled that mixture on the bagel thins

Not mindblowing, but really yummy and a great weekday breakfast for me and my little one!

I'll probably show this recipe to my husband and he'll add something to knock it up a notch. :) I'll edit my review if he does!

Made this for the family. Everyone loved it. I was a little liberal on the spices and vanilla and it turned out great. Dusted them with powdered sugar as a finishing touch.

We enjoyed this french toast recipe after a few changes.  After starting with ? cup milk + 2 x-large eggs I found the mixture to be too liquid-y.  So I added another x-large egg. I omitted the ground nutmeg and probably used more like ¾ - 1 tsp of cinnamon (I didn't measure I just kept shaking it in), I used ½ tsp vanilla extract, pinch of sugar, and whole wheat regular bread.  I got 10 slices and still could of easily gotten 2-3 more out of the mixture.  I cooked mine on a griddle 350-400F, until it browned on both sides.   I noticed some commented the inside of the bread was soggy, I'm unsure if it's because they used thick bread or if they allowed it to "soak" into the bread.  I quickly set bread into mixture flipped once and immediately moved to griddle.  I did not allow it any time to "soak".  Eating the bread by itself with no topping was very bland, but once it was topped with pure maple syrup, it was satisfying.  Next time I will reduce the milk - probably starting with ? cup and adjusting as necessary.

A good, basic French toast. I used this recipe because the ingredients were easy to track for my food diary. The only issue I had was that the egg mixture needed to be doubled to get all of the bread covered. I didn't even use thick bread, just Kirkland multigrain that I needed to use up.

WONDERFUL recipe!  I doubled the cinnamon (leaving out nutmeg) & doubled the vanilla just becaise I like them a lot. With or without powdered sugar, this is yummy! I used whole wheat bread.  You can really olay around well with this super great basic recipe!  Oh yeah, I made these in a skillet w lots of real unsalted butter.  Yes you do need a hot skillet so they won't stick. I had left over "batter" though I soaked the bread so I poured the rest over thr top of them in the skillet. It's better than oversoaking them and they falling apart before you get them into the skillet.

These turned out so good! I made them for Mothers Day and everyone loved them! I bought thick cinnamon swirl bread for French toast and used a little bit more cinnamon than the recipe called for. I also omitted the nutmeg and salt.  I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top for decoration and then ate with syrup and made a fresh blueberry compote. Will definitely make again! Thank you for the great recipe!

I love french toast, but couldn't remember the basic spice combo, so I found this one. I made a few adjustments, omitted the vanilla as I was out, added a dash of white sugar to give it some sweetness, and omitted the salt for diet reasons. Absolutely LOVED the end results. Thank you for sharing!!

Basic and good. (I add a l'il brown sugar, too: extra flavor and I find I need less syrup.) It's great with wheat or Italian bread - but I really dig it with Jenny Lee cinnamon bread. And that size is perfect for toaster reheating.

O, I forgot to add, I used regular bread, which the mixture made 1 slice rip, so using a thicker bread is best. I just read that in another review too.

All about the bread you use.  Tasty, simple recipe.  Will make again for sure.  Maybe lessen the nutmeg amount.

I read the reviews, so seeing that this was a very basic recipe, I ramped it up a bit, using half & half instead of milk, adding vanilla, and putting pumpkin pie spice directly onto the bread as it cooked to ensure that the spices didn't end up suspended in the egg mixture. The flavor was OK, but still relatively bland. It wasn't awful, but I will try a different recipe next time--one with a bit more personality in the ingredients.

This was a fabulous and quick recipe that I made for dinner on a snowy night. I used thick sliced bread made for French Toast. It cooked perfectly at a medium heat vs medium high. I added butter to the griddle instead of oil, which gave the toast a nice flavor. My family truly enjoyed this recipe so I will definitely be making it again be it for breakfast or dinner!

Very good but a little bland for my taste.... yes I know you add syrup too it but still. I added about a Tablespoon of sugar to the recipe (maybe a little more). The sugar helped make the crust more crispy and taste so good. I will make again!

I made this recipe this morning.  I had never made French toast before, so this was a total gamble for me.  But, I had all of the ingredients, the recipe went very quickly.  My only substitution was using lactose-free milk (because my son is lactose-intolerant) and I loved it!  

Thank you, this was very, very easy, and quite tasty!  Will definitely make this again and again!

This is a great, simple French toast. Has the right combination of spices that I was looking for. I doubled the recipe and used a loaf of day old French bread sliced 1" thick. The bread did not fall apart at all despite being soaked overnight. Instead of cooking on stovetop, I preheated my oven to 400, left a seasoned baking stone in during preheat and tossed these onto the hot stone for 3 minutes. I turned them over and baked for another 3 minutes and they came out great. Thank you for the recipe.

I was craving something sweet and thought-- FRENCH TOAST! I've never made it before nor have I craved it after a great workout! bad idea, you say? Maybe, but I was on a mission to eat some.I followed recipe to the T. The first slice soaked up too much of the ooey goodness, so I figured the bread I used was just too poruous. I laid off the super soaking method so second slice came out great. My only other dilemma is I discovered I really h-a-t-e nutmeg...next time I'll omit this optional item, mhhh key word, right?! Live and learn. Enjoy!

This is a good recipe. It is simple to make and it uses ingredients that we always have in our kitchen.  I thought the prescribed amount of nutmeg sounded like a little too much so I only used half the amount.  The result was very tasty.  Make sure you leave the toast on the griddle long enough to cook all the way through.

My whole family loved this.  I used a loaf of fresh baked white bakery bread that I cut into thick slices.  I didn't use any nutmeg.  I followed the cover-with-a-lid advice halfway through cooking.

Delicious recipe, I used the recipe as is with the spices and no salt, I then took the sweet cornbread cake that I had left over and cut 4x4 squares and cut these in half down to about an inch thick pieces.  The only problem was I didn't have enough bath to allow to soak the last piece.  In the future I will double the recipe for the 4 slices I made.  This turned out awesomely and I will definitely make it again.

I woke up this morning wanting French Toast for breakfast. Not quite sure how to make it I looked up this basic recipe and found it to be very good. However, I used heavy cream instead of milk or half & half. I will definitely use this recipe again, but perhaps add a bit more cinnamon & nutmeg to boost the flavor a little. Thanks for sharing!

Very nice. I didn't have nutmeg so added allspice. Cooked in a bit of real butter, added a tad more butter to cooked toast, sprinkled powdered sugar and used sugar free syrup. Fulfilled my craving for French Toast.

This was so easy to make. I used regular white bread and You can't let the bread soak because it'll fall apart. It was very good and my husband, who is very picky, loved it. The flavor pops in this recipe;)

I've noticed a fee people complaining that it "took too long to make." To those who have that concern: The best food does take time! 

That said, this was absolutely amazing. I used some homemade bread, cut into thick slices. Absolutely amazing. Everyone loved it. The next time I make homemade bread, I'm definitely setting a big chunk aside to do his again.

I had just made a white cake, so I had 4 egg yolks that I didn't want to go to waste. I had some french bread on hand too, and decided to try this recipe.

I left the 4 yolks and didn't add any more eggs.  It turned out excellent! I also found out that I was out of vanilla after I already mixed everything else together, and it was still very good. Definitely a keeper! :)

I make this with either those thin multigrain bagels or french bread. Sprinkle a little extra cinnamon on the top while it's in the pan and cut up bananas to put on top! Yumm.

I was looking for a last minute, simple French Toast recipe and found exactly that in this one! It was so quick to put together and very tasty!! I changed the servings to feed 6 but other than that followed the recipe exactly and the family gobbled these up quickly! Will use again!

These were good, although instead of eating this with berries I made some Apple-Cinnamon Crepe filling to place onto of the french toasts and a little honey with a sprinkling of confectioner's sugar :) ... one work ... Yum :)

Delicious! I had already started making my french toast and already cracked 3 eggs and it turned out great. I might have used a little less milk too. Maybe that is why it wasn't too soggy as some have said. I also LOVED the nutmeg flavor!

This was my first time making french toast so I was a bit "concernedd",lol. I didn't have any vanilla extract so I substituted it with maple syrup (spoon for spoon), and they turned out great! A new favorite for me! I wish they were just a tiny bit less soggy, but it wasn't so bad. Try it and you'll love it!

I used this recipe to get the egg/milk ratio right and it worked perfectly to use up my cinnamon sourdough bread. The bread was dry-ish because it was a week old, so maybe that's why it didn't turn out soggy at all and the batter lasted for way more than 6 pieces. Thank you! I have my go-to frenc toast recipe!

This is a great simple recipe. There was a lot of nutmeg flavor, but I don't mind it. You could easily get away with not using the nutmeg or maybe just 1/8 tspn for those who aren't big fans of it. If you plan on actually soaking the bread in this mixture, I suggest doing 1.5 times the recipe or even double it up. I just lightly coated and it only took a few minutes on each side on a hot pan!  Otherwise, this was fast and delicious.

I used 12 slices french bread and multiplied the rest of the recipe by 1.5. Next time I would use less nutmeg.

I'm not usually a big french toast person, but I had some stale italian bread and an overabundance of eggs, so I figured I'd try this recipe.  It was delicious!  I cooked them in butter in a cast iron skillet and topped them with ripe banana slices, fresh blueberries, whipped cream, and Vietnamese cinnamon.  So good!!!

This is an absolute keeper. It's my all-time favorite french toast recipe!! I've made it a few times with leftover french or sourdough. I don't use the cinnamon (didn't seem to make much of a difference) and I LOVE the nutmeg flavor... it's strong but really delicious. I also made it with sweetened cocoa powder for a friend, it was good too!

I don't know what I am doing wrong, but I cook my french toast on medium low and really low but they still come out burnt! I have a hard time actually tasting the goodness of these things at home...:(

Very easy & simple. I loved the flavor. My son practically inhaled it! I should have read some of the reviews first so that I would have known to cover it cuz the inside was a bit soggy. Next time I will try to use thicker bread or possibly french bread. I can't wait.

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  I used 1/8th tsp nutmeg and I used Hawaiian bread found in most deli sections, that way I could cut it to my desired thickness and it is just a little sweet. This is going to be my french toast recipe from now on.

Delicious.  I used french bread, so I added one more egg and a bit more milk.  I Will definitely continue to use this as my standard French Toast recipe.

This turned out really really good.  I think I may have put in a little more cinnamon and nutmeg I also put in a pinch of salt.  Its nice to have an actual french toast recipe instead of wingin it like I usually do!

Turned out ok, I had to make extra batter due to the thickness of my bread.  I bought bread from the bakery at the grocery store and slice how I thick I wanted it.  Also, I will turn the heat down a bit next time as the french toast cooked fast.

This is quite similar to the recipe I have made for years. The only difference being the nutmeg, which I found very tasty.  Next time I will use ground cloves as well which was suggested by several of the reviewers.  A great basic recipe.  Thanks, Jan!

Very good basic french toast recipe. It was a little milk-heavy though; be careful how long you soak the bread so it doesn't get soggy/take a long time to cook. But overall good flavors--really liked the addition of vanilla.

I have made french toast for years but it was never as good as this. I omitted the salt & upped the eggs to 4 and milk to 3/4 cup to make 11-12 slices. 5 year old twins & 2 year old gobbled it up, even my husband raved about how good this was.

This was very good French Toast! I added just a little more cinnamon to the dipping batter, because my family loves cinnamon, and it turned out great. I made a half-batch, and it worked very well. Thanks!

This is absolutely the best recipe for french toast!!  The kids are always begging me to make it.  They love it. I usually only make it on Sundays, but I make extra and freeze it so they can eat it later on in the week.  Thanks!

I made this recipe this morning. It was really tasty!! I used thick slices of egg bread and added the cinnamon and vanilla and left off the nutmeg. Will definitely make again.

This is very similar to my own recipe. As a note to others, instead of soaking the bread in the mixture, dip both sides of one slice of bread so as to coat it but not become saturated! Also, try adding a bit of almond extract with the vanilla. This is one of those recipes that doesn't really need a recipe. ;) Make it your own! Also, if you think it needs to be sweeter... sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Very tasty, might recommend using bacon grease as the frying medium for that all encompassing comfort food taste!  Getting the toast crispy took some fine tuning in the cook process, but the flavor and aroma in the house was great!

I love this recipe! I used a brioche loaf and sliced it myself. I added some margerine to my cooking surface to prevent sticking. The balance of spice and texture was great and the brioche added an amazing richness.

I made this using 4 slices of Texas Toast which used up all the egg/milk mixture-perfect for 2 people. I omitted the spices and my husband said it was the best french toast he ever had. I served it sprinkled with powdered sugar and warmed maple syrup.

Good french toast! Reminds me of my mom's version (she made french toast a LOT when I was a kid). I am not a breakfast person. Don't get me wrong... I love breakfast foods. I just can't stomach them early in the morning so I usually end up skipping breakfast alltogether. My bf has had a taste for french toast lately, so I decided to whip up a batch for us. Boy I'm glad I did! This was delicious!!! My only complaint was that a couple of my slices of french toast were a tad soggy in the middle (totally my fault). I should have "lightly" dipped my bread slices in the egg/milk mixture instead of "sumberging" them... I ran out of the egg mixture after dipping only 4 slices!!! To compensate for the sogginess, I browned everything really well (turned the heat up to high). One thing to note: Be sure to use thick bread for best results (I used Texas toast slices). Oh, and use all of the spices called for, including the vanilla. It REALLY makes a difference. Served with sausage links and fresh orange juice, this made for a very filling meal to start our day. Thanks for sharing :)

Really good stuff here. Little soggy for the first time but still good. One hint would be - Dont dip all your bread if they wont all fit in your skillet. Like I said this was my first time making this.

When I was a kid my dad used to make french toast every once in a while and I loved it. This recipe is a notch better in that it didn't turn out "dry" like dad's did (Sorry Dad). Quick and easy!

I made these this morning and they were excellent.  I changed nothing.  I used some homemade bread I had made yesterday.  The bread recipe is the Amish White Bread recipe from this site.  YUM! YUM!  I hate french toast too!  I think these would be great with some chopped sugared pecans on top.  I'll try that next time!

I'd never tried adding nutmeg to french toast before now, and it was pretty good! It gives it a little extra flavor. Yummy.

This was a great and simple recipe.  I grew up eating French Toast prepared this way and forgot the ingridients until finding it on this website.  I added a little non-dairy creamer (powder) and a tablespoon of sugar.  It was decadent!

My husband made these for brunch yesterday. He was a little nervous so he turned to allrecipes ;-) I thought these were good enough to make sure the recipe was saved to my Recipe Box. Definitely use butter instead of oil. He used thick Texas-toast style bread, and we kept them warming in the oven while we waited for brunch to start. Good stuff!

We did not like this recipe. With only 2 eggs and 2/3rds cup water, the batter was very runny. The taste wasn't very good either. My kids ate them after drowning in syrup, but did not ask for seconds.

Absolutely amazing. I garnished them with powdered sugar to give it a finished look. Served with fresh fruits. Looks and tastes awesome. Great way to start the day. (weekend in my case)

I used 2 large eggs and found that it was only enough for 4 pieces of bread (as oppose to  6 pieces stated in the recipe). The amount turned out okay but if I were to make 6 pieces next time I will use 2 extra-large eggs, or 3 large eggs.

This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious!  A nice basic recipe.  I make this about twice a week as French Toast is my favorite breakfast food.  Sometimes I make it with the cinnamon and nutmeg, sometimes without.  The vanilla adds a nice kick to it, with or without the cinnamon and nutmeg.

I made this with 1/3 cup heavy cream and 1/3 cup soy milk cause it's what i had on hand and it turned out GREAT!  i used a French baguette as the bread and it was restaurant quality.  i'd never tried to make French toast before and i will definitely make this again since it was so easy and delicious...

The first batch I made stuck to the bottom. I think I crowded too much bread in the pan. My second batch turned out great. I used butter instead of oil and added extra cinnamon. The majority of the spices will stick to the first piece of bread, so sprinkle some extra cinnamon right on the bread after dunking to make sure each piece is flavorful.

I didn't follow the proportions exactly, just used the same ingredients (except for vanilla and salt) and those were a tasty variation to our usual family recipe.  Loved the nutmeg & will definitely do again.

Delicious. I've made the toast twice now, and both times it was fantastic. I read someone's comment that it took too long to cook, but I didn't have that problem. The secret it, make sure your griddle is hot before putting the toast on it. I also cooked it in butter, which added a flavor element, and the nutmeg gives it an extra something. NICE!

Great flavor, but took forever to cook.  I cut a french loaf into small normal bread size pieces and it still took almost a half an hour to fry up four pieces.  Would be great with some baked apples with cinnamon and apple butter.  Overall, very good recipe.

Wonderful! We used all the spices and with a nice thick wheat bread and it was sooo yummy. Also tried with regular sliced white bread I just did a quick dunk with these and it turned out great and wasn't soggy! When they were done we sprinkled some powdered sugar on top added a little whipped cream and syrup it was to die for!

This was a very nice recipe.  I really think you need the spices.  I am giving it 4 stars because I didn't really care for it my husband and children gave it 2 thumbs up.  I think I may have used too thick bread for my taste! :)

Very good.  I made this with low-cal bread which is thinner than regular, but it still tasted really good.  I also didn't add the salt in because I hardly ever add salt to anything.  Will make again with thicker bread to see if it makes the difference!

Great recipe - I loved the spice combination with the vanilla. Better than just plain french toast. My son couldn't get enough.

This recipe is very simple and easy to make. I always make sure that the pan is hot before adding the toast. I also cook on med heat with a lid on it. When the eggs start to turn white on one side then flip over. It wont be soggy using this method.

This is my favorite french toast recipe. I use egg beaters, sugar free syrup and splenda for a low fat, low calorie version.

I don't usually eat French Toast but my boyfriend loves it and begged me to make him some. I used this recipe and he loved it, and surprisingly, I liked it too. I love the cinnamon and nutmeg in it. Tastes great!

This is a nice old fashion recipe.  These taste like the french toast my mom used to make me as a kid.  My kids are loving them. Thanks for sharing. I followed the recipe with no changes.

This recipe is easy and basic.  I used fresh cranberry-walnut bread from a local bakery.  I also mixed it up the night before to let everything soak in, but you MUST use a lid while cooking if you do this.  The lid helps get every piece cooked thoroughly, and not as soggy.  Great recipe!

Delicious recipe. I used low fat half and half instead of milk and soaked the bread for about 4-5 minutes. After cooking I served it with maple syrup and fresh raspberries and peaches. Soo good.

Yum - a good, solid French toast recipe. The spices and vanilla were a nice touch. To make it healthier, I skipped the syrup and put sliced fresh peaches and bananas on top... didn't even miss the extra sugar!

Tried this the other night with some left over french bread.  Not really impressed it was ok, but not really different then the french toast I threw together before.  I was hoping it would taste like a restaurant, but not even close.

Extraordinarily mediocre. Followed the recipe exactly, using plain white bread - results just okay - edible with enough butter & syrup, but I won't make again.

I'll give this 3 stars.
I really didn't think it was anything special at all. It cooked fast enough for me. I used regular sandwich bread, and there were no soggy middles. It just didn't have the sweetness or flavor that I like about french toast.

I always use egg bread "Challah" when making french toast.  This was passed down from my grandmother and probably further than that.  Try it.  You'll love the results!

Sadly, I'm only able to give this three stars.  It's not that good. I was hoping it would be flavorful as is. I'm not giving up on it though. It turned out very pretty, it didn't stick at all (I buttered the pan) and I just knew it would be tasty. I will try to make it again, except next time I'll add more of the seasonings, especially the cinnamon, as some of the other members have suggested.

Tastes just like the french toast at our local restaurant.  The only "problem" I have is that the cinnamon kind of floats on the top of the batter and your first couple of slices are more cinnamony than others, even with lots of stirring.  I've made this as written and without nutmeg, I prefer it without the nutmeg.

My first time making french toast and it came out great.  I doubled the cinnamon and threw in some brown sugar in place of nutmeg.  I'll make this one again.

This was so bland! I had to add more cinnamon, and sprinkle it with a lot of powdered sugar in order to make it even half-way tasty. I definitely won't be making this again.

Some had complained about blandness, so I added 1 T sugar, a few drops of coconut extract, rum extract and butter extract.  Turned out fine, but nothing great.  Husband said "Good, but add brown sugar next time."

This was excellent! I used Texas Toast instead of plain bread. I also used the cinnamon, vanilla, and just a little nutmeg. I dusted the top with powdered sugar and poured maple syrup over them.  My hubby and my 10 month old son gobbled it up. I only got a little taste but it was delicious. Thanks for a great recipe. This is definately a keeper=)

My husband thought this was 5 stars but he LOVES french toast and would rate any french toast 5 stars. I thought it was good, but nothing made it special. It's a handy go to recipe when you want traditional french toast.

Yummy!  Perfect the way it is and great for adding your own additions to.  Just made it with raisin/cinnamon bread, topped with powdered sugar and served with turkey bacon.  Very good served all together and eaten as a sandwich!

This was the be all and end all of French Toast!!  I changed NOTHING in this recipe and it came out awesome!  I was even a bad girl and fried it up in butter, rather than my usual healthy cooking spray.  My 3yr old said it was the best breakfast she's ever had.  That's a rave!  For me, this recipe was like my grandmother's french toast.  Filling, tasty, and just perfect!

This really makes regular french toast really good. I didn't have a problem with the nutmeg, but my husband does. I just sprinkle a little bit of nutmeg now.I add the seasonings to a lot of things now. I have made GERMAN PANCAKES WRITTEN BY BREN and I had the spices from this french toast to it. Really good!

What a quick, impressive breakfast! I made the Bread Machine Challa I last night and used it for the toast this morning. I used less nutmeg, but I wanted more cinnamon taste. I also added a few drops of almond flavoring.

I don't generally like homemade french toast and this was awsome! Restaurant Quality! I diddn't add any salt, and I used Sugar Free Whole Wheat Bread because that's what I had. I also cooked it in Smart Balance Margarine instead of oil. My 14 month old daughter had 2 slices!!

great basic recipe!  I made this last weekend to get rid of some slices of bread and it was delicious.  I had never made french toast before and prob. only ate it once before, myself, so I didn't know you only "dip" the bread and not "soak" the bread, so to avoid the "running out of mixture" prob. that other people had i put the bread in a pan and poured the mix overtop.... it sat for a while and I was told that "it will be no good!!" but it was awsome.  I think i like my french toast crispy and warm with a soft centre.  I was OK with that... and so was my critic! yummy!

This is just like how I have always made French toast. The only difference is I use less milk to reduce sogginess. My son LOVES this!!

One of the best I have ever had. I used Texas toast. Let the mixture marinate for atleast a couple of hours, the spices blend really well.

Easy, quick, and delicious. I used cooking spray instead of oil.  I don't like soggy french toast, so instead of dunking the bread (used white bread), I basted each side lightly with the egg mixture.

Not bad, but I think it's missing something. My roommates seemed to like it, though. I'll probably try again with a bit more spices/vanilla. Thanks!

I thought that this recipe was going to be great because of the 5 star rating, unfortunately I felt that is was missing "something." I used all of the spices, although they said optional and it was still lackluster. Thanks anyway Jan.

Overall this was great!  I used all of the cinnamon, a little less nutmeg and a little less vanilla and thought it had very good flavor.  It wasn't overpowering at all and in fact could have used a little more nutmeg/vanilla.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I used pretty thick slices of home made, multi-grain bread and they tasted just like normal bread in the middle - no flavor from the mixture.  So they should have been soaked briefly instead of the quick dip.  But I will definitely make it again!  Then I topped with a hot syrup mixture that I made in the same pan afterward - 1/2 c syrup, 1 T butter, 1 T light rum and a pinch of salt.  YUM!

This recipe was really great.  I didn't have any milk on hand, but I did have some 1/2 and 1/2 so I used a 1/3 c of half and half w/ about two tablespoons of water.  I put powdered sugar and maple surup on top. YUM!  my husband loved it too.

I never eat/make french toast but one morning I had a yen for it and made this recipe. It is so simple and it was just perfect. The whole family, even one year old baby devoured it.  I added vanilla extract. I used some strange health bread we had and still was just delish! I went a little crazy "dunking" bread and the bread broke apart so beware there, and yes keep mixing batter to keep your spice ratio the same on each piece of bread you dunk.

This french toast turned out great! I used whole wheat sandwich bread and had more than enough mixture for 6 slices. I sliced two bananas lenthwise and then in half (making 8 banana slices) and soaked them in the remaining mixture. I then placed them in the buttered pan to cook alongside the french toast. When everything was done, I placed the cooked bananas (or "plantains") on top of the french toast, dusted all with a bit of cinnamon, and then topped with warm maple syrup. My husband and I gobbled it all up! Thanks, Jan!

Delicious traditional french toast recipe. I followed it exactly but used regualar (not thick) bread just because that's what I had. I also lightly sprinkled some confectioner's sugar on it when it was done. It added a little sweetness and looks pretty when you serve it.My family loved it.

The mixture does not quite cover 6 pieces of bread.  I suggest using only 5.

Very good taste and quick and easy to make.  Also, most people would have all the required ingredients in their pantry so it's a great "last minute" breakfast idea.  If you're looking for a simple and fail proof recipe.....this would be the one.

I have made this one twice now, and the blend of spices is just right!  We love it with a little powdered sugar sprinkled over it just before we add the syrup.  A favorite at our house!

I just made it and found it to be an ordinary recipe.  I added a couple pinches of sugar.  Maybe would have been better served with whipped cream and berries.  Overall it was okay.  May use the recipe again, not sure.

If you have a bread machine, and like french toast, this recipe is a must.  It's quick, uncomplicated, and it tastes like french toast should!  The nutmeg is perfect in this.  I do not use very thick slices, and only dip the bread on both sides before adding to the pan.  Thanks!

I was looking for a simple french toast recipe...and I've found it!  This was great with Texas Toast.  Next time I'll top with fruit.  I followed other reviewers' advice and did not soak bread for long before putting on griddle.  Thanks Jan!

We added a teaspoon of sugar as was suggested. There was a strong nutmeg flavor, which Bennett of SUSANANDBENNETT really liked.  I added blueberries because we're nuts about bloobs.

Exellent recipe. I have used both Texas Toast and whole wheat bread for this recipe, and both were good, though I would have to say that the Texas Toast was superior. Will have to try French Bread next. I often use egg whites in place of the whole eggs to make the recipe a bit healthyer, and it still tastes great.
