Moist, delicious, and full of flavor - what more could you ask of for from a cornbread recipe?  This definitely was a nice change from regular cornbread plus, it had a nice little "kick" to it which made it a perfect accompaniment to a warm bowl of chili. Thanks Paula for a wonderful recipe!

Moist and flavorful. The pepperjack and Tomatilla Verde Mexican Cooking Sauce give this just the right amount of spices for a little kick without over powering the cornbread. Paula what a great recipe. This will be my go to cornbread when I want a Mexican flair.

Thank you, Paula, for a delicious cornbread.  The flavor was perfect!  The texture was moist which all of my guests raved about.  Mine turned out a bit crumbly (probably due to the fact that I added 2 1/4 cups of flour).

I made this for "Mexican" day at my office. It was a hit. I had to make one substitution. I could not find the tomatillo sauce with a prepared salsa verde. Because if that, I'll use just pepper jack cheese (1 cup) and omit the cheddar. It could use a little more kick since I had to substitute the sauce.

This is more of an authentic cornbread with the elimination of flour, no eggs, etc.  With that, I will admit that I'm more of a lover of a southern cornbread that combines flour, eggs, butter...did I leave off sugar here?  With that said, there's a benefit to this recipe:  it could potentially be gluten free...and if you're like me and have someone in the family who has an intolerance to gluten, this is a relatively easy way to give them something with a little more taste than some of the bland things on the market.  I'm not clear as to whether or not Herdez is a gluten free product, but surely something could be substituted if not.  For those on gluten free diets who are new to all of this, just use caution checking your ingredients to be sure that everything you're putting in does not contain gluten...that would include the cornmeal.

This is a very tasty cornbread.  Texture was perfect, and it cut into squares beautifully.  You get just a little kick from the tomatillo verde sauce and pepperjack cheese to let you know that you're eating something from South of the Border. And the addition of the chopped peppers gives the cornbread good eye appeal.  Great job Paula!

I liked this recipe and made it with all cornmeal, even though I normally would use half cornmeal and half flour.  The color was great, and it was moist.  A little crumbly but very good.  I think the addition of the cooking sauce was a great idea.  I substituted pickled jalapenos for the mild green chiles because we like it hot here in Texas!

Very salty and greasy with awful flavor.  Nothing at all like cornbread I've eaten in the past.  I guess the 2 TABLESPOONS of baking powder + 1 cup of cheese + 1 tablespoon of kosher salt should have clued me in.

Absolutely delicious. Made this for a friend who came over for dinner, who is gluten free. It's a really soft cake like bread. I couldn't find any pepper jack cheese, so i used monteray jack, instead.

I didn't think this was all that great.  Too greasy and way too salty.  But I should have figured since it calls for an entire tablespoon of salt.  I made muffins and ended up with 2 dozen.

Paula, this is a delicious bread!  I had to use Herdez Chipotle sauce because I couldn't find the verde.  I was really very good.  The only problem I had with it is I definitely should have refrigerated the leftovers because within two days it turned very sour smelling.  Hence....no picture.  But I will be making this again and store it properly.  Loved it!

this was taste wise....spot on! Perfect with it being gluten-free. Hubby isn't much of a spicy corn bread person (a rather sweet cornbread eater).... I found it quite nice. I did find that the cornbread was held nicely around the edges but did crumble towards the center cut pieces. Possibly needing an egg as a binder. However, the flavor and moistness was great. Next time I'll mix in 2 eggs and see if I can get clean cuts all the way from pan to plate. I will make again. It's a keeper.

Very tasty cornbread! This is my favorite out of the Herdez recipes I tried. My only issue was it was so moist it wouldn't hold together for photos. Lol

This was a very moist cornbread, not at all dry.  I baked the cornbread in a cast iron muffin pan, and needed to almost double the cooking time.

This was an awesome recipe.  It went really well with the Herdez Red Guajillo Chile Chicken Tortilla Soup from this site.  Since I only had regular corn and not creamed corn, I drained the can of corn and put 1/2 in the food processor to blend it smooth and then combined it with the rest of the corn and I had creamed corn.  It worked great in the recipe.  I also used jalapeños instead of green chilies and it had just the right amount of heat for us.
