My husband is the hardest food critic and he said this was the best dipping sauce he's had. It is also pretty healthy for a dip. I halved the oil and it was still very tasty.

I cut the oil down to 1/4 cup but otherwise, loved this recipe! Great balance, went very well with chicken.

Really really good. Like another reviewer mentioned, great balance. I used my food processor to blend it and slowly added the oil to it. Didn't use the full amount of oil (I used maybe 1/4 cup) and used olive oil instead as I was fresh out of veg oil. Tastes like something you'd get in Wendys or something; great with chicken fingers.

Good balance of sweet and tart with the honey flavor being the star, and it emulsified well giving you a perfect dipping texture.  Enjoyed this with some chicken fingers, but this would be great for a pretzel dip, as well.

This is delicious. My husband is a honey mustard fanatic and I have tried to make it in the past only to come up short. This tastes just as good as any honey mustard sauce he's had in a restaurant. I usually make only enough for one meal at a time to control portion size.

Very easy! I used about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a little extra honey. Tasted great!

Good sauce.  I wanted more sweet than zip so I added one more TBS of honey.  I made this for baked chicken wings.

This wasn't bad, but I prefer honey mustard sauces that are more creamy. It was probably the large amount of oil in this recipe that gave it a different texture and taste. I cut the amount of oil in half, too. To me, you don't need to add oil to get a good honey mustard sauce.

As written, it calls for to much oil.  I reduced to 1/4 cup, used olive oil, and the sauce was transformed.

I made this for a party. Gave it to my husband and daughter to try. I made it as is without the cayenne pepper. Both said it was to oily. Made it again like the other post had said with only a 1/4 cup of oil. They both raved about the one with the 1/4 cup of oil. Now it's a 5 star!!!

I loved this!  So easy to make. I also used half the oil and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also used honey Dijon mustard and it was pretty amazing. Made the buffalo chicken fingers with it and I'm in heaven!!
