This is a pretty nice noodle salad.  Ufortunately, I just think there wasn't enough linguini in relation to the vegetables, but that's easy enough to fix.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except for adding some sliced red bell pepper for a little more color.  The dressing is very good, the powerful sesame oil doesn't overwhelm, and the tart lime juice is just another layer of flavor.  Thanks, Denise, this is a keeper and going into my Asian noodle salad folder.

Pretty good compared the how bad my family normally eats. I used a couple tablespoons of sambal instead of serrano and with Sriracha for taste; added leftover habenero seeds for spice.

This was wonderful! I changed it a little I added a handful of cilantro and used yellow, orange and red baby bell pepper sliced thin. I served it with boneless skinless chicken breast marinated in teriyaki and grilled. What a wonderful dinner.
