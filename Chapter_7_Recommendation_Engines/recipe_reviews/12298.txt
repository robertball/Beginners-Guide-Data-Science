OH MY GOD is this pie DELICIOUS!!!  I followed the suggestions of others, and did the following:  (1) added about 1/4 cup of flour to the apple mixture to absorb apple juices; (2) instead of mixing apples with 1/2 cup white sugar, I used 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar; (3) in a bowl, mix the apples and sugars and cinnamin before putting it in the pie (as opposed to sprinkling the sugar on top of the apples in the pie crust); (4) I used the basic flaky pie crust also on this website which was great; (5) i sprinkled some flavored walnuts on top of the pie with the crumb mixture; and (6) I cooked it at a lower temperature for an hour and 15 minutes.  This pie was so delicious that i cannot wait to make it again.  Everyone raved about it.  ENJOY!

This is the best apple pie I have ever made!! I started making it in September and by Thanksgiving I had family demanding it.  This is not a pie that you'll have leftovers of (some people were even complaining because they didn't get a slice).  These are a few things I have changed:  I coat my apple slices in flour first.  It makes the filling more jelly then runny (you will notice the flour will make a doughy type flim on the apples before you put them in the pie crust). Then I put a layer of apples, then coat them in sugar, then put another layer and coat, then one more layer (my apples are usually heaping by now) and last layer.  I am VERY generous with my sugar.  It makes it a bit sweeter but not too sweet.  I don't change much, just I found if I don't coat my apple slices, the filling is really runny when it's finished, and if I don't put the extra sugar, the pie is a bit more tart.  Enjoy the best apple pie around!!

I made 2 of these pies with home grown granny smith apples.  They turned out delicious and were SUPER easy!  I took them to a dinner party and they were both gone in about 5 minutes!!  It was a huge hit!  People even told me it was the best apple pie they had ever had...  Instead of layering the sugar on the apples, I mixed sugar, cinammon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and a little flour with the apple slices in a large bowl, coating the apples with the mixture.  The combination made a good consistancy of filling.  And be sure to cut the apple slices pretty thin--not more than 1/2 inch or so--it will help them get soft.  Good luck!

SOO YUMMY!!  I have been trying out all diff apple crisps and pies this apple picking season and this was a great recipe to use the apples on.  I used a mix of fresh empire and gala apples from the orchard.  For the sugar mix for the apples I did use 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white sugar and 2 tbs flour then the cinnamon.  I mixed the apples in that in a bowl before pouring into the crust.  I did put a few pats of butter on top of the crust first and then on top of the apples once I poured them in.  I also gave the apples a few squirts of vanilla as well.
The crumbs I did 2/3 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 stick butter softened and mix with hand and made large crumbs to sprinkle all over-it makes the ultimate crumbs-I LOVE CRUMBS!  I did bake at 400 for 30 min and noticed the crumbs were getting brown fast so I turned down to 350 and baked another 30 minutes placing a piece of foil over the top.  I kept testing with my fork to make sure my apples were nice and soft inside.  AND let me tell you with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top-I was in heaven eating this!

This is a great base recipe! But for the apple filling I added 1/4 cup flour, used 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white sugar and added a dash of nutmeg.  I mixed the dry ingredients with the apples before placing the filling in the pie crust.  This made for a EXCELLENT "creamier" pie filling. Wonderful crumble top.  Used "I can't believe its not butter" on the crumble top and it turned out great.  Thank you so much! I have made this 5 times (modified) and people I serve it to can't believe its not professionally made! Thank you thank you thank you.

Delicious!!!!  I did make a few changes...I mixed the apples into the sugar and cinnamon mixture instead of just sprinkling mixture over apples.  I used a pie crust recipe called "Mom's Pie Crust" also found at Allrecipes.  I used half of this crust to make top crust over pie, then sprinkled the top with cinnamon.  Most of all I did NOT bake at 400 but rather at 325 which took about an hour but the crust was not burnt and the apples were cooked through out.  The result.....a fabulous pie that my husband said was the best apple pie he'd ever tasted!!

This is more of a 4.0 to 4.5 star recipe because it needs additional spices to make it work for me.  
I have made it twice now and this time I sliced the apple wedges much thinner (1/4 inch or less) and used 4 green tart apples. When baking for only 35 to 40 minutes the apple slices really need to be thin to be soft.
I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice, and one sprinkle of cloves into the sugar
and flour (2 Tbsp) mixture which I tossed with the apples.  I was worried it would be too much spice when I sniffed it
but after baking it was the perfect amount of spices.  My husband said the spices added a lot of depth to the flavor and really liked it.
I also dotted the apples with a paste of brown sugar, cinnamon and butter before putting the recipe's crumble topping on it.  (The paste was a failed attempt at making the crumble with brown sugar and white sugar mixed).  It turned out that the pie had pockets of brown sugar taste to it and my husband really liked those parts.  He said if I could have mixed that throughout it would have been a really great pie.  So next time I will mix melted butter with brown sugar in with the apples and spices before layering them in the pie crust.

A friend came over and gave the pie an enthusiastic thumbs up.  Wolfed down a slice in a couple minutes.  Said she tasted the pockets of brown sugar and really liked it that way.  I sent her home with another slice.
Overall, a good recipe to start with.

Try this recipe with pears! It tastes even better than with apples because they are not as sweet, and so the sugar is not overwhelming.. i love the crumble topping.. and do add flour or cornstarch to the fruit before cooking so that the liquid makes a nice syrup and do add the sugar-cinnamon mixture in two installments instead of one on top.. mmmm :) ENJOY!

The top is crispy/crunchy, the filling is not too sweet.  Added brown sugar and cinnamon in addition to the stated ingredients for the topping for more flavor.  A bit runny even though I added one teaspoon of cornstarch to the sugar and cinnamon mixture.

Next time: add one teaspoon cornstarch and some flour to the filling mixture.  Beware of cornstarchy taste.  Also sprinkle sugar filling mixture half way into arranging apples and then sprinkle rest on top.  Let pie set at least two hours before cutting into it.  Use Granny apples and forget about the Rome.  Good idea to use cinnamon on the topping as well.  Okay to slice apple wedges thin.  4 big apples were plenty.

Flavor is great, consistency is a runny mess!  Come to find out that I should have used flour to coat the apples.  I do not like recipes that cannot stand on their own without having to read a lot of the reviews first.  Wish the author would have put in a note to coat apples with flour first.  I'll probably still try to find a way to eat this, because the flavor is good.  But I could never serve it to company as-is.  I'll try one more time with the flour to see if that improves the consistency.

Absolutely fantastic.  The key to this recipe is to use a couple different types of apples.  Took this to the inlaws and they loved it. Of course they still don't like me much- oh well.

I having been using this recipe for a while! This only thing I changed; When slicing apples, reserve them in a bowl of water. When all the apples are sliced, drain the apple and set them back in to the bowl. Mix the cinnamon and sugar into the apples and piece them into the pie shell. At the bottom of the used bowl, you should notice some residue of sugar, cinnamon, and water. Pour this mixture over the apple before the crumble. It makes a delicious glaze! TIP: Brush the shell with melted butter or margarine before putting the apples in. It prevents the shell from becoming soggy.

*Update:* I have made this pie dozens of times. It's the best. **Hands down the best apple pie I've ever made! I doubled the cinnamon and added a dash of nutmeg to the apple mixture. Also added 3 TBS of flour to apples. Like other reviewers, I mixed the apples, sugar, spices and flour together then arranged in the pie crust. Added a touch of cinnamon to the topping too. WOW! Baked at 350 for 1 hour (covered outer crust with foil last 20 minutes of baking). Definitely a keeper in my permanent file.

This was awesome.  I can't see why anyone would rate it less than 5 stars.  I made some changes, but I think if made as writen it would still be good. My changes : 1 1/4 tsp of cinnamonm, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 allspice.   I also mixed the apple and spices in a bowl and added 2 tbsp of flour to the apples to thicken.  I've made twice.  Once to test and once for company - and I'm sure it will be made a few more times again.

I have been baking since I was very young, but I have never been able to master an apple pie that is the "triple threat": great consistency (not runny), beautiful appearance,and wonderful taste.  Well... I did it.  This pie is VERY simple to make.  I read all the reviews and made a few adjustments to the original recipe.  I coated the apples in a flour/cinnamon mixture which kept them from getting soggy and making my pie runny.  I also added just a dash of nutmeg.  I cut down the white sugar, but before I added the crumb topping, I sprinkled the top of the apples with brown sugar.  EVERY person who tasted these pies (I made 4 at once using 2 packages of pre-made Pillsbury pie crusts), said it was the best apple pie they had ever tasted.  Thank you for such a simple, perfect recipe idea!

I just finished making this dessert for the kids and they loved.  I made the following modifications (noted below) per other reviewers and a few minor tweaks myself.
Noted Modifications:
- Combine the apple mixture with all appropriate incredients in a seperate bowl, then spoon into the pie shell.
- Instead of 1/2C of white sugar in the apple mixture, substitute 1/4C brown sugar and 1/4C white.
- Add 1/4C flour, 1 tbl. corn starch, 1 tsp. of nutmeg, and 1 tsp. of vanilla/butternut extract to the apple mixture. 
- Instead of just 6 tbls of butter for the crust, use the entire stick (1/2C, cut into segments).
- To add more flavor to the crust, add 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.
- Sprinkle a little cinnamon sugar on top of the pie shell prior to adding the apple mixture (We like it sweet).
- Cook at 350 (it will take about an hour).

Delicious!  I did add 1/4 cup of flour with the sugar mixture and tossed that with the apples versus putting on top of them, as others suggested.  The result was a thicker juice versus runny.  The crumble mix that goes on top of it all was delicious.  I used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust.  I prebaked the crust for 7 minutes at 400 degrees, because I hate when the bottom crust is underbaked and soggy.  I covered the edges with a foil crust protector. Once the crust was slightly prebaked, I added the apple/sugar mixture and topped with the crumble.  I baked at 375 for 15 minutes to get the apples cooking, and then I turned it down to 350 for another hour.  The lower temperature and longer cook time gave my apples enough time to soften without burning my crust.  I kept the foil crust protector on during the entire cook time.  The top crumble was just starting to brown, and I could see the apples starting to bubble up through the crumble in the center of the pie when the pie was done.  At that point, I poked the apples with my knife to make sure they were soft, and they were.  I used Haralson apples, which are great for baking.  My family really enjoyed this!

Easy, delicious.  I halved the sugar in the apple mixture because I had sweeter apples to use (and used brown sugar for added flavor), and I mixed in a little flour and cornstarch because I like thick gooeyness in my apple pies.  This was so easy to put together, and delicious.

I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white. I mixed it with 3 tbls of flour, 1 tsp on cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and tossed the dry mixture with the apples thoroughly.  For the topping I used half white and half brown sugar.  I used enough apples to fill the crust...I believe 5 did the trick if I am remembering correctly.  The only type I used were Granny Smiths and it was perfect! Lastly, based on other reviews, I baked it at 325 for an hour.  This is one of the best apple pies I have had. It was a hit at Thanksgiving! Ally

I made this yummy pie last night using suggestions from others. Mixing the sugar and cinnamon with the apples, I also added about 3 tbls of flour. I baked it about an hour at 325 degrees which gave me a perfect crust and apples. Dutch crumb apple pie is my husbands favorite and he said there wasn't a thing he'd change (he said this after his second piece in 30 mins!)

Delicious! I followed the advice of others and used just shy of 1/4 cup of flour in the filling and half brown and half white sugar. I upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp. and mixed the sugar, cinnamon and flour together with the apples instead of sprinkling over them. I let the coated apples sit for about 10 minutes and they produced a nice, syrupy juice that I poured over after piling them into the crust - it created a nice, thick sauce after baking! I also used half brown and half white sugar in the crumble topping. This is a simple recipe that wins every time!

Great pie recipe, thanks for sharing!  This recipe works perfectly every time for me with the following method:  I mix the apples with the sugar & cinnamon (increased to  heaping 1 tsp.) AND add 3 TBSP. of  flour. I "dot" the top of the apple mixture with a few TBSP. of butter before adding the crumble.   I bake this at 350 for 60 minutes with the outer crust covered.  This has been my "go-to" pie for years.  I have found that 3-4 large Granny Smith is just right.

I really liked this recipe.  I did modify it like another user and used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and it was great!

This is a 5 star recipe with some changes. I listened to other reviews and I made some of my own changes. I used 5 medium/large sized courtland apples. Although it was a heaping pile, the apples do cook and shrink down to the perfect size.   For the filling, I tossed the sliced apples with 2-3 tbs of flour, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of white sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 tbs lemon juice and 1 tbs vanilla extract.   As for the crumble, I love crumble! I cut down the flour by a lot -- used 1/2 cup of flour, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2/3 - 3/4 cup rolled oats (depending on your preference of oatness), 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 6 tbs of softened butter. You can cut down on the butter but I feel like the butter is crucial as that's what really makes a great crumble.  This was my second time being a part of making a crumble pie but my first time making it on my own for Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved this and there were no leftovers at the end of the night. It was really easy to make and a great turnout.

OMG!!!Been looking for the perfect apple crumble and this is it!!My boyfriend couldnt stop raving about it.I made my own pie crust and instead of layering the apples and sugar mixture,i tossed the apples with 1/2cup white sugar,1/4cup flour and 1/2tsp cinnamon and then placed it in the crust..this way,the filling is not runny.Definitely a keeper!!Thanx for posting this magnificent recipe!!

I love this recipe.  As suggested by another reviewer to use fuji apples and granny smith apples, the pie came out excellent.  I made this pie 3 times already.  The first two times i added about 2 tablespoons or of flour for the apple mix.  I also layered in the sugar in between the apples; instead of just putting all the sugar mix on top of everything.  One thing i wouldnt recommend doing (something i tried myself) is NOT melting the butter all the way like i did.  I was in sort of a rush and decided to melt the butter for the crumble topping and it made the crumble too wet.  So i added a little more flour to fix the the topping and when it came out, it wasnt as crumbly as it was before and kind of bland.  So yeah, that was my mistake...The recipe is perfect as it is, just dont make the same mistake i did ;)

My boyfriend and I picked apples to make into a pie. However we realized we had no measuring cups. This was very simple to eyeball and tasted delicious as well!

This pie turned out great!  I did make a few changes.  1) didn't peel the apples 
2) used fuji, honey crisp, and crispy pink apples 
3) used 1/4 white and 1/4 golden brown sugar in apple mix 
4) did half brown sugar and half white sugar in the 1/3 cup of sugar used in the crumb mix 
5) added a 1/4 cup of flour to the apple mix 
6) added a large handful of oats to the crumb mix.  This pie was amazing and everyone who ate it at our Labor Day shin-dig loved it!  I will definitely be making this pie for Christmas!

This pie was amazing! I am filling out this review as a means of stopping myself from getting a second helping.  The only change I made was adding a whole teaspoon of cinnamon instead of 3/4 tsp.

Delicious!  I mixed the apples with the sugar and flour and added some cinnamon and cloves. But the topping was delicious and its what made it special. I also baked it low and slow. At 325 for over an hour.

OMG.  Best Apple Pie of my LIFE!!!  Only differences: instead of sprinkling the sugar on top of the apples before adding the crumb layer, I mixed the apples, sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl along with 1/4 c. flour.  I also used 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar in the apple mixture.  I did nothing different to the crumb topping and I used a frozen, store bought crust.  AMAZING!!!  Shamefully my husband and I just ate TWO slices of pie a piece!

This is a great recipe, but I did change a few things to "help" it out. First, I used 3/4 brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar for the apples.  I added lots of cinnamon and nutmeg plus some vanilla.  For the crumb topping I used brown sugar only instead of white. I also added a little bit more cinnamon to the top.  I took the pie to a gathering last night and it was the first dessert to be scooped up! Everybody raved about how good it was!

WOW!  This is one delicious pie!  I didn't change a thing, but I did make sure the apples were very thinly sliced as was recommended in other reviews.  I used my apple peeler/corer/slicer and it made the apples just the right size.  I'm not usually wild about apple pie, but this one is perfect - it's my recipe from now on!

This was wonderful! So simple and easy. My fiance called it "incredible"-even better than grandma's, which is, of course, usually impossible to top! I layered the apples and sugar mixture twice instead of just pouring it all on top and I tossed the apple slices in a few tablespoons of butter before putting them in the pie crust. It came out perfect--not too sweet at all. Loved the crunchiness of the top, too! It added great texture. I just can't shut up about this pie! Thanks!

Very good apple pie. Topping was scrumptious! If your apples are very juicy (which mine were) you may need to add some cornstarch to your apples. I also added a good amount of cinnamon to my apple mixture as my family loves it. Thanks!

Pretty disappointed. This was pure watery mess. It did seem odd to me no flour or cornstarch but so many rave reviews I went on and tried it. I didn't have time to read all the various reviews. Hate to have wasted so many of my wonderful apples and my wonderful pie crust. :(

Four stars for simplicity - I like to add more things like spices, a bit of butter to the apples, and I followed what others said, and doctored it up to my liking. The crumble topping was fab! My dad said it was, "exceptional!" I used basic flaky crust, too. Turned out great. I precooked the apples a bit because my people don't like any crunch to the filling.

One of my favorite pies to make is a French apple pie. When I saw this recipe it looked like a simpler version of that. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I didn't care for is the bottom was kind of liquidy, making it a little difficult to get the slices to hold shape, and it was a quite a bit sweeter than the one I usually make from an old Betty Crocker cookbook. I think this pie would probably be best with a homemade crust, but I wanted to use a deep dish pie crust though I had in the freezer. I will stick with my stand by recipe, and hopefully this will all be eaten.

SUPER YUM! I combined the apples with flour, brown sugar and white sugar as recommended in previous posts. I love cinnamon so put in 1 teaspoon with the apple mixture. I also lowered the baking temperature to 350 and baked for an hour and 15 minutes. I served it with whipped cream flavored with vanilla extract. It turned out so good! Thank you!

This is an easy and excellent Apple Crumble Pie recipe.  I found this recipe is much easier than making an apple pie as you can skip making a top crust for the pie.  I totally used five large granny smith apples for this pie.  For the pie crust, I used ‘French Pastry Pie Crust Recipe’ from Allrecipes.com and this time I reduced half of the recipe for making the apple crumble pie.  For the sugar mixture for apples, I used ¼ cup of brown sugar and ¼ cup of white sugar, plus ¾ teaspoon of cinnamon and ¼ teaspoon of nutmeg.  In order to make sure all your apples get good bit of sugar mixture, you may want to divide sugar mixture in two portions for sprinkling on the sliced apples.  I bake this pie for one full hour in 350 degree.  Make sure you let your pie chill for at least four hours before you serve.   Both of the pie texture and presentation are great and awesome.  Thank you so much Penny for sharing this great recipe.

This recipe is perfect and the pie delicious!  I have made it many times. I decided to add one tablespoon of cornstarch to the sugar and cinnamon mixture to thicken it slightly the last time that I baked it and it came out fine that way.  My nephew wanted an apple pie for his 9th birthday and so I made this for him.  It was a big hit with him!

This recipe was really easy. I decided to try this as I am hopeless at making pie crust. I liked the idea that it had a crumb topping . Next time I will mix the sugar and apples together first and then put in crust as it seemed it was was not sweetened evenly. Also I will turn down the temp. as the crust was done before the apples. But overall a good, easy recipe.

You gotta be kidding me....this was too easy to make and turned out soooo good.  I used a grater to slice the apples (Granny Smith) super thin.  Have made this several times and it is always a hit. Thanks

I have made this pie 3 times now, always a success! I took the advice of some other reviewers, I used 1/4 cup of white sugar and a little more than a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, rather than just white sugar. I too mixed all the ingredients for the pie filling together rather than simply sprinkling over top. If you don't want a runny pie, add a little more flour. Another change I made was I added caramel syrup, which was fantastic! Also for the crumb topping I added brown sugar.

I hate how good this recipe is. First time I made pie in my life and the blasted thing was gone in two days. My family kept giving me these "my God, it actually tastes good" looks after dinner and I just-- *shakes fist* Took some prior suggestions and added 1/4 cup flour + 1/4 cup brown sugar + white sugar to the apple mixture. Used granny smith apples and still trying to figure out how to make the pie slices stay together--maybe I need to put it in longer--but anyway, I now make these about twice a month. Might try it with other apples, but granny smith has been running strong so I'm reluctant to switch.

Excellent! Followed tips from reviews: used 1/4 c white and 1/4 c brown sugar, mixed with cinnamon and added 1/4 c flour to mix with apples and then poured in the pie crust.  Baked at 400 for 10 minutes then t 350 for another 30.  I did need to cover the edges for they started to burn. M husband says it is the best apple pie he's ever had (and both our moms bake delicious apple pies!)!

This pie is amazing. My husband is an apple pie aficionado, and he said this is his new favorite recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted half brown sugar for the white sugars. I also added 3 tbs of flour to the sugar/cinnamon mixture (which i mixed in a bowl with the apples instead of sprinkling on top) which kept the pie from being runny.  So good!

Great recipe, have made 4 of these pies now.  Granny smiths work well.  Added 1-2 T flour, lemon juice to apples and mixed this and sugar/ spices with apples.  Decreased sugar by about 1/2 in this part.  For the topping, it makes a lot so I decreased everything by 1/3 and it's just right.  Also, I baked for an hr as some reviewers suggested but the apples were too mushy.  So I'd recommend following the recipe on oven temp and cooking time. This will be my go-to apple pie recipe going forward; the presentation is very nice and people are surprised that it's home made rather than store bought.

Oh my goodness... DELICIOUS!!!!  Thank you!!  I only made a few insignificant changes in my opinion.  I always add more cinnamon, so I probably doubled that!  I added 1 tablespoon of flour to that seasoning as well just b/c I didn't want to risk the chance of the pie filling to be too runny (based off past reviews) I mixed the apples w/ the seasoning prior to putting it into the crust.  And my last change was purley b/c I heated the butter a little too much since it wasn't soft enough to cream w/ the sugar when I was ready for it... so I added equal amounts of flour, white sugar, and also brown sugar to the butter after it was too soft so it became crumbly vs creamy... I'm glad that happened b/c we LOVED the crumble topping and the fact that there was a lot more than usual was a big plus!!

This pie was super simple to prepare! The longest part is peeling the apples. I made the pie with a frozen crust and refrigerated it overnight. Right when I was serving dinner I popped it into the oven. The house smelled delicious and everyone was begging for dessert. I added some cinnamon to the top for a little color. Highly recommended if you want an easy homemade dessert but don't have all night to make it.

This was awesome. I have an apple tree in my yard and had been feeding them to livestock as they fell. Hours before Irene hit I was losing a lot of apples and decided to make a pie. But in a hurry. I used the No Roll Crust with oil I found here and in under an hour I had a delicious pie!! Awesome recipe thanks for sharing!!

I added raisins and a little lemon juice to the apples and a pinch of nutmeg to the sugar mixture that I mixed the apples in like others have suggested. I messed up the crumb topping. I guess the butter got softer than intended so I ended up with a paste but I used it anyway. It still tasted great.

This is a great recipe! As suggested by several reviewers, for the apple filling I added 1/4 cup flour. I also used 1/4 cup brown and a little less than 1/4 cup white sugar for the 1/2 cup all white sugar (since I used 6 yellow delicious apples that are sweeter) mixed the dry ingredients with the apples before placing the filling in the pie crust. Yummy crumble top!  I would suggest that when baking the pie, you might cover the crust with foil, or bake it at 425 degrees for 15 min, then turn it down to 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes. Definitely will make on a regular basis.

This pie was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner! It's so tasty and easy to make. I find that granny smiths are the best apples to use for this recipe--also I use a tsp of cornstarch to thicken the filling. Otherwise, a great recipe!

Not a big baker.  This recipe is the bomb. Super easy, quite quick actually, very simple. No fuss.  I used the basic flaky pie crust recipe from this site.  Also simple.  Prior to adding apples to crust, I mixed the sugar which has half white half brown sugar, cinnamon and added a bit of flour to soak up the apple juices, all into a bowl to coat the granny smith apples.  The pie turned out not to overly sweet by using the tart apples.  Fantastic warm with creamy vanilla ice cream.  Yummy!

Delicious! Made exactly as the recipe states, once w/ Honeycrisp and once with Granny Smith. Will make again, probably will need to put tin foil around the edges of the crust to prevent turning too brown.

I used a honey-maid graham cracker crust that I had just made prior to filling it with this recipe, and Oh my goodness, this dessert turned out WONDERFULLY!  I took some to my neighbor, turned my head, and when I looked back he had already eaten it.  This is definitely going on my table as part of Christmas dinner.  Super yummy and super easy to make!

Very nice crumble pie.  As suggested by others, added ~1/4C flour to the sugar and cinnamon for the apples and mixed all before putting in pie shell.  I did use dark brown sugar instead of white in the topping and added a handful of chopped walnuts as well.  Also used a bit more apple.  VERY well received.

I let mine cook about 15 minutes longer to help the apples bubble longer and become more tender. It was a big hit in my house with my picky eaters.

So easy and soooo good. I made a few changes.I added a bit of flour (1-2 tablespoon) to the sugar/cinnamon mixture and then poured this over my apple slices, making sure that they were well coated. I have also made this with a mixture of gala /granny smith apples, along with a tablespoon of lemon juice. Makes for a nice tart flavor.

Absolutely amazing pie!! I followed other's suggestion and mixed some flour and brown sugar to the apples (Granny Smith) in a bowl before putting them in the pie dish. Another interesting thing that I tried was- I drained out the juices from the apples, mixed it with a blob of butter and a dash of vanilla extract, and caramelized it to thicken it. I dabbled it over the apple mixture. It gave an absolutely wonderful flavor!! Would definitely make this pie again and again :)

Great recipes.  I liked the crumble topping. I do have some tips to keep the crust from being soggy on the bottom. Sprinkle the apples with sugar and spices and then cook them on the stove for about 7 minutes. (You don't want the apples to be mushy.)  Drain the apples in a colander, reserving the liquid. Then put the liquid back in the skillet and reduce by simmering about 10 minutes. (Let it caramelize to a nice brown color.)  Mix the juices back with the apples and pour into prepared pie crust. You'll never have a runny pie again. ALSO, cook the pie on the floor of your oven for the first 20 minutes. The crust will be nice and crisp on the bottom.

My first homemade apple pie!  It was soooo easy.  After I cut up the apples in small pieces, I mixed in 1/4 cup flour like suggested then added the 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I sprinkled a dash of extra cinnamon on top of the apples when I poured them into the pie crust.  I used a fork to cut the butter into the flour mixture, 7 T instead of 6 T.  I just folded it until it rolled into tiny balls, this was my first crumble, so I wasn't sure how, but it worked great.  I did bake it at 325 for an hour and 20 minutes, then I broiled for about a minute, watching very carefully, just to get the top browned nicely.  It was perfect!! I didn't have ice cream, so I drizzled some boiled custard on top...it was all I could do to stop eating after 2 slices.

Easy and delicious pie. I liked that the real taste of the apples comes through and is not masked by a lot of sugar and cinnamon, but is still plenty sweet. I used half white and half brown sugar when topping the apples. I also liked that this pie wasn't runny causing the bottom crust to get soggy. The baking time was pefect to bake the apples and the bottom crust throughly without burning the topping. I used 5 cups of Jonagolds and have to say this is one of the best apple pies I have ever made.

This is by far the best apple pie that I have ever tasted, throw out all your other apple pie recipes!    The only thing I added to the recipe was about 3 Tbsp of flour to the cinnamon and sugar as a thickening agent.  Also, I think that next time I make this I will use only 5 Tbsp of butter for the crumble.  One general tip I would like to share is to use half sour apples like Granny Smith, and half sweet ones like Gala, this enhances the flavor of any apple pie recipe.

I made this several times and there are 2 ways that I make it. First, I made it with 2/4C brown sugar 1/4 C white sugar 1/4C flour 1/2 tbsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 1/4 tsp vanilla for the granny smith apple mixture. It came out superb and if you have sweet tooth, this is  the one for you. Second, I made it with half granny smith and half sweet apples like gala or fuji apples. Then for the mixture, based on other reviews, I used 1/4C white sugar 1/4C brown sugar 1 tsp vanilla 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 2 tbsp of flour. This came out very yummy as well. My husband loved it so much that he came back for thirds.  Just remember that when you make this pie with all granny smith, you might want to put more sugar for the apple  mixture since it will not come out as sweet as you prefer. Otherwise, it all depends on people's preference.

This is definitely a keeper.  Like other reviews, i changed 1/2 cup of sugar to 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a 1/4 cup of white sugar.  I also added 1/4 cup of flour to the apple mixture, just like the others did.  I did not follow the 5 cups of apples, i simply filled the pie dish with apple pieces until it was really full to the top.  The topping (crumbles) was the best part.  Make sure you really slice the apple pieces into smaller bits because it'll be easier for the cutting (you won't be dragging a bunch of apple pieces when you cut out a piece).  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Good, but recipe needs to mention that the butter should be softened before cutting into the flour mixture. Cold butter doesn't make streusel. I put some oatmeal into the flour, next time I'll put more.

Great recipe - very similar to french apple pie.  Super easy, especially with one of those apple slicer/peeler/corer things.  I only needed 4 apples per pie.

This pie was absolutely  delicious.  My  mother and husband loved it.  I did, however make a few changes.  I added 1teaspoon of Apple Pie Spice to the cinnamon mixture.  I dotted 2 tablespoons of butter over the pie after the apples were covered.  (This made the pie taste richer.) I used 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar  and 1/2 cup of flour to make the crumble,  I also  lightly browned the crust before putting in the apple pie mixture.  This  kept the pie crust from being soggy,  (This was a tip from my Mom.)   I am going to try making this pie with Splenda and Splenda Brown Sugar next time.

Excellent! I learned my lesson about adjusting recipes before I have even tried them. Based on many reviews I decided to add about 3 tablespoons of flour. I also baked at 400 for 15 minutes, then dropped the temp to 350 and loosely laid some foil over the top when I thought it was getting too brown. Thank you LEHOUX! My family thinks I am so cool, haha ha.

I, too, made this for my boyfriend and his buddies and it was a huge hit! I was really pleased with how great it was, especially with so little effort required. I followed the great suggestions of other reviewers, which BUONICONTO kindly put together in one review, and also added rolled oats to the crumble. Delicious!

I read the reviews and made this with white and brown sugar and dusted the apples with flour and nutmeg in addition, to the cinnamon.

Truly delicious!

And I used a whole stick of butter in the crumble topping- truly delicious!

Very nice and easy apple pie recipe.  I followed other reviewer suggestions and mixed 1/4 cup of brown with 1/4 cup of white sugar with couple of tbpns of flour and mixed with apples before putting in pie crust, and I added 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts & 1/2 tspn of nutmeg to the crumble.  I cooked for about 30 minutes at 400 degrees and then lowered oven temp to 350 for the last 10 minutes to stop topping from getting too dark.  Everyone raved about this pie, but next time I think I will add another cup of apples and use only Granny Smiths or add a squirt of lemon juice as I like my apple pie alittle tarter.

I love this recipe. Definitely need to add flour to the apple mixture to avoid the pie being watery. Also did the half brown sugar and half white sugar. Took another persons suggestions of cooking it longer at a lower temp and it cooked much more thoroughly.

Delicious and super simple, this quickly became a family favorite...I have thrown in a few raisins, subbed nectarine for some of the apples, used a bit of brown sugar to take place of some of the white sugar in the top "crumbles...all these variations have been exceptional, including the original! Thank you, thank you, for this great recipe!

Everything has already been said about this pie.  It is the easiest pie to make and tastes so good as is.  I also add some flour to absorb the juices.  The crumble part makes the pie awesome.  I  get asked for the recipe all the time.  Love it.

I loved this pie! I used the flaky pie crust recipe from this site and I mixed brown sugar per recommendations with the white sugar. I also mixed in about 1/4 cup of pecans. For the topping I also added a little bit of salt to enhance the flavor. Very good, I will make it again.

The best apple pie ever!!  Followed other suggestions and tossed apples in 1/4 c flour first and also added 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to sugar/cinnamon mix.  Made this with freshly picked pink lady apples and it was unbelievably good.  Highly reccommend.

This is such AMAZING pie.  I make it all the time for company.  It is sort of my shining glory.  Modifications- I mix the apple with ingredients for the first sprinkling, along with 2 TBS of flour, and use half white sugar, half brown. (Be sure to eat an apple slice coated in the sugar before baking.  They are almost as good as the cooked pie.) I usually use about 5 large apples, which makes a "mile high" apple pie.  I bake the pie for an hour, the first 30 minutes covered with tin foil, the second without.  AMAZING!!!

This recipe turned out great! I have been baking the two crust apple pie for a long time now and this will definatly replace it.. I would only reduce the sugar, it turned out a bit too sweet.. Other than that it was perfect..

very good! I nuke the apples in the microwave for a few minutes first so I can be ensured they're thoroughly cooked and soft when the pie is actually done baking (I hate it when some of the apples are still kind of raw). Then I add the cinnamon and sugar, also a tbsp of flour and mix the apple mixture. After letting the pie cool, you get the perfect taste and consistency. Add a scoop of ice cream  and you're in heaven!

Love, Love, Loved it!! I did make a couple of minor changes. I added a splash of lemon juice to the cut up apples to prevent browning and because it is out of habit. I also added some nutmeg to the spices and tossed all of the apples with the sugar and spices in a medium bowl before putting them into the pie. With the crumble I just made a minor adjustment by adding some brown sugar. This pie is the best apple pie that I've ever made and that comes straight from my hardest critic, my husband!! Will use for years to come, thank you!!

I made this recipe on Friday...it was eaten within 2 days and was asked to make it again today!  

The pie was easy to make and delicious to eat.  After reading some of the reviews I also made following adjustments: #1. Bake @ 350 for 1 hr & #2 Added a bit of flour to the sugar & cinnamon mixture in which I added gradually as I tossed the apples.

Thanks for the recipe!

Simply Amazing!!  I used this recipe for Christmas and have used it 3times since.  I did make a few adjustments that the other reviews suggested.  I used 1/4 white sugar, 1/4 brown sugar, 1/4 flour, 1tsp vanilla, and cinnamon for the apples.  Everything else I kept the same.  It has turned out great!

Really nice recipe - easy to prepare.  My only problem was needing a longer cook time.  Some apples (especially Grannys) take longer to soften up.  If the crust starts getting too brown, cover with foil. :)

What a wonderfully simple recipe! People have actually told me I should consider opening an apple pie busines... I added a lot more cinnamon, and halfway through sprinkled a mixture of melted butter and maple syrup on top of the crumble! It was so fantastic! If only I knew pie-making was this easy, I would have started much earlier!

Good basic idea.  I used two each of Cameo, Fuji, and Granny Smith apples; mixed the apple slices with the cinnamon and sugar and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg before arranging the slices in the pie crust; substituted brown sugar for the white sugar in the crumble; and cut down the butter in the crumble to 4 tbsp.  The crumble turned out fantastic, but after 50 min. at 400-degrees, the apples were still crunchy (or as my boyfriend put it, "There's still some life in this pie!"), the filling was watery, and the crust was soggy.  Next time I'll add more apples to mound the filling up a bit more, use less sugar to cut down on the sweetness, add more spice, mix flour into the filling to prevent so much sogginess, and probably cook the apple mixture before I pour it into the crust.

This was the first time I made apple pies, they were so easy and so good. I will always use this recipe! Some of them after baking, I covered, put in a freezer bag and froze. I've had one since then, just pulled it out and baked till warm and it was about the same as being freshly baked, not much of a difference at all. Thanks for this easy and great recipe!!

This recipe is the bomb!  I decided to try my hand at making apple pies and this recipe was very easy and very, very delicious.  I recommend first-timers to try it.  The best thing about it is that I get it right every time.

PS  I used brown sugar instead of white and lots 
    of cinnamon for flavour.

This was yummy.  I added some extra spices like the others and it tasted great.  The topping was good and the whole thing (other than the apple peeling!) was super easy.  The only thing was my apples were a bit too crunchy even after I added 15 mins to the baking time.  Next time I would slow cook the apples a bit first like another reviewer suggested

Hi love this recipe! Minor adjustments. Added 1/4 cup of flour to the apple filling and did not sprinkle the filling ingredients... I mixed them  the apples by hand w the flour. I did half white and half brown sugar. Came out perfect! Oh and I added one teaspoon of vanilla to the filling. Added cinnamon to the crumble mixture.

Everyone loved this pie but after cutting the first slice I  had to literally turn the pie sideways to drain out all the extra fluid. I'm not a chef so I had no idea you should coat the apples with flour first. With that said, this pie was so tasty, I would definitely make it again!

This was really good.  I too mixed the sugar/cinnamon into the apples along with a bit of four and put cinnamon in the crumble.  I was afraid of burning that great topping so I baked it a little lower and it took longer than expected to get the apples tender yet overall this is a great recipe.  This is a 4 1/2 stars recipe with 5 saved for OMG recipes that usually involve cheese. thanks...see you at Thanksgiving next year if not before.

This was an excellent pie. I followed others advice about stirring together the apples with the flour and sugar. I used half brown and half white sugar. I used a variety of different apples, some sweet, some tart, and added caramel bits to the filling. It won best-tasting pie at our PI contest! It slices beautifully.

Great recipe!  I made this Gluten Free by using a Gluten Free pre-made pie crust and Gluten Free flour mix.  I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the apple mixture and about 1 tbsp brown sugar to the topping.

Came out great!

Baked at 350f for an hour and 15 minutes. Brown sugar instead of white and coated the apples with a lot of flour. The apples were cooked all the way through. It was a big hit!

Excellent and easy to make!  I was very happy with the results.  I followed the advice of another and mixed 1/4 cup flour with the apples and then tossed in 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar along with the cinnamon.

Very quick - very easy.  Good for the novice baker.  I use the apples left over from bags and pre made rolled pie dough. I layer my apples and sugar mixture.  I add brown sugar to the top before the flour mixture.  Also, I add a little clove to the flour mixture.  Perfect pie in 40 min.  Add ice cream and caramel and my family is in heaven!

I used a bought pastry crust and lined my pie plate with this. I also used 2 tins of pie apple and added 1/2-1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1-2 tbsp of brown sugar.I tossed together my apple mix before adding to the pie shell. To thicken the juice I also added some flour. For the streusel topping I used mostly brown sugar.  Overall it was really yummy, I loved the streusel topping and so did the rest of my family!

This is a VERY easy recipe and I've gotten these compliments:  "This is the best apple pie I've had in my entire life";  "You should enter contests with this recipe.  You'd win"  Awesome for me since this was the first time I'd ever made an apple pie!  I use the "French Pastry Pie Crust" recipe on this site and use other reviewers suggestions of:  instead of ALL white, use 1/4c Brown & 1/4c white; and add slightly less than 1/4 c flour to sprinkle over apples.  I also substitute some brown for the crumble mixture.  If you can increase the crumble, I recommend it.  This is a quick, easy recipe that I guarantee you'll like.

Great, very easy pie to make!  I made this the first time because I had some apples and an extra pie crust that I needed to use up.  It became the star dessert of the holiday season!  I did use some of the suggestions of others.  I mixed the apples with a couple tablespoons of flour, a 1/4 cup white sugar, a 1/4 cup brown sugar and some cinnamon in a bowl before adding to the pie crust.  I also added a few squirts from the plastic lemon to the apple mixture to prevent too much discoloring.  (Be careful!  One time I could tell there was too much lemon but no one else seemed to notice.)  I added slivered almonds to the crumble mixture and they browned nicely.  Finally, I baked at 350 degrees for about an hour.  The best pie results came when I used a mixture of four small different apples.  The taste was full of apple flavor but everyone commented on the the sauce in the pie too.  When I used more apples and mostly McIntosh, it did not get the same accolades.

I had some apples that needed to be used up, and I threw this together in literally 15 minutes.  It tasted great, but could have been baked just a bit longer as the apples weren't as soft as I would have liked.  Next time I'll wrap the crust with tin foil and bake a bit longer.  Flavor was definately there though.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is definitley my new staple recipe for homemade apple pie.  I do as one of the other ladies do and coat the apples in flour then layer apples, sugar cinnamon, apples, cinnamon sugar in the crust.  I also add a little bit more cinnamon sugar over the final layer of apples before putting on the crumble.  I usually use Granny Smith apples but this last time I didnt have any so I used 2 lg honeycrisp apples and 1 braeburn apple and it turned out really well also.  Great recipe!!  Yum Yum Yum!!

GreaT!  I added the 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon, pinch of all spice, sprinkle of cloves to the topping, though it would have been good in with the apples too..  Also mixed half brown/half white sugar throughout the whole recipe & 1/4 cup flour in with the apples (mixing in a bowl with apples before) in stead of sprinkling~ like the others & it came out near perfect~ 1hr 15mins @350~  Thanx!

I made this pie for my birthday, and it was amazing! I did make a few changes... I used apple pie spice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg, which has those two spices plus the addition of cloves. And I also added oats to the topping to give it a little more substance. Delicious!!!

This pie was a favorite at last night's pie party. As suggested I added 1 T. cornstarch to the apples, and I also mixed the sugar and cinnamon into the apples before pouring into pie. Next time I will increase the amount of apples by 1 cup to fill up the crust better.

This is a great recipe--I made it for my roommates and the entire thing was gone within a day.  Like others, I coated the cut apples in flour, which made a wonderful consistency. I also used a shortbread crust--just made shortbread dough, pressed it into a 9x13 pan, and cooked for 15 minutes or so.  Then added the apples and sugar and then the topping.  It made a huge pan, and I got so many rave reviews.

mmmmmmm, how scrumptious! i made this wonderful recipe with a trinity of apples: granny smith, royal gala & rome (2 large apples of each variety). in effort to cut calories i omitted the bottom crust altogether, so my pie was more like a cobbler, then sprinkled on 1/3 c. sugar with a rounded 1/2 tsp. cinnamon & 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. no changes were made to the buttery crumble topping. my "pie" was done in 35 minutes & completely devoured by 6 people in less then 5 minutes. many thanks penny!

OH SO GOOD! I'm not a baker or cook by any means! This was so easy and so good. I took some advice from some reviewers and I substituted brown sugar for half of the white sugar. I also lowered the temperature to 350c and left it on for about an hour carefully watching it. I mixed in the cinnamon/sugar with 2 tbsp of flour and tossed it in the apples first. Turned out sooooo good!!! Will make it for special occassions!!

I followed the recipe to the T.  The consistency and texture of the apples came out beautifully, and the crumble topping was perfect.  The only qualm I have is the sweetness - it's far far far too sweet.   I don't have an ultra sweet tooth so I'll reduce the recommended amount of sugar for the apples by half, ie. 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup.   I may even add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to give it a zest.   As is, it's still a delicious dish, so a 4 star from me.

With a few modifications that the others recommended, this pie came out awesome!  I got tons of compliments from my co-workers.  I halved the white sugar and substituted w/brown sugar for the filling and topping.  And also added a few tbsp of flour for the filling which definitely helped with the consistency. Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Very good and simple to make! I used Golden Delicious apples. I took the advice of others and cut the white sugar in half and added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla extract and mixed it in a separate bowl first, then put itin the pie crust. I also used the entire stick of butter for the crumble, and topped it with a light sprinkle of cinnimon. I did not have any problems with it being watery. If you want your pie to be sweet, I would recommend leaving the white sugar alone.

Amazing! I used a mix of granny smith apples and fuji apples...delicious! I layered the apples and the sugar filling and added 1 tablespoon flour to the filling like some people suggested. I made this with the Healthier Graham Cracker pie crust on this site...fantastic! Even my sister (who is very nice about my baking) was shocked with how good it was...yay! I was so happy, my friends loved it too. I will definitely make this recipe again! Oh yeah, and I used half brown half white sugar for both the filling and the crumble as people suggested, thanks for a great recipe! =)

For the best flavor, use 3 different types of apples.  Like others, I changed the 1/2 cup white sugar to 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown.  Then mixed the apples, sugars, a pinch of nutmeg and 1/4 cup flour before placing in the pie crust.  For the topping, I also substituted brown sugar for the white and cut the butter to 4 Tbsp.  My boyfriend loved this as well!!  Great, easy apple pie.

I gave this a 4 because of all the changes I had to make.  But, this is still a wonderful pie.  Tastes like store bought, I have made it twice.  This is the first pie I have ever made.
Here were my changes:
Used 4 apples instead of 5 and chopped them small.  I used whatever variety I had on hand.  
I added 1/4 cup flour to the sugar that I was supposed to sprinkle on top of the apples.  However, I mixed them all together.  
And, finally I cooked this on 325 for 1 hour.  It comes out pretty light so if you wanted it a little brown on top, you could stick it under the broiler, for like a minute, or less.
I didn't add extra spices, didn't find it nessessary.  
I used the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" found on this site, with the pie both times I've made it.  Very good.

This was so easy, and so good!  I followed the suggestion to mix the sugar/cinnamon with the sliced apples prior to adding it to the pie crust.  I also lowered the temp to 350, and put foil around the pie crust edge, so it wouldn't burn.  My son liked it too!!

I used a ready-made pie crust, which made an easy recipe even easier.  Apples were runny so after slicing the first piece, I poured the extra juices out and no one was the wiser.  May add cornstarch or flour to apples next time.  Everyone loved the pie especially the topping!  Great warm with vanilla ice cream ... YUM!  Be sure to refrigerate the leftovers ... if there are any!  Otherwise the topping will become soggy.

I've made this pie at least 10 times, it's the best.  If I have sweet apples, I find that I can get away with only 1-2 T. of sugar mixed in with the fruit.  I would not reduce the sugar on the crumble topping, however.  If you're concerned about your frozen pie crust baking all the way through, you might want to bake your pie longer (50 minutes or more), but take a piece of foil and loosely tent it over the pie for the first 40 minutes of baking.  Many thanks to the submitter for such a mainstay recipe.

The other reviews are dead on with this recipe.  I can't recall ever tasting a better apple pie.  In fact, cherry pie is my favorite but I just make apple for my husband...now THIS pie is my favorite.  One thing is that for some reason, my pie turned out watery.  I guess it was just me, but I might try tossing the apples with a tablespoon of cornstarch next time to prevent that.  Still, even with my mistake...it was still an unbelievable pie.  And, easy to make as far as pies go...no fussing with a top crust.  Really, you have to try this one.  THANK YOU THANK YOU for sharing  this with us.  Now, my husband may want to marry me all over again.

I think this is the easiest and best apple pie I have ever made.  I use Granny Smith apple and just wash and core them, leaving the peel on for extra flavor,texture and nutrition.  It is even easier if you use a store bought crust as I do sometimes.  My husband always reminds me when the last piece is eaten.  I have been making two a week for the two of us.  Yummy!

Have made this pie twice now and came out with the same results.  Both times, it was not as flavorful as it could be and ended up with a watery liquid in the bottom of the crust.  Next time, will mix the sugar, cinnamon and 1/4 cup of flour in with the apples before putting in the pie crust.  Top the pie with 1/2 cup of flour, butter, sugar and additional cinnamon.

Super easy and delicious. Made it for Thanksgiving. Only problem was there seemed to be too much of the crisp mixture to fit in the pie pan. Spilled over a bit but it cooked down and tasted great.

My husband said "this is the best apple pie ever"! This will be the only apple pie in my recipe box. The only change I made is that I layered the apple slices and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar over each layer rather than on top.

We picked a ton of apples today - Red Delicious and Crispin so need to start baking!  I'm going to use a combination of the 2 types.  I combed through a lot of reviews and this is what I've come up with: coating the apples 1st with this mixture: 1/4c flour + 1/4c white sugar + 1/4c brown sugar. Adding 1/4 tsp Allspice, 1/4tsp nutmeg.  For the topping going with 1/2c white sugar, 1/2c brown sugar.  I'm pre-baking the crust at 400 for 7min, baking at 375 for 15 min and then reducing to 350 for 1 hour.  Watching along the way to make sure nothing gets too browned/burnt.

Now that I have this put together and in the oven I will add the Allspice, Nutmeg and Cinnamon to the flour & sugar mixture that you coat the apples with next time vs sprinkling over the top of the apples.  I put that dry mixture + apples in a Ziploc bag vs trying to mix them in a bowl - MUCH easier.

This recipe is basically my Granny's apple crisp baked in a pie crust, so I had to try it, & it's wonderful.  Dredging the apples in flour first is a must. I did use a combo of brown/white sugar also.  My twist is adding chopped pecans to the top about 10 minutes before removing from the oven; takes the flavor up a notch.

This was the first apple pie I made without using a purchased pie crust and a can of apple pie filling.  The family loved it.  I did mix the apples with the sugar (1/4 cup each of white and brown sugar, cinnamon 3/4 tsp., allspice, nutmeg and clove 1/4 tsp each.  Flour of 1/4 cup was mixed into the apple mixture.
I got distracted by my children and forgot to put in the crumb mixture but the kids helped roll out a top crust for the deep dish apple pie we ate.  I made it by lunch time and it is almost gone before bedtime.

I tried the suggestion of combining sugar (half white, half brown) and flour with the apple slices. Also used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. This was really GOOD! And easy to make using prepared pie crust. I did use more sugar than called for because the apples I had were more of the tart variety.

This turned out great and I had never made an apple pie before. I got the bottom crust form the store but followed these changes from others  (1) added about 1/4 cup of flour to the apple mixture to absorb apple juices; (2) instead of mixing apples with 1/2 cup white sugar, I used 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar; (3) in a bowl, mix the apples and sugars and cinnamin before putting it in the pie (as opposed to (4) I cooked it at a lower temperature for an hour and 15 minutes. I brought it to a party and it was gone in 2 minutes!

This is absolutely the best Apple Pie recipe out there.
I followed other reviewers suggestions with the flour, sugar,cinnamon, added nutmeg and allspice, on the apples prior to placing in the crust.
Also added chopped walnuts to the crumble.
I also used the wonderful Allrecipes Butter Flaky Pie Crust.
A true 5 star winner!

Now this is an apple pie! I am in europe with lack of access to cups so I had to wing some measurements but the pie was still a stunner. I used apples from the garden, small and tart, and followed the suggestions of others. I found that I did need to make some extra crumbs but no complaints the house smells amazing. My fourth one this week is currently in the oven. I highly recommend a flaky butter crust. enjoy!

This is delicious! I did the recipe almost exactly as stated (i may have added a bit extra cinn. and mixed sugar/cinn mixture in bowl first instead of pouring over top) and it came out perfectly! If you want an alternative to a top crust apple pie this IS IT:) Can't go wrong!!!

I've made plenty of pies in my life, but for some reason I never tried to make apple.  This one looked like the perfect 'introductory' recipe.  Boy, was it ever!  It could not have been easier to assemble and it was delicious.  I took some advice from the prior reviews and mixed the sugar/cinnamon mixture (along with an extra 1/4 c. of flour) with the sliced apples (Granny Smith, natch) before pouring into the shell.  Two adults and one 2nd grader finished the pie in two days.  Truth be told, it was intended for my neighbor in order to return her pie dish, but she wasn't home when I went to deliver.  Lucky us!  She did eventually get her dish back (with a pie and a copy of the recipe, lol) and I had to tell her about the fate of my first attempt.  This recipe is a keeper.

This pie turned out extremely delicious with just a couple of small additions. I added a little bit of brown sugar to both the apple mixture and the crumb topping. Added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples. And added a little bit of flour to the apple mixture, only because the first time I made the pie, it was a tad runny because of the apples I used (empires). With those changes, absolutely fantastic pie!

This was a hit in our house this evening. Quick n easy. like some of the other reviews, I blended white and brown sugars and mixed it in with the apples. Only thing missing for us was the ice cream to go with it.

This is a wonderful recipe that I will make again, though I will cut back on the sugar mixed in with the apples. The pie filling tasted great, but was a bit too sweet for my tastes.

This was so easy to make! i added some allspice and cloves to the apples as well - LOVE those fall flavors. I also added some tapioca to the apples so it would not be a drippy soggy mess. i think next time i would use half brown sugar. It was definitely a hit though!

This was EXCELLENT!  I used brown sugar and floured the apples as suggested by reviews...  I also used red apples, as that was all I had.  Worked fine!

Very good. I liked the idea of the crumble top, however it lacked flavor. I even added some cinnamon to it. Next time I would increase the amount of cinnamon sugar to sprinkle on. Also I might add a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. For some reason the apples were still a bit crunchy even after the 40 minuets. Everyone liked it, but I think I'll still stick with Grandma Ople's apple pie from this site.

Try adding some raisins to the apple mixture. After baking, dust some powdered sugar over the top of the pie. :-)

OY this is good! I cut up about 4 med. sized apples into 1/2 inch. chunks (i used yellow apples and a green); enough to create a mountain in a frozen deep dish pie crust. I put the dry ingredients plus about 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1 tablespoon flour, into a plastic bag to shake up the apples then poured it ALL into the pie crust. Four helps thicken the juices. I cooked it at 350 for about 1 hour 10 min. until the juices started bubbling up the sides of the pie. What a delicious smell it created and to eat it was heavenly even without vanilla ice cream.

This is a nice twist to the traditional apple pie.  I squeezed a half of a lemon over the apples before tossing them with sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg.  For the crumble topping, I added oatmeal and a pinch of cinnamon.  It was so delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  I used Honeycrisp apples, which I like for the combo of sweet and tart.  The crumb topping makes this pie perfect.  Definitely a keeper!

This applie crumble pie is so delicious! I made it yesterday for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit! It was so good, that I made it again later in the night to bring it to the in-laws the next day, and they loved it!   I did follow a few previous suggestions that were posted. I mixed all dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl, using half cup of white sugar, and half cup of brown sugar. I also added a full tablespoon of cinnamon and half cup of flour. I then coated the apples first and then put them in the pie crust. With the rest of the dry ingredients, I added the butter for the top layer. I will definitely be making this again!

Very good.  I followed the suggestion of others and mixed the apples with the sugar, substituting half brown sugar for half of the white, and adding 1/4 c flour to coat the apples, mixing this all in a bowl and then adding it to the pie pans.  For crust I used Ruth's Grandma's Pie crust from allrecpes, which is super easy and phenomenal. I baked 325 degrees for about an hour, wrapping the outter edges of the crust with cut tin foil once they were golden, to prevent them from getting too brown and dried out.  The streusel on top of this pie looks and tastes amazing.  Appears to be an expensive store bought pie.

Real crowd pleaser (lots of "oh my god"'s). But here are the mods I made after making it twice and learning a couple things. Last time I made it was perfect!   1. Use granny smith apples - 2 1/2 lb. Cut with an apple cutter/corer then cut those slices in half.  2. Add more nutmeg, allspice, and cloves to the sugar mixture.   3. Add a tsp or so of cinnamon to the crumb mixture. Which did not need to be doubled unless you really want an apple crumb as opposed to an apple pie with a crumb top crust. I doubled it the first time, but didn't use it. The second time I didn't double it and STILL didn't use all of it. Also used an extra Tbsp of butter.  3. Second time I used a 8x8 glass square pan and loved the thickness of the filling.  4. I used the refrigerated roll out crust, was perfect.   5. HAVE TO let it cool a few hours. I let it cool over night all times and was glad I did. Pop it in the microwave if you want it warm.  Enjoy!

I have made this pie for three years now exactly as it's written.  It's made me a mini-celebrity around our friends - everyone loves it!  Definitely use granny smiths; they're really good in this pie.  One tip - mix the crumble by hand and don't melt the butter.  It's the only way to get it just right.  Also, if you over work it, it'll turn to mush, so when it looks like little peas, it's done!

This is an excellent recipe. I did change it a bit though. I added 2 Tbsp flour to the cinnamon mixture, and tossed the apples with the cinnamon mixture before putting it in the pie shell. I baked it at 375 F for 45-50 min. I will definately be making this again.

Very yummy. Be generous with your sugar and cinmon in your apples, and it never hurts to dab some butter in with them too. I cooked for 30 minutes then covered with foil and cooked 10 minutes longer, and it was nicely cooked all the way through.

I changed the receipe to add brown sugar to the topping and used splenda in the apples as well as the topping. It was excellent and so easy to make.

great pie, just like my mom has always made for Thanksgiving, and so easy! I used brown sugar instead of white for the topping & added some lemon juice & maybe 2 tbsp flour to the apples- also tossed apples w/ sugar/cinnamon/flour in a ziploc before putting in pie shell.
Yum, thanks!

This is awesome and so easy!  I add a dash of vanilla, nutmeg, and cardamom to the crumble mix.

This has become a family favorite thank you so much for this wonderful recipe. I double the amount of flour and butter on top for an extra crumble. Its a hit at all gatherings and dangerous with vanilla ice cream!

My oldest daughter's favorite pie is apple so I had to try this. I added some nutmeg and the only thing was that it turned out a little crunchy so next time I'll have to make an adjustment to the time or try a different kind of apple.

Usually I am a 2 crust apple pie fan, but this was GREAT.I like my apples quite tender so i usually cook them a bit before putting in crust.This time i tossed them with the sugar and cinnamon and added 2 tablespoons cake flour and microwaved them till they juiced a bit.I then poured them hot over the crust and added the crumb.The apple filling was very juicy but not runny.Perfect!
The thing is you always have to make a pie to know if it's to your liking...This way next time you know how to improve it.For this one i will put more apples (i have used 7 cups this time) and maybe just a tad less crumb.

We really like this one.  The only changes I made this time was to add more apples and tossed cinn/sugar mixture instead of sprinkling.

Great!  Just had this warm from the oven for dessert.  I added 2 tbsp of flour to the sugar and cinnamon and tossed it with the apples before putting them in the pie shell.  It was not runny at all.  I will make this again.

Instead of apples, try this with bananas! They're naturally sweet when baked, so there's no need to top with with sugar. Just cinnamon will do. Great recipe! Makes an incredible crumble!

It was my first time to make an apple pie and it defiately wasn't my last. My family LOVED it and it was very easy. To prevent the edges of the piecrust from burning, I wrapped aluminum foil around them. I will defiately make this delicious pie again.

This pie was very easy to make and turned out really well. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and switched the 1/2 cup white sugar in the apple mixture to 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown and I added 1/4 cup of flour to the apple picture. It turned out really well. Definitely a pie I'll make again.

Yummy! I used Red Delicious apples, added 2 tablespoons flour with sugar and cin. and stirred up with the apples. For the topping I used the recommended 1/2 c. brown sugar.  Baked 40 min., then tented and baked 10 more minutes.  Pie seemed too dark and apples were not soft enough, but the flavor was delicious.  I will make again, maybe try a lower temp. and cook longer.  ok, I made this again. Used golden delicious and made sure they were riper and sliced thinner.  Pie turned out perfect.

This pie is amazing and very simple to make. I used to not like apple pie, nor had I ever made one before until I used this recipe to make one for my boyfriend. He loved it, and so did I! Using fresh apples in a pie makes an incredible difference... I reccomend Granny Smith for a little tart flavor. I make this pie regularly now for gifts, special occasions, and everytime I go to visit my father :)

Delicious! I am not a very experienced baker but I managed to make this pie and my husband loved it. It was a little runny but my Grandma told me to put a few crackers at the bottom of the pie shell to help and it works great.

I used a 10 inch pie pan instead of a 9 inch deep dish, and the pie was tall and tasty after baking for 40 minutes and then sitting in the turned-off oven for awhile.  I made the crust from scratch (messier but yummier than the ready-mades!).  I worked the cinnamon and sugar, along with the juice of half a lemon, into the apple slices with my hands before putting the apples into the crust.  I also added some cinnamon to the crumble topping.  Used Granny Smith apples: delicious!!!

Made with fresh apples from an orchard 3 types (sour, sweet and firm.)  I did use both white and brown sugars equaling the called for amount as suggested.  It was great - gone the first night, but so easy you don't mind making more!

This was fantastic usually we do it with brown sugar but with white sugar it was just as nice.  We served it with cream and had the left overs (not much) for the next day.

This pie was a huge hit at home!  I used a combo of white and brown sugar.  It was a bit runny so next time I'll add flour to the apple mixture (2 Fuji, 2 Granny Smith, 1 Braeburn)as other reviewers suggested. I spiced it up by increasing the cinnamon plus I added some allspice and nutmeg.

wonderful!  I like adding a two tablespoons of flour to the filling part, because I use juicy sour apples. I did use half brown and half white sugar for filling as well.  Kept the flour at same amount for topping.  Got rave reviews on this one!

Delicous! I made a few adjustments though, like suggested by other reviewers I tossed the apples with 1/4c of four, and I used 1/4c brown and 1/4c white for the sugars. I also used a full teaspoon of cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla and than I tossed it all with the apples before placing them in the shell. I also used brown sugar in the crumble. Than I baked it for a full hour because the apples were still a crispy at the 40 minute mark. Turned out great! I used the basic flaky pie crust recipe and that was a perfect match!

This pie is so easy and tasty!  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used half white sugar half brown.  I also added 1/4 cup flour to apple mixture before putting it in the pie.  I baked it at 350 for 1 hour 15 minutes.  I loved it and my husband loved it!  Great for a first timer, very simple.

Very good!!!! I even used whole wheat four and half the sugar. It was helpgul to add 2 tablespoons flour and coat the apples with it first. Recommended redipe.

I used golden delicious apples and tossed them with sugar, cinnamon and 1/4 cup flour.  It took a little longer for my bottom crust to brown but when it was done I drizzled it with a bit of icing sugar glaze. (1/2 cup icing sugar,3/4 tsp milk) It looked like something you would buy in a fancy bakery. Everyone asked for seconds. Mmm...

Delicious!  I'm not one for apple pie, but this was the best!  I also used the Easy Pie Crust that I found at this site for the crust.  It was the ultimate desert!  Not too sweet, not too bland, perfect!!

This recipe was so simple. This was my first time making an apple pie and it came out great. I did add a little nutmeg and allspice.

Everyone really liked this pie! it was fairly simple to make considering this was my first pie. I did follow others comments and added flour to the apples and mixed the cin. and sugar with apples instead of sprinkling it on. Very good flavor, no too sweet. The only problem I had was the apples still being a tad crunchy even when cooked on 325 until crust was brown. But it was my first pie :) All in all I will definately make this pie again it was delicious!!!!!!!

Wonderful - even to the super picky hubby.  I took another reviewers advise and cooked at 325 degrees for 45 - 50 minutes.  Not burnt and cooked all the way through.

Excellent apple pie recipe.  The streusel topping makes it!  I don't get much opportunity to bake it because my boyfriend isn't an apple pie fan, but love to make it for holidays or when company is coming.

This was a delicious pie and easy to make, but I would have liked it to be a little juicier.  Next time I might try mixing the apples with the sugar mixture and a little lemon juice.  But overall, it was great and the crumb topping was delicious!

I didn't even really like apple pie b4 this. I guess I never tried the right one. I used Empire apples and I used a vergetable peeler to slice the apples nice and thin. The pie is gone and I will be baking another one tonight or tomorrow. YUMMY!

Easy as pie (no pun intended)!  I doubled the ingredients and made 2 pies (one's never enough).  Get you some whipping cream and whip up a large bowl of fresh whippig cream to accompany pies.  Do not add sugar into the cream.  The sweet pie and the light and fluffy unsugared whip cream are a great offset! Enjoy! :)

This is now my default apple pie recipe.  It is simple and delicious.  It has lots of fruit and not too much fat.  The flavour is great.  I've made this 5 or 6 times now and it is consistently wonderful.

Very good apple pie. I used all granny smiths, and it turned out a little dry, so I will try a variety of apples next time. The crumble top is easy to make and tastes great! I used the recipe for "Best Every Pie Crust."

Super simple recipe and simply delicious!
I even tried it without a pie crust--and
it was still great (a bit messy but yummy
with ice cream).  I enjoy inviting people
over and serving this treat.  Thanks!!

As a previous review mentioned, I also used a deep dish pie tin and had too much liquid. Otherwise, the pie was very good.

I loved this pie, although I did make a few adjustments.  I added pumpkin pie spice and more cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe, and I precooked the apple slices in a slow cooker for an hour to make them less crunchy.  The white sugar topping was a little odd, but it ended up giving the top a crunchy texture that was really good.  I added some brown sugar to the top for color.  I will definitely make this pie again!

Great recipe for apple pie.  Both easy and quick.  I used this for my first attempt at apple pie and it worked really well.  My friends haven't stopped asking for more pies.  Definitely going to my recipe box.  I prefer this recipe over the popular "Apple Pie by Grandma Ople".  This is a lot easier and much more tastier.

Incredible, how could a pie that is so easy to make be so tasty?  I thinly sliced the apples and left the skin on for a hearty pie. My friend even said "My grandmother has been making apple pie for years and yours is better." Wonderful cool or warm, this is really a treat.

I will DEFINITELY make this again! I have a family full of diabetic and gastric bypass people (myself included).  This was my first apple pie, and I changed to a graham cracker crust and substituted Splenda for the sugar. Everyone LOVED this pie! It didn't turn as brown on top as I wanted, and I baked it for 5 minutes longer, but I don't know if the extra time made a difference. This was such an easy, delicious  pie! I'm hooked!

Made the pie as written however will use 1/4 cup of flour in the mixing up of the apples next time as it was a little runny.  Otherwise my family loved it

This recipe was so very simple and it's absolutely delicious!  I was short on apples so I made one Apple-mulberry and one Apple. Worked great for both. For both pies I cut back on cinnamon and added a bit of apple pie spice to to both the pie mixture and the topping. I love crumble topping, so I played with the topping on my second pie by adding 2 tbsp more butter. The crumble was a bit lumpier - which was fabulous.  We'll definitely use this recipe again!

Read the reviews for adjustments.. 1/4 brown 1/4 white sugar 1/4 cups flour.  Mix into sliced apples THEN put in pie crust. Slice very thin 1/4 inch and mound high.  Dot with butter, then add crumble made with only brown sugar, you can also add nuts or oatmeal.  really good base recipe!!

I made this twice and both times it did not work out. First time I thought maybe it was under cooked but second it wasnt, the crust and filling are good but the topping did not work out its like a powder on top. I followed the recipe exactly but used margarine not butter.

Yup, very good pie. Didn't add flour, used instant tapioca instead. Also split half brown sugar to white sugar.

Had to use up extra apples do I decided to make these. The kidlets liked it but next time I would bake it a little longer. The crumble topping was crunchy on the top but soggy below the surface.

This recipe is pretty good. The crumble recipe is more of a powder than a crumble but it works. The pie seemed very sweet, probably less sugar next time. Sliced almonds on top was a nice touch.

Good - could add more apples (6 cups at least). Use pate sable for crust (though probably good even crustless).

Great Pie!  Used apple pie spice instead of cinnamon.  Added 1/4 cup flour to mixture and coated the apple slices with it. Big hit!

I've made this pie for the last few Thanksgivings, and my family loves it! I, too, used 1/2 brown sugar and mixed the apples with the flour/sugar mixture before putting in the pie plate. I also sprinkle cinnamon over the layers.  Yum!

I'm giving it a four since I needed to add some flour to the apple mixture to thicken it up a little and I wish I would have added more apples(maybe 6 or even 7 cups of apples) to make it a thicker pie(as in higher).  The taste was great though.  I did add some cinnamon to the topping and as per the other comments I used half white and half brown for the sugar with the apples.  Also I did melt a small amount of butter to brush the bottom of the pie shell with before adding apples to help the crust crisp up more.

This pie was excellent, everyone loved it. I did look at the reviews and made the recommended adjustments and it was delicious! Now I know that I will have to make 2 pies next time, the empty pie plate left the family wanting more.

Absolutely loved this recipe. First time making an apple pie and this turned out fantastic! I made it a few more times and just baked at a lower temperture for a longer time,and sliced the apples thinner which made the filling softer. Great and simple recipe.

My husband and I decided out of the blue to bake a pie....for the 1st time!!  We used pillsbury ready made crust and Cortland apples!!  I looked at other reviews and floured the apples and used brown sugar w/ the cinnamon to sprinkle over the apples!!!  Also cooked at 375 for 50 min.  It was AMAZING.....taste, look and texture!!!  I'm soooo impressed with us - thanks for a great recipe!!!

My pies are in the oven right now! Hopefully they turn out amazing. The first pie I followed the recipe exactly and my crumble turned out more like a dough :/ the second pie I added brown sugar and extra flour and it came out, well crumblier! cant wait to taste test the results!

I agree with previous raters, add the flour in with the apples and use at least 50% brown sugar.  Otherwise, this is a very good recipe.  It is a keeper!  I like to use a variety of apples with differing amounts of sweetness/tartness.

WOW! I was looking for an apple pie recipe similar to my friend mom's recipe and this was the closest to it. She makes her own crust and I used a Pillsbury ready to bake pie crust. I did mix my apples with 1 1/2 Tbsp of flour, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, 1/2 white sugar and 1 tbsp lemon juice. The crumble tastes like sugar cookies because it got a little crunchy. I made some homemade whipped cream to go along with it (Alton Brown's recipe). I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt it was waaaaay tooo sweet. Next time I will use GRANNY SMITH apples, cut back on the sugar, mix in more spices in the filling and crumble. GREAT RECIPE.

This ended up quite runny.  I did add 2 tbsp of flour to the sugar, cinnamon mixture, before I stirred it with the apples.  The flavor was good, but would suggest adding more flour to the mixture.

Absolutely delicious apple pie!  As others have said, make sure to mix the apples with the dry ingredients before placing into the pie crust.  Apart from that, just a touch more cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg, and you've got a pie that tastes like Grandma baked it.

Great recipe!!  I forgot and didn't buy deep dish but it didn't make a difference, definitely suggest using Granny Smith apples.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pie!  Make sure you put the pie on a cookie sheet because you will have over "flow" until you learn where to stop putting apples!  This pie has become a tradition in my house....ALL holidays it is a MUST!  Mine don't brown on top as well  as I would like it, but I think that is b/c of the all purpose flour!  You will not regret doing this!

I've never understood why this isn't a 5 star recipe. I've made it countless times, following the recipe exactly. It couldn't be easier and everyone LOVES it. This year I decided to try the grandma ople recipe to see what all the fuss is about and everyone was disappointing when they found out I wouldn't be making this one. Especially if apples are your favorite part of apple pie, this is your recipe.

Great pie!  Easy to make, very tasty!  I REALLY love crumble topping, so I double the crumble topping.  I also added the 1/4 cup flour to the apples to thicken it a little. VERY GOOD!  Have made this 3 times and would definitely recommend it.

I thought this pie was really good, I did 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar and mixed it in with the apples before layering them into the crust. The timing and everything was perfect. I might add a little extra flour to soak up the juices from the apples. Simple, but good pie.

I did a no-no and made my pie kinda differently. I didnt put the crumble on it, I put another crust on top. Other than that I followed the recipe closely. I mixed the apple with cinnamon, sugar and flour. I dotted with butter put the crust on top and baked it at 400 for about 25 minutes, turned down to 350 and baked for about 25 more. Excellent!

Way too easy to not make often - followed the directions to the letter, and it was a little too sweet - the more tart the apples, the better, or else use just a little less sugar.

I used this recipe to make my very first fruit pie ever.  I did change up a few things, but it turned out perfectly and was a very good base to start from.  For the top crust I used whole wheat flour, a generous handful of oats, brown sugar and only about 3-4 tbsp of softened margarine.  The filling was 3 golden delicious apples, about a 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour, cinnamon and then only 1/2 cup of sugar mixed up together before dumping into the pie crust.  I also used a pre-made frozen store-bought crust.  It was absolutly perfect after about 30 minutes in the oven at 375 degrees F and it tasted better the next day.

What a great combination. Applie pie and Apple Crisp. Or at least that is the way I looked at it. I made two pies. One as stated in the recipe. The second I added oats to the crumble mix. I preferred it with the oats. Thereby, combining two of my favorite deserts. Apple Pie and Apple Crisp.

Very good! I took the suggestions from the front page, though I'll probably add more cinnamon next time and cook at a lower temperature. the crumble was more of a crust (: I also used 5 apples, but next time I'll use more.. You notice it in the pictures: there really isn't a lot of apple filling. or at least not enough to meet my standards for an apple crumble pie ;) Will make again!

I took other reviewers advice and mixed the apple with brown & white sugar as well as flour before putting it in the pie dish.  Got rave reviews for this on Thanksgiving.  My husband has requested that I make this again and often.  Thanks for a great easy recipe.

Fabulous recipe -- if you make some of the changes suggested by the other reviewers.  Toss apples (I used 6 cups in a Tenderflake deep dish crust.)  Toss them with the 1/4 c flour, half brown and half white sugar, and a half tsp of nutmeg along with the cinnamon.  For the topping, I used brown sugar and added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Baked for an hour at 350 - make sure you check so that the topping doesn't burn.  I have a really old oven in the place we are living right now, and couldn't put the pie on the oven floor, but cooked it on the lowest rack possible for the entire cooking time and the crust turned out fine.  Got rave reviews!

My husband & I loved this recipe. I followed other reviewers' advice & tossed the sliced apples with a small amount of flour. I also made two layers of apples, each topped with 1/2 of the sugar & cinnamon mix.  I used red & green delicious apples that were getting old. I used my own recipe for a homemade crust that is very flaky. The pie was wonderful, & my husband said it was the first apple pie he had eaten that was not runny.

This pie is pretty good! Definetly have to coat sliced apples with flour and sugar cinnamon mixture so syrup won't be too runny.  I liked mine a little bit crunchy so I took it out 3 minutes for schedule time.

This was really good. I used 10 apples, since they do cook down. I also added about 2 tablespoons lime juice in a bowl with the apples, to keep them from browning. I did not pour the sugar mixture over the apples, instead I mixed it into the bowl with the apples. I baked for about 20 minutes before adding the topping.

SO DELICIOUS! Hands down the best pie I have ever made/ tasted! My only qualm is that the crumble topping does not stay crisp, after a few hours it absorbs moisture and becomes more chewy. Changes: 1)used half white/ half brown sugar 2)added 2 tbsp flour and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to apple-coating mixture. I used a 9.5" pie dish, so I had to increase the crumble topping by half. Baked for 50 min. and left it in the turned-off oven for a while as I had gone out of the house while it baked. Came out beautiful and lightly browned on top. I used Basic Flaky Pie Crust for the bottom crust, added 1 tbsp white sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla to the recipe. Thank you, Penny! This recipe is gold!

I'm not sure why this pie is getting so many 5 stars. I hate to say this, I really do, but it's really not that good. I don't know why I strayed from my usual recipe, I guess I wanted to try something new. I knew something was weird when I saw that no flour was added to the apples. I wasn't sure how that yummy apple sauce would form without it, then thought, "Eh, maybe I'm about to learn something new." Nope, as I should've known the inside of the pie turned out dry and the top (due to the flour) was a little mushy, instead of crisp and crumbly. This plan makes no sense to me whatsoever.

Great recipe! My boyfriend & I loved it! Only change I made was to mix the sugar & cinnamon with the apples & cooked it first & then reduced the sauce before pouring them into the pie crust & baking on the oven floor for the first 20 minutes! Absolutely loved it, thanks!

I have to say that usually I hate apple pie, not a big fan of apples, but this pie is excellent! My husband bought a bag of cheap apples and hated them; we didn't want to waste them so I offered to make him a pie.  We both thought the pie would be mediocre at best, we were floored when it turned out to be the best apple pie we had ever had AND simple to make.  Thank you!

This is the first time I tried to an apple pie recipe and it was a great hit.  As other reviewers suggested I made it together with the Best Ever pie crust and it worked out really well.

This recipe is soooo good!! I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg. I used 2 granny smith and 2 fuji apples which made up just about 5 cups of apple.  The rest of the recipe I followed exactly and it turned out great! YUM!

This was the first apple pie I'd ever made (I used it with Best Ever Pie Crust from this website).  It was a huge hit at the picnic I brought it to.  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  Great recipe!

A definite favorite.  I found that the pie sometimes turns out watery so I add 2-3 tablespoons of flour to the apple mixture.

Whenever I first try a recpe, I always follow it to the letter. This recipe was simple and straight-forward. The pie cooked up great. Very tasty. A little too sweet, though. I used about half the suggested sugar/cinnamon part in subsequent pies. Terrific!

It was easy to make, especially since I am not good at making pies.  I followed some suggetions and lowered the temp to 350 and also combined the sugar with the apples before placing them in the pie crust.  My husband loved the pie so much he asked me to make it soon again.

I usually make two of these each Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner while the turkey is in the oven. I put them in as soon as the turkey comes out so that they're still hot. This pie is absolutely fantastic and great with a bit of ice cream.

Baked this pie for the first time over the past weekend for my family. Before placing the apples in the pie shell i mixed them in some of the sugar/cinnamon mixure instead of just one sprinkle as noted in the recipe. Sweetness and slight tartness of Granny Smith made for a very tasty pie. Topping was great as well.

Made this a few times, its great!  I followed some recommendations of other users:
1) mix a bit of flower in with the cin and sugar.
2) Mix the apples in a bowl with the cin/sug/flour mixture so they are all coated
3) cooked at 325 for ~ 1 hour so that the top doesnt burn and gives the pie more time to cook.
Server with Vanilla ice cream and it was delicious!!

It was tough to rate this one.  My husband absolutely loved it and gave it a 5.  I thought it was just Ok and would have given it a 2 because I thought it was just way too sweet and   also thought the filling was too runny.  I did like the topping though. I am going to try this again but with some flour mixed in with the filling and also with less sugar in the filling.  I think it's a matter of personal taste and since my husband loved it, and he's the apple crumb expert in the family I gave it a 4.

Great apple pie!  I like to use Jonathan apples for this one.  The only change I make is to add 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I don't always use all of the crumb topping...just enough to coat the top.

This pie turned out very, VERY sweet and the apples did not get as soft as I would prefer either. The filling itself was kind of runny.  It seemed to thicken after keeping it in the fridge for a little while.  I also had to bake it closer to 50 minutes versus the suggested 35 to 40.  All in all it was good for my first attempt at making homemade apple pie, but I would alter the recipe if I make it again.

This pie was very good, it would have been a 5 if it wasn't so watery. I added vanilla and cinnamon in the topping and added cinnamon and nutmeg (and did half white/half brown sugar)  in the apples, which i mixed together before placing them in the pie, as another reviewer suggested.  Overall a simple and easy pie to make.

I really enjoyed making this pie it was quick and easy. I used granny smith apples and I felt it needed more sugar. Next time I make this pie I will follow the other reviewers suggestions and use brown and white sugars and add vanilla to the topping. Otherwise great pie :)

I loved this because it was such a simple alternative to rolling out dough for a "real" apple pie."  It was delicious (especially the crumble on top)-- only thing I would try to change next time is that it is a little too watery. I might add a little something to thicken the apple mixture.

Delicious recipe for a quick and easy apple pie!  I baked it exactly as the recipe called for except I lowered the baking time to 30 minutes.  My only complaint is that the crumble topping was still slightly overcooked.  25 minutes would have been better in my oven, here on the east coast. I may try lowering the oven temp to 375 degrees next time.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out wonderfully! Even my husband, who doesn't really like desserts, loved it! My favorite part is the crumble topping. Will definitely keep as my standard apple pie recipe!

Great pie! I followed the advice of others - used brown and white sugar and layered it in with the apples. Also added 1 Tbsp of flour with the apples. The pie was wonderful and it will be a new Thanksgiving tradition in our house.

Excellent recipe.  I added a little extra topping, and it turned out a bit too doughy, so I don't recommend that.  It's such an easy recipe, and so delicious.  Thank you!

Fantabulous pie!  I've made this for holiday gatherings and other parties and everyone always loooooves it!!!  When I baked it for my then-boyfriend (now-husband), he nearly exploded with joy.  I like to think my baking this pie gave him a slight push towards him marrying me. *giggle*

Loved this pie. I've been making the two crust apple pie off of the Pillsbury pie crust box. It has become my husband's favorite. Now he has a new favorite. I also added some brown sugar to the topping - - excellent. Thank you!

This was a good recipe.  As weird as it sounds, I'm not too keen on fruit pies...or any pie for that matter that has a regular pastry crust.  Too much crust for me and it usually ends up soggy.  However, with this pie, the crumble more than made up for the (gasp) crust on the bottom...lol.  I did add a little flour over the apples, and used half brown sugar, half white sugar.  Other than that, it was great as is!

I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and added flour to the apple mixture as suggested by another reviewer.  However, I don't think I would add the flour again--it made my pie very dry.  Maybe my apples just weren't as juicy.  The topping was very good though.

Yummy! I followed all the recommendations. Half-half for brown and white sugar, Quarter more flour and it turns out wonderful. Friends love it but thought it's a little too sweet. Might cut down slightly on the sugar next time.

My husband and his friend LOVED this pie. I only got one slice! I did modify it like a couple of other people who posted reviews. I used 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar in place of the half cup white. I also used 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of the 1/3 white for the crumble top. Regardless of the slight modifications, it is a great base recipe!

This was okay.  It was a nice variation from the typical apple pie but it wasn't that great.  My husband loves apple crumble pie and he was not overwhelmed.  In fact, he said not to bother making it again.  

The topping wasn't what I'd hoped for.  There wasn't enough spice even though I'd added cinnamon to the topping.  All in all, it was a good attempt but isn't worth repeating.

It was a tasty apple crumble! I did however make a few changes. It was divine!  Since I am the only one with a sweet tooth in my family, instead of wasting a whole pie I thought making individual portions would be great and therefore used 5 ramekins.  What I did: I took the suggestions of other reviewers with the 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 flour so the filling would not be runny. The crust recipe I used was also from All Recipes entitled "Best Ever Pie Crust".  I rolled out the dough and cut circles slightly larger than the perimeter of the ramekin. I draped each circle over each ramekin and molded it to the shape of the ramekin. As for the apples I used Gala apples and sliced them thinly with mandoline.  I also lowered the cooking temperature to 325 degrees and baked the ramekins for 1 hour until the crumble on top was perfectly golden.  Overall the apple crumble was a perfect balance of sweetness.

Fabulous! Everybody raves that this is the best apple pie they've ever had. So simple, I've made it 6 times in the past 3 weeks. Added a cup of cranberries last two times and it's even better. Try mixing Jonathan, Pippin and Granny Smith apples. I also used brown sugar for the topping and Marie Calendars pie shell. A++++

I used this with the "Best Ever Pie Crust" from this site and it was sooooo goood!  My husband asked me where I bought it!! I would give it 10 stars if I could. I did make a couple adjustments though, I used flour, 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar as many of you suggested, mixed them all together and instead of white sugar for the crisp, I used half confectioners sugar and half white and it was so delicious!!

Oh boy! I'm going to give this recipe 5 stars despite the fact it was a tad too sweet for me (even though I used 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c white sugar, and all brown sugar in the crumble topping. I'll use less next time). I made this with Fuji apples, as that's what I had. I thought they were perfectly firm and sweet. The crumble top is really delicious! Great recipe. Thanks, Penny!

This was a tasty pie.I used granny smith apples and it wasn't quite as sweet as I would have liked.  Next time I'll add a bit more sugar.

Excellent!  We have an apple orchard in our backyard, so making this pie is especially quick and easy.  My family absolutely loved it, and many of them commented on how they usually do not like apple pie.  I have already made it three times in the past week.

I thought this crumble was delicious!  I did do some of the recommended changes, i.e., tossed the apples w/flour, cinnamon, & sugar *before* placing them in the pie.  And I made the crumble w/ equal parts brown sugar & regular sugar.  I also used Fuji apples, simply because my mother grows them and gave me far too many to eat on my own.  Some of the apples aren't as soft as I would like them to be, so I would probably use a different variety or a different combination of apples next time.  Overall, a wonderful recipe that I would make again!!!  Oh, and the boyfriend served himself a warm piece with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and gave it an A++++!

DELICIOUS. The best pie I've ever made!
I mixed the apples with the cinnamon, half brown half white sugar, pinch nutmeg, and 1/4 cup flour.
For the crumble, I added some chopped pecans and mixed brown and white sugar with only 4 tbsp of butter. I'll certainly do it again! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

Overall, very good!  I will make again.  This was my first attempt at an apple pie.  I used Rome baking apples, since the recipe didn't specify what variety.  (I like Granny Smith, but I was afraid it would be too tart.)  I added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I also sprinkled some cinnamon into the crumble mixture.  Used frozen deep dish crust, and replaced 1/4 cup of the crumble flour with oats.  Pie was very watery.  Will toss apples with flour next time.  Crumble was a bit too sugary-sweet, so next time I'll use brown sugar to give it more richness.  I'll probably also use a bit less butter.  I like crumble topping a tad on the dry side.  The moisture from the brown sugar will probably compensate for less butter.

Wonderful recipe.  I used a 9 inch Keebler Graham Pie Crust and used Golden Delicious apples.  They were average size and I only had to use two apples.  I cut the crumble topping in half to reduce the calories, and it turned out perfect.  Place aluminum foil along the edges of the pie crust to keep them from burning.  Thank you so much for the delicious recipe.  Will definately make again.

Very easy to make.  I fried the apples on very low heat while slicing all the apples.  I also screwed up with the crumble, so instead of crumble it was a sauce.  But everything turned out just fine.

Did not like this recipe at all...the apple were raw and the mixture was watery instead of gooey.  Would not ever eat this again.

I used the food processer to chop the apples, and it sliced them to perfection for this pie. I highly recommend as others have, mixing the apples and mix up before putting in the pie shell.
This recipe will be kept around and used over and over!

I never thought I'd say but I think I prefer this topping to the traditional brown sugar topping.  It's lighter and very attractive as well. I haven't made a two crusted apple pie (or any kind of pie for that matter) in over 10 years, so I consider myself a bit of an expert on crumb toppings and I really liked this alot

This is a simple and delicious apple pie recipe.  I used a food processor to slice Granny Smith apples very thin.  I also added a heaping tablespoon of flour and nutmeg to the apple mixture as suggested by others!  Thanks!

Not bad but the ingredients were too much for just one pie.  I had enough for two.  The crumb topping was a bit bland.  I'll try it again next time by spicing it up a little.

This was the first apple pie I ever made and it was great!  I was going to a dinner party and said I'd bring an apple pie, so I found this recipe and made it, using a frozen bottom crust, and everyone loved it.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This pie was really good.  I'd never made anything like it before, but since I bought the pie crust, it was even easier.  Everyone liked it.  I used Granny Smiths and threw down some french vanilla ice cream, and all was very good, though peeling all those apples took a little while.

Thanks.

Made this for Thanksgiving...no one really liked it, and I had a houseful of company. Guess everyone's just used to traditional apple pie here...the apple's on this pie got kinda hard on the top due to there not being a top crust.

After reading all of the reviews, I made the decision to add flour to the apples to minimize the juices and I added cinnamon to the topping.  This pie was excellent and a big hit.

Very easy. I stirred about a tablespoon of cornstarch into the sugar before pouring over the apples.

I liked this pie.  My husband LOVED this pie!  He has volunteered this information several time since I made it last night.  My only complaint is that the crumbs on top were a bit too powdery.  Not the best mouth feel, but the taste is DELICIOUS!  I used quite a bit more cinnamon and added a good tablespoon of cornstarch to the sugar/cinnamon mixture to cut down on the liquid.  It worked like a charm.  My toddler is strictly a cream or custard pie type of a guy so I didn't give it a kid rating.  However, the fifteen minutes I spend preparing the apples while my guy sat next to me and snagged pieces of apple while we chatted just as I used to do with my grandmother was absolutely priceless.  Thanks.

I have NEVER made a pie from scratch and didn't think I ever would, but this pie
was very very easy and absolutely DELICIOUS!!!. I used apple filling rather than
fresh apples to simplify my first attempt and it was awesome.  I added a little
extra cinnamon/sugar to the filling and on top of the crumble mixture and it
really added that sweet touch.

This pie recipe was wonderful.  The crumb topping looked and tasted great, 
and using a premade crust made the recipe surprisingly easy.  The only changes
I made was doubling the cinnamon, adding a touch of nutmeg and allspice, and
sprinkling first cinnamon then powdered sugar on top of crumbs, to give it a
nice 'finished' look.  The pie got rave reviews from my family, and I recommend
it 100%.

This was so easy my 5 year old daughter helped me and it was a joy (not a fiasco) to do it with her.  Not only that, but it was outragously delicious and I received many compliments when served.  I am baking another for Thanksgiving dinner at my moms.  Thanks.

This was soooo good!  My mother-in-law usually makes this type of pie on Thanksgiving.  It's my husband's favorite.  She'll be out of town this year, so I looked up this recipe.  This was my first time making pie.  I didn't know what kind of apples to buy, so I used 2 small Gala apples, and a large Granny Smith.  I used 1/3 sugar with the apples instead of 1/2.  I have to say, this was the best apple pie I've ever had!  My husband, a VERY PICKY (If I could underline and boldface those two words, I would) eater, loved it!  I asked him if he thought it needed any changes before I noticed that he'd already eaten half the pie!  He said it was better than his mothers!  :o)

I only made this because I cut up too many apples after making the 2 crust version but only had one crust left.  I figured why waste, try a 1 crust version.
With both sitting side by side, everyone ate this one first.  It's the only one I will make from now on.

This pie was wonderful!  I made two, and my family went through BOTH in one day!  So simple, yet very delicious!  I cut down the amount of sugar because I was using Romes, which are a little sweeter than Granny Smiths, and I added a pinch of nutmeg with the cinnamon.  Highly recommended!

I first tried this recipe for a party on July 4th and it was a huge hit even though I cheated and used storebought crust. It's soooo easy to make! A few things I added was a dash of allspice to the sprinkle and the crumble and I sprinkled in the center and on top of the apple pile. Thanks!

This recipe was really as delicious as everyone stated in their reviews!  I have one piece of advice:  This recipe was SO much easier to make with one of those apple peeler-corer-slicer machines. The kids love to use this thing, and it sliced the apples so much thinner than I would have the patience for.

This crumb apple pie was excellent, perfect ratios of butter to flour to sugar to make a delicious, melt in your mouth topping to any apple pie. Thanks for helping make my apple pie a hit at the office.

This is a fantastic pie!  I am a newly wed and my husband was going on and on about how he wanted me to bake a pie.  So one day while he was at work I decided to go ahead and try it.  This recipe was very easy to follow and it tasted great!  He bragged to all his friends about it!

This was my first apple pie. I made it for my in-laws for Thanksgiving. It was wonderful! My father in law loved it - had 2 helpings. I made it the day before and it was excellent. My pie wasn't watery at all. I was a bit concerned after making it because I used Red Delicious apples and thought maybe I should have used Granny Smith but it turned out great. Thanks for posting this recipe - it's a keeper.

this pie was WONDERFUL! Some of the reviews said their pies came out soggy, so I made a crust and pre-baked it. My pie came out crispy and delicious! I'll definitely make it again, as it was a hit with my dinner guests as well.

While I love to bake, I've never mastered a good pie crust.  I used a frozen deep-dish pie crust and suddenly my hubby thinks I can bake a pie.  Thanks for this quick and easy - and let's not forget delicious - recipe.  I piled Granny Smith's high and patted down the crumb crust to keep it in place.  Final result was a beautiful, even pie.  Next time I might add just a smidgen of cinnamon (1/8 tsp or less) to the crumb topping.

Easy to make (especially with frozen pie crust) but far too sweet for my taste! Next time I'll try cutting the amt of sugar and adding more cinnamon.

I made this earlier this week as my first-ever apple pie and I've already made another one. My husband and I devoured it! I used a ready-made pie shell, so the only effort was slicing the apples. Easy and delicious!

Amazing apple pie! As other reviewers suggested, I mix 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon to the apples in a bowl before dumping it all in the pie crust. Once cooled, the pie filling was thick and perfect! The amount of crumble topping was perfect. Yum!

I had some left over pie dough fro thanksgiving, but not quite enough for a 9” pie, so I used a low tart dish and cut the recipe by about a third — worked great, and super easy!

Very good! I used gala apples and it turned out great! I did use brown sugar for the crumb topping.

This pie was the first to go after Thanksgiving dinner( we hade five flavors). I took another’s recommendation..(1) added about 1/4 cup of flour to the apple mixture to absorb apple juices; (2) instead of mixing apples with 1/2 cup white sugar, I used 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar; (3) in a bowl, mix the apples and sugars and cinnamin before putting it in the pie (as opposed to sprinkling the sugar on top of the apples in the pie crust) 

Added a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping.

The best apple pie I ever had. As other reviewers suggested, I replaced half the sugar with brown sugar.  And I used pre-packaged tart apple slices to save time.

I used this recipe as the base for my pie.  I took the advice of others here and it came out awesome.  I used my spiralizer to ribbon cut 10 medium apples that were peeled. If you place your core in the right spot it also cores your apples.   I mixed apples  with 1/4 C each brown and white sugar (the filling was a bit tart- next time I’ll add more), 1tsp cinnamon and 1/4 C flour.  I piled it into the pie crust and double the topping by adding more butter and a box of vanilla pudding.  
Baked on 400 for 25 minutes and 350 for 35 minutes.

Wow, easiest baked dessert ever!  It was a huge hit.  For me especially.  The most time consuming part was preparing the apples, lol.  Once that was done the rest came together very quickly.

Overall it was great. But there was liquid in the pie which i think came from the apples but, I cannot be sure as I am new to baking. Other than that it was amazing.

I made this for my family. 1. The crumble makes and apple pie look bad so much better then some dough. 2. My father said this was the best apple pie he ever had. 3. Add some cornstarch to the apples so that it can soak up the moisture and it makes sure that there is no juice stuff when you cut into your finished pie.

The cinnamon ended up being more like a cinnamon roll, very gooey. It might be better to chill first. It was good but not my fave.

We go apple picking every year.  This was definitely the favorite of the entire family, the best apple pie I've ever made!  I actually used regular Cortland  and Empire apples, those are the kinds we pick, and it came out just great.  This pie was gone so quickly, I only got one piece!

I made this pie exactly as listed and thought it was pretty blah.  Also, the apples weren’t as soft as I’d prefer them. Disappointing.

I followed others and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar plus flour and mixed with the apples instead of layering on top.  I did not measure apples, I used 6 granny smith's.

I took advice from other posters, I added 1/4 cup flour to the pie filling and mixed the sugar, cinnamon and flour with the apples in a gallon ziploc before dumping into the crust. I added about a teaspoon of almond extract to the pie filling. I also used a store-bought rolled crust.

For the crumble, I used half flour and half almond flour plus I mixed in a 1/4 cup of flax meal. I used 1/4 cup of sugar in the crumble, and you could definitely go a little lighter, especially if you plan to serve with ice cream or make a salted caramel drizzle for the top.

I cooked at 375 for 1 hour and 15 minutes... so yummy!!!

Used a little less sugar than the recipe says, like I always do, and it was amazing!! Had some cortland apples that were awfully sour for eating for some reason and so I used them in this pie. Best apple pie hands down!!!

Best dessert ever. Two favorites  made into one! Time consuming, but very worth it! I did follow advice of one person and lightly coated apple slices with flour. I  used brown sugar sprinkled on top of the apples before putting topping on top. I also sprinkled  Kernel Season's Milk Chocolate Caramel all over the apples and mixed it into the topping. Used ready made pie crust. Hubby wanted to eat it all. Me too. I did put chocolate ice cream on top. Next time I'll put a pie crust on top. Will try other fruit too.

Good pie. I baked mine at 375 for 10 minutes and then at 350 for another 30.  That was perfect in my oven.   Also, per another reviewer, I used half brown sugar and half white and added 3 tbs of flour to the apple mixture.   My family loved it.

This was way easy to make, quick, and turned out fantastic! My husband said he doesn't think he could ever get tired of it, and now asks me when I am making more! I've had to make it three times in two weeks! I used Fuji apples btw. Nice work!

I mixed the flour, sugar and cinnamon with the apples and used Splenda instead of real sugar.  My husband loved it.  Will make again.   Used Grandma's secret piecrust also.

Based on other reviews, I did three things differently. I tossed the sliced apples in the spices/sugar, I added a small amount to flour to offset the wetness of the apples, and I baked at 350 for more time.  This is what an apple pie should be. Just enough sweetness, still allows the apple flavor to shine through, and the top is awesome. It got rave reviews, and was super easy to make.

I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out PERFECT. I don't know why some of the pictures look the way they do. The only thing I can think of that I did, that wasn't blatantly said, is that I cut the apples up small - almost like cubes. No, I did not flour the apples. No, it was not soupy at all. The party was so impressed!

Made this for the first time with my kids with macs. They didn't slice the apples too thinly but it didn't affect the overall outcome.This was delicious! With some whipped cream it was even better. Will definitely make again.

It tasted good (but not the best I have ever made) but was runny even after baking for longer than suggested. Although it was good, I wouldn’t make it again.

You MUST try this pie. A family and friend favorite - such a great, delicious pie! I replace all the white with light brown sugar, and sprinkle a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg in the flour mixture.

This was a really good recipe and very easy. I used four large Granny Smith apples. I used my own granny's pie crust recipe, which is always delicious. I sprinkled the cinnamon-sugar mixture between the different layers of apples instead of all on top. Also, I covered the top with foil so it wouldn't burn, and I tried doing it at 350 for an hour, but it wasn't done yet, so I turned up the heat and left it in longer. Tart but good and got great reviews at Thanksgiving.

I LOVED this recipe! It was so easy! ? followed another poster’s advice on small changes: 1) adding 1/4 flour to the apples to absorb juices 2) on the apple mixture, do half white sugar and half brown sugar, 3) I also crushed ginger snap cookies I had in the pantry and sprinkled those on top of the apples but beneath the crumble, 4) I cooked at 375 for approximately 45-50 minutes. I also used a refrigerated pie crust because I don’t have skills for pastry yet! Good luck and try not to eat the whole pie on your own!!

We loved this pie!  The only changes that I made was that I mixed the sugar with the apples and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  I also baked the pie at 350° for a longer time to ensure the apples were done.  Great pie!

No changes to this recipe were nessesary. However, I always sprinkle and toss my apples with most of the cinnamon/ sugar mixture because I like them evenly coated and sprinkle the last bit over top. Used Macintosh apples and did not add any flour as some other reviews and it came out perfect, not runny.

This was delicious; I did as others and used a combination of brown sugar and white sugar, and 1/4 cup flour which I combined and mixed with the apples before placing in the pie shell.
 A pie is only ever as good as the crust used; and for this one I tried a press in crust, which combined 1.5 cups flour, 1.2 tsp. salt, 1/4 c. sugar, 8 Tb. butter, 3 Tb. coconut oil (melt both shortenings). Put the crust in the freezer while you're slicing the apples for the recipe.  I also baked the pie longer than 40 min. since the apples were not quite soft enough at 40 min. I placed some foil over the fluted edges of the crust to prevent over browning during the additional 10-15 min. required. Everyone raved about this pie and crust. Truly delicious combination.

Try making this in a Pyrex baking dish  without the pie crust - as my grandmother  did. She also made traditional apple pie, but this one, which she called Candied Apple Pie, is still a family favorite - for dessert or, leftover, for breakfast. Warm with a little ice cream or whipped cream, there is nothing better. Use brown sugar with the flour and butter topping. Without a crust, you don't need to worry about how juicy the apples are. We favor tart apples, especially varieties from New York State. Spice is unnecessary when the apples have enough flavor to stand on their own.

I used Splenda (Walmart version) for the 1/2 cup sugar, but used real sugar for the top since it needed to brown. I also was more generous with the cinnamon, added nutmeg and vanilla. This was my first ever home made pie, and it turned out so great, thanks.

I have never had success with apple pies, but this one was easy and not runny.  I did add the 2 tablespoons of flour to the apples.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 of allspice and split the sugar to 1/4 cup of brown and 1/4 cup of white sugar.

Made this twice now and it was a hit both times. I used a little less sugar/cinnamon mix. Found it to be a little sweet but that will also depend on individual taste.

I loved this recipe! It was simply amazing! Me and my fiancé made it together and it was to die for! So we wanted to make it again but since we liked the crumble best, we decided to only make the crumble. And guess what, its amazing by itself as well as with the rest of the pie! You guys should try it!!!

This is absolutely delicious. The only thing I did differently was add the flour that many reviewers suggested. Also, I mixed the apples and ingredients in a bowl rather than sprinkling on top. I'm not a huge pie person but I like this with the crumble on top. I'm looking to build my "go to" recipes instead of searching every time I want to make something. This one is going in my recipe binder and will be the Apple pie I make from now on. I used the "Butter Flakey Pie Crust" by Dana on this site and it was wonderful. Thank you.

So good!! I did 1/4 sugar and 1/4 brown sugar for the filling. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and tossed the apples in flour. I put a layer of apples on the bottom and then sprinkled the sugar mix over them. I did another layer of apples and then sprinkled a spoon full of flour, then the sugar and repeat. My crumble was not crumbly at all so I kept adding flour and whisking it with a fork until it crumbled. I also used half sugar and half brown sugar in the crumble. The was the first apple pie I have made (2nd pie made ever) and it was so yummy!!

This recipe as-is is worth 3 stars. It is too sweet, not spiced enough and produces a soggy crust. I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar in pie and in topping . I also added 2 tbs flour to the apples which was not enough, I recommend 1/4 c. I used 1 tsp cinnamon in the topping, and 1 tsp with the apples plus 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a pinch of cloves. My changes improved the recipe greatly, everyone liked it, but it was still too sweet, recommend to use 1/2 the sugar with the apples.

I made it exactly according to the recipe and I have agree with other reviewers that it needs flour mixed in with the apples. My pie was runny but still delicious.

Best apple pie I've tasted!  I like spices, so I added pinch of cloves, 1/2  teaspoon allspice, apple pie spice, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, plus a tablespoon of vanilla.  Also increased sugar in apple slices to 2/3 cup for the apples I used.

What a delicious pie - one of the best apple pies I've made.  I did add 1/4 cup flour with cinnamon and nutmeg to the apple mixture, and cinnamon and nutmeg to the pie crust.  Need to find a gluten-free pie crust recipe though!

I followed the modifications I found in most comments: coat the apples in the sugar & spice mix and a bit of flour before laying them on the pastry base, bake at 180C instead of 200C, and mix brown and white sugar. Delicious and very easy to make.

This was SO delicious! I've never made apple pie before, even though my hubby loves it. Needless to say, he was super happy! I like the crumble on top. 

Changes:
I read some reviews that said it was too runny and they had to add flour. Except I'm only reading those now, after the pie has been made (and eaten). Without realizing it would be a good thing, I cut up the apples one day and put them in a container in the fridge, since I didn't have time to finish the pie at that point. They stayed in the fridge for a day or two. I'm thinking this probably helped dry out the extra juice, because the consistency was perfect! Plus, it saved on time the day I made it!

I only used a 1/2 cup sugar TOTAL. It just seemed like so much sugar. I mixed the 1/2 cup with the cinnamon like the recipe says. I sprinkled a LOT of it onto the apples. After it seemed it had been thoroughly covered, I measured out the amount I had left and it came out to 1/3 of a cup! I decided to use this cinnamon sugar to make the crumble. So I mixed it with the flour and followed everything else the recipe says.

Definitely sweet enough and it was DELICIOUS. Note-to-self: Make sure to have vanilla ice cream to serve with the pie for a happier husband! :)

Yes, I will make this again!  This was one of the easiest pies I ever made and sooooo good!  I did toss the apples in a plastic bag with 1/4 cup flour.  Then I added 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, the cinnamon and some cloves to the bag and shook it some more.  I put the mixture into the crust, sprinkled the rest of the ingredients on it and baked.

I'm a huge fan of this pie, for the crumble topping. The filling is only ok for me. I make adjustments by tossing the apples in lemon juice, adding 1tbsp flour to the cinnamon/sugar mixture, providing a stickier coating to the apples. I also add a handful of caramel pieces to the filling.

This is a fabulous pie! The only thing I did differently is use 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar instead of 1/2 c. white sugar for the apples. I also added 3 Tbsp flour into the cinnamon/sugar mix, and I mixed my apples in the cinnamon/sugar before putting them in the pie shell. Followed everything else as directed and the pie turned out incredible. I will definitely make this again!

TIP After reading reviews noticed  too soggy many times. TRY this.I have been making pies, strudel, for 65+ years. Apple peach, berries, nectarines, etc. Here is a tip my grandmother taught me. BEFORE putting fruit in pie shell put a piece of toast or bread cumbs, then put the fruit on top. The bread absorbs the juice. Family will be fighting over a piece with the bread. If you look at srudel recipes, they call for beadcrunbs. So good try it

Super easy and quick to throw together. The crumble came out a little mushy instead of crispy but this is so good. Added 1/4 cup flour like Buoniconto said (and mixed it all together before loading the pie crust and it worked out well. I can see how brown sugar for part of the topping could be nice. Will try that next time.  Used Pillsbury pie crust and it browned more than I had  hoped. Might have to cover the edges half way through next time.  Granny smith apples worked out well - it wasn't overly sweet.

great idea...I however spiced this up a bit with cloves nutmeg and lemon juice in the apple mixture before layering the apples in the dish, I also cut the (Honeycrisp )apples very thinly and added the flour to the apples to absorb the juices and make it thicker.

I used a mixture of golden delicious and jonathan apples and this was the best apple pie ever!! I brought one to my aunt and she thought it came from a bakery.  Didn't change a thing.

Tastes just like  pie only it is easier to make! I highly recommend making extra topping. Mine wasn't very crumbly. I added chopped walnuts to the top of mine. Adds a nice crunch to it.

Soooooo good! I had extra apples from going apple picking with the kiddos and had to use them.  I followed the others advice in terms of mixing ingredients (including a bit of flour) into the apples before putting them into the pie. And I put more of the crumb mixture on top. The only downside to this was I had no "special occasion" to bring this to so I just HAD to help eat it until it was gone!  My new favorite apple pie recipe!

This pie is a keeper! I did add lemon juice to the apples as I had to refrigerate them while making dinner. I also added 1/4 cup of flour to the apples as recommended by another reviewer. I used white and brown sugar, a pinch of salt and mixed all the spices with the apples before adding them to the pie shell. For ease I used my food processor for the crust and topping. I used pink lady's for my apples and really like the texture and taste. Adding this to my recipe box!

I followed similar suggestions on this recipe and it turned out really really well. I splashed the apples with a bit of lemon juice, then tossed them in flour and cinnamon sugar. I also included half brown sugar, a few tablespoons of flour, and 1/4 cup oats to the crumble topping as I like a heartier streusel. Man, oh, man do I love a crumble. I'll definitely return to this recipe.

Outstanding!  Used 5 good sized apples but needed about 4 and a half.  Very good pie.  Followed the suggestion on step baking...10 minutes at 400, 20 minutes at 350 and 20 minutes at 325.  Turned out great!

Excellent and easy to make!! I didn't change a thing in the recipe. But I did cook it for a little bit longer to brown the top a bit. But my oven always tends to be slow. It was so good on Thanksgiving with Breyer's natural vanilla ice cream. Mmmmmm!!

This is so delicious and EASY! When I do my apples, I put them in a bowl with BROWN sugar and cinnamon and mix.  Then put into the pie crust.  Put the crumb topping on as stated.  Looks so professional! :)  I have gotten so many compliments on it! I have made 3 in the last week alone!  Yummy!

I made this exactly as written, and ended up with a nice tasting but soggy pie. To eat it, we scooped the apples off the crust because it was soggy all the way through right away. Next time I will add flour to the apples before dumping them in. My husband really liked the flavour tho.

This was absolutely AMAZING!  My entire family raved about it & my 7 year old ate 3 pieces!  I coated the apples in flour then tossed them in the white sugar & cinnamon, but I also added about 3-4 tablespoons of brown sugar & a splash of milk.  Once all of the apples were well coated I poured them into the pie crust.  I didn't change the crumb topping recipe at all & I think the end result was perfect!

Great recipe. Simple, easy, and tastes good too. It's very quick and I liked the outcome. A little bit dry and sweet for me, but probably just because of the apples I used. Otherwise, great taste!

Delightful pie. I was so excited to try this! Added 1/4 C of flour, 1/4 C white sugar and 1/4 C brown sugar to the apples. I think I'll make this again.

Made this tonight using a buttery, flaky pie crust. The whole family loved it. I think I will cut the sugar down slightly in the future, its very sweet, but very, very good!

This is the first apple pie I've attempted, and I am entirely happy with the results. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and switched up the filling/crumb topping a bit (white sugar AND brown sugar, YUM!) and I love it.

I make this pie for every get together. It is so easy, and everyone says it is the best apple pie they've ever had! My tip is to half the sugars into half sugar and half brown sugar.

Added 1/4 cup flour to apples and used half white and half brown sugar on the apples.  Otherwise, made as stated using a no roll piecrust.  Wonderful results!

Delicious! Used brown sugar instead. I did coat the apples and then dip in sugar, but I needed to use more flour since it was runny. Next time I will try baking the apples first a little to get rid of the juice and then precede with recipe. Yumm! Can do without the crust as well for an apple crisp with ice cream!

I do love this pie, but I make it with a few tweaks to the recipe.  After slicing the apples, I coat them with 1/4 cup of flour.  That will help the filling from being watery.  I split the 1/2 cup sugar into 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup sugar.  I also mix the apples with the cinnamon-sugar mixture before dumping into the pie shell.

Crumble was lacking something....even though I added some cinnamon. I also did as other reviewers and added some flour, white and brown sugar with the cinnamon to the apples and tossed together before putting them in the pie shell.

Made this for Thanksgiving .  Tastes good, but way too juicy.  I dusted the apples with flour, but the crust was doughy because of all the juice.  Don't know if I'll try this one again.

This had been my got apple pie recipe for years.  I follow recipe to a T and have never had any problems.  Key to good pie is good apples sliced thin.  I have a peeler corer slicer which does all the work!  I also use recipe to make apple pie tarts.  I increase recipe to serve 12 then divide in to the tart forms.  Awesome! Great for bake sales or when individual servings needed and want a change from cupcakes or brownies.

This was absolutely amazing!  I had some apples in the fridge I wanted to use up and didn't have the five cups called for, but made it anyway.  I cut back just a bit on the sugar, flour and butter but actually added 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of 3/4 tsp as called for (we love cinnamon).  The family asked when I was going to make it again!

Just made this bad boy. College student home for spring break, first attempt to bake a pie. sorry to rhyme but it came out divine :D. followed a reviewers advice and got 4 granny smith apples. put it in a plastic ziplock bag with sugar,whole table spoon cinnamon and a half a tea spoon of vanilla.  Needed a little bit more flour to make the crumble more crumbly. overall, it tasted great! made my mom happy which was what i aimed for.

I used others suggestions & tried 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar. DON'T because it is to sweet. I think with some changes this would be a 5 star. I'll use all white sugar, but less & for the crumble I'll try 3T sugar. Add nutmeg 1/8 tsp & diffinitely put oatmeal in the topping.  I didn't get any crumble, just a layer of "stuff".  It maybe easier to just use my favorite apple pie recipe & my crumble from my bars recipes.  Did like suggestions though of 2 types of apples - never done that b/4.

I felt like this recipe was missing something. It was very tasty but it didn't satisfy my craving. I added some nuts to the topping which gave it a very nice crunch. It was a pretty good pie though.

This recipe was altered slightly with the suggestions of other cooks; mixed the flour, sugar and cinnamon before placing into the crust.  I think I heaped too many apples but it didn't landslide when sliced.  I'll make this again

I had trouble with the crumble top... it didn't crumble for me so I don't know if I did something wrong, but I ended up adding some oats and cinnamon to it until I was able to at least tear it apart a bit into little chunks. It ended up being extremely tasty though and we will definitely try this again :)

Looked and tasted great when I took it out of the oven.  Used less sugar as I do in all baking, will even use less next time.  I guess the apples I selected were too juicy as my masterpiece fell apart as I served it but hey, it tasted wonderful!

very good, next time will reduce sugar a bit to sweet. Use flour and white and brown sugar on apples. Reduce oven and cook longer as not to burn crust.

This is super good. I mixed the thinly sliced apples (golden delicious) with 1/4 cup flour and the sugar and cinnamon, put in the pie crust and topped with the crumble as written. Baked at 350 for over 1 hour until it started bubbling on the sides and wow - it is delicious. Thank you - everyone raved about how yummy this pie was - with no ice cream :)

To die for!!! I used brown sugar in place of white sugar and it turned out marvelous. I also added cinnamon in the topping for a little extra flavor boost.

This pie was awesome and easy to make!  I tossed the apples with the sugar and cinnamon before putting them in the crust, and increased the amounts for the topping slightly to make a bit extra.  I baked it about 45 mins. at 325 and it turned out perfect!  I also made a whole wheat crust for the bottom and the pie part was so delicious nobody said anything about the crust!

Super easy! Wow. This has replaced my mother's recipe. I made a double batch and baked two pies at once. 400f seemed to hot and the crust was browning to quickly. I lowered it to 350f until it was bubbly, around 45-50 minutes. Btw, my mom was ever so slightly offended that I won't be baking her recipe ever again.  ;)

Tastes great. But I can't figure out why it came out so runny for me. I followed all the instructions. The only thing I can think of is I took it out at about 35min since the crust was starting to get dark brown and didn't want it to burn. It tastes great and definitely crumbles (probably due to my runny-ness). But overall I'll try it again! :)

This recipe couldn't have been easier!  I used 3 large granny smith apples.  I did as other reviewers did and used 1/4c white and 1/4c brown sugar and 1/4c flour and coated the apples instead of springkling/layering on top.  For the crumb topping, I added an extra tablespoon butter and ommitted the sugar.  I sprinkled a dash of sugar and a dash of cinnamon over the top before popping it in the oven.  Baked at 350 for 1h 15m. Sooooo good!

Quick and easy.  Has a really good taste.  I added a bit extra cinnamon.  Was a hit with everyone here.  I will be making this one again soon.

This was the best apple pie I've made due to it's ease of preparation and how yummy it is too!  I used Cortland apples and the only thing I changed was when I made the crumble top, I thought it was a bit too floury so I added 2 more teaspoons of butter.  As for the filling, after I dumped the filling in the shell, I sprinkled an additional top layer of more cinnamon, sugar and also some brown sugar.  It came out perfect!

Excellent recipe! I loved it the first time I made it. I love the thin syrup the apples were bathed in. I normally use artifical sweeteners in almost everything, so the crumble part was a little too sweet for me; also, my crumble came out too dry. The next time I made this, I cut the crumble sugar content from 1/3 to 1/4 cup, and used a whole stick of butter instead of 6 tbsp. Also using all Granny Smith apples, the tartness made a lovely contrast with the syrup. My friends LOVED it!

Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!  It was my first time ever baking an apple pie and it didn't last a day we finished it that same night.  This will be in our Thanksgiving/Christmas dinner.  Thank you it was so easy and delicious to make.  I am very happy with this recipe!

I make this pie several times a year.  If you have an apple/corer/peeler/slicer, you can have it in the oven in 15 minutes.  So easy and so fantastic!!! Try a clay pie plate, it takes about an hour to cook, but no burning or overcooking, it is amazing!

This was so easy to make and so delicious!  I used a frozen pie shell, which I quickly baked a little per the box's instructions, and it turned out fantastic.  I've gotten many requests to make this again.  I used a mix of Granny Smith and MacIntosh apples and it was lovely.

Really liked this recipe. Like other reviews suggested, I did coat my apples in flour and layer the sugar with the apples. Also, I needed to extend the baking time by about 10-15 minutes. It turned out fantastic, thanks!

This is certainly a good apple pie, but I can't agree with the rave reviews. I found the topping rather clumpy, and I'd have liked the pie better with more apples. Grandma Ople's Apple Pie on this site it the one I find myself using again and again.

yummylicious.  I ain't a big apple pie fan, but my friends are, and I wanted a recipe to make somethin' appley for them.  Well, I was skeptical when I was mixin' it all together, seein' as how it was so simple, but when them pies came out of the oven (I made 2 from pillsbury readicrust regular size), I was impressed.  Not only did they smell good and taste good, but the little crumbly topping made 'em look good too.  Thanks for the great addition to my recipe box, and what I am sure will be a fall favorite around here :)

The pie was pretty good! This was my first attempt at making a fresh apple pie, so I followed the directions without omitting or adding anything on my own. It is a very simple recipe, with so few ingredients that I had everything I needed in house.  I brought it to my brunch party a few hours later, and when it was sliced, it was a bit too watery. Next time I will add the flour to the apples like the other reviewers suggested and hope instead of watery, the pie is more 'syrupy'. Overall, a good recipe that needs a bit of tweeking for personal taste.

This was great. Like the other reviewers, I added about a tablespoon of flour to the apples before arranging them in the crust.

Great alternative to double crust pie. Also, super easy. This was a very sweet pie. I think next time I will only use 1/3 cup of suger on the apples. Thanks!

This is SCRUMPTIOUS!!! This is the very first pie I ever made and it came out PERFECT (if I do say so myself). My fiance and his son ATE IT UP! My fiance said the cinnamon was "just right" and not overpowering. I used the "BASIC FLAKY PIE CRUST" (added 1 teaspoon of vinegar and 1 Tablespoon of sugar to that recipe for sweetness & flakiness)recipe for the crust! Lovely!!! Highly recommended! A++

I love the crumb topping. It tasted great on the pie. I thought the filling was a little bland though. I think next time I will add a little more cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg.

This was amazing. I used Gala apples, and they were the perfect flavor! 
I used wheat flour for the pie crust and in the pie as well, it was just as good!

Perfect! My husband and i made this tonight and, although we forgot to peel the apples (duh), it turned out delish! There is def. some extra "juice" when you cut it, which i'm not sure how to prevent (will need to read more reviews), but it's so so good, you won't mind :) Oh, and we only baked it for 30 min. (gas oven) and it was done.

Unbelievably impressive considering how easy it is to make!  I threw two of these together for an International Students' Thanksgiving Dinner and the Germans couldn't get enough!  I use the prepared pie dough that rolls out and fancify the edges.  No one suspects that this baby wasn't made from scratch!  Will be making again, again, and again...

I made this for Thanksgiving and the apples needed longer to cook. They were still a bit crunchy. The crumble was very good, tasted like shortbread.

Very tasty spices.  We would need to use more than 5 cups (we actually used 6) of apples the next time we make it as ours came out flat.  The topping is good, too. Nice change from the regular pie crust.

Sorry, but to me there was nothing different or better about this recipe. The crust was soggy, it wasn't sweet enough (& I used sweet apples too), the fruit slices were only semi tender & the topping was nothing out of the ordinary.  I made it exactly as submitted. I'll stay with my regular 2 crust apple pie recipe given to me many years ago by a friend's mom---there's just no way to improve on the best!

WOW! Outstanding recipe! I also followed the advice and used 1/2 brown sugar. My father, (a diabetic) loved it so much he couldn't help sneaking extra servings - the next day his blood sugar soared. I am now forbidden to ever bring this excellent dessert to my parents' house (dad just doesn't have the will power).

This was my first apple pie, turned out great. I used a frozen pie shell, washington apples. Put a layer of the mixture on the bottom, in between the apples and top. I added brown sugar, 1tsp of vanilla and 1tsp cornstarch. I used the whole stick of butter and it turns out as a crust and not a crumble, but still better than a regular pastry crust. sprinkled cinnamon on the top and covered the crust with foil. I would put something underneath the crust because some butter melted off the side.

OMG! This was soooo good. My first shot at making apple pie for my 9 year,and the three us downed 3/4's of it. Only thing I did different was adding a little flour to the apples along with the spices and mixing all together instead of layering. Served with a dollup of whipped cream and ice cream for my 9 year old. Will make again soon.

This was the first apple pie I've ever made and everyone loved it.  My boyfriend even said it was better than his grandma's.  All of his co-workers have been asking for the recipe.  I didn't change a thing and I found it to be super easy.

YUM! I made this for Thanksgiving and made it again because we loved it so much! We made more crumble because we like that part and it still turned out great! Great alternative to the traditional apple pie! and very, very easy to make... except for slicing the apples! YUM!

My first apple pie - and it turned out GREAT. I used 3 types of apples and it was so yummy! I used the recipe for 'Easy Pie Crust' found on this website as well.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving. I am not an apple pie eater, so I did not taste it, but it got rave reviews from my family! I already have requests to make another one.

Loved it!!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!  I served it with maple whipped cream (whipped cream recipe from this site w/maple extract instead of vanilla) and cinnamon ice cream (also from this site).  Dessert was the best part of dinner!

Very easy to make and delicious.  I mixed the apples with 1/4 cup flour to make a thicker filling.  Next time I would add two more tablespoons of butter to the crumble topping.

Wonderful!  I just got finished baking this pie and had to sneak a piece to taste test.  It tastes wonderful and it was so easy to make.  This would be especially great for first time apple pie bakers!  The kids loved helping to sprinkle on the crumble mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie is wonderful! I've made it several times and everyone always loves it and wants more. As others have suggested, I usually mix up the apples. It gives the pie a better taste (not as tart).

Delicious and so easy to make, especially if you have an apple peeler.  I used 5 granny smith apples and had a pretty full pie.  I mixed 1 Tbsp. of flour in with the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  The pie was perfect, not too runny and not to dry.  I took another reviewer's recommendation and added 1 Tbsp. melted butter with 2 Tbsp. real maple syrup and sprinkled over the top about 1/2 way through baking time.  I couldn't really taste the syrup so don't know if I'll do it again, but it certainly didn't hurt the flavor either.

Made this for a work event.  Everyone loved it!!!  Will make again.  I also added 50/50 brown and white sugar and 1/4 cup of each plus flour to the filling.  Was not runny at all.  Looked very pretty when sliced and placed on a serving plate.  Thanks Penny!

A great success!  I too changed the filling slightly according to some previous reviews.  To the apples I added a quarter cup EACH of brown sugar, white sugar and flour, a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon.
The result was terrrific.  The family want it again tommorow!

Great recipe but didn't blow me away. I do love apple crumb pie and am always looking for "the recipe." I think I'll stash this one away but continue on in my search.

Very good using the 50/50 white and brown sugar recommendations along with the extra flower.  Never tried it with the listed recipe.  Made it a 2nd time with granny smiths and didn't like it as much.

This was very good! I used three different types of apples. The pie has a very nice presentation when done.

Nice change of topping to have this crumbly mixture instead of traditional streusal topping. I would add flour next time though to thicken up the sauce with the apples as it was a tad runny but the flavor was delicious!

Awesome! I've tried a couple other recipes for apple pie, and this is by far the best, especially if you are looking for a pie that doesn't require a top crust. Oh, and my 16-month old daughter loves the crumble on top! :)

WONDERFUL!  So moist and tasty.  I used the recommendations on here of using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar for both parts and putting flour in with the apples.  I used only 3 apples...one fuji, one granny smith, and one macintosh.  Excellent and so easy.

This is way better than the Grandma Ople's Apple pie on this site.  Use 1/4 brown sugar, 1/4 white sugar on the apples.  I also put in nutmeg.

This pie was excellent!  I added the flour and 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar like other people recommended.  I also switched the white sugar to brown sugar in the crumb topping.  My family loved this pie so much I made a second one later in the week!

My mother-in-law's favorite dessert is Apple Pie, so I was a bit nervous about making a good one.  This is awesome and she rated it one of the best she has ever had.  I did follow some suggestions others gave, split the sugar with brown sugar and tossed with flour before baking.  I am actually making it again right now for company.  AWESOME with Ice Cream!

Pie was awesome but, I had to add tbs. flour with apples.  This helps soak up juice when apples are cooked.

Excellent Excellent! This was my first time at making a pie, and it's turned out perfect. I followed the other reviewer's instructions and mixed the apples seperately before putting them into the crust. I also added a little flour like the others did...without the flour mixed in, I could see how this could end up being a little runny. Wonderful recipe! I will definately make this again!

I added brown sugar to the topping plus many of the other suggestions here and made one delicious pie! The apples I used were a bit dry, so I added about a cup of fresh BLUEBERRIES and tossed them with the apples (plus flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and brown/white sugar). OMG did the blueberries make the pie...I don't think it would have been as good without them (due to the dry apples, not this wonderful recipe!)

I just made this as my first pie ever, and it is absolutely delectable! Since it was my first attempt and I wanted to get it perfect, the preperation was time consuming- but definitely worth it. To reduce the chance of a watery pie, I divided it into three layers of apple, with extra flour and sugar on the bottom and top of every layer. I used red apple for the filling, and lined the crust with green apple, which worked out well, because it ensured that the flavors didn't mix unpleasently. It was cooked at 350 degrees. A perfect tasty pie that goes great with vanilla ice cream!

I made four of these pies during the week of Thanksgiving, and they were all devoured!  My kindergarten students loved them, as did my family.  I mixed the apples, sugar, cinnamon, and a little flour all together before placing in the pie crust.  I baked at 350 for 40 minutes - they were perfect!  Great recipe - and so easy!

This is the best easiest apple pie ever.  Big hit with all my relatives.  I followed others' advice and mixed the apples with 4tbst flour, sugar and cinnamon (and a tsp of nutmeg) prior to pouring them into the pie crust. I used brown sugar for the topping.  It just gave it a nicer color.  I baked the pie at 350F for about 1hr 15min.  Very very good!

This was the first apple pie I ever made. I used a store bought frozen crust and added flour like another reviewer suggested, mixed it all up then put it in the pie crust, I also lowered the oven temp. Took it right out of the oven to my sons class party by the time we ate it, it was just warm yummmm all the kids loved it and they were all 5, many teachers asked for the recipe....love this one it is a keeper.

I mixed the sugar & cinnamon with the apples and added less than 1/4 c. flour to help absorb the juice before putting it in the pie crust. The topping was not only pretty but had a nice crunchy texture to the pie.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Penny!! It's a keeper.

This pie was so easy and delish. I used a store bought pie crust so it only took me a couple of minutes to whip together. I mixed the sugar and cinnamon with the apples in a bowl first - and I have to admit - I threw a little brown sugar in there. Next time I will cover the crust for a little while so it doesn't get too dark before the apples are done. But it tasted so good and was so easy!

Awesome awesome awesome! I made this for my mom's birthday, and it was a huge hit. The streusel topping was amazing and made it different from a conventional apple pie. Definately worth making.

This is absolutely divine!  I don't even like apples that much and I'm not crazy about pie either.  I made it for my family and I ended up eating most of it.  I recommend using a shallow pie pan.  When I used a deep dish, it had too much liquid.

This is a SPECTACULAR pie! I passed cooking in school a while back, but all the cooking was done with peers. I could make this pie all by myself. As of right now, it's been in the oven for 17 minutes and even with my stuffy nose I can smell it =). This recipe is a keeper!

I found this recipe on this site 1/2 hour before my finicky in-laws arrived for dinner.  This is only the second time I've had them over since they complain about EVERYTHING!  They absolutley loved this, and my husband says it's the best dessert I ever made.  I used a combo of apples Gala, Mac and Ambrosia, (we live in an orchard based city so we have all types) It was a perfect blend of very different apple tastes. Maybe a bit too much butter though. Thanks Penny you saved the day!

This pie was so easy to make and very delicious! The topping was very good. I made 4 of them and gave some to family. The kids had a good time helping and didn't make too much of a mess!

It was very easy to make, though my pie turned out watery, too. Maybe because I cheated and used a frozen pie crust. I also would peel the apples in the future because I found the peels  too chewy for my taste. Can't beat the easiness factor, though.

Wonderful flavor, I was surprised that the topping was so good.  It was great with ice cream.  However, the apples turned out a little crunchier than I like.  Will probably still make it again.

This was my first pie and it came out great!! The only thing that took long was the peeling and cutting of the apples, other than that this was really quick and easy.  Highly recommend for holidays.
