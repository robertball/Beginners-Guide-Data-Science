These cookies were GREAT.  I did make a few alterations though - added 1 tsp of cinnamon and decreased the baking time to 10 mins.  They remain soft and the cinnamon gives it a little extra umph!

These were delicious, however I made a few changes.  First, I used 1/4 C MILK instead of 1/4 C water.  Then I added 1/2 tsp salt with the dry ingredients.  I also increased the flour to 1 1/2 C because I live at a high altitute (7200 ft).  The dough was delicious!  I cooked them on my baking stone for 11 minutes and they came out perfect.

I had to eat my way through a lot of oatmeal cookie recipes before I finally found this one. These taste bud tantilizers are reminescent of the cookies sold in my high school cafeteria back in 1959...at a penny each.  On the first day: crunchy while still chewy. Second day: if any remain, softer with big flavor. Substitute vanilla extract for the almond.

I love these cookies! If you like a thick chewy cookie though, these are not for you. These ones are kind of airier and crispier, but still soft, which is what I like. And they aren't overly sugary like some others I have had. I didn't have any almond extract though, so I used vanilla and I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Yum yum yum! Thanks for the great recipe.

3 and a 1/2 stars as it was quite tasty - we even skipped the cooling part in the fridge and they turned out nicely dense and chewy though the almond was a bit over powering so next time its a dash not a 1/2!  added raisins and flax seeds for fun and it was very tasty:)

Holy Heck these are good! I split the 2/3c butter between crisco and real butter..used vanilla instead of almond extract..added dried cranberries soaked in burgunday wine and finely chopped almonds....and WOW....yum! I found that if you cook them closer to the heat, they spread out and make a cripsier cookie....put the dough in the fridge first, and cook towards the top of the oven for a thicker cookie that holds its shape well. Both are fabulous!

These were OUTSTANDING!  The only changes I made: I used vanilla extract instead of the almond extract and added about 1 1/2 cups of soft raisins.  I used Kerrygold Irish butter...the cookies were demolished!!!

These were easy and very nice, as the almond extract is perfect. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce to reduce oil and it worked out well. I didnt feel a need to add raisins or anything else as the almond extract is enough.

Fabulous!  I made some necessary alterations due to the lack of processed food in Africa.  Instead of brown sugar, I used wild honey from Kabala.  I used whole wheat flour, and added craisins and walnuts.  I baked them on my stone.  Everyone LOVES them, and we're calling them my Kabala cookies.

I was looking for a new recipe for cookies to send my soldier and his buddies...These taste great! I did replace the water with milk, just for extra flavor. I can't wait to send them in his care package! I know he and his buddies will love them :)

I thought I had found the perfect Oatmeal cookie recipe because of the photo shown with it.  I was so disappointed.  My cookies came out looking nothing like them.  They were thin and fell apart.  The taste was too sweet for us and the almond extract was overpowering.  If you like sweet, you can cut back on the almond extract.

Great Recipe! Like suggested by another person, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also reduced the baking time to 10 min as I wanted soft instead of crunchy.
A keeper!

Yummy yummy yummy, these cookies are great. We added chocolate chips, and everybody loved them. Left them eight minutes in a convection oven with the fan running, for a nice moist chewy cookie.

Makes a good crisp cookie.  I made mine with milk instead of water.  I iced some of them with.a simple powder sugar glaze and they were even better.

These were really good. I substituted vanilla extract but will try with the almond next time. I added raisins for hubby and walnuts for me and we were both happy. Be careful not to make them too big - they really spread out - but maybe because I didn't bother to refrigerate the dough.

My nine-year-old made these cookies, and they are delicious! We didn't have almond extract, and so substituted vanilla, plus added some cinnamon. When she scooped the dough she packed it in, and I think that helped the cookies hold together well, instead of turning out crumbly as someone else mentioned. Very good recipe!

I thought these cookies were great. I had to add 2-3 tbsp of water to the finished batter, before refrigerating. Also I decreased the baking time to ten minutes; that left them nice and chewy. Delicious!

These were delicious, I didn't cook them for quite as long as it said to, so they were really soft when done. Then Left them on the cookie sheet a couple of minutes and froze them. That way they are ready when company comes over unexpected.

this recipe is great with cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, peanuts, almonds, cashews, pecans, cashews, walnuts, chocolate chunks, raisins, and craisins.  Use an ice cream scoop and get large cookies with a crispy exterior and chewy inside.  Don't forget a glass of milk or you'll hate yourself.(;>)

I made it exactly like the recipe, chilling the dough overnight. The taste of the cookies is fine, but I thought they turned out very flat.

I did make some changes. I added 2tbs. Of peanut creamy butter, 1 tbs each of vanilla extract, cinnamon and a 1/2 tbs of vegetable oil. Didn't have any Brown sugar so I finished with all white sugar.  Will bake for 10 minutes.

Perfect easy bake on a rainy Sunday. I think the almond was a smidge overpowering. So maybe less next time around, or maybe vanilla instead? we'll see.

I followed exactly the recipe and it turned out great. I put the dough in the fridge overnight. They were chewy and yummy! I added walnuts and chocolate chips.

I agree though with another review that there is too much almond extract. Use 1/2 teaspoon is plenty. I added choco chips and walnuts instead of the 3rd cup of oatmeal. They turned out great!!

Fell apart easily, but had great taste. I added cinnamon for a little extra something!

I like these cookies... although I added 1 tbsp cocoa powder, scrapped the almond extract and added vanilla extract instead! The recipe was nice and easy to follow, and they look exactly as pictured.
