OH MY GOD, this was amazing.  I didn't follow the recipe though, this is what I added/did:  1-scraped the eggplant and put the shells in the oven at 350.  2-chopped up half of a very large onion, added a can of mushrooms, and some minced garlic...threw all that into the pan and sprayed with Mazola olive oil spray.  I sauteed all that until it was nice and soft, spraying occasionally with the spray.  Then I added a little of 1/2 pound of sweet italian sausage.  Once that was cooked, I added the eggplant.  Cook a while.  Added generous amount of parsley and a splash of white wine.  3-Added a can of basil, oregano, and garlic diced tomatoes.  4-added less than 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs, plus parmesan and mozzarella cheese.  Filled the shells and popped in the oven.  In the last ten minutes of baking, I sprinkld the top with more mozzarella cheese and breadcrumbs.  DELICIOUS!

I made quite a few changes to this recipe, but kept the original spirit of it.  I omitted the olive oil completely in order to reduce the fat and calories.  It was not missed at all.  I used olive oil cooking spray instead.  I added 1 cup of chopped onion, 4 oz. of white mushrooms, and used half a cup of bread crumbs instead of 2 cups. I also used 7 cloves of garlic and only 1/3 cup of cheese.  The next time I try this recipe, I will omit the breadcrumbs entirely and see how it comes out. 

I will definitely make this again.

Looking at this recipe, I thought it was a really good basis for a stuffed eggplant.  I did however change a lot--I used Hot Italian Turkey Sausage (2) and cooked it in about 5 tbsp garlic (since I love garlic).  I only used about 1.5 tbsp of olive oil total (I didn't understand why they would originally use that much!)  When I added the chopped eggplant, I also add very fine chopped mushrooms (~1.5 cups), and diced sweet onion (half an onion).  I didn't have any wine on hand so I put in just a tiny bit of water, but found that with all those veggies in the pot, there was plenty of liquid.  I pretty much kept the spices the same, but threw in a bunch of my favorites (I randomly grabbed stuff).  I also added about 3/4 cup grated sharp white chedder cheese instead, and only added about a cup or so of bread crumbs (enough were there was no liquid and the mixture was smooth--I am not a fan of a lot of bready mixtures).  I stuffed the eggplants, and baked them for just under 30 min.  I thought they were great, huge portions (I've had left overs for a few days), and are great with a green salad or as an appetizer.  One thing I will do next time is add more onion, and reserve some of the stuffing mixture and possibly make patties or something with it so there isn't so much stuffing in the eggplants themselves.

Good Lord..if I made so many changes I would post as my own recipe!!  so disrespectful to the original posterâ€¦if you have totally modified the recipe then its no longer the owners.  Either like or not!  Don't dazzle us with your modifications..we all make them..cooking is an individual sport.

This was very good with the changes that I added when making.  I used chicken Italian sausage (very good), after scooping out the eggplant shells, I seasoned with some Italian seasoning and olive oil.  I only used 2 tblsp of oil total.  You do not need all that was given.  I always spray with olive oil spray.  I also did not use as much breadcrumbs as stated.  Only enough to hold together.  I also added some celery, onion and red bell pepper.  My eggplant shells were very soft, not hard as other stated as I zapped in microwave for about 2 minutes before filling. My husband and I both loved this and I will make again for sure

Just amazing.  Added about five white mushrooms, sliced, and they added an extra dimension.  I realized I had used all our bread crumbs making eggplant parmesan last night (yes i love eggplant), so left them out of this recipe...they were not missed.  Don't think I'll add them next time.  Doubled the recipe to two eggplants, had plenty of stuffing with only one pound of sausage and no bread crumbs.  My husband is wary of eggplant and went back for seconds.  Will make again!!!

This was so good! To easily scoop out the eggplant, I used a melon baller. I used ground pork sausage (mild), since that's what I had on hand. I also reduced the bread crumbs to 1/2 c. and used apple cider instead of the wine. Then I topped it off with mozzarella cheese. Delicious!

Didn't stuff it in an eggplant--just tossed it in a 9x9 to cook.  Added a little mozzarella cheese and baked.  All 4 kids ate it (even after hearing the word eggplant)  :)

Great recipe but too dry - reduce the breadcrumbs so you won't have to "add more olive oil if mixture is dry".  Try recipe with 75% of what is suggested.
I added a pinch of crushed red pepper also and it enhanced the garlic/parsley combination.

Great recipe for something different with eggplant.  I used half sweet sausage and half hot and reduced the amount of breadcrumbs by half.  Definitely will try again.

As previously stated, I too felt this recipe was an excellent basis for stuffed eggplant, especially since my only other experiences with it have been making eggplant lasagna, parm & roasted veggie stacks. Needless to say, when my husband asked me if I could make 'something like a twice-baked potato, but with eggplant?' I was stumped however, this recipe gave me a good starting point while allowing both flexibility and creativity. The changes I made were:  1) I used equal amounts of ground beef & chorizo.  2) I doubled the garlic & sautÃ©ed it in Greek Olive Oil along with a diced, medium-sized onion, parsley & a few shakes of garlic salt.  I then added the cubed eggplant (like another user wrote, don't make the cubes too small, otherwise they break down & it becomes mushy & if it gets mushy, the awesomness of the eggplant is gone & it feels more like you're eating zucchini, which is still good, but when I want eggplant, I want eggplant, not zucchini.)  Moving on, 3) I used no white wine nor did I add any additional olive oil, but instead, added some homemade spaghetti sauce & just enough breadcrumbs to "thicken up" the mix as I wasn't looking for 'runny' here.  4) I then stuffed the eggplant shells (which I had already brushed lightly with a mix of olive oil & a little garlic salt & roasted at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes) then sprinkled on grated Romano cheese before returning them to the oven for 10 minutes. I also suggest letting them sit for 5 minutes prior to serving.

I followed the other reviewers advice and only added 1/2 cup of homemade breadcrumbs.  I added onions and more garlic.  Next time I will probably serve with marinara sauce and sub mozzerella for parmesean as I like gooey cheese more.  Still very very YUMMY.

Ew!  I thought this was pretty awful.  It took a long time to prepare- scraping the shells, cooking the filling and finally baking the whole thing.  I poured all the breadcrumbs in at once- big mistake!  The mixture turned into a glue-y mess and the final result baked hard and tasted only like the breadcrumbs.  I hated to keep pouring more and more oil into the mixture- just keeps adding fat and calories.  In the end, I threw the eggplant- AND the recipe- in the trash.  Sorry!

Really good recipe.  I modified a little.  This is a dry household, so no wine here ever.  I used chicken broth instead.  I also added 1/2 cup of ricotta cheese, mainly because it needed to be used.  Glad I did, as it gave the stuffing a smooth, cheesy flavor.  I also reduced the amount of crumbs to 1 cup.  Really delicious, this recipe is a keeper.

this was good - I eliminated the wine simply because I don't care to for it  -- I would recommend adding an egg to the mixture when adding in the bread crums & cheese.. Otherwise I did not find it to stick together that good.

We have started to have this dish once a week. We are counting calories, so I basically just used the basis of this recipe and made my own: ground turkey, parsley, italian seasoning (no bread crumbs, never miss 'em), chopped onion, and cooking spray instead of olive oil. It was like a stuffed pepper using an eggplant. The second time I added some canned tomatoes on top too. Delicious!

A W E S O M E!  I did a version of this tonight with great success.  The man drooled over his succulent portions of egg-planty goodness.  My version?  Never thought you'd ask:

Popped open three ostrich sausages, didn't use the breadcrumbs or the oil, except to brush on the shells.  Topped those bad boys off with well-drained savoury canned tomatoes and cooked for 40 minutes.  Tender, tasty, healthy.  A++++ Will trade again.

Thought this recipe was incredible, I have never made stuffed eggplant before, and was a little worried as to my husband expectations, since he grew up on homemade sicilian cooking.  We did use Hot Italian Sausage instead of sweet and a lot more garlic.  I think it was incredible. Do agree with another person that I would cook my shells in the oven while the stuffing cooked to make them not so tuff. I know I will be cooking this again in the near future.  In my house it was a winner!!!!

I love eggplant, but this was not one of my favourites. It has a lot of potential....I would almost completely omitt the bread crumbs as it was far too dry, which caused me to add way more oil, and more calories....suggest just not putting in any bread crumbs and it should be great...also use spicy sausage for more flavour!

After reading all the reviews I decided to try the recipe as it was  submitted.  The star rating is based on the original recipe. It was pretty good, but like others I found 1/2 C olive oil was not necessary , and we thought it was a bit bland...so, next time I made it I only used olive oil spray.  I also doubled the garlic, added 1 small chopped onion and instead  of bread crumbs I used 1 cup of cooked brown rice.  With these few changes it was more to our liking.  It was a very good basic recipe though.  Thanks Elaina.

Delicious! Only changes I made were due to the reviews. I used 1 cup bread crumbs instead of 2 and used an extra 1/4 cup white wine, which I put in the bottom of the pan to steam it all.  Next time would change the 1 cup of bread crumbs to some coarsely chopped toasted bread with Italian seasonings, as think the bread crumbs make it a bit soggy with a slight mealy texture.  Needed just a bit more 'body' to make it perfect.  Think the chopped toasted bread would 'do the trick'.

This recipe calls for way too much bread crumbs,olive oil isn't necessary for sauteing sausage and this was too dry most likely on account of the amount of bread crumbs.My family and I love Eggplant Parm but this just didn't taste right,none of us enjoyed it.

I was looking for something other than eggplant parmesan to make with eggplant.  Not really impressed with this recipe. It was dry and not very tasty... Probably won't be making this recipe again...

The stuffing was great. I didn't use as much breadcrumb. However, the eggplant was kind of tough. I may take some other cooks' suggestions and try to micro it first next time. I will make this again, but with some revisions.

Actually had to throw it out.  Did not use olive oil to cook the meat as there was plenty of fat already.  Should have REALLY drained the fat off.  Perhaps I scooped the shells too thin as they collapsed while baking. Added only 1/4 to 1/2c. breadcrumbs to meat mixture and used only abourt 1/3c crumbs & 1/3c cheese on top.  the cheese did not melt at all - just sorta toasted.  All in all it was pretty disgusting. I love eggplant and have stuffed a few but this one....    nope, never again!

four stars but with some changes it's a five.  other reviewer's tips helped me.  i did not need any oil at all.  the greaswe from the sausage (i used bulk) was sufficient to brown everything.  i used less bread crumbs than called for.  i only used mozzarella cheese and was generous with it.  tasted like a fabulously rich eggplant parmesan.  i added chopped and sundried tomatoes to the saute mix. i laid out the scooped out eggplant and just piled on the entire heaping ingredients.  make sure to brown the sausage.  it's better that way.  everyone loved it.

excellent recipe!  I didn't follow it very closely but it still came out beautifully.  I mixed shredded mozzerella in with the mixture and also sprinkled some on top, I didn't use wine or grated cheese, and I used hot sausage instead of sweet.  I served it with homemade spaghetti sauce on top.  Wonderful recipe, my husband loved it!

I used turkey sausage (Italian style, pre-seasoned), and 1/2 Tbl of oil to cut down on the fat.  Wasn't missed!  I covered it with foil for the first 15 minutes.  Wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent Dish. I read through the reviews and made a few alterations as per previous reviews. In addition to the mushrooms, I used only 1/3 cup of bread crumbs as well as the cheese.  I used ground pork and added chili paste and some Italian seasoning instead of the sausage. And finally i used about a 1/4 cup of fresh orange juice instead of wine. Everyone loved including my kids who apparently hate eggplant. Will definitely make this again!

This was delicious, but you definitely have to "eyeball" the breadcrumbs. I added a shallot, a clove of garlic and mushrooms to the sausage-eggplant mixture, and it came out superb!

Should have read the reviews before I tried the recipe.  The taste is very good.  However, too much grease and too many crumbs.  Next time, I will use some mozzerella and top with spaghetti sauce.  Also would not chop the eggplant very much..leave bigger chunks.  Good recipe and with a little tweaking would be great.

I was so excited to make this recipe. What a letdown! It is mushy, greasy, and a complete let down. I even followed the suggestions and put in mushrooms. I am not a person who is always concerned with calories but this is ridiculous. This is recipe is way too greasy and not worth the calories! Save your time and make something else.

Ever since an old Italian guy here in town told me about eating his momma's Italian sausage-stuffed eggplant, I've wanted to try it.  He couldn't remember how she made it, though, so I was very pleased to see this recipe come through my RSS feed.  My suggestions:  we used spicy sausage - next time I'll use sweet like the recipe said.  Be sure and chop the sausage up into small pieces.  Judge the amount of sausage you need to your eggplant.  We had more sausage than eggplant and I think it would be better if the mixture was half and half. Next time I'll cook the shells in the oven while I'm preparing the stuffing as the shells were too tough.  All in all, this was an excellent recipe - Thanks Elaina!

Great recipe, even for my fiancee who is not the biggest vegetable eater. I use more cheese, less bread crumbs and add more olive oil over the top of it while its cooking. Doesn't come out as dry then. It tastes even better reheated the next day.

This recipe came out very good.  I also chose to chop up some mushrooms and add them to the stuffing.  It was SOOOOOO filling but very tastey.  I used a 1/2 cup more of cheese becuase my girl loves cheese.

To the person who said it's disrespectful to make changes: I dosagree... I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand and recipes are not meant to be followed step by step anyway. That's why cooking is an ART. Here are my additions like it or not: Used ground venison, a TON of olive oil, panko breadcrumbs, broccoli bits, and pesto.

I enjoyed this quite a bit, it was very filling,  but there was almost too much stuffing. I added olive oil at the end, due to it being on the dry side, but i think I would have had to add a lot more. The only reason I can think of that made it dry was that I used sweet Italian turkey sausage instead of pork. Next time I'lltry with pork and add some mmushrooms.

I ommitted the eggplant shells and just cooked the meat and the chopped eggplant, diced onions, garlic, salt, pepper, and cilantro in one pan. I then put it over spinach leaves. It was delicious! I rated it a three because the stuffing didn't work.

My husband and I both love this. I did like a lot of other people, and cut the bread crumbs in half. It came out perfect. I will be making this often.

This recipe needs some serious adjustments for my taste.  If I ever make this again, I'll half the amount of bread crumbs, or leave them out all together.  I found it too pasty in texture.

Fantastic recipe. I didn't have wine in the house so I used 1/2 c. apple cider, only put in 1 c. Italian bread crumbs, and sauteed mushrooms with the sausage.  Definitely will make this again.  Its a favorite !!!!!

This recipe was very good.  I used less parm cheese than suggested, and next time I will use less breadcrumbs.

Omg. This was good .  I did add mushrooms but otherwise followed the recipe. I will be making this again. This recipe can be moderated and be delicious in many ways.  I may get more creative next time.  A must try.

I really enjoyed building off this recipe. I had bacon, but I think it would turn out better with ground sausage or beef.

I made this for my wife and me, but we werent crazy about the eggplant.  I made it again using zucchini instead, and it was very good.  I also grilled it instead of baking it in the oven.

Tasteless and very dry; even after adding huge amounts of olive oil as suggested. Actually only used 1-1/2 cups of bread crumbs v/s 2 suggested; just seemed like too much.

I love this recipe and use it often.  I only use about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, for me that's plenty.  I also substitute the sausage with ground turkey for a healthier version, works great as well.

This was fabulous!!! I changed it up a bit by adding sautÃ©ed mushrooms, onions & a can of Italian style diced tomatoes. I also used Italian Panko instead of bread crumbs & added mozzarella cheese. I substituted the parsley with Italian parsley. Topped it with some marinara sauce, too. After baking for 35 minutes, I added some more cheese & a little fresh chopped basil and finished it for 5 more min in the oven. ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!! This may be my new favorite recipe. I had some leftover stuffing that I used to make a pattie with by adding a little more Panko for my 7 yr. old. Topped it like the shells & baked on the same pan. He loved it too!!

My daughter and my husband loved it!  Next time, I will cut down on the olive oil and the breadcrumbs. I will also use freshly grated Parmesan instead of the canned kind (which I had on hand).  I think I'll also add some saluted onion since we all love cooked ionion in our dishes.  I may need to add some seasonings since I will cut back on the Italian breadcrumbs.  I could really use some advice on how to cut the eggplant meat out of the shell efficiently.  I did it, but it wasn't pretty!

Very good. Reminded me of stuffed mushrooms. I made a lot of changes: started with 2 med. sized eggplants, added one small onion, ground beef instead of sausage, less oil and 1/2 bread crumbs. I also used red wine instead of the white. I served it with couscous. Next time, I will try goat cheese instead of parmesan.
