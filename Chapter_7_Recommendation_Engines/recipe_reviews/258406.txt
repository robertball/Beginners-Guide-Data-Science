Mmmmm . . . these are delicious! This was my first time making empanhadas, and I loved these! The package of empanada wrappers that I bought only had 10 wrappers, so I scaled this down to 10 servings, but used the entire can of hash and 3 eggs, and kept all of the remaining ingredients as scaled. I made these early in the day, and they re-heat well in the microwave (only taking about 15 seconds to re-heat from room temp). Serve them with a side of salsa for a delicious breakfast treat.

Absolutely delicious!  I ate way too many of these in one meal.  Don't forget to work quickly as the empanada dough can get a little sticky if it warms too much.  Also, next time I might try adding a small bit of diced jalapeno and some chopped green olives, for personal preference.  But really, these are good as is!
