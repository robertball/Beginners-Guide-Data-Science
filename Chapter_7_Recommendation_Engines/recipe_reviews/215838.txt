Although it was good. I think it was a lot of sausage. Next time I think I'll substitute half with chicken or something. Otherwise very fast easy recipe and the kids/picky boyfriends don't even notice the onions.

So ironic to find this recipe on here - I make this all the time and my husband raves for days about it. i actually use Classico brand sauce too - the light alfredo - tastes just as good as the regular. I also use Jimmy Dean brand sausage roll - the "hot" variety. I make a homemade crust, brush it with melted butter and minced garlic, and then prebake it. Then I add all the ingredients and just bake til the cheese melts. I've found this prevents the crust from getting soggy. Definitely give this one a try!

I used up some of my leftovers on this pizza. I used cooked chicken instead of sausage, a little pesto, mixed in with the alfredo sauce, the leftover thawed spinach & chopped up the last few spears of asparagus and threw that on too.  Yummy and healthy too!  Thanks!

Great recipe! Even my picky fiance ate it all up! I did cook some green onion and fresh minced garlic with the sausage for added flavor, and added some italian seasoning and a little cayan pepper to the sausage and alfredo mixture! I also made a melted butter/olive oil/garlic salt/ italian seasoning mixture that I brushed onto the crust before baking. It was awesome!
