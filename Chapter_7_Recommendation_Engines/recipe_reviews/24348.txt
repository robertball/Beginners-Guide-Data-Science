This is quite yummy.  I used Granny Smith apples and probably 6 peaches.  I also added 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of water.  I peeled the apples and the peaches as well.  I love homemade applesauce and fresh peaches, so this is a winner with me!

This was a good recipes--I like anything I can make in my crockpot, vs standing over the stove all day.  I added a tiny bit of brown sugar (about 2-4 T) and some apple cider--then cooked it a little longer with the lid off, to cook off the liquid.  I also splashed in some vanilla at the end.  Maybe I was spoiled by a recent batch of apple butter, looking for a more intense flavor, but it seemed like it needed a little punch--but, I think, even without the additions it makes a nice, basic fruit sauce.

Although I added maybe a quarter cup of the splenda brown sugar - I didn't do anything else to this yummy recipe.  I started with fresh  - very aromatic Texas peaches and my goodness this is so good.  It could be done on the stove top too if you have something else going in the crock-pot.

i loved this. i used very little cinnamon because of other reviews. it was very good, also i think this might be ideal baby-food.  i was worried at the beginning, because there was no liquid, but after a few hours there was a lot, it came out of the fruit, so i'm happy i didn't add any!

I would have peeled the apples and changed the ratio of spice to fruit.  I did can this in a hot water bath.  3 bags of apples made 3.5 quarts of sauce.

This is easy to make and tastes nice. Unfortunately the cinnamon overrides the peach flavour. Having the cinnamon in there resembles plain old apple sauce too much. I was hoping to taste more peaches than I can. I even added extra fruit, but to no avail.

I agree with some other reviewers and also think it had to do with the cinnamon but tasted like regular applesauce to me, I'll try recipe one more time completely  omitting the cinnamon maybe then I will taste the peach.

This was really crazy easy. I used all organic everything. I did start out with one teaspoon cinnamon and really, that was plenty. I also added 1/2 cup of organic apple juice. My son just had his tonsils out and I'll tell you, he's eaten his weight in this in the last 24 hours. I'm going to have to make another batch soon! I really loved how easy this was. I used to pay a TON for organic applesauce. Not anymore! NOTE: I'd like to try this with homemade apple pie spice next time and see if that's even better.

I used Granny Smith apples and a few pears!  Came out great.  I also added a handfull of dried cranberries at the last 20 min or so and they came out nice and plump.  Going to the store to get more apples and pears to make again.

More like apple butter than applesauce, but very tasty.  As others mentioned, I reduced the cinnamon to a teaspoon. I also used 6 apricots in place of the peaches. Lastly, I peeled the apples. Thanks for sharing!

I made this as is and then tasted it. It needed something more so I added a little bit of sugar. It was better.

This was very nice, but basically just as a solid applesauce - I could barely taste the peaches, even though they were perfectly ripe and fragrant. I also tried making it with strawberries I froze after picking, which we preferred. I used the same method listed here, just with a cup or so of frozen strawberries added instead of the peaches.

used pink lady apples. Had to halve the cinnamon and add Apple juice and sugar. Was still pretty tart. Would have been better if the apples were peeled.
Edit: originally posted after trying warm on ice cream. Better cold as a traditional Apple sauce.

Excellent. I peeled the apples and omitted the cinnamon. I also used caned peaches. It was plenty sweet enough and could taste the peach fine.
