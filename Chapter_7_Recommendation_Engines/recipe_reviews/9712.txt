I am not an intuitive cook, so follow new recipes exactly.  We like the rich molasses taste, that's why I made molasses cookies.  The only thing missing was the cook time - I settled on 11 minutes.  We noticed a mellowing of flavor, and sweetness, on the second day.  I cooked one batch on a greased cookie sheet, one on a cookie sheet lined with parchment - the parchment yielded soft puffy cookies, the others spread out thin.

Loved it!  Tastes a lot like a big chewy ginger snap.  Some tips: for best results, don't overcook; cooks like a dream on Silpat baking sheets (well worth the investment) or a well-greased cookie sheet; they MUST cool for 5 minutes on the sheet--don't rush this!  I highly recommend this recipe!!!

I just made a batch of these wonderful cookies.  I could not believe how easy it was and how great the cookies tasted.  I mixed everything together in one bowl - they are a little sticky though.  I only had to bake mine for 8 minutes.  Be sure to let them cool for at least 5 minutes on the cookie sheet.

I can't wait to make another batch!!!

I used half whole wheat flour, half white flour, threw in a cup of raisins, and some extra ginger, plus a little bit of vanilla extract and underbaked them slightly with superb results- they were deliciously crisp on the edges and satisfyingly chewy towards the middle- a bit too sweet overall, perhaps next time I will try to cut the brown sugar by 1/4 cup and substitute a bit of flour and honey, or perhaps try it with applesauce...

I used 1/2 tablespoon fresh (well, frozen fresh then dethawed) minced ginger root and mixed that right in the wet mixutre, cut the brown sugar by 1/4 c as some others recomended, increased the  flour to 2.5 c (subbing 1 c whole wheat flour), guessed at less than the recipe calls for in salt, used a glass baking pan greased with olive oil and used only one bowl! These are great! I undercooked the first batch because they were too big, but you know what? They were still good! I rolled one of the first batch up and dipped it in milk, it was like some kind of heavenly candy bar! I may experiment with the cooking times on this recipe to see what I like best, and I encourage you to do so as well. Also only use a full half tablespoon of ginger root if you are a big fan of ginger, my husband still likes them but he said he'd use less ginger. I can't wait to serve some to my maritimer father-in-law tommorrow, as he is a fan of molasses cookies and these are similar to the bakery recipe he likes so much. ADDED LATER: Oh my goodness! Definately use parchment paper to cook them! Easier to clean up and bakes them up so much lighter and fluffy. Still have the crunchy edges with the chewy middles. I deifinately give this recipe 6 stars with the parchment paper!

I was very skeptical when I read this recipe, and I decided to use up the little bit of molasses I had and give it a try.  Molasses cookies are my husbands favorite!  These are AWESOME! Simple, easy and very tasteful.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  A new favorite for us!

This recipe was simple to make.  I made it all in one bowl and didn't even have to use a mixer.  I was worried about it being too strong after I read the reviews, so I used 1/4 cup of honey and 3/4 cup of molasses.  I also rolled the dough into balls and rolled it in sugar.  They turned out great!!!!

Sticky? Yes. Very strong molasses flavor? Yes. Lacking 'oomph'? Yes.  I found these cookies uninspiring and would never make them for guests. I felt as though I was eating spoonfuls of molasses. Even though I'm a health-conscious eater, I'd rather walk off the butter calories from a good cookie than eat these.

If you do decide to make these, I'd suggest an extra dash of salt and a 1/4 tsp. ground cloves.

Very good cookie but a bit on the sweet side.  I've had good results with lowering the amount of sugar.

These cookies are very soft and a bit sticky. They taste great and are very easy to make. The one bit of advise I would give though is to make sure your cookie sheet is well greased. Since they don't have any butter in them they have a tendancy to stick. I baked them for 15 minutes although oven temperatures may change.

Great cookies! But I'd like to share a bit of advice for those beginners among us: there's no time specified for cooking time, just until the cookies 'turn brown'. I'm glad I made a full batch of dough because my first try came out very flat and very crispy! So the second round I started watching the cookies at 4 minutes (which was pretty cool, I could see the dough bubble up then collapse in on itself. Yes, I am a nerd), and by 5 or 6 minutes I could tell  they were done! Especially since they have to sit 5 minutes on the hot pan afterwards. But they turn out great this way! I'd recommend watching carefully the first couple of batches to see what amount of time works best for your oven, but for me it was 6 minutes, tops. Delicious cookies!!

This is a great low/no fat cookie!  I did like others suggested and rolled the dough in sugar then flattened slightly on the cookie sheet before baking for about 8 minutes.  I found the ginger a little too strong (my kids said 'way too spicy!), so next time I will use less ginger and maybe experiment with other spices, such as a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  Overall, they stay moist for a good week and they do mellow in flavor after the first day.  Don't judge them on the first day flavor!

This recipe is tricky. I own a local cookie company and was looking for something new. Stumbled on this...be careful! First time I made this I was not pleased, but wanted to try again. Add baking powder and save your cookies. About a teaspoon along with the soda. If you don't you will end up with a VERY FLAT cookie. Candy-like. Also USE CIDER VINEGAR! Good luck! My cookies have varied from batch to batch.

These cookies were ok but were neither the taste nor the texture I was looking for.  As a Canadian, from Nova Scotia, I think you should rename these PEI Molasses cookies!

Ya they tasted extreamly like moleasses but they had no life to them & were VERY unattractive, pulling them apart was almost impossible... I cannot believe that Canada's name is on them....

I'm a Canadian living in Sweden where I can't get molasses - I've really been missing it.  Recently a friend sent me some though, so I tried these cookies...sooo good, soft and chewy with lots of molasses flavour, and couldn't be easier.  Only make if you really like molasses though - my Swedish boyfriend didn't like them at all!

Very easy recipe to make and low fat.  However I think you have to *really* like molasses to make these.  Very strong molasses flavour...

i changed it a little. i had only 1/2 cup brown sugar so that's what i used and it was perfect. i used part whole wheat flour and added 2 T ground flaxseed so mine weren't totally fat free. i made them big. heaping tablespoons and 15 minutes was perfect for baking time. flavor is excellent and they make great ice cream sandwiches.

Absolutely delicious!  Thanks to reading the reviews, I used 3/4 c molasses, 1/4 cup honey and greased the sheets well.  I also sprinkled the tops with granulated sugar before baking.  Turned out wonderful - a new favorite!

I have been looking for an old fashioned Molasses cookie recipe for a long time now.  This is IT!! The best molasses cookie ever.  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and baked on parchment and I ended up baking for 14 minutes...these cookies will not last long in my home!

Very easy to make.  A moist cookie with a nice texture.  Strong molasses flavor, which I like, but could be overwhelming if you're not expecting it.  Nice treat on a cold night.

These cookies were all right. I added fresh grated ginger and liked the taste. Other than that, I found that my cookies spread out to be thin and really chewy even though I baked them on parchment paper.

This is suprisingly good!  I added in the extra baking powder and baked about 8 minutes.  They turned out flat, but soft inside with a crunchy top that is actually pretty fabulous.  A little sweet, yes, a lttle sticky, yes but not overly so, and the flavour was great.  As a Canadian I'm proud to have this recipe in my book!  Thanks so much!

Sticky but really good.  I rolled mine to get nice flat shapes.  They were appreciated by all and will make again.  Only other change was I like lots of ginger so I at least doubled that.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my cookies turned out pretty much the opposite of "too sweet," as other reviewers said they were. These had a VERY strong molasses taste -- definitely needed to be buried under some vanilla ice cream or something (too bad I don't have any!).

These cookies are pretty good, but for best results let them sit for at least 1 hour before you serve them. Right out of the oven they don't taste so hot. DEFINATLY go get some parchment paper to put on your cookie sheets, 'cos these are sticky.

A good molasses tasting cookie....crispy outside, chewy inside. I added in about a cup of raisins. Took about 12 minutes to bake. I would not recommend baking them on waxed paper like somebody commented unles syou want your whole kitchen filled with smoke from the wax melting off. Parchment paper woiuld be a much better choice....too bad I didn't have any.

This is my go-to cookie recipe;however,  I never follow a recipe exactly.  So,  to this one,  I add additional flour until the point the dough is super sticky and not very wet at all. It makes the cookies crackle just right and creates the perfect chewiness.  I also melt white chocolate and coat the underside of the cookies.  The sweetness of the white chocolate is just what these need and the other dries to a hard chocolatey texture that combines well with the chewy cookie!  With those tweaks,  these cookies get raving reviews even from people that claim to dislike molasses cookies!

These cookies turned out really well. Nice and moist and chewy with a distinct molasses flavour. Would have given it five stars but non of the kids would eat it. Found out (through this recipe) that they're not great fans of the molasses flavour.

These are delicious, if you like a strong molasses taste.  I did add more like 2 1/2 cups of flour, the dough was very sticky.  Refrigerating it might help with that.

These were really great!  Super chewy!  I used real ginger and they are quite spicy but so yummy.  They're just like Gramdma Molases candies you get at Halloween here in Quebec.  The same brand makes a cookie as well.  These ones were WAY better than the packaged ones!

I found this recipe when I was looking for a cookie that didn't need butter. I love gingerbread so I decided to try it. I like them! Not sure why mine aren't sticky like so many others said. Mine came out soft and chewy and tasted pretty good, albeit a bit too strong of a ginger flavor. Hoping next-day-flavor will be more mellow like others say! Would definitely be great with a bowl of ice cream!

These are pretty good,a lot better than I thought they'd be.I'll make these again but next time I'll use ginger root,thanks Melissa for the idea.And thanks to Manny for the recipe.As for some of the comments about these being sticky....I just greased my cookie sheet with margarine and the cookies came off with no problem.Parchment would work but why bother if they're not sticking.

I love these cookies as they have no butter Yay!! I was skeptical that these would turn out as I used brown sugar splenda but they turned out awesome. I will warn you to not overbake these. I pulled mine out as soon as they were just starting to look cooked they appeared they may need to cook longer but I let them cool on the cookie sheet and they were chewy and moist. Next time I'm going to try candied ginger and will dip them in melted chocolate.

Ok, if I were to rate these things as cookies, they would only be getting one star. These do not even remotely resemble a molasses cookie, the texture is all wrong. If, however I were to rate them as a molasses-y caramelized sugar confection to be used as a garnish, these are alright. They have a nice molasses and ginger flavor. They are crispy (like burnt sugar) on the edges and the middles resemble a nougat texture. Again, in my opinion these are NOT cookies, but would serve fairly well as an ice cream garnish.

These are soooo awesome and delicious!  You would never know they hardly have any fat!  In the future I will make them with less sugar than the recipe calls for because they were a little too sweet.  Otherwise they were soft and molasses-y :)

I thought this was an interesting recipe.  I actually got caught not knowing how much molasses I had on hand and being out of ginger.  I wound up going half molasses half honey and using cinnamon and allspice instead of ginger.  Pretty good.  I look forward to making this as written since my version lacks some of the "burn" of the ginger.  Give it a try if you're looking to cut saturated fat.
