Oh ya delicious!  I really love bananas foster and a restaurant that made it closed down and I haven't had it since.  So glad Chef John has the recipe and video to explain how to make it.  I couldn't find the banana liqueur, but it still turned out great.  The flavor is like eating at a fine dining restaurant. We've made it a few times now.  

We have a microwave above our stovetop, so we have to be careful - we pull the pan away from the stove and use a long nose flamer to light it so the flame-up doesn't damage our microwave.

I've searched for this recipe fir a long time. I recall my dad making this on special occasions when I was little. I remembered watching him and i remembered the ingredients but not the exact measurements. I tried on my own and came close but never quite got it.  THIS WAS IT! Thank you, thank you, thank you. A delicious blast from my past.

This is a delicious dessert and one that is really, really hard to mess up. You must use butter, brown sugar, and rum for the sauce to cook the bananas (the rest is just additional flavor)and it is wonderful over vanilla ice-cream, pound cake, waffles.  Something that I always add is vanilla extract.

Very good. My husband and I watched the video before making in. The recipe was very easy to make and tasted very delicious. We had ours with sweetened with cream and waffles. Divine! If I had to change anything, I probably would more brown sugar the next time I make it so the sauce I s little bit thicker.

Such an amazing dessert and so easy! It was a hit. I didn’t have banana liquor, so I just substituted with another ounce of white rum. I will definitely be making this again!

So quick and yummy!  I used 4 Tbsp of brown sugar and 4 Tbsp of butter.  Will consider trying  to add a little vanilla or molasses like some other reviewers, just for variety, but it was perfect just as Chef John describes! Have all your ingredients out and ready because it cooks quickly!

Originally I used light brown sugar, regular captain and Carmel vodka. It didn’t turn out well. It was too sugary. I made it again as the recipe says except for salted butter and it turned out perfect.  I was hoping to find some other liquors to use but didn’t happen. Love banana’s foster and it is an easy dish to make.

Mmm so good, yet so fast and simple. This recipe is a keeper for sure. I can't have too much sugar so used Xylitol + a bit of molasses to sub for brown sugar, and it was amazing.

A relatively quick and easy dessert, with ingredients that are usually on hand.  Ice cream scooped out and in bowls in the freezer before dinner helped to minimize the timing between dinner and dessert. Our exception to following the above recipe was banana liqueur, which we didn't have; Butterscotch Ripple Schnapps was the substitute.  I'll possibly add a dribble of that over the ice cream when serving next time - to boost the yum factor.  Really, almost any flavored liqueur (or even vanilla extract) would likely work here.  Perhaps we didn't wait long enough for the rum to self-ignite, but we ignited it with a BBQ lighter to prevent the bananas from overcooking.  Will try for more success on that part next time!  Clean up was easy too. 
Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

Great recipe. . My wife said it was one of the best desserts she has ever tasted. I left out the banana liqueur.  Thanks Chef John.

Question: The first few times I made the banana flambé, it was delicious, easy perfect.  The last three times my brown sugar didn't dissolve in the butter and hardened, separated in the sauce.  Not good.  What did I do different?  Maybe I used different brand of brown sugar, would light brown sugar or salt free butter mak that difference?  Help please.
