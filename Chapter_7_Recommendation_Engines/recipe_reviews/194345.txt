I made this for a reunion and it was a big hit!  The only problem is that the mint flavor wasn't really noticeable, and was overpowered by the lime.  Next time I think I will double the mint and maybe cut back on the lime zest and juice.  It is a really quick and tasty recipe as is though!

I think it's a very good recipe, I did use fresh lime juice.  It was not quite sweet enough tasting for me  because I used sugar free Lime Jello, so I added 4 packets of Splenda.  I will make it again.  :-)

This was the bomb. One of the most heavenly things I have ever tasted. I even used my pretzel knots whole to save a step and turned out yummy. easy as I like also.

I really wanted to like this recipe....but it was just 'ok'.   I used 1/2-3/4 the amount of Jello mix and increased the zest by a 1/3.   The taste/flavor was ok, so I don't think omitting some of the Jello was an issue.  For me, it was more of a texture issue.  I was expecting EITHER a cheesecake texture OR a much fluffier/lighter texture.  And this one to me is a mix between the two, and a little too 'cream-cheesey' (even though I like cream cheese).  If I make it again, I'll try to tweak it somehow......

This recipe went over well with the teen boys...all 15 of them!  It has just the right amount of zest per fluff (Cool Whip).  Loved tasting flavor without an overload of sugar.  It was very easy and will replace my labored cheesecake dish at holiday gatherings.  I found this recipe, in a pinch, because I ran out of sweetened condensed milk during my preparations.

this went over big time - thou I used lemon instead of lime & left out the mint.  It didn't last long at all & I was told to remember & make it again!
