It's ridiculous how good this tastes from a gravy mix! Definitely add soy sauce and take out the beef while cooking the veggies. I also added ground ginger, onion powder and garlic powder and a can of baby corn. Plus I grabbed a bag of fresh pre-cut broccoli (the kind you use for dipping in dressing and such) for super fast results! Dinner was on the table in 20 minutes!

Very tasty.  I marinated the beef with teriyaki sauce before cooking--it gave it a good kick.  Also, try browning the meat in sesame oil for an extra Asian flavor.  Additional ingredient to try--water chestnuts.

My husband and I both really liked this recipe, however I'm going to marinate the beef before I cook it next time for a little extra flavor.  For a low-carb alternative (to rice or noodles), I seved it over cauliflower that I'd steamed and mashed.

Too many onions and too much broccoli. When cut down on those two, this recipe is great.

This recipe was super quick and tasty!  I didn't have gravy mix, so I used beef stew mix, which was very flavorful and delicious!  Also, I used a frozen mix of vegetables with broccoli, colliflower, and carrots.  Very good.

Are you kidding me with these reviews?  Even with a little tweeking, this recipe is at best a TV dinner.  Save your efforts and hit the freezer section.

This was a great recipe.  I did try some suggestions like marinating the beef in worcestershire sauce and reducing the amount of broccoli, and the recipe turned out great.  My whole family loved it and wanted more.  Will definitely make again.

This was quick and easy but it would definitely be better with fresh broccoli and less water for a thicker gravy.  Next time, I will probably add water chestnuts for a little crunch.

Going off of previous ratings that said this recipe was bland I made a few small adjustments.  I put oil in the pan and added onion and garlic powder along with onion and garlic salt and coated the pan before adding the beef.  Then I added fresh garlic and while the beef was cooking added some soy sauce.  I also added sliced onions in with the beef.  Then I followed the directions exact and it came out fabulous.  It had flavor, and was easy to make.  My husband ate it over white rice and I ate it over ramon noodles.  We both thought it was great.

This recipe was a HUGE letdown. The beef was dry and tasteless by the time the veggies got done. I served it over rice but was VERY unhappy to see little to no gravy. On a positive note- it's very easy to cook. Next time I'll do so with major tweaking. Sorry!

I had gravy left over from a roast I made the night bfore, so I used that instead. Turned out great. Came together quickly, and was very tasty.

Well, this was a fast meal.  And you can mix it up anyway you like.  I used a small NY strip steak, a head of broccoli, some bean sprouts and the gravy mix.  It tasted OK but I think it could have been better.

This recipe was quick good and fast. I marinated the beef in giner, soy and mongalian fire oil 1st which gave it a kick... the only complaint really is the sauce was a little soupy... (its nice to add water chestnuts and baby corn and serve over brown rice)

This is a very good recipe! Not only that, it's quick and easy. Great when you don't have a lot of time to make dinner. I only modified it a little, adding some soy sauce and some extra pepper. It turned out great - there was nothing left!

If you are looking for quick and easy, this is it!  My 11 year old son helped me make it, and I think he could do it himself next time!  We added some garlic and a bit more pepper.  We also used about 1/2 cup more water.  The family enjoyed it served with rice.  This is definitely something this busy teacher-mom will use again!

Even though I added fresh ginger, fresh garlic, sesame oil and soy sauce we found this bland.  I served with rice noodles.  The flavor that soaked into the broccoli was nice but the meat didn't absorb any flavor. I think I'll keep looking for a beef n broccoli recipe.  Thanks anyway.

Good quick recipe!  Didn't have any gravy mix so I used gravy in the jar as well as adding some additional spices.  It came out great!  Almost like takeout!

A little plain, needs more spices added.

It was good, but something was missing.  I used the mushroom gravy mix since it had lower carbs.  Maybe that is why it came out very bland.  My sister liked it, but my husband thought it didn't have enough taste.

The beef was a little tough, so I think next time I'll partly pre-cook the broccoli first so it can cook for less time with the beef.  However, the recipe still got the thumbs up from this house.

This was great.  I added some garlic and my family devoured it.

This is one of my favorite things to make when i'm in a hurry.  It's so easy, and tastes great.  My family loves it when i make this for dinner.
