Forget the almond extract!  it was WAY TOO STRONG.  i made it a second time with out it and it turned out perfect.  my mother wanted to add some sweetener - honey or sweetened condensed milk is good.  also, best rolled in coconut dust (throw unsweetened coconut in a processor) the sweetened shredded kind doesn't stick real well.  truly though, i love raw food recipes and this one was great - even my 2-yearold loved it!

Absolutely love this recipe flavour is great I used vanilla extract instead of almond & mixed the coconut in as it didnt stick very well when rolled. Very healthy snack with no flour sugar or dairy. Although Apricots are high in sugar. I guess we could use any dried fruit. Wonderful thanks

Made the recipe exactly as written.  I did find a lot of cinnamon at the bottom of the food processor bowl, so next time I'll make one small change.  I'll grind up the nuts and apricots, then sprinkle the cinnamon on the top of the mixture, and then pulse until the cinnamon is incorporated.  You could probably get away with adding half the amount of almond extract, as that flavor might was just a little too dominant (at least for me).  Each truffle is just a pop of fruity sweetness; nice and easy recipe.
