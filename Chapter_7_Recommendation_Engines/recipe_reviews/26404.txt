The whole family loved this!!!  I stuck to the basic recipe, with just a couple changes.  I didn't have any green bell peppers in the fridge, so I substituted a poblano pepper.  The slightly spicy flavor of the poblano mixed nicely with the cumin, corn, and garlic.  I also used frozen diced hash brown potatoes instead of the red potatoes to save some prep/cooking time (something I do with most recipes that call for potatoes).  The biggest change I made, though, was substituting evaporated skim milk instead of the milk and cream so that it's much lower in fat.  It was still thick and creamy, thanks to the pureed corn.  Oh, and (recipe author, please correct me if I'm wrong), I think there was a typo on the amount of sausage--I think it's supposed to be 14 oz, not 4 oz.  The packs of kielbasa from the store only come in 14 oz packs, so 4 oz would be just a tiny bit.  I used the whole 14 oz and it seemed to be the perfect amount of sausage for the recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe! We're vegetarian so we omit the sausage and use veggie broth in place of the chicken broth.  I also add 2 bay leaves, use one cup of half and half in place of the milk and cream and add 1 cup of grated pepper jack cheese.  It's marvelous!

Very tasty - even better the next day. For the most part, I followed the recipe except...  In step 1 - sauteed the veggies in a skillet, transferred to pot. In step 2 - browned kielbasa in same skillet, transferred to pot. Mopped up excess grease from skillet with paper towel then deglazed with chicken broth to release the fond then added to pot.  I used a bag of diced potatoes which seemed to take a long time to soften. Next time I will use red potatoes the recipe calls for. I also found I needed more chicken broth. I will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

This review reflects substantial changes so bypass it if wanting to follow the recipe as written. Looked through 59 reviews at time of this one, and identified changes others had made and then threw in one or two new ones. Used a 15-1/4 ounce can whole kernel sweet corn and a 14-3/4 ounce can cream style sweet corn, and placed those directly in soup without pureeing the corn. Subbed 6 oz. evaporated milk for 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup heavy cream. Used 14 ounce hardwood smoked turkey kielbasa (4 ounces shown in recipe is likely an error). Added 2 fresh jalapeno peppers, thinly sliced, 5 stalks chopped celery, and 3 chopped carrots to cook with the onion mixture. In the 2nd step, added 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning, and 1/2 cup fresh, finely chopped parsley after stirring in the corn, kielbasa, and milk. The jalapenos gave this soup some heat, but was perfect for us. We super enjoyed this soup, and will be among our favorites. Thank you MOLSON7 for sharing, and we couldn’t have done it without you.

My family liked it, I LOVED it; however we were a bit disappointed at the lack of creaminess.  I think next time I would use less chicken broth, more heavy cream or even 1/2 'n 1/2, also add some shredded cheese perhaps.  The flavor was delicious though, and as my young daughter said: very colorful.  I would made this again.

Excellent recipe. Great on a cold winter's night.  Used a half cup of heavy cream and found it to be very creamy.

I read reviews first and made a few changes. I used 4 chicken sausage (andouille brand) diced it up and browed in frying pan. It needed some more chicken broth so added about another 1/2 cup. I used 1 can of corn drained and 1 can of cream corn instead of blending. as it was cooking, added a bit more heavy whipping cream (did not measure) trying to help thicken it a bit. & used half & half instead of milk. I had no Cumin, and didn't measure the white pepper. Added lawrys season salt & Spicy Montreal seasoning as well. The liquid part was more of a soup then chowder. but with all the veggies in it was perfect. If i thickened it up with cornstarch it may be too heavy.

LOVED IT LOVED IT.... I used table cream instead of heavy cream and next time I will probably just use more milk to cut down calories (I don't think it will affect the taste too much) Also, I didn't have enough corn so I filled in the remainder with some frozen mixed veggies and in the process added more greens to the meal. Never hurts! Also, I added a little bit of Louisiana Gold hot sauce to the mix and when we served it we put tabasco in too. Really gave it a great kick. We'll be making this often for sure!

My family loved this.  The only changes I made were that I used a spicy sausage, and left out the peppers (there were peppers in the sausage).  I made it early in the morning, put it in the fridge, and then reheated it for dinner.  The flavors blended wonderfully.  I will definitely make this one again.

This chowder was a tasty change from the usual potato soup I make.  I am planning on making this soup again, although I will probably add the green pepper later in the cooking stage to prevent it from overcooking and losing its nice green coloring.

Pretty good. I'm not a big fan of soup- but I do love sausage. This was hearty and a good meal for the colder days. Husband loved it! Will keep in my recipe book.

MMMMMM!! This is my new Favorite Soup!!! I did'nt have any peppers on hand so I added 1 thickly shredded carrot and some brocoli. I used 3 white potatoes and 14 ounces of lite smoked sausages, I also added more cream and topped this off with some scallions and cilantro. While most of the portions are off I would keep the corn amount the same. It may seem like much but its not. Thanks for the wonderful recipe:)

This is really good on a rainy night with french bread and a salad. I used 2 1/2 oz of evaporated milk instead of cream and a bay leaf like others suggested. I also browned the kielbasa before adding it to the pot.

Very Good! I made it with 1 lb of mild italian sausage, which I cooked, browned and sliced. I believe it would be equally good with deli ham. I will definitely will make this again!

Our grocery store didn't have good green bell pepper so I substituted poblano and I also added some asadero cheese and a little cornstarch to make the broth thicker.  Turned out amazing.  This is a great soup!

I love this soup! I just made a double batch of this soup as well as the Newport Clamp Chowder I found on this site and both received rave reviews from my family. We were out camping and I didn't have a way to puree some of the corn so I just put all the corn in whole. It worked just fine. I had read a review that said they thought the 4oz of kielbasa was a typo and that is should be 14oz. I agree.  I used 28oz for my double batch and it was a good amount. Will be making this again probably very soon.

I played with this. Only red bell pepper, added in a cup of leftover black beans, 1 can each of corn and creamed corn. Instead of milk or cream I put immersion blender over a few potato pieces and blended. Topped with a little pepper jack and cilantro.

This started out good.But I didn't have a bell pepper so I didn't worry about an peppers.I sauteed the diced onions in about a half stick/butter and added 2 tablespoons of minced garlic.Didn't have white pepper so I used red ground pepper and I also added a half teaspoon of Old Bay.I also added a teaspoon of salt.Everything else just as recipe called for.However I did not puree the corn.I added a can of rinsed white corn to it and a can of cream corn to mixture.This was perfect because the liquid was starting to thicken before I added the cream and milk so the cream corn also added liquid.I boiled my potatoes before I added to mixture.I got them to the point where a knife easily pushes through them but were still firm,then they softened up more when added to mixture.If I would have had some small shrimp I would have added it.This is good so we will be making this again.But I always always always tweak recipes that I find here.It's my common practice.The mind gets to thinking and BAM creative juices flow!Thanks Molson.

Very good.  It had a nice natural sweetness.  I followed the instructions exactly excepted used 1 can fat free evaporated milk instead of the milk and heavy cream (to make healthier) and 2 chicken herb sausages (that's all I had).

Wow! This was delicious! I will be making this recipe again and again. I doubled the cumin and white pepper and it came out perfectly; very flavorful. I also doubled the kielbasa and browned it first. Mine had to cook a little longer so the potatoes would soften up. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This was perfect for the cold dreary day today.  I did as some other reviewers recommended and doubled the cumin and pepper, though I used black pepper instead of white.  I also used the entire package of kielbasa.  No cream in the house, but evaporated milk worked fine.  Served with a few drops of hot sauce, and between the two of us, almost finished off the whole pot.  Delicious!

Very good! Impressed with the blend of flavors and all the different colors. I used several different colors of bell peppers and changed a few minor things after reading other reviews. It was very good.

I made this recipe almost exactly and it was delicious.  It was a little sweet from the corns and onions, but I threw in a handful of cheddar cheese and that cut into the sweetness a little bit.

Also, like the prior person suggested, I used a whole package of keilbasa (16 oz.).  What I didn't know and understand until I actually sliced up the kielbasa was that it was already cooked - I was expected more of an Italian sausage consistency, but it was firm.  It made it a lot easier!

Great hearty chowder that my 3 and 5 year old gobbled up!

I'm giving this 5 stars because my husband absolutely loved it.  I thought it was pretty good. Very easy to make.  I used frozen corn and 8 oz. kielbasa.  Next time I will add some additional seasoning to give it more flavor.

Seriously amazing!  I made it vegtarian with no-chicken broth and Morningstar sausage links.  I left out the peppers since I didn't have any.  Doubled the spices. This is a keeper!!

This soup was a big hit with us, especially my 2 y/o and 3 y/o. Made a few changes, of course - sautéed the kielbasa along with the onion, peppers and garlic then set it aside (LOVE the flavor of the browned, crispy casing. Used a can of creamed corn plus a can of regular corn kernels, and also threw in a sachet of jamon seasoning for a bit of extra porky flavor. Turned out great! Served it with warm crusty bread for a hearty Fall lunch. Thanks!

Really delicious!  I used a can of evaporated milk in place of the milk and heavy cream.  For the corn, I used 2 cans and pureed one can.  I also added celery and an extra cup of water because 2 cups of broth did not cover all the poatoes.  Great comfort food!

A great recipe that you really should try!  Only changes made were the omission of the green bell pepper and tripled the milk & cream while cooking for more "broth."  Very filling, very decorative, very good!

When I had my first bowl last night I was going to give this recipe 4 stars, but after having it sit overnight and letting the flavors bend I'm going to give it 5 stars! Very good and hearty! I used half butter/olive oil to cook the veggies, turkey kielbasa and fat free evaporated milk and it was still excellent!

I thought this was delicious, and I thought it thickened pretty well. The only changes I made were that I used russet potatoes because that is what I had, and I didn't bother to puree the corn.

This soup is really great.  I added celery,carrots, curry marsala spice, and used evaporated milk instead of the cream.  I think there is a typo on the amount of sausage, so I used a whole kielbasa.

I made this as written, with turkey kielbasa. It was really salty (my fault), but I guess I just don't like the sausage in soup genre. I would have liked it very much with no kielbasa at all, but I needed to rate this truthfully so I remember not to make it again!

This was really good and very hearty!  After reading the reviews, I decided to double the cumin & white pepper.  I'm glad I did; the spices were just right.  I also added a couple of minced jalapenos with the peppers and onions.  Additionally, I replaced the milk & cream with fat free  half and half.  I inadvertently allowed the finished product to come to a boil causing the half and half to curdle.  I remedied the problem by adding a cornstarch slurry.    We had this on a night when the temperature reached 12 here in the Fort Worth area.  It was a perfect meal for a night like that!  I'm going to make it again soon with bacon instead of sausage.  Lots and lots of bacon.

I added some celery, extra cumin, and a chopped red jalapeno for extra heat and it turned out good. I also did not puree any of the corn but I don't like my chowder or soups real thick. This has a nice blend of flavors and I will make again.

Could be that I'm sick, but this is an excellent "sick" soup and great for the upcoming winter.  Instead of heavy cream, I used 2/3 cup milk and then cornstarch to thicken the soup.  Also used garlic powder instead of cloves, and sweet Italian sausage instead of kielbasa, which I de-skinned and crumbled into the soup.  Thick, hearty, and perfect!  Great recipe!

I give this three stars as is but four with changes.  I made this as is and found it was missing something.  I doubled the white pepper and cumin and added some fresh cilantro(also prettier due to)some black pepper and paprika.  I will try this again with spicy sausage and a mix of spicy pepper.

This is an awesome soup! I took the advice of some other reviewers and used a pablano pepper instead of the bell peppers, and evaporated skim milk instead of the milk/cream. I also ended up adding some season salt at the end becasue it seemed like it was missing something. The soup was a little too thin for my liking so I did a few pulses with my immersion blender and that did the job perfectly. I will definitely be making this again.

Good flavor, but I made some minor changes.  I used a can of cream corn and half a bag of frozen whole kernel corn.  Also skipped the red peppers because I didn't have any.  The sauce was kinda thin.  I din't have cornstarch so I added some flour to thicken it up a little.  Was fairly easy and quick.  I will be making this again!

Excellent! I had to do a lot of substitutes, and I held the potatoes so I could pour the soup over crisp tater tots, used only 1 1/4 cup of broth, black pepper, 1 can of corn with 1 can of creamstyle corn, 2/3 cup of milk and no cream, and smoked turkey kielbasa. I read the reviews and added corn starch and bits of cheddar and jack.

To reduce the sodium content I have used low sodium chicken broth and sometimes even eliminated the kielbasa and this soup still tastes and looks great! It's colorful and yummy and tastes good leftover (I've never tried freezing it though). I like the amount of cream (not too heavy) and if I want a creamier texture I puree more of the corn.

YUMMY.  The only changes I made was to add a little salt and a little cheyenne pepper as another reviewer suggested.
Also, I would never saute garlic for 15 minutes, I added it at the 14 minute cooking time.

I’d say this recipe is a solid 3 as written, fairly bland but ok.  With adjustments- and I didn’t make any until this was done, for the most part- this is a 5. INSANELY good!  Before I made any major changes at the end of cooking, I began by dicing the 14 oz of kielbasa and browning it along with the veggies.  I also added a minced jalapeño to the veggie mixture.  By accident I added the corn at the same time I added the potato so it cooked 20 minutes longer than it otherwise would have, but I think that only helped the soup to be more creamy.  Flavor-wise, after the soup was finished cooking and I realized that it was bland I added salt, chipotle powder, a dash of toasted onion powder, a dash of roasted garlic powder,  a little extra cumin, smoked paprika, and a dash of cayenne.  FANTASTIC.  My family, even the picky-ish tween- raved about it!  I made this because corn chowder is my husband’s favorite and he says it is unequivocally the best he’s ever had!

I made this and it was awesome. Very tasty just as written. I tripled the recipe and used too much broth. It could have been thicker but that was my fault. Everyone loved it and I'll do better next time.

Fantastic recipe.  We love green chilis so I cut out the peppers and added about a 1/2 cup finely chopped green chilis.  I also substituted the kielbasa for a spicy chicken sausage.  Definitely making this one again for those cool fall days!!!

Really good, liked by all. Used half and half instead of milk & cream, added a few shakes of Old Bay seasoning to punch up the flavor, and browned an entire package of chopped turkey kielbasa in a pan before adding it in to the soup. Probably could have bumped up the broth by another 1/2 to 1 cup to stretch it out a tad bit more (made a scant 6 portions), but a great summer meal paired with a salad and some crusty bread.

Loved it! I didn't have cumin or white pepper but I made it just like the recipe said other than that. Don't leave out the bell pepper - it adds a wonderful flavor.  My hubby and children liked it too, so I'll be making it again.

I made this the first time with only one change...and it was worth it. I used the garlic kielbasa from costco. It adds another layer of flavor. I also use 4x the amount listed. I have since used the regular and there is a difference. I will always use the garlic flavor. To cut the fat I have also used whole milk instead of cream. I use an emulsion blender and mix the milk with the corn and add 2 tbsp of corn starch. Family loves this and it is better the next day! Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I love corn chowders and this one was great. It was not the fault of the recipe that I did not give it five stars, it was my fault. I used turkey kielbasa because my daughter does not eat meat and I think the real kielbasa would have added more flavor. I will prepare and rate again soon.

For me, this recipe is 4 stars.  I really like all the ingredients but I prefer more flavor/spice in a hearty chowder type of soup.  So I added a 1/4 tsp Cayenne and a little salt and black pepper during the last 20 minutes of cooking.  I think those spices improved the flavor quite a bit.  I will make this again but possible try a spicy sausage...like a jalapeño chicken sausage might be really good.

I think it needed more flavor. I'm going to add salt and black pepper. I don't like kielbasa, so I used cajun chicken sausage and chicken roasted garlic sausage.

I really liked this - especially the next day. Skipped the green pepper, added half a bag of carrot coins, added an extra cup of broth, 14 oz of kielbasa (which was maybe a little bit much but a lot closer to correct than 4oz. Maybe 8-10oz would be right) and used all cashew or almond milk instead of the milk and cream.  At the suggestion of another reviewer I added some old bay after the fact which was a very nice addition and would recommend adding a decent amount to the soup itself while cooking. Also consider adding a bay leaf during cooking.

I thought this was a good idea but I did make some changes. I added one can of evaporated milk in place of the milk and heavy cream. I also added another can of chicken broth. I also added a block of cheddar cheese to give it a cheesy flavor. I shredded it finely and added it at the end slowly. I also added a little bit of Cayanne pepper for a little kick. I didn't like how many peppers were in it so next time I would add about half. I might also change the kind of potato so they stay whole chunks instead of mushing out.

Yummmm!  Five STAR and will be in my "will make again" box.  I used most of the ingredients (what I had)--omitted green pepper and used the orange pepper that I had.  Used Idaho's cause had them but am sure the red potatoes would have only made it butter.  Used veggie broth + 2 chicken bouillon cubes.  Used spicy + mild sausage (again, it is what I had).  My corn was less (no puréeing) and added 3 med carrots.  Was super excellent especially after the first snow which was at least 6" that stayed. #notASnowFan but am this chowder fan

Really yummy recipe!! I added a very small poblano pepper and some cayenne pepper.  A little bit of spice was just what it needed. Also, I didn't skimp on the blended corn, it really thickened it up nicely.  Delish!

Really good soup.  We used an entire package of kielbasa and browned the sausage with the veggies.  To make it a little thicker, we added 1T (heaping) of flour to the sausage/veggies before adding the broth.  Used an entire 1lb bag of frozen corn (pureeing half the bag, as directed) and half&half.  Delicious!

This was very good. I needed to add more liquid--the soup was too thick otherwise. Also, I added Parmesan cheese on top. Very yummy! Will eat again.

As the recipe is written, it was BLAND!  I kept referring back to the recipe to see if I had left out any ingredients.  After I doubled the milk, heavy cream, added salt and red pepper did it have any flavor.

I looked at reviewers suggestions and opted to follow them.  I used 1 cup of Heavy Cream, Chicken Sausage with Peppers, 1 1/2 c frozen corn, 1 can cream style corn, 4 ounces cream cheese and doubled the pepper and cumin.   All other ingredients remained the same.  This was  the mot amazing sausage corn chowder.  FANTASTIC!!!!  Loved it!!!

Wow! This was great. I used twice the amount of sausage (half a package of kielbasa), and I browned it before adding. I also added water as I cooked it (about a cup and a half overall), since the broth boiled away fairly quickly. I actually added a couple of teaspoons of salt since I was afraid the potatoes would absorb it all. When I make it again (and I will!) I'll add a bit less salt.

It was pretty good. I felt like it needed more seasoning, maybe more cumin or some celery or something. But the taste was good. My kids (all under 8) liked it except for the peppers.

Tried it and my boyfriend loved it! He is usually the one that is picky about flavor and what not. It was a little on the thin side, so I may try to thicken it up a little next time. But over all pretty good!

We really loved this! I played w/the amounts of some of the ingredients & added chopped carrots & celery(& used polish sausage) because I'm trying to empty my fridge, plus I was feeding 20 people. Unbelievably good! We loved the cumin!

This is excellent!  My hubby & I could eat this once a week.  I make a big batch for lunches & leftovers.  I have also added a can of diced green chiles to kick it up a notch and is very good.  I use a can of creamed corn and a can of regular corn and don't put anything in the blender.

Very good!  I used turkey kielbasa and used the full link....14oz I think.  The recipe asked for 4...that just sounded like very little.  I did add one more can of chicken broth as it was quite thick.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and thought it was excellent!  Will make again!

This was an awesome dish.. I'm a single professional and this made enough to take for lunch a few days. I added a bit more cream and let it sit longer then recomended. I also added an extra tsp of cumin AND white pepper. I think next time I will add some cayene for some extra kick. Using an orange or yellow bell pepper also gives it a very bright look.

I liked this. I rendered the sausage (I think this should be 14 ounces) first to get some of the grease out and completely forgot to buy peppers so I had to leave them out. I couldn't even taste the tiny bit of cumin so instead of adding more I added some Old Bay seasoning as another reviewer suggested. Also didn't bother with pureeing the corn and it was still thick enough for me. A keeper that will be made again. Thank you Molson7.

This was an awesome meal!  Even my picky hubby and kids enjoyed it!  I modified it (based on what I had on hand)...I used canned creamy corn and regular corn drained. I substituted can milk for the milk and heavy cream, used a yellow pepper, pan fried the eckrich sausage in olive oil and added about 5 squirts of Louisiana Hot Sauce!  This will definitely be made at least once a month!  Oh, and next time I will add corn starch to make it a little thicker.

Wonderful recipe, and easy! I added a dash of cayenne pepper for a little kick. These leftovers didn't last long.

This was a big hit. My Nephew liked it so much that he ate almost the whole pot in one night and asked for more. I added spinach to the second pot and liked that too. This will be a permanent  recipe on our soup line up.

Tasted terrific! But it makes for really small servings. I halved the recipe, and that was too little for my husband and me. I'd say the recipe listed serves 4 rather than 6.

I think there's a typo in the recipe - it looks like it should be 14 ounces kielbasa, and not just 4.

LOVE this one! It's a great way to use up all those peppers from the garden at the end of the season and it freezes wonderfully. It makes a much better quick lunch than Lean Cuisine.

I had hoped that this chowder would be a unique fun experience.  But instead it was a bland experience.  Even with the addition of onion, garlic, cumin, and peppers.  This was very bland.
