Definatly a lighter more cake-like texture although we found it a bit dry.  We loved the orange chocolate coffee flavor but could have done without the cranberries and chips

Fun combination and something different! I was out of sour cream so I used some plain greek yogurt. I liked the little bit of coffee taste :)

This recipe DOES NOT make one dozen muffins. It makes two.
The "cappuccino" flavor is very subtle. Next time, I won't add any coffee at all.
The flavor, though, is delicious. Very chocolatey (however, I also had to add some chocolate yogurt, since I lacked 1/4 cup out of the cup needed for sour cream) and the cranberries kept their moistness.
I added orange extract instead of orange zest and wasn't satisfied. Maybe the zest would have given off a stronger flavor?
Would definitely make these again.

These are not bad but I don't think I will bake them again. They are fluffy, cake-like the first day. Next day they get little more like muffins. However, I think they are too dry for muffins. Orange-chocolate combination is pretty interesting. I was hoping for a good coffee flavored muffin but you cannot taste any coffee there. I actually did 2 batches. First batch as is except I omitted cranberries. Second batch I upped coffee granules to 4TBSP with no orange zest or cranberries. It still was not enough for a nice coffee flavored muffin. The coffee just intensified the flavor of chocolate.

I LOVED how these muffins turned out. As others said, these are cakey muffins: moist, fluffy and deliciously chocolatey! I did however tweak the recipe to my hubby's liking by removing the orange zest and cranberries and doubling the chocolate chips.I was able to make 16 large muffins from this recipe. I will definitely make these again!

Wow, there is so much going on in these muffins! They are a lighter, cake-like muffin.  The orange and chocolate flavors are predominant with only slight undertones of the cranberries and coffee. Personally, I would prefer these for an after dinner sweet rather than breakfast. I made the entire recipe and got 22 muffins. I hope they freeze well. **Update - Oddly enough, the next day after having sat under a cake dome, these muffins were not cake-like at all. They had more of a muffin texture.

These muffins were amazing!  Everyone loved them!  All the flavors complimented each other quite nicely.  I did replace a little of the milk with orange juice since I happened to have it on hand, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written and they turned out great.  I actually got 18 muffins out of this rather than the 12 stated though.  I will definitely be making these again!

Very yummy, thanks for posting! This is a cake-y, not dense, muffin that is sooo chocolate-y that it feels sinful eating it for breakfast! Next time I will add more dried cranberries, that's personal taste, I loved them in all that chocolate and coffee. (I used two strong shots of espresso in place of the 1/4 cup water and coffee granules and that worked.) Thanks again
