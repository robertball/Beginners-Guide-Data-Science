I followed this recipe step-by-step and added a little lemon juice as suggested. I don't know if it was something I did wrong or the actual cake but it didn't come out good. It was for my daughter's birthday party and it was all mushy and lumpy. Not fluffy and light. The only thing that saved it was the Butter Cream Frosting II. I don't think I'll be doing this cake again.

This recipe is really easy to make, but it's annoying to have to wait for the sugar and eggs.  The cake comes out very sweet and is just great.
