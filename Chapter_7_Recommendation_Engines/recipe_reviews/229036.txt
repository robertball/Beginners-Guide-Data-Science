Do yourself a flavor and lighten this dish up by substituting 1 cup of Plain, non-fat Yoghurt for the cup of Mayo! I'm never going back to the mayo again! Add salt to taste after if you prefer, however I assure you the taste of this dish will not be altered!

Mom made this recipe at least twice a month for my entire teenage life. With that said, I feel I have earned the ability to comment on and tweak this recipe...(A single working mother, mom disliked food prep and simply didn't have the time to cook extravagant meals for four kids). She would make this recipe with frozen broccoli and diced chicken breast.) *Please note, raw chicken adds substantial cooking time.* 

I remember this dish with its over abundance of fat laden mayo feeling too heavy. I also recently tried lightening this recipe with lite mayo instead and still, it tasted too heavy.

Curried Chicken & Broccoli Casserole Haiku: "Bit too lemony. And saw no need for 'layers.' Just moosh together." Not sure what the point was of layering broccoli, then chicken, then the soup/mayo mixture, so I just mixed them together. We also thought that 1/4 c. of lemon juice was too much. AR's "Chicken LaPaloma" is very similar to this, and I think I like it better b/c it has less lemon juice. The curry is the real stand-out here; it's unlikely that I'll ever make a chick/brocc casserole w/o it. Oh the only thing that I changed was topping half of it w/ French-fried onions (my daughter's fave casserole topper), and the other half w/ bran flakes that I'd mixed w/ a little melted butter, as I find corn flakes too sweet for some reason.

This was a great recipe!!! I added cooked penne noodles with the broccoli and chicken in a bowl and poured that as the bottom layer. Then added real bacon bits on top of the cheese (I used more cheese then suggested, because I love cheese) with the crushed corn flakes on top which added a ton of flavor. I will definitally be making this again!!!

My family liked this one (except for the super picky eater who doesn't like anything made with cream soups). I found it to be a little too lemon-y from the juice. And I should have drained the broccoli better as it ended up being a little runny in the bottom. Next time I'll cut down the lemon juice by half and then I think the flavour balance would work better for me.

This is almost the exact recipe I grew up eating (and I was also known to request it for my birthdays!) Precooked rotisserie chickens weren't at every grocery when I was little. My mom always just cooked boneless tenders or breasts then cubed. As a super lazy grownup cook I buy precooked frozen chicken breast cubes and use frozen broccoli florets. The one thing I've done differently over the years is to increase the amount of curry powder. I'm up to about 2 tablespoons but I really love curry. Don't tinker with the lemon juice! I've left it out by mistake and tried extra "just to see". The first had no zip and the second was awful. I have also had good success freezing just add the corn flakes after it comes out of the freezer to keep them from getting too soggy. Crushed corn Chex works great too. My family likes it with rice. Worth making enough to have leftovers!

Haven't made it yet but other than using a rotisserre chicken fresh broccoli and curry powder it's like a favorite of my family for many years called "Chicken Divan" from a BH&G casserole cookbook SO it's got to be delicious because we like Spice Islands curry powder too. By the way I usually use leftover turkey (I freeze the dark meat we don't eat along with white meat sliced/cubed/bits and pieces--doesn't matter it's good for so many recipes. Going to make this one ASAP. Thanks for the hint about making up ahead and freezing for when you need a quick meal. I line my baking dish so after it is frozen I can lift it out of the pan--freeing it for other dishes.

Very good! I didn't have corn flakes so used corn chips and it worked just fine. Also added corn. The family approved and said i should make it again.

This was ok for a week night meal. I read the previous comments and put just over half of the amount of lemon juice in and it was still pretty lemony. I also used sour cream instead of mayo to lighten it up. Over all it is decent and has a lot of potential. I cooked some bacon and cut it up and put on top towards the end of the baking time. You can do a lot with this which is a pretty good start.

this is good instead of lemon juice I use a teaspoon of mustard. I also serve it with rice. I really like it with cornflakes. I used to top it with crushed crackers or bread crumbs but cornflakes is much better.Also i have left the chicken out before and added extra veggies. Mushrooms are especially good.

My husband kept getting more helpings but it was a bit too lemony for my taste. I always make recipes according to directions the first time and then adjust going forward. I will make again and increase the curry to 1 T (we love curry) and cut the lemon juice at least in half.

Great recipe! Based on other's feedback I used only 1/4 the amount of lemon juice required. I also omitted any carb toppings because I'm doing a low carb high fat diet. Perfect recipe! And my daughter who griped about having to eat casserole for dinner got seconds. My favorite chicken broccoli cheese casserole hands down!

Excellent recipe. Like another poster I always called this chicken divan but my recipe has two major differences. Less lemon (1 tbsp) and add 1/4 cup white wine. I use an inexpensive chardonnay and NOT cooking wine. I don't use the corn flakes but I don't think this impacts the taste.

This is really good! It's one of those meals that I grew up eating and now make for my kids. The only changes I make are 1) adding more broccoli 2)making my own cream of chicken soup instead of using canned and MOST IMPORTANTLY 3)using seasoned croutons in place of the cornflakes. This adds more flavor and a better crunch than just plain corn flakes.

I took the suggestion and cut back on the lemon and mayo added a small chopped onion also used a bag of frozen chopped Broccoli instead cause that is what I had. I threw in about 2 cup of uncooked egg noodles so added 1 cup of water. Covered it for 30 min so the noodles would cook right. Uncovered and added the corn flakes with the finished cook time. EXCELLENT If you freeze this with the uncooked noodles no need to cover it when you cook it. the unfreezing process with finish the noodles just right

A rotisserie chicken is LOADED with sodium. I made it with rotisserie and couldn't eat it. So salty! I would try again but I will really watch how much sodium goes into this.

I made this exactly as called for and it was a tremendous hit with my family. I put it together early in the day refrigerated it and pulled it out for dinner. I added the cornflakes and almonds at the last minute before putting it in the oven. Perfect! I have a similar recipe without the curry which we all liked but the curry adds so much flavor. Thank you!

My husband really liked this meal. I did add sautéed mushrooms and 1&1/2 cups of cooked rice. I did a mixture of wild rice and differs types of rice. Costco. Delicious. I'll definitely make this again.

This was excellent with the following changes: I used a cup of sour cream instead of mayo a third of a small lemon about 1/2 cup of dry white wine (I eyeballed it) and more curry than the recipe called for (eyeballed that too and tasted as I went along). I also sauteed an onion and celery mix I had on hand and added that. I used frozen broccoli.--no microwave. I let it sit in a strainer for about an hour and then I mixed everything together rather than layer. The broccoli was cooked but slightly firm not mushy. I topped with a mixture of Ritz crackers and french fried onion and topped with shredded sharp cheddar. It was a huge hit. I added the wine because the sauce with the 2 soups and the sour cream was too thick. Adding the wine added great flavor and loosened the sauce up. Use a dry white not a chardonnay or something too sour. The family loved it.

I've made muy own rendition of this recipe for years never even knew it was it's own thing. This is different mainly because of the curry. I'm usually not a great fan of curry but this dish is delicious! I used Sour cream in place of mayonnaise and a little less lemon juice. I added egg noodles as to not have to make a side dish. I used tons of cheese because my family and I love cheese so I add in Velveeta cheese into the mix topped with breadcrumbs and shredded cheese and then fresh crumbled bacon!

This recipe turned out amazingly! I didn t have corn flakes so I put potato sticks on top. Absolutely delicious! At first I was a little leery because the curry smelled very strong and I didn t know if it was going to be too much but it ended up being just right and not overpowering. This is a favorite for sure!

This was good as we love the curry flavour in it. I doubled the curry amount and probably added a little bit more cheese but all in all it was a good convenient easy weeknight dinner. I loved using the rotisserie chicken to save time.

Yes. I have been making this for years. I cook rice and put it in the pan first before adding the rest of the ingredients. I use less lemon juice and I use cubed sour dough bread instead of the corn flakes.

I add rice on the bottom (Uncle Bens wild and brown package). I also substitute one can of the chicken soup for 1 cream of mushroom. It takes away that yellowish color and adds some flavor. 1/4 cup of lemon juice seems excessive....so I cut down on that. We make this at least once a month...a keeper!

I followed this recipe exactly as written. This has to be one recipe out of many that I have to disagree with most of the reviews. This recipe was very disappointing. My family of 5 all thought it was just ok. The curry taste overwhelmed the dish and basically ruined it. I will never make this again.

Sounds delish but wondering how to adjust it for lactose free... Can use lactose free cream milk and cheese but what substitutes for cream of chicken soup? Maybe chicken broth thickened with corn starch. Ideas.

I was very disappointed. In order to get it cooked through and through I baked it for over 1 hour. As a result the broccoli was cooked to mush. The cheese topping took away from the dish. If I make it again broccoli will be on the side not part of the dish.

I used sour cream instead of mayo French fried onions instead of cornflakes and frozen instead of fresh broccoli. I also used 1 tin of cream of mushroom and 1 tin of cream of chicken instead of 2 tins of cream of chicken added some parsley and onion powder used about 1/2 the lemon juice called for and increased the curry to 1&1/2 teaspoons.

3 1/2 - 4 stars. I knew when I saw that this was made with canned soup that it wouldn't be my style of cooking. But I made it anyway. If the sauce was made from scratch it would have warranted 5 stars. I doubt if I would make this again. My husband did like it but I'd rather use these ingredients in another way a more healthy way. I also wasn't happy to use 1 cup of mayo...wow this is a high calorie dish. I think I would have also liked it with more chicken and less sauce.

I came across a can of water chestnuts when I got the soup from the pantry. I drained, chopped them up and added them. Turned out fine. I only make half the recipe when it's only one or two of us. With a couple spoonfuls of rice added and a bit of cottage cheese, the half recipe made enough for six lunches for me; I froze some.  Our family has been making this dish for a few years because we like it so much. We know it by a different name.

My mil makes this and it is so good. Well today I was craving it so I made it. Way to much liquid. I used half of what the directions required me to mix and even that I think was to much. Not sure why but it really wasn't that good. Then I saw another one that used a lot less and cream of broccolii. I think I'll try that one next time. Now my stomach feels bloated and not so happy.

I love this recipe! When I crave comfort food and curry I make this. I make my own curry spices in a big jar and use that as the curry spice called for in the recipe. I make enough so that I can freeze 2 or 3 portions.

Followed the recipe with no changes. The mayonnaise flavor was overpowering and off putting. Suggest using less mayo however I won't make it again.

Simple easy and good. Made as written except I accidentally poured the sauce over the broccoli before adding the chicken (evidently I couldn't read ha! ). I ended up just mixing the chicken into the sauce so it wouldn't get dry. You could easily just mix everything together without layering it and it would be just fine. I didn't have a problem with it tasting too lemony like other reviewers stated. I love the crunch the corn flakes gives to the dish. I also used a three-cheese blend that included sharp cheddar which gave it an additional little tang to go along with the lemon.

Great recipe and a good way to use up your leftover turkey. Was not crazy about the cornflake topping. If I make it again I will top it with seasoned breadcrumbs.

This was good. I used leftover rotisserie chicken we had which made this recipe so easy and fairly quick to make. It was good but I followed the suggestions of some reviewers and added a little extra curry. Next time I will add a little less curry than what is called for as it was over-powering to us. Thank you for a quick easy mid-week dinner.

Made the recipe precisely as written and will definitely make it again. I served it over rice and particularly loved the crunchy topping. The only slight change would be to reduce or eliminate the lemon juice. It seemed to overpower the other flavors.

Made it to the directions. Too "rich". Too "lemony" almost like the curry is added to cover the flavour of the left overs that were used to create this dish initially. Just throw it all in cleanout the fridge oh and the cereal that's gone stale... what?!! Not tasty.

This was very good. I used cream of mushroom because I didn't have the cream of chicken I added a bit of left-over gravy to it from my home roasted chicken didn't have cornflakes so used bread crumbs. It was very good but too lemony. I'll make it again and just skip the lemon juice and it'll be worth 5 stars.

This is a day after Thanksgiving tradition in our house. We use leftover turkey only 2T of lemon juice cream of whatever and leftover stuffing as the topping. The lemon brightens it a little but not so much that it tastes lemony. To me the curry is what makes this amazing!

I ve made this recipe for over 20 years with these changes. I use raw chicken breasts cut in half and breads crumbs instead of corn flakes. I sometimes put a cup of uncooked rice in the bottom of the baking dish along with two cups of chicken broth or stock then the broccoli chicken breast etc. This makes a delicious one dish meal. I bake this at 350 for 45 minutes covered and another 10 to 15 minutes to brown the top.

Very tasty! I added elbow macaroni to it. Besides that the only change I made was that I put the chicken broccoli and macaroni in a bowl. I mixed the soup mayo lemon juice and spices in a bowl and then added it to the chicken mixture. I mixed that together and put it in the 9x13 baking dish. Put the cheese on and then the corn flakes. Came out delicious! Will make this again!

Omg the cholesterol and salt! Way too much of both. Use yogurt (family won't notice) low sodium soups add no salt use Mrs. Dash "no salt" instead if you need more seasoning. Reduce lemon slightly reduce the cheese.

Halved the lemon and tripled the curry to bring this more in line with our personal taste and also used yogurt instead of mayo as others reviewers have suggested so even though I changed the recipe a bit I'm giving it five stars because it is a good combination of ingredients no matter the proportions. I will make this again.

OK to good. A little on the salty side. If I make again I will omit the extra salt and pepper. Served over rice which was good. More cheese than I usually like. Broccoli was crisp. I would probably precook for 5 minutes instead of 2-3. I will probably make again and play with the recipe.

Have made with rotisserie Chicken and with regular chicken breasts.... Delicious either way entire family loves it. I used 3 chicken breasts seasoned and sautéed them. I don't like canned cream soups so I use a homemade cream soup substitute which I make in the same pan I sauteed the chicken. I then whisked about 1/2 C of sour cream (instead of Mayo) 2 tsp of curry and a couple of dashes of lemon juice. Add broccoli and cook for a few minutes. Add cheese and chicken and mix well. Pour into greased pan. For the topping I melted 2tbsp of butter and mixed with 1 C of panko breadcrumbs with a dash each of Italian seasoning and curry. Baked covered for about 35min then uncover to brown topping. I keep forgetting to add Parmesan cheese to the topping but next time. I usually serve it with egg noodles yummm

Great recipe and really appreciated suggestion to swap Mayo for Greek yogurt. Took a step further by replacing one can of cream of chicken soup with more yogurt flavored with bouillon. Didn’t have cornflakes so swapped in fried onions! WW points 8 per serving.

Very good! I used a curry spice rub as I ran out of pure curry powder to which I added 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of celery because that s all I had. I didn t have corn flakes so I sprinkled a half of bag of whole wheat herb stuffing mix and 1/2 cup of crushed French fried onions as suggested by other reviewers. I spayed the topping with butter flavor cooking spray and cooked it on high for 3 1/2 hrs in the slow cooker. I ll be putting it on my favorite list of slow cooker recipes.

This is deconstructed chicken divan that I used to make regularly many years ago. This is an easier version and taste pretty much the same. We both enjoyed it but truthfully I thought it was a bit dry. I think I would add some more liquid or sour cream to allow the sauce to spread more evenly on the lower vegetables and chicken. I also added more curry as we really like it that way. Other than that I would recommend you try it. I served it over rice along with a salad.

This is a hit with my family. I've made it a few times now. The only change I make is I omit the lemon juice. This can be a super fast dinner if I buy the bags of pre-chopped broccoli and containers of oven roasted chicken pieces from Costco - pricier that way but a great time saver.

It was pretty good and very easy. I used 1 Tbsp curry powder and 1 Tbsp lemon juice like other's suggested and it wasn't too much of either. I cut down the mayonnaise to 1/2 cup make it less fattening and used 3 large cans of chicken to make it easier. I also used Ritz crackers on top since I didn't have any cereal. It was good left over the next day too. I made some white rice to go with it. I may use more curry powder or lemon juice if I make it again. Very easy to make casserole!

I read the comments and decided to use 1/8 cup of lemon juice instead of 1/4. People said it was too lemony with 1/4. So I cut it in half and it was excellent! This was my first time making it. My husband and I truly loved this. We will definitely be making this again!

I made this today and after reading the reviews I doubled the curry and halved the lemon juice and it was perfect. I also didn't have cornflakes so I ground up Goldfish crackers and saltines added a little melted butter and put that on top. I also made it WeightWatcher friendly and used Helman's Light mayo 99%Fat Free Cream of Chicken soup all breast meat no skin or bone baked chicken fat free shredded cheddar cheese (inside not on top) and Country Crock Light butter. It is truly delicious.
