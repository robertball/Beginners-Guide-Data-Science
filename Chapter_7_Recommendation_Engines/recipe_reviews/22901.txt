To me this did not sound like a very good meal my husband thought, how weird hot dog soup, said he would not like it, however I was really surprised at how good this soup did turn out and my husband loved it too!! It was very easy to prepare, I would highly recommend this recipe.

While the end result was good, adjustment was needed along the way.  1) The main problem was that this was exceedingly bland; I alleviated this by adding bay leaves and pepper.  2) A 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth would have been too much; an 11 1/2 oz. can worked just fine.  3)  Green beans are not the right vegetable for this soup, so I used mixed vegetables.  9 oz. was not enough; I used 16 oz.  I'll make this again because it was simple and the kids ate it, but with the above changes.

Wow, what a good idea! It was great. I replaced the beans with a can of peas though and also a can of corn. we all loved it. It was more of a stoup, and very filling in these hard times.

Great starter recipe!  I made the following changes:  I used my standard soup base/starter (onion and celery sauteed on EVOO with a pinch each of rosemary, thyme, marjoram and a bay leaf, add two chicken bouillon cubes, crushed, one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and two cups boiling water) then added three cups Schwan's mini bow tie pasta and vegetable blend and 1/2 package turkey hot dogs, sliced.  My kids absolutely love it and I love that I can satisfy their never ending demand for hot dogs with something balanced and healthy.  Thanks! :-)

I was a bit skeptical to try this out, but I had all the ingredients on hand, so I gave it a whirl. I also added garlic powder, a bit of oregano, and a dash of basil. Low and behold, this was pretty darn tasty! I especially love the soup base, yum. But I think green beans were the wrong veggie choice for this soup, and I love green beans. Thanks for the recipe, Nancy!

I didn't expect this to be as good as it was but we really liked this. It's good to have variety.  I sauted everything in olive oil instead of margarine. I used frozen mixed veggies instead of just green beans but that's a matter of preference and wouldn't change it drastically. I did take the advise of one review and added thyme & marjorum, as well as garlic which I usually add to everything, and some chopped celery in addition to the mixed veggies (carrots, cauliflower & broccoli).  We'll definitely make this again.

I never thought about using hot dogs in a soup. I didn't have all the same ingredients. I had a frozen mixed bag of veggies, a can of petite diced tomatoes, a beef bouillon cube and a package of wieners. I threw everything in a pot and boiled it up. Added salt and pepper. Very good. My first homemade soup too! Now I'm thinking of more different variations! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

If you love hot dogs, you will LOVE this soup.  if, like me, you hate hot dogs and are looking for a recipe to make you love them - well, keep looking.  This is a VERY hot-doggy soup!  The soup base "sans dogs" is very yummy, though, and I think I will retry this soup using some canned flaked ham.

This received mixed reviews - need to be a green bean lover for this one.  Luckily it did taste better than it looked.  Suggestions were to thicken it up a bit... Maybe will try again and add a little thickening.

Not bad at all. A friend of mine' mother made this all the time. The sound of it turned me off. Until today. I had only a few ingredients in the fridge, I took the leap.  I didn't have a onion or potatoes. But i did have a frozen bag of Potatoes O'Brien in the freezer. It has the onion, and potatoes. Plus green peppers. I just followed the recipe as is, except added what i had. plus the garlic, Marjoram and tyme (salt and pepper to taste.) and it turned out well. I will add that I only eat good qaulity Beef Hotdogs and also added a can of kidney beans to fill up on. Now what was a experiment to have for lunch, is now what's for dinner.  Thanks!

Really easy to make so that's a bonus!  Had a lot of hot dogs in the freezer and it's the end of the month so I decided to make hot dogs.  Saw this recipe and thought I would give it a try.  Only had two potatoes so I used some leftover french fries from the night before.  Instead of green beans I used peas.   Instead of chicken broth I used a bouillon cube (beef, chicken, pork) for a nice rounded out taste.  Lastly, instead of tomato sauce, I used what was left of a jar of spaghetti sauce and a jar of salsa to make 8 oz.  Those alterations might have resulted in a different soup than the original, but it was well received and I could see a child really enjoying it.

I made this recipe previously before, and I made it again today. The first time, I followed the recipe to exact except, I added some italian herb seasoning to the soup. This time I used traditional prego sauce instead of the tomato sauce. I also used more chicken broth and I added some sliced chourice with the hot dogs.

A good, tasty, filling soup that is simple to make and very adaptable.  You can change the vegetables around to suit your taste.  My husband and I both enjoyed this.

Made this couple weeks ago and my husband flipped out thought it was going to be soooo nasty but.... when he got home and smelled the house he actually tried it and loved it! And tonight he says to me, "remember that hot dog soup you made can we have it tomorrow? " and was so happy when I said i would make it. lol

It was time for me to go shopping again so I didn't have many ingrediants to work with. This recipe popped and I thought sure why not. I have 2 kids that love hot dogs. The only thing I changed was I used half a bag of frozen peas and half bag of mixed veggies. Also used vegetable broth. Was very tasty! Watch out! The potatoes hold heat for a long time! We burned our tongues! haha

We had something similar to this growing up.  Our version was: Saute the onion along with a diced green pepper and the cut up hotdogs in a pan until the vegtables softened and the hotdogs got some carmelization.  Then add the can of tomato sauce, a little worcestershire sauce, some garlic powder and some red pepper flakes.  Let it cook for about 20-30 minutes and you are good to go.  Great served with either rice or mashed potatoes and a veggie.

Just like my mom and grandma used to make! Everyone in my husband's family thought I was crazy! This was the only way I would eat hot dogs growing up! We always added corn and peas and I think my grandma added stewed tomatoes but I don't care for them. Super easy meal to feed a houseful!

I had some franks leftover and thought what do I do with these, and allrecipe was the key.  I like other reviews added other veggies lots of pepper and I would give this a good review for quick and easy and when you have other things going on, this hits the spot with a salad and cornbread, Cilantro

Use tomato paste and water instead of tomato sauce and broth...1 can of carrots and peas mixed instead of green beans...no onion or margarine...add sugar to taste...Italian seasoning, salt and pepper and any other spices your family likes..we use extra potatoes and hot dogs too.  This recipe has been in my Italian family for years!

I make hot dog soup quite often and I always use this recipe as the base. I make the following adjustments. I use double the amount of chicken broth and I use peas instead of green beans. I also had in ½ a package of ground chourico and ½ a package of ground linguica so it adds in a sort of spicy flavor.

Good base recipe, but with no spices it would have been bland. Started with onion, carrots and celery. Added garlic and spices (marjoram, fresh rosemary, basil and thyme as well as salt and pepper). Definitely needed two cups of broth and the liquid from the diced tomatoes in order to cook the potatoes. Thanks for the recipe -- my grandmother used to make something similar and I've been looking for a base to build on.
