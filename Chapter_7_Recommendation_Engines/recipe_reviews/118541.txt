Very good base recipe. I customized just a little to suit our tastes. I tripled the recipe (fills a large crock pot 3/4 of the way) and doubled the amount of chiles after that! I also added more spices (chili powder, cayenne, salt, pepper) because we like our food that way! I thickened it up a bit by taking one of the cans of white beans and mashing it, then adding to the mixture. 
This is my first taste of white chili and I have to say that I was very pleased! Filling, healthy and tasty too!

This was perfect for a healthy, low-fat, low sodium meal--I added more water and Penzey's soup base to make it more like a soup, but I will try it as chili also. I used corn scraped off the cob and another can of northern beans in place of the garbanzo beans. I followed the suggestion of TOBSCHOLARLY and mashed the beans of one can to thicken--it worked great. We garnished with shredded cheese, sour cream, and salsa and ate with Tostitos Scoops! Great recipe--I will definitely make it again.

I've never made white chili before, and using this as a base recipe it came out great!  I spiced it up, using a tsp of cumin, and cayenne and chili powder to taste.  I also doubled the green chilies.  Hubby and I like it spicy!  I used chicken broth instead of water and chicken boulion, and bumped it us to 3 cans of beans, smashing one of them before adding.  I followed others suggestions and added some sour cream before serving.  It turned out great!!!

i wanted to save $ so i used dried navy beans soaked overnight. since i used the dried beans i added an extra half c water. i also had to cook everything on high 4 hrs and then low 2 hours. in my experience dried beans wont soften on low in a slow cooker even if they have been soaked overnight. i also doubled ALL of the spices because of the reviews and mashed some of the beans to make it creamy. it turned out great! hubby said this was the best thing i have made in my slow cooker(and i use mine all the time)i cant wait to try this with ground turkey.

Excellent. I did double the green chilies and I also added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies for a little color. I threw my chicken breasts in the slow cooker frozen and then just shredded them before serving. Super tasty topped with a little plain yogurt and chopped cilantro. Thanks! :)

I LOVE this recipe! I have done it different ways - crock-pot, stovetop . . . I usually soak and cook my own white beans (maybe next time I'll use dried garbanzos, too), and I usually double it. I normally cheat and use canned chicken - 4 for a double batch (makes my cats happy, they get to lick the cans clean (= )Great with cornbread . . . Enjoy!

This was a decent base but overall the flavor was lacking. I added chili powder, more cumin, more garlic and a dash of lime juice but it was still lacking something.

I loved the way this turned out!  Has a great flavor and I will definitely make it again. I did stir in 1/4 cup low-fat sour cream 5 minutes before serving to thicken the sauce a bit.  I also recommend topping with a little shredded cheese if you like your tomato-based chili taht way.

Instead of a slow cooker, I sauteed the onion, garlic & chicken in a dutch oven.  I added remaining ingredients and simmered until the cannellini beans started to fall apart.  In lieu of water, I used 32 oz. chicken broth, which I believe added more flavor.  Next time, will add chopped celery and green pepper for additional flavor.

This was too bland and lacking of substance for us.  I will try again using 6 chicken breast, put them straight into the slow cooker, cover with water and cook until they shredd.  I will remove a lot of the 'broth' and set aside in case I need to add some back.  Will add black beans, garbanzo beans, and frozen corn, chipotle, cayenne, and Greek seasoning while following the recipe from this point. Greek seasoning can really add to soups and stews.

This chili left us a little cold. The basic flavor was good, but bland. The comments mainly were "tasty, but missing something". We used Great Northern  and Navy Beans. This barely made a 3 star rating. With more seasonings it could be a 4.

Never made white chili before and this recipe seemed very easy to use as a base. As other reviews have mentioned, this is really just a base that can be doctored to your taste. Added hot mexican chili powder, extra chicken broth, extra cumin and a lot more garlic. The end result was delicious.

I'm giving 5 stars because this recipe is SO healthy in spite of packing some great flavor.  I added some canned stewed tomatoes and sliced jalapenos from a jar; we also topped with cilantro (key!!).  It was fabulous - no need for cheese or sour cream, and the recipe is very heart healthy with the soluble fiber in the canellini and garbanzo beans.  In retrospect what I might do is just add a can of Rotel (tomatoes and green chilies) instead of adding the green chilies and tomatoes separate.

I was not impressed with this. The chicken came out very tough, and there wasn't a lot of flavor despite adding extra spices. I won't make this again.

I only had chicken quarters so I boiled them and shredded the chicken. I then continued the recipe as follows. I sauteed the shredded chicken with onions and garlic and also smashed the northen beans to thicken up the soup. DELICIOUS. It taste very fresh...I made corn bread with mine. When the cornbread ran out i used tortilla chips. Oh and def top with fresh cilantro! GREAT

This was great!  I've never made white chili where I liked it, but who can resist a slow cooker recipe on a rainy day?  I used two cans of white kidney beans, one of which I mashed up slightly with a fork before adding.  I double the garlic, and also added a sprinkling of garlic powder and chili seasoning for more depth of flavor.  Also, instead of using chicken bouillon and water, I simply added a couple cups of good quality chicken stock; less salty and much more flavor!  Served with cornbread muffins, and topped the chili with a little cheese, sour cream, and extra green chilis.  Perfect!

Big hit with the family.  I tripled most of the recipe except the garbanzo bean. Also used real roasted hatch chiles from the Farmer's market.  I loved how the corn added a crispness to the chili. Great flavor! I will definitely make again.

Very Good! Made it for a work party and won 2nd place in a contest. It was the only White Chicken Chili entered). I doubled the quantity & used mexicorn & southwestern corn instead of plain corn which added extra flavor... A do-over for sure.

I'm learning the slow cooker due to a recent change in my schedule & on Halloween I decided I'd try this one.  I substituted Pinto beans as that is what I had on hand I did mash about half a cans worth to thicken as some of the recipes suggested.  I did not cube the chicken breasts either.  This had to cook on low for 12 hours before I would be home.  The chicken shreadded beautifully just by grabbing at it with a fork.  The house smelled amazing & 2 sets of our friends that stopped with trick or treating little ones came in for a bowl!  My boyfriend who is adimit he hates chili, had two bowls of this, &  No leftovers! I will definately make this one again!!!!

A great chili recipe to start with. I followed some suggestions here and added a can of beans that I mashed up. Otherwise, I feel that it would be more like a chicken and bean soup and too thin for a chili. We also like our chili a little more zippy so I was very liberal with some more spices, including doubling the green chiles, adding chili powder and a lot of tabasco sauce as it was cooking. I have made this numerous times and my co-workers loved it a party we recently had. Definitely worth trying & tweaking!

Tastes great! Used 2 cans of northern white beans instead of the garbanzo beans. Also added chili powder and some Adobo for a little more flavor. Serving w/ corn bread, cilantro, and some chopped avocado. very good recipe!

This is a great tasting chili!  I scooped out about 2 cups and using a stick blender, pureed just enough to thicken the broth.  With the added texture difference it made the chili seem heartier.  I have made this chili a few times and always gotten great reviews.  I will contiune to make it.

The recipe, as it is written, is a great base. After reading the reviews I decided to make a few additions of my own; starting with adding into the onions chopped green & red peppers, using chicken stock instead of water, throwing in cayenne & white pepper for a little more kick and then adding corn meal at the very end to thicken & give it some additional flavor.

This isn't something I'd normally make, but I'm glad I tried something new!  Because some reviewers mentioned that it needed "something", I used 1 cup water and 1/2 cup white wine.  That definitely added flavor.  Also, I like my chili on the thicker side, so I added a few tablespoons of dry polenta to thicken it.  Lastly, for those of you with a pressure cooker, this cooked wonderfully in 15 minutes!

This was just great! I used pre-cooked chicken breasts from a roast I'd done earlier in the week, and I substituted the juices from the roast (defatted) for the bouillon and some of the water. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written (doubled for a larger crockpot). Not only was it good as-is, but there's plenty of room for customization. You can make it hotter if you prefer; there wasn't much heat to this. You could add other vegetables, though I didn't think it needed it. I'll make this again and again.

This is hands down the best white chili I have ever tasted!!  We love garlic so I added a few more cloves.  Had chicken broth on hand so used it instead of bouillon!  Tasted great!  Will be making many, many more times!

We loved this chili - my husband told me to add it to his favorite recipes list. I added a chopped green pepper and three chopped carrots. I used white northern beans since that's what I had., I also doubled the water, cumin and bouillon - we like more liquid in our soups. Turned out great!

I am writing this review as I am eating the chili. It is delicious! I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and added some salt, pepper and chili powder. I also mashed up another can of beans and added it to the mix to thicken it up. I totally forgot to buy a can of green chilies but I had some chopped up habenero in the fridge. I only added a little of course. :) But it turned out great!

This was so good, especially for being in the crockpot. I followed the recipie exactly, except I add a two extra bouillon cubes, and also some extra cumin, and some chili powder. Served with sour cream and cheddar cheese on top. So good!

I made this just as recipe stated although I added 3 garlic cloves because we love garlic. We always top our chili with low fat shredded cheddar, low fat sour cream, and sliced avocado. SO GOOD! My 5 year old ate his entire bowl of it. I definitely think without the toppings it would be kinda boring.

I liked this more than I thought I would. Per reviews (that said it was bland), I added heaping spoonfuls of each of the spices. Otherwise, I made exactly as stated, and I would make it again! Pretty awesome for a healthy recipe.

I ended up making this from memory (the power was out, and we needed a meal!) and it got rave reviews from the in-laws. We had it with cornbread muffins and it was great. Changes: a chicken carcass was used to make a broth. I added a small can of green peas, and mexicorn instead of plain corn. I used Penzey's seasoning mix instead of cumin. Thanks Lori for sharing!

I liked it but I didn't love it. I did puree 1/2 a can of beans to make it thicker and it was thick like a chili. I thought it lacked flavor and I did double the cumin and added chili powder. The other thing I did was use a beef cube instead of chicken because it's what I had. I don't know if I will ever make this recipe again.

My son loved it, but said it was too soupy to be called Chili.  I would have crushed a 2nd can of beans, if I had had one.  Husband loved it, but I thought it was too spicy.  Will try again with some changes.

I love making soups b/c they are so versatile and you can experiment and add this and that. I usually don't set out to tweak a recipe, but made a lot of tweaks with this one and we were happy w/the results.  Added some taco seasoning in addition to the cumin called for, added some salsa, used black beans and red kidney beans (all I had).  Yum!

This was ok - I just felt like there were several tastes missing from it. I added a hearty amout of chili power, but that didn't really help. The green chiles were a great idea, but it ended up not being as hearty as other chilis I've made in the past. If I make it again I will try adding brown sugar and possibly some more vegetables.

This was a very nice change from traditional chili. Used 2 cans white kidney beans instead of the garbanzo beans. Added extra seasonings; cumin, chili powder, garlic powder etc. Also thickened the chili with cornstarch at the end and added 1 cup of salsa right at the end of cooking! MMM!!! and healthy too

I doubled this recipe and it still wasn't quite enough for my family.  As was suggested, I pureed some of the beans to thicken it up.  Next time I think I will add some salsa to jazz it up a bit and add more flavor to balance out the cumin.  Overall a very good recipe though!

Very good.  Easy to prepare and versatile.  I added a small head of cauliflower, chopped into florets, to the ingredients listed.  We found the liquid to be more thin than we like, so next time I'll add some instant potato flakes to the broth.

This is a decent base recipe, but like others I found it lacking in spice.  I tried adding more cumin and some cayenne, but it was still pretty bland.  I'm not sure what it was missing, but it definitely needed some more pep.  No arguing with the ease of the crock pot, though.

This recipe was easy!  I used a small can of chicken broth in place of the water and added cayenne pepper for an added kick.  I also added a can of chopped artichoke hearts-YUM! Added a bit of sour creme and shredded sharp and pepper jack cheeses for topping and diced jalapenos!

A bit watery and bland for us as written. Used an immersion blender to get some thickness and a dollop of sour cream for good measure.  Also ramped up the spice-factor with extra cumin, chili powder and whatever other seasonings may have bee in my site.  This brought it up to a 5.

This recipe was very bland.  I doctored it with a lot of salt and pepper and some cheddar cheese and it was much better.  Will try other white chili recipes before making this again.

This was awesome to use as a taco (or burrito) filling.  I omitted the beans and corn so that it was more like carne asada, and put toppings and condiments out on the table so that my family could assemble their tacos however they liked. I will definitely make this again.

My family loves this dinner.  It is so easy to fix and is great with sweet cornbread.

I made this chili for my son's one year birthday party, and it was a big hit!  I used great northern and navy beans instead of garbanzo.  The spiciness was just right for me, but I do tend to prefer bland food.  I will definitely make this again.
