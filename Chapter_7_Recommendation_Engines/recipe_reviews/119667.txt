I put a little of my own spin on this.  I used fresh mozzarella balls instead of sliced mozzarella (same difference, it's just what I had bought at the store the previous day).  I also added 2 or 3 splashes of balsamic vinegar.  Very tasty and refreshing on hot summer days.  You will not be disappointed.

This is the traditional Italian summer salad, Insalata Caprese, in the style of Capri. This is generally made with fresh, vine-ripened Roma tomatoes, but today I had to substitute another type - what's most important is not what kind of tomato you use, but what is the freshest, ripest, reddest available. Also, traditionally fresh mozzarella is used. Concetta's Caprese Salad is authentic in that she does not include balsamic vinegar!

Call it "Tomato Mozzarella Salad" or call it by it's more traditional name "Insalata Caprese" - I call it just plain GOOD! Tomato and basil are a classic combination and when paired with fresh mozzarella you have something so simple and so delicious you could make a meal out of this all by itself! I like to add a bit of sea salt along with fresh cracked black pepper and always use olive oil not veg. oil. If you want to add a bit of pizzaz add a splash of good quality balsamic - perfect served with Italian bread and a nice wine!

Great recipe.  A friend of mine in Germany used to make this all the time.  It's quick, and delicious.  I also would recommend using fresh mozzarella instead of sliced.  I use one 8 oz. ball of mozzarella for every large tomato.  And I also recommend a few splashes of balsamic vinegar.

The whole family agrees this is absolutely delicious! We used part skim mozzarella (so as not to take in all the fat and yet not lose the delicious cheese flavor). I definitely will be making this again REALLY SOON!!!

I made this for dinner this week and it was awesome.  I could not use fresh Basil, it looked aweful at the store, so I had to use dried, then I also made the Italian Butter mixture with Italian Bread so the two together was really good.  I  ended up pouring the Dipping bread sauce over the Salad too  Yummy!!!.  Plus, a freind is giving me fresh basil from her garden so I will make the real thing now.  Thanks for sharing.  Will make again.

A good base and you can change it up with fresh mozzarella and a balsamic reduction drizzled over the top

Great recipe.  I read some of the other reviews and added a dash of balsamic vinegar.  Very pretty and fresh salad on a warm day.  Thanks!

While we loved this, I'm really giving it 4-1/2 stars because we ended up adapting the recipe.  As written, this is lacking something ... I gues we're not traditionalists!  To make it 5 star, we used fresh mozzarella sliced thin (pre-sliced is too thick) and added a splash of balsamic vinegar.  We did make it often enough, that I plan to grow my own basil next year!

This was very good!  As other reviewer's suggested, I added some balsamic vinegar (2 tablespoons).  I chopped the mozzarella and tomatoes into chunks and they marinated nicely.

Loved this. Easy to make. Like others I added Balsamic and onions. I also added bow tie pasta, and used fresh mozerella in a chunk salad like dish (not slices). I stirred in sundried tomato olive oil with the pasta before mixing with tomatoes. Big hit!

I did the recipe exactly and used all fresh ingredients. My hubby gave it 3 stars, my son who eats tomatoes like apples gave it 4.5 and I gave it 2. It was oily, the basil overpowered everything. I will only make it again if my son requests it. Oh, I did add some balsamic vinegar to one to try it and it helped a little.

We enjoyed this recipe, but the taste is totally dependent on how sweet the tomatoes are and the quality of mozzarella.

As listed this is not very good recipe.  With the commonly suggested changes of using fresh mozz and basil, and adding a drizzle of balsamic to the dressing it's a classic and a 5 however.

2 words: FRESH MOZZARELLA. My favorite treat in the world is some heirloom tomatoes (sliced) with fresh mozzarella and basil.  Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Mmmm, tastes like summer.  The Olive Tap sells an amazing Pomegranate Balsamic Vinegar...

I use fresh buffalo mozzarella and sometimes but a pile of marinated roasted red bell peppers in the center, and also use whole basil leaves.  Serve with crustini bread.

Delicious, light, refreshing and so very easy to make!  I used 3 large tomatoes and 2 large, fresh mozzarella balls which I sliced.  Topped with balsamic vinaigrette dressing and fresh lemon basil from the garden, this was just yummy!

I have made this several times for parties.  I use the fresh mozerella like from your sams or costco and slice in about 14" thick.  It is fantastic.

Fabulous flavor combo.  It was an easy way to use up some of my garden tomatoes.

Attractive, flavorful and easy. Tasted better when I used a fresh mozzarella ball (pricier) than when I used the more economical mozzarella log. I also added a bit of balsamic for a little kick in flavor.

Simple recipe, but good. Just right to add to another dish which uses balsamic vinegar like Lamb Chops with Balsamic Reduction"
Complemented each otheralong with some roast potatos

All my dinner guests said this was very good and how pretty it was! (I especially loved the presentation!!) I used fresh mozzarella that I sliced, and upon opening it, I came across a recipe printed on the packaging for tomato mozzarella salad. It used the same ingredients, but with 3 T. Balsamic vinegar and either 1 or 2 teaspoons (can't remember) of dijon mustard!  Interesting, huh? I didn't do that, just added the couple splashes of vinegar like most every one else, but I can't help but wonder how much more flavor would be added with those additions....

We used provolone the first time we made it (didn't have any mozzarella) and I personally thought it was better than when I tried it with the mozzarella.

Excellent!  We loved this.  Made as a side dish with grilled NY strip steak.  Will also try with roasted red peppers. Used fresh mini mozzarella balls and added a couple of dashes of balsamic vinegar.
