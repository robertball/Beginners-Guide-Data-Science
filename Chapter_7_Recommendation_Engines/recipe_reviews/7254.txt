This cake was absolutely YUMMY! The only modifications I used were that I used honey instead of sugar which made for a bit of a stickier cake, but so so good! Remember only half the amount of honey to what the recipe asks for for sugar. I also used 3/4 cup of applesauce and about 1 TBS of oil to make the texture less 'chewy' and used a honey cream cheese frosting on top (8 ounces of cream cheese, 1/3 cup of honey and 1T of vanilla).....DELISH! Will definitely make again!

This is a great low fat recipe, and the cake is very moist.  It is so healthy with the carrots and nuts, too.  However, I wouldn't consider this cake a real dessert because it has a chewy, gummy texture, which is characteristic of recipes that substitute fat with applesauce.  Next time I will substitute 2 tbsp of oil for the apple sauce.  I think you need some fat in this recipe, and 2 tbsp is still low-fat.

This is now my permanent carrot cake recipe.I love carrot cake but hardly ever made it because it was so high in fat with all that oil.Now I can "have my cake and eat it too";and not feel guilty.My dad absolutely loved it;he said it was even better than the Costco carrot cake.(which is amazing because in our house you can't get better than Costco carrot cake.(up until now that is)I will definately be making this again and again;My family asked for seconds and thirds and with a cream cheese icing and sprinkles it makes a great birthday cake.

I have tried this recipe twice, the first time I followed it to the letter… shared it with friends and they all enjoyed it.
I found it to be to moist so the second round I added another ½ cup of flour and doubled up on all the spices. I found that my modification suites my taste buds better then the original receipt…. excellent ether way.

For all you Weight Watcher people, this is a keeper. I was amazed at how good this cake turned out. I only made half a cake to try it out before I made a full one to take to work for my WW co-workers. I can't wait to share it with them!

My whole family liked the carrot cake.  Based on other comments made I cut down on the pineapple juice and it came out fine.  We added cream cheese frosting and it was a big hit.

This is an excellent carrot cake recipe!!!!  I used about 3/4 cup of Splenda instead of sugar and omitted the walnuts and raisins.  I served it with cool whip but it was just as good on its own.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!!

This cake was amazing.  I made it in a glass baking dish and left it in about ten minutes longer than required--it was not soggy at all.  It was perfectly moist and delicious.  If you don't like it too sweet, I'd reduce the sugar a bit--my dad said it was almost too sweet for him.  Used a cream cheese frosting--best carrot cake I've had.

I found this recipe very satisfying.  It is just like its high fat/calorie counterparts.  The taste is quite good.  I wouldn't change a thing.

The applesauce and pineapple keep this cake really moist without the unhealthy addition of a ton of oil. 

Better after it's been refrigerated overnight.

I read all the reviews and decided to give this a try, added 1/4 cup extra whole wheat flour because of the moisture issue. It turned out great!!! I used the FF cream cheese icing recipe, wow you wouldn't know this was a low fat recipe. It's a keeper

This turned out great! Didn't have pineapple, so used coursely pureed apples (microwaved to soften) in addition to the applesauce. Used 3 full eggs instead of 6 whites. added a 1/4 teaspoon salt--all baked good needs a smidgeon of salt for flavor. I used NO additional sugar--just three little packets of Truvia. This was DELICIOUS! Great way to use up apples that keep falling off the tree :)

MMMMMM!  I used 1/2 cup of applesauce and tried it with 1 cup of greek low fat yogurt - SOOOO good and moist!  I made carrot cupcakes since the portions were easier to control and will spray the papers with cooking spray in the future.  This was one great carrot cake and only 1 WW point each!  Now, when we added the frosting.....that was a different story!

It was so dense and barely even rised in the oven at all.  There were too many egg whites, leaving the finished product with a very eggy texture.  It was tasteless, yet left an  aftertaste in your mouth.  Nobody ate it.  I even put frosting on it, but it still was not very good.

This recipie is a great dessert. It turned out better than I expected with some minor substitutions.  I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and omitted the apple sauce ompletely and just used 2 tbsp. of oil.  I also added more rasins than the recipie called for.  Topped off with cream cheese frosting, this is a very moist (not chewy) and light treat. I will definitley make it again!

Im sorry but in my opinion this should not even be called a cake. It was heavy and too moist (which in this case is a bad thing.) I would rather have a full or reduced fat carrot cake and enjoy it than suffer through this. The only thing stopping me from giving it one star is the fact that it is low fat so it has an excuse for being so bad.

Excellent recipe!  I received many compliments on this cake.  Many appreciated that it was so low in fat.  (3 points per piece for those of you on Weight Watchers).  I substituted part of the sugar for Splenda and only used 1/4 cup of nuts and raisins each.  Very moist and tasty, especially with a low fat cream cheese frosting.  I've frozen 2 pieces and will review how those worked out when I defrost and sample them.
THANKS!!!

I made this for my family's Easter dinner and EVERYONE loved it.  Best part was that it is so low in fat!!  I added a low fat cream cheese frosting, decorated with orange-colored frosting for carrots.  A lovely added touch.  I too did not add in the juice from the pineapples, and it was still very moist.

Great flavor, but think I will add more spices next time and some more flour as I found it a little too moist. I reduced the quantity to 6 servings and it made 12 small muffins perfect for snacks and lunches. The muffins only took 18 minutes at 350 to bake so they're ready quick! Even my toddler likes these which makes me happy.

This is a great low calorie way of making Carrot cake, but I have to say I made this the exact way is states and you can tell it's low calorie. I guess I was hoping I wouldnt taste the difference. It's ok for me, but I think I'm sticking to the real deal next time.

I made this into muffins with a dab of cream cheese frosting on the top and I thought it was delicious (yet chewy, but that's okay in a muffin).  I'd make this again.

I understand now the "chewy" aspect that another wrote about. Next time I will take the suggestions of leaving out applesauce and using oil instead. I think this recipe could be a very good one with a bit more tweaking.

I've changed it around a lot and baked it again it was much better, more carrots, more raisins, less sugar, only whole wheat flour. But it is delicious, really moist and dense.

It was dense and moist - I liked the texture - but there was a funny aftertaste.  I think it might be the wheat flour.

I absolutely love this recipe! I've also tried making an apple cake with it instead of carrot cake and that was delicious too. I didn't use pineapple juice or sugar but instead added in about 1/4 cup of honey and 1 1/4 cup of applesauce and 3/4 cup of skim milk to make up for the absence of the pineapple juice.

this is SO tasty and (dare i say), healthier than your average Carrot Cake!  I made it for an alternative dessert at a family Easter gathering and it was gone before any of the other desserts!  I highly recommend!

This is the BEST!  I did not have the white flour, so only wheat flour was used.  I did not use the cloves either.  It was just sweet enough!

This was so good! I only made a few changes:  added 1 tbs oil, 1 cup of sugar and doubled the nutmeg and cloves. I also frosted it with a low fat cream chesse frosting. I will definitely be making this again.

I did not care for this recipe at all. It does leave an aftertaste in your mouth, as other reviewers stated. I believe that came from the cloves. I expected that it would not have the taste/ texture of a higher fat carrot cake, and it did have a somewhat "chewy" texture. I could have dealt with that, if the taste had been better. Maybe leaving the cloves out would help, if you wanted to try and tweak the recipe a bit. It just didn't suit my personal taste.

Very moist and delicious. Omitted the raisins simply because I don't like them. Added nonfat cool whip for icing.

This was pretty good for what it was. I did substitute the applesauce for 2T oil. Instead of 6 fresh egg whites, I approximated that with a carton of liquid egg whites. I cut the sugar by about 2T.

Texture is a little sticky, but the cake did rise. It definitely needs frosting or ice cream or whip cream.

I'd make it again, but it didn't blow me away. The carrot cakes I love are way more fattenting, probably b/c they have lots of oil, causing a flakier texture.

Glad I tried this, and I would recommend it. Be sure you read some more reviews before embarking on your own so you know what to expect/what to try.

I thought for being low fat, this was very delicious. Other reviews were right, it was dense and moist, but I thought that was the best part about it :) My husband is not a big cake eater(he always wants pie for his birthday), so imagine my surprise when I actually saw him going back for another slice. My kids, however did not like this.

Simply delicious!  I loved this recipe, and so did everyone else! Even my husband who does not usually eat low-fat foods.  I tried the regular version of carrot cake, and this may even be BETTER than the regular, more calorie version.  :-)  I am glad I found a low-fat recipe, without compromising the taste.  (I did add frosting, tho it would have been dee-lish even without it)

This is an excellent low-fat carrot cake recipe.  It was a little too moist for me, but I didn't get any complaints.  I added a 1/2 tsp. of salt, 1 Tbsp. wheat germ, fresh pineapple instead of canned and also some coconut.  It was very tasty.  I definitely couldn't tell it was low-fat.

I was very impressed with this recipe.  Carrot Cake is my favorite and I thought there was no way that it could still taste good and be low fat.  A wonderful recipe for people that are watching their weight and have a sweet tooth!  I made this and my mother loved it, She can't stop eating it!  I omitted the walnuts to make it fat-free and it is wonderful.

I really loved the taste of this recipe, and it was great with cream cheese icing!
However, I found that the cake was soggy after I got it out of the oven, and had
to use a lot of paper towel to mop it up. In future I'll put in less pineapple juice!

I am not usually negative about recipes, but this cake did not taste like carrot cake-more like pineapple and cinnamon. Family did NOT eat their small portions. I followed the recipe exactly and am in wonderment about the many glowing reviews. The cake did LOOK appetizing.

I did not like this carrot cake. It has too much cinnamon. I think you need to reduce it. It was soggy. I even tried to cook it longer, but it was still soggy. Maybe next time I will reduce the liquid. I think you need to drain the liquid from the pineapple can.

I liked the looks of this recipe due to the ingredients being healthier.  I was somewhat skeptical after reading other reviews about it being chewy.  Mine was not chewy, just VERY dense like a very moist pumpkin bread.  It did not rise much.  Don't get me wrong, it was still VERY good, it just was not light and fluffy by any means.

This was good, nice and moist.  I did add some coconut so it was not as low fat as it could have been. :)  Nice, different cooking technique to assemble it - it works.  Of course I could have also left the full fat and butter cream cheese icing off of it as well :)  But it was very impressive!

I accidentally forgot the pineapple. Whoops! That's okay, it was still delicious. I added some cream cheese frosting, and although I had to check my temperature after I came to this decision, I decided I didn't like it with the frosting! I ended up scraping it all off. I think next time I will make it less like a cake and more like a bar. Halve the recipe, leave the pineapple out again, use all whole wheat flour, leave out the sugar and sub a little stevia, and this would make a tasty breakfast fast!

Made this cake yesterday and gave it 3 stars because we felt it wasn't sweet enough and was very dense as a cake. Tasted more as a low fat carrot bread than a cake.

This is a great carrot cake recipe, period.  Next time I will use all whole wheat flour since half wasn't even noticeable.  I served mine with light whipped cream since cream cheese frosting would be gilding the lily.  It also makes a great breakfast, too!

This cake is incredibly healthy - low in fat with whole wheat, fruit, vegetables, and nuts.  It tastes really good but there is a problem with the moisture content - its too moist.  If someone finds the best way to correct that please post the modification.  Its a diamond in the rough.

All I can say is excellent!  As good as a full fat carrot cake, actually liked it even better!  Used a lowfat cream cheese frosting making it extra delicious!  Only lasted 2 days!

I left out the nuts and raisins because my husband doesn’t like them. I noticed with using the juice in the can of pineapples, that the milk isn’t necessary. I’ve made it with and without the milk and it it’s delicious, light and moist both ways.  I used a Greek yogurt, lite cool whip, and sugar free cheesecake jello pudding mix and Splenda for the icing. It was AMAZING!

I kind threw the idea of low fat out the window.  I substituted 3 whole eggs for the egg whites and whole milk for the skim milk.  Best dang carrot cake I've ever had.  It stays moist when storing, too.  I think it's all in the spices.  So glad I made it!

Not bad. It tastes more like a spice cake than carrot cake. I tend to agree with the reviewer who said those who complained the cake did not bake in the recommended time probably used a bigger can of pineapple than was called for by the recipe. My cake baked in under the recommended time but my oven bakes hot. I used all white wheat flour and it was just fine. It did taste better the second day. Just be sure to use a 6 oz. can of pineapple.

Followed recipe exactly and was perfect!  For clarity, no need to whip egg whites to soft peaks, just frothy.  I topped with whipped cream cheese frosting (heavy cream/cream cheese/sugar/vanilla recipe on this site) and it was delicious. People were clamoring for seconds and recipe.

My aunt and friend especially loved this recipe. I used oil instead of apple sauce based on the conversion provided in other reviews. I also tried the apple sauce version but haven't quite mastered it yet. But the first time I made this, it came out perfect. Other times I tend to overbake and it because a bit dry. It gets better in the fridge after a couple of days said my friend whom I gave some of this cake to. :)

Fabulous cake--everyone wanted the recipe!  I made exactly to the recipe and suspect  those who said it was too moist didn't pay attention to the label on the pineapple.  I almost used a regular sized can by mistake, but the 8 oz is the small one.  I made 12 muffins and one 9x9 square cake.  Also, I only made half the cream cheese icing recipe from AllRecipes and it was adequate.  (The rich icing offsets the calorie-saving cake, so I spread it thin--just a smear on the cupcakes!)  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

I only gave it four stars because it is what it is, a much lighter version of the classic, and hugely fattening, Carrot Cake! But I made it for company but didn't want to be left with all the rest and be tempted to eat and eat it. The only change I made as to put in a hole cup of toasted pecans and it was a lovely change, made a good nuttiness to the cake. I topped it with classic cream cheese frosting, and tried to put it on a bit thinner than I really like too! But as one reviewer stated it is way too moist!!!

I made this yesterday. I changed 6  egg whites to 3 whole eggs, and omitted the raisins. It was really tasty, and was done at about 38min. Everyone who ate it said it was delicious. I tried to replicate the frosting in the picture, and made a traditional cream cheese frosting (cream cheese, butter, vanilla, powdered sugar) but I realized that was not what I wanted. The frosting I really wanted (what it looks like in the picture) was buttercream. Next time I'll try that. The best part about this cake is that it calls for no oil. Oh and I cut down the sugar to 1 cup. That was plenty, especially if you're going to frost it. If you don't, its much lower cal, and very delicious!

I made this last night.  Very moist I had to sub a few ingredients because I was not going to run to the store.
Used Wheat flour 2 C, 2T Coconut Oil - instead of applesauce.
