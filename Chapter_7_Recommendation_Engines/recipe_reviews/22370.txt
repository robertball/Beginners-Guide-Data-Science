I made this for a Christmas event but didn't care for the strawberries in it, and the texture of the cranberry skins was unpleasant. I had made another red gelatin salad which was similar but much better: Water reduced to 1 3/4 cup, raspberry gelatin instead of strawberry, an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple with juice instead of frozen strawberries, jellied cranberry sauce instead of whole, same amount of chopped pecans, and add 3/4 cup orange juice and 1 T. lemon juice.

Okay, this salad tastes AMAZING, but I had some serious issues with the appearance...first of all, I chilled the mold for 6-8 hours as stated, but when I turned the thing out onto a serving platter, it was too liquid to keep the pretty shape from the mold. The only change I made was to use the jellied cranberry sauce instead of whole berry. The topping was very tasty, but I found it to be lumpy...I would suggest beating the cream cheese with the sugar and lemon juice until fluffy, and then folding in the sour cream, I will do this next time I make this, and I will also put the jello part in a bowl instead of a mold.

In my family there has been a jellied cranberry salad with walnuts and dates for years, but this Thanksgiving I decided to try this and we all enjoyed it, I liked the strawberries in it.  I made half with and half without nuts (the children).

This got rave reviews last year and I was just asked to bring it to Thanksgiving again, however, I did use jellied cranberry sauce, raspberry jello, and 8 oz crushed pineapple like a previous reviewer suggested.  Thanks so much for the tip!!

I have one thing to say about this recipe, DELICIOUS! It was a hit at our Thanksgiving table. I already have a request to bring to family Christmas party.

This was very good, even better the secnd day.  However, mine didn't set as well as I would have liked, so would probably decrease the water a little bit the next time to see.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year - wonderful!  I poured half the jello mixture into a clear salad bowl and let it set in the refrigerator.  Mixed the topping and spread it over the set jello in the bowl, then  added the top layer of jello mixture and let it set.  Beautiful AND delicious!

I, too, had trouble with this recipe not setting solidly enough for a mold.  I would reduce some of the liquid.  Also, before adding the whole cranberry sauce, I would mix it well in another bowl so it's easier to mix in with the jello and not so lumpy.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my mom liked it so much she asked me to make it for Christmas.  I made it as directed and it was outstanding.  The cream that you put on top was so tasty I could have eaten it out of the bowl by itself.  I will definitely be making it again.

Makes a beautiful, decorative salad when prepared in a mold and everyone who tried it raved over it, even the ones who didn't use the topping.  I will definitely make this again for the holiday meals!
