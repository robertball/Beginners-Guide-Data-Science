I like to throw it in the crock pot, sometime a cinnamon stick or a tsp (not with the sherry) actually I useually don't have sherry on hand so I add a little bit of brown sugar, peaches, just what ever. We eat in on bread pudding, over vanilla ice cream, a little cup by itself, over french toast. I just like that I can sneak in a lot of fiber with the appricots and prunes (my kids would never eat prunes alone)

Perfect!  My grandmother used to make a version of this every year for Christmas breakfast. I've been looking for a similar recipe for a while now. This is it.  It's a favorite of mine and has been for a long time.   Learn from my mistake though: I was doubling this recipe (as I often do), and decided that I would use one can of cherry pie filling as the recipe calls for, and one can of just plain bing cherries for tartness. Not a good idea. It was a little too tart that way.  So, follow this one closely.

Interesting.  Followed recipe exactly. Spooned the warm mix over slices of pound cake and topped with whipped cream.  Pretty good.  I don't think I'd eat it by itself as a side dish though.

This is incredible! I took it to a luncheon for my girlfriends, and they all raved about it. I used sugar free pie filling, but it had just the right amount of sweetness.

This is very good. I made it to top my oatmeal in the morning and it was tasty. My parents loved it all on it's own. I omitted the sherry and didn't miss it. Next time I might omit the nuts too.

It tastes great but the color was mostly brown except for the apricots. I used cherries that were not dyed so their color didn't stand out.  I like it with unsweetened yogurt. 

I cut the apricots and prunes into 3 strips to allow for more of a mix in a bit, used cream sherry that I had on hand, and since it is such a sweet dish, used Morello  cherries in light juice instead of pie cherries and since I had that juice I omitted the water. I would not omit the almonds as they complement the sherry.

Perfect!  I needed a simple warm fruit dessert.  This will be one of my new favorites.  Thanks!
