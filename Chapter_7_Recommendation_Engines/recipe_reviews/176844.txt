I sprinkle this on the coffee grounds in my coffee maker before pushing the start button!  Gives the coffee a unique flavor!

Wonderful! Thank you for posting the recipe. I used powdered clove instead of whole and used ground pepper. I use this spice in most of my Oriental cooking.

The Szechuan pepper can be a little hard to find, so when you do, make a big batch of this and toss it on everything from grilled pork, chicken or shrimp to popcorn.  Very good.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.
