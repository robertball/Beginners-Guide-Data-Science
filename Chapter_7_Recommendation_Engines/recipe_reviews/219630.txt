Hopefully the previous poor reviews won't keep folks away from trying this recipe.  Mine turned out wonderfully!  It does take some time to bake all the cookies, but then just have the kids or grandkids match sizes together.  The filling was a cinch...just make sure you don't start it at high right away or you'll have milk flying everywhere!  You'll notice it's runny in the beginning but as it mixes, just speed it up and after a few minutes it turns into a beautiful white fluff!!!  I've grown up around Whoopie Pies and Shoofly pie, living here in the PA Dutch area, and  I'm very picky, and this recipe ranks up there with Mom's whoopie pie recipe.  I had always wanted to try a filling made with marshmallow creme.  I skipped the wrapping and freezing part, as these will all be eaten this week.

Thanks Teresa!  Until finding your recipe, I didn't know whoopie pies were even made in Maine.  Thought only us in PA ate them!

I followed the recipe exactly and the frosting was sooo runny and the white sugar made the frosting very grainy.

YUM! reminds me of my childhood  With the filling as the last reviewer stated you really need to pay attention to texture and thickness as you are whipping it.

The cake is one of the best I've found although I believe the 2 tablespoons extra of cocoa is too much (found it bitter).  The 1/2 cup was sufficient. I use my Moms cream filling but love the lightness of the cake in this recipe.

Batter was very runny and had to add extra flour and the frosting didn’t come out at all. I had to add 1 1/2 bags of confectionary sugar to get it to thicken. They were still very tasty! I wouldn’t make this recipe again. I’ll continue looking...

I added extra baking powder (double what it called for) to really set the chocolate notes.

I am very torn on how to rate this recipe because we really enjoyed the cake part of this whoopie pie, but, the filling was a disast.   The cake had a nice chocolate flavor and was very moist which was nice because a lot of whoopie pies come out dry. They didn't rise very much, but, they were very good and I would make them again.  Make sure you butter your pan well or use parchment paper because they do stick.  The frosting was a mess!  It was very runny.  I followed the directions exactly and even took the suggestion of other reviewers to beat longer because it would thicken.  I beat the filling for ten minutes and it never thickened.  I even put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and it still stayed runny.   I also thought the use of white sugar left a terrible grainy texture that did not go away.   I ended up throwing out the filling and using a marshmallow filling from a different recipe.   The cake part I would easily give a 4, but, the frosting would be a zero.

made them today they kept sticking to my no stick pan and I had to cut the time to 5 mins in order for them to come off the pan easier and my filling came out grainy from the sugar. They still came out good now to hear from my coworkers monday to see what they think
