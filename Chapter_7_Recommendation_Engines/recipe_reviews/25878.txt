If you haven't tried this yet, you are missing out! I used canned crabmeat instead of fresh, and my family begs for this dish! We have also made it with tilapia instead of flounder, and it tastes awesome, too. Thanks for a great recipe that has become a family favorite!

This was outstanding!  The fish filets I had were too small to roll though so I just put the fish in the bottom of the baking dish, covered it with the stuffing and then sauce and cheese.  I baked it the same way directed and it came out perfect.  Even my kids loved it!

I gave this recipe to my sister. We were having about 12 people over for lunch. This was a huge hit. We almost ran out and we made twice as much as we needed. It has only been 3 days since we had this and people have asked us for the recipe. One friend has family over and was describing it for them and wants to make it. There was alot of the soup left over but we used it to spoon over some baked chicken and it tasted great! Also, we used tilipa instead of flounder, use a toothpick to hold your fish together if you're having problems keeping it together.

This was good. Next time I would halve the cream of mushroom soup mixture and add some cubed bread to the shrimp crab mix so its easier to roll. I would also sub a fresh parm asiago mix for the cheddar as it just didn't quite fit.

This was a great recipe! The store I was at didn't have Flounder so we used Tilapia and it was great. Also used imitation crab meat, but I think it would have been tasier with canned crab meat (although more expensive).

i made this recipe with a few alterations.  i used a cornbread stuffing mix in addition to the listed ingredients and used a bottled alfredo sauce instead of cream of mushroom soup.

try this recipe with the cornbread stuffing and alfredo sauce.  it's delicious.

This was quick and easy!The only thing I did different was I did not wrap the fish. I just laid the shrimp and crab mixture on top. I also did not use cheese. I was trying to keep it low fat. Everyone in the family was pleased. I will make again!

I think this is my new favorite way to make flounder.  I didn't attempt to roll the fish -- instead I made "sandwiches."  This method is easy, there is no mess and the fish looks appetizing. I only used one can of soup since others said it made too much sauce using two cans.  There was plenty of sauce to spoon over the fish and rice.  I forgot to add the cheddar but we didn't miss it.  This was delicious and worthy of a special occasion.

I really love the crab-stuffed flounder from Trader Joe's, so I thought I'd try my hand at making them at home. I really don't mind taking the time and making the effort to prepare a meal if the end result is worth it, but I don't think this was the case here. Sure they were tasty, but they were time-consuming and messy to make, the final result wasn't very attractive, and they weren't that much better tasting than the ones I buy (and certainly a lot more expensive). I also agree that there is too much sauce - half a can of cream of 'shroom would be fine, imo. Thanks though!

I followed the recipe up to the sauce.  The flavors of the sauce, in my opinion, would overwhelm the delicate flavor of the stuffing and fillets, which are excellent.  I placed the rolled fillets in a baking dish with 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup water.  I sprinkled paprika and parsley over all, covered the dish with foil and baked for 30 minutes at 375, removed the foil and baked for additional 5-7 minutes.  We will have these again!  Thank you, Linda

The stuffing was great, but the mushroom soup and the cheddar did not seem to go. I also agree that the soup is too much, it smothers the fish when I felt a lighter zesty sauce would have fit better.

I love fresh seafood. This was just toooooo much for me. Fresh flounder stands on it's own. Would probably be good on a firmer fleshed fish.

I loved this recipe and my husband, who isn't that fond of fish, raved about it.  I used half the soup and fresh shrimp I chopped in smaller pieces.  I didn't have a problem rolling as some of the other reviewers stated but had filling left over that I threw on top.  The only change I would make next time is omit the cheese; there are so many good flavors going on that the cheese isn't necessary.  This one is a keeper.

We bought a live fluke and cut the filets ourselves. Used canned crab meat but fresh tiger shrimp. Weren't able to roll the filets once stuffed so baked flat with extra chicken broth/mushroom soup mix. Served with broccolini and jasmine rice. Absolutely delicious!

Very good recipe!! Quite tasty and easy to make !!
Only changes were that I did not use mushrooms or cream of mushroom soup and used Tilapia and cream of potato instead. The wife loved it. :o)

This was delicious!  I also used tilapia and did not even attempt to roll it up.  The sauce did cook off of the fish and shrimp/crab mixture, but I just plated it and spooned the sauce over the top.  I just went on a low carb diet and have been looking for  low carb comfort food.  This is definitely it!

Fantastic! I used a casserole dish, spread the fillets on the bottom, then topped with shrimp mix and cheese.  Easy and very tasty. Served with brown basmati rice and fresh tomatoes.

I thought it was pretty good but my boys weren't crazy about it (the sauce on the flounder) and they are generally good eaters.  I'm going to go ahead and remove from my recipe box since they wouldn't want me to fix it again.

I did a variation.  I used talapia instead of flounder and just layed the fillets out in the pan.  Instead of paprika, I put in a teaspoon of Emeril's Bayou Essence.  I put everything on top of the fish and put the cheese on, then sprinkled more of the Bayou Essence over the top.  Then baked as directed.  MUCH more flavor this way.

I'd again for those who enjoy a light, white fish. The flavor was good-I'll not use as much soup next time. My husband did not care for it.

I used fresh mushrooms so sauteed them first. Next time I will sprinkle the cheese and broil for the last 5 minutes so it doesn't just melt into the mixture and dissappear. Also always serve any fish with a lemon wedge.

This stuffed fish recipe is an instant family favorite! 
I made the sauce a little thicker by omitting the chicken stock. I got the full stuffing flavour by reducing the amount of bread crumbs. This one will be on the family menu a lot!

I myself am not a seafood eater. However, i made this dinner for my family for my father's birthday, and EVERYONE said it was hit! oddly enough, flounder is VERY hard to come by, so i Googled flounder alternatives, and Cod came up as one of four because obviously orange roughy is hard to come by too. A nice twist i did instead of rolling it was stuffing the fish with the mixture, and then continuing with the directions. all the ingredients were perfect according to them,  nothing needed to be changed. for a side I did seasoned greenbeans mixed with potatoes. Per them, it will be a new staple. Very easy to make. maybe buy crab already the shell to make life easier, and i used fresh cooked shrimp instead of the suggested canned shrimp lol

Didn't have any shrimp, so I doubled the crabmeat. This was excellent.

My husband loved this! The fish was moist and flavorable. Froze extra sauce for a second meal.

I was fortunate that my husband is a fisherman and came home with a Blue Crab, a Flounder and fresh Shrimp. So I found this quick and easy recipe which is definitely a keeper! It was even easier because I didn't wrap the fish. I just laid the stuffing mixture on top. It was loved by all and I will make it again!

I liked the filling but thought the sauce was a bit too salty.  I may try it again with just the melted cheese and no sauce.
