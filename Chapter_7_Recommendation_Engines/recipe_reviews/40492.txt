i made these to freeze and rewarm for breakfasts. (skipped baking) i just put everything on the inside and froze them individually and microwave for a few minutes when ready to eat. they have an interesting and addictive flavor. i added a few jalapenos and salt for extra flavor/spice. i crave these. at first didnt know if they'd be good but they are rewarmed from the freezer and probably if you bake them they'll be good too.

I give this a 3, my husband gives it a 4, my 18-month old, if he could, would  give it a 1, but he doesn't like eggs.  It lacked flavor for me.  However, I didn't measure the salt and didn't add the hot sauce.  Maybe that's why.  While it didn't taste bad it was kind of odd tasting, nonetheless.  I doubt I'll make this again without  modifications.  Maybe a can of green chilies would be good.

We really liked this recipe.  I cut it in half for "two".  Will add more green onions next time.  It was a nice change from the standard breakfast
