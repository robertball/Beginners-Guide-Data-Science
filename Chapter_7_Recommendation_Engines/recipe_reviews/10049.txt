This is a very good recipe and I have been using it for a while. The only thing I changed was to add some vanilla. I think the vanilla gives it a fuller flavour. These are a favorite in my house!

These were wonderful!  I did add the vanilla as another person suggested and I was glad I did.  My only wish is I could put more "stuff" in them.  But since they rise quite high while baking, it is important not to over-fill them, or you will end up with a mess!  TIP:  If you are starting off with frozen shells, pop them in the oven for 5 minutes UNFILLED to ensure they will be fully cooked when the filling is.

I have been using a recipe given to me by a professional baker for over 20 years.  This one is the only recipe to beat mine.  Thanks so much.

VERY YUMMMMMMY! The only thing I do different is I sprinkle the raisins and nuts on the bottom of every shell first (to make every one even) then spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling in each shell. They won't over flow or make a mess with that measurement. Works out perfect.

AWESOME!!!!!!I used all NUTS instead of Raisins -- 1/2 cup walnuts and 1 1/4 CUP of PECANS. Recipe could probably make about 50 2  inch tarts.  I also omitted one egg yolK AND used 2%milk instead of cream.  This probably shaved about 9 grams of fat off of this recipe.

I was making tarts tonight and found out that I was missing corn syrup so I went in search of a recipe.  Found this one and had to modify it for what I had on hand (plain 0% yogurt for the cream) and 1/2c brown sugar 1/2c splenda.  I also put raisins, almonds and coconut in the shells.  Much to my surprise these turned out great.  And I used real butter so they have a great buttery taste.  thanks!

These were good but not the best I've ever had (or made).  I've lost my old recipe and this one looked similar.  It's almost as good but not quite.  Next time, I think I'd use either pecans or raisings but not both.  And I had to cook these for 15-20 minutes longer than the recipe indicated.

I found these tarts very "dry"- I guess I like mine with a little less raisins/nuts and more butter and sugar mixture.  I also had to bake them for 35-40 min at 325 and were not at all overdone.

Excellent recipe, simple, quick, love the fact that you can keep this filling in the fridge for up to two weeks! Bake time and temperature was pretty much bang on.  Thanks, Barbara for the terrific recipe.

These are terrific because they have a custard filling which is so much better than the syrupy, messy kind.

Very good! I baked these for my dad who is very picky and doesn't like change! He always makes butter tarts from his mom's recipe (which is also very good), but I wanted to try another recipe. While I was baking them, I even told my husband "DON'T tell my dad that I used another recipe!" But he loved them!  I omitted the walnuts because my dad probably would have disowned me if I made them with any kind of nuts :) Very good. Easy to make if you use store-bought tart shells. Next time I will use my dad's recipe to use the tart shells, and this recipe to use the filling.

Great tarts, and very simple! I didn't have raisins and I'm allergic to nuts, so they were plain (but that's how I like them best anyways). Overall, really tasty and super quick to make. My fella loved these, said they were perfect. Would definitely make these again.

I'd never made butter tarts before and thought they'd be difficult - these were SO easy and turned out great. As other reviewers mentioned, don't over fill as they rise quite a bit. I also added vanilla to the recipe (great idea), used homo milk instead of cream and used pecans and coconut in my filling.  Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe!

Very nice recipe.  I only used sultanas and pecans and the individual tarts were lovely and moist and not too sickly like some recipes.  Trying tonight without the nuts.  Be warned that they do burn easily so you might need to turn the heat down a bit.

Awesome!!  Super easy to make and they turned out great.  I did also add some vanilla to the mix and I used store bought tart shells.  I took someone else's advice and cooked them for 5 minutes on their own, then filled them and cooked for the 20 - 25 mins per the recipe.  They were awesome (were because they're all gone!)

This is the best butter tart recipe ever!! We like our butter tarts plain so I don't add any nuts or raisins, just a little vanilla. I make the shells from scratch and this recipe makes 12 big (muffin pan sized) butter tarts without nuts/raisins. YUM!

I just had to thank Barbara for sharing this fantastic recipe!  I'm a Canadian living in Australia, and from time to time, I get a craving for sweets from home. I followed this recipe exactly, and not only was it easy to make, it tasted just as good as, if not better, than the bakeries in Toronto.  Thanks again for sharing.

Here is a summary of all the best tips:
1. If using frozen shells put them in the oven for a few minutes while preparing your filling.
2. Fill shells with nuts and raisins first.  Use 1 1/4 c each raisins and nuts.
3. Add 1 tsp vanilla to sauce mixture.
4. Pour  1 Tbsp sauce over nuts and raisins
5. Bake at 310 for 25 min

Wonderful recipe.  I too added a splash of vanilla to batter and also added pinch of salt... Mixed up the batter by using half golden raisins and half currents .... Very nice presentation when dusted with confectionary sugar ... Thank you for sharing this recipe!

To prevent the overflow, lower your oven temp to 305. Cook the same time as indicated but you're able to fill to 3/4 full with out the lava flow. 
I add a tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt. 
Good recipe.  I've made several times and they disappear fast.

I changed from walnuts to pecans, and added 2 cups of those and only one cup of raisins ,,,,since my family is not crazy about raisins, and they were awesome!!

These turned out great!  I filled them at 3/4 and no overflow, just perfectly filled tarts.  They also set up perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe Barb

Great and easy.  I'm not a nut fan so I did not add those but it was still very good.  I agree to watch the times....my oven cooks uneven, so I really had to watch some of these.

I have never made them without corn syrup so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  These were Incredibly sweet and the tops cracked and caved in.  I also had to bake them an additional 15 minutes.  Won't make them again. The picture is also misleading, it is not the picture of this buttertart with cream.  It's of one with syrup

Made a half recipe today to get 6 full sized tarts.  I eliminated the nuts as I don't care for them in Butter Tarts. While they were baking, the filling rose to the top, then settled back after cooling to crater shaped.  They took more like 35 mins to cook as opposed to the 20-25 indicated.
This isn't a recipe I'd likely use again - the sugar amount is quite high - 1/8 c. per tart is a lot of sugar.

Excellent recipe! Hubby doesn't like anything in his butter tarts, so I omitted the nuts and raisins. Wonderful, not dry, or runny, just right. I used the Boiling water pastry recipe on here and it works well too.

Good basic recipe.  For this many tarts, I add 1/4 cup corn syrup, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/8 tsp salt to the batter.  I do not add the nuts and currants to the batter, I put them in the shell evenly ahead of time so every one is the same.

These were delicious!! Like another reviewer, i added vanilla and put walnuts and raisins in tart shells before the sauce. Also only used 1/2 cup raisins as the walnuts and raisins filled the tarts halfway. I filled the tarts with the sauce to the rim of the tart and had no problems. This recipe is a keeper!! By the way, not dry at all but maybe that was because i only used 1/4 of the raisins!!  Julie

I was looking for a recipe for butter tarts since i lost mine, then i came upon yours. It's the same. I couldn't remember how much cream to put in.  Instead of putting in some raisins my family enjoys them with chocolate chips and pecans. I just finish a batch and i put in some reese's pieces. What a hit. Thank-you for the recipe.

Very good recipe, but my only disappointment was that the filling was so shallow once it cooled... it barely filled the cup, but I watched as they baked and they rose quite high in the oven, so you can't fill them higher than halfway. The taste was great though!

I found this recipe unbearably sweet.  I would reduce the brown sugar by 1/2 cup.  My frozen tart shells which were thawed did not cook even though I baked at 325 for 30 mins.  Next time I will reduce sugar and bake longer or at higher temp!

Used pecans instead of walnuts or raisins. Place the pecans in the tart shells and mixed up the butter,eggs,sugar and cream in bowl and poured over pecans. Baked 22 min in a gas stove and they were a HUGE hit with my family. Really easy recipe with wonderful out come.

Awesome!! I've made this twice nw because my mom LOVES them - usually my dad is the tart fanatic but she was crazy about this recipe. Following changes were made: added a dash of vanilla, 3/4 cup pecans in half the mixture and 3/4 cup raisins in the other half rather than raisins/other nuts. Also, I only had to bake for 15-17 minutes. Thank for the fabulous recipe - it is soooo easy.

These were really really good! This was the first time I ever made butter tarts by myself. I was scared to try making them because I thought it would be really hard, but I found this recipe and it's super duper easy and it tastes really good! There was one batch that I didn't have in the oven long enough I guess even though the other pan was in a shorter time and turned out perfect. I didn't have any cream so I substituted it with just whole milk. Maybe that was the problem. :)

Super!  I used vanilla caramel coffee cream and currants instead of raisins and 1/2 C of coconut and 1/2 walnuts cause that is what I could scrounge up and they turned out great!  I made Oil pie crust and made both mini tarts and full size tarts.  Thanks for this recipe!

Excellent recipe! I used dark raisins and demura brown sugar(dark). 
The second time I made these I made pie pastry(2 crust recipe) and cut 5.5 inch round to fill 20 full size muffin tins. The butter tart batter fit all 20 perfectly! Thank you sooo much!

I used Butter Pecan coffee creamer instead of cream. I also pre baked my tart shells for 5 minutes before adding the filling. These tarts are hands down my favorite.

This is very similar to an old family recipe that I lost. The only changes I made were the addition of pecan pieces (for a mixture of walnut, pecan & raisins) & 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Used pre-made sweetened tart shells. A traditional family holiday treat, came out marvellous as always!!

Very nice recipe but I like to make things my way so I use currants and soak them in Baileys Irish cream. This adds a nice boozy flavor with a kick. You could soak raisins or currants in your favorite bourbon, rum or whiskey etc. to get your own favorite flavor.

For starters I pre baked the shells because the last time I tried this recipe it did not turn out at all. The shells were undone and the filling was burning. I also added only walnuts and to the bottom of each shell to get even distributions. I like the flavour of the filling but found that filling each shell half way left me with too much pastry with each bite. I understand why you can only fill half way - it rises. I might try just the filling with no nuts next time to get the full filling taste.

This is my standard recipe for butter tarts. I make them for our bingo concession, and I rarely have leftovers.
The only change I make is to omit the nuts, due to patrons' allergies - I don't usually bake nuts into anything.

I doubled the recipe and despite having nutmeg in amongst my spices, I used a pumpkin pie spice as a replacement as the nutmeg was located after the dough had been completed.  I refrigerated in over night in 2 separate flattened batches which allowed me to roll out and work with one while the other stayed cool.  Living in a townhome, I have a small galley kitchen which can reach warm temperatures when the oven is left on for a perpetual day of baking.  Thus, it was necessary to keep half of this dough cool as it was rather sticky whence first mixed. I feel it's important to mention that depending on your oven, you may want to consider rotating your baking sheets 1/2 way through if you are using more than one rack. Otherwise, excellent outcome for this recipe. The dough ot too sweet, more focused on the traditional spice of Ginger Bread rather than a Ginger 'Snap' which is what I was looking for.  If you prefer a more crispy cookie you can alter the thickness of your dough when rolling it from the 1/4 inch to thinner than that.

December 9, 2018 I am away visiting my daughter-in-law and we are doing a bit of Xmas baking. We wanted a basic butter tart recipe to divide into two different flavors and hope this will a "keeper". Sounds perfect: nothing out of the ordinary as far as ingredients. I will post our comments! We hope everyone celebrates the season happily and safely.

Butter tarts are a staple in Canada, and I figured I'd try these, since I didn't have any corn syrup handy. They tasted good overall, but were way too sweet; the tops puffed up and cracked during baking, and the insides were runny. I think I'll just use corn syrup next time, and way less sugar than called for here.
ETA: I baked them for a few extra minutes and the insides thickened up more~ husband was happy, but still too sweet for me.

These were sooo good! I added some vanilla and a pinch of salt (as per another review) and used chopped walnuts. They baked up wonderfully - they didn't spill over at all. Next time, though, I'll pre-bake my tart shells. Thanks for the recipe :)

These are really good. Sweet and gooey. Here's what I did:  1. Eliminated the nuts (allergy). 2. To compensate for the removal of the nuts, I added more raisins (a generous 2 cups). 3.  I added a half tsp vanilla replacing an equal amount of cream. 4.  I used whole milk instead of cream. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written using store bought tart shells. I got 30 tarts with this recipe and no leftover filling. Delicious.

With a few adjustments this was fantastic. I added a small amount of vanilla and some salt. I also used less of the raisins and walnuts.

OMG!!!! This recipe is the best. I made it exactly and hubby loved them. So did the neighbour. I copied a few tips for the reviews. I put some raisins and walnuts in each tart first, then I added 1 tablespoon of the filling. This way each tart gets exactly enough filling. They were perfect. Making this again today!!!!

To make 24 muffin tin size tarts I added one egg and doubled the heavy cream. Instead of adding nuts and raisins to filling I distributed then amongst the tarts so that they would be evenly distributed. About 12 raisin per tart. Great hit with family Christmas party

Recipe works awesome as is with store bought tart shells at 20 minutes. No adjustments needed. I whipped the filling fairly significantly with a Kitchenaid and the consistency was perfect.

New favorite!  Due to severe nut allergies, I had to change a bit - I added 1/2 cup currants instead of the nuts, a splash of vanilla and a splash of scotch - heavenly!  Will make again - my 4 year old daughter and 6 year old niece loved to help :)

A favorite for all.  I have added a couple of pieces of rhubarb to each tart for a change....they have quickly become the ones that go first....

I loved it only thing I did different was use a graham crack crust only because I could not find small reg shell tarts but it came out so amazing and delish topped with home made whipped cream

I added a sprinkle of nutmeg & cinnamon. Don't know if it helped much, but it certainly didn't hurt. One of the easiest recipes I have ever made & very delicious!

Excellent. Just the way I like them. Not runny and not dry. Not too sweet either. Only thing I would change is maybe reduce raisins to 1- 1/2 cup. Make 2 doz good size tarts.

I have made these many times and get rave reviews every time. I'm not fond of raisins so I usually scoop out some batter to make myself one or two then dump in the raisins. I always go by the recipe and don't make changes, sometimes I'll buy raisins from the dollar store and find them a bit dry so I'll soak them in hot water for 15-20 minutes. Then drain and dump
I always bring any leftovers to work and get coworkers hunting me down to say thank you

These are delicious! I substituted the cup of nuts for golden raisins. I always plump my raisins in boiled water from the kettle for a few minutes as this makes them far more juicy and tender. I too added a teaspoon of vanilla and added an additional 10 minutes baking time. Wouldn't be Christmas without butter tarts.

This recipe is very good. the flavor is wonderful! However,  there were too many walnuts and raisins for my liking. Next time I make it, I will cut the number of raisins and walnuts in half. I did add the vanilla as well and it was very nice. I also had to extend the cooking time to 35 minutes because they were not done in 20 to 25 minutes.

These tarts were fantastic! The only reason I am giving this recipe four stars is because I used regular milk instead of the heavy cream or coffee creamer as suggested (I didn't have either of those on hand) and I added the vanilla. I toasted the walnuts  before using but I don't think it's necessary to do so. Thanks for the recipe!

These are quite dry. They don't have that creamy melt in your mouth taste.  I'm guessing it needs vanilla extract, corn syrup and place raisins and or nuts on the bottom of the tart shell. I think if you put them in the mix, it will dry out and on top of the filling, it may burn or bake the nuts too much. Will modify and find a happy medium.

Excellent and so easy!  I used store bought tart shells so I didn't want the filling to be too gooey...and it wasn't. The tarts held together nicely!  I added 1 teaspoon vanilla and only used raisins (no nuts)...they were delicious!  I will certainly make them again!

First time making butter tarts and they turned out amazing! I used store bought tart shells and didn't add nuts (bf likes them plain. Even his mom loved them) They were all gone within the day :)
Would definitely make them again!

Only okay. They came out dry. I also found that they did not rise or come in danger of overflowing as other reviewers mentioned so perhaps I ought to have used more filling (I filled to 2/3-3/4 full).

Very tasty!  I omitted the walnuts because I don't like them, added a splash of vanilla as suggested by Rachel W., and substituted 1/2 cup Splenda for 1/2 cup brown sugar because we're trying to cut back a bit on our sugar intake.  The results were delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

Used this recipe based on the reviews and loved it! I opted out of the nuts and raisins and added vanilla and skor bits - turned out amazing.

This is an awesome recipe! I made a couple changes, I added a bit of vanilla,and instead of raisins I used fresh picked apples, chopped up raisin sized! 
Will be making this one again

Excellent and extremely easy, especially with ready made frozen shells. Added the vanilla and used 2% milk instead of cream. I left out the nuts and placed the raisins in the shells before the batter. This is definitely my go to recipe for butter tarts.

this is the first time I made these tarts and got lots of compliments. My husband said they were the best ones he has ever had (and he has had a lot of different tarts)

Very easy recipe, my only change was to add rum extract and I also added a little vanilla (so now its a drunken butter tart) As for my rating nothing gets 5 stars

I substituted pecans for walnuts however when you add any nuts (in the 1 cup range) you take away from the the nice runny, smooth consistency. Nonetheless, it was a hit as far as my wife is concerned (I eat low carb). Next time I will place a layer of cranberry compote (which we always have on hand) on the base before adding the tart mixture. I will also place halved pecans on top instead of chopped ones in the mix.

Easy recipe and so yummy. Only problem was that I had to bake a second batch because my family couldn't stop eating the first one. They are truly delish!

Yes, the filling is excellent.  Had a bit of a problem with my pastry, which is unusual.  A few of them fell apart because the bottom remained wet, so I baked again for 10 minutes, then ended up baking again for another 15...now they are great! The filling I must repeat is the best I've come across to date. I'll do 5 stars because I think the pastry problem was mine.

i always add the nuts to the shells first then pour batter over top, that way i know how much nuts each one is getting. Works great every time

this is my first time rating a recipe (although, i use allrecipes A LOT).

these butter tarts are 5 stars!  maybe even 10 stars.  i followed the recipe as is.  cooking time is accurate and a tip from another reviewer (use 1 tbsp of filling per tart) made for some very well received tarts.  i am making my third batch...  in 2 days!

thank you for this recipe!  it's fantastic!  (and makes me look like a pro-chef!)

Excellent recipe! Easy to follow and the kids loved the taste.  I added unsweetened coconuts and it was a hit!   I did bake for 25 minutes and the tarts came out light/medium golden brown. I guess it all depends on your oven.  I will make this again.

Delicious. The best tarts I have ever made and close to the best I have ever tasted. It's this latter point that prevents me from giving the recipe 5 stars.

FAB-U-LOUS! My first attempt at butter tarts and they were so ridiculously easy!! The only 2 things I changed was omitted the raisins since I'm not a fan and used pecans. Secondly since some people suggested adding vanilla I used a vanilla flavoured creamer instead of the heavy cream....fantastic flavour...I could barely wait for them to cool before I ate one since they looked so perfect! LOL

Very easy and yummy recipe, the best I've ever had, used Caramel Vanilla Creamer insted of Heavy Cream, gave them a really nice flavor. Will be making another batch before Christmas.
