Yum! Hearty texture, not too sweet, not too banana-y. These could be served for breakfast, or in place of typical cornbread muffins at dinner time. Delicious with butter, of course! I used one cup fresh mango because I already had some on hand. For half the batch I tossed in 1/4 cup of cranberries and topped with sliced almonds. I loved the addition of almonds, but the cranberries made the flavors too confusing. I will be making this easy recipe again.  ** Next time I will replace the couscous with quinoa so they'll be gluten free!

Surprisingly good!  I was looking for a way to use up my dried mango that the kids wouldn't eat on its own and thought I'd give this a shot.  These are moist and delicious.  Not too sweet, but sweet enough to eat on their own.  They'd be great with butter or jam.  I used about 3/4 cup of dried mangoes, since I wanted to use all I had, followed the recipe completely other than that.  Next time, I'll take the other reviewer's advice and use quinoa in place of the couscous for gluten free and a little extra protein.  Thanks!

I was honestly expecting this recipe to flop, but it turned out great. I made it as a bread instead of muffins. I used half apple butter/half oil and added a tsp of cinnamon. Also used chopped fresh pear because I was out of dried mangoes. The exture is dense, moist, and anything but "gritty". This bread made great French toast the next day. I'll probably add some nuts next time. Thanks Rachel D!

My roommate made this but left out the banana because we didn't have any on hand. I was ADDICTED. This is probably my new favorite muffin recipe--delightfully unique without being too sweet!

Unusual and a bit unpleasant texture.  The flavor was OK.  They completely fell apart with "sandy" texture the next day.  Will not make again

I had my doubts when I first made this recipe but it's quickly beside a family staple.  Healthy, yummy and filling we snack on these without guilt. Definite recommend!

I will not make this again, it has almost no flavor. I can't even taste the bananas and mangoes.
