Batter was extremely stiff after adding all the oats and coconut, but the cookies came out beautifully.  And more importantly, they were delicious!!  I made these for Easter and when they came out of the oven, I pressed the center down.  Once cooled, I adhered small jellybeans in the center of each cookie with a bit a chocolate frosting.  They were a hit and I will definitely keep this recipe as an Easter tradition!

These were pretty good, especially after adding a dab of chocolate frosting to the centers and adding some jelly bellys. I also increased the cocoa to 2/3 cup and took a teaspoon and made an indentation for the jelly beans before baking.

This recipe is great, Ive made it several times and replaced the oats with more coconut - ran out of oats because of these : D - It was then soft enough to put through the cookie press & I also "glued" 2 together with melted chocolate - a definite "keep" recipe both original & altered version

These are easy to make and come out great every time I make them. I do not add the candy eggs. Other wise I wouldn't change a thing.

I made these cookies because they looked like the ones served when I was in elementary school.  The cookies did spread more than I thought they would, but came out looking great!  I didn't add anything to the top - not necessary.  Yummy, delicious, scrumptuous......

These turned out great - the kids especially liked them.  I put jelly beans in the center instead of chocolate eggs, and they were perfect for Easter.

This recipe was excellent.  I used candy covered chocolate eggs, but used 2 in each cookie instead of 1.  They need to be added shortly after the cookies come out of the oven so that the cookies don't break, and so the eggs stick.  The cookies were a big hit, and they are especially good warm since the chocolate eggs are melted.

These cookies spread more than I thought they would.  They tasted great, but were nothing like "nests".

I made these (without the candy eggs) as Christmas give-aways in 2004 for classmates in my language class & received good comments - in 11 languages! Brought also some to my mother-in-law, who already lost her "sweet tooth" long time ago, she ate a couple, asked for the recipe and said nothing further. I recently found out that she has been making it regularly for her husband, too! My own husband, however, brought them for his officemates and they were gone in less than 60 seconds! Thanks for this recipe, it is definitely one of those that I will keep on using in the coming years!

Flavor was good but the cookies were hard not soft like most oatmeal cookies.

These cookies are very good, but spread too much to be used as nests.

This recipe is great! I took it to friends house and they loved it. It almost reminds me of a brownie in a cookie shape.

These were good, but I think my kids liked making them more than eating them.  I didn't have the chocolate "eggs" to put in the nests, so used mini speckled malted milk eggs.  It threw me off because the malted milk centers were very chewy while the cookies were still warm, but after they cooled, they became crunchy again.
