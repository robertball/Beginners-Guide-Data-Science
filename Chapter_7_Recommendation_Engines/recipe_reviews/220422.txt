Keeper! This is both beautiful and delicious. I used baby bella (crimini) mushrooms and placed them on the same sheet pan as the peppers. I tossed the peppers with a little olive oil and lightly salted them before broiling them. I didn't thoroughly char the peppers and I didn't peel them. The slightly browned edges add a wonderful flavor. Note: the peppers and mushrooms could be prepared in advance and then just rewarmed with the asparagus. This would be a perfect for company a vegetarian meal or served with shrimp would be wonderful. Heck you could cook the shrimp in the same skillet as the asparagus. Impressive!

This was a tasty meal. I did not take the skins off the peppers. I tossed the peppers in olive oil and sea salt before roasting. We enjoyed it with a tossed salad and Kings Hawaiian dinner rolls. A Riesling was perfect with it.

This was an amazing recipe! Easy and quick. I used gluten free egg noodles and no butter or oil just a tablespoon of coconut oil in the cast iron pan to sauté the veggies. Also didn t skin the peppers. Yummy and Easy peasy!!

This was excellent! My husband said it is a keeper! I did make a few a few changes. Like the others I did not peel the peppers. I added some sliced green onions (as I didn't have asparagus) to the mushrooms and balsamic vinegar to marinate. I added the mushrooms and green onions and balsamic vinegar to the peppers and baked a few minutes longer. I used extra garlic because we love it and sautéed it in olive oil and ghee. Added all the veggies and sautéed until warm. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great healthy summer pasta dish. The flavors are much more interesting than you'd suspect. I also left the skins on the peppers and added a bit of freshly grated asiago cheese before serving. Yum!
