We really liked this recipe and the dijon really came through. I'm confused by the bone broth the recipe calls for. I used chicken broth and it worked just fine. The one thing I will do differently next time is to fully cook the pork and then pull it out and set it aside and then add it in the end. That way it retains most of its crispness instead of getting soggy in the gravy. Overall great recipe and one I will make again. I might even replace the rosemary with oregano.

I liked it. We used chicken stock and regular flour. However it seemed a bit thin. We would make it again for the flavour and just try little tweaks.

I made this and unfortunately I didn't like it much. The balsamic vinegar made the gravy tangy and somehow, I didn't get much flavor from the rosemary and thyme. I could've put more but for some reason I just don't think this recipe is for me. I was expecting a thicker richer gravy and more of a hearty flavor.
