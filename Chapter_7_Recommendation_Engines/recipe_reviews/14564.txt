I made the following changes to this recipe; its not that I didn’t like this recipe as it was published, but I wanted more of a beef flavor in the onions so it taste more like French onion soup. Therefore, I made the following changes. I use Beef base instead of the bullion (about tablespoon for a medium size onion) this gives it more of an intense beef flavor like French onion soup, also mixed in some mozzarella cheese along with the soup base before placing it in the center, then topped it with the butter. It is imperative that the onions be wrapped tight with at least two layers of foil to insure the juice remains within the package when cooking.

I love this recipe - baked, grilled, or microwaved! I first learned the microwave version of this Vidalia onion recipe.  (Using a melon baller, scoop top of onion.  Fill cavity with beef bouillon granules, top with butter.  Cover loosely, microwave about 4  minutes, or until tender.)

I've been making BBQ onions this way for years. They are AWESOME! I add a splash of white wine or Southern Comfort or whiskey or whatever sounds good before wrapping it up. The alcohol will cook off and leave an incredible flavor mixed with the boullion and butter. YUMMY!!!

These are really tasty - but be sure to use the BIG onions like the recipe calls for. I tried this the second time with smaller onions and they were so salty because of the bouillon.

I used beef bouillon and put the onions on the grill.  They tasted like french onion soup and were absolutely delicious!  I used medium sized onions and they only took about 20-30 min.

These were awesome.  I don't really like raw onions and I wanted something to make them taste good.  This worked so well, and you can use it with almost anything.  So....good.  Can't wait till the next grilled dinner....Thanks for posting.

What an amazing recipe!  And SO easy.  I didn't really believe that this would taste like french onion soup, but it really does.  Just be sure your coals are really hot, because the onions will take quite a while to get really nice and soft.  I tried doing some over medium coals with large onions and it took almost 2 hours.

If you really want the french onion soup experience you can put the onion with the juice (and there is a LOT of juice) into an oven-safe bowl, add slices of french bread, top with cheese and throw it under the broiler until the cheese is melted.  Alone, this recipe is fantastic though.  I make it all the time now and it's always a hit!

I cut the recipe in half and added some minced garlic.  I made this version to go with grilled turkey.  I have to say I definitely like grilled onion with beef boullion much better, it just has a better flavor.

Replace butter and chicken bouillon with 2 shots of Jack Daniels.  Great addition to grilled steak and potatoes.

This is to die for. I made some changes -baked in 375 oven for 90 minutes. Cored medium Vidalia onions and put a teaspoon of beef base in each, topped with pat of light butter & sprinked with pepper and thyme. added a splash of white wine and wrapped in foil. Tasted just like french onion soup - YUM! Could easily eat this alone with a fresh green salad & french bread!

These are fantastic, but I always use beef boullion for more flavor.  I put them on the grill for about 45 minutes or until they caramelize on the outside.  Tastes just like French Onion soup!

Oh wow! The onions are FABULOUS! My two medium-large onions took a little longer than I expected - 90 mins at 375 in the oven. BUT, it was worth the wait! I really liked GRUVNGYRL's suggestion, so I sliced and buttered four 1.5 inch pieces of French bread, arranged them in a Pyrex dish, plopped the cooked onions on top, grated some extra-sharp Cheddar and some mozzerella all over, then baked them til they were bubbling and browned (about 10 mins). Absolutely DELICIOUS! With the bread and cheese, this makes an excellent meal. Thank you SO much, Linda!

As written the recipe is just okay but it can really be adjusted to be excellent. I peel and cut the end opposite the root off, scoop some of the center out and then make vertical slices down the onion ( careful not to cut right to the bottom) and I spread the onion open ( like a flower/blooming onion) sprinkle the hole of the onion and inside of the onion sections  with a little less than a teaspoon full of beef bouillon granules, a pinch of brown sugar, pepper and small butter chunks. Double wrap in foil and bake in a pan at 375 for almost an hour. Then when I open the foil packets I add some shredded Jarlsberg/mozzarella cheese and a few croutons. It tastes JUST like french onion soup, it is excellent and everyone so far has loved them.

I skip the chicken bullion. Scoop the center of the onion out. Put about a tbs of butter and then fill it up with worchestire sauce. Douple wrap it in heavy duty foil. Put it over medium heat on the grill about an hour before you throw your steak on.... YUMMY!!!

Delicious and easy.   

I used beef bullion instead of the chicken bullion.  Since our outdoor temperature was in the low 100's I opted to microwave (instead of baking) this dish for 6 minutes in a glass dish covered with cling wrap.  Our English guests raved about the flavor, "Something so easy, so simple, and yet so very delicious."  

THANK YOU LINDA SMITH for sharing this recipe with us!

Very good topping for the smothered filet mignon recipe!!  I only used 2 onions and sprinkled on powdered bouillon I cut the onion into smaller slices to shorten the cooking time to 30 minutes.

I did this in the microwave because there was nothing else that would be going on the grill.  I wrapped in parchment paper and put it in for five min.  I was pleasantly surprised that the chicken flavour was present in the whole onion, right through to the outer layer.  Of course right in the middle it was really strong but still good.

So easy, fast and deliscious(I used microwave suggestion - 2 med onions were done in 4 1/2 minutes)!

So good I can't even tell you. I tried 1 with chicken bullion and 1 with beef and I can't pick a favorite. We will be having these often! Thanks for sharing!

Everyone who has tried these onions loves them.  They are so easy to prepare, too.  Our home is in a perpetual state of renovations and without air conditioning, at the present time.  Cooking these on the grill outside really is great when the summer temps rise.

I don't know what went wrong. they were just middle of the road. maybe the salt, but I anticipated it and cut bullion in half and used unsalted butter. I'm gonna give this another shot...I know these guys are gonna be jim dandy with some tweaking.

We make these all the time, and love them! I cut each onion down the middle a few times to get it to 'flare' out (think Bloomin' Onion) a bit. Just try not to cut clear through, but if you do, no worries. It's dinner, not rocket science! Not only does this help with the cooking, but it allows the onion to release more of its juices. I smear the butter on the top of the onion, and top with bouillon granules. They will dissolve and you won't end up with a chunk that didn't disperse. Double wrap each onion with heavy duty foil. I put the onion in the middle of the foil and grab the ends together and squeeze them at the top. This allows the juice a space to collect, without leaking out of a seam. If your foil gets a hole in it and the juices leak out, the onion won't cook properly, and it won't be as sweet. These are best with a sweet onion, such as Vidalia, although Walla Walla would be excellent as well. We use these as a side dish, cooking 1 onion per person. We have always used beef bouillon, but will try chicken, or a soup base next time, or some soy sauce.

I am extremely picky about handing out praise for a recipe, but this one is more than deserving. Perfect every time, with a deep, rich taste. This is a side dish for many of my dinners. I also use this to create grilled onions for many other dishes (fajitas, pita sandwiches, etc). You cannot go wrong trying this one!

I used one large onion and one small. In the large one I used a buillion cube and it was so salty by salt-loving boyfriend couldn't eat all of it. The small one I used chicken soup base and it was good but still too salty. Next time we will use 1-2 tsp of soup base and a bit less butter. Also, watch the grilling time. The large one was done in about 45 mins. Thanks for the recipe, we can't wait to try it again, with modifications.

Pretty Tasty. Could use more than one bouillon cube per onion, though. I cooked mine over the barbeque grill (propane) and it took them exactly 1 hour to cook.

Put two of these on the smoker while hubby was making brisket.  YUM!!  I completely agree with the reviewer that said it tastes like French onion soup. This will be a go-to any time I grill!!

I made one large onion with beef bouillon instead of chicken, and my wife said it was the best onion she's ever had in her life. It tasted exactly like french onion soup as others suggested. This is going on the permanent rotation!

We already had the grill going when I stumbled upon this recipe.  I HAD to try it right then!  Because I needed the onion to be ready in less than an hour, I cut it into fairly large pieces, divided all the little sections, sprinkled with salt, then topped off with the butter and a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce because I forgot that I had bouillon cubes.  My little packet of onions was done in less than half an hour (though longer would have been fine too).  It tasted quite good!  I can see this becoming a grill standby recipe.  Next time I'm going to follow the recipe except chop the onion again because it turned out so well and crumble the bouillon cube on top.  Can't wait!

I'd say these were pretty good - I used a reduced salt chicken boullion, so it wasn't too salty for my taste. I made them in the oven, but I don't think I cooked them long enough, or at a high enough temperature, as they were a little underdone after an hour of cooking. I think the recipe would be really easy to modify for different spice combinations.

Great! Reminds me of the county fair. The size of your onion does matter for cooking time. My medium size onion was done in about 45 minutes.

WOW!  This was FANTASTIC!  I used a Vidalia onion and I must say, right after I ate it, I called my mother to tell her to make one!  I love that it takes such little time to make, you can make as many or few as you'd like.  Still couldn't get my daughter to try it..haha.. but it was delicious!!!!! THANKS!!!!

This recipe is for onion lovers and I am one.  Very good and easy too.  I did use chicken base instead of the bouillon cube (too much salt).

I did the recipe in the oven, and the tin foil was filled with the juices.  The onion was very tender and not too salty.  I can hardly wait to try this recipe on the Barbeque.

Very Good!
I grow herbs along with my vegetables, so I made an herbed butter with some fresh rosemary and just a pinch of garlic powder the second time I made this.
If you like onions, this is bliss!
Especially when Vidalias are in season!

Made these tonight. As others have done, I used low sodium beef bouillon (actually the "Better than Bouillon" reduced sodium.) I also added 2 T of Jack Daniels to each. Also, double wrapped them in heavy duty foil. They were delicious! I wouldn't go as far as saying French Onion Soup, but they were a perfect accompaniment to my grilled steaks.

This is really stupendous. My husband will eat anything onion. But while I like onions as a flavoring, I don't normally eat An Onion. I don't even put a slice of onion on my hamburgers.  But this? I made two vidalia onions for the two of us, figuring I could share mine with my husband. NOPE. I ate it all.
I used vidalia onions, "Better Than Boullion" Beef Base and much less butter because we're on diets.  And it was still divine.  BRAVO.

I loved this treat, it reminds me of when I was a kid and we went camping and threw them in the campfire.  The only thing I added was a tad bit of garlic salt. Excellent!  I recommend to all!

These were wonderful!  I made two large onions on the grill for a cookout.  I used a little less butter, only about 1 TBSP each.  Wow what great flavor!  I got rave reviews from everyone and I think we'll make one of these everytime we grill now!

I was looking for something simple to add to my grilled dinner and decided to try this one. I didn't have any bouillon cubes so I put a glove of garlic into each onion instead.  It turned out wonderful!  I will definitely try this with the bouillon next time and maybe the garlic also. So easy and so delicious!

I have tried these both on the grill for an hour and in the microwave (for 4 minutes per one review).  I think they needed to cook a little more in the microwave, but an hour worked great for me on the grill.  LOVED THESE!!!  The flavor was delicious!!!!!  I did use the chicken instead of the beef...

So good, I think next time I will start it in the micro for a few minutes, everything else was ready except for the onions. I will also carve more of center out next time, filling was overflowing,  so so good. yum

Excellent flavor! We had these with BBQ ribs, corn and potatoes. Very nice side dish and the leftovers were excellent the next night on beer brats. I made mine with beef boullion. I got them assembled & wrapped, then cooked them for about 20 minutes in the convection oven just to speed things along before finishing them on the grill. Definitely a keeper!

I too have made these for years with one small difference.  If I am serving them with beef I use beef boullion.  I only use chicken boullion with poultry.  I also use granules instead of cubes, I think they dissolve and spread the flavor through the onion better than the cubes.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Oh, in the winter I bake these in the oven.  Works just as well.

My dad has been doing this forever, it's amazing. We're use vidallia onions usually and a beef bouillon. Wrap it up like a Hershey kiss. Serve over a nice steak, pouring the juices all over it. Yum!

I also used the beef bouillon and it was ridiculously delicious!! My wife and daughter LOVED them. Thanks for sharing. I have a feeling I will be making these very often.

Update: made them again the next night. This time I added a little bit of minced garlic in the center of the onion! I enjoyed the added flavor.

All I can say is WONDERFUL!  I never cared for the baked onions that my husband liked (no real flavor) but these babies are just like eating a bowl of yummy French onion soup.  Will be making these many times.

These were pretty good but I think I would give it 5* with beef bouillon instead of chicken.  I used smaller onions and did one per person, serving them whole. FYI:  The thing about serving them whole instead of cut up in the juice is that the centers were rather salty.  My rating is not based on this though, since the recommendation is to cut them up.

This was awesome... I found this recipe on here and just had to try it - it seemed so different to me.  I love onions, but have never had them just on the side by themselves.  Well, I might change that now.  What a great addition to the grillin' menu!

Thank you!  This was fabulous.  As suggested in other reviews I added whiskey to the cored out hole on top of the bullion cube, topping that with the butter which kind of sealed up the hole.  1 hour in medium heat gas grill was almost perfect, just a little blackened on the bottom which was not a problem. Yum!

Pretty good side when grilling. I used a local grown sweet onion. I also used two boullion cubes and a little more butter based on many reviews claiming it was not flavorful enough.  It seemed to be flavorful enough to me! Good with steaks.

Pretty awesome (I don't eat onions but this got a 'This is trulely something special' from the boyfriend). The boyfriend thought chicken bouillon is probably better than beef, so we may not try the beef option better.  The butter/bouillon didn't disperse so well, so I might cut cris crosses into the top or something, there's no way to really spread the onion out.  I'll use Goya bouillon packets from now on as well, and sprinkle some on top.

Excellent on the grill - just like a very good french onion soup.  We used a dollar store pie tin instead of individually wrapping each onion.  Then covered the pie tin with tin foil for indirect grilling.

So good with Steak.  Hallow out the center of a onion with a parring knife.  Stuff with the butter/bouillon cube - rub some on the top. Wrapped in foil and grill - indirect heat for 60 minutes.  Fabulous.

Awesome!  My boyfriend and I made these two nights in row, they were sooooo good. 

We used beef bouillion granules instead of cubes, and only had room for half of the butter, which was plenty for us.  The onions were perfectly cooked at 1 hour on the grill.  Next time, we want to try some chopped garlic mixed with the butter.

So good, and so easy!

I thought the taste of these onions was very good. I had a little problem with the boullion.  The boullion didn't want to melt in the onion.  It stayed pretty concentrated inside the onion, so I had to mix it upto get the flavors blended, but very good.
would've liked it a little more well done.  took longer than an hour to get cooked to desired texture.

These were excellent-I'm absolutely hooked. I only had a bag of cooking onions, but really wanted to try this. The onions were small so I cut a beef boullion cube in half and used butter. Doubled wrapped in foil and they were done a medium heat grill in 20-30 minutes. If outside layer is burnt just peel off-did not have burnt taste. These had the flavor of french onion soup and were awesome with my steak. Thankyou!! I'll be making this with my steak always!

These were delicious! I used large vidalia onions - scooped out the middle, plopped a beef boullon cube in and butter. Mine took way longer than 1 hour to cook, closer to 2. They were worth the wait. I reheated one of the leftover onions the next day, it was GREAT!

Absolutely delicious!! I microwaved the onions and wrapped in plastic wrap and put in a bowl because the plastic leaked.
Served the onions over broiled steak and it was fantastic!
Next time I want to try over a grill to get some browning on the onions.

These were unbelievably salty!  I think the recipe has potential, but next time I'll either cut the bouillon cube in half or try a sodium free version.  Other than the salt issue, these came out great.  The white onions were perfectly tender.  To prepare the onion -- I sliced the top off going about 1/4 of the way down the onion, then used a rounded tablespoon to scoop out a small hole from the middle of the remaining 3/4 of the onion.  Put the top back on and wrap in aluminium foil.  Super easy!  I'll make these again but I'll be more mindful about the salt.

OMG!!! I threw 2 on the grill & literally forgot them while inside doing other stuff.  Then, surprise, we ended up having 6 extra people for dinner.  There was almost a brawl over these.  Fabulous! Easy! And very forgiving if you're forgetful, lol.  Make extra!!!

3-16-2017 Again, I cooked these in the oven, this time at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. They were not done, but we ate them anyway. Next time, I'll try 400 degrees for 30-45 minutes.            6-21-2016 Because of circumstances, I cooked this onion in a 400 degree oven for 1 hour...which was too long. Next time I would cook it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes and see what it is like at that point. This was good...just too soft. I believe I would prefer it a little firmer. Using a metal melon baller/cookie scoop worked perfectly for hollowing out the onion.  I used 1 tsp. Better than Bouillon rather than a bouillon cube because it's what I use. The onion needed a little more salt, especially on the outer layers.

I love these- so tasty and easy.  I would give it a 5 star if it had beef bouillon instead of chicken.  I also added a dash of wistershire sauce - yumm.  I like another reviewers comment to add a shot of bourbon- bet that would be great- I'll try it next time.  Another helpful tip from a reviewer was to use a melon baller to make the cavity large enough.

I liked these.  Like many others I used beef bouillon and some garlic salt and baked  them in foil in the oven.  I used a baseball size (hard ball) onion and 30 minutes at 325 was not enough.  Next time I did 60 min at 350 and they were perfect. .  The hollowed out 'well' inside the onion needs to be pretty good sized for the bullion, garlic and butter.

Onion lovers UNITE! These were absolutely amazing. Made the whole neighborhood smell good. Even the neighbors were like "what is that?!" This has a taste similar to French onion soup, slowly simmering all day. Very moist & buttery. Used small white onions and only needed to cook about 35 min really. Tonight we are going to use HUGE vidalias. Wondering if cilantro would be good stuffed in these as well. Will try sometime. We will definitely keep this recipe as it puts onions on a pedestal & we love onions. Will share with friends. Thank you for sharing:)

Used chicken Better Than Bouillon low sodium,made crosshatch cuts as others suggested, splashed in a little Pinot Grigio, tossed them in the smoker for the last 2 hours with a roast. Came out a little more mooshey than I would have liked. Awesome doesn't quite describe how good they were! Just might make them for every Sat. night campfire, but cook them less. Will try beef bouilion sometime. Thanks so much Linda!

We have made these delicious grilled onions many times.  One caution - be very careful not to overcook.  It all depends how hot you run your grill.  Also, I have started double wrapping them just in case the foil gets a hole or tear.  You don't want all those yummy juices escaping.  They can also be done in an oven.

The bouillon in these made them pretty salty tasting.  The flavor was ok, but that sodium was pretty overwhelming.

These tuned out really good. Tasty and great with the rest of the grilled dinner. Mine came out kind of mushy, so I think next time I wont keep them on the grill for so long- maybe only 45 min or so. But thats just chef error so I still give this side dish 4 stars.

For me, this was okay.  For real onion lovers, this recipe is probably divine, but I realized after making it that I don't think I'm as big of a fan as I originally thought.  I substituted sodium-free chicken bullion which kept it from being too salty.

So simple, but so good! I have gotten many compliments and requests to make them. We used the beef bouillon as was suggested.
