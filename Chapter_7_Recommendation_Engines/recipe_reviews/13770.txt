Made this recipe by the book.  Pre-tasted before putting it on the ham. It was too bland.  I added another teaspoon lemon juice, two teaspoons sugar, and another 2/3 cup raisins. The sauce became rather yummy at that point.  My wife loved it.  But be aware that it masks the taste of the ham with a beefy flavor, rather than complementing the ham the way that pineapple or brown sugar do.  Great recipe for people who don't normally like the taste of ham.
