This was pretty good. The only problem I had was the turkey legs. It was really hard to cut off the bone and into cubes. So I cooked it bone first then cut it up. But it still took forever. I think I will try this with turkey breast next time and not hassle with the leg even though I prefer the dark turkey meat.
