I hate tinkering w/ something already so good but for my personal taste, I added:  crumbled 3 pieces of crisp bacon, 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. of onion powder, and 1/2 tsp. mustard powder.  The results are amazing!

We don't eat pork but like sauerkraut.  This was a surprisingly good dish.  Will make as a side dish, as an appetizer, and as a snack.  Left out the mace (didn't have)but was excellent without.  Thank you for a new addition to my collection of must make often recipes.

These were absolutely delicious!  I cooked them in a deep fryer, and they came out so fluffly and tender, with the great taste of saurkraut.  This recipe is easy, and would make a fast and easy appetizer for company, served with a dipping sauce of your choice.  I used honey mustard when I served mine.  My husband says "thumbs up"...this recipe is a "keeper"!  Thanks so much for sharing it.

We made these for our holiday party and they turned out great. Big hit with everyone. Just drop them by teaspoonfuls into the deep fryer for about 4-5 minutes and they come out perfect. We use thousand island dressing as a dipping sauce. They reheat very well also, just put them in the oven for a few minutes to heat them up. We made them a couple hours ahead of time.

I made these for our Christmas Eve party and they were a big hit.  I served them with a creamy horseradish sauce which complimented the flavor wonderfully.

These were just ok for us.  I love sauerkraut but after this recipe realize that it is better on a Reuben or a brat.

Absolutely delicious!  We had a German night with guests and this is what we served as appetizers.  Easy to prepare ahead of time and easy to serve as well.  Everyone loved them!  GREAT recipe!

For me these turned out more like sauerkraut cakes than balls. The taste was average, just not real strong and too doughy even though they were brown on the outside. These just didn't do it for me.

These word pretty good, but I can't figure out why they weren't very "sour" kraut-tasting........

I couldn't find the mace spice, but with only 1/8 tsp, I wouldn't think that would make a difference.

Can someone shed some light for me????

Maybe it was my brand of kraut????

I just know when I get these at a restaurant, they are much more tart.

Interesting!  I didn't know what to think at first, but tasty.  Crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside.  Tip:  make sure not to have too much oil in the pan when frying!  I didn't measure the oil with the first batch and eyeballed it-they turned out a little soggy from laying in oil.

We enjoyed these very much. I froze some of them, and they reheat very well in the oven. This makes it perfect to have on hand for a quick snack.

We made these on Christmas eve.  They turned out more like potato pancakes than balls, but they were awesome.  Can't wait to make them again

I cooked in the cafeteria at the Whirlpool plant in Marion,Ohio. I had leftover sauerkraut;soI found this recipe and tried it out. One of the girls said they were better than her grandmother's! I love them too.

My roommates groaned when I got out the sauerkraut (they're not big fans...), but even they thought this recipe was great! The sauerkraut flavor is pretty subdued, but tasty.
