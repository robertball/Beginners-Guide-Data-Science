I've been cooking lobster for 35 years. 8 minutes is not long enough to fully cook a lobster.  The recipe sound wonderful but please cook the lobsters (1 1/2 lb) for 20 minutes.

Loved this. It was really easy to make and had a great flavor.  Will Definitely make this again.  I made fried toast point with this but next time will add some kind of rice dish to soak up the delicious sauce.  Thanks for posting.

I used large lobster tails. I did add garlic. I added some small amount of flour/butter to the mixture because it never thickened up after 20 minutes. Otherwise followed recipe. Tasted pretty good.
