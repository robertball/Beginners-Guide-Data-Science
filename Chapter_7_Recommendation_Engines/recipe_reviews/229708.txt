I modified this slightly as I put the sugar and cinnamon in with the filling and then fried ... was quick, easy and tasted great.  Next time I might modify with some sour cream or cream cheese in with the filling.   I put them in the fridge and have a great snack with a quick warm-up in the microwave.

These are ok..... No wow factor here because they're kind of bland. Would probably taste better with ice cream on top, or cream cheese mixed in with the apple filling.

It's okay. I'm no fryer or fry cook so you can only imagine how the first batch turned out. But after the second try it was pretty good. It definitely fulfilled my appetite!

I used apples that I cooked.  Filling had great taste, however using a tortilla shell was like McDonald's apple pie gone bad.  I would suggest a normal flaky pie crust or roll out dough.
