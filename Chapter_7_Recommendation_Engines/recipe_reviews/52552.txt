Three stars as written, as I see this recipe as only the foundation or starting point for a finished dish.  I used halibut rather than cod, but that's neither here nor there and doesn't affect the recipe.  I sweated the mushrooms along with the onion and garlic as I didn't need them to give off all their juices into the sauce as the dish was baking! I didn't add cornstarch or milk, as neither was necessary if you simply reduce the cream to thicken. The cream sauce needed flavor beyond the dill and a little sherry was the obvious choice.  I didn't use the Parmesan - I guess being Italian I have a bias against using cheese with fish or other seafood!  Finally, since this was to be baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes (perfect time and temperature by the way), there was no need to cover it and have it "stew" rather than bake, also holding on to all of the juices which would only have made the sauce more liquidy. This turned out to be a rich, flavorful dish, with both the shrimp and the fish perfectly cooked. The sherry, as Hubs so aptly put it, definitely gave the dish character.  I layered the shrimp over the fish filets, then poured the sauce over them.  It isn't directed to do this in the recipe, but do salt and pepper your fish and shrimp before pouring over the sauce and baking! For a little color, sprinkle on a little paprika.  The small changes I've outlined gave this dish definition and dimension and went a long way toward bringing this dish up to a good 4-star rating.

I tried this (with the following modifications) and it was LOVED by all.  I substituted a can of evaporated milk for the heavy cream, added 1 teas. of tarragon and baked it uncovered.  It lowered the fat, increased the subtle herb flavoring and kept it from getting watery.

Absolutely oustanding - so rich and elegant, but so easy to make. I made it pretty much as written - cut back on the parsley as we aren't huge fans - but I'm sure it would work just as well with any other white fish, and maybe a combination of shrimp and scallops. Thanks so much, Lynseey!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and I found the dill to be wayyyyy too overpowering for the rest of the ingredients :( So unless you're a big dill fan I'd cut back on it, other than that this was pretty good.

I made this using half and half intsead of the heavy cream, and 1 tsp dried dill instead of fresh, and it was amazingly good. It tasted like something you would pay a lot for at a restaurant, yet it was simple to make at home. I will definitely be making this again, although I think I will add more mushrooms and shrimp (about double of each) next time.

This is really good! After reading other reviews, I doubled the sauce.  It took a little tweaking to adjust the seasoning to my liking - I added red crushed pepper for spice and extra butter for richness. Served with rice and heavily seasoned green beans. Again, very good!

I read some reviews before making this dish and I took some of the advice.  I am not a fan of dill so I used some dried tarragon instead.  I also added a dash of sherry and I am glad I did. The dish turned out fine but it would have been very bland without the sherry.  I omitted the milk and cornstarch and I did not cover the dish when I put it in the oven.  The sauce had a nice consistency and was not too watery.  Overall, I found the effort I put into this dish was not worth the outcome.  I will not be making this again.

This recipe really was delicious!  I used dry dill and only sprinkled it on for a bit of flavor rather than overpowering the simple ingredients, and it was great.  My one complaint was that the sauce really watered down in the oven even though it was nice and thick prior to that.  The fish seemed to give off water to thin it down...but the flavor on the rice was still delicious.

Excellent recipe!  I did not have the mushrooms so I simply made it without them.  I also subsitituted half & half for the heavy cream.  I'd definitely make this one again.

O M G...this was soooooo good!!! I did make a few minor changes...I used a can of evaporated milk instead of the cream as suggested by another reviewer, I added some old bay, and I had fully cooked frozen shrimp so I just thawed them and added them to the mix when it was all finished cooking. Oh, and I also used 8 oz. of mushrooms because they needed to get used up and we like mushrooms up in here. And I sauteed them with the onion. The only other thing I did was I did not make the rice, but made biscuits instead and just served this like a seafood biscuits and gravy. YUM!!! Seriously one of the best recipes I've made on here :)

This was quite good. It was a little bland so I had to add some extra spices. I don't like to use that much cream either so I used 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup milk. I used 2 tbsp of corn starch to thinken the extra milk. I sauteed 1/2 cup onionand I had to add an extra tbsp of dill and a tbsp of garlic powder. I mixed 1 tbsp of parmesan cheese into the cream mixture and then topped it off in the end with another tbsp of parmesan.

I didn't have cream, so used evaporated milk but it worIed just as well.  I also cooked uncovered after reading some reviews about it becoming too watery.  I thought that this was good but richer than most meals I would eat and my husband didn't like it at all so I've given it 3 out of 5 stars.  I probably won't make it again.

Very good.  I omitted the shrimp and mushrooms since I didn't have any.  I also used dry dill and added Lawrys Garlic Salt to the sauce according to my taste. Came out very good.  This is a keeper!

I used condensed milk instead of cream. It turned out awesome. Compliments from all. We used angel hair instead of rice and it was wonderful. Well worth the effort.

I prepared up to the baking in the morning and refrigerated for the day. This almost doubled the baking time but still just as good. Plenty of sauce for pasta the next day. 
Guests loved it !!!!

My wife informs me that I will definitely be making this again. Made a few changes as noted by others. Didn't use the milk or cornstarch  and didn't cover, though I thought the sauce was a little thin. Used Vermouth in the cream because I didn't have sherry as some others added. I sweated the mushrooms with the garlic and added a little red pepper flakes. Also layered the shrimp on the Cod before pouring over the cream. That made a great presentation.  Great and easy recipe.

WOW! That was awesome! I tweaked it a little. 2% evaporated milk, 1 tbls. more butter, 2 tsp. taragon, doubled the onion, tripled the garlic (we're fiends), shredded 1/4 cp. Parmesan in the sauce, then served it with red pepper flakes, Parmesan, and fresh parsley over noodles. I'm so satisfied! What an awesome recipe to work with! And it's less fatty but you wouldn't know it!

I made this and I was at first not want to do this with cornstarch as a base for the cream, I am glad I did it was very creamy and smooth. I will now have my cook at school start her cream gravy's with cornstarch. I did use whole and peeled shrimp. I added the shrimp the last 8 min because it does not need 30 min. Any way very good way to go Lynseey

I used 1 1/2 pounds of perch instead of cod. I'm glad I had some extra fish as it made a lot of sauce. Its says seasoning salt to taste so there really isnt any excuse for anyone to call this bland. I threw in some old bay to the sauce which was a great touch. I considered using the canned salad shrimp because it is after all a sauce but decided to buy the raw peel and eat. I'm very much glad I did the shrimp and sauce were perfectly cooked and went very well together whithout overpowering the light fresh taste of the fish.

The flavor was good, but I thought it was bland too like one person has commented. I would definately use less heavy cream next time as I ended up with alot of sauce.

Great flavor. I agree with the rest of the reviews that the sauce gets a little runny. We had it with rice, but I think it would have been even better over pasta. I didn't think the dill was overpowering. Loved it!

My family loved this recipe!  I modified it using MimicCream instead of real cream (at health food stores)and a rice blend.  It tasted great and no one guessed that it was a low fat healthy recipe.  The cod was perfect with this shrimp/mushroom cream sauce.

I'm rating this a 4 because my better half wasn't crazy about it, but I thought it was excellent ... I substituted FF half & half for the heavy cream and eliminated the dill ... I'll be making this again but might use a different fish other than cod (Halibut, perhaps)

This recipe was YUMMY!!!  My husband actually found the recipe and made it himself.  Turned out beautifully.  May taste better with wild rice.  Regular rice is just too bland for our tastebuds.  Will certainly make this again.

I very much enjoyed this dish.  I didn't have any fresh mushrooms so I had to leave that out, however I didn't miss them in the end.  I, too, used dried dill and added a pinch of dried tarragon.  I happened to have some jasmine rice in the freezer and that's what I served it with.  I does yeild alot of sauce, I'm going to try serving it on pastry shells tonight.

This is absolutely fabulous!! My husband and I both loved it. For the people who said it was bland, or anything else, don't blame the author if you don't know how to season your own food. Everybody likes something different - you should know what you like. And if you change more than one or two ingredients, post your own recipe (unless your giving substitutions for a less fattening version) ! It is annoying to see people change 5 things on a recipe and then give it 2 stars. The bones of this recipe are excellent. Season it to your liking.

As with most recipes that I search, I read the ingredients ( to make sure I have them or something comparable!) and I always read the reviews to sea how it turned out. In this one, I agreed with Naples and skipped the cheese (also of Italian descent!). Didn't have  sherry so I used white wine and while  the sauce was thick when it went in, it thinned  a bit- probs from the wine- so I threw a handful of panko breadcrumbs at the end and broiled it for a minute. The shrimp added a nice flavor and texture. Thanks!

Very good! I used the condensed milk as a few users suggested. I added some spinach and baby tomatoes for some extra vegetables. For a bit of spice and colour, I added a bit of hot pimento paste (Ferma). Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  I asked my mother what she wanted for supper and this is what she picked.   We both loved it.   I made a few changes, primarily because the sauce kept reducing too fast while I was trying to get other things done in the kitchen.   I just added some white cooking wine and some of the broth left over from boiling the shrimp.    In the future, I might skip the cornstarch.  The sauce doesn't seem to need help thickening.  The cream reduces quickly on its own.  As for the dill, I took the advice of others  and only used half of it.   However, after tasting the sauce,  I ended up adding the remaining amount.   I have to side with the author of the recipe on this one.   I found the 1 tablespoon of dill to be just right.    Overall, this dish was easy to prepare and pretty tasty.   I will make it again.

We liked this, but didn't love it. Hubby thought it was bland. The only change I made was to use rosemary instead of dill because I don't care for dill.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make one minor change - in lieu of the parsley, I added a cup of fresh, chopped spinach to the sauce before pouring over the cod and baking.  The next time I make this, I think I will add a little cayenne pepper to the sauce.  My wife would like this added to the dinner rotation!

Never knew that frozen cod could taste so good!  I did make adjustments for available ingredients and personal preference.  The idea, basic ingredients and technique presented in the recipe are awesome.  I would not have thought of using cod like this but I am sure glade the author did!

I made this with some low calorie  substitutions.  I used skim milk and an organic herb seasoning instead of the dill.  I'm not a fan of dill and it turned out fantastic!  I will definitely make this again.

Very delicious!  I did substitute 1/2 cup milk for the cream and used half and half for the rest of the "cream" ingredient.  Because my sauce was a bit more runny due to the milk replacement, I had plenty of sauce  for the dish and it still was very rich.

I can't give this five stars because I made some changes based on other reviews.  I cut back on the garlic as we are not big fans, sauteed the mushrooms with the onions, used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream, added some tarragon and cut back on the dill, used shredded Italian four cheese and baked uncovered.  My husband loved this version.  Will definitely make this again.

I give this only 3 stars because I had to do a lot of tweaking of this recipe.  The sauce was way too bland so I added about 2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning, more garlic, and some crab meat for extra flavor.  The sauce was great until it baked in the dish with the cod which made it extremely runny.  If you plan to make this, make sure the sauce is too thick so the liquid from the fish mixes when baked and turns out a nice consistancy.

nice, very nice! we added a can of cream of mushroom and 2t of red pepper flakes (also salt & peppered the fish before topping with sauce).  Not much changed but tasted wonderful and we didnt find it to be watery at all and full of flavor (we, of course, like dill ;oD ) thank you for the recipe!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this meal. I lowered the fat in this recipe by substituting the heavy cream, milk, and cornstarch with low fat cream mushroom soup. As others noted, the final product came out a bit watery so I broiled the dish uncovered for anther 10 min. I also added finely chopped fresh broccoli and used potabello mushrooms. Instead of rice I used sauted potatoes with rosemary, oilive oil, and garlic. It was nice, but I think next time I'll stick to using wild rice as it would soak up the sauce better. Thanx for this recipe!

Delicious! I used parsley instead of dill, served it with wild rice and sauteed string beans. Definitely a keeper. Watch the cornstarch to make sure it doesn't get lumpy!

I'm an old fella, and learning to cook.  But I gotta say, this was easy and really tasty.  I'm taking care of two teen age boys and they agree.  Greeeeat!
