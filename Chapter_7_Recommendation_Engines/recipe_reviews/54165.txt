Makes the perfect light appetizer/snack! I took the advice of others & threw in an extra handful of parm, just because i love cheese. I also toasted the bread w/ a drizzle of olive oil & a sprinkle of garlic powder, dried basil & parsley. Irresistable! Thank you!

Absolutely delicious. I experimented with this several ways, i.e. untoasted bread, toasted, putting the topping on top of untoasted bread and heating all the ingredients. All work but the toasted bread, cool toppings was best in our opinion. I also did a batch omitting the tomatoes and this was great as well. Love this recipe. Plan on making a huge batch and keeping it in the refrigerator for even a quicker appetizer. Very easy and quick. THANK YOU!

I made this for a bridal shower, and it was a hit.  I prepared the tomato mix the night before and toasted the bread about 15 minutes before the party started.  I liked the cold mix on the warm bread.  I also appreciated that this could be prepared the day before!

The only real way to serve this without the bread getting moist at all is to deseed the tomatoes and dice up the tomato flesh only. This is the only way that real Italian restaurants would serve it. Rub the sliced bread with a slice of garlic. Lightly toast the bread under a grill. Retreave bread from grill and place toppings on except the olive oil. Lastly, drizzle lightly over all with a little, but good, olive oil. Serve immediately.

I served this at a dinner party last night and everyone loved it!  I had read the "most helpful" reviews to get tips and did the following.  Cut Roma tomatoes in half and spoon out seeds.  Lay halves down on paper towels to drain while making and mixing the other ingredients.  I used measurements as per the recipe and I used really good, 18 year aged, balsamic vinegar (that, I think, was key to making this taste so good!).   Next, I chopped tomatoes and mixed everything and refrigerated.  I made the toasted slices by brushing olive oil on them, sprinkling each with garlic powder and Italian herbs, then toasted on a cookie sheet under the broiler.  I let my guests spoon on the brushetta to the toast so they could take as little or much as they wanted.  I noticed the mounds of brushetta grow on their toasts after they tasted it!  Really great recipe; a keeper!

I made this exactly as written except I tripled it(needed to serve 22 people)and it was PERFECT! I served this on Panetini Toast(from Costco). I suggest squeezing most of the liquid out of each tomato before chopping.You don't want to have too much liquid diluting the ingredients and making the bread soggy.

This is great!  I added 1/2 red onion though...and it was just enough.  Also, I spooned the mixture onto the slices bread and baked it in the oven for 10 minutes...perfect.  Enjoy!

Great Recipe.  I disagree with those who advise others to seed the tomatoes.  The true flavor of the bruschetta is on the "sauce" that forms from the tomatoes'juices, olive oil, and seasonings marinating together.  To keep the bread from getting soggy, make sure it is well toasted, and use a slotted spoon to serve, if desired.  At our house, we fight for those last juices--to sop them up with a crusty baguette is Heaven!

This was really good although it was a little bland - I threw in some balsamic viniagrette in the morning and it was awesome.  I used this in a sandwich with really good ciabatta bread, proscuitto, and fresh mozzarella.  Mmm.

This is awesome!  The only things that I added was 1/4 of a diced sweet onion (a Vidalia), and I just topped my bruschetta pieces w/the parmesan as opposed to adding it to the mix.  The balsamic vinegar gives it a bite that you don't get otherwise.  Thanks Kathy!

Excellent!  Served on top of toasted whole wheat baguette slices that were brushed with olive oil and garlic. I also added a little extra basil as I love the flavor.  Have also served this on top of slices of fresh mozarella cheese...equally as good!

Excellent.  I used 2- 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes instead of 8 roma tomatoes.  Added about 1/4 cup of chopped red onion too.  Everyone loved it.  No one could believe that I used canned tomatoes either!  Excellent!  I sprayed olive oil cooking spray on french bread and sprinkled it with garlic powder.  I put the bruschetta mix in a bowl and surrounded the bowl with the toasted french bread so that people could put on as much tomatoes as they wanted.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe, I've made one similiar for years. Very important to seed the tomatoes prior to dicing them, otherwise you end up with gazpacho!

I let this sit overnight and then served on the french bread, which I had brushed with garlic infused olive oil. This got the thumbs up from everyone, and one lady commented it was very similar to the bruschetta she had had in Italy. The taste was wonderful but not overpowering, and the combination of the cold tomatoes and the hot bread was very satisfying.

This is delicious. I didn't measure anything I just eyed it. One thing I did add was caramelized onions plus I used ciabata bread, because that's what I had on hand. Very tasty!

This is really good! I used 3 cloves garlic and added some red onions and used more of both the vinegar and olive oil.  I am glad I made it the day before I needed it because at first it really didn't taste like much but after sitting in the fridge overnight it looked, smelled and tasted awesome!!  (I did not add the Parmesan cheese until I served it.)  Definite keeper!

I made these as finger snacks on a night when a group of us were getting together for Friskies (gin and Fresca) at our apartment.  I used a can of diced tomatoes, about a tablespoon or so of dried basil (my supermarket didn't have any fresh basil this time of year), a spoonful of minced garlic from the jar, and regular salt.  I sliced the bread pretty thick (like Texas toast sized slices), coated each with olive oil cooking spray, and toasted them at 350 in the oven for about 7 minutes.  I then spooned the mixture onto them, since my friends wanted it "warmed up."  It was a hit!  They devoured about 4 to 5 slices each and asked for more, so I whipped up another batch, but this time instead of putting the cheese in the mixture itself, I left it out and sprinkled it in a mound on top.  It was pretty good, but I think fresh tomatoes and fresh basil will make it so much better.  Thanks for making me the "best wife ever!" :)

I really loved this and so did my kids.  I put the slices of French bread on a cookie sheet and sprayed them with olive oil cooking spray then toasted about 1 minute each side.  I like more basil than called for and more salt.  But it is easy and delicious and something older kids can help with.

This is the best bruschetta recipe.  I also add some chopped red onion and put everything under the broiler for just a minute.  Just love it cold or warmed up.

Made up a bruschetta bar the other night for a get-together, and this was a huge hit.  I used canned diced tomatoes after draining them in a colander, as they taste better than that hot house stuff shipped a thousand miles or so.  Added one half of a finely chopped red onion, and did all the rest the same.

For the toasted bread, I took a couple of loaves of French bread and cut thick slices on an angle.  They then went onto a cookie sheet, then sprinkled with a little garlic salt and Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute.  Quick spray with olive oil spray and broiled until lightly browned.  I put these out in a big basket with three toppings in bowls around the basket.  This was one of them and it was a HUGE hit.

Definitely needs to sit for a couple of hours especially if your tomatoes aren't fresh from your garden. I also chopped them and then threw them in a colander so that they we not so runny.  Classic flavors, can't wait for my tomatoes to ripen!

I used oregano instead of basil because of food sensitivities, and this was still excellent. Everyone who tried it liked it. Also, easy to make and looked elegant on the table. Thanks for posting!

My family has used a recipe similar to this for years.  We use slightly more oil than balsamic vingegar and serve the cheese on the side so people can top it if they want.  I don't seed or drain the tomatoes...I top the bruchetta with a slotted spoon and then pass the "juice" on the side as some like it a little more moist.  The topping is also a great light dinner or side dish if tossed with some pasta.  I love it with angel hair.

This was absolutely delicious! I changed the Parmesan for Mozzarella cheese only because I had a lot of Mozzarella in the house and needed to use it up. Besides, with the mozzarella, it was like a caprese salad on top of French bread. Instead of mixing in the balsamic, I put the tomato mixture on top of the bread and drizzled the balsamic on top.

VERY good bruschetta recipe.  I made the mistake the first time of doubling the garlic but realized it took away from the tomatoes and the recipe as a whole, so the next time I stuck to the recipe and it was much better.  I did add a little bit of finely chopped red onion to give it some extra kick.  Very good feedback from friends on this recipe so I will keep it in my stack for next time.

This was really a great recipe. I've made this many times before using other recipes, but this one I think was the best. You DEFINITELY have to scrape out the insides of the plum tomatoes - all those seeds and pulp will water it down a ton and you don't want that. I made it as stated and it was great, but next time I'm going to shred some fresh mozz into it and it'll just be that much better! EXCELLENT recipe!

Was a hit with my guests over the weekend.  Next time though I will use a larger choice of bread so I can pile more on.

We all love this!  I place the bread under the broiler for a few, rub a clove of garlic over it, and place the topping on it.  yumm

This was fabulous! I served it at a bridal shower and it went like hot cakes (and this was a group of people who do not usually eat "fancy" food, preferring taco dip and such). I put a lot more Parmesan in the mix than called for, and shredded the cheese quite large. It was by far one of the best recipes I've used off of this site, and will definitely be making it a lot this summer.

I tried this recipe one time and was hooked. I get requests from friends and family on a regular basis to make this.so simple and delicious. I now know the recipe by heart and it will always be a favorite :-) not too oily and the balsamic vinegar gives it just a little "zing"!!

A delicious recipe! I didn't include parmesan cheese because I had other appetizers that included it, and it still tasted wonderful. I also substituted balsamic vinaigrette for the vinegar and oil, and worked quite well. I prefer the vinaigrette because it is already well mixed, and I prefer the flavor.

I recently had to cook for a dinner party for my wife's 30th birthday and the theme was italian. I whipped up this bruschetta and the results were fantastic. Instead of french bread (ie the big loaf) I used a crusty baguette and brushed some olive oil over each slice before baking.

Squeezed out extra juice on 4 roma tomatoes.  Used a pint container of mixed red/yellow cherry tomatoes (color was nice!), cutting them in quarters. Per others suggestion, added extra parm - probably 1/2 again more. Also added several Tbls of small chopped red onion. Delicious!!!  Had a little left over and used it on tamales, with a dollop of sour cream (that's where the saved juice really made its mark!).  Delicious again.  Only problem: it falls apart easily as there is nothing to bind it together.  Several guests wound up with it on their laps.  Next time I might put a very thin slice of cheese (mozz?) on top and slide under the broiler for a moment - but then, that really changes the whole thing and it really did taste great as it was.  Just warn your guests, I guess . . . .

Add onion to this and then use it as a topping for an Italian type sub.  Delicious!  I put this on one half of a sliced ciabatta roll, topped with provolone cheese and heated it through in the oven.  On the other half of the ciabatta roll I put hard salami, ham, and pepperoni also heated through.  It was a great lunch.

Served this at our Halloween party, called it cubed flesh on crushed bug toast...I used a multigrain bagette. IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS, everyone that got past the name had more and raved about it.  This is a keeper for all get togethers!

Adds a kick to the average bruschetta.  I used feta to make it a little more special.  Since I don't eat tomatoes or feta, I'm rating purely on the testimonies of the party guests who couldn't get enough.

I've been looking for a good bruschetta recipe and liked the idea of using the balsamic vinegar. YUM! I added a little chopped red onion as suggested in reviews. My one suggestion: rub the bread slices with a bruised garlic clove before toasting for a slight extra layer of flavor. Garlic brings out the true flavor of the tomato which might otherwise be diminished by the balsmic sweetness.

I started making something similar to this last summer but I used home grown tomatoes that I roasted first and combined with carmelized onions. I combined with the garlic, cheese, and balsamic and then put that on toasted bread.

This was tasty. Next time I'll use less balsamic vinegar and basil- a little too overpowering. I'll also toast the bread with some parm on top then add the tomato mixture. Overall pretty good as is, though. Thx.

Not bad, but not flavorful enough. Use more balsamic vinegar, and add chopped red onion. Let everything (except the parm cheese) sit covered in the fridge for at least 2 hours before serving. Also, use grated parm cheese instead of shredded and sprinkle it on at very end. 

Also, is great with fresh mozzarella cut up into little cubes : )

This was so good, and really easy to make.  The topping would also be great over pasta with a bit of olive oil.  There was not a piece left after our dinner party.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and the guests couldn't stop eating it and commenting on how good it was.  I added a little bit of red onion and because I ran out of shredded parmesan I mixed in regular parmesan cheese.  I served it on warm french bread - not toasted because it's easier to eat that way and it went over really well.  I'll be making it again!

I love bruschetta!! This has to be one of my top three favorite bruschetta recipes that I've tried thus far.  Similar to others I've added extra Parmesan cheese. Also, I added Italian seasoning and served it on a garlic herb Panetini.  It was a huge hit during the holidays!

I doubled the recipe and followed everything except I used 4 cans of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh roma.  I let it sit for about 8 hours- everyone LOVED it.  I will make again for sure.  I also baked the bread with cheese and let people spoon out their own topping.  We were eating it by the spoonful as well.  Yum

very easy and tasty!  Even my 7 year old liked it.  I sprinkled shredded mozarella on the bread while it was toasting and then added the tomatoe mix and then added more mozarella on top and broiled to melt the cheese.  Yum!

I made this with vine ripened tomatoes from a farmer's market.  I adjusted the recipe to taste and let everyone make their own.  Using a slotted spoon helped drain extra tomato juice.  Refreshing - got lots of compliments.

Loved this recipe.  It's very simple to throw together, and delicious as a summer appetizer.  I prepared the mixture as written and tasted it.  It was quite good, and I could easily have served it as written.  However, for my taste, I threw in a little extra parmesan cheese, a few extra sprinkles of salt, and a bit of additional balsamic vinegar.  Next time I might add just a little extra basil too.

This was very good, but what made it even better was adding in some chopped up black olives and just a touch of red pepper flakes.  I thought I would have leftovers, but I didn't.

Although I 'knew' the ingredients to bruschetta...I wanted to double check a recipe.  The balsamic and parm was an interesting twist from what I had planned, but reminded me of a caprese salad.  So- I went for it.  YUM. YUM. YUM. So simple and delicious! I just ate about a cup of it with a spoon!  The only thing I did different was blanch the tomatoes and peel them....well, and didn't make it to cutting the bread first. mmmmmmmmmm

This is exactly how I have made my bruschetta for years, except I like mine more soupy so I use about 2 Tbs EVOO and 3 Tbs Balsamic Vinegar.  YUM!!

i thought this was just an OK recipe. i tried a simpler bruschetta with tomato, olive oil and basil before and it seemed like less is more. this had so many ingredients, but there was no unified unique taste. i will stick to the simple version from now on.

I've been making this for about 3 years now and I don't think I ever reviewed this fantastic recipe.  Everytime I make this it's a hit...even with my hubby who really doesn't like tomatoes.  I used baguette when I made it today..toasted it...drizzled with more olive oil...put bruschetta on top...returned to toaster oven on broil with a sprinkling of mozzarella.  Couldn't be more delicious or easy.

What a flavorful bruschetta. Best left overnight to soak up the flavors. I am a big one to subsitute fresh herbs for dried and of course, this is not one of those times, you must use fresh basil!

This bruschetta was outstanding.  The basil really made it pop, but fresh basil is key!  I followed the recipe exactly, but left out the cheese.  I sliced my french bread on the diagonal, brushed the sides with a touch of olive oil and toasted them lightly in the oven.  After they were cooled, I rubbed a cut garlic clove over one side to give it a very nice taste.  We had a very nice bottle of Olive Oil on the table to top the bruschetta and I found this to be sublime.  I thought the next time I would cut up some mozzerella into small (very tiny) cubes and add to the bruschetta, but if you have leftovers, it might not hold up well.  My son came out at 10PM later that night and grabbed the leftovers with triscut crackers and ate the rest.  It was delicious and the recipe is a real keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This was easy to make but I felt it needed more flavor. I added a little more vinegar and garlic along with 1/2 a red onion.  I also brushed the french bread with an olive oil made with garlic, basil and parsley before toasting. It worked well. One other change I made is less basil(as I am not a huge fan of overwhelming basil flavor). This was a good base to work with even though I changed it quite a bit. Thanks for the help.

This is a really good, simple recipe -- great for company. When dicing the tomatoes, make sure the chunks aren't too big, otherwise it's kind of messy to eat. I've made with powdered instead of shredded Parmesan, works just fine!

Very very good.  Low in fat and the balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese give it a lot of flavour.  I will be making this often this summer.

Easy and good but it lacked flavor.  I added garlic salt to the top and the ended up adding pesto too for more flavor.

Love this except I prefer to switch the quantities of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, as I like just a touch of the vinegar flavor.   Tried this several ways, but my favorite version was to grate maybe a third of a clove of garlic into the tomatoes, then scrape the remaining piece of garlic onto the toasted bread.  Yum!

Made this with some home grown tomatoes gifted to me and it was amazing! Obviously, the quality of tomato will affect the outcome. This is such a pretty and simple appetizer to make. I used a balsamic reduction for a more intense flavor and perhaps, a bit more garlic but I would make this again anytime I had some nice tomatoes available.  Enjoyed it very much!

For the most part, I loved the balance of flavors.  I did add more garlic (personal preference).  Also - need to deseed the tomatoes before you begin or it's too soupy.

Great with these modifications:  Add some chopped red onion and do not include cheese in bruschetta.  Serve over toasted bread then sprinkle with parmesan and add a few capers to the top.  De-Lish!

5 STARS! If you are reading this and are planning on serving an amazing summer appetizer please try this recipe. I like a recipe when I don’t have to change anything, just follow directions and use the listed ingredients. Only thing I did different based on another user review was that I drizzled olive oil and garlic salt on the bread before toasting it in the oven, I also added shredded mozzarella cheese to give the bread a boost. Delicious, I’m so happy I took the chance to try this.

I just made this and tasted it and it is wonderful! This is my 2nd time making it.I now have it melding together in the fridge for overnight for tomorrow night.There is no reason one has to use fresh tomatoes,I used Petite Diced- 2 big cans,put them in a strainer in the fridge and drained well.But I do feel its important to use the fresh Basil.The rest I followed the recipe,with just another small splash of balsamic. I know this is a keeper and I'll make it again and again. Wonderful dish-thank you!

Delizioso!  I didn't have quite enough roma tomatoes, so I made up the difference with grape tomatoes.  I also didn't have garlic, so I used garlic powder instead.  I served this with toasted garlic-flavored bagel chips and it was a winner.  My husband and I finished the whole bowl, just between the two of us (kind of a appetizer lunch).  I can't wait to try this again.  Next time, I'm thinking of roasting garlic and spreading that on French bread before adding the topping.  Definitely a keeper.

This is the recipe I will use for bruschetta from now on.  I didn't use the olive oil (my preference) and I also added some finely chopped onion (maybe 1/4 of a small onion).  I melted mozz cheese on bread and spooned ontop.

DELICIOUS!  I knew I had to try this recipe after Deb C., Saveur631 and bellepepper reviewed this.   I used fresh tomatoes and basil from our garden.  I mixed up the tomato mixture about an hour before topping the bread to give the flavors time to meld.  This recipe did not disappoint.  It was a nice side to 'Tortellini Bacon Broccoli Salad' another recipe from AR.   My family is looking forward to having this recipe again.  Next time, I'm going to add some red/purple onion to the mix.

Such a nice, refreshing appetizer!  I followed the recipe as written and it was perfect.  I served over toasted baguette brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with basil.  That balsamic vinegar soaks into the toast, mmmm......just delicious.   Perfect summer entertaining recipe.  Thanks for sharing this!

A good start but could use more balsamic vinegar and more time for the flavors to meld together.  I love bruschetta!  Thank you for posting the recipe.

This recipe is really good! One thing is that I added more balsamic vinegar. I had spaghetti too, so on top of the spaghetti dish, I added some mozzarella cheese and the balsamic tomatoes on top..so tasteful and it looked really nice too!

This was a good Bruschetta recipe but you have to like raw garlic! I'll make it again but I'll use half the garlic next time.

Best bruschetta I've ever tasted, and this is after I took a few shortcuts. Asked my wife to pick up fresh garlic and basil, and she came home with a jar of minced garlic and a squeeze tube of basil. I was dubious, but the final product was delicious and received rave reviews from guests.

This was awesome.  I made it just as specified with a little less cheese and with fresh basil from the farmer's market.  I also sliced up a persian cucumber to put a little more green in it.  I sliced and toasted up a sourdough boule and gosh it was delicious.  I'm sure it's really healthy too.

Absolutely love this recipe. Often use recipes from this site, depending solely on the reviews as to if I make it or not. Like many others mentioned, I didn't need to make any adjustments to the recipe. Only thing, I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried, still very, very good. I'm sure even more outstanding with fresh basil.

Very good recipe.  Easy and flavorful.  I served on toasted pumpernickel bread, slicing the larger pieces in half.  Provided a firm, tastey base for the bruschetta.

I halved the recipe b/c I wasnt using as an appetizer served on french bread. I use it to top a portobello mushroom burger. It turned out really good. The brushetta was easy and delicious. I will be making this again when the tomatoes in my garden start to ripen. Thanks!

Wow this was delicious! We made this as our appetizer for our Valentine's Day meal and we couldn't stop eating it! The balsamic gives it a nice extra something that you don't get with traditional bruschetta. I am definitely making this again.

I have made this for years & it is always a hit at the parties!  I grill the bread on our outdoor grill after brushing a good bread with garlic olive oil!  Love the crunchiness & the grill marks!

I've made this dish on numerous occassions and it's always a huge hit! The only thing I suggest is making it the day you want to eat it and not the night before. It tends to get to potent sitting overnight. Otherwise delicious!!!

Absolutely wonderful! I left out the cheese and let the mixture chill for about 2 hours before serving it on toasted French bread slices, brushing the bread with olive oil before toasting. I made a pig of myself last night on this and can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today! Be forewarned, you will have garlic breath after eating this but it's so worth it!

I made this for a girls night and everyone gobbled it up. I added herbed goat cheese to the mix and a dash of lemon juice. It turned out rich, creamy and delicious. I will definitely make this again..maybe with feta cheese the next time. I gave 4 stars because you definitely have to add some extra flavor or it will be a little bland.

Wonderful! My son who hates tomatoes loved this. We didn't have roma tomatoes so I used 3 very large and very firm regular tomatoes. I was weary of a full T. of balsamic so I used 2 t. and tasted it - I left it at 2t. We LOVE olive oil so I used 1 T. Thank you for the recipe!

For additional flavor, use coctail bread that is rubbed with fresh garlic and extra virgin olive oil before broiling.

It was my first time making bruschetta - it came out very good - gotta remember the balsamic gives it a bit of a sweet taste - I sliced the bullet french bread and brushed with a mixture of EVOO and garlic powder and toasted - very yummy - Thanks for a great recipe

I've had many versions of Bruschetta, this one is my favorite by far! Make the night before so the flavors really expand in the fridge overnight. Nice, Healthy snack and fit for company. Quick and easy too!

Yummy!  Slice plum tomatoes in half the long way and use a spoon to scoop out the middle, then dice your tomatoes.   Keeps it from being too soupy.   I also usually top with Parmesan rather than mix in.  If you're making ahead of time it'd be better to mix the Parm in at the last minute so it doesn't get soft & squishy and muddle up the look of the mix.

This is AMAZING! I added half of a sweet onion and did not cook the topping, and oh my gosh, it was the hit of the party! I also made it the night before which helped the flavors to blend. Overall it's easy and delicious! What could be better?

We made this bruschetta because we had a bumper crop of fresh tomatoes, and our Labor Day guests raved about how fresh and delicious the bruschetta tasted.  We only made one change: Because of dairy allergies in the family, we put the parmesan cheese on the side in a little bowl and let people sprinkle as desired.  (Most didn't seem to think it was needed anyway because the tomato mixture was so flavorful.)  We bought a large loaf of day-old French bread and sliced the bread as if for sandwiches, and then cut each slice in half again.  Toasted for about 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees, the bread was crunchy with a slightly chewy center.  So good!

Good, tasty dish.  Made this with minor modifications based on other reviewers' suggestions - with varied success.  Lessons learned:  
The suggestion of adding red onion was very good but will reduce to half of 1/4 cup.
 De-seeding the tomatoes to reduce the liquid was a very suggestion. 
Used 3 cloves of garlic (my idea)  - will cut back to 2 as  per the recipe.  Rubbing toast with garlic clove  adds enough extra garlic flavor.
 As a personal preference, will reduce the tablespoon of balsamic vinegar as it overpowerws  the other flavors.
Will add more than the 1 tsp of olive oil - just wasn't enough.  I guess when it comes to vinegar and oil, I like the oil more than the vinegar!!
Thanks for the recipe Kathy.

Was very good.  I did leave the tomato mixture out for several hours. I made sure to drain the excess liquid from the tomato mixture before spooning on the bread.

Delicious! I placed a thin slice of fresh mozarella cheese on top of each french bread toast and lightly broiled it until slightly melty/shiny. Then I topped this with the tomato mixture.

Not sure why this is called balsamic bruschetta when you can barely taste the balsamic. This is a good base recipe. I added fresh mozzarella on the top and drizzled balsamic glaze on top. Then popped it under the broiler until the cheese melted. With these modifications it was 5 star.

I loved this recipe.  I followed the directions and it turned it great.  I then made it again but I added a slice of mozzarella and broiled until browned.  Yummy!

This was amazing.  Until I tried this, my husband was the Bruschetta lover in our house.  I made this for him, but then I fell in love myself.  Like others, I brushed the bread with a little olive oil and sprinkled with some spices while toasting.  Use a high quality balsamic vinegar and fresh basil.  These are a must.  Mix it the night before so the flavors have time to blend.  Since this made a fairly large batch, I had some leftover.  I stirred it into some angel hair pasta and mixed in a little extra parmesan.  Great for lunch the next day.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.  Perfect as is.

Delicious Bruschetta! I sliced the french bread very thin then toasted it in a toaster oven.  I also let the tomatoes sit and drain for about a half hour after dicing them.  This seemed to help the bread from getting too soggy.

Really easy recipe as well as a great starter recipe. I added some cucumber and onion to it and used feta instead of parmesan. But this was the style recipe I was looking for. Bruschetta is the Mediterranean version of salsa. So I just enjoy add-libbing a bit when making it. Recommend making it.

I made this with a few changes: 1. I used a variety of tomatoes from my garden including Roma, Sungold and Big Boy. 2. I diced the tomatoes and sprinkled with the salt and put them in a strainer for about 45 minutes to get some of the water out. 3. I roasted the minced garlic for a bit to remove that raw garlic taste. Turned out great!

Toasted baguette plain and lightly buttered- delicious for piling a ton of mixture on top. I also sprinkled some breads with Parmesan. Fresh mozzarella balls  make it even more indulgent.

This was delicious! I didn't have shredded Parmesan so I just used grated and it was fine.  I'll use grated the next time.  I made the recipe the night before and mixed everything except the balsamic.  I tossed the vinegar in about a half hour before I served it and it was perfect! I appreciate recipes I can make ahead of time.

Delicious!! Made it for a party and it was all eaten. Changes I made: I mixed crushed garlic w/ extra virgin olive oil, brushed it onto the bread slices, and toasted them for about 10-15 min in the oven. The bread seemed a little TOO toasted at first, but after the tomato mixture had soaked into it long enough, it wound up being the perfect texture. I added about 1/2 a sliced red onion, added WAY more garlic because I don't believe in too much. OH and I also deseeded the tomatoes beforehand -- I cut each of them in half and scooped out the seeds/wet part with a grapefruit spoon, and I think that helped keep the texture perfect. If I had had more time, would have let the veggies sit longer in the vinegar to really get flavorful. But it tasted great regardless!!!

Yummy!  I gave 4 stars only because i made a couple changes.  I made this up an hour ahead of being served and followed the recipie as written but added some onion.  I also pulled a small piece of goat cheese out to soften.  I smeared the crostini with the goat cheese, topped with mixture, and drizzled balsamic reduction.  Served as accompaniment to pasta dish but could have just eaten this!!!  Ty!!

I'm never buying bruschetta from the grocery store again.. I can't stop thinking about it. Next time, I'm adding crushed red pepper.

I thought this was fantastic. It was super easy. I made mine the night before with lots of garlic. This had some tangy bite to it! Give it a shot. I toasted my french bread with garlic butter, them removed it, spooned bruschetta over the toast, added a sprinkle mozzerella and put back in the oven for a minute and them sprinkled with parmesean cheese. Of course I can't attach a photo...

Love this! Even my husband and daughter who won't eat raw tomatoes devour this! I used feta instead of parmesan and it added a nice extra kick.

What a fantastic recipe!  I've made it for several occasions now, and each time it's received rave reviews - and there's been nothing leftover!  The dish is quick and easy to make, and each time I'm amazed at how flavorful it is.  This is definitely staying in my list of go-to recipes!

Delicious!  I made this as one of my Christmas Day appetizers and it was enjoyed by all.  The only thing I changed was putting additional shredded Parmesan over the tops and broiling quickly to melt it.

I think this is a good basic recipe.  I have made it both ways - with deseeded tomatoes and without.  Definitely deseeding the tomatoes is the better way to go from a flavor perspective.  You also don't need to add more garlic, parmesean, or vinegar if you deseed them.  However, this recipe doesn't knock my socks off.  I have "improved" it for my husband and I by putting a layer of Boursin Shallot & Chive soft cheese on the toast and then layering the bruschetta on top.  Now it is a GREAT appetizer!

This was the best bruschetta I've made - and I've tried a few recipes.  I used goat cheese instead because I forgot to get the parmeson cheese - it was a great substitution and I'll probably make it that way from now on.

The gods shine upon this one.  This bruschetta recipe is off the charts.  Use fresh ingredients, of course.  The balsamic really makes it zing.  I toasted my bread under the broiler then added the topping and sprinkled some mozzarella on top then stuck it back under the broiler until the cheese melted. Then bada-bing-bada-boom the best bruschetta ever!

The thought of eating raw garlic was unappealing, so I just rubbed the garlic on the toasted bread. Too many flaws in this recipe.

This was really great---I did an "appetizer" dinner on a warm nite--deviled eggs, bacon wrapped olives, Watermelon Salad, and these on toasted bread rounds--it was super good!  I made all the things early in the morning to let flavors blend--took a bit of time, but when dinner rolled around, toast the bread and you're good to go.  Will definitely do the Bruschetta many more times, thanks for sharing.

Very good, but then I knew it would be!  Tomatoes, basil and balsamic vinegar is just a winning combination!  I scaled this to 2 servings for a snack for Hubs and me.  We enjoyed it just as written, but I also added some shredded mozzarella/provolone blend to a few and popped them under the broiler just long enough to melt the cheese.  Also very good.  I love bruschetta, so I know I’ll be making this again!

I made this as a light lunch on a hot day, and it was perfect.  This was flavorful, fresh tasting and healthy.  I served this on slices of whole grain baguette that I simply toasted in the toaster.   Easy.

Great tasting. Because I didn't have roma tomatos, I just used 2 reuglar big tomatos instead. I wish I had drained more juice before I mixed them all though! I added more balsamic than called, about 2 T sugar, 1/2 medium-sized red onion, 1 t red wine vinegar, and parsley flakes. I toasted baguette slices and topped them with chilled bruschetta. Definitely got more than 8 servings!

We have a restaurant here that serves this recipe as an appetizer but spreads an herbed cheese like Boursin on the bottom of the bread before topping with the tomato mixture with added chooped red onion. Delicious!

Wonderful "summer" recipe for a fresh and yummy appetizer!  I typically add more balasmic vinegar because I love the taste, and use a grated 3 cheese blend instead of just the parm, but the entire family LOVES this recipe!

This was an easy bruschetta recipe, and I followed it exactly, except I used fresh grated instead of shredded parmesan cheese. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make it again, and won't change a thing. It turned out looking just like the photo, too.

I added red onions finely chopped and a little bit of goat cheese either sprinkled on top or spread on the toasted/grilled bread.  Yum!

Delish!  I've made this several times, always to rave reviews.  In a pinch I've used canned diced tomatoes and grated Parm, and it works just as well.  Love it on thinly sliced bread that I drizzled with olive oil and toasted in the oven for a few minutes.  I'm hungry just thinking about it!!!

Solid recipe. Bruschetta isn't exactly hard to make, but the balsamic twist in this one sets it apart. I made mine w/o cheese and added a little more salt, pepper, garlic, and a LITTLE diced shallot. Make sure you dice your roma tomatoes the right way. DON"T use the gel. Scoop out the innards with a grapefruit spoon and discard them. Use just the outer part of the tomato.

We make this often, especially in the summer because it is great with a frosty cold beer.  Instead of mincing the garlic, I like to put the cloves through my garlic press so the great garlic flavor blends with the other ingredients.  Also, for an extra kick, spread some soft goat cheese on the warmed baguette slices before scooping on the bruschetta.  Heaven.

This just popped up on  my email, got it on my phone and picked up everything I needed on my way home from work. I will add a bit, BUT it was yummy.  I had such a taste for some-perfect timing. I never made it with balsamic and it was very good.

I added Cherry tomatoes (because that is all I had at home) the first time and then added Feta the second time that I made it...I love this recipe, it's SO easy and the ingredients are always readily available at home...I definitely recommend trying this recipe!

I love this recipe!! Came on here looking for a simple bruschetta recipe for a party I was hosting and found this. It is excellent! Now I make regularly just for a light snack. My 7yr old daughter helps make it and loves it as well. It's extra good with fresh basil but I have also made it with dried basil. Excellent!!

first time making bruschetta and I was not disappointed! I used a variety of breads and found that I liked mini bagels brushed with olive oil, toasted and then rubbed with garlic the best. I did not add garlic to the tomato mixture. Fantastic!

This was very good and also super fast and easy. I cut the recipe down to 2 servings and had this for lunch. I toasted the bread in a pan with some olive oil. So good!

Yum-O!!  This was good, the whole family loved it!  I made it to use up leftover tomatoes and we served it over pasta.  My husband had it on a toasted bagel the next day for lunch.  Imagine how good it would be with tomatoes in season on toasted French bread!!

Our local restaurant makes the most fabulous balsamic bruschetta and this comes close. They toast long french bread slices in butter and add a layer of goat cheese on top. Phenomenal!

Loved this bruschetta...  The only thing I substituted was I used feta cheese instead of parm and it was amazing!!!  I make it in advance and just toast the french bread just before serving.  Perfect :)

Terrific! My family always loves the Olive Garden Bruschetta and this is alot like that.  I do add a little more garlic and vinegar and I didn't put the parmesan in it but let everyone add as they saw fit. This turned out so good that the doubled recipe turned out to be our entire meal!

Excellent dish. I've never had bruschetta before so I can't comment on how authentic this is, but it sure does taste good! I omitted the cheese and added some finely chopped green onions along with about 1/2 tablespoon extra balsamic vinegar. It tastes great already so I can hardly wait to try it tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was really fresh and light, but could have used more flavor.  Next time I will add more Balsamic Vinegar.

Just the taste I was looking for.  I used regular tomatoes, which I seeded and diced.  I also skipped the cheese because I love the flavor of balsamic and the fresh tomatoes and basil.  Wonderful recipe...my husband and I just ate it standing up in the kitchen.  Thanks!  Luckily we are both eating garlic!

I've made this recipe several times now but am just now reviewing it.  This is SO good!  Home grown tomatoes are a must! I can make a meal of this, yum!  This is a great way to use up tomatoes and basil from your garden.  Thanks for sharing.

So delicious!!!  I took this to a potluck and came home with very little.  I realized mid-way through making it that I had no balsamic vinegar, but this still tasted fabulous!!  I did add a bit more basil, a lot more parmesan, and about double the olive oil (to compensate for not having the balsamic), and thought the flavor was amazing!  And everyone at the party was raving about it, so it was definitely a winner!  This is a great fast, easy , and flavorful appetizer....totally what I was looking for!

This is the best and most simple bruschetta recipe.  It is great! I usually make it early in the morning so it has time for the flavors to blend. It is great the next day too if it lasts that long.

WOW!  This was an awesome recipe.  I have been looking for a great bruschetta recipe and this one is it!  I followed it exactly, except for reading some of the reviews, did not add the parm yet.  My hubby and I sampled it (we are taking it to the inlaws for dinner tomorrow) and we had to put it away because we kept taking "one more bite"!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I did add chives to the mix, however, the basil tomato combination is wonderful on its own.  I used small campari and plum tomatoes.  The juicier campari added to the marinade. I served it with grill bread --bread dough that I rolled out like a pizza, seasoned with olive oil and italian seasonings, and cooked on my gas grill.  Sprinkle with shredded parmesan as you take off grill.  Slice cooked flat bread into squares for serving.  Awesome!

This is how I've always made Bruschetta. Nothing can go wrong with this recipe. Unless you don't use fresh ingredients. Fresh is the key for Bruschetta. Even shred your own cheese.

DELICIOUS!  I made this for an evening get-together at my home and it was perfect!  I followed the recipe to a T and I can't imagine it any better.  I thinly sliced french bread, dripped EVOO over it and then toasted them for 3-5 mins.  Then topped with the Bruschetta.  Yum Yum!  Received lots of compliments-- Will definitely make again!  --Darn it I forgot to take a picture!

This was a delicious blend of flavors! I prepared the tomato mixture with 1/4 of a white onion in with it, and an extra garlic clove. I placed it in the fridge for two hours after adding the olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper. Before heating the bread, I drizzled some olive oil, garlic powder, dried basil, and some oregano over it. It was amazing! Thank you!

Added red onion and went heavy on the parmesan and balsamic (to taste). I think it really needs to be cold and on a good bread.

Very, very good, but I added a little sugar (1/2 teaspoon), since we prefer a slight sweetness. The balsamic vinegar prevents this mix from being on the routine side. I lightly brushed extra virgin olive oil on the thin slices of french bread that I used for a nice took and taste. Placing the bread under the broiler for a few minutes provides a beautiful golden brown color. My son sprinkled extra shredded Parmesan on the top and melted it in the microwave. He said he was superb.

Not bad however it just doesn't have much of a "traditional" flavour. In spite of this it is quite nice.
I recommend using a pane di casa though, not french bread, and also putting olive oil on the bread before toasting it on the grill. This gives it a much more authentic italian flavour. :)

okay so I didnt exactly follow the recipe and i'm sure it would be great as written but this is what i did. I had a batch of Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing on hand (great recipe from this site) so used that to brush on the bread, then I spread with Roasted Garlic (also a great recipe), put under the broiler for a couple minutes then topped with the tomato, onion and fresh grated parm. Put back under the broiler until the cheese melted. Delicious!

Delicious!!! I broiled the bread slices on low for a couple minutes. Than topped with the tomato mixture and broiled for a few minutes more. If you don't want your cheese to look brown, use white balsamic.

So good! It reminds me of an old family tomato salad recipe we love. I combined fresh grated asiago cheese with the parm since I already had it on hand. A little trick my dad taught me is to season the tomato, drizzle EVOO to coat, then add the vinegar afterward. It helps prevent the oil slick/separation. Great recipe!

Nice, simple, tasty recipe - but everyone agreed that it needed a little "extra" something.  A tad more vinegar and salt did the trick.  Will make again with these changes!

I mixed this up and brought in on a little romantic picnic with my husband.  We just spooned the mixture onto slices of french bread I had cut up.  We both thought it was very tasty!  We had wine with it, too, and a few other little snacks.  (I halved the recipe and added some red onion to it.)
Later-  I make this for my husband and I often when we want a light supper.  It is best when you toast the bread, then spread on the tomato mixture (except leave out the parm cheese, and put in on top of the tomato mixture at the end) then toast it again as the recipe says.  A glass of red wine goes nicely with this!

I thought this was terrific. I served it on a black olive filone baguette. I liked it put on untoasted bread, topped with a little extra parmesan, and toasted until the cheese is melted. This makes it extremely delicious.

Excellent as is.  Wouldn't alter a thing.  Goes great with Insalata Caprese II, Italian Breaded Pork Chops, Sauteed Garlic Asparagus, Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe, and Chocolate Covered Strawberries.  All from this site.

This was really nice and easy, and used up my dry french bread that was lying around. I added a bit of feta cheese on top, since i did not have fresh parmesan and it tasted good.

Great selection of ingredients.  I liked the balsamic vinegar. I happened to have some "Johnny's Parmesean and Garlic" so I used that instead of the separate garlic cloves and parmssean  (though they would have tasted just as great I'm sure)  One other change was due to a personal preference...I added more olive oil than what was called for in the recipe.

YUMMY! Thanks Kathy for the submission.

There was nothing great about this recipe. I had to adjust it so much (in terms of what ELSE to add to make it tasty) that I ended up making my own recipe. I was quite disappointed.

Excellent!  I also made garlic toast slices to serve the bruschette on.  I sliced a long sandwich roll into thin 1/2 inch slices and followed a garlic crouton recipe to prepare.  Very good!

I toasted the bread with garlic & butter first, then I put a couple of spinach leaves on top then my marinated diced tomatoes (balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, oregano, parsley & cavenders seasoning) then topped it off with feta cheese and drizzled balsamic glaze on top to make it fancy. YUM!

WOW !  Finally a bruschetta that really has flavor !  I first used very crusty toast rounds; no good.  Go for a slightly toasted piece of bread - you can really taste the flavor this way.  I will make this all the time now !

I scaled this back to one as I wanted a tiny batch after work. After reading reviews I added an onion. Had to use garlic powder cause I was out of fresh but I doubled the sauce ingredients (and then some for the olive oil and balsamic due to adding the onion).  I wouldn’t advise discarding the seeds as someone suggested. That juice and stuff goes with the olive oil and balsamic to marinate the tomatoes. I put the seeds as well as the extra juice from my chopping board in it. It’s needed. This is a simply delicious recipe that trying before marinating in the spices was incredible. Highly recommend but adjust balsamic to your taste as I added lots more but I love it.

I made this recipe, with a slight modification. instead of adding the garlic into the tomato mixture, I rubbed fresh cloves over the tosted (sometimes I fry the bread) bread slices. the toast acts as a rasp and is an excellent way of getting the most out of the garlic's essence into the bruschetta.

I have made this a few times. Very good, I always use the exact ingredients but not always the same quantities. I have used all different kinds of tomotato,basically whatever is ripe in the garden .

Made it for close friends. Everyone loved it. I didn't make any changes. It was quick and easy to make and used the tomatoes from my garden. Will make again.

Fantastic recipe! Got nothing but compliments when I brought this to a cookout. I made it exactly as written except for adding a bit more salt - but otherwise, no changes necessary. I grilled the baguette slices on the outdoor grill for a nice smokey flavor.

This was amazing.   I don't care for parmesan cheese so I left it out.   I had it on the side to sprinkle on for those that do enjoy it.  Definitely seed the tomatoes.

This. Is. Delicious!! The only changes I made were using regular tomatoes instead of roma, and I also used a small pack of yellow cherry tomatoes, chopped, to add some color. I also added 1/2 cup chopped red onion for color & flavor. An excellent make-ahead appetizer that looks fancy but is easy to throw together!

This was awesome! The only thing I changed was brushing the french bread slices with olive oil, and then "broiling" it in the oven on "high" for about 5 minutes!

I made it per the recipe except for a little extra parm.  I also seeded/drained the tomatoes as recommended. The only change I would make next time is using a higher grade balsamic because it is so good already that would take it over the top. Thanks for sharing.

This was easy and delicious.   I didn't have a the fresh basil so I substituted with fresh spinach (salad in a bag type) and seasoned with dry basil.  Topped it off with a balsamic fig glaze.   Everyone loved this appetizer.   :0)

Perfect way to use up tomatoes.  I had some bland tasting winter tomatoes from the grocery store (you know what I mean).  But once I chopped them up & added the fresh basil & parmesan cheese, plus let it marinade for a bit with the balsamic & olive oil this was pretty darn tasty.  
I used some on tiny toast crackers for an appetizer then used the remainder on top of Italian marinated chicken breast & baked in the oven.  Delicious!

This is so good.
I put this on top of a flat bread I buy at Aldi, bake it in the oven with Spinach on top and Parmesan cheese and feta cheese, 
Everyone raves about it.I double the black pepper and sprinkle more on top right before it goes in the oven. I double or triple the Garlic and basil as well.

I heated the oven to 375.  I put the slices with mixture in the oven.  Before doing that, I added two parmesen cheese petals to the top of each one.   Let the cheese melt and served hot.

This was delicious!!!! I made one change: I put my balsamic vinegar in a small saucepan and brought it to a boil. Let it continue to simmer until reduced by about half. Let it cool as it will continue to thicken. I then added the cool glaze to the rest of the ingredients and it added a sweet/tart layer to this beautiful recipe!!! Also, do seed your tomatoes!!

We needed a little extra salt.  I also drizzled reduced Balsamic over the finished product, but mainly for aesthetics because it was great without it.  Everyone loved it!

I added more salt, pepper and balsamic.  I also brushed bread slices with garlic infused olive oil before toasting.  

I took this to a holiday party and it was a big hit.

I will make this again.  Who doesn't love easy and tasty?

I made it according to the recipe, and let the mixture "marinate" for an hour or so before adding it to the toasted French bread.  So flavorful! My husband loved it, and it was a big hit with my book club.

Loved the tomato mixture recipe - got lots of positive comments.  Followed the recipe, served it as a make your own, with options to add, whipped ricotta or the avocado/ricotta mixture.

I loved this so much I’m making it again two days in a row. I made it with Cherry tomatoes last night and it came out great and I squeezed some of the seeds out. I also melted a little mozzarella on top to keep the bread to keep it from getting soggy like a previous poster had commented about.

This recipe is fabulous!
I do add a small amount of chopped sweet onion to the basic recipe and also top the bruschetta with mozzarella cheese and put it under the broiler to melt. A drizzle of balsamic glaze(store bought or homemade) after removing from the oven finishes it perfectly.

Delicious and I did seed the Roma tomatoes. However my Italian niece says you do not usually seed them and also they do not typically add vinegar and Parmesan. (In Italy) That being said we loved it anyway!

Good recipe. I used plum tomatoes from my garden and there was no problem with too much liquid.  Fresh basil from garden too. I did add some chopped onion. I made the day before and refrigerated.  I roasted garlic, added olive oil and spread that on my bread to toast.  I kept the toast the bruschetta separate that let people put their own on.

Drizzled olive oil and sprinkled McCormick Gourmet all natural Tuscan seasoning onto ciabatta rolls, then toasted and loaded on the Balsamic Bruschetta. WOW, very easy and delicious!

I made this for a 4-person dinner party and the host and hostess loved it!  I followed the recipe as written, except for the toast.  I did what others suggested and brushed it with an olive oil/Italian spice blend and put it in the oven.  After burning the first batch under the broiler (!), I was a little tentative with the second batch.  I baked it at 250 for a few minutes at a time but it wasn’t browning enough so I bumped the temp up to 300.  I baked it for about 8 min total (5-6 at 250 and 2-3 at 300), then I popped it under the broiler for a minute to brown the top.  This will definitely go in the appetizer favorite file :-).

My hand was a little heavy on the black pepper so I got a little heat in mine, but it turned out nice overall. I will definitely try again with less pepper.

I increased the salt and pepper very slightly, added 1/3 of a cucumber finely chopped along with some green onion tops and fresh mint leaves. Over the top good.

Made this for a wine and cheese party. It came out great. Next time I think I will use cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes cut in half. They would be a little sweeter  and look great on the toast.

I've made this several time for events I cater - often out of fresh tomato season - most recently Jan 4, 2018.  I substitute Heinz fire roasted tomatoes  and it is outstanding.   Guests asked for take-home containers.   My preferences:  rice the onion (not everyone appreciates  chunks of onion).  Mix dried Basil with fresh when out of season.  Mix and let it sit for a couple of hrs - flavors do change.  Check for more balsamic and salt.   I served the mix in a bowl with toasted crostini on a  platter, self-serve :)

Followed the directions to  a T. It was AMAZING. so glad I doubled this recipe. I recommend removing the seeds from about half your tomatoes to keep some of that delicious juice for dipping. Perfect snack food!

Simple recipe but I think next time I’ll use a white balsamic vinegar.  The dark balsamic turned the bruschetta an unappetizing brown color.  It still tasted great though!

So loved this!  Very easy to make and great tasting.  I very lighted brushed each side of the bread with olive oil then baked it at 500  for about 3 min and about 1 more minute on the other side.  I also added a little more garlic and basil to the tomato because I love them so much.  YUM!

When I toasted the french bread I used an olive oil spray before sprinkling basil and parsley on both sides of the bread. A balsamic drizzle over the top finishes them off! They were a hit.

So simple and delicious. I used red and yellow cherry tomatoes because I had a lot of them in my CSA share this week. I doubled the garlic called for and used a slice of @GalboniCheese fresh mozzarella on each piece instead of mixing shredded into the tomato mixture. Delicious and easy to whip up!

Pretty good, but I prefer toasting the bread after the tomato mixture is placed on top so that the cheese melts a little bit.

Fantastic recipe. Added a little more balsamic vinegar and red onion. Made it the day before however the tomatos did not look as  fresh. Next time will make it the day of the dinner party.  The flavors were amazing.

This is so good. I made it with fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden - the balsamic vinegar and Parmesan makes for a nice extra zing to this.

The balsamic (1tbsp) is too much- too pungent.  I had excellent bruschette in Italy and am trying to match the recipe. Will keep searching.

I cut the recipe in half for just two people as a good afternoon snack. Followed it exactly. Felt it needed a little more salt.

Made it twice in one week because of huge crop of garden tomatoes. So once I did it with grape tomatoes and once with heirloom tomatoes and it was delicious both times. I added extra Parmesan cheese because we love cheese. It makes a difference if you let it all meld together for a few hours before you serve.  We served it on toasted garlic bread but also put it on top of grilled chicken. It was a hit all around!

This is excellent!!  We have made it numerous times and enjoy it each and every time.  We use thick slices of Italian bread, buttered and grilled and top it with this bruschetta.  It is so delicious!

Lovely recipe.... next time we will double the garlic (we both just LOVE garlic), and one thing we did do during the prep, was we diced the Roma tomatoes and let them drain in a colander for 30 minutes to prevent the mixture from being too watery.   Enjoy!!

I had a ton of Cherry tomatoes from my garden and no balsamic vinegar, so I used red wind vinegar instead.  My family loved it! Easy and delicious?

I made this for an appetizer when I was having my daughter's future in-laws over, meeting them for the 1st time.  I made it exactly as written.  Got rave reviews from all.  It made a lot, so I had leftovers.  Hmmmm.  What to do with leftover bruschetta?  I know!  Add a small can of tomato sauce, a tablespoon of tomato paste and heat it through.  Serve over pasta.   Double duty and double yummy!!!

I only had 6 roma tomatoes available and that still worked quite well. Makes plenty of bruschetta and wow is this delicious. So fresh and delicious. I'll definitely make this again.

We had this when we went out to eat and I have been wanting
to make it since then. I added Capers and Feta Cheese
We really enjoyed it. I also put Olive Oil on the bread and toasted it with cheese.  I would have given it a perfect score if
it would have tasted exactly or better than the one we had when we went out to eat.

It tastes really good, but my only problem was dicing the tomatoes. I spent an hour trying to make them small, because chunky bruschetta is nasty bruschetta. I also ended up slashing my thumb nail about 10 times while dicing. Other than that, it's a good recipe.

I didn't have fresh tomatoes and no time to run to the store, so I used canned diced tomatoes.  It was great.  I imagine with garden tomatoes, it would be even greater!  I doubled the recipe and paired it with a mushroom and chive bisque.  Everyone at the luncheon loved it!!  I'm making it again for New Year's Eve.

It was super. Used grated paremesan cheese instead of shredded. I prefer it on the bread then put in the oven. I like it warmed not cold.

I make this all the time and everyone loves it! I pretty much follow this recipe and  grow my own basil which really adds a nice freshness to the mixture. I remove all the seeds and dice up the fleshy part of the plum tomatoes. And I use bleu cheese crumbles instead of parmesan cheese. Another nice zip to the flavor on some lightly toasted Italian bread . I could eat it for breakfast its so good!

very easy and TASTY bruschetta recipe, I have made this twice and followed recipe both times.  The flavors combine very nicely after several hours in the fridge and taste even better next day.  The second time I made this it only sat for 10 minutes before using it and still tasted great.  I like to drizzle a tick balsamic glaze over the top, mmmmm

I followed the recipe and was happy with the result.  We had diced onion available and it added a nice bite (flavor and texture) to the mix.  Tip:  load the mix onto toasted bread right before eating, not in advance as it makes the bread soggy.  VERY satisfying meal / appetizer / snack.

I've had other bruschetta made with tomato slices, whole basil leaves and medallions of mozzarella.  It doesn't taste any better but it is more impressive visually.

I love the flavour the balsamic vinegar gives this. I did use half regular balsamic vinegar and half the reduced balsamic vinegar.  It's a quick and easy recipe that is a big hit.

Love this simple recipe that I follow to the T, with the exception of the tomatoes - I use whatever I have on hand which is generally not plum, as I'm not a big fan. I also seed the tomatoes at least partially.

This is a good basic recipe. It will turn out well if the directions are followed. It all depends on the quality of the tomatoes. I used my neighbor's fresh tomatoes and basil from her garden. It was wonderful.

Because I made a larger batch to can, I added significantly more garlic and had to improvise with a little regular vinegar since I ran out of balsamic...Family loved it!

Did not like the parmasan. The tomatoes made the bread moist when left longer...top the toasts just before serving. Otherwise delicious recipe.

I made this recipe for a neighborhood gathering. Received great reviews from our guests. Even my 6 year old grandson who does not like tomatoes went crazy over this recipe. I made as directed except I added extra garlic. Also used really good aged balsamic.

Couldn't find fresh basil so used about 2 tbs of dried and it still tasted great. Also couldn't find normal Parmesan cheese so used the granulated/dried (whatever you want to call it) and also worked great.

I doubled the recipe, and served at a family party. It was a hit! I did take the seeds out of the tomatoes as others recommended, and made it up a few hours in advance .  Would definitely make this again!

I have made this twice and will continue to make it in the future.  I use whatever tomatoes I have on hand.  Last time I used grape tomatoes that were  processed with all the other ingredients in a food processor .  Love to serve it on hamburgers as a relish or add it to a lunch salad for add zest.

I only had 4 tomatoes, so I made a half batch.  I wish I had had more so that I could have made a whole batch. This was so fresh and delicious. A total hit with the family.  It was gone in no time. I added about a half cup of diced fresh mozzarella and it made it even better. If you do it, go for the fresh stuff. It's much softer and works well with the softness of the tomatoes.

Very good-I like the balsamic vinegar. Made the bread separately so no sogginess. The tomato topping is also really good on pita crackers.

This is hands down the best bruschetta I have ever made!  Made this for my son's prom party and was a total success. I also headed the advice of others, I toasted the bread and used just a bit more balsamic vinegar. Thank you to all!!

An excellent appetizer that is both delicious and easy to make. We changed this up entirely by changing out the tomato topping with a crab dip for a new taste.

I love this!   I used more olive oil and less balsamic vinegar (basically swapped amounts) per my own tastes.  And I had a ton of grape tomatoes so I cut up those (removing some of the seeds but not all) to use.  YUM!  Great bruschetta recipe.  We used it on breads and on chicken and it was delicious.

Great recipe. I used mozzarella instead of Parmesan because I prefer it. I made the day before and should not have done that. Best served very fresh after only 1-2 hours so the tomatoes don't become mushy.

Made it exactly as written, doubling the recipe for the Christmas party I was catering. I was told, by one of the guests the bruschetta was off the charts, she could have eaten the whole bowl.  This was the first time I had ever made bruschetta.

This is a wonderful appetizer.  Letting it sit in the frig for a couple of hours do help the flavors meld together. Right before serving, I add alittle more balsamic.  I serve with the "Make ahead Garlic Bread" recipe on this website.  The bread is warm and tastes wonderful!

Perfect appetizer! As others have said, only use the tomato skin, not the pulpy innards as it will cause the bread to get to soggy. So good!!

I added some shredded mozzerella cheese on top of the bread before toasting. It was really good. Make surr you drain the tomato mixture befor topping the bread.

Holy moly. I'd never had bruscetta before coming across this recipe. And I only did so because we inherited a whole bunch of tomatoes from our wonderful neighbor. He suggested making bruschetta as a way to use them up. The combination of the fresh ingredients was just phenomenal. I think I could have eaten an entire loaf toasted with this atop.

I didn't use the parm because I was putting this on toasted mozzarella. It was perfect in proportion. I did put the tomatoes in a sieve after dicing them to let them drain while I chopped the rest of the ingredients. It was not too soupy having done this.

Yum! Like others, we seeded the tomatoes and drizzled a little olive oil on the baguettes and toasted for a few minutes before topping with the scumptiodelicious bruschetta. Great recipe and a sure fire hit with guests. Thanks so much for sharing!

I loved this! I used some beautiful vine ripened tomatoes, freshly cracked pepper, pink Himalayan salt, and freshly grated Parmesan. I also opted for a fresh loaf of whole garlic clove bread. I was taught long ago that when you use minimal ingredients to always use the best ones.

What to do with all those tomatoes?!  Make this recipe! We made this for dinner with jumbo prawns and Caesar salad - YUM! I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. The balsamic adds such a nice flavor. We will definitely make it again.

This was an excellent recipe!  I made it with fresh beefsteak tomatoes from the garden, fresh basil, and flavored oil and vinegar.  There's a great oil place in Marietta, GA called the Oil and Vine Company that I get lots of unique oils from when I visit the Atlanta area.  I used their basil-infused olive oil and their strawberry balsamic vinegar.  I took other suggestions and cut the tomatoes in quarters, then I scooped out the seeds and mushy center.  The bruschetta was a lot less watery doing this!  My husband says this is the best bruschetta he has ever had.  He was eating it out of the bowl on a spoon!  I will definitely be making this again with all my wonderful fresh foods!

This was delicious and oh so easy to make. I drizzled olive oil and sparingly sprinkled garlic powder, parsley, and dried basil leaves on the french bread before toasting it in the oven. I also added some chopped up onions to the mix. The warm toasted bread with the cold balsamic bruschetta spread was heavenly. I will be making this often, as it is a healthy and simple dish to make for a quick snack. Absolutely delectable!

I love my bread chrispy.  I always split the bread lenghth wise and scoop out all of the bread.  Then brush it all with olive oil and broil it until it is very crispy.  The texture of the ripe soft tomatoes and the crispy bread is the best!

This was great!  I toasted the bread in a skillet using butter instead of oil - yum!  Today I'm going to turn this into a salad, cubing the bread and adding mozzarella, can't wait!

Great recipe! I scooped the seeds out of all the tomatoes as suggested by another reviewer. The bruschetta was perfect and not too wet. Instead of using the parmesan cheese in the bruschetta, I toasted the bread with a layer of garlic and herb goat cheese and then topped it with the bruschetta. The mixture of the goat cheese with the bruschetta was fantastic! Please try this recipe with garlic and herb goat cheese on the bread  because it makes this recipe so much better!

This was such a hit with friends and family.  I took it to a picnic and my family begged me to leave some behind so we could eat it upon our return.  I didn't have time to let it sit and it was still good.  But, upon getting home and eating it after the flavors had had a chance to fuse, well ... it was fanatastic.  A keeper!!

It's awesome!! Try experimenting with the herbs. I tried parsley instead of basil & it turned out quite well. The trick is to prepare the mixture and keep it for an hour or so before eating

I really liked this recipe, but I personally would add more olive oil and less balsamic, as long as you're planning to let it sit for a while before serving. If you don't want your bread to get soggy, let your guests spoon the mixture onto the bread themselves. To toast the baguette, I usually brush olive oil on the slices and broil them on high for a minute or so, sometimes I flip them over and do the underside for just a few seconds as well. When they're cool enough to touch, rub a clove of garlic on them to give it a little more flavor!

Not the best bruschetta I've had, but great for an easy appetizer. You can toast the bread and make the bruschetta hours ahead of time. Just top the toasts right before guests arrive.

So good. Reduced the amount to make a quick salad for one.  Instead of using a French loaf, I tossed with some garlic and herb croutons and left out the garlic.  Can't wait to have again this summer with fresh tomatoes from the garden!

Great recipe, the Roma tomatoes are not as juicey as usual tomatoes and I toast ciabatta bread add a little extra shredded Parmesan no onions for me unless they are just green onions chopped thin. Use a high quality balsamic vinegar and it is fantastic!!

Love this!  After I seed and chop the tomatoes, I put them in a colander in the sink while I'm getting everything else ready.  I toss them in the bowl right before spooning the mixture onto the bread and it seems to be dry enough to keep everything from getting soggy. I had some topping left over the last time, so I put it in a plastic bag overnight in the fridge and then dumped all of it back in the colander for about 15 minutes to drain before making more the next evening.  A little darker from sitting in the Balsamic overnight but just as tasty.

I added shredded chicken to the mixture to make it more of a meal rather than appetizer. It was awesome! That's really why I gave it four stars though.

This is an amazing recipe! It is even great without cheese. I always cringed and turned up my nose at balsamic vinegar, but it is absolutely essential to this recipe. To me, it gives it that "bruschetta" taste. I've made it so many times without balsamic vinegar and it was always missing something and now I know what that something is! One tip I can give is to seed the tomatoes and take out the guts, it turns out more like salsa (not taste but texture) if you don't. I've also parboiled the tomatoes super fast just to remove the skins and that is great too. This is an amazing recipe. Thanks, Kathy Bias!

Fantastic recipe. I added a lot of extra Parmesan and it was just so yummy! I tried it for seasoning and immediately started to chop more tomatoes because I knew that otherwise there would be nothing left by the time the bread was ready... Definitely a five star recipe.

I loved this but I put olive oil on the bread face down then served the mixture on top of the bread face up!  Adding cream cheese or goat cheese is also a way of adding more flavor, not that it needs it!

We made bruschetta bread out of a French baguette recipe on this site.  After slicing and toasting in the oven for a crunchy crostini effect, we set the bread alongside the bruschetta mix, and let people use as a dip.  Had no balsamic vinegar, so used sherry wine vinegar, and had no fresh basil, so used 1 TB dried basil.  It was a hit on our Christmas Eve buffet table.

It's great with or without the parm mixed in (I sometimes leave it out if I have vegans attending the party).  Great to let it marinate for a few hours or even a day, to let the flavors really blend.

Overall pretty good...the garlic maybe should have been roasted or sauteed first because it was awfully strong. The balsamic gave it a nice backnote though.

Love this recipe, but instead of parm, I put a layer of goat cheese on the bread and then add the tomato mixture (got the goat cheese idea from a trip to Wisconsin) and it is wonderful!

THIS WAS SOOOO GOOD. We ate it with grilled chicken, spinach, and feta cheese in as a wrap. Sophisticated, yet even the kids loved it. We will be making this again. 

We used to buy bruschetta from Sam's Club for $$$, but I was able to make the same amount, that tasted BETTER, for well under half the price.

I put the chopped tomatoes in colander to let them drain for a bit first. It keep it from getting to juicy. ;)

Absolutely loved this and my husband just kept eating more.  The only change I made was that I added a minced shallot and chilled it. I also sug-gest using 18-year balsamic vinegar--so delicious! Also I also brushed the bread slices with garlic-infused olive oil, and toasted in the oven oil side down until the bottoms just started to brown.

This recipe was pretty good. I thought it was very fresh and healthy. I love the brushetta from BJ's restaraunt because its soaked in balsamic vinegar like this one. You should listen to the author's advice and let everything sit for 1-2 ours in the frindge to let everything marinate. I served this over a sliced french baguette. wonderful!

This recipe is awesome!  I also put a little slice of mozzerella cheese on top and finished it off with a balsamic reduction that I made and keep in a squeeze bottle in my microwave.  I used the excess bruschetta mix in a salad the next day with some spinach leaves and orance slices.

Delicious! I went a little heavy-handed on the basil & vinegar, and would definitely remove the tomato seeds/juice next time, but these were scarfed down by my family anyway.  I toasted French bread slices ahead of time in the broiler, then topped them and popped them back in the oven for a few minutes prior to serving to melt the cheese a bit.

This was a great recipe.  My 10 year old daughter and I made this very easy recipe on a Friday evening after school.  We did not change one thing and it was simply delish!!!  We will definitely make this one again.  This is a keeper!!!

Excellent, the only way I make brucetta now, the balsamic vinegar adds just the right amount of flavor!

Delicious, quick & easy!  I put in a little more cheese since I am a cheese lover.  This recipe has been added into my regular rotation.

This is quite tasty - a real hit with the fiance.  I actually served it over garlic "texas toast," which my fiance LOVED (-I found the garlic in the bread to be overpowering).  This is a no brainer, but if you have the opportunity to use fresh, garden-grown tomatoes, do so!  fantastic flavor!

This was delicious i cut up the french bread and pan toasted them in butter until they were brown.  Also, i added extra cheese because i felt it was a little too bland without it.

This is an excellent recipe as is, but I spiced it up by spreading a thin layer of goat cheese on the bread before adding the bruschetta mixture. Very good.

Perfect! Buy the freshest ingredients you can to make this light, summer appetizer. I can't wait to make this when my tomatoes are ripe.

Yum!!  I made this for my husband and I to snack on during our vacation. It was a hit with the both of us! The flavors intensify overnight, so it is worth trying to wait before eating. The balsamic vinegar is a nice touch as well.

Wonderful flavor and so easy to make. I had all ingredients on hand. Agree with others to add cheese at last minute.Almost any good quality cheese will work with this.

Great recipe. I have made it 3x in the last two weeks. It always gets rave reviews. I add the cheese right before serving as it picks up the color of the balsamic vinegar and looks like little noodles. Thanks for the recipe.

very tasty.  I did, however, add more parmesean and added about 2 oz of very smoky canadian bacon.  Next time I do it, I'll probably add more canadian bacon and more balsamic vinegar.

I did not put parm cheese in, but when the bread came out of the oven I spread goat cheese on the bread, then top with the bruschetta. Most excellent!

I added chopped red onion as other posters suggested and it was fabulous. Reminded me a lot of Moxies' bruschetta. I served it on toasted french bread. Also was good the next day as flavours intensified but it was runnier due to the tomatoes.

I used too much balsamic vinegar that it turned out a little darker than I would like it to be.  But it was still good.  I have one guest who couldn't resist going to seconds.

This is so easy and delicious! Instead of toasting the bread first, I baked it at 350 after piling everything on top of each slice to melt the cheese! I have made it twice now and dried basil is not a bad substitute if no fresh is available

I followed the recipe faithfully with the exception of using about a half of a fresh mozzarella ball cut into small pieces in place of the parmesean. I let it all marinate for about 2 hours. Really delicious! The juice that the mixture makes is so flavorful.

easy and delicious!  recipe is very large, so unless you are making a full meal out of it or having a very large party, halve it.

A really yummy recipe, however I didn't put garlic in the mix. I rubbed garlic onto the toasted bread and then brushed oil over that and thn added the mix. My mix also had only a small amount of oil as I brushed it on the bread after I toasted it. Everyone loved this.

Oh my gosh...all I can say is YUM!  Made this yesterday for my family and everyone LOVED it.  I thin sliced a bagette and warmed it in the oven with a little olive oil sprinkled on each piece.  Served it right out of the oven with the cold bruschetta on top, it was very good.  Thanks for a keeper!

I added half of a red onion and used some mozzarella cheese (ran out of Parmesean). This recipe was very easy. I am constantly looking for lowfat recipes for my father. He absolutely loved it and it was good for him!

As I am counting calories right now, I am sad I found this highly addicting recipe because it's SOOOO good! I did make my second batch with no cheese and put the topping on crackers though, was still just as delicious.

Very tasty, easy to adjust for personal tastes.  My eleven year old daughter likes to make this recipe.  We serve it on toasted homemade sourdough bread.

Absolutely the best! We had a ton of roma tomatoes and basil to use from our garden, so I decided to try this. It was my first attempt at bruschetta and I followed the recipe exactly.  I wouldn't change a thing. I'll be making this again soon!

This made alot of bruschetta.  I ended up using it over pasta the next day.  I thought it was much better on warm on pasta, than cold on toasted bread.

Absolutely yummy!! Fresh parmesan and basil really do the trick.  I also used Red Wine Vinegar (I didn't have balsamic) and it was delicious!

Absolutely delicious!   I was looking for an appetizer for a parent social and this was a big hit.   I toasted some really good sourdough bread with olive oil brushed on top and that made it even better.   This is definitely a keeper!

I heated the tomatoes in hot water to remove the skins and sliced the tomatoes up while still warm...the resulting bruschetta mixture was scrumpcious...and a huge new favorite at my house.
