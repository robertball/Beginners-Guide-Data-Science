When I make this recipe, I omit the oil and add cream of mushroom soup and a can of peas.   I spread the cream soup on the bottom of the pan, sprinkle the onion soup mix over top, then the can of drained peas, then the rice then the browned chops.  Then pour boiling water over top.    The cream soup mixes with the onion soup and then comes up through the rice and over the chops.   I also use 1 1/2 cups of long grain rice for the 3 cups of water.  Yummy

Double the recipe and added one more pork chop for my large family baked in a large baking pan.  Thought the onion soup might overpower but they sweetened up.  Turned out pretty yummy but the one pork chop on top got a bit dry.  The others that were "under neath" were tender and delicious.  Thank belveal.  I will be making this again

Rice tasty but my thick pork chops were so dry even with 45 minutes of baking with lid on and at a lower temperature . Needs a gravy to eat it and definatly less time at baking.Maybe 25 minutes would have sufficed. Sorry won't be saving this recipe

4 stars for a soup recipe is pretty good although this one is almost a 3. The rice ( I used Basmati ) had a wonderful flavour but was perhaps just ten minutes overcooked. I'd suggest 1/3 cup less water and 10 minutes less cooking. The chops were delicate and juicy but not all that flavourful so next time I'll brine before searing and ramp up the soup mix with a caramelized onion/beef broth reduction. A little extra salt wouldn't hurt either.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was yummy! It was very tender and flavorful, and my rice was perfectly done. My husband and 13 month old gobbled it up. I will be making this again.

I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic before browning.  I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the rice mixture before topping with the pork.  Very good recipe!

This is very good!  Like others have said, it is also very easy and doesn't make a big mess.  I have always done the pork chops, rice and mushroom soup bake, but decided to try something different.  We all liked it very much.  I was a bit afraid the rice might be a little dry without the soup so I made a separate pan of cream gravy.  Glad I did.  The cream gravy was excellent with the rice and the chops!  Hubby said the gravy was a great idea!  I'm sure if I make this again, I will make the gravy as well.  I'm just afraid without it the dish would be too dry.  Overall:  very good!

We really did enjoy. I did add two packs of onion soup instead of one because it was flavorless otherwise. My boys liked the rice the best.

Very yummy! :D I seasoned the pork chops with a little cayenne, paprika, and chili powder before browning.  Added a nice spice to the onion flavor.

I really like this recipe. It is simple, easy for weeknights and taste great.  Instead of using water, I use chicken stock for the liquid.  I reduce the amount of liquid a bit because the rice can sometimes be soggy.  And depending on what kind of pork chops you use, you might need to reduce the cooking time.  Overall, a great weeknight recipe that everyone loves.

The flavor of the rice was really good but my porkchops turned out a little dry,not sure why but I will make this again.The leftover rice makes excellent fried rice with the addition of a little ginger, scallions, soy sauce and a scrambled egg. My husband loved it.

Very good. I'd give it 5 stars, but chops a little dry. I used thick bone in chops and should have checked them at 25 min. Family loved it

This was so delicious, I did take notes from a few other reviews and add salt, pepper and a little garlic powder to the chops before cearing, and bumped up the onion mix by 2oz instead of 1 meat was so juicy and tender too :)

I had a limited pantry and no time to shop, so I had to make a few substitutions and experimented a bit with flavors. I salted and peppered the pork, then marinaded overnight in a mix of balsamic and apple cider vinegar with a bit of garlic. I used organic quinoa in place of rice, rinsing it before adding it to the baking dish. I used about 1/2 cup less water, added a few tbsp of apple cider vinegar to the soup, a couple splashes of liquid smoke, a few shakes of garlic powder, about 1/2 tsp of ground cayenne pepper, and I think I even threw in some Chesapeake Bay seasoning (not sure how much or even why!). Baked 25 mins covered, 25 uncovered, and it was still a bit liquidy, but the boyfriend was super hungry and didn't care! We ate the pork with the quinoa piled on top. It was really flavorful and the meat very tender, and I enjoyed the mix of textures. I'll definitely attempt to replicate this, though maybe with a bit more adjustment and experimentation. :)

I added uncle bens long grain and wild rice and used chicken broth instead of water. I increased the volume of liquid according to pkg directions. I also added a little bacon on top of the rice before adding chops. I used the seasoning packet in wild rice along with dry onion soup.

Yum! This was delicious.  I used Herb & Garlic soup mix and used 1 1/2 cups rice to 3 cups water.  I also pounded my pork chops before I seared them in the pan and so they were quite thin.  They were so tender you could cut it with a fork.
