This recipe was great! It was quick and easy. However, I found that the batter was slightly thick to achieve thin crepes. So I added a little more milk and water. For variation, I added some vanilla extract to the batter and served them with nutella, bananas, whipped cream and syrup. DELICIOUS!

UMMMMM is right Chris! This was incredible and that's coming from someone who rarely eats desserts! I adore strawberries and it's one of the few fruits that I'm not allergic to, so I really enjoyed this. I'm not a whipped cream person, so I used powdered sugar, but the kids had a blast spritzing with the canned chocolate whipped cream. (by the way, I also thinned the batter) And Nan:), LOVED your idea using the nutella. Nutella rocks and I know that my younger daughter and hubby would love it coupled with  bananas!

These will be on my Easter table. Bought ready-made crepes as a timesaver. Next time, I will make them per the recipe. Take the time to make some homemade whipped cream or at least buy it in the can form instead of using Cool whip. Presentation was spectacular -- I put all the crepes on a huge platter and put chocolate covered strawberries around it, dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon. Great combination.

Yum!  A few things though.  Only got 3 crepes - batter is a bit thick - I would probably double the batter and make 4 or 5 (filling was plenty for 4).  They tasted good (the crepes themselves) but could add extra sugar or vanilla to batter.  Melted chocolate works well, syrup or nutella would work too as others said.  Cool whip was fine for us :-)  

They take 10 minutes and make a great dessert.  Batter could be used for any crepes.  Btw, nutella and bananas is a crepe served by a breakfast restaurant called Cora's - it's DELICIOUS :-)

I've never made crepes before but this was easy ( I made a different filing with pineapple) very easy. Oh and I melted some Pillsbury frosting and drizzled it overtop.

I have tried out about three different recipes for crepes, and this is by far the best one. They were so easy to work with and tasted amazing. It was my first time trying chocolate in my crepes and I thought it was an excellent addition. I only had enough batter to make three crepes, but mine were on the thick side so that's probably why. This is my favorite crepe recipe and I will be making these more in the future.

Fantastic! And Easy! For the filling I used the technique of a 5 star restuarant I had worked for. In a frying pan over medium high heat place your sliced fruit of choice-cover with a genrous amount of sugar and pour some white wine- mix up and sautee until your crepe is done! Perfect! Perfect! You dont even need the chocolate.

Awesome crepes, definitely more like eating dessert for breakfast!  I did add a dash of vanilla and next time would double the recipe.  One was definitely not enough for my kids.

I've never made crepes before, but this recipe made it soo easy! :) 
I'm not really sure how using only this recipe would've worked out, first, I doubled it, then instead of flour I used powdered sugar! (It was in the wrong container) This makes for a very sweet dessert, I cooked enough for 1 crepe, and added juice to it from the strawberries I was using. (Delish!) 
After I realized my mistake, I just added the flour to the same mixture, my crepes came out very well! I could've just eaten them as is, however, I made my own kind of whipped cream, added that, and a variety of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and some walnuts.

Really yummy and perfect for Spring!  I did mix a little OJ with the chocolate as it warmed.   Might add a little heavy cream to the chocolate next time!

These were delicious! I doubled the recipe and got 4 large crepes. I used a bit more water and milk as it was a little thick (about 1 cup water and 1/2-2/3 cup milk). I added a little more sugar (about 2 1/2 tsp) and added 1 tsp of vanilla.
The end result was amazing!!

Didn't use the filling so I'm not rating that part, but the crepes were close to perfect with a couple of changes: I used about 2 tbsp. sugar, and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla. They were great, it was my first time making crepes...I served with an orange sauce and strawberries. I'll definitely make these again.

These freeze great. I serve 4 of them with the strawberries. I layer the extras between wax paper and seal them in a zip-top bag. They're good in the freezer for about 1 month.

These were fantastic!  I had never made nor eaten crepes before, but was encouraged to try them.  It was easier than I thought to make these and they tasted wonderful.  I put too much chocolate in them, though.  I guess I got carried away.

I get so excited every year when the roadside strawberry stands open because I know it's time for these delicious strawberry crepes.  I can't get enough!  Definitely double the recipe if there are more than two of you.  I found that it was not sweet enough when I got the berries from the grocery store, so get them as fresh as possible. Although the sweetened frozen ones will do when I'm desperate.  Thank you for sharing!

Tasted much like a sweet pancake. Batter was a little thick. Recommmend somehow making it less thick, then could squeeze a couple of more crepes from this recipe. Tasted good regardless, so maybe you should just leave it alone.

Absolutely delicious -- and the perfect dessert for a small get-together with friends.  Put the crepe toppings in the middle of the table and let everyone serve themselves.  Divine!

I only gave it one star because, more and more, I did not care for the taste of the fake whipped cream. It left this chemical aftertaste in my mouth. I did like the crepes, so I think I will make it again, but with real whipped cream.

This was a great recipe for so many reasons. First, that it was quick and easy to make and I can't forget very tasty! I would defiantly make this again whether it's for breakfast or even a dessert it is scrumptious. I had never made crepes before mostly because I didn't know what to expect and honestly I thought it would be time consuming, but that wasn't true for this recipe. It took me about 25 minutes to make them including the cutting of strawberries and melting of the chocolate. So don't hesitate and make these!!

This didn't taste good at all! Hardly any sugary taste. There's something missing! So we just used pancake batter and it was OK.

Great with fresh strawberries. Quick and easy dessert. Thought the crepe recipe needs to be a little lighter for me, seemed like a chewy pancake.

Easy and a very nice crepe. The crepes are lovely. Not doughy and you can crisp the edges easily (if desired), because of the use of oil instead of melted butter.

my husband made these when he was working at a cafe a few years back. He fused Nuttella not chocolate chips. I would say to just be careful with the amount of Nuttella because it has a really intense flavor. Chocolate is milder  if you wanted them really chocolaty.

Delicious!  My only problem was my crepes were too thick and my skillet wasn't as "non-stick" as I thought.  But that was the fault of the cook, not the recipe.  I'll be making this again.
