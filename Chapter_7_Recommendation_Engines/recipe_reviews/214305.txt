The eclair was delicious even though we didn't follow the recipe completely. My advice to you is that you stick to the recipe and never experiment unless u have mastered the recipe. I really hope that ou try this recipe. Like i said FOLLOW the recipe don't make the mistake I did.

This is soooo easy and delicious!  However when I made it the 2nd time I broke up the graham crackers into pieces as it was hard to break thru to get out of the dish when using the full graham crackers... made it much easier!!!

Wow, this is one of the best recipes I've ever made.  It's so easy, and the finished product is melt in your mouth good.  This is going to be my treat whenever I have to make food to share.
