Quite good! I only made one substutition and that was using shredded coconut in place of the sunflower seeds and that was only because I didn't have any. I thought this was a little sweet (they almost seemed like cupcakes to me, not muffin-y) but the boys thought these were perfect. I think I'd increase the pineapple and carrot next time--for me I like more "stuff" in my muffins--and I think I'd try to lighten it up a bit. Maybe add more pineapple with juice but cut back on the butter and eggs? I bet these would be good with golden raisins, too!

I made these into healthy muffins by using all whole wheat flour. I added a bit more baking powder, substituted unsweetened applesauce for the butter, omitted the sugar and used 1/3 cup brown sugar, fresh pineapple put thru a food chopper, and an extra tsp. of vanilla. This cut the fat and calories way down, but doing it this way makes a less sweet muffin. These muffins have a great texture! Thanks for the recipe.

I live in a dorm with 40 other girls - they all requested this recipe!  I used a little more pineapple than called for, about 11 oz and a little more vanilla.  A complete hit!

Mmm, these are fantastic!  I switched the carrot for zucchini, and used 1/4 of applesauce for half of the butter, and it worked out deliciously.  Next time, I'll have to try the original carrot.. and maybe add some coconut to the mix.  Thanks so much!  EDIT: After allowing to cool a bit more, oh my goodness, such a five-star recipe. Definitely going to try some with berries, too.

Oh My... These have to be the best muffins I've ever eaten! I made half exactly as the recipe states and the other half with a dollop of cream cheese mixed with pineapple in the middle.. Both are absolutely fabulous!  Thank you so much for sharing!

These were not too dense, but not a lot of flavor either.  Skipped the seeds and used shredded coconut as suggested.  Used fresh grated ginger which gave a nice sublte flavor.  Next time instead of 2 tsp vanilla,  I think I will use 1 tsp orange extract for a bit more flavor.  Because these baked up so nice, I think the recipe is worth tweaking.

I changed this recipe to meet our dietary needs, and it was awesome! I used kamut and Spelt flours in equal portions to replace the flour, 1 c unpacked brown sugar, 1/4 lite mayonnaise, a splash of oil, 1 tsp. cinnamon, pumpkin seeds, 1 mashed ripe banana, omitted the butter, white sugar,eggs, and added 2 tsp cocoa.
Then I realized my muffin tin was gone! So I baked it in a 9x13 @350 for just under 20 minutes, or just till the top was not spongey anymore.
I cut it into 8 portions, for a complete breakfast muffin cake, and we have to disciplen ourselves to not eat too much! Thanks for the recipe!!!

These were okay, but I don't think I would make them again. They turned out really dense.

Love these muffins. I made them exactly as written. If you don't have sunflower seeds I think they would taste good with coconut, or double the amount of carrots.

Didn't put in carrot, instead put in craisins.  Love the pineapple and sunflower seeds really make a difference.

Excellent recipe, very moist and flavorful. Used the coconut in place of sunflower seeds. The only touch I added was to mix icing sugar with orange juice and make a glaze which I brushed on after they had cooled for 15 min. Works well if you use the paper muffin cups and actually seals the freshness even more.

These were relly good! Some of the reviews here said to use coconut instead of sunflower seeds so I used both. The flavor and texture combination is perfect with the chewy coconut and crunchy seeds. Delicious.

A little bit pale and dense, but pretty tasty!  Frosted with cream cheese icing and added chopped pecans instead of seeds.

I'm sorry but I did not like these at all, not the smell of them or the taste. I wish I would have left out the ginger carrot and sunflower kernals, maybe then I could eat them.

Super moist and very yummy.  Leftovers are great too when you put them in the microwave for 10 seconds.  I used 4 ounces of cream cheese mixed with crushed pineapple,added a spoonfill in a half filled tin, then topped it off with the batter and baked...it was a great hit!
