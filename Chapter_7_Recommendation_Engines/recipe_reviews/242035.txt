I chose to make it without the marinara sauce as suggested by the submitter. Perhaps I would have liked it better if I had. I used homemade Alfredo sauce from this site that I have been making for years. So it wasn't the sauce. I found it on the dry side and I only baked it for 45 minutes. I don't think I will be making this again.

Love this! I prefer to add both jars of Alfredo instead of adding one after the dish is baked.  It sets up nicely  and plates up with no mess.  For a little added flavor I will add some pesto in the future.  Leave out the meatballs and it's a great side to chicken/fish mains.  It makes a large amount so I used two large pyrex pie pans and froze the 2nd for later.

I made this last night and was pleasantly surprised. It's pretty decent when you are in the mode for something out of the ordinary.

This is an easy recipe and turned out good. I chose to only use Alfredo. I had some extra pasta that I had frozen and was looking for a quick recipe to use it for. This was perfect
