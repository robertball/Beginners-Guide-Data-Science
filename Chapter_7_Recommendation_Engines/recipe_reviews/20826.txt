This recipe did not work!  You can't have the same amount of butter and milk in a frosting recipe unless you WANT it to look like cottage cheese.  If you want traditional frosting, only a little milk should be used.  If you want it more like a glazed, reduce the amount of butter.  What a waste of ingredients!  I scooped some of the messed into another bowl, added more powdered sugar and made a glazed to drizzle on the pie. The rest of the "cottage cheese" went down the sink :(

I did not like this recipe at all.  It wouldn't blend smoothly...I used my mixer and it still looked like cottage cheese when I got done.   I tried adding a little more milk to thin out the consistency and that wouldn't blend in at all.  I ended up throwing the entire thing out.  What a waste of time and good ingredients.  I gave this one star because it wouldn't accept my review with ho stars!!!!!
