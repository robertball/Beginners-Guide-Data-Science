I loved the dirt cake. I will in the future however, beat the cream cheese by itself first or maybe with a little of the butter. When I added the cream cheese brick to the cold pudding with the electric beater it became very lumpy. This was a big hit with my son's class though.

This stuff is AWESOME.  I prefer to 'frost' the top with the Cool Whip, instead of mixing it in, but I'm sure it's great either way.  Also, the recipe doesn't specify to soften the cream cheese, but if you do it mixes in much easier.

I made this several times over the summer for picnics.  Everyone loved it and it's now requested for other gatherings.  Beware if someone else cuts it, they have a tendency to leave the cookie crumb crust at the bottom of the pan.

I made this for a Halloween party and it came out delicious.  I substituted reduced fat cream cheese & whipped topping as well as skim milk--we didn't taste the difference and neither did the kids :)

My sister shared this recipe years ago and I've been making it ever since.  We both prefer French Vanilla Pudding.  To make it go further we make it with 3 boxes of pudding, 5 C milk and a 12 oz. tub of Cool Whip.

Not sure what I did wrong, but I had to throw the cake out. My only substitution was a use lo-fat pudding mix, and my cake turned GREEN.

I love to make this for Halloween in a pumpkin bucket!  This looks great in any see-through container.  I distribute gummy worms throughout the layers and add extras sticking out the top!  
I always request this as my birthday cake too!

This recipe came out tasting better then I expected. I was addicted at first taste. I just thought with nothing solid to chew it wouldn't be good to eat but I was wrong. This is a great desert and easy to make

This is wonderful recipe for any occasion.  This Thanksgiving will be my second year making this dessert for my family and they can't wait.  I have added and additional 1/2 cup confectioners sugar to the filling which makes it a lil more rich, but grown-ups and children alike will love this treat any time of year.

My kids didn't care for the crust - the combination of butter and oreos is a bit unpleasant. I won't be making this again.

This is an excellent recipe! However, some reviewers have said they put the whipped cream on top and in my opinion that takes away from the desert. If it is done that way then it is no longer dirt cake it is simply a parfait. You do not have to use butter to make a crust if you don't want to. Crushed cookies work well as the bottom layer (this is how we always do it). Last, to avoid lumps of cream cheese just beat the cream cheese prior to adding it to the pudding mixture. You can even beat the cream cheese and powdered sugar together before adding it to the pudding!

This is the first recipe that I have come back to the computer to send a review.  This is a fabulous recipe!  BECAUSE: #1) if you have kids, you more that likely have the ingredients in your pantry.  #2) its the quickest recipe to put together!  and last but not least #3) it tastes FABULOUS!   I did not change any of the ingredients, however I would try to incorporate the cream cheese with the milk first and then add the pudding powder.  This way you are sure to get the cream cheese smooth and keep a thick pudding without lumps of cream cheese!  :)

This is a wonderful dessert! My mother used to make a recipe like this for birthdays when I was a kid. I didn't use the butter or cream cheese, it makes it really rich. I also subsituted the whipped topping with 8oz of heavy whipping cream, whipped. There is more than plenty of sugar with the cookies and the chocolate pudding and I think you'll find it is just right with these alterations. However when you take the rich part out you may want to eat more. Everyone should try this dirt cake it is soo good!

When I make this, I have to make sure NO ONE is going to be coming over... This is an "unsharable" cake when it comes to the husband.  He'll guard this cake like no one's business to make sure no one but him gets to enjoy it! :)

This was a very simple recipe and it can be tailored to any holiday or occasion. I made mine as a Graveyard Cake for a Halloween Luncheon at work. The suggested use of a blender to crush the cookies didn't work to well for me, and I have a nicer model. Next time I would probably go with crushing them in a bag or food processor. Everyone thought it was cute and tasted great.

I do not like the crust type of a bottom, it always gets missed in the bottom of the pan. I take a whole pack of Oreo's and grind them up real fine and place in the bottom of a 13x9. I make the recipe filling part as directed however I add 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the creme cheese and mix together before blending it into the pudding. Then I use another half/whole pack of fine ground Oreo's on the top.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that the proportions are off as it relates to the milk. I took those suggestions and used less milk (I literally poured until it felt right - nothing scientific). It tastes amazing and there is SO much we’ve been eating on it for a week!

This recipe is an old favorite but the method has some flaws. Cream Cheese should be softened and creamed before trying to add to the pudding unless you want lumps. More specific measurements on the Oreos would be appreciated....ounces on these packages keep changing! I never had this where the whipped topping was added to the pudding mixture so I chose to top the pudding mixture instead. Anyway it turns out though will still be delicious!

I did add a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of powered sugar to the creamcheese. To the chocolate pudding mix I added a teaspoon of vanilla. Tastes great. Will make again.

I will definitely make this again, though I may soften the cream cheese before mixing, as it became lumpy when mixing.  Using chocolate pudding instead of vanilla works well, too.  I made this for a team of little league softball players as an end-of-season treat.  They loved it!  Thank You!

I loved this!  However, I left the butter out, because it just seemed completely unnecessary.  Why add those extra calories when it tastes great without it?  Layered the cookie crumbs and pudding mixture in a flower pot. A very fun and creative dessert!

This is a very fun recipe for any party/event involving kids! I make it slightly differently; omit the butter entirely and put a generous layer of crushed cookies in the bottom of the pan. Then I layer pudding, cookies, pudding, cookies, etc. till the pan is full, ending with a cookie layer. Top with gummi worms.

Everyone loved this and said it tasted better than any other dirt cake.  I found it to be delicious but very sweet.  I couldn't eat a large serving of this because of the sweetness.  It was easy, and I will use the recipe again.

This dirt cake was a hit! I did make a few minor changes though. Did 2 cups milk instead of 3, used the whipped topping on top instead of mixing in with the pudding, then topped the whipped topping with crumbled sandwich cookies and gummy worms. Very delicious!

I made this last Halloween to bring to work. I used Milano cookies as tombstones. The pudding mixture was a bit lumpy but smoothed itself out by the time it was ready to eat. Everyone loved it and a few wanted the recipe.

We rather enjoyed this recipe, although we made the mistake of doubling it because it sounded like the original recipe wouldn't make that much.  We were wrong.  We ended up with a HUGE bowl that took us nearly a week to eat.  Not that I'm complaining.  It's very tasty, just pay attention to the quantities.  If you don't happen to have a handful of teenager always hanging around like I do, you might end up with more than you can eat.

I think dirt cake is supposed to have ice cream as the filling not pudding...the recipe according to this website did not turn out very well at all...too sweet and too much vanilla.  It would be much better with an ice cream filling or if you freeze this recipe.  I was really dissappointed.

My family loves this cake, and wanted to carry it in their lunch box to work/school, but the crumbs got soggy and it wasn't as good.  Now when I make it, I don't mix the cookie crumb and cream mixture together.  I store them in separatle containers in the fridge and pack them separatly in their lunch boxes. They can them mix the two when they are ready to eat, no more soggy cookie!
