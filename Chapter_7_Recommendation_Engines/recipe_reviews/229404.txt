Fun and easy to make! Only problem I came across was the oreo crumb bottom did not hold together. What a disapointment.

It was really easy to make.  I made the spider legs out of chocolate Twizzlers so they were pretty stiff.

Turned out Great! This recipe was super easy to make and it was delicious!  22 Oreos didn't quite make it to the edges of the pizza pan, so I would probably use a few more next time.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

Such a tasty recipe! I preferred it more when it's been at room temperature for a bit. Everyone loved it at the work Halloween party!
