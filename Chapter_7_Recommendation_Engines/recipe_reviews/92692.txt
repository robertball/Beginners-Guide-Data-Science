I'm just beginning to get into baking and this recipe was very easy and the cookies were delicious!  I'm going to make another batch today!

Pretty tasty!  My family loved these much more than another recipe I tried.  I'll definitely stock up on the sugar cookie stuff and make more for Christmas gifts this year.
