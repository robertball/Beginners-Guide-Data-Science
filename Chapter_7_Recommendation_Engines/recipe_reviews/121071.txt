I think this recipe got a bad rap from the other reviewers... this was DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly, using frozen blueberries, with excellent results. Yes, it took longer than 20min to put it together but it was well worth the effort.

I followed the recipe and it came out brown on the outside and uncooked on the inside.

Well, mine turned out OK inside and out, and it was quite good, but this recipe did not get 5 stars because it seemed very, very time-consuming to me.  I did not time myself while preparing it, but it seemed a lot longer than 20 minutes of preparation, which makes me doubtful if I would try it again.  That said, the results were fine, and perhaps someone else will indeed get done in 20 minutes!  

I made two changes -- First, where I live, it is almost impossible to find blueberries, so I used blueberry (myrtle) jam.  Secondly, two TSP of lemon juice was nowhere near enough to make the icing smooth enough to drizzle.  I added soymilk drop-by-drop til it reached the right consistency.

I made this and it turned out wonderful.  I used some blueberry pie filling and added fresh blueberries on top.  I didn't have cottage cheese so I used some ricotta tasted great.  For the glaze I used 4oz cream cheese and 1 T. real butter and confection sugar and 1 t. vanilla and put this in zip lock baggie and cut the corner off and drizzled it all over.  I will make this again and again!!  NO MORE STORE BOUGHT DANISHES FOR ME!!  I think next time I will make round danishes.

So good! This will be gone soon! I reduced the sugar in the dough to 1/4 cup, the sugar in the filling to 1 tbsp, and the sugar in the glaze to 1/4 cup (which made a perfect glaze with 2 tsp of lemon juice) as I do not like overly sweet pastries, and I increased the amount of blueberries to 3/2 cups. I also substituted whole wheat pastry flour for all of the white flour. I found that I needed to double the baking time, but that's normal at the altitude where I live. In addition, I divided the danish into 12 slices, but, again, that's just my preference. Overall a beautiful and tasty danish!

Much easier to make than I expected.  The dough was easily rolled and maintained its "criss-crossed" shape during the baking process.  I didn't have any problems with the filling leaking.  This was a delicious breakfast item and one I will make whenever I have fresh blueberries available.

Worth the time it takes to make! I had to make a few substitutions/changes due to ingredients on hand: I used strawberry cream cheese and cut the sugar to 2 TB, I used orange zest instead of lemon peel, and I lowered the oven temp to 375 and cooked it for 25-30 minutes instead. Also, I found I had to thin the glaze with additional liquid (I used soymilk) to make it possible to drizzle it over the finished pastry.

I consider myself the worlds worse baker.  I've made this about 10 times now and it is wonderful!!!  It's my number one requested item to bring to office functions or just over to friends houses for coffee.  I even took it a step further and added a brown sugar crumb to the outside.  SUPER YUMMY!  If I can do it, anyone can!

I made this on a whim because I had cottage cheese that needed using and it was fabulous! We had a blackberry/blueberry/raspberry blend, so we used it. And I made a little extra glaze. I also added about 5 minutes to the cook time and it was perfect inside and out. Thanks!

This was amazing.  I did double up on the cheese mixture but that is only because my family loves the cheese filling.  I have made this many times and it is a huge hit every time :)  I even made one with a cherry cheese filling.

Note these are a little time consuming to make and the dough is sticky and hard to work with but it is well worth it when they are done great presentation and taste.... I had to bake mine at least ten minutes longer than it said to... next time I might even try lowering the oven temp to 375 and cooking for about 35 minutes or so... best word of advice just keep on eye on it when it browns up it is done... well worth the work

I made this and it took much longer then 20 minutes, the inside was soggy, the crust was bland, and it DOES NOT look ANYTHING like the photo. This is NOT a danish pastry by any means.

The dough is very dense not like a danish at all.  The flavor of the dough itself if nice.  It definitely needs more filling.  I felt like I was eating only dough. Mine took longer to bake and did leak a tiny bit.

Though tasty, I would not call this pastry. It is more like a dense bread dough.  I enjoyed it but it is not what I was looking for.

This is terrible. I consider myself an excellent baker and this was not worth my time. Usually Taste of Home has excellent recipes but this one was a let down.

This was DELICIOUS. Sure, it took a little longer to make then it said it did, but I loved it. It looks FABULOUS, and has everything thinking you spent more time on it then you actually did. I made it for my mom for mothers day. :) Turned out great for me!
