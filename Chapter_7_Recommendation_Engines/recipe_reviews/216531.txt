I am drowning in fresh figs.  My Dad has a fig tree and I mentioned I might like some.  Now I have three great bags of them. It seems like every time I leave the house, a bag of figs appears on the kitchen counter out of nowhere.  So I tried this recipe with fresh figs instead of dried and it was fabulous!  I couldn't find apple cider, so I used unfiltered apple juice which seemed to work just fine.  I like that there is no added sugar to this recipe.  I did add a couple of cloves and a few slices of fresh ginger to the mix.  I served this over baked Brie with water crackers and we just loved it!  There were more figs on the counter when I got up this morning, so I'll definitely be making this compote again!  I may just eat it alone with a spoon. Thank you so much for the post, snorling.

This is a wonderful compote that makes ice cream  sing and white meat dance in your mouth. So easy to make. I use agave syrup in place of the sugar (diabetic friendly) and fresh picked figs from my backyard fig tree. I cover the pan with a lid during cooking to make a thinner syrup which is perfect for serving over ice cream or other desserts. For serving the compote over pork or chicken, leave the lid off when cooking so that it thickens up. The second time I made this, I did not have apple cider so I used apricot nectar instead - and it was even better! I am thinking about putting some in ground turkey for exotic grilled turkey burgers. With a thickening agent, it would probably make a great apple-fig pie. Since I have an abundance of figs, I am letting my imagination run wild.

Had to substitute water and sugar for the apple cider, but it is still delicious!

I don't really even know what compote is... but what a treat! Next time I would add more liquid, just my own preference. Great recipe!

Subbed orange juice for apple (what I had on hand). Instead of chopping up the figs and apples, I cooked the figs whole and the apples in big slices, then pureed sauce at end of cooking. It was fab and so easy to make! I served it with a pork tenderloin. I had enough left over for a topping for baked brie and as a spread on a prosciutto and brie grilled sandwich. All were delish.
