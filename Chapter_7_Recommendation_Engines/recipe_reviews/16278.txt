I think if you ensure that the meat is at room temperature when coated and that the frying oil is very hot that you will find that the coating adheres properly. It is the difference in temperatures of the meat and the coating that causes the problem.

This was great and is a favorite already. Many had trouble with the coating falling off, while cooking.    Coat all the steak and let set on a sheet of wax paper for at least 20 min. before you cook. The coating will not fall off. Use tongs as another cook suggested .

Just what I was looking for, a chicken fried steak with some spice to it! I dipped each steak in all the mixes and then set them out on wax paper for about 20 minutes, dipped in last mix again and then fried. Had no problems with the breading. Definitely have to serve with mashed potatoes, biscuits and gravy!

You really don't need all the oil to fry these unless you really want a deep fried steak. The spices called for gave the steaks a great flavor. Instead of using just the milk mixture, I made an egg base and then added some of the milk and hot sauce. Once done, I dumped most of the oil, added flour to make a roux and made a nice country gravy to go with the cube steaks I used. The boys loved their Father's Day treat. Thanks Krissy!

I used soy milk because I did not have evaporated milk, deer steak because DH just put deer in freezer but followed the recipe directions.  I laid wax paper on the counter and covered and coated the steaks with the one cup unseasoned flour.  I let it sit for 20 minutes turning occassionaly.  I then dip the steak in milk mixture then the seasoned flour.  I then let it sit on the wax paper again while heating the oil and turning it checking to see if I needed to coat with the seasoned flour which I did a little but not much.  DH loved it but has always loved my deer steak.  I have to say the others suggestions of letting the steak come to room temperature and sitting for 20 minutes made a big difference.
Thanks for the recipe and suggestions

I make this about every other week becuase my husband is crazy about it! Says it's the best he's ever had! The coating will fall off if you don't use kitchen tongs (I think thats what they are called). Don't use spatula. You should also remeber to tenderize the meat first. I use Frank's Xtra Hot Pepper Sauce. I even like to put it on top of the steak when done. Great recipe!

I was sure the breading would fall off like always but followed another reviewers suggestion and it didn't fall off!  I dipped the meat as recipe states then let it sit on waxed paper for 20 minutes then redipped and fried as usual.  I don't usually make dinners like this because I don't like frying but do it now and again.  I didn't use any where near the amount of oil called for in the recipe though.  Tasted really good!

WOW! I used 2 tbsp tobasco instead of 2 and a half because I am a wimp when it comes to spice. BUT- I could have handled all of it. My husband loved them! I served them with gravy or ketchup and either way was pretty good. I also made the gravy with half of the remaining flour/paprika, etc. mix mixed in with the plain flower to add some flavor. Then, I put a few dashes tobasco in the gravy. Wonderful recipe! Make sure to leave the strips/steak sitting out about 20 minutes after breading and before frying so that the breading sticks.

This was a big hit with my husband and a friend.  Just punch to a favorite and they devoured it.  I used more hot pepper sauce than called for but it was GREAT!!  A must try for the meat and potatoe fans!

This turned out very good. I missed adding "salt to taste", so make sure you add some salt.

This was really good and tasty.  i thought this was going to be super spicy with all the hotpepper sauce, but it wasn't at all.  i loved the taste of the breading, but it didn't stick very well.  next time i will try the ideas of the reviewers.  The meat was a little too chewy.

I just finished eating this and couldn't wait to review. It was delicious!! I actually tried both steak and chicken. I love the spicy notes mingling with the smoky Paprika. I have to say I kinda' liked it on chicken better though...  Great Recipe, quick and simple and uber tasty.

This was fine, tasted okay. I won't make it again though. No one even noticed the hot pepper sauce, at least no one made any comments about it tasting different. (I used Tabasco green jalapeno sauce) I didn't like it nearly as well as my recipe, but certainly was fun to make something a little different. I made gravy as well using the flour mix I'd reserved from the batter and served with mashed potatoes. I made sure my meat was really cold when I breaded it and put it directly into the hot oil in the skillet, but I still had trouble with the breading wanting to come loose from the meat on a couple of pieces. I think it really does need the egg in the milk mix to help it adhere as others have suggested, but I wanted to try as written first. I missed the direction for separating the flour into 2 separate cups so mine had seasoned flour for both coats.

I've never eaten or made chicken fried steak before, so didn't know what to expect.  It was okay....I don't think there is anything wrong with the recipe, we just don't care for chicken fried steak.  I used regular Tabasco sauce and wasn't a fan...I think if we make this again I would use a different type of hot sauce.

This was very good, kids loved it.  Made mashed potatoes and gravy to go with.  I didn't mash it thin enough, so had to bake a little before eating, so not as crispy as I would have liked, but very tender and yummy.

This recipe is amazing. I had never made chicken-fried steak before and this was very quick and simple! I did make a few changes, I used pork steak instead of beef and topped the steak with a gravy made out of bacon grease, flour, and salt and pepper to taste.

This just didn't go over well with the hubby, think egg is a must to keep the breading on the steak, use regular milk or water and lightly season the steak itself before breading for added flavor.

Husband said it was as good as a restaurant’s. I never made country fried steak before. I’m glad this was the first recipe I tried - easy, great flavor and easy to follow recipe.

Very good! I use gluten free flour to enjoy this classic comfort dish at home.  I let the meat come to room temperature and the oil to get very hot before frying.

It was disgusting. Apparently the sauce is what makes the steak good ,but if you have dietary restrictions to hot sauce then it is awful without it.

It was pretty good. It wasn't great it definitely needed more flavor. definitely needed to be dbl breaded. Maybe more hot sauce and paprika for my flavor. It's an awesome foundation recipe ready for you to customize

I substituted gluten free flour mix.  It was great. I made mashed potatoes and gravy too. My husband loved it.  Now he doesn't have to go to a restaurant to get a favorite.

Very good! The whole family loved it.  I put a peppered country style gravy on it.
