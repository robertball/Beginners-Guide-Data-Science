When making this recipe, I just use Chipotle powder, or sometimes even cayenne!

These cookies are great. I did triple the chipotle and they turned out perfect. I rolled the cookies into balls slightly smaller than a golf ball which resulted in 3 to 3 1/2 inch cookies. I also used parchment paper as stated in the recipe. Thank you  newman'smom.

Dissapointed that after all the work I put into these the cookies completely flatened out they are paper thin after baking.  I wonder if baking them on tin foil vs. parchment paper would make a difference and I also rolled them in powdered sugar wondering if that would make a difference?

Very good! On the whole parchment vs. foil thing, if you don't have parchment don't use anything at all. Foil does throw off baking. :)

I'm going to bake these this weekend when the Kids are Home. I'll add raisins (pasas) and pumpkin seeds (pepinos). This reads like a keeper!

I was VERY disappointed with how flat these cookies went but the flavor is great! I tripled the Chipotle peppers on my first batch but think that might be a little much for some people. Will only dbl on second batch. (Think I needed to add some more flour when I added more peppers. Dough a little loose.)

Some reviewers suggested dough balls just smaller than a golf ball...NO! Way too big! If you don't want one giant cookie on your sheet, make them much smaller.

Aesthetically, they're aren't pretty but they taste great!

Great flavour, but the recipe was off. I used a cup and a half of butter instead, and that still made them flatten out like a pancake. I had to add more flour later too. Also put the Chipotle (Cayenne in my case) and cocoa powder in with the other dry ingredients.
I didn't have Chipotle, so I used cayenne, which worked nicely. I used half a teaspoon, which was enough to give just a little kick, because I'm a whimp. I'll use more next time around for more flavour.

Loved it! The aftertaste with the chili is tasty and not too strong. I just found it a little dry at the edge and managed to make 24 big cookie with the serving for only 12 but I can't really complain!
The family loved it and I will definitely make some more in the future!

This was an amazing cookie! I added another tbsp of chipotle and it was just enough spice. Took them to work and everyone raved about them. Will definitely be making them a lot.
