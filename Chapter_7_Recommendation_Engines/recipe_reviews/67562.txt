So glad I found this recipe because we do love soups any time of year.  The meatballs are so much tastier than most and I think that is what makes it so special. Thanks for submitting

GREAT meatballs! Put them in the oven at 350 for about 15-20 minutes instead of frying them. Also used turkey instead of beef.

Very Good!  I followed the recipe exactly and only added fresh thyme.  Served it with whole grain sourdough bread and everybody loved it.

Very good soup. I omitted the tomato paste and store canned tomatoes, using 1 pint of home canned tomatoes. Used hot Italian sausage (Roma). Initially I was doubling the recipe, but when I tired of making the meatballs, I just mixed the sauteed carrots, celery, and onions with the remaining meatball mixture, formed it into a loaf and we had a wonderful meatloaf supper!!

I found this to be an excellent recipe but made a few adjustment's. I used hot Italian sausage in the meatball mix and added cabbage in place of the pasta to give it a more vegetable direction and not be as heavy as it would with pasta. The cabbage really add's to the homemade beef stock.

Great soup!  I made a few changes b/c of my personal preferences:  all beef in the meatballs, 2 cans beef broth plus 1 1/2 cans water and 1 beef bouillon cube, boiled my pasta in the soup, left out additional soup and celery.  Will def make this again!

Made it almost exactly as stated. I just baked my meatballs at 350 for 25 minutes. I also tossed in some brown rice pasta to keep it low on the gluten chart. Was excellent!

Everyone likes it, but I think I'm making a few changes next time. Add 4TBS tomato paste instead of 2, use half the onions in the soup, and simmer 40min instead of 30 since the veggies were still a bit crisp, and add a bay leaf to the pot. I used a pound each of the sausage and hamburger, doubled the rest of the ingredients, then used a third of it and put the other 2 portions in the freezer for easy meatballs in other dishes later.

Very good hearty soup recipe.......made using loose ground beef instead of meatballs and 1 can crushed tomatoes in place of paste and chopped tomatoes....very tasty...spice to your own preferences.........salad and crusty bread is all you need for a well balanced meal........great on a snowy day in New England like it is today !

husband gives it 5 stars. I crushed ceasar croutons for bread crumbs. I also baked the meatballs at 350 for 30 minutes before putting in red sauce. If you bake rotate balls 15 minutes. I did not make the soup.

I make this or a similar recipe a lot. It was delicious!
 I absolutely loved it.  I used a little spiral pasta and sauce.  Made some substitutions but the basic recipe is always to die for!

Unfortunately it is not italian sausages in our city and i added instead simply pork, beef and onion to the meat stuff. I don't like celery also.  Indeed really saturated taste!!!

Ok I have to admit that I changed this recipe a lot because I couldn't decide on this one or an italian wedding soup recipe so I sort of combined the 2, however I am giving this a five BECAUSE these meatballs are to die for!!  The only thing I changed on the meatballs was that I used unseasoned bread crumbs because that is all I had and therefore, I added a teaspoon of italian seasoning and cut the parsley down to 1 tablespoon because I added the italian seasoning but again, that was only because I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs.  The rest of my changes are as follows and mainly just so I have a note of what I did.  I baked the meatballs at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.  I left out the carrot because we are not big fans.  I split the 7 cups of broth by using half chicken and half beef.  I brought that to a boil and added a bunch of Kale and simmered for 15 minutes.  I then added 1/2 cup of small pasta (like pastina)  and let that simmer for 5 minutes.  I then put in the meatballs and simmered another 15 minutes.  We thoroughly enjoyed this soup.  Next time I will add a little more broth to accommodate the Kale but in all fairness the meatballs were the star of the dish.  Bravo.

I made this recipe but did not make meatballs (was working with frozen hamburger) so I just browned hamburger, added carrots and zucchini, and finished with parm.  Was so good!  We loved it.  So good with fresh bread.

Great! Used just 1 lb of ground turkey and the meatballs turned out great! Also used about 2-3 cups of beef stock and the rest chicken as that is what I had.
