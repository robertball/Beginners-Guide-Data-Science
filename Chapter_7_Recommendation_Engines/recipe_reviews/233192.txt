OMG.  This is SOOO good.  If you don't start with bd.weld's Slow-Roasted Beef for Sandwiches on this site, you will be missing a major component of this sandwich!  Please do yourself a favor and take the time to get that done.  But then with this recipe I made it according to what we know works for us.  The rolls were first slathered with a bit of mayo and then a bit of horseradish.  The onions, which I caramelized with only butter and a touch of salt, and the garlic added a necessary layer to the sandwich.  I did add a little mozzarella to the buns.  But I cut my meat very thin and added it to the pan with the garlic onions and beef broth/Herdez mixture.  What a perfect sandwich!  I mean perfect.  This will become a staple in our family, and I can't wait to serve this to friends!  Thank you so much, bd.weld!  You are pure genius!

Now this is a great sandwich!  I had to change the method a bit, we have an onion hater in the family (silly girl) so I caramelized the onions and garlic in butter and did the chipotle sauce and beef broth in a separate pan.  I mixed some of the chipotle cooking sauce with mayonnaise and spread that on the rolls.  I put the rolls under the broiler to warm them up and toast them until the chipotle mayo was bubbling. I used very thinly sliced roast beef (slow roast beef for sandwiches on this site) and just dipped the beef into the sauce to just coat it. We like our beef rare so doing it this way didn't cook it any more.  Topped with the caramelized onions and a bowl of sauce for dipping.  This was a delicious meal that everyone enjoyed.  Thanks bd.weld!

Wow, I cannot wait to make this recipe again!  So happy I made enough for leftovers.  I used a london broil cut of beef which I slow-cooked for nine hours w/ some Coca Cola to tenderize it.  Then, I drained the liquid, sliced the meat and returned it to the slow cooker with the beef broth, cilantro, cooked onions/garlic, and Herdez sauce for another hour.  Also, I made the bolillo rolls myself.  The combination of the meat, sauce, and homemade rolls made for a VERY tasty meal.  Thanks, bd.weld!

Fantastic recipe!  I would never have thought to used deli meat for a torta ahogada, but this was perfect.  The sauce is amazing.  I used a softer bread this time for the sandwich, but definitely will go with a more crusty bread to give it the 100% authentic feel it was made for.  Perfecto!

These sandwiches hit the spot!  The Herdez Chipotle cooking sauce adds such a nice smoky flavor, and one heck of a kick!  My husband loved it and ate 2 sandwiches! I DID start with bd.weld's slow roasted beef recipe (also from this site), and OMG - it was so good! I put my new meat slicer to work today (it just arrived yesterday)! Can't wait to make this one again!

EXCELLENT! We are sandwich people, so I knew that I had to make these...The flavors are wonderful! I used 'Philly' steaks in place of the roast beef, but I connot wait to try it w/ the 'Slow-Roasted Beef for Sandwiches'. This was a HUGE hit and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious Mexican twist to a "french" dip sandwich. I used bd. weld's slow roasted beef from this site for the meat, but otherwise I followed it to a T. Just a tiny kick and Sparky says to make this again soon. Thanks for sharing bd. weld!

This was VERY good! I used the Herdez Red Guajillo Chile sauce because that's what I had in the house! But I know it would be good just as written! I've tried 2 of these sauces and have been very pleased with them! It's a nice bold taste with just the perfect seasonings! Very authentic Mexican flavors! This sandwich was so quick and easy to make! Thanks for a great recipe Brian!

Anything chipotle is a winner with us and this recipe was no exception.  I did have to skip the cilantro (personal preference) and I subbed a can of beer for the beef broth.  I doubled the onion and added some peppers from our garden (hot and sweet).  I made the High Temp eye of round roast recipe from this site to go with the sauce. Served on my recipe for Beer Rolls.  Everyone loved it!  Will make again!

Simple, but satisfying.  I did reduce the amount of Herdez sauce to reduce the heat a bit.

Really good. I made this for lunch today and we enjoyed it very much. I did have to change the meat because when I went to get my roast beef it was gone :/ But I had already started cooking so I used turkey. It worked very nicely.  Beef would have been better but turkey worked in a pinch :) I did add cheese. Yummy.

Loved this. I made a venison roast using Brian's (the submitter) famous Slow-Roasted Beef for Sandwiches recipe for this. (BTW - best venison roast I have ever made!) I followed some of the tips Baking Nana gave in her review and I toasted my buns by spreading each bun half with thin layer of butter and sprinkled with garlic powder and stuck them under the broiler until golden in hopes that the bun would not get soggy from the sauce. Since my husband is an onion hater I caramelized them separately so I could still add them to the top of MY sandwich. After the buns were toasted I spread one side with homemade mayo, added the "drowned" beef (aka venison in my case) and topped with a thin slice of provolone cheese (I am sure this makes it less of a Mexican thing but it was good!) and back under the broiler it went until the cheese was melted. I topped mine with the onions and skipped cilantro (not a fan). And these were one of the best sandwiches we've had in a long time. Good job Brian!!

I am not a huge fan of smoky chipotle flavor, so, I used my husband as the judge for this recipe.  He LOVED it!   He thought the spicy twist as a French dip was wonderful.  It had great flavor and the sautéed onions were a perfect accompaniment.  Using good deli roast beef made it a quick week night dinner.

Wonderful! My hubby and son loved these Roast Beef Sandwiches so much, they both ate 2 sandwiches. I enjoyed the mild chipolte flavor of the sauce.  Definitely use a crusty bread to sop up all the sauce. Thanks, Brian for a tasty sandwich!

Our family loved these!  I used the Red Guajillo Chile sauce and added a tiny bit of chile powder since that's what I had on hand, but they were great!  My husband loved them!
