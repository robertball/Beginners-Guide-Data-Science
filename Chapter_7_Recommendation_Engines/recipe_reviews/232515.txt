Really delicious. I made it as written. The only addition I made was to mix a bit of the plain Greek yogurt into the vinaigrette to drizzle over the top after baking. I still used the diced tomatoes. I liked this mix of the vinaigrette and yogurt better than just plain yogurt and tomatoes.
I would definitely make this for company and serve it with a side salad, probably Greek!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Could not find Greek so used Caesar dressing.  Also found a red pepper yogurt dip, so just blending a can of garbanzo beans to make our own hummus.

I really loved these; however they contain so many of my favorite things that I suppose it was predictable that I would like it!  My only changes were to use italian dressing in place of the greek dressing and adding extra tomato on top.  My husband suggested a hummus dipping sauce to go with it, which would be yummy too, but I might just use extra yogurt to save on calories.  Next time I think I would increase the lemon zest a bit as well.  So so good!

Delicious! Made as is, and the proportions were all really good. I found the lemon zest and feta really made the meal. Will definitely make again!
