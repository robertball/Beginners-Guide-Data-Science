Thanks to the reviewers' comments and the instructions about adding "1 heaping tablespoon of cornstarch. . . "  it was pretty easy to see this was soup, not stew.

So I made simple changes:  use chicken broth, not water, for flavor.  Use 2 cups, not 4, to prevent soupiness.  Use low sodium broth, to prevent saltiness.  Add 1 simple pat of butter on top to add richness and prevent sticking (when it reduces and gets thicker).

Problems solved -- basic and pretty yummy.

This was OK but not as good as mine, I use beef broth,(not water)I would add  a can of diced tomatoes, and flour & brown the meat first for thickening, I don't think it calls for corn. just carrots, celery, could add green beans and peas, Joyce

Hi, I put this together this morning in the crockpot for our dinner. About 1/2 hour before it was done, I put bisquick dumplings on top. My husband and I really enjoyed this meal. The flavor was great. Had plenty left over to freeze. A fantastic crockpot recipe. Sincerely, Judy

I was looking for something to make one sat morning & i found this.  Easy,
tasty not really any fuss.  Which is what I like.  The only real fuss was peeling
the potates.

This was good, but I did make a few changes.  I used 2 cans beef broth and 2 cups of water instead of 4 cups water.  I also added a package of au jus gravy mix.  This was delicious with the changes; however, it did make it overly salty.  Between the broth and the gravy mix, I think the salt can be omitted completely.

I absolutely loved this recipe and so did my family and friends, so I am making it again today.  I followed some other peoples advice and added 2 cup low-sodium beef broth and 1 cup of water instead of the 4 cups of water and also added 1 tbsp of cornstarch.

YUM! I like the flavor of the 'broth' part...of course I added a little extra of all the spices and it is really nice. My family likes a thick stew so I dredged the beef in flour and browned it, and added some corn starch toward the end. OH! And I was short on time so I made this on the stove instead of the slow cooker. Used half the meat...I really love how the allspice/Worcestershire/sugar/salt/bay leaf flavors the stew!

As written I'm not sure about this recipe. I used 2 cups of boiling water with low sodium Sprouts Beef broth in it. Had to add a can of diced tomatoes for added flavor. Only used 3 new potatoes.

This was just okay. It had plenty of veggies and the meat was tender. The only thing that it could have used was thickness. My family thinks stews should be more creamier. I didn't realize this until it was to late.

This recipe is flavorless. I followed it exactly, and the result left my daughter (who loves beef stew) asking for something else for dinner!

Absolutely delicious!!  This was my first attempt at homemade stew and it ROCKED!  I followed some of the reviews and floured then pre-browned the meat in order it thicken the stew.  I also opted to use celery and omit the corn.  It all worked wonderfully!  I definitely plan on making this again....my husband is surely hoping I do!  :-)

This is good stew!  I used a pinch of dried bay leaves and a little more of all the seasonings and the Worcestershire.  Mine was plenty thick, but I left it on low a couple extra hours which made the potatoes super soft - when I stirred it some of them got mashed up and thickened the stew.  Will make again.

This was ok but the flavors were off to me.  I don't think I will put the lemon juice in next time, that seemed to be the problem with it.  I used all the water since we like ours a bit more soupy.  But I added beef bouillon for flavor. We always omit salt and sugar in cooking as we find it isn't necessary and adds empty calories. It was no where near as good as the stovetop stew I make from this site.

This smelled wonderful while cooking but it did taste a bit bland-  I reheated it today and put a couple of slices of cabbage on top and put the lid on it.  Much better today.  This is just one of those recipes that is better the next day-for whatever reason.

I haven't made this, but I had to comment, because it's the first time I've seen the combination of bay and allspice in a stew other than in my own stew! I make a traditional stew with these spices. If you don't like this specific recipe, keep the spices in mind for your favorite version of stew, give them a shot- for thirty years I've gotten rave reviews from fiends and family!

If you'll notice there is a giant dumpling in the stew and that is probably what thickened the stew.

really liked the combination of spices in this recipe. Left out all the vegetables as my family dont like them cooked in the slow cooker.  When the meat was cooked i removed it, thickened up the gravy and added the meat back in.  Really nice and will make again. Also a good filling for a steak pie!!!!

This tasted just like my mom's stew! I made no changes to this recipe but I did add the cornstarch at the end of cooking time and left the lid off so it would thicken. Great recipe, thanks.

Even after adding the cornstarch I found this more like a chunky beef soup.  I added a beef bouillion cube and omitted the extra salt to give it more flavor.

A bit potato-heavy.  I used 3 and it was plenty.  Thickened as she suggested but it needed more. Good flavor and super easy with crock pot.  Husband liked it!

Even after reducing, this stew is still very very very wet. It's really more of a beef soup than a stew...Needs more flavour and a thicker sauce.

This recipe is just like my Mum used to make. The seasonings really combine into such a flavorful broth, and ofcourse the slow cooker makes everything so perfectly tender.

This is my favorite crock pot recipe for the first cold night of fall, and for snowy days. There is nothing better than coming home to a house that smells amazing, with a warm stew ready in the crock pot! Sometimes it gets too watery on me, depending on the veggies, so I add cornstarch at the end of cooking. Serve with crusty French bread. Yum!

It was vegetable heavy. The broth was too little and very thin. I had to make more broth and thicken. Won't make this agin.

I made this for 4 picky and diverse adults, all but one liked it - she doesn't like corn. Her loss. A little too salty - I added 2 beef bouillon cubes and 2 packages of brown gravy mix to thicken and add flavor, so next time will omit salt entirely as I usually do. Left out lemon juice - ick. The only other change that would make it even better is to brown the stew meat first.

This stew was pretty good but needed better seasoning.
