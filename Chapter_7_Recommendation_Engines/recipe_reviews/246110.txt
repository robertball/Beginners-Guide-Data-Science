I admit, this was risky since I made it for dinner with my husband and two year old son...  But we loved the flavor and the texture was great, though I will also admit I made several substitutions due to pantry availability...  1 Tbsp lime juice + 1 Tbsp brown sugar replaced the tamarind paste. I added red onion, red, yellow, and green bell pepper (probably 1/4 c total) while the chicken was cooking, and used 2 c cabbage and 1/2 c celery instead of bean sprouts. I also omitted the green onion and oyster sauce. It was a hit with everyone though!

First I have to say it is a long list of special ingredients, which I don't regularly use.  My local store did not have tamarind paste, so I opted to purchase Thai Kitchen's Pad Thai sauce and then I did not by the Oyster Sauce.  Once everything was spiralized, chopped or cut, the recipe went together super quick.  My husband had finished off all the roasted peanuts in the house, so we topped it with roasted sunflower seeds instead.  We liked the result, but our sauce was not really true to the recipe.  The use of zucchini as noodles is a favorite here.

This recipe was A++! I opted out of using tamarind(couldn't find it anywhere), used crushed red pepper instead of chili sauce, and lemon juice bc that's all I had. Added a little extra sugar and oyster sauce since those seemed like the sweeter  ingredients. It came out great and it looks great plated!

Yummy version of Pad Thai...I will say that regular Pad Thai is still my favorite, but this is an excellent veggie alternative and it still has that authentic "Thai" taste.

So good. I didn't bother getting the tamarind paste, I did a Nigella Lawson substitute of brown sugar/lime juice (even amount) and it was sooo good. I would make this again. I haven't been in a situation yet to have to reheat it. I wonder how it will reheat.

One of my favs!  I messed it up one time and added the two eggs to the sauce....made it amazing!  Tired it next time without and was disappointed (i still add the two eggs after the chicken, more protein and tastes even better).  I also make it with double chicken and no shrimp and one tbs extra of soy sauce replacing the two of oyster sauce as I don't eat sea food.

The sauce is what got my attention here, I had all the ingredients for that and added some fresh ginger and hot pepper.  I only had some zucchini and carrots on hand, and added only cooked turkey to save time.  Very good!

Easy and delicious recipe. I couldnâ€™t find tamarind like others, so I substituted 1 tbsp brown sugar and 1 tbsp lime juice (from the comments). We added a bag of matchstick carrots at the end for extra crunch. We used half zucchini noodles and half rice noodles. Next time we will marinate chicken in the sauce

I really enjoyed this version of Pad Thai.  I did not add any chicken or shrimp, since the egg was all the protein I needed, and I used vegetable bullion in place of chicken stock.
I'm not familiar with tamarind paste so I omitted that as well.

I came across this recipe looking for something to use up zucchini and bean sprouts. I had some cooked bbq chicken that I  put cut up and added to the finished dish. So I skipped the instructions with the chicken and shrimp (which I know will work well here the next time). I noticed others also did not have the tamarind paste on hand, which was my case as well. In place of the chile pepper sauce, I added some Thai red curry paste. I just sauteed the zoodles with the sprouts in sesame oil for 3-4 min and added the sauce, maybe half-way thru. The sprouts gave it a nice crunch. I skipped the eggs entirely. Darn, I forgot about the basil, and I had it available. This is a substitute dish where you're looking to cut carbs, etc. It surely looks like pad thai, and the taste is pretty much spot on. I'd maybe add a little cornstartch to thicken the sauce. Great recipe, Andrea!

Sooo very good and flavorful! I added one spiralized carrot for color and did not have any tamarind paste or oyster sauce so left  that out.  I also left out the eggs as I don't like eggs mixed in my food. It was a hit with everyone.

This was great! My little kids even loved it except I made it too spicy for them. I cut back to 1 tbsp chili sauce and it was perfect for the adults but too much for the kids. I'll cut it back further for them next time. I was skeptical about the zoodles but they were great and I don't feel bogged down by a pasta belly.

I used only shrimp and had to leave out the tamarind sauce because I couldn't find it at my store.  But this is my favorite way now to eat zoodles! Was delicious!

The only change I made was to thicken the sauce.  The zucchini made it a bit watery.  Thank you for the recipe will be making it again.

We just purchased a spiralizer and this was our first adventure in to the veggie-noodle universe.  I must say that this turned out very well, and everyone really enjoyed it.  I mostly stuck to the recipe, except I added celery and onion to the mix.  Also, I tossed the zuch noodles in salt and let drain in a colander for a while before cooking .  We will definitely be making this again.

I have made this twice and we have thoroughly enjoyed both versions.  This is a great Weight Watcher dish.  I substituted fish sauce for the oyster sauce.  The first time I made it I did not have tamarind paste.  I cannot eat shrimp so I just used a bit more chicken. The tamarind sauce does add a more authentic flavor but we liked it just as well without it when I substituted a bit more soy sauce.  This put to good use the new spiralizer attachment for my kitchen aid mixer.
