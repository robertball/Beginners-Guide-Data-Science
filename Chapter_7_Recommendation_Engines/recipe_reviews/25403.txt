As for this recipe, try cooking your sausages directly in the pan at the 400 degree oven.  When they are half baked, and the pan is sizzling hot, pour your Yorkshire batter over the top and let them finish baking.  DO NOT open the oven.  They will puff up beautifully.  It also helps to make your batter in advance and let it sit mixed on the counter at room tempertaure to ensure a BIG puff.

Try baking your sausage until it is halfway cooked in your pan in the hot oven.  Then, when the grease is smoking hot, pour in your batter.  The crust does not get high depending on how you beat your eggs.  The crust gets high if #1 you leave your batter out on the counter for at least 30 minutes and #2 if you pour it into a very hot, sizzling dish with fat that is smoking hot on the bottom.    I'd increase the temperature of the oven to 425 degrees and make sure you use a metal pan, not glass.  Overall, this is a good, basic recipe for TITH and keep in mind that it is a British dish, which is historically not overly spicy or flavorful.  This is comfort food at its best.  Cover it with a nice brown gravy, some mashed potatoes, peas and carmelized onions.  Delicious.

I make this all the time and love it. For my personal tastes though I usually add some chopped herbs like basil, rosemary, thyme and oregano or sometimes a little bit of cumin or just some dill. Overall though it's a fantastic recipe and I like how easy it is that I can whip it up in a few minutes minus.

I'm also English, and I made this for my American husband as he's always been intrigued by the name. This was pretty much as Toad in the Hole should be, although I found the batter a little on the heavy side, and not as light and fluffy as my mum's TitH. Maybe I will use a little less flour next time. Also, I'm finding it really hard to find good sausages in the US. Even the 'English style' bangers from my British food store in Dayton, OH, are not terribly good... Anyhoo, we had it with buttery mashed potatoes, peas and home-made gravy. A nice reminder of home.

Pretty tasty, but needs a little something extra as the base is pretty bland.  Adding something like mushrooms and green onions should greatly improve it.  A great base for experimentation.  Do note that it needs to be served right out of the oven for best results.

This was great! I browned the sausages in a cast iron skillet with a little olive oil. (we get our pork from farm-raised pigs and it's very lean!) While they were cooking I mixed up the other other ingredients, beat well with a whisk and let it rest When the meat was finished, I arranged the sausages then poured the batter into the hot pan and put it into the oven. It was perfect. For those who said this was bland - it's basically Yorkshire pudding - it's not supposed to be bursting with spicy flavors! Great recipe, thanks!

my English husband loved this, but i changed the directions slightly to cook it the way his mum does in England:  after browning the sausages, pour about 3tbsp peanut or canola oil into the pan along with the sausages (make sure it's oven proof) and place it in the preheated oven until the oil is smoking hot;  pour the batter over the sausages and quickly place the pan back into the hot oven, bake as directed (altho mine took 40 minutes to be  cooked properly).  We served with Colcannon (from this site) and onion gravy.  My husband raved!

I have a 75 year old recipe of this.  The trick to end up with the "toads" in the hole is to put breakfast sausages in the dish when the oven is cold.  Heat up the oven. When the oven reaches temperature, pour the batter over the sausages.

So I liked this recipe overall.  It was easy, if anything I made it more complex by sifting the flour through a tiny strainer!  I also could not get my hands on decent sausage so I used Hillshire Farms. I sauteed  the onion with Sausage cut into large pieces.  I also used some garlic powder in both the sausage/onions and batter.  After I had that in the oven I made onion gravy like the other reviews.  I used the oil onion juice from frying the sausages and added fresh onions.  The made my rue and used a nice Belgium style beer for the liquid.    In all I must say I was impressed with what came out after expecting it all to be very horrible.  It was quite the opposite.  The only thing I messed up on was too much salt in the gravy...

This is the best Yorkshire pudding I've ever eaten, let alone made! That said I did change it a bit. I browned the sausages in 400F oven with a bit of oil in a cast iron skillet. Then added the batter to the hot pan. Also I made the batter with three eggs and added dried sage and a bit of herbs de Province. Served with brown gravy. So delicious and really filling.

I made this last night and it was GREAT!  First, I preheated my oven, with the casserole dish and a good amount of olive oil, in to preheat as well.  I browned my sausage on the stove, then just opened the oven, plopped my sausage in and poured the batter on top.  This is great by itself, but missing something...you have to have the onion gravy with it!  It's a must!  It was my first time making both, and I was SO pleased by how well they came out!  The onion gravy recipe I used was with a recipe for Bangers and Mash (in case you want it too!).

Not bad, although I didn't quite expect what I got.  Can't tell you what I was expecting . . .maybe more of a breadlike taste?  At any rate, this is sort of like an egg and sausage dish with a slight pancake feel.  I used egg substitute, which tends to be very bland, so I added salt, pepper, parsley, and some boursin cheese.    Adding the cheese and seasonings made it really tasty, but it looks like from the reviews I used this dish in a different way than it is traditional bc I wanted it for a stand alone breakfast dish.  It looks like if I make it for a traditional dinner, gravy would be a good addition and add flavor to the meal.  Bf thought that using cooked sausage crumbles would be a nice variation for a breakfast dish.  I did note that the egg mixture seemed to rise but then deflate rather quickly as it cooled, so definitely serve it immediately.  Also, I should've greased the pan more; although I used Pam generously and used a glass pan, this stuff stuck like crazy so I'm soaking the pan now.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with minor tweaks. I am giving it 5 stars because it was excellent as a starting point.  I added in caramelized onions with the sausages and added some spices and hot sauce to the batter.
Will definitely use again with different add-ins!

I grew up in New Zealand, where British recipes are common. Toad in the Hole was something we eagerly gobbled up as kids! This recipe was enjoyed in our house here in the US. (Being vegetarian, I did use Tofurkey's Topsail Ale Beer Brats - they are awesome and meat-free!) It didn't produce quite the results I'd hoped for though. Although I took care with my batter prep, hoping to produce a nice, fluffy "pudding," the finished product was quite dense. Although it puffed up, it didn't puff up enough to cover the sausages. However, as I said we did enjoy it!

What an easy, convenient recipe with ingredients I already had on hand. I took the advice of another reviewer and browned sausages in a 425 degree oven for 15 minutes while the batter set (half hour ). Also, I put the milk and water in a glass measuring cup and heated on high for one minute in the microwave  (I do that for popover batter to increase popping action), then added to beaten eggs, then whisked in flour. Served with peas, mashed potatoes and gravy. My son really loved his with maple syrup. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was VERY GOOD and easy to make.  I used a cast iron skillet to cook the sausage, then poured the batter (I let it sit for 15 minutes) over the sausage and popped it in the oven.  Next time I will make gravy, for sure :)

I agree with a previous review. You must brown the sausages first in the oven @ 450F. About 10 mins each side. Then reduce to 400F and add the batter.
I also added some salt, pepper & Onion Powder to the batter to make it less bland..
Very yummy served with Onion Gravy, Mash Potatoes and Veg..

Very good & SO EASY! Very versatile depending on what kind of sausage you have on hand. I used maple, apple chicken sausage. 
I did make some minor changes. I put the pan (small round metal pan) with some fat rendered from the sausage in the oven to get hot, then I put in the sausages topped with the batter.

Although this is to be eaten with vegetables and gravy, we eat it for brunch on Sundays with fresh berries, pure maple syrup and icing sugar.

This was so easy to make! and very tasty, my husband loved it with lots of mushroom gravy. I would have liked more dough around the sausages. Next time I will use a bigger pan and double the batter recipe. Yumyum I will make it again.

Like the reviews said, this was pretty bland. But from what I understand its a bland type of dish. I did add a whole onion chopped to the browning sausage as well as added some Italian seasoning. Didnt help that much tho. Thank you for sharing but this one just doesnt suit our tastes. Sorry!

Yummy comfort food. 
I  followed the tip for putting the sausages in the oven  to cook halfway, added some extra oil (sausages were on the lean side),  and cooked it about 10 mins longer than the directions said.  The edges were golden and crispy. Really tasty. Thanks!

I have never eaten or made this dish. I've never even had or make Yorkshire pudding. I used breakfast links, put them in the pan with some onions and garlic and bacon drippings. I did as one reviewer said and put them in the cold oven and then poured the batter over when the oven came up to temp. I added salt, pepper and parsley to the batter. I fried potatoes and made brown gravy. My husband and I loved this! Our 8 year old granddaughter did not. I think it was just too different for her. The Yorkshire pudding did not puff up much and it was pretty dense. Hubby and I still gobbled it up! I definitely plan to keep working on this. Our farmers market makes homemade banger sausages, will try those next time and will see if preheating the oven helps. Stick to your ribs meal and I love the name!

Made a half portion in a bread time. Needed to cook a little longer as it’s deeper, but came out fine!

Always looking for a good Toad-in-the-Hole recipe.  It was quite good but missing salt (which was easily added after being cooked though).  Also, cooked at 425 for 30 minutes and got a decent rise.  I use Johnsonville Maple sausages which adds a nice flavor.  This size only feeds 3 in my house, so a second one should be made for more people. All in all a good recipe, but still searching and adjusting for a higher rise.  :)

Browned the sausages first, I put a little olive oil in Pan and heated in oven. Layer sausages in and poured batter over. Next time I will put sausages on top after outing the batter in.

No real changes, copied the idea of browning the sausages in the tin I was doing the whole dish in, added bit of cooking oil while browning, kids loved it and so do I, will try proper butchers sausages next time instead of supermarket ones.

I made this for dinner, using the suggestions of others to bake the sausages in the pan, let the batter rest first and add it to the hot pan. Even after reading reviews and following directions, this fell a little flat. The flavor was good, but there was not enough batter to fill a 13x9 pan, and it didn't raise up the way I expected it should. This would be better in a smaller pan, or with more batter to fill this large of a pan. I will try again, but be warned your pancake will be flatter in this size of dish.

I have made this recipe exactly as is several times and it works perfectly every time.  This is a great comfort food from my childhood.  I serve it with baked beans.  To change the flavor for variety I use different types of sausages.  My favourites are maple breakfast sausages.

I made it just as directed. I wondered about not spraying the pan with Pam, but didn't know if that would adversely affect the results. Sure enough, the pudding stuck to the Pyrex. Mine did not come out pretty. It tasted ok. Not something I would make again.

This recipe added a lot of room for creativity, it's inexpensive and easy. Because I have no idea where I could get a high quality sausage without some kind of Italian or breakfast flavoringz--I certainly didn't want it to taste like either of those things, I chose a bratwurst. I added some cheddar cheese and a teaspoon of salt theb let it sit out for 20 minutes while I browned the sausage in the oven, 450F, ten minutes each side. I then poured the batter over the sausages and turned the oven down to 400F, baking it for 25 minutes. The flavor was really good; my three year old loved it. I served it like a summer brat with mustard and katchup. I would totally try this again in a smaller pan and if I could find another kind of sausage, with gravy, etc.

I don't know why but when mine came out of the oven it shrunk down so flat--not all puffed up like the other pics?? Also, the recipe didn't say to spray the baking pan so I didn't and it stuck to the pan terribly. So, next time I would do that for sure. It tasted pretty good so we're happy overall!

Very easy to follow! 
I use gluten free flour and rice milk.
I use the Thermomix (bimbi) on 1 min setting 10 for the eggs, then add the other ingredients, including some mustard and a bit of salt and pepper, then give it another minute on setting 10. This gives a light frothy batter that rises really well.
 
I also half cook the sausage in the baking dish as it makes sure the batter in going into a really hot pan.

It works well with any gluten free sausages:)

I really liked this recipe, I added in some salt, pepper and a couple teaspoons of chopped parsley and it made the whole thing a lot tastier :)

It was crispy on the outside, but a little clumpy on the inside for my taste. In future I'll use less liquid.

Wow! this is wonderful!  I halved the recipe because I only had a few little party weenies.  Being that the little weenies don't make much grease, I added a tablespoon of butter to the base.  Yummo!  I also used plain rice milk because that's all i have!

A pretty good recipe for a yorkie batter, I halved the recipe as I only needed enough for 2 people.  The four stars are because I heated the dish and a little oil up in the oven before adding the sausage and batter.  Also it really needs seasoning, I used salt and pepper and a little chilli powder, without it I can see why people would complain that its bland

Easy and tasty, but next time I might just bake it all in the hot skillet that the sausages are browned in.  I originally used a glass baking dish and it stuck all over the dish and was hard to serve and clean up.  I think a greased skillet would help.  Also, I used breakfast sausage links.  Can't wait to try with regular pork sausage in the casings.

Excellent and super easy. Next time, I'm going to make the batter the night before and let it chill, so it rises a little more.

I remember eating this as a child and loving it but it's just not the same as an adult. This was a very bland dish best eaten covered with tomato ketchup. Kind of like baked sausage & eggs. An easy to make and fun recipe for kids so it still gets a good rating.
