I did not like the way this looked with the flour on top or with the raisins and choc. chips together.  Next time I will rearrange the order putting the chips after the white sugar, then put the brown sugar, flour and top it off with the raisins.

I loved the idea of this mix w/ the chocolate covered raisins, but I do agree w/ the other reviewer that said the layering didn't look so great. There was no way to 'pack' the choco. raisins and chips in a way that the flour mixture would not seep through, even a little.  These were very easy to mix up for baking, and tasted great, but I had an issue w/ one pan looking just ok and the other pan all running together into a thin layer (still tasted good, tho). I think these would be great for a bar cookie...just press the mixture into a pan and bake it up! I may try that, b/c they are tasty, just not so pretty. Thanks for sharing. :)
