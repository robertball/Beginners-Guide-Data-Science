I was REALLY hungry and REALLY looking forward to this sandwich.  That being said, it didn't quite live up to my expectations.  I was expecting a lot of flavor from the chile/mustard "sauce", but it didn't really shine through (and I halved the recipe for 2 sandwiches and used 1/2 of the sauce per sandwich, more than the recipe calls for).  I really liked how easy it was to make AND the added instructions for freezing.  THANKS for the recipe!

My husband and I liked these sandwiches. I used 1/4 cup minced onion and 1 tablespoon of poppy seeds instead. Also, I put mayo on one side of bun and baked for about 15 minutes. I froze the leftovers so this will make 2 meals!  Very easy to make.

These were easy to make but I expected more flavor. I think 1/2 cup minced onion maybe too much so I reduced it to 1/4 cup.  Will make again as we love this type of sandwich in our family.
