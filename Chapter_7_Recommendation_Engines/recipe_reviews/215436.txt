I made this as a quick lunch for the boys. I used swiss only because that was what I had on hand. My crescent rolls were also reduced fat. I made a homemade honey-mustard dressing to go with. They made quick work of these roll-up's--they were gone in less than ten minutes. Next time, I'll double the recipe.

Great recipe! They're perfect for a quick lunch or snack. I swear you could put just about anything in a Pillsbury Crescent Roll and it'll turn out great.  I sometimes use Swiss cheese instead of Cheddar, but just about anything you have on hand will do in a pinch. My niece just loves these! She likes hers served with a side of ketchup and mustard for dipping....

This deserves 5 stars from a kid's point of view, but to add flavor, spread dough with a thin layer of your favorite mustard, or serve with honey-mustard dipping sauce.

I make these on sunday and put them in the fridge for breakfast during the week. They keep very well, are inexpensive to make especially when you compare them to the cost of a drive thru breakfast every day. Thanks for the great recipe!

Even though I usually like junk food, these things were way too greasy and salty for me.  They would be a fun breakfast for my kids (ages 10 and 15) - but I would feel bad about feeding them these things.  They left grease all over my fingers and the plate and gave me heartburn.  They tasted just OK.

Im giving these 3 stars because the cheese melted out and all over the cookie sheet, the edges of the ham started to burn also! I have now made these a few times and figured out a few tips, first use the sheet of crescent dough roll it works much better and just roll it up (looks like a huge stromboli). Second you can use swiss, American, provolone, or pepper Jack cheese! I have also changed it up and used Turkey and bacon or peperoni and crumbled sausage. We tried the ham with mustard and we didn't care for it. We dip the peperoni ones in pizza sauce. The last time I made these I made an egg wash and brushed the tops with that and sprinkled parsley on the tops! These are great as breakfast, lunch, dinner or a fast snack!

We like these.  I did not find them to be too greasy at all.  I cooked them on a stone which tends to absorb most of the moisture.  Made these for New Years Eve and even my 5 year old liked them.

Love this.  It was super easy and makes a great quick breakfast.  I did add a few pieces of asparagus to the middle of each roll up to add some veggies.  Worked perfectly and I can see adding broccoli in the future.

I found the crescent rolls to be way too rich tasting. Loaded with butter and salt it overpowered the flavor of the ham and cheese. I definitely will not be making these again. I should say that we tend to eat pretty healthy and don't ever really use butter so it very well could be we're not used to that flavor.

Made these with roll dough instead of crescent roll dough. My kids went crazy over these. It was a simple and easy dish.

Company was coming for lunch and I'm not the greatest of cooks...oh the stress.  I hate trying new recipes on company.  My sister recommended this recipe.  What a hit, they were delicious.  Even my picky husband loved them and said they tasted like a warm deli sandwich.  My son (who "hates" ham) ate a few of these too, but of course afterwards when he found out it was ham and requested his with "cheese only" next time.  On a couple I spread a thin layer of plain yellow mustard on the inside of the crescent before baking and it was really good, but without it they were great as well.  I served with a fruit salad, green onions, and potato chips.  A great lunch with very, very little stress.  I bought one original crescent roll and one garlic crescent roll, the original was fantastic, the garlic tasted really funky with the ham and was too salty, the garlic probably would have been ok with pepperoni though.  They get done fast so I used the minimum baking time maybe a minute less.  Thanks for the great recipe, they turned out perfect.

Wonderful!  These were easy and fast to make, with a really nice presentation.  I made half with ham and dijon, half with ham and shredded mozzarella (we had no sliced cheese on hand).  Both varieties turned out excellent. They were not too greasy at all.  I probably used a bit less ham and cheese than the recipe called for. I would serve these to company, probably for breakfast or lunch instead of dinner though.  Give it a try!

Great recipe!! My whole family loved them. It was very easy and fast to make. The only problem I had was the cheese melted and oozzed all over. They still tasted good. Next time I make this I will use less cheese.

Ok for what it is.  I have a recipe for ham and cheese on hawian rolls with a sweet glaze that are just as quick and taste much better.  So I probably wont use this one again.

DELICIOUS!  I used Havarti cheese instead of Cheddar because it was what I had in the fridge.  I brushed the tops with melted butter and then sprinkled a little garlic powder on top.  Baked them until golden brown.   YUM-YUM-YUM!

These are a wintertime staple for us served with a nice hot cup of soup!  My kids as well as my husband and I love them.  Be careful not to put too much ham or the sometimes end up a little gooey inside.

This is a great alternative to frozen microwaved items. These are just as easy, and taste so much better!

I cooked these with leftover Easter ham, which is decidedly more difficult to "mold" into the desired shape to fit.  I also used Monterey Jack cheese, as that was on hand.  They were quite tasty and even good leftover the next day for breakfast.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe, however, I would suggest doubling the cheese and ham, as I couldn't taste them anywhere near as much as the crescent rolls.  Also, make sure NO cheese is showing and that there are NO thin sections of crescent as the cheese will end up outside of the crescent instead of inside.

I made these for lunch today, and my two year old son loved them! He ate two of them in about thirty seconds. My husband and I liked them pretty well too. I will have to try several different combinations to see how we like them the best. Will definitely make again since they were so easy and quick.

The good thing about this recipe is its versatility. I used turkey lunchmeat and some shredded cheese I had in the frig. It was the perfect lunch for my 2-yr-old grandson and me.

Second attempt at these last night - the first time they seemed really greasy, but I thought there was potential. So this time I used about a tablespoon of shredded cheddar each, rather than sliced cheddar. They turned out so much better! Maybe it was the type of cheese, maybe not, but they were great. I made a double batch and the kids scarfed them up; served with tomato soup, it was a quick and delicious rainy fall night dinner.

I liked these but I DID tweak them. I rolled the dough just enough to make it into 1 larger Roll-Up. I then spread a layer of Pizza sauce,topped with ham,pepperoni,cheese,slivered green peppers and sliced black olives. Followed rest of recipe-just had 1 longer loaf. Oh, I also topped it with Herbs de Provence and Garlic Powder. Everyone loved it. So, I DID change it but it would have been yummy without all of the added stuff,too. I just got carried away!LOL

These were very good. Next time we will cut the amount of cheese in half or just add another slice of ham to each roll. Either way, a little to much cheese. Oh! Best idea ever, just add a piece of bacon and leave everything else the same! Everything is better with bacon!

Can't you put just about anything inside a Crescent Roll?  You are only limited by your imagination!  This was a tasty, little nugget, very easy to prepare and quickly gone from the platter.  I served it with a crisp carrot salad.  It would also make a great accompaniment to tomato soup.  I only knocked it down a star because it was a bit on the salty side.

Easy lunch/meal for kids. Just add a fruit or veggie on the side. I've made these twice using ham & american cheese and ham & cheddar cheese. These are very versatile since you could use any meat/cheese combination you wanted. Cook on one of the top racks of your oven or the bottoms will get burned. Also go light on the cheese or it will melt out of the crescents and make a mess on your baking sheet.

Great idea, but by following the directions you have a very doughy inside even though the crust is more than done on the outside.

I sprinkle some parley on top before baking to make them look pretty. I roll them up and cut them to make little appetizers - I have been doing this for years and let me tell you, every time I go somewhere and ask what I can bring, this is it! Now I don't even ask, I just bring these with some other treat (I always feel guilty bringing only these because they are soooo easy its like cheating) and its always a hit.  it's the easiest thing to make and I've never met anyone who doesn't like them.

These were super yummy!..  I think I had something similar with hot dogs once but these were so much better!  I buy all natural ham and dried off the moisture between paper towels.  For the cheese I had some colby/Jack and sliced it thin.   My whole family loved them.  I did end up making another whole batch since they were smaller than I had thought and my guys have big appetites. :)

I make one giant loaf by placing dough onto foil, pinch the triangle seams into a rectangle, fill the center leaving seams, fold and braid.   I have been doing these for along time and its one of those yummy, QUICK meals with no leftovers.

I have done this many times before and I love them. What I do is I sprinkle grated parmesan cheese on top of the ham instead of using sliced cheese, and I make a sauce using a can of cheddar cheese soup and milk. The sauce is great for pouring over the rolls and some steamed broccoli. My boyfriend was actually the one who introduced this recipe to me-his mom showed him. It's a great easy dinner for college kids or anyone.

Very quick and easy recipe. My kids gobbled them up but I thought they needed a little something. We served with honey mustard.

My son and I had these for lunch and they were delicious! I didn't have enough ham so I ended up doing half of the crescents with ham and the other half with turkey. They were very good dipped in honey mustard!

I doubled the recipe because we were having these for dinner with soup on the side.  We all liked them quite a bit, but I felt they needed a little "something", so I dipped mine in mustard.  They were a little difficult to roll up with the sliced cheddar cheese, so I think next time I'll try using shredded cheese instead.  I think they'd also be phenomenal brushed with a little garlic butter as soon as they come put of the oven.

I make these extra-special by adding a couple of asparagus spears. The ends of the spears get all "frizzled" in the oven, which makes them really yummy. You could also add a teeny bit of mustard if you like.

These are so quick and easy and so yummy.  I make them all the time, and my family loves them. I make them for a quick weekend lunch.  I also switch up the meat and cheese with what I have on hand, deli sliced turkey meat is good too.

Delicious recipe! I love that it is so versatile. I spread on a thin layer of pesto along with a bit of shredded mozzarella cheese, and a thin layer of turkey. So very good! My 4 year old loved them. Will try it with cheddar and thin sliced roast beef next time.

Some evenings beg for a simple snacky-type supper.  When our family is running in several directions at once, you need a few recipes to pull out and this is one of them.  My daughter was in charge of supper last night and made these easily.  With only 3 ingredients, it's a cinch to keep them on hand all the time.

We make these a lot, usually as a late night snack, or instead of sandwiches for lunch. Sometimes the cheese doesn't stay in so well, so for a cheesier roll up, make a long roll by sealing all the edges into a single sheet, place ham and extra cheese along one side, roll up as a single log, seal the ends, and cut into pieces after baking. It usually needs an extra couple of minutes in the oven this way.

I made these for dinner, and they were a hit.   I did not at all find them to be greasy, but I may have ended up with slightly less cheese since I used shredded cheese and didn't want to make a mess.  I also use the cheese made with 2% milk.  These are easy to dip in sauce if you prefer extra flavor.  I love to have a couple easy dinners a week, and this is a keeper.  The recipe is very versatile as you can get creative with what you roll up with the crescents.  I've made the Crescent Pizza Pockets recipe quite a few times, but I prefer the idea of rolling things up, it seems to work better for me.  Next week I am going to try the Pulled Chicken Crescents recipe.

Okay, I admit I am not one to pick up crescents at the store as I love to bake. However, I was doing a youth party before and needed a bunch of hot and cold quick appetizers. I did a turkey and cheese version of these and they tasted great. Someone commented on the saltiness on here. Try the turkey deli meat instead, it comes in low sodium and it turns out well.

This wasn't greasy at all, I used Sara Lee deli ham and Swiss cheese with a little bit of mustard spread on the dough and it was great!  Be prepared to make more than one tube though, they go very fast!

Kids really liked this.  I tried half with cheddar cheese and half with swiss.  Both great, you could really do any combo of meats/cheese you wish.  Also used reduced fat crescents.  Would be a nice side to soup.

My mother in law would always make these for showers or parties except she would spread a little bit of yellow mustard on the dough before adding the ham and cheese.  Then after they cooled she would cut them into pinwheel type things.  Awesome!

These are a big hit with my hubby and daughter-they like them with a little honey mustard in them. I'm not a huge fun-they're really salty IMHO. So 2 out of 3 yum votes at our house.

Very simple recipe, easy to customize with great results. Has anyone tried freezing them? I think this would make a nice, hot lunch if I could make a few and then freeze a couple to save for later...

Used oven roasted chicken breast. Tasty. Easy. Not greasy at all! KIDS LOVED!  Recommend using parchment. Paired with a noodle soup for a quick Sunday afternoon lunch.  Ps...did I mention kids loved!

These are a great idea because it's an easy lunch. However, I can only give it 3 stars because the kids hated them! I do not have picky eaters, but they would not touch these roll-ups. I think the crescent roll dough was too sweet.

Easy and good! Kids and adults loved them. I served with a separate mayo/spicy brown mustard/dijon dip that really kicked these up for the adults without "ruining" them for the kids. So many possibilities...

Enjoyed this hot crescent roll sandwich for lunch today.  I think a little Dijon mustard spread on the roll would be a good addition to this sandwich, and I'll try that next time, but this was plenty good just with the ham and cheddar, too.  I'll always use cheddar (as opposed to American), as I think that really gave this a pop of flavor.

Quick & Easy!  I used the Pillsbury Big & Flaky Crescent Dinner Rolls and American cheese in place of cheddar.  These were quick and easy to make.  As there is only two of us, I made four roll-ups and wrapped the left-over dough between two pieces of parchment paper and refrigerated.  I will use them soon for another tasty recipe from Pillsbury.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  YUM!

Nice and easy.  Easy to adjust to a cheese sandwich for my vegetarian daughter.  Used shredded cheddar, 'cause that's what I had.  Used 2 slices of ham for each roll, 'cause one didn't seem enough.  Hubby made a garlic/mustard aioli for dipping.  Finish with a salad, and DONE!

I made these for my kids' school lunch and they really liked them. You can use any type of meat (ham, turkey even bologna!). I used a cheese string cut into thirds and just rolled everything up. My kids loved them warm or cold.

You can't go wrong with melted cheese, but nothing too special about these if you make it as written.  You could doctor it up, but I try to rate recipes as written, not how I make them.  having said that, other people have given great ideas to jazz them up!

Easy, tasty and versatile - pretty good for the humble crescent roll! Fill these with whatever lunch meat and cheese you like. My daughter loves turkey and muenster cheese. Hubby likes good old ham and swiss, but a close favorite of his is roast beef and cheddar. Use your imagination and your favorite fillings and enjoy!

I can see kids liking this recipe but as an adult I need more pizzazz.  I topped one with parmesan cheese (I think even kids would like it).  I can see adding garlic and basil or marinara, or sharper cheese or bacon bits.  There are a lot of options but the recipe as it is, is unremarkable.

Note... the type of ham you use will make a big difference in this recipe... my ham was too tough to even enjoy these!

Very quick and easy. I used turkey instead of ham, since I had it on hand, and they were delicious.

These were a good snack for the kids.  The tasted pretty much how I expected as there isn't much to these.  Will make again.

I added String Cheese to mine.

Love this one!  I took the advise of a reviewer and use turkey.  The only problem I have with this one is that the meat all comes out in one bite, so maybe a shredded meat would work best.

Very easy to  make. I followed others directions and enclosed the ham and cheese inside the dough so the cheese wouldn't ooze out all over the place. I am going to make these again since they were easy and tasty!

this simplistic idea was perfect for us tonight.  i made a huge spiral-sliced ham last night and had a ton of leftovers i need to use up.  while i didn't have crescent rolls, i did have jumbo buttermilk biscuits.  so i halved the biscuits, put in some diced leftover ham and some american cheese, sealed the edges, and baked as directed.  my 5 year has not complimented dinner so much as she did tonight in i can't remember how long.  super easy and something different.  thanks!

Will absolutely make again.  So easy.  I used a half slice of ham and a half slice of packaged cheddar cheese slices.  I didn't even tuck the ham in.  Rolled up nicely and baked for 17 minutes total.  Served with dijon mustard for dipping.  Huge hit at my house.

Too simple. Needs something extra and tastes overly buttery and fatty. Comfort food but showing its budget-friendliness a little too much. Edible but not enough to make again.

I made this recipe for a quick something different kind of lunch. Being from New Mexico I cook a lot with  chili peppers so I added a thin strip of roasted Hatch Green Chili on top of the cheese before rolling up the crescent. The crescents were a hit in our household and definitely made it to my make again list.

I didn't realize how versatile crescent roll dough is until I made this. I made one large roll stuffed with provolone and leftover Christmas turkey. It was like a footlong fresh homemade hot pocket. Delish!!

Super easy, and really tasty!  I was surprised how filling these are.  A tad bit on the greasy side.  Not sure if that's because I used bricked cheddar or not.  The only thing I did differently was add mustard before I rolled them. It adds a nice flavour.  I will be making these again for sure!  Great recipe!!

Nice concept and very versatile.  A single triangle wrap would be way too small a serving in my house; therefore, I put 2 triangles of dough together to form a rectangle, being careful to join all seams ( one tube of crescent rolls will make 4 crescent wraps). I covered the rectangle with a thin layer of light honey mustard dressing.  After this, I chopped a large slice of ham, folded it into one slice of Swiss, basically folding the slice in half to act as a "pocket" for the cheese.  I placed the pocket into the "sauced" rectangle.  I wrapped the dough around the cheese/ham pocket, joining the long sides together & closing all seams by pinching with my fingers tips.  I then folded the short ends in toward the center (similar to wrapping a present) and closed all seams.  Cooked for 13 minutes, then turned the wraps over & cooked for an additional 5 minutes.  It made a nice presentation (similar to hot pockets), but was greasy (that's why I'm giving only 4 stars).  Next time I will make these using pizza dough instead of crescent rolls to reduce fat.  This recipe has a lot of potential!

These were a hit with my family.  Maybe not the healthiest thing I've ever cooked but everyone loved them and they were easy to make.

pretty good, just a little salty, I'll that it's easy and quick. I think these would be more for breakfast or a snack. There's 4 people in my house including myself and ended up doubling it up didn't think 8 would be enough.

I use American cheese and good ham.  I stay away from cheese with spices added, I can't handle spices and know it. Good cheese and good ham won't give me indigestion.  The rest of the family really loves these things, no matter what they are made with.

I actually really liked the idea of this recipe, and the recipe itself isn't bad, but the cheese leaked out of every single one that I made.  All of the cheese, there was a little flavor left but not much.  I've found similar recipes that didn't seem to have that issue, and I'll probably end up making one of them when I want something similar.

Good, I mean, how can you go wrong - ham, cheese, and bread. Kids loved them and they were tasty. Made for a good lunch coupled with a salad. Would make again for quick kid lunch on a day that I am scratching my head for a lunch that is warm.

love how versatile this is...I tried making and rolling as it calls for, and I have to say, yes, its difficult..also rolled over ways other reviewers suggested, rolling into a log, and rolling using the square...I liked the square better..(just looked better to me) I spread a small amount of a brown horseradish mustard inside, added pepperoni, purple onion, ham, and swiss cheese...was very good! you only get a small kick from the horseradish at the end....kinda one of them..''what is that?'' ,moments.... :D  It loses one star for me, because no matter how i rolled it, the dough was still soggy...

Made these for my boyfriend's daughter's 8th birthday party. They were a huge hit. I made them in mass cause we were supposed to have around 30 people and took forever to roll them all, but they were loved enough that they were definitely worth it. I only made half with the ham and cheese. The rest were pepperoni and cheese, with sauce to dip them in. The pepperoni went faster.

Try using cheddar or provolone instead of American cheese. These are alright, but not very substantial.

I made these and Crescent Dogs for dinner and was fully prepared to like THESE better.  I was shocked to discover I actually preferred the Crescent Dogs.  These were good, though.  I used diced ham I'd had in the freezer & swiss cheese.  I also added some green pepper and onion.  Good stuff, but I can't see myself making them again...

These are a good quick hot lunch for the kids.  I find it easier to use a "square" (2 individual crescents) because it seems to be easier to roll up that way..  I also like to do sliced kielbasa and mozzarella cheese.

These are delicious; great for a quick weekend lunch. We've make them with ham & cheddar, but our favorite way to make them is with pepperoni & string cheese, served w/ marinara on the side for dipping (3-4 pepperonis & half a stick of string cheese per roll).
