Wonderful seasonings!  It could be too spicy for some - know your audience - for us this was perfect.  I took the roast out of the refrigerator for about an hour to warm up.  I used olive oil instead of butter to cook the spices and I ended up using more course ground pepper - what can I say, we love pepper.    I cooked the roast at 300 until it reached 125 degrees and then turned the oven up to 425 and cooked to 145.  Took out and rested while I did the gravy.  I did do the gravy a bit different.  I used 2 T butter and 2 T flour - made a roux in a seperate pan.  I removed the cooked vegetables and strained the juices from the baking pan - I used the drippings plus 1 cup pork stock to make the gravy.  Very good!

I only omitted one ingredient and that was the cayenne pepper. Very flavorful pork loin recipe, though next time I make this, I'd double the spices. The gravy was one of the best we'd ever had.

I adapted this recipe for use in the pressure cooker. The technique variations I used are as follows.
1. Brown the loin on all sides in cooker
2. Followed steps 2 & 3 exactly
3. Add 1 cup stock and bring cooker to 15psi for 50 minutes. Allow natural release of pressure
4. Followed steps 5 & 6 exactly
Taste was excellent! Thanks for posting

This has a wonderful aroma as it cooks, and the rub is quite tasty, but I will decrease the cayenne pepper next time.  Roasted to an internal temperature of 145 gave us a moist and tender roast.  Thanks for the idea!

I just made this for dinner, and my family have all had seconds!  Made this with garlic mashed potatoes, and they are raving about how wonderful it all is.  The gravy went so nicely with the potatoes!  The pork is tender and so flavorful, very easy to make and dang-near foolproof.  I will be adding this to our family favorites list!

This was fantastic!  Tried to add potatoes and carrots while it cooked; didn't work out because it wasn't covered.  Thank goodness because I ended up whipping up some mashed potatoes instead.  The gravy was so good on the pork and the potatoes!  My husband looked at me after a bite and smiled and said what a keeper! He couldn't stop thinking about how good it was later that night.  My sons fought over the left overs, when normally they won't touch a reheated meal.  Thanks so much for the quick recipe to cook a pork loin at the last minute without having to marinate it.

Taste very strong! Made as a family meal way too spicy for the litle ones. Could not serve the gravy.

This was a hit with the whole family.  The only modification I would make is changing the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp instead of 1/2.  Not because it was too hot...it was just too hot for our 1 year old twins.  Otherwise, this is the perfect recipe.  We'll be using this often!  Thanks!

Did a cup of water in the roasting pan and used the drippings for the gravy, instead of pork broth. Also didn't strain the gravy. We definitely liked it and will do it again. It is slightly spicy though just for those who don't care for spicier dishes. I made this basically to see how the gravy would workout...and it's definitely 5 star!

Pork is the meat that I struggle with the most. Especially when I roast it. This recipe is out of this world. I did have any cayenne pepper but it was amazing without it! Pork should now be roasted to only 145 degrees. Make sure you let it sit before you cut it. I made this with a 6 lb pork loin and cooked at 350 for 2 hours.

This was fabulous! I didn't change a thing other than using a Dutch oven instead of a regular roasting pan and used 1/2 tsp of cayenne and 1/2 tsp of chipotle powder.  The gravy made from the drippings was phenomenal!

This dish was awesome and super easy to make. The seasonings soak into the pork and blend so well. It reminds me of old style recipe with lots of flavor. I loved it!

The flavor was Amazing!  Only change I made was to put all spices in frying pan with 1/2 stick of butter and sear the loin on all sides.  After placing loin in roasting pan, I pored  the pan contents over the loin, then deglazed the pan with a cup of hot water and added this to the bottom of the roasting pan.  This helped to make an awesome gravy.

This was delicious! Again, I read a recipe all the way through before I make it so I knew I wanted to  leave out the cayenne. This is no reflection on the original, I just wasn't feeling it  tonight. Other than that, I made it as directed.  I served it with roasted potatoes, carrots, and broccoli. Solid recipe. Thanks, Lil Snoo!  :o)

Made this for dinner the other night, we really liked it! Not too different from your usual roast pork and veggies. Had a little trouble with the gravy but got it worked out. Will probably make this again or a version of it.

My honey loved it! I didn’t have any celery and left the chopped onion and carrots in the gravy, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Some of the spices and herbs fell off and ended up in the gravy giving it a full-bodied flavor, so good! Served it with applause, mashed potatoes and fried cabbage.

This recipe sounded like it would be great, so I gave it a try. Way too much spice for me.Seasonings are meant to complement the meat,but even after using half the recommended amount of cayenne all the seasonings overpowered the pork. I would reduce the cayenne to 1/8 teaspoon and reduce the black pepper and oregano to 1/8-1/4tsp. Also add more butter or a couple of tablespoons of EVOO.I also mix the flour into cold water or broth then add to the simmering drippings. I would add 1/4 tsp gravy master and 1T dry minced onion to the gravy and simmer to thicken/reduce and then strain.I like spicey but I also like to taste the flavor of the meat. Thanks :)

Loved this recipe! I was serving it to little ones so left out the cayenne pepper. For veggies I used ones that I had sliced in the food processor and froze so they were really thin. This worked out great because when I made gravy I could incorporate them into the gravy and my picky kiddos had no idea they were eating veggies!

I really loved this, and I was able to cut the spicyness of the gravy by adding 3/4 cup more of chicken stock and 1/4 cup of water with another tablespoon of flour.  It was still spicy, but not overwhelmingly so.  All my kids DEVOURED the roast!  This is our new family favorite!

This is just good food, the kind every cook needs in his or her arsenal. I left out the cayenne because I was cooking for kids, and didn't miss it. I also strained the gravy... it's not hard to do and makes it much more appetizing. A keeper.

We absolutely LOVED this! I brined my roast first then applied the rub per instructions and let it sit overnight in the fridge. It is a little spicy, which we thought was great, but you might cut down on the cayenne if that's not your thing. The gravy was SO delicious! This recipe is absolutely a keeper!

I have little ones so I dropped the cayenne. I'm the king of gravy and this took me to a whole new level. Awesome recipe!

This was a really good pork roast recipe.  I cut the cayenne by half as some suggested.  I cut the oregano a bit and added two fresh sage leaves and a few needles of fresh rosemary.  There wasn't enough drippings to make gravy, but that's probably due to the meat I bought more that the recipe. I'll definitely make this again.

Ours was very dry.  It needs to cook in more liquid.  I won’t make this again.

I never realized that 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper could crank up soooo much heat in a recipe!!  Once we got past that, it had pretty good flavor.  I do not have pork stock (never have!), so used chicken bone broth.  What I did was mix all the leftovers together including the veggies, gravy and made a casserole out of it.  Now, that was surprisingly good!!  I served this with baked sweet potatoes and salad.  My hubby thought the sweet potatoes complimented the pork.  Sort of mellowed the heat!  Next time for me, anyway, is to add just a 'dash' of cayenne!

Used pork loin from Costco. Started at 450 for 15 min. Then about another 45 - 60 min. Made a nice gravy.

We really enjoyed this! I did not have enough liquid on the bottom of the pan to make a gravy with, however. I don't know if I did something wrong or not, but it was good even without the gravy.

Gosh this was delicious!  My mom used to make something similar to this.  It was the way you made the gravy that brought me back 40 yrs.  My son and I couldnt get enough!  I did manage to save enough for leftovers though.  Thanks for a great simple but wonderful recipe!

Hubby wanted a pork roast and so grabbed one from the freezer, not taking into account that it was frozen.  So, out comes the Instant Pot pressure cooker and we loves ours.

We followed the recipe exactly, and it came out tender, with a nice flavor that wasn't overpowering.  It wasn't as nice looking as the photo but it tasted good.  We added potatoes, carrots and onions and I strained the broth, we did add some veggie broth to have enough liquid.  Added the flour to a small amount of broth and let it cook on the stove until it thicken.  
The only change we will make the next time we make it and it doesn't have to do with the recipe exactly is let it cook a few minutes longer, one part was a bit tough and we put the potatoes and carrots in too early, they were a bit overcooked, but still very good.  
We will definitely use the recipe again for a roast and he took some over to our neighbor as his wife died recently; we always have left overs so share them.

I’m not a big fan of pork,  with the exception of a barbecue sandwich and a rack of baby backs. But this recipe was absolutely  delicious. If you’re not a fan of spice, there is no need to be afraid of the cayenne pepper In this recipe.  Just a hint remains in the final product. I did use chicken stock for the broth and it was equally yummy.

This was a great dish. The seasoning was the star and complimented the pork loin roast. The gravy was really tasty. I left the chopped veggies in when making the gravy and it was delicious. It’s a keeper.

I made this with a small pork roast and we loved it. It was just what we needed on a cold, windy November day! I might adjust the cayenne next time(depending on who is coming for dinner) but there will definitely be a next time.

I used  1/2 the garlic, not a big garlic fan, and used chicken broth because that is what I had on hand.  Definitely will make again.

I followed the recipe to a T.  The only thing I would change is cutting down on the cayenne. It was a little too spicy but otherwise it was an amazing meal.  It was completely gobbled up.  It was absolutely yummy!!!!!

I used pork tenderloin. It was a big package with 2 in it. Used 9X13 baking dish. Covered in foil.  Other than that I followed the directions.  Made the slits and the spice mix  made it wonderful.  It was fall apart good when it was done.  The drippings were strained before I made the gravy.  That's just the way I like to do it.
Thank you, this is great!

Easy. This was great. For my family we left out the cayenne. I added a full cup of stock because the kids like gravy. Used a Dutch oven as suggested by another reviewer. Will make again. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.

Turned out beautifully!  I had to cut the time back by about 45 minutes because I used two smaller pork loins and I also cut the cayenne by half.

Very good - tender and moist.  Pretty well followed the recipe except that we went very light on the cayenne and we didn't bother piercing the meat.  We chopped the carrots, onions and celery very fine and I use this as a base for roast beef as well.  It really makes a great base for the gravy.

Great little recipe! I had no celery, so I subbed a green apple to make sure there'd be enough moisture. Left out the cayenne, but added celery salt because I wanted the celery flavoring. Went by the recipe, except that I cooked it in my Nesco 6-quart roaster at 300. Sprayed the interior of the roaster with nonstick spray, put the fixin's in while the roaster was cold, turned it on, put the lid on, and once the temperature hit 300 degrees, set my timer for an hour in order to check it. The roast was at 150 when the timer went off, so I let it rest for 10 minutes (temp continued to rise), strained the drippings, added a little chicken bouillon and made gravy using cornstarch. Gravy and meat were outstanding; the roast was melt-in-your-mouth tender. Served with boiled red taters and green beans. Awesome. Thanks for sharing!

Prepared exactly as directed, changed cooking times as I did it in a convection oven. Didn't make the gravy, was just being lazy. Added a little water in the pan to help cook the vegetables.   Loved by all, will be a mainstay recipe  for a pork loin roast in our family, thank you

This was the first time I've ever done a pork loin and it turned out FANTASTIC.  My loin was a bit over 3lbs, I sub'd adobo chili powder for the cayenne  bc it's what I had on hand and used actual yellow mustard instead of the powder - again, bc it's what I had on hand.  There were only two of us and we ate for days.  Added rice and broccoli and it was a smash.  Can't wait to try again.

Used a 2# roast and counted on the temperature gauge for doneness.  Very flavorful but it doesn't make enough gravy.  Will fix that next time.

Although I didn't have all the spices, and I added 1 tsp of seasoning salt.  The pork was flavorful and tender.  The cayenne gave the pan gravy quite the kick.  I put my roast on top of the vegetables which helped sweat more juices for the gravy.  Ill have to cut back a bit on the cayenne for me but my family loved it!!!  Delicious!!!!

It was very tasty.  I did a few things differently.  First, I cooked it at 375 for 20 mins per pound.  It came out perfectly! It  very tender and a medium rare to medium.  I also, like others, used less cayenne pepper.  The roast was pretty lean, so it didn't render a lot of juice for making the gravy.  Next time, i might add a little liquid to the pan.   I also substituted chicken stock for the pork stock.

Cooked 3 whole pork loins for our Sunday School Class Christmas luncheon. The only thing I changed was to brine the Pork loins in a simple salt/sugar brine overnight. before roasting and I cooked them in roasting bags.  Soooo tender and a welcome change from turkey or ham.

I did not include the carrots or celery with this as I did not have them on hand and did not make the gravy.  Did everything else as the recipe was written and it turned out great!  Will definitely make this again and add all the veggies next time.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except excluded the cayenne pepper because I was serving a little one, skipped the celery because I didn't have any and reduced the thyme in half because I don't care for the flavor.  Since the seasoning mixture wasn't very funny, I ended up doubling the butter to try and get some liquid on the bottom of the pan.  I still had very few drippings for the gravy, so I ended up scraping some of the seasoning off the meat to get the flavor and had to add 1.5 cups of stock to get any amount of gravy worth having.  I served with mashed potatoes.  I will make again.

This was very tasty.  I spread the spices on it then seared it then into the oven.  I didn't get to the gravy but it was very good without it.  I added paprika and used just a pinch of cayenne.

Tasty and easy recipe. Timing was perfect, done just when recipe said it would be.  Was a tad spicy for hubby and I, but company loved it. Couldn't find pork stock or gravy locally, so I used chicken stock. Gravy turned out great when mixed with pork roast drippings.

First I have to say that I do not like pork. But my husband really loves meat of any kind. I happened to notice that Pork Loin was on sale and I thought I should try it. I have never cooked a Pork Loin. 
I followed the recipe almost exactly leaving out all of the peppers. 
Amazingly I really liked it and my son had seconds. My husband said we needed to go tomorrow while it was on sale and buy 10 of them!

Fabulous!!  This roast is amazing, and the cooking time is right on. I cooked this for a large family dinner and was nervous about how it would turn out. It was cooked perfectly with no variation from the recipe. Everyone raved about it, and my super-picky nieces and nephews ate it up. Definitely a keeper!

Quick and easy. Didn't have any drippings, so I added 2 cups of vegetable broth at the end  during the crips up phase. Our 8 year old loved it. We made roasted potatoes to go along with, but maybe some mashed next time. 

The time is right on, so is the recipe.

I have been making different kinds of pork roast but tonight my family said this is their favorite! The only things I did differently is half the cayenne pepper & omit the dry mustard. I made mashed potatoes & green beans to go with this. I will definitely be making this again & again!

Best Pork Roast I've ever made. Followed everything except the gravy, which if the meat is tender enough, and it was, is not needed.

I did cut down on the peppers, but next time I'm cutting back even more. I brined my pork loin (will never skip this step!) and the meat was really tender. The gravy is spicy, but is lovely on the mashed potatoes which accompanied this roast. Yes, I'm gonna make this again.

Just used the spices on  pork chops and pan fried them. Then made the gravy with 2 Tbsp of flour and a cup of chicken broth. Might add a splash of wine next time.

Great flavor in this dish! The cayenne pepper was a bit much - next time I will cut that in half. Alongside I made fresh grean beans and roasted red potatoes. For the gravy I made a roux first, then added to the pan drippings. I also used turkey stock instead of pork and it was just fine!

I omitted the mustard as I didn't have it on hand, reduced the cayenne as my hubby is a little sensitive to spices and roasted halved potatoes in it as well. The pork is amazingly tender and the gravy very flavorful. Great recipe, especially when in a time crunch.

This was absolutely delicious and family approved.  I believe it was one of the first meals my 7yr old twin boys ate with my husband and I without any alterations or "kid friendly" sides.   They loved it and My husband and I loved it!  Will be making this a lot more often.  My only change was leaving out the rosemary simply because I am not a fan.  :-)

I was surprised at how moist this roast was, especially since it roasted uncovered. Turning up the heat at the end made for the perfect temperature for Roasted Apples and Brussels Sprouts, also on this site. (The Brussels sprouts finished roasting while the roast rested.) The gravy was delicious--however, I had a hard time straining out the vegetables after the gravy had already thickened, and I ended up losing some of the gravy to the discarded veggies. Next time I'll either strain before making the roux, or dice the vegetables finer and leave them in.

Excellent recipe. Only changes were not using as much cayenne pepper, per previous reviews, and used fresh thyme. Oh and I used a bone-in pork loin. Delicious.

I made this tonight, and it was fantastic! My only problem was, I didn't cover while it cooked so the drippings were very little. The gravy that it did make, was very very good, just not enough! The pork was juicy and delicious and my hubby loved it! Thanks for the recipe 
LilSnoo! Will definitely make again!

I had to drastically reduce the cooking time, and it was still tough, but the flavor was OK. Nothing special. Definitely needed salt.

This was very good, nice and simple yet flavourful.  We have two young boys and they both liked it too!  Will be making it again.

Used cumin instead of cayenne. I think next time, I'd just skip either. The pork was very moist and delicious.

I tried this today. I must say, it was a little on the spicy side for my taste but nevertheless, it was good. I used the gravy along with the carrots and celery, etc. and poured it over a baked potato. Gravy was very good. I'm not sure what made it so spicy as I didn't think there was that much spice mixture to rub on the pork and I almost doubled it, glad I didn't.
