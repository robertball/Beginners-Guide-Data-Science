Made this on my George Foreman grill in under 10 minutes.  I was worried that the sandwich was going to be too tall to fit, but it was a-ok.  I held the grill down for a minute, and after that just let it be.  The bread toasted better than I expected, and had better color/texture where ever I had put the olive oil.  Added the balsamic to the tomatoes instead of the bread (was afraid the bread would get soggy), and added S&P to the fresh mozzarella. Super fast & easy & tasty = 5 stars.

This is my new favorite hot sandwich! I used balsamic glaze because I like the concentrated sweetness and tang but otherwise, I made the sandwich as per the recipe and it was fantastic. It was simple and quick. The flavors go so well together. Next time I will use onions as Mrs. Williams suggested, but for now my tummy is happy.

Try mixing a 1/4 cup olive oil with 3 tbls.grated parmesan cheese ans 1/4 tsp garlic powder. Brush it on both sides of the sandwich and grill it until it's golden brown.I found the recipe in a Taste of Home magazine.It really adds alot to it and tastes so good!

Fast and easy. Perfect for our 90 degree weather.  I used ciabatta take and bake bread and cooked it for about 5 minutes in the george forman grill.  Didn't have red onion so I used vidalia sweet onion.  I think this would be good with fresh baby spinach instead of fresh basil with a sprinkeling of dried basil over the tomato layer.  Will try that next time.  Was very good as is.

I just finished this delicious panini for lunch. I followed the recipe but I used a thin bread roll that one of the companies just put out..100 calories. The combination of flavors is so good. I loved the balsamic vinegar on the bread. I toasted it in a grill pan that came with a handle to press down on the sanwich.Excellent, thanks for sharing your recipe:)

So glad I checked my email before lunch! This recipe came in the Daily Dish today, and I had all the ingredients on hand. In less than 10 minutes I was eating this delicious sandwich with fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden. Excellent proof that the best food is fresh and simple!

Fast,easy, healthy and taste great. I placed turkey on mine and used basil seasoning instead of leaves. After cooking I added pickles, olives, peperoncini's, salt, pepper and a little bit of mustard. Was excellent!

AWESOME!  Loved it!  I added a few  sprinkles of sea salt & ground pepper to the tomatoes before pressing on the panini grill.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Mrs. Williams!

These are absolutly scrumptous sandwiches! Going to try your version with the French deli roll. Would be a nice change from a thin sourdough bread. I should mention that panzanella and panini is on the redundant side. Caprese Panini would be a better title explanation ;-)

This was...amazing!  I used my George Forman grill- only stray from the recipe was mixing the balsamic vinegar with the tomatoes.  I love a sandwich that's satisfying enough to be dinner! =)

Can't go wrong with simple, fresh, and tasty!  I've been a fan of panini's for years. I do make the following modifications on this recipe...Instead of using olive oil I lightly spray the bread with olive oil flavored cooking spray (tastes just the same but without the fat), add sliced red and green peppers to the sandwich along with yellow onion, and crushed red pepper flakes. You can even add sliced mushrooms as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe, delicious!

I used my George Foreman as another reviewer suggested. Set it at 350 and cooked for 10 minutes. I think 8 minutes might have been long enough. I would recommond coarsely chopping the basil. I left the leaves whole and when I bit into the sandwich they came all out at once. I also seasoned the tomatoes with a little salt and pepper which I would definately recommend.

A good meatless Monday meal.  Very tasty.  Took the suggestion from another poster to mix 1/4 olive oil, 3 tbsp. grated parmesan cheese and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder.  I also used a George Foreman grille.  Will definitely make again.

We made it with homemade bread in a pancake skillet.  A large pot filled with water provided the weight.

This tastes like the Panini Caprese that we get at a favorite restaurant!  Both my husband and I loved it!  I used the fresh mozzarella in olive oil and spices.  I brushed the oil/spices from the container along with a few drops of basalmic vinegar onto the bread and grilled lightly before adding the tomato, mozzarella and basil. Finished it by pressing it with another skillet until cheese was melted. This was awesome!

Made this for a light dinner for myself, and it was delicious. I used smoked Mozzarella, because that's what I had, fresh basil and fresh tomatoes and onions, as directed. I didn't over stuff my sandwich on purpose, because I actually love the taste of the bread, too! :) Wouldn't change a thing, but a lil Parmesan would be good freshly grated over the olive oil just before grilling, I think. I grilled these as I do all my "panini" style sammiches...on my cast iron grill pan, with my bacon press. :) Thanks, Mrs W, for a nice light, but full of flavor, dish! :)

Absolutely incredible!  Husband couldn't say enough good things about this recipe! I used actual panini rolls from my Wegman's market.  I also added two slices of proscuitto and thinly sliced red onion to the rest of the ingredients. I used my Georgie Foreman grill and it worked great!  The combo of tastes and textures were just unbelievably good!!!  The fresh basil leaves and the balsamic vinegar really make the sandwich though...I think it would not be as good without these two ingredients!

This was a great sandwich. I did not think I would like the fresh basil in it but it was great.All the ingredients work well together. I used a Portuguese roll instead of the French roll. I loved the crispiness of the bread and the tang of the vinegar.  Absolutely great. Can't wait to have it again. Thanks Mrs. Williams.

This was a wonderful panini that everyone loved.  I used fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden on Italian bread.   Delicious!

Delicious!  I've been making sandwiches with tomato, basil, and fresh mozzarella for a while, but I never thought of adding balsamic vinegar.  Brought it up to a whole new level!  I know I'll be eating a lot of these this summer!

Very delicious and easy to make!  I actually threw in some grilled chicken to make it a little more filling and it was delicious.  I also subbed the basil for spinach :P

I made this with prosciutto for a heartier sandwich.  mixing a little parmesan cheese is key.  I've made it stove top with two heated skillets or with a panini press.  Flawless every time.

This sandwich was so delicious.  Simple, easy, not heavy at all.  My husband put ham in his but I love the tast of the basil leaves and the olive oil on the bread was a home run.  This will be a recurring sandwich in our house for sure

Good sandwich!  A US-based chain, Corner Bakery Cafe serves a sandwich similiar to this. It's called tomato mozzarella on ciabatta ficelle. Although I prefer their sandwich a little better, it's only because CB serves theirs cold. I guess I am not a fan of warm tomatoes / basil / mozzarella (but I like margherita pizza, so go figure!). I think the flavors are more pronounced and fresh-tasting when served cold, but that's just me.... Having said this, I am glad to have followed Mrs. William's directions since it gave me an excuse to use my new panini press! :) I only slightly altered Mrs. W's recipe. Instead of sprinkling my bread with vinegar (I used ciabatta rolls), I spread a little basil pesto on each slice. I then layered everything in this order: DOUBLE the amount of fresh mozzarella called for (I LOVE cheese!), thinly sliced tomatoes, a sprinkling of fresh cracked black pepper / coarse sea salt (the latter really brings out the flavor of the tomatoes), balsamic, basil and another slice of mozzarella (cut in half). My hubby gave this a thumbs-up, but didn't like my additon of pesto (he thought it was bitter tasting and that there was too much of it). :( I thought the balsamic was a little strong lol! Thanks for sharing your idea, Mrs. Williams. I will definitely try this again (COLD),  sans the pesto to appease my hubby! :-)

Unhealthy, and therefore totally delicious!  I love how the olive oil crisped up the bread.  I didn't have fresh basil leaves, so I just sprinkled some of the dry stuff on top.  Also, I added some fresh spinach leaves to the sandwich, which was nice touch.  I couldn't even taste them over the other wonderful flavors.  Yummy!  I will probably make this again.

I made this for myself yesterday and it was absolutely fabulous.  However, I didn't have a French loaf or Mozzarella cheese.  I did have a chabotta roll and some shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  It would be great with a nice bowl of soup or even some grilled chicken on the sandwich.  I ate it all by itself and just loved it!  Thank you for this awesome and very healthy recipe!

Great recipe.. I only had portuguese rolls so I used them. I also cooked them on my George Foreman, which did a great job. Son who just won't eat tomatoes, came by with GF and she doesn't either and they each ate a whole one. They loved the vinegar and fresh basil flavors. Will be making this again.

This was an amazingly simple and delicious recipe!  We leave the tomatoes on or off depending on the child and either way it is a filling meal.  Must use fresh basil.  And the balsamic vinegar keeps it from being too bland.  Just right.

VERY GOOD! Oddly enough, I didn't have any fresh basil on hand, so I used some spinach and just added some pesto sauce. Mmmmmm, this was divine. I can't wait to make this again, but with garden fresh ingredients! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was an excellent sandwich!  Loved all the flavors together.  The only change I made was to add some sliced red onion.  Hubby wanted a few slices of ham on his....mine was all veggies & it was good!  Looking forward to making this many more times.

Yum, I loved this, though I forgot to put the vinegar on it, oops.  I used a whole loaf of ciabatta bread (I think I confused two recipes) and spit it, built one big sandwich and cooked in olive oil sprinkles with parmesan cheese.  We sliced it and ate wedges of it with tomato basil soup for a delicious easy dinner.  Will try onions when hubby is not home, he is not a fan.  My sons loved this too.

This was delicious! I made it with homemade ciabatta and grilled it on my panini grill. DH and I both loved it. It's a definite keeper. Thanks, Mrs. Williams

So simple, yet sooo good.  I used ciabatta rolls.  Salt and peppered the tomato slices.  Roasted red peppers would be good on it- but might make it too full!

This sandwich was very easy to prepare, looked beautiful on the plate, and the best part - it was delicious! I used Trader Joe's Marinated Mozzarella for the cheese which has olive oil, garlic, red peppers,and salt. I did not add salt or pepper to the recipe, but did brush the outside of the bread with olive oil before grilling on the George Foreman. What a wonderful sandwich!!

Loved it.  Really liked the BS vinegar, added a lot.  I am going to try these combos on a thin pizza crust and see if I could serve it for an appetizer.  Have really liked the other additions people have tried.

YUMMMMM!! I just bought a panini maker and this was my 1st test project, it's a keeper!! I followed the recipe exactly right up until I was about to put it on the grill.. then, being the meat-eater that I am, I decided that and it needed some proscuitto. I added 2 super thin slices to the sandwich and then grilled it.. WOW! a flavour sensation! I'll be taking one to work at least once a week for a nice easy lunch!

Great recipe. The store was out of fresh basil so I added a little dried basil on top of the tomatoes.(I'm sure fresh would be better). Also had shrimp in the house so I added a few of those and a little onion.  Very good. Would be a great sandwich for a company lunch.

Made these for New Year's Eve party yesterday and they were a hit. I used Olive Oil Ciabbata Stix Artisan Bread from Jessica's Brick Oven Bakery in Woburn, MA that I bought at the local Market Basket Grocery store. Since the bread had plenty of Olive Oil in it I didn't add any extra and they came out great.

My husband and I just ate this Panini and it is SO good.  We added sliced turkey to it to have more protein and made it on the George Foreman grill.  It was awesome...no more spending $8 on a panini from Panera.

Very good quick veggie dinner. I did not had fresh basil and I sprinkled dry basil on the tomatoes instead and added baby spinach to it and it actually tasted very good. Yummy !

I've made this several times now, skipping things and not grilling the bun.  No matter how you make it, it still turns out excellent.

This is a great sandwich! I don't care for balsamic vinegar, so I skipped it. I also buttered my bread instead of using olive oil (I used a half rye deli bread instead of the roll) and used fresh mozzarella. It was so good! Thanks so much for sharing!

Memorable!...........only change was to add a couple of slices of deli turkey meat, thinly sliced. Accompanied this with delicious, ice-cold micro-brewry beer (dark stout). Used 2 cast iron skillets (one on burner with sandwiches in it - other pressing down to get that 'thin' look.

Amazing!  My husband and I loved this recipe.  He said it was restaurant worthy and this is definitely going to be a keeper for us!  I cook it on our George Foreman grill and it turned out great.  Also, I added ham and onion to it which tasted great.

Why didn't I ever think of this before? I make it on ciabetta bread in my Foreman grill, usually add a little onion, and once I used a little leftover pesto instead of fresh basil. Terrific.

I haven't tried this recipe yet but will very soon. I've just purchased an inexpensive panini maker and love it.  I use it at least once a week.  If you'd like to save a few calories try using an olive oil spray on the outside of the bread.  If you want to save even more you don't have to use any.  Most of the makers are non-stick today. What a perfect time of year for this recipe!

I skip the balsamic vinegar and brush the bread with olive oil that has a clove of minced garlic added to it. Adds a great kick to the panini.
