This was so good! I have to make it every week now for the fam.  I replaced the chicken with sauteed shrimp and it is even better.  Also used yellow peppers once when no red to be found and that was very good too, and pretty

Super spectacular.  I am a collector of pizza recipes and this is definitely in the top 5.  I used chicken breast instead of canned chicken and extra pesto.  SOOOOO good!

This came out of the oven looking very impressive and tasted great with a couple modifications.  The pesto flavor was too overpowering and made the pizza kind of dry (this may have just been the pesto I used).  I ended up putting pizza sauce on top of everything and sticking it back into the oven to heat it up.  I would suggest adding pizza sauce to this and not solely using the pesto, it really improved the taste.  I also tried canned asparagus for the first time, something I will never do again, definitely a vegetable that needs to be fresh.  And the directions on roasting red peppers were great and mine turned out perfect!

Asparagus is a great topping for pizzas; used previously frozen ones. I made the pizza with only vegetables and even added some canned pineapples.

Thought this recipe was great! Awesome for a light summer lunch.  I followed this recipe and didn't find the need for and changes. I did dip it in ranch but that's just me.

this has been our favorite dish so far. a little tough to make the crust of the pizza but got the hang of it after awhile. I had to triple the recipe to make for 7 people with only a few slices left over. it was so yummy and we will definitely make it again!!

Good taste with pineapple added.  We always use wheat tortillas as the crust for 6 minutes in the toaster oven.

Excellent! I made some changes.
*I did not use the onion. 
*Next time I will boil some chicken breast as canned chicken is high in sodium and CL. 
*added marinated artichokes and turkey pepperoni
*omitted the asparagus, peppers and feta
*Used veggie cheese
*used 2 packages of pizza dough
*Baked at 425 like the pizza dough package instructed


I used the liquid from the marinated artichokes in the chicken mixture while it cooked in the skillet. 
For baking I baked it for 12 mins and then added the veggie cheese and baked for another 2 mins

Wow, what fun, something different! I thoroughly enjoyed making and eating this pizza. The kids thought I was weird for making this until they tried it, then they too loved it. Used boneless chicken breast since I didn't have canned and put it all on top of the Bread Machine Pizza Dough by Kim on this site (added garlic powder and dried basil to it). I did add some pizza sauce to the pesto so the kids would think it more like "regular" pizza. I think it would be good without it, but that's what I decided to do this time.

This was good, but I used fresh chicken that I sauteed with onion and garlic.  I also roasted the asparagus a few minutes to soften it up, and added sliced roma tomatoes and some chopped fresh basil to the top.  Lastly, I prebaked the crust for about 5 minutes before I added all the toppings to finish baking.

This was great.Very minor changes: I used the one leftover chicken breast we had from dinner last night when we had grilled chicken....no canned chicken. I roasted my asparagus lightly first. I only used 1 clove of garlic figuring there was enough in the pesto already.Only thing I added was a dusting of oregano on top.

This was a really tasty recipe, but I did find it a little bit oily- probably from browning the chicken.  I'm allergic to garlic so had to leave that out, and my family thought it was good without it.  Since not all of my family likes asparagus we substituted artichokes instead, and used frozen green peppers/onions instead of a fresh onion because it is what we had on hand.  We also used a wheat pizza dough and fat free Feta.  We are planning to make it again tomorrow also!  We did use a pizza stone but did not need to coat the stone in a spray to keep it from sticking.

Awesome recipe!  Left out the red peppers and feta cheese, but it the best pizza both my husband and I ever had.  I'm sure it helped that I made home made pizza dough too.
