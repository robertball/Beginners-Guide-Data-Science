I chose this ice cream so that I'd stay the heck out of it, maraschino cherry and dark chocolate not EVEN close to trippin' my trigger.    Great choice because I knew it would still be right up Hubs' alley.  I scaled this to 8 servings to accomodate my 1-1/2 quart ice cream maker.  For added richness, I used my preferred ratio of 2 c. cream to 1 c. of half and half.  After I chopped the (high quality) chocolate it reaffirmed for me I had made an excellent choice to keep my spoon out of the bowl - TOO much chocolate, I thought!  After mixing in the maraschino cherry juice (which kind of weirded me out) it wasn't quite pink enough for me so I added a couple of drops of red food coloring, just to make it a pretty, soft pink.  I thought the amount of almond extract would be too much too, but I thought, "Oh, go for it.  Who cares.  You're not eating this anyway, and you'll stay true to the recipe for rating purposes."  I plodded on.  I knew the base would be good - rich, frozen egg custard, just what I grew up with in Wisconsin and adore.  I mixed the chocolate and cherries into the ice cream AFTER it was churned, as my ice cream maker warns against any add-ins larger than a chocolate chip.  I let the ice cream ripen in the freezer for several hours before I served Hubs his dessert tonight and, strictly because I had to rate it, tried a little spoonful.  And then another. And another.  Just like a creamy, chocolate covered cherry cordial I thought!  This stuff is awesome good.

This is an incredibly easy recipe to whip up, and the "wows" and "oohs" from family and friends that tried it makes it the most decadent ice cream I have made. I live in Fiji and maraschino cherries are not available. I soaked dried cherries in rum to hydrate, then followed the recipe. I used dark, bittersweet chocolate and chopped it semi fine and added it when the mix cooled. To die for taste and the presentation is beautiful. Thanks for a gourmet treat that can be prepared the day before, for an outstanding dessert treat!

This makes too much for the typical 1 quart ice cream maker.  Be sure to cut down the recipe so you don't have a mess on your hands.

This ice cream was amazing!  My husband declared it as his new favorite, and the kids devoured theirs as well.  The  consistency was VERY creamy, and it had a  really great cherry taste.  I will definitely be making this one again!

Great flavor! I used dark chocolate instead of bittersweet and it still tasted great.

Wow! This is the recipe I have been looking for. I thought there were a lot of eggs in this one compared to other recipes I found. But it is sooo good. I'm glad I didn't adjust. I had a hard time finding bittersweet chocolate, but I'm so glad I went to the second store and got it. This really is divine. I didn't change a thing except I didn't have whole milk so I just replaced 1 cup milk with the heavy cream. Yum, yum, yum!

I used Bordeaux maraschino cherries and Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate. I made the recipe as written and it was divine! The custard set up perfectly (I used a candy thermometer to make sure I got it right at 170 degrees).
Personal note: next time use more cherries and only 10 oz. chocolate. 1 full recipe fits great in my kitchen aid ice cream maker.

Rich, creamy, delicious.  I added 2 jars of maraschino cherries and it came out great.

Tried this recipe yesterday and loved it!! The only thing I changed was, I used double chocolate (Ghirardelli, yum!) instead of bittersweet chocolate. I wouldn't change anything else!

Very good! Made just as called for. It was about 2c. too much for my kitchen aide ice cream attachment, so I let it freeze up a bit and scooped some out and then added in the remaining. This is my husbands fave ice cream!

Very creamy, and delicious! stopped cooking at 170 degrees.  The only changes I would make next time, 1/2 the chocolate, double the cherries, and add toasted slivered almonds.  overall very pleased with this recipe!

Great flavor - I love cherry and almond together.  This makes a lot so I did it in two batches.  I cooked the entire amount and then only put half in the ice cream maker.  I washed out the maker tub, refroze it over night and then made the second half.  Because the mixture had been in the refrigerator over night, it froze quickly and didn't need to be in the ice cream maker very long.  I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips and thought they were too jarring when you had to bite into one.  Next time I will either use crushed Oreos or swirl in fudge sauce (do that quickly, right after it comes out of the ice cream maker).

This is a good recipe.  I think I will add more cherries next time.  The balance between cherries and chocolate is off.

I had great results from halving the recipe but using a full bottle of cherries. Rave reviews from all my friends.

I scaled down to fit my 2qt kitchen aide maker. Following above instructions I had a problem....custard curdled first time. Now,I have made lotsa custard and never had issues. I think it's the jarred Cherry juice. Second time I didn't add Cherry juice till after custard made and it came out great. I tweaked recipe to my liking and as soft serve it is an absolute copycat of famous B&J's (per my Hubby the taste tester). It's now in freezer to firm up for stepsons 17th birthday. This was his flavor request. I will post my recipe on all recipes seeing how it's my own version....look for it soon, once I have pic of finished product.

Oh, oh, oh, MAN is this stuff good! I used homemade maraschino cherries and juice and Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips. My kids and I had to taste test the custard part (before it was even cool!) because it smelled so good. 

I'm now out of cherries, so it's back to the store I go to start the four-day process all over again. Soooooo worth it, though!

Awesome I’ve cream! I halved the recipe, doubled the cherries, and cut the chocolate in half. This is an incredibly fatty item.  There’s nothing healthy about it. I put half and half instead of whole milf, and used regular whipped cream instead of heavy cream. You don’t need so many eggs (so much cholesterol). I will create a healthy version and post it shortly. :) Thanks for reading.
