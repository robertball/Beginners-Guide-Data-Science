This was very good. I used soyrizo instead of chorizo to cut back a bit on calories and grease. I browned up the meats and threw it all in the crockpot for 4 hours

This was a fantastic, quick chili. I made slow-cooker shredded chicken instead of using the ground chicken, but otherwise it was the same. And I always recommend using greek yogurt (in place of sour cream - more for the taste than the healthiness), cheese and Fritos on top.

I made this but the chorizo I used from Aldi was a bit vinegar-y tasting so I'd add a touch of sugar next time. I loved it and served with scallions, sour cream and sharp grated cheddar and cornbread muffins - it made enough to have next time for chili dogs and a few containers to freeze for another few meals.  The combo of Chicken and chorizo is an excellent blend.

Family hit!  I didn't add the beer as previously suggested was too much liquid. Also, used a little less chili powder as I was worried that too spicy hot.   Was asked if I could make it again this weekend...lol.

This is easy to prepare.  Kind of hard to go wrong.  I tastes really good.  In order to accommodate the taste buds of a five year old, I did "kick it down" just a tad by using only 3tbl chili powder.  For my beer, I used Smithwick's Irish Ale.  Like a lot of similar dishes, this one tastes a little better on the second day.  I will make this again.

I just made this for dinner tonight. I barely ever cook so have pretty much no cooking skill, but this turned out great! Per other suggestions I added a small can of corn and reduced the chicken stock to 2 cups (recipe calls for 3 cups). Also for the last part (where it says simmer for 30 mins) I ended up transferring it and keeping in on low in the crock pot for 30 mins, then on warm until dinner time. Very flavorful and hubby approved. Even my 1 1/2 yr old son approved! I topped it off with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. Will definitely make this again. I gave it 4 stars since I had to adjust the recipe by reducing the chicken stock from 3 cups to 2.

I halved the recipe, used chopped chicken, fava beans and chickpeas. Only used about 1 cup of chicken broth, and skipped the tomato paste.  This was delicious! Topped with grated cheddar and sour cream. Will definitely make again!

This was a really tasty chilli recipe. The minor complaint I have is that there seemed to be too much liquid -- three cups chicken stock and a bottle of beer -- relative to the other ingredients. I boiled off some of the liquid, but my wife said it was still too watery so we added another can of beans.
Changes: I added some celery, and since I had only one can of diced tomatoes I substituted some diced fresh tomatoes from our garden. Also my wife doesn't like as much spice as I do so I used less chili powder, and also substituted some smoked paprika and chipotle powder to give it some smokiness. I also used chunked chicken thighs instead of chicken burger.
But again, it was a big hit taste-wise and I'll definitely make it again.

The only change we made was the addition of a small can of corn.  Otherwise we followed the recipe exactly.  It's my new favorite chili.

This chili recipe is so delicious! I have a very picky family (two children, 8 & 14) that likes simple dishes. This was their first time trying chili and the entire pot was gone the next day. I made another batch today (four days later) from their request.

Had to use turkey because the store was out of ground chicken.  It was surprisingly delicious.  I will definitely make it again.  Picky hubby really liked it too.

I normally do not review recipes but this was too good to not review.  I made it today and my daughter who normally does not like chili loved it.  I will make it again and again

Loved it. I put it in the crock pot like the other reviewer and it’s still in there. Hasn’t thickened yet but I didn’t have any tomato paste so maybe that was it. Still tastes great. I will definitely make this again and again. Great flavors. I think next time I will make it spicier.

Tasty and easy. II used shredded chicken and chorizo sausage. Also more beans than recipe called for. I also cut the cumin in half... I’m not a big fan of the taste of it. Halving the recipe made plenty for 6 people.

What an awesome chili... First time making it & of course I didn't have any beer, so I used my favorite red wine instead & it is awesome. Perfect kick too! Thanks for sharing this gem with the world!

I've made this many times and it is a family favorite. I substitute crushed instead of diced tomatoes for a thicker consistency. I usually use less chicken stock than called for and add it last to control the thickness of the chili.

Super yummy! This is the one chili that my husband and I can agree on. It's not too spicy (easily remedied with hot sauce, if so desired) and the flavors are spot on. The leftovers rock as well! We served with green onions and shredded cheese on top, will definitely make this again!!

Super easy and yummy!  I did as others suggested and only added 2 cups chicken broth (I had broth, not stock) and happy with the consistency.  I think it would have been too soupy with 3 cups.  I used a bottle of Yuengling.

My son made this chili and it was delicious. He omitted the beer, and it was still great! He also added some kick to it, by adding some red pepper flakes. We all enjoyed it with corn bread muffins! We will make it again.
