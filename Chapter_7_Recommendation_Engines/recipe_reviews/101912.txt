really easy and super tasty! i don't usually eat much red meat but my husband does and so when i cook roast we have a ton of leftovers. i just used last nights leftover round roast and it came out fabulous. the only thing i changed was the vinegar. i didn't have white wine vinegar so i substitued it with rice vinegar which gave it a nice sweetness to it. great recipe! thank you!

Loved this!
I was looking for something to do with the leftover barbequed tritip from last night and this was fantastic as I allready had most of the ingredients.
I did switch up a couple of things such as- using vegetable broth instead of red wine vinegar, 3 tsp of dijon, 1 tsp of horseradish, red onion) (instead of green) and added some spinach. I paired it with leftover garlic mash.
My husband and I are in heaven right now. Thanks so much

Love the dressing for this. It does need a touch of honey to balance out the acid though. Just a little on the sour side. I did not cook the broccoli first. I was looking for a cold salad that didn't involve any cooking. After the initial taste testing I did add in some lettuce, cucumbers, and Parmesan. We like our 'garbage' salads! Thanks for the recipe.

I'm sorry, but we did not like this at all. The white wine vinegar just did not belong.
