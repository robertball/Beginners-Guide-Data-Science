This is pretty good and the perfect rating for me would be  4.5 stars. Like the previous reviewer said, it is sort of like a pound cake. It is light and fluffy not dense like your typical pound cake but the flavors are similar. Very quick and easy to prepare.

I made this last week for my Sunday School class.   My husband had me save a few pieces for us.   It is now a new family favorite!   it goes well with coffee in the AM or red wine in the PM.   It is delicious and very easy to make.   reminds me a little of pound cake but without the calories

I was surprised I really liked this cake. We tried it plain and it was tasty, but I could see having it with fruit and whipped cream or with icing. Would make again. I have a pan that makes 6 mini 3.5" tube cakes, and they over flowed although they were only filled halfway so would definitely use a bundt pan next time.

I do not give 5 stars very often but I think this deserves it was I like a dense cake. 
There are so many different versions I have made. My fav is: swap milk with eggnog, as a tsp of vanilla, depending on the occasion a pinch or two of pumpkin pie spice.  I wonder about adding instant espresso.

Had a craving for cake and thought I’d try this.  Not disappointed! So delicious and light!  Easy to make as well .  Just added a teaspoon of vanilla essence.  Being a coconut lover I might add some coconut next time.  But as per the recipe it’s a winner for me! Only giving 4 stars because I think my coconut version will be even better!

I made this recipe as directed.  It did need about 20 extra minutes to cook.  It was ok, mostly just tasted of condensed milk.

It had a dense crumb and was surprisingly just sweet enough. It was more of a snacking cake and was great with a cup of coffee. I sprinkled powdered sugar over the finished cake and then over each wedge. I also added 1 t. of cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg to the dry ingredients and 1/2 t. vanilla extract to the liquid ones. I increased the salt to a very healthy pinch; I estimate I put in at least 1/4 t.  Oh, and I did not make this cake three times as the "I made it !" feature says. Every click on this feature counts as a time you cooked it; I have only made this cake once!

I bake quite a bit, and like the reviewer Chris, we also threw ours away.  We followed the recipe exactly, very simple to do, it had to bake longer than was stated, and it just didn't work for us.  No one liked the taste or the texture.  The garbage disposal happily gobbled up this one.  Bummer!

Moist and light, almost spongy.  Sweet,but not overly  so.  OK taste, but nothing that  makes  me  want  to  make  it  again.

It was easy to whip up, but after 40 minutes half was still uncooked.  Unfortunately, I couldn't tell this with a tester and only found out after I turned the cake out and it collapsed.  I managed to put it back into the tube pan and after ANOTHER 20 minutes, it was cooked.  My next disappointment was that no one wanted to eat the cake!  It doesn't look very appetizing, and it's not very sweet despite the sugar and condensed milk.

I don't know what happened , but this cake did  not come out the way it was supposed to.  The texture was  heavy in the middle, and I had to cook it a good 10 minutes longer than stated time.  I have baked hundreds of cakes, and I never made one that I had to throw out until I baked this cake.  Very disappointed in the  result of this recipe.
