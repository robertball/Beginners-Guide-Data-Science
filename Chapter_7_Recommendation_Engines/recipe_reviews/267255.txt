Perfect as written! No changes necessary. The leaves that fell off of the sprouts while shaking were far better than any kale "chip" I've ever had. I'll be trying this recipes with the leaves only. Don't get me wrong, the vinegar/bacon combo was excellent on the roasted sprouts but I will be experimenting with just the leaves after this. 5 stars all the way!

Loved the recipe overall but I think I'll be cutting the salt back a bit next time round.

These were really good!  I'm not a huge Brussels sprouts fan, but wanted to try them in my air fryer.  I made them just like the recipe and did add bacon at the end.  They were very good and they only thing I would do different, next time, is to cook them just a few minutes longer.

I chose this recipe for the lower temperature of 350 F. It allowed the halved sprouts to be cooked a little longer without burning. Cooked for 12 minutes in pre-heated air fryer, tossing half way thru. Sprouts were just right. Omitted the balsamic vinegar as a personal preference. Will use this recipe again.

Made as directed! Totally worth it! If you aren’t a pepper fan, use a little less. Enjoy!

They were overcooked at 10 minutes. Perhaps they were smaller than the sprouts in the recipe. I will do it again but less cooking time because I love sprouts and the fryer.

My brussel sprouts were on the small size so I adjusted the time accordingly. I added the called for amount of salt, but would add less next time. Everyone said they were great. Will make again.

While the taste was good, I thought these were on the dry side.  My recipe looks like the picture but I had a lot of very well done leaves.  I have an 1800 watt air dryer and cooked them a total of 10 minutes.
