This was great! Kids loved it. If you like it thicker I would drain half the juice from the Ro-tel.  This dip would be good with bacon as well.

Ehhh, my family was not impressed. It’s an odd taste and it’s too mild/bland. We’re snacking on it while watching the football game but I probably won’t save the leftovers. It may have been a little better if it were spicier but I won’t make it again to try.

I made this for Family Dinner Night, and everybody really liked it. After dinner, I asked them to guess the secret ingredient (the pork gravy mix), and no one could guess or could believe it was in the dip. A definite keeper!

Yummy and interesting southern take on queso with the addition of gravy mix and sausage.  The family enjoyed it!  :-)
