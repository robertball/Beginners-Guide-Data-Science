My husband and I loved this rub!  The steak holds the flavor well.  I agree, it was missing something, so we added a little mesquite seasoning, and cayenne pepper for a kick!  Great!

I absolutely loved this! I made a few changes. Instead of the chili seasoning I used Fajita seasoning. I also did not have ranch. So I eliminated it altogether. My husband loved it anyways and told me to keep the recipe as I made it. We grilled our steak on the bbq and It gave it a nice carmalized coating! Delicious!!!

AMAZING! on our grilled London Broil!! I did coat the meat with a thin layer of veg. oil before the rub, and then let it marinate for several hours. Will be making this again soon! Like tomorrow possibly, lol.

This was very good on our steaks tonight.  I thought 1/2 cup brown sugar was a lot, so I cut way back, wish I had used more.  Made the homemade "chili seasoning mix 1" and the "ranch dressing and dip mix" from this site.  Everything else exactly as written.  Next time, up the brown sugar.

This was really great tasting. I used a homemade chili seasoning (AR recipe), bottled ranch dressing so it made a paste, and a combo of season all and beef fajita seasoning for the steak seasoning. This did not overpower the flavor of the beef either. Thanks, it was very good. I subbed as close as I could get to what was called for.

This worked out great for me. Only thing different I did was use homemade TACO seasoning mix and homemade ranch dressing mix. After I rubbed the rub on the meat, I drizzled a little worchestershire sauce on the meat. 

Different but excellent. And it worked nicely for a quick steak rub. Quick is definetely a plus in this house! Spicy at the beginning with a sweet finish. 

A+!

This is a staple in my house. I dont use the ranch mix because my hubby doesnt like it and I add TONS of cayenne (we like it spicy)I always triple the recipe and store it in my cupboard. I have used it on chicken, pork and steaks and even on shrimp skewers. I will rub it on and let it sit in the fridge for at least 30 minutes and then coat with the teriyaki sauce from this website and  VOILA, YUMMMY!

Used this last night and it was great!  I used everything, except steak seasoning, which I did not have, exact.  My family loved it.  They kept trying to guess what I put on the steaks.  I bet this would be great on pork chops too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had to use taco mix instead of chili mix and I used a LOT of fresh cracked pepper. I also cut back on the brown sugar a bit.  This made for some very flavorful steaks!

I've been making this rub for two years and it's delicious!  We primarily use with steak and chicken but guests rave about it.  I love that it stores easily and flavors the meat well even if you rub it on at the last second.

Hubby was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this steak.  I had a half a packet of ranch seasoning and a packet of taco seasoning at hand so I used those and added 2 servings of a ranch mix from the site - and it was the first time I didn't have to say anything about seconds, because the seconds were gone before I could say a peep!  Thank you for the recipe :D

Good but a little sweet for my personal preference. I think this would still be great minus the brown sugar.

This is an amazing rub. I tried it on steak the first time I used it and I don't believe I used enough. The second time I used it on chicken and lightly coated it with olive oil, coated it liberally with this rub, and seared it in a pan. It was absolutely delicious. No marinating or anything! Definitely a keeper!!!

If I could give this 20 stars, I would This is the BEST steak rub I have ever made. I make this in bulk just so I know I have some around. It also goes great with pork chops. The brown sugar and ranch mix bring out so much flavor it's ridiculous.

I made this but added about 1/2 tablespoon of dried mustard and a pinch of cayenne pepper. It was great. I will try it on ribs this weekend.

I tried this rub on a rib steak. The smell on the BBQ was fantastic. The steak was quite good but was just missing a little something. I will experiment with this recipe though. It certainly has potential.

This was a bit too sweet for me - next time we'll change it a bit according to suggestions and adjust the rating as necessary.
