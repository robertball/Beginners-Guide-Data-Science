If you too have an elderly father-in-law who continues to bring excess government radishes to your home, consider pickling them using THIS recipe! We’ve got 8 jars in the cupboard. I might start giving them out as office Christmas gifts with a beautiful garland around the top.

Only thing I couldn’t find anise pods so I used anise seeds. I gave  5  stars for ease and flavor.

Delicious. It stays crispy, perfect to add some tanginess and crunchiness to a sandwich.  Refreshing as well.
