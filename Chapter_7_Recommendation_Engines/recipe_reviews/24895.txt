Fabulous salad dressing! I did have to thin it out a bit as it was very thick, but overall it had a wonderful flavor.  I used Hellman's light mayo and light sour cream and subbed white wine vinegar for the tarragon vinegar as I didn't have any on hand.  I also added a bit of salt. This was delicious over a simple salad of mixed greens, sliced cucumber and tomato.

Very good, I served it warm over grilled salmon.  It would also make a great salad dressing.  I added a little more garlic for my taste.  I will make this again, thanks!

Really good. I added some capers and a teaspoon of anchovy paste before processing everything together, which added a bit more depth to the flavor. Used the dressing for salad but will definitely make it again as a topping for fish.

Very good! Didn't have tarragon vinegar or fresh tarragon so used rice vinegar and dried tarragon and substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream.  I think this would also make a super dip for raw veggies.

I followed the recipe except that I forgot either the chives or green onions (aren't they the same thing??) and it turned out delicious. The only downside is now my husband wants me to make homemade salad dressing all the time!

Very good dressing!  I made it low fat and used Reduced fat mayo and sour cream.  Very good for dipping and on salads!  Will use again.

It was yummy, but didn't quite hit the spot for me.  I'll try replacing the Worcester sauce with anchovy paste.

very good dressing but does need to sit and marinate for atleast an hour or so to  develop a nice flavour. Only thing i did different is not add dried tarragon (didn't have any) and added a sprinkle of sea salt.

I also needed a little more zip so used two cloves garlic, more onion and half the sugar. As mentioned anchovy paste is a good addition.  Makes it a bit more traditional.   If you dont' have any anchovy paste on hand (I didn't) try a teaspoon of oriental fish sauce.

Delicious!  Used half of a white onion instead of green(didn't have any).  Next time would maybe use a fourth.......but still really good.

This was delicious and so easy to make. I used all chives instead of chives and green onion, because we have a lot in our garden. Added about 1/2 tbsp of olive oil because it was a little too thick, and used vegetarian worcestershire sauce so we could all eat it. A very pretty pale green colour and a delicious taste too! Thanks.

I used more tarragon than called for and just about doubled the vinegar (I used apple cider vinegar because I don't have tarragon vinegar on hand) and sugar. I doubled the garlic and thought I could have quadrupled it to suit my tastes. We're using it as a salad dressing to go along side tilapia.

Delicious.  I added a little sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  I also increased the fresh tarragon a little, because I love the taste of tarragon.

This was really good.  A bit thick so I added a little bit of milk and it needed a little salt and pepper.  Otherwise, fantastic flavor.

Made just as directed - very yummy! Have used it over regular salad greens and also as a dressing for grilled chicken over greens. Will definitely make again.
