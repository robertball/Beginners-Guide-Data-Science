Since so many people said it was watery, I used one can of chicken broth and one can of cream of chicken soup instead of two cans of chicken broth.  That worked fine.

Really delicious basic recipe.  I used a bag of frozen corn and added chicken, carrots, mushrooms and some minced garlic.  I also used skimmed milk and then added powdered coffee creamer to make it richer.  I also added some instant potato flakes to thicken it up.  Absolutely delicious!

I loved this soup and so did everybody I gave it to. I would definitely make it again.

I figured from the start that it would be a bit bland for my taste so I added---

2 cloves of garlic
1 can of creamed corn, in addition to the 2 cans in the recipe
1 Tbsp of dried Rosemary
.3 Tsp of cayenne pepper
.5 Tsp of dried Oregano
.5 Tsp of dried Basil
2 shallots
.5 onion rather than the whole thing
4 cups of diced potatoes- rather than three

Used vegetable broth rather than chicken broth, to keep it vegetarian
I only used one can of milk. It seemed milky enough with that. I think two would have been too much for my taste.

I just followed the recipe and dumped everything into a big pan (diced the onion, shallots, and garlic). Then at the end (once the potatoes were soft) I turned off the flame and added the butter and one can of milk.

My Nana made this soup for me countless times while I was growing up. I never took the time to get the recipe from her. Now that she's been gone two years and the cold weather is starting up, I found myself longing for some comfort food. I sauted the onion with a clove of garlic before adding the stock and potatoes and also added a few chicken boulion cubes. When I tasted the soup, I nearly cried because it was so, so close to what my Nana made years ago.

I was looking for a base recipe and found this.  I ended up making quite a few changes.  I sauteed a clove of garlic with the onion, added a few dashes of garlic and onion powder and two branches of fresh rosemary to the pot when it was simmering and used half and half instead of evaporated milk because that is what I had.

I drained the corn and didn't feel like the soup was too runny.

We did not like this very well.  I love corn chowder but not this.  It tasted like evaporated milk.  I fixed it by adding a package of cheese sauce and some velveta to it and making it cheesy corn chowder and then we could eat it.  The stuff I just make up myself is much better.

Quick, easy, delicious! This is just like the old-fashioned corn chowder I grew up with. The ingredients are dirt cheap and it makes a pretty big batch. I love it.

This was great. I have made it a few times for 2 different groups and they all loved it. This is a keeper. Only thing I did was add cream style corn in addition to the regular corn.

This is a great basic recipe, but it needs a little tweaking to improve the flavor. I added onion powder and some minced garlic. When I saw that the consistency was rather watery, I added a can of creamed corn - this improved it greatly. Finally, I'm not a fan of evaporated milk in soup, so I just used regular skim milk. With a nice thick slice of homemade brown bread, this made a great lunch. Thanks!

Reminded me of corn chowder I would get when I was living in Maine! I cooked mine in a slow cooker for about 5 hours today, the potatoes were tender and the flavor was great. Thanks for the recipe :)

I added a couple tablespoons of cornstarch to one of the cans of evaporated milk to get a thicker consistancy. I did add a few spices (garlic powder, onion powder, dill weed, celery salt, chives, fresh ground pepper, little worchestershire, little hot sauce) but other than that, I kept to the recipe. Very inexpensive to make, very simple, very good. NOTE: This made enough for six lunches for me for during the week.

Delicious. Added onion powder, garlic powder, a little rosemary, a chicken bouillon cube and some season salt instead of regular salt with the pepper. Really tasty.

I served this at my gourmet grilled cheese party and it went over very well.  We added a bit of garlic powder.  4 stars just because it's a bit thin for a cream soup and it does need a little extra seasoning.  :)

I love this.  So quick and easy and full of flavor.  The only thing I did differently was to put the butter and onion in a separate saucepan and caramelize them before adding them to the rest of the chowder.  Two big thumbs up!

Perfect.  This is such a comfort food for me. I remember my mom and my grandma making it all of the time.  And when it comes to corn chowder, for me, the simpler the better.  I found so many recipes that just had too much going on.  THIS is what corn chowder is. :)  I did have to make a couple of variations due to what I had on hand and preference.  I cooked the potatoes first, and used red potatoes with skin still on, and I used frozen corn. I sauted the onions in the butter and added flour before adding the liquidsl, corn and potatoes, to thicken it.  And I didn't have canned milk, so I used the skim milk I had and didn't use chicken broth.  Also, I only had red onions.  I LOVE it! I'm eating a bowl of it right now.  lol... THANKS! :)

I found this recipe after looking in the fridge and realizing we needed to go grocery shopping!  I added and omitted what I did or didn't have.  I added 2 stalks of celery to the onion and sweated them for a few minutes before adding minced garlic.  In reading on the soup being watery, I sprinkled some flour and cooked for a few minute to make a roux.  I used 4 large and 2 small potatoes, then covered them with chicken broth and water enough to cover.  Simmered until they were done then added two chunked up leftover cooked chicken breasts and a can of corn to heat through.  I completely omitted the evaporated milk (lactose intolerant).  I added garlic and onion powders while cooking, and just before serving added some nutmeg.  The kids sprinkled cheese on theirs and had two bowls each.  This afternoon I had it for lunch, but felt it was missing something--added a splash of sherry and immediately knew that was the missing key.  I'll be eating and enjoying this for days.  Thanks!

I love this recipe!!!  I add diced potatoes and crumbled bacon to make it heartier.  It's also great topped with shredded cheese and/or sour cream.  I make it at least twice a month and everyone wants the recipe!

My family loves this corn chowder.  I do make a few changes though.  I decrease the amount of chicken broth and add a can of creamed corn as well.  This thickens the soup a little more.  This is great when you need to extend your meal for unexpected quests.  It increases very easily.

This is a great basic recipe! It is good on its own and really shines when the "creative cook" starts altering, adding and tampering with it.
I add tuna or crab or chicken... anything really!

I really enjoy this recipe because it is so basic and simple.  I do us whole milk instead of evaporated milk because that is what I have.  Also I add carrots and chicken.  This would not be complete without cheddar cheese for a topping.   I have cooked it in the crock pot and an electric pressure cooker with good results.  It is a little more runny than I would like, but delicious.

This recipe is made with ingredients that are often in my pantry, low in fat/calories, but the result is just "OK."   Anticipating this, I followed the advice of other posters and added some minced garlic, seasonings, chicken, and cream of chicken soup.   It was still too bland for me, but for some who don't like a lot of seasoning, it IS easy and filling.

This was okay, but I don't think I will make it again.  Needed to be thicker to be a chowder-this was more like a soup.

I'm a homesick Mainer looked for the chowder my mother and grandmother made.  This one is the one I was looking for- no bacon, no heavy cream- just simple, perfect chowder.  Thanks, 'Maineguy'- I knew I could count on you!

This recipe was very easy, but it was a bit too watery and milky for my taste.  If I were to make it again, I would double the corn and/or decrease the evaporated milk.  I also might have added more potato to thicken.  Overall, a decently tasty recipe with little effort.

Just like my grandma's....I made this with chicken, but next time i will make it with either bacon or ham like my grandma did.  For thickness I used cream style corn instead of corn kernels.

This recipe was more like corn soup.  It was super watery; I drained the corn first but still the soup was not chowder"y".  The flavor was good after I added chili powder, salt, and peper.  I will try to blend the soup before serving it next time to get a better consistency.

I pan fried some chicken in bites size pieces and then put them in. Other than that I followed the recipe. When it was time to serve, I brought out some shredded cheddar cheese (i'm a cheese-aholic). It was the best corn chowder I have ever made. My entire family enjoyed it so much that there weren't any leftovers. I even doubled the recipe!!!!

I drained my corn before I put it in, and only used one can of chicken broth.  It was still pretty runny.  I pureed it to see if it would be any better.  My husband said he really liked it, it just tasted like a big bowl of cream corn, not hearty at all.  He's now going to Krystal to get some food that will fill him up.

This  is just a good, old fashioned recipe that you can enjoy
 for what it is, or use it as a base for  your own "tweeks" .  For those of us that grew up in the era of canned milk that's what so many had in their pantry.  The taste is part of the "comfort foods" to some of us.  Once more, please rate it  just as it is, not what YOU make it into.

Very easy to make.  I made it vegetarian so I used vegetable broth in place of chicken broth.  I added diced celery and red sweet pepper for crunch.  To give it a bit of flair, I added a small can of diced hatch green chiles and a few dashes of ground cumin.  Delicious.

I really like this recipe, that being said I have only made it using milk or half and half and not evaporated milk. I've also added cream corn and regular canned or frozen corn. This is a great, easy recipe!

This was a good, basic recipe.  I like more flavor in my chowder so I added seasoned salt, garlic, thyme and sugar and used heavy cream instead of half and half.  It had a nice medium texture, not too watery nor too thick.  This will be one of my faves.

I made this recipe using a 32-oz package of chicken broth added additional corn (3 cans), plus several stalks of celery and leftover cooked chicken. The recipe yielded a large dutch oven of yummy yummy soup! I did not find it watery at all (perhaps due to the chicken as well as the fact that I drained the canned corn) and in fact I may reduce the amount of corn next time because the leftover soup could use a little more broth.  Will definitely make this again in the colder months to come!

Very good basic recipe. I did tweak it a bit as it wasn't very flavorful by itself. I cut the recipe in half as well and it made plenty. Since people seemed worried about the thickness I started with whisking butter and flour to start a thick base then added everything else. I also added garlic powder, dried onion, and a little chili powder.

This is my go to chowder when I'm having a tight week with the grocery budget. I usually add some shredded Monterey Jack cheese and thicken it up with instant potato flakes. My kids love it and I even made it for Christmas Eve dinner last year with cornbread on the side. So good!

This was a little thin but tasty.  I cut up and fried some bacon in the pot first, then I added the onion and some celery.  After the house started smelling yummy, I started the soup recipe mostly as written.  I like to top our corn chowder with some paprika when serving.

This soup tastes great! Made my own changes and added chopped chicken breast, red pepper flakes, and garlic. Omitted the milk and just used a flour/hot water trick to thicken the soup broth. Awesome!

A bit bland and pretty thin for our tastes. I did add garlic and some seasonings, including onion and garlic powders and poultry seasonings. Still not very flavorful. A good base though- if I had an immersion blender or regular blender would have blended to thicken up- with tweaking could be very good!

My family of Picky eaters loved this.  I only used 1 can milk as others suggested and put half the soup in the blender.  I also added some corn starch to thicken it up a bit.   This made alot more than I expected but my family devoured it.

This chowder was good as is, but, then, I scooped 3 ladles full of just the potatoes and corn and pureed them in my food processor. Next, I thought it looked like it needed something more, so, I steamed a 12oz bag of california blend veggies, processed it until the vegetables were chunky and added it to the soup. Now, it was superb, just the little extra it needed to make an excellent veggie chowder.

I combined a lot of suggestions others people have made on the chowder and I suggest others do the same and not follow it exactly. Much better with added ingredients and unless you enjoy yours thinner you will want to thicken it up.

This was great.  My three year old loved it and we had it for lunch a few times before it was all gone.  Like any soup, we kind of messed with it a bit, like adding in some diced carrot and seasoning it to our taste, but it was really nice and easy to have on a rainy day.

Very good.  Just the taste I was looking for.  My husband suggested next time, fry and crumble bacon to sprinkle on top.  Would be good addition, but this tasted like I had hoped!

good thing corn and potatoes are cheap, I was very dissappointed in this recipe. I expected something rustic and wonderful and got something unflavorful and blah.

I forgot I found this recipe on this site...because I have been using it for so long it has become like my own!!!!  It really is "depression era" in that is saves money with not having to buy meat, but fills the stomach and satisfies everyone.  I have to admit....I usually add shredded cheese and crumbled bacon to it when I serve.  Make sure to taste it and add plenty of salt to taste...that's the key.  Thank you...this has become a traditional family dish.

Mmmmm....this is a big bowl of comfort.  My family is experiencing some hard times and this was the perfect dish, both for its nostalgia and for its thrifty value.  I sauteed some aromatics: onion, carrot, celery, garlic in a bit of olive oil so I did not add the butter at the end.  I loved the flavor and the richness of the evaporated milk.  A wonderfully classic corn chowder.

Good flavor. We enjoyed it; however, next time I'll just use one can of broth & evap. milk. It seemed to have too much liquid. I'll also try the sauteed garlic & onion. On my second serving, I topped it with grated cheddar. That really added a lot.

I am eating this lovely chowder as I write this and I couldn't be more pleased!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and sauteed 2 cloves of garlic along with the onion and I ended up only using one can of evap. milk.  I also put 3-4 cups of the chowder in a blender and pureed it for 20 seconds then added it back to the rest.  I was really smooth and yummy!  Enjoy!

Good recipe. To make the chowder more interesting, I reduced the amount of broth by about 1/4, added chopped carrots, fresh thyme and garlic powder to taste, and a sprinkle of cayenne. Wonderful. For people who want to thicken the chowder further, you can use cornstarch (that's what's in canned creamed corn).

Very good soup. I added a bunch of garlic and some chicken. Based on the comments from others that it was watery, I made a roux and tried to thicken it up a bit. It helped a little, but if you want it really creamy I'd use half and half. (I used skim to help with calories.) Delicious, simple soup.

A good, easy recipe.  It needed seasoning, once I put that in it was really good.  I also substituted soy milk for half the evaporated milk and I pureed the whole thing since my kids hate "chunky" stuff.

This isn't too bad really. I added 2 cloves of garlic, and couldnt find chicken broth, so used Cream of Chicken Soup. Its not very thick, maybe the chicken soup is the reason why but it tastes good. Very creamy.

Really good.  This is my first time making corn chowder, and I loved it.  Wouldn't be bad it if was a little thicker but I can't complain for how easy it was.
