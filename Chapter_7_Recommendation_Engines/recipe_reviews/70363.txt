This recipe starts out with lots of flavors but got a little bland and I had to add a few more tablespoons of red chili paste.  There was lots of vegetables and proteins and the 4 cups of water definitely is not enough.  I added the coconut milk and the broth quickly became a murky orange instead of the tradition translucent red.  I would suggest not using the recommended 1/2 cup of coconut milk since it quickly overwhelms the flavors.

I loved this! It's very similar to my favorite Thai restaurant in the Bay Area.
