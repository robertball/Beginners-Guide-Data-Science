I added 1 half green or orange bell pepper for color as well as taste. I also substituted 1 bunch of green onions sliced thin and replaced regular tomato with a couple handfuls of grape tomatoes quartered. (Regular tomatoes were out of season)

Loved the flavors on this salad! I only had dried oregano, not ground and it still worked perfect. These softened in the fridge. Some at them with chips! So refreshing!
