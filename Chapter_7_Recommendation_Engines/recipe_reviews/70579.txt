I have made this recipe twice for crowds and it has been a big hit!  I only do 2 things differently.  First, I saute an onion in with the butter in the beginning.  Also, I have thrown in cubed potatoes with good results.  This is a great "cheese soup base" that could be varied many ways-- chicken, carrots, potatoes, Kielbasa, etc.

This was a delicious recipe...MADE CHANGES, but I don't think they were too drastic. The entire family from baby to hubby LOVED it. My changes were: 
1) used water and 3-4 Tbsp. chicken base paste (Tone's brand from Sam's -- no MSG)for broth,
2) Omitted salt, but used all that pepper! (Salt to taste before serving),
3) Cornstarch, for thickening: 1/3 cup mixed with a cup of the cold water or broth and brought to the boil in "step 1",
4) Broccoli: I steamed florets and small stems until just tender, then CHOPPED to my liking . I didn't measure, but would use more than two heads next time.
5) Added 3-4 Tbsp. white wine worcestershire. WOW!!!! If you can't find, try a small amount of regular.
6) Used 8 oz of sharp natural cheddar- no processed cheese. More would be even better.

This turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly after scaling it down to 6 servings.  I would recommend doubling the amount of brocolli.  DON'T FORGET TO SCALE IT DOWN. :)  Enjoy...

I had to go buy a larger pot to make this for my family it's so great!!  When making it in my standard 6 qt. dutch oven (making 12 servings) it would disappear so fast!  This is a fabulous base for any cheese soup.  As a broccoli soup it is wonderful so we decided to use the base for and try a potato soup and that turned out amazing as well.  Tonight we made it as potato soup and used 1 cup of margarine and 1 cup of flour.  We then use 7 cups of chicken stock and 7 cups of milk, 2 lbs of velveeta and 8 cups of shredded mild cheddar then added steamed potatoes, saut√©d onions and some shredded carrots. We always add more broccoli than it calls for when we make the broccoli soup and we like the broccoli stems chopped pretty fine.  I really can't rave about this enough as it is a huge hit with my whole family.  I'm thinking of trying it next time with cauliflower!  I'll let you know how it turns out but I'm sure it will be great too.  Also just to let you know we only lightly salt the veggies when we steam them then only use about 1/4 to a 1/2 of tsp of salt or it can get too salty but I do increase the pepper just a bit.  If you haven't tried this yet please do.  You'll be so happy you did!

This was the best broccoli cheese soup we have ever had.  Before my husband even finished 1/2 of his first bowl, he said, "I hope you wrote this recipe down."  I used only shredded sharp cheddar cheese and I added black pepper.  We grow our own broccoli, so the home grown flavor does help.  I have already made this three times and will continue to make it.  This is a definite keeper.

While this soup tastes excellent and my tastebuds are thrilled, I'm still rating this recipe one star in protest.    It has three fundamental flaws.  First off, it makes a ginormous amount of soup.  More than you can cook in a very large pot.  I believe in family size, but this is ridiculous.  I knew 18 cups of liquid sounded like a lot, but my lack of cup/spatial recognition now means I'll be having this soup for a month.  The top broccoli soup recipe should not be one for a party, it should use proportions that normal families need.    I'm also dinging this recipe for the processed cheese.  Call me a food snob if you want, but I don't want to live in a world where Velvetta tastes better than real cheese.  I have to imagine that there is an alternative with real cheese that tastes so much better.  Finally, this recipe is getting a one star shaft because it's way off on how much broccoli you'll need.  You can easily double or triple the amount and be fine.  I'd also recommend chopping the broccoli into small pieces vs. using  the unchopped crown.

I used steamed broccoli (with butter) instead of frozen- Boy does this make a difference!!! My hubby was digging out most of the broccoli for himself... :)  and its just as good reheated. **I'm doubling the amount of steamed brocolli in the future.**

Very pleasant and flavorful soup that aside from some onion and garlic needed no other flourish. Some broccoli cheese soups are TOO cheesy - a thick, pasty goo with not only too much cheese but too much flour as well. Not so with this soup. It definitely has a bold cheese taste but is still a light soup with great fresh flavor. My only criticism of the recipe is that to cook the soup any further after the cheese and broccoli is stirred in risks having the cheese separate and the broccoli overcooking, either of which would ruin the soup.  Once the soup has thickened, remove it from the heat, stir in the cheese, gently stir in the broccoli and serve immediately. Also, microwaving the broccoli florets made quick work of making this soup!

This recipe will replace the recipe that my mother gave me, for sure. It was so easy! The recipe was just right for our family of 6 with enough leftovers for lunch the next day for everyone. We did add more broccoli and didn't use the processed cheese, just added about a cup more of sharp cheese. My boys ages 10, 8 and 5 loved it. Served with crescent rolls. Yum!

This truly is "Excellent!" Followed recipe exactly, but next time I will add more broccoli and will try using just cheddar(more of) and not using the Velveeta. Fantastic recipe!

i tweaked this a little by adding 3 med. sized carrots and blanched them with my broccoli. i also added 1/2 of a med sized white onion to the milk/broth mix before it boiled and some nutmeg. after that had boiled i put half of my blanched veggies and half of the milk/broth/onion mix and blended it in the blender. i though that it made the soup a little "meater"

Whoa...My expectations were high when I found this recipe.  First of all, this is way too much liquid unless you plan to drink the soup from a straw. I started with 7 cups of chicken stock and 7 cups of milk, and I could have used 6 of each.  Also, I started with 5 cups of broccoli and then added another 5 cups.  If I would have had more, I would have added it.  I also added more cheese and thickened with cornstarch and water.... I will search for another Excellent Broccoli Cheese Soup..

This soup was great!  I did make some changes though, so I can't give it the full 5/5.  First, I added an 1/8 cup of cornstarch in when I added the chicken broth to thicken, then added the milk.  I used fresh broccoli and put it in boiling water for about 2 minutes, drained, and set aside.  I then used that same pot to  sautee half a large onion, 1tbsp of chopped garlic, and about 1 cup of shredded carrots.  I added them to the broth before I added the cheese.  I added WAY more cheese (all natural, not processed), about 6 cups.  I added a dash of nutmeg, worchestire sauce, hot sauce, and red pepper flakes.    Served with extra cheese shreds on top, some croutons, and bread on the side.

Wow this is sooo good. I used 6tbsp butter and 1/4 c flour. 3 cups chick stock and 3 cups milk. I used black pepper about 3/4 tsp could have used more. Cooked a chopped up onion in 2 tbsp butter, then added after I added the milk.  Also added  2 grated garlic cloves, and 1/4 tsp thyme. Then I added broccoli florets, shredded broccoli stocks and carrots, cauliflower, and 2 cubed potatoes.  Cooked until tender about 10 minutes and then whisked in cheese.  The best advice I can give is have everything ready and near by.  After you make the roux  have chicken stock within reach and slowly whisk in. And don't forget to stir a lot after you add the milk or it will burn to the bottom of the pan.  I only used about 8 oz processed cheese and 7 oz sharp shredded cheese. After the cheese is in it's done turn off the stove and eat with fresh baked bread or pita's I had some I need to use up.

Yuuuuuuummy!  I read through lots of reviews before making it, and I took the advice of the person that submitted the recipe and added more butter and flour to make it thicker.  I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings and added 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c flour.  I also used all cheddar and no processed, and added lots of it.  Came out delicious!!!

I have to give this three stars because as written it lacks some zip. 

First of all... I did not think this was thick enough. I like a little bit thick cheese soup. This was very runny and I used less liquid than it called for. 

Additionally it needed something. I ended up using 2 tablespoons onion flakes and 3-4 garlic cloves finely minced. 

I ended up only adding 1 cup of regular cheddar cheese and 1 cup of smoked cheddar and 1 cup of smoked gouda. Mind you, I'd used about 2 cups less milk and 2 cups less stock. 

Chicken stock wasn't quite flavorful enough so I added a bit of Better-Than-Bouillon to pep it up. 

Lastly, but by far the biggest issue in my eyes... this needs double or triple the amount of broccoli. I used MORE broccoli than it called for and even with the less liquid it was sparse. I added an entire bag of organic mixed vegetables since I had no more broccoli on hand.

After I made all those changes this soup was absolutely incredible. Sadly it doesn't even really work as a good base given that it's too runny for our preferences. But it is work-able which is why I gave it the 3 stars. 

I'll be making my version again and again though as we loved it. It was so tasty that my boyfriend actually asked "Does this have meat in it?" I said no, just smoked cheesed. :)

I urge everyone to sub the cheddar with smoked cheese too. 

On last thing. Don't waste your time trying to shred Velveeta, I sliced it into slices, then cut those into strips and they melted.

As the title says, "Excellent!" I made this during the holidays and, it was a hit. I had crumbled bacon, caramelized onions and roasted mushrooms, plus more steamed broccoli on the side for those who liked more "stuff" in their soups, rounding it out with crusty garlic bread. Oh boy! What a durn-good meal! Thanks Nathan!  ;O)

This is similar to a recipe I have made in the past. I really like it and followed it exactly with the exception of the finish. It was a little thin so I added about a 1/4 cup of instant potato flakes as it was heating to serve. I also take a potato masher and lightly mash the broccoli. Very easy and quick to make too.

If you can "taste the flour" or it's "too much liquid" then you haven't made your roux correctly..  Make sure the butter is sizzling before adding the flour and be sure you're cooking it long enough.  I haven't changed a thing about this recipe and its a winner every time!!

Excellent and easy. I halved the recipe and followed it exactly. Next time I won't use white pepper, but that's due to my own preference for black. Still delicious, though. And kid friendly.

Tasty! I had to make a few changes, but this was a good base. I made about 1/3 of the recipe. I added a small finely diced onion to roux. For my liquid, I used 4 cups homemade veggie stock, 1 cup milk, and 1 cup heavy cream that I had on hand and wanted to use up. I used extra broccoli, no proccessed cheese, and extra cheddar. I also blended most of it to make it creamy. I ended up needing more pepper than suggested as well.

Changes I made were few with adding a small chopped onion to the butter as one reviewer suggested, halved the recipe except for the broccoli and still came out with a LOT of soup.  Heavy on the white pepper and used 1 lb of grated extra old cheddar instead of the processed cheese.  Excellent soup. Adding to my regular soup rotation. Thanks!

I made my best broccoli cheese soup ever using this recipe ... with a few tweaks.  Like others, I like my soup thicker and richer.  I increased the butter and flour, making substantially more roux for added thickness.  Also, instead of milk I used light cream.  I had colby jack on hand and used that instead of regular cheddar, along with the processed cheese the recipe calls for.  I've sworn off meat, so used vegetable broth rather than chicken broth.  Also, like other reviewers, I doubled the broccoli.  That sounds like a lot of changes, but mostly I was just adjusting the relative amounts of the various ingredients.  This is an outstanding recipe, producing the tastiest broccoli cheese I've ever had.  Try this ... you won't be disappointed.

I saute onion and grated carrot in the butter. Then I add the chicken stock and broccoli florets and cook until the broccoli it's tender. I then take my immersion blender and blend it up. I then take a cup of flour and two cups of milk and whisk until smooth. I then add it to the soup stirring to make sure there are no lumps. I then add the cheddar cheese and stir until incorporated. I have had nothing but raves. The carrot is really important because it gives the soup a nice sweetness. I left them out once and the soup wasn't nearly as good. I guess the only thing I did differently is add carrots and onions. Salt and pepper to taste as needed.

I really liked this soup. I added 1 lb of crispy bacon and doubled the amount of Broccoli. I also added corn starch to make it soup extra thick before letting it simmer for a bit. Can't wait to make it again!

This soup is delicious!!  It is thick, creamy, and delicious.  The only thing I do differently is saute a mirapox (carrots, onion, celery) mix in with the butter before I add the flour!  My family can't wait till cooler weather.

Absolutely delicious! My husband and I could eat this for days at a time! I like to add some diced onion, minced garlic, and a few splashes of Worcestershire to the butter before making my roux. This soup is heavenly!

I did not care for this recipe. I thought the soup was just to runny. The flavor was good but it needed way more broccoli.

I used a lot of the tips from other reviewers which helped improve the soup. I also added a lot of bacon to make appealing to my husband, and it was fantastic. Definitely a hit with my family.

Hi, this is my recipe.  I just wanted to say that if you want to make this thicker you can just use 1 cup of butter (2 sticks) and 1 cup of flour.  Or even 1 1/4 cups butter and 1 1/4 cups flour, just keep increasing it in equal proportions until you get the thickness you want.  Also, I don't really like this or any broccoli cheese soup that's made entirely with cheddar cheese.  I like the taste of Velveeta and it melts very smoothly.  If you don't like Velveeta just use all cheddar.  Or any other cheese that you like.

This recipe was really good, but I had to work with what I had for ingredients so I had to tweaked it a little. Instead of using processed cheese, I used Kerrygold Dubline 100% natural cheese, it was the only other cheese I had in the fridge. I also added a little more natural cheese than what the recipe called for to suit my taste. I also added some sea salt and some fresh ground organic black pepper at the table, and yum, this soup really hit the spot!! Enjoy!

Love the taste.  I was one of the people who added twice the amount of broccoli.  I did make one BIG mistake, though.  Whatever you do, don't boil the soup after you've added the cheese.  My soup now has a "grainy" texture. Other than that, it's got a delicious taste!

This is the best Broccoli Cheese soup i have ever made. I think the idea of making the cream soup and then adding the broccoli makes it the best. I can now use this base cream soup recipe for any flavor of soup i wish. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  From the reviews, I expected superb soup.  It turned out watery too watery and made SOOO much it was just a mess to deal with.  I definitely recommend at least make only half a recipe if you want to try it.

I scaled this down to 8 servings so I could use 2 cans of chicken broth...and it was AMAZING. I used frozen broccoli florets (just cooked them lightly in the microwave then chopped them up before adding to the soup) and I only used shredded cheese (no processed). I used a colby jack blend because that's what I had on hand. I had some left over heavy whipping cream so I used it for half of the milk. A little more fattening...but certainly delicious for a treat! Again, wonderful soup! So quick and easy and creamy!

Yummy. Just what  I was looking for.  I did add more broccoli as the 5 cups did not look like enough.  I  steamed it and then put it through the food processor to very finely chop it.  I am not a processed cheese  fan, but since I happened to have some I used it.  It tasted good with it.  This makes a super huge pot of soup.  My 5 children and I ate it (husband won't go near soup...esp if it has broccoli in it) and its not even 1/2 gone.

This soup is wonderful!!!  My family now asks for it all the time!  In the middle of my sister in law's labor, she was begging me to bring this soup to her after her baby was born.  I do use a little more broccoli than is recommended, about 2 heads of broccoli total. Ill never make another broccoli cheese soup recipe!

Our family loves this recipe! As the recipe is written, it tastes a bit more like cheese soup with broccoli added to it. Our whole family likes broccoli, so we typically add more than it calls for. So if you're truly looking for a broccoli tasting soup, you can use about double the broccoli that it calls for, and not have too much!

I'm not sure why, but mine came out much much thinner than I was anticipating, which was a bit disappointing. In an effort to up the amount broccoli per other reviewers, I over-broccoli-ed the soup, which detracted from it a bit. Next time (and there will be a next time!) I'll not use so much broccoli and try to make it a bit thicker. Great start for a recipe!

I wish I could give this negative stars.  Horrible.  Watery.  Flavorless.  If you must make this, I recommend you scale it down to 3 servings so you don't waste good ingredients, like I did.

Great recipe. My suggestions are to scale it down to 4-6 servings the first time you make it. We made it for 6 and it was still quite a bit for us. We also used cheddar along with the processed cheese (for the processed cheese part it calls for), plus the cheddar it calls for. It balanced it out instead of giving it a too processed cheese taste or a too sharp cheddar taste. And the final thing was we used about a 1/2 cup more broccoli than it called for and we added halved baby carrots. Its the way it's made at this restaurant I love. It makes such a difference, soooo good! ;)

I didn't use the processed cheese as we don't really like it in our house. We prefer the real thing, so I just increased the amount of aged cheddar I used. I also cut the quantity WAY back, because it's just the 2 os us. Didn't really measure anything, jut eyeballed it. Instead of eating it as a soup, I poured it over chicken breasts and baked it at 350 for about 25-30 mins. I then served it over white rice to soak up all the yummy soup/sauce. We enjoyed it very much. Thank you for this recipe :)

This soup was pretty good, but I think that it had a little too much of a processed cheese flavor.  But it was really quick and easy to make.

I've made this a few times.  Probably going to make today, for my husband who is feeling under the weather.  

Changed the order of the steps, to save cleaning pots.  I like to halve the recipe EXCEPT for the broccoli -- I increase that.  Used 3 crowns, including some stems last time.  First I boiled the stems for a couple minutes, then added the florets for a few minutes and drained while moving on to the next step.  

In the same pot, I made the roux, adding some garlic and a bit of red pepper flakes.  Added liquids.  Added cheeses, and once those were melted/mixed in, I added the broccoli.  I didn't wait and boil as long between steps like the instructions said.  It still thickened, and the broccoli was tender.  

Everyone who has tried this soup really enjoys it.  I've made with both packaged shredded sharp cheddar, and hand shredded.  Both ways turned out well.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I cut the recipe in half although used the same amount of broccoli b/c otherwise it wasn't enough broccoli.  I had a 3lb bag of cut broccoli from Costco and used half of it!  I used a 32 oz container of chicken broth which is only 4 cups and 4 cups milk with 1/2 cup whipping cream since I had to use it up.  Not a huge white pepper fan so I cut that back to about 1/2 tsp (remember I only made 9 servings).

From initially reading the recipe I felt it needed a few tweaks.  I sauted an onion and several cloves of garlic in olive oil.  I used fresh broccoli and also fresh spinach, steaming both of them seperately. I kept them par steamed as they cook when added to the stock.  I reduced the stock, using 6 cups of water with 'Better than Bouillon' vegatable stock and 1/2 cup half and half and 1/2 cups of milk.  I used sharp chedder and Swiss cheese.  It's tasty!

This was my first time making a broccoli soup.  My family loved it, which includes an 8 year old.  It was even better reheated the next day.  I used fresh broccoli and doubled it to make it less brothy.  The cheese sauce was good, but next time I will try a cheese other than processed American, maybe Velveeta.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent thick soup! I used fresh broccoli & cauliflower. I didnt measure but think i used about 5 cups. I added a chopped shallot cooked in the butter before adding the flour. I also added a pinch of thyme & nutmeg & used half velveeta & half extra sharp cheddar. Wow! Hubby loves it & will definitely make this soup again. I made for 12 people & froze the leftovers so i got 3-4 meals.

Mmm mmm good! My husband said this was better than Panera Bread's! And, though modesty forbids, I nonetheless agree. :) The only thing I did was to add about half a cup of finely shredded carrots to the roux in the very first step. Oh, and I scaled this down to six servings, which was entirely adequate for the two of us. What a great recipe!!

Great! I changed it just like everyone else though. I had to ask my husband to try it because it's his favorite kind of soup and I had never had it so I didn't know what it was supposed to taste like.  So I gave him a spoonful and he immediately ate a few more.  I told him I thought it was good but didn't know what it was supposed to taste like and he said "it's supposed to taste exactly like that" followed by "that's the best I've ever had".  
So the recipe changes I made changed the recipe to this: (it made about 9cups)
3 1/2 Tbsp butter
3 1/2 Tbsp flour
1/4 Cup diced onion (added with butter)
2 1/2 cups of boiling water with 3 chicken bouillon cubes
1 Tbsp Italian seasoning
2 1/2 cups skim milk
Touch of salt
Smidge of pepper
2 1/4 cups broccoli (fresh)
6 oz cream cheese (I don't like American cheese) (cut into cubes)
1 1/4 cup cheddar (I prefer Tillamook medium) (shredded)
1/4 cup mozzarella (shredded) 
And then I followed the actual cooking directions here, it was great. Even my very very picky son liked it!

I scaled this down to six servings and followed it almost exactly (a little extra broccoli). It was, indeed, excellent and creamy.  An earlier review had cautioned against letting it boil after adding the cheese.  I didn't let it boil--just remain hot-- and it never curdled or became "grainy".  Great advice.........

I cut the milk and broth down to 8 cups each cut the processed cheese to 1 pound, and added finely diced sauteed onion to the flour/butter rue.  The flavor was fantastic! Really restaurant quality flavor, but very thin.  I like my cheesy broccoli soup to be thicker. I simmered for much, much longer time AND cooled and reheated later....still too thin.  I will definitely be using this recipe again...just with more rue.

I made it exactly according to the recipe (scaled down to 4 servings), except...
1. I used a fresh cheddar/white cheese mixture without any processed cheese,
2. I added half a teaspoon of Dijon mustard.
Came out great!

I made this for the first time today. I made a few changes, partly due to lack of ingredients and partly for preference. The butter and flour was per the recipe, but I had only 8 cups of chicken stock, so I balanced that with 8 cups whole milk. Instead of white pepper I used 3/4 tsp cayenne pepper (more or less - I didn't measure) and about the same in freshly ground black pepper. I didn't measure the broccoli, but I'm guessing it was closer to 6 cups, and just the tops and none of the stems. I cooked the flour and butter for 3-4 minutes, then added the stock, milk, salt and pepper. I brought that to a boil, took it down to a simmer for maybe 7 or 8 minutes, then added the broccoli and let it cook in the soup. I was trying for a smoother soup, so I scooped the broccoli out and into my Ninja food processor and pulsed it a few times until it was mostly smooth. (I would have used my immersion blender if I was able to find it, but I made do with what I had on hand.) The broccoli was still a little al dente, so it wasn't smooth like baby food. I put that back into the soup, then added 1 lb of Velveeta (it was all I had) and increased the sharp cheddar to 5 cups, then stirred until it was all melted and heated through. I'm not a soup fan, not by a long shot, but even I like this. I really liked how simple it was as far as ingredients and easy to make.

I was given almost exactly this same recipe from a cook at a cafeteria where I loved the soup. His recipe has a couple of minor differences but everyone raves about it. I use 1/2 pepper jack cheese and 1/2 Kraft Deluxe sliced American cheese. The reason is they both melt really well.I also add the broccoli right after the stock and milk start simmering. Cooking the broccoli in the broth flavors the soup and helps thicken it.
This is a great base for a yummy loaded potato soup as well. Just leave out the broccoli and add potatoes. When cooked, add the same cheese and top with crumbled bacon.

Easy & fast & great reviews from my family. Converted recipe to serve 8. Fried 3 slices turkey bacon with onions in butter then added flour. This was the only change I made to the recipe and my family loved it! Will definitely make again ... tomorrow night perhaps!!!

Very good soup with a couple of changes. I sauted sliced onion and garlic in the butter then added cubed potatoes. Cooked that in the broth until the potatoes were almost done. I added the chopped florets and cooked a few minutes more. Added in the milk and brought to a simmer. Off the heat I added about 3 cups shredded sharp cheddar. Garnished the bowls  with scallions. Tonight we're having the leftovers with the addition of crumbled bacon.

It's a pretty basic recipe, I highly recommend adding to it. I added bacon garlic and onion and fried them in a pan before adding them to the soup with the milk and chicken stock. I made this instead for two ppl so I put in for 6 so we'd have leftovers, the initial recipe portion is for 18 so be aware. I didn't use processed cheese, good broccoli soup you have to use old cheddar to get the taste through. Also for a roux 2 mins isn't long enough to thicken, i did mine for about 5 mins or until it gets mushy. Roux goes through stages from blonde and crumbly to kinda like a shortbread dough after that it's ready. Mine that way turned out like a chowder it was so thick. Also I used a cup of butter and a cup and a bit of flower, two stocks of broccoli, 3 onion 2 cloves of garlic. Note: it's good to add salt and pepper at the end to taste this way you can adjust it how you like. Happy cooking

LOVED the flavor of this soup...especially the next day.  The only reason I am docking a star is because the amount of brocolli the recipe calls for is WAY too low.  I bought a bunch, measured out what the recipe called for, cooked it, added it to the soup....and it dissappeared....so I cooked the rest of the bunch and put it in.  It was better, but I still ended up with about 4 bowls worth of soup base left over after we'd eaten all the brocolli.  Next time I will probably quadruple the amount it calls for.  Still...a great recipe :)

This soup is great; however, if you have a small family, try to divide the portions to reduce the amount of soup. Otherwise, you will end up with a full casserole of leftovers or a whole week supply.  Other than that, it is a great recipe with an awesome and rich flavor.

Awesome soup!  I've been craving some good broccoli cheddar soup like Panera's - but since I've become vegetarian, I haven't been able to (theirs includes chicken broth).  I used this recipe and subbed in Imagine's 'No Chicken' broth instead of the chicken stock.  For the processed cheese, I used American Cheese slices, since it was easier to tear up.  Thank you for this recipe!

Eh, what can I say? I really wanted to love this soup like all of the reviewers before me. However, I found it a bit lacking. Looking at the ingredients made me worry that this could be the case, so I made a few changes. I sauteed onion into the roux just before adding the stock and milk. I used a really flavorful cheddar and skipped the processed cheese (too gross) and instead used a nice Danish cheese. Adding the cheese reminded me of making fondue and so I figured a splash of white wine would add some dimension. I guess my attempts at amping up the flavor were feeble at best, but still, I was hoping that it wouldn't need my additions. Basically, it needs some oomph. I think someone before me mentioned bacon, carmelized onions, and red pepper flakes. Those might do the trick!

We were looking for a way to use up our leftover homemade turkey gravy and fresh broccoli from Thanksgiving.  When we came across this recipe using quite a bit of chicken stock, we knew we had a winner.  The gravy added the extra bit of thickness the recipe needed.  We did use more broccoli than the recipe called for to use up what we had on hand.  Other than those two modifications, this recipe was fabulous.  It was so good, now we're afraid to try it without the leftover gravy!!    We're not usually big fans of processed cheese, but I think the recipe needs it.  If we had used all cheddar, it would have been too sharp.    Really nice soup!

This is definitely the best broccoli cheese soup and it's so easy to make!  I scaled it down to 6 servings and it was plenty for a family of 4 to enjoy. And I can't wait to make it for my coworkers!

This is the yummiest broccoli soup ever! The taste is very well-balanced and it got me some great compliments last night. My mother in law even asked for the recipe! The best part: It's very easy to make. I made just a couple modifications: I added almost twice the broccoli that it asks for and sauteed the chopped up pieces in butter and just a little water, then drained the water out. I also added a tablespoon of corn starch for thickness (I had scaled the recipe to 6 servings!). Also, next time I'm going to try adding the flour after I've added in the chicken stock so it doesn't form lumps. Great recipe - you've got to try it!!!

Very good! I used a whole bag of broccoli florets. I could have used more too but it was fine this way as well. This is so easy and very good if you like broccoli cheese soup. I would definitely recommend to everyone. Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was great! I added more cheddar and also more broccoli. I also added some broccoli to the food processor along with a bit of the soup then returned it to the pot. It gave the soup a nice color and it made it a bit more textured. I added a pinch of nutmeg as well.  Everybody loved it!!!

I just made this for dinner, and it was soooo good. I made 8 serving, put 16 ounces of processed cheese and just kind of went with it with the shreaded cheese. I also added chopped potatoes. I used black pepper insted of white and topped with crumbled bacon. my family loved it.

After reading all the reviews I was excited to try this recipe.  I followed it exactly and it wasn't good.  Nobody in my family would eat it.  It did not have a very cheesy taste, but you could really taste the flour.  What a disappointment.

Outstanding!  As we were eating this, my husband kept saying "this is really good"

I used Kraft's cheddar flavored slices instead of shredded process cheese.  Also added more shredded cheddar tha the recipe called for.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.

My family loved this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except before adding the broccoli to the dish i chopped it up. I also served it in soup bowls, it was delicious! Thanks for the recipe! I will definately make this again and again.
My husband wants me to add "This dish is KILLER"! Thanks again.

I thought this soup tasted OK, but my husband did NOT like it.  I think it was because of the processed cheese (if he didn't know it was in there he might have liked it).  I probably won't make this again, but would recommend scaling up the broccoli.

This was indeed excellent soup, tasty and easy to make. I used 1% milk, slightly less butter, 1/3 cup cornstarch instead of flour, and sharp, aged cheddar in lieu of processed cheese. I doubled the broccoli (lightly steamed in the microwave before adding) and sauteed chopped shallots and a couple cloves of crushed garlic into the melting butter, as recommended by some reviewers--and I'm glad I did. Next time, I think I'll even add some steamed cauliflower. My significant other lamented that there was no meat in our soup 'n' salad meal, but two-bites-later he wasn't complaining, and happily took the leftovers for lunch. Yummy dish, and I will make it again!

Delicious & easy.  I zapped fresh broccoli in the microwave and processed it in my small countertop food processor to a slight chunk.  Gave the soup a nice texture.

If you want CHEESE soup for a party, this is the recipe for you. If you actually LIKE broccoli and want to make a meal for your family, you'll have to make quite a few changes. 1. Steam the broccoli, don't boil it. 2015, folks‚Äîdon't boil all the goodness out of your vegetables. 2. Use a HUGE stock pot‚Äîor halve the recipe. 3. At least double the amount of broccoli (I tripled it and my soup is just light green in colour). 4. Add an onion. 5. Puree it. 6. Use REAL cheese. I have a hard time believing people still use Velveeta, but to each his own.

The recipe was really good.  It had really good texture & flavor.  We like a little more thickness to our soup though & would probably add more broccoli or some potato.

Delicious! Needed to split the recipe in half, since it's only me and my husband, but it still worked out great. I added extra broccoli, some carrots and onion, and that's just because I love veggies in soup. The best thing about this soup is that it's creamy without being overly heavy. That is, while it's definitely a filling soup, it isn't so heavy that I feel weighed down and like I need a nap after a small cup size serving. Even though this is the kind of soup where a little goes a long way, it's tasty and a keeper!

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't thick enough for me, i think if we would cut back I the broth and milk by two or three cups it would be perfect!

I brought the recipe down to feed 9. I used 4 and a half cups of broth,steamed the brocolli with butter but changed two things. Instead of 4 cups of milk I used 3 and 1 cup of sour cream and 1/2 of heavy cream, this added thickness without losing flavor. I've made it many times before and it was a bit to loose. This addition really made it great!

It looks delicious, but I think the nutrition facts about the  fat is really incorrect, how could all those fats amounted 18 servings would only be 40% of 1 person 2000 calories diet-if I don't know about the real you want to tell about the nutrition data, just tell me

I did not use processed cheese but white sharp cheddar instead. I also added onions and carrots and steamed the vegetables together before adding. By far the creamiest Broccoli Cheddar soup I've made! Thank you All Recipes!

I've never made soup before especially cream soup. I read thru the reviews and used 1c:3/4 butter/flour roux adding fresh onion but lessened the liquids to 4c broth 4c cream (because I didn't want 18 servings!) then adding broth to thin it out. Another suggestion that worked very well was in lieu of processed cheese (Velveeta) I used softened cream cheese and an additional 2-3 cups of shredded cheddar. I pretty much just kept adding cheddar until it was the color I wanted. Almost 6 cups. We steamed 7c of fresh broccoli because we love broccoli! Next time I'll use 1/2:1/2 for roux. The soup was REALLY thick.

Scaled down to 6 servings and sauteed up fresh garlic with the butter and used chicken broth.   Had to add more flour to thicken it up and next time will use more broccoli, not too bad at all.  Used the immersion blender to break down the broccoli for Mother.

Great for a cool day. This got rave reviews from my family. I reduced the servings to 4, and used a microwaveable package of frozen broccoli. I love cheese so I added an extra handful.

This soup is delicious, and for those of you who rated one star because it yielded too much soup, I suggest you learn to read and see that it says that is yields 18 servings.  If you didn't want that, you should have scaled it back.  It is completely unfair to rate a recipe one star, and then add that it tastes delicious. Don't blame others for your illiteracy.

This was an easy recipe to follow. I found it a little too cheesy for my taste but the kids loved it. I only used 4 cups of chicken stock and 6 cups of 1% milk. Next time I will use less cheese and more broccoli.

This was wonderful!  My family has a soup exchange once a month & this was my March contribution.  It got rave reviews.  As one other person did - I also saut√©ed an onion in butter and added to soup.  This recipe is a keeper!

I thought this recipe was good. But I like my soups more chunky and cheesy, so I added twice as much broccoli and about another two cups of sharp cheddar. Delish!!

I tend to like a brothy soup and this one is pretty thin as written. If you want it thicker, make adjustments by reducing liquid by at least 25%. I also reduced the amount of processed cheese by 25% and it was delicious. Will use this again. It's a great recipe.

Vegetarians:  I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken stock and it's excellent.  Very flavorful - did not feel like a sacrifice.  Like others, I sauteed finely chopped onion with butter and added a scant 1/3 cup of corn starch blended with cold water to increase thickness to our personal preference.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent soup!  Changes I made were:  I sauteed off one large onion, 2 potatoes, 3 carrots and pureed this along with 75% of the broccoli (stems and all) in about 1/3 of the milk/broth mixture.  I also added white wine, worchestershire and a few T of dijon.  Excellento!  And so is the rest of the white wine :)

Just finished making this for my family for dinner!  It is by far, the BEST broccoli cheese soup I have ever made!  Years ago, as a tween, I came down with mono after a family vacation.  My aunt made me the best Broccoli cheese soup ever!  I have searched for years now trying to find something even close.  This recipe is what I have been in search of!!!  Thanks Nathan!!!

An absolute dinner party hit!  I made no significant changes- just added cheeses that we preferred like sharp cheddar and more Velveeta.  The white pepper gave the soup a unique flavor.  I will make this again and again!

This soup was phenomenal!  I am a cheese lover, so I liked the ammount of cheese that went into it.  It was great with French bread with butter.  It even reheated well, and made for tasty leftovers.  My husband is a picky eater, and does not like rich, spicy or heavily seasoned foods, but loved this!! Our ONLY suggestion to anyone making this, is to use A LOT more broccoli, as it did not seem to have enough.  I used broccoli spears that I steamed, and that tasted great.  Otherwise this soup was SO good.  (a definite suggestion, is to also scale the recipe back A LOT.  I calculated for 6 servings, and still had WAY too much)

I converted the recipe to 4 servings and it worked out perfectly.  I used a steamer to cook the broccoli and added a carrot as another reviewer suggested.  I used my Bamix mixer to blend everything together for a smoother consistency.  Finally, I made some buttered croutons out of cheese bread as a garnish.  Wonderful flavour.

Very tasty.  I used all cheddar and added onion and garlic to the roux.  Wished it was a bit creamier/ thicker in texture.  I blended the whole thing and like it better that way.

This is the best broccoli cheese soup I have ever had but I did add 1/4 of a chopped  onion to the butter. I also added a package of frozen broccoli florets to the fresh because it didn't seem like it was going to be enough.  Loved it!

Loved this recipe. I've been pining for years over not having a Panera in Utah, now I don't know if this tastes the same, but it tastes so good, that I no longer care about Panera. 

Anyhow, I halved the recipe, since we're a small family. But, I put the roux at 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp of each butter and flour. I also used 1 cup of heavy cream,(and I thought the thickness was fine) since I had it and wouldn't use it for anything else. Left out the salt and pepper and put in garlic salt instead... personal tastes there. 

I surprised that my husband loved it as much as he did. I didn't think he'd be a fan of broccoli cheese soup in general but he LOVED this! YEA!  

Does anyone know if this freezes well?

Good soup. I can't say it's the best because I haven't tried every recipe, but it is very good. I will probably tweak it here and there, but it's an excellent start. 
My previous recipe was watery, washed out looking, and very time-consuming. This has better texture and color, and is much easier to fix. And it tastes better as well! 
Many here advise adding more broccoli, and I agree. The only change I made was doubling the amount of roux. My biggest gripe about the other recipe was it was too thin. I have learned that adding cheese doesn't thicken the soup at all. If it's too thin before you put in the cheese, it'll be too thin after. 
Overall, an excellent soup that will be a regular for me.

This turned out great. I used half and half instead of milk, fat free cheese and corn starch to thicken.  It was the best recipie for cream soup.

This is an excellent soup!!
My daughter is a vegetarian so I simply use water instead of chicken broth.  I also use a little more cheddar/a little less process cheese.  I break in half and cook about a forth of a package of thin spaghetti noodles and add it to the soup after it is done. 
It is quick, easy, versatile, hearty, and very very tasty. The leftovers taste even better the next day.
(You might have to stir in a little bit of water to the leftovers as this soup does tend to thicken up a bit in the refrigerator.)

This soup has a very good flavor.  I made a couple changes though.  First, like many reviewers I omitted the processed cheese and increased the regular cheese to around three cups(for 1/3 recipe size).  One problem I had with the soup is that it is white with green broccoli in it.  I took about 1-2 cups of the soup and put it in the blender with 1/2 cup thawed spinach.  Then added it back to the soup along with the cheese.  This made the soup have a great color and didn't really change the taste.  Next time I would also increase the flour by about 1 tablespoon(for a third of the recipe).  It was a little thin.  Other than that I would definitely make again.

I made this last night for dinner.  We thought it was really good.  The only modifications made were adding a bit of fat free half n half as part of the liquid total.  We also sprinkled on a bit of thai chili powder on top for extra zing.  This is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing it.

I made this for myself and my roommates.  We all loved it.  I made some changes, because I'm allergic to onions & garlic ( obviously I omitted them).  But I added boiled potatoes (peeled and diced); bacon bits; instead of processed cheese I used three pounds of shredded cheese (Munster, Swiss, and Montery Jack).  The potatoes and bacon made it a bit thicker for the guys.

This was a good recipe, but makes sooooooo much soup! More than a family's worth and we're only 2 people! 
My husband doesn't like broccoli but this soup turned him around on that. 
It's a good base recipe to tweak on my further attempts at making it.

As a caterer, I have many recipes for soup, including broccoli cheese. I did try this recipe and found it to be very good. If you like cheese and broccoli, this is a great meal. The only change I made was 1/2 milk and 1/2 heavy cream for a richer soup.

Nice and simple (as well as quick) to make. i served with some crumbled bacon over the top of each bowl. Added some wild rice to the leftovers the next day, and it was equally good and filling. Don't care much for the processed cheese taste, so will try something different next time.

This is an excellent broccoli cheese soup. But honestly, WAY more time than I want to put in; took over an hour of constant hands-on preparation. All the stirring and stirring and stirring to keep the liquids from scorching on the bottom of the pan; just demanded constant attention; I grew tired of standing over that pot! Like other reviewers, I sauteed onion/celery/carrot in the butter first, to pump up the veggie quotient. And I stuck with the submitter's choice of block cheese and shredded cheddar. I had my husband chop the cooked broccoli before adding it to the soup (I couldn't stop stirring!) and he "pureed" it in the food processor. So, not very attractive, but it thickened the soup nicely and was delicious!

We really enjoyed this soup. I did make a couple of adjustments to the recipe. First I adjusted the recipe to make 6 servings, then I sauteed  2 cloves of minced garlic in the butter before making the rue. I also replaced 1/2 of the milk with heavy cream.

I made it and loved it.  The soup is very easy to make and it taste great.  I didn't do to much different.  I added a bit of onion, cayenne pepper and did not add the processed cheese otherwise I stayed to the recipe.  I will definitely make it again but will use a little less salt next time.  As a side note this is a great base recipe for any creamed soup.  I am going to use it to make potato soup and will add chives and ham cubes along with the cheese

Made this for a crowd for a weekend get away and not a drop came home.  I did add onion and carrot to the butter and some additional cheese - small Wispride container - for a sharper taste along with more broccoli.  If was delish and will definitely make it again.

I have made this soup several times.  not only does my family love it , but  it makes such a big batch that  i was giving it away.  everyone i gave it to loved it.  I like that the recipe makes a lot.  we make up a batch and we freeze the leftovers for future meals.  I have to hurry  and set aside left overs before everyone eats it.  What I like to do is wait for broccoli to go on sale, then i buy a lot.  I use the stems for the soup, just  remove the very bottom of the stem. remove the leaves. 
 cut into smaller sizes.  boil them until they are tender, but not soft, then make the soup as the recipe states.  I do however use real cheese.  my only complaint is that the recipe is too hard to find even on the Allrecipes  site.  I keep losing my copy.  BTW this recipe would be very easy to scale if one knows simple math.

While I enjoyed this soup, there was an after taste  that came from the processed cheeses. I think next time, I'll buy fresh cheese from the market or deli and grate it myself, see if that makes a difference. Other then that, this is my go to cheese soup! Thank you

Tastes good, but came out grainy? I didn‚Äôt feel like there was enough broccoli in this even though I used the recommended mount of broccoli but halved the rest of the recipe. I also used unprocessed cheese which may have affected the texture. You may get better results if you substitute some of the milk for a little heavy cream to smooth things out.

I love Broccoli Cheese soup, when made correctly. At first I thought it wasn‚Äôt going to thicken up. But after adding the Broccoli and letting it simmer on very, very low heat, it did. Also at first there wasn‚Äôt much flavor to it. But after sitting on the stove for about an hour (with the burner off) the rich cheese flavor was there. I can say this is one of the best Broccoli cheese soups I‚Äôve made. My only suggestion it to let it simmer on the lowest heat possible to let the ingredients come together better. Or just turn the burner off and let it sit there for about an hour. If you have too much heat from the burner, you will get a thin layer of burnt cheese on the bottom. If this does happen, don‚Äôt scrape the bottom until your ready to clean the pan.

The only reason I‚Äôm giving it two stars is because it was literally just okay. None of us said we didn‚Äôt like it but we all had complaints.  First, as some others stated it makes way too much broth with not enough broccoli. So I set it to 10 servings which still was a lot of broth and I had to add more broccoli, which I luckily had. I did use vegetable broth instead of chicken as I am a vegetarian so it did give it a darker color and I‚Äôm sure the taste was a little off from the original recipe. As another reviewer stated, I must be a food snob because there‚Äôs no way I am putting processed cheese into my soup. So I used a block of sharp cheddar that I grated right before putting it in. Even after I put in the full amount stated for both cheeses it wasn‚Äôt enough and the cheese separates from the broth giving it a curdled look. The taste is very bland and we each had to add our own spices, sauces and such to give it more flavor. I won‚Äôt be making this again as I have had far better broccoli cheese soups. Sorry!

Only things I did different from the recipe was sauteed finely diced onion and garlic in the butter before I added the flour. I also just threw the broccoli in the stock and milk. Why dirty another pot? Finally, I gave it a couple pulses with my immersion blender. Hubs is eating it right now. I better go get some before he eats it all! :)

Everyone loved this!!  I was looking for a "crowd" size recipe and this one was spot on.  We fed a dozen hungry family members and they all came back for more!!  The only thing I would change next time is to add more broccoli.

This was excellent - everyone enjoyed including the 17 and 14 yr. old. I made a few modifications, I used almond milk and vegetable broth. I nixed the velvetta - not a fan of the excessive processing or the flavor, instead used 5 small packs of sharp shredded cheese. I used 2 very large bags of pre-cut brocolli- the more broccoli the better.  I used 8 cups of almond milk and 8 cups of veggie broth - I think 7 cups each is the right # if you prefer less liquid. I have a family of 5, this was enough to serve as a 2 day meal. Overall Great recipe, just tweaked to fit our dietary preferences. Thanks for sharing!

My kids said it was Pinterest worthy. :) I halved the recipe, and it was still a ton. I also just cooked the broccoli in the soup instead of separate.

This recipe is a good base. I changed the serving size to 6 and added 1/3 C diced onions that I sauted in butter. While they were cooking I made the roux in a soup pot  with 1-2 T butter and 1/3 C flour slowly adding milk,cubed processed cheese, cheddar cheese and one 14oz can of  chicken broth instead of the chicken stock.I cooked this until thickened stirring constantly. I added the onion as well as 4 C fresh broccoli and 2 cooked cubed chicken breast.Cooked additional 10 minutes. It made enough for  3 meals for my husband and I

I wanted plenty of leftovers, but feared my pot wasn't big enough for the full recipe, so I wound up with probably 12 servings with these measurements: used 6T of butter  and added 1/2 of a sweet onion, chopped,  and cooked until the onion was soft. I added 6T of flour to make the roux. To this I added 6c chicken broth, 3/4t salt, & 1t white pepper.  I used 5c frozen broccoli and a handful of chopped baby carrots. I boiled those in some salted water for a few minutes and added half of them to the broth mixture.  I brought everything to a boil and used my immersion blender to smooth it all out.  I also added 1/4 c cornstarch and 1/4 c water to thicken it up.  I then added 2 1/2 c cheddar and a pound of Velveeta and stirred until melted and then 6 c milk and heated until warm.  It was good but needed something, so I added 1 t of ground mustard and a couple shakes of Worcestershire and it was absolutely perfect!

I made it for six servings. I saut√©ed shredded carrots, diced onions, sliced portobello mushrooms, and minced garlic for a few minutes then added that after the milk and chicken stock was added. I also used a blend of extra sharp cheddar, sharp cheddar, a little parmesean, and a little Velveeta for consistency. I've made this twice in the past week. my husband and I both love it. I really like the earthiness that the mushrooms bring to it. Definitely a great recipe with a few tweaks.

I followed this recipe exactly except for scaling it down to 4 servings. I like the combination of cheeses in this soup. I also like the way the broccoli is cooked. It's perfect...not overcooked and not undercooked. I prefer much more broccoli in the soup, though. It needs to at least be doubled.

I made this over the weekend and am now making another pot of it! I did add onion & garlic to the butter but that was it. I also steamed the broccoli in the microwave instead of cooking it in the stove. I made a half batch last time, but I'm doing the full batch tonight. very this recipe!!

A decent recipe.  When you make the roux, continue on in that process and make a bechemel by adding a cup or two of the milk in the recipe and slowly added grated cheese (mild cheddar, sharp cheddar, jack, or even more expensive cheeses like a gruyere or other swiss, but no American cheese). Even add cream cheese at this point for that ultra smooth texture if you like. One simple extra step to get real cheese flavor.

This was good but a little too watery for me. The next time, I would try cutting both the milk and broth by about a cup (and leave cheese amounts as is). I used a little more broccoli, microwaving for a few min. Also added a little garlic and onion powder.

The first time I thought maybe I didn't let the butter and flour cook long enough because the milk and water started to curdle as I began adding the cubes cheese. The second time around I began cooking the butter and flour longer than two minutes and started adding the milk and water. I'm trying to make this recipe without chicken stock and many times when the recipe called for chicken stock I ended up using water and everything turned out fine. I am extremely disappointed that two times I've tried to make this recipe and the milk mixture cream mixture whatever in the pot ends up looking curdled. The texture ends up being grainy and sand lik.

Great soup but I doubled the flour to make the soup thicker and tripled the amout of broccoli.  
Tastes great as a thick creamy hearty meal.

I reduced to 6 servings. I used 1 box of vegetable broth and 2 cups half and half. I did not use velveeta. I used 2 cups of sharp cheddar and a teaspoon of nutmeg. This soup was soooo good!! I ate so much that it was ridiculous.  Will definitely make several times this winter.

I have made this soup several times! I usually cut it in half and it provides plenty of leftovers for our family of 6.  (It is great reheated).  We always add several other veggies like carrots, onion, mushrooms, cauliflower,  etc.  It is our go to recipe for soup.

This soup is delicious! I made 2 minor changes, added onion with the butter and substituted vegetable stock for chicken stock. I steamed 3 heads of broccoli and then put half through my food processor before adding. This is a soup that I will make again and again. Thinking about making a cauliflower cheese soup as well.

I tried this recipe using 3 servings which called for 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of broth.  Skipped the 2 cup of broth and the processed cheese, only used milk and cheddar.  It made a creamy and yummy soup that everyone loved; very easy to make.

This soup is really good and I only added 2 things: a little onion powder and some grated carrotts.  It makes a good amount which is nice so you can freeze it and have it handy.

I ended up using a chicken stock paste I mixed with boiling water and it has bits of onion and carrots I think, but it was delicious! Next time (and for the leftovers) I am adding double the amount of broccoli.

Great Recipe! This will be a nice base that I will remember.  I scaled it down to serve 8 and put a potato and a shredded carrot in the broccoli water first and boiled until almost tender than added the broccoli.  Also cooked up 1/2 onion with some minced garlic and threw that in also. Also omitted the processed cheese altogether and just threw a 12 oz bag shredded cheddar.  Next time I'll probably  put more of all the veggies and maybe a little less cheese.  Mine turned out plenty cheesy. This is a great base to get creative with!

This was a fabulous base soup, and VERY easy to make!  I added a few ingredients to make it a complete meal for my family:  approx 3 cups cooked, diced chicken breast and 1 bag medium egg noodles, cooked.  My family loved it!  I think I may cut down a bit on the cheese next time, as 1 1/2 lbs made it plenty cheesy. Will definitely add this to my list of favorite recipes!

I used skim milk and cut down on the cheese.  Also added a large chopped onion to the butter for more flavor.  Next time I will add 2 onions for even more flavor.  I added 4 chopped red potatoes and 2 cups of frozen chopped spinach to make it more of a hearty dinner soup.  My husband and I loved it  for dinner.

I used extra sharp cheddar to taste instead of velveeta and it was so good! If you hold off on salt until the end, you can tailor the saltiness of the soup. It's really good.

Taste was excellent, but I prefer a thicker soup.  Next time, I will definitely double the roux.  I attempted to thicken at the end by adding instant potatoes.  It did thicken but changed the smooth texture.  I will defintely make again, and am looking forward to tweaking with other ingredients like ham, other veggies, etc.  Thanks!

A really tasty, cheesy broccoli cheese soup.  My technique when making the roux needs some brushing up as the cheese somewhat curdled after melting.  I will attempt warming the milk before adding next time I make this yummy soup.

Taste was good, but way too much soup.  I just froze 3 big containers of it for later.  I used my emersion blender, which made for a creamy texture.

This was a great rich tasting soup.  I scaled the recipe in half and only thing I would do differently next time is omit the salt because the processed cheese and chick stock would have been enough sodium & you can always add to your taste if you want more upon serving.

I made this soup for a church supper and got raves!!  It is soooooo good!  I was surprised that is wasn't thicker, like other raters have said.  Next time I might try making it a bit thicker.  But it was so tasty.  I used a bag of broccoli from Costco, and left the pieces rather large.  I got mixed reviews about that.  Of course, the one who doesn't like broccoli said the pieces were too big.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

I loved this soup. I found it very easy to make,and quite delicious!! I scaled it down to feed 6 and it worked out well for the 3 of us.(I kinda figured they would want more then one bowl)I will certainly make this again, but next time I'll add more broccoli. Thank you for a great recipe

Pretty good, but I was hoping for a thicker and creamier soup.  Also, I think the scale should be adjusted - there is not enough broccoli for the amount of broth.  I think what I'm looking for is more of a traditional cream of broccoli soup, but thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed it exactly after scaling it down & doubling the broccoli because I like a lot of broccoli. The only thing I might possibly change next time is using something to thicken it up a little bit. I like cheese-based soups just a little thicker. Very good though!

I scaled it down just in case we didn't like it.  It was great!  I used just shredded cheddar cheese (3 cups) and it got a little 'chunky'.  But I think I read somewhere that if you toss the cheese with just a Tbsp or 2 of flour, it'll keep it from getting chunky when it melts.  I'll try that next time.  But the flavor was really good - a lot like restaurant versions!

Good recipe basic recipe.. my husband liked it, but said for his taste he would like me to doctor it up next time... will add crumbled bacon or ham chunks.  

I also added the cheese at the very end of the cook time so it wouldn't get lumpy.. it came out very smooth and creamy.

I have made this soup many times and I always add wide egg noodles to this recipe.  It gives it a little more body and thickness.  Very tasty!

This was an amazing recipe that I will make over and over again. I couldn't get it to thicken as well as I liked, so I added some additional milk/flour mixture. It turned out perfect!

I made this soup today for an activity with our residents.  I put all the ingredients in a crock pot early in the morning and cooked it on high all day.  The only thing I did different was I put all the broccoli in a microwave bowl and cooked it for about 7 minutes to give it a head start.  I also had to decrease the chicken broth to 8 cups and the milk to 7 cups, mainly because the crock pot was full to the top.  EVERYONE loved this soup!  It was gone in about 1/2 hour.  This is definetly a make again for us!  Thanks....

Made 6 servings...
I didn't have chicken stock so I used chicken broth instead.  When heating the butter, I sauteed minced garlic and onion in it prior to adding the flour.  I also added twice the broccoli that the recipe called for and used 1 lb of Velveeta rather than 1/2 lb.  It was very flavorful but a little runnier than I anticipated.  Perhaps the stock would have made it thicker - I would definitely make this again.

We cooked this recipe this afternoon for lunch - scaling it down to six servings.  We used Velveeta for the processed cheese, fresh brocolli, and nothing special for the rest.

It was very easy to prep and cook this dish, but I have one suggestions though - based on our experience cooking it...  Next time I fix this I will add more brocolli, probably double what the recipe recommended.

The taste was great - a good mix of cheesiness, pepper, and other flavors.  Certainly the best brocooli and cheese soup any of us had tasted (six servings fed to five adults).

Definitely recommended!

Okay, This is the very first recipe I have tried on this site.  I loved it, my kids devoured it and my husband(who claims to not be a soup fan. . .ate two bowls).  I was surprised that it was so easy.  I made it the original way this time, but next time I would go for a low sodium stock to have more control over the salt in the dish.  Mine came out just a little salty for my taste. Thank you for sharing this recipe, it will live forever in my family.

Mmmm. This is a good soup!  I reduced the servings to 6 and added 2 1/2 cups of cooked rice to make it a little more filling.  I would definitely make it again.

I only made a couple changes. 1.) I didn't have white pepper so I used black. 2.) I used Swanson Chicken Broth for the chicken stock... here's the catch. Half of it was regular chicken broth and the other was the garlic Roasted Garlic chicken broth. I think that was my secret to such a wonderful bowl of soup! 3.) I didn't boil the broccoli sperately. After I put the broth in, I threw in the broccoli with it. It's a waste of a pot to boil it seperately and there is really no point. This was the best recipe I found for Broccoli Cheese Soup! Way to go!!

If you half this recipe, you will still need at least 5 cups of Broccoli, or it is just broth.  The soup taste's wonderful and creamy!  Will make again.

Very good soup!  I cut the recipe in half as suggested by others- increased the cheddar and decreased the Velveeta.  I love this recipe, simple and tasty!!!

Definitely a keeper!  We used half the velveeta, cornstarch instead of flour, and more broccoli.   All 4 of my kiddies loved it.

I used chicken broth instead of chicken stock because I didn't have any. The soup was very good but wasn't as thick as I like it.
