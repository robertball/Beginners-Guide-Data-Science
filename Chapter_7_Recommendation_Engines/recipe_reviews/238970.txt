I'd say this is more a 4.5 star. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I found the seasonings to be off.  I loved the addition of the chicken bouillon granules (I used Better Than Bouillon) instead of using salt.  This gives the potatoes a whole other level of flavor. And the truffle oil...well....that's the best part! YUM!  I used about half the amount of garlic powder and that was plenty for my taste, but I had a problem with a whole tbsp of black pepper. Yikes!  I ended up using 1 tsp instead of 1 Tbsp and that was more than enough.  These have a great texture and my guests were asking what I had put in my potatoes. I'll be making these again with the reduction in garlic powder and pepper.

These were fantastic. As other reviewers mentioned, 1 tablespoon of black pepper seemed like too much so I only added about a teaspoon.
