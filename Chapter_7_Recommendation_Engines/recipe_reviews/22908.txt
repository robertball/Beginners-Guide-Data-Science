Not wanting to have 6 pts. of pickles in the fridge(I can veggies to make Xmas baskets with), I boiled the tightly seals jars for 10 minutes, then removed them to cool on the counter. I then stored them in a cool dark place for the holidays. I just love the "pop" of the lids! Thanks for a great recipe!

With the overabundance of cucumbers from out garden I am searching for recipes to use them up! I found this recipe to be o.k.. It may have been that the pickling spices were weakened somewhat by the amount of cucumbers.I guesstimated that the recipe was using average size cucumbers. However, I think that I over eye-balled it as far as cucumbers. Probably on the onions too. I appreciated the recipe, however, personal tastes lead me to taking some of the pickle juice and a couple of cups of sugar and creating additional sweetness to add to the pickles. Also, I added a clove of fresh garlic and some red pepper flakes. I only gave thhis recipe 3 stars because the recipe needed to specify size, amount, etc. on the amount of cucumbers. I would like to have found an alternative way to combine the mixture for a crunchier pickle. I will probably try a  number of the other recipes on her also. Overall, this isn't too bad. Just not anything I would try again in a hurry. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was my first time making pickles and they came out SO good, definitely the kind I like, sweet but with a zing that hits you at the back of the throat.  I didn't have 10 pickling cucumbers, only about 6 so I cut back on the ingredients and only used about 4 cups of sugar.  I cut the pickling cucumbers lengthwise in to quarters before soaking them in the water.  When I drained the liquid I left the pickling spices mixed in with the cucumbers and onions.  Like another reviewer said, I put the pickles in to sterilized jars but then processed the jars for 10 minutes so I would be able to store them on my shelf.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!  Thanks!

A bit too spicy/strong-flavored for our tastes.  Liked the onions in it, though.  Recipe didn't specify regular or pickling cucumbers, I used regular.

Pretty good pickles, thanks!  I like the dill pickles recipe on here a bit better, but I'm a dill pickle obsessed person.  In general, though, I'm just obsessed with pickles, so there's little that can stop me from eating them!  These are a bit heavy on the onions, but when eating them pickled, I don't mind as much.  Nice flavor, a bit sweet but tangy too. I canned these in a water bath so I wouldn't have too many pickles in the fridge.   thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a good recipe for Pickled Cucumber and came a cross this one, All I can say is "Awesome" they have the sharpness I was looking for and more, being from the UK I really miss Pickled Onions etc, Still looking for pickling onions though.
The only thing I added was Ball Pickle Crisp Granules.
