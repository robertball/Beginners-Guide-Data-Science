Good recipe, next time I plan on going with a coconut flavor instead of vanilla.

I've taken to using this as my only ice cream recipe, the main ingredients stay the same but I change up the flavors. Cherry Cheesecake tonight, then Lemon Ricotta with candied lemon peel and dark Barista chocolate chips.

This recipe was perfect! Our daughter loves coffee ice cream and she fell in love with it instantly. We let the beans mixture soak overnight and had it for breakfast. Absolutely delicious!
