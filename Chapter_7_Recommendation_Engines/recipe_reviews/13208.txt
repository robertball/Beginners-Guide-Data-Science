This was an awesome recipe to start from.  I've made it 3 times now.  Here are the changes I made: added more beef and potatoes than the recipe asked for, and bell peppers and carrots for a more stew taste.  I coated the beef in flour before browning to thicken up the soup.  It was still pretty runny but the broth was so good, nobody was complaining.  If you want to make this more of a stew, you should probably use 4 cups of stock, not 6, and use cornstarch to thicken. UPDATE: I made the same soup today with chicken and chicken stock (instead of beef and beef stock) and substituted cooked rice for the potatoes.  I skipped the browning part and followed the rest of the ingredients and steps per recipe with my original modifications, adjusting the cooking time to the chicken breast (cut up). Excellent flavors!

This was absolutely out of this world! The flavor is so intense. She said the recipe is from South Africa but my husband was in the Navy and we were stationed in Japan and the Japanese also have alot of curry dishes like this. It was so good to taste that flavor again, it brings back good memories! Thanks!

I give this a three not because I liked it but, the wife seemed. 

So, what went right? I took some advice from others and cut the broth and added cornstarch. Got the perfect consistency for a great stew. The meal was easy to make and it smelled AWESOME while cooking it. 

However, once done, I put it over rice and must say, other than the first bite, this is probably the most bland thing I have ever eaten. I was so disappointed as I wanted a good easy curry dish. And the heat? Nothing there. Next time I'll add a few teaspoons of Cayenne. 

My recommendation is if you're going to try this, you have to add in a lot more spices. This was just too bland for me. The wife liked it, however, so, I'll give it three stars. 

I don't think I'll be making it again--it just took too long to make to risk having the same result again.

This really hit the spot!  Read other reviews, added an extra potato, 2 thin carrots and a small amount of cornstarch.  Made 8 cups of soup.  Simple and very tasty.

This was really good and fun to make for two novice chefs. We used chuck steak rather than stew-grade beef, and sweet potatoes rather than regular potatoes.  The sweet potatoes went really well with the curry, and I didn't find the meat to be too tough.  We'll definitely make this again!

Excellent soup that is very easy to make.  I suggest a tad bit more curry, and less onion, more like 1 and 1/2.

I made this last night and it turned out ok.  I don't feel like the curry flavor was strong enough.  I even only used 4 cups of beef stock and heaped the tablespoons of curry powder.  I called my mom, who makes amazing curry, for some tips and she said next time I should saute the curry powder first to release the spices...kind of like when you saute onions to give it a better flavor.  I will definitely try this recipe again with that modification.

I found this soup really simple to make, but the flavour was a little bland as i love curries, so added a little more curry powder, a little biriyani seasoning and some garlic powder which gave the soup more flavour. I added just one sliced carrot to give the soup more colour. My boyfriend loved it served with warm cobb bread and proper butter, he even has me making it again this weekend for our friends! Definitely one to be made again :-)

This was amazing, I adjusted the curry to my taste and added a bit more.  The aroma was tantalizing and I only got to have 2 bowls out of the batch as neighbors and friends all asked for more.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a nice, simple recipe for a novice cook (me).    It was a little too intense for me the first time I made it as a soup.  So the next couple of times  I only used 4 cups of beef stock, and added a little corn starch to thicken it up, and served it over rice.  I also skipped the potatoes.    It was yummy!!

I made the soup this morning to heat up later for dinner.  Just now tasted it.  Yum!  The curry isn't overpowering, but just adds a nice dimension of flavor.  I used sweet potatoes instead of white because I'm on this sweet potato kick.  Very good!  I'm probably going to add some frozen peas to it too tonight for dinner.  That's just me though.  I add peas to everything :)  Oh!  and I didn't have beef stock so I subbed that for 1/2 water 1/2 beer combo.  I don't feel like that caused the broth to lack any flavor.  Just ask my hubby, beef and beer go hand in hand :)

Fabulous!!  The recipe title states "SOUP" - it is not meant to be thick like stew - that is why it is SOUP.  I used left over roast beef cut into cubes and omitted the vinegar.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it was soooooooo good!!  JUST the right amount of spice.  I did not find it bland in the least, but the left roast was a heavily seasoned roast and maybe that had something to do with it?  My family didn't like it, but they don't like curry.  I love curry and I am LOVING this perfect soup!

My husband and I love spicy and are always trying new foods.  This soup was absolutely the BEST soup I have had.  I did tweak it a little bit because we like our food SPICY I added additional hot curry and I added Indian chili pepper.  It was so good my husband thought I bought it and brought it home.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will check out your others.  You should have this in a cooking contest.

I shook up the beef cubes in flour, then browned with onions. Then added 3 cans beef broth, >2Tb curry, 2 bay leaves & simmered on low ~ 30 minutes covered. Then added 1/4 tsp. cayenne, 1.5 tsp salt, 2 Tb white vinegar, 1 ea: large red & green bell pepper, 2 sweet potatoes and a healthy handful of sliced baby carrots. Simmered again covered about an hour. Quite tasty, and my husband is not generally a huge fan of curry, but he liked this dish! The beef came out unusually tender and delicious. The cayenne gave it a tiny bit of a kick. The flavor was very full, especially as leftovers the next day; I think the extra veggies and spice helped keep it from being bland as other reviewers suggested. Thank you for the recommendation to use sweet potatoes, they really complemented the curry!!

Easey, tasty, excellent. May want to make beef pieces smaller so they remain tender though. Other wise VERY good and perfect for a cold winter day.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and I coated the beef in flour before browning.  I also added carrots to the pot.  Lastly, I added cornstarch to help thicken up the liquid.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This turned out great although I did alter a couple things. I always substitute beef with elk meat and you either cook elk for mere minutes or all day long for it to be good. So I threw everything but the potatoes in a crock pot on low all day and it was fantastic. I added 4 smallish potatoes and a handful of carrots about 2 hours before dinner time then thickened it with corn starch right before serving. I served this with JP's Big Daddy Biscuits (from this site) and we had a wonderful meal!

This was a good recipe but I made a few changes. Half an onion less and half a potato more, added a carrot, halved the salt, and thickened it at the end with tapioca flour. Made a pretty good meal with some bread.

This soup was quite good. Actually very flavourful - despite a few reviews that said it was bland. The only changes I made were to add 2 small carrots, diced and one sweet potato, diced. The sweet potato added a nice flavour to the soup. Next time, I may add a small amount of cornstarch to thicken it slightly, but I didn't feel it was too watery.

Everyone in my family loved it.  My son took it to school for a project on African foods, and the container came back empty!  One of my children that doesn't eat potatoes, even ate them in this dish.  I do mine in the crock pot.

This was not impressive.  For a recipe rated a 5 I was very disappointed.

I've made this recipe multiple times with brillant success.  A great base soup that with a little creativity you can add all sorts of different vegetables.  I've amazed friends who come into my house when this is cooking and they usually try to stay for dinner.
This is also one of the easiest recipes I've seen in awhile.

This recipe was great. I did put only 3 cups beef broth and added more curry powder. It tasted very delicious. I made it into a stew instead. Thank you!

I tried to make this more into a stew like.  The taste was very good.  I will make it again.  I decreased the beef stock by 2 cups and added baby carrots.

The taste was amazing with some adjusments. I used one onion instead of two with 5 or 6 heaping tablespoons of curry powder and a half cup of coconut milk. Also used mini potatoes cut in halves. The beef came out chewy, I must have browned it too much. Next time would use cornstarch like other commentors said to thicken the sauce. Would also serve with roti.

Amazing flavor! The aroma of curry filled the house.I read some of the reviews before I made this recipe. I made a few changes as suggested by some of the reviewers. I floured the meat before I sautéed it with the onions;  added 2 extra potatoes, sliced carrots (3), and a red bell pepper diced. The broth came out thicker than a soup, but not as thick as a stew. Great recipe- I will definitely make it again!

No I didn't make any changes but my ex husband says when we make it again we will double everything in the recipe. It was really good and I will make it again.

This is not a fair review of this recipe, however I was looking for a base to make a chickpea soup (not vegetarian, just for health reasons) and I decided on this.  I reduced the margarine just to a tsp or a little less.  I also changed the sweet potatoes to sweet potatoes and added carrot (not in the recipe but in the pic) and spinach.  Oh it is so good.  Thanks for the idea.  I will be trying the meat version of this for supper some evening soon!!!!

I made this last night and wow!!!!  Is it ever great!!!!  I was a little nervous because of the amount of curry that it called for (I'm not a fan of strong curries) but I followed the recipe exactly and the results were fantastic.  I will be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is good and the kids like it. The beef broth was a bit too much so it became more of a stew. If you like curry based sauce, thicken it up with cornstarch or add less broth. For me, I added carrots and puree them with the potatoes to thicken it up a bit. That also makes the kids eat the "hidden" vegetables. Will make it again but this time probably spice it up with chillie flakes.

Very delicious.  We've also tried it with chicken instead of the beef and liked it just as well.

This was my first attempt with curry and beef and I did not like the result at all.  I think I will stick with curry in chicken and in rice-vegetable salads.  Thanks for the recipe anyway.  It may be that it just doesn't suit my tastes.
