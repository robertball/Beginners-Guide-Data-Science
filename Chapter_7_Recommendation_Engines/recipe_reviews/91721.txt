Delicious. I ate some last night after dinner, before bed, and this morning. Now I can't wait to get home from work so I can eat more. I don't really even like maraschino cherries that much but this ice cream just tastes so good. I should have used more chocolate!

This is my first attempt at homemade ice cream.  We tasted it after the stir/freeze step and it is very creamy and wonderful!  This is my favorite store version, but the homemade far exceeds it!

When I got my ice-cream maker I was only going to use "custard" recipes...NO sweetened condensed recipes for me...NO SIR!  BUT....
YUMMERS!  I used my Cuisinart 2 QT. ice-cream maker...it was to much mix for it but I went ahead anyway (cleaning up the mess is fun anyway) and it churned up beautifully.  GREAT taste/texture...the ONLY thing I may do diffently is add a "bit" more chopped cherries. (personal taste and all that).  5 BIG stars for this one.  GREAT recipe and I will make it again. THANKS for posting!
