Excellent! I scaled this down to 2 servings for just my husband and me. We decided that rather than go out to dinner, we'd splurge on something a little extra special, and cook at home. We went to our local butcher shop and purchased the Porterhouse steak, which he cut fresh from a new loin for us. I grilled this in our countertop induction oven on the medium grill setting, but next time I will grill it on medium-high or high to get a better sear on the steak. Because I had just washed the herbs fresh from my garden, I did not add the water to the chimichurri sauce. This sauce is wonderful . . . and I can't wait to use the left overs on other meats, or even fish. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner in! Thanks for sharing the recipe!
