Oh my! This is so good! I saw that Pioneer Woman used frozen peaches in this type of recipe, so I thought I would try it too.  It turned out great! So easy, and no one would guess it's just crescent rolls! Delicious and decadent topped with vanilla ice cream.

It was great!  Will try it next time with apples.  I didn't add the Mountain Dew thanks to another reviewer and liked it without.

The IDEA of this recipe is great! Simple and yummy. However, it was WAY too sweet and produced far too much goo. I would suggest half the butter and sugar. Second, I'm not sure about the purpose of the soda. Perhaps to keep from getting dried out in baking? Anyway, it just kept the bottom of the rolls from browning and they were gooey, thus making everyone think they were not fully baked. My husband (who LOVES SWEETS) said they were just way too sweet. With modifications, they are delicious and easy.
