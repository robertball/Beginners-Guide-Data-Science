Awesome flavors! I modified it a bit in the interest of time by using a store-bought rotisserie chicken and my electric pressure cooker. I only used one bag of pre-washed spinach and used 5 tsp of a garlic ginger paste that I keep in the fridge. I chopped the chicken and ended up with about 2 cups, which I added to the sauce and cooked on low pressure for 5 min. The chicken fell apart and blended well.  After adding the spinach, I cooked it on low pressure for 8 min. Lastly, I only used 1/8 tsp of cayenne since I was feeding toddlers. Really, really good over basmati rice. Thank you!

This is an incredible recipe that takes time and effort. It is worth every minute it takes. The 2nd time I made it, I subbed rinsed canned garbanzos and a cube of bullion instead of chicken. Still great. This will be a recipe I keep always.

This is a great recipe but use rounded spoons on ALL of the spices you'll be happy you did, it needs a little more spice. I have made this several times and it is perfection with rounded spoonfuls.  I also use use just over 2 lbs of spinach and put it in the food processor.  I have got nothing but amazing comments on this.  People beg me to make it again.

Substituted the sour cream for greek yogurt and the milk with coconut milk.  Added 1 T fenugreek leaves 1t cumin 1/2 t black pepper increased garam masala to 1 T (my own blend of garam masala which can be found on food network) 3/4 t cayenne. Used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of whole chicken. Used 2 black cardomom pods 2 green and 2 whole cloves.  Turned out better than my favorite indian resteraunt.

Wow! Thank you so much for posting this! We are only able to have authentic Indian food when we travel out of a major airport two hours from home. This is a wonderful, scrumptious copy of the chicken saag I had the last time we traveled. I made it exactly as written, and it tastes almost exactly like that which I had in the Indian restaurant, without the high price tag or two hour commute. I served it over brown rice I'd sprinkled with cilantro, and it was soooooo delicious!!!!!

I liked this, but I had to doctor it to make it more like what it's like in Indian restaurants.  I had read reviews saying that it was a bit bland, which was hard to imagine, given all the spices the recipe calls for!  Nevertheless, it was a bit bland.  It was also very dry--not creamy like it is in restaurants.  Therefore, I recommend that you double the milk and (at least) triple the amount of butter called for.  I would also at a TBS of the Garam Masala (not a tsp.) and a TBS of salt (not a tsp.).  You may need to add even more salt to taste.

This was great and was even better without chicken. I added some curry to it and used 1/4 tsp ground cloves rather than whole. I served it over basmati rice. Will definitely make again! Thanks!

This was outstanding! I was so impressed with how good this turned out. Love ordering chicken saag at Indian restaurants and am so happy to find a great way to make it at home. I was generous with the seasoning and used ground ginger instead of fresh because that's what I had. Delicious!

This is amazing, if not exactly what you may get in an Indian restaurant (it is better!). I halved the recipe, using 16 oz. bin of organic spinach from Costco, and chopped finely (versus using the blender after cooking).  Used the Garam Masala recipe from this site, and used boneless chicken breasts.  Served with basmati rice, I got 5 servings from half the recipe.  It took nearly 2 hours, but I'll gladly make it again!

This was decent, I felt like it could use some changes but I am not sure what exactly.  I didn't have any rice to put with it, so perhaps that would have made it feel more complete if I had that.  My husband liked this a bit more than I did.  I will make this again sometime.

I found this recipe by accident while searching for ideas based on ingredients I had on hand.  It did take longer to throw together than anticipated but it was so worth it!  I used cubed stir fry chicken and fresh spinach leaves.  I assembled the garam masala from another recipe on this site.  I didn't have cardamom but didn't miss it.  I did ask my husband to grab basmati rice on the way home because it really does tie the dish together.  The only thing I will do differently next time is add the seasoning to the chicken earlier.  This dish had a lot of flavor but in the middle of it all was some bland chicken.  Try it!  You'll love it!

This is one of my favourite Indian dishes and this recipe really makes it less daunting (also it took me about an hour including prep so don't be worried about the estimated time). I changed it quite a bit though. I halved the recipe, but kept the same amount of spices. I also uses two fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Next time the only things I would change is draining the spinach before adding it and adding a little less butter at the end. My SO loved it. We jumped on it so quickly we forgot to take a photo.

Great recipe!  I didn't have sour cream, so I subbed in yogurt, and I replaced the turmeric and cardamom I didn't have with curry powder.  Tastes just like the chicken saag at my favorite Indian restaurant!

I've made this a few times, and it is really delicious.  I've played around with the ratios, and I've taken to adding more onion and Cayenne pepper.  It adds a really nice back of the tongue heat but doesn't over power the other flavors.

Thanks for the recipe!

I made it according to the recipe from the magazine, including boneless chicken thighs. It was delicious. My hubby LOVED it, and even our au pair, who had never had Indian food before, had two helpings! I used ground spices for the ginger, cardamon, and cloves, but again, this worked well. Definitely adding this one to the meal planning rotation!!

Crazy good!!  I followed the instructions with the exception of using boneless thighs and I halved the cayenne-(we didn't want it too spicy) and I also took stacey06's advice and used rounded spoonfuls for the rest of spices.  It was amazing! BEST saag I've ever had, the spices were perfect!  I will use this recipe for years to come! Thank you so  much ortizjoseph for sharing this recipe!!

This really came out delicious. Followed the recipe pretty closely and it came out great. We did follow the recommendation other reviewers left to use slightly "heaped" measurements. It came out pretty spicy, which we enjoy. I don't think it would have been bland at all if we followed the measurements exactly, so maybe those who thought it was bland were skipping some of the spices altogether or their spices were very old and tasteless?

We used a heavy bottomed stainless pan (aka NOT nonstick). The chicken we cooked first left a great fond (the sticky bits), which we deglazed with a light splash of cognac-- not enough to leave any taste, just to get the bits off the pan and incorporated with the onions. I think that added wonderful flavor. 

We were a little worried how "green" it would come out before we added the spinach because the mixture looks very yellow/orange/red from the tomatoes and turmeric. However, it definitely turned VERY green as soon as we added the spinach. Duh!

Lastly, it took us longer than the time suggested. Lots of prep, shopping, etc. However, this was better than most restaurant Indian food I've had in the last few months and was totally worth it!

This is definitely a keeper!  I have used ground cumin instead of cloves and cardamom. I don't have garam masala and sour cream so I have substitute them with allspice and whipping cream. The result was amazing. I do suggest to minced the garlic, onion ang ginger a day before to reduce the preparation time. This is because it takes a lot of time to cook this.

The saag part turned out perfectly but the chicken was a little dry. I think you should just sear the chicken pieces before adding the tomato/onion spice mixture (which I also pureed, to get a consistency closer to what I've had at restaurants). Also 1/4 cup water for the spinach (I just used a whole bag) wasn't enough to get them properly steamed, more like 1 cup. A package of thawed frozen spinach would also work I think if you're pressed for time. Next time I will also throw in a couple whole dried chiles.

Also nonfat plain Greek yogurt works well in place of sour cream :)

Our family really enjoyed this recipe. Because we're vegetarian and eat very little dairy, I modified it by adding chick peas instead of chicken, using coconut milk in place of cow's milk and omitting the sour cream. I also used a freshly diced chile in place of the cayenne because I learned to make all Indian dishes with fresh, whole spices. While the flavor was great, I wasn't thrilled with the consistency and next time will either grate the onion or will remove the whole spices at the end and give the saag a few pulses with my handheld immersion blender before serving. Also, by adding a handful of freshly chopped cilantro before serving, the flavors seem brighter. Our favorite Indian restaurant uses a similar saag recipe with lots of coriander for flavor and no cumin.

loved it! so deeeelisssh. I didn't have 3 pounds of chicken so I added a can of garbanzo beans from the pantry and it turned out great. I served the chicken saag with naan topped with garlic and olive oil. I didnt have cayenne pepper so I added red pepper flakes. I also didn't have sour cream so I used Chobani plain yogurt instead. I will recommend this recipe its so yummy.

This recipe was not to bad.  I think next time I will leave out the cloves as I did not like how they over powered the rest of the recipe.  It wasn't quite like the Saag I have had at my favorite Indian Restaurant but not the worst I have had either.

On par with several local restaurants, I recommend using a tiny pinch of ground cloves in place of the 2 whole cloves, as they disappear into the dish and can be quite unsavory when you find them in your mouth. Similar situation with the cardamom pods.
To replicate the rice made by most indian restaurants, use 2 cups basmati rice with 1/2 tsp of whole cumin seeds and 1 tsp of salt and a dash of onion powder. With a pad of butter toast the rice, cumin, salt, and onion powder until some of the rice is a light golden color, add 4 cups water, bring to boil, reduce to a very light simmer until done (15 minutes).
Also goes great with homemade naan bread.

Following several reviewers advice I increased the spices, except garlic.  Left out the cayenne but used a very spicy Garam Masala.  Doubled the salt, but that was to much.

 it was very good.  Worth giving another try.

I love this recipe! So tasty and easy to make. I did skip the cayenne since I don't do spicy, and I used non dairy sour cream, but still came out great!

Good high quality recipe. For a fairly healthy dish, this is good stuff.

I used canned chicken instead of fresh--I'm a college student and it's a lot more cost effective. I also excluded the tomato because my husband can't eat it. Everything else was as specified. It turned out really well! Will definitely make it again.

I took the advice of others and basically doubled all of the spices (except the red pepper) and it was outstanding. I’ll definitely make it again.

Extremely tasty, restaurant quality spinach and chicken.
I used boneless breasts but the key is the spices and spinach.
 delicious!

This was very good, with authentic Indian flavors.  I couldn't find cardamon pods so I used ground cardamon instead, and I used a rotisserie chicken so it all came together very quickly and easily.  I found that it needed a lot more salt; like twice as much.  I completely forgot about the sour cream and the butter and it was still delicious (and healthier, too, as a result).

Yummy.  I used chilli powder instead of cayenne pepper and 2 pkts of frozen spinach thawed.  This will be a regular recipe for me.

I didn't have enough chicken to make 6 servings, and I realized too late that I didn't have cardamom, so I had to try and get the ingredients down in proportion to the amount of chicken I had. I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts, which sped up the cooking process because they cooked faster and were already tender. There was a bit of a disaster involving a blender full of hot spinach, so I would do that part differently. Regardless, the end result was delicious. My husband said it was one of his favorite meals, "up there with pizza," which, if you knew my husband, would know is about the highest accolade you can get.

I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken and cut the recipe down by 1/4 since I was making it for two people. This was still enough for large servings and leftovers. It was delicious. I'll be making this again!

First of all, I made the recipe from the magazine and the picture was of a delectable golden brown, savory, gravy laden dish.  The ingredients sounded like they would be a robust, mouthful of rich Indian inspired flavors.  Well, NO.  I don't know what recipe the picture was showing, but it certainly didn't include pureeing 1 pound of spinach!!  The final product was brilliant green!  While the meal was edible, it sure didn't taste like anything, especially anything Indian.  I was very disappointed.  1 TEASPOON of Garam Masala?  I'll not make this again.

This is a spice level 1 just for those of you who are wondering (which is the lowest either on 1_10 or some places have out of 5 either way). It was the perfect spiciness for me. I served it with basmati rice (white rice) and naan bread (which I bought at the grocery store). Overall very good, a little bit slimier than I think I like but that might be fixed if I use frozen spinach instead.

Amazing!  I made a few small changes simply because I did not have the items in the house.  I used crushed red pepper flakes instead of cayenne.  I did add a bit of curry and rounded measurements of the spices because we love spicy food.  I also used frozen spinach.  I followed the directions until all of the ingredients were combined and then put into the slow cooker for four hours.  I also omitted the sour cream because I was out.

This is a great and easy recipe for such a complicated dish. Flavors are on point- but I agree with other reviews that you need to double or triple the spices, it needs it.

I did not care for this recipe. I cook a lot. The final product had no flavor. Even after tripling the spice ratios of everything, it still just tasted hot spicy without any layers of anything. There was WAY too much spinach, I thought when I was making it that it seemed wrong to possibly use that much spinach, and in the end this was definitely true. If it tasted good I could have gotten over the unappetizing look of it, but it didn't. Absolutely nothing like the dish you actually get at an Indian restaurant.

We really enjoyed this recipe too, however I feel that the ginger and garlic could be blended or pressed instead of minced.  We also like our indian food really spicy, so I used at least triple the amount of cayenne pepper to add more heat to the dish.  Otherwise, we had plenty of leftovers for a few nights between my husband and I.  Will definitely make again.

This is a really good recipe -- very authentic tasting.  I substituted cubed boneless chicken breasts for the cut up chicken and probably cut the cooking time by at least 30 minutes.

I love Indian food, but so much of the recipes call for ghee or other items that I just don't have on hand.  This recipe was easy to follow, and easy to modify if needed.  I cut the recipe in half, used diced fire roasted tomatoes, cut up chicken tenderloins,left out the clove because my garam masala has plenty of that flavor already;  you do need to adjust spices to taste, I used the full serving amounts, plus adjustments.  Ate a serving before realizing I had forgotten the greek yogurt and butter - it was great flavor, but didn't have the restaurant creaminess; with the yogurt it was perfect, the chicken was tender and spinach flavorful.  Agree that spinach was not fully wilted with 1/4 cup, but didn't affect recipe outcome.  Really recommend this one, plan to do it again with chickpeas.....

This is a good "base recipe". Don't be afraid to add a bit more cayenne pepper if you like spicier foods.     "I have never met a calorie   I didn't like"  -Unknown
