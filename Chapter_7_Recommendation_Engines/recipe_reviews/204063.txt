Even though I doubled the cocoa and the sugar the tofu taste was still noticeable.  Also, it didn't set up well.  I'm going to try the recipe for Hasty Chocolate Pudding from this site and substitute the milk with soy.

This was DELICIOUS! I used 14oz silken tofu, well drained, and 1/2 cup splenda instead of sugar.  On my first attempt making this I found that the powered soy milk gave the pudding a gritty look and texture, so the second time around I mixed the soy powder with the vanilla and added a tiny bit of almond milk and wisked to make a soy-vanilla paste, scraped every bit into the food processor and the pudding came out silky smooth!

Wow!!! This was great recipe everyone in my family loved it! I thought it tasted a little too much like tofu so I added a cup of semi sweet mini chocolate chips and that did it. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I doubled the sugar and the creamer (the texture looked gritty without it) but it still tasted like tofu. My toddler ate it but my husband and I passed.
