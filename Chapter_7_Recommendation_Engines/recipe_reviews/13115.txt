I was weary to try this recipe after reading the other review. However, I had all the ingredients on hand, so I gave it a go. I did make a few modificatons though. I used a little extra chicken bouillon, and added ground pepper to the simming veggies as well as using the pepper in the milk/flour mixture. My soup was very creamy, and full of flavor. Nice recipe, thanks AUNTYLENE.

This was SO disappointing.  The ingredients sounded like they would blend to a smooth, mild, tasty soup.  Instead it tasted like vegetables in warm milk.  I gave it two stars because I was able to add some things to it (a dash of worcestershire sauce, some onion powder, garlic powder, more bullion, and a LOT more salt) to make it bearable.  However we spent the entire meal trying to figure out what would make it better.  We'd have an idea, then dismiss it.  We finally decided that perhaps some cheese would make it better, though we don't have any in the house.  When I finally succumb to starvation and have to eat some more, I'm going to try adding curry powder and see how that goes.

This is the recipe that tastes so much like mom used to make. My favorite comfort food.

I have to agree with the first review . . . this just tasted like vegetables in milk.  I had to throw it all out. It was a waste of time and money--and trust me, it took a LOT of prep time to make this.  The only way I think this might taste okay is if you add velveeta to it, which I did not do.

My solution to bringing out the flavor in this soup is simple... mirepoix the vegetables, rather than dumping raw veggies in the water/broth. I used 4 cups chicken broth, instead of bouillon, and with 2 tsp salt, we found it a little too salty.

I halved the ingredients in this recipe simply because I live in a small apartment and it's just my husband and I. I did double up on the bullion like another review said otherwise I believe it would've came out weak in flavor. I also skipped the celery(didn't have on hand and not a big fan either) and used about 3/4 cup of corn instead. Replaced 1 cup water(1/2 cup for me) with chicken broth.  Then add some frozen mussel meat (didn't have chopped clams). Perfect!
