A hit at my house.  We had pre-sliced the beef, and it was extremely flavorful with this marinade.  It would be good with chicken as well.  Everyone assembles their own fajita, as our family has wildly differing tastes.  We serve with traditional fajita vegetables and toppings, plus fresh tomato and shredded lettuce. We have both hot and mild salsa.  Everyone is happy, and all request this marinade again!

Marinated turkey tenderloins in this for 24 hours and grilled....delicious! I only used 1/2c. pineapple juice, 1/4c. soy and added 1/4c. olive oil with the lime juice, cumin and fresh garlic. Very good...will make again. Thanks!

Simple and good.  I used lemon juice instead of lime.

This marinade needs to marinate for at least 2 days to really get some flavor.  I doubled the recipe and added fajita veggies to it.  It was pretty good.  Next time I will marinate for 3 days.

This was very good, but not what I was expecting. I'll use it again, but I'm not sure if I'll use it as a fajita marinade again.

I just made this for a family get together and it was very tasty! I poured the juice right from the bowl of a pineapple I cut up yesterday and only got 1/2 cup out of it so I used some extra lime juice and it was still delicious. Next time I will defintely marinate for the full four hours (only did for one today as I was running late). Oh and I also added 1 tsp of coriander just for fun. Thanks for the idea!

Not what I was looking for.  Had a slightly sour taste to it.

Papa says it's great just as it is and gives it 5 stars.  Mama says, "eegads! this is SALTY" and gives it one star.  There was thumb wrestling and they negotiated to meet in the middle at 2 1/2...that's not an option, so went for 3
