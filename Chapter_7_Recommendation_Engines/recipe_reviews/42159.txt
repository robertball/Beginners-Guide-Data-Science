I use this recipe all the time when I cook salmon. I got it out of my Quick Cooking Magazine from Taste of Home.
The trick is to use less Dill Weed and less Brown Sugar. I add approx. 1 tsp.dill, and 1 cup brown sugar. Then adjust to taste. I cook mine in the oven, and baste with sauce. My family loves it!

Fantastic Salmon glaze!  I left out the dill and added 1 tsp ground ginger.  I only used half the cayenne pepper, and it was perfect.  My 5 year old had 3 helpings.  It looked elegant.  I'll serve this for company.

This recipe was great!!!  I baked it in the oven for 15 minutes at 400, and used a lemon/dill seasoning mix to lighten the dill flavor.  Also, I cut back to 1/2 cup sugar, but doubled the cayenne.  Super easy and great presentation!! Will definately make again!

Really quite good.  I used 3/4 of a cup sugar, and 1 tsp of dill. I also baked in the oven at 375º for 10 minutes per side and it turned out great.  Will make again.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I did use garlic pepper instead of lemon pepper on the salmon however but I really don't think it makes much of a difference. Super yummy!!

Excellent ! Have made this many times. Sweet with just enough heat. Makes alot of sauce for 1 pound of fish, I make half the amount of sauce.  Served with rice and broccoli, a wonderful meal.

I thought the dill did not blend well with the sweet and sour.  It had a funny aftertaste.  Either taste alone would have been fine, but together they didn't combine well.

This was my first successful salmon recipe! The grilling without turning was key. I've since used this method with a basalmic glaze and the salmon always turns out perfectly moist and delicious.

This is incredible!!! I baked the salmon at 350 degrees for 30 minutes; served it with Barley Bake from this site. Great combination!

I didn't care very much for this recipe.  Brown sugar and dill sounded like a weird combination, and it tasted like a weird combination!  Even though I modified the amount of sugar and dill as other raters did, it still didn't taste right.

Very tasty!  It's a little heavy (all the butter, and brown sugar) but gives salmon a great flavor.

Surprisingly good! I tasted the glaze before I poured it on the salmon and it tasted weird. Luckily I didn't throw it out. I used olive oil instead of butter, crushed red pepper instead of cayenne pepper, added some garlic and white wine to the glaze, and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Absolutely delicious! I loved the sweet and spicy tang and the dill was great. I would make this again.

Wonderful flavor.  If you make the glaze ahead of time and let it cool before brushing it on the fish it sticks better and doesn't make your grill flare up so much.  This is also delicious on grilled shrimp.  Thanks for a winning recipe!

This recipe was super simple and completely tasty!  I used less brown sugar and more cayenne pepper for more of a punch and my husband and I loved it.  I baked in the oven instead of grill for ease and it came out perfect and juicy.  Everyone should try this easy, tasty recipe!

Very good.I did however follow the advice of the other reviews and decreased the brown sugar to 1 cup.  I'm glad I did because it was sweet with that amount.  Overall I will make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Way too sweet.  Has possibilities but needs a lot more tanginess and less sugar.  Would not make again.  Kids tried one bite and would not eat any more due to the sweetness of the fish.  Sorry

It was really good. I did wait a little bit after simmering it, the sauce thickened and it was nice. Separated some and poured it over steamed rice, yum??

Although I cut the brown sugar in half, this was more sweet than I or my family like. I tried adding some chinese vinegar with little improvement. I probably won't make this again

This recipe was perfect.  I even had some left over and spread it on skewered shrimp, for a wonderful addition to the meal.  I’ve been looking for this collection of flavors for years.

Too sweet for us... If I were to make this again, I would cut way back on the sugar, and add some red pepper flakes or ginger.

Husband did not like this because he thought the dill was too strong.

This was good but not fabulous.  It also seriously crisped up on the gas grill set on high so I kept turning the heat down then up then down again (I wasn't sure how long it would take to cook if I didn't keep it somewhat high).  The skin kind of charred as did the edges as soon as the flames met the sweet glaze although that made it pretty easy to remove the skin as we ate it.  My husband really liked it.  I might make it again, but I'm not sure.
