I've made literally dozens and dozens of like but not the same popover recipes.  I left the salt out (restrictions), used Pam butter spray to "grease" the large muffin sized pan,  but it made no difference, these are by far the easiest and best turned out popovers I have ever made.  One must follow the directions exactly and the oven must be properly preheated, but if one does follow exactly, this is a no fail, excellent recipe for popovers without needed speciality pans, butter, extra calories, ect.  Excellent.

Excellent recipe.  I tested some variations with 3 of the 6 popover cups.  For 3 I preheated the custard cups with a small dab of butter in each.  Those 3 rose higher and came out of the cups more easily than the 3 that were not preheated and did not have the dab of butter in the bottom (before adding the batter).  Also, to prevent the likelihood of getting too dark, I reduced the temp to 350 after 15 minutes and then reduced the 350 bake time to 15 minutes.

We enjoyed popovers the other night so I thought I'd try this recipe and (with my fingers crossed) hoped that they'd turn out just as good. Well, they did! I did take another's advice who stated that they added 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter. Also, after I reduced the heat to 350 degrees, I only had to bake for 10 min (thus, total baking time was 30 min).  Had I baked any longer, these goodies would have been burnt. Although they taste just as good as "Cold Oven Popoevrs" (also found on this site), I like that recipe a little better b/c you aren't messing with the oven temp. Still, excellent recipe with excellent results!! One last thing, I made "Cinnamon Honey Butter" (again, from this site) and spread it inside the warm popovers...yup! I'm in heaven!! Thanks Christy!

This is a really good popover recipe, the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the directions. Popovers "pop" better when a) the milk and eggs are room temperature before mixing and b) the pan is preheated. If you follow those two easy steps along with this recipe you'll have perfect popovers every time. I've made this recipe several times and will continue to do so!

I have been making popovers now for over 20 years. I thought that I might have a lead hand.  When they popped they did not taste very good and when they did not pop so much, the flavor was good.  This recipe is my very first success. I used popover pans that are non-stick and I never thought to butter the outside top of the pans but next time I will because that is how huge they ended up being.  I cannot thank you enough.  I also reduced the cooking time and put a dot of butter in the bottom of each tin.  Wonderful

Ok, I don't want to rate this yet becuase evidently it is me that is the problem, not the recipe. I tried making these twice..folling the directions exactly and being careful not to over mix. The second time I tried baking at 450 for 15 min and then 350 for 15 min...each time the same thing happens. They fall in the middle and they are heavy like a paperweight. 

Someone please let me know what I am doing wrong.

These Popovers come out crusty on the outside, and soft in the center, almost like churos! I add 1/2t. vanilla to the batter. For serving, I have a bowl of cinnamon and sugar to sprinkle on them (once they've been torn open). My husband loves them, so I make them as a weekend breakfast treat.

These came out wonderfully.  Have made a few times - following recipe exactly as well as adding vanilla and/or spices depending on what we are making them for. Followed other reviewers suggestions and baked at 450 for 15 minutes and then reduced to 350 for 15 minutes.  For those that had problems - a few tips:  milk and eggs must be at room temperature - leave out for 30+ minutes at least.  Batter will be thin and its okay to have small lumps.  Do not open oven door while baking - use oven light if you want to look at them baking.

Okay... ...I'm just starting in the kitchen, and these where by far the show stopper of the evening! I've made them with great care and on the fly and just can't seem to mess them up.  I do have a tip however: when right out of the oven poke the tops with a fork to let extra steam escape. If you don't they will deflate.  By doing this you can throw any extra in the freezer for a later a quick zap in the microwave and perfect accompaniment to a cup of soup.

This is the same popover recipe my mom always made when I was a kid, I never thought I'd ever be able to find it again! I used a muffin pan to make them, which was how my mom made them. Using the muffin pan makes them smaller so they cook a lot faster I cooked mine at 450 for fifteen minutes and at 350 for ten. They came out great, very good recipe!

These are great for breakfast.  We will eat them hot out of the oven with just a little butter.  I liked other reviewer's suggestions of cinnamon sugar and will have to try that next time I make.

I tried this recipe and another recipe - the other recipe called for 3 eggs - we liked them much better with 2 eggs. I made these in a muffin pan - Turned out fine. Cooked at 450 for 20 minutes - turned it down to 350 and could smell when it was done - I did not pay attention to time - It turned out a bit dark on the outside, But they were good I made these again and baked them for 10 minutes at 450 - then 350 till I could smell them and they looked done - Believe me you can smell when they are done - They turned out GREAT !!!! DON'T over mix them, the batter will be lumpy. Thanks for the recipe. Delicious !!!!

This is an excellent recipe for popovers, however I found that the oven temp was too high and too long. I recommend baking at 425 for 15 minutes, then reducing to 350 for 15 minutes more. These did raise sky high and they were light and airy, but they would have burned to a crisp had I not checked on them and turned the temp down. I sprinkled with powdered sugar and jelly and served for breakfast.

This is the classic recipe.  Popovers should be made with ROOM TEMPERATURE milk and eggs.  Then let the batter rest for 45 min to an hour before baking.  Make sure your popover pan was heated in the oven (add little bit of butter to each cup).  I have been making popovers for years... every now and then they just don't work...maybe I did something a little wrong in haste.

WARNING: Don't use custard cups! I greased and floured the cups very well and the popovers still stuck horribly. The next time I used a standard sized muffin pan (greased & floured) and the popovers came right out. No sticking and no flopping. I doubled the recipe for the muffin pan (you could do 1 full recipe and a half instead though, they'll get pretty big) and divided it all equally between the cups. They took less time on the second baking step (at 350 degrees), about 15 minutes. Otherwise, nothing else was different. I let them go for the full 20 minutes at 450 degrees. I whisked the batter just until it all came together. There were still little lumps in the batter but it was almost smooth (this keeps them tender). The popovers came out light, airy, tender and fantastic. Will make again.

I have tried all the celebrity chef popover recipes, followed them to the letter, and NONE has been this good!  This one is the keeper!  These popovers were so light and fluffy, I thought they were going to pop right out of the pan!  I did use a popover pan, greased the cups with lots of butter, and reduced the 350 degree time to 10 minutes and they were perfect!  These are the only changes I would make to this recipe: Lots of butter in each cup and 20 min at 450 followed by only 10 minutes at 350!  Thank you Christy!

I was so impressed with this one! first time eating and making a popover, I was a bit doubtful of how they would come out. They looked and tasted like something from a french bakery! I have to say though, I added chopped bacon and cheddar to the batter which gave them incredible flavor and texture. I did have to lower the temperature to 350 after 20 minutes and only left them in another 15 minutes after that. They browned quite beautifully. I am anxious to try other add ins such as pear, cheddar, and rosemary, or apple and cheddar! ooh...the possibilities!

I love popovers... so simple and inexpensive, yet they are a showstopper at dinner!  I always put a small pad of butter (about 1/4 teaspoon) in the bottom of my popover pan, and put the pan in the oven for a minute or two BEFORE pouring in the batter.  When the pan is hot and the butter melted, then I quickly pour in the batter and put it in the oven for the recommended time.  I find the butter gives the crust a better texture, it prevents sticking (which allows the batter to rise VERY high for super big popovers) and it adds a little more taste to an otherwise bland bread-product.  I sometimes add a bit of herbs to the batter to keep things interesting!

This was my first time making popovers.  I used a special popover pan, buttered them, preheated as directed, put a dab of butter in the bottom of each and also sprayed with Pam before filling half-way.  I liked the idea of adding some vanilla as others suggested so I did.  I watched them like a hawk and had to lower them a little sooner to 350 and not keep them in quite as long.  They were perfect!

Fabulous! and easy!  i added 1 teaspoon of Van. and reduced the cook time to 15min@450 and 10min@350.  Also, I added a pat of butter in the bottom of each muffin tin and preheated the oven to 500, warmed the tin for 2 minutes and then reduced the temp right before I put in the tray.

This is an excellent recipe.  My own tweaks:

I add 1 to 1 and 1/2 T of melted butter to the batter (richer taste)
I preheat the oven for at least 15 minutes.  I also preheat the pan for 2 minutes.
Wonderful filled with scrambled eggs and diced bacon or merely jam or marmalade.

If you've never made, or been too intimidated to make popovers, this recipe is ridiculously easy to make and turns out impressively beautiful and delicious every time.  I use a non-stick mini-muffin pan and put a small bit of butter in the bottom of each cup, spray it with non stick spray and preheat my pan till the butter is melted and sizzling, then pour the batter to fill the cups about 2/3 or 3/4 full.  For the mini-muffin size popovers, I cook at 450 for 12 minutes, then turn the oven down to 350 for 12 more minutes. This is my go to popover recipe!

For those who are stating that is doesnt rise well, the eggs and milk should be room temperature and then you will have total success with this recipe!

Great recipe.  I substituted bread flour for the all purpose flour.  I saw a Cook's Country show that recommended it because of the higher protein levels in the flour.  I also added 1/2 tsp sugar just to help the browning.

I looked up this recipe since I love the popovers at one of my favorite restaurants...I was so thrilled with the outcome and they tasted exactly like the ones I enjoy so much!  I don't have custard cups so I used a muffin pan.  I baked them at 450 for 20 mins and then lowered to 350 and only needed to bake for about 10 mins.  Yum-o!

This is an inferior recipie...these tend to be unstable popovers i.e. they deflate as soon as you take them out of the pan. all popovers are easy to make so if you've never made them before...go ahead and skip this one. i compare all popover recipies to those made in the "popover cafe" in nyc. this recipie is close to martha stewarts recipie (sans melted butter in batter) so, unless you are experimenting on how not to make them...i'd skip this one.

It might be that my oven is hotter than others, not sure, but this recipe did not work for me.  After 15 minutes at 450, I smelled a burning smell so I checked them and they were already burnt and most were popped.  I followed the directions exactly.  So I tried another batch and this time started at 350 and only cooked for 15-18 minutes.  That batch turned out much better.

Great recipe. Just remember to make sure batter is at, or slightly above, room temp. and that the pan or cups you use are pre-heated in the oven. I put my milk in the microwave for about 30 sec. to warm it up. and leave the eggs out for a while so they warm up a bit (if you keep them in the refrigerator). I just use PAM to grease my  cupcake tin and only bake @ 350F for about 10 min. Turn out great. Thanks.

I always thought that popovers would be too hard to make, but this recipe is super simple and it worked great. My custard cups are wide rather than tall, so the popovers were a little odd shaped, but they "popped" and they tasted great. I'll definitely make these again. I might get myself a popover pan, they were so good.

Um...Either my oven runs terribly hot, or I'm a popover idiot. These were burnt to a crisp after 15 minutes at the higher temperature. All the great reviews makes me think I did something wrong...but I checked the temperature twice, so I know I got it right. I will try these again, but maybe lower the initial temperature a little...

I have used this recipe countless times over the last few years. It is a great basic recipe. The key to getting the popovers out of the pan with ease is to preheat the popover pan while the oven is warming to 450*. I Pam spray the piping hot pan and quickly fill the cups with batter. I always double the recipe.

These were really easy to make and turned out very well. I don't have 6-ounce custard cups so I used small muffin tins and filled them up 3/4 of the way. They made a great breakfast food, expecially with cinnamin sugar.. Thanks for the recipe

It really works if you make one change 4 egg whites instead of two eggs, leave out the yolks entirely you will be really impressed.  Also use preheated pyrex pudding bowls with a vegetable spray.

Be cautious of your oven temperature.  I have a very accurate oven, and 450 degrees for 20 minutes was too long.  I'm thinking 15 minutes at 450 and 15 minutes at 350 is a better bet, if you use a thermometer to gauge temp.  I also pre heated my custard cups, which other recipes recommend to do.  Otherwise, they turned out pretty  good for a first go!

Quick and easy to throw together, delicious with maple butter. Used cooking spray in muffin tin cups and on edges for easy removal. Only baked for 10 min. after turning the heat down to 350' - perfect popover resulted! Lower calorie and carb alternative to biscuits/rolls.

The recipe was extremely easy to make, and the popovers came out wonderfully - even though I made them in a  popover pan (and not in custard cups).

great recipe and very easy.  The first time i made this, i used 8 holes of a muffin tin sprayed with pam and preheated.  I added a dot of butter to each tin and then added the batter.  they turned out great except some of them were still a little hard to remove from the tin....so the second time i made them, i used paper muffin liners-- don't do this!!  they stuck to the popovers and were really hard to get off!!  For the future, i'll stick with the first method or i'll invest in a popover pan!

Very easy recipe and foolproof!  Taste great with butter and jam when fresh out of the oven.  I melt a little butter in each cup of the popover pan and spray the insides and top of the pan with nonstick spray.  Thanks for the recipe.

My mom used to make popovers as an occasional dinner treat. We all loved them, but I try to make things whole wheat if possible. I knew it was going to take more than just swapping the white for wheat when it came to this more delicate recipe. But try number 2 yielded great success! My brother-in-law - who makes a point of avoiding health food - wasn't told that these were 100% whole wheat, and had several! These are the ingredients I used for making them whole wheat (This makes 1 dozen): 3 Eggs, 1 cup and 2 Tbsp white whole wheat flour (like king arthur brand) 1.5 cups skim milk, 1.5 tsp salt, 1.5 tsp vanilla extract. I'm not sure if egg beaters would work, but I'll give it a try sometime to see if I can lower the fat and calorie count, which to be honest if they don't work isn't a huge deal since the recipe as I made it is pretty low fat/cal anyway.

This is the Betty Crocker recipe.  They do "pop up" light and fluffy, but they were way to dark after the first 20 minutes at 450, so I just took them out of the oven then.  They tasted ok, but just a little "dark".

I've been using this recipe for years (I got it out of Paula Deen's first cookbook). I did try the different baking method in Christy's recipe, but find my popovers turn out better if I follow P's recipe and start with a cold oven, baking at 450 for 30 minutes (I have a gas stove) then pulling them out.

Made these Christmas Eve morning for breakfast and they were wonderful.  I don't have a popover pan, but I used a normal muffin pan and it worked out just fine.  I followed the recipe exact and thought it was great.  Now I may try it again making it more on the sweet side with my Pampered Chef caramel sprinkle then I like to make them savory by adding a bit of Old Bay Garlic and Herb seasoning.  Thanks for a great recipe!

After I made these I realized that they are kind of like mini dutch babies.  I made half salted like the recipe calls for & half with cinnamon sugar.  The salted ones were so much better.  They're crusty on the outside & chewy on the inside -they'd be great with soup or stew!  The kids loved watching them puff up in the oven.  I didn't have to bake them as long because I used a more shallow muffin tin instead of a popover pan.  When I took them out of the oven I poked a slit in the top with the tip of a knife to let the steam escape.  These also surprisingly froze fairly well.

Very delicious! I followed other user suggestions: Added 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. sugar to the batter. I mixed it all in my blender, super easy. I used my regular muffin pan, sprayed with Pam. It made 8 popovers. I baked at 450 for only 12 min. then turned heat down to 350 for 12 minutes. Perfect sprinkled on the inside w/ sugar and cinnamon once baked.

Absolutely perfect! I made these in a muffin pan with a dollop of butter in the bottom of each cup. They came out wonderfully after being loosened with a fork. The popovers were light and fluffy on the inside, with the nicest crisp on the outside. Made with garlic lemon chicken, it was the perfect compliment. My boyfriend called it homemade hot pockets!

Remember to SIFT the flour before adding it to the mixture.

I've been making these for years, and learned the hard way the flour must be sifted.

Remember - one cup unsifted is MORE than one cut sifted, so you're quantity will be incorrect if it's not sifted first.

I made this recipe today (my first ever popover attempt) and I was really impressed! I followed some of the other reviewers advice, and used room temp ingredients, and put a dab of butter in the bottom of my muffin tin (I don't have popover tins but my muffin tins worked fine, I made 8 popovers instead of 6). I experimented and preheated one tray and left the other cold. I actually liked the cold tray of popovers better, the bottoms got a little dark on the tin I preheated. And, I adjusted the time as well, 15 minutes at 450 and 15 min at 350. I will definitely make these again!

My family has made popovers for as long as I can remember. We didn't make them for several years, and as a result we lost the recipe. Recently we decided to make popovers, and I found this one.. Just like the ones we've always made! It's quick and easy- we can double it when we are serving a big bunch, or I can half it for a quick lunch for myself. We will eat them alone for dinner, breakfast.. Whatever!

As someone else said, we only cook for 20 minutes and they are done perfectly! Occasioanlly they need an extra minute or two- but no more or they burn!

Taste - delicious.  Mine did not stay "popped up" but this was my first time making popovers and after doing some research I've read a few things that would have made a big difference.

We had never had popovers. Not impressed and will probably not eat one again. To my entire house it was a roll with a hint of egg. We tried putting apple butter, cinnamon butter, maple syrup, almost anything on it to sweeten it or make it taste. Nothing worked.

Definitely by far the fastest and easiest breakfast or anytime rolls/bread. Followed recipe ingredients as written, but baked on 450 degrees for 15 min., and 350 degrees for 15 min.. I think next time I will let them bake at 450 for just a couple of minutes longer, as some of them were just a touch too moist on the inside. BTW I used a large muffin tin.  But great easy recipe, and can be topped with just about anything. (Had one of mine with butter and goat cheese, mmm...) Thanks for the recipe Christy!

The easiest, most perfect, delicious popover recipe I have ever found!  My husband went to school in Britain, and he said these rivaled the best he's had.  (I didn't tell him they took less than 5 minutes to prep... ; )  I served them alongside a roast beef, so I used the pan drippings to grease the muffin tin - the traditional fattening way! (I used a six-muffin tin with large cups, the recipe only filled 5 of them 1/2 way with batter, which was fine).  They puffed up high and held that way through the temp reduction.  PERFECT texture and taste.  Try 'em!  For those than haven't tried popovers yet (based on some of the other reviews)...  Popovers have no real taste of their own, so they can take on the flavor of whatever you top/serve them with.  They are egg-y and a bit chewy.  If yours come out this way, you've done everything right!

Very Easy and Good!! My husband made these with whole wheat flour and soy milk, over-mixed them, used small muffin tins, and almost burned them but they were still very good!  Since they still turned-out after all those mistakes, I'd say this recipe is solid.

These are fantastic, but you have to follow directions perfectly.  I've made paperweights, as well as beautifully huge & fluffy popovers with this.  Don't overmix, grease pan well, etc.

These are so easy and always come out soooooo good.  I recommend greasing the custard cups generously with butter as it will make the popovers really pop and much easier to get out of the cup. My oven is really fickle and never keeps the right temperature, but these still always come out perfectly.

This recipe was wonderful, I didn't bake them for quite as long as it said in the recipe. I kept the popovers in the oven for about 15 minutes at 450 or until a nice not too dark golden brown and then for another about 11-13 minutes at 350 degrees or until they look puffed up. Maybe the cooking time was shorter because I filled my muffin pans half way. These tasted great and my family added their favorites (butter and apricot jam) while I added a dash of cinnamon and sugar on mine. So yummy!

This is very similar to the Jordan Pond house Recipe -- JPH in Acadia National Park has been making the most incredible popovers on earth since the 19th century.  They recommend making the batter a day before then cover and  refrigerate overnight, then take out an hour before baking.  Also bake at 450 for 14 minutes, 350 for 15 minutes.  The warmer the pan, the better the rise.  I grease the pan with butter.

The best popovers. Like other reviewers noted, the timing is off. I recommend 10 minutes at 450 and then 15 minutes at 350. I also preheated the pan with 1/2 tsp. of butter in the bottom of each cup. Then after preheating, I sprayed the pan with a non-stick vegetable spray. They came right out of the pan.

I actually reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp. for this recipe and they rise much more. Also instead of 20 minutes at 350° I do 10 m. I love putting honey over them when ready to eat! Yum

My daughter had mixed the batter herself. I used remekins and buttered it; baked it at 450 for 15min then 350 for 15min. I liked how it leaves a hollow dome on the bottom. I would like to make this again and top it with strawberry topping (AR)

So good! I adore bread, and these were so quick and easy to make. Good with peanut butter, jam, chili, buttered, or just plain. Would probably be a great addition to a soup/stew meal.

God... These were out of this world. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of these. Especially spread with the Cinnamon Honey Butter (also found on this site). I added a little bit of sugar and cinnamon mix to the popovers to add a touch of sweetness. Didn't have custard cups so I used a cupcake tin and had no problems with it.

20mins at 230C and another 20mins at 175C burnt my first batch of popovers. With my 2nd batch i put 15mins at 200C and another 15mins at 190C - turned out better, but the crust was still too dark while insides a little moist. Will try again in future, but would perhaps substitute a little sugar/honey to the salt to it to make it sweet instead of savoury.

These baked beautifully and really "popped". I thought however that they lacked a little in flavor (I did add the teaspoon of vanilla other reviewers have suggested). They smelled really good while in the oven. Thank you for the great recipe.

I'm thrilled with this recipe!  I had a recipe that came with my popover pan which I'd made previously that didn't turn out as good or chewy as these did!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding 1 tsp. of vanilla.  Glad I did because they were delicious and got family raves!  I doubled the recipe and served them with the Cinnamon Honey Butter recipe, which was awesome!  I'll be making these again!

Easy to make. I did put my buttered popover pans in the oven before filling. They looked and tasted great. Mine cooked faster than recipe suggests. 450 for 20 min. then 375 for 10. I will make this again!

These were easy and delicious.  I don't have a custard cup pan so I used a mini muffin pan and cut the time way down.  About 6 minutes at 450º and 6 more minutes at 350º.  I also used the idea of adding some vanilla to the batter, and adding a touch of butter in the pan and heating the pan prior to adding the batter before baking.

This was my first experience with making popovers, and I'm happy to report that it was a good one!  Followed the directions exactly except I used cooking spray and heated the pan in the over for approx 30 seconds.  A great breakfast option!

I'm giving 5 stars, wishing there was actually a question and answer on this. I did as recipe stated and they came out small and dense. I halved the recipe so I'm sure it was something I did wrong, so can't give less. I really want them to turn out!

Very good!  I doubled the recipe and put in 5 eggs.  A double batch makes just over 2 dozen when made in muffin tins. I sprayed the muffin tins with Pam With Flour and added a tiny bit of butter to each cup (completely optional, I just like the flavor).  We like to top them with fresh fruit, whipped cream, and syrup.  It's my kids' favorite breakfast.

Always a success.  They popover very high and the flavor is light enough that my children can use maple syrup, butter, or jam if they like.  (I like them plain!)

Perfect as written. Didn't use room-temp anything, didn't preheat the pan (just the oven), and they were gorgeous. I baked them the full 40 minutes, too. But I used a convection oven. Maybe that was the trick? I also poked them with a skewer right out of the oven, and they stayed inflated for hours. They got cold but remained delicious all morning.

I was out of vegetable oil and this recipe doesn't require it, so I thought I would give it a try. I don't have custard cups so I used a muffin pan as I always do and got 11 popovers. They all rose beautifully and were very crisp and evenly browned. This is my new popover recipe!

These didn't turn out well for me. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I don't know if it's the altitude at which I live, or what, but these did not rise at all. They came out looking more like biscuits. :( Any advice?

This was my first attempt at popovers and I was so very nervous! Like other reviewers I didn't have a popover pan so I used my muffin tin. Mine popped, but not as high as I'd like, mainly I feel because my pan wasn't preheated hot enough (will definitely make sure they're hotter next time). I allowed all the ingredients to come to room temperature and did heat the milk slightly. I sprayed the tins and put a tiny pat of butter in the bottom of each one. My batter actually sat for more than an hour, after mixing by a hand mixer until smooth. I know some of the other reviews stated that alone the popovers were bland, but mine were perfect! Crisp on the outside, soft and tender on the inside, with a slight hint of the egg. Not mushy in the least. I baked mine for 15 min at 400 and then another 15 at 350 but my oven runs extremely hot and is quirky. I served these fresh and hot out of the oven with honey butter, DELICIOUS!!! So happy my venture into popovers turned out great, this recipe's a keeper!

With Abigail Porter's additions to the directions, these turned out fantastic. Preheating the pan, and using room temp eggs and milk made for popovers that were sky-high, beautiful and delicious.

LOVE POPOVERS! We added a little but of vanilla when we cooked it. Also, I found that they only need 30 minutes total of cooking time. Do 15 minutes at 350* and 15 minutes at 450*. That's the other secrect or they'll burn. Yum! I didn't bother flouring the pan, just did spray butter and they turned out great!

I preheated the pan as suggested by others and this recipe came out perfect!  This is definitely a keeper.  Since I only had a muffin pan as an option, I adjusted the cooking time to 15 minutes at each temp to adjust for the smaller size.

This was a great popover recipe! They puffed up beautifully and were hollow inside, just like a popover.  
Note: If you don't have a popover pan, use your muffin pans. Butter the insides and the top of the pans well or use a muffin liner and brush butter in them prior to putting the batter in. Know your oven, adjust the time as needed, and watch them towards the end.  You need a high heat to get them rising and airy, so don't skip that step!  

Yummy!

YES. I have made these many times, the lower the kitchen humidity seems better (like Fall and Winter!)
PRE-HEAT oven for 30 minutes...Very important.

Mine are 3 xl eggs room temp, 2 c. milk room temp.(2%, 2 c. unbleached flour, 1/2 t. Kosher salt.  Room temp. seems to help.
The night before on the counter is Fine for eggs and milk.
Whip eggs lightly, add milk slowly, add flour and salt. In all it takes 30 seconds!!!  Or less.
Have Popover pan (Bed, Bath and Beyond, $12.00) sprayed with regular Pam. Pour 2/3 full.
Bake as directed. Have some nice butter and French Jam ready!

I love this recipe. I've been using the Betty Crocker recipe for several years - which is exactly the same as this one. I also saw Rachel Ray has this same recipe too. Can't fix what's not broke!

Love this recipe! I bought a popover pan because I wanted to try making my own. I followed this recipe to the T and they came out great! Love them with lemon curd!

Perfect popovers, even sans popover pan!  I added rosemary and sage, but otherwise, recipe was followed exactly.  Popovers were still lovely the next day (in the past, they've only been good immediately).  Lovely and we thank you!  Staple recipe.

As another reviewer suggested I added 1 tsp vanilla and a small amount of butter to the bottom of each cup, I also added 1 tbsp bakers sugar. They only needed to bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.

I had to alter baking times and temps, but they turned out so great I wish there was a 10 star option!
I served them with cinnamon honey butter (also on allrecipes.com) on Valentine's Day to my husband and we feel in love all over again (with breakfast).

Delicious. Big, fluffy, tasty, cheap and easy. Definitely needs the salt. Only needed 30 minutes total in my oven. update..made a second time without the dab of butter (pre-melted in the oven) and they did not turn out well, too doughy thick and tough. The dab of melted butter seemed to make a big difference.

Overcooked! Popovers should be light inside and these were like a roll almost all the way through although I followed the exact recipe. Flavor was ok, but next time I would cut the cooking time 5 minutes on each heat setting and see what happens.

I bought a mini popover pan (Nordic Ware) and used this recipe and the family loved them. So easy, light, crisp, so good. 450 for 15 minutes then 350 for 15 minutes worked for the minis.

These were so easy even I could do it!  I love these never had a popover before.  I did modify.  400 for 15 minutes and added a bag of finely shredded Parmesian Cheese to serve with dinner.  They turned out perfect!!

WOW!  I'd always been too afraid to attempt popovers, but this recipe was simple and delish!  My only thing is that, for me, they were done after the first 20 mins and did not need the second 20 at a lower temp.  But other than that, easy, delicious, awesome.

These are easy, fun and delicious.  Mine were a little browner than preferred, but I just got a new oven and think they needed to be on a lower rack. My only complaint is a Popover complaint in that you have to eat them immediately and they take a long time to bake.

Only adjustment I made to this was useing room temp. milk. I love this recipe because you can make it at the last moment. You dont have to worry about having yeast! Everyone loves the crispy outside and spreading on the butter.

Very yummy.  Having misplaced my own popover recipe, this was a great substitute that I will make again and again.  Delicious with roast beef and gravy. (And yes, they are supposed to be a little doughy inside.)

I love this recipe, so delicious and versatile. You can make these popovers savory or sweet, the flavor possibilities are endless. However, I do find that my popovers come out differently everytime I bake them.

This recipe is fine, but I made a HUGE mistake. I used silicon baking cups.  They turned out like muffins, except soft and rubbery in the middle. Disgusting.   I have made popovers before using Alton Brown's Good Eats recipe, which turned out PERFECT. I guess I will be making this again, but not in silicone cups. =(  Also, add 1 tbsp room temp butter for additional flavor.

I should have read the reviews first...especially the ones that talk about turning down the temperature!      For flavor and ease it is 4 stars, but for the temperature and cooking... -3.    I only got as far as the 20 min on 230'C, and they were dark brown...got them out just as burning was going to occur.  I would have had smoke alarms going off if I had kept them in the oven for the other 20 minutes.    I will try again, but as others say - have to pay much more attention to the cooking in the oven part - and figure out what really works.

Easy to make, but I'm not too crazy about the flavor. My husband on the other hand loved them! I think these are best paired with something sweet. The only change I made to these was baking them for 15 minutes at 450, then around 8 minutes at 350.

These were so easy to make! They are a great breakfast treat but I also use them for appetizers for parties. I make chicken salad and guests spoon the salaad into the popover!

So easy to make, and so yummy! I always thought that you needed fat drippings to make a good popover, but with this recipe, it makes a great batter for an easy addition to a meal. Make sure you give yourself ample time for the baking. I doubled the recipe since I needed more than 6, but found out that this recipe is probably for a larger pan- I have a cupcake sized popover pan, and doubling made about 18 popovers. They all went though, everyone loved them and asked for more!

this recipe is right out of Betty Crocker, and it is good as is. However, it is much, much tastier if you put 1/2 tsp of lard/bacon grease in each cup and put in 450 degree oven to preheat. When fat begins to smoke, take them out, pouring batter into each cup.  Place back in oven and bake for 20 minutes. This tip eliminates the need to continue cooking at 325 for an additional 20 minutes and yields a much richer flavor.

I altered the recipe today due to lack of ingredients.  This also works great with soymilk(I used Silk Vanilla Light), same measurements!!  OMG...I put it in a large muffin(12 muffin) tin. They came out beautiful, just slightly sweet with the tiniest hint of vanilla.  Served it with honey butter.  I suggest 15 @ 450 and 15@ 350, they cook quickly.

I used a muffin pan b/c I don't have a popover pan. They came out a bit flat but they were delicious! We ate them with raspberry jelly and a warm cup of coffee! Yum! Thanks for sharing Christy!

These turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a nonstick popover pan. I never knew popovers were so easy and the calorie content is not bad! I'm going to make them much more often... these are just like my mom used to make.

They "popped" up beautifully in a regular popover pan greased  with a cooking spray. They came out of the pan without a problem. I have two suggestions. The first is to add a tablespoon of butter for a little richer flavor and second reduce the cooking time at 450 to 15 minutes. I have an oven thermometer so I know the oven temp was 450 on the button and at 20 minutes they were all ready very brown.

Turned out well, although a few deflated.  The insides are hollow, flaky, and moist - absolutely delicious.  I doubled the recipe and used a muffin tin, getting about 16 popovers.  I filled alternating cups to the top (it gives you bigger poofs), and filled the remaining cups 1/2 full of water.  It keeps them moist.  Also, it is ok if your batter is a bit lumpy - overmixing is worse.  Some I sprinkled with chicken seasoning for a more savory flavor.   Tips others used (my thanks to fellow reviewers):  Cook at 450 for 15 minutes, then 350 for 15 minutes, without opening the oven door in between.  Bring eggs and milk to room temperature.  REALLY grease your pan - I used the works and still had trouble getting them out.

Mine came out awesome!  Beautiful!  The first time I followed the directions to the letter and the second time I changed it up a bit by adding parsley and garlic and spices and it was delicious too.  Also a beautiful presentation and definite family pleaser!  Fab recipe!

Oh My goodness. After 12 years of failed attempts, primarely due to our Colorado address, on this father's day, I was able to serve these glorious wonders that had become such a favorite in our home. Thanks to everyone's idea. Hot oven, Hot pan, sprayed with pam adding a dallop of butter in bottom.

These were my 1st Popovers to bake ever. I added some vanilla to mine and also baked them for a total of 3o mins. I served some with melted jam and some with a cinnamon honey butter (from this site). They were great, but maybe a little under done inside.

Ridiculously easy and good!  I don't have a popover tin (yet!) so I used a muffin tin.  Put a dab of butter in some cups and left some without butter.  As many others have said, the ones with butter came out easily, those without butter got totally stuck--I had to tear them out.  Will make again--soon!

This is just a good basic recipe, but we jazz it up a bit and are trying some of the others on this site. We tried making them in our convention oven and it was a NO GO so don't even try it. One suggestion my Grandmother taught me that may be helpful to those whose popovers aren't rising... Make sure the ingredients begin at room temperature. The popovers seem to develop better this way. We serve this with chicken salad in it for a nice presentation.

It definitely helps to have the eggs and milk at room temp.  Great recipe!  It is very difficult to find popovers at bakeries near me.  So, it is nice to be able to make them myself!

Help!! This recipe did NOT go well for me!  By the 20 min. mark they were burning on the tops yet when I took them out after 40 minutes they were still doughy on the inside and collapsed after a few minutes out of the oven.  So sad!  The only acceptable aspect was they came out of the popover dishes easily.  I'm so glad I only made a single batch - any advice??

I tried another recipe which called for 3 eggs and then this one. Both turned about the same...a little too brown on the outside and not done enough on the inside...this recipe turned out better shaped popovers...but can't figure out why they aren't done in the middle...help.. what am I doing wrong.

Ok so I had never made popovers before and they were super easy! I ended up putting some of the mixture in small custard dishes and the rest in my muffin pan cause I ran out of the other dishes. All of them were really good. I did like the ones in the custard dishes better because they had more of the "popover" flavor and form. I did cook them for a shorter amount of time cause I didn't want them to burn. I think I took 5-10 minutes off of each oven temp and they turned out great. I will be making these again :)

Mmm... I'm not too sure what it was that wasn't right. I followed the instructions perfectly and they got too brown too fast and it was still raw in the middle. I don't think I would make them again, I think maybe the temperature is too high.

These are great and so easy. My mom used to make popovers when we were growing up so this took me back to a happy time. I took them out of the oven about 5 minutes early as they were getting very brown. Ate them with real butter and they were delicious!

These turned out fantastic! My only frown was when they deflated. They remind me of Dutch Baby's that you get at the original house of pancakes. 
Next time I'll add a little bit more sugar for a sweeter taste and maybe make savory popovers for dinner parties! 
Thanks again!!

Delicious, but more cake like and not so cavernous as pop overs are. I made a few changes,adding cinnamon . I heated up the milk and also  put the  pop over pan in the oven as it was heating up. I added the warm milk into the flour mixture and poured it straight into the warmed up pan. The cook time was way off as they were done at about the 30 minute mark. They were delicious though.

Wonderful and simple recipe. Definitely agree with some of the other reviews to keep eggs and milk at room temp. I use a muffin pan, and use Pam to grease. Preheat oven to 450 for 15 min, then down to 350  for 10 min more...they come out perfect every time.

I baked mine 450 for 15 then 350 for 15 and they were still a little too dark coming out of oven. Really watch how fast they are browning in your oven because I realized they could burn very quickly.  I used a popover pan and this made 6 nice sized popovers.

These were incredible!!!!

A couple things to note (reason for not giving a full 5 stars): 
1. The pan should be preheated before pouring the batter into the cups.
2. To really make them rise quickly, pour 1/2 cm (or a bit more) of vegetable oil into the bottom of the muffin cups before pre-heating the pan. The hot oil combining with the batter will start the cooking & rising process before they even have a chance to get back into the oven!
3. Make SURE the batter is room temperature before pouring it into the pre-heated pan. 

I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon to the batter, then refrigerated it for a couple hours until I was ready to make them. I took them out of the fridge with enough time for everything to return to room temperature, then pulsed it in the blender for a few whirls to smooth out some large chunks and incorporate more air. 

Keep a close eye on these! Mine were done in only 30 minutes!

I served them with honey butter and there wasn't a crumb left :)

I have made many popover recipes, but these were the best. I made sure all ingredients were room temperature. I sprayed a popover pan with PAM with flour because I always have had problems with them sticking. These came out perfectly. Next time I will sprinkle a little parm cheese into the cups before baking for flavor.

This is a great traditional recipe. Popovers have always been one of my favorite foods. A tip for first bakers, if there are any lumps in the batter, do not worry. I have heard that putting cinnamon on them is a good idea. Sounds great I will try this soon. I also added about 1 teaspoon of Vanilla. This recipe makes only a few popovers. I tripled it and still needed to add more.  Overall this is an AMAZING recipe.

So simple and a wonderful addition to any meal.  Made them with soup and they were perfect.  I did shorten the time at 450 to 15 minutes and 350 also to 15 minutes which was perfect.  I would definitely make them again.

I went into this with low expectations, not because the recipe seemed bad but because it was my first time attempting popovers in my came-with-the-house older-than-time-itself oven, which is often inconsistent with its temperatures, and because all I had in the fridge was skim milk, and my electric beater was broken so I had to use a manual eggbeater.

However, they came out beautifully.  Even with the skim milk and manual mixer, each popover popped up delightfully.  They were crusty and tasty outside, super fluffy and soft inside.  None collapsed.  We had them with a datil pepper jam, but they were also pretty tasty just plain.  I will certainly make again!

I was apprehensive about making these as I had never made popovers before, but much to my amazement these turned out exactly as they were supposed to...puffy and delicious! However, I gave the recipe only 4 stars because of the omission in the directions of using room temperature milk and eggs and pre-heating the pan. If I had not read others' reviews I wonder if the popovers would have turned out as good. In any case, these are easy, inexpensive, and delicious!

Great recipe..a few things I have learned over time...be sure all ingredients are room temperature, pre heat the tins prior to using (till very hot, pull them out, grease them and then pour the popover mix in) and last but not least, do not open the oven door to check on them!!

Great base for popovers. I use this recipe and add browned sausage and garlic in the popover pan first and then smoked mozzarella cheese and then the popover recipe and it comes out fantastic. Great for brunch.

Easy to make and came out great. I followed the recommendations and use room temperature milk and eggs as well as preheating the pan. I also cooked them @ 450 for 20 min and the reduced heat to 350 and cooked for another 30 min.

So easy!  I didn't bother preheating the muffin tin. I used PAM spray and added one extra egg. I also cut down on the cooking time a bit. They rose and were so light and airy that my family demolished the entire dozen within 15 minutes. I'm sure that the batter was "over mixed" as my 8 year daughter was helping me make them. I think the extra egg helped. They slid out of the muffin tins without a problem. I'm sure other recipes produce delicious popovers as well, but this version really made things so simple that we'll be cooking them much more frequently.

Excellent and easy recipe. This was the first time I made popovers and they came out wonderful. I used butter to liberally grease the muffin tin and then also sprayed with cooking spray being sure to cover the top of the tin as well (I did not flour the tin). The popovers removed easily. I also reduced the cooking time @450 to 15 mins as the popovers were browning quickly and reduced the time @350 to 15 mins as well.

I read the reviews before I made these. I let the eggs and milk come to room temp. I added 1 tsp. vanilla. I forgot to preheat the popover pan, but I did add a dab of butter to the bottom of each cup and I coated the top rims of each cup with butter. I preheated the oven. I put them in for 20 minutes, and then watched them when I turned the heat down to 350 and after 10 minutes they were very dark, so I took them out. I'm not sure if they should have been left in a little longer. The outside was very dark and the inside was chewy. Next time I will take the top rack out because they were hitting the top rack.

I've been trying all kinds of popover recipes. My mom used to make them and fill with REAL whipped cream for a special dessert.   This recipe was perfect. I found that pre-heating my pan, room temperature eggs and warmed whole milk worked best.

The popovers puffed up nicely (though I did preheat the pan), but the recipe makes for a very bland popover. The next batch I did, I added pepper and garlic and some cheese, which made them much better.

I tried this recipe..Omg! Loved it was easy they puffed up nicely & totally held the puff when they cooled. I used two different topings/ fillings. 1st was a cinnamon-honey butter 2nd I cut a slight criss cut on top & piped inside of them cool whip...my family loved both & they stayed firm on outside soft on the inside. "WINNER" in my opinion.

I used this recipe for breakfast this morning. By heating the pan first and letting the eggs and milk come to room temp.  Great!  crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I then cooked a couple slices of bacon a bit of sausage, scrambled a couple eggs, sautéed some onion and bell pepper, mixed together and stuffed the popovers, topped with grated cheddar and there you have it!  Great, "light" breakfast.

This is a great recipe with a couple modifications on technique (not recipe). First, fill cups almost full.  This recipe filled 4 of the 6 of my pop over pan cups (yup, I own a popover pan =). They'll pop up huge this way!  When I don't do this, they don't pop right (note: I don't have the best oven in my rental so might also be a heat issue).  Also use coconut oil to grease the pans. I did a quick test between using coconut and butter and found that the coconut works better (used spray to get the sides and lip of the cups).  Popovers slide right out. In the past i have used olive oil & EVOOo sprays but always had some sticking.  I usually spray pan and put a little dollup of oil in each cup the head it for a few moments.  I fill the cups immediately after removing from the oven with the pan and oil hot.

I love popovers, so I am confused about this recipe. The temperature is way too hot for way too long. I thought maybe I was missing something so I tried it twice. They end up rock hard on the outside. Granted the inside is light and fluffy, but I think I'll stick to the standard recipe I have used for years.

These turned out hard and flatter than they should. I think the butter was left out of the recipe. I followed recipe exactly as written, oven temp as directed. Very disappointing.

I have tried many recipes for popovers.  This one seems to be the winner.  They rise really tall, and they are nice and "eggy"!  This is the only one I use now.

My first popover attempt and they came out great! Just like our favorite bakery. I used a muffin tin as this was all we had (made 7 popovers in a standard size muffin pan) and followed the other suggestions I read to bake at 450 for 15 min then 350 for 10 minutes. Also brought eggs and milk to room temperature and sifted the flour. Everyone was impressed!

Made this recipe this morning for my husband and my toddler.  BIG HIT!  I did add a few dashes of pure vanilla, I used (almost) room temp eggs and milk, and baked at 450 for 15 minutes, 350 for another 15 minutes.  Also, as I saw in some reviews for popovers, I preheated the pan with a bit of butter in each cup for about 90 seconds.  My husband can't wait for me to make these again next Sunday!

Thought this was excellent and easy to make! I used muffin tins, so maybe mine were smaller. I only buttered and floured 6 cups which was a mistake on my part (oops!). The other ones didn't rise as well and stuck pretty badly. Next time I'll prep them all.  Also, I had to cover them with foil at the 30 minute mark as they were getting too brown. I would say to increase the salt though. Although a dab of butter when serving and some jam might solve it. These came out great!

As simple as it was to assemble, I was surprised to see that after 20mins at 450F, my popovers were totally burnt. Since I have a brand new oven that has a built-in digital thermometer, I KNOW that it wasn't running "hot". Watch them closely!!!

A great, dependable recipe.  I make them in muffin tins (which I grease and then leave in the oven as it's preheating) and they turn out amazing!  Highly recommended.

Excellant, super easy recipe.  I caution for a light touch with the mixing and only whisked the batter until smooth with a few tiny lumps.  I used a ceramic muffin dish, greased and floured as the recipe called for, but had to cut the final cooking time by 6 minutes because they would have burnt.  Delish with braised beef ribs and roasted veggies!

Very good. I served them with the cinnamon honey butter. I put the ingredients in the blender and just pulse blended. Can't wait to serve them again as they are so easy to make.

What did I do wrong? These popovers came out hard as a rock. These were my favorite things to make as a kid and they were always great. This is obviously not the same recipe that I used in the 70's but  i was expecting them to be good based on all the good reviews. Total disappointment. I'm questioning the 40 minute baking time. I think they looked great at 20 mins.

Popover came out small and not very rich and buttery since there was no butter called for in recipe. Very disappointing. And used spray and flour and it still stuck to the pan. NEEDS BUTTER. *desperately looking for my old popover recipe now*

These were good despite the fact that I used muffin tins (this made 10 mini popovers), however, I will invest in a popover pan for my next batch to make them nice and airy- just how I like them.  They were a bit too small and dense in the muffin tins.  I did as another reviewer suggested and placed a dab of butter at the bottom of each tin, placed the tin the preheated oven to let it melt, and then added my batter (apparently this was supposed to help them "pop" more).  While they didn't pop as much as I would have liked, they tasted wonderful and had a nice, eggy texture.

I doubled the recipe and added 2 tsp of vanilla. Cooked for 15 minutes on 450 and 15 minutes on 350 degrees.  The outside looked great.  The inside was a little doughy.  I've never had popovers before, so I'm not sure what the inside is supposed to look like.  They were good!

These stuck to the pan and got pretty burnt when I followed the directions to a T.  I would recommend reducing both temps, and possibly melting some butter in the muffin tin before adding the popover "dough."

one star knocked off cause it was like pancake batter in the middle, but partially cooked batter so it was okay. Would lower the time of it cooking at 450F to 10minutes since 20 minutes browns it too much on the outside where as it only books partially inside. [cooking it further at 350 almost burnt mine]

This was so easy and a great accompaniment to my brandy chicken and corn dish!  I used my popover pan which is half size and baked 20 min on 450 and 12 on 350; cut the recipe in half and it made 6 smaller popovers at 60 calories each!  I ate 3 which made me feel like I had indulged!!  A little spray butter and dollop of mixed berry jam topped them off.  I will be making these more often.

Made tonight and it was fabulous! Light, fluffy, and yummy. Be sure to serve pop with creamy butter. Once it cools down it definitely loses it magic. I will no longer purchase grocery store refrigerated biscuits.

This popver recipe was the most successful version I have found!   One tip though, with a full kitchen and the reassurance of a few other really good cooks I tried a dab of bacon grease in the bottom of the pan instead of butter.  Popovers will rise better and the grease and surprisingly it will not absorb into the puff most will stay in the pan.  It also has a higher heat tolerance. It's so fun to cook with friends and discover new things together:)

I made them for dinner tonight and they were easy and wonderful!  I never made popovers before but had all the ingredients so I thought I'd try them.  Easy smeezy.  I did take other reviewer's advice and shortened the cooking time for each temp by 5 minutes.  Try them!

Delicious. Made a perfect breakfast. As a side note, I used almond milk instead of cow's milk. My girlfriend is lactose intolerant and I'm allergic to soy. I replaced the milk with 1 cup vanilla almond breeze. This made it slightly sweet, which I doubt the cow's milk would do, but we loved it. I used a muffin pan instead of custard cups and they were fine. Judging from the picture, given muffin sized seem smaller, I wouldn't cook them for nearly as long. They were already browning 10 min into the 350 cycle, and I pulled them out then.  Toppings are a must for me next time. Honey was good, but a jam, melted chocolate or even adding lemon/orange zest to the batter would be good. But these are like pancakes, good alone, better with toppings.  Oh, and in case this helps anyone, my "lightly beaten eggs" I popped the yolks and just did a dozen beats with a fork until the yolk and whites were marbled, but not mixed. And as soon as I didn't see anymore flour in the batter, I gave two big stirs and stopped. It was still clumpy, but no flour was visible. Anyone else, feel free to correct me on that.

I've never made popovers before, so maybe I don't get it, but these puppies had no flavor. Maybe popovers are not suppose to have flavor??? (I suppose I should have inferred the lack of flavor by the list of ingredients.)  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the popover batter, but it didn't help.  I served them with Allreceipes' Cinnamon Honey Butter, and the butter was fairly good, but the popovers are nothing but tasteless texture.  Yes, they rose beautifully, and yes they're pretty to look at, but if I'm gonna put it in my mouth more than once, I need a taste experience to make it worth it.

These are fantastic!  I buttered ramekins and preheated them in the oven before pouring in the batter.   To those of you whose popovers were heavy, you likely didn't let them cook long enough.  You really have to let them bake the entire time to allow all the layers to separate.  They fall right out of the ramekins when they're done.  I love them with a bit of strawberry butter.  Fun breakfast alternative.

Perfect, easy popovers.  I only had to bake them at 350 for 15 minutes, as they looked like they would burn if in any longer.  I would love to know how to make cheese popovers, can I just put cheese in the middle of the batter?  Great, easy, delicious!

We love popovers and this recipe fits the bill.  Made with simple ingredients we always have on hand.  And, it was simple to tweak it to satisfy my gluten-free little one.  Just used her flour mixture in place of the regular flour and added 1 tsp of xanthan gum.  Mmmm.  We also tried the cinnamon flavored ones and found they didn't rise as high.  But, still yummy :)

Really quite nice - mine fell in near the end; didn't puff up like the one in the picture...  But that's alright; as they still tasted great; and with the dents in the middle; worked out great for filling!  So even though I'd done something (What; I'm not sure...) wrong; they'd still turned out very nice; and we will still certinally make them again!

Excellent. As another commenter recommended, a little pat of butter in the bottom of preheated cups and reduced cooktime (15/15) and they came out flawless.

i have never made popovers before, so i didn't know what to expect. i followed the instructions as is, but i halved the recipe and i had to take them out of the oven 10 or 15 minutes earlier, because they were going to burn (probably because i forgot that i halfed it, oops). i put it on the middle rack and used muffin paper cups. it was dark brown on the outside and yellow and hollow on the inside. the popovers stuck to the muffin paper cups (i should have greased them). maybe i will try this one again another day. but i'm wondering what to eat/serve it with?

Delicious and simple, but a little "egg-y" tasting.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and preheated the cups and added a dab of butter in each with good results.

Super easy and delicious! I made mine with exact ingredients right out of the frig.  I used a large muffin tin, sprayed with baking Pam in a convection oven with stated temps.  I did decrease cooking time by about 6 minutes at each temp.  My husband thought I had bought them at a specialty bakery, they were that good!

Easy, fast and delicious.  I sprayed PAM into 6 custard cups and preheated oven.  I threw all the ingredients into a blender, adding an additional 1/2 cup canned corn.  I pulsed the blender for 5-6 times then using a spatula, I scraped the sides of the blender down.  I pulsed again for another 2-3 times and poured into the custard cups.  I baked the popovers according to the recipe.  They turned out beautifully - golden brown, crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside.

This recipe is as simple as it is delicious...the popovers come out tall, crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside. This is my go to side whenever I make stew or soup.

I thought this to be a good basic recipe.  To turn out well begin with room temp. milk & eggs and sifted flour.  I whisked the eggs & other ingredients (leaving a few flour lumps), rested the batter, whisked again briefly, placed in warmed custard cups, & baked at 450 for 15 minutes before lowering temp. When you open them, let the steam dissipate before buttering.  If you live in high places, popovers turn out best using high altitude flour.

These were alright, though the baking time is off (at least for my oven).  I took them out after 30 min. (20 min. at 450, 10 min. at 350).  They're a little eggy tasting...maybe I just haven't had popovers enough to know what they're really supposed to be like.

Loved these!!  I only had a muffin tin, so I made smaller popovers and baked for 15 minutes at 450 and 10 minutes at 350.  I preheated the tin with a dab of butter in the bottom as suggested by another reviewer.  They were perfect!

Excellent recipe.  I did heat the muffin tin first with a dollop of butter in each one.  I also lowered the temp. 25 degrees and they cooked in 20-25 minutes.  I had many compliments on them.

Had I read the reviews before making these I definitely would have reduced the the cooking time.  After the first twenty minutes they were very dark, and by the end they were overdone.  However, they rose very well and still had a pretty good flavor.  Next time I'll only cook them for 15 minutes at 450 before reducing the temperature.

My oven is new and right on tempature wise (I also use an oven thermometer) but these turned out very brown. I even stopped baking after 10 minutes at 350 degrees. I did bake for the full 20 at 450 degrees. Maybe 10 minutes per temp. would work better?

If you are looking for something easy that tastes great don't look any further. This is by far the best recipe! (and so easy!) I didn't have the custard cups so I just used a muffin tin and they still came out so good, just a different shape! I did bake them for 20 minutes on 450 but decreased the baking time to 15 minutes on the 350 temp. They looked done and I was afraid they would get too brown. So delicious! I think next time I'll try it with the cinnamon and sugar. Yum!

Tip:  Don't open oven to check on these until they have baked at least 20 min!!!!I used ingredients as listed, but added one T oil to the mix.  Pan: didn't preheat pan.  I sprayed generously with non-stick oil, put a piece of cold butter (about the size of a dime) on the bottom of each cup to prevent sticking, and mixed by hand the flour, milk (I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half) salt, and oil first, then added the already lightly beaten eggs. Baked at 425 for 20 min. and at 375 for 10 more. 
Popped right out of the pans and into our hungry mouths - well, first we added loads of butter that melted-but they are great at room temp with no butter! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I guess I must of review this  recipe ages ago and i have made popovers for many years loking for perfect recipe> i made this one and they were excellent -the  baking time was less than stated though --I turned my oven off the last 5 min and took  out early, My only problem was  my popover tin was sticking ---any ideas  on how I should be greasing it(I   sprayed with pam)?  I added  1 t. of vanilla tomilk and secret is to beat eggs  1stand add other ingre  and don't beat hard.

Not quite what I expected.  Somewhat dense, but tasty.  I expected them to raise more - might be my 7000 foot altitude.

This is a great recipe and very simple! A tip I learned from my grandmother: ensure that all of your ingredients are at room temperature when you start. Remember not to open the oven while they’re baking. Popovers need a lot of heat to keep their steam needed to rise.

I’ve tried this recipe twice now without success.  The first time I used almond milk and I realized that might be the reason they never popped so I tried again with normal milk and they popped only a little bit on the edges but were still too dense.  The batter is tasty.  I did preheat the pan, dab the cups with butter and let the batter sit out before baking.  All I can think is maybe I didn’t beat the eggs alone long enough before adding the other ingredients?  I will report back when I figure it out...

This was my first time making these and they were perfect!  Exactly like the ones I had in Minnesota.  Other reviews said to get the eggs and milk to room temp before mixing, so I did that and I also sprayed PAM in the wells of the baking pan as well as putting a 'dot' of butter in each one.  I baked for 450 for 15 minutes and reduced the temp to 350 for 15 minutes for a perfect baking time.  I did not open the oven until they were finished.  We are in Idaho and our elevation is around 2500 so my baking often needs altering but this was my perfect process.

Turned out great.   Family loved them.  I only had shallower cupcake pan, so I baked them for only half the time after it was time to turn down the heat.

No, didn't make any changes, when I cooked it the 40 minutes total, they turned out kind of burnt. So with my second batch I put them in for about 36 minutes and they turned out perfect.

I made it and will try again for one reason: I think they can come out sooner because mine are crisp and will harden overnight I’m sure but recipe is simple and they taste good. I don’t own a popover tin so I used a cupcake one. Wonder if that affected how quickly they were done...

The grease and flour part didn't work.  I went back to my old directions - preheat the pan with the oven, then drop a generous pea size piece of butter in each cup before filling.  I still have to loosen a bit with a knife but most of them just pop out.  Also, when they come out of the over, poke a quarter size hole in the top to let the steam out.

Fabulously easy, did not over mix per instructions, greased and floured muffins tins, and baked for 35 min at 350' because the main dish was cooking and could not change the temp.  Everybody loved them,will make again.

We use this every year. Love it! One thing I do to help them rise is that I mix in the eggs last and make sure the milk and eggs are at room temp.  I haven't tried pre heating the pan, Ill try that next year!

I made these in a  muffin tin and added parmesan cheese, basil, and a little roasted garlic. I found the cooking time to be way too long. I cooked them for 20 minutes at 450 and none at 350 and they came out quite brown. I would shorten that to just under 20 next time. The flavor however was great.

These were easy and perfect.  Made no changes, except to the cook time, since I made 9, not 6.  18 minutes at 450, and 14 at 350.   Delicious and disappeared very, very quickly.

The popovers tasted great but the cook time was too long.  When I checked them after the 20 minutes at 450 they were done.  They were darker than I would have liked though the inside was cooked perfectly.  I would make them again but cook them at 350 from the beginning or turn it down after 10 minutes.

These are fantastic! As Christy suggests, these take a light touch in the mixing and a hot oven. Followed the recipe but added 2 TBs melted butter to mine and used a mini-popover pan (Chicago Metallic on Amazon) filling each about 2/3 full.  When they come out of the oven, be sure to poke about a 1/2" hole in the side to release the steam.

Very good recipe! The only thing I did differently the second time was adding two tablespoons of melted butter to the  batter.

This is my go to popover recipe for days of unleavened bread. I've been using it for years and my popovers come out amazing everytime! I adjust the temp to 15/15 mins instead of 20/20 because I have a very hot oven. Thank you for this recipe. It's a winner in my household!

when I made these the first time I loved them, crispy outside and moist inside, and served them buttered with dinner. Even though I loved them, there was something missing to the flavor. So the second time I made them, I added a little sugar (about 1 tbsp or so) to the batter. After they baked and I tasted them, wow, that really made a difference to my taste buds! So these taste much better with the sugar added, in my honest opinion. It balanced out the saltiness flavor of the popovers. Also, I used butter to grease the custard cups and they taste better than just using cooking oil or spray.

OMG. I just made these after years of not having them. They are just like my mother used to make for me and my father. 

They came out great. I always thought they were very hard to make. But they came out perfect. The only thing I did different was I took mine out 3 mins early cause they were done in my oven. 

I honestly give this a 10 out of 10.

The ingredient list is spot on, but I found some issues with the procedure.  I tried this recipe multiple times, experimenting with little adjustments here and there until I reached perfection.  The main issue I had with this recipe as written is the oven temperature.  For my oven, 450ºF is far too hot, and overcooked the popovers, even when reducing the heat half way through.  I found that 400º for 35 minutes, with no temperature change was just right.  

Also, as soon as the oven is preheated and reaches the proper temperature, I place the empty popover pan in the oven for a few minutes to warm it up while I combine the ingredients.  

As to the "light touch" in mixing, I never managed to make that work for me.  What really made them pop was to put all of the ingredients into a standard blender for 30 seconds.

What really needs to happen with this batter is one needs to incorporate zillions of tiny bubbles into it.  The expansion of these bubbles in the heat of the oven is essential to the dramatic rise one expects to see.  Therefore, don't even start the batter until the oven is the perfect temperature and your pan is warming.  After blending the batter, get it into the oven as soon as possible to avoid any of those tiny bubbles collapsing. 

To proceed with the blending, put all of the ingredients into the blender jar, wet ingredients first, and ending with the flour.  Gently pulse the blender a few times to get the mixing started and incorporate the flour so it doesn't

I used muffin tins, which worked fine, we just filled them up well over half-way. We used cooking spray, but my helper didn't spray the sides of the cups enough and we forgot to flour them, so the popovers were impossible to get out of the tins! We'll try again with properly greased tins.

If you are going put someone else's recipe, at least take the time to write it in your words. Exact same recipe written verbatim from Betty Crocker. Nice to share. It but don't take credit, its plagiarism. Sorry but others have right to know this.

Fabulous recipe! I used another's suggestions to be sure that eggs and milk are at (or close to) room temperature. I did not have custard cups so I used a 12-muffin muffin tin. I baked at 450 for 10 minutes and at 350 for 10 ( 8 probably would have been fine). They rose well and then, my son, husband, and I added different treats after they came out of the oven-- honey butter (me), salmon and cream cheese (husband), melted chocolate (son). Yum. Thanks for the great recipe!

Don't change a thing!  If you can follow the simplest recipe, this is even easier! Served it with a prime roast dinner, so the timing worked out perfectly! This is my new go-to for dinner bread! A little whipped honey butter and I could've made a meal of these alone!

I have been making, or should I say trying to make popovers for more than 50 years!  I have tried every pan, every recipe and every "trick" trying to mimic make popovers like a restaurant in St. Paul, MN used to make.  This recipe is the closest / best in all my attempts!  I followed to recipe.  No modifications.  A tad crispy on the outside and doughy inside.  The BEST.

Loved this recipe!  Very easy. I did alter the time as suggested by others -- 15 at the higher temp and 15 minutes at 350. I have to confess -- I made the batter the night before. I let it come to room temp before cooking and they were perfect!

I've never eaten popovers, but stumbled across this recipe.  It looked like the other photos and tasted fine, but I have nothing to compare it to.  My girls recommended adding whipped cream, which we did, then we all gave it a 5.

Amazing!  All the reviews are true!  I made these for Christmas dinner to go with a standing rib roast.  Not only were these incredibly easy, they were delicious!!   Even the finicky eaters finished the popovers -- there were none left!!  Thank you for a terrific recipe.....which has been added to my favorites!!

It could have been taller; I followed all the directions and decreased the time cooking so that they didn't burn. Something just wasn't right. I got eight popovers with great flavor and just short.

I did it! The most incredibly awesome light and fluffy rolls known to man--- it's a bit like Yorkshire Pudding. First time, made them with Chicken Marsala, but second time made with Prime Rib, a magnificent combo. I made the recipe in a muffin tin and made 11, filling the remaining cup with water. I think this a good "diet bread" as I made 11 and it's just 2 eggs, 1 cup milk and 1 cup flour for all 11! They are so rich and moist, no butter or fattening things needed. And so easy! Barely mix the ingredients and pour into muffin tin--- the second the meat comes out, the rolls go in. Recipe says 20 min plus 20 minutes lower heat, but mine were done in the first 20 minutes, beautifully golden brown--- actually done before the prime rib was ready to serve! Glorious is what I can say. Making them now for Thanksgiving!

This recipe is the same one I've been using for years. It's actually called Yorkshire Pudding and it's best served with roast beef and gravy. It's also the best when you grease the muffin pan with some of the beef drippings.

Made these popovers for the first time.  They would have won prizes.
The review tips  that I followed were very helpful:
Room temperature eggs and milk -

First time I made them and company was coming so I wasn't sure how they would turn out.  They were awesome and so glad I finally got to use my new popover pan!  Thanks for the recipe and I see many more of these in my future!

Surprisingly simple, I added 1/2 teaspoon of Vanilla Extract.  Was delicious.  Served different ways, it was still delicious.  Sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon or with a just a bit of honey or with just a bit of maple syrup, delicious.

I used extra eggs and loved the results. The popovers were picture perfect and so tasty. Made them three more times in the past week. Thanks for this fool proof recipe.

I love this recipe!  I have made it many times and have tweaked it only slightly.  This basic recipe is very easy to follow and allows for some creative varieties.  My most recent variety was adding cheddar cheese and garlic powder.  I have a couple popover pans (about $20 at Bed, Bath and Beyond) and have found that they do seem to allow for more "popover" than muffin pans or custard ramikins but those do work and they flavor is the same.  My additional suggestions are:  NEVER open the oven during baking, I do not flour my pans -only add grease and for grease I found coconut oil or clarified butter work best and lastly allow your milk and eggs to come to room temperature.  My popovers turn out perfect every time now!

These taste excellent but like some other reviewers I will reduce the initial cooking time at 450 to 15 mins and at 350 to 10 mins due to the fact that I'm using a regular muffin tin.

Change the following and you'll get a much better popover:
1. Critical: warm the milk first (30 second in a microwave)
2. Put the pan in the oven while it's preheating.
3. Put a dab of butter in each cup before adding the batter.
4. If you have it, use bread flour instead.
5. Set the oven to 425 instead of 450 for the first 20 minutes.
6. Reduce the salt slightly.

I make a larger batch (3 eggs, 1.5 cups of flour and milk, 1t salt).

Don't get me wrong, if you follow the recipe as written, you'll get something tasty, but it's not a popover.  (I made 2 batches back to back and the difference was night and day.)

Excellent popover recipe.  I do recommend preheating the pan and using room temperature ingredients.  I put a little butter in the muffin tin compartments when preheating - but be careful not to leave it in long enough to burn.  I tend to make these spur-of-the-moment, so in order to have "room temperature" ingredients I simply microwave the milk a bit to warm it, then add the eggs, etc.  Works fine.  I also adjust the temp times a bit as others have indicated - turning it to 350 sooner and not baking as long at 350 either.  Everyone's oven is a bit different so adjust if needed.

Good basic recipe. I've made these quite a few times. The popovers seem to grow taller if I heat the muffin tin first. I drop a teaspoon of salted butter at the bottom of each tin and heat until slightly browned, then quickly poor in the batter according to the recipe.. No higher than halfway. It creates a nice coating of flavor around the popover and makes them nice and light.

I really enjoyed this. I sprayed pan with Pam, floured and then melted a bit of butter in bottom of each cup in the hot oven before putting batter in. I also added some vanilla and pumpkin pie spice to the batter to add a little extra flavor.  I did 15 mins at 450 and 15 at 350 and they came out still a little more brown than I would've liked so maybe next time will decrease length at 450 a bit. Thanks!

They did not puff up.  Maybe it was my altitude.  I've made these all my life and never had a problem in PA.  I'm now in CO at 7730 ft. altitude.  I'll need to try again making adjustments for altitude.

I make these different every time I make them...but, the one thing I always make sure of doing is preheating the popover pan first at 425-450 degrees...depending on the oven for temperature. I then add a little bit of butter to the bottom of each cup and spray a little pam on the sides for easy removal of my popovers!
I also add a little vanilla for taste, it smells wonderful when baking too! 
I made Popover Cream Puffs...
You open the popover and add whip cream and sprinkle with powdered sugar! Yum! :)

Went to Jordan pond in Bar Harbor and had popovers and I loved them! I came home looking for a recipe and found this one. They are amazing! I did add butter to the muffin tin and preheated like another review recommend ed. These are amazing with homemade jam/jelly & butter with a cup of tea! Thanks!

The key to successful popovers is several things as others have noted. Preheat oven and pan, use cooking spray such as PAM on hot pan, use room temperature ingredients, and most importantly, don't over mix the batter!!! Perfect every time.

This recipe was easy to follow and to prepare . We have missed NY popovers here in Chicago. The recipe was just as those popover from Amsterdam Ave. I agree with the need to follow the recipe carefully, particularly the sequence to mix the ingredients. Now, getting fresh fruits mixed well with the butter was a bit more difficult. The popover, nonetheless were just delicious.

They turned out deflated and cooked too quickly on the outside. I have used a few other recipes calling for unsalted butter and the result was a 5-star rating. This particular recipe omits the butter and I think that may be part of the reason for my "Fail" grade. This recipe will be deleted from my list. Suggestion:  try other recipes before this one.

they were very difficult to get out of the pan. I suggest putting 1/4 tsp crisco in each cup and put in the oven while you mix the batter then pour the batter into the hot cup. I have done this in the past and they came out easier.I use a popover pan.

Great recipe. However, next time I will change the temperature to 425 degrees for the first 15 minutes and then 350 degrees for another 15 minutes. The original recipe left the top of my popovers burnt.

I've never attempted popovers before (until now) and they turned out great! I made them exactly the way the recipe was written. I didn't have popover tins, so I used ramekins, with perfect results. We ate ours with bacon and eggs. Delicious, thank you!

super simple recipe. I always add cheese to my popovers. About a cup for this recipe mixed in with the batter and it seems to sink to the bottom and give a crispy texture that pops out of the tins better. If you want you could fill this with a custard or whipped cream for desert too.

Best popover recipe ever!  Thank you so much for posting it.  Light and airy........just perfect.  I did add some chopped chives and maybe 4 tablespoons of freshly grated gruyere cheese.  I had tried another recipe I found on pinterest and they were heavy and doughy.  I will make these again and again!

This is my go-to recipe when the hubby isn't home.  He hates popovers and I love them and this recipe works great.  I follow the recipe exactly except I don't have popover forms.  I use my mini muffin pan and fill the vessels almost full and they puff up really well.  I put a dab of butter and the results are wonderful.  Thanks for a great simple recipe.

These turned out great, especially with the cinnamon honey butter recipe from this site. I did make sure to preheat my oven with the pans in, then added a pat of butter to each custard cup just before pouring the batter. I didn't bother greasing and flouring the cups. I also added some vanilla (1/2 tsp or so) as others suggested. I posted two pics attached to this recipe.

My first time making popovers was a great success. I made 2 portions and it yielded 10 massive popovers. 2 of them were so big they hit the roof of the oven and fell out of the muffin tray when I pulled it out.

I thought they were a bit heavy and doughy and so did my husband.  There's a restaurant we enjoy that has the best popovers and I was hoping for something closer to them.  We like the more airy, lighter ones.  Plus after I buttered and floured the cups, the popovers almost had a paper-like outer coating around them that was tough to eat.  I'm going to try out some other recipes to see if I find what I'm looking for.  Don't think I'd make these again, but it was a good try.

Very good recipe.  I think the bake temps and times might be a little off because mine went a little dark, but with perfect texture.  I would also increase the salt a pinch or two.

It was more like a brioche than a popover.  I think too much flour for the amount of egg.  Haven't had time to give exact amounts but I suggest that you look for a recipe with a smaller ratio of flour to egg.  It didn't pouf enough, for that reason - or another?  That said, they were totally edible, almost like a bread roll.

Love the recipe, not the bake time, I just mixed it like pancake mix, still had few lumps, it worked better in a cold oven @ 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 28 min exactly:)
yes I made it a few times, here are the pics:)

Thank you

Thanks to other Reviewers!  I left out the salt (diet restriction) and I used PAM to spray the insides and top of my muffin tin.  I also watched them closely so they came out perfectly golden, crispy on the outside.  They just didn't rise like in the picture...not sure if I mixed too long or if my oven wasn't hot enough.  It also made about 8 of them (I baked in a 6 muffin tin).  Didn't matter though.  They were still YUM!  Thank you for the recipe.  Will definitely save and make again.

These were really yummy but you must eat them out of the oven or they get spongy.I baked mine in a regular muffin tin and it made 11 popovers. Baked at 450 for 20 min. They were a little dark. Maybe could have baked them for 17 minutes. Buttered and lightly SALTED the tops after they came out of the oven. YUM!

These were very easy to make and excellent - made the cinnamon honey butter from Allrecipes too.  My husband loved them just like our favorite restaurant's. They did get done a lot faster than recipe called for but just kept my eye on them. Will defintely make again (my husband wants them tomorrow again)

This was a great recipe but I took a star off because I had to modify the cooking time. If I baked them for the indicated time they would have been blackened pieces of charcoal. I baked them at 440 (I seem to have a hot oven) for about 8 minutes and then at 350 for another 8 minutes. They turned out perfect, just like my Grandmother would make when I was little!

Very easy recipe.  Following advice of other posters I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp., let the batter sit for about half an hour, added a dab of butter to each cup, and reduced the time at 350 by 10 minutes.  Came out perfect.  Wish I had 2 pans to make a double batch!

These popovers turned out pretty yummy; they kind of tasted like french toast. I was expected the outside to be crispy, but it still tasted pretty good. You definitely have to eat them ASAP, because they start deflating outside the oven. Also, be sure to watch them after 20 min. My oven doesn't heat evenly, so I had to remove a couple golden-brown ones and let the rest bake a little longer.

Followed directions (though halved the recipe), but my popovers didn't 'pop'.   The oven I used is fairly new to me, though, so I suspect it was more to do with the baker than the recipe.  Having said all that, my little 'popovers' did taste quite delicious, they just didn't turn out like the photo.

SO easy.  Followed directions. added vanilla and cinnamon to one batch.  for the other batch added poultry seasoning.  the only negative is that these can not be made ahead.  They MUST be fresh. I think they would be great with cheese and garlic powder, but afraid they would not turn out.

I tried this recipe today.  Taste was o.k.  The cooking time stated in the directions is way too long.  The popovers were done in the first 20 minutes.  Had I left them in the oven an additional 20 minutes, they would have been burnt!  I would not use this recipe again.

These popovers were simple to make and paired nicely with smothered short ribs from this site!!  I found them to taste a little eggy and dense so I may have over stirred a bit or let them sit too long before eating.  I will definitely try them again!

Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and added 1 tablespoon of fresh thyme. The came out VERY puffed up, airy, and delicious! I suggest making a lot--I wish I had; but they're so simple I can make them any time! 5 stars!

I made these last night and they were a nice change of pace from biscuits or rolls.  They are light and airy and even my picky husband liked them. I don't have a popover pan, so I used my king cupcake pan.  My only complaint is they tasted very eggy.  I will experiment with maybe one egg and egg whites or egg substitute.  But all in all, great recipe.

I make a variation of this. Use 1c milk, 1c flour and 4 eggs. Melt one stick of butter. Put a 12 c muffin tin in 350 oven while mixing milk, flour and beaten eggs. Brush hot muffin tin with all the butter. Quickly pour batter into hot tin and put back in over for 15 minute. No peeking. Has a crusty outside and a custardy inside.

Well I thought that it was a great recipe. It worked out good but in the end i thought it needed something. I would go great for a brunch or breakfast though! You could most likely put a filling of the sorts in the middle.

Really good bread, and extremely simple to make. What more is the top creates a perfect bowl for jam. My advice when making it is to use muffin cups because the bottom really sticks to the sides, and the top blocks a knife from cutting it out.

Maybe it was my method or maybe it's just that we don't care for this kind of bread.  I used a 6 count muffin pan because that's all I had that was suitable.  They came out of the pan beautifully and looked good.  They just tasted really eggy and looked very "elastic" on the inside.  This was my first attempt at making popovers so I wasn't sure what to expect in the way of taste.  I would have thought something more moist and bread tasting.  We did eat them with the Cinnamon Butter from this site but I probably won't make them again.  Just our taste preference.

These are an old family recipe we've always loved!  Our trick is to warm up the milk slightly prior to mixing it in with the rest of the ingredients - this really helps them rise better.  We also use a blender to mix all the ingredients instead of a hand mixer.  Yum!!

This is a great popover recipe!  I have tried many through the years, and this one is one of my favorites.  I always add a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract to my popovers, and I did this recipe, too.  I also find that a preheated, greased pan makes a big difference in removing the popovers and in having a nice crisp crust.  But even without those tweaks, this is a great recipe!

Hmm, I think mine turned out right. They tasted good either way. It actually made 10 in my muffin pan. They didn't puff up as much as I expected (but I may have over stiffed them). However, they did have a neat crunchy outer coating and chewy insides. I'll make them again for sure.  They reheat excellent in the oven. I stick them on a cooling rack placed in the middle and then turned the oven to 350. Give it about 5 minutes an they're back to be crunchy and warm.

Popovers are not a South African or a Jewish food so I've never eaten one before. But I saw the resipe and picture and they looked delicious. These were fabulous! I also shortened the 2nd cooking time a bit, to 15 minutes. The only complaint I have with these is that they're best served hot, so no yummy leftovers!

Not bad.  I added powdered sugar and it reminded me of french toast.  I think I'll make again with some changes as suggested by the other reviewers and see if they come out a little better.

The end product was not a good as I had hoped for. They didn't rise very well (so, I called then Mini-Popovers)and they were very bland (yes, I added salt).

Quick, simple, and delicious. I, also, use cooking spray to grease the muffin cups, and I adjust the times to 15 minutes instead of 20.

They're good but I found them to be a bit too salty to me, next time I think I'll add a tiny bit of sugar and less salt.

I had no idea what a popover was when I came across this recipe, but I had all the ingredients on hand so I thought I would give it a try. They were really good! I think I need to shorten the cooking time by a few minutes. I don't think that has anything to do with the recipe, maybe it's because I am in Florida. I always have to shorten my baking times.

Very good, very basic recipe.  Must eat right out of the oven.  Not good when cold or cooled.  I will try another reviewers suggestion to sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.  YUM!

Absolutely fantastic!  This is the first time I have tried making popovers after having received a popover pan as a gift.  I was a little hesitant of the recipe, but followed it to a tee, and the results were fabulous.  Will make these many more time.  :)

Perfect. Works every time. As others mentioned, I warm the pan in the oven before I pour the batter, and I let the batter out until it's room temperature.

Yummy! Quick! Easy!  I made these in a muffin tin, exactly as the recipe stated.  They were fantastic.  I will make them again soon.  No need to keep looking for another popover recipe- this is perfect.

They came out really crusty and hard on the outside. Not what I'm used to w/popovers. A few had the indentation in the center...Will try again incase it's something I did.

These were okay. I've never had popovers before and I think I just don't like them, nothing against the recipe. I would prefer a roll instead of a pretty much hollow piece of bread. Sorry.

Mmmmm, aren't these tasty lil' guys! I left out the salt, tore them open, and sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar fresh out of the oven.

pretty good. i added whipped cream in the middle and they were DELISH because i find just plain popovers rather bland. cream puffs were REALLY GOOD!
