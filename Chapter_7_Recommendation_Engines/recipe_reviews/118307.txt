OK, here's the deal...I am a 38 year old mom of 3 and have ALWAYS been a Manwich junkie (don't worry, I did go to confession specifically for this in my 20's). This was even BETTER than my beloved canned Manwich sauce!  It tastes so much fresher and all of the flavors meld together so perfectly, my older son and I were in heaven over these soft white buns filled with pure yumminess.  The only thing I did differently was - aside from doubling the recipe - brown ground turkey with 1/2 a chopped onion and 2 minced garlic cloves (still added the onion and garlic powders later because we love those flavors) and added a splash of vinegar.  I had originally planned to omit the water but went ahead and added it when I saw how thick it was as I wanted it to simmer for a long while to let all the flavors "marry".  I know I'm going on and on about something so simple (I do realize we are still talking about a darn sloppy joe here) but if you knew how much I love them you'd totally understand (BTW - we don't add cheese slices, we're purists)!  These are awesome, Laurie you are a saint for submitting!!!!!!!

My mom has made this "almost exact" recipe for over 40 years. The only things that are different: add 1 teaspoon chili powder, use fresh onion and cook with the meat and add 1 teaspoon white vinegar. Don't be afraid of the vinegar, it counter balances the sweetness of the sugar and the spice of the chili powder.  I take these to potlucks and always, always, always get many requests for the recipe.

My family loves this recipe. My husband is a chef and is constantly asking me to make this. The only thing I do differently is add some hot sauce to give it a little kick. I have also found out that you don't need to simmer it for 30-40 minutes. It's fine if you simmer it for 10 minutes.

Magnificent! So easy. I doubled the recipe and made it with 1 lb. of beef. This is the perfect thing to whip up while the kids are napping and throw into the crockpot to keep warm until serving time. I think these just may be my favorite so far! Thank you!

I think this was one of the first recipes I learned to make as a child. The only difference I do is to use dry mustard powder. Great and much cheaper and less additive-filled than buying something prepared. I like them sweet but you can adjust to personal preference. If you've got it you can saute some chopped onion with the ground beef.

Delicious!  I feel bad reviewing this recipe because I made a lot of changes -- I used ground turkey and cooked that with a chopped yellow onion.  Then due to a tomato allergy I used a non-tomato ketchup which is made from carrots and beets -- due to the increased sweetness of the non-tomato based ketchup, I left out the brown sugar.  I added about 1 tbsp. of vinegar per another review and extra garlic powder.  These were the best sloppy joes we have had -- thanks for the recipe!!!
Addendum: I have made this recipe many times as stated (except my non-tomato based ketchup) and it is absolutely delicious!!!

Oh my gosh! I will NEVER eat any kind of store bought sloppy joe again. I just shared this with my mother-in-law (who has 7 children - she knows cooking). I'm SO impressed with this recipe. I did skip the mustard b/c I just don't like it. But the recipe is brilliant!

Oh my gosh this was so good! I did add a little cayenne pepper because I like a little spice. Also, we had no hamburger buns so we used hot dog buns, interesting but it worked and everybody left the table full! I WILL make it again, probably next week!

This is way better than Manwich, just the right sweetness and tangyness.  I doubled the recipe of sauce and used 1 1/2 lbs of hamburger, delicious

This was just what you described, Laurie...quick, easy and inexpensive. Thanks! We used ground turkey instead  of beef (we do that for any flavored beef dish these days. Saves a lot of fat.). We were a little low on ketchup so supplemented the difference with BBQ sauce. Also didn't have buns, as this was a last minute throw together but we had dinner rolls in the freezer and they worked great. In fact, I think my husband will prefer it that way from now on! The kids liked that it didn't have any 'yucky crunchy stuff' in it.

Good dish!

Not bad for basic sloppy joes. My suggestion is to skip the sugar especially if you don't like too sweet. The ketchup is sweet enough already and the sugar makes it too sweet.

Great reciepe but made the following changes.  After browning meat I put in the crock pot with other ingredients.  I also added shredded carrots, shredded zucchini, diced onion and green pepper. It's a great way to make the kids eat their veggies.

This was okay but not all that -- after the rave reviews, I was expecting to have my socks knocked off. Although my family of four liked it, I will keep looking for an outstanding recipe. For one thing, it was just way too sweet.

Great recipe.....love it just as is.  The second time I made this recipe, I added finely chopped onion & 1 clove of minced garlic and the family loved it even more.....just my family's preference.   This is the kind of recipe every busy Mom needs when she needs something quick....Thanks!

This was really really really good.  I doubled the recipe for 3 people but I should have tripled it, thats how good it was!  I added a splash of vinegar and thats the only change I made to the recipe.  Served on bolillo rolls YUM.

These were great!  I usually use a canned sloppy joe sauce.  This is WAY better!  I did follow others advice and cut the sugar down a bit.  Will make this again and skip the can!

My boys love sloppy joes but hardly ever get them because I don't like them.  Well that is about to changed.  Laurie, I would say you just really have a great recipe here.  Super easy to adjust for your own personal taste and what you have on hand.  I love those kind of recipes!  This time I added some smoked paprika and a little crushed red pepper flakes since the kiddo wasn't home.  Thanks, Laurie!

good, easy the kids love it what more could you ask for?? I may shred some carrots and add them into the meat mixture next time, for a veggie without the kids knowing they are eating it. I doubt it will affect the taste at all.

Love these for the flavor and the fact that I always have all the ingredients on hand. This makes a sweet and saucy home for ground beef or turkey or buffalo.  I used buffalo and we gobbled them up.

This was much too sweet for my tatste and a little bland.  Sloppy Joe mix is usually hearty and bold. I ended up having to add 2 tablespoons additional Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons light sodium soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of chili powder, a tablespoon of white vinegar, 1/2 cup of finely minced white onion and 1/2 cup of finely minced green bell pepper along with 1 tablespoon of course ground black pepper to salvage my night.
This recipe is a decent BASE but I would not rely on the base for a meal. 
I will not use this again, but do understand some who like the sweetness may find it enjoyable. It was really just a little TOO simple in it's ingredients.

This was really really good!  My only critique would be that it was just a tad too sweet for my taste.  Don't get me wrong, I ate it and enjoyed it but next time I'll use just a tad less brown sugar or add just a bit of vinegar.  Thanks for sharing!  I added left overs to muffin tins to freeze and use for later.  :)

Ok, I read a ton of reviews and the best thing anyone said about it was that it tasted exactly like what came out of a can. Think about it. It does, it tastes exactly like the junk you get out of a can. The teens loved it, meat and ketchup, come on.

I made this w/ 1.5 pds of Venison (much leaner than beef) I used 1/2 of large onion, 3 garlic cloves when browning the meat. Did not have to drain because so lean. Along with he fresh onion and garlic, also added the garlic/onion powder. I replaced beer for the water and added 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar to counter the brown sugar and spices. Turned out awesome! Will never make canned again.  Added just a touch more brown sugar as well, omit if you don't like it a little sweet.

This was delicious with a few modifications.  I used only half of the stated brown sugar, subsituted 1/4th of the ketchup with BBQ sauce and added 1 tspn of chili powder, apple cider vinegar and hot sauce.  Mmm, mmm, mmm good!

This is a good recipe.  I usually like to try recipes as they are written, but I did make a few changes to this one.  I used 2 lbs of ground beef so I upped the serving size to 8.  Instead of onion powder I added one chopped onion to the ground beef as it was browning.  I used less ketchup and increased the water so in the end I had the same amount of liquid the recipe calls for, but equal amounts of each (1 ¼  cup ketchup and 1 ¼ cup water for my serving size of 8).  I added 1 teaspoon cumin and decreased the brown sugar to 1 TB for the whole 2 lbs of ground beef I used.  I also simmered it uncovered so it would thicken.  It turned out great.

This is the rating from Jr. whom I made them for, he said "Mom, these are the most awesome Sloppy Joes EVER!" I had a wee taste and I did like the flavours melded together from the mustard, brown sugar and worcestershire sauce. Thanks for the great sammie idea!

I have made this before, and I was just searching for dinner ideas, and remembered how my family all liked this.  Its easy and I usually stick to the recipe, but I do add in a bell pepper, fresh onion instead of the powder, and I have also added thinly sliced zucchini to make sure we get some veggies.

Better than Manwich!!!! I used ground turkey, doubled the recipe and did not measure the onion/garlic powders; just dumped some of each in. Served w/ corn and buttery toasted sesame seed buns. I was getting all kinds of mmmm's during the meal. Thanks for a great recipe; I felt great about serving it!

This recipe is perfect just the way it is...I didn't change a thing. My family never cared too much for Sloppy Joes...until now. This was SO GOOD!!! Very easy to make & the ingredients are things you probably already have in your kitchen. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Laurie!!

The base for this is wonderful.  At the end, it's a bit dry and bland.  The bun will overwhelm any flavor tasting the meat alone would have.  Add another 1/4 cup ketchup, change onion powder to 1-2tsp of dried onions for fuller flavor, and a dash of garlic salt to really bring it altogether.

Even my son who says sloppy joes are "so so" gobbled it down and wanted more. I'm sodium conscious and rarely salt anything. This recipe has so much flavor (and so much sodium from everything else), you really don't need the salt. I used 1/4 of an onion when I was browning the ground beef because I didn't have onion powder.

Doubled the recipe using chopped onion instead of onion powder. Omitted salt. Thought it was a little sweet so would probably decrease the brown sugar. But an easy, tasty sloppy joe. Will make again.

It was a tad on the sweet side, which is weird for me, because I love sweet food. However, when you're saving $2 on a can of sloppy joe sauce to make this, I'll deal with it! My only change was that I added green pepper and onion, because, well, I add it in everything I eat almost :) This reminds me of the first recipe I learned from my dad, Ham BBQ...it's only missing the vinegar, which I may have to add next time I make these!

Awesome recipe! I used 2lbs of meat and adjusted all the other ingredients accordingly. I also liked the suggestion of white vinegar, so I added 1 T of that - it was fantastic. Sweet with just a bit of a kick. A keeper for sure!

Oh, my!  This really is a great one! I didn't have brown sugar and used white and it was still terrific.  I made it 2 days ago and everyone gobbled it up.  I sent the hubby for brown sugar and now I've got some more cooking. I tripled the recipe this time. hahaha.  It really is yummy!  I'll never buy the canned or packaged stuff again!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

Very good.  Quadrupled (family of 7) the recipe.  Only change I will make in the future is to add some bbq sauce instead of the brown sugar, it was a bit sweet for us.

Wow! This is the best! I rarely review, however I wanted to be sure and help the next person making a decision on Sloppy Joe night. This is the recipe to try! The only small change I made was adding 1/4 C my fav steak sauce, (Country Bobs) and 1/4 C of my fav BBQ Sauce, (Sweet Baby Rays) and only 1/2 C katsup instead of a full cup of katsup, along with a dash of hot sauce. This had everyone saying mmm mmm mmm! I had everything on hand and it was a hit! Thanks

Loved this recipe. I was worried about the sweetness factor so I used tomato sauce without sugar in place of the ketchup. Worked great! Everyone ate it right up and my youngest DS asked if we could start having this every week! Thanks Laurie!

The recipe is terrific!  For added tomato-ee-ness, I sub in tomato paste for 1/2 the ketchup.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great. As others suggested, I added 1/2 of a diced onion and a clove of minced garlic in with the ground beef - for a double batch. I also added a splash of apple cider vinegar in with the sauce. This was sweet, so if you are not a fan of sweet bbq, omit the brown sugar.

We did not care for this.  Flavor was "off".  On the up side there was just the right amount of sauce on the meat.

Very tasty! The hubby asked me to save this recipe. I made some very minor modifications based upon other reviews. I doubled the recipe, used ground turkey (it was on sale), added a dash of vinegar and a tiny bit of cayenne pepper, and added diced onion, red pepper, and yellow pepper. I topped each sandwich with a slice of mozzarella cheese. Quite tasty!

This gets five stars because it's so freaking quick and so yummy. These also make great leftovers. I make this recipe probably once every two weeks.   Also, I started using turkey meat so I toss in a minced garlic clove or two when I brown the meat to flavor it up a little and I also used stone ground mustard but that was only after I made it exactly like the recipe states.

The BEST sloppy joe ever! I double the recipe and used 99% fat free ground turkey. In attempt to clean out my frig I, threw in a few extra ingredients... sauteed 1 onion, 1 orange pepper and 2 cloves garlic with the meat; mixed in 2 tbsp tomato paste & reduced the ketchup to 1/4 cup; added a splash of Merlot & beef broth instead of water then simmered everything uncovered to allow most of the extra liquid to cook out. The finished product was AMAZING!! I will never buy the canned or seasoning packet version again.

This was very good. Per other reviewers I chopped an onion and added it to the ground beef.  I also added a dash of chilli powder and a dash of cayenne.  These were very tasty with a little zip.

Forget Manwich...these are the best!  Followed recipe exact except for adding 1/2 small minced onion to the meat after it had browned.  Very good, very easy!  Easier than opening a can of manwich sauce.

Exactly what I was looking for!  Something quick, easy, inexpensive and uses ingredients I have on hand.  Plus, something the kids liked too!  It was all of these things and I will be making this regularly.  I tripled the recipe and added a dash of vinegar and some cumin & chili powder to give it a little more spice.  I also was low on ketchup so I added a little tomato sauce and it turned out fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  I multiplied the recipe to feed 25 people for my daughter's birthday party and it was great!  I used less water than called for becuause I like the sauce a little thicker and used just a couple shakes of salt because my husband is always freaking out about how much salt is in stuff.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was fine but I would do as other reviewers have suggested and add that white wine vinegar.  I also found that the meat got very dry by simmering as long as 45 min.  The second time around with the vinegar and 10 - 20 min. of simmering, the flavor was much better.

These are the best sloppy joes that I have ever had.  I made them for a football game and everyone wanted to eat instead of watch the game!!  I did alter some of this recipe by cutting the mustard to about a half of teaspoon.  The first time I made them i followed the recipe to a "T" and the mustard was overwhelming.  I also love sweet food so I added a little more brown sugar.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have onion powder, so I just chopped up half of a medium sized onion and sauteed it with the ground beef.  I also doubled the recipe because I used a pound of ground beef, but it came out perfectly!  They are so delicious, this one is being added to my recipe book permanently!

I made two sloppy joe recipes tonight, both from this site, so I used ingredients from both recipes. Instead of water I used tomato sauce for more flavor. I liked the mustard in this. I added a diced onion (left out the onion powder) and some frozen diced green pepper. I had to put mine on a hot dog buns, because I only had two hamburger buns left, mommy always has to sacrifice! It was actually easier eating on the hot dog bun!

Loved it but added more spice and grated some veggies into the mix to up the oomph.

Great recipe! I used 2lbs of meat and 3 batches of this recipe.  Also added in a few dashes of cayenne to spice it up a little.  Great family favorite now.  See ya Manwich!

I thought it was too sweet and vinegary  but the BF loved it! He basically inhaled 2 servings before I finished one.

This was terrific!  I don't like Sloppy Joes but my family begged me to make them.  I followed advice of others and sauteed onions with the ground beef.  A dash of chili powder and cayenne gave it the right bite.  I also added vinegar.  I used extra lean beef so the water amount was just right.  Served on slider buns and they were all gone--I even had two!  I will be making these again.

These were great! i doubled the recipe and also cooked the hamburger with onion and garlic, then made as is with i tsp chile powder and 1 tsp vinegar added. Recommend cutting sugar in half. Next time i will also cook hamburger with jalapeno. Served with cheese and crispy onions, yum! Tasted a lot fresher than regular canned manwich, will be my go to recipe from now on!
UPDATE: I've been using this recipe to make a cornbread casserole- make as is, then mix up a box of jiffy brand cornbread mix and spread on top. Bake at 375 until corn bread is golden and add a sprinkle of cheddar on top. Yum!

This was an excellent start to a great sloppy joe recipe.  I made the following adjustments to make it over the top:  Added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar, 1 tbl red wine vinegar, and doubled the worchester sauce.  I also browned the hamburger with an onion and garlic.  Used homemade buns and it was perfect.  Will do it again. :-)  Thanks!

This recipe for sloppy joe sandwiches was good but not great for me. I doubled the recipe and it ended up tasting too sweet for my preference. If I were to make this again, I'd still double the recipe but keep the brown sugar the same.

Simple and tasty.  My husband thought they were a little sweet, so I may cut back on the brown sugar a little next time.  Will be making this again.

This is not the best Sloppy Joe recipe I've used, but it's good  for a quick meal and especially good for those who don't like chopped onions, chopped green peppers, etc. in their sloppy joes.  Sometimes I use  a little BBQ sauce for a different flavor. Thanks for sharing. I'll use this often.

This is a very good classic sloppy joe recipe, although it is not very healthy.  It can be made a little better by adding chopped veggies (ie green peppers, carrots, celery).  Also, the serving portions are a little off - this easily serves a family of four, but I guess it depends on how big your servings are.

I was so happy I tried this recipe. I love that I wasn't using the canned stuff and I could also variate the recipe to my personal taste. The only thing I didn't like was that I used a lot of ketchup, which is almost like gold in our house. Will definitely make again.

Why buy canned sloppy joe mix with this recipe on hand.  I had to quadruple it from the 2 serving size LOL but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  Tasty and easy and everybody always has all of these ingredients on hand.  Going into my personal favorites with this one!  Thanks!

LOVE! This is a recipe I will make again and again. I added a couple ingredients just for my personal taste (onion, garlic and a splash of vinegar) but even written as is this is a great recipe. I tried it both with and without pepperjack cheese. Both ways are pretty awesome. I love this recipe so much that I plan on making it again tomorrow!

I loved this recipe. I found this to be so easy to make and it was delicious! I made just as the recipe was written. The sweetness was just right and consistency of the sauce perfect. Kids ate them up! Next time, I will add a little vidalia onion and chopped green pepper. Didn't do so this time as kids don't like onions n peppers.

I changed the recipe, like others I used only 1 tsp of chili powder which gave it just the right amount of kick and I only added 1 tsp of black pepper....I increased the vinegar to 2 tablespoons too...To make it more of authentic sloppy joe sandwich I added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, 1 tsp of mustard and a couple shakes of worcestshire sauce.    With the changes I made,  it was truly a delicious hearty sandwich that me and my husband enjoyed.  Should be even better tomorrow

This was a great recipe! My family is trying to omit using beef so I used ground chicken. I did the recipe exactly as it said and it came out great. We didn't have any bread so I put it over some brown rice and it was good that way. Next time I will brown the meat with chopped on onions and peppers.

This recipes is great! I followed the advice the other reviewers and added vinegar and chilli powder. But I have always liked the flavor of bell pepper in my sloppy joes so if you do too, add half a bell pepper also and see how you like it!

My husband is not a big fan of processed food due to the salt content.   This was a big hit for him.  I use half lean ground meat and half venison.  Since I work I throw all the ingerdients in the crock pot and it's done when I get home.  Since I use 90%lean ground beef and venison is very  lean I don't have to worry about precooking the meat and draining off the fat.

This is a keeper.

My boyfriend LOVED the sauce for these sloppy joes! He is a picky eater, so this is a huge compliment. I thought the sauce was slightly too sweet, so I added about a teaspoon more Worcestershire sauce and mustard after simmering for 30 minutes. I also doubled the recipe, which yielded 4 sloppy joe sandwiches and 1 sloppy joe hot dog.

Thanks for the recipe!!!  I fixed it for my husband and he  loved it! He said it tasted better than the manwich meal in a can.  I only changed a few things like  I substituted the brown sugar for splenda (because my husband is diabetic) and I omitted the worcestershire sauce and mustard because my husband doesn't like it.  Instead I added my own seasonings to it and took the advice of some of the other raters and added some chili powder to it.  It came out great.  Thanks again for a great recipe!!!

I made this with vegetarian ground "beef" because my husband is on a vegetarian kick.  We thought it was quite good but I liked it better without the brown sugar.  I didn't simmer mine at all, just cooked it long enough to heat the sauce through (didn't add the water since it wouldn't have a chance to cook off).  Also my husband accidentally brought home hot dog buns instead of hamburger buns and it turns out sloppy joes are easier to eat in hot dog buns!  Will definitely make again!

I originally made this recipe for my husband, who loves sloppy joes. I do not share his love of sloppy joes, or I should say, I did not share it. I actually liked sloppy joes made this way rather than the canned stuff you buy at the grocery store. I follow the recipe exactly and find it almost as easy to make the sauce myself as it is to pour it out of a can. Ill never buy canned sauce again. Thank you for the recipe.

I was tired of the ketchup and bbq sauce recipe I grew up on, so I looked for something different.  This was absolutely delicious!  I added more mustard and additional Worcestershire sauce because it was too sweet for me.  I think I will back down the brown sugar next time.

My family loves this sloppy joe recipe. I get requests to make this on a weekly basis. I quadruple this recipe as I have two teenage boys who eat like it's their last meal on this earth. No more Manwich for us. Thank you for this fabulous, simple, and delicious recipe.

Love this! The only changes I made were to use ground turkey because that is what I had and I did not add any sugar (we try not to add sugar to anything ever because there is already plenty sugar in most things - even canned beans!). This was so fast, simple and fabulous!! It is going into the rotation of meals. Such a perfect comfort food for a snowy spring day.

I love sloppy joes and these were really good.  I think this is my new recipe.  I followed the recipe except I did add some green peppers (not because I thought it needed it, but because I love the flavor green pepper gives) and I did not add all of the salt called for.

I am not one to like jarred sloppy joe sauce and refuse to buy it.  I have tried a few recipes for sloppy joes and have been disappointed. They usually have tomato paste, which I am not a fan of, or include vinegar. To me vinegar ruins a sloppy joe. This recipe did not dissapoint. The only change I made was to the ketchup. I used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 our favorite barbeque sauce (Bull's Eye). I especially like that it does not call for onions and peppers (hubby won't eat 'em) and still had excellent flavor. This recipe is delicious. Definitely a keeper. Thanks Laurie Hauser!

Super easy and delicious - these words seldom go together!  I procrastinated going to the grocery store and wanted to whip something up from my somewhat bare cupboards - I was out of Worchester sauce -  very concerning, so I substituted 4-5 dashes Frank’s hot sauce and 4-5 dashes liquid smoke to a doubled recipe (be careful with liquid smoke – a dab will do ya).  I added two minced garlic cloves and ¼c dry onions (let them soak in water to reabsorb moisture for 3-4 minutes prior to adding) to the ground beef while browning.  I used all the other seasonings including the garlic and onion.  This was so tasty my husband ate what was left on my plate!  What a find; I know this recipe will be a staple in my house.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Didn't even need to go to the grocery store for this great dinner, yay! Substituted 1/4 fresh onion and 1 clove garlic. Also added 1/2 tsp chili powder and white wine vinegar. Toasted the buns in a toaster to make them crunchy and counterbalance the sloppy...

I scaled this recipe to 64 servings to feed a crowd for a church cookout.  I left out the water, and it was perfect!  Kept it warm in a counter top roaster.  Lots left over, but it freezes great!

We don't really eat meat in our house so I subbed the ground beef for faux ground "meat" & I (nor the boyfriend) could taste the difference. Tasty stuff! Next time I'm going to try using lentils in place of the "meat". Thanks for a fabulously easy i'm too lazy to cook meal!

I think canned manwich is better!  This is not a bad recipe, but if I am going to make something myself I want it to be better than the canned version.  There is better sloppy joe recipes on this website.

WAY to sweet. Tasted mostly like ketchup and I had to really work with a few different spices and added onions to get a better flavor. Husband and daughter didn't like this however my son ate 3. Will probably find another recipe we can all enjoy next time.

Super easy and delicious.  I misread the directions and added 1 1/2 cups of water (scaled up to make 6 was supposed to be 1/4c plus 2 tbsp).  I thought, "That doesn't look right."  So I left it uncovered and brought it to a low boil to let the water evaporate and then put the lid on and turned it off.  May just do that again because it tasted great and was ready about 20-30 minutes faster.  Whole family loved it!

I followed the recipe, and it was very good! I did add a small onion and half a green pepper to my ground beef when cooking. I did double everything except for the ground beef, when making for just hubby and I. I found there wasn't enough sauce for us. This is for sure "sweeter" than the canned sauces. I read most of the reviews, and we didn't think this was any better or worst then canned mix. I think it cost about the same, and actually when Manwich is on sale, it's cheaper to just use that. For us, we'll stick with the canned version, but this was easy to make.

good recipe - a little on the sweeter side than I would prefer. Next time I will cut the brown sugar in half.

Maybe I made this wrong, but the sauce was too dry for me, unlike the manwich stuff.  I will try adding more liquid ingredients next time.

The last reviewer must have done something wrong because this was great!  The only changes I made was I used real onion (minced) and added one teaspoon of white vinegar.  I thought it was great and so did my family.

Easy and delicious. I sauteed onions with the hamburger and added a few grains of cayenne to the sauce~~otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  Served on bulkie rolls with oven fried potatoes (from this site) and corn on the cob.  A great Saturday night meal that everyone loved.

Good; maybe a little too sweet. My husband, who isn't a big fan of sloppy joes, said it was too 'ketchupy'.

Quick and easy for sure!  We actually put this over a bed of noodles, added some jalapenos, sour cream, crushed red peppers and cheddar cheese.  Has a wonderful BBQ flavor to it!

This recipe was really quick and easy and I couldn't believe I had all the ingredients on hand!  I will definitely use it again.  I had to triple it for my family.  I also adapted it (of course) by adding yellow onion to the beef & omitting the onion powder, using 2/3 tomato sauce and 1/3 ketchup instead of ketchup only and omitted the water, which allowed me to simmer the full 30 minutes. I also added fresh cracked black pepper to each layer and a dash of Franks Hot sauce (okay, maybe 2 dashes, but it could've used 3).  I mixed all the sauce ingredients together and tasted it then altered with a little more mustard and an extra splash of Worchestershire sauce prior to mixing it with the beef. My initial measurements MAY have been a little off too since I am not big on EXACT measurements.  Next time I will throw in some diced up green pepper with the beef. Family agreed that it needs it, but it was still good.  Will keep this one in my recipe box!

This is the best sloppy joe recipe I have made from scratch.  My family loved them, and we had the leftovers the next day for lunch and they were even better.  I was out of ketchup so I used a can of rotel tomatoes and tomato paste to make a "ketchup" and they were really good this way.  Because of the rotel, there were chunks of tomatoes, which I liked and they had a little spice to them which is always nice.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

It was ok. Too sweet for my husband and I, and we used tomato sauce instead of ketchup and only half of the sugar to prevent that. I will not make it again.

I needed something quick for dinner tonight to make with ground beef (all I had in the fridge). We haven't had it on rolls yet because it's still simmering in the pan but I've been sampling it for the past half hour and it tastes great!  I had to change up the measurments for a serving of 6 and it didn't lose anything in the process.  I have never had Sloppy Joe's before because I thought wouldn't like it.  I am so happy I found something new to make!  Will definitely make again.

Loved these - my first time ever making homemade sloppy joes (not from a can or a packet) and WOW! So easy, and so good! Ate the leftovers the next day - husband and mom gobbled them up! I did use half a real onion and some minced garlic instead of the spices - will make this again and again.

This one was a good, and easy recipe.  I picked it for my 14 yr. old cook night.  We doubled the recipe and went a little heavier on the garlic powder and salt.  We also added about 3 tbs. bbq sauce.  It will be made time & again.

This was ok to good with a few alterations.  To the meat I added one minced onion and a couple cloves of garlic.  It brings a better flavor to this recipe.  It's a bit heavy on the ketchup and next time I'll probably sub a little tomato sauce in it's place.

Surprisingly good!
I was looking for a quick and easy sloppy joe recipe that didn't require a trip to the grocery store, since we didn't have any fresh veggies in the house.  This throws together in a snap, smells great, and tastes even better.  Brings back memories of my childhood!  I did cut back a tiny bit on the ketchup, but it was still delicious.
I highly, highly recommend this recipe, and that is something I don't do often!

This sloppy joe recipe is SO GOOD!  I love that it is tangy, but not too sweet, zesty but not spicy.  I like that it did not include green bell pepper, which is just a preference in MY opinion.  I'm glad I didn't rush it and let the sauce simmer as directed because it made for the perfect not-too-sloppy consistancy.  This is YUM-O to the max.  My 13 year old gobbled it up with two buns and then ate the last little spoonful just with fork and plate lol.  This will go on my list of 'what to make' for sure and it's super easy to pull together..it was a finger foods dinner (with forks just to pick up any stray-runaway bites of sloppy joe) with the sloppies on the buns and carrots sticks!  Again YUM-O!

These were so easy and really tasty. I doubled the recipe overall but halved the ketchup and subbed in tomato paste and tomato sauce to cut down on the tangy taste.

Very good!  I'm a vegetarian, so I simply replaced the meat with brown rice and kidney beans.  It's very good!  Try adding some chili powder.  It adds a lot!

I cut the brown sugar in half, since the ketchup is already sweet, and it was PERFECT. I also cooked half a chopped yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic in with the ground beef until browned.

Search no more for the perfect Sloppy Joe sandwich, this is it!  I always have the ingredients for this on hand, so simple and my whole family agrees this recipe is the best!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was a great balance of flavors...the Worcestershire sauce really adds great taste and depth of flavor!

So I had an abundance of ground beef this past spring and was trying to figure out what to do with it and sloppy joe's came to mind. I asked my hubby what he thought and he was appalled. So I made em anyways (cuz that's how I roll.) Him complaining the whole time saying that he wasn't going to try them and blah blah blah. Well Itricked him into trying one and well lets just say his opinion changed real fast! Now he requests them all the time! MEN!

Excellent! My very picky children loved it - and so did I! Very easy, I did also add a bit of vinegar, as others suggested. Perfect and inexpensive family meal.

This was very easy to make. The only thing I would change is to eliminate the mustard. It made it a little too tangy for the kids and I. But I will definitely give this another shot.

This was awesome, except...... Does anyone else think ketchup is way too sweet?! I added the brown sugar anyway, even though I knew that I always think ketchup is too sweet... And I was sorry. It added just enough to be WAY TOO sweet! Next time I will omit the sugar and water (it ended up being just a bit too runny) and I think it will be yummy perfection!

I seasoned the meat to my liking before cooking, mainly out of habit, and added a little more of the seasoning required when asked for, but this is definitely a keeper.

I was prepared for the recipe to be on the sweeter side, based on the other reviews, and it definitely is, but if you like a sweeter Sloppy Joe then this one's for you!  My whole family really enjoyed this; I served it over macaroni instead of on buns this time.

I have a recipe I have used for years but lately felt it was a bit bland and wanted something closer to Manwich. This is close but WAY TOO SWEET!!!! The sweetness was completely overpowering making it difficult to even finish eating it.  I double checked the measurement wondering if read wrong but I did not - I used what it called for. Then I checked reviews again wondering if people were mentioning the sugar thing...to my surprise I found nothing but "touch of sweetness' and 'perfect sweetness" comments.  Clearly I completely disagree, but apparently I am in the minority.  I made no changes to recipe except to add finely diced onion and green pepper. I gave it three stars because it was easy to make, and if the sugar was scaled back it I think it would be much better.  There was a hint of a 'vinegary' type flavor I didn't care for but I will have to make it again with the sugar adjusted and go from there.

Tasted great--it's possible it may be even better with onions, but this way the kids are not complaining about onions and I don't taste any lack thereof myself.

These were great!  I doubled the recipe, and I didn't have brown sugar, so I used honey. I had this prepared with some steamed veggies in 20 min!  I couldn't ask for a better weeknight meal.

Awesome recipe!  Like some other posters I added the chili powder and vinegar.  I also used ground mustard rather than prepared.  To feed my family I made 2 pounds and added garlic and onion while I browned the meat.  Family loves when I make this!

SOOO good! I was skeptical about it tasting like Manwich (which I love), but this recipe really does! I added a splash of vinegar as others suggested, and I used dry mustard instead of prepared mustard... otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This recipe is awesome, we'll be using this from now on... no more Manwich for us!

I am not a huge fan of sloppy joes but really do enjoy this recipe.  I try to follow recipes exact but always end up tweaking them by using some ingredients I favor in recipes.  I used chopped onion & 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the powders.  At the advise of others I added a dash of vinegar to cut the sweetness flavor.  Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe, only doubling it.  It was good and does mimick the manwich brand taste.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Fantastic!!  I have always loved Manwich but now I'll save the money and make it from scratch by using this recipe.  It tasted a lot better than the stuff in the can and there's not a bite of it left for sandwiches tomorrow--which is the only downfall of this recipe. :)

That was really good, might actually get me away from the pre-made stuff. we usually add a little bbq sauce, but this didn't need it.

I made this for a football game once and I got so many compliments! I had to send the recipe to multiple people. I kept it in my crockpot so it would stay warm and made it ahead of time. Great combination!! So easy too!

Excellent!! Other than doubling it, I made this recipe as is. My husband loved it. Although it tastes good as it is, I may take some of the other reviewers suggestion and add a diced onion, maybe a green pepper, just to give it a little extra flavoring. Definite keeper.

This was a huge hit in our house and so easy to make. I doubled the recipe for the 4 of us and it was the perfect amount. I served the meat mixture in hot dog buns instead of hamburger buns and they were much easier for our 5 yr old and 3 yr old to eat. My 3 year old took one bite and said Mmmm yummy! This recipe will be used over and over in our house.

Edited: Quadrupled for 7 of us, this was enough food. Mixed half with green peppers and half without. Halved the sugar, my husband said it's still a little too sweet. .... Tripled this for 6 people (4 kids and 2 adults), next time I'll quadruple. This used almost 3/4 a bottle of ketchup. Added garlic and vinegar per the top reviewer. Added 1/2 a bell pepper sliced thick. My husband said it was a little sweet so I'll cut back the sugar next time but he said it was Very good, thank you!

Favorite! I added an onion to the meat and doubled the recipe. Also added 4 dashes of Tabasco to the sauce mix. It was so fast to make and so good. All the flavors and slightly sweet tanginess were a huge hit in my house.

Super Easy, had everything on hand including cooked crumbled beef, (I always double what I am browning ground beef for and freeze half for a quick dinner). I did add one small diced and sauted onion and green pepper. I tripled everything and served over mashed potatoes. Hubby and picky 14 year old raved! Thanks!

I doubled the recipe and added onions because I just love onions. The longer the sauce simmered, the thicker the sauce got, so take the time and do it.
My husband was drooling over this recipe. He said it was the best "manwich" he's EVER had. Guess this is a keeper.

I was quite dismayed when I started browning my ground beef and discovered I had no Manwich. I checked allrecipes.com (which I do quite often) for a recipe and found this one. I had 2 lbs of ground beef and not quite 2 c of ketchup, but I used all that I had. All other ingredients were adjusted as needed with no other diversions. It was a tad bit on the sweet size; although I always add a little brown sugar when using Manwich. Anyway, this was very, very, very good and I will definitely use this recipe moving forward and cut back a little on the brown sugar. Don't knock it until you've tried it. This definitely a keeper!!!

I questioned this recipe but it was one of the few that didn't have green or red peppers.  It is GREAT! Perfect blend of sweet and tangy.  I didn't have onion powder so I used dried minced onions.  I will make this again as my husband gave it 2 thumbs up!!

I did add onion since I was already making my old sloppy joe recipe before I decided to try something new for a change. This was similar to my recipe but a little more stuff in it. I enjoyed the flavorful sauce with just a touch of sweetness. I did 4x the recipe using 2 lbs of gr beef and I didn't time it but think I only cooked it for about 15 min. 
Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

Really easy and tastes great! I have made this many times now and it is very forgiving if you need to make changes. I used tomato paste one time when I didn't have enough ketchup. Honey mustard instead regular mustard.  I add real onion and cooked carrots chopped fine in a food processer and it is undectable to my family including my very picky 3yr old. Thank you!

This is a fantastic recipe!! I did make a few changes though and I believe it helped.  Before browning the meat I sauteed some onions and fresh minced garlic then added the meat. When making the remainder I added a Tbsp of Vinegar and some hot sauce.  It was so excellent.  The bf loved them.  I could have added a little more tomato to it - like maybe a bit of paste, for my taste.  Oh, we also added just a little green pepper! 
Very good!

This recipe is awesome, we use it all the time.  The only substitution I make is to use minced garlic that I cook up with the ground beef instead of onion powder.  And that is because I usually have minced onion in the house but not onion powder.

This recipe came out very tasty.  I followed the recipe as written except omitted the onion powder because I did not have any.  I felt the flavor was fantastic and will make this often!

This is a keeper.  I like my sloppy joes to be simple and sweet and this was both.  I used lean ground turkey burger because I prefer it over beef and added some chopped onion and fresh garlic to the meat while it cooked.  My family enjoyed these tasty sandwiches.  There wasn't much left over.  I suggest doubling the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

My husband LOVED these.  He was so disappointed when the grocery store was out of his favorite can of all-natural sloppy joe mix, but he said we don't need to ever buy that again.  I didn't have worcestershire, but my mom always used to use vinegar in her taverns and that seemed to work just great!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I think it's an awesome base recipe. I added a few things and took out the water. I only used half the ketshup plus one small can of tomato sauce, added some red wine vinegar, a bit of hot sauce, and a chopped onion and red pepper. My family LOVED it and everyone had seconds.

This was delish!!  I love sloppy joes, but my husband can't stand Manwich because it's too sweet and tastes "canned".  This was the perfect recipe!  I used Dijon and doubled the amount of the mustard to make it a little more tangy for him.  No leftovers!!  :)

Wow, just wow. I and my 6 kids LOVED this recipe. I did add an extra 3TBSP brown sugar, but that was just cause I wanted too. It tasted great without it, but I think better with it. Excellent!!!!

Delicious!  I don't like peppers, so I chose this recipe over the one with higher reviews and I am so happy I did.  I did use real garlic and onion... added a squirt of BBQ sauce for some extra depth, but kept everything else the same.  Cooked it up on the stovetop, threw it in a Crock Pot and let it simmer for a few hours.  (Perfect to prepare mid-day and then have ready for dinner!)...  What a great way to bring back childhood without using a packet or a can!

I doubled this recipe, used ground turkey, half ketchup/half BBQ sauce and before adding the sauce ingredients, I sauteed a little chopped onion and minced garlic in a tablespoon of butter. My family ate every bit of this.

I was really happy with this recipe. I didn't feel like cooking & wanted something simple. I've used more complex sloppy joe recipes before & haven't like them as much as this one. I forgot the salt, but with the amount of salt in ketchup, I figured I wouldn't miss it & I didn't. I did also add maybe a 1/4 cup of bbq sauce to a doubled recipe.
**My boyfriend doesn't like sweet sloppy joes but he loves this recipe because I have been adding pepper, bbq sauce, vinegar & a little A1 just to take away from the sweetness. I love the recipe no matter what adjustments I make, it's always yummy!

Delicious!  I won't bother trying any other recipes. Made it again, just as good with ground turkey and better with sauteed onion and garlic.  We divided the pot and added a diced jalapeno to half of it...MMM!

Great recipe!  Our whole family really enjoyed.  I doubled the recipes and got 8 sandwiches.  I used the cheap hamburger rolls from the packaged bread section.  Put the rolls on the cookie sheet and opened them up.  Filled them with the sloppy joe and topped with a pile of shredded cheddar cheese.  Baked at 450 degrees for 3-5 minutes.  Delicious!

This recipe is awesome. Made it today to take to family reunion. Everybody loved it. My husband told me not to lose this recipe. My husband is an avid hunter, so instead of using ground beef, I used ground mule deer and ground antelope. Thanks for this great recipe. *update* I made this again today for a funeral. I made it to yield 12 servings. Although the recipe said to use 3 lbs. of ground beef I used 5 lbs. Only because I thought it was too soupy for 3 lbs. Turned out perfect. I made it as it said then put it in the crockpot on low.

These were pretty good. VERY easy to make and the kids love them! I gave it 4 stars cause it was super sweet. I think it needed some onion or bell pepper to balance it out. Will try that next time!

It was okay.  I doubled the recipe to make 4 servings.  I also added chopped onions, chili powder, and used ground mustard instead of regular.  I cut back the brown sugar in half and was glad I did...it was still a little sweet.

Stuck fairly close to the recipe with a few small changes.  Doubled all ingredients except brown sugar.  Added 1 tsp. balsamic vinegar and 1/2 c. chopped onion and one clove of garlic.  Also omitted the onion powder.  Rich, tangy & hearty sandwiches.  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good. I was a little short on ketchup, but the sloppiness was still sufficient. I did end up adding a bit more Worcestershire sauce, to suit my tastes.

This is great! Even better the second day though I did forget the mustard! I am the only one in my family of 3 boys and a husband who even enjoys a sloppy joe but this was a hit with the family, and I am making it again! Easy too so five stars for preparation along with taste!

This made a great tasting sauce.  I omitted the water completely and instead added a tsp of apple cider vinegar to give it a bit of kick.  I just headed the sauce through and added my meat.  I used shredded beef instead of ground beef.  It was delicious!

Adjusted the servings to 5 since I had 1.3 lbs ground turkey.  Used ~1 part bbq sauce to ~3 parts ketchup since some reviews said it was too "ketchupy," and neither I nor the fiance like ketchup.  Sauteed the ground beef with 1 med. onion (diced), 1 green pepper (seeded and diced), and ~2 Tbl. minced garlic.  Used mustard powder instead of prepared mustard, and just kind of eyeballed it on the spices.  Also added some chili powder and some cider vinegar.  End result was a delicious meal, although a little more "bbq-y" than I tend to think of for sloppy joes.  Next time, I'll just use straight ketchup!

Very tasty and very easy but maybe just a bit sweet.  I needed 20 servings so I used the "multiplier" to give me the quantities I would need and I wonder if maybe I wouldn't have needed that much brown sugar.  Things don't always come out the same when multiplying recipes and next time I'll cut back a little bit on it.  But I definitely will be making it again.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!  Following the other recommendations, I did half ketchup/half barbecue sauce, added 1 tsp. vinegar, quick oats to thicken and sauteed the meat with onions and garlic (not omitting the garlic & onion powder.)  Total kid pleaser (excluding the 3 year old who is currently not pleased with anyone.)  Definitely going to make a bigger batch to freeze some next time.

I dove headlong into this recipe. I doubled it, and realized I didn't have enough ketchup; spaghetti sauce rounded out the rest, probably a half and half mix. I had no brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce. or salt, but had everything else. I used spicy brown mustard. and simmered it just for 10 minutes, and it came out awesome.

I've never had Manwich because I hate onions with a passion, so I gave this recipe a chance last night and it was delicious.  I put a slice of provolone cheese to each sandwich and it was incredible, sorry if I offended any Manwich fans out there.  ;)  One thing though, I found it to be a bit salty so I'll skip that next time.  This one's a keeeeeeper!

Being a Manwich lover, and I didn't have any on hand, I thought I'd give this one a whirl.  They were a little too sweet, but still very tasty!  Another review added vinegar, so I think next time I'll try that.  I will be making these again!

I doubled the recipe so I could use my 1 lb of beef.  The sauce ended up being a little sugary tasting after doubling it, so I added a little extra vinegar and threw in some chilli powder to distract from the sweetness.  Great recipe.  My boyfriend loved it, and my coworker and her husband also loved it!  Will make again!

These were awesome! My husband does not really care for Sloppy Joes because they are too tomatoie, but this was a winner. I did use ground turkey and added a little diced onion in while I brown the meat. YummO! Will make often :)

This is great with ground turkey, for a healthier version! Kids loved it. I added half a roll of leftover breakfast sausage, then used my potato masher to crumble the mixture into smaller bits. Served on wheat buns. DS & DD both loved it!

How can anything this simple taste so good? I don't know. I doubled the recipe and around here that made 6 sandwiches. Next time I will make this in the crock pot to simmer all day. You really should try this one. This one's a keeper!

This recipe is ok, but a couple of changes need to be made. First, not as much sugar!!! And you need to add a little hot sauce. I think next time I will take the advice of chopping some onion with garlic to begin with. I will try to make this again.

My son LOVES this recipe. I use dried onion flakes instead of powder.  I have never been a Sloppy Joe fan but I'll eat this with the family anyday.

I am NOT a sloppy joe type of person, but my kids love them. Normally I just make the name brand kind bought at the store, but since I discovered allrecipes.com I've tried making the majority of foods from scratch. These were FABULOUS! Even I went back for seconds! The only thing I did differently was add an onion and a few cloves of garlic (diced) to the meat as it was browning and a splash of vinegar with the ketchup mix. Absolutely perfect. I served over garlic toast with a fork to help keep the messiness down. Superb! I will definitely be making these again!

Doubled the recipe and followed it exactly.  Am planning on serving it with home-made wheat hamburger buns, but if I keep tasting it as it simmers, there won't be any left for supper!

This is a good go-to recipe.  It seems awfully sweet to me, and I didn't even add the sugar.  I think the fault may lie with my store-brand ketchup.  So, my only advice to others would be to wait on adding the sugar until you taste all the other flavors together.

This was good but a little sweet. I still prefer the ones that I make out of the little packet with tomatoe paste. But nice to know you could whip them up with the ingreedents you already have in the house

This was very good and easy to make! Only change i made is: I used ground turkey instead of the beef, also added 1/4 cup of chopped onion as others had suggested.  Very good and my hubby didn't miss the beef at all.

This is outstanding!  As another reviewer suggested, I added about 1/4 cup chopped onion to the ground beef as it browned.  I also added a tsp. of minced garlic and a splash of vinegar.  This was THE BEST sloppy joe sandwich we have ever eaten!  Thank you for sharing your delicious recipe, Laurie!

Love this recipe.  Added the fresh onion and garlic while browning in addition to the powdered as another review suggested.  Best sloppy joe I have made yet and probably won't ever try another recipe.  This is the one for me!

Very yummy.  However, I cooked 1/2 chopped fresh onion with chopped clove garlic in olive oil.  Then added ground turkey browned.  Then added the rest of the ingredients with a little vinegar as previous reviewer stated.  I also added a little more brown sugar.  Everyone loved it!

these were fabulous. The only comment my incredibly picky husband made was that i could do w/o the sugar altogether. It was SOOOOO much better than a can of the stuff we tried a couple of weeks before. A definite winner!

This is definitely the best kid-friendly Sloppy Joe recipe. I literally used to strain the store bought canned sauce becasue my daughter refuses to eat if she detects anything crunchy in the mix.   I used half tomato sauce & half ketchup and gorund turkey.  Thanks for a MUCH better alternative to canned mixes.

This was such an AWESOME recipe and it isn't anything different from what you already have in your cupboard. We used this as a last minute meal choice and I am so happy we did. This is a keeper. Much better than any canned mix you would buy at the grocery store and super simple and fast to put together. We actually did make a change to the recipe, we used ground turkey instead of ground beef.

This was the best sloppy joe recipe ever!  I wasn't sure if my husband would like it because it was so sweet, so I added a bit of red pepper flakes to it for some kick!  It was great.  Sweet but spicy as well. It went over very well with the family and it freezes well too!

Mmm...these are the best sloppy joes that I have ever made. They are sweet and tangy. The sauce is very thick and rich. I added a little cayenne pepper because we like spicy food. I will be cooking these up often.

These were so good-my husband is not a Manwich fan since there are peppers in it so this was perfect!  Just the right amount of sweet, I did add a few shots of hot sauce and used ground turkey-Yum!

This was so good even my son, who is incredibly picky, ate a full plate full. This is the new sloppy joe standby.

These Sloppy Joes were *PERFECT* for my family. My husband hates the "bits" (i.e.-onion and bell pepper chunks) that I usually enjoy, but loves the flavor they bring. This way we can both enjoy these! I doubled the recipe for my family and Hubby went back for seconds! Excellent!

This recipe was wonderful! I made a few modifications and the end result was delightful. I used ground turkey instead of beef and added dried minced onion and minced garlic. I put sliced dill pickles,shredded cheddar and a little mustard on my sloppies before eating. Yummy!

After using numerous sloppy joe recipes, this is the one that seems to satisfy all of my family members. My husband does not like sloppy joes that have vinegar or "sour" taste. These fit the bill -- he was happy, and our children liked them as well.

This was a great basis/starter for sloppy joe. I did a little tweaking though: I used chopped onion and also chopped green pepper and browned it w/ lowfat turkey burger, doubled the recipe and kept the sauce the same except omitting the onion powder since I used whole onion. It was great and I will definately make again, thanks! :)

Oh my gosh... I'm not a big fan of sloppy joes, but this recipe was so easy it's silly.  I was looking for a recipe that didn't require tomato sauce (I usually don't have it on hand as I make my own sauce from scratch).  The flavor of this was great and it turned out just like I remember them!  I added a little more garlic (because you can never have enough) but other than that, stuck to the recipe.  Fantastic!

Our dept. at work had a fundraiser lunch and I needed to make 25 lbs of Sloppy Joe.  I used this recipe because it contained the same ingredients that mine had, only I needed to adjust the amounts to serve 100 people.  Everyone LOVED it...we made over $500.00 in less than 2 hours.  Several wanted a copy of the recipe, so I'll taper it back down to serve 8 and print it out!

WONDERFUL!! This is a great recipe because it is made with ingredients that are always in my pantry.  We won't be buying the canned stuff anymore! The only changes that I made were to cut the amount of brown sugar in half and add some chopped onion when cooking the ground beef.

A little too sweet, even for my kids, but one of the better ones I've tried in a long time. Next time I'll cut back a little on the brown sugar and ketchup.

Yummy!  I made this in the slow cooker!  I used one pkg of lean ground turkey, tripled the rest of the ingredients and added 1 small chopped onion and a tbs of chopped garlic.  I added only 4 tbs of water.  Put everything (cooked turkey) in the slow cooker on low for about 4 hrs.  SOooooooo good and easy!

This recipe turned out very good. I can't give it 5 stars because there were changes made to prepare it. When I made the recipe, I used 1 lb beef, so all ingredients were doubled. I added about 1/2 cup extra ketchup and about 1/4 cup extra water. I used minced onions, and doubled the amount that was called for. Next time, I will not use as much Worcestershire as called for. I did not have any brown sugar, so i sub this with about 2 TB of granulated sugar.

Like the other reviewers, I too was a Manwich junkie.  This recipe turned me around!  The recipe really is not much more difficult than opening a can and it was so much tastier!  I added chopped green peppers and onions to the beef as it was browning.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  This one's a keeper.  Thank you!!!

I am not at al a fan of the sloppy joe, but my husband is.  I promised that I would make them for him this week.  Dreading the process I found this recipe.  It was so good.  The flavors were fantastic.  I now love the sloppy joe.  This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing! YUM!

I really liked this recipe because 1.  I had the majority of the ingredients on hand 2. It was super, super easy and 3. The boyfriend has been begging for sloppy joes for a month and this finally made him stop :)  Seriously though, I don't like sloppy joes and I liked this recipe.  I added onion and garlic on the suggestion of some others and I felt that really kicked up the flavor.  I also used part chili sauce in place of some of the ketchup.  I didn't let it simmer as long as the recipe states, but I thought it came together nicely.  I paired it with baked french fries and had dinner on the table in no time!

I thought this recipe was ok ... the sloppy joe taste was definitely there, but it was way too sweet for my taste. I will probably make it again, but I'm going to leave out the brown sugar entirely, and use 2 TB of vinegar instead of water (used 1 TB this time). I also used half of a fresh onion instead of onion powder. All in all, this recipe is worth making just with a few fixes.

So tasty!  Much better than the canned sloppy joe mix and I love that stuff!  Silly me didn't have onion powder, so I diced an onion.  I also didn't have brown sugar, so I used white sugar and some molasses.  I was making this for my brother but he couldn't stay for dinner.  Good thing because I can't wait for leftovers!

This is a good sloppy joe, my kids liked it.  I prefer chopped onion and bell pepper in mine but this was quick, easy and inexpensive without.  I used tomato sauce in place of the ketchup and water and it worked great.

This is a great, very simple recipe--perfect for a busy weeknight.  The first time I made these, we thought they were too sweet, so I adjusted the recipe to double everything (for a family of 3) except the brown sugar.  I also added 1/4tsp of some chili garlic paste (found in the Asian food aisle) to cut the sweetness, which it didn't without making the sauce spicy.  It's not necessary to let this simmer for 30-40 minutes; I let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes and it was thick enough and flavors had blended well.  We will definitely be making this often.

this was easy to make and quite tasty.  i used ground turkey instead of beef and added chopped onion instead of onion powder and it turned out fine.

Excellent Go To Meal!  Why would anyone buy canned sloppy joes??? This is so easy and my husband loved it!  I toasted the sesame buns and the meal was delish! Be sure to add enough ketchup and water so the mixture has a nice sauce.

I loved this, and so did my picky family! I did double it,and used tomato sauce instead of ketchup.  Also added 1 tsp liquid smoke because I love that stuff.  These held together nicely and weren't at all sloppy for my kids-which was great! If you like really saucy joes, you may want to add more liquid.  I'll make these at least a couple times a month.

Absolutely awesome... I've been out of the US for 8yrs and for some reason Manwich popped into my head today, I found this recipe, tried it and it was just like old times.  I made it as written & it was perfect.  Big hit with the Aussie crew here.

A little bit sweet, a little bit tangy, a whole lot of good! No chunks either. No chopping required, fast and easy prep. I used minced garlic in the jar since I was out of the powder, about a half tsp worth. The only change I would make is to double this. Thanks so much!!!

Very good! My family loved this recipe! 

I also added extra water and less brown sugar. Next time I will add a little cayenne to heat it up. The cover and simmer time really makes the meat tender! There wasn't a bite left -unusual for my group. 

Thank you for sharing.:)

I had 1 lb of beef to use for this recipe so, in addition to doubling the ingredients, I also added a pinch of salt & pepper, 1/2 tsp dried onion flakes, half a can of condensed tomato soup, & ¼ tsp cumin. With these additions the recipe was perfect.

A good base recipe.  I doubled the recipe to 4 servings and added one medium diced onion as well.  Since we are a family that likes things a little on the spicy side, I also added 1/2 tsp. of chili powder and 1/2 tsp. of cayenne.

I doubled this recipe, but on the advice of a previous commenter, did not double the brown sugar. It was still too sweet, and that's why I gave it four stars instead of five. The sauce was a great consistency, and it was wonderfully easy to prepare. Next time I make it I will reduce the amount of brown sugar further, but I will certainly never use canned sloppy joe sauce again. 

If I were preparing this for just my husband and me, not the kids, I would have tossed in a dash of cayenne pepper or Frank's Hot Sauce for a little heat.

I was never a fan of sloppy joes growing up, but I really, really like this recipe.  I took the advice of other raters and added a dash of Tabasco, some chili powder & some cider vinegar.  I wanted to add some fiber to it also, so I added about a 1/4 C of Grape Nuts.  Once they simmer, you can't even tell they are there, no smell, no taste, no crunchiness.  Great recipe.  I like it better than those with canned condensed Gumbo mixes.

I make mine almost exactly like this, except I always double it and just "eyeball" the ingredients.  Also, I use fresh or dried minced onion (instead of onion powder).  Always a great hit with my family!

Fantastic - my picky 4 year old LOVED it. I used a real onion in place of onion powder, added 1 tsp. white vinegar, along with 1 tsp. chili powder (per another viewer's suggestion). Very good!

This is a great recipe. I use it ALL the time! I add another 1/2 tsp of garlic powder because we love garlic and about a tsp of chili powder. I use about 1/3 as much brown sugar as we don't like it too sweet and I cook it with the lid off because we don't like it as "sloppy". It's awesome! Sometimes I saute diced onions or green peppers in with it as well. Its part of the regular rotation in this house!

This was pretty good, very good actually. My husband and I both are tolerant of Sloppy Joes but not big fans and I now know that it was because it wasn't from scratch ;-) I did add a teaspoon and a half of white vinegar just because I could tell from the smell that it would be a little too sweet for me, and after that it was perfect. Also very easy...I made it while playing referee between our toddler and 12 week old puppy :) I served it on toasted hamburger rolls with steak fries for an easy lazy night dinner.

In Australia, I cannot find jars of sloppy joe mix in any stores so I tried this recipe for homemade style sloppy joes.  My family and guests loved it!  My husband requested that I always use this recipe rather than any sloppy joe jar mix.

My daughter loved them because she is a huge ketchup fan. I was looking for something a little milder than what comes out of the cans. Will try again just less ketchup. I scaled the recipe to serve 8 and it called for 2 cups of ketchup.

This is a great sauce! I did add the chili powder and vinegar to cut the sweetness down some. I also recommend using organic/all natural ketchup as it tastes way more like real tomatoes and is not sweetened with high fructose corn syrup. Since my husband does not like green peppers I subsituted finely chopped pickles which gave a nice crunch and added flavor. I will never buy another can of Sloppy Joe sauce!!

This was a very good and easy recipe.  I used grnd turkey instead of beef and doubled it.  My husband ate two sandwiches and I ate one - then I had a little for leftovers.  When doubling - there didn't seem to be enough liquid to simmer so I added more water and more ketchup.  I also added a bit more spices (didn't measure).  My husband thought it was great!

Really good.  Husband and toddler really liked it.  I'm never bothering with the canned stuff again.

i couldn't believe how good these were based on how easy they were to prepare!  both my husband and i were almost drooling from the smell, and they tasted even better.

i'll probably simmer mine a bit longer next time, or leave it uncovered while i simmer, as i prefer them to be a little less 'sloppy'.  great recipe, though!

Pretty good and the only changes I made was use only 1/2 TBS brown sugar, added 1 tsp of white vinegar and used 1/2 a fresh onion instead of the powder.

For sloppy joes - these were wonderful! Tangy, a little sweet, very good!  My 4 year old son who is so picky, ate 1 full one and then another half!  We all enjoyed them.  I doubled the recipe, except for the brown sugar, I was worried about it being too sweet.

I used extra lean ground beef, and I didn't drain it since there wasn't much to drain.  I didn't add any water, and it came out great.  Will definitely be keeping this in my recipe box.

Loved it!  In my opinion, the flavoring was just right.  I will be making these often because they are so easy and tasty. This was my first attempt at making homemade Sloppy Joe Sandwiches. I won't be looking elsewhere for the "perfect" recipe; I've already found it.

I would give this recipe 5 stars for easiness in cooking but wasn't at all fond of the taste - too sweet and too salty.  Sorry.

This was pretty good.  My son enjoyed it.  I found it to be a bit on the sweet side.  Next time, I will probably reduce the brown sugar by a tablespoon and add chopped onions and green pepper.

Was caving sloppy joes and didn't have a can of sauce.  This was great - easy to make.  My husband rated it a 8 out of 10 comparing it to the can stuff and found it to be just a bit sweeter than the can stuff.  I would make this again.

These were yummy. Very simple and easy to make. I accidently put more garlic powder than was needed, but it still tasted like normal sloppy joes. Very tasty!

I want my sloppy joes to taste absolutely wonderful every single time.  Which is why I use this recipe.  And, because I prefer a sweet sloppy joe.  I never change a single thing about this recipe.  It's better than Manwich (by about a mile or two) and every single time I make it, I positively purr.  Love it!

I made 4 times the recipe (8 servings). The only change I made was to add chopped onion and green pepper, which I sautéed with the beef. Great recipe that tasted even better the next day. It thickened up so much, I had to add a little more water when I reheated it. My family loved it....this recipe is a keeper!!

This is my go to sloppy joe recipe.  I don’t eat sloppy joes but my kids love them.  I scale it to where I use 1.5 to 2 lbs. of meat, usually ground turkey.  When I brown the meat, I add about half an onion (chopped) and omit the onion powder. I also add a few garlic cloves and omit the garlic powder, but I do use either garlic salt or seasoned salt, which ever I have on hand.  I like to throw in a smidge of bbq sauce too.

I found this recipe a few years ago and can't count the number of times I have made it since. This is absolutely my kids number one request. Several family members have also adopted it as well. I make it exactly as described. It's the perfect blend between sweet and tangy.

When I've made it, the only difference I made was by adding 1 small onion to the recipe, added to the beef (ground turkey meat works well too) after it has finished browning, just before the remaining ingredients are added.  Always satisfies!

Tried this out tonight and absolutely loved it! Followed recipe exact and loved that my picky eater didn't have to spend her time removing each pepper that she didn't like that's in the canned variety.  Served on Hawaiian sweet buns with shredded cheese...perfect!!!

I used fresh onion and garlic instead of powdered, but this recipe was just what I thought sloppy joe filling should taste like.  Excellent.  Will definitely make again.

Growing up, sloppy joe was a can of tomato soup in the hamb. and that was it!  Then I discovered Manwich and loved it.  Tonight I was hungry for sloppy joe, but no Manwich so I sought out this recipe.  Now I won't make it any other way!  I substituted sugar free brown sugar and it was great!

Really excellent!  The changes I made was that I used 6 oz of tomato paste instead of the ketchup, and I didn't have garlic powder so I just chopped up some fresh garlic and threw it in there.  Also, I used seasoned salt instead of the onion powder and salt.  It turned out really good.

Yup, awesome sloppy joes!! I used ground turkey that was leftover from making tacos (it was seasoned with onion, garlic, steak seasoning and cumin) I had a little more than a half a pound of meat but less than a full pound so I went with the measurements listed and added a splash of vinegar per reviews (apple cider was all I had on hand) but it was a little dry so I added a small can of tomato sauce and it was so perfect. I will make these time and time again. Thanks Laurie!

I used ground turkey and used instead of all ketchup, 2/3 of the cup was ketchup and 1/3 was spicy bbq sauce. I also added some chalula hot sauce to give it more kick. Although this is a sweet recipe it wasn't too sweet and my husband enjoyed the combination of sweet, tangy and spicy.

LOVE THIS!!! my boyfriend and i always do the grocery shopping together and he always throws one of those sloppy joe seasoning packets in the cart, but i grew up on homemade joes with ketchup and onions and all that good stuff so when i found this recipe i tried it out and they were so delicious!!! tasted just like mom used to make!!! i was skeptical bout the mustard (considering my boyfriend hates it) but you couldn't even taste it-just gave a nice tang! i did cook the meat with minced onion and omitted the onion powder....also i'm unsure if anyone is like me but i don't measure ingredients out.  i add how i feel necessary by constantly tasting.  but this was a great blueprint!!

This was very good!  I only had about 1/4 cup ketchup on hand but I used picante sauce along with the ketchup I had and it added a lot of extra flavor.  I also added red pepper flakes and a splash of hot sauce at the end for an extra kick.  Delicious!

I made this tonight for dinner. I added chopped onion to the hamburger and minced garlic to the sauce mixture.  Those were the only changes I made to the original recipe and just a personal preference, I think it would taste just as good using the powders.  It was much better than the tomato sauce rich Manwich.

I couldn't believe how good these sloppy joes were! I made as is, and I think I gave it a little extra tang when I added spicy brown mustard instead of regular yellow. They were not too sweet at all, just right. You have to try these!

This was a hit with my 5 year old and my husband and I.... i did add some veggies (onion, zuchinni, and red bell pepper) for nutritional value and cut the brown sugar way down. i also substitiuted beef stock for the water for a little more flavor. Great sucess with my family and my daughter and husband asked for this to be in our regular meal rotation!  Thanks so much!!!

I make this recipe all of the time now by popular demand of my family espcially my mother! I can't imagine doing sloppy joes any other way! It's fantastic and easy to double or tripple the ingredients. Sometimes I add a little bit of bell peper but that is just personal taste. Love Love Love this recipe!

These were incredible. I have always hated sloppy joes (Manwich) but these tasted great! My kids and hubby loved them too!

Only minor changes based on other reviews. I used 2 lbs venison (it's what we had), added 1 T chili powder and 2 T white vinegar. I quadrupled the sauce ingredients -- but didn't quite use the full amount of garlic and onion powder. I browned the meat on the stove, then mixed with all sauce ingredients in the crockpot on low. I added about 1 1/2 c of grated carrots to the crockpot, too. I just tasted one spoonful and I am going to throw away my old recipe!! Very confident you would like this sauce with ground turkey, beef, elk, venison, etc.

Really good.  Only two things I would change: cook the meat with real onions, even if you have to dice really small for picky eaters and cut back a tad bit on sugar.  It was just a bit too sweet for our taste. Works great with ground turkey for a healthy alternative!

This was okay. Living in Germany, I can't get the can of Manwich that I loved from back home, so thought I would take a stab of making them myself. This turned out alright, but to me tasted a little too sweet (I don't really know why?). If you are craving to have Sloppy Joes but can't access a can of Manwish, then this is a good one to use, but it just didn't hit the spot like the canned store-bought one can.

I doubled this recipe for 1lb of ground turkey and added a beef bullion cube, some diced onion and some diced bell pepper (which I would reccomend doing!). To be honest, I've never eaten or made 'home-made' sloppy joes & I wasn't sure about this at first. I didn't let this simmer very long, maybe 15 minutes (my husband was 'starving' and 'couldn't wait any longer' to eat!) but I def. think it needs to simmer the full 30-40 minutes, if not longer, for the flavors to blend really well otherwise the ketchup overwhelms the other flavors. The next day though, after the flavors blended, this was wonderful. I don't think ill ever buy canned sloppy joe mix again! Next time I make this ill add a bit more garlic/onion powder though. Thanks!

My daughter came home from a friend's house the other night and said that her friend was having sloppy joes for dinner.  My daughter wanted to know what a sloppy joe was!  I have never made sloppy joes because my husband and I both grew up hating the stuff that comes in a can.  I decided to find a homemade recipe and liked this one because it didn't call for green peppers, which a few of us don't care for.  I browned my meat in the morning and then put it in my slow cooker along with all of the seasonings.  I let it cook on low for 6-7 hours before eating.  It was awesome.  Nothing like the canned stuff and it was so easy to make with the help of my slow cooker.  I did have to double the recipe to make enough for my family.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very yummy! Held together well, a plus for the kids. Good flavor! Sweated minced onions instead of powdered for a little extra texture. Much better than store bought.

This was a good recipe. I have never made Sloppy Joes before, so this was amazing. I only have used store bought versions which tend to me extremly salty, a flavour I am not too found of. Anyway, I didn't have the Worcester sauce, so I used "Mr Yoshida's" gormet sauce in place of it. Turned out great! I also added a small onion.

Fantastic recipe!  I doubled it and had to alter a few things, just because of what was in the pantry.  I ran out of ketchup (had less than 1/4 cup) so I used 3 medium tomatoes and crushed them up with the potato masher.  I added a bit more sugar than the recipe called for to make up some of the sweetness, but it still wasn't as sweet as full ketchup would have been.  I also added about 1/2 of a red onion all died up to the meat when browning and we used ground venison (which was delicious!!).

This was great!  I added a little chopped onion and bell pepper in with the meat as it cooked.  And, I also thought that about 10-15 minutes of simmering was plenty.  Best sloppy joe ever!  I will definitely make this again!

Although this recipe did come out pretty good, you're basically just remaking Manwich Sloppy Joe Mix. Tasted almost exactly the same, but was more expensive and more time consuming. If you're just looking to make something from scratch rather than out of a can, this is the recipe to use!

I hadnt had sloppy joes since I was a little girl, and never quite liked them, but after trying this recipe, IM SOLD!Im now a vegetarian so I used the beef crumbles instead, but also made a few minor changes. I added diced onion just to give it some texture. I also added garlic cloves instead of garlic powder. ALSO, instead of using 1/2 cup of ketchup I added some barbecue sauce with some ketchup equaling out to a 1/2 cup. My boyfriend is a meat eater and he couldnt even tell it was fake beef and said the flavor was so good! Plus, by using the beef crumbles, it cuts out on a lot of saturated fat, and extra calories!

I made this for dinner tonight because I needed something quick and easy.  This recipe was perfect!  So easy!  I always add about 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce to any Sloppy Joe recipe as my son likes the BBQ flavor.  But this recipe is great with or without it.  It's just personal preference.

I, too am a Manwich junkie, but these were the best sloppy joes we have ever had!  My husband, who is VERY picky about sloppy joes told me that I didn't have to buy canned stuff anymore.  Delicious!

If your on the fence about making this MAKE IT!!  Don't change a thing!! I found this recipe about a month or so ago and have made it about 5 or 6 times.  My husband asks for it on a regular basis. I am making this father's day weekend for him. He even says to make extra and try to freeze it, so thats the plan this weekend.  LOVE IT!!

Amazing! This is way better then anything you can get out of a can or a packet. My very very picky two year old at one and 1/2 of these.. The only things I changed were: the onion powder, I simply didn't have any (I know right) so I cut up a half of an onion ad threw it in with the beef. I also added some Tabasco sauce to my husbands (it's an Army thing) for a little kick. We will be eating these many times to come. Thank you!

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would! My hubby said that it was the best sloppy joe he had in his entire life and I would have to agree with him. I had to double the recipe because I had more than 1/2 lb of ground beef and instead of using a whole cup of ketchup, (because I doubled the recipe) I did 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 brown sugar bar-b-que sauce....AWESOME! I also used Splenda brown sugar instead of regular. Best recipe I've EVER gotten off this site!!!

This was a good Sloppy Joe. I made some slight changes that I think without them, this would be a three star recipe, though. I decreased the brown sugar as many have suggested, and added a pinch of cayenne. I also doubled the recipe to four servings. But overall, these were pretty good.

I must admit that I have never eaten a sloppy joe in my life...being a long time vegetarian and for some reason they never appealed to me as a little kid, so I am not sure what a normal sloppy joe should taste like.   I made this recipe with Morningstar meat crumbles. It turned out really sweet I thought. Next time I will put in less brown sugar and a little more of the other flavors. Also, I'll probably add some veggies as other reviewers have suggested. All around, very tasty for my first sloppy joe ever!

Made this for lunch today.  It actually was very good.  If I was making this just for myself I would definitely add chopped onion but the kids do not like onions and so I made sloppy joes according to the recipe.  Will definitely make again!

These were a huge hit at my house.  Everyone loved them.  They had just the right amount of spice and sweet to them.  These are great for busy week nights.  The only thing that I did different is the length of simming.  I simmered for about 20 mins, they were wonderful!!!  I will make these again.  Thanks Laurie!!!

Wonderful recipe.  I will never buy manwich again.  I was low on ketchup so i used a little bbq sauce to make up for it.  I also used ground venison because that's all we eat.  Thank you!   I love a really good recipe that's easy but seems like I put lots of time into it!

Very good sauce!  We used to always use the cheap brand of sloppy joe sauce until a year or two ago, and then my husband would request Manwich b/c it obviously has better flavor.  So last night we were planning on making sloppy joes for tonight's supper, and he said "Don't forget to make sure you get Manwich, not the cheap brand."  Haha.  So i looked on here for a recipe instead and tried this one.....and we both thought it was great!  We will definitely make this again, and might not have to buy ANY brand ever again b/c we'll be making our own!!! Thanks for the yummy recipe! :)

My husband like these better than me. I would have given 3 stars otherwise.  I opted for the half ketchup-half BBQ route to give it more zing.  I also diced a small onion and sauteed it with a few pressed garlic cloves before adding the meat. Then a splash of red wine vinegar at the end to help cut the sweetness.

VERY YUMMY! This is by far the best Sloppy Joe's I've ever had & my husband agrees. My only complaint is that we try and do more healthy meals and with 409 cals for a sandwich, that's a lot - but I loved that we made the 2 serving size and it was perfect to give us each a hearty sandwich with great taste, if I had made more than those 2 servings we would have surely eaten way beyond what is reasonable it was so good! But sometimes, healthy be darned and ya just gotta go for the YUM!

This recipe is awesome!  Ever since I found this one, I never make the package seasonings.  Nothing like homemade.  And it's just as easy as the package recipe.  Most of the items in the recipe are things you already have at home.

Loved this recipe.  DH who is somewhat picky said, I really liked this one, save it.   I just doubled the recipe.  It is not very saucy, but meaty.

I doubled this recipe to have leftovers for the next day.  They were actually better on day 2 and 3.  I followed the recipe to the letter and woudln't change a thing!  Make sure to let the flavors "marry" and cook down the extra liquid.

This is sooo good! If you add 1 diced green pepper &  1 diced onion when you sautee the meat, and 1 Tbs vinegar with the remaining ingredients, it tastes like Manwich, but better! Oh yeah... I only use ground turkey and no one knows the difference.

A classic recipe, and a great start for customization. I added more garlic and onion powder to take away a bit of the ketchup and mustardness. Lot's of tweaking still to come on this, I could see good results with sauteed onions, chili powder and lots of other combinations.

My family liked this but I wasn't crazy about it.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Maybe I would have liked it better with beef.

Yum!!!  Very good!  My husband and young children liked it too, and gobbled it right up.  I doubled the recipe, and followed the recipe exactly, except that I used one rounded tbspn of brown sugar as someone else suggested rather than 2T, and it was still plenty sweet.  We enjoy manwich for the convenience and ease, but will use this recipe instead now!!!  Highly recommend!

Pretty yummy. I didn't have any worcestershire sauce or onion powder. It didn't matter. I cooked green pepper and onion with the hamburger and added a just a tad more brown sugar and used a little over a tablespoon of mustard. Delish!

This was really good.  The only problem I had was it was a touch too sweet for my taste. I used most of a cup of ketchup, and topped it off with some chipotle barbeque sauce for a kick...I also added 1tsp white vinegar, 1 tsp chili powder, a jalapeno, part of a green pasilla pepper, and it was still a little too sweet. Perhaps next time, I'll leave out the sugar. But it was really good, quick and easy!! Also...no need to cook for 30-40 mins, 10 will do

I WILL NEVER BUY canned sauce again. My BF always whines that he doesn't like SJs. Not after tonight!  I did make a slight adjustment added a 1/4 tsp Worchershire, and 1/2 TSP BBQ sauce so it wouldn't taste ketcuphy.  THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE

This is the first time I have rated a recipe, but felt that I must because it was so great! This is the perfect, old fashioned sloppy joe- the one the grandmas just know how to make by adding a little bit of ketchup and a little bit of mustard, etc. Perfect! Just the right amount of sweetness!!!

I normally can't stand Sloppy Joes and I HATE the stuff in the can. To my surprise, this is really good! My hubs kept raving over how good they were. It's also made with stuff I always have on hand, except the hamburger buns. I followed the recipe as written, and doubled it! I'm not a fan of mustard and I couldn't taste at all. Hardest part was for me to actually put it in..lol. My hubs really thanks you for the recipe!

This recipe is fantastic! I love making this now instead of using the pouch of seasoning from the store (a lot of ingredients I can't pronounce!) This tastes just like the pouch of seasoning and I feel better about making this for my family. I can also sneak some shredded vegetables in it for my picky 3-year-old!

Very, very good Sloppy Joe recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was just fabulous!  Nothing over powered the other in ingredients but yet you could taste each one individually.  I would recommend to anyone!!  Definite keeper in my recipe box.

This should be a ten star dish.  I messed up the first time and made it with 1 lb beef but didn't double the rest of the ingredients.  It was ok but the second time I made it I added 2 cloves of garlic,minced and a 1/2 of an onion, finely minced (in addition to the garlic and onion powder).  It was awesome!! My husband can't eat foods with  a lot of sodium so this is perfect!  We will never buy manwich again!!!

Very very good recipe! I used a little less ketchup and added some barbecue sauce. I also used real garlic and onion instead of the powder. Otherwise I looooved these sloppy joes. The brown sugar is a great touch.

This is my new favorite sloppy joe recipe. It was excellent. I wasn't sure what to expect with the strange array of ingredients, but it is really good. The only thing I may do differently next time is reduce the amount of brown sugar slightly. It was very sweet.

Very Yummy!! This is an excellent recipe!!  Very quick and easy....simply brown the ground beef add the rest of the ingredients and simmer until you are ready to eat!!!  I had to quadrupal the recipe to feed my family and then have enough for hubby to have for lunch the next day (and he made sure to let me know he wanted it the next daY!!)  Love it and will be making it again soon!!  My kids also love it which is great.

Well, it has been a while since anyone rated this recipe but I just had to write this. I made this one tonight and my 2 boys absolutely loved this. I only knew the one from the can but this is really great and my boys already asked to make it again. I doubled the recipe and added about 1/2 cup of water. Love it. :)

These are great sloppy joe's.  I added onion to the hamburger while it browned and quadrupled the recipe.  I also added a teaspoon of chili powder and a teaspoon of white vinegar.  They are wonderful!

It's a good easy recipe.  I had to play a little because I didn't have enough ketchup.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 can of tomato paste.  I doubled the water which was perfect for consistency.  I also doubled the sugar because obviously ketchup is relatively sweet by itself.  I also doubled the mustard and probably tripled or more the amount of worcestershire sauce.  I always eyeball garlic, onion, salt and pepper.  I ended up adding about 1/2 tsp of red wine vinegar, mostly to make up for the lack of tang from the ketchup.  Worked really well.

This was a good recipe.  I doubled it and the recipe fed my family of six.  I have tried other sloppy joe recipes and my kids seemed to like this one best because there were no large crunchy pieces of onion or green pepper.  Definitly a kid pleaser.  Thanks, we will use this one again.

Wow!! I am a Manwich girl....but this was GREAT!! Out of manwich...ground turkey already on stove, cooking!! OH no!! Hurry, search on allrecipes.com. this turned out soooo good my kids ate it, and my husband asked me to make it again!! Of course, because we were out of manwich, we were also almost out of ketchup. I had 3/4 cup of ketchup and half of a diced tomato with a little heinz 57. WOW!! this is a keeper. SUPER DUPER easy, quick, and tasty. STRONGLY recco for easy quick dinners by mom.

This was pretty good.  I put a little extra brown sugar in, but I think that I should have stuck with the recipe's 2 tbl. spoons.  My husband cannot stand manwhich, but he loved this.

We LOVE these!  I double the recipe to feed my family of 5, do as some other reviewers suggested: I increase the brown sugar to 3 T and added a t of white vinegar and 1 t of chili powder.  This is served nearly once a week at our house, sometimes with ground Turkey instead of beef, and even my 3 kids under 7 eat it and love it, which was big praise to me because they are tough critics!

Made it with ground turkey instead of beef.  You know the sauce is good when you can't even tell you used turkey!  Will definitely make again.

way too sweet. tasted like seasoned ketchup sauce.  to improve, use half the amount of ketchup and add a cup of crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce so the sauce isn't soo sweet. add 2tsp worcheshire, 1tsp vinegar, 1tbsp chili powder to add more depth of flavor. add onions & peppers in with the beef.

My husband grew up on sloppy joes and said these were very close to his Mom's!  I followed the ingredients exactly but instead of simmering 30-40 min I used the pressure cooker on high for 6 min and it was perfectly thickened and the flavors had melded together wonderfully. Super fast and delicious.

Not impressed.  It turned out too thick and saucy for my taste.  Admittedly, I prefer my sloppy joes to have fresh onion and green pepper, so maybe that's my big issue.  I made it exactly as listed.  This recipe's best attribute were the simple ingredients.  I was able to make it without a trip to the store!

My husband loved, loved, loved this!  I hadn't made sloppy joes in years and since we've had to cut back on spending in recent months, my mind started going to recipes that were cheap and easy, so of course I thought of sloppy joes.  i didn't want to buy the manwich stuff so i decided to go in search of an actual recipe and since my husband doesn't like anything with vegetable chunks i had to rule out several other seemingly good recipes on this site and settled on this one.  I'm so happy I did!  These were so good and so simple!!!  the only thing I added was some shredded swiss on top of the mixture.  mmm yum! this is a keeper!

Very picky husband loves it! I doubled the recipe and took some other reviewer's suggestions of adding 1 tsp each of chile powder and vinegar, plus I sauteed onion, green pepper & a garlic clove with the meat. I asked hubby to taste and tell me what else it needs...he excitedly replied NOTHING! He wasn't raised on home cooking, so he was pleasantly surprised that I could duplicate something that comes out of a can.

This is very, very tomato-y. It was sadly only a hit with our toddler. Husband said to never make it again, and I sadly have to agree. If you like manwich, this is not something you're going to like. There are other sloppy joe recipes out there that taste better.

I decided to try this for my bible study group when the person who was supposed to bring the main dish backed out at the last second. Am I glad I did. These are great! Even one of the kids who I am told is Mr. Picky and won't eat anything had two of them and told me "These are really good!" I All Recipes calculate enough for 16 people and it did well. It could have been because I made so much that it seemed a little too sweet so I added a little cajun seasoning. Not much, just enough to take away some of the sweetness. Big hit. I will be makng this again and again. Thanks!

Doubled the recipe to use one pound of ground beef.  Ran out of ketchup and had to add bbq...so that probably altered the taste a little.  Easy, tasty, quick and a nice change of pace.  I'll make it again (4 stars 'cause it's not as good as when my mom used to make it :-)

This recipe was a good jumping off point.  I found it a little too sweet for my taste and wouldn't use sugar.  There is already a lot of sugar in the ketchup so I don't feel it needs any more.  I would add some onion and green peppers too.  I did add a little tabasco sauce to give it a little kick.  The kids loved it and asked for seconds.

This is the best sloppy joe I've ever had! I did make some modifications though. I sauteed a whole onion into the mix before adding the meat. I skimped on the ketchup by about an 1/8th of a cup and added some BBQ sauce instead. I also used ground turkey rather than beef. If you're feeling adventurous and prefer it a little hot, a few squirts of Sriricha (or Rooster sauce) goes really well in the mix. Enjoy it on a thick kaiser roll or a hearty scoop of mashers!

So, so yummy! I added some old bay seasoning instead of the onion powder, and put in about a tablespoon of barbeque sauce. Also, instead of regular salt, I put in seasoned salt. Came out perfect! My whole family loved them!

These were pretty good.....perfect on a night that you have ground beef and no clue what to do with it!  We left out the mustard because we are not fans of it, but later put it in because I guess the point of it is to counteract the sweetness of it all so luckily we couldn't takste it! (Oh and we put in less than the full amount of mustard).

This is a good recipe.  A little sweet for our family.  Next time I will cut back on the brown suger and/or add some significant spice to balance it out.  Still, very good.

I finally found the sloppy joe recipe I have been searching for!  I doubled the recipe and added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar.  I think I sprinkled in some Chili Powder but it was perfect without it. Thank you so much!

Wow, this was very good. I did have a pound of meat so I doubled everything but the brown sugar. Based on reviews of this recipe too sweet, I decided to use less. Also, I used chopped onions instead of the powder. Kids really liked them. This is my new sloppy joe recipe.

GOOD BYE MANWICH!! :)... and hello Sloppy Joes; true tasting sloppy joes! Thank you for this recipe, I absolutely loved it and husband did as well. This will be the only recipe for this dish I will ever use again :), and I have already  shared it with two friends. I did make a slight modification by adding one small/diced yello onion, as well as a couple shakes of Tobasco sauce and a pinch of crushed red pepper seeds. But without your base recipe I could not have improved on it (for myself,) this is truly a reipe keeper and will only use this one in the future. Again, thank you very much for sharing.

This will be the sloppy joe recipe I use from now on. I have tried all the canned ones from the store and disliked all of them. This is almost as simple as the can and far more tasty! My whole family liked it. I did add sauteed onion. We love sauteed onion in hamburger dishes. I only simmered it about 10 minutes. It tasted great.

This is the first time I ever made sloppy joes and it was delicious! I liked it as an intro to them and my MIL loved them and has been eating sloppy joes forever. Im 8 months pregnant so always looking for quick, easy and yumy. This met all of the above! The only places I deviated from the recipe was to double it and add fresh onion to my ground beef.

Brought this to a 4th of July get-together.  A slice of American cheese (how appropriate) on the bottom helps the bun from getting soggy.  I added some minced onion to the hamburger, as well as a teaspoon of vinegar to the ketchup mix.  Loved by all, even my one-year-old!  Next time I will sneak some carrot puree in there to get some more veggies into my picky eaters.

Good sloppy joe recipe. This may sound silly, but I serve this over a little bit of mashed potatoes shaped in a mound, like a mountain, smush the top down with a spoon to make a well and then fill with sloppy joe mixture and run it down the side. We call them volcanos. I add little bits of broccoli to look like trees. My kids like it and they eat it.

Wonderful recipe. I even messed it up and it still turned out great! Instead of adding a tsp each of mustard and wors sauce, I accidently added a Tablespoon of each. Oops! But it was still great. I nixed the brown sugar because I used 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce and 1/4 cup of ketchup instead of the full 1/2 cup. Next time, I'll get the mustard and wors sauce right. Will definitely make again. And maybe add some tabasco next time. Yum!

Amazing how such a simple bunch of ingredients can make something so very good. My husband, who's really a picky eater, ate three huge sandwiches filled with this. This will definitely go in my list of family favorites, and it was easy! I didn't change anything at all, and it was phenomenal.

My mom used to make Sloppy Joe's whenever we had company coming to stay with us.  After she passed away nobody could find her recipe and we all resorted to using Manwich.  This recipe is identical to the one my mom used to make and I am so happy to have it.  Thank you for posting it.

these were really good! Even my 9 year old picky eater liked them! I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I added soy sauce instead.

Awesome! This tasted so good. I made this last minute to serve to my picky kids and they LOVED it! I wasn't going to eat it myself but it tasted to delicious I couldn't resist...so much for my diet.  I did take some pointers and added 1 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp vinegar. It certainly was quick and easy. I will definitely be making this again soon. It feels good to know what is going into the sauce versus buying some weird goop in a can at the grocery store.  LOVE IT!!!

I have made this recipe on lots of occasions and it never fails, very yummy and easy.  I use fresh garlic and salt vs. the garlic powder & salt.  My whole family loves it and so did everyone at my son's birthday party!  Much less expensive than the canned sloppy joe mixes and a lot better too!!

Made this tonight- it was DELISH! I doubled the recipe and ran out of ketchup so I added 1/4 bbq sauce to it (old stand by- Open Pit hickory flavor) and it turned out great! I also added some chopped green pepper because I had it on hand, and cut the brown sugar to 1/2. I will definitely make this again, love the fact that all of the ingredients are pretty much staples.

This is a fantastic recipe! I used fresh chopped onion, reduced the brown sugar to 2 teaspoons and added one Tablespoon of vinegar as another reviewer suggested.  My husband and I both loved this!  Thanks, Laurie!

This is a good base recipe, but definitely needs some doctoring.  Substitue tomato paste for some of the ketchup.  Use fresh garlic and onion, way better than dried.  As the meat is browning you can brown the garlic & onion with it.  Add in some Italian Seasoning (fresh or dry). . .oregano, parsley, basil.  One teaspoon of Chili Seasoning will go a long way in Sloppy Joes.  Enjoy!

When it came time to make dinner tonight, we were planning to have hamburgers, but wanted something a little different.  I typed in "ground beef" for the ingredient, and saw "sloppy joes," which I hadn't eaten since I was a kid.  I was delighted when I found this recipe, and realized I had the ingredients all ready! I doubled the recipe, but other than that I followed it exactly.  They were delicious! My boyfriend said this recipe is "a keeper."

Yummy & easy, and since I'm playing at being single this week it was perfect for just me with a small amount of leftovers for tomorrows lunch. The only thing I changed was to add 1/4 c. chili sauce because I had some to use up and a tb. extra of water to make it a bit saucer for my taste. Excellent recipe and I will use this again and again. Thanks so much Laurie!

This really deserves 3.5 stars. Its a great starter, but after following the recipe exactly it tasted kinda like tangy ketchup, kinda boring. So I wound up just eyeballing extra ingredients to try and liven it up a bit. You definitely need fresh green peppers and onions chopped up in this, it just isn't sloppy joes without them.

Went to make sloppy joes today from a Manwich can and didn't have any so I used this recipe instead. The sandwiches are the best, my whole family loved them and I'll never go back to the "can" again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow, these are great! Doubled the recipe and added a chopped onion, just because I was trying to get rid of it. Very tasty and so much better than store-bought! It's worth it to make it yourself!

Yummy!  A little too sweet, but not enough to loose a star.  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.

I haven't had sloppy joe's since I was a kid, but yesterday I got a sudden desire. I grabbed this recipe real quick and tried it out. Not only was it super easy, but it was awesome! My boyfriend went back for thirds (which never happens, he's a picky eater!). I can't wait to make this again.

My son was raving about these. He won't eat sloppy joe mix from a can and he had two of these for dinner. I loved them too. Nice and sweet,and tangy too. Perfect. I doubled the recipe to make enough for 4 people. I loved it and didn't change a thing.

I found it to be a little salty.  Next time I will probably omit the added salt because the ketchup is high in salt already.  Overall very yummy!

My family likes this recipe so much that I have two cans of Manwich in my basement pantry that I keep forgetting to use.  I also like this recipe because it doesn't call for anything that I don't already have on hand.

I haven't eaten sloppy joes for years and thought I would try them again and was pleasantly surprised. They were far better then I had remembered and this will certainly become a go to recipe as it is quick and easy. The only change I made was adding a tsp of chili powder and a 1/4 tap of cayenne pepper.

I made this recipe because I didn't have any sloppy joe mix at home.  It turned out good!  I didn't have onion powder so I used about 2 teaspoons of minced onion.  I will use this again!

I always ate homemade sloppy joes growing up.  The first time I had mamwich, I couldn't believe people liked the stuff.  This recipe is very good and similar to what I ate growing up.  I made it as directed, except for adding some vinegar.

used ground turkey instead and it came out delicious and a little healthier.  Also added canned mushrooms.  Next time will add some chopped hot pepper to spice it up a little bit!  Very good and easy.

This was good, not quite the same as manwich, but a good substitute that contains ingredients I always have on hand.  I think next time I would increase the amount of sauce, as it seemed a little dry.

I made these on a whim tonight and they were ok. I followed the recipe for the sauce but I added less water and cooked it faster...I spread cheddar cheese on top and served on buns... it was meant to be a simple dinner and it was. Thanks for the recipe.

my husband loved this and he is not really into sloppy joe's. I did use real onion and garlic because I happen to have them on hand. This recipe was just the right amount of sweet. I loved them and I do mean them; they are addictive. Thanks!

I added a chopped onion when browning the meat, used a lower sugar ketchup to drop the carbs, and added a little chopped red, yellow and green pepper that was left over from an omlette.  It was very good!  and easy, and I will make this over and over as a quick inexpensive dinner.

This is a terrific recipe.  We use it with ground venison and I double the sauce for it.  We didn't change it at all. It is perfect. My boyfriend is very picky on sloppy joe sauces and he says this was in perfect, none from the can anymore.

We love Sloppy Joes, but this recipe just didn't work for my family.  I followed the recipe exactly to be fair.  Maybe it's all the ketchup and powdered spices.  We found it blah.  Sorry :(.

I thought this was very good. I could eat it as is and enjoy it, but I did make a few changes. I used garlic salt and onion salt because that's what I had. I omitted the salt because of this. When it was done I decided to add the extra salt, some pepper and chili powder for some extra flavor. It was delicious. (I don't agree that it was better than canned Manwich though). I only simmered mine for about five minutes before I lost patience and ate it.   Oh, I also forgot to double the sauce since I cooked 1 lb. of ground beef. It still coated all the burger, and had lots of flavor. I will use this recipe again when I want a Sloppy Joe and I don't have any Manwich sauce. Thank you!

This was fantastic. I did make a few adjustments. I doubled the recipe and added a chopped onion, 2 fresh chopped garlic cloves, a dash of cayenne, and about a tbsp of red wine vinegar..result was amazing...ate these growing up from the manwich can and this just blows that out of the water...enjoy!

We enjoyed this recipe just as it is written.  We had three little ones (5 and under) eating it and they all gobbled it right up. We did double it for our family.  If my husband had been home I would have needed a bit more it was such a hit.

This was GREAT!!  Its snowing and we are trapped in the house and I wanted sloppy joes.  This was cool, because everything I needed was in the pantry.  I used part tomatoe sauce and ketchup only because I had left overs and needed to use them.  I also used more brown sugar and a splash of vingar.  I also added onion and garlic as well as the powdered.  It is very good and almost as easy as opening a can.  Next time i might throw in a half of can of rotel and see what I come up with!!  Thanks

Very good.  Made with ground turkey and put on onion burger buns.  My girls liked it too.  Very easy! (not fun cleaning my cast iron skillet afterwards.  I will use nonstick next time. LOL)

Why did I buy spice packets before? This is very easy and way better than anything you buy premade.

A little sweet for my taste... I considered using tomato sauce instead of katsup but decided to make it as written.  Next time would definitely use the sauce.  Good except for the excessive sweetness!

I made this for my grandkids, son-in-law and husband, they all said the sandwiches were great!  I did two things different, one I added celery because I used ground beef that I had already cooked and the second instead of 3 cups ketchup (I made the recipe for 12)I used 1 cup of chili sauce.  My son-in-law ate 3 sandwiches.

Fantastic. Our new go-to recipe for sloppy joes. Only difference was I didn't add the brown sugar. Was perfect without it! Kids love it! (Only gave recipe 4 stars because of the brown sugar.)

Great recipe with some changes:  I used ground turkey, undrained, instead of beef.  Used V-8 in place of 1/2 the ketchup; added one whole onion to the ground turkey, 3 pressed cloves of garlic, and 1 T. of vinegar.  No added salt.  Next time I'll decrease the brown sugar--it was too sweet. Some of my family liked some sliced cheddar on top.

This was pretty good, but I would cut the brown sugar in half.  It was a little to sweet for our taste and ketchup has a lot of sugar in it.

My 4 kids really enjoyed this quick dinner that pepped up ground beef in a tasty way. I even  liked it, and I don't normally like sloppy joes. You could get a way with less brown sugar since ketchup has sugar. I added pepper and just a hint of vinegar. Mini versions of these could be made as appetizers for a football crowd.

Loved it!  Substituted a small can of red sauce in lieu of the ketchup to save on carbs.  Tasted even better the second day.

This was good for a sloppy joe.  I made it as written except cooked diced onions and garlic with the beef in place of onion and garlic powder.  I thought it was a little too ketchup-tasting, but I'm not a huge fan of ketchup anyway.

This is a great recipe!  The only changes I made were to use minced garlic in place of garlic powder and finely chopped onion in place of onion powder.  These changes were made so I wouldn't have to go to the store.  However, it was so good I think I'll stick with it.

This recipe was awesome! I have two teenage sons. One loves sloppy joes and one is not real fond of them. They both loved them and so did I! In the past I always used a sloppy joe packet from McCormick and a can of tomato paste and really like that....but this takes it's place from now on! The only change I made other than doubling the recipe was I took the advice of other reviewers and added a splash of vinegar, 1/2 tsp of minced garlic, 1 tsp chili powder. I will definitely share this recipe and use regularly!!!

Yum! This is exactly what I was looking for! The only change I made was omitting the brown sugar because my boyfriend has some weird aversion to putting sugar in main dishes. We both loved it, and will definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks!

I have a 14 year old daughter that is the pickiest eater ever.  The one thing she likes is Sloppy Joe's.  I always make the one in the can and didn't have one on hand.  So I made this recipe.  She said this was the best she ever had.  I didn't change a thing and it was so EASY.  I'm sure this is much healthier than the can.  I will make this for now on.

These were better then manwhich.  I made them with turkey instead of beef and added a jalapano pepper, half green pepper, and one plum tomato.  I will make these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really great recipe! I have been making homemade sloppy joes for years since my husbands grandmother showed me how easy it is to make. I vowed to never buy Manwich again. I was looking for any different recipes & I'm so glad I found this one! I doubled the recipe since there are alot of us eating. The only thing differnt that I did was that I used ground venison since that is what we have. I never have to buy ground beef. This time our ground meat had bacon gound up in it so it gave it an even better flavor! You can't go wrong with this recipe! I think next time I will even quadruple this recipe so we can have leftovers!

These were so good.  Like the other Manwich addicts that posted, I'll never buy the canned stuff again.  I doubled this recipe and I had only 3/4 cup of ketchup left, so I topped the remainder of the required cup with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  This meant that I could have cut back on the Brown Sugar and I should have done so by half.  My fault on the slightly sweet.  I did sautee some green onions and green pepper before adding my beef.. I think the flavor was enhanced nicely.  I also added a TBS of vinegar and let the mix simmer for about 1 hour.  I kept thinking this would be great in a crock pot simmering all afternoon.  Why do Sloppy Joes always remind me of Halloween?  :)  These were just delicious.. thanks for sharing such a simple pleasure!

Hate to be the bearer of bad news but this was just o.k. Tasted more like sweet meat to me and the hubby. We both rated it a 3 and we usually love recipes from Taste of Home.

I love this, its so easy. I have a daycare and its rare to find something all the kids like, even the ones that don't like sloppy joes loved this recipe. One little boy asked if I could give the recipe to his mom because he does'nt like her sloppy joes. Yum

A little on the sweet side for my tastes.  I will make again, but reduce the amount of brown sugar.

I thought this was pretty good considering how simple it was. I dont have worcestershire sauce on hand and I was completely out of brown sugar so I subbed for barbeque sauce and white sugar and I think it was good. prolly would have been better using brown sugar though.  I fed it to hubby and he ate 3 sandwiches and then I asked him if he liked the sloppy joes and he said they tasted a little different but were good and I told him I made the sauce because I thought i had a can but was mistaken. His eyes widened.....  kids didn't touch it but they come and go with sloppy joes. I would definately make again but with all correct ingredients.

I've never had a Sloppy Joe sandwich before, but Husband considers himself something of an expert (haha). Apart from adding a couple of tbsps of our favorite bbq sauce, I made this as written. Husband loved it, and wolfed down two in once sitting. What a quick, easy and tasty recipe. Thanks!

Very tasty, will definitely make again, but I want to try replacing the ketchup with crushed fire-roasted tomatoes or tomato paste (for less sugar and additives). Based on other reviews, I added 1 t. white vinegar and 1 t. chili powder. Quite delicious!

This is one of the easiest and quickest meals I have ever made.  I made the sauce while the meat was browning then started a load of laundry while everything was simmering.  The end result was absolutely delicious.  It has the perfect amount of sweet and sour with a ton of flavor.  Just one of the sandwiches was so filling too!

CHANGES: As advised by fellow reviewers, I added more garlic powder, 1/4 t chili powder and a splash of white rice vinegar (all i had on hand).  I let it simmer for only about 10 minutes.

THIS IS GREAT! I ALSO USED ROTEL AND TOMATO PASTE. IT ISN'T TOO SWEET WHEN YOU DO IT WITH THOSE. IF YOU USE KETCHUP CUT THE BROWN SUGAR TO HALF. 
I WON'T BUY MANWICH AGAIN EITHER.

Awesome! Our family loves this sloppy joe recipe. I add onion when browning the meat, and add 1 teaspoon of vinegar and some hot sauce to give it a little kick.

This was very good but maybe a little on the sweet side?  I doubled the recipe, but next time I won't double the brown sugar.  The only other change I made was to add onion.  YUM!

Very good...I made this recipe because I went to make sloppy joes and didn't have "the can".  It was so quick and easy and I had everything to make it!  I had two teenage girls over (they made it), my three year old son, and my husband and they all loved it!  Thanks!!

This recipe was very easy and yummy! I liked the flavor much more than the typical storebought mix. It had a slight BBQ tang to it, and was delicious. Like another reviewer I added chopped onion to the meat and sauteed together. I might even add peppers and mushrooms next time.

Loved it. I was looking for a recipe so i could stretch some canned sauce i already had. Well lets just say i never pulled the can opener out of the drawer i tripled the recipe and used 2lbs of ground turkey instead of beef. I will never buy sloppy joe in a can or packet again. Thanks for this recipe.

These are the best sloppy joe ever! I will never buy Manwich again.  I followed the recipes and only changed a couple things. I use half ketchup and half BBQ.  I also add a tsp vinegar and a tbsp soy sauce.  You won't be dissapointed!  This sauce also works great on pulled pork.

This recipe was great - will never buy canned sloppy joe sauce again! The kids loved it & it was super easy! Perfect for those nights when everybody is starving and you have no idea what to cook for dinner because these ingredients are always on hand.  We had 4 teens to feed so had to increase the servings - I used 2 lbs of ground beef and enough ketchup to get the right consistency - then just kept adding a little of each ingredient until it tasted right - i don't think there is any way you could mess this one up.  Fabulous week-night meal!

This is pretty good, but it needed some kick to it.  Instead of ketchup, I used a good hot salsa, a good Dijon mustard, added two cloves of fresh minced garlic, left out the onion powder and salt (since the salsa had onions and enough salt already).  Once that was all completed, there were no left overs after that.  Very quick and easy to make, if you are just to tired to slave in the kitchen.  I doubled the recipe, as the original just wasn't enough to feed a whole family.

I made this for a tailgate party.  Followed the recipe exactly, except that I multiplied it by 6 (three pounds of gr beef).  I received several compliments on it.  This is especially good to make if you have to please people who don't like to see onions and green peppers in their sloppy joes. This is in my permanent recipe box.

I doubled this recipe for three of us, added some chopped onions in with the hamburger meat, and probably used extra seasonings and a little extra ketchup and water, as we like our sloppy joes extra sloppy! This recipe makes a sweeter sloppy joe and its delicious. I added some cayenne pepper for some spice.

I've made these Sloppy Joe's many times now and love them.  I like to add pickle relish too.

This recipie was way too sweet for my family.  The 1 tablespoon of brown sugar is all we tasted.  I also agree with an earlier review.  This recipie made me very gassy!  Will not make again.

This was really tasty.  I've been searching for a sloppy joe recipe that doesn't call for onions and peppers (picky eaters) and this is perfect.  It's a little on the sweet side, so I'm going to experiment with cutting out or cutting down the brown sugar.  I doubled the recipe, since I had a pound of beef and it made plenty.  Made four sandwiches on standard sized hamburger buns and had enough left over that I could probably make two more.

My kids loved it!  My daughter thought it was too sweet, so I will probably omit or cut brown sugar in half next time.

The best part about this recipe was how easy it was to prepare.  It calls for every ingredient that you already have on the shelf!  I didn't change a thing in this recipe, and they turned out very good.  Thanks!

These are great!  I used 90% lean hamburger, didn't drain either.  I didn't simmer for 30-40 minutes, but I bet that's good!  I left the lid off for a while simmering, which cooked off some of the liquid.  Very, very good.  Thanks for the recipe.  (BTW, my family in PA always called these "Wimpies") - I had to add this little note:  I put this mixture on hot dogs!  And I call them Sloppy Dogs!!  It's very good - kind of like a Chili Dog, but sweeter.

Awesome! Much better than canned and I like canned. My husband said this gave new meaning to a sloppy joe sandwich. It's a keeper. I'll never use a can again.

I really liked these sloppy joes.  My son is picky about the canned sloppy joe mix and my husband doesn't care for them at all, but they both liked these!!  We will definitely be making them again, and I plan to share the recipe with friends!

Good basic recipe. I found that there was too much ketchup though to my liking. For 9lbs of meat [enough for about 40 people!], I only used around 5 cups of ketchup [recipe called for 8] and it was perfect. We made this in the crockpot and kept it on warm all night! The meat was browned on the stove, tossed into the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients, and left on high for around 30 minutes. It was almost all gone by the end of the night, and I got many compliments on it!

This recipe is wonderful for picky eaters.  My husband doesn't like onions or green peppers or any chunks in his sloppy joes.  I do make a few changes based on the preferences of my family.  I double everything but the meat and the ketchup.

This is a great recipe.  It mostly uses ingredients I always have at hand.  I play around with the ingredients everytime I make it and it always turns out great.  I added a little bit of liquid smoke the last time I made it and it was really good!

This was very tasty and made for a very satisfying dinner. It tastes alot like the Brown Sugar Meatloaf recipe, just a little less tangy. I made it with turkey, and instead of the 3/4 teaspoonspf the onion and garlic powders, I added a whole. Good enough to make again!

These were very yummy! I used ground turkey instead of beef and it was great. I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I used balsamic vinegar instead; I also used fresh garlic and onion instead of the powders.

FABULOUS! I added vinegar as some suggested. I added a dash of chili powder, and fresh chopped onions. This is so much better than Manwich which I'll never get again. Next time I'll halve the water. It's a bit too liquid-y, but that may be b/c I only had 1 tsp of mustard powder left. Had I had 2, it perhaps may have been a better consistency. Still, it tastes heavenly! Thanks again!! Yummmmm!

We had these for dinner and they were fabulous!  I did make a couple of changes.  I doubled the recipe, used granulated sugar instead of brown sugar (didn't have any), and omitted the mustard.  Also, I made this a few days ago, put it in a quart-size freezer bag, and froze it.  In the morning I put it on the counter to thaw and before dinner reheated it in the microwave.  I served it on buttered toasted buns. Delicious!  Way better than the canned kind.  Thank you.

This was a tasty and family friendly recipe.  We loved it!  I used less ketchup, then added tomato paste and vinegar to balance out the sugar.  I then thinned it out with V8 juice instead of water.  I also used garlic, pureed onion, bell pepper, and celery and added with the hamburger.  I sneak in as many veggies as I can for my young children, next time I will puree some spinach too.  They were so excited they did not find veggies in it and ate every bit of it.  thanks for the recipe.

I just made these for dinner. They were good but I felt as though they still needed some additional spices. I have another recipe that I got from this site that is alot better and always use but decided to give this one a try. I think I will stick to my ol stand by one that I have used for years.

Outstanding!!!  I made this last night and doubled recipe.  I was a bit worried about the Worcestershire sauce, but the small amount added a very subtile taste.  This is being added as a staple to our families menu options.

No more Manwich! EVER!! This was extremely easy to make and the entire family enjoyed it! I am not one to follow recipes to the letter - I added a can of tomato sauce, used less ketchup & brown sugar, and added chili powder.  I made 10 servings hoping for leftovers, but the 5 of us ate it all up!!!

I too am a former Manwich fan, but after tasting this recipe, I will never go back to the canned stuff again!  It was delicious and even my ten month old could not get enough!  The only thing I might do differently next time is brown the meat with some chopped onion and add a 1/2 tsp. or so white vinegar to balance out the sweetness.  I'm making myself hungry for more just thinking about it!  Delicious!

AWESOME!! I lost my mother's recipe that my family always asked for when we had parties. So I searched my favorite, and only, website for some kind of replacement. I never thought I'd find a recipe that everyone thought was BETTER than my mother's! This will now become our families (and there are 40 of us) ONLY recipe for sloppy joes! Thank you a million times! God Bless You!

Great recipe. I did a little alteration. I used one pound of hamburger. I took ketchup and BBQ sauce to fill to 1/2 cup. I left out the brown sugar.Turned out great and everyone enjoyed.

This is a good basic sloppy joe recipe.  It's a bit too sweet for me, but adding balsamic vinegar cuts back on the sweetness.  I also sometimes add pureed carrots to sneak some nutrients into this dish.

This recipe is fabulous.  I only made a few changes.  I substituted freshly chopped garlic and onions for the onion and garlic powder, and I used organic ketchup.

Had not had Sloppy Joe's in a long time so decided to make them last night with a tossed green salad on the side.
I did add a few things that were listed in a recipe from one of my cookbooks. I put in some chopped onion ( a suggestion from the book), garlic( which was of my own choosing) and sweet bellpeppers(from the book) and sense I didn't have onion and garlic powder, I replaced with onion and garlic salt, then eliminated the regular salt. I think I will make a smaller amount with out the peppers, because my picky eater saw them and wanted just the bun with no filling.

Didn't really like this recipe...the main flavor was ketchup! I thought it should've been more tomatoey and less sweet. I used real onion and garlic, and also added the tsp of chili powder. Don't think I will be making this one again.

Great recipe! I love to make this in conjunction with chili. My kids won't eat chilli, and my hubby doesn't like sloppy joes. When I make chilli, I reserve some of my cooked hamburger for a half batch of these. While the chilli is simmering I make this recipe.

It is an easy recipe that tastes great. The brown sugar and mustard give it a bit of a sweet and sour flavor that works well. My kids really like it, and so do I!

I left out some of the ketchup and added a can of pork and beans.  Pork and beans helps to stretch it, mellow the flavor, and is what my MIL did when DH was a child.

I used this recipe last night to feed our six children plus two of their friends who were over and the kids just about licked the pan! I, of course, modified the recipe but could have still made more because it was such a hit.  I added onion and a can of tomato paste as suggested by other reviews.  I will definately be using this again!

Great recipe!  I no longer have to rely on having a can of Manwich on hand (something I didn't buy often anyway).  I always have these ingredients on hand, so it's easy to whip up at the last minute.

I normally use Manwich but I thought I'd try it this way for something different. I thought it was wonderful but I'm only giving it 4 stars becuz the rest of my family didn't. I would suggest to anyone making this to use less brown sugar than directed becuz it was very sweet but other than that, it was really good.

Absolutely delicious!  I can't believe i ever bought this stuff in a can.  As others suggested, I added 1 tsp. chili powder and 1 tsp. white vinegar, then let it simmer for about 10 minutes.  Wonderful, quick, and easy!

I think this was a great base to start with.  I ended up doubling the recipe and adding diced onions, a couple of spoonfuls of pickle relish, and some hot pepper flakes for a bit of kick.  My boyfriend said that it wasn't his favorite, that it was too sweet for him.  I enjoyed the sweetness of the sauce, however.  It was better than the sauce you get out of a can and really wasn't much more trouble to make.  I'll be making this again with the modifications I added this time.  By the way, I only needed to simmer this for about ten minutes or so.  30-40 minutes is way too long for this.

Excellent and easy!  I love the vinegar and chili powder version best.  Have had lots of people ask for this recipe...even those who weren't sloppy joe fans before.  I made a huge batch and froze in quart bags to just thaw and serve later.

This is easily doubled. I took a reviewers recommendation and added vinegar. When I drained the ground beef, I mixed the other ingredients together in the pan and then returned the ground beef to the pan. I also added 1/4 cup of bbq sauce and a sprinkle of both chili powder and pepper flakes...enough for flavor but not enough for heat. I'd make this again. I think it is worth cooking 30 or so minutes to let the flavors meld and the sugar caramelize.

I made this last week for my husband and sister in law and we all loved it! I followed recommended advice and added 1 tspn of white vinegar and 1 tspn of chili powder & added fresh, slighty cooked  onions and it came out great! I can't wait to try it over mashed potatoes!

It was a hit with the whole family and that never happens!  I enjoyed how fast it was to make.  I didn't make any changes.  Thanks!

This recipe is great, even better with white vinegar (I used 1T, but you may prefer less).  I used ground buffalo and real diced onion instead of onion powder....PERFECT!!!!

I, too, added the tsps of vinegar and chili powder.  We all loved them.  Served on buns with a slice of sharp cheddar cheese on top.  Even my picky younger sister ate every bite :)

My family loved this recipe! The only change that I made was that I was worried about the sweetness so I put 3/4 the katsup and 1/4 BBQ sauce and also sprinkled in some chili powder.  It really was great. I might cut back on the water next time since it was VERY runny. GREAT recipe!!

Mmmmm.. .these were very good! I LOVE ketchup, so this recipe was dead on! However, I felt that it was a tad on a salty side.

A great "get-together" dish though!

Though quite sweet and heavily laden with ketchup, this sloppy joe recipe is awesome.  My young adult son was very complimentary.  Thanks, Laurie.  It's a winner.

This recipe is always a request. It's perfect.  I usually use 96 lean meat, but the last time I made this I used bison and it tasted just as good.

This receipe is fantastic!  Even my ultra picky 5 year old liked it!  The only problem I had was with the worcestershire sauce.  Since I doubled the receipe it was a tad strong.  Next time I just won't double the sauce.

These sloppy joes are wonderful!! The only thing I added was about a tablespoon of white vinegar just to cut the sweetness a bit, but that is only personal preferrance. My husband raved about them!!

Excellent recipe, much better than from a can or other recipes I have tried. I did omit the onion powder and just added some chopped onion and a green pepper. The beauty of it is that it is quick and easy with all the ingredients generally being, on hand.  I highly recommend it!

Honestly, it tastes about the same as the stuff in the can.  Good, though, when you're jonesing for sloppy joes.

I would prefer it a little sweeter, so would add a little more brown sugar.  This is personal preference, though.

YUUUM!! I LOVED this recipe as did my husband and picky 2 yr old.  We aren't fans of pepper and big chunks of onion so this was perfect for us.  I like lots of flavor and this was tangy/sweet/savory all in one!  I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and added the tsp of vinegar and of chili powder.  This is definately a keeper!!!

I made it exactly as recipe states.  It was pretty good, but next time I won't add quite as much ketchup.  I liked it best served on top of cornbread instead of in buns.  The best part was how simple it was to make!

Really good!  I doubled the recipe.  The only thing I may do different next time is use just a tiny bit less salt, other than that, these were great!

OK- standard fare. I doubled the recipe & used lean ground beef as always. A good recipe utilizing common pantry staples. The best thing? No chopping!!!

So easy and delicious! We absolutely loved this recipe. I was nervous it was going to be too sweet with the brown sugar, but it was perfect! Thank you for a great recipe!
