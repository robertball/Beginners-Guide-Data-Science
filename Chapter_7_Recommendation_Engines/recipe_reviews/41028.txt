This was a hit at a party. Most of my friends are chefs so I am always nervous when preparing dishes.  This is very spicy but its so nice!

Great recipe.  I took it to an outdoor Mexican dinner party and the shrimp won rave reviews.  I didn't have any leftovers.  I used Jalapenos to add heat to it.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I made it for a picnic and got rave reviews.  I marinated the shrimp for about two hours and it was fabulous. I did leave out the anaheim pepper and replaced it with sun dried tomato's that I chopped finely. I can't recommend this recipe enough as this is fantastic.

Wasn't that great...I used smaller shrimp *maybe the cocktail size and it was just ok, I did use the leftovers for making shrimp enchiladas which turned out excellent!

I fixed this recipes for my book club and everyone loved it. I had to print out the recipes for all of them. It is now my "signature" dish. Try it once and you'll be hooked forever.

Although I don't eat shrimp, my guests loved them.  My husband didn't find the anaheim peppers at the grocery store, so I added a little jalapeno sauce as a substitute.  Also, I used "busy mom's" shrimp that was precooked, deveined, etc. and let them marinade overnight.

This was very good.  I kicked up the heat using home grown red and green jalapenos.  In fact, I kicked it WAY up!  Note to self:  Next time less is more.  We loved it, but some guests shied away due to the sweat factor.  I will also add a little garlic salt...I think that will add nicely to the flavor.

I was so excited to try this and was so disappointed with the outcome.  It didn't have much flavor.  I followed the recipe to the tee and it just didn't do it for me.  I had to dunk it in hot sauce to give it some kind of flavor.  I will not try this again.

Enjoyed them and plus they were very easy to make.  I didn't use hot peppers but served them as a side to Beef Burito Pie (which is a little spicy) and together they were a HIT.

Made this for a dinner party as an appetizer.  Everyone loved it, especially my husband.  Takes a few minutes to de-vein the shrimp but the effort is worth it.  I used 12-15 count and the size looked great for presentation.  The flavors of this dish makes it a repeat!!!

I substituted the anaheim pepper with pablano pepper.  It was absolutely wounderful!  Everyone asked for the recipe. Easy to make and no leftovers.

I am not much of a shrimp fan, but made this appetizer for my family.  Next time I would marinade the shrimp a bit longer.

I have been making these for years.  Every time I ask what I should bring to a party it's always " THE SHRIMP!!"  I always double the garlic and use jalapenos (about 4 or 5) instead of the anahem peppers. This recipe never disappoints.

This recipe was okay, not a lot of taste.  I much preferred the Caribbean Holiday Shrimp recipe on this site.
