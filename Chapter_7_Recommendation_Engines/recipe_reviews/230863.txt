Doubled the recipe and it was a one-pan meal for myself and my squash-hating boyfriend who went back for seconds!  Then again, how can you go wrong with bacon, onion, and garlic?  Awesome way to use my CSA kohlrabi - thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious.  I had never cooked with kohlrabi before but the addition of bacon, onions and garlic made it really tasty.  I added sliced carrots only because I had some fresh from the garden.  Also a few red pepper flakes just to kick it up a bit.   Really nice combination of vegetables.

This was delicious, I have never eaten kohlrabi and my husband and I really liked it. I did not have any squash on hand, so made it with just the kohlrabi. I don't think it needs the bacon, maybe I will cook it in bacon grease.

Turns into a great one pan meal. I added some balsamic toward the end and then put some fresh Parmesan on before serving. Very good!

Got kohlrabi in my CSA and had no idea what to do with it. This recipe redeemed it. Doubled everything including the cooking time and added red pepper flakes. Great summer dish!

I was surprised by how much I liked this! I was out of onions, and just used onion powder and it was still really good. Will make again!

I had never used Kohlrabi, but like Zoobuffalo, had one from my CSA. I was low on white onion, so I also added a whole green onion. I also used precooked bacon and used sesame oil to make up for the less bacon fat. In lieu of yellow squash, I used pattypan squash, or some call it scalloped squash.  The recipe is very good. My husband loved it!
