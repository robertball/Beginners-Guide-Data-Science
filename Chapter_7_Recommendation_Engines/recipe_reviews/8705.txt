This recipe is easy and delicious!  The changes I made was to leave out the mushrooms, substitute cream of chicken instead of the mushroom soup (the BF hates 'shrooms), season the chicken before dicing, and add 1 1/2 c. cooked rice to the mixture before baking. The rice made it a more filling meal.  Next time, I will cut the sliced water chestnuts into smaller pieces.  They were a little big.

Just made this tonight and I can't stop eating it.  It is great.  I did use suggestions of others, added a few shakes of basil & parsley, also added a shake of garlic salt.  Added 1/2 block of low fat cream cheese cut into small pieces and about 3/4 c. shredded cheddar cheese.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used low fat/low sodium cream of celery - taste was great.  Also used low fat mayo.
Will make this again soon.

This was pretty bland, and we were kind of grossed out by the texture of all the water chestnuts.  If I were to make it again, I'd add sautee'd onions and maybe some garlic, sage, thyme or something to spice it up.

Delicious!  I love this recipe.  My grandmother used to make this and I have not had it in years.  The only thing I added was salt and pepper.  I'm so thankful I found this recipe!!  We will be eating it again soon!

I've served this so many times now with rave reviews every time.  I changed the topping to crushed soy chips to lower the carbs.  I've use canned chicken chunks for a very quick meal in minutes.

My daughter and I really liked this recipe but husband did not. He kept insisting I put nuts in the recipe?  (I did not.)  I even sauteed the celery first and eliminated the water chestnuts    to keep the crunchy taste to a minimum.   I have no idea where he was getting the nut thing?? I used onion crackers because that is what I had on hand. I made crescent rolls with it. My daughter loved dipping them into the chicken mixture.  Will make again. Thank you.

This is great! I did make a few changes though. I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise (personal preference). I omitted the mushrooms and water chestnuts. As others suggested I used 3/4 cup shredded cheddar, 4 oz. of cream cheese, about a tsp. each of parsley, basil, garlic salt, pepper, salt. I used italian bread crumbs instead of crackers because I was out of crackers. I also added about a 1/3 cup of diced red bell pepper and onion which gave it a great zip! I cooked the bell pepper, celery, and onion together to soften up the veggies before going in the oven. It turned out great!

This was a very good recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms and sauted them instead of canned.  I also used miscellaneous herbs and spices to enhance the flavor.

A easy and good recipe. Hubby and I both like it. It is what I would call "white bread" food but tonight that's what I wanted. :) I used fresh mushrooms; cooked them with the celery first and then put everything together. I will make this again and adapt it from time to time.

I think that this is a 4 1/2 the way I made it.  I didn't have water chestnuts, so I sauted 1/3 C chopped onions with celery in olive oil, added some garlic and then on the advice added a herb.  TRY TARRAGON! It was wonderful!

This recipe tasted like hot mayo with a cracker on top. The directions did not specify whether it should be covered when cooking and did not specify the amount of butter to use.

WOW Jeannied59, thanks for a great base recipe.  This is absolutely wonderful.  I have made it three times this past month and my family is asking for more.  The last time I mixed this wonderful combination over linguine noodles, put it all in a casserole and baked as directed.  A nice tossed salad and rolls made this a dinner I would be proud to serve my guests.  Way to Go Jeanne!!

great recipe. As per other suggestions I added rice to make dish more filling. Cream of chicken soup works well too. Will make it again, for sure.

This was great!  I didn't have cream of mushroom so I put in cream of celery. It was delicious! The best thing about this is you can add or take away something to make it how you want. Thank you for a great recipe!

This satisfied all the picky eaters at the table. I like the water chestnut crunch in it. I used one more chicken breast and fresh mushrooms. I served with mashed potatoes.

Don't think that I will use this recipe again.  It had a alright taste, but the celery was too crunchy and the recipe was just like eating cut up pieces of flavored chicken.  Needed more of something to make it a salad.

Very good!  the whole family (with picky kids) enjoyed it.  I did take the recommendations of others and added some garlic, onion, and used fresh mushrooms.  I love the crunch of the water chestnuts and may add some red pepper next time also. I also sprinkled some grated cheese on top.  So 5* with changes!

This was very good! I didn't know what to expect but I had to try it and I'm really glad I did! DH really liked this too.  I followed the recipe closely.  One review commented that they added red pepper in place of mushrooms - well we like mushrooms so I did use them in addition to a diced red pepper, I loved that with everything else. We will have this again  :)

Pretty good recipe. My husband loved it. He asked for more and more. I left out the water chestnuts because I didn't have any on hand. You can certainly vary this recipe to your liking. I seasoned the chicken with Season All before cooking and then added a little salt and pepper to the mixture before baking. I'll make it again for sure.

I had to tweak this a little due to lack of ingredients, I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo, I only had 1/2 a can of cream of mushroom soup, so I added 3 oz. of Philadelphia cream cheese, my husband doesn't like water chestnuts, so I chopped 1 c. of celery and then for kickes I added 1 1/2 tsp. of horseradish and about the same of crushed garlic.  It was DELICIOUS! I will definately make it again.

Was an excellent dish - we ate on it for days and my hubby doesn't narmally like leftovers! I added 1/2 block cream cheese, 2C shredded cheddar, sliced almonds, basil and parsley - and it was delicious.

I love this casserole, and so does my husband.  It's a great one to make earlier in the day and pop in the oven just before dinner, too.  I add a box of frozen chopped asparagas to the mix to add to the veggie content.  Delicious, filling, and quick.

Delicious! I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder, but otherwise made it exactly as written.

The recipe is ok but not great.  It could use some stronger flavored spices.  If I make it again, I might add some curry powder and garlic and would eliminate the mushroom soup.  I did not think it had the best texture.
