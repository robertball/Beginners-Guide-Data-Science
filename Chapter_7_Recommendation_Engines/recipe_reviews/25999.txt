I have a dessert business & several clients asked for a chocolate pound cake for the holidays.  After experimenting with several cookbooks, I tried Shelley's recipe.  What a success.  This cake is very moist, rich and has the best chocolate taste.  After making the cake 2-3 times, I made a few minor changes.  I cream the butter and sugar for 5 minutes (with stand mixer; longer with hand held mixer) and mix 30 seconds after adding each egg.  I can adjust the amount of coffee depending on the client, but 2 tsp is perfect.  I use a dark 12 cup, 10 inch bundt pan and have to reduce the baking temperature to 300 and bake for 70 minutes.  Occasionally, I bake the cake at 285 for 75-80 minutes and it is wonderful--no burning or dry chocolate taste.  I usally glaze the cake with one of the satiny chocolate glazes on this site or dust with powdered sugar.  It is fun to fill the center of the cake with either whole raspberries or strawberries and serve.  I agree with other reviewers that this cake is better the next day or even after refrigerating (wrap really well-the cake will pick up refrigerator odors).  It freezes beautifully.  Great recipe.

A great recipe!  I omitted the coffee and put in 1/4 cup extra buttermilk (I also made my own buttermilk with milk and lemon juice).  Cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup, it was pefectly sweet.  I used Ghiradeli's cocoa which added to the great flavor.  Frosted with my own white chocolate glaze and had this for Christmas Eve!

From all the reviews, I thought this cake would come out with a very intense chocolate flavor, but I was disappointed.  The chocolate taste was very mild.  The batter was delicious; I could have sat down with a spoon and a glass of milk and just eaten a bowl of it.  And I should have.  Although I followed the recipe exactly, and used a 10 inch bundt pan, the batter overflowed the pan during the baking process.  Luckily I had set the pan on a baking sheet, so I didn't have to clean my oven.  My husband asked me why I keep trying new recipes when my old standards are so much better.  I have rated this 2 stars because of the overflow problem, but regardless of the lack of chocolate flavor, it is, after all, cake, and certainly edible.  It won't go to waste, but I won't make it again.

I don't write many reviews, BUT...I thought I had the best choco pound cake recipe and I was wrong.  This is the absolute best cake I've ever eaten.  I put the satiny glaze recipe on it and yum... My husband the non desert eater has eaten more of it than any cake I've ever made.  Oh, and I'm diabetic so I've made it twice with splenda, 2 c. white and 1 c. brown sugar splenda and I think he likes that even better. Thanks.

This is the most amazing chocolate cake i've ever made, it's won hands down with all the family, so much so that i have numerous orders/ requests for more.  It is a dense almost fudge like cake with just a hint of coffee to give it a nice lift. 

I love this cake so much, i just had to come back to write more.

I recently thought, it is such a beautiful cake- I wonder if it would work as a vanilla/plain. I tried it, and no surprises, it is devine!!!

To make substitute the cocoa for an extra 3/4cup of flour, discard the coffee, but add between 1/4cup and 2T of hot water to the mix, keep everything else the same and voila you have a stunningly beautiful vanilla/plain cake that people will be raving about for ages.

The good thing about this cake also is that it keeps for days and still stays moist, just make sure you keep it in a sealed container, and if it's warm make sure you keep it in the fridge, especially if you are going ice it.

Trust me, you won't be disappointed in this cake!  Enjoy. =)

This is to die for. In a month, I baked it at least for 6 occasions. People want recipe and make me bake more! Mine only took about 45 minutes to bake however.  The cake has dense chocolate taste. I tried 1 teaspoon instant coffee in Bailey Irish Cream instead of water and use 3 teaspoons vanilla extract and half a vanilla bean. Also I use 1 cup milk and 1 tablespoon vinegar instead of buttermilk. It smells as delicious as it tastes. The cake is good by itself but it also works well with raspberry glaze...I stir no-sugar-added raspberry jam with some water, a teaspoon corn maize and gelatin over low heat and let cool a bit before spreading on top.  The cake is very good after one night in a refridgerator but some of my friends love it reheated in microwave as well...they said it's moist and delicious. I'm baking it again and again for sure.

Perhaps it's just a matter of individual palates and  taste preferences that explain the wide disparity of ratings and reviews for this recipe. I can only speak for myself and as far I'm concerned this is a less than mediocre cake, even tho' I'm sure it turned out exactly the way it's supposed to.  The cake is just mildly chocolate, first of all, and sort of a light milk chocolate in color.  When I want a chocolate cake I want CHOCOLATE, not some wimpy facsimile.  But that's not the biggest issue I have with this cake, which is that while it's moist enough it's just plain too dense. Compact is more like it, with virtually no crumb to it at all.  (Please note that I am very familiar with proper creaming technique) I think the solution might be to cut the butter back to just one cup, but for me, the cake didn't have potential enough to tinker with the recipe. Its saving grace was the chocolate ganache I topped it with.

I tried this first time this week but made it twice already (first with only two cups sugar, second with 2 1/2, which is just perfect for me.  I think 3 cups sugar is too sweet). I also sprinkled a few semi-sweet choco chips on top.  Other than those, I didn't change anything.  It's soft, it's really good and tastes better than other chocolate cakes.  try it!

This is truly the BEST chocolate cake I have ever had.  I used Valrhona 100% cacao, Plugra butter and 1/4 cup freshly brewed espresso.  I also decreased the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and used whole buttermilk.  This is very moist and chocolatey and definitely gets better the next day.  Just a simple dusting of powdered sugar is all it needs.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Made exactly as is. This cake was perfection. The women of the South judge their peers by their pound cakes. I am proud to say  (not being born and bred here) that I passed. ;)

Great Recipe.  My 10 year old daughter won 1st place at our County Fair this week, and the cake sold for $120 at the cake auction in the evening.

This cake was so wonderful. I did substitute sour cream for the buttermilk. It came out super moist this way. Also I did not have instant coffee so I used 1/4 of extra strong coffee that i had sitting in my pot from the day before. Make sure that you beat the butter and eggs until the color turns a pale yellow.(light and fluffy) I also put a glaze on it. 1 can of sweetened condensed milk, 8 baking squares of sweetened chocolate and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Melt the chocolate squares in the microwave, then add condensed milk and vanilla. Also it make be thick so just add cream or milk 1 tablesppon at a time until you like the consistency. Then pour over cooled cake...This is going to be a recipe I will make over and over! 5 stars anyday! Many compliments

I have to say that this cake is definitely dense!  It's like brownies in a bundt pan. We loved it and will be making it again and again.

Bakers have been having trouble with this cake recipe, which is in my Hershey's Cookbook, because the instructions are incorrect.  Use either a 12 cup Bundt pan or a 10" tube pan.  Bake it for 1 hour and 20-25 minutes.  Use a cake tester which is long, not a toothpick which is too short. If you make these changes, you will have the perfect chocolate pound cake.

Ok, this was a delicious recipe but I was concerned when I read others comments.  When I looked over the ingredients I realized that the baking soda was off if you are not using buttermilk because buttermilk has a rising property when used with baking soda.  So I increased baking soda to 1 tsp and took salt to 1/4 tsp, which is what my lemon poppyseed pound cake uses.  Baked for 55 min. at 350 and the cakes still fell in the middle even though they were done.  I think I will use more flour next time, as other recipes with this much wet ingredients uses 3 cups and update.  Tasted wonderful and was not dense and I will make again.

This cake was not a pound cake; it was a brownie. It was way too dense and chewy.  It had no loft nor crumb like one would expect with a "cake".  The taste was mediocre at best. The chocolate flavor was too delicate and it just needed a little something extra.  I followed the recipe exactly and I am truly disappointed.

This was so incredibly moist! I made this in a bundt pan using bold coffee brewed at home, and when the cake was cooled, I used a white chocolate brandy glaze to drizzle over the top. Everyone loved it and devoured it, even though it was after a large thanksgiving dinner. Will make this again.

I have made this cake at least 5 of 6 times because everyone keeps requesting it.  It is fabulous!!  It does need longer bake time (1 1/2 hours) and I beat the butter and sugar a full 5 minutes before adding the eggs.  The coffee enhances the flavor of the chocolate - you cannot discern the coffee at all. My most requested cake.... try it!!!!

Used this recipe several times.  Made a Barbie Doll cake for my daughter and a volcano cake for my son. Very rich dense cake that everyone loved. It held it's shape well and had a great chocolate flavor. I did substitute almond extract for some of the vanilla.  It does taste better and better if you can leave it set a overnight.

I added 1 stick of sweet cream butter, 1/2 tsp baking powder reduced salt 1/2 tsp. All of the cold ingredience were brought to room temperature before using. I baked it for the full 70 minutes let it rest in the pan for 25 minutes and it turned out wonderful! Drizzled with chocolate glaze while it was still warm.

From all the reviews, I was getting ready for an awesome cake. I made seperate ones for a pumpkin cake for my son's birthday party and both came out exactly the same. My guests were not oooing and aweing when they were eating this. I quickly found out why. It has hardly any chocolate taste to it at all. It's dense, but not moist. I was soooooo embarrassed! Why does it have such a high rating? Grrrr....NEVER AGAIN.

The cake turned out really good, I used a little more butter and a little less sugar than the recipe called for and it was great. I only gave it 3 stars because I was really looking for a chocolate pound cake and this cake tastes exactly like a brownie. Good but now what I was looking for.

I don’t usually report my flops but I thought I should warn hopeful bakers before I try this recipe again.  It was a hot mess!  It started out promising... the batter was light and fluffy; it smelled great as it was baking.  I took it out of the oven after 60 minutes because the tooth pick came out completely clean.  The cake was tall and beautiful.  So far so good. I looked away for 5 minutes and when I turned back to the cake, it had fallen to half its original height :(.  Who stuck a pin in my cake and deflated it!?!?  When sliced, the bottom half of the cake looked fudgy and half-done. The top half was dense but tasty. I will try it again... perhaps it needs more flour? Longer cooking time?  I’ll write an update with the results of take 2.
UPDATE - TWO WEEKS LATER: I tried it again, let it bake 1 1/2 hour, same results...a fallen cake (but a great chocolate flavor).  I guess this one just isn't for me.  If you try it, good luck.  If it doesn't work out, try "Easy Chocolate Chip Pound Cake" on this site.

I made this in a hurry for company coming from the airport-- I knew I wouldn't have time to frost it because my company would be arriving when the cake came out of the oven.  I had chosen it because of the idea in presentation; too often chocolate cakes can be pretty scary looking.  I did get a bit scared when I noticed it FELL during cooling, but I turned it out onto a plate and it was fine.  Incredible, actually.  I swirled some chocolate sauce on a plate, added the slice of this awesome cake, and dusted it with powdered sugar.  My company even asked for the recipe.  One note, I did substitute hot water for the coffee, as I had a younger child to please, and he wouldn't have appreciated a mocha taste.

This cake was such a hit that I was bombarded by requests for the recipe. I even use it for catering jobs, and every time someone asks for the recipe! Served with a little rum flavored whip cream and raspberries and it is to die for!

This was an extremely easy cake to make. Turned out very yummy! I decorated it with raspberries and drizzled 3 types of melted chocolate. Would definitely serve again.

I made this cake for my friends birthday and she loved it! Its definitely pound cake, not a light and crumbly cake, its thick and rich. I topped it off with ganache and Oreo cookies. Big croud please, but if your feeding it to little kids, not at a night because they'll be bouncing off the walls after!

Excellent!  I have made this 2 times now.  Everyone loves it!  I made the recipe as stated.  I must say you need to grease the pan with Crisco.  I greased it the first time with butter and it really stuck.  With Crisco, it came out great.  I also made a mixture of 1/3 cocoa and 2/3 flour to dust it with.  Came out beautifully. I drizzled a satiny chocolate glaze (found on this site) on top

This cake was delicious! I actually stuffed it up (I think...) and it still turned out incredibly tasty! You can't get buttermilk where I lived so I used a recipe for a buttermilk recipe I found online. The cake was a bit soft and it was more like a brownie inside but everyone really liked it! Next time I make this I will probably do the same thing. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I made this cake after reading the reviews and I took plenty of time to beat in the eggs one at a time.  I did such a good job that it overflowed my 10" bundt pan!  Very rich and dense.  This is one of my husband's favorites.  We took one to his mother for Valentine's Day and everyone really loved it.  This is such a nice cake it presents nicely as a gift.  Thanks for the recipe!

OMIGOSH, Shelley! This cake rates a perfect 10!Its incredibly delicious! Perfect for the chocolate lovers out there. Not too sweet, very moist and dense. The amount of instant coffee doesn't appear to make much of a difference in this recipe. My first cake I put in 2t instant coffee as per instructions, next cake I used 4t instant espresso powder. Thought that much might bring the coffee flavor to the forefront. But it didn't.It seemed that it merely enhanced the chocolate flavor, but there was still no hint of the coffee flavor I was looking for. Go figure! Anyway I will be making this cake again and again. Thanks Shelley!

Moist and delicious, and a little goes a long way. You can get more than 16 servings out of this cake. It stores well, and remains moist after several days. You won't have to worry about the cake drying out before you can finish it.

Yum!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used it to make a 3D train cake (Wilton pan).  I had enough left over to make 3 cupcakes (baked about 30 minutes) and just tasted one.  It was great.  The train looks good, dense enough to stand up properly, and I anticipate it will taste just as good as the cupcake.

What a wonderful recipe I used to make for my fondant cake. It was dense and supported my 1.5 kg fondant topping well but yet not hard. The chocolate was easy to cut and melts into the mouth. Fantastic tasting after I tailored the recipe a little. 

I didn't want the coffee granulates and so I followed "What a Dish's" comment by omitting the coffee granulates & hot water and put in 1/4 cup extra buttermilk. Most of my customers also like recipes that are not sweet so i cut down the sugar to 320 gm. To ensure that the cake is dense but not hard, I separated the egg white and egg yolk. I beated the egg white with about 30 gm of sugar. Separately, I beated the egg yolk with 30 gm of sugar. I folded the egg yolk into the butter mixture, then folded the white into the mixture, and finally folding the flour and buttermilk in 2 portions.

  Cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup, it was pefectly sweet.  I used Ghiradeli's cocoa which added to the great flavor.  Frosted with my own white chocolate glaze and had this for Christmas Eve!

I used this recipe to make a marble pound cake to stack, carve, and cover with fondant. I made the recipe twice in each flavor, for a four-layer 10" square cake and had a little left over for a loaf for the family. For the vanilla part of the cake, I used 2 3/4c. flour. I didn't have buttermilk, so I added 1T. white vinegar to 1c. whole milk. The cake was extremely moist! Next time I would add a little more sugar, as it wasn't quite sweet enough for me, but my family thought it was just the right sweetness. They loved it, and so did the customer I made the cake for.

This cake is delicious - very moist and rich! I only used 2 cups of sugar because most desserts are too sweet for my family's tastes. Its sweetness suited us perfectly! I also used dark cocoa powder.

I obviously didn't butter the bundt pan well enough because when I turned the pan upside down, the middle part fell out. It was my first time making one, so I'll know better next time. I usually make muffins out of all sweet breads and cakes, but I wanted something more fancy-looking for guests. Delicious! :o)

I was looking for a sturdy cake for a stand up cake.  Unfortunately this cake did not rise much so it didn't fill the top of my pan.  I followed the recipe except for cutting back on the sugar since I was going to frost it.  It has an ok flavor and dense texture.  I won't be bake again unless it was specifically requested.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I've made. I baked it in regular round cake pans for a truly divine layer cake. This cake was dense enough to hold up to fondant decorating and it tasted wonderfully moist! Definitely a keeper!!

Oh. My. Goodness. This was quite possibly one of the best cakes I've ever tasted, and that's no small feat. Being chocoholics, my husband and I topped it with a chocolate ganache, but honestly it didn't need it. It was perfectly moist all by itself. Also, we omitted the coffee and simply added the hot water with 1/4 cup more cocoa and it was perfect. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

Wonderful pound cake. Incredibly moist and yes, it's dense-- it's a pound cake for goodness sake, it's supposed to be! Anyone complaining about the density must not know what a pound cake is supposed to be like. I did add a heaping Tbsp extra cocoa, and used instant espresso since it's what I had on hand. It didn't remind me of a brownie at all, and wasn't tough or greasy on the outside as a few others experienced. Glazed with the satiny chocolate glaze from this site. Amazing.

This is the best chocolate pound cake ever. I had a recipe for chocolate pound cake from high school umpteen years ago that got lost in a move. I must say this is much better. I made this for my son to take on a long road trip and it barely made it to Florida from East Texas. It has such a rich taste and the texture also was just right. I kept a portion for myself and it stayed moist for about 4 days. Thanks so much for this recipe.

I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used a cup of soy milk instead. I also didn't use coffee - I used some creme de cocoa liquor - about 1/3 cup. It's very tasty!

I'm giving it three stars - for now.  I'll try this one again because the taste was so wonderful.... but the bake time given was inadequate, and when I finally did take it out, the whole thing fell while cooling.  I followed the recipe precisely, but never did get a clean toothpick and decided after tasting that this must be similar to a tunnel-of-fudge cake, always moist in the very middle.  But I was still left with a crusty veneer of cookie on the top, suspended over a 1" layer of air before the cake actually began. (Maybe the coffee needs to be cooled before adding?)

Very nice chocolatey flavour. This is a dense, almost browney-like cake. I added a couple extra teaspoons of baking powder to try and make it a bit fluffier and it seemed to give a bit extra lift. Next time I might cut the sugar a bit though, 3 cups is a lot! I served it with orange buttercream icing - yummy!

I bake for my coworkers once a week, and they pronounced this cake the best thing I've ever made.  My convection oven runs pretty cold -- I don't think it made it up above 300 degrees the whole time, and I had to leave it in for 90 minutes (covering the top with aluminum foil after about 30 minutes).  But the cake wound up with a slight crust on the outside, and perfectly fudge-like on the inside.

I have to say i really didn't like this pound cake.  I love a dense moist cake, but i didn't like the texture or the flavor of this one.  It's very sweet - but not particularly chocolatey, and the texture is a little beyond dense - i can't think of the right word.  It's too much.  I won't make this one again.

I am not an expert baker.  Actually, this is my first ever cake from scratch!  It was more than I had hoped for!  I took it to a church dinner and people were raving over it!  I went by the recipe exactly as written.  Absolutely no problems.  Delicious!

I am a novice cake maker and have no explanation for why this cake tasted bad and not like a pound cake, fell in the oven, and completely broke apart coming out of the pan. Extremely disappointed.

This cake is wonderful.  The only change I made was to substitute 4 oz. melted baker's chocolate for the coffee (I don't like the flavor of coffee in my chocolate cakes). Please note that the flavor and texture of this cake changes (for the better) overnight, so plan on making this a day before it is actually  needed.  I only gave it four stars because the texture of the cake, while moist and great, is not what I would consider the texture of a true pound cake to be.

Absolutely wonderful. Wasn't a crumb left after dinner. Easy. Moist, dense great chocolate taste. I used special dark cocao, made sure the eggs and butter were room temp. Beat the sugar and butter until very light and fluffy then added the eggs one at a time and beat well into the dough. I also used a quarter cup of brewed espresso. Well greased and floured the pan and it came out like a charm. Only thing was that it was almost too much. My bundt pan was just a hair from overflowing. Also it fell a very tiny bit when a friend poked the top to test for doneness. Excellent recipe and one I will make over and over if my family's reaction was any indication.

Absolutely delicious!  Everyone loved it.  So very moist and chocolaty.  I used dutch processed cocoa and 1/4 c coffee rather than water and grounds.  I baked it in little individual molds for about 30 minutes.

Now this is one of the best pound cakes that I have ever made and or eaten. It is rich, and extremely and I mean extremely good. Although a bit time consuming it is easy to make, and baked in my oven at exactly 60 minutes. I did however make a few changes such as, cake flour instead of all purpose flour, and instead of dusting with confectioners' sugar I applied a to kill for chocolate glaze. Well anyway thanks for the recipe, and I'll definitely be making this one again. Till next time, peace!

This is a very good recipe.  Nice and moist.  It is dense but not heavy, and it takes a glaze quite well.  It wasn't crumbly and held together nicely, with a good flavour.

I have never had such good chocolate cake. It was moist and rich and WONDERFUL!! I didn't have and cocoa powder, so I used unsweetened chocolate and reduced the butter to 1 1/4 cups. 1 square is equal to 3 Tbsp powder + 1 Tbsp butter. Per the review that suggested reducing the temp, I lowered the temp to 300, but it took 1 hour 40 minutes to cook. I will be following the recipe cooking instructions for next time.

I don't have a bundt pan, so I used two regular loaf pans.  I also used real coffee that was rather strong.  The cake came out absolutely perfect.  Chocolate pound cake is my favorite and this one was extremely moist and delicious.  I topped a slice with strawberries in balsamic vinegar and it was absolutely heavenly.  The only down side?  It is utterly possible to eat the entire thing yourself and stab anyone who attempts to eat it also.

The only changes I made were to use a little over 2 cups of Splenda. I agree that the cake is not as chocolatey as I'd like, but it does smell and look great. The texture is good--very moist--and the outside is not hard. I also found the cake a little too oily. I would make this again, but with some changes to make it more chocolatey and less oily. EDIT: After two days, the cake does taste more chocolatey; however, the texture became more brownie-like as well. It's almost like a Bundt-shaped fudgey brownie; however, I like chocolate cake to be like cake, and the flavour improved only a little. I would probably not make this again.

I used this for the cake in a chocolate trifle...  wish I could have just cut it into pieces and ate with some cold pitchers of milk!!(a good drown your sorrows cake!!)  hee hee thanks...(one thing, baking time will vary depending on your oven--mine took quite a bit longer to bake)

I'm giving this four stars because of the problems I had.  The taste and texture I would give 10 stars if I could.  However, I'm made this three times and each and every time I can't get it out of the pan (no matter if I use butter and flour or parchment paper) without sticking and breaking up.  Perhaps it's something I'm doing wrong.  The other problem I ran into was the cooking time.  The first time I made it, I kept it in for 70 minutes, let it cool only to find the inside only partially cooked.  I ended up having to keep mine in at 325 for 1 hour and 35 minutes to get it to cook right.  Other than that, the cake is unbelieveable in taste and extremely moist.  I've never tasted a better chocolate pound cake.

I followed exact & cake turned out good. I have to agree with other reviews, it just isn't that rich in chocolate flavor. Next time I will for sure add 1/2 cup melted chocolate chips, otherwise good recipe! Freezes well.

My guests and I enjoyed this cake very much.  It was dense and had a rich chocolate taste.  I served it with powdered sugar sprinkled on it.  However, as one other reviewer wrote, it is slightly greasy on the outside with a little bit of a tough shell.  I give the flavor 5-stars and the texture 4-stars.**** I would like to add that the cake improved on the second day.  The texture and flavor were even better.

This cake is extremely fudgy. I made it into two 8" layers (to make two separate desserts). I served one immediately and wrapped the other (plastic wrap, foil, and ziploc bag) and froze it. Both were delicious served with just a light sprinkling of confectioners' sugar.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! 
The recipe was perfect- the cake wasn't too rich and it was just chocolatey enough. It was really easy to make, and the compliments I received were almost as sweet as the cake itself! 
When I served it, all I did was dust the top with confectioner's sugar, and I served fresh fruit with whipped cream on the side. 
I will definitely make it again! Soon!

Incredibly moist, delicious, perfect chocolate taste! Easy to make, once you've assembled the roster of ingredients.  Be sure to make this one to three days ahead of serving time.  Wrap well, chill, and then remove from the 'frig about an hour before serving.  Enjoy with powdered sugar and fresh strawberries.  Truly divine!

I made this cake yesterday and have to let everyone know how GOOD it is.I decided to do half a recipe so put it in a loaf pan. Used one and one third cups sugar,made my buttermilk by putting one tablespoon white vinegar in a half cup measure and fill I it almost to a  half cup,I saved enough room in the cup to add 2 tablespoons cooled brewed coffee and omitted the instant coffee. Used three eggs...also when you beat the sugar and eggs,really beat the heck out of it,with my hand mixer I beat it on high for about four and a half minutes and beat after each egg about a half minute,after reading another reviewers tip..this process comes in handy for a lot of cakes,it DOES make a difference so don't rush this part. Also being half recipe I didn't bake quite as long. My cake did split on top but this always makes it taste better to me and looks pretty. Also this cake doesn't need icing,is sweet enough without it and moist also. It has almost a brownie taste..I have a couple of favorite chocolate cake recipes and this one is joining them..thanks for posting this recipe.

By far the best chocolate cake I've ever made. I boiled coconut milk and rum instead of water to make the coffee. I think I'll use decaf next time to avoid the caffeine.

This was the first home made pound cake I have baked. It is by far the best pound cake I have ever had. I guess you could say that I recommend this recipe. Top with some of your favorite vanilla bean ice cream.

This recipe deserves 4 stars as is. I made it a second time with the following changes, I omitted the coffee and used 1/4 cup extra buttermilk as another reviewer suggested, and I substituted 1 tsp of vanilla with almond extract, then topped with a chocolate glaze (also with almond extract in place of vanilla). With these changes this is the most moist and delicious chocolate cake I've ever tasted and made. It's also good with chopped walnuts and coconut sprinkled on top. Thank you for the great base recipe!

OMG! If this cake gets any better the second day I eat it, I will certainly float up to heaven! This is truly the best chocolate pound cake recipe I have ever made. (And I am constantly looking for the perfect chocolate pound cake recipe.) It has a nice crispy outside and a moist, tender, fudgy interior. I made it as written making sure to use room temperature ingredients. I added 3/4 cup semisweet choc chips to the batter at the end of mixing. I baked in a bundt pan on my convection setting at 300 degrees for 75 min. After I took it out I sat it on top a warm wet kitchen towel & cooled it for 20 min which helped it better release from the pan. Then I made a choc glaze over a low heat by using melted butter, canned milk, p sugar, choc chips and vanilla. After drizzling cake w the glaze I sifted p sugar over it. This cake is AMAZING!

Oh boy oh boy! This is the ultimate chocolate cake. You know that something tastes great when your guests ask to take a piece home :)
So delicious, so moist, so chocolaty! Don't omit the coffee it adds a great subtle taste. I made cupcakes using this recipe and they also tasted great. 
Thank you for a PHENOMENAL recipe!

This came out really dense but it was too moist. could have been something I'd done, I'm not sure. It tasted really cocoa-ey too, I most likely will not make this again.

I wanted a cake that would be dense enough to hold up lots of decorations (including a chocolate tree), and this worked great. I used two 9 inch round pans and baked for only 50 minutes. Tasted delicious.

This recipe is easy and the results are spectacular! It is truly a pound cake - buttery and dense - with a mocha flavor that is not too overbearing. 
I didn't change a thing and my family loved it! I topped it with the satin chocolate drizzle, another recipe I got from this site. Enjoy!

I bake weekly for my husbands chocolate addicted co-workers and this is their new favorite! They loved this with a simple ganache frosting filling the center and drizzles over the top and sides! 

I used 1/4 strong coffee from my keurig, and a 1/2 teaspoon of almond.

Delicious. I have been looking for a chocolate pound cake recipe that will be as good as my mothers - this one is very close. It is dense so it's difficult to get through a big piece. I will probably add a couple of minutes to cook time. Even though a toothpick came out clean, I think some additional time in the oven would have helped. It was a little too gooey in a small area. I am not deterred though, I will make this again and again.

Just put this in the oven.  It was super easy to make, but was the consistency of soft serve ice cream and that's after I added another tbs of buttermilk.  I hope it turns out ok.  Really looking forward to it.

Very good chocolate pound cake. I did beat butter for 2 min., then sugar for 5 min. and baked at 300 for 85 min. and it turned out great. I also added a chocolate glaze. Much better with age so prepare the day before.

This cake was awesome!! It is so moist. I only made two modifications. I added two sticks of butter instead of 1 1/2 and used instant cocoa mix instead of the coffee. That really added a boost to the chocolate flavor. Bravo!!

This was a great cake! Very moist. It doesn't have a rich chocolate flavor which is fine because I drizzled some melted  chocolate on top which made this a 5 star recipe.

I made this cake for two birthdays recently, and it got rave reviews at both!  I used 1/4 cup espresso instead of the graunulated coffee.  Also, the first time I made it, an emergency came up part way through putting the cake together, so I refrigerated the wet batter and mixed everything together hours later.  It didn't rise as much, so was even more of a pound cake, but was still delightful!  I found it is topped nicely with equal parts whipped cream (real!) and sour cream, with some raspberries.   I want to use this for my wedding cake, so will soon be making one to freeze; will write back with a review on how that goes!

I was really excited about this cake. I even added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and a few TBSP cherry pie filling. It stuck to my Bundt pan terribly!! I spend a lot of time and money on this recipe and am very disappointed. I took the advise of even trying to use Crisco to grease the pan and it still stuck:( I'm glad I was only experimenting and not planning on presenting it. The whole top was demolished. I wish the recipe included how to not make it stick. Butter and flour simply doesn't cut it. Taste is okay, but for me presentation plays a significant role.

OMG this was wonderful,My mother-n-law asked me or a Chocolate Pound cake for mothers day. I have tried one once before and it was a disaster so I came here searching and decided on this one. She is a HUGE food critic and she LOVED LOVED LOVED this cake. The only thing I did different was I added a 1/4 cup melted choc. chips to the batter last. I cooked it 70min and that was perfect. It had a wonderful taste and texture. I will be making this one again. One tip make sure you have a big enough pan I have a bundt pan that holds 12 cups to the rim, I used a bigger tube pan and thank the lord I did because I would have had a huge overflow.

An amazing cake! I bake it all the time, even used it to make my friend's wedding cake. It's moist, dense and has lots of chocolate flavour! It stays well and doesn't dry out, goes well with many kinds of frostings, but also tastes great all by itself. LOVE IT!

Wonderful dense cake. Very filling. I used coffee liqueur and a little bit of tequila in place of the coffee. Wonderful. Definitely try to let the cake sit for at least a day before eating. Doesn't really need any kind of topping but powdered sugar looks nice. Also good days later microwaved with a little ganache or chocolate syrup.

Moist and delicious. Made exactly as recipe but lessened the sugar to 2C. Used a 10" non-stick bundt pan and mine was done in 50 minutes(at 145 degrees celcius). Used a simple glaze on it. Put on double boiler a bar of chocolate(any flavour), 50g butter, 4 tblsp milk and a handful of sugar. When everything has melted just stir till smooth and pour on cake. Heavenly!!!

Update- Made this again yesterday, but used 3 packed cups brown sugar. Just as good! Now I'm thinking of making this into cupcakes.

This was OK but certainly not the chocolate cake to end all chocolate cakes that I was expecting from the reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly including the mixing suggestions by one of the reviewers (butter & sugar for 5 mins, plus 30 seconds after each egg).  If I hadn't glazed this, I don't think we'd have bothered to eat it.

This is everyone's favorite!  I made this cake last year for Thanksgiving and got a request to make it again this year.  Very moist and chocolaty...  This is a dream cake for a chocolate lover!!  : )

I love this pound cake! It's dense, moist, chocolatey... and the instant coffee was a nice enhancer. Maybe next time I'll put in even more for a java cake. ;) Definitely making again.

I've made this a couple of times now, and people swore it was the best cake they'd ever had. I didn't have instant coffee, so I tried subbing in Irish Cream the first time and Kahlua the second, both of which worked well. I substituted almond flavoring for the vanilla, which I think makes the finished product a little more flavorful, and didn't have buttermilk so did the vinegar/milk thing.

The very BEST Chocolate pound cake I have EVER ate.  Everyone raved about it, and wanted the recipe.  It was so good, I told them that it was a secret, and I'm keeping it for myself!!!!  ******This cake will be heavy - very heavy.  If you think it isn't done, it probably is.  Since I posted that last great review, I've fixed it three more times.  Twice it didn't come out the way it should, but the other time it was perfect.  Why the difference?  Everything was EXACTLY the same.  So....it appears it is a very fickle cake, but very good.  The 2 x it didn't come out right, it was still scarfed down within two days.

This was a fantastic cake that I made for the first time under high pressure (birthday cake for my mother-in-law) :-D I made it an orange chocolate cake by replacing the coffee with orange juice, adding the zest of one orange and substituting orange extract for vanilla. Both the orange and chocolate flavors came through well and it was moist and delicious! I made an easy glaze by microwaving a jar of orange marmalade and pouring over the cooled cake.

The cake was near bland, like a washed out chocolate flavor. I used Ghirardelli cocoa powder, so I know it was not due to not having quality ingredients. I thought the coffee would enhance the chocolate and give it depth, but sadly, it did nothing of the sort. I am very disappointed with the outcome and will never make this recipe again. I made a chocolate ganache to pair with it to make up for the lack of flavor. If you are looking for an extremely light flavor, this is it. It wasn't what I was looking for.

Excellent cake.  I think you could actually use one cup of cocoa if you really want a dark chocolate.  I have made this many times, and now throw in a cup of mini-chocolate chips.  As is, it's a 5-star recipe, and w/additions it's equally great.  Thanks for the posting.

This recipe did make a good chocolate pound cake!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the instant coffee granules. That is something I never have on hand so I used my instant espresso powder instead and it did give it a rich flavor.  I did not use a Bundt pan, but instead used 2 loaf pans.  The cake comes out pound-cake dense like it is supposed to.

This was just ok for me.  I needed a chocolate pound cake for a 3-D cake pan for one of my kid's birhtday parties and I tried this recipe after reading the spectacular reviews.  The taste is great, but not over the top; however, I made two batches of this cake and tried it in several different cake pan, each time the cake fell in the middle.  I think most of them are salvageable (kids won't notice once they are all decorated) but I am dissapointed.  The next time I make a chocolate pound cake, I will try a different recipe.  Good, just not great.

If you like a dense chocolate cake this is a great one.  Take the cocoa powder up to 1 cup if you really want heavy chocolate flavor.   I took this up another notch by using the chocolate ganache recipe for icing.   Yes, that seems over the top but you only need a sliver so it can feed a lot of people.

This cake was decent. The coffee taste was too noticable for me (a non coffee drinker) and I don't believe this cake could hold up on it's own without a frosting or glaze. I tried to use just fruit and confectioner's sugar and it was not great. I actually ended up having to throw away the leftovers that were just sitting in my fridge, untouched. Maybe it just wasn't for me! :)

I liked this cake & had fun making it. It is more dense than I expected for a pound cake. Greased pan with Crisco and floured with cocoa powder - no issues coming out of pan. After 60 min toothpick was not clean. Gave 10 more min & pick was clean, however there was a fudgy layer running thru near the top. Maybe it needed a bit more time?

I had never made a chocolate pound cake before and this one came out great! Though I did dust it with confectioners' sugar for a nice presentation like it said, but the cake was so moist all the sugar soaked in, so that didn't last long. Though I think I might try to add a glaze or chocolate chips to add a bit more chocolate flavor next time.

This was the best chocolate pound cake I've ever had. I added 1/2 cups of chocolate chips to the recipe and my family loved it. I did have problems getting the cake out of the pan, even though I buttered and floured the pan thoroughly.

This bundt cake came out great.  I reduced the recipe to 12 servings since I did not need 16 servings and used 3 entire eggs.  I did not have buttermilk on hand so I added a tsp of lemon juice to fat free milk instead. I let the cake sit in the fridge overnight and topped it with a chocolate ganche, fresh strawberries, raspberries, powdered sugar, and served it with raspberry sauce.

This cake is absolutely fab, but a little rich the way it is described.  I didn't have 5 eggs so I used three, and instead of using 3 sticks of butter I only used 2 trying to be a little figure friendly!  I baked for about an hour and a half in a gas oven at the suggested temp.  My cake turned out great even with the changes.  I served with chocolate sauce and raspberries.  MMMM!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous. I was looking for a rich chocolate cake that would hold up well to decorating, and this was exactly what I had hoped for. The only things I did differently was I used a dark cocoa powder and strong brewed coffee not instant. This cake tastes like the most awesome brownie you ever put into your mouth only its cake!!!It is very dense and moist, yet holds up well and is not too crumbly. A++++

While this cake was definitely moist, I guess I was just expecting a little more from this cake with all the positive reviews...I did cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, but followed the rest to a tee. My husband ate a piece as soon as it cooled and said it was "alright". I wrapped the rest up and refrigerated overnight (as suggested by other reviews), tasted it today and it still tasted just "okay" to me. I used some more expensive ingredients to makes this cake so I don't want to just toss it - I plan on making a glaze or something to give the rest of the cake a little more flavor.

Wonderful cake,I used my pampered chef bundt stoneware , it took a little longer than the 70 minutes, i had to bake it for another 8 minutes due to the stoneware. Came out fantastic... I decorated it with white chocolate covered strawberries and powdered sugar. Stored in fridge overnight and served it the next day, some reviewers stated it tasted better the next day and it did.
thanks for sharing

Ok I made this over the weekend and wasn't too impressed with the flavor but LOVED the moist texture.  Anything chocolate has to sit for a day or two to allow the great chocolate flavors to come out so wait I will.  This recipe is promising though and next time for me I will add in an ounce or two of melted chocolate to enhance a better chocolate flavor.  I did add a handful or two of mini choc chips as well.  I love my chocolate so I guess I expect a intense chocolate taste-if you like a mediocre choc taste-this is for you.  Oh-My bundt is deeply hidden so I had to improvise and I was able to make 3 loaves and the cooking time was like 50-60 minutes.  I did drizzle "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" over the top as well(I wasn't kidding about my love for chocolate)..Will make again trying the melted choc.

This was the worst cake I ever made. maybe because I substituted soymilk (plus and acide) for the buttermilk, but whatever the case, it was a waste of eggs, flour, sugar etc. the batter looked beautiful but otherwise a real waste.

AWESOME!  I made this for my colleagues at work and it came out great.  After reading reviews that said this was too much for a bundt/tube pan, I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a loaf pan and it was just the right amount.  I was worried about the instant coffee because I have a deep seated aversion to anything with even the slightest hint of coffee flavor but you definitely couldn't taste it in the batter nor in the finished cake.  I also folded in about a 1/2 c of semi-sweet mini-morsels before pouring it into the pan.  It's not cloyingly sweet but sweet enough.  Just the right amount of chocolate taste to satisfy chocolate lovers but not so much so that it turns off those who aren't that "into" chocolate.  It was super moist and the density was just perfect for a pound cake.  After it cooled, I dusted lightly with 10x confectioner's sugar for presentation.  I look forward to making this over and over and over!

I made this for Christmas and my family LOVED it! I followed the recipe exactly and I agree with other reviewers: it takes a lot longer than stated to bake. I left it in the oven a little over an hour and a half. It was delicious - just the right amount of chocolate and moist too.

This was very good the first time I made it, however it needs to be cooked longer than the recipe calls for. I added chocolate chips into the mix and it was so very good!

This was really good. I'll make it again. Changes I made, only used 4 eggs, used slightly under 3 cups sugar, real brewed coffee and white whole wheat flour. Baked to perfection in 70min.

This is better than any cake you'll find at the bakery because you can put the best quality butter, chocolate and vanilla and make a professional-tasting cake that everyone loves.  Thank you for this recipe!  I did decrease the sugar to 2 1/2 cups only because I didn't want it overly sweet, but followed everything else exactly.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday, and we all loved it.  Now I take it to potlucks and as a treat for classroom parties.  It's simple and pretty and really satisfies our sweet tooth.  It's especially lovely with fresh strawberries piled in the center.

This wasn't bad, but it didn't really have the texture of pound cake, and it wasn't as chocolatey as I'd hoped. I doubt I'll make this again, although it would probably be good served with strawberries and whipped cream.

I followed the recipe exactly to make this cake.  I have a lot of experience making cakes and found that it had a good chocolate taste, but also had a slightly greasy taste and was on the tough side which are not good characteristics of a good pound cake.

Very good.  The only things I did different was to substitute the 1/4 c. hot water for 1/4 c. warm Maraschino juice and add 2 cups of halved Maraschinos.  I also used another reviewer's recommendation of using almond extract instead of the vanilla.  This didn't last the day in our house. Both my husband and teenagers absolutely loved it!!!

I was looking for a different sort of cake to make for my birthday and this was great!  Being a college student i didnt have a bundt pan, so I used a loaf pan.  I had to bake quite a bit longer to get it done, but it turned out well!! I agree, it's definitely better after sitting for about a day.  I served with dark chocolate glaze, powdered sugar, and strawberries- it was a hit! Thanks!  I can't wait to try variations. :)

Excellent. Moist and rich. Needs no accompaniment. Instead of buttermilk, I used 1 cup non-fat milk with 1 tablespoon vinegar. I agree with others, this cake is best after it sits for a while.

A real delicious cocoa cake with no overpowering taste. This one is moist, sweet but not too much and looks really great. I had to bake mine a bit longer, about 90 minutes total baking time.

I baked this for my co-worker's birthday today and everyone absolutely loved it.  I decreased the amount of sugar to 2 1/2 cups of white sugar and since I didn't have buttermilk, I used a cup of half and half instead.  I also forgot to add the coffee but it didn't matter much.  Instead, to make it even richer, I swirled a raspberry cream cheese mixture and marbled it in and it was truly decadent!  I also made a raspberry chocolate sauce and drizzled on the slices of the cake as well.  Great recipe that can accomodate so many variations!

This was an excellent recipe! I received many compliments on it and have had many requests for the recipe...I did not have instant coffee in the house so I used strongly brewed hazlenut flavored coffee instead. I also add some mini chocolate chips to the batter. I will be making this one again! :)

I'm not a big chocolate cake fan, but my mom asked me to make one for her birthday.  I have to say that this was delicious!  It was very dense and not too sweet.  I wasn't sure about the coffee flavor, but I added it anyway.  I didn't really taste it.  I served  cold the next day, as others suggested.  It was absolutely wonderful!

I made this cake at 9 PM last night and it is almost gone! A real hit with the family. Very moist and the chocolate is not over powering. I made a powdered sugar glaze and drizzled it over the cake while it was still warm. We will make this cake again soon.

This is the best chocolate pound cake.  I made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly as written but did not add the coffee (hate coffee flavor) and added a chocolate ganache using another recipe on this site.  It was very good and everyone loved it with requests to make it at Christmas for our group's party.   But I thought it was a little light on the chocolate flavor.  So the second time, I increased the cocoa powder to 1 cup instead of 3/4 cup.  I liked the stronger chocolate much better in the second cake.  I didn't add the ganache this time because this was an experiment in adjusting the cocoa and the cake was just for my enjoyment.  It was perfect for my taste and doesn't need the ganache.  The cake is super moist, firm textured, dense  (it is a pound cake after all), and  very tasty.  Don't rush in preparing this.  Make sure eggs and butter (use the real stuff) are room temp.  Add the eggs separately and make sure to beat the heck out of the butter/sugar/eggs/vanilla before adding the dry ingredients.  It really makes a difference in the cake's texture.  But don't beat too long when adding the dry ingredients - just make sure everything is well blended.  Use real buttermilk and make sure you alternate dry/buttermilk when mixing into the wet mix.  Don't skip that step.  The method works and you won't be disappointed.   This is a keeper!

I don't understand some of these reviews.  This is a chocolate POUND cake.  It's suppose to be dense.  This is the best recipe ever.  I also mixed longer in between adding the eggs.  Everyone loved it.  We had it with whipped cream and fresh raspberries.  Simply the best.

The cake had little to no flavor.  It was moist and baked fine, but it didn't have a chocolate taste at all.  I wouldn't make it again.

This cake is amazing! I made this for my dads birthday and left it in the microwave for two days but even then it never lost its moistness. The only trouble I had was when I baked it, it took close to 1 hour and 45 min. Other than that it is perfect!!!!

This cake was amazing. I made this cake as a gift.  It smelled so good, I made another one the next day to keep. It was wonderful. I don't understand the negative reviews or why others seemed to have a problem. I followed the recipe to the letter and the taste and texture was phenomenal. I used a high-quality cocoa powder (Pernigotti Cocoa). A cheaper quality cocoa powder may not have made such a rich cake. I will make this cake again and again.

This is a decadent chocolate cake,made it for the first time to serve for dessert and it was a hit, however I reduced the amount of sugar in the recipe and it was still a bit sweet so I will reduce that some more but it was a hit and a keeper for me.

I've made this recipe 3 times in the past month with increasingly better results each time.  Spending the time to cream the butter and sugar and gradually adding the egg is a critical step.  The big difference from the first time is that I used my KitchenAid stand mixer instead of a hand mixer.  Makes a world of difference.  Here are the other changes I made to the recipe:
Replaced 1/2 cup of the butter with 1/2 cup canola oil (adds moisture)
Cooked for 1hr 30 min. instead of 1 hr 10 min.(makes it less brownie-like)
Added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter at the end (adds more chocolate flavor)
Everyone enjoyed it at the holiday celebrations.

I was searching for a rich chocolate cake and I am glad that I tried it out. It's a bit chewy, and considering that there's only 3/4 cup of cocoa powder, it's very chocolatey. I love it!

I loved the recipe, but edited it in the following way:
1. Cut the recipe to 8 serves (I have a small bundt pan)
2. Reduced the sugar by 1/3 c (to 230 g) and it was sweet enough
3. Used 2 eggs and 1/2 an egg substitute because I don't prefer an overly eggy flavour
4. Increased cocoa a bit (just a heaped helping)
5. Used CAKE FLOUR - this is essential for pound cakes - it is easy to make at home with flour and corn starch.
6. Baked it at 160 degrees for about 50 mins

This is the best chocolate pound cake I have ever tasted! It is very moist and dense, with a good chocolate flavor.  I added a simple chocolate glaze icing and used only a splash of coffee in the cake batter.  The buttermilk made the cake a tiny bit too tangy for my taste - I may substitute it with heavy cream next time. If you love the idea of a chocolate pound cake but have only found dry recipes, this is the one for you.  Yum!!

I am not a cake lover but this cake is so delicious! I made it for my sons birthday a year ago, and he has requested it several times since then. I am making it again this year for his 5th birthday. The only thing I did differently was I used a homemade frosting (since it was a birthday cake).

I thought the cake was great.  It was moist and chocolaty.  The only problem was that it got stuck in the mold.  but that was probably my fault.  i over filled it...and cooked it too long....at a really low temp.  even though i greased and floured the tin first.  i did add a dusting of powdered sugar as well as chocolate sauce.  the chocolate sauce made it too sweet.  but everything that went wrong was really my fault and no fault of the recipe itself...and that is why im giving it 5 stars.  thanks a bunch!

Great, no problems with this. I make a 1/2 batch and use a tube pan. I used buttermilk powder (in water) and bulk style dutch cocoa from my local food co-op. It disappears FAST! I start the kitchenaid whipping the wet ingredients while I measure out the dry and flour the pan, etc.

Halved the recipe with your calculator and baked it in an old 9-inch tube pan.  I used a smaller amount of fructose instead of sugar and spelt flour as my husband cannot eat wheat.  Yummy, buttery flavor.  Just what I was looking for.

Oh yum... I made this for Valentine's day and neither my husband or I could stop eating it!!  I made a pink glaze for it and it was very pretty.  Much better if it can fully cool, so make it in the morning if you plan on serving at night.  Freezes really well too.

This was delicious. I used this recipe to make a shaped birthday cake for my son. The pan only took 5 cups of batter, so I made mini bundt type cakes with the rest. It was very moist and kept well.

Wow!!!!! Very moist. I made this pound cake with no ingredient changes. I did how ever bake it at 285 degrees for about 1 hour and 30-40 minutes. I added 10 mins at a time after it baked the first 1 hour and 20 mins. and I kept checking for doneness. Well worth the effort and wait. Absolutely no burnt chocolate taste or bitterness from over cooked chocolate. I had many request for this cake and was asked to make one for my husband's small town cake auction for a local charity. You've got to try this one.

I was worried at first because it seemed a bit greasy out of the pan, but I let it cool, wrapped it up and kept it for the next day. When I cut into it 24 hours later it was moist and rich and delicious. Half of it went into a chocolate cherry trifle and the other half was thoroughly enjoyed all by itself.

I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased.  My family loved it!! I love the flavor the coffee adds to it.  I did have to bake it for an hour and 20 min, because the toothpick didn't come out clean after the recommended time...but other than that it was perfect!!

I didnt make in a bundt pan, but instead springform pans and made a 2-tier birthday cake by doubling the recipe, and out of each recipe making a 10" and a 7" cake. Good flavour, but next time I wouldnt try to absorb so much liquid, it was almost a little soggy.

Made this for Thanksgiving as an alternative to traditional poundcake. I covered it with a simple chocolate drizzle, and it was a major hit with my family. I'm looking forward to making it again! Next time, I want to try to make a thinner version of the icing that one typically sees on a German chocolate cake -- coconut, nuts, etc., just lighter than normal because the cake is so rich.

I made this and didn't love it. My neighbor and my boyfriend both said it was their favorite cake I've made so far (and I've made quite a few this year). I had another slice the next day and yum! I don't know what happened over night but it really did get better. I made this exactly according to the recipe and it came out perfectly.

Excellent chocolate cake, and I'm not even much of a cake person, I'd just made it for company...but it was excellent.  It needs an icing, though...I used the satiny chocolate glaze.

I have never had an easier baking experience!  This is a fail-safe recipe.  My family thinks this is the way a brownie made with pudding would taste like.  I have made this probably over 10 times and it always turns out well.  I add an extra egg.  I always follow the recommendation of using extra buttermilk and never frost, it's so perfect!
Make it! Make it! Make it! And you will never regret it!

I can only give this recipe one star at this time because when I did try it as written, I had to throw the entire cake away. Though it "tested" done by the time listed, it was completely raw in the center and the cake "fell", and I mean "fell".  I have never had that happen before and I wasn't happy about throwing away something with so many expensive ingredients in it.  Based on all of the other reviews, I am going to give this recipe one more try, but I'll either bake this for a full hour and a-half like my regular poundcake recipe, or I'll split the batter between two pans.  I know that this has to be good!  I'll rate this after I try it once more.

Thank you for a wonderful recipe. My family and friends raved about this cake. I made it with 1/2 Hershey's and 1/2 Dutch Cocoa Powder (all I had on hand!) and the flavor was fantastic:) I served this cake with fresh whipped cream and strawberries. It really looked beautiful when it came out of my Fiesta Bundt Pan and dusted with powdered sugar. The flavor and appearance really did look as though it came from a fancy restaurant. Many thanks, will use this recipe again and again!

I decreased the recipe to 4 servings. I omitted instant coffee and added 1/4 cup of mini choc chips. This perfectly filled a 6 mini bundt pan. Baked for 23 min in a convection oven. Absolutely delicious. The kids and hubby ate it up.

Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe.  This is by far the best chocolate pound cake I've ever tried.  Simply delicious.  I got rave reviews on this, even from sworn pie only lovers.  I made a nice sauce for it that can be found at:  http://www.folgers.com/recipes/desserts.shtml#coffee_sauce

I thought this recipe was awesome.  It did not come out of the pan great, but it didn't break up.  I used only 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of butter with 1/2 cup of applesauce to cut down on fat.  I might try more applesauce next time.  I didn't have any coffee granules on hand, but I did have instant english toffee cappuccino.  It turned out nice with a somewhat subtle toffee taste.  Thanks!

I thought this was soooooo good. My hubby will try it tonight (I snuck a piece after lunch) and we will see what he thinks. Oh, I even messed up and mixed the coffee in with the buttermilk, then I added some hot water to the batter. Still came out moist.

I'm rating this cake for the texture and the density of the cake, but the flavor was not the best.  I added orange zest, which gave it another layer of complexity, flavor and richness.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out really nicely -- however, much better the morning after it was baked.  I brought it in to work today for Valentine's Day and it's almost gone.  Big hit.  I'd definitely make it again.  The center was pretty fudgy and it wasn't overly chewy -- I just made sure not to beat it too much after reading another review.

YUM!! I was looking for a really dense, chocolatey cake to use for a birthday cake when I came upon this recipe. I baked it for about an hour in 2-9" round pans and used the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting recipe on this site. All I can say was that it turned out absolutely amazing. Sooo so awesome, and so rich you only honestly need the smallest of slices and a big glass of milk to be in paradise. Holy cow this was incredible. My search for the perfect chocolate cake recipe is over...if only I can stop thinking of the calorie content!;)

This is just too dense, like a brick. Make sure to serve it with lots of ice cream. This is like a thick, dense brownie.

I used splenda in this cake but I don't think it worked very well.  The cake has the density of a brick and a very dry brownie like texture.  Either Spelnda doesn't bake like sugar, or this is still a very heavy cake.  Perhaps I'll try it with regular sugar to see if I get the same result.

Hands down one of the tastiest pound cake recipes I have ever made.  I did make one slight adjustment -- I replaced 4 oz of butter with an equal amount of cream cheese. At the 60 minute point, the cake needed more time, so I turned the oven off and let it sit for 15 more minutes.  Perfect!

If you are a chocolate cake lover, then this cake is for you.  It does get better ( if possible) after a couple of days, if you can keep it around that long.  I did not change a thing in this recipe and dusted the cooled cake with icing sugar.  The cake is so awesome that it does not need to be frosted.  Thanks so much Shelley.

A very yummy chocolate cake! My only issue is that 3 cups of sugar is way too much for 2 cups of flour. I used only 2 and it was plenty. Also used only 4 eggs and it turned out fine. Thanks for the recipe.

We are chocolate lovers and the buttermilk really gives this cake a special taste. Came out of the pan like a dream. Served it to my gourmet group with chopped strawberries and chocolate syrup. Definately a keeper!

We loved this one!!  I made it exactly as shown, although it had to bake a little longer.  I served it for dessert the first night.  I dusted it with powdered sugar.  I then served it with a raspberry liqueur sauce drizzled on the dessert plates, then topped the cake with fresh whipped cream with a few fresh raspberries on top.  (The next day, it was good just plain, with coffee.)  I will definitely make this again!

I do a  lot of baking, and this was by far the best chocolate pound cake ever! Instead of buttermilk though - I used lowfat plain yogurt thinned with just a little lowfat milk. FAB! cake.

I made this for the first time about a year ago.  I love this cake, and so does my family.  Now, this is what I am asked to bring to big dinners and holidays.  I am about to take it to a family that lost a loved one.  So dense, moist, just a chocolate lover's dream.  My mother-in-law to be was hiding from us at Thanksgiving, she was not trying to give it up for anybody!!!!!  Cheers to whoever thought up this recipe.

This is the first chocolate pound cake I've tried and I was really pleased with the results. I did halve the recipe and think I added a little too much butter and not enough egg, so it had a slight brownie texture, but I plan on trying again soon making the whole recipe. Wonderful taste. Thanks for sharing.

Lovely chocolate cake, but very sweet and not the 'dark' chocolate pound I am still looking for. I have a feeling it would be better the next day, but it didn't last that long!

This chocolate pound cake is just the best!  And very forgiving.  I did not have butter or buttermilk so I used margerine and a cup of regular milk with a teaspoon if vinegar added to it.  It turned out so well, not dry at all like regular pound cakes usually are.  Just fantastic, I will make this again and again.  Thanks, Barb in BC Canada

I needed a dessert recipe fast and thankfully I had all the ingredients for this cake. It was ok, I got lots of compliments but I definitely agree that it needs a glaze or something on it.

Wonderful taste and texture to this cake.  Best made the day before and left overnight in the refrigerator.  I tried making it in a tube pan and it just didn't work.  I'm staying with the bundt pan.

This cake is wonderful...dense, moist, chocolately.  I would love it with raspberries or other fruit and maybe with one of the satiny chocolate glazes.  I made a chocolate frosting from this site that wasn't good enough to put on top of the cake, so I just left it as is, and can't wait to pick up some berries tomorrow.

This recipe is outstanding!  The whole time my husband is eating it all he says is "this is so good".  I didn't add anything to the recipe but I did ice it with a chocolate buttercream.  It looks and tastes fantastic.

I can’t say thank you enough for this recipe! It will not disappoint. I think it has the perfect texture.  I’ve been looking for a nice simple chocolate pound cake with a good solid chocolate flavor. Something both kids and adults could enjoy. This fits the bill perfectly. I love it!

I’ve made this several times. It is a hit with family and friends and is always gone in two days or less.  Sometimes I add in semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate chips. It is even better the second day because it becomes more moist and dense and rich.  I usually make a chocolate sauce to drizzle on and serve with fresh  whipped cream and strawberries.  I don’t always get it to come out of the pan perfectly though.

I didn’t have the right pan so I made a square 9x9 pan and 12 cupcakes. The cake was absolutely delicious! I topped it with a simple chocolate frosting with a bit of sour cream added. It was also just as good if not better the day after. The cupcakes didn’t turn out nearly as well. They just get too firm and dry. So Incase anyone was wondering...sheet cake is a yes, and cupcakes are a firm no.

Easy to follow recipe. Turned out perfectly! Huge hit! The flavor popped! Rich, moist, and very chocolate! I used a 1/4 cup of Keurig brewed coffee using Starbuck’s  Caffé Verona. That’s the only “change” I made. I also used Irish butter and Spice Islands pure vanilla extract.

I gave this 4 stars because I took someone else's advice and cut the sugar by 1/2 a cup,  3 cups would be way too sweet. For anyone complaining about the lack of chocolate flavour, I think it's the cocoa used. I used a high quality cocoa and it was so chocolatey and rich. The cake will be dense as it is a pound cake. To make it moister I substituted apple sauce for 1/2 cup of the butter. I topped it off with a glaze made from salted caramel. Very yummy. I will be making this again.

Alright. I am a chocolate fan and a pound cake fan but usually regular chocolate cake leaves me wanting more .. density and moist chocolate goodness. Well here it is. This cake. Dense chocolatey Perfection, especially after one or more days wrapped in the fridge! Thanksgiving guests agreed! I followed everything to a T except followed another reviewer’s rec to bake at 300 degrees for 70 mins. Mine was done at 60 mins in convention oven. Perfect. Also, my daughter had so much fun learning to big-girl-bake with me as it was her first time beyond muffins etc. Thank you for this recipe!

The cake was very dense and very moist, and it did not taste like a brownie (to me).  It did have good chocolate flavor but it seemed like something was missing-there was a blandness even with the chocolate flavor. It came out beautifully in the bundt pan-I agree with others it needs more time -I baked it at 300 (in response to another reviewers suggestion) for 75 minutes and I think it was about perfect (maybe a tad underdone). Incredibly my mother in law loved it and even texted me later to tell me how good it was.  I personally would add some sort of ganache next time.  I will make it again but I’m still looking for a recipe that gives a crunchy/fudgey exterior layer

Absolutely delicious!  Didn’t have instant coffee but had instant espresso and used 1 tsp.  dissolved in the same amount of water since it’s a bit stronger.  Many requests for the recipe since I’ve served it at two different occasions

Made the recipe as posted except for halving all ingredients- this resulted in 9 cakelets (baked for 30 minutes) and 9 mini cupcakes (baked for 12 minutes). The cake turned out absolutely delicious with the perfect amount of density and moisture- not too much nor too little. The chocolate flavor shines through; in other recipes I have found the flavor gets “lost” in the heaviness of the cake and that is not the case here. This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on!

I was asked to make a dessert for a gathering. I was going to just do pound cake and berries with whipped topping. I decided to go the extra mile with something different. Chocolate poind cake with sugar glazed strawberries and a white chocolate drizzle. I had to make 2 because it was so good, my husband started digging into it right away! I should have taken a picture because it made a beautiful display. I did it with 2 sheet cakes with the strawberries in the middle. Needless to say, it was a hit! The only "complaint" I got was that it was too rich and 2 people could finish it but they still said it was amazing!

This is not a pound cake. If there is such a thing as overly moist chocolate cake, this is it, squishing like an undercooked brownie. It gives the sensation of richness but not a depth of chocolate flavor.  Note that every photo of this sliced shows a dense interior that looks like fudge rather than cake. That said, it does have a certain quality that makes it interesting eating, vaguely verging on a pudding cake texture. Chilling overnight firms up the butter and makes it less "oily". If you like zucchini cake that is heavy on the oil and sugar, you would probably like this chocolate cake. I won't be repeating this one.

I used a Nordicware gingerbread bundt cake pan.  It made too much batter for the pan, but the flavor and texture was great.  Topped with powdered sugar for decoration.

I've made it several times and it's always a hit. I don't have instant coffee so I just made a cup of strong coffee and used 1/4 cup of it and used tube cake pan.

Simply put fabulous!! Mine took a little longer to bake, probably closer to 80 minutes, but I'd say that was likely due to my dodgy oven...always seems to take a little longer. Whole family got on board this one!

I made this recipe for my fiance as a surprise.. he loves pound cake and the flavors of chocolate and peanut butter so I decided to combine them in one treat. The recipe was easy to follow and very quick to execute.  My cake turned out great! it's moist and rich..even without the glaze it definitely satisfies the sweetest sweet  tooth. :)

I was a 40 y/o cake Virgin - meaning never baked or decorated a cake in my life! Decided to make a cake for my partner's birthday and searched for a perfect cake to hold the fondant (I chose a matrix inspired cake with black fondant and for the record, it looked amazing) My colleague and I  decided to browse the internet and found this recipe!

I converted the measurements to metric (as I am in UK and that's what we tend to use here) and hope to God I did it right :) 

I used a 9" square pan, made 2 layers - placed frosting and chocolate chips in the middle and more frosting around the cake to hold everything together. Baked in 165 degrees fan oven  for 60 minutes and voilà - beautiful, moist and just perfect.  Everybody was praising it and loved it! Although to be honest, next time I will brave it and  reduce the sugar, I used 675g of caster sugar instead of what was instructed by the way.

I cannot thank you enough for this amazing recipe!!!

This is really a beautiful recipe. 
Admittedly, I did make some changes but I think it would still be just as good the way it is. 
I used only 1 cup of butter and 6 eggs. I also used 2 and 3/4 cups of flour. 
As other reviewers have mentioned, this really is a very moist, dense cake but if you want a bit of crumb all you have to do is cream the butter and sugar for longer than recommended (about 5 minutes). Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl at least once while you are creaming. It will still be dense but not as compact. 
Personally, I love the taste of this cake. The coffee really brings out the chocolate flavour. (I dissolved my coffee in milk). If you want something extra chocolatey, you probably need to look for something that says "double chocolate" because you won't get it from this, but it will definitely satisfy a chocolate craving. Also, you can probably try adding chocolate chips or use chocolate ganache to finish it. (Just remember to adjust the sugar accordingly). 
I will be using this as my go to chocolate pound cake recipe.

I make this cake without the coffee. (We don't drink coffee.) But the result is a favorite. Just writing this review makes me want to head for the kitchen and make another chocolate pound cake.

I've never made pound cake before, but needed one for the Wilton's Giant Cupcake pan I was filling. I did something I generally don't do and followed the recipe almost exactly.  I  even took some of hubby's leftover coffee from yesterday and boiled it to condense it. I hate, despise, detest and abhor coffeee, but couldn't taste it in the mix at all. 
I did read through the comments and creamed the butter and sugar for 5 min then 30 seconds between eggs.  It took longer than the hour to cook through - not sure how long bc I lost track of time. When I was pulling it out of the oven, it slipped out of my hand and still didn't fall. 
It's chocolatey, moist, and beautiful! 
I hope the poured fondant I'm putting on it is just as lovely.

Love this recipe! I'm a novice baker, made it 3 times already and everybody loved it. 
 I always like to twirk the recipes I try. I didn't make any major changes. I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar. Added approx. 3 tbs of applesauce,a teaspoon of orange extract. Also i dissolved the instant coffee in some leftover regular coffee instead of water. I also added about 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I thought it might mellt during baking, but it stayed together. Which was great.Also, as I've read in a previous review, I've baked it at 280F for 85 mins. Next time I'll try 270 f for 85 mins.
I've made a chocolate glaze to pour over. It called for corn syrup, I didn't have any at home, so i've added raspberry syrup. Super delicious.

This was my first chocolate pound cake. After reading most of the reviews I decided to change a few things. I buttered and sugared the pan (instead of flour) , I steeped freshly ground dark choc coffee beans in 1/4 C of hot water (along with the instant coffee) for the length of time it took for the eggs, butter and butter milk to come to room temp. I strained the coffee grounds off. I used 1/4 C dark choc cocoa powder and 1/2 C  of regular cocoa powder. I increased the baking powder to 1 tsp. This cake was still dense and moist, perfectly chocolaty with just the right amount of coffee flavor. We loved it!

Excellent pound/bundt cake. 
The coffee  is an excellent choice and intensifies the chocolate flavour (I use expresso - lowest in caffeine but highest in flavour).         I had run out of buttermilk, so I used 1/2 cup "Half and Half" + 1/2cup of 2% milk + 2 tsp. Lemon juice in its place.
My husband loves chocolate so added 1 cup of mini dark chocolate chips for him. They melted in the cake and a delicious addition. 
Perfect cake. I have made others from this site and this is now the best choice. I will make it again.

I never take anyone's recipe verbatim.  I amended this based on my past baking experience and my personal methods.  For starters, the cocoa I use is a blend of three types is mostly high fat.  Not cheap stuff. Cheap Cocoa dries out the cake.  High Fat cocoa doesn't. I also dust the pan with that cocoa, not flour.  Then to ensure its not dry, I added two decent pours of coffee, say about 6 ounces, a bit more than called for in the recipe.  It's again, higher end strong coffee (espresso is best here truthfully), makes a world of difference in bringing out the flavor of the chocolate. Bonus if you grate about 1/3-1/2 bar of Belgian Chocolate into the mix as well (8-9 pieces).

Given I always use Buttermilk in baking, I also added two heaping dollaps of Homemade Yogurt.  Any clean Yogurt can do here, or add Sour Cream if you like.  Again helps keep the dense and moist. By clean I means no Danone.  Milk + Cultures should be the only thing on the label. This cake is  amazing, turns out rich and robust sour-chocolaty flavour, which is where this effort went.  Next will add pureed raspberry instead of the Yogurt and see how that goes  Use the best ingredients = Best Cakes.

This cake is very good, but it has a completely different texture than a regular pound cake. As another reviewer said, it's more like a fudgey brownie, which is delicious! I added chocolate chips because I was worried about some comments that it wasn't chocolatey enough. That was fine, but they needed to be dusted in flour or cocoa first because they sunk to the bottom. I'm not sure if I would make this again. I'd find another recipe if I were looking for an actual chocolate pound cake, and otherwise I might just make brownies. Maybe if I were serving a big crowd I'd make this because it makes many servings - you can't have much at a time.

This is my go-to chocolate pound cake recipe.  I've made it countless times over the years and it may just be my favorite cake ever!  I have a feeling the negative reviews are from people who don't really like pound cake, which is a dense, moist cake with relatively little crumb.  If you're a fan of pound cake, I encourage you to give this recipe a try.  It's a winner!

This cake is so good! It really doesn't need any glaze or icing. It's sweet enough on its own. I dusted with a bit of powdered sugar before serving to make it look pretty. 

I have a 9.75" cake pan so I filled it 3/4 of the way with batter. I put the extra batter in an 8" loaf pan. I baked them both at the same time for 60 minutes.

This cake was good and easy to make. It was a little too sweet, so I will reduce the sugar by a half cup.  Liked the settle hint of coffee.  I plan to use this recipe again in the near future.

The taste of this cake is great.  I cooked it for 1.5 hours and it came out super moist and delicious.  I did increase the cocoa to almost one cup as per the advice of others.  However, even though I greased and floured the bundt pan, this cake really stuck to the bottom and I could only get it out in chunks...delicious chunks mind you!  If you make it, grease and flour the pan VERY well!  The only other reason I gave it only 3 stars was because the batter is incredibly thick...so thick that it was difficult for my mixer to beat without overheating!  ...but I only have a hand held mixer.  The taste though, is great!

This cake turned out very moist and rich. I made it in a 10-inch round cake pan so it was about 3 inches thick and some people said it was too rich...I think they just don't like chocolate enough :)

Wow.  This case is really moist and tasty.  The only changes I made are
(1) I used powdered butter milk - you blend it in with the flour and use regular milk ,(2) I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose flour, and (3) I added a teaspoon of cinnamon.

The only problem I had was with the cake sticking to the pan and bits of floor on top.  Next time I will just oil the pan and let it sit in the pan a little longer than 20 minutes so that it won't stick to the pan.

Delicious. I received so many compliments on this cake! I did not use coffee but instead brewed a very strong cup of Earl Grey because I just don't drink coffee and it worked out fine.

Awesome pound cake.  I baked the cake in individual bundt pans - for about 25 minutes.  They came out perfect!  I am not a huge chocolate cake fan, but this was fantastic.  Very rich and creamy - As other reviewers stated, I beat the butter and sugar for about 3 minutes or so.

I took other reviewers' advice and baked the cake for 90 minutes.  With my oven this was too long and the cake was a little dry.  Next time I will try the suggested time and hopefully it will turn out better.  Despite being dry, the cake tasted fine and looked beautiful when dusted with powdered sugar.

The instant coffee really makes this cake!  It was easy to make and it's so good.  I used a little less sugar, maybe like 2 1/2 cups and it was still sweet and still not very healthy but oh well.  Excellent cake...I will definitely make it again.

Other than having too much batter for the pan, and the cooking time being way longer than stated... this cake was fabulous!! I did melt 1/2 cup chocolate chips and blended them in with the hot regular coffee (as opposed to strong) before adding to the batter... I will make this again, maybe in loaf pans.

A really dense and chocolately cake.  I replaced a stick of butter with 1/2 cup of applesauce and used only 2 cups of sugar.  I was planning to top it with a glaze, but half of the cake was gone before I had the chance to make the glaze!!!  I will be making this cake again.

This is a very rich chocolate cake!  The taste is amazing, it is almost like a brownie!  The serving sized suggested are very big for a cake this rich.  I did add a few mini chocolate chips but that was my only change from the original recipe.  Thank you!

As I usually do, I tried this recipe the first time exactly as presented. It baked for exactly 70 minutes to PERFECTION!

What an incredible recipe! 

After reading many of the reviews, and remembering my Grandma's instructions of "generously grease and lightly flour" to prepare baking pans, after cooling for 20 minutes it came out of the bundt pan perfectly.

This is a rich, dense pound cake, just as it should be. it reminds me of a cross between a brownie and my Grandma's chocolate cake. 

I couldn't have asked for more.

This was a delicious recipe and easy to make.  I read a lot of the other reviews and incorporated advice from many and substituted ingredients when I didn't have something.  That said, the following may help others.  
1. I used chocolate milk instead of buttermilk and used the chocolate milk in place of the coffee.  
2. I baked the pound cake at 300 for about 2 hours (not sure if my oven doesn't work well at low temps, but it was completely gooey when I checked it at 70 minutes).
Other than those two things, I didn't change a thing and I thought the cake was delicious, very moist, and a slight crunch to the top of the pound cake-like most pound cakes I have eaten.

Super moist, very good.  We used to buy personal-sized cakes from a local Bundt Cake store, and this recipe is actually better.  My husband even loves it (and he's a hard sell).

This cake is dense but moist (it is a pound cake after all); if I could give it 4&1/2 stars I would.  It did accomplish my main objective: to impress my boyfriend's mother, who I was meeting for the first time, as she's a chocolate-lover.  However, for my taste the chocolate flavor was a little too plain.  I would probably make this again but next time I'd follow the recipe a little less closely and try adding some kahlua and/or almond extract as a few of the others have suggested.  A bit of thin raspberry sauce drizzled over it did make it more interesting.  As a final consideration, with almost 400 calories per serving, while I probably will make this cake again sometime in the future it is definately a cake for rare occasions and not something I'd want to make too often.

Wow!  When this cake first came out of the pan, I didn't care much for it.  I put it in the fridge though, and came back four hours later to taste it again.  It was fantastic.  It got even better over night, and was breakfast the next morning.  I used the lovely dark powdered chocolate from Williams Sonoma and the cake came out dense and dark, almost like a dark fudgy brownie. Chocolate heaven--- even without the glaze I had planned on adding, but never did.

This is so moist and is now one of my favorite recipies. It makes a lot of batter so make sure you are using a big bowl to mix it in.

Awesome cake!  I made the cake exactly as the recipe stated and added a chocolate glaze to finish (though 10X & fresh berries would have been just as yummy!).  Will use this recipe again.
