This was a simple, easy, and tasty week night dinner with ingredients I usually have on hand. I added some onions and garlic while I was sauteing the chicken but did not add tomatoes because those are our family's preferences.

This recipe was simple to put together however it is lacking in flavor.  I thought of that as I was making it and wondered where the spices were but I made it as written.  A bit disappointing.  I will make it again but I'm going to put together a spice combo to add more flavor.

I love it! But, I sometimes substitute a can of mild rotel for the tomatoes. Or, I mix in a can of cream of mushroom or chicken . . .excellent with substitutes or not!  This one's a winner!

I had leftover Velveeta and veggies from the holidays but had no idea what to do with them! This was the answer! I had very low expectations bc I never cook with Velveeta other than quest dip, but this was surprisingly tasty! Definitely a quick weeknight dinner. To make sure the broccoli was cooked I dumped it, as well as some chopped cauliflower, on top of the boiling pasta halfway through (without stirring) and put a lid on the skilletâ€” the broccoli and cauli steamed nicely without overcooking! : ) Thanks for the recipe!

Reading how it was kinda bland I added 2 cans of rotel and it was awesome.  My picky eater loved it so I will definitely be making this again.
