Very good!  And if some aren't so hot on the (((hot))) stuff, just reserve the habanero for those who like the spicier chops.   The rest of the ingredients work well for those who don't like it kicked up that much :)!

I found that if you want a super duper easy way to get these extra tender & juicy, is to use a cooking bag!  Makes clean up a breeze too!

We did alter a little, but just because we didn't have all the ingredients.  Used some superhot sauce (Blair's Death Sauce) in place of pepper and some tequila and vodka in place of rum (and not quite as much).  We enjoyed it and I think it would be good in it's original form as well!

My family did not care for the taste.  We like spicy foods, but this wasnt for us.

I have been looking for this receipe since I left Hawaii in 1985. I had it in a little Spanish Diner in Oahu. You have made me verrry happy.

We halved the recipe but still used a whole habanero, AND I left most of the seeds and veins in, but it still wasn't overwhelmingly hot (of course I'm a chilihead so what do I know).  We also only used 2/3 of the rum called for because we ran out, but it seemed to be more than enough.  I used a different cut of pork, which was NOT good, but I think with a chop this would be decent.

The whole family loved this. I used half a habanero instead of a whole, and served it with orange rice. It got the most raves of anything I've cooked in the past couple of weeks. Will definitely be doing it again.

I used a jalapeno instead of habanero to cut down the heat a little. The chops came out kind of tough.  Probably halving the cooking time could make then a little more tender.

The only change I made was added an extra 1/2 Habanero chili and expected this to be super hot. Was quite disappointed. Never really felt any heat at all. Not sure if I did something else wrong but just didn't come out like I expected.
