Made my own salsa with petite diced tomatoes, canned diced jalapenos, onion powder, garlic powder and diced onion.  Used powdered ginger (1.5 teaspoons), olive oil, purple cabbage and pork chops cut up because that was what I had.   It was awesome!  Thanks for the tasty recipe! :D

We made this with salsa we had on hand- not Pace Picante sauce. I used a hand blender to pur√©e the salsa, then mixed the other ingredients in as directed. I served it with steamed rice, then cabbage atop the rice, then pork on top of that! It is a kid-friendly recipe, but my husband thought it was a little bland. Not sure if using Pace would have made it more flavorful. If I make it again, I will add garlic, double the ginger, and try actual Pace picante sauce. Thanks for the recipe; the cabbage was good!

It was just OK. Nothing special. Probably won't make it again.

I just LOVED this recipe and, surprisingly, so did my three boys ages 11, 14 and 15 as did my husband.  I added sauted sliced onions and minced garlic to the cabbage along with a little salt and pepper to give it more flavor.  Served it all over jasmine rice.  Delicious and will definitely make again.

Really good, but makes a lot of cabbage! We added extra pineapple and served with rice.

I fixed this using chicken didn't have pork it was awesome!  I have been frying cabbage for years, who would have thought this combination.  I'm going to make tonight with coconut chicken I made a week ago and froze.  My mouth is watering already...my husband who never complains about my cooking ,  even if he doesn't like it I know because he says it's alright...but this he said you can make it again!
