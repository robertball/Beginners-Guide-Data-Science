Delicious!!!!  I had to bake my salmon about 5 minutes longer then I placed it under the broiler for 5 more.  I set aside some of the glaze to use as a side sauce.  This is definitely being added to our dinner menu rotation.

I made this twice now. The first time with Dijon and a little yellow mustard since I was out of whole grain. This time around, I followed along and made extra to store in the fridge so my boyfriend can cook a delicious salmon when I'm working late. I subbed white wine vinegar for the white wine...I'd rather save the alcohol to toast with and I seldom have it on hand.

I really liked the flavor combo in this. The one thing I would have preferred more was for the salmon to be grilled instead of baked so that it what I will do next time. Use a BBQ sauce that you know you like and you cannot go wrong with this recipe!

I loved the sweet combination of the maple syrup and BBQ sauce. I used a sweet bourbon grainy mustard that was just made for this recipe. I glazed fresh wild caught Atlantic salmon. Superb!!!
