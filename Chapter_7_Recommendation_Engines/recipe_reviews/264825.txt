Tried sweet potato fries in the air fryer several different ways. This one was the best by far!

Thank you very much for such an easy and satisfying recipe! The one modification I did was to cut the sweet potato, then soak the fries in water for at least 10 minutes, to make them more crispy.

I just bought a small air fryer and this was the first item I cooked in it.  I followed the recipe as is, except I used regular salt instead of Kosher salt (didn't have any).  Turned out great!  I adjusted the time according to the size of the batches. Instead of adding all the ingredients in a bowl, I put them all in a large baggy and shook it up.  Easy cleanup.  My husband (who's the biggest fan for sweet potatoes) loved them and asked for them to be made again the next day.  Thank you for the recipe.

This came out great, highly recommended. You can do an average sized sweet potato in one round rather than the two or three in the recipe.

Followed the recipe but not crispy except for the burnt parts. Will try soaking it before frying next time as someone suggested.

So delicious! I played with the size of the fries and added 30 seconds frying time to get them crispy.
