I cut the recipe in half, with exception to the puree - I used the full 28 oz can as pasta needs a lot of sauce and, I recommend 1 1/2 lbs of mozzerella for a single casserole.  I added a tsp of Italian Seasoning and didn't simmer quite as long as recipe asked for...Still turned out very good.

I followed the recipe as written. While the flavor is ok, it was dry.

I made this almost like it says, except for using shredded parmesan with the mozzarrella and also I didn't cook sauce as long.  This is a delicious recipe.   I could keep on eating it, it taste so good.  Thank you for a great dinner.

Excellent dish. It was way too much food, I cut the ingredients in half and put in a 9 x 13 pan, still had some leftover to freeze for an individual dinner. 

I used shredded mozzarella cheese instead of slices and/or cubes, and cooked the garlic with the meat to eliminate a step. Added 1 1/2 tsp salt, 4 tsp sugar, 1 tsp italian seasoning, and 1/4 tsp pepper to the sauce. I didn't have tomato puree so substituted a small can of tomato paste and 1 cup of water. I had red peppers instead of the green. I used 1# top quality Italian sausage from our local butcher shop, it made a difference since it features prominently in the overall flavor.

This was delicious. You can taste the long simmering of the sauce in the overall product. This is definitely being added to our family recipe repertoire, everyone loved it and you can feed an army!
