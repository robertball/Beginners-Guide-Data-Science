Delicious and easy!  I added a splash of vanilla and when I make it again might increase the Captain Morgan a bit.  Everyone who has tried it loves it.  I like the fact you don't have to use eggs for this recipe.

Will definitely give this a try since this recipe doesnâ€™t use a bunch of egg yolks.  Can you please indicate the type of mango you use since the amount of flesh varies between a smaller champagne/Manila mango vs a much larger Mexican/Kent mango, having the weigh or volume of the flesh would be very helpful . Thanks!

It was delicious! My husband makes wonderful ice cream and is famous for his adult ice cream. This was the newest added to his list. It was a hit!

I added  just a bit if vanilla extract Andy more mango Tom suit my taste.  I also used agave instead of corn syrup.  I ran food processor for probably 5 minutes, poured mixture into ice cream maker for 45 minutes to result in a much lighter smoother ice cream,  magnificent!
