This is a good recipe - but as one poster already mentioned the beaten egg will need to be added,  I used half shortening and half butter and the finished product was tasty and light.  One thing to keep in mind is that with an entire cup you will need to allow the cresents to rise to at least double before baking to keep them from being dense.

I made the dough after lunch, refrigerated it for an hour, left it on the counter for the rest of the time.  

The only thing I would change is to make three circles, instead of four, so the cresents are not so tiny.  

These rolls have a great taste.  I will make them again and again.

Probably deserves 5 stars as the taste was great, but the beaten egg seems to have been lost in the preparation directions.  Fortunately I have baked fresh bread before and threw it in while mixing the dough in the first part of the directions before refrigeration.  However, the taste was just like I remember my granmas but much simpler to prepare.  Thanks.

I've been baking breads for over 30 years and I've learned that recipes that have a very rich dough- a good amount of butter & eggs, really need to have the extra yeast. I think you'll be pleasantly surprized at how really light & flaky these rolls can be when made with Two packets of yeast. Not to mention bigger. A very impressive dinner roll for the holidays.

These were really good, but for some reason they did not rise very well. The dough was a bit dry when kneading. So  made half as butterhorns, and the other half of the dough, I used to make cinnamon rolls. These came out absolutely delicious! I just rolled the dough to abt 1/4 inch thick, spread some room temp butter on top, and sprinkled with a mixture of white, and brown sugar with a bit of cinnamon. I would have added some raisins or choc.chips, If I had known how good it would have come out! It was delish even without though! The longer they stayed, they better they got. They were more like soft cookies, in a cinnamon bun style and flavor. Really good and easy too!

I suggest a egg wash for a littel color.  Also these do not rise much so don't be alarmed.   Good flavor.

I did not have time to let the dough sit over night so I covered it to rise for one hour. The butterhorns were a little dense but still good.
