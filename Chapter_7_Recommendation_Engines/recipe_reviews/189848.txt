I am an old Kentucky gal who hs been making sweet potatoes like this for over 50 years and so has my family. It tis delicious and easy to do. Thanksgiving would not be Thanksgiving without it. A large sweet potatoe weighs about apound or little over.

As written, this recipe is absolutely delicious. Just be aware that it isn't the prettiest dish. It is more pudding like than bread like (which is what I originally expected) and the caramelized sugar made me think the dish was very burnt. Still, anyone who has tried it has raved.

I make it as written for Thanksgiving, but I have tried cutting back the butter and sugar when I make it at other times. This is what I have learned: 
Half the butter gets you closer to the bread consistency, tastes pretty good, and doesn't ooze butter. On the downside, you can of course taste the missing butter.
Half the brown sugar with all the butter tastes like butter. I do not recommend it.
Half the butter and half the brown sugar gets you the more bread like consistency and doesn't ooze butter, but is definitely much more bland.

I made this the first time 3 yrs ago for Thanksgiving and now it is requested every year for both Thanksgiving and Christmas!!! Just as a warning, using canned yams works, but it doesn;t taste the same or have the same texture.

I used 5 medium sized sweet potatoes and kept everything else the same.  It just sounded too sweet with a cup of brown sugar, for 1 potato, and to serve 12 people?

I made this dish today for my kids school's fundraiser. It was a great success! I had the first dish to be sold out. I made just a few minor adjustments. I had to make enough for 30 people. I added a 1 cup and 1/2 of karo syrup and allspice besides tripling the amount of sweet potatoes and everything else.

I loved it! I used half butter, half margarine. My diabetic husband declared it "too sweet".  But I spread leftovers on my warm biscuits. Yum!

Excellent - Used Truvia Brown Sugar Blend and Egg Beatersbut otherwise followed the recipe - Will adjust the butter and Condensed milk in an effort to make it more Diabetes Friendly - but it was great - Only complaint - there were NO LEFTOVERS :-)
