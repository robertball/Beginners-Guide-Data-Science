My family loved it! I felt it was a little too bland. When I make this again I am going to put the spaghetti in a 9 X 12 casserole, add mushrooms and black olives to the chicken mixture, then top with sour cream and the cheese. I'll let y'all know how it turns out!!

I thought this was pretty good but hubby wasn't too pleased. I followed the recipe as written except I used penne pasta instead of spaghetti noodles and I upped the cheese to 1 1/2 cups.

The flavor was good, but definitely needs more moisture. I will be adding broth, cream, cream of mushroom soup (or something) to the leftovers (there was a lot leftover). Too bad for the family, but they'll be eating this one again this week. Hopefully, the added moisture will help! Again, not a terrible recipe just a bit dry. :)

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe and even discussed what we could add to it to make it even yummier. It was very easy and pretty quick to make. I did add about a cup more of cheese and I seasoned my chicken with a dash of salt and pepper and some seasoning salt.

Thick, rich & delicious!! The only thing I changed is that I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom, because we donâ€™t care for mushrooms.

I am taking take this to pot luck, it's amazing and I know everyone will love it. I personally will cook the chicken first next time and then add in onions and garlic just before the chicken is done.   Yummmy

I made a couple of changes and it was still excellent. I used processed cheese slices because that's all I had and also a good dose of Frank's red hot sauce. Easy weeknight meal, thank you!

It was very different from anything I've ever made, but it was still really good. I read one of the reviews saying how they doubled the sauce and it was exactly enough, so that's what I did too...but I wish I hadn't. That's what killed the dish for me - there was wayyy too much sauce (which was my own fault of course). The next time I make this I'm going to make it a bit differently. Instead of pasta, I'm going to use the same recipe and put the chicken mixture in soft tortillas, making it an adapted chicken enchilada recipe. I think it'd taste great!

I thought this was okay. I used leftover chicken from the grill from the other day I shredded. That worked fine. I also used an extra piece or two. For some reason, I doubled the soup and tomato and chili ingredients to keep the spaghetti from being too dry and seemed to be exactly enough to coat the pasta. I am not sure how this would have turned out without doing that. I also opted to save time, and avoid the spaghetti from drying out, by just cooking it on the stove and adding the cheese to the top to melt. This tasted very similar to other chicken spaghetti recipes I have tried with just a slick kick from the chilis. I did use mild and it was plenty hot for my liking. Otherwise, this was fast to make with leftover chicken. ty

I'm not a big fan of the cream of soups but this was pretty good. I did add sliced black olives because I always do when making chicken spaghetti and I used a mexi-blend cheese that I had on hand. In my opinion the 1/2 cup of cheese the recipe calls for is not enough. I think you at least need 1 cup to cover everything or 2 cups if you are like us and like things extra cheesy. This recipe was super simple and one I will make again.
