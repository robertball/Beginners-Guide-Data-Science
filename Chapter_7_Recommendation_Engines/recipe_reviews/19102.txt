This recipe was a bit disapointing :(  I had really high hopes because because of the ingredients and reviews so maybe that was the problem. It really sounded delicious, especially the butter sauce! I make pound cakes quite often (family favorite) and have had some great ones made from recipes on this site, but this one was not so great. After sitting for a day the cake was really dry except for the sauce soaked parts.The only way I would serve this to company is topped with a fruit sauce, like sauteed strawberries and sugar, but I won't be making this one again.

Thanks.  This is an excellent cake and after reading a review that said it did not have much taste I question if they used pure vanilla.  This will make a difference.  Also, it is better if it is allowed to age for a couple of days.  A cake any baker would be proud to serve.

Perfect for apple upside down cake. I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8X8 pyrex dish. First, I peeled, cored and sliced apples into 8ths. and placed at the bottom of the buttered dish(in a pretty pattern). I then made a caramel sauce, and poured on top of apples. Lastly, I poured the cake batter on top of evreything and baked as usual. Came out fabulously perfect! Can make it using a butterscotch syrup too instead of the caramel. Did not make the sauce that comes with this recipe. I just served with a drizzle of store bought caramel sauce. Yummm!

This buttery pound cake was fairly moist, and the glaze added interest. I baked it in a 325 degree convection oven for 50 minutes, which was plenty.  More baking time would have made it too dry. I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5, as I felt that after 3 tablespoons of vanilla, 3 sticks of butter and a cup of sour cream that there should have been a more intense flavour....it just needed more "oommph".  However, it was a great base for strawberries and vanilla ice cream.

I have yet to make this cake but i surely intend to, my commeng is on the comments.
if you cannot be decent do not lreave comments, no one is interested if you fed it to your squirrels, and us ladies do need the fat in some cases and do not need to "lighten up". Be objective, do not be petty, can't wait to try this and it will get a fair respectful review.

Great flavor. The texture isn't as dense as a normal butter cake, which I was a little disappointed about. Other than that, great.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  I make pound cakes a lot, and this one had an odd, unpleasant taste.  Even the batter didn't taste good--not a good sign. I followed the recipe exactly but didn't make the butter sauce.  The cake was moist and looked good, and I baked it for an hour and 10 minutes in a bundt cake pan. All of the ingredients were fresh, and I used real vanilla.  I cut a piece after it was out of the oven for a while, and it didn't taste good.  I put it in the refrigerator until the next day and tried a piece then.  It still wasn't worth eating, so I put it in the backyard for the squirrels.  I can only think that the sour cream was the ingredient that shouldn't have been there, and maybe yogurt or just another cup of butter would have made it taste better/good.  I definitely would not make this again and cannot recommend it at all.  Expensive backyard feed.

Hubby didn't care for the cake, but I loved it. He thought there was too much vanilla, and I have to agree.  I followed the recipe as written; however, only baked for 60 min. Easy to make. I can see many variations of this recipe being equally tasty. Changing extracts, spices, or using rum. Thanks!...UPDATE: Held up well and stayed moist for the 3 days it took to polish it off.

I saved this recipe to try it and finally did on Friday 14 May 2010 for a training meeting at our church.  All of the ladies were from my Sunday school class and they didn't know there would be dessert at the meeting. They really loved it.  I did not get one piece which was okay because I ate lots of ice-cream the night before already going above my sugar allowance.  I had some scraps from the cake pan and it was slamming.  I thought the butter sauce would make it too rich, but it added just the right touch.  I think I used too much brown sugar??(I had dark brown) because the cake didn't have the yellow appearance like the picture.  THAT however, was not a deterrent.  Thanks.  I'll do this one again for sure.

This is an absolutely delicious cake. Moist! Flavorful. Absolutely loved it! Will be making this over and over again, actually making it this evening!! Made a few changes though. Doubled the recipe and used 1 cup sour cream and one cup heavy whipping cream and it came out very moist and soft. Also put in 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and cinnamon. Got a person who said it was a bit too sweet but that's it. This goes into my collection of recipes!! I got 2 12" cakes (which I layered and decorated as a birthday cake for a client) and a small about 6" heart shaped cake out of the doubled recipe.

DELICIOUS!! I followed the recipe exactly as is, and it turned out superb. I didnt use all of the butter sauce... I just took a spoon and lightly spread it across the top of the loaf when I took it out of the oven. I want to buy some vanilla bean ice cream tomorrow and re-heat the butter cake and throw a scoop on top! yummy! THANK YOU for such a simple and great recipe!

If you used the brown sugar, pure vanilla extract and real butter, there is no way this can be tasteless. 
It's not an IN YOUR FACE taste - it's a nice, warm, soft taste as the name implies.  Butter cake.

This cake is wonderful. This is my favorite cake to make and the butter sauce just adds that extra kick to it. I add an extra stick of butter to mines though.

*THUD!*  This was FABULOUS!  Be sure to beat it well, don't let it fall, etc.

I substituted butter flavoring for most of the vanilla extract.  Let it cool, but don't let it sit overnight before depanning.  Try it with chocolate shavings over the top!

Very simple and very delicious.  I actually ran out of sour cream and used fat free vanilla yogurt instead. The cake still turned out great!  I snuck a slice right out of the oven, and was NOT impressed.  After the cake cooled, it tasted like a whole different cake!  Light and moist. One of the better scratch cake recipes I have tried.

This cake is literally the best thing I have ever tasted in my life. It is so moist, and the butter sauce added from the bottom pushes it into the perfection category. Mmmmm... I used this recipe to compete at the local county fair and I received a purple, the highest ribbon. The judge also commented that it was one of the best things she had ever tasted as well.

Fresh out the oven it was great but not at all what I was hoping for. It wasn't moist and did not taste like pound cake. I was so disappointed. Don't get me wrong my kids love it! It just wasn't the buttery melt in your mouth slice of heaven I was craving.

Excellent cake. My kids and hubby raved about it. Because I'm still trying to lose baby weight, I subbed 1 cup egg beaters for 4 eggs , 3/4 cup Truvia baking sugar for 1 and 1/2  cups white sugar, 1/4 cup Splenda brown sugar blend for 1/2 cup regular brown sugar and I Can't Believe it's Not Butter sticks for regular butter. The cake was still very decadent tasting. I can't imagine how wonderful it would be with real butter! I will make it the real way for company and the light way for me! My bake time was 75 minutes and it was perfect. I didn't do the butter sauce because I forgot and just dusted with powdered sugar. It was sweet and delicious and really didn't need to butter sauce, but next time I make this I will try the sauce.

Divine! Just made this now and it turned out perfect and so rich! Couldn't wait for it to cool down and just ate it warm with a cup of tea. Used a springform tin, brown sugar instead of white, and milk & yogurt mix instead of sour cream. Bliss :)

My family loved this cake. Nobody could wait for it to cool, it was 3/4 gone by then. We're gonna make again for Easter.

This cake was quite good.  I have to admit that I didn't do the butter sauce, however I can see how this cake could seem dry to some, as it did to me somewhat.  Next time I think I will try substituting oil for part of the butter; I've have good success in doing that with other cake recipes to make them moister.

I'm not much of a baker - followed exactly  - it came out fine - maybe a little too sweet.

It was delicious and my husband loved it so yes I'll be making it again and again. I wouldn't change a thing because it's perfect, although I would like to increase the amount of brown sugar because I prefer it's taste to that of white sugar. I might try to increase the amount of brown sugar and decrease the amount of white sugar, maybe switch them using half a cup of white sugar and 1 & a half cups of brown sugar.

Great recipe.... the butter sauce was the best.  I wish I could find a way to get it on the top of the cake instead of just the bottom....... but will make again

Everyone but me loved this cake. The flavor was not as intense as I anticipated even though I used wood kabob sticks to poke the holes in the cake. (Be careful, you don't want to break the cake up) My daughter and I had shared a piece of butter cake in a restaurant so I was looking for a like recipe but this unfortunately was not it so I will keep looking.
