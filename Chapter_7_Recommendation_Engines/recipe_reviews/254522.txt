This was wonderful. I doubled the marinade as I had two steaks. I subbed fig balsamic wine vinegar as it's what I had.  Otherwise, it was the same.  I put steaks in a ziplock bag and poured the marinade in and refrigerated 24 hours,  turning occasionally. When I took one out to put on the grill,  I left the other in all the marinade and froze it in the bag for another meal. We loved this.

1. There is no substitute for Dijon Mustard. But we were out of “my” Grey Poupon and substituted hubby’s French’s Yellow. Don’t Do It! Just don’t!

I always marinade my meats over night~turning occasionally. I wouldn't change anything. This steak was tender and delicious. I will definitely do again.

I did not have flank steak so I used flat iron steak.  The flavor subtle but quite good.  The steak itself was extremely tender, but I am unsure if this is due to the vinegar or the steak.  I put the steak in the marinade at 10am and grilled it at 7pm today.  I would definitely make this again.
