Great!  2 things I did differently: bake the beans at 375 for about 25 minutes rather than fry them.  I sprayed a cookie sheet w/non-fat cooking spray prior to placing the beans on top.  And I used egg substitute instead of one egg.  Our whole family enjoyed them!  I'll def make them again & prob will make a large batch so I can freeze some.  Thanks for sharing this!

Following others' advice, I spread these on a cookie sheet and baked at 375 for about 20 minutes, rather than frying.  They were nice and crispy; a relatively easy option for green beans that's fun for the kids!

Great recipe. I also ommitted the pre cooking step. I actually used frozen whole green beans unthawed. Still turned out awesome. This is a keeper.

I'm giving this recipe a 5 but I really have no idea if that's true. I took a previous reviewer's notes on baking the beans rather than deep frying them because I'm always trying to lower fat/cals on recipes. BIG mistake with this one. Make it just the way it's written, deep fry the heck out of these suckers, I'm sure they're delicious. Whatever you do, don't bake them, they're tasteless textureless sticks of breading. One day when I'm feeling really skinny I'll try this recipe deep fried and I'm sure I'll be happy with it.

Delicious...just like the ones I order at a famous-chain restaurant we have here, only now I can save myself the trip, the crowd, the wait...not to mention the cost!  Tastes great dipped in ranch dressing mixed with Tabasco sauce!

We have these at TGI Friday's and decided to try them after finding haricots verts at Sam's. The result was very close to Friday's - tender and crispy. My only changes - I did not cook the beans first, left out the chili powder, used fresh bread crumbs, and added salt - you really do need some salt. I also sprinkled them with shredded Parmesan before I served them. The bread crumbs make a light, crispy crust - much better than just flour - and although I liked the fresh bread crumbs I used, I will try Panko next time. I made fresh buttermilk dressing for a dip  and added horseradish to mine.

These were pretty good but a bit on the bland side. Next time I make them I will most likely kick the spices up a notch.  Everybody enjoyed them though...there was just something missing.  It was a fun way to use the leftover green beans from my garden that I didn't can.  We dipped these in a jalapeno ranch dressing made my Lighthouse and that was yummy.

very good! I would recommend only frying for a about 30 seconds, otherwise they will burn.  Skim the oil often to remove impurities or they will stick to your grean beans. I made sure that the green beans were rinsed with very cold water to make sure that they remained crisp. Great alternative to regualr fries. I served these with turkey burgers stuffed with cheddar cheese.

These were very good.  My kids didn't even complain once and ate them all.  I would add some salt to the dry mixture as the salt doesn't stick that great after they are fried.  These are putsy but a good use for an abundance of produce and at least you get to eat your veggies, even if they're fried.

I made these last year and liked them so much that as soon as the beans where ready I hunted down this recipe.

Like a lot of others I bake them rather than frying them, not for health reasons, simply because it's easier and I can't be bothered to fry them.

I've seen others saying that they don't blanch the beans before they make them. I gave this a shot and I have to say despite the added step, time and effort of blanching them (especially when you have quite a few) it is really worth it. They are much more tender inside, especially if you have larger beans.

Made as is using bread crumbs with *Italian* seasoning (the recipe did not specify what types of seasoning the bread crumbs might be).  The result?  An almost perfectly balanced set of flavors..., however..... As noted already, these NEED salt. After tasting the first beans out of the fry pan and identifying the NEED for salt, and therefore after adding salt, hubby loved 'em enough to insist on making them again.  These beans are time consuming, especially if you are alone in the kitchen (but if you parboil or steam extra beans in the pre-cook stage, the extra beans can marinate in dressing for another day, which saves time overall).  Time consuming or not, I'm happy to make these fun beans with my hubby ***if**** he's happy to help (and what do you know, he is! woohoo!).  Besides, I'm sure he won't want to make them every day, so I can use lower calorie recipes the rest of the time!  The results?  Happy hubby, happy kitchen, happy green beans, happy me!

Made these tonight and... wow! I've never had green bean fries before, but they sounded good and looked great, so I gave it a try. Everyone loved them, even the picky, normally-green-bean-hating 8-year-old!

I made them almost exactly as in the recipe, however, I did make a few minor changes. After reading many of the comments here about needing salt, I used garlic salt instead of powder and also added in a teaspoon of Lawry's seasoned salt. I didn't have any onion powder on hand, so I used dried onion flakes instead. My bread crumbs were italian, if that makes a difference for anyone. 

I deep fried each batch for 3 minutes, and they came out perfectly. Sprinkled them lightly with salt and then we dipped them in ranch dressing. A huge hit here!

This was delicious!  We used peanut oil for its high smoke point and made sure it was between 375 and 400 degrees.  The green beans will absorb only about 8-15% oil at these temps and the crispier the better!

These turned out pretty well for me!  I did things a little differently.  I tossed the spices with the flour in a large plastic bag.  I did NOT precook the beans per the advice of other reviewers.  I ran the beans under cold water, tossed them in the bag with the flour and spices, dredged through the egg/milk, and tossed them in Panko bread crumbs for extra crunch.  I don't have a deep fryer, so in a frying pan I heated vegetable oil (enough to cover a single layer of beans) over low-medium heat.  I then fried the beans in single layers for about 4 minutes, turning them over half way through until golden brown.  Lost 1 star because they are QUITE greasy (think onion rings), but that's likely due to my technique!  I just sprinkled with salt afterwards to bump up the flavor, like you would french fries.  LOTS of work (took me ~2 hours to do a double batch) but I'd make these again!

A few of the comments mention baking the green beans instead of deep frying. I tried that version on my first batch and it is good (and much healthier). On my second batch, I tried deep frying and OMG it is so delicious!

I loved these! I followed someone else's suggestion and mixed the flour in with the bread crumbs. I dredged them in the flour mix, then in the egg/milk and back in the flour. I deep fried them for 2 minutes (I did precook them as well). I sprinkled on a tiny bit of sea salt when they were hot. I also made a wasabi-ranch dipping sauce. (1/2 C cucumber, 3/4 C ranch dressing, 1 Tbsp lemon juice, 1 -2 Tbsp wasabi; mix in blender or processor; chill for a couple of hours). Delicious!

Fry these.  I'm here to tell you that baking them is NOT the same.  It really does take it down at least a star -- probably 2.  I won't make these again without frying them.

fantastic recipe. i went crazy adding lots of seasonings to the bread crumbs, and it ended up great. its really forgiving. it does need a bit of salt in my opinion.

This was a HUGE hit with the entire family.  Followed the directions as given.  I used frozen green beans but still followed the directions.  It made A LOT... so be sure you need all 8 servings, next time I would probably just do half.(for a family of 4)  Also, had to search for a good dipping recipe, and found this one to make with ingredients I had on hand... ZESTY DIPPING SAUCE; 1/3c ketchup, 1/3c mayonnaise, 1T Worcestershire sauce, 1/4t ground black pepper, 1/8t garlic salt.  Combine and whisking to blend. Store in refrigerator until ready to use.

One of my new favorite side dishes, especially since my picky daughter gobbles them up! Made just as recipe is written. Even my husband who fears some vegetables came back for seconds and thirds. Served with a chipotle ranch dip.

No need to cook the beans first.  I just picked them, rinsed, floured, and then followed the rest of the recipe.  They turned out great.  Very tasty!

Makes a lot!  Next time I will only make 1/4 to 1/2 lb for 2 people.  I did as some others and only cooked for about 30 seconds to 1 minute but I think the published 2 minutes would be better.  I used an electric fry pan instead of a deep fryer, it worked great.  Will add more seasonings next time.

Super yummy and totally addicting.  Rather than blanche the green beans in boiling water, I simply rinsed them in the sink and quick steamed them in the microwave.  Then pour off the water and through some flour in the container, shake and all the beans are coated.  They also retain more nutrients by a quick steam.  I also added Lite Salt to the crumb mixture. I loved them, but my kids and hubby were not fooled and would not eat them....oh well, more for me!!!! LOL

I'm rating this recipe based on some changes, so be aware. I added some seasoning salt to spice it up a bit and mixed in some trimmed asparagus with the green beans for variety. Instead of boiling the veggies, I popped them in the microwave for 3ish minutes to cook them thru. Instead of using flour to coat, I divided the bread crumb mixture into two bowls and dipped once in bread crumbs, once in the egg mixture, and then again in the bread crumbs. The only reason I gave this version four stars instead of five was because the coating didn't stick as well as I would've liked, but again that could've been from the way I did it. The flavor was otherwise excellent, we gobbled them all up!

very simple and easy. The only things I changed was I used whole wheat flower and I baked the green beans without boiling them. I baked them on a cookie wire rack at 400 for about 25-30 min.

My husband and I thought these were delicious.  I used olive oil to fry them, and a large pan b/c I don't have a fryer which the recipe calls for.  They aren't incredibly healthy with all the olive oil I had to use, but they were yummy!!!

I expected these green bean fries to taste like the ones we order when we go out to eat.  Unfortunately, they didn't.  The bread crumbs made them taste like green beans wrapped in toast.  Not a hit in this house.

I swapped out the bread crumbs for tempura batter (I've never liked breaded anything) and deep fried as in the recipe.  I used two kinds of dipping sauce for variety, ranch and a horseradish sauce.

This is a good clone recipe.  Thank you, Rinne77.

Mods:  Did not pre-cook the beans, just dredged, dipped, and breaded the raw green beans.  Halved the recipe, except the spices, and added 1 tsp salt.  Baked for 15 minutes at 400 degrees.  Dipped alternately in Ninja Burger Secret Sauce, 50-50 mix prepared horseradish and mayo, and wasabi sauce left over from restaurant green bean fries.  Would make own wasabi sauce next time, as restaurant stuff was weak.  Used three bowls for dredging, dipping, and breading.

These were terrific! I used Italian bread crumbs and a handful of Parmesan cheese to coat. Fried them lightly, and I got about 10 of them. My DH ate the rest! Am planning to make them tonight with tequila shrimp and spinach salad. Won't make the mistake of letting him go first, though!!!

They were okay but the bread crumbs were too clumpy. I would try again but maybe without the bread crumbs.

These beans were delicious...just like TGIF.  I used panko bread crumbs that tended to fall off in the oil, so next time I will try 'regular' bread crumbs.  For the sauce I used some ranch dressing mixed wtih mayo and wasabi.  Yum.

Tastes better than the major chain restaurant!  I used plain bread crumbs and added seasoned salt. Omitted onion powder because I couldn't find it in the cabinet.  And used freshly milled wheat flour.  Delicious!

The first time I made these, I fried them. They turned out too greasy. The next time I made them, I did like other reviewers and baked at 350 for 15 minutes or so. They were great this way!! This will definitely be a keeper in my family!

Excellent and very good.  i love fried foods that some type of nutritional value.  To make a lower carb version, I put 3 heaping tbs of flour on the green beans after drying them, then I added 3 heaping tbs of bread crumbs.  I then added the egg on top.  Hand-mixed then pan fried in coconut oil (a healthier oil.)  Definetly a keeper recipe!!!

I agree that with the amounts of chili, garlic, and onion powder they didn't have that much flavor. I used Italian breadcrumbs and scaled back the breadcrumbs to one cup and added a little more of the seasonings to see if that would help and it didn't. Next time I will add more seasoning and may try skipping the flour since most of it came off when I dipped the beans into the egg. It might also help with the flavor as well.

These were really good. I used some frozen green beans I got from Sam's Club and deep fried them. I like them better than potato fries. and my son the, "green bean king" loved them. And my daughter didn't hate them, so that was lovely.

I didn't have "seasoned" bread crumbs, just plain bread crumbs, so I probably should have added something else to it to season it up a bit, but it was still good.  I just added a lot of salt at the end and dipped in ranch dressing.  Good base recipe that can be seasoned the way you want it.

These green bean fries were the best. I didn't have enough regular breadcrumbs so I used 1/2 breadcrumbs and 1/2 panko bread crumbs. They came out excellent. Fun way to get kids to get their veggies.

I tried baking these like other people said they did. BIG mistake, the breading didn't brown or get crispy enough. So I threw them into a frying pan with a little oil for a few seconds to get them brown and crispy. After doing that they were awesome! I will fry next time just how the recipe is.

I give this one 5 stars because it was such an unexpected surprise how good they were.  The only changes I made were to tweak the seasonings to my taste a bit and to steam the beans instead of boiling them.  In the end this was a fantastic conversation piece for the meal and they tasted so good that the plate barely made it to the table.

A delicious recipe! I do however suggest that you do not cook the green beans before coating them. The overall texture is better a little crisp and not boiling also maintains more nutrition.

These were excellent, only giving 4 stars because they were time consuming.  Well worth it though.  I did add a little extra of the seasonings and was glad I did, might have been a little bland without the extra seasoning.

My son requested this one and I'm glad he did.  Big hit.  While we were at it (this is some work) we parboiled some cauliflower and then fried with the same breading.  Both were quite tasty!!

So easy to make at home. A wonderful treat...so much more flavorful than traditional french fries! I would recommend more chili powder which helps add more "color" and flavor to the batter. Also, I only flash-fried the beans in very hot oil (just until the batter crisped and browned 10-20 seconds). I finished them in the oven for about 10 minutes at 375.

Turned out OK, not quite as good as the restaraunts. I made the dip out of a packet of Uncle Dan's Ranch dip, following the directions on the back with sour cream, then mixed in a little bit of horseradish, the dip made them taste better!

A delicious game day snack or dinner appetizer.  What ever you do don't forget to coat them w/ flour first.  I forgot this step and my first batch came out of the oil with barely any coating stuck to them.  I served these with a mayo/sour cream/horseradish dip from the "fried chicken tenders" recipe on this site.  Yum-o!

I followed the recipe except I fried some as indicated by the recipe and some I baked in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes as others have done.  My teenage grandson said he liked the baked green beans best.  I did use canola spray on the cookie sheet and lightly over the top before putting the beans in the oven.  We all agreed we liked them best dipped in Larrupin Swedish Style  Dill Mustard Sauce.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

This was my first time trying green bean fries and they were a big hit with my wife and daughter.  The spice blend for the batter was very good and we used a chipotle ranch dressing as a dip which gave them a little more pop.  Hardest part was getting the oil cooking temperature right since I don't have a deep fryer with a temperature setting.  The first batch cooked too fast but after adjusting they came out crispy and just right,

I followed the advice of some reviewers and baked rather than fried these. They ended up being a little on the dry side and needing lots of dipping sauce, and I wonder if this is because of the baking. I also added some red pepper flakes and Parmesan cheese to the batter - which had an amazing flavor! I think I'll fry them next time to see if that makes a difference...

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and baked them. They turned pretty good, but next time I'll add a little more seasoning to kick the flavor up some. 
I mixed some buttermilk ranch dressing and sriracha sauce together for a great dipping sauce. Next time I'll try them fried to compare.

Yum! I did bake them instead of frying (350 degrees for 25 minutes) and they came out great! Will make again!

Delicious but a lot of work and a ton of dishes to clean afterwards!  Added 1 tsp salt to breadcrumb mixture and was great.

I'm so excited I found this recipe!Made an account just to rate it. I followed the recipe almost exactly with one major adjustment: I actually used canned green beans, as it was all I had. Came out amazing still, and because they were canned there was no lack of salt as others had said. I had garlic and herb bread crumbs and fried in vegetable oil, I had no deep fryer. They were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, absolutely delicious. I recommenced trying the canned beans because they're cheaper and often on hand, and made less prep work. Not necessarily the healthiest option but still better than other fried foods. Thanks again!

Really good! I used a frozen green bean and wax bean mix (oldest son thought the wax beans were french fries, score) just thawed them out on paper towels to absorb moisture so I skipped the blanching part. Served them with ranch for a dipping sauce. Enjoyed by the entire family.

As others suggested, I baked these at 375 for 25 minutes instead of frying them.  A couple additional suggestions: the original recipe calls for way more flour and bread crumbs than is actually needed to coat the green beans.  You could probably cut both in half to avoid waste.  Also, place the flour and bread crumbs in 2 separate bowls with a lid, place the beans in the bowl during the respective steps, and shake to coat.  It saves so much time compared to doing it by hand.  Great veggie snack!

Loved thees!  I added a little salt and a pinch of cayenne to the seasonings.  Per the tip of another reviewer I made a cucumber wasabi horseradish dipping sauce to go with.  I found one on this site as part of the recipe "Crispy Green Beans with Horseradish-Wasabi Sauce" in which I doubled up the cucumbers, so the sauce recipe I made was 1/2 c ranch dressing,  almost a 1/2 c finely chopped, peeled and seeded cucumber, 1 T milk, 1 t wasabi powder, 1 1/2 t prepared horseradish, pinch cayenne, 1/8 t salt, a pinch of pepper (my addition).  Blend in blender.  Thickens a little in refrigerator.

I thought I'd save myself one extra step and bake these instead of frying like another reviewer said. If I ever try this again I will for sure fry them.

I baked these for about 20 minutes and then pan fried them in a few tablespoons of oil for a couple minutes to add the extra crisp.  They were awesome and the kids can't wait for me to make them again!

I made these the other night--easy peasy, and they were so delicious. I used frozen organic green beans and didn't cook them before hand, though. I did, however, dredge them in flour first, before dipping them in egg and then breadcrumbs.  I fried them in my deep fryer.  My kiddos loved them (and getting them to eat veggies can be quite a challenge).

I'm not really a "green-beaner" but I tried these out and LOVED them.  I used frozen Green Beans; boiled a few minutes until bright green, floured, milk/egg dipped, and coated with the breadcrumb mixture.  Served hot with Chipolte Ranch dressing.

Followed recipe exactly.  They were a bit bland.  Next time I think im going to try a different breader/batter.  The beans themselves had good texture and flavor.  Breader didnt hold up too well and lacked some flavor.  Overall they were good but not great.

I'll give five stars to any recipe that shortens the list of things I can only get if I go to a restaurant. Instead of taking the family out and spending 50/60.00, I spent about 6 bucks for green beans and a bottle of chipotle ranch and everything else I already have. These are super easy to make and satisfying and a tad healthier than some of its other fried counterparts. I agree on the baking in the oven. yum!

Delicious! I even messed up a little (mixing the flour WITH the breadcrumbs) and they still came out delicious. But you definitely do need to add some salt. Next time I'll try baking them.

These have potential, I just didn't have the luck to do it right the first time. I tried baking it at 350 for 25 minutes like I read in so many other reviews, big mistake. I don't know how to describe the texture that was left, but it was not appealing, to say the least. So, I tried to crisp them up in a pot with oil (we don't have a fryer). Didn't get it quite right this batch, but I am sure I will with the next. Note to others: They don't take long in the fryer so be quick and (as sick as the thought may be) SKIP the oven!

I tried this with panko bread crumbs, and it worked well for extra crunch.  Next time I will try the breadcrumbs to compare.  Lost one star because there is no need to precook the beans.  They were perfect starting fresh

I thought these were ok, but my husband really liked them.  I did not boil the green beans first.  I just trimmed the fresh greenbeans, breaded them, and then fried.  The texture was very good, very tender.  I do not think the boiling step would be necessary at all.

Not exactly nutritious, but oh-so-delicious! I used Italian bread crumbs and made these in a mini fry daddy. For sauce I mixed ranch dressing with a few dashes of chipotle tabasco...it was perfect! Yummy-yum! We were hoping the green beans and the sauce would be as yummy as those served at the Twisted Root Burger restaurant here in Dallas...they were not exactly the same but close enough to make us very happy!

I used Italian bread crumbs instead of all the spices. I then took the spices from this recipe and mixed them in ranch dressing to make a dip. Very good appetizer.

Firstly, let me say I did not make these as originally posted, and instead tried baking them to avoid deep frying.
I found them lacking in the flavour department, and although the kids didn't mind them, they had to dip them in various sauces to make them taste good (plum sauce, ranch, etc.)
I personally prefer my beans o'natural to this recipe.

I made these for a pot luck at the plant and the guys scarfed them down like candy!  Seriously - two batches of green beans and there wasn't a crumb left.  I cheated and used Bird'sEye green bean steamers and they cooked up great!

Per some of the other reviewers, I decided to bake these as we're not big on frying at my house. Not sure what happened, but these were just good, not great. Something was missing. Followed the recipe exactly with exception of the frying. Oh well, at least I ate my beans. :)

I also baked them rather than frying. I sprinkled them with a little salt after I took them of the oven and served with fat free ranch for dipping.

These were so fabulous!!! We couldn't get enough of them.  I followed the advice of another reviewer & used frozen green beans & omitted the precooking & they turned out great.  We will definitely have these again & again. Thanks!

A keeper... the whole family liked them a lot!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I did not boil the beans prior to breading.  They were fine just fried without pre-cooking. The recipe works great to make fried okra too.  Just substitute sliced okra for the beans.
