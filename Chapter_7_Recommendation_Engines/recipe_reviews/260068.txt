Easy and tasty sugar-free base cookie, although it didn't have the texture of a cane sugar cookie. After doing my on investigation of stevia products, Pyure is near the top of pure stevia. This recipe and stevia product definitely has a place for those that are sugar restricted, or just want to be.

These are interesting cookies.  Mine came out almost like a biscuit/cake.  I can't explain it, but, to me, it had that kind of texture to it.  Okay, so I'm not a huge lover of  Stevia, but I was glad to try this recipe.  In the past, my tastebuds have not take kindly to it.  However, I used Pyure Stevia and was pleasantly surprised with the taste of this recipe. I think if I were to experiment more, I might try something with this combination and adding pumpkin.  It just seems like it would be SO right!  Anyways, I was glad to be able to try this out and see that alternatives are worth trying!  I wouldn't binge eat these cookies, but I do think the recipe would make a great base recipe for more ideas.

These turned out well - and I'm surprised at how little Stevia it takes to make these work!

I used a grain-free flour blend and made a glaze with cinnamon and confectioner's sugar.  Yum!

This is a lightly sweetened, lightly spiced cookie. Perfect for a fall, sugar-free treat.
