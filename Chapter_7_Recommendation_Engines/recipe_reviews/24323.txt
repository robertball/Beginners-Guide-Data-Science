If I had one piece of advice about this recipes it's this: OMIT THE BUTTER. I put all the ingredients in a pan (and included an egg per the advice from a previous review.), and when I went to add the butter, I went with my gut instinct to leave it out. This turned out delicious, very creamy, not soupy. The bacon adds a great flavor. Think I'll garnish with scallions next time. Great recipe!

My family loves this recipe.  I added a couple of eggs to mine to bind things together, and also used the new pre-cooked bacon so it was really quick to put together.

I don't know if I used the wrong ingredients, but this did not turn out very well.  It calls for way too much butter, leaving a pool on top.  I used velvetta cheese for the processed cheese and that was a mistake.  It turned out tasting salty and greasy. I was really looking forward to this and it was a disappoinment.

This was OK. I didn't add the butter and used cheddar cheese. My kids normally eat corn but they didn't care for this.

I wouldn't have believed that you could go wrong with corn, cheese, bacon, and butter, but apparently it's possible.  This thing turned out like giant vat of grease.  I don't think I'll try it again even with modifications!

Amazing!! I followed some of the other advice and used half as much butter, it is still a little too much in my opinion and I may take it down further in the future.

Really yummy - used about 2 1/2 cups of fresh sweet corn and 2 tbsp butter. Reminds me of one of my favorite KC BBQ places!

Oh, this is rich and good. I tried it at Thanksgiving a few years ago, and everyone raved about it. Makes a huge batch, though. . . we had lots of leftovers.

I must have done something wrong because this never thickened.  But it still tasted great and everyone enjoyed it.

Yummy!  It kind of tastes like barbequed corn.  It's very easy and everyone raves about it!  I love this as a summer side dish served with hamburgers or steaks on the grill!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a BBQ and while everyone loved it, we have renamed it "Corn Soup" because it never thickened up.

The flavor was salty and greasy and runny.  It says to cook until set but it never did.  I didn't have any bacon so I subbed a small amount of smoked ham.  I live in KC and love cheesy corn.  This was not what I expected.  When I make this again, I will leave out the butter and add a tablespoon or so of whole milk to create the sauce.  The egg also sounds like a good idea.  I'll let you know how it turns out.

A note from the submitter: it's not supposed to thicken up. If you go to any BBQ in Kansas City, this is what you'll get, served in a small cup. It is kind of like the soup.

I substituted ham for the bacon and cut the butter in half. I would say this the way to go and maybe put some crispy bacon on top after its done cooking.

I scaled this recipe in half and after reading the other reviews I decided not to use butter at all but just a little bit of grease that the bacon cooked in. For the cheese I used Velveeta and I did half original and half blanco. The blanco doesn't taste as salty to me so I like to incorporate that blend whenever I can.  I am originally from Kansas City and my favorite BBQ joint is Gates and they do not offer cheesy corn so I have nothing to compare this to.  I know a lot of them do though so I will have to check their cheesy corn out the next time I am up that way. I didn't have any issues with this recipe and it thickened up just fine for me so I guess the key is cutting way back on the butter.
