This is very tasty and I haven't had any issues with grey eggs when I have made it (a few times now).  If you use fresh herbs and don't overcook the eggs, it's perfect.  Really nice change from the usual boring scramble.

I planned to prepare these for some weekend guests, and had to quickly toss them out and whip up some regular scrambled eggs in their place. The taste was fine, I suppose (although not preferable to just plain eggs, as far as I'm concerned), but as they were cooking, all those green herbs turned the otherwise beautiful yellow eggs the most unappetizing color of greyish-green I've ever seen. How embarrassing! No way I was serving that to visitors, so they were promptly tossed in the trash can.

I did not have any  tarragon, so I substituted it with fennel. I usually don't like eggs,  but the herbs made them wonderful!

These were okay but certainly didn't look appetizing at all. My eggs came out really pale in color and too much green stuff. The herbs were indeed sweet tasting and it was a nice change from plain scrambled eggs, but not really my preference. I thought they were okay but would not fix them again. Thanks, I enjoyed trying a new dish.

When I saw that this recipe had gotten ratings on both the high and low ends of the spectrum, I was curious to try it for myself...I had no problem with the color of the eggs and thought the herb flavor was a nice addition to  plain scrambled eggs.

My eggs did not turn green or grey. They actually looked like restaurant-quality herbed eggs. The trick is to add the herbs AFTER you pour eggs in the pan. And don't over mix your eggs. Just fold them a few times. DO NOT stir frequently as the recipe suggests.  Also, be sure you like sweet eggs. The name doesn't lie. The herbs make the eggs pretty sweet. PS. Add a tablespoon of pancake mix to make them fluffy.

The color almost turned us off, but my teenage son still enjoyed these eggs.

A fresh, light egg dish that comes together quickly.  It is not
going to impress your gourmet friends, but it is well worth
the small time and ingredient investment.
