I loved the idea of using garbanzo beans in these bars! I ended up not having as many berries as I thought I had, so used apples and pears to have enough fruit.    The flavor is delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Original post of 5 stars:  I tried these for the first time today and was pleased with the results!  Because I don't own a food processor, I used my KitchenAid mixer to make the bottom layer and it worked out just fine.  I used my 7x11 baking dish, so the bottom needed 30 minutes to bake instead of 20.  I will possibly try baking it in a bigger dish next time.  The only change I made to the bottom layer was to add just a shake of salt instead of the whole 1/4 t.  I made the blueberry mixture just as it said to.  I also made the top just as suggested, although I'm going to add cinnamon next time.  I baked them for about 25 minutes and couldn't wait until they were cool to take a bite!  These would definitely be good with some ice cream or Cool Whip, especially when warm!  I was hesitant to bake with garbanzo beans, but now I won't be anymore.  Thanks for sharing your healthy recipe, Janet!  Edit with change to 2 stars: Turns out these blueberry squares were good only for the first day.  After that, they turned very soggy and inedible. I ended up throwing away over half of the recipe.

For being a vegan dessert, this recipe was nearly as good as the buttery fruit bars. Only real change I made was using Mazola corn oil, mostly, as I only had about 2 Tblsp left of olive oil. I like that this had a lot of fiber with the beans, rolled oats, and all of the blueberries and it used oil instead of butter or shortening. Although, I could slightly taste the garbanzo beans. They do have a distinct taste. Also, the crust starts to get soggy by the 2nd day in the fridge. So, consider that with 24 bars, even if they are on the small size. Also, with the fruit, a large pack of blueberries, or whole sales club size, is really needed to get 3 full cups unless lucky enough to have a blueberry bush with abundant berries available. I used a 12 1/2 x 8 1/2 x 2-inch disposable pan sprayed with PAM. The bars cut out very nicely, but the topping is a little lose. Freshly made it was rather tasty with a little whipped topping or vanilla ice cream.

The taste for a vegan dessert was great! A couple of adjustments I'd make next time: I'd use a 9x13 pan, and I'd add water or vegan spread like Earth Balance or something. I used fresh raspberries and it was yummy!

Really great dessert without too much guilt! I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon & 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to both the crust and the topping. Gave it the added flavor other reviewers indicated it needed. I agree there was too much topping, especially flour. Plan to cut back on that next time and maybe add a little more oil to help it congeal better.

Surprisingly good!  Served w/ a dallop of honey greek yogurt, a great snack for kids (or who are we kidding, a treat).  Full of protein, fiber, vitamins.

Very tasty! A bit sweet though, so I'll add less sugar. And the topping volume was too much compared to the blueberry and crust. Will definitely make it again.

When you put the three cups of blueberries, expect to add a half to three quarters of a cup of sugar to make the flavor decent.  Also expect to leave the three layers in the oven at 350 for an hour.  Thirty minutes will not be long enough to get a golden brown top crust.

Awesomely tasty and not too sweet! I mistakenly didn’t add enough baking powder to the garbanzo beans and it came out a little gooey bu still tasted great. Next time I’ll get it right.

terrible recipe.  topping ends up basically being a thick layer of flour - who wants to put that in their mouth?  need butter or more oil to make it into a crumbly crust/topping.  overall, very disappointed.

I too found the bottom crust very wet so I added more oats and a bit more brown sugar. I agree that the topping amount is much more than needed.

This dessert was delicious!  I used coconut oil instead of olive oil and I added1/2 tsp. cinnamon and nutmeg in the crust and the topping.  Our company loved it and even ate seconds!

It is not done yet but there seems to be flour missing in the first step.  My  food processor concoction was so wet that it was like batter rather than dough.   Is there a missing ingredient? I doubled the oatmeal and still could not get it to be like dough.

Tasted good, but I think next time I'll add cinnamon to the topping and maybe some add some butter to the topping since it didn't really act as a crumble to me. My daughter thought there was figs in the bar, but I think that was the garbanzo beans she was tasting in the crust.

Delicious recipe!! But I will cut back on the topping the next time. I did add some cinnamon to the topping. I will be interested to try coconut oil next time instead of olive oil. Highly recommended recipe and I am not vegan. My husband loved them too.

Rated this recipe high due to the positive health factor, yet still a dessert!  Taste needs increased a bit.  The only change I did to this recipe was add some cinnamon.  Next time, will add some lemon zest and more cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. But overall, I enjoyed it.

This was delish! I did add some cinnamon in with the crust ingredients.  Came out very yummie! Also sprinkled top with cinnamon and sugar before baking. Can't wait to try this recipe with apple or raspberry!
