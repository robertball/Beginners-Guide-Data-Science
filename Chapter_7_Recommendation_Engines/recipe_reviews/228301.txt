this was FANTASTIC! The chopping takes a little time but it is a perfect family dinner! It was a big hit with both the veggie-picky husband and the voracious toddler :)

This is great with the best ratio of sweet and tangy. I am not that crazy about ground turkey but this recipe makes it good. Also - Glen B : TAKE YOUR PHOTO DOWN !IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RECIPE!!

Very good, can adjust seasonings as needed. The picture does not appear to match the recipe, however!

Loved it, great flavor and nice to have a serving of veggies in there. I excluded the hot stuff for the kids and it was still really good.

Pretty good! I used a little less turkey and added more vegetables. For the heat, I only had a couple small jalapenos on hand. The sauce was very good. Will be making this one again.
