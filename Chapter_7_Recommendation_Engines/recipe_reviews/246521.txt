This recipe does take a fair amount of  time so plan wisely. We really liked this loaf. Very flavourful with a nice crust. Instead of leaving the dough on the counter for 15 minutes I lined a bowl with parchment paper and put the dough in the bowl. This made it much easier to transfer the dough into the pot. Other than that I made this as written.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

Finally a rye bread recipe that works for me! I was about to give up on ever finding one that wasn't heavy and gummy. This recipe is so easy and delicious. I did make one change, just because I'm getting weaker in my old age. I didn't preheat the dutch oven, I lined the pot with parchment paper, dusted some cornmeal in the bottom, and baked for 45 minutes at 450 degrees. It was perfect. Thank you so much for the recipe. It's a keeper.

The only change I made was to add 1 tablespoon of oil.  Even though you have to time the process, it is quite an easy recipe .I loved how it looked so artisan and earthy.  Not to mention delicious. Will definitely  make this again.

After putting this bread on the baking sheet (after the dutch oven part), I baked it a lot longer00 maybe 20-25 minutes more. Also, I spritzed it with water.

This recipe changed the way I bake bread -- finally SUCCESS at a European-style boule!  Thank you.  Deep rich brown color, thick chewy crust and soft interior. Fantastic flavor.  I don't keep buttermilk on hand so substituted 1/4 cup soy milk with two tsp of cider vinegar added. Didn't proof yeast liquid - simply added everything to bowl.  Also after the 18 hour rise I used spatula to fold/stretch dough over itself in quarter turns of the bowl - then set on parchment paper in bowl with wrap to raise to shape for nearly an hour (including oven preheat time to 500 deg).  Gently lifted with parchment into hot dutch oven - cover and bake!  Baked a whole-wheat boule along side it, and even with pan of water on lower rack - crust was not as robust and delicious as this bread.

Have no ideal how heavy this bread should be. It seems to have turned out ok. Really heavy. Pretty easy to make, even with the hours just sitting, waiting. If you'd like a rye bread, this is pretty good. And I used dark rye flour. It's what I had.

Don't know if I did something wrong but the bread was totally raw in the middle . When I cooked it on the baking rack for 40 minutes more, 20 to bring it up to temp and 20 more to cook, It just got harder on the outside. Will try to cook it longer in the dutch oven to see if that helps.  Love the flavor but did not get a positive result.

Love this recipe. I would give it a 5 but, like most artisan breads,  it changes in texture quickly in the following days. It is great on day 1; very flavorful with a nice texture. A little less so on day 2, and then good only for toasting on consecutive days.  Wish I knew how to keep it from getting tough so it could last longer. This recipe continues to be a staple in my house!

So pleased with this recipe! Finally got a large enough Dutch oven to bake loaves in and this was perfect, wet and sticky as many people commented but it SHOULD be to get that steamed crust. 

I made 2....1/2 changes-- used thyme and garlic as I was out of carraway and did the 15 minute rest for 45 minutes IN the bowl. 1. My kitchen was too cold to just do a 15 minute rest and 2. I'm not willing to fight sticky doughs any more than I have to! A few folds in the bowl after the 18 hour rise was PLENTY to shape it and my bowl was big enough to rest it in (the sides could stretch and 'poof' freely). 

Would make again!

After going through the process of making it I said "If it's the best bread I've ever put in my mouth, I'll never make it again".
It was so sticky I could get it out of the pan.  The flavor was fine.   It was just to difficult to make.

The dough was ever so sticky I couldn’t even remove it from bowl.  I left it to rise like 22 hours and it didn’t rise at all. It baked ok, crusty but kind of flat. It also had a very strong funny smell (I think because of caraways?). didn’t work for me. If anyone knows why I’ll try again.

Oh my goodness!! This rye bread is soooo good!! Didn't make any changes. Must put half in the freezer or I will eat it all!! Crunchy on the outside, but not too crunchy and soft chewy moist on the inside. I baked the dough in a pampered chef large round roaster (they don't sell that type anymore)  and I used the pampered chef  11" deep dish baker for the lid. A keeper recipe for sure! I will be posting pictures on my instagram!

Made some awesome rubens with this bread.  Added caraway seed to the recipe.

I've made this bread twice. Fabulous! the 3/8 of a teaspoon threw me though. I just used 3x 1/8 teaspoon and it worked fine. I'm going to try with dark rye flour next!

I'm new to homemade bread making, but it was not exactly easy as it's stated.  I followed the instructions exactly. During step 3 - It was extremely sticky and difficult to work with- even with heavily floured hands, spatula, and work surface.  It came out kind of flat and very dense (not sure why) - had to put it back in the oven because it was not cooked through in the center - so I need to increase my oven times with a lower temp (maybe 450) But overall the flavor of the bread was delicious! I'm going to try it again, because I really enjoyed the process and the bread was very good. I just have to keep practicing :)

Really good!  Was worried that the dough was too sticky, but it turned out beautifully.  Will be making it again for sure.
