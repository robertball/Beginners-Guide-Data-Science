Hi!  After trying this recipe I found I had only one suggestion.  You need to almost double the amount of chocolate you melt down to cover the bars to ensure getting a nice even layer.  I used two extra bars and still didn't have enough.  The only reason why I didn't give the Kid Friendly rating a 5 was because I didn't test this on kids.  I made it for a work treat for my birthday.  Although, these guys could be considered kids, I guess.  Great recipe, and I would definetely use it again!

These are great! To make it easy, I use a bag of milk chocolate chips instead of the chocolate bars. Just put the chocolate chips over the still warm bars, cover and let set for a few minutes to soften, then spread evenly.

These were quick and easy and a sweet treat for the neighbors. I used a corn flake cereal with dried cranberries because that is what I had on hand. I also added an additional layer of peanuts to the top of the peanut butter mixture and pressed it in to get a less sweet outcome. My neighbor likes semi sweet chocolate, so I sprinkled chocolate chips (I don't think the chocolate amount in the recipe would do the trick) over the warm bars and covered with foil until they melted like someone else suggested in the reviews. Spread out the melted chocolate, chill and you are done. Thanks for sharing!

m-m-m!! These are delicious if you like a chewy peanut butter treat. I recommend only covering them in a high quality chocolate (no chips mixed in)I used a higher grade dark chocolate. These are truly awesome!!

This recipe is a lot like the other one. I used chunky peanut butter instead of peanuts, 1/2 cup corn syrup, chocolate chips and 4 c cornflakes. The directions were a lot better stated in this recipe, making them look a little more appetizing than the other one. Still don't taste that great though.

This is a great recipe, but I modded it a bit -- I stirred the melted peanut butter, sugars and corn syrup over the cornflakes, then stirred in the peanuts and *one cup of chocolate chips*. Then, I pressed everything into an aluminum-foil lined pan, which made it easier to get the cut bars out once they were cooled.  I didn't melt any chocolate to pour over the top of them. 
They're awfully sweet, but if you have a super sweet-tooth like mine, you probably won't care.  :)

Wonderful Recipe.  I made these to bring to work before Christmas.  They were gone before noon.  Everyone who tried them loved them.  I also added 1 1/2 cups of peanuts.  Liked them so much, I made a second batch for home the next day.

I came here, looking for my review, and couldn't figure out why I couldn't find it . . . I had put my review on the wrong recipe - "Babe Ruth Bars" - but this is the actual recipe it goes with! [Topped with milk chocolate, rather than chocolate chips stirred in.] So, here is my review of THIS recipe (= [Or rather, my helpful hints - my apologies to review purists ;}] I had this recipe in a beloved cookbook . . . and I was  over-joyed to find it here! I had a horrible time cutting them - my ex had to do it for me wearing heavy-duty gloves to protect his hands. What I ended up doing was making "balls" of the dough and dipping them into melted chocolate [be careful of the hot "dough!"]. . . I make these for my chocolate-hating, Baby Ruth-loving manchild. I roll them into logs and don't dip them in chocolate - for naked Baby Ruth Bars for the chocolate hater. He loves them!

These didn't look as bad as I expected after readign previous reviews. I think the cornflakes sticking out of the chocolate "goo" may be what  others found unappetizing. I did go ahead and sprinkle more chocolate chips and crushed peanuts on top and I ran it back into the microwave briefly so the chips woudl melt a little bit. Really, it would have been OK (especialyl for kids) as written. This one will keep the dentists in business.
