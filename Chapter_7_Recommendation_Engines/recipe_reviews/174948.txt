I don't mean to be insensitive but these were not good at all.  We love ground turkey and cook with it often so it wasn't a matter of not liking "turkey burgers."   I would use the cheese mixture again but maybe with regular ground beef and on a bun with LTO.

This one was tough for my husband to enjoy!  I used fresh Tarragon from what I had left over from another recipe.  I followed the recipe to the mark for the sauce over top and it came out thick and pasty.  We did however enjoy the cooked red onions it said to discard and I think if anything that was what saved the burger.  Wouldn't make it again.

I didnt like these very much, the burger was better without the sauce. The feta cheese is prettty salty so be careful salting the sauce.

I added bread crumbs to the ground turkey and a bit more wine to the sauce.  My family loved them. We'll make them all the time.
