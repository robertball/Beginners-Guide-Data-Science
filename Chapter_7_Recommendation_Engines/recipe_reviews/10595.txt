It's the only biscotti my husband asks for! I omit the chocolate chips, use pecans, and dip them in melted Hershey candy bars when they are done and cold. I also gave some to friends in gift baskets at Christmas. Everyone loved them. I have never had a single problem with crumbling or any of the other problems people have had. I shape them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper (wet your hands so it doesn't stick!) then bake. When it's time to cut you can lift the whole thing off by holding the paper. I never let it cool more than 10 minutes before cutting. I use my very sharp bread knife to gently saw through the biscotti. When it's cut I lift the pieces off with a spatula and put them back on the cookie sheet (without the paper) for the second bake. It works for me!

Excellent flavor, however my biscottis burned a little in the second baking.  I found in a cookbook to lower the temp of the oven the second time around to 250.  I tried it again and they turned out perfect.  We even ate the semi-burnt ones!

Great biscotti recipe! Very chocolately and very good! I left out the nuts and next time I might bake them for 20 minutes vs. 25.  They didn't crumble with I cut into them and they looked great drizzled with melted white chocolate. Perfect treat to go with coffee!

Just one word.....fabulous! I made these yesterday...actually...two batches of them. I took the advice of others and did several things. I added additional coco powder and a pinch of salt as that definitely does bring out the chocolate flavor. Also....I only let then cool for 20 miniutes instead of the recommended 30 minutes and....they cut perfectly. I returned them to the oven after adding just a touch of sugar for only 5 minutes on each side as others also suggested and they were perfect! My mom raved over them...brought her some last night and again this morning  :) My husband brought them to work this morning and I am just waiting to hear what everyone though but I am sure....they will definitely be a winner!!!  I know that I will be using this one again and again  :)

These biscotti's are AMAZING!!!  I noticed some of the reviewers had problems with crumbling, so I baked the first time only until firm.  I let them cool and no problems cutting them!  I cooked them on a silpat too.  Great for baking...nothing sticks.  These are going to be made over and over!! Thanks Linda!!

You have to remember that these are biscotti, not gooey chocolate cookies or brownies, and they will not be as sweet or soft as cookies or brownies.  They're easy to make, shape and cut, and have an understated chocolate taste.  I thought the egg wash gave the tops a nice smooth, shiny appearance and would not leave it off.  However, at least for my oven, the timing is off, and on the second baking the bottoms were starting to burn after only 10 minutes.  Perhaps the second baking requires a lower temperature to harden the biscotti without burning them.

I've been making these frequently over the past couple years and when you follow the recipe exactly, the biscotti are pretty good, but there are some changes I have learned that really improve them. First, don't be afraid to add a little more cocoa. Second, use about 1/8-1/4 tsp salt to taste. Third, experiment with your extracts and oils. Try using 3/4 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp almond extracts. Other flavor variations with oil of Anise, anise seed or fresh tarragon all compliment the chocolate really well and are delicious with coffee or tea. Definitely gives more dimension to the biscotti (although, admittedly, anise is not for everyone). Miniature chocolate chips are not a must, and in fact, we prefer using regular-sized chocolate chips. Cooking time: everyone's oven is a little different, but I usually bake for 20 min at 375F. I let them cool for 10 min before I cut them (waiting the full 30 min seems to increase the crumbling problem) then reduce the heat to 350F. Bake them for 10 min, flip to the other side and bake for 10 min more. For a holiday treat, drizzle with crushed peppermint and white bakers chocolate or almond bark.

Thank you very much for this recipe!!  It is truly the best chocolate biscotti recipe I've tried.  What a great chocolate flavor the chocolate chips added!  I followed your instructions and never broke a single slice.  Try to start cutting with a sarrated knife on one end of the biscotti and slice to the opposite end slowly for best results.  I am making more tomorrow to take to a church dinner on Sunday!

Excellent recipe!  Found that the cookies cut much better with a sharp butcher's knife.  The nuts kept sticking to my serated knives (and I tried several) which caused the cookie to break.  The sharp butcher's knife cut them easily and cleanly making a much nicer looking cookie.  Taste is great, Too!

The dough was a little sticky so have some extra flour on hand for your hands and board. I would bake it a little less next time as well.  The recipe was really good.  I drizzeled a little extra melted chocolate on top.  I broght the cookies to a wedding shower brunch and received wonderful complements.

this was excellent! It's the best biscotti I have ever had. It did not break when cutting it as others had said. I dipped it in white chocolate and delicious!

If you like super chocolately biscotti, then this is definitely for you! It's very easy to make and really yummy. Perfect for your cup of coffee or glass of milk.

It really does taste like a brownie! It didn't turn out dry or hard, like biscotti you buy in the store. Everyone actually really liked it because of this. I used a heaping 1/3 cup of cocoa, and pecans instead of walnuts. Drizzled with both milk and white chocolate. In the future, I will leave an area un-drizzled to make it less messy to eat. I baked it at 250 for twice as long on the second bake, as I didn't want it to burn. (This may be why mine didn't get crispy.) The yolk wash leaves a very shiny, attractive top, and I will do that again in the future. Thanks for a good recipe! I will try to cook it longer next time to achieve a crunchier texture. ***UPDATE*** I've made this again, this time using oil instead of butter. MUCH better texture. Lighter, crunchier and more like traditional biscotti. I didn't have to bake it as long, either. I will only use oil in the future.

These were great! I used almonds instead of walnuts, sweetened cocoa instead of unsweetened, and regular size Chocolate chips instead of the mini ones. I baked them for 10 minutes to toast them at 350. They were just what i was looking for. Can't wait to share them!

These were great. The first time I made biscotti. Be careful on the second baking though, 10 minutes each side or they may burn.

Great recipe! Follow the advice of those who said to bake for 20 minutes instead of 25.
I didn't add the chocolate to the flour. Instead I added it in the butter and sugar when for me seems like it would distribute the chocolate throughout the batter better. I then put in the eggs and vanilla, followed by the flour and baking powder, and finally the walnuts and chips.
 When it came time to create the logs, instead of sticky hands, I simply split it in half and put on some saran wrap. Easy to mold then turn onto the baking pan. It's a wonderful recipe. thanks!

I used the instruction of another biscotti recipe that says to turn your oven off after the first bake, slice the biscotti, lay them out on the cookie sheet, and put them back in the warm oven.  They come out perfect every time without the possibility of burning them.   (I usually put them in and forget about them.)  I regret that I followed the advice of adding more cocoa, it ended up tasting a little chalky, but I know I'll make these again, they were good.  I drizzled melted white chips over them and they were beautiful!

This recipe turned out great!  I have never made biscotti before and found it easy to put together.  For the 2nd baking, I did turn the heat down to 250 like another reviewer suggested.  It was great!  The one problem I ran into was when I was melting the white chocolate, it melted, but then it got hard again even when it was still in the double boiler.  So I ended up smearing the chocolate on with a butter knife - still tastes yummy!

Ok, so these are a little time consuming but very good. I was afraid I was going to mess this recipe up but I didnt. I made 2 batches-the first I made one large loaf and got biscottis that were similar in size to those you see in coffee houses. the second batch I made 2 loaves and got smaller ones. They both turned out great. I added a little more coco powder and left out the walnuts.

LOVE it! Baked them the first time as written (but ommitted nuts, I'm allergic), and they were yum, but did burn a bit on the second bake.  The next time I made them, I added 8 oz dried cherries, chopped up, and lowered the oven temp to 300.  PERFECT.  People go crazy for them!!!

A bit disappointing.  We love biscotti of most varieties but this didn't deliver due to its light chocolate favor and super dry texture.  Would have to adapt too many aspects so will probably look for a new chocolate biscotti recipe to try.

These were good and easy to make.  They do have a brownie taste to them and are very chocolaty (which I love).  I was testing the recipe before Christmas and will make another batch (first time making biscotti).

This is perfectly crunchy and is not brittle (people with braces could eat this easily). Also, the cocoa and chocolate and walnut flavors complement each other very well. I would increase the walnuts to 1/2 cup for more taste. Maybe add more cocoa powder for a more powerful cocoa flavor as well. The egg yolk shouldn't be skipped either - it makes an excellent shiny covering on top of the biscotti. This recipe was completely worth making, although I got my hands all sticky and gross from the dough. To make easier to handle, wet your hands while shaping the dough into logs. Happy Baking!

These turned out beautifully! I read the comments about the oven temperature issues and the biscotti being too soft. So, I followed the suggestion of turning the temp down to 350 on the first bake and 300 on the second. After flipping the cut biscotti on the second bake  (after 8 minutes) I baked the other side for 10. It seemed like the biscotti was too soft, so I turned the oven off and left them in for another 5 minutes. They came out the perfect consistency. Took them to work and they were gone in a couple of hours. Good stuff!

I've made my share of biscotti and this was the only one we didn't like.  It really did taste like a brownie.

I cut the recipe in half and added two additional tablespoons of cocoa powder. I only had slivered almonds on hand, so I used those. This was a delicious and not overly caloric way to satisfy our chocolate cravings. Great with a little ice cream. Thanks!

This recipe is not only delicious, but so beautiful.  I followed the recipe exactly, but drizzled the biscotti with melted white chocolate when cooled.  I gave a few away to friends, who all loved it.  The rest went to the teachers' lounge at school, where it was gone before lunch.

This biscotti came out way too dry. I mean even for biscotti. It was like sand. Even dipped in warm milk or Chai tea, it was not good. I won't be making it again.

The cookie started out promising, but ended as a huge dud. I followed the advice of others and cut the cookies after 15 minutes and turned the oven down to 250° for the second baking. 
The cookies were still incredibly crumbly when cutting them and even after they were done they still crumbled and fell apart. 
My husband told me they tasted like "old stale brownies". He said the cookie was too soft to be biscotti. I make lots of biscotti and was looking for something new, but this one will not make the cut again.

My family loved these biscotti! I cut the baking powder to 1 tsp. and only waited 15 mins before cutting into slices. The crumbling was an issue but I made a double batch and was able slavage most. Be very careful when turning during second baking as they really crumble easily. Thanks for the great recipe!

EXCELLENT!!!  I used slivered almonds instead of walnuts.  I also unfortunately used regular sized chocolate chips.  It would be better if I had read the miniature part of the ingrediant.

these are still to hot to eat yet, but smell amazing. I would set the oven at 350 next time and cut after cooling for no longer than 10 minutes, that way they don't get all crumbly. I did use the yolk of the egg as it called for but I usually use the whites in past recipes. Seemed to work out fine either way.

I loved these but did have to vary the times in the oven a bit. I made two batches and my first burned a tad when left in for the amount of time suggested. I made them for my mother who said that she loved them although thought them to be not as sweet as anticipated.

I'm a doctor and am always looking for healthy desserts. I really like this recipe, it's definitely healthier than the brownies I grew up on and still love. I cut down on the sugar, used canola oil instead of butter, and used egg beaters and it worked out great. I will continue experimenting with decreasing the oil and sugar. I'll keep you posted on how my future changes work out!

Excellent recipe.  I omit the nuts and they turn out wonderfully.  In all of the ovens I've used, the proscribed cooking time is far to long--check on them often as they cook.  Burnt bottoms can be hard to see on chocolate cookies.

Really yummy if you're a chocohalic!! Not my favorite biscotti - but it is what it says "brownie" biscotti - don't know why I expected anything different?  If you love brownies - you will love this.

I consider myself to be an expert baker. I followed the recipe's directions exactly. After the first bake, the bread completely crumbled as I tried to cut it. I tried various knives to make sure it wasn't the knife, too. A COMPLETE disaster. Time to figure out a plan B for teacher's gifts! :(

These taste out of this world.  I followed the ingredients exactly.  This only made one loaf tho.  I cooked it on a silpat and had no sticking problems.  I cooked it for 20 minutes but I think it should have been longer.  When I tried to cut it after cooling for 10 minutes it was still too moist and some fell apart.  Maybe I should have cooled it longer too.  I then put it back in the oven and cooked it another 60 minutes at 250.  So good, I just need to master the technique!

I adored these.  Followed the recipe exactly as far as ingredients go.  I baked them for 20 minutes at 375 degrees, removed them from the oven for 15 minutes, sliced them, then baked them for 10 minutes on each side at 300 degrees.  I had absolutely no problem with them crumbling.

Sorry, but this recipe as written was a dud for me.  My baker’s instinct told me that 375 was too high, but I followed the recipe anyway.  My biscotti were a little burnt in less than 10 minutes of the second bake.  I have a brand new oven and have tested it with an oven thermometer, so I know it wasn't that.  I made a second batch and cooked those at 300 for 20 minutes on each side for the second bake and they came out much better.  Sure, you have to cook it longer at a lower temperature, but at least it's not burnt.  I found the flavor of these to be wonderful, but they were much more prone to falling apart than other recipes I've tried.  I love the idea of this recipe and the dough tasted wonderful, but I will have to do some tweaking to get it to work.  I doubt I’ll try it again.  I'm glad it worked for other people though.

Wow I am very impressed!  These turned out perfectly and I even forgot to use the water/egg wash!  They were actually quite like the chocolate nut biscotti at Starbucks, surprisingly.  The baking times were perfect for me, other reviewers may realize that it's their ovens that are the problem & adjust accordingly.

Very yummy!!  I left off the egg wash and baked for 15 minutes first then 6 and 6 minutes.  I stirred in honey roasted peanuts and white chocolate chips, then dipped the bottoms in semi-sweet chocolate.  These are soooooo good!!

I added 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract, did half with well-chopped walnuts and half without.  I only let it cool about ten minutes before slicing and had no problems.  The second baking times should be reduced to about five minutes on each side.  Great tasting biscotti.

Wonderful flavor, omitted nuts. So chocolaty can omit chips also. They burnt on second baking, but burns ones still tasted good--kept for my stash.Will reduce heat to 250 like other person mentioned. The ones that didn't burn are great!!!

Super biscotti and very easy.  I sprinkled a little sugar on them before the second baking.

We loved it! After theinitial baking, we only let the cookies cool for a few minutes instead of the recommended 30 minutes. this prevented some of the crumbling. this was very kid friendly and the biscotti was wonderful according to the 13 year old chef!

Really good biscotti recipe.  I did not have any trouble with crumbling. Used a chef's knife and only waited 10 minutes before slicing. Then baked for 8 minutes per side in a 300F oven.  Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe. I think next time I will add a bit more cocoa like others did, but overall it came out perfect, not crumbly. I did add about a half cup more flour before making the loaves because the dough was so sticky, but the end product was great! tasty...and I'm glad to have a foolproof recipe now!

This recipe did crumble a little for me even though I followed the directions perfectly. Nevertheless, it still gets 5 stars for being so dang delicious! Best biscotti I've ever made, or tasted for that matter!

These were so good!  Everyone loved them.  The cook times were a tiny bit off for me, but it worked out ok.  I actually didn't care for these warm right out of the oven (not that biscotti is supposed to be eaten warm, but my I like regular recipe biscotti while still hot).  Once they were cooled, they were bomb!  Yum!  Makes a small batch, not NEAR enough for my chocoholic hubby.  Next time I'll double or triple it for sure!

Very good, very easy, too. It didn't crumble when I cut it (be sure you cut it slowly) and worked beautifully. I used 1C all purpose flour and 3/4C whole wheat. 

My only complaint is that the recipe has you make two 9" long logs then cut them into 1" slices. This gives you 18 biscotti, not 30 like the recipe says it makes, making the nutritional information and yield misleading.

These are definitely easy to make.  Substituted almonds for the walnuts and dried cranberries for the chocolate chips.  Be careful not to bake to long the second time because they will burn, 10 minutes per side is sufficient.  Cutting with a good serated bread knife keeps them from crumbling and I only let them sit 15 minutes before cutting.

Unbelievable. I have tried to make biscotti before but they always ended up either too hard or falling apart.  This recipe was perfect. Super easy too. The only thing I changed was that I left out the nuts.

These are amazing!! The only thing I changed was the suggestion by other reviewers to reduce the second bake time--I did 10 minutes on each side.
These are soooo addictive I may have to make another batch!!

These were ok. I didn't like the way they crumbled on me.  I think it needed more flavoring, maybe some almond or anise flavor, and perhaps some slivered almonds...not sure, just wasn't that good to me.

Made as written and mine were very crumbly.  Also I only baked for 8 minutes per side at at 250 degrees as recommended... I wouldn't do this again, the inside of the cookies were a little gooey not crisp like biscotti... the flavor of the cookies is brownie tasting like... going to try these again and follow exact directions...

Used regular sized chocolate chips and slivered almonds since that's what I had on hand.  Forgot to brush with water and yoke and can't imagine why it's necessary.  Still a wild success.

First time making biscotti,very good! Next time I'm going to use just a bit less cocoa. Not a big chocolate eater. I did have trouble with it crumbling when cutting, but not real bad. Will certainly make again.

Tasty and easy recipe.  I didn't have walnuts but used chopped slivered almonds instead. Next time, I will finish baking them for less time than recipe called for.  I baked them on each side for 10 minutes and they were overdone on edges.  I think 8 minutes per side would do.

Awesome biscotti.  I also lowered the temperature to 250 on the second baking so they wouldn't get too dry....I substituted maraschino cherries (chopped) and the juice to add flavor instead of the walnuts...drizzled with chocolate and they turned out great.

pretty good, though I changed only 2 things, I don't like walnuts, so opted for chopped almonds and then used almond extract instead of vanilla.  Though these are the first biscotti I've ever made, so they seem good to me!

Okay, so at first I wasn't sure about these, the dough was really sticky and a little hard to work with but once I baked it, it became very nice and not very crumbly at all. I glazed it with a raspberry glaze, they are so pretty!

YES!!!! This is absolutely awesome! I did use regular sized chocolate chips (because it's what I had on hand) and added 1/2 tsp of salt to give some intensity to the flavors, but otherwise this recipe was amazing. So easy! I did follow some of the suggestions from other reviews. I cut them with a butcher knife instead of a a serrated knife. Much less mess and much cleaner cut. Also, I reduced the temperature down to 250 degrees and baked them 12-15 minutes on each side. Perfect hardness and texture. I will DEFINITELY use this one again!

375 is to high temp for these. 350 would be much more accurate and reduce to 300 after slicing them. I burnt my first batch at 375. I used toasted hazelnuts , which tasted excellent, and no egg wash. Great flavor, if not burnt :)

I didn't expect something so simple to make would taste so good. I made this for my Christmas cookie platter at work and everyone absolutely loved it...and they keep asking for more. I've made them twice and everyone is impressed!! In where I'm at(Indonesia) people taste really varies, and they don't usually fancy the Western baked goods that I make; but everyone is hooked on this!! I've made them twice; I used almonds the first time and peanuts the other time, I have to say that almonds really brings out the flavour of the biscotti. I also baked them about 15-20 minutes on each side during the second baking to make them really crisp. They smell wonderful and keep well too, but I guess they don't stay in the cookie jar for that long...THANK YOU!!!

Excellent! A bit crumbly when I cut them into slices but I think I just need to reduce the first cooking time to 15 - 20 minutes instead of the 25 minutes I did this time.

If you want to wow somebody make this recipe.  What a perfect combination, chocolate and biscotti.  If you have never tried making biscotti before, it is so easy.  Some recipes are too dense and heavy.. this is just right.

I made 4 biscotti recipes I found here today. My 5 tasters said this was the best. I didn't change a thing and don't need to. The glaze is a nice touch. Thanks for passing it along.

Great chocolate flavor.  I omitted the choc chips and used hazelnuts in place of walnuts.

To avoid breaking: I cut them with a large butcher's knife after cooling for only 8 minutes.  Then I baked them again  for 8 mins per side, in a 250 degree oven.  Perfect!

We made these using a brownie mix, then followed directions to bake.  Only gave 4 stars because we didn't make the brownies using the recipe.
Turned out great - making again to put into a nice container for a gift.

This  was an  excellent recipe!! I'm an experienced baker and I make a lot of biscotti. I made  this recipe as is, except I used only  1 tsp of baking powder. I  used dark hersheys  unsweetened cocoa and  You must  make sure to  chopped nuts finely and used mini choc chips. I  had no trouble  with crumbling- it cut perfectly. I dipped  these in white and dark choc...(I did not use   the egg wash)  I baked  them 25 min and let cool for 12 min and then I cut with long serated knife. I  had no problems with crumbling!!  I then  baked  these at 350 for 10 min each side and they  turned out great - I will be making this  recipe again.  I  also got only 19 pieces  and they are nice size without over size or too small. They taste great with a nice chocolate crispy texture for dipping   in tea or coffee. Thanks for posting your  recipe!

We simply loved them! Perfect with either coffee or tea. Made some modifications, I used pecans instead of walnuts, whole wheat flour and a little bit less sugar. I pre-heated the oven to 350 degrees C and baked them for 30 minutes and 7 minutes on each side after slicing into an 3/4 of an inch.

Thanks for the recipe!

Magnificient taste and texture!  Added salt, espresso; baked for 20 minutes; cooled 15mins and baked again for 5 mins on each side, which created a chewier, softer texture which I prefer.

I made this for a cookie exchange and it turned out really good.  However, the recipe as printed bakes too hot.  I reduced the temperature for the second batch (325 for first bake and 275 for second bake) and it came out much better.

Very yummy with a few slight changes.  I baked at a lower temp, and made three smaller loaves.  I toasted my walnuts and increased the amount, also increased the chocolate (I just coarsely chopped regular chocolate chips).  Instead of an egg wash, I just dusted the tops with powdered sugar.
Looks so nice on a cookie tray with the cranberry-pistachio biscotti from this site.

I made 3 chocolate biscotti recipes this week and this was not the best of the bunch. My family and husbands office liked the Double Chocolate Biscotti by Janet Allen better. I would suggest using chunk or reg. size chocolate chips for more of a chocolate punch. I will keep looking for a better recipe.

These biscotti are great!  I keep them on  hand all the time now.  I use melted semi-sweet squares on the flat side instead of mini chips, and I don't use the egg wash.  I don't always have nuts, but they taste just as good without.    I reduce the first bake time to 15 minutes and the second and third to 6 minutes each.  They always come out perfect for me and don't crumble using a sharp chef's knife.

These biscotti have just the right amount of sweetness and chocolate flavor and are just the thing with a cup of hot coffee!  

Thanks, Linda for this recipe.

This tastes excellent and I enjoyed making it for myself and for gifts.  I put my oven at 325 instead of 375 as I think biscotti should bake slowly.  Also used 1/2 cup nuts.  I would also recommend using a sharp non-serrated knife for cutting.  Very good!

Perfect, delicious.  The only changes I made were to reduce the fat a bit.  I used one whole egg and a 1/4c of egg substitute.  I also used "I can't believe it not butter light".  It came out great.  Thank you so much for a great recipe.  Who says you can't have a delicious sweet treat and still eat healthy?  Surely not I.  :)

Very good biscotti. I eliminated the walnuts and added more mini chocolate chips. Easy to make and very tasty. Next time I think I will add chopped almonds to the mix. Still, my all time favorite biscotti recipe on this site is the Spring Biscotti....to die for!

Very chocolatey! This turned out very well. However dont forget to turn them over half way as mine got a little burnt on the bottom side. I was just looking to see if they were done from the top and kept them in a little longer! However i sprinkled icing sugar on top of them and they tasted very good.

What a wonderful recipe!!!  I added chocolate liqueur instead of vanilla.  To add sweetness I dipped in melted chocolate.  Gave to teachers as gifts and got rave reviews.  Will add chopped and toasted nuts next time.

Tastes great (even before you put it in the oven!)...but too crumbly. I ended up with too few whole slices. There was enough chocolate powder that the mini chocolate chips didn't add anything; had I known, I'd have eliminated them to save some fat/calories. I won't try this recipe again; I've made other similar biscotti that stayed intact and tasted great. I did substitute 1/2 of the sugar with Splenda, and substituted all walnuts with 1/3 c. cranberries. With these substitutions I figured 60.75 Weight Watcher points for the entire recipe, if you care. Weigh the finshed product to get points per ounce, or whatever.

This is a great recipe but I would like to know how to give it more chocolately flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly but I would like more of a chocolate flavor.  Maybe if I dipped them in melted bittersweet chocolate next time. I guess the name made me think it would taste more like a brownie, but this tasted like a cookie with some chocolate flavor.

These are really delicious. Albeit a little crumbly and tend to break at the ends a little easily, but still great! They really do taste like brownies, but still taste like biscotti, if that makes sense! I was out of butter, so I used the same amount of canola oil instead. I liked these best the day they're made. Thanks for the recipe!

SO disappointed with these.  They they tasted like a stale brownie.   Well, the texture was not like biscotti nor was the flavor that good.  Wish I had made something else since I used up all my chocolate chips on this recipe. :-(

These were my first attempt at biscotti, which i normally don't care for, and i will definitely be making these again!  I think they have just the right amount of everything.  I used regular sized semi-sweet chips and they worked just fine.  I formed the loaves on aluminum foil and when they were done, i let them set for 15 min before slicing.  A spatula does prevent breaking.  I also lowered the temp to about 285 for the second baking.  Iced with a powdered sugar glaze and melted chocolate---delicious!

I wanted a cookie I could send my husband who is currently stationed over seas. Him & his army buddies raved over them! I only made a batch of 60...but I guess I'm going to be making alot more of these for his tour. I did as suggested & baked it at 250 for 10-15 minutes. I also made a batch for me & ended drizzling white chocolate over them mmm

Good recipe. I used olive oil in stead of butter and pecans. Next time I'll add some white chocolate chips or butterscotch chips... it should be yummy !!

Oh goodness, these were totally amazing (I hate to say, especially dunked in a cup of hot tea!!!).  I followed the recipe exactly but did baked on waxed paper for the first stage of cooking.  Cut after 10 minutes of cooling and had no trouble with breakage.   I did think the dough was not the easiest to handle.  Once cooled I drizzled with melted chocolate and wrapped individually.  Perfect finish to my dinner party.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, I know I will be using it again and again...

Followed the directions as is.  I did not have mini chocolate chips. I used mini health bar bites.  I did not add the nuts. Biscotti came out crisp and wonderful. Not too hard, not too soft, just the right amount of crunch. As biscotti cooled I made a large pot of coffee.  Delish!  I will keep this recipe and make it again and again. My four year old son requested the biscotti w/ hot chocolate! :)

Very delicious!! It was a little crumbly when cutting the logs into slices, but I probably should have let it cool more first. I didn't mind though, since then I had a good excuse to eat the parts that broke off!

Awesome!  The batter was very sticky, I was worried I wouldn't get it shaped right.  I wet my hands a little and that helped.  It did crumble some, but not very bad.  You just have to be very careful while slicing.  They tasted sooo yummy, I'll make these again!

Nice, chocolatety flavor.  I've been baking biscotti for several years and found one simple method to ease the cutting process: after cooling 15 - 20 minutes, lightly but evenly spritz the top and sides of the uncut log with cool water (use a spray bottle).  Let the log sit another 5 minutes before cutting.  And definitely lower the oven temp 25 degrees or so for the second baking.

I have been wanting to make biscotti for forever and this is the perfect recipe!  Per other reviewers' suggestions, I used parchment paper and turned the oven down to 250 for the second baking time.  I will def be making these again for the holiday season!

I make this recipe for everyone I know and they love it!  The only thing I change is the flours so it is Gluten-free.  I put in equal parts rice flour, tapioca starch, and corn starch. They are a little bit crumbly, but they taste just as good. Thanks for the recipe I love this one.

OMG! Super flavor! In my house, we fight over the dry and crusty edges of brownies, and that is exactly what these were like. I baked these as instructed, and found that my loaves were firm at 20 minutes. I cut them into pieces while still warm, after only 10-15 minutes of resting. I was afraid that if I waited longer, that they would be too firm and I would encounter crumbling. They sliced beautifully. I baked them as instructed for the second time, about 8-10 minutes per side, but I found that they actually browned that way (the exposed nuts colored). I don't really have an issue with this, but I would maybe do the second baking at a lower temperature next time.  I am debating about adding a snitch of instant espresso powder and salt, as they have a tendency to add complexity to chocolate flavor while remaining undetectable to the palate. I just don't know if I want to mess with a good thing...

I made this recipe today along with 2 other biscotti recipes (Cinnamon Sugar Biscottis & Double Chocolate Biscottis) & I gotta say these must be my favorite out of all 3! 

After the first bake, they were warm, soft & tasted like an awesome brownie (I wonder if you could just then take them out and leave like that as brownies because if you could then this would be the best brownie recipe ever!). But after the second bake they got crispier & harder & got a slight bitter chocolate taste which was just fine!

The only changes that I made were that I didn't add the vanilla extract because I couldn't find any in my house. I also didn't add the semisweet chocolate chips but instead I added 1/4 of a bar of Lindt's Dark Chocolate & Orange chocolate along with 1/8 of a bar of Lindt's 85% Dark Chocolate. I also added 2 tsp of powdered sugar so that they wouldn't be too bitter because of all the dark chocolate. I also added 2 tbs. of unsweetened coconut flakes & 5-8 chopped hazelnuts. I didn't do the egg wash.

I found the raw dough to be a bit TOO dry but that might because when I was making the Double Chocolate Biscottis, 1 egg had 2 yolks in it so I tried to divide it but I guess the other one had more of the egg white so there was less liquid so I just added 1-2 tbs. of milk & that helped a bit. Also I guess I didn't bake them long enough because when they were done & cooled they were still slighty soft but barely but that's fine. They really do taste like brownies & are the best c

I added this recipe to my collection of other cookie recipes I make every for Christmas.  I followed the directions exactly and found that they do need some corrections.  For the 2nd bake, I ABSOLUTELY recommend turning the oven down to 325 degrees and baking no more than 10 min on each side, or else you'll end up with almost burnt biscotti.  Next year I will make those changes and I think these should turn out better.

Made this twice, it all got eaten.  Never realized biscotti was so quick and easy to make.  I used regular sized chocolate chips.  I divided the dough in 1/2 and made the other 1/2 with white chocolate chips and hazelnuts.  
Very good!

This turned out just okay.  I may try it again reducing both time and temperature.  Since the biscotti is already dark brown before baking, its difficult to gauge if its burning until its too late!  And I would leave OUT the egg wash - not neccessary.

Good!  I made some changes, but the recipe is a good basic starting point. I think it is possible to play with this recipe to your liking.  Watch the time and temp. I did slice once warm enough to handle---no crumbles.  Will make again.

If you bake at 375 degrees you will burn your biscotti !! Next time,( because I will try again and I think they will be great ) I will bake at 325 degrees. I did take off about 5 minutes of the shortest baking time,each time and I will do that next time too.They need the time in the oven to dry out, just at a lower temp.

So easy to make, and even more delicious to eat.  My daughter-in-law and I have added this wonderful recipe to our Christmas baking tradition.  Once the biscotti were dry & cooled, we dipped their tops in white almond bark, drizzled melted chocolate chips over the white, and sprinkled finely crushed walnuts over the melted dark chocolate.  
Paired with the fabulous recipe for "Hot Cocoa Mix in a Jar" by Traci (TJ), this duo will satisfy any chocoholic on your Christmas list!

Loved how these tasted, but they were a bit too crumbly. I followed other reviews and did not let the cool for the entire 30 minutes before slicing, and I only cooked them about 7 minutes on both sides after they were sliced. I left out the mini chocolate chips, but drizzled them with melted milk chocolate chips, so they are very chocolatey. I'll definitely make these again.

I tried this out last week for a party and I'm making it again this week for another party. It was a great success. However, I agree with some of the suggestions to bake for 5 minutes the second time instead of the longer amount of time given in the recipe.

I was a bit disappointed, guess I expected a stronger brownie taste.  I ended up frosting them  first with melted white chocolate and then melted dark chocolate on top of that. This took a while to dry but made them look fab.  Will try again with a bit more cocoa and with macadamia nuts.

We've tried alot of biscotti recipes and this is OK. Slices should be baked at 5 min on each side not 10 - 15 min. We sprinkled ours with powder sugar after final baking which helped.

Very good!  Make sure it is completely done before cooling the first time or it doesn't have quite the same crunch.  Also good with butterscotch or white chocolate chips!

These were nice, I substituted pecans. Next time I will add Grand Marnier. They did crumble, but I don't have a good bread knife. Check the cook's encyclopedia here at all recipes.com for good tips to avoid crumbling.

Very easy biscotti recipe.  I left out the nuts and cooked about 2 minutes less on each side after slicing. I didn't have any problems with the slices breaking.  Very nice flavor.  I'll make these again!

I loved this recipe so much.  I made it for a dinner party and served it with coffee and everyone was asking for the recipe.  Cutting the biscotti while it is still warm may prevent it from crumbling.

I have never made biscotti before, but figured I would give it a try.  The only problem I had was the dough sticking to everything.  When I sent them to work with my husband, everyone said it was the best biscotti they had ever had - they actually said they never found a chocolate biscotti that they liked, until now!

This was the first bicotti recipe i had ever made, and let me tell you it wasn't only delicous but it was so simple. All you do is mix, make a log, bake , cut, bake. It also filed my house with a choclatey aroma that was so yummy smelling. This cookie recipe is so good with vanilla ice cream, coffee and most of all hot chocolate! After you make this recipe, you'll wanna make every kind of biscotti. I did! Happy Baking! Becky NJ

very chocolatey-crisp texture
I added another 1/2 cup of whole almonds to the dough, so when sliced you get the nice large pieces of nuts found in the expensive store bought varieties.

As biscotti recipes go, this recipe is one of the best I've ever tried. Fast, easy, with ingredients you'll have on hand. I substituted the mini chocolate chips with 3 squares of semisweet chocolate, chopped. I wouldn't recommend this recipe for kids--it's crumbly, and would become a mess in small hands.

First time making biscotti and these were very easy and fun!  Delicious. I made them a little bigger so when it came to the baking after the cut, I baked at 250 on each side until it became dry enough it felt like biscotti. 20-30 min at least, rotated every 10 minutes.

Love these!  I subbed veg oil for butter as one reviewer said it helped the crumbling issue.  Omitted chips since some said they are harder to cut without breaking.  Baked 25 minutes, let cool for 10 then cut with a sharp butcher knife and then baked both sides at 250 degrees for 13 minutes.  They are not real hard, but melt in your mouth when dipping in coffee.  Also drizzled with confectioner's sugar icing with peppermint flavor.  Oh ma ma!

These turned out fantastic with great flavor!  I added a half of a cup of cocoa instead of a third, a little salt, and did not use walnuts.  I cut them while still warm (about ten minutes after the first bake), then baked them at 300 degrees to keep them from burning and drizzled with white chocolate.  Thanks for a great recipe! :)

This was very delicious! Biscotti is not meant to be overly sweet and this was chocolatey and yet not saccharine. My family isn't very keen on the super sweet things, so this was perfect for our taste :) The only thing I would like to comment on is.. I dried them out in the oven at 300 degrees. 375 will only burn them.

I thought these were very tasty.  Exactly what I was looking for in a biscotti.  I am allergic to most kinds of nuts, so I used toffee bits instead of walnuts.  I also lowered the baking temperature to 235 for the second bake time, since so many people said theirs burned.  I baked mine for about 12 minutes per side.  They could be a touch crispier for me (I like my biscotti very hard and crunchy) so I may up the baking temperature to 250 next time, but otherwise I wouldn't change anything.

Good, but not the best biscotti I've had, although I did not drizzle the chocolate on the outside. Not sure if I'll make them again. If so, they need to be jazzed up a bit.

LOVE IT!  My first time ever making biscotti and I am hooked!  Considered as a "treat" for me when at a coffee shop, but now can be a treat that I share with others!  Can't wait to carry some into work.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed suggestions, and I baked on a greased cookie sheet for 20 minutes at 375.  I reduced the temp. to 300 and baked on each side for 6-7 minutes.  I sliced carefully with only a little bit of crumbling.  These are not hard or really crunchy...just yummy good!  Bake longer the second time if you want them crunchier.  You will love these if you're a chocolate lover.  Not too sweet...perfect!  I used the egg wash, which made them nice and shiny.  I drizzled melted Ghirardelli white chocolate on the tops to make more festive.  I'm giving these as a gift...I know they'll love them!

The named is completely accurate for this biscotti -- it really does taste like a brownie!  I followed user suggestions regarding the temp for baking it the second time (I baked at 250 for 10-12 minutes).  When cutting the biscotti I had a few break but I think that had more to do with dense sections of chocolate chips making that area more weak than anything else.  I enjoyed this recipe and will be using it to make some tasty holiday gifts.

I made it without nuts and chocolate, and added dried sour cherries cut in small pieces instead, because I did not have the other ingrediants. My daughter loved it and I am waiting for my husband to try when he gets home, I am sure he'll love them too. Thank you fir this one!

I didn't really think these would work, because I live in a humid climate, but when they did I was happily surprised!  I followed the instructions accurately and left out the chocolate chips.  Soon, I'm gonna try mailing some half way across the world!  Biscotti is now my new favorite thing to bake!

I changed this recipe to make it a little more healthy.  I used equal parts egg substitute  and Country crock light spread instead of butter.  It turned out great!

Yum! These taste delicious. I didn't have any chocolate chips, but I did add in about 1/4 cup chopped almonds, which was a great addition. They almonds turned out perfectly toasted. I did have some problems with the loaf crumbling, but not so much; I cooked it 20 minutes and followed some other reviewers' suggestions, cutting it after only about 10-15 minutes of cooling so it was still a little soft and easy to cut. I think I undercooked them the second time around; they weren't as hard and crunchy as I'd have liked. But I will make these again!

OMG these are good! I've never made or eaten biscotti before and I have to say these are by far my favourite hard cookies. I will definately make these again and again and again. I may even try to dip half the biscotti in a little mint chocolate for the holidays and swirl a little green and red coloured white chocolate over them too to make them more festive. What a great recipe, thanks for sharing!Update:March 11, 2009. I made these for a bake sale for my husbands work and they were a hit! I swirled chocolate all over them and they were good. I did over bake them a little so they were extra hard but still good.

Excellent!  I added another tablespoon of flour when I was forming the loaves so it wouldn't stick to my fingers as much.  To those that thought it wsa too dry, Biscotti is supposed to be dry.  Thats the point in cutting and baking a second time.  If you thought it was too dry, Biscotti isn't for you.

These are delicious and very simple to make. I had to keep the over at a lower temperature in order to not burn them. I drizzled melted white chocolate chips and premium dark chocolate and this makes them look and taste delicious.  They would not be half as good if the drizzled chocolate was omitted. 

I make a batch and put in a glass cookie jar and give it as a gift for mother's day, birthdays, as a host gift or just to cheer someone up. Yum!

I really loved this! It was my first time making Biscotti, and i have four teenagers in my house and it was all gone within three hours! The only thing i'd do is make three smaller loaves and not two, i found that the middle of the bigger loaves never quite dried as nice as smaller, thinner pieces. I had followed the advice of another reviewer and lowered the temp for the second baking...don't think I'd do that again. in conclusion for me...smaller loaves and same temp for both bakings. LOVED this recipe!

Nice chocolate flavour and not too sweet or overpowering. Good with coffee or icecream. modified the recipe a bit, used oil insterad of butter, regular sized chocolate chips and slivered almonds instead of walnuts and omitted the egg wash. you definately need a sturdy wooden spoon to mix the batter as it is very stiff.baked at 350 degrees for first baking and 300 degrees for 2nd baking and only for about 8 minutes per side. The sliced cookies will scorch so check after 8- 10 min.

My 3 year old is insisting that we make cookies for Santa tomorrow night and I've been wanting to give these a try so I made a batch of these today.  The dough is VERY sticky, but I followed the advice of another reviewer and used wax paper to shape the logs and it worked beautifully.  I adjusted the 1st bake to 350 for 25 minutes, sliced about 3/4 inch thick (1 inch just seemed way too thick), and adjusted 2nd bake to 300 for about 12 minutes each side.  I dipped 1 side in melted semi-sweet chocolate.  They came out wonderfully crunchy with just the right amount of sweetness. My daughter loved them and so did I. They're great with milk or with coffee.  This will definitely because a regular recipe.

I really wanted to rate this higher, but it just didn't work out for me.  The cooking temp. was too high and the time too long.  Additionally, something was off with the texture.  It was beyond crumbly and seemed to turn to dust when you bit into it.  Topping it with melted chocolate made it more palatable, but not worth all of the time.

I had been looking for a chocolate biscotti recipe  and found this.  Delicate and light and tastes like a crisped brownie.  I dusted a batch with powder sugar and drizzled white chocolate on another.  I did what others suggested and lowered the temp. to 350 and baked just a bit longer so they would not burn.  Most important to let them cool as noted before slicing.  Thanks!

YUMMY!!!  I made these as Christmas gifts this past year.  Everyone RAVED about them :)  One of my clients called me at home the following week (I left a bag on his desk before my holiday break / vacation) to tell me how good they were!  These are crunchy, but not too crunchy.  They have a somewhat soft consistency that I really enjoy. These make great gifts (did I mention that???!!!??!) and are one of the better biscotti recipes I've found on this site.  You gotta try this one!

These were good, but lacked something... I can't put my finger on it, maybe they'd be better if they were drizzled with white or dark chocolate.  I will make again though!

tasted and looked just like biscotti.  would be very good with coffee since it's not too sweet.  if you're looking for something really chocolately, though, this is not it.  make regular brownies instead.

To cut calories, I left out the chocolate chips, nuts, and egg wash, and I replaced the half the eggs with Egg Beaters, and it was still pretty good.  My husband said they were great with coffee - not too sweet.  I gave four stars only because I prefer a crunchier biscotti.  Will definitely make again.

Wow-this was very good.  I didn't use the eggwash and followed another poster's reccomendation to bake for 15 min and then 6 and 6 min.  I also dipped the ends in melted semisweet chocolate and dusted with chopped walnuts.  No need to wait until completely cool before slicing, just wait a few minutes and use a sharp serrated knife.  Will definitely make again.

These are GR8!  My husband and girls really enjoyed them. These were gone the 3 times I made them and I don't even get them cooled!  I made some for our new neighbors and they loved them too!  I left out the nuts and added more chocolate chips instead.  WONDERFUL!!!  True brownie flavor!

Very good biscotti recipe!  Yummy chocolaty flavor.  I did as many others did and reduced the second baking temperature down to 300 and baked on each side for only 7 minutes or so.  I used parchment paper and the biscotti did not burn at all.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first biscotti attempt.  I must have picked the best recipe.  It was delicious.  I went on and made the Cinnamon Hazelnut and Lemon Biscotti.  Put two of each in a plastic Christmas bag.  Labeled it and put a ribbon tie around the top.  Put them in the freezer for Christmas gifts to share.  I think they will be a hit.  We could not stop munching on them.

I think this is a very good, chocolately biscotti. It doesn't taste just like cocoa, as some chocolate biscotti do.

Fantastic! The brownie taste in a biscotti form is truely unique. Brownie Biscotti is a nice change of pace from your standard cookie. These will go fast!

I like my biscotti a bit harder, but these tased great!  I reduced the baking time to 5 min on each side per the reviews and perhaps my cookies would have been harder if I had had baked it the full time.  I made them for my mom for mother's day and she loved them.  Thanks!

Very good: just the right amount of chocolate flavor for a biscotti.  I agree that the second baking should be lessened significantly.

This is extremely good...I did change the walnuts to almonds, and added a pinch of salt (salt kicks up the taste of chocolate) and it was wonderful!!  Be careful though, I burned my second batch by chattering on the phone a bit too long...once they're done, they're done!  :)

I think  I must have done something wrong with this recipe cuz it burned to easily. I cooked it at the recommended 375 .
It was easy to make and the pieces that werent burnt were good. I guess next time I will just watch my oven more closely. Sonya

This was easy to make but a little tedious [coz u have to slice them afterwards] and they cracked a little when sliced but most came out ok. I managed to get 24 good pieces out of this one. They tasted kinda bland though...

very nice!!! After slicing, i put them back in oven to tan both sides of the slices.  Then i melted chocolate chips with a little bit of shortening and dipped the upper edge of each slice and made the cookie decadent!!!

Wow!  FInally I found a biscotti recipe that tastes great and is easy too.  The aroma from baking these is fantastic.  Careful when handling the log, my first one broke.  I'm going to give these at Christmas time as gifts and look like a real pro!  Thanks, Linda!

Great when I need a chocolate fix. Be careful not to burn the slices when you put them back in the oven. It’s easy to do if you’re not watching.

I love this recipe and it came out wonderfully. I didn't use the walnuts. I melted white chocolate chips and drizzled them over the top (YUMMY). I  reduced the temp to 300 for the second baking and only did ten minutes and they cooked perfectly. I will bake these again... and again.

I have always wanted to make Biscotti, but never got around to it.  Boy were these worth the wait!  Fantastic, not too sweet with just the right amount of chocolate.  I have been looking up other recipes, but will probably stick with this one.

These are so good. I followed the recipe exactly. The are not very sweet and hold up well when dunked, like a good biscotti should. I hope the teacher's like them as much as I do. Be careful with the baking time. Since they are dark it's easy to over cook them during the second baking as mine didn't quite seem firm enough at first.

Very good, I have tried other chocolate biscotti that were not to my liking. These have a real brownie taste, with biscotti texture, YUM. It is easy to burn though, next time I may try to lower the temp a little.

Perfect chocolate biscotti!  Followed the directions exactly (except I left out the nuts), and they came out wonderfully.  Crunchy, flavorful, and just the right accompaniment to my morning coffee.  People have different ovens and pans, and I'm willing to bet those who had problems with burning weren't using parchment.  Greasing might be okay if you have the right pans for it (dark non-stick pans will burn just about anything), but parchment really is your friend here.  I started out with 10 mins on each side for the second bake, and they were still a little soft, so I gave them another 10 mins standing upright.  Perfect!  Also, definitely DON'T use a serrated knife.  You need a long, very sharp slicer, and use a gentle sawing motion.  If you're using force with the knife, it needs sharpening.  If you're trying to cut these with a dull knife, you might as well use a hammer instead, you'll get the same result.

This is the bomb!  I used a heaping 1/3 cup of cocoa powder, pecan cookie pieces, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  I baked for 20 minutes at 375 (no burning) and on the second baking at 350, turning after 10 minutes.  I let cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes and then sliced.  I had no problems with them crumbling.  As is, they are wonderful.  I'll try drizzling with white and semi-sweet chocolate next time, but they really don't need it!!  This is a definate keeper!  Almost forgot...I used 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/4 almond extract.

Very chocolatey.  Perfect if you like the harder outside edges of brownies.  We still prefer traditional biscotti.

Maybe I did something wrong..? These turned out very bland. The dough and cookies both started crumbling. I followed the recipe to a T. I'll try another recipe to see if it turns out better.

I did not care for these biscotti. I made the recipe as written. I think the unsweetened cocoa powder should be decreased. I will continue to search for a great chocolate biscotti recipe

My kids and I made these to go in our Christmas gift baskets...they turned out great! We dipped one end in white chocolate, and rolled in andes candy cane chips. Certainly well worth the work. Thanks for sharing!

These are delicious! I used 2/3 cups of regular chocolate chips, omitted the nuts, baked at 375F for 20 minutes, cooled on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then baked for 10 minutes on each side at 300F. Mine were not super crunchy, but that's how I wanted it. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great flavor.  Just not thrilled with the texture.  I know biscotti are supposed to be "crispy" but these turned out to be kind of powdery, a little too dry for my taste.  I turned down the oven like many suggested and cooked them the second time for 15 minutes.  I think next time I'll  do the second bake for only 10 minutes so they don't get too dry.  Other than that, nice recipe.

This was a great recipe. My first time making Biscotti! Perfect with my coffee. It was a little crumbly when I went to slice it. I'm pretty sure I might have left it in the oven too long. I'm sure to make this again. I'm thinking about doing it as Christmas gifts! Thanks for the recipe!

Hits the spot! Had a little trouble with the slices breaking as they were being cut at first, so I let the loaves cool a few more minutes and tried the suggestion of previous reviewers to use a sharp non-serrated chef's blade, and things went more smoothly after that. Followed the recipe pretty closely, only things I did different were add the cocoa powder and sugar a little on the generous side, then dipped the finished cookies in melted chocolate.

I actually made this biscotti for my mom for Mother's Day.  I made these twice.  Both times were perfect.  Didn't have a problem with over cooking or anything.  First time to make biscotti, so it was easy.  I used the regular size chocolate chips and that worked out just as well.  Thanks for a good recipe!

These have a great chocolate flavor. I used a sharp chopping knife to slice, and they didn't crumble.  I did have to keep a close eye on them during the second baking so they didn't get to dark. I will definitely make these again!

delicious! I love the original recipe and the biscotti come out fantastic. And it inspired me to do some changes of my own as well! Of course, not to improve (how to improve 5 star??), but to make a tasty variations.

Very good recipe, I followed everything except baking times. The dough was very sticky so wet ur hands before molding!! I baked them the first time at 350 degrees for about 22 minutes, let them cool about 12 minutes and sliced with a very sharp bread knife. I had no problems when cutting. For the 2nd bake I turned the oven down to about 300 and baked 15 minutes per side. They turned out great. I dipped & drizzled them with white chocolate colored pink and red for Valntines Day. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very good biscotti recipe. However, I would not go the maximum baking time on the second time around if you do not want to break your teeth off. I also suggest that white chocolate be used instead of semisweet to offset all that chocolate. It also looks prettier!

This was good, my first time making biscotti. I totally forgot about the water and egg yolk wash, and I'm not sure what difference it makes.  The biscotti was a tad bit crumbliy at first, but I let it cool completely for about an hour and it was great. thanks for the recipe

biscotti is hard, and this one walks you through the process quite well. i omitted the nuts and drizzled with melted white chocolate like in the picture. everyone enjoyed them. i didn't quite dry them out enough because they had a softer texture than what i expect from biscotti, and only a few of them crumbled.

if you let them cool a bit and use a sharp santoku knife, you get nice even cuts because of the straight edge of the knife. i think serrated knives increase the tendency to crumble

These were pretty good, but nothing to get excited about. I drizzled half of them with white chocolate icing. Also - the temp and times are way off in this recipe - try 325 for 35 minutes instead. Good luck!

I made these for a cookie party the other day and my family and friends drooled over them. I love biscotti, but even my mother who's not too big of a fan of them, couldn't keep her hands off of them. 
I speak for everybody who tried them as well as me, but this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I left out the chocolate chips, increased walnuts to 1/2 cup, added a bit more cocoa powder and flour as well. I also didn't do the egg wash. The baking time on these is off. I baked @ 350 for 30 minutes for the first bake and 15 minutes for the second bake. Turned out great - very chocolatey, even without the chips.

Nearly 45 minutes baking at 375 degrees? I ended up with chocolately charcoal, not biscotti. I was in a rush and didn't look at the reviews but I can't believe so many people rated it so high with such flawed instructions. First off, I know that it's my own fault for not using some common sense and realizing that the the baking time and temp are way off but unfortunately, whenever I bake I tend to mechanically follow the recipe and try and stick to it as much as possible, as opposed to when I cook. I made it because my bro wanted biscotti but I really wish I had used those choc. chips, cocoa poweder, and nuts to make a yummy soft cookie instead. What a waste of ingredients.

Fabulous! I made a batch to give away for Christmas and I have friends calling just to tell me how good this biscotti was.
I left out the walnuts and mini chocolate chips (I didn't have any), dipped the biscotti in chocolate and then rolled it in crushed red and green M&Ms. They looked festive and tasted fabulous. Thanks for  great recipe. I can't wait to try it when I have all the ingredients!

I added a total of 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup cocoa powder to make them a bit sweeter. I added enough Kahlua to the dough until it wasn't falling apart and crumbly before I baked them--they came out perfect! I dipped them in melted chocolate chips with Kahlua mixed in...To Die For!

This was ok.  My husband insisted that they were good, but I thought they tasted more like plain, overcooked brownies.  If you're looking specifically for a brownie-biscotti recipe, you can try it, but if you're looking for any biscotti recipe, this is not the one to do.

Delicious!! They are so fantastic!!

I was worried about burning so I lowed the temp and they were perfect.

I was also worried about crumbling, so I cut them with a sharp serrated edge knife after letting them cool for 7 minutes. I used a spatula to tranfer them back to the baking pan. They cut smoothly with no crumbling. 

I also lowed the temp as others had suggested for the second bake. Lowered to 200 and baked for 10 on one side and flipped for another 10 minutes.

Perfect.

Delicious! I drizzled melted white & semi-sweet chocolate over them once they had cooled, and I left out the walnuts due to allergies.

My first time ever making biscotti.  They turned out wonderfully - even though I was in so much of a hurry I totally forgot the egg wash.  I dont believe it made much of a difference and I'm not sure of the reason for the egg wash?  Anyway, will be dipping these in white chocolate and putting in our cookie jar to have with our tea/coffee!

This is the first time I've ever made biscotti, and they came out perfect!  I didn't add the nuts.  I also covered them in melted chocolate.  I got rave reviews, and was offered money to sell the next batch I make.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this yesterday and think they are perfect. I skipped the egg wash. I used my air-bake, however they did get a little too dark on the bottom. Should have checked over sooner but set the timer for 20 minutes. Next time I will bake at 350. For the subsequent bakes I reduced to 250 for about 15 minutes each. I turned the oven off and left them in another 10 minutes. Very crisp and yummy. I bought the Baker's melting discs for icing. I used about 1/3 of the package and micro'ed in a sauce dish. Each container has enough discs for 3 batches of biscotti. I used a small brush and coated the bottom's this time as they were a little dark.

I'm not sure why anyone would call this biscotti. They turned out to be burnt dried up, brownies.  I was so disapointed. They would've been good if I hadn't put them back in to the oven.  Just cut and leave out to air dry or something.  

Sorry but I won't be making these again.

I loved this recipe. I had tried another biscotti recipe and didn't care for it but I thought this one was great. Also, I used almonds instead of walnuts. I left them in the oven for quite a while on the second bake because I wanted a crunchy biscotti.

This recipe was so good. I added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips(both white chocolate and semi-sweet) instead of 1/2 cup. I used regular size chocolate chips instead of small ones but the recipe was still good.

These are my husband's favorites!  I had never made biscotti before and this recipe was definitely a hit!  Who knew I could even make biscotti??!  My Italian in-laws even raved about them when I made them over the holidays!  A definite keeper for us!

This is a VERY good Biscotti, almost as good as my recipe for M&M-Oatmeal Biscotti. Although I changed this recipe, by the ingredient listed, it turned out alot better than I thought it would! I used oil instead of butter,Wheat flour instead of white flour.2 eggs and no water.

Excellent!  Such wonderful chocolate taste.  I cut the sugar in half to 1/3 cup since I don't like cookies too sweet, and the people at work raved about them.  Thanks for sharing!

Good recipe.  I didn't do the egg wash--I don't like the way it makes baked goods smell.  Also, I reduced the second bake temperature to 250 degrees, and just baked them until they were dry.

These taste great.  But I gave it only 3 stars because when I followed the directions exactly and used egg yolk for the egg wash I ended up with a gross looking yellowish green color on top of my cookies.  Not for gift giving!  Next time I will use milk or egg white.

Delicious!  I made this for teacher's gifts last year and got raves.  My daughter loved it too, and the recipe is easy enough that she (age 11) was able to prepare the biscotti mostly on her own when we made it the second time.

i thought these tasted great. i didnt put any walnuts but i did add caramel pieces that i cut up. i think it would have been better if i didnt cut them so there would be nice big spots of caramel. i forgot to put the eggwash on, but they still turned out nice, they only cracked at certain spots. good recipe!

these are ok but i would suggest making the loaf about 1/2 inch thick for the first baking.  i think it needs to be a little sweeter.  i always have trouble making mine stay together when i cut them.

I made these great biscotti for all our neighbors for the holidays. They all loved it as well and every single one asked me for the recipe!

This was a wonderful, wonderful recipe.  Very easy to make and oh-so-yummy! I cut my biscotti a little narrower (around 1/2 - 3/4 inch) and reduced the oven time to 350 for the second baking. I gave them as Christmas gifts and they were well loved - thanks for sharing!!

A really EXCELLENT cookie, so easy to make yet they taste like something special.  I did, however, double the amount of cocoa called for, to make the cookies super chocolate-y.  I'm giving this cookies as Christmas gifts to everyone on my list!

This is pretty good biscotti.  I omitted the nuts because I have a lot of friends that are allergic.  It's a little more dense than other biscotti I've made, but it's still very chocolaty.  Because it's so dark, it can be easy to burn.  Watch closely!

This recipe was really good but I had a problem with the biscotti breaking into pieces when I cooked it.  It also seemed to burn a bit when I cooked it and I carefully watched the time.  I heard that you can bake biscotti on a wire rack and that helps to prevent burning.  I will try that next time.

Mmmmm good.  I made this recipe for the craft ladies at my church.  We're all of Italian descent and biscotti experts (if we do say so ourselves).  This is a fabulous recipe and very easy to make.  Very flavorful and crisp like biscotti should be.  Thanks for letting us in on it.  We make it often.

Easy and delicious!  Smells and tastes like a brownie.  It did crumble when sliced and the crumbs were eaten, but I wonder if there is a way to slice it without crumbling. My many other biscotti recepes don't crumble.

These were delicious and a big hit.  I made the recipe several times during the holidays.   Each time the logs crumbled, but I managed to get some really nice diagnoal slices to add to the cookie tins I was preparing to give as gifts.  The crumbs, I saved for myself, since I loved them so much.

I drizzled melted chocolate and white icing over them and dusted them with confectioner's sugar.

Very nice gift with a tin of flavored coffee in a basket with some latté mugs.

If anyone knows the trick to slicing these without them breaking, please pass it on, as this was the only flaw I saw in this recipe.

These were really good.  I adapted the recipe for my mom, who can't eat refined sugars, by substituting sucanat for the sugar (1-for-1) and sugar-free semi-sweet chocolate chips.

This recipe meets some of my top requirements:  tastes better than anything I can buy in the supermarket; FAST and EASY.  I made this for my company's Charity Bake Sale.  It got lots of compliments.  AND it takes NO time to put it all together!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Linda!

I made these for the bake sale at my work! 
I had all kinds of complement from my co-workers.  
Some insisted that I share a recipe with them so I gave them not only the recipe
but also the news about AllRecipe.com.
It's not really hard like some biscotti.  It's good with or without a cup of coffee!

Delicious!  I did add a little more cocoa and doubled the mini chocolate chips and sliced at 20 minutes cool time.  If I moved the serrated knife in a forward direction only that seemed to make less crumbles.  Also lowered the second baking temperature.  These are great!

I have made this many, many times, and love having these around the house to have with coffee. I know the name of the game at allrecipes is to give things 5 stars and then talk about how you didn't actually follow the recipe, but this recipe needs ZERO modification. It is wonderfully tasty with a perfect crunchy texture. For those saying the cookie is dry - either you overbaked it or you don't know what a biscotto's texture is supposed to be.

I also added more cocoa powder as suggested before (add'l 1/4 cup), and decreased the flour by 2 Tbsp. Grated fresh orange peel (I just love the combo orange/choc), added mini chic chips and no nuts. Didn't bother with brushing the cookie logs with egg/water  Sliced the bars about 10 min after taking out of oven. Baked 350 for 20 min initially, then 10-15 min more after slicing. Minimal crumbling prob. Drizzled white choc after cooled - delicious! Might try it with dried cherries next time ;-)

This recipe is perfect. Only thing I adjusted was the cooking time because of my oven. I did 20 mins then only 8 mins per side.  It's a big hit!!  Thanks for sharing!!!  Made it twice now!

I tried following other reviewer advice, such as add a little more cocoa, less baking time, less cooling time, and I still ended up with crumbling biscotti.  I thought using just the egg yolk was odd (usually use the white), and boy, did it turn out odd. The biscotti had an unnatural yellow shine on top, and some parts of the egg cooked. On the biscotti. Ew. Save yourself time and ingredients and skip this recipe.

Added a pinch of salt and more cocoa. Had to decrease heat to 350 for second baking to prevent burning.

Amazing biscotti! I used pistachios instead of walnuts and left out the chocolate chips. I also decreased the oven temp for the second baking to 250F as per another reviewer's suggestions, and it came out perfect. Very easy to make and great for beginners with bad luck in baking, like me.

I have baked many different types of biscotti and found this one to be particularly difficult to shape ... I don't think there was enough butter in the recipe so it was very crumbly ...

This was the second Biscotti I've made from this website and love this one as well. Although my Nonna asks for the other one (she isn't huge on chocolate) my mom always asks me to make these ones! She loves them so when I make them I make a BIG batch so that way my mom can freeze them (cause that's what us Italians do). These are so good and they're not complete without the drizzle of icing or chocolate. Yum!

I have made this recipe before and loved it. I used hassle nuts and lots of them. I also used good semisweet chocolate chunks. I lost my recipe and couldn't bake them this year. :0( It looks like the recipe is close to this one, so i,m looking forward to try it out. Thank you ;0) Jette Mortensen

Was a big hit at home.  I did make one slight change.  As it is a biscotti, I added the almond extract, in equal amount to the vanilla.  We like a traditional almond flavor to whatever other flavored biscotti.  So for us this was perfect this way.  Family  raved over this one.

OMG this recipe is a keeper. Used sliced almonds instead of walnuts and dipped them in semi sweet chocolate once they were finally cooled after the second bake. Still crumby to cut but not too bad.

I made these this afternoon.  They came out lovely.  Because they are suppose to be brownie biscotti, they're not suppose to come out as dry as regular biscotti, but the flavour is phenomenal.  You have to adopt the temperature of the oven to your own oven, though. Next time I make it, I will add crushed M&M's to the mixture and reduce the temperature to 350 F for the second bake.

I thought this recipe was great. Its a nice base to switch it up with your favorite ingredients also. I only cooled them for 15 min before cutting them. That helped to keep them from crumbling. They turned out wonderful. Thanks for sharing.

I thought this recipe was excellent. Plenty of chocolate flavor (I was nervous due to other reviews saying this was bland and lacking in chocolate flavor). The only thing I mixed in was dried cherries (I would have added almonds, but I didn't have any on hand). I have a convection oven, so I always reduce the temperature by at least 25 degrees and bake a few minutes shorter than recommended. OH, AND NOTE: based on other reviews of lacking flavor, I did add about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

I would opt out of the egg yolk/water combo on top. Perhaps a dusting of powdered sugar to give a pixie cookie like top. But the texture of this biscotti is spot on. The taste is perfect.

I've never made biscotti before, so I wasn't sure about this one.  But it was so easy and SO good!  Next time, I may try leaving out the cocoa powder and just making plain chocolate chip biscotti.

These are excellent...my son made these for his final in baking class. (He got an A). He brought me home some to try and I am adding them to my Christmas cookie list.  He did not add the egg wash or the walnuts (allergy) and they were excellent...I'm so proud!

These are really quite good. I have made better biscotti which is why I only gave it four stars. I doubled the recipe, which was not too awful to work with my mixer...I did the final step of mixing in the nuts and chocolate by hand in a large pot, then divided the dough. It is quite sticky so I floured my mat well and kneaded a few minutes to get the dough workable. Baked up nicely and the taste is decadent! Overall a good chocolate lovers biscotti

It did crumble a little because the egg wash made its way to the cookie sheet and the biscotti is harder to remove, but if you have parchment paper, it should fix it.

This recipe was just sweet enough. I omitted the cocoa powder because I didnt have any and drizzled  them with white and milk chocolate. The result was a perfect biscotti no one could resist dunking in coffee or hot chocolate.

First time making biscotti and the results were awesome.  My oven ran a little on the highside and burntt the edges but  that made little difference in the overall taste.  Thanks for the guidance of wetting hands to manipulate the batter.

I didn't realize biscotti was so easy to make!  I used more cocoa powder since I didn't have chocolate chips.  I also tried this with dried blueberries.  Not bad.  I did have some issues with crumbling pieces, but it was manageable.

These were good for a chocolate lover but I'm going to stick with my almond biscottis. For some reason these tasted better NOT dipped in my coffee. They were very pretty and looked tempting but they just weren't my thing. I'm not a huge chocolate lover so if you are, you may like them.

I took the walnuts out and instead dipped the bottoms in french vanilla dark chocolate and then into chopped pecans.  For non-nut lovers I drizzled the top with the chocolate.  I make these every Christmas for family and friends!

This biscotti was great. I skipped the egg wash & only added butterscotch chips (no nuts) They were very easy to deal with, no sticky hands :) They sliced wonderfully. I recommend you use the egg wash to make 'em look glossy, not dry.

This recipe came out tasting wonderful! I added 1/4 tsp of orange extract and left out the nuts since I was making it for a friend who doesn't eat them. I read the reviews before baking and lowered the baking temps and time. 350 for 20 minutes for the first bake, and 300 for 12 minutes for the second. I also had trouble with crumbling pieces when I started cutting with a serated knife, and it was my best bread knife too. But after three or four pieces, I switched to a sharp chopping knife and it worked like a charm! No more crumbling! I drizzled the finished pieces with a little bit of white chocolate and they came out beautiful! I will make this again!

Best chocolate biscotti.  Perfect for dipping in tea, coffee or hot chocolate.  I always get rave reviews and they don't last long!  If you are able to hide some away they stay fresh for awile.

This was the third biscotti recipe I'd ever baked. I'm not a big fan of having too many chocolate chips in cookies, so I swapped the amounts for the walnuts and choco chips. My better half does not like coconut, so I added about 2 tablespoons of unsweetened coconut flakes to one of the two rolls we baked. The first testing of the biscotti before re-baking I was not overly impressed. After the second baking I found that these are hard to resist and the coconut ones were excellent as well.

I am so pleased with this recipe!  This is my second time making biscotti, but this recipe is so much better than the last one I used. :-)  I did add 1/4 tsp of almond extract, in addition to the vanilla extract - and also, 1 teaspoon of espresso powder.  I read a lot of the reviews, and so I also baked my biscotti at 350 F, for 20 minutes, let the loaves cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, and then cut them with a serrated knife.  No crumbling or breaking at all.  I then popped back in a 300 F oven for 15 minutes, per side.  At the very end, I turned the oven off, opened the oven door slightly, and allowed them to sit there for another five minutes.  They got perfectly crunchy, crisp, and dry.  I added chopped white chocolate to mine.. yum!  Next time, I may dip in white chocolate and dredge in more chopped walnuts.  There are so many possibiliites, with a great base like this.  Thank you!

This was my first attempt at Biscotti and they were awesome!  I made a double batch, and omitted the choc chips because I did not have them on hand.  Used pecans instead of walnuts, and added Craisins-really good!  I planned to drizzle melted almond bark on the outsides, but my family ate ALL of them before I got to that step. Needless to say I will make them again!  I used a silcone pad as someone recommended, and so NO sticking at all.  I had no problem slicing with a serated knife.  I baked longer on the second bake just to dry them out really good, as it is raining today.  I will give these for Christmas next year!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This was my first attempt at Biscotti and I am happy to say it turned out great!  I baked the biscotti on a baking stone then let it cool before cutting for the second bake.  I drizzled dark chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate on them.  I dipped some of them in white chocolate at one end.  Great recipe!

Perfect! I don't really like biscottis, but this sounded good and I figured I would give them to my mom & sister for fun. I decorated them as a previous person did with drizzled white and milk chocolate and sprinkled more finely chopped walnuts on them. I even took a few to work and they were poking fun saying that I bought them at a store and put them in my own container. They are so pretty to look at and everyone loved the flavor. I also thought they were very simple to make. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I turned the oven down to 325 for the second baking because I was afraid 375 was too high. The biscotti dried out perfectly with no burning.

Amazing. I have tried for awhile to find the perfect biscotti recipe and this is it! Followed the recipe exactly and when they were done, I dipped one side in chocolate. Let them sit till it hardened and they are PERFECT. Even my 2 year old loved them.
I do have to say I adjusted the cooking temps as others have said and it worked out great.

I added 1 tbsp instant hazelnut coffee with the eggs and butter as it gives a nice coffee taste. Melted Butterscotch chips drizzled on the biscotti once baked gives a nice taste to it as well.

I am in love with this recipe.  It is not too bad for you, I usually substitute half the butter with applesauce.  It has a great chocolate taste, not to sweet, but sweet enough.  yum.

My batter seemed too sticky, even though I followed the instructions exactly. I added extra cocoa powder and sugar, but when I went to bake them, the logs spread a lot. I was still able to cut them into slices, but I took other suggestions and did it soon after taking them out of the oven. They didn't require much time when I baked them the second time. Despite the spreading, they still tasted great! I decorated them with a white chocolate drizzle, and sprinkled some with coconut and chopped walnuts as well.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful and had just the right amount of chocolate flavor!  I followed the recipe exactly and found no need to make any changes.  The biscotti were delicious on their own, but tasted even better when dunked it in coffee!  Everyone in my family loved it as well.  It is now officially my favorite cookie recipe!

Delish!  I had never made biscotti before and for some reason thought it was hard to do but it was easy and this recipe is amazing!  I drizzled the top with green and red coloured icing for Christmas and they were a hit at my work's potluck.

Okay, but I will not make again. Dough seemed just right, but once it was baked and cooled it just broke into pieces, was not able to slice and bake the second time. I just baked lumps and ate it anyway.

Excellent!  During the making of these cookies, I decided to be more generous with the cocoa powder, and ended up adding two tablespoons extra to the dough.  Otherwise, made as stated, with the addition of a white chocolate glaze drizzled over them after baking.  I also dipped the bottoms in white chocolate (melted with a bit of parrafin so it would set up nicely).  All that work and the platter was empty inside thirty minutes.  Oh well!

So wonderful! I used regular sized chocolate chips and also lowered the temperature to 250 degrees on the second bake. It was messy to make but oh-so-good! I'll make this many more times for gifts:) Thanks for this fun recipe!

This recipe was quite good. The log after the first time cooking was very crumbly though. This made my biscotti sort of uneven looking but the end product was pretty good. I kept them in the oven for 20 minutes and they were beginning to burn a little bit, so i will probably lower the time next time.
thanks!

Wow these were good! My first attempt at biscotti and I loved them. My mother on the other hand, she would give me away in trade for these. =] She absolutely loved them, which means they must be good because she's tried them all. Good recipe, will use again.

The great thing about biscotti is its versatility so this recipe works well as a starter. I'm a hard-core chocolate lover so tried dark chocolate cocoa, dark chocolate chips and dried cherries for a Black Forest biscotti. Next time I think I'll stick with or cut the dark with the regular cocoa. The dark cocoa is just too bitter and makes the biscotti crumble more easily. But everyone loved them and the cherries gave them a nice chewy contrast to the crunch. I only wish this recipe made more biscotti like some of my favorite recipes.

That's the best recipe. I rocked at the cookie exchange! I followed the recipe exactly, and temperature was also good for my oven. I used regular chocolate ships, not miniatures. And some pecans instead of walnuts. Turned out great.

These were extremely good.  They weren't the hardness of biscotti .. kind of a hard brownie but they were yummy. My son (4) keeps walking past them and each time its..mmmm yummmmmmmy mummmy.  I added almond extract to the yolk water mixture for that almond flavour as I left nuts out.  I cooked for 20 min at 375 but reduced the 2nd cook temp to 300 and did 10 min per side. Very yummy.

Mmmm, I made these tonight and they're so yummy.  I did have some trouble with crumbling.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I'll cut them slower and do what other reviewers recommend.  My dad says they'd go great with coffee.  I'm thinking of brushing coffee over the tops next time.  The chocolate chips aren't even necessary, and neither are the nuts, but they sure are good.  Crunchy and delicious!

I'm eating one of these as we speak and they are yummy, they are the perfect dryness, not too hard or too chewy.

I was a bit disappointed after reading the wonderful reviews. The cooking time should be reduced as others stated. They came out much to hard, even for biscotti, however the flavor is good, so I will try again.

These are awesome!  Though, I have to admit, they taste better "soft" as opposed to slicing them and baking them the extra 15 minutes per side.

Hey - these were not bad - especially for my first time at making biscotti. I forgot to do the egg wash and it didn't affect the flavor, just the texture. I think it might have made them a little more crisp. Mine didn't turn out crisp but that wasn't a bad thing. I turned down the heat to 250 as suggested by others but I think they could've been in there a little longer but I was afraid to burn them! I also used pecans instead of walnuts and drizzled white chocolate over them to make them pretty! Everyone who ate them liked them so I'm happy! I want to try it again though now that I'm more comfortable with the process and next time I'll remember the egg wash!

I made this cookie with Splenda, reduced the butter to 2 tbs. and added 1/3 cup of apple sauce.  It's still pretty good, althoughI would have liked to have tasted the original.  Maybe I'll try that next time.

Excellent! I had no crumbling problem...but I do want to know how you can get 30 cookies out of this recipe? If you make 2-9 inch rolls and slice them 1 inch wide...well, do the math yourselves...you can't get any more than 18 that way! It was so good though, and I eliminated the chocolate chips for a lighter calorie version!

These were so easy to put together.  Letting them cool for the entire half an hour kept them from crumbling when I sliced them.  I drizzled them with some melted white chocolate before serving.  I only managed to save two!  I'll definitely make these again and again.

I've made several types of biscotti, and so far my friends and family like this one the best.  Even non-chocolate lovers like it; its not overly sweet.  Its also good dipped in chocolate or white chocolate.

Fantastic!!! I cut the **second** bake time (when the cut slices are baked) in half. This reduced the hardness of the biscotti and there was very little crumbling and no pieces fell apart. It was delicious!

These smelled just like brownies when they were baking.  Yummy, yummy!!  I also used whole almonds, one of my logs broke you need to be very careful when handling them as they tend to break easily at least mine did.  I was in a hurry trying to get the Thanksgiving turkey in the oven!!!  Great recipe, thanks for sharing it.  Lynda from Calgary (Cowtown) Alberta, Canada.
