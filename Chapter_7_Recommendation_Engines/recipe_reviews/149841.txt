I tried this recipe during this year's Christmas cookie baking marathon, and it's a simple, yummy cookie that's easy to put together. I found that a few hours in the fridge was easier than in the freezer (dough was easier to cut). I also rolled the dough into 3 - 4 rolls to make handling easier. I also tried a batch with dried blueberries, and those were good too. Mabye a little drizzle of icing across the cookies would make them even prettier. Thanks!

The edges of my cookies did not get brown, even after several extra minutes in the oven.  But they are certainly hard, and VERY sweet.  I think I'll have to dunk them in coffee, like biscotti.  They're OK, but not what I thought they would be. Plain-looking, but certainly don't need extra sweetness by drizzling icing on them.  Update: not as hard after spending the night in a closed container.  Took them to a pitch-in and got lots of positive comments.  I'm changing my rating from 3 to 4 stars and won't bake them as long next time.

This was a great recipe! I hate cookies that are too sweet, but the mix of sour cranberries and cinnamon made this recipe great. I only froze the dough for about 40 minutes and that still worked out though it was a bit sticky. Also, I hate doughy cookies so I cooked them the suggested time and then left them in and watched them until they were the texture I like. The first couple were good, but they were super hard the next day so I had to microwave them every time I wanted some. I would advise following the cook time and letting them sit to see how they harden. Mine looked raw, but I bet they woudl have hardened into perfection.

This recipe turned out a lot more complicated than it should've been. It called for way too much flour. I didn't even cook them for as long as they were supposed to be cooked and they still turned out hard as rocks by the next day.

I sincerely hope that you would enjoy this recipe, however, my original portion of this recipe was 400g of flour, 250g of butter(a stick); and 240g of sugar. I'm very sorry to Meghan that your cookies didn't turn out as expected. I have baked my cookies with this ratio for several times, and it was pretty consistent, honestly. Hope this will help anyone who would like to try this recipe.

I made this recipe last year for Xmas and it was amazing, I ended up making an additional batch of cookies. I have never commented on a recipe before but felt that I needed to add my input for these cookies.  I will be making them again this year. I would suggest adding a little bit more cinnamon--my cinnamon could have been a little outdated.  This one is worth trying.

Great little cookie recipe. Definitely different from the normal recipes. I baked as directed, and the cookies stayed good for days. Don't overbake - I'd bet they'd be rock hard if you left them in too long. However, 10 minutes worked perfectly.

This is a wonderfully delicate, cinnamony tasting, cranberry cookie!  And I made this cookie for a Christmas Cookie exchange!  I too, thought at first that with the added time in the freezer it would be more then I wanted to do.  But as I got into my cookie baking, the time flew by quite fast!  This cookie is quite tasty, and quite a good recipe to have on hand.  I saved my cookies the extra ones not used in the cookie exchange in zip-lock baggies, there they stayed nice and fresh in the refrigerator.  Of course they didn't stay there long...we have cookie monsters in our house.  ^^~

They are tasty, but for me, they need a little bit of modification. 
For a start, I used only 1,5 cup of sugar, and they were still very sweet. But the cranberries somehow saved them with the dash of sour taste. 
Also, next time I'd add more then one teaspoon of cinnamon (2 perhaps). I love cinnamon but I could barely taste it in these cookies. 
After 10 mins in the oven they were still a bit flabby, so I baked them for another 10 mins or even longer (in 175 degrees C).

To make the cookies lower fat, dairy-free, and soft, I used 2/3 cup margarine and 7 tablespoons applesauce (in place of 1 cup butter). The batter was a little liquidy had a pretty strong apple taste- but these apple cinnamon cranberry cookies were great! To make the log more solid I added flour to the remaining dough, and the apple wasn't noticeable at all. However, the cinnamon was drowned out. So, still good, but next time I will add extra cinnamon, as a previous reviewer suggested. 

In short, if you like a soft cookie and/or want to cut the fat, try this recipe with 2/3 C butter + 7 Tablespoons unsweetened applesauce, 2.25 cups flour, and 1.25-1.5 teaspoons cinnamon.

I tried this recipe this afternoon.  I made them exactly as per directions only adding another teaspoon of cinnamon. These cookies are hard as rocks and flavor-wise they leave much to be desired. Some orange zest might spice them up a bit, but short of taking them out of the oven half raw I don't know how to deal with the jawbreaker aspect.
