This was GREAT, everyone loved it. Here were some slight changes I made just for personal taste. I used chopped cucumber instead of broccoli, yellow & red peppers instead of green, wheat pasta since you can't tell that much of a difference once you add all the dressings. Didn't use the green onions & used light miracle whip & light creamy italian. Made for a very good, light summer salad, thanks!

Oh Man!!! This is the best!! The only thing I did different is blanch the brocolli, add some dried dill,  and I used "Hidden Valley Italian Ranch" intead of another creamy Italian dressing. I may add about 1/2 a cup of celery next time I make it just for some added crunch. I may add cucumber on a third try just to see what transpires. This recipe is easy and worth a try.

Well all my husband can say is WOW, THIS IS THE BEST SALAD I HAVE EVER HAD!
I am allergic to seafood so could not have it but he says it is great. I used shrimp, , and lobster and I used Classic Herb dressing instead of Italian. I also blanched the broccoli, for a few minutes. Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing.

After reading the reviews, I decided to make this salad for a reception this past weekend.  WOW!!!  It was easy to make,although a little time consuming (I did blanch the broccoli and used red, yellow,and green peppers for added color.  The dressing I used was Kraft's creamy Italian - 1/4 C.)  Everyone thought the salad was  delicious and it was gone before I was able to get a second helping - Usually, I'm not a fan of crab, imitation or otherwise, but there's just something about this combination of ingredients, I guess!  I plan to make this again and highly recommend it to everyone.  Thank you!!!

this was a good recipe. i used an entire box of shells, 1 red pepper, 1 green pepper, 1 broccoli bunch, 1 pint of grape tomatoes, and 4 packs of imitation crab meat. tripled the dressing and it turned out great. everyone loved it.**** while making this again for a party i decided to leave out the tomatoes. they just didnt seem to fit to me and i like it better without.

Very tasty! I used vegetable noodles instead of shells because I like the added color, and I didn't have Italian so I used Creamy Ceasar instead. Still wonderful!

I saw this recipe and was really excited. I always make a crab salad, but never thought to put pasta in it. It made it go a lot further. I kept the recipe the same. Except I just cut up 2 roma tomatoes instead of the grape tomatoes. I didn't have green pepper or broccoli, so I put in raw peas and celery. :) I just added mayo and Mrs. Dash seasoning. No creamy Italian in the fridge. Delicious.

I absolutely LOVED this dish.  It has been a great hit amongst family and friends.  I altered the receipt slightly.  I used hidden valley ranch dressing instead of creamy italian and red onions instead of green onions while adding black olives and celery.

I just made this dish as my "something new for Thanksgiving" dish. I can honestly say it is phenomenal (I taste my food before I serve it)! The only thing is I also added celery for more texture and because I like celery. I also used regular tomatoes diced instead of the cherry tomatoes. I'm pretty sure this is going to be a huge hit for tomorrow's dinner.

I made this salad for myself using whatever I had on hand. I used frozen brocoli I cooked before hand, A whole tomato chopped , a yellow onion,. I ommitted the bell pepper.
For the dressing, I used mayo, parmesan cheese and ranch dressing. It still came out delicious!!

Thought it was  good- used ranch dressing instead of italian and also threw the brocoli in with the pasta for the last few minutes of cooking- oh yeah whole wheat pasta instead of white just cause white is garbage for your body. Black olives and cucumbers are going into it next time i try it.

We really enjoyed this as a cool summer supper. I used the recipe as a base and made a few changes to meet our tastes. I added a little garlic powder and fresh basil. I added extra crab, blanched the broccoli and added a lot of extra veggies - extra broccoli, carrots, olives, red pepper, peas - yummy! I think it would be good with baby spinach too. I also used whole wheat pasta - it made a really healthy, tasty dish.

I was looking for a seafood salad recipe and came acrosss this recipe. Instead of imitation crab meat, I used canned crab meat and instead of shells, I used rotini noodles. It was a hit. Now at every occasion, I am asked to bring the'seafood salad'. This is definately  a recipe I will continue to make.

I made this for a last minute cookout and it got rave reviews.  I made a few changes based on other reviews and my own preferences.  I used multi-colored pasta, cucumbers and Miracle Whip instead of the broccoli florets and mayo.  I seasoned it with paprika, Mrs Dash Original Blend, a little sea salt and pepper.  It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

This was great and the whole family loved it from the 2 1/2 year old to the adults.  Instead of brocolli I used cucumbers.
For kids who do not like seafood you can simply use cooked diced ham and american or chedder cheese instead.

loved it and will make again

This salad was fantastic!  We had to make a couple of changes only because we were too lazy to run to the store a second time.  We left out the broccoli and instead of using green pepper we used diced celery for crunch.  This was truly delicious, so good in fact that it got eaten before I could snap a picture.  I've asked my daughter to make it for me again.

This recipe was very good.  Alot of pasta salads you have to let them sit for a while to soak up the flavor before they taste good but mine tasted great right away.  This is what I did, I used garden pasta shells for some color and I used McCormicks lime mayo (it just has a hint of lime in it, it isn't overpowering).  I also dont like peppers so I subsituted them with cooked peas, and sprinkled a little cayenne pepper on top for some kick. Everything else I made according to recipe. My family loved it.  Great as a side dish with pretty much anything....will for sure make again.

This salad was wonderful.  It is so easily adapted to your personal taste.  You can use any variety of veggies you prefer and as much or as little pasta as you llike.  Do Not change the dressing recipe.  It makes the salad and is so good as is.

Delicious. The dressing is wonderful.
I threw in some canned shrimp and it was great.
I used this same dressing with diced avacado, red and green peppers, green onion and cherry tomatoes.  It was so good I wanted to lick the bowl!
UPDATE: I've made this a few more times and it's always so good. I have used Kraft Roasted Red Pepper Italian dressing with the mayo and parmesean cheese and it is a WONDERFUL combination!

I used real crab meat--delicious!  I think this would also make a great appetizer.

This recipe was pretty good but the mayonnaise in the dressing was a little overpowering.  I also substituted the broccoli with cucumbers for a cooler, fresher taste and used only green bell peppers, which was fine.  My guests enjoyed it : )

I used a can of real crab claw meat, and creamy balsamic vinegar, because it was what I had on hand. I also didn't have peppers or broccoli, so I chopped up some asparagus instead. I used lots of dill, garlic salt, and lemon pepper for flavor. The basic recipe was helpful as a starting point; very easy to modify and make it my own with what I had on hand. Came out very yummy.

I really like the dressing for this salad.  The 1st time I ate it almost immediately after preparing and found the taste good but kind of strong.  It was definately better the next day.  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I skipped the peppers due to personal preference.  I think this recipe would be great with shrimp, ham, or just keeping it vegetarian and adding the veggies of your choice.  A great picnic salad!

Wonderful recipe! Did a few alterations (more dill, more fresh cut vegies, added kalamata olives, used hidden valley ranch instead of creamy italian as was suggested by someone else) and we loved it! Next time I might add just a tidge of horseradish.... just for fun!

I just made this salad for a 4th of July party we attended this year.  I thought it was excellent, but when a young man who I didn't even know, walked up to me and said "you made the crab salad, right?  I've had a lot of crab salads, and that was by far the best ever!"  And given the size of the bowl I used and the fact that it was "empty" when I took it home - I'd say don't hesitate to try this one.  I used a yellow pepper instead of green (had it) and didn't put the broccoli in.  Good salad!!!

Delicious! I didn't have any green peppers so I used the tomatoes, broccolli and onion then added celery and black olives. I liked how the olives gave more color and they go great with the other flavors. Definitely a favorite that I'll make many times again!!!

This salad was the best.  We live on an island and creamy Italian salad dressing was not available to me so I used Ceasar and it was great.  I can't wait to get back to the states and try it with Italian.

Not crazy about seafood but decided to try it - enriching my culinary horizons. Easy to make, tasty, not to 'fishy' tasting - I liked it! Key to recipe is the absolute ease in putting it together. Didn't have time to let it sit in the fridge - even so, very flavorful!

Excellent recipe.  I added 2 tbsp each fresh chives and basil from the garden.  Subst. caesar for the italian dressing and added 1 tbs. of dijon and the juice of 1/2 lemon.  I didn't have brocolli so I used 3/4 c of frozen peas instead.  The recipe needs s&P PLUS a tsp of hot pepper flakes for added zestiness.  Excellent basic recipe although it would have been too bland for our family without the additions.

I was looking for a great pasta salad to use up the excessive amount of imitation crab I bought, and this one was amazingly delicious!  Due to picky eaters in my family, I left out the cherry tomatoes, and the green pepper, and substituted by adding an extra 1/2 cup of broccoli, and a 1/2 cup of celery.  The colour of the crab meat and veggies in this salad, make it appealing to the eye as well as the stomach!!

This recipe was delicious! My fiance gobbled down the leftovers before they even made it into the fridge. 

I could not find any cherry tomatoes at the store so I just cut up a regular tomato which seemed to work just fine. I also substituted regular mayo for half the fat and regular Italian dressing for fat free and had zero complaints. 

I definitely recommend this recipe and will be making it again and again!!!

Not sure if it is fair to rate it, but it gave me good base idea!  I used some imitation crab, some real canned, used a frozen stir-fry mix for veggies and added I pretty much followed dressing except for a little less mayo & more parm.

This is a great pasta salad.  I've made it twice now.  The first time it was awesome.  The second time I used a different mayo and it tasted a little different, although still good. I did omit the green peppers, but added carrots.  I also found a recipe for Italian dressing and made my own.  It was quite easy. Definitely great for a potluck or a side dish.

Very tasty.  I used salad size shrimp instead of crab cuz that's what I had. I thought the dressing lacked a little flavor - could have been just a bit more robust but overall a great pasta salad for everyone.

I have made this twice in one week because it was requested after the first BBQ I took it to.  Everyone loved it. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was a hit, the second time I made it with large shell pasta and extra dressing (mostly because the pasta was bigger) and instead of green onions (because I didn't have them) I used finely chopped red onion. I also added a little extra parmigiana cheese. WOW I've never had so many compliments... Will make this again and again!!!

I could not detect the crab in this recipe at all. I tried the pasta immediately after mixing all the ingredients and it was pretty good however after being refrigerated for the 2 hours it had NO flavor.
