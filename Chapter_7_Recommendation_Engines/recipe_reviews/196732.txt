(6/15/09) This was excellent.  I did use less salt than specified but this recipe is definitely one I'll make again and again.  Thanks for sharing it MrsMDSmith (and calling my attention to it on the exchange; it was perfect timing as I was looking for a side to go with dinner!) *(6/18/09 Update)*  I wanted to stop by again to thank you MrsMDSmith.  You not only gave me a delicious side dish but I used the leftovers to make a main dish that I will probably also do again and again.  I chopped the leftovers and mixed in 1/2 lb. of seasoned browned ground pork, rolled in egg roll wrappers and fried to golden perfection.  I love a recipe that can give me two distinct meals!

This one blasts the meat off the bone! Pork fat, onion, garlic (preferably fresh), and cabbage is a Tennessee staple overlooked by the rest of the country (too bad).  Thanks for sharing this recipe with the community. My 1/4 Cherokee friend/co-worker raved about this recipe for years.  It always sounded too greasy, until I tried it......OMG! It's sooooooo comforting. He used 'fatback' (smoked pork fat)===less salty than bacon and no nitrites. Anyway, a great southern recipe, and I'm glad you shared it. P.S.  Try some red Savoy cabbage with the green kind.  It doesn't wilt so much and has a sweeter flavor. I'd like to see a good recipe for baked beans, Southern Style! Mitchy48

I've been eating cabbage prepared this way all my life (love it!) but never to the point where the onions were caramelized.  It was nice, but there wasn't enough of a difference that it's worth the extra time it takes to get them to that point.  I didn't add the onion powder, garlic powder (there's already fresh minced garlic) or paprika.  I like it just fine without.

This was good.  I did drain a little of the bacon grease prior to adding the cabbage it just looked like too much grease for me.  As far as the salt goes, I only added about 1/2tsp. at first (I was only using 1/2 a fairly small cabbage.  AT first, before simmering for 30 minutes it tasted just right for us.  Then, after the simmer, I tasted before serving and the salt had almost disappered so I added a few sprinkles more.  I can see if you have a huge cabbage where you may need quite a bit.  Thanks for the recipe

I thought I would want more bacon, but I stuck to the recipe and it was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! My change...Olive oil and real bacon bits, instead of cooking the bacon and using the drippings.

Yummy, yummy, yummy. I replaced the 3 tablespoons of salt with seasoned salt added to taste and I cooked the cabbage on medium until just tender. Definately a keeper.

Just made this with a Napa cabbage and a Walla Walla sweet onion. Wow! Sweet, salty and so good even my husband who hates cabbage and my daughter who won't eat anything green liked it. I used 1 tsp salt because my cabbage was small and a little less garlic.

This was excellent.  I served it with ham, potato salad and black-eyed peas on New Year's Day.  I didn't use all of the onion called for, nor did I use onion powder (didn't have it).  Like other reviewers, I cut the salt back (to 1tsp).  Only a small dish left, and I intend to eat that as a snack later!

I think I should have been more careful about when I added the salt. I dumped it into the meat rather then putting the cabbage first. It turned out ok, was still edible but next time I will follow directions. I also added some polish sausage to this dish to make it a more complete meal it was pretty tasty. Also, next time I will add the bacon last.

I had a small head of cabbage that I had grown in my garden & only 3 slices of bacon, so I cut back on the rest of the ingredients and it did not effect the taste.  Awesome!  Our family demolished this dish.

Made this on Saturday for my daughter's graduation party on Sunday.  Outstanding.  It was a hit with all of the polish relatives and even the non-polish!  The night we made it I decided to add some spaetzels.  I sampled it and thought it was OK.  The next day, we warmed it and tried it again....it was excellent! I doubled the recipe, used 1lb of bacon and added the spaetzels.

This was so good!  Reminded me of the fried cabbage that my Hungarian grandma would make, although she cooked it down quite a bit more and then mixed it with cooked noodles - yum.  For those that rated it low because of saltiness, the recipe did say "or to taste".  When I make a recipe I rarely use as much salt as the recipe states.  I waited until the cabbage was almost cooked through before even adding any salt.  Or another way is to salt the raw cabbage and let sit for awhile, rinse and squeeze until almost dry.

The taste of this recipe is outstanding.  During the meal my husband couldn't stop commenting on how good it was.  I didn't dice the onions but rather sliced them.  Next time I think I will drain the bacon fat after cooking the bacon and cook everything else with a little olive oil.

This is an age-old recipe originating I believe  either in Slovakia or Germany.  It is delicious!  It is called Halushka or Kalushka depending on what country it was from.  I've made this for years and years but have never used garlic, however will try that.  Agree with others as to draining some of the bacon fat, otherwise it's too greasy as well as (if your adding garlic) hold off on adding it in the beginning  ~ nothing worse than burnt, bitter garlic to ruin any dish!  We always serve this mixed with a small amount of curly egg noodles.

This dish is so delicious and flavorful!  The bacon compliments the cabbage perfectly!  When I make it again I will drain a little of the bacon grease.

I've been making this for many years.  It's also great using sliced polish sausage in place of the bacon and I also always add diced bell peppers as well whether using polish sausage or bacon, or if you prefer both meats.   It also makes a tasty meal boiled in a little water or you can use a little chicken or beef broth in place of the water if you prefer and  you don't have to keep nearly as close a watch on it when your gently boiling it in a stew pot with a lid on it instead of frying.  Both ways are scrumptious.  I use a whole head of cabbage (quartered), a couple of med. to large size onions and a good sized diced green bell pepper as well as a whole polish sausage in mine.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Just throw it all in a pot and gently boil until your cabbage is tender.  Oh yeah,  potato diced in 1 to 1/2 inch chunks are also very good in it.  Makes a great quick, healthy, delicious one pot meal which goes over any time of the year.  Best thing too is it doesn't break the bank to make a large stew pot of it and it reheats very well in your microwave.

This would have been good had I not used the whole amount of salt(1 Tblsp, it was so salty I could barely eat it.  I am sorry to rate it a 1, but I find it bvest to rate against the original recipe than to rate it based on alterations.

It was bland. Researched some other recipes and added a couple pinches of sugar, then a couple dashes of vinegar. Still bland. I would try it again but add some cayenne pepper or kielbasa next time for some more kick. Or... maybe some applewood smoked or black pepper bacon?

Wow, wow, wow!!!  This recipe is unbelievable!  I cut the salt in half--at least, added 3 cloves of garlic, and added just a bit of crushed pepper flakes.  This is a recipe I will make again, and again, and again.  I am on a low carb diet, and cabbage is a low carb veggie--so this recipe fits quite well into a low carb diet.  Thanks for sharing it!  

Note added: Using fresh garlic is a plus!

Bacon is salty enough as is, I definitely didn't need a tbsp of salt.  I think I used about 1/4 tbsp of garlic salt in the end.  Okay dish, I added some noodles to make it a full meal.

Tasted just like what Grandma Kanady used to make! Brought back some really good memories. I had to put the splash of vinegar on like we always did...I didn't relize how rich it is! lol Probably won't make often, but sure was a wonderful "comfort and cozy" moment. THANKS!

Great recipe! Went wonderful with our corn beef! Made as directed, but I only had three slices of thick cut pepper bacon and it was enough to give it a great flavor anyway. We liked that fact that this recipe can also be used with the Paleo or Primal Blue Print way of eating.  Thank you Kathi for sharing!

Pretty good and will make again with the following changes- no more than 1 tsp salt and cut the pepper in half.  I left the bacon out- cut calories- just sprayed the pan with Pam first.  Around 8 calories in every 1 ounce.

I'm with Naples34102 on this one!  I, too, was raised up eating cabbage this way and this is my standard way of preparing it for my family...also minus the onion/garlic powders, paprika and caramelizing of the onion.  It's tasty w/o doing or adding all that.  A really easy and great way to fix cabbage.  And, to simplify it even further try stir-frying the chopped cabbage in a little butter and salt/pepper to taste.  That's good too!!

Hubby is the fried cabbage person and liked it. To me the flavors were great but the texture way too mushy for my taste. I would have preferred to eat it w/o covering for the last 30. And I also would wait to add the cooked bacon until right before serving - I prefer my veggies n bacon crisp.

Great recipe but I added some whipping cream before adding the noodles, and it gave it a creamier taste. Kids loved it.

We didn't have any bacon but we did have some bacon grease in the refrigerator (don't judge) , so we put some in the pot and cooked the garlic and onions in it and then added the cabbage.  In place of bacon we had a ham steak and cooked it for several minutes in the cast iron skillet then cut it up and added it to the cabbage.  It was delish and so easy!  Will make again :)

My family loved this dish.  I modified it slightly by adding kielbasa and about 1/2 teaspoon of salt only because a tablespoon seemed like way too much for our liking.  You can always add more, but can't take it out if it's too salty.  It made enough for two adults and two children, but no leftovers.  I might double the recipe next time just so we can have some for lunches.  Great dish!  It's a keeper.

Delicious as is, however I added the spin of 3 large handfuls of pre cooked egg noodles & a Dolly Partonesque" grilled chicken breast, cut into bite size pieces. I also added 1/2 tap of "slap ya mama" season for some kick.

I've been eating cooked/steamed cabbage all my life & NEVER has it tasted this good!! All the spices & carmelizing the onions..over the top! I've since used ham or sausage (out of bacon)with this recipe & it's stiil wonderful. I do not cook the cabbage for as long as instructed as I don't care for super-wilted cabbage. A+++

I remember this from my childhood and still make it. Instead of powder I use fresh onion, ditto the garlic. How much depends upon your personal taste though we use about one medium onion to five large toes of garlic and sautee them with the bacon.  For those who don't know, if you burn the garlic it's best to start over as the burned garlic is bitter.

We will sometimes serve with butter or sour cream and it goes great with kielbasa or pork.

This was delicious for our New Year's day meal!  I fried the bacon and did not drain the grease.  Removed the bacon and set it aside.  Added the onions and garlic, then cooked it for a while before adding the cabbage and spices.  Crumbled the cooked bacon right before serving.  Scrumptious and easy!!

I followed the recipe with no modifications but it was too rich for me.  I must have messed up somewhere but it is such a basic recipe that I am not sure how I could have.  I may try again just to give it a chance, it certainly sounds amazing.

DO NOT PUT 1 TABLESPOON OF SALT!!! I really liked this recipe and will make it again, BUT I thought 1 tablespoon of salt sounded way too much. I measured out 1 tablespoon (I used kosher salt.) however I put maybe a little less than half of a tablespoon. It still could have used less!!! I would call myself a saltaholic and it was almost too salty. I was serving it with plain white rice so the saltiness it did have was ok. Next time though, I will start out with maybe just a teaspoon of salt.

I have made this 3 times now in a months time.  My husband who normally would not try cabbage LOVED this!  I had left over wild rice and grilled chicken and I mixed all three together.  Very tasty!

I really liked this recipe. Usually I don't use garlic powder or onion powder, but in this case I liked it.

I just made this for dinner and we loved it! I was looking for something different to do with my cabbage an found this recipe and liked the way it sounded. Even my daughter who won't eat cabbage unless it's coleslaw liked it. I made it as written, no changes. I will be making this again soon!Thanks for the recipe Kathi!

Love this! I've made it three times now.

The only thing I've changed was not to add any salt. For us, the salt in the bacon is enough. It's perfect.

I grew up eating this and it is very good, the only difference, I have never added paprika so I am definitely going to try that with the head of cabbage I have in the refrigerator.  Only thing extra I add is some grated carrot, just enough to add a little color.  Looks great and tastes even better....In a pinch, if I don't have sliced bacon I will use Hormel bacon bits instead because I always have them on hand and saute the onions and garlic in olive oil, its good but nothing beats the taste of real sliced bacon and bacon grease for flavor but when you are hungry for fried cabbage it works.

The one time I don't read the comments and blindly add 3 T salt-ruined the dish, it was inedible.  So sad, it smelled so good but I sure wish it had said 1T of salt and more to taste. Bummer.

This was really tasty. I only had 1/2 a head of cabbage so I used about 1/4 - 1/2 t of sea salt. Made with "Pork Chops with Blue Cheese Gravy" and "Strawberry Spinach Salad I". The gravy from the pork chops complimented the cabbage side dish very well (to my surprise).

I feel like I finally made good cooked cabbage with this recipe!  I made it just like the recipe says, except cooked it longer just because we like it that way.  Wonderful with smoked sausage, black-eyed peas and cornbread.

Go easy on the salt, and it wouldn't hurt to drain out about half the bacon grease -- or drain it all out and use a little olive oil instead. Great recipe, though, and very filling!

Recipe calls for 1 Tablespoon of salt.  That seemed like too much to me, so I added only a little over 1/2 Tbsp.  Otherwise used the quantity of ingredients mentioned.  

This came out too salty to eat even after cutting that back.  Pepper was also at least twice what I think was indicated.  In the end, really not edible, though I will definitely try again.  I think the recipe has promise, and I had no idea how to fry cabbage.  I'll just cut seasoning way back.

It's possible that Kathi used a much larger cabbage head.  I used the largest available at our grocer.  I think if I'd have had 2 heads of the size I had, spices would still have been too much.

Love it!!! But did I miss removing the bacon before adding everything else and then adding the bacon back in? My bacon became flaccid, the cabbage was wonderfully flavored but I wish I had removed the bacon and garnished with the crispy bits after.

This is excellent, I did make one change in that I cut the added salt in half and still found it too salty. Next time I will use a scant 1 tsp and go from there.
With making for the second time I reduced the salt still further to 1 tsp. Perfect. Will make again for sure.  Upping rating to 5 star.

This was delicious! As a lazy cook, I "cheated"  by using Cole slaw mix already shredded up, and used less salt. It turned out beautifully and I will definitely be making this again!

I'm not from the south, nor have I ever heard of this side dish, so take that into consideration with my review.   Having said that, I think the bones of this recipe are good, but the execution is not right for me.   Simmering the cabbage for 30 minutes at the end is WAY to long.   Turns the dish into mush and it gets too juice with the lid on the pot.   I should have pulled it off the stovetop just as the cabbage started to soften and skipped the rest of the "cover and simmer" phase completely.   It's also painfully salty if you use the 1 T. amount.   I'd go with 1 tsp. to start and add more if you need it.   The bacon adds a lot of salt by itself.   I will try this again with mods because I think it is a unique side dish.

Loved it! First time cooking cabbage. I love bacon, cabbage, onion, and garlic so this recipe was the key to a perfect Irish side dish! Super easy to cook, took about an hour including prep. Turned out absolutely amazing. Used maple smoked bacon and did not put onion powder in (didn't have any). Will make this again and again.  Had seconds and thirds! GIVE THIS A TRY!!

I have made this twice. The first time it was way too salty with 1tbl of salt. Second time I used 1 tsp and it tasted good. I added one more piece of bacon because my cabbage head was very large and that was ideal.

Just made this tonite with Corned Beef, followed the recipe to a T. I put the Corned Beef in the crockpot and made this on the stove. Freakin' AMAZING! Even my kid who doesn't care a ton for cabbage just came back for seconds.
Thanks for sharing this recipe, will definitely make it again!

This was a HUGE hit in my family. I made 3 huge pans full in the last week & making a fourth tonight. I cook it in a extra large frying pan & never used a lid. Didn't add much salt since bacon already has a lot of sodium.

very simple and easy to make....I did use a small head of cabbage since that is what i had,and omitted the onion and garlic powder and added more of the real stuff during the cooking... I also add a ring of kielbasi and some egg noodles..which makes it more of a meal rather than a side dish...I will make this again

If it weren't for the amount of pepper, this would've been a 5 star++ rating for us! It was so overwhelmingly peppery, I feel "Pepper" should be in the recipes name. Fantastic flavor other than that(I did only use 1 tsp of salt). I don't think the garlic powder was necessary either, since it already has minced garlic. My preference, I suppose. Thanks, Kathi! We'll definately be having this again but will use half the pepper!!

This was a flavorful, different side dish. I just made a small batch for my husband and I with our grilled brats. I don't think I cooked it quite as long as the recipe called for. We really liked it and I will be making it again soon!

I used the full amount of salt (1 TBsp.) and it didn't taste salty at all, which is great since I don't like it to be overpowering and because I have high blood pressure... Anyway, the only thing this dish lacked was some spice. I dribbled on some hot sauce to give it kick, next time I'll throw in some chili flakes or powder to cook the heat in. This would be nice with some diced tomatoes (fresh or canned). Could easily turn this into a main dish by omitting the bacon and adding some beef or chicken. Not sure if I will make this again, as I've tried better cabbage recipes on AR.

I loved this recipe! I used it for my first time cooking cabbage and it came out beautifully. I love greens cooked with hamhocks and the bacon adds a good flavor to the cabbage. Putting this one in my recipe box!

I have been eating this since I was a child and I'm now 66.  This came from an old eastern European recipe.   The original was bacon grease, cabbage, noodles, salt and pepper.  It was an inexpensive dish and a way to use the bacon grease.  No one threw away bacon grease.  It was strained and added to the cup or pot of grease.  This recipe has changed over the years, but add, subtract whatever you like.  But keep those original ingredients!

My family loves this Fried Cabbage with Bacon, Onion, and Garlic! My 12-year-old grandson asked if it could be his afterschool snack every day! Wow and good for ya! My only suggestion is to add some vinegar for extra flavor but this recipe is yummy delicious already!

This is a recipe that my mom handed down to me (I'm 80 yrs old)  from her mom.  The seasonings were whatever was on hand and most times we used salt pork rather than bacon but it is essentially the same dish. I like the addition of garlic. Thanks.

Really tasty!  And aside from draining the bacon and adding more paprika... the recipe is spot on!

Bacon.  There ya go.  'Nuff said.  

Okay, so bacon AND cabbage, AND whatever spices you're in the mood for.  Today's recipe included my sweet paprika smuggled home from Budapest, more garlic than seems prudent, and a smattering of random spicy esoterica (redacted).  You can't go wrong with whatever you do, as the bacony-cabbagey bones of this dish (and it's a main dish, too) can't be broken.  Good food.  Make it.

Yummy!  Made it and will definitely make it again. I did drain off some bacon grease and used about 1/2 the salt, pepper, onion & garlic powder recommended but that was my choice since I’d never had it before. Turned out great!  I also added a package of cut up smoked sausage. Yum!

OMG!  If you have not yet tried this recipe, RUN...do NOT walk, to your local market, grab the ingredients and make it TONIGHT!   : )      I became addicted after the first bite and now make it 2-3 times a month. I serve with a dollop of sour cream on the side.  Never, did I ever think I would eat so much cabbage on a regular basis!  If you like cabbage, you will surely LOVE this!  If you are not a cabbage fan, I think this will change your mind!   I thought I would want extra slices of bacon....because BACON, but it is perfectly delicious with the recommended amount.  I also started with about 1 TSP of salt and I add more later if needed.  It depends on the saltiness of the bacon. FABULOUS recipe.  Get you some!!!  : )

This is absolutely delicious just the way it is. To make it into a one pot meal, I add smoked sausage or kielbasa once the bacon is crisp and some cooked egg noodles during the last 10 minutes. My grandmother and father also added caraway seeds when they made something similar years ago. Don't forget to deglaze the pain while you saute the onions (I use broth or beer, depending on what I have) - lots of flavor with those brown bits!

The only changes I made were adding a pound of bias-cut kielbasa to make it a main dish and cut the salt back, and this was a delicious low-carb dinner with almond flour biscuits.

Worst fried cabbage recipe I’ve ever eaten.  Way too SALTY.  Check the ingredient list.  Bacon is salty already.  Then the recipe says to salt to taste and lists 1 Tbsp os salt!  It was way too salty to eat.  Wouldn’t recommend this recipe the way it is.  Delete the salt and let the diners salt their own food.

This recipe is delicious. My one recommendation would be to cut the salt back by a tsp, so two tsp instead of a tablespoon. The bacon adds salt. Anyways, I made this recipe with cabbage and another time with quarter Brussels sprouts. It’s my favorite way to cook both!

I never made any changes because I wanted to see how the original recipe might taste.  I probably won’t make it again. Needs more flavor.  I would use pork chops instead of just bacon.  The bacon grease definitely is great for stir frying the veggies. But, I would fry some thin cut pork chops in the bacon grease, then add the veggies.  Yummmmm!!

Super easy recipe! Great flavor, and next time I plan to be very careful with the amount of crushed red pepper...it was a little spicy for my taste, but that was my mistake. Will definitely make this again!

We liked this.  I doubled the bacon.  And because it was bacon from a home grown pig that had very little fat I added 1 TBL of butter to saute in.  Will definitely make again.

We found a tablespoon of salt to be over the top, but other than that, this was great! Oh, after sauteeing the onion and garlic in the bacon grease, I deglazed the pan with a splash of red wine vinegar. Will make again for sure, with less salt!

We've had it exactly according to the recipe, and we've also added kielbasa and a little chicken broth (1/4-1/2 can).  Excellent either way!

This was soooo good.  I did tweek it a little by using Echrich Smoked Turkey Sausage sliced slightly diagonally in addition to the bacon.  Doing this made it more of a main dish. Yum!!

This was good. I used a bag of shredded cabbage. Less salt next time! I added bacon bits instead of bacon and added shredded steak. Next time: NO steak! It overtook it! I will make it again, maybe not cook it down so much.

I fried the bacon, drained the grease and removed bacon. Fried onions and garlic in a Tblsp of reserved grease until soft. Then added cabbage. Stirred and cooked for about 20 minutes.  Chopped up bacon into 1/2" pieces and added back in with cabbage mixture.

I added less salt than the recipe called for and this was still too salty for me.   Also removed the bacon after ir was crisp and added back at the end of cooking.

Very good but will do it differently next time. 6 slices of bacon generates a LOT of grease. This dish was too greasy for me and I like greasy stuff??  Next time I will pour off half the bacon grease and add a bit of water instead.

This is basically how I've always made cabbage. I usually don't add paprika tho, and I use a bit less bacon. I also finish it with some balsamic vinegar (around 2 tablespoons or to taste) which cuts through the heaviness of the bacon and adds some brightness to the dish.

I prepared this for my hubby. I rarely cook or eat cabbage except in stir fry or spring rolls. He RAVED about this recipe and LOVED it! (Did I say he loved it?) I just used some left over bacon grease to cook everything (so I didn't have any actual bacon in the recipe) and he still loved it. 

Since we're Ketogenic, this recipe worked beautifully for our way of eating. Thanks for sharing!

All is good with this recipe except I just cannot imagine eating cooked cabbage without some vinegar.  It just set's it apart.  That's why this is four stars for us.  And yes, I made it, but ended up adding a bit of vinegar after tasting before serving.

I added 2 cups diced potatoes when I started the bacon and sliced Kielbasa the last 10 minutes. I then added the salt slowly to taste as it all cooked. Since I added tbe potatoes I also added 1 cup chicken broth.  I followed the recipe otherwise. My family enjoyed it very much!

This is an excellent recipe for a nice comfort food meal.  My wife and I agreed that it's the best fried cabbage we've had and her Hungarian aunt used to make a pretty mean batch of it.  It was hard to put the fork down!

Will definitely make again but with about half a tablespoon of salt instead of a whole tablespoon. I noticed the original recipe called for 3 tablespoons!! I can't even fathom that! I felt 1T was too salty.

OH MY GOODNESS....Accidentally run up on this recipe, it looked and sounded good. It is soooo good and simple and easy to make. Thought I loved cabbage  but this is a whole different level of loving cabbage. Cooking it for New Years day along with my black eyed peas. DELICIOUS...??

To turn this delicious side dish into a main course simply add one 12-oz package of wide egg noodles cooked to package directions.  Add a bit of water if needed to combine.  Now you have my Hungarian mother's recipe for Galushka, a noodle and cabbage dish!

My family loved this recipe! I've tried other ones lately, but this is our favorite so far. We eat vegan, so I just omitted the bacon. I did use a little olive oil to sautée the onions and garlic and added a 32 oz. carton of vegetable broth. Thanks for sharing.

I'm not a cabbage fan but enjoyed this recipe. I added a little Chipotle Chili spice for a little punch. Ate it with rice the 1st day and with Spicy Italian sausage & Asparagus the 2nd day.  Delicious both times. Will make again!

I have been making a different version of this for years. Instead of bacon I use mild Italian sausage, about a pound. If you buy it by the links, remove the casings. Cook until sausage is browned and onions transparent.  Add freshly minced garlic, 2 cloves minced.  Following the recipe and after adding the cabbage, put in a can of Rotel tomatoes. Onion powder and garlic powder are not needed. Salt and pepper, cover and simmer till cabbage is done.

Will make this again!  Since there are only 2 in our house these days (kids are grown), I halved the cabbage, onion, garlic and seasonings....but used the full amt. of bacon. You can never have too much bacon!  It was delicious, and I'm so glad we tried it.  I may add a pinch of cayenne pepper next time--we like a little spicy

I make this adding bow tie pasta. 
In Hungarian, it's called Kapusta (cabbage) Tasta (pasta), and it's yummy!!!
The original Hungarian recipe called for leaving all the bacon fat in. However, I drain it all off, and add butter and a couple tablespoons of water instead, then cook in that until the cabbage is tender for a creamier slightly healhier version. I'd salt to taste too rather than adding a measured portion, because everyone's taste preferences are different.

As I was preparing this dish, I noticed it was cooking down like I thought it should. So I added low sodium chicken broth to it. It was soo good there wasn't anything left after dinner! This is now one of my go to recipes from now on. Thanks

This was very good- just like we made it in the south when I was a kid. I used a whole pound of bacon- and drained some of the fat.  Watch the salt- of course the extra bacon makes a difference, but if you use the garlic and onion powders, 1 teaspoon kosher salt is plenty.  I might also add some of the cabbage halfway through the 30 minute covered-cooking time so there is at least a little crunch. Will make again for sure!

I would definitely make this again. Realized my garlic had gone bad so I just upped the garlic powder.  Used the cabbage along  with ground pork and shrimp and made the best egg rolls with the left overs the next day!

This was pretty good, but I think I might try cooking it for less time next time to retain some texture. As written it was a bit mushier than I would have liked.

I used less than 1 TBSP salt and it was still too much. Remember, there is salt in the bacon. I added small pieces of apples. We really like it.

This was a hit at the table.  However, I added a little more bacon and added some heat to the dish, crushed red pepper, a little cayenne pepper and some hungarian paprika.  It was wonderful with a little heat.  Without it, I thought it was a bit bland.

I'll make this again--with a few adjustments.  One tablespoon of salt was too much along with the bacon.  I'd reduce salt by half.  I'd also drain maybe half the bacon grease and add a tablespoon or two of butter.  Smells wonderful; very satisfying!

I followed this recipe to the dot and it was absolutely terrible because of one small thing - the salt. I was speculative but I did what it said and put a tablespoon. Way too much salt.

We did not enjoy this recipe.  The flavors of the bacon and onion were lost in the cooking process.  Fried cabbage was soggy, and that is what happens the minute one adds so much salt to this recipe when cooking and covers the pot and cooks for 30 minutes more.  One can always season with more salt, once it is on your plate.

I make this the exact same way except i cook the bacon/sausage separately and then i add it right at the end. I mix it in later so the meat doesn't get leached of its flavor and still stays crispy.

If you really want to add to this recipe, add 3TBS of brown sugar at the end.  Let caramelize a little, shut off heat and mix in 3TBS of cider vinegar.

Made this recipe exactly as stated except for the salt, and it was great. My advice to others is to be patient cooking the bacon. Slowly let it get brown and crisp, you want to render as much fat out of the bacon as possible to cook
the cabbage with. Delicious!

This is exactly how I do brussel sprouts. Just substitute for cabbage and finish with a lid in the oven until tender. I have a 3 year old that can't get enough of it.

Sooooo good, definitely a keeper!  I used seasoned salt in place of regular salt but otherwise left the recipe alone.  Great!

The very BEST cabbage I've eaten since my grandma was alive. It not only tasted amazing but it brought back memories of her and how she made it!!! Definitely a recipe I will be making over and over again.

Caramelizing the onions does makes  difference!  Caramelizing always adds flavor. This will be my go to recipe for cabbage. Thank you.

Loved this fried cabbage and bacon recipe.  It's sounds too simple to be anything special, but what a wonderful side dish.  Ingredients are normal everyday things so there are no special items to buy.  Flavor is wonderful.  Cabbage is one of my favorite vegetables.  I've sautéed cabbage before but I really love this combination.  Thanks for sharing.

Let me just start by saying that I am a VERY picky eater - Green foods in particular have always been difficult for me. This recipe is the only way I can eat cabbage and I absolutely LOVE it. I could eat just this for dinner and be perfectly satisfied. I will say that I do add extra bacon and onions though.

I thought it was delicious!  I did at smoked kielbasa and only a 1/2 tsp of salt.  As others have said you can always add more to your taste.  Would definitely make again.

Good thing I was only cooking for my boyfriend and I - I kept licking the spatula while I was cooking!  I just could not wait for it to finish.  The smell, the taste, the texture... it was all perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will definitely be busting this one out to impress my German family. ;)

This was our side dish for supper tonight. I am not a huge "pepper" fan and should have known better than to use a whole teaspoon in this recipe. I will make it again though, we loved it despite the fact of it having too much pepper. I will probably add more bacon next time also. Very tasty. Thanks for sharing.

This is such a typical Southern side dish (or used to be), but I'm afraid I've lost my taste for grease. I knew that the directions didn't call for draining the grease, so I'm not going to knock off stars for something I don't care for anymore. (To think, we used to cook all vegetables in bacon grease!) It did have a good flavor otherwise. Since I am salt sensitive, I added salt to my tasting. I might cook this again, but play with draining the grease and adding just a little chicken broth or water to wilt the cabbage.

Very yummy!! I followed the recipe plus I added a half of a bell green pepper sliced thinly. I always make it boiled with smoke turkey wings. Wanted to try this one based of the reviews. Very satisfied.

All I have to say is WOW was this SALTY!!! I added a raw potato and it took out most of the salt. That aside WOW IT WAS GOOD!!!! I have an extremely picky husband and he liked it. I added a little white wine right before I added the cabbage and some cayenne pepper...just a hint. I will make this again with less salt :) thank you Kathi for sharing this.

Loved this recipe! I was looking for something different to take to Thanksgiving that had ingredients my family would enjoy, and this was a BIG hit.  I did drain off about half the fat and also added the bacon back in at the end, so it wouldn't get rubbery.  Can't praise this enough!  I have already had to promise to bring it every year.

I love this recipe! It was so yummy! It was so easy to make, very simple. I added a little Cayanne pepper because I love spicy foods. It was so good that I was requested to make it again the following weekend! We even had it as a main dish the second time!

Thanks for this simple and tasty recipe. I added a chopped red bell pepper and served it as a side with fried shrimp. Next time I might drain half the bacon fat from the pot before adding the veggies.

This was delicious,  I used sausage instead of bacon and added just a splash of chicken broth,  a half a head of cabbage was plenty,  and we have hardly any leftovers.  Making again for sure.

OMG!! This is the best!  Didn't add salt or pepper, I figured that is up to the individual eating it, we did add some smoked sausage and some garlic bread on the side.  My family loved it.  Thanks so much for sharing!  This recipes is already in my Recipe box!

This was an amazingly wasy recipe to make. As I had all my ingredients in the pot and was getting ready to add the spices I realized I didn't have the onion powder or the garlic powder....ooopps! So I improvised and used the Epicure onion three dip mix instead and it added great flavour.  Will use this recipe again and again. Have shared it a few times already :)

Finally! A recipe for cabbage that the whole family likes. :D  We have several "tender tongues", so in the future I will adjust the pepper down a bit for our tastes. Still, highly recommend this recipe.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I took the bacon out when it was crisp, chopped it, and added it back in for the last 10 minutes of simmer.  Next time I'll probably use only a teaspoon (or less) of salt, as the bacon adds plenty on its own.

I like salty foods, but holy cow, this was salty! It was an excellent dish, but I would only use 1 tsp. of salt next time (and there will definitely be a next time!).

I had a small cabbage so used just 2t salt & it was still quite salty.  Not unbearably salty, but that's the immediate thought after taking the first bite.  'Think this is one I'd for sure eat if someone else made it, but not make again myself.

Used a smaller head of cabbage so I did not use exact measurements but used all ingredients. Removed bacon prior to adding cabbage as suggested by other reviewers and returned to cabbage after turning off heat. Will add to the recipe rotation. Thanks for sharing!

I had some cabbage in the fridge and thought I would give this a try, found the recipe on pinterest. I used turkey bacon and did not add any additional salt, we loved it! The only thing I didn't do was add the bacon back in with the cabbage while it cooked, we like our bacon crispy and this dish definitely needed an addition of some sort of crunchy texture. We added chicken sausage to make it a meal, thinking next time I will use tofu for an Asian inspired dish. Good job!

I love this recipe!! I used the bacon ends I had in the freezer and it worked very well. The salt is apparently and issue. I used just a teaspoon of salt this time and would probably omit it all together next time. (I cannot believe the original recipe called for 3 Tablespoons!!) I will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  I used only 1 tsp of salt, though, and added 1/2 tsp of thyme.  I then followed the rest of the recipe completely, and it tasted fantastic!  Thank you for the recipe!

This did not taste as good as I remembered it as a kid. Maybe it's because I used turkey bacon instead of real bacon. Next time I'll try it with real bacon.

This has become a side-dish we use a couple of times a month.  We're on a special diet that is low-carb but fat is okay, so we're eating yummy food AND losing weight!  I will sometimes make a double batch if we have people over or want lots of yummy leftovers.  I always thought I hated cabbage until eating it this way.  We have a supplier up here called Cash & Carry where we get 5lb bags of shredded red cabbage to making it couldn't be easier (unless I could get pre-sliced sweet onions from the same place).  I usually beef up the garlic considerably, and we always add a pinch or two of fennel seeds to make the cabbage a little less gassy.  Thanks again - fantastic recipe and I'm a fussy cook and fussy eater!

I love this recipe! I make this all the time but had never added bacon to it. I used real bacon bits since I refuse to spatter my kitchen with grease, it was delicious! I cooked the bacon bits with olive oil and the onion, fresh garlic and some chopped cilantro, I added the cabbage, which I cheated on and bought a big 3 pound bag of shredded cole slaw mix from Sam's, this way it's much more colorful and saves me some work, seasoned it to taste and tossed it with some whole wheat pasta. Voila, dinner!

Super salty but I kind of like that.  I found it to be a little addicting once you got started eating, that I just kept coming back to pick at more.  I'm not so sure the salt taste and content would work well for other's tastebuds, but mine really liked it!

It was better than I thought.  I used red cabbage, no garlic (didn't have any), omitted the salt, onion powder, and garlic powder and used a 1/2 tsp of onion salt and garlic salt.

The warning should have been in Caps and highlighted.  This is fabulous.  Don't usually cook cabbage unless it's tossed into soup. But a neighbor gave me head that she accidentally bought.  I am so glad I came across this recipe.  Everyone loves it.  Its barely gone and I want a little bit more.  Thanks

Took the ingredients over to my Mom's house and the 2 of us had a good time making this dish, I deviated a bit, using more bacon, only 1 clove of garlic and I made a batch of egg noodles to cook into it.  Was really good and aroma persisted through the next day so it was very pleasing.  Thanks!

We really enjoyed this cabbage! I had an opened package of bacon and a half bag of coleslaw mix in the fridge to use and decided to give this a try. I was pleasantly surprised with the great flavor this had. I had to kind of eyeball the ingredients because of the amount of coleslaw I had, but I think I did a pretty good job. This was very tasty and I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This turned out very good. I used a large head of cabbage and used the leftover amount for egg roll filling, these turned out great also.

For a more robust taste add red pepper flakes about a 1/2 teaspoon. Other than that I followed the recipe. **If pork is a problem substitue the bacon with a cup of beef or chicken broth and 1/2 stick of butter.***

This is really good...BUT only use 1 TBSP of salt.  I don't mind things salty but 3 TBSP's is overkill. I did add cayenne pepper to spice it up a little.  Good job, Mrs. Smith

We thought the dish turned out too greasy/oily.  I think that adding vegetable oil is unnecessary and I would also decrease the amount of bacon fat rendered before adding the vegetables.

I did not use the bacon grease in mine (fried it up the day before) so I could fry in my cast iron skillet in advocado oil for a healthier version. Added an apple, tumeric curcumin, and a couple pinches of Stevia pwdr.  Next time I'm adding a handful of raisens for just a bit of sweetness.  A Tbsp of vinegar couldn't hurt either.  This recipe is a good one for altering with whatever you like for vegs and seasonings. I will be making it again soon.

I didn't really measure the seasonings and didn't have garlic powder so used some garlic salt. I sliced a package of Kielbasa and added it when I turned it down and covered to simmer. I served it over mashed potatoes. We liked it but won't make it  very often.

This was a really tasty side dish. Only thing I did was add some cayenne pepper. I like things a little spicier. Followed the recipe other than that and I will definitely make it again.

I have made this recipe exactly as stated at least five times in the last couple of months… I literally woke up this morning rolled over and looked at my husband and said “I can’t wait to make that cabbage dish today”. My husband responded “And I love you too”. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Fabulous! I could eat this all day (in fact, I did.)  Main thing to remember is a long, slow cook. If you saute it (slowly) the cabbage will taste sweet and the onion will melt in your mouth.  To make this faster - precook some bacon (saving your fat in a jar in the fridge). Use 2 T of fat to saute the onion and garlic, throw in your chopped bacon and cabbage. and spices...and cover it. Stir every few minutes at first and then let it saute slowly. Delish!

I eliminated the bacon and just started with the onions and garlic in olive oil.  I added crushed red pepper and eliminated the black pepper.  I used a couple of tablespoons of chicken broth ( can use vegetarian substitute or water when I added the cabbage as it needed some liquid to replace  the bacon fat. Very tasty!

Fabulous recipe!  HOWEVER, I add more garlic and I braise for much longer, maybe an hour on low heat.  The cabbage is not meant to be crispy, folks.  It should be somewhere between al dente and tender.  Maybe I sliced the cabbage too large, who knows.  served leftovers the next day aside Dave's Georgia black eyed peas, from this site. Delicious comfort food!

Delicious!  I used prosciutto rather than bacon since I had a bunch on hand. I also sauteed some sliced Eckrich Smoked Sausage in the bacon fat before sauteing the onion, etc. I like extra pepper. You can add cooked noodles as well for a really hearty meal.

I have made this recipe and at the end I throw in a 1 pound of cooked pasta. Mix it up and done. Enjoy  My family loves cabbage made this way and used to eat it with cooked rice but the pasta works beautifully.

This is the only way I cook cabbage. The only difference is in addition to the onion and garlic, I also add some sweet red peppers. I also will add a little sugar to the seasonings. It was something my mother used to do. Just a little no.t enough to make it sweet, but enough to enhance the flavor

Great recipe!  I followed directions but next time, I'd cut the black pepper by half...a bit too spicy for kids.  Also, I added noodles which made a great casserole.  Delicious!!

My husband loved it.  I actually think I got the cabbage texture cooked right.  I’ll defiantly be making it n the future often.
flavors well blended.

It’s absolutely delicious! I did make some changes - I added a diced apple, cumin, red wine vinegar, and white pepper. I sautéed it until it was nice and wilt-y. Flavorful and filling

I had some leftover napa cabbage added it as well.  The texture contrast was wonderful.  The kids screamed yummy yummy in my tummy.  Thank you, for the wonderful recipe.

I was disappointed because it was more steamed and soft than fried but it was tasty. I have a mind to do it again only this time I will not place the lid over it and will simply continue to fry and stir.

Alas I forgot the garlic. But this had wonderful flavor. The only reason it is not 5 stars is because I wanted to double the bacon. It needed more, for my taste. Thanks for the yummy low-cal recipe (as long as I don't double the bacon).

This is almost identical to the way I've always cooked it. I use different seasonings. I use Tony's herbs and more seasoning a lot of times. It can also be made in the instant pot. Manual time for about 8 min with natural release.

Loved this recipe.   My husband and I made it as our meal and the only 2 changes we made were  modest.   Used a yellow onion and tube squeezed garlic.    I will use a bigger pan next time as a large head of cabbage will initially not go into a standard size roasting pan and this dish feels like you are eating cabbage.   We had plenty of leftovers for an additonal meal.   This is my kind of recipe.

I made this recipe to use up the extra cabbage I had after making cabbage rolls. I found that there wasn't enough liquid to cook the cabbage and so added so diced tomatoes (with liquid) to help with this problem. It seemed to work out quite well.

Delicious and just a hint of bacon to make it taste yummy to anyone who typically will not eat cabbage.  I did it with napa cabbage and it was so very easy and quick!  Entire family loved it!

As with all of my dishes I made some adjustments. I added abit more garlic, and in a separate pot cooked a small pork tenderloin, cut into one inch bits then incorporated it into the dish. I will make this dish again and again.

Made this last night and might make it again, but with the following changes: less bacon and much less alt. I had a huge head of cabbage and followed the recipe exactly, but it turned out waaaayyy too salty. And I like salt.  It also had too much of the bacon flavor making it difficult to appreciate the taste of the cabbage.

Love it.  I loaded it up with extra bacon, and added one cup of corn and a chopped-up potato.  Cook them together with the onion.    Corn and cabbage are a great combination.

I don' eat bacon so I substituted finely chopped (diced) salami, rendered out the fat and added about 1 tsp of olive oil. Then, proceeded with the recipe. I threw in 1/2 tsp of fennel seeds because I like the flavor. It was enjoyed by all.

Yum! I made this for later this week, but we can't stop eating it. I followed the recipe, but my paprika is smoked. Amazing.

Fabulous recipe! I put probably the equivalent of 2 onions. Also, I am a salt lover....a huge salt lover...and I have to say that, even with a giant cabbage, 1 teaspoon of salt was more than enough. Better to add more if needed than mess it up.

Delicious. I kinda smothered mine after I fried it. I like a lot of liquid with mine. I either add cornbread to soak it up or brown rice. I also used fresh garlic, herb de Provence just cuz I had it & cuz cabbage is a southern thing. I use this as a main, so I add about a lb of bacon. I just use my kitchen shears & roughly cut it up & fry it up in my big Dutch oven then toss in the chp onion, then the chp garlic then the roughly chopped up cabbage & let it fry on med high, careful not to burn bottom. I let it cook down for about 15min while stirring. Then I add chicken broth till the cabbage is covered & let it simmer a good couple hours on low. Gotta be mindful of the add’l bacon & chicken broth re salt & I add a squirt of 100% pure maple syrup & a splash of apple cider vinegar as well. Sometimes you have to keep adding tiny amounts back & forth of the sugar/acid combo but well worth it in the end. Real good flavor esp with the bacon. Ok. There’s my two bits on fried then smothered cabbage

I would recommend leaving the salt out and if desired, put some soy sauce on the dish to taste at the time it is consumed. This will impart more flavor, and will not over-salt the food.

I've made this twice. I only give it four stars until the instructions are fixed. As an ameature cook, I followed the instruction for 1 TABLESPOON of salt. If you watch the video you hear them say much less. I should have known but I was a dumby and did a tablespoon anyways. Ruined the dish the first time. The second time I did much less and it was great.

I have a someone who will only eat turkey or chicken, so I used turkey bacon. I think that was why this was just ok. Thinking if I had used real bacon the flavors would have been better. I did substitute in "peppered bacon" flavored olive oil from Olivelle to try and more closely mimic the flavor of real bacon. It gotten eaten, but no rave reviews. Not sure if I would ever make it again...but there are plenty of leftovers. So, if those are tastier, possibly.

I liked it but thought it a bit greasy.  I will drain off most of the bacon grease next time.  I will put the sausage in with bacon, onions and the garlic!  I will make it again.

Delicious! Definitely use a large enough pot to accommodate the volume of the cabbage before it cooks down. The only thing I changed was I used garlic powder instead of cloves of fresh garlic. This is now a part of my regular recipe repertoire.

Looked for something healthier than using potatoes and I legit found the perfect recipe. I do add worcestshire sauce and Texas pete hot sauce because that is what I do when I make it with potatoes and I love spicy food. Awesome!! No complaints here.

Better than average, but it still needs something to give it that fifth star.

If want to stretch this and make it a meal, add some boiled and buttered egg noodles. Now you made Polish/Slovak haluski.

Great side dish. I have been wanting to add cabbage to my diet more often than St. Patrick’s Day. With one head two of us got left overs twice. Love this one and so does my body.

I made this today and it was delicious!  I had to use the real bacon bits as my husband ate all of the bacon.  I still had the bacon fat so I added the real bacon bits I had on hand at the end.  I sautéed the onions in the bacon fat., added the cabbage, salt, pepper, garlic powder and minced garlic to it and cooked over medium heat.  Added the real bacon bits at the end and it was delicious.  This was the first time I tried fried cabbage and it was so good.  Even my husband who is not a fan of cabbage loved it! So glad I saw your recipe! Thank you!

This was really good.  Just finished eating my third big bowl.  Mom liked it to and wants more later.
I did add 3 more strips of bacon, I DID NOT drain any of the grease.  That's where my fav flavor is.  I did add about 2 TBSP of butter at the end.  I probably cooked it long that you did but yes, it was so YUM!
Great way to kill a head of cabbage.

This dish is pretty tastey but I’ve only made it once and I followed the recipe but based on the reviews I removed half of the bacon grease and halved the amount of salt the recipe asks for. After tasting it I wish I removed more of the bacon grease. 1/2 tbsp of salt was the right amount. The one thing that I would say that isn’t mentioned in the reviews was that the recipe calls for too much black pepper. It comes out super peppery. If I cook it again I’d half that amount as well.

This is my favorite cabbage dish.  Everyone I cook it for raves over it and asks for the  recipe!  To save prep time I usually will use frozen chopped onions and I cut my cabbage the night before.  The first time I was nervous that it would mess with the flavor but it didn't.  You won't go wrong trying this one!

I went straight by the recipe the first time. Excellent! Second time I added a bell pepper only because I had it. Added a couple splashes of Tabasco and a good shake of pepper flakes. Oh, a splash of cider vinegar and pinch of salt.

I made the Fried Cabbage with Bacon, Onion and Garlic
I used a whole pound of bacon; used minced garlic and my favorite seasoning.
After it was done I added a little cheese and melted in the microwave. I then added pork rinds. Much better.
I don't  care for cabbage but this way I ate it.

This was a nice accompaniment to Polish Keilbasa. I do believe that adding the extra dried seasonings was a stroke of genius for the punch of flavor.  That much sweating cabbage could really dilute the flavor otherwise, imho.  I didn't simmer a whole 30 minutes at the end because I didn't want it cooked down that much.  In the future I might try it with caraway in place of the Paprika...maybe in addition to...who knows? Thanks!

This was so easy, and delicious. I didn't have any sliced bacon, so I used the 'real' bacon bits and cooked them in butter until crisp. I increased all the spices a bit and added some diced jalapenos for a bit of a kick. I didn't need the full 30 minutes of cooking after everything was added, but it could be because I halved the recipe. I loved it!

Loved this! Only thing I added was roasted cherry tomatoes. Delicious. I did drain some of the bacon fat. Also - I used a 1/4 tsp of salt.

Very good recipe! I made this for myself and my wife and we both loved it. Only changes I made were to take out the garlic (I'm allergic) and add sliced 2 carrots at the same time as the onions. This goes into my permanent file.

Love this recipe!  My only change is to use pre-cooked *real* bacon bits which I sauté with cooking spray. Other than that follow to a T (oh, except more garlic. Can never have too much garlic)

This is such a GREAT tasty and easy side dish.   I don't use a stock pot, just do it all in a frying pan.   I do remove half the bacon grease and season more to make it a little bit healthier.   The bacon grease does give it a great flavor though.  Is a staple in our household.

I used left over ham from a spiral ham in place of the bacon. I didn’t add salt because the ham was salty enough. I also didn’t have the garlic or onion powder but it still turned out good. I did use everything else in the recipe. Since I wasn’t sure how it was going to turn out I used 1/2 a head of cabbage. Overall it was perfect for two and we enjoyed it.

While it was cooking, I thought it needed a little something more, so I added some Lawry's season salt, and 1/2 stick of butter, and continued to cook a little longer than instructed.  It tasted very good. Actually it tasted even better the next day.
12-23-19...this time I added 1/2 lb wide noodles. Delicious.

This is a 10 star recipe!  I want to give a big Thank You to a few of the reviewers suggestions, which I used. First, to the one for adding a stalk of celery to the cooking cabbage to cut back on the odour. IT WORKS! You could still smell it cooking, but it cut back on the odour A LOT!  The celery really made a big difference, just remove it at the end. Great little trick!  Secondly, for the suggestion of substituting chkn. broth for the water for even better flavour. (I also tried the idea of adding a chkn boullion packet, which I preferred.) I too added 1 TB of brown sugar to cut the pungent taste  and didn't add the bacon back in until the end. I just can't stop eating it and have made it 3 times in the past week, giving away some samples, with raving comments and requests for the recipe. This is OMG good!  :-)

I have been making something similar for many years but never had it written down, so this was helpful.  A variation that I normally use is half the cabbage and add 2 cups of cooked egg noodles to the mix.  I also halved the amount of onions, but that is personal preference (my family doesn't like too much onions).  Very good as written and can easily take some small tweaks.

I'm cooking for 2 so only made 1/2 recipe.  The times were way too long for just I/2.  Everything was caramelized. Other than not being to appealing, flavor was not too bad.

We really enjoyed this with corned beef. I used about 8 slices of bacon with only half of a large cabbage and left the drippings in the pan. An easy side dish that I would definately make again.

Loved this recipe--made as is (with 2 extra bacon slices!).  Delicious.  Made with Braised Corned Beef Brisket on the Allrecipes site. 
Thank you!

I made this to go with some pork tenderloin schnitzel patties and it was perfect!  My husband doesn't like pork very much but he thought it was really good with the cabbage.  I made it according to the recipe.  No changes.  I will be making it again and it will be going into my next cookbook.  Thanks!

This stuff is going to be having a weekly visit to our house  for a while.  Love, love love it.   We are using pork jowl bacon, rather than the standard bacon that is suggested.

I made this in hopes of replicating the Hofbrauhaus fried cabbage. I followed the recipe exactly and it was too salty, just not the taste I was looking for. I added 1 - 2 tbsp of sugar, I wasn't measuring, just adding a little at a time and tasting. I also added about 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and about 1/4 cup of German beer. The finished product was so good. I will definitely make it again.

Our family loves this recipe! I've made a similar one without the garlic & spices, and substituting soy sauce, for years. (I've found that the younger I started our kids on cabbage meals, the more they've liked them) This recipe is a great, refreshing change. I made it as written, but added a little more paprika, using the smoked variety (amazing flavor!). We will repeat this recipe!

I love this recipe.  I've fried cabbage like this for years and the family simply devours it.  The only change I generally do is add a 1/2 tsp sugar and 1/2 C chicken broth.

Surprisingly, my husband loved this! He had never had fried cabbage before, but he will again! We were given a giant cabbage by a neighbor (nearly 15 pounds), so I had to find ways to use it. I had some cooked bacon, so I sauted that with some olive oil and onion until the onion was limp and slightly brown, then added the cabbage and spices. Next time I plan to add just a bit of sugar to the onion before I add the cabbage just to get more carmelization on the onion.

Loved this edition of cabbage and bacon!  I have other recipes for this combo  that I think I'll throw out after this one.  I didn't change anything except for the paprika--for some reason, I just couldn't find it in my spice cabinet, so I put the same amount of Cajun seasoning in as a substitute and it actually enhanced the flavors!

Actually I did this a little differently. I had some smoked sausage I needed to use. It was so darn good in this, I'm about to make another batch! With buttery, smashed new potatoes on the side.

Excellent keto recipe. Modifications I made, was adding a generous amount coconut oil to the pan before cooking the bacon. Also added turmeric and used Himalayan pink salt instead of table salt. Only 1 tsp at that. Came out perfect.

The only way to eat cabbage in my house from now on, according to the 6 critics I feed daily! Easy, no exotic ingredients, just down home deliciousness. Bacon and garlic makes a poor man's veg into something special.

Wow!!!  This recipe was FANTASTIC!!!  Everyone who ate some of this dish immediately after the first bite gave it a “thumbs up.”  I made.  This is a simple, quick and just an all around excellent dish that can be completely done in a short time frame.

Zero. This dish is complete garbage. What a disappointment. I'm a southern child and this dish did not deliver. This Editor is probably from the north. And I threw my taste into it?! Jesus... good luck.

My friends and I have been making a similar recipe for years. Throw in a few sliced potatoes and a chopped link of smoked sausage for even more flavor and more hearty meal.

I went lighter on the salt, but other than that, followed the recipe and served it with mashed potatoes.  It's wonderful as it is, but I think I'll skim off a bit of the fat next time to make it a little more guilt-free.  So simple, yet so good.  Thank you for sharing.

Just the way I make it, except that I add a sliced apple to the mix just before the cabbage. This prevents any bitterness that the cabbage might bring in.

I made this dish last night exactly as posted. The grease was not too much for my family.  My boyfriend said that this was probably part of the best dinner I have ever made for him. Needless to say it will be a hit in my house.

I  will definitely make this again and again. I added an extra slice of bacon which was definitely not necessary.  I reduced the amount of salt by a half, and found it salty enough that in the future, I will not add salt, but let the bacon flavor carry through. I had the leftover portion the next day reheated and topped with a poached egg. I certainly will do that again! Scrumptious :):):)

Easy and tasty.  I left out the onion powder because I didn't have any, and increased paprika to 1 tsp. because 1/4 just doesn't make sense.

Drained the bacon grease and while bacon was being blotted on paper towels I cooked the onions and garlic.  Found that I didn't need to cook the cabbage nearly as long as the directions called for.   Threw in a pinch of sugar.  This is a fantastic dish!  Husband loved it, had 2nds.  And we have leftovers for the weekend.    Will be making this regularly, and certainly on future St. Pat's Days!

Delicious. But can you ever go wrong with Bacon onion and garlic?  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and didn't add the paprika because I didn't have any on hand.   Thanks for sharing.

This was very good, and easy to make. I did drain off most of the bacon fat, as someone else had mentioned, and then added a generous pat of Irish butter at the end, because it brings out the sweetness of the cabbage. I also deglazed the pan with a splash of apple cider vinegar after sauteing the onion and garlic, to release all those lovely brown bits from the bottom of the pan, and to add a bit of apple freshness, which goes really well with cabbage. Will make this a few times per month, for sure :-)

It was very good but I would use more bacon next time.  Followed the recipe pretty close, sprinkled red pepper flakes on it  and added smoked sausage to make it a one dish meal.

While I love garlic, it was a little too much for my 94 year old father.  If I make it for him again, I will cut the garlic in half.  But if I make it just for me, I will double the garlic!

This is fabulous!  My husband has never been a big fan of cabbage in the past, except in soups, but when he tasted this, he said "this is the only way to eat cabbage!"  He loved it!  The only change I made was to greatly reduce the salt.  Can't imagine anyone liking that much salt.  Keeper!

I made this recipe twice.  The first time I made it exactly as written and it was very good.  The next time I made it, I added 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar and 1 tbsp brown sugar (we like a little sweetness sometimes and we love balsamic vinegar). I also added a shredded carrot for color.

I've been making this same dish (w/less salt) for years.  My Hungarian grandma used to make it when I was young.  There's nothing better than eastern european comfort food! Highly recommended!

I have made this a couple of times and I absolutely love it! The only thing I did was to add more bacon because I like bacon, but other than that I made it as written. In my opinion, it is perfect!

Tasty way to make cabbage.  I only used about 1/2 tsp salt and it was enough.  Next time will try to drain off some of the bacon fat.  It didn't taste too greasy though..just thought it would be healthier.

This was easy, quick, yummy, and all with a low calorie count even with bacon! Even my husband loved it. The first time I made it as verbatim. Next time I am going to drain at least part of the bacon grease. Even though the dish was not greasy, I thought it might be, I really don't need all that bacon grease in my diet. We're trying to lose weight and this recipe is absolutely going into our favorites! Thank you!

This was very tasty, and has gone into regular rotation in our menu.  I used Lawry's seasoned salt, and quite a bit less, and sliced the onion instead of dicing it because it was prettier.  This was a perfect companion to our New Year's Day hoppin' John (I cooked the bacon, used the fat for this, and put the bacon pieces in with the blackeyed peas).  Leftovers were excellent with a little dab of leftover pot roast and noodles a few days later for an easy work lunch. 

Little tip: the cooking time could be wildly different depending on how thick you slice the cabbage.  Slice it super thin, and it cooks much faster and doesn't usually require any extra covered simmering time unless you want it really soft.  I have also made it with a mixture of butter and olive oil when I was cooking for someone who doesn't do pork, and while it had a different flavor profile, the result was just as awesome.

Public Service Announcement: If you look at a recipe, and you think to yourself, "that's too much salt," but you make it anyway with the full amount of recommended salt, and you don't like it, that's on you. [/rant]

I had some cabbage and bacon I had to use up, so I found this recipe. I also had some mushrooms that needed to be used up so I also added it, I put a lot less salt ( I put a half teas.), since I think a tablespoon is to much.  It was delicious! We had some leftover for the next day so I added egg noodles with it and that was also very good!

This dish was fine, but I would definitely make improvements. I used only 1/2 tablespoon of salt and even that was too much. I think I'd drain some of the bacon fat to make it less...greasy. My husband enjoyed it, but he over salts everything. I'll make this again with the modifications.

I had half a head of cabbage and some  bacon I wanted to use up, so was excited to see this recipe. I halved the recipe (just two of us) and it was pretty good. Husband thought it was salty (only used a 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I thought it was a little greasy. I will adjust for both the next time I make this. Overall, tasty and easy.

It takes far longer than 10 minutes to caramelize onions, young lady. More like an hour + if done properly. Did you mean sweat the onion? I caramelized mine.... ZOMG. was this delicious. Yet, if you have a technique where I can caramelize onions in 10 minutes...please let me know.

Thank you for sharing this great recipe!  It was so tasty and everyone raved about it.  One question.  Do you have green onions or parsley sprinkled on the top of it or did I just miss that?

I served it on a bed of pasta noodles and it tasted all the more better.  A excellent way to use cooked cabbage leftover from making corned beef and cabbage the night before.  Also would go well with some smoked polish sausage.  Very easy to make a tastes great.

This was very good.  I made a vegetarian version with veggie bacon and 2 tbsp olive oil.  I only used 1 tsp of salt.  I think 1 tbsp would have been way too much.

My picky 7 year old daughter loved this. My 9 year old son said this can be added to the "make more often" and my husband really liked it.

Trifecta!! That doesn't happen much.
Thanks

I have made this by accident when making my adaptation of halushki. It calls for lots of butter and egg noodles and is delicious, but i decided to put bacon in it and use the bacon fat instead of butter. I also add shredded carrots with the onion and I add the cooked noodles with the cabbage and cook until the noodles start getting a little bit brown around the edges. Sometimes I forget the noodles... imo cabbage and bacon were made for each other! yum!

this is just delish.  i didn't change much but i swear it would be good with a sprinkle of vinegar in there.  but i made the recipe as stated except a little less salt as my bacon was salty and  also it did not need nearly 30 minutes to cook.   other than salt and cook time, no changes.  i can't stop eating it. I'm making a meal out of it. i also think that it would fine without bacon even though its yummy with it.  thanks for a great recipe.

Yum!  I used precooked bacon since I had some and coconut oil instead of the bacon grease.  I used much less salt  and didn't cook it the last 30 minutes (I like it a little crunchy).  Addicting!

This was really tasty. I think I just prefer just S&P on my cabbage. This was still really good though and I normally cook it the same way but just add a splash of water while I'm cooking the cabbage. UPDATE: I keep coming back to this method :) ( sans my splash of water)  and love it. Sometimes I do the onion and garlic, sometimes I don't. Never bothered with the paprika.  It's good either way. But the bacon, S&P is a must ????Will always prepare this way :)

Excellent recipe. Fast and easy to make and the flavors comes through ... even better the next day. I used savoy cabbage and white cabbage, and I didn't change a thing in the recipe. It's a keeper!  I took the advice of one other member and used leftovers for a Asian inspired roll. Thank you!

My cabbage was pre-cooked (I cook up a head for recipes & store in tin foil and a tupper wear dish) and I made it for 1 person, so I scaled it down - but YUM!  simple to make and delicious!  Keep those recipes coming!

I  would DEFINITELY make this again, and wish I had made more to begin with,  instead of cutting reipe in 1/4 (I was only msking for myself).  I almost always change ingredients,  but I wouldn't change any in this recipe (except to cut the salt WAY down).  The blend of flavors was perfect!  But after making this as directed, I WOULD change the cooking instructions a bit, which is why only 4 stars (would have given 4.5 but it didn't let me.)  First I would remove the bacon and drain some of the bacon grease before caramelizing onion.  And I would not add minced garlic until the onion was almost done ( garlic is quick to overcook and doesn't taste very good when it does).  Then I would add the bacon back in and continue to follow the rest of the directions.  Definitely will share this with friends and family!

Delicious!  Definitely a new staple in my home.  The only thing I changed was the salt content, but I always salt & pepper to taste, unless I'm baking, I always add to taste.  I really like cabbage anyway, but this recipe was a winner!!  No leftovers, so I'll have to make more this weekend.  Thank you for a truly tasty recipe.

I wanted to make a one-pot cabbage dinner, so I used this recipe as my starting point.  I fried the bacon and then lightly browned slices of kielbasa in the bacon fat, then removed them both to a platter.  After that I followed the recipe pretty much as is, but cutting down on the bacon grease.  When the cabbage was close to finished, I tossed the meat back in, and added some tiny cherry tomatoes from the garden, just long enough to warm them up.  It was a delicious meal, and the meat still had all its flavor.  Will be making this again.

This was surprisingly good. Simple to put together.  I removed bacon after it was crispy and added back at the end.  Our paprika had a nice little kick which also was nice.  Will make this again.

Used leftover cooked cabbage which I chopped. Added onion and garlic and seasonings. Sautéed in a little olive oil and butter. Added bacon bits. Delicious! Will make again.

Made it yesterday, but twigged it a little. I added a few things, smoked paprica, some whole black peppercorns, thyme and a few potatoes. Let the pot simmer for 45 minutes and the result was fabulous. Thank you for sharing!

I thought this was delicious. We made it as a side dish but I added it to our main dish last night which was just a simple hamburger and egg noodles. It was fantastic mixed together.
Next time we make this, I think I will add a splash of apple cider vinegar or white wine. I think this would be tasty with a little acidity.

This was great! I only used about half a teaspoon of salt as the bacon add enough on it's own. I added some cooked macaroni to the pot, cut up some lettuce wedges and cucumber to go along side and it was a satisfying meal. Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you so much for this recipe 
I fried the bacon until crisp, then I took it out of the pot and set aside
I cooked  the cabbage with the rest of ingredients ( in the Bacon grease) in the same pot according to recipe

When the cabbage reaches the consistency you like
Stir in the Bacon and Cilantro and turn off heat
**  remember  not  to overstir
DELICIOUS!!

What a great recipe.  Four ingredients and some spices render a delicious meal.  I used two teaspoons of salt instead of a tablespoon and 1/4 tsp of paprika.

It had very good flavor. If I make it again, I will cut down on the salt. It was way too salty with the bacon and other spices.

I followed the recipe and added a little Apple Cider Vinegar, 2 Tbsp.s Brown Sugar and Bay leaves while it was cooking.  Very good and will make it again.  Thank you.

It annoys me when folks give "5 stars" but change the recipe. I'm giving 5 stars...and I changed the recipe!!! Per a strict diet, I'm not allowed bacon. Since cabbage is encouraged, I found this recipe through an ingredient search. I used ground turkey sausage instead of the bacon.  I have 5 kids, 3 of them had seconds and I polished off the leftovers 3 hours later. De -lish! Hubby said, surprised cabbage could taste so good!  My nurse practitioner was thrilled to be given this recipe (with the meat modifications) to use! So, you see, I had to give it 5 stars. LOL!

I enjoyed making this!  I am Haitian American so this was totally stepping out of the box of what is normal for us but because I wanted a recipe to cook left over cabbage I gave this a try and don't regret it.  Haitians don't really  measure. But I did 6 slices of bacon, drained most of the oil; maybe did 1/2 cup diced onion or less, 1 garlic clove, and 1/4 cabbage and seasoned what was listed to taste.

It is a really great recipe! I just added a little Italian seasoning to jazz it up a little, but I am sure it would have worked as good without it!

A good-sense recipe that delivers everything it should! I varied the spices (herbes de provence, ghee, and even a wrist-jerk of Penzey's fantastic curry), but the core of this baby is excellent, and a great springboard to even more fantabulousness.

I would drain more bacon fat out and re-add bacon in at the end to keep it crispy. Very nice flavour as it's the first I've ever had of something like this!

This was easy and tasted great! I followed the recipe exactly as is, but didn't simmer for 30 minutes. Maybe 15 at the most. It was perfect just the way it was! Highly recommend this one, and it's great the next day as well. My neighbor loved this too and asked for the recipe.

I think it is very rude to rate a recipe if you don't follow the exact directions. Sad that people do this and then make negative comments. No cred in my book. Great recipe, loved it.

I use to make this dish years ago and I forgot about it. When I made it this time I only did half a recipe because I thought my husband would not like it. He decided to taste it and really liked it so of course I wished I had done the whole recipe. It was just as good as I remembered. Thanks Kathi Smith for posting it.

Delicious! I had to make do with a small cabbage, so I downsized the bacon to 5 slices and the garlic to one clove, but kept the seasonings at full measure. I'll definitely make it again - maybe cooking the bacon slightly less and chopping the cabbage slightly finer than I did. Thanks for the recipe!

Using medium high heat for so long tends to over brown or even burn. It doesn't take 10 minutes to carmalize onion anyway. I added a little olive oil since it simmered for so long.

Love cabbage, onions, garlic, and of course, bacon. When I saw this I had to make it. Loved it so much I make it at least once a week. I have a thing for sour foods so I threw in some apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup or so, during the cooking of the cabbage and that was a big winner too.

Oh my word!  I'm from the deep South and I've been eating fried cabbage forever - they probably stuffed some in my baby bottle!  But I've never had cabbage this good. I'm having to restrain myself from eating the whole pot full. ..Straight out of the pot.  Only change was decreasing serving size.  Used half head of cabbage, etc.  I will never fix cabbage any other way.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this with a package of coleslaw from grocer - used sweet onion and made no other substitutes.  Cooks in about 20 minutes and prep time is minimal.  
Thanks so much for this recipe!

Excellent!  Add egg noodles to this and you have a nice hearty meal.  I've even made this with turkey bacon, just need to add a little butter when caramelizing the onions.

Needed lots more salt and pepper and garlic than recipe calls for.  Husband loved it.  I thought it was very good.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for, no changes or additions. Very good. I love cabbage and am constantly on the lookout for a new recipe. When I found this it was getting close to dinner time so I left it on my computer and made the recipe. I already had all the ingredients having just picked up two large heads of cabbage at the store last night. I've got two grandchildren with me for a week and I served it to them. It disappeared from their plates before the rest of their food and both wanted more. I've added the recipe to my book of recipes and will share it with my adult children. also cabbage fanatics.

This is the most AMAZING side dish I have ever found. The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly. I made it for Easter dinner and it actually went quicker than the ham did! The second time I made it I noticed it looked a little dry after the cabbage went in and was kind of stalling a bit, so I added a little of my husband's beer to get some steam going. Let me tell you, from now on I'm adding that ingredient every time, dry or not. It worked perfectly and my husband ate 4 helpings himself. Now being a Maryland family we used Natty Bo but I'm betting any beer you drink regularly would work. I added maybe a 1/4 cup though I did it by eye so use your best judgement.

Super tasty. I used seasoned salt instead of spices and used a little pork broth to tender the cabbage quickly.  I've never made anything like this, but will make again.

The only thing different I did was not add paprika and that is only because I didn't have any. Contemplated adding crushed red pepper flakes or sriracha and next time I may because I love spicy, but this was fan-tab-u-lous!

This is absolutely delicious and perfect for a low-carb lifestyle. I omitted all onions (including onion powder), and it was great! Tons of flavor and a little kick to it. I will make this over and over again.

Very good. Probably go with ½tbs salt. I processed the onions and garlic, but I would probably slice the onions into longer pieces next time. I don't think it requires the 30 minutes of simmering since I like the cabbage to be a bit firmer.

I liked it enough that I'll make it again, but probably will drain at least half the bacon grease. Don't get me wrong, it's super tasty as is, but I can't help but think about all that fat. XD

1  tablespoon of salt is way to much for us. I think 1/2  tsp would be fine, then adjust according to taste.

My neighbor introduced me to this recipe.  The only difference was the additions of the garlic and the amount of salt.  Personally I am all about seasoning food! The bacon is a layer of flavor that is cooked into the dish through the flavor of its oil.  I don't think pouring some of the oil out and adding some olive oil to it will harm anything.

This was very good as the recipe is written.  Next time I make it, though, I will eliminate the onion and garlic powder as I felt those flavors overwhelmed the cabbage.  One caution I would like to add, do not overcook this dish, the cabbage gets a bit mushy if left on the heat.

Left out the salt so that people could salt their own and I put it in a 400 oven for a half hour instead of the stove.  Yummy!! I used ham chunks instead of bacon the second time, still good! I cut the cooking time by microwaving the cabbage till soft, then frying it over high heat in some bacon grease and butter till it begins to brown and then I put it in the oven for 20 minutes to roast and caramelize.  Fabulous!

I have made this recipe 3 times now, it's the first time I've ever gotten cabbage into my husband!  This is tasty; I cook the bacon first and make sure I get rid of most of the bacon grease so with little bacon this is fairly healthy.  We eat it as a side or a main dish!

This was very good.  I did make one change by halving the amount of salt. Next time, I will omit the salt completely. Other family members  thought it  a bit too salty, but I rarely use much salt when cooking.  This recipe has been added to my favorites, and plan on making it again soon.

Made this last St. Patricks Day- as a side item to go with our home made Reuben sandwiches. It was AWESOME! My Husband isn't a big cabbage eater, but this he said was a keeper! I followed the recipe as it was and only added a 1.5 Tablespoon of balsamic vinaigrette near the end and gave it a good stir. Loooove it :)

Made this but used thick bacon. To much bacon. Next time I make this I plan  on using less bacon and onion. I also will not cook it quite as long. We prefer the taste of cabbage and have it be a bit crunchy

Darn good side dish!!! My wife made a couple of minor changes: The recipe seems to call for doing the frying in the bacon grease, so since we're both, to some degree, on cardiac/cholesterol restrictions, she cooked the bacon, drained off as much of the grease as she could, and did the rest of the frying in grapeseed oil. Also substituted turmeric for the paprika. Oh, yeah, almost forgot, we used a peppered bacon for this, so it might have been more peppery than some people would like, but we both thought it was extremely tasty; we will be making this again.

This recipe was pretty good.  The changes I made were cut up Italian sausages instead of bacon as I thought it would be less fat.  I was able to use half of a cabbage i had left from a previous meal.  I cut down on the salt, and added small red potatoes. This was a main meal! Very good!

Loved it. Added some crushed red peppers and a dash of cayenne to spice it up a bit since I like spicy food. Great with brown rice and/or chicken sausages.

Agree with other reviews.  Removed a lot of bacon fat before frying cabbage.  Put fried bacon and onions aside and add back during last 3 minutes of frying.  
Delish!  Will make again.

My family has made fried cabbage for many years.  In addition to the many ways you show, try putting some cooked, wide noodles in and you will have a meal that really sticks to your bones - that's the way my German ancestors made it.

I really liked this when it was fresh out of the frying pan. However, I saved most of it for dinner the next day and the flavor was a little bland. I'll probably make it again !

Wow, this is the best fried cabbage I've ever had.  So much flavor.  I removed the bacon after rendering the fat.  Once I had tried everything, I added a couple of tbs of water and then put a lid on it and let it steam until the water was gone.

This was excellent and easy to make! I used 2 Tbl spoons of already minced garlic and 5 slices of bacon and 2 Tbl spoons of Hormel real bacon bits. My guests loved it!

Love this recipe!  Followed it to a tee with the exception of only using 2 tsp. Salt.  The rest of my household are not cabbage fans.  I won't mind if they don't like it...more for me!  Thank you for sharing!

I would have LOVED to given this 5 stars, but 1 tablespoon salt is way too much, we could hardly eat it. That being said, I am making it again tonight (sans salt) because it really does come together so nicely and has perfect ingredients otherwise.

I would have rated this a 5 but, I used 1 T of salt like the recipe calls for and it is way too salty.  When I make it again I will start out with 1 teaspoon instead.

As easy as chopping up cabbage. So tasty. I hope I think of it and make again. Feeds about 10 or so, so you'll have enough for leftovers! Taste just as good the second day.

Easy to make and delicious. I rarely think of cabbage as a side dish except for corned beef, but this was wonderful and tasty. I made it to go with baked ham and potatoes and everyone loved it. Cabbage is no longer just for coleslaw and st. Patties day. We will make this more often. Thanks for a great recipe.

Because  I wanted a main dish from this recipe, I added Creole /garlic powder seasoned cubed chicken when the onions and garlic were done, sautéed for a minute and added the cabbage.  For my husband , who is sensitive to too much salt I only used 1 tsp. and subbed onion flakes for the powder (didn't have any).  Added 1 tsp. baking soda to mitigate gastrointestinal distress that can sometimes happen with cabbage dishes.  Otherwise followed this recipe.  Husband says it's a keeper, except he doesn't like black pepper much and suggested using only half a tsp.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was yummy!  I had some left over chicken so tossed it in to make this a main dish.  So good!  The chicken stayed nice and moist and the flavor so blended well.  Will make this again!

Really great EXCEPT for the cook time!  It actually tasted really great after sautéing the cabbage for 10 minutes.  I covered and cooked on low for just 10 minutes, half the time suggested.  It turned to watery mush!  I'd love to make it again, but I will only sautée until I like the texture, covering made it way over cooked.

Perfect fried cabbage. I would recommend reducing the amount of salt to about a teaspoon rather than a whole tablespoon. I cooked this in a cast iron dutch oven on the stove top. I added a tablespoon of bacon grease that I had saved to the dutch oven before frying the bacon. Oh, I also increased the amount of paprika to 1/2 tsp. I like a little more spice.

I did not add all the salt but after trying it I had to apply more.  Thought I should be a little cautious since I felt my cabbage was not as large as it should be.  My husband and I loved it and decided it needs to be added to our rotation of favorites.  I am sending this to my friends and family!

Get the nutrition from that cabbage in a delicious way.  I accidentally made a change, by grabbing the hot pepper instead of the paprika jar (they're both the same color), so it was a bit hot for my taste. But even so, the great taste came through. I would suggest, though, that you don't think "caramelized" in regard to the onions. Onions take about 45 minutes to caramelize. I think the recipe meant "translucent".

This hit the spot! My Mom always made cabbage and noodles.  My favorite comfort dish!  Now that I need to be on a grain free diet, I can still enjoy Mom's comfort dish, with out the noodles. Definetly decrease the salt. The bacon adds saltiness as it is. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is my most absolute favorite dish. I have tried other recipies from differt sites but this fried cabbage dish is amazing. I prepared it just as the recipie instructed and fool proof prefection every time. I have it atleast once or twice a month now and love the smells that fill my kitchen when it cooks. Thanks for bringing this awesome dish from your kitchen to mine.  Tammie W. Las Vegas

1) Loved the flavours. Used Caraway instead of Paprika and threw in some leftover rice  & Shrimp.  Delicious.

2) Used Chorizo sausage in place of bacon and added a diced tomato and precooked rice so it made lazy cabbage rolls.

This is great, after all, it does have bacon in it.  I did alter a bit just by adding Kielbasa to it so I could have a one dish meal.

I made this pretty much according to recipe. I did add a few tablespoons of chicken stock during  the last 30 minutes because it just seemed to be the right thing to do. It turned out really good! Might try a dash of hot sauce next time because that's how I roll.  Thanks!

Haven't made this yet but will be soon. This is very similer to our perogi filling recipe except without all the garlic ,onion powder and bacon. But adding bacon sounds like a good addition. I def agree carlmelizing the onions is the key for it to come out right.Have mixed this in with egg noodles too! This is good stuff! Can't wait to make now lol

Way to much salt. If you make this cut down or out the salt. Most bacon is salty so you don't need more besides you can always add it at the table.

I made one change and that was to cut the salt to one and one-half teaspoons because ba on has salt. That was perfect for us. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  We will definitely have this again.

The only change I made was I cut the amount of bacon used in half because we had thick sliced bacon.  I changed nothing else and it was terrific.  I will continue to use this dish.

A good cabbage recipe, but you can cut out some or most of the bacon and the grease.  I used a small amount of olive oil instead of bacon and then sprinkled real bacon pieces on later.

Funny, I've made fried sautéed cabbage once before. Tonight I'm making it a second time, so I figured I'd look for some pointers to possibly improve my dish. This recipe is about what I had in mind, but I figured the bacon would be salty enough and I'm skipping the onion powder. I used bacon bits and olive oil instead of cooking the bacon. I read a review that said a shredded carrot would give it come color - great idea! The low carb nature of this dish is very much a benefit.

I enjoyed the dish very much. However, I could have used more cabbage than what's required as the richness of the seasonings was somewhat overpowering.  Or perhaps the cabbage from my garden isn't as big as what is bought at the grocery store.

Made as recipe stated and, for the most part, pretty tasty. Fry over a medium temp as the mixture tends to burn before the cabbage finishes. I would go lighter on the salt as well as it was a little too much for my taste since the bacon already has plenty.  A quick and easy meal with few ingredients, if that is what you are looking for.

My husband loves this.  It was good to me but I'm not heavy on eating bacon grease but love bacon:-) I'm sure I'll cook it again, even if its for him. I may try to reduce the grease next time.

I followed the recipe exactly, using both fresh and powdered garlic and onion. Okay, I may or may not have used a couple extra strips of bacon. Delicious! It perfectly complemented pork chops.

I made this without any changes other than starting out with less salt and then adding more to taste at the end of cooking. It is pretty heavy-handed with the black pepper, but we enjoyed the slight spicy-ness that it added. I honestly did not expect hubby to even taste it, but to my surprise, he ate quite a bit and really liked it. He even told me to add it to my recipe box to make again. Both of my grown sons also loved it. I noticed that one son added some cayenne to his and the other used a splash of vinegar.  The bacon is an absolute must. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Polska kielbasa instead of bacon. 
Added 1/4 stick of butter. 
Cut back salt big time. 
Should cut everything in half, except sausage,  for a reasonable size meal

This is such a delicious dish! I bought the cabbage pre sliced from trader joes and didn't cook it for as long as 30 minutes just until it was tender. One of my new favorite dishes!

I made this per the recipe and my husband and I loved it. I served it as a side dish for dinner The only bad thing was that it was too salty. Next time I will leave out the salt and add a couple of small potatoes when cooking the onion and garlic.

This is great! We made it twice within a few days. It is a new family favorite. We made it once with red cabbage and chicken breast and once with green cabbage and pork loin. The pork loin turned out the better of the two.

We have made this more than a dozen times now, each time trying something a little different. We have tried beef, pork, chicken, and sausage. Without a doubt using pork loin cut into bite-sized pieces is the absolute best! We watch our salt intake due to health reasons - to all the reviewers who said there was too much salt - please...just don't put so much in it. We barely sprinkle a half-teaspoon over the cabbage. We also add carrots and potatoes; once we added cauliflower and broccoli.

This is a GREAT 5-star PLUS recipe that you can change to suit your taste but the base recipe is excellent.

I made this in my electric pressure cooker. I used the brown function for the first part and the slow cooker function with the glass lid for the second part. I love cabbage and this  tastes and smelled so good. I used a smokey paprika and a blend of spices  instead of those in the recipe.

This was delicious!! I will absolutely make this dish again. Thank you so much for posting! I made it as a side for beef goulash but I think it would go well with any beef or pork dish. I used half the amount of salt called for and only cooked up 4 pieces of bacon in the pot (I had two pieces of bacon already cooked from earlier in the day). But then I added a little olive oil so that all of the cabbage was coated. I think using 6 pieces of bacon would have been fine and will do that next time.

Used Pancetta in place of the bacon.  Taste was okay, but not a world rocker.   Flavors were mild, and it was very good for us.

Very tasty dish; I added no salt  and drained most of the bacon grease for a healthier diet and added 3 stalks of chopped celery for a little more crunch.
I have lightly sprinkled fennel seed over the top and covered for a few minutes, before stirring in and serving for another variation as well.

Was so good, as I expected it to be.  While the bacon, onions and garlic were cooking I tossed the cut up cabbage in a splash of apple cider vinegar, a dash of hot sauce and a sprinkle of sugar.  I cooked the cabbage a little longer until all excess liquid had absorbed/evaporated.  Even though I made steak and roasted potatoes with it, the cabbage was cleaned from our plates before we touched anything else.

This was incredibly good. I served it topped with corned beef, not necessary, but a good addition. My husband was working upstairs and said it smelled like the best thing I have ever cooked. After 40+ years of him loving my cooking, I thought that was a pretty good compliment. I cooked a half recipe, since it is just the two of us and we always have leftovers. Not tonight!

Yum yum yum!  Didn't have bacon so I used real bacon bits. I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil and butter then I added the bacon bits and cabbage. Sprinkled a little smoked paprika on and a little red pepper flakes and boom it was amazing!!

Everyone thinks its really good. I mostly cook the bacon in a large pan for the drippings, then crisp it on paper towels in the microwave and crumble. I toss cooked egg noodles with a  pat of butter and add to the cabbage and onions. Stir in the bacon and viola!

This was a great dish, and a definite keeper.   I only used some season salt and pepper to taste and not the garlic and onion powder, or paprika.  I also I only cooked it for an additional 15 not the 30.  I turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed recipe amounts ... tasty, but a bit too much pepper for me.  Tonight, I mixed the leftovers into mashed potatoes  and made a casserole with some grated Swiss cheese on top.  Delicious - dulled the pepper a bit.  Next time:  less pepper.

Wow, a keeper for sure! I kept to the basic recipe with the exception of adding sliced 3 Portobello mushrooms and a cup of diced red bell pepper. Next time I'll add a little more garlic and onions & the powdered spices too especially paprika. Comfort Food with a capital"C"! I sipped a cup of Russian caravan tea which complemented this dish very, very well! European lagers or German ales would go with this too.

This is a great recipe, I have been making this for years without the bacon.  I make it with smoked sausage, and serve it over buttered garlic noodles.  This time I have done it with the bacon, and it gives it added flavor.  I only use a teaspoon of salt though.

We make one very similar to this one, but instead of bacon we use spicey ring polish bologna, cut into bite sized pieces.  It is a great summer/autumn dish when the cabbage is fresh and the greener, the better.  So many good vitamins etc. Kathy

I cut the salt by 1/3, and it was still too salty for my taste.  Other than that, I like it a lot.  I will further reduce the salt next time.

Way too much salt - I should have known better.  i think  one teaspoon would be enough.  Nice flavor - I added a couple sliced frozen bratwurst to make a one dish meal.

Lessons learned from this recipe: #1, BACON makes everything delicious. #2, the method and "bones" of this recipe are really good - seasonings, timing, etc., and lends itself well to using other veggies like I did (due to what I had on hand).  I did follow other reviewers' suggestions regarding draining the bacon a bit and a light hand with the salt.  I look forward to making this recipe with the listed ingredients soon.

I make cabbage this way.  I use onion powder instead of onions.  I also add fried kielbasa to it.  I keep bacon grease in the fridge so I usually don't have to fry bacon unless I just want to add it to it.  A great meal in under an hour.

I am from the Ukraine and we cook cabbage in a similar way. We call it cabbage stew not fried cabbage. We do not use garlic but I may try adding fresh one at the end of cooking the next time I make it. We also use shredded carrots for some color and it adds some sweetness to the dish. Another difference is - we use oil instead of grease. The addition of bacon, sausage or ham at the end is optional. In my country cabbage is served as a side dish complimenting fried pork or steak, or meatballs served with mashed potatoes. If you  would cook cabbage with oil - it is more suitable for majority of people, potlucks and family gatherings.  This dish can be served by itself too - it is so yummy together with freshly baked bread or not sweet dinner rolls. My American husband loves cabbage stew. He said not once that he dislikes cabbage dishes in general espesially cooked saurkrat that he tried in the past at the restaurants, so it is a surprise for himself that he loves cooked cabbage.

I am happy to see this recipe getting some attention.  My ancestors have been making this for generations.  The only exception is adding noodles once the cabbage has wilted down.  We make it with and without onions and always delicious.

This is an excellent recipe. I have made this for years, I alter this sometimes buy adding sautéed diced chicken, or pork.  Spice it up with some hot pepper flakes. Or maybe adding  diced green  pepper.  And serve over rice.

I've made this for years with a few changes. I drain off all but abut a tablespoon of bacon grease and I add either red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar depending on my mood or which I have on hand. I've never measured the vinegar....usually just drizzle or splash from the bottle about 3 times....I'm guessing it wouldn't be anymore than 3 or 4 tablespoons, but I tend to really enjoy foods with vinegar. After lightly stirring to coat the cabbage, I put a lid on it and steam it in the little bit of liquid....just enough to soften the cabbage a smidge  ( I like my cabbage with a bit of crunch). That's it! :)

I  made this once as is, but I love to tweak...I made it again but substituted Brussels sprouts. It was great both ways but I'm a huge Brussels sprouts fan.

I followed the recipe to the letter except for the salt. I do a lot of smoking and I have a pre-made shaker with a 50/50 mix of kosher salt and coarse black ground pepper. I only used a teaspoon of the combination. Since the cabbage head we had was very big it lacked flavor but that was not the original posters fault. We preferred it that way so we could season to individual taste. I use a specialty seasoning from my BBQ shop that is a veggie blend, Once I added that it was great.

Great recipe - very tasty --- I added a bit of vinegar probably a 3-4 tablespoons at the end just for a little kick - the family loved it

My boyfriend loves, loves, LOVES cabbage. Did I say he loves cabbage??? The only change we made was using turkey bacon. It was thick cut and only 12 slices in the package, so we used the whole thing. You can never get enough bacon, lol. I'd say only 10 slices made it into the dish, but it was great! I also switched up how the cabbage was cut (short thin slices, chunkier, thicker longer slices, etc) which gave different textures in the end product. I didn't want it to be even like cole slaw. I'm sure we well make it again.

Oh my Lord is this ever good. I followed the recipe exactly except for one thing: I had some chicken fat sitting around in the fridge, so I threw that in the mix. This dish is just amazing. 

Regarding the salt: a full tablespoon does appear a bit much, but it really helps the flavor mature during the simmering process. That said, start with a half tablespoon and see how it tastes to you after simmering.

Delicious! This photo doesn't do it justice! Was so tasty. Only used 1/4 cabbage, halved spices (except paprika because I love it), kept remaining ingredients as is. A new favourite cabbage dish! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is really good. I prefer to cook the cabbage a little less. Sometimes I trade the bacon for Keilbasa. Cook some egg noodles on the side and toss them in near the end and it makes this even more awesome. Very satisfying dish. Thank you.

I made this exactly as written.  The only thing Kathi forgot to mention is that the ingredients should be doubled, because I could have eaten the entire thing myself.  Almost resented having to share with my husband.  :)  Thanks so much for posting this delicious recipe.

Addictive is right!  I had forgotten how good this was. As written it's just fabulous, but I can't seem to leave recipes alone. I added 3 TB of apple cider vinegar and 3 TB sugar (splenda). Just gave it a touch of that sweet and sour taste. Yes, I will be making this often now that winter is here. Thanks so much for reminding me! P.S. being too lazy to keep cooking/stirring for 30 minutes, I steamed the cut up cabbage and then added it to the other  ingredients, and cooked for 5 minutes more.

This was good, but just not great. I poured off a couple tablespoons of bacon grease before adding the onion, and I still found it a bit too greasy. Also, the bacon was not crispy by the time the cabbage cooked, so I think maybe it would be best to remove it after it cooked and then add it back in at the end (saw another recipe for fried cabbage which did this...) - Also added a splash of vinegar at the end to cut the greasiness, which helped. Probably won't make it again as I am the only one in the house who likes cabbage, and it was fairly time consuming for just an OK dish.

Delicious! It was a little salty, but that was probably because my head of cabbage wasn't huge. But the family LOVED it and I will definatley make it again. Once it was done, I made little wells and cooked some eggs directly in it. An awesome cold night meal!

A family favorite that they ask for all the time. I use smoked paprika and double its amount - adds just a little bit more spice.

This was great...easy and flavorful!  Changed only 2 things.   I did drain off a little of the bacon grease.  #2..  I cooked up some Chorizo in cast iron and added that to the finished recipe.   It was even BETTER for leftovers!   Hubby loved it!  I'm going to cruise the garden for the last of the veggies and toss them in next time.

I guess my bacon wasn't fatty enough because I had to deglaze my pan with a splash of white wine! Plus I added a couple of Tbls of butter for moisture.  I skipped the onion and garlic powder and paprika and just went au natural with an extra clove of garlic and an extra large onion. 
All in all, this was delicious and I will definitely make it again and add it to my favorites! Thanks Kathi Smith!

YUMMY! Whatever you do, don't add a full Tbsp. of salt, it will ruin it!  I added  1/2 Tbsp  and it was on the verge of being too salty, next time I will add 1-2 Tsp.  

TIP: If you plan on serving it right away cook it for the entire recommended 30 min. If you plan on serving it 1 -2 hours after you cook it, cut down the  30 min to 15 min to preserve some of the colour. If you cook it for the entire 30 min  and  serve it  1 or 2 hours later  you'll end up with a pile of brown mush because the cabbage continues to cook  after you remove it from the heat source.

I don't use a lot of salt in my cooking so my taste buds are a bit sensitive to it (I know I'm not the only one!). 

I followed the recipe exactly. I felt the taste of this dish was a bit odd in that you absolutely MUST add salt to the cabbage (I omitted it at first and the dish was totally bland), but when you get bits of the chopped bacon in your forkful it makes for an absolutely overpowering salty taste. I followed the recipe and used six slices of bacon with a large head of cabbage, but found myself picking out the bacon as I ate. And I LOVE bacon!

The flavors were great, so NEXT time I will cook the bacon, REMOVE it, then crumble it to be added to the finished dish as desired.

So simple and delicious! My daughter swore she hated cabbage but loved this. However, WAY too much salt. I had to make it again and used 1/2 tbls. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. Well, I might make it with Kielbasa next time (in addition to 1/2 the bacon) ??

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!! This is now my favorite vegetable dish! The flavors are so rich and satisfying. I made the recipe as it was written. Yummy! I did put the amount of salt that I would want which was less than the given amount to my taste. This is going to be a weekly addition to dinner.

WAAAY too much salt! Even after the reduction from 3 Tbl to 1 Tbl, it's still too much. You don't need to add ANY salt to this dish. It's great without the salt! Just add some cooked noodles and you have Halushki, a traditional Slovak dish.

The wife and I love cabbage.  I added the garlic only AFTER the onions were translucent since I didn’t want to chance burning it. Also added a teaspoon of caraway seeds after the cabbage was stirred in. Caraway works well with green cabbage recipes. Got the idea from one of our favorites “Westphalian Cabbage”

This was VERY good! I love the smokiness from the bacon. This dish has a nice sweet/savory balance. I made it as written except I added some grated parmesan cheese and served this over egg noodles as a main dish. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch.

This turned out really good even though I'm not a huge fan of cabbage. My husband and 18-month-old son gobbled it up. I halved the salt, left out the onion powder (I didn't have any) and added half a pound of sliced mushrooms while I was sauteing the onions and garlic; when I make it again I'll try it with the onion powder and I might use a larger head of cabbage because it cooks down a ton. I served it with maple mashed sweet potatoes and a roast chicken made with smoked paprika and herbs. Delicious combination!

Pretty yummy and really easy to make.  Made it with red cabbage and added a commercially prepared balsamic syrup for a little zing, mixed it all with some farmer's sausage.

I've cook this dish several times for family and friends. Simple recipe to follow and you can't go wrong. I've also added red cabbage and or onions just give it a little more color.

Whats great about this recipe is that the cabbage is good whether it is made with bacon or with other meats.  I've made it with bacon, boneless chops, and Italian sausage so far. The sauteed onion, along with the herbs and spices add a flavor to the cabbage that is very good.

Delicious and reminds me of a dish my Polish grandmother used to make.  I do add chunks of potatoes along with the seasonings and it makes a complete meal.

We got cabbages in our CSA box and after making coleslaw I didn't know what to do with it.  This was great.  I didn't have onion or garlic powder, but I didn't think it needed it with actual garlic and onion in the recipe.  Went great with pork chops.
