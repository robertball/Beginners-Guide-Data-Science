This is a wonderful treat. When, I make this recipe, I make the following changes: add another cup of mashed bananas, use butter instead of margarine, use 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar instead of all white sugar, add 1 teas cinnamon and 1 teas nutmeg. I like to dust the greased baking pan with sugar and cinnamon. Before I put in the oven, I sprinkle the top with a crumbly mixture of 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2-3 tbsp flour, 1/2 teas cinnamon, 2 tbsp melted butter and 1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts. Yum!

I've made this recipe time and time again and always get excellent results!!  

-I always stick to margarine, even though I'm tempted to use butter!!
-I've been short on sour cream and added flavored yoghurt to make up for the lacking.  
-I add 3 bananas (medium-large size), but add a couple additional tablespoons flour to ensure it doesn't turn out soggy.  
-As a personal preference, I also add toasted chopped nuts (about 3/4 cup) at the end.  

For people who might be having issues with it getting too dark on top, here's my suggestions: Turn your oven to 375-400 and bake it for 5-7 minutes. (This ensures your bread gets a good "oven pop" from the heat.  The baking powder reacts with the heat, therefore this initial heat will help your bread rise and give it a good peak.)  After the 5 minutes, lower your oven to 350 and cook the rest of the way.  If your bread starts to darken on top, but is still gooey inside, simply place a piece of foil on top and continue to bake as normal. Do not wrap the bread in the foil, simply lay it flat on top.  

Just remember all ovens are different, therefore a bit of trial & error will help solve certain issues and hopefully teach you things in the process! :)

I've made this recipe several times and have varied it each time to see what kind of different results I could get.  Here's what I've learned:  First, grease (don't flour) a 9x13...second, increase the amount of bananas to about 3 ripe bananas and a HEAPING cup of sour cream...third, use brown sugar instead of white and fourth, don't allow to cool completely before placing in a Ziploc bag.  I usually cut the cake in half and freeze half while the other half sits in a sealed container on the counter.  It really retains its moisture when stored this way, however, you need to eat it rather quickly (like w/in 4 days..which is REALLY easy to do!)  This also makes a good "cake" if you mash half of the banana and leave half in chunks.  Then, sprinkle powdered sugar on top or frost w/ a cream cheese based frosting (or a tub of that flavored cream cheese)...it's a hit!  3 Years Later...I'm still being asked to make this bread, but I've made several modifications since my first attempt in 2006.  Here are my favorites. I use wheat flour now...it's just a healthier choice.  I use light sour cream now.  I add a handful of golden raisins to the mix as well as about 1/2 cup of sliced almonds (if I'm feeling really creative, I brown them first).  Lastly, in an effort to get more fiber into my diet, I add about 4 tbsp. of Fibersure or Benefiber to the mix.

This recipe is really great! I made some changes to make it even better. I substituted the sour cream with non-fat plain yogurt, the margarine with applesauce and 1 1/3 cup white sugar with 1 cup brown sugar. After mixing everything, I cut in chunks of banana to make it even more banana-y. It came out so moist and chewy.

I have tried a lot of banana bread recipes and this is the best yet. I cut back to only 1 cup of sugar and added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. Very moist and disappears fast!!

Very good banana bread Cathy.  I had bought a huge batch of bananas from Costco and very seldom do we get through them all before they start to turn brown.  I mashed up 2 large bananas (a little over a cup) and used vanilla flavored yogurt instead of sour cream. I also threw in a teaspoon of cinnamon to give a little added flavor. I baked them in 2 loaf pans and they came out beautifully.  I wish I would have added some chopped walnuts, but didn't think of it at the time. Might try that next time.  The picture of this bread is beautiful...thanks for sharing.

Really really good! I've never made banana bread before - not from scratch anyways. I used 3 bananas and had only 3/4 cup of sour cream (just barely enough, it was all I had!). I baked it in a dark 9x13 inch pan and after 35 minutes I checked it and it was done.  Very yummy.  The second time I made it, I used 2 loaf pans and it came out even better than the first time! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I've cut down the sugar content to 1 cup and it is still very sweet cause I used very ripe bananas.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe, no doubt about it! One thing, be sure to MIX the flour into the banana/sour cream with a SPOON! And only stir until the flour is mixed in. Don't overdue it!  If you don't you will have tough bread if mixed with the electric mixer. This tip holds true for all quick breads....I found after 52 years of baking.

I've tried several banana bread recipes including "Banana Banana Bread" from this website, and this one was the best!  Very moist, right amount of sweetness, and almost gone in one day!

This recipe was VERY EASY TO MAKE and TASTED AWESOME!  I baked it the first time in a 13x9 pan and it tasted great but it seemed a little strange to have banana bread cut into a square opposed to slicing from a loaf pan shape.  NOTE:  When you use the 13x9 inch pan, it only takes about 30-35 minutes.  When you use the loaf pan, it takes around 1 hour to cook so you might want to keep that in mind if you're in a time crunch.  THIS BREAD IS A DEFINITE MUST FOR YOU TO MAKE!

Excellent recipe for classic banana bread!  It's definitely moist and delicious - which is what you'd expect from banana bread.  I cut the sugar back to one cup and used half white and half brown.  I also subbed fat free greek yogurt for the sour cream and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I baked it in a 9x5 glass baking dish at 350 for 50 minutes and topped it with a bit of turbinado sugar for some a little added "crunch".  Perfect served warm with butter!

Ok, I've never made Banana Bread or any other kind of bread for that matter.  This was the easiest  thing I've ever made!  Not to mention, wonderful!  My husband loved it and so did I.  I took other's advice and used brown sugar instead of white, 2 cups of mashed bananas, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp  nutmeg.  It was absolutely the perfect combination. I also added a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. I cooked it in a greased (only) 9X13 inch pan, but it only took 35 minutes to cook at 350.  Since ovens can vary, I would advise monitoring it closely after 30 minutes so it doesn't burn.  I just can't believe that I made it!  Thanks so much for the advice.

This is a great recipe. Truly the best banana bread I've ever had. Very moist. Some breads I've had have been very dry, not this one. Tip: make sure you use very ripe bananas, make sure skins are dark not spotted. I used four. I also made a caramel glaze that I got from another recipe here. ( 6 table spoons of butter, 6 table spoons of brown sugar and 1 teaspoon if vanilla extract. Melt butter over medium heat, add sugar and vanilla. Stir till sugar disolves and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Let cool for 5-10 minutes and pour over bread. YUM!!!!! Thank you for a great recipe......

This is seriously delicious! I did make some adjustments...I added a splash of almond extract to the batter & then baked in a bundt pan. I then made an amaretto glaze. Hello! Delicious. When you're done baking, poke holes in the bottom of the cake with a toothpick. Boil 1/2 cup of amaretto for 1 min. (if you want it kid friendly) Otherwise, just combined 1/2 cup amaretto with 1 cup powdered sugar, another splash of almond extract & 3 T milk. Whisk it together & then strain the any sugar chunks. Poor half of it on the cake. Let it sit for 20 mins, dump the cake out, poke holes on the top & then poor the rest of the glaze over the cake/bread. It's sooooo yummy & can certainly be served as a desert.

Yummy! Good classic banana bread recipe. I made just a few changes to suit my own tastes. I used 2/3 c. brown sugar in place of white sugar and also used 1 c. whole wheat flour in place of white flour. I've made this bread both ways and it comes out equally good no matter which way I do it. I also poured my batter into in four mini loaf pans rather than large ones. I find that that they cook more evenly and faster this way as opposed to using larger pans. I also have an oven than runs a little high so it's easier for me to burn the outside of things and still not have the inside fully cooked. I also always wrap foil over the top of my bread after it's cooled for about 10 minutes and leave it like that overnight to retain moisture. Then I'll place the bread in a plastic freezer bag.  It will stay very moist until the end.

10/18/06....I made this recipe again this morning and it works really well for making muffins, too.  One recipe will make about two dozen muffins, and it cuts the cooking time down considerably.  I always lower the temp. by about 25 degrees just to be safe.  I was also able to top the muffins with different things like chocolate chips, walnuts, and granola as I took these to work and everyone there likes different things in their bread.  Wrap each muffin in saran wrap to retain the most moisture.  On, and I didn't have sour cream on hand this time but used Dannon's natural vanilla yogurt and still had wonderful results.

Without a doubt the most wonderful banana bread I have ever tasted!  MOIST, MOIST, MOIST!!  I usually use three dark bananas, which is probably more than the one cup called for.  To make it easy on myself (and ensure that I make it often), I make the batter entirely in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  I just peel those bananas and throw them in the mixing bowl, turn the mixer on low, then one by one add all the other ingredients in order.  Even the dry ones just get "dumped" in, with the mixer constantly going.  Pour that batter into a loaf pan and pop it in the oven, and you have something your family will RAVE about.  Now I can whip up a loaf of banana bread with only about ten minutes of work.  This will be a family tradition for years to come...thanks Cathy!!!!

I guess I'll add my 0.02--this was very good banana bread (and I don't even particularly like banana bread!).  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  Definitely better for you, but I missed the tang that sour cream would have given it.  Also, I used more bananas.  A very nice bread--moist, not overly sweet.

I've been trying different banana bread recipes.  Trying to find a really good one.  I think this is the one!  My husband said it's the best ever!!  Made it exactly the way the recipe says except that I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon. I did sprinkle some Pamp Chef "sweet cinnamon sprinkle" on top. I used 2 regular loaf pans and it was ready at about 35-40 mins.

My husband's comment.... Oh my!  I agree.  This is the best banana bread I've made to date.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to use butter instead of margarine and I added some cinnamon and nutmeg as suggested by others. I used a 9 x 13 inch pan and baked it for 45 minutes and it came out perfect - moist and not at all dry.  I'll definitely be making this again!

An excellent recipe, a little more like a cake in texture than traditional banana bread. The recipe filled my bundt pan nearly to the top but came out great, I did need to cook a little longer than specified to ensure the middle was cooked through. It freezes wonderfully too! Definitely a keeper!

I made this twice, turned out perfectly the second time around. Used these recommendations/changes: 4 bananas, 1 cup of brown sugar, 1 cup light sour cream, 1 tsp cinnamon, handful plus of walnuts, melted margarine for 10 seconds in microwave before mixing with brown sugar; everything else as instructed. Then, cooked at 400 first 5 minutes, followed by 350 for 45 minutes. About half an hour into it, lightly placed piece of foil on top. Didnt use a bundt cake pan b/c I didnt have one. But tasted great! Thanks for the awesome recipe, my first time attempting to bake this instead of store bought - much better!

This was amazing! I made a few changes though. I used 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of margarine and used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. It was fabulous and lower in fat. My picky little sister ate it and loved it as did my mom and good friend. I will be making this recipe again!!!

I halved the recipe, used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of bananas and it came out like a banana pudding bread. Very moist and tasty. Next time I will cut back on bananas and increase my whole grain flour in hopes having a bread-like texture. Overall it was great w/Fat Free Sour cream and worth the 140 calories.

I substituted 1/2 cup prune baby food for 1/2 of the butter, and it turned out great.  Try adding a struesel top before baking for an extra special treat: combine 1/2 cup sugar and 1T flour and 1T cinnamon, and cut in 1/2 stick of softened butter.  Sprinkle mixture on top of the bread batter. Super delicious!

This was delicious!!  I've never made banana bread before, and it turned out great.  I used fat-free sour cream, and subbed part of the white sugar with brown sugar.  I also added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  Thank you, Cathy!!  (I've eaten half a loaf already!)

The sour cream makes this bread extra special. I used butter in lieu of margarine and sprinkled in some cinnamon and cloves, but left the rest of the recipe unchanged. Super moist and delicious!

I made this into a banana cake, I did my pecan coffee cake recipe, instead of margarine  I used 1 cup butter, I cup mashed bananas. I also used 1cup walnuts, 1 tbsp. cinnamon, 2tbsp brown sugar and baked in the oven until a little crisp. Then made batter and put layers of creamed mixture and nut mixture.

Great way to use up sour cream and bananas. I think this recipe was lacking spices. So I added a dash of cinnamon and some cinnamon chips. I used half whole wheat flour for some nutrition, and cooked these in a mini muffin tin. Super cute, and a nice snack. Thanks for sharing.

Loved it. Substituted butter for the margarine and cut the sugar down to one cup. I may cut the sugar again next time because it was still plenty sweet.

I've made this a couple of times and the first time, I made it to the specifications and it came out really great. The 2nd time, I added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and reduced the sour cream slightly. It was even more moist but I had to increase the bake time a tiny bit. Overall, love this recipe!

I've been looking for a great banana bread recipe and have tried many - some were too dry, some too moist in the middle. This was PERFECT! I had 4 ripe bananas so I doubled the recipe and made two loaves. Added about 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips and it was delicious, this will be me 'keeper' recipe :)

I used 3 large bananas (as other reviewers suggested), and slightly less sour cream because I didn't have quite enough. I also used brown sugar instead of white (again, per suggestion). My bread came out moist, delicious, and lovely. I cooked it in 4 mini-loaf pans for about 35 minutes, putting aluminum foil over the tops after 25 minutes.
Definitely staying in my recipe box and next time I have over-ripe bananas this is what's happening to them.

This is really delicious! To add some protein and reduce fat/calories I used Fage 0% plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I used real butter too and added more banana. It was perfect; super moist! I sprinkled some brown sugar on top which gave it a yummy crunch :) I used a loaf pan and baked it for the recommended 50 min. @ 350° but then increased the oven temp to 375° and baked another 15 min. b/c the middle was still runny. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you!

Finally! A fantastic banana bread recipe! I have made about a dozen banana bread recipes in the last year in search of a good one...this one was definitely the base for the perfect one...the sour cream does the trick. The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is because I changed a few things, but this makes a great start. I used butter, mostly brown sugar, added cinnamon, and topped with coconut, brown sugar and cinnamon. Seriously, my kitchen smelled so good while these were baking that I wanted to lick the oven door.

Only thing I add is 3/4 to 1 cup of chocolate chips. Yum-o! Also, suggested baking time (50 minutes) is not enough -- more like 1 hour and 15 minutes. Even if you overbake, still comes out very moist.  For vegans, replace the 2 eggs with 6 tablespoons of flaxseed meal (available at Trader Joe's) mixed with 2 tablespoons of water. Tastes just as good; no difference.

I finally found the perfect banan bread recipe. This bread is dense and creamy instead of cakey and dry. It has a good amount of banana flavor as well.  And most impressive, is that when the baking time is up, it is done perfecly~ no gooey unbaked middle. I would have liked walnuts added but then again, if i did that, the kids wouldnt eat it. (more for me?) Thanks for sharing.

I finally found the best banana bread recipe ever!!!! This was so easy, and turned out perfectly!  I used some of the recommendations from other members like using mostly brown sugar instead of white, I used 5 bananas, 3 smashed and 2 chunked, and made a crumb topping with brown sugar, flour, butter and cinnamon (recommended by another member) and I think that really makes this bread awesome.  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the flour mix. I greased the pan and then dusted it with white sugar and cinnamon.  Thank you for this great recipe and great tips too!

I have now made it low fat by replacing the margarine with no sugar added applesauce plus 1T. veg. oil and we thought it was even better this way!

I'm with the majority of those who enjoyed both the ease and the great taste of this banana bread. It is very light. I used a bundt pan and otherwise followed the given directions. This sure won't last long. P.S. It makes your kitchen smell wonderful. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a great recipe. I followed directions except for the sugar.I exchanged a 1/3 of a cup of white sugar for brown sugar. Baked in a bundt pan for 50 mins. Excellent texture, flavor, and color. A definite keeper!

Very moist! I used butter instead of margarine and two bananas (which were equal to 1 cup mashed). Delicious!

Everyone was right - I FINALLY found a MOIST banana bread recipe!!! It's gotta be the sour cream! I also took some of the reviewers' advice and I put in 2 1/3 cups bananas instead of the 1 cup this called for. And here's a spin -- I added about a cup of combined peanut butter chips and chocolate chunks! Remember being younger and putting peanut butter on your bananas?! YUM! It was delicious!! Thanks Cathy!

I've tried numerous banana bread recipes and this is by far the best that I've had.  It is moist and just the right amount of sweetness to it.  Perfect with my morning coffee.  My family loves it and I sometimes add walnuts to one loaf for us adults and the other loaf without for the kids -- there is never any leftovers.  Thanks Cathy!

NOT your average banana bread.  I added nuts and an extra banana to make it to my liking.  It is moist and delicious and more like a cake than a bread.  Will use it for special occasions.

I've gone through three different banana bread recipes, and this is the one I'm going to stick with. I thought the sour cream was an odd ingredient, but the bread turned out very moist and tasty. This one's a winner!

This is a great banana bread recipe.  I did make several changes to the recipe. I did not have ripened bananas, which I have found is key to a great banana bread.  So I ripened my own by preheating oven to 300, placing 2 bananas on foil 3-5 inches apart and baking for about 40 minutes or until very black.  Let cool, I mashed with a fork, but they were very stringy so I threw in my food processor to smoothen up.   I replaced vanilla extract with 1.5 tsp imitation banana extract, added a couple shakes of cinnamon to the mix, greased and sprinkled the bottom of the pans with cinnamon & sugar, as well as the tops of the bread, I also added finely chopped walnuts.    I used four 3x5 foil pans.  Baked at 350 for 35-40 minutes.

Excellente! Perfecto!
I will try substituting sour cream for plain non-fat yogurt next time. As suggested by other members, I used 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar, and also added 1 tsp. nutmeg and 1 tsp. cinnamon. I dusted the greased pan w/ cinnamon-white sugar mixture, and topped it with a streusel as suggested by another member (combine 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 TBSP flour, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 2 TBSP melted butter) and topped with walnuts. Baked 1 hour at 350. Perfecto!

I don't usually make so many changes in a recipe --But I wanted to make a really healthy muffin to use in my Daughter's lunchbox because she does not eat sandwiches.  So -- I used only 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 white flour, applesauce instead of margarine and made them into muffins some regular and some mini.  They were so good she and her friend loved them!!

This is the BEST banana bread recipe! Every time I make it for people they love it and ask for the recipe (after taking huge slices of the bread). One thing: I never measure the bananas, I just use 4 medium, pretty ripe ones which give a great banana flavor. I've add sliced hazelnuts, chocolate chips, pecans at different times and the results are ALWAYS a delicious, moist bread. THANK YOU CATHY!!!

I love this recipe!  The only change I made was to add an extra banana and that was only so I could use up all the bananas I had.  I also used 2/3 cup of sugar and 2/3 cup of packed brown sugar instead of using all white.  I will definitley make this again and again.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I didn't have the sour cream so I used vanilla yougurt.  I also used 1/2 brown sugar instead of all white sugar.  Then I made the crumble topping that a previous reviewer left.  EXCELLENT!  Everyone loved it!  Next time I will try sour cream.

This is the only banana bread recipe we use anymore!  If you are looking for a quick bread that will be on the drier side this will not be for you - but if you are looking for a wonderfully moist banana bread recipe - you're going to LOVE this one!  Cathy - thanks a million!

This bread has a great moist texture and tastes delicious. The combination of sour cream and bananas is perfect. It's also a great jumping-off point for your own personalized additions: walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, orange peel ... you can't go wrong! The recipe yielded 4 beautiful mini-loaves for me that were done in under 45 minutes. I recommend allowing your bread to cool slightly and then immediately wrap it up in plastic wrap to seal in moisture and taste. Delish :-)

Wow this was wonderful!  I knew it was good when my husband dissapeared into the kitchen and said, "Hey we're running low on this stuff!"  He meant the bread.  I accidently doubled the butter the first time, still turned out great...ha ha, why wouldn't it...mmm butter!  Even less healthy that way though.

I happened to have 2 bananas going bad, and sour cream I needed to use quickly.  OH MY GOODNESS!  Turned out to be the best I can ever make with ingredients I already had and the best banana bread I've ever baked and had.  I kept everything the same, except that I used 2 bananas (without measuring, used whatever sour cream I had (yogurt size minus 2 TSP) and put walnuts (lots of them).  It turned out to be the finest.  I baked it this morning and half of it is gone already!!!  Thank you!!!

Not one of the better recipes for banana bread..I have tried many recipes on this site and will continue to use " The Banana Sour Cream Bread" by far the BEST one on this site. This tastes more like banana cake without much flavor. Even with added nutmeg and cinnamon.

Very Disappointed!!  I honestly can't understand the rave reviews for this banana bread.  Maybe it is because I was looking for more of a traditional type banana bread.  I have been baking and cooking since I was 13 (28 years!!) and therefore know that it is not my culinary skills but just the recipe. I used five regular sized bananas as other reviewers felt it did not have enough of a banana taste.  They were right.  I also found it to be a bit bland and lacking in spice.  I modified the recipe as follows:  3/4 c. of Splenda/Brown sugar blend, 1/4 c. apple sauce instead of margarine and added one Tbsp of cinnamon.  As other reviewers have mentioned, I found the bread to be dense and that it did not rise well. I will definitely be going back to my old banana bread recipe.

Whenever I make banana bread, instead of greasing and flouring the pans, I grease them as normal, but I use a cinnamon and sugar mixture in place of the flour.  This gives it a sweet crust and it still doesn't stick to the pan.

I thought this recipe was great.  I also used less sour cream than called for and added a little more banana than called for.  Then I added some walnuts!  Very moist and yummy!

The texture was OK but it didn't have enough banana flavor. Perhaps reducing the amount of sour cream and increasing the number of bananas would help. I added some raisins and sprinkled a streusel topping. Will make again but adjustments are needed.

I have tried many variations of Banana Bread, but never had an addition of sour cream..it was incredible..the flavor was intense and the texture perfect, very moist!! The only things I changed to my personal preference is use real unsalted butter and cut the sugar back to 1 cup, which is plenty..also like someone else mentioned, I sprinkle cinnamon sugar in the pan before baking and it gives it a little something extra! I baked this Bread in a 13x9x2, it baked up very nice! 5 Stars!

I admit to playing with the recipe a bit; I just can't help myself! I used 1 cup of fat-free strawberry yogurt in place of the sour cream (didn't have any), 1/4 cup sweetened applesauce instead of the butter (to keep the bread low fat), cut the sugar down to a scant 3/4 cup (bananas were quite sweet, and because of the additional sugar in the applesauce) and replaced half the flour with quick oats. Baked up wonderfully in an hour. Keep in mind the texture is affected with my changes, making the loaf kind of rubber-y but after a day or two on the counter loosely covered it gets less so.

This will be my go-to for banana bread! I swapped out sour cream for plain non-fat yogurt, margarine for butter, white sugar for just 1 cup brown sugar, dusted greased pan w/ cinnamon-sugar mixture, and topped with a streusel as suggested by another member (1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 TBSP flour, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 2 TBSP melted butter). Baked 1 hour at 350, then 20 minutes at 300. Perfect every time! Thank you!

Love this, very moist bread. I doubled the recipe and added cinnamon and nutmeg. Simple ingredients, simple to make, simply delicious. Can't beat that. Kids loved it and it was great for taking to my son's school to share with class.

Great Banana Bread, the only change I made was I used vanilla yogurt (brown cow with cream on top) instead of the sour cream,my kids love this treat.

I really liked the banana bread; I just thought it needed a little bit more bananas. Other than that, it was delicious!

This Banana bread was delicious... I only wish that I had realized that by baking in 9 X 13 in dish would dramatically reduce the baking time.  I baked it too long and it was a little dry... Still it was delicious.  This recipe with the time revision is a keeper...

I only took away the fifth star because no adjustments were made for the use of 13x9 pan vs loaf pans.  I used the 13x9 and it was done in about 35 min.  Delicious recipe.  I mixed everything in one bowl (though it'd probably be better to at least separate wet/dry ingredients initially - I'm lazy), and it turned out great.  Yum.

I had some ripe bananas and have always wanted to make banana bread.  This recipe. Was so easy and delish!  This was a huge hit with my family and neighbors.  ( I sent them a couple slices).   It was gone with in hours.  The only change I made was that I added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  I made an extra loaf with a half cup of peacons since I didnt have walnuts.  That loaf was also gone! Will be making this recipe again.

LOVE IT! I doubled the recipe, used a total of 1 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of any white sugar, 6 mashed bananas and the loaves came out perfectly. I made them for an after dinner dessert, but it didn't make it to after dinner. We inhaled the first loaf right then and there! Perfect, thanks for sharing, we'll definitely make this again!

Simply the BEST banana bread I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the bread was so moist.  I used 3 med bananas and the flavor was outstanding.  This is the only recipe I will use in the future.  *UPDATE:   I need to tell you that this recipe is outstanding.  I actually used it to make pumpkin bread!!  I cut the sour cream to 1/2 cup and added a 16oz can of pumpkin in place of the banana.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cloves to the mix and followed the recipe directions.  It was the best, moist and tender pumpkin bread.  Thank you again for this recipe

Very moist.  I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the top for baking.  Went quickly with cries for another one but I don't have any bananas left!  Will make again very soon.

This was excellent bread.  I did however make a few changes.  I used 1C of cream cheese, 1/2 C butter (not margarine), 1C brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar, 1tsp cinnamon, 1tsp nutmeg.  I dusted the loaf pan with sugar and cinnamon as some other reviews has suggested and also put a crumb topping on before baking.  This was delicious bread.  I ended up with 4 small loaf pans of it and 1.5 are already gone :)  I baked it for about 45 min...I think, I lost track of time actually.

I added a little maple syrup and used butter instead of margarine, but the bread smelled so good I couldn't wait and tore off a chunk while  it was cooling. The taste didn't disappoint.

Very yummy! This mix also makes good muffins (I only had one loaf pan so I made muffins with the extra). But for muffins the baking time is only 20 minutes, so take them out well before your loaf if baking together.

I'm giving 4 of 5 because I revised a bit. It seemed like it would be a great base for banana nut spice bread because I love anything with sour cream. Since I'm living in China sour cream is rare and hard to find, but I had some soured yogurt that worked great. I added 3 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, upped the salt to 1/2 tsp. Since I cooked it as gifts for friends who only like "slightly sweet", I cut the sugar to 1 cup total, and did half brown sugar half white. It gives it a bit more rich brown color. I also added broken walnuts. To some of the batter I added peanut butter chips and butterscotch chips, just a small handful of each, for an occasional burst of new flavor. They turned out well, and not soggy or mushy..but just right. I think my friends will also enjoy them. Thanks for this great basic recipe.

Very good and moist bread. I made 4 mini loaves, 2 with chocolate chips, and 2 with cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on top. Both were good, but I am looking for a more dense bread. This is very light and springy, so if you like that then this is the bread for you. Used applesauce instead of oil and added cinnamon.

SUPER YUMMY!!  My husband and I loved this recipe.  It was so moist and flavorful.  I made this bread without measuring out 1 exact cup of mashed bananas.  I just used what I had on hand, which was 5 small/medium sized very ripe bananas.  I also added 1 tablespoon of dark rum and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the banana and sour cream mixture.  The recipe made enough batter for me to bake one large loaf of bread.  The bread cooked for 55 minutes in my oven and came out perfectly cooked.  The sour cream definitely made this bread taste like no other banana bread my husband or I have ever had.  I think the addition of dark rum helped as well.  This bread really came out delicious!  I will definitely be making this recipe again and again!!!

I just made this and it is very good,hubby and grown daughter loved it too! (2 small to medium mashed bananas equal about 1 cup by the way) I used real butter and sour cream, 1/2 tsp banana flavoring and 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and stirred in about 3/4 cup of chopped pecans. I sprayed a non-stick bundt pan with oil, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar in the pan up the sides etc. and then a little flour all over in the pan, poured in the batter and baked it at 350 degrees for 50 minutes let it cool 5 minutes and it came out fabulous!

I used 4 ripe bananas, vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream and a dash of nutmeg, also I cut back the sugar, using about 3/4 C. brown sugar and 1/4 C. sugar. Baked in a bundt pan for 50 minutes, turned out very moist and delicious.

I had some bananas that I really needed bake with and I never have found a good banana bread recipe so I try different ones on this site. I used this recipe and baked it in the bunt pan. It was FABULOUS! I have found a keeper! My family ate it within the day! No more left over banana bread. :)

I agree that the banana bread is very moist. (almost WET in consistency). I really didn't taste the sour cream, I think it just made the bread overly moist.  It also didn't rise as much as I would've liked it too.

This is the BEST banana bread ever!! I give it 5 stars becuase I have made it exactly as the recipe calls for, and over the years have made some changes to it, and its still awesome either way!!  If you want a sweeter more cake-like banana bread-stick to the recipe exactly. Its delish!  But if you want to make a healthier version, I've switched to whole wheat flour (it does not make it taste bad-despite what some other users have noted) reduce the sugar to 3/4c, increase to 3 ripe bananas, add 1/2c ground flax meal and use light sour cream. I dont feel guilty eating this for breakfast every day!
Thank you for the great recipe!!

Well, Cathy, you did well whoever you are!!  This was my first time to bake banana bread, and I am SO glad that I found this one.  My husband loves sour cream and bananas, so this was a great match.  I took other reviewers advice and used 1/3 cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar, added 1/2 cup walnuts, and baked it in a bundt pan.  It turned out beautifully...and delicious!

This is a really good recipe.  I almost always add more bananas to any banana bread recipe I find, and this was no exception.  I used 2 cups of bananas and it turned out well.  I wouldn't recommend making these in a muffin pan - I made some in mini loaf pans and filled one muffin tin, and the muffins were a bit on the dry side.  Stick to the loaf pan!

My family loves banana bread and I have been searching and experimenting for years to find "the one".  I think we may have found it with this recipe.  The bread was moist and had a wonderful flavor.  The only changes I made was to add more banana, added some walnuts and used low fat sour cream.  My husband asked me to go to the store for more bananas to make this again...it's only been two days.

This is a fabulous banana bread recipe and I make it often.  Since I prefer my banana bread very moist, I increase the bananas from 1 cup to 2 cups.  I also use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar instead of all white.  Every now and then I will add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of almond extract in addition to the vanilla.  Chopped nuts can be added as well - I usually add 1/2 cup.  It's always yummy and my neighbors are always asking if I have an extra loaf around for them.

Try substituting the sour cream with non-fat plain yogurt. You'll never know the difference- it retains the moisture and cuts the fat content way down!

I this alongside the "Banana Banana Bread" recipe.  Both were evenly good. This one developed a nice, crunchy crust.  I added Craisens to this version which was perfect because the bread itself was not as sweet.  I would definitely make this again!

I made mine in cupcake form.  For large cupcakes, bake 20-25 minutes; for small cupcakes, bake 12-16 minutes.  This makes it easier to pack into lunches and share at work.  Great flavor!

Wonderfully moist, great flavor! Nice "step-by-step" method so my 9-year old and I could put it together easily. If you're teaching a young person to bake, this is a great recipe to use because you have the opportunity to explain what "baking powder" does and mashing and mixing dry ingredients then wet, etc. A lot of fun with tasty results!

MMMMMMM....This was DELICIOUS!  Just what I had hoped for in my new banana bread recipe, but improved by using a cinnamon-sugar coated bundt pan.  Nice and dense.  No oil needed if you substitute applesauce for the margarine.  Nice presentation and fantastic taste.  Thanks, Cathy!!

I made this recipe yesterday for my family. It has replaced our favorite banana bread recipe. I made 2 changes to this recipe. I substituted 1c. plain yogurt for the sour cream, and added 1c chopped walnuts, and 1c. mini-semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Instead of baking it in the 2-3X7" loaf pans, I baked it in mini-loaf pans, and it took only about 25 min. to bake! they were absolutely delicious! thanks.

My mom has always had her favorite banana bread recipe (which I love), but I wanted to try something new.  Found this one and well... LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!  I've made it over and over the past few months, just making little changes here and there (adding spices, using splenda, non-fat yogurt, etc)  It's always awesome.  The sour cream really makes it moist which is my favorite part.  Everyone at works is always wanting me to make banana bread.  Made four batches tonight.  Thanks Cathy!!

This was a very good recipe! To make it 5 star I would recommend upping the bananas to 1.5 cups (add another banana), up the sugar to 1.5 cups, add 1 tsp of cinnamon, and add another egg. The sour cream was interesting vs. butter or oil. Thanks for the post.

EXCELLENT!!!  My entire family loved this recipe.  So MOIST, I did take a couple of the others suggestions and greased the pans and used cinnamon and sugar instead of flour, I also used 2 1/2 cups of mashed bananas instead of one, I used half all purpose flour, half wheat bread flour, and I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, I used applesauce in place of the butter. The banana flavor was incredible. I will definatly make this again and again.  DID I MENTION THIS WAS MOIST so yummy.

I altered this recipe to make it lower in fat, and it was still unbelievable. I used 1/2 cup nonfat sour cream and 1/2 cup nonfat yogurt in place of the cup of sour cream, and light, unsalted butter (50% less fat per tbsp!)  instead of margarine. I also added 1 tsp of almond extract along with the vanilla. It was marvelous!

Well, I have TOSSED OUT the recipe for banana bread that I have been using (and got many compliments on) for the past 8 years FOR THIS ONE!! I admit I was quite afraid of the banana/sour cream mixture, it really looked disgusting!! LOL And, I did add 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla, and this banana bread IS AWESOME!!!!!  Great job Cathy, thanks for sharing this treat with us!! =) This didn't get FIVE STARS for nothing!! =)

FINALLY!  I've been looking for almost a year for a recipe that decently replicates my grandmother's (which of course I lost)  This is WONDERFUL!!  Still a teensy bit bland, but well play around with it and figure out what's missing.  Like other reviewers, I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Also, I used 4 mediumish bananas and increased all other ingredients a tiche (except the egg) and it made 2 good size loaves.  However, after 55 min they were almost too done.  Very moist and delicious....thank you Cathy!

Finally!  A recipe that comes out moist and not over powering on the banana flavoring.  My husband said he liked his sister's recipe that used sour cream so I had to try this one out - and it's a winner!  I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and (accidentally) some tumeric and it came out great!  Will definitely make again!

I doubled the recipe to make some for my friend at work who loves homemade breads, but didn't realize until I was almost through the second part that I only had 3 eggs instead of 4. I was too lazy to go to the store so I stuck with 3 and the 3 loaves that I got out of this recipe still turned out great. I added a little cinnamon to the batter and also coated the pan with a cinnamon/sugar mixture. This gave the crust a good, sweet crunch. My 2 year old had 2 pieces of this for breakfast the next morning and I had 3. We toasted it in the toaster and put a little butter on it while it was still warm. I had to cook a little longer since I put it in 3 bread loaf pans instead of 4. Overall, VERY YUMMY!!

This banana bread is good. I didn't use the ripest bananas though and the bread turned out less sweet than I would have preferred. However; my kids really enjoyed the flavor alot. It made 3 nice size loaves...which is a bonus because I froze 2 loaves for when company is here! I added nuts to one and mini-chocolate chips to the other.

this was a very tasty banana bread.  I only had one egg, so I used 1/2 cup of mashed banana and 1/2 tsp baking powder instead and it still turned out wonderfully.  thanks Cathy

This is a really great recipe! Many ways to modify/substitute yet the basis is great to utilize. Used the sour cream this time but don't think it's necessary. Made following substitutions:

baking soda (not on hand) - used extra baking powder
flour - to make gluten free, used flaxseed meal
Sugar - brown & powdered sugar

In addition, added 1 packet of dark chocolate cocoa, flax seeds, lil butterscotch syrup, chocolate chips  & dollop of coconut oil (also used to grease pan). Absolutely fabulous!

I made this today with some modifications based on other reviews.  I added more bananas, all spice, nutmeg, chocolate chips walnuts and cinnamon.  I doubled the recipe for a large batch and also made a loaf.  The loaf took a long time to cook and the sides were burned so I cut them off.  The bread itself is very tasty and moist.  The flavor is amazing! The muffins rose nicely and didn't fall in the middle as some reviewers reported.  I had to sit in front of the oven the whole time to alternate the heat from above and below for even cooking.  I think they are very nice muffins and will make them again but won't double the recipe next time.  I gave it four stars since I had to modify it but I like the recipe.

Excellent and easy I took a few suggestions from reviews; put in more bananas, less sugar added baking powder and vanilla. The idea for cooking for 40 minutes then covering loosely with foil,lowering temp and cooking an additional 20 was great! I would rate this five star

This is my go-to recipe for banana bread. It's moist, dense and ridiculously delicious. It goes SO quickly in my house, I often make it twice a week just so I can get a second helping. The only modification I make is to use 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Stop reading this review and make it now!

Love this recipe! I cut the recipe in half to only make one loaf but I still used 1 cup of banana to keep it rich with flavor. I have bananas ripening right now so I can make this again! Love it!!

AS YOU CAN SEE I AM NOT A BAKER OR COOK...TO SAY THE LEAST. THIS IS A VERY EASY AND BEST BANANA BREAD I HAVE EVER MADE. I LOVE BANANA BREAD SO IT IS THE ONLY THING I TRY TO MAKE. IF YOU MAKE THIS YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. VERY MOIST AND SUPER TASTY. ALTHOUGH, I COOKED IT FOR 1 HOUR AND 5 MIN. 50 MIN ISN'T LONG ENOUGH FOR ME BUT IT MIGHT BE MY STOVE. ENJOY..ITS GREAT.

I must have done something wrong because this was bland and took forever to cook, probably more like 60 to 65 minutes than 50.   Maybe my bananas werent ripe enough?  This was my first time making banana bread.  Will keep trying.

This is a really good recipe! I only had one egg so used 3tbsp mayo, more vanilla, used the sugars equally because I LOVE the taste of molasses in the brown sugar in baking, AND I used some butter from a local dairy. SO AMAZING! I used a large cup cake pan that I oiled and lightly floured. It made 6 perfectly sized muffins with the same temp for 35min. A few choco chips and/or slivered almonds is really great too! Really good base recipe:)

Ive eaten a lot of banana bread in my day, but this is easily the best I've ever had. I took one of the other reviewer's suggestions and added another cup of banana (3 mashed banana's total) and instead of all white sugar I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. The addition of cinnamon and nutmeg was a great suggestion too. Loved this!

Tried this recipe after many attempts at just mediocre breads and muffins. I have to say this is the BEST banana bread recipe that I have ever tried. My family just loved it. This one is definitely going in the recipe box and will be made again for years to come.

I followed the recipe basically as written but did add some walnuts to make DH happy. I doubled the recipe and added a tablespoon of cinnamon. We ended up with 3 loafs. Perfect as I was able to give one to my DD & SIL fresh out the oven. Anyway. THis is a very moist bread and it is awesome. I am thinking this will be my go to banana bread from now on. OH I did make one mistake. I had self rising flour instead of all purpose so I did not add any salt, baking soda or baking powder. Still, it was perfect.

Quick, easy, and delicious! My husband is not a banana bread fan...and he LOVES this! Few changes are as follows:  I use 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of regular sugar and a 1/3 cup of softened butter instead of 1/4 cup (we like butter!) Oven temperature and time is spot on for my oven. Absolutely amazing! Thank you for sharing!

Excellent! added dried cranberries about 1/2 cup and love the flavor.  Most important this is a lovely moist banana bread, no doubt due to the sour cream.

I lost my Mom's banana bread recipe when I moved earlier this year. I decided to try this one, mostly because I had all of the ingredients. I followed the recipe except that I had 3 medium bananas (about 1 1/2 cups) and not quite a full cup of sour cream. I made muffins instead of bread. I baked for 16 minutes at 400 degrees and they turned out great. This recipe is more cake like than my Mom's which made a denser bread but the results were very good.

Very good!  I only had butter on hand so that's what I used.  Also, I found that I only needed to bake it for about 40 minutes.  Good recipe.

Good recipe.  I substituted half the sugar for brown. Nice texture & flavor but the loaves didn't crown at all.  Didn't really notice any change in the flavor I was expecting from the sour cream.

I thought I already had the best banana bread recipe until I tried this one. I use butter instead of margerine and substitute half of the white sugar for brown. A nice crumbly topping makes it even better.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I did cut back a bit on the sugar and will probably cute back even more the next time I make it, as it was a bit too sweet.  I read that a couple of raters made this in a bundt pan, so I poured the batter into my mini  bundt pan and baked if for about 45 minutes.

I was looking for a recipe that my 10 year old son could do and this looked super easy.  He made it alone (with my supervision)and it was delicious and very moist.  This is going into our family favorites!!

Nice, moist basic banana bread.  I added about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, and I used more banana, probably double as I was using up some ripe bananas and wanted to get rid of them.

This was a very good recipe! I used about 1/2 cup less flour, subbed ricotta for the cream cheese, used egg whites plus one whole egg, didn't have vanilla extract, so I used a bit of banana flavoring, used Splenda for 3/4 of the sugar, and added 1 1/2 cups of grated carrots. So, actually I guess I deviated from the recipe a bit. Great base recipe!

I am going to have to try to make this again. My first try seems a little dry and crunchy on the outside.  I baked it for only 40 minutes too.  I placed aluminum foil over the top when I realized it was getting a little burnt but the middle was still not done.  I think I did something wrong.  Last time I made pumpkin bread I undercooked it, so I wanted to make sure it was done in the middle on the top.  Oh well, it still tastes great.  I added walnuts and wrapped it up to lock in moisture.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and exactly what I was craving.

The only thing I did was add a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 c. walnut pieces (crushed a bit to make them smaller,) and kept in the oven for 55 minutes, instead of 50.  Thank you, Cathy, for sharing this recipe!

This was great!  I opted to slice a banana length wise & put it into the middle of the loaf, with the moisture there from the sourcream & mashed bananas - it just made for a cool bite when you ran into it.  Wonderful recipe - my daughter in law actually tried the bread & wanted more (she's not a banana person)!

I have never had a more moist banana bread than this recipe. I made a loaf for my co-workers and let me tell you . . . .they loved it!  HUGE hit in the office.  Thank you Cathy for sharing this mouth watering recipe!  Oh, and my husband thought I made it for the house and was a little upset that it wasn't on the counter top when he got home from work. Needles to say, I making another loaf as I type this out!!

Just o.k., had a strange spongey texture.  Not a lot of flavor.  Needs more banana and the addition of cinnamon.  Everyone that gives it 5 stars seems to doctor the recipe up.   They should rate the recipe as is.  I won't make this again.

I tried this recipe today and right now my husband is eating a warm piece right out of the oven.  He says it's absolutely delicious...I think so too... so tender and moist! I also added a little cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  This is my new favorite!  Thank you Cathy!

I was looking for a new banana bread recipe and I found a keeper!  I followed others revisions and used 3 bananas, cut the sugar slightly (1 1/4 cup), and baked at 425 for the first 5 minutes, then finished the last 45 minutes at 350.  This bread turned out wonderful.  I prefer my banana bread with walnuts, but I was out this time around; the nuts will make this bread perfect.

I love baking with sour cream instead of milk. It makes stuff so moist and tender. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, walnuts and chocolate chips and replaced a third of the flour with whole wheat. Delicious!

I've been making banana bread for many years and thought I had a great recipe.  Now I have the recipe for the best banana bread I've ever tasted and so simple to make!  I just beat in my bananas after creaming the sugar and margarine, added the eggs and sour cream then the other ingredients as directed.  Moist and delicious and already getting requests for another loaf!

Really lacks traditional banana bread flavor. I had to add a ton of spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon, all spice... If I have to modify a recipe this much, it is not a good one on its own. basic dough is pretty good and moist. But again, as it is written it is not a good recipe.

This is the BEST banana bread ever! It delivers dense, moist, delicious bread every time. I do add 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon allspice. I no longer measure the banana, I just use 3 large or four small bananas. I don't bother sifting the dry ingredients together. I just throw the baking powder and soda in first and then gradually add in the flour. Rises great each time. Enjoy this recipe!

I only had about 1/4 c sugar, so I used that with 1/4 c brown sugar, and 5 pkgs of NuStevia.  I also used coconut oil instead of margarine.  It was delicious.

Wonderful! This made exactly 5 mini loaf pans. I added 1 cup chopped walnuts, and like others, I used 1 c. white sugar and 1/3 c. brown. I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon too.

This is a wonderful recipe!  Very moist and dense.  I followed the recipe very closely, but I did make a few changes.  I used 4 small/medium bananas as that's what I had to use up.  It yielded more like a cup and a half of mashed banana.  Instead of the 1 1/3 cup of white sugar I used 1/3 cup light brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar.  I added in about a cup of chopped pecans and then I baked in a bundt pan for 60 minutes at the same temperature.  It came out perfectly and I'm planning to freeze half.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so moist. MOIST MOIST MOIST. Its still perfect 1.5 days later.Usedd 1/2 + 1/3 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. Added 2/3c chopped walnuts and used 3 large bananas. Everyone seemed to love it and it came out perfect in a glass 9x13 pyrex pan. Used someone else's suggestion and layed a piece of foil on top (just layed not wrapped) when it had about 28 mins left. this way the top stayed perfect! It did not get brown and hard. Will definitely make this again!!!!

I have to say this is the best banana bread I have ever had. I had never made banana bread before but will be buying extra banana's every week so that I can. I changed nothing made it just as written and it turned out beautifully. OH just for other people who hate to mix in this bowl and mix in that bowl this recipe turns out great even if you just throw it all in one bowl and mix.

I've never had luck with making any type of breads in a loaf pan so I used a bundt pan... and it worked!   The sour cream made the banana bread very moist.  Thank you.  Will make again.

As others suggested, I used a heaping cup of sour cream and a heaping cup of mashed bananas.  This recipe turns out moist and delicious.  I also stirred in a cup of chopped pecans.  Everyone in my husband's office loved it.

WOW Cathy...thank you ...thank you...thank you!!!
the best banana bread EVER....yes....EVER...
I did as one reader suggested and I used three bananas instead of one cup,and I also used one cup of white sugar and the remaining sugar I substituted brown sugar...The sour cream is what makes this bread so moist..one reader complained that she could taste the sour cream...well she must have did something wrong because the only thing you taste is the warm sweet taste of home! My husband and my teenage son are so very fussy and they were licking their fingers...as was I!!

Very moist and good!  I did reduce the sour cream to 1/2 cup (just to save on fat) and made the banana 1 1/2 cup to compensate.  It is fabulous for breakfast with honey drizzled on top alongside your coffee!

I am an avid baker and sour cream in this recipe peaked my interest. I followed it exactly like the recipe posted, in fact, it looked exactly like the posted photo since I baked it in a bundt pan. Although all ingredients were well mixed, this bread had areas of baking soda taste, which was not too tasteful. I will stick with my favorite, EBNB, on this site. Sorry but I should have kept with EBNB...

This is a great recipe - the only thing I add, and I add this to a lot of recipes, if ground flax seed.  I added about half a cup of flax seed and it gives the recipe a slight healthy edge as well as a nuttier flavour without the nuts.  However, even without this addition it is a great recipe.  Thank you Cathy.

I made 2 loaves--one with chocolate chips and one without. This cake is so moist. The only change I made was to use 1 cup of brown sugar in place of the 1 1/2 cup white sugar. A huge hit, a great recipe. Thanks.

I think this is the BEST bread I have ever made.  I doctored it a little and added cinnamon and nutmeg and I think I will try and go with 1/3 less sugar like some other ladies suggested, but that is about all I would modify.  My family enjoyed it as well.

The bread is delicious!  I've made several banana bread recipes on this site, and this by FAR is the BEST!  The only change I made was I put in a handful of semi-chocolate chips and pecans.

Great recipe.  The only problem I found was the fact that I don't use a conventional oven when I bake.  In my convection oven cut the time to 30 minutes.

This is my first review and I just made this.  I thought I would share my response.  I live in Denver so I made adjustments to baking soda, powder and flour.  I put 1/2t + 1/8t of powder and soda each.  Added 2T of flour for every cup of flour.  Added 1t cinnamon and used 5 bananas.  I also baked at 400 for 1st 5 min and then down to 350 for 35 min in a 7X3 pan.  I gave this a 4* because I didn't use SUPER ripe bananas (my fault).  The texture turned out great and rose the perfect amount, having a nice crumb size and densness.  I will try again using the ripest bananas and let you know.

this is a delicious banana bread the only changes i made is i used six banana's, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and baked on 400 degrees for the 1st five  minutes, then reduced the heat to 350 for the next 45 minutes. It is very easy to make and fool proof. Thanks cathy for a wonderful, delicious easy recipe. i have five childern and they loved it. it did not last long i will defiently make this over and over again.

Love this recipe.  Followed exactly with the exception that I used a bundt pan and baked @425 for 5 min and 350 for 50 minutes.  Came out beautiful and moist and tasty.

This was absolutely the best banana bread I've ever had.  Only things I changed was I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 cup of white sugar, and 1/3 cup brown sugar. I baked it in a bunt pan for 40 minutes and it’s so moist, it's probably not going to make it thru the night.

Pretty good!  Definitely very moist.  Tasted like banana "cake" though... I like my bread darker and with more bananas.  Thanks!

I really liked this recipe! I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream, apple sauce for the margarine, and whole-wheat flour for the regular flour.  It made it much healthier, and it was still really good. I don't think that wheat flour made the bread taste bad.  I liked it with wheat flour.

First of all, it sunk after cooling for a few minutes :(  and on top of that, it was too sweet, and didn't have enough banana flavor (or ANY flavor for that matter).

First time I have rated a recipe.  I had some ripe bananas and came to this site to find a recipe.  I found several and printed 3.  I ended up making this one and my boyfriend LOVED IT!!!!!  He said it was SOOOO MOIST; I do not who's recipe you used but this is AWESOME!!! I do not know if that was b/c of the SC, but it worked.  I am not a Banana Bread person, but I even ate some and really enjoyed it.  I did use 5 small bananas, made 2 cups, and used Self-Rising flour instead of plain.  I did have to bake longer about 1 1/2 hours, and used STARZ7369 suggestion and covered with foil.  I tried to use the topping for the Banana Crumb Muffins on this site and could not get the consistency correct, probably b/c I did not measure, but the bread was great without it.  I cooked in bundt or pound cake pan and used a mixer.   Too lazy to do by hand.  GREAT RECIPE!!!!  I will make again!!! THANKS!!!  I have made this several times since the first review!!! A HIT each time, and does not last through the first day!!!  With a suggestion from my mom, I lowered temp to 300 and cooked about 15 min longer.  NOTE:  Always test middle with a toothpick to see if it is done.  If it comes out clean it is, if not, cook a little longer.   THIS ONE IS A KEEPER!!! THANKS CATHY!!!!!!!!!!!

This is sooooo good!  It is moist and has a strong banana flavor-- wonderful!  Also simple to make, a plus.  I made mine in a bundt pan and it was perfectly done in 50 minutes.  I cut the sugar back to 1 cup and added an extra banana.  Great!

I made this according to the original recipe except for using butter instead of margarine and adding 1 12-oz. bag chocolate chips and 1 1/2 c. chopped walnuts. I adjusted the servings to 24 and used my Wilton 4-mini loaf pan. This made 8 mini-loaves filled 2/3 full of batter. Baked about 35-40 minutes. Wonderfully moist and delicious!!!

The best I have tried and I have tried a lot of recipes. They always turn out dry but this one was perfect. Had to cook a little longer though, about 15 extra minutes. Kept checking center with toothpick to make sure it was done in the middle. Sprinkled pan with cinnamon sugar first which was yummy! Thanks!!

Both my husband and roomie love this recipe. I now make it every Sunday. I also use a bundt pand and use the cinnamon/sugar to flour the pan. Also, I've been out of baking soda and used only baking powder and it still turned out great!

This bread is really tasty, and so easy to make.  The second time I made it, I was craving chocolate, so I added about a cup of chocolate chips to the batter.  Let me just say...was it yummy?! The perfect comfort food, for a cool, Fall day or when you just have a few bananas that are getting too brown, for anyone to eat.  Enjoy!

BEST BANANA BREAD IN THE HISTORY OF COOKING. PERIOD.

I only made 1/2 of the recipe because I only had 1/2 cup of mashed banana... still, the flavor was exquisite!
Super moist, DELICIOUS!!!

I've tried a lot of banana bread recipes, and I have to say this is one of the best!  The only changes I made were: lowfat sour cream, 1/4 cup applesauce instead of margarine, and only 1 cup of sugar.  The bread is moist, sweet, delicious and good for you!  It doesn't get much better than that.

This is easy and excellent! I did it just as the recipe called for. I used a bundt pan & dusted the greased pan with cin/sugar mixture. I then dusted the top with powdered sugar! Great recipe, thanks!

I followed other reviewer suggestions and coated the loaf pan with a sugar/cinnamon mix.  I used 3 very ripe bananas and that's all it needed to get a good flavor.  I also added chopped walnuts to the banana/sour cream mix.
It took almost an hour to finish baking but well worth the wait.  I'll definitely make this my go-to recipe for banana bread.

finally I can stop looking for a great banana bread recipe! I took the advice of another reviewer, and "floured" the pan (bundt) with a mix of cinnamon and sugar- this really made the recipe!

I bought so many over ripe bananas on special that I was able to quadruple the recipe. This bread turned out soooooo good that only one loaf ended up in the freezer. Three loaves gone in two days, need I say more? Did add walnuts, a must in this household. Thanks Cathy, for the best banana bread recipe ever. ******

Very good bread!  I made a few minor modifications, such as using applesauce instead of butter and adding more banana, as well as vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  I topped off the bread with a mixture of chopped walnuts, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  I made 2 smaller loaves instead of 1 big one.  It is so good!

I don't even like banana bread and thought this was great!  I added a little cinnamon sugar at the bottom of the pan, as well.

So moist!  I used about 1 1/3 cups of whole wheat flour, and 2/3 of regular flour and it turned out great.

LOVE it! What a great, easy recipe and it tastes great! Turned out perfectly, even at higher elevation. (we're at around 7000 ft.) I added just a little more flour for the altitude conversion and turned out great! THANKS for the recipe, Cathy!

I used natural plain yoghurt because I didn't have any sour cream, added a couple dashes of cinnamon and it came out delightful.  Also I always mash the vanilla with the bananas and let it sit for a few minutes while I prepare the rest of the ingredients, don't know if it really enhances the flavor or if it is just my imagination.  Anyway, the bread has a really awesome flavor and perfect texture, moist but not soggy or spongy.  I don't know why other people gave the recipe low ratings but I noticed a lot of changed ingredients causing complaints (yes, if you use wheat bread the bread will not rise as well.  If you do want to use wheat, substitute only half of the white flour and add a little extra baking soda and it should be fine).  I noticed from comments that there were a lot of variations in baking times, most likely due to whether the oven was preheated properly and to variations in the ovens themselves.  I set the timer for 35 minutes and checked it every couple of minutes till it looked nicely browned and passed the toothpick test.  DELICIOSO!!!

This recipe will replace the Pilsbury's recipe I've been using for almost 30 years!  Based on previous reviews, I used half brown and half white sugars and I added 1 tsp. each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to one loaf and baked the other without.  Caution!  Baking time was 30-35 minutes, not 50!

Excellent taste and texture.  Sour cream is a nice added ingredient. I used three bananas. Also used half brown and half white sugar.  Added chopped pecans and chocolate chips. Skip the loaf pan and use a bundt pan for a nicer presentation.  I sprayed the bundt pan and the bread came out perfectly and looks as good as it tastes.  Throw away the dry recipes and use this one!

Oh this is so yummy, it's moist, light, fluffy and the banana flavour is just right on. I loved it. I didn't add a thing to it. Very easy to make. Used just 2 bananas that I had in the freezer.

This was a good banana bread, but I would have liked it to be a little sweeter. I also added some cinammon and nutmeg to the batter to jazz it up a bit, and that worked out really well.

This banana bread was fantastic.  I've probably made this recipe 10 times, every time it came out perfect.  There were two times it came out uncooked at the bottom, but that's when I didn't measure my banana's.

We just finished snacking on this tasty banana bread.  The sour cream makes it really moist.  When I made it today I substituted plain yougurt for the sour cream and it was fantastic.

What a delicious recipe.  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions, used some cinnamon, 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, and instead of flouring the pans I used cinnamon and sugar.  I made 4 3x5 loaves and it only took 30 minutes for them to get finished.  I ended up not having enough sour cream so I added some vanilla yogurt and it was just great.  I am replacing the banana bread recipe that I have used for over 5 years with this one.  Thanks!

Good banana bread!  I substituted banana flavored yogurt for the sour cream, and it was excellent, very banana-ey!  I also made some "icing" for it, with mashed bananas, powdered sugar, and a touch of milk.  Yummmm!

Very, very moist bread.  Wonderful texture and flavour. Used only 1 cup of sugar (1/2 white and 1/2 brown) and whole wheat flour and turned out superb.  Also added cinnamon and nutmeg and spinkled pan and bread with a cinnamon-sugar mixture before baking.  This recipe is in my favourites.  Thanks Cathy

I added about 1 tbsp. of orange rind, upped the vanilla to 1 tbsp., upped salt to 1/2 tsp, and added 1 cup of rough chopped pecans.I used butter in place of margarine. The flavor was incredible. Everyone wants the recipe. Great served with honey sweetened cream cheese with a little orange rind in it...perfect for morning or afternoon tea.

I've made a lot of banana bread, but have kept searching for a better one, and this might be it!  Next time I will add a little more banana.  It was so moist and had a great flavor. It will be a favorite in my house I'm sure.

I used 1 1/4 cups of very overripe bananas (3 bananas), 3/4 cup of sour cream, and 1 cup of sugar. I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and grated in some fresh nutmeg. I also added some chopped pecans. I baked it in (2) 6-inch round pans.  The taste was quite good--the banana flavor was strong and it was not too sweet.  The consistency was like an airy cake, and it was very moist without being soggy or gummy.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it's pretty darn good.  My husband certainly didn't complain. ;-)

Wow, Cathy, I just want to thank you for this terrific bread. The baking powder that I used was out of date only slightly (12/94) :) so it was a little flat and dense. It was simply blissful. My friends kept asking for more banana brownies. The next time I make this (and there will definitely be a next time) I will buy a brand new tin of baking powder and enjoy it at its fully risen gloriousness. Once again, thank you!

Really moist!  I used real butter and also added a 1/4 of a cup of applesauce, which made it even better.  YUM!  Needs no frosting or anything but a glass of milk.

Definitely a keeper.  Very moist and delicious.  I added a tablespoon of orange rind and left out the nuts as my family does not like them.  I have tried many banana breads and this is great.

Very moist even though I overcooked it. I sugared the pan and added a few extras to the recipe (nutmeg, choc. chips) and it turned out great. A definate keeper.

This was a pretty good recipe, although I think that it needed just a little more banana.  Overall, it was good enough that I would make it again.

I made this & it was very good! I read the reviews first & made the following changes- I used an extra cup of bananas, used butter instead of margarine, used brown sugar instead of white & used an extra splash of vanilla as well as a dash of cinnamon. Hubby loved it. I would’ve preferred adding nuts. Still very good though!

This makes a lovely light, moist flavorful banana bread. I like a little almond flavor for half the vanilla.
Divided into two 8X4 aluminum pans, the breads cooked for 43 minutes to perfection!
After creaming the butter and sugar; use a spoon and scraper to mix the banana in and again to fold the dry ingredients in. (In other words do not over beat) Batter will bubble a bit as you prepare the pans; spoon in without stirring out the bubbles and you will have a lighter fluffier bread.

I always use recipe EXACTLY as written first time around and then make modifications if needed the next time I make it.  This is absolutely perfect as is.  It’s very moist and rich.  I might add some pecans or walnuts next time if I have them on hand

I have been making this recipe since 2007 and it is THE best banana bread ever!  The only enhancement I add is choc chips!  It is more like a dessert and oh so good!  So if you are new to baking, make sure you save this recipe.  I tell people all the time to look for Cathy's banana bread on Allrecipes.com.  Thank you Cathy!!

I did try this made with sour cream but only had half a cup left so I added vanilla yogurt to replace it.  Super moist and really good.  I also made this with all vanilla yogurt and it is just as yummy!  Its actually the best banana bread I’ve ever made.  I was going to put half of the batter in another pan because in one pan it rises really well and you have a large loaf, so if I want a smaller loaf I’ll divide it.

Instead of the sour cream I used plain yogurt, and instead of the 1 1/3 cups of white sugar I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar, and the next time I'll add a bit more of bananas. The recipe was amazing, my whole family loved it and I will definitely be making it again!

Cathys Banana Bread is the most delicious banana bread i have ever made and eaten.
I used a little more banana, salt butter, cut out the salt because of the salted butter, and used half the amount of sugar.   My daughters, who are loyal to Bob Evans Banana Bread, said this is so much better than their life long favorite.  That says it all.  This is going in my keepsake recipe book.  No need to try any other.  P.S. It freezes well also.
Thanks you "Cathy" for sharing this. Thanks again, Joellen

This is, by far, the best banana bread recipe ever. I do switch it up a bit. See MimiAlea changes. I double her topping. It’s always moist and everyone comments on how good it is. Yumm!

One of the best Banana Bread recipes I have used.  I stayed close to the recipe with the exception of using more bananas.  Only because I want to use them up.  I like the sour cream and less butter.  I also think it is important to mix by hand and not use a mixer.  I have used this recipe several times, always good!

This is my go-to banana bread recipe! Everyone seems to love it. Instead of "flouring" the pan, I use a cinnamon and sugar mixture which gives it a nice finish. I don't know if it's my oven, but I do tend to bake it for longer than 50 mins. Aside from that I us the recipe as-is and it comes out great every time!

Please note the pan size!  I did not notice this and put it in a regular loaf pan, and it did not turn out well.    However, the parts of it that were edible were fantastic!  I will try this again in the correct size of pan.

I've never reviewed a recipe before but felt compelled to make an exception. I have been making this for several years now and it has been called the absolute best banana bread by everyone who tries it. Like others, I use more bananas (3-4) and occasionally add walnut pieces or chocolate chips. Have also tried adding cinnamon and nutmeg, but the basic recipe with extra banana is always a winner. Thank you for this recipe!

My favorite banana bread! So simple and delicious. I have made this banana bread several time and will continue to. Some changes: I use butter instead of margarine because I refuse to use margarine. I use probably about 1.5-2cups of extremely over ripe bananas. And I use plain Fage Greek yogurt (little extra protein to this treat). I'll use 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/3cup white. And if I remember, I'll add some cinnamon. This bread comes out amazing and moist each time.

Nice and moist. We enjoyed this bread. Only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine. I used a glass loaf pan and for me it took 55 mins to cook. I also made like a fruit crisp topping for it. DH likes his slices grilled. Thanks Cathy for sharing your recipe

Fantastic!! Very easy and simply delicious! I changed things slightly. Used 1 cup sour cream, and 1/3 cup greek yogurt, added 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice to the batter. Then before I popped the loaves into the oven, I sprinkled a mixture of 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3 tblsp flour, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 2 tblsp melted butter, over the top. Wonderful flavor and very moist and fluffy.

The only issue I have with Cathy's banana bread us how many people request it.  Its hard finding over ripe bananas for last minute requests.  The only changes I made was taking the suggestion of using brown sugar and cutting down on the white sugar and adding lots of cinnamon and nutmeg to both flour mixture and bottom if pan. One more change which was a total accident due to not knowing how many bananas mashed make a cup I ended up using a total of six bananas. Baked in two 8inch loaf pans. The breads are not very tall but somehow this is what makes them so unique  

like I said total accident

This is more banana cake than plain banana bread... I am not a fan of banana bread but friends and family are!  =)  I used vanilla greek yogurt (2%) in place of the sour cream and it worked perfectly.  Really amped up the vanilla flavor.  Recipe doubled easily for church potluck.  This will not be the last time I make this.

I had three sad looking bananas on my kitchen counter and tried Cathy's recipe.  I didnt have sour cream, so I substituted vanilla yogurt. Out of the oven, the loaves looked so delicious, I ate two pieces. I am hooked. I rate this moist fluffy bread 5 stars. As with any bread recipe be careful not to overmix - overmixing makes the bread tough.  Also, check your oven for correct inside temperature; I discovered (after a few failures with a new oven) that the digital temperature reading displayed 350 degrees, but inside the oven had only heated to 310 degrees - a sure way to ruin any recipe.  Thank you, Cathy.

This is the only banana bread base recipe that I use!  I love the sour cream as it makes the bread so moist and delicious.  I will also add coconut or dark rum and sometimes nutmeg or a dash of cinnimon.  Yum!

I’ve made this about a hundred times. By far the best banana bread I’ve ever had. I mix in nuts and a bit of rum or German Eierlikör (egg liqueur). Yum

very moist and tasty, and baked perfectly for me; granted I didn't necessarily do 50 mins and just kept tabs on it. Also I added a cocoa swirl to my bread and muffins which gave it a very sophisticated look, and brushed the pans with olive oil since we were out of pam...I have never had such an easy time getting muffins out, not a single bottom broke off.

A winner!! My husband is not a fan of banana bread (but I love it and had some bananas that were just begging to be made into a bread).  To my amazement, and his surprise, he couldn't stay away from it!! I am adding this recipe to my "must do again" stack!

Good taste but turned out a little dry. I think they need a little more banana too.

I followed the recipe but changed the sugar to a mix of brown and white. I loved it, it was wonderful. I loved the salty crust with buttery after taste. Thank you.

I love the recipe when I read it. If only I followed it. I cut back on the sugar and wished I didn't. The bread was moist and delicious. I am on Kauai and used apple bananas which aren't as sweet so the sugar would have helped. Overall the bread was moist and that's what I wanted originally. The sour cream attracted me to this recipe. I'd make it again.

I love this recipe! I have never made banana bread before but I have tried several recipes my mom makes and this was by far the best!  She even called me to get this recipe! I was so simple. I did add walnuts to it. I will def be making it again.

My husband and son love this recipe.  I don't use the sour cream because 1) I never have it on hand and 2) it's not really good for you.  I add 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts and typically use about 3 bananas.  Super easy and great for breakfast!  Thanks Cathy!

I just made it for the first time, but added some golden raisins and walnuts to it.  Since we're starting the New Year trying to eat a little healthier, I added Splenda instead of the sugar.  Your recipe came out very moist.  My family really liked it!

I followed some of the recommendations. 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, add seasoning: cinnamon and nutmeg. I added chopped walnuts. The sour cream really made a difference, very moist!

I love this recipe.  The bread smells yummy and turns out moist.  I will play around with this recipe and add half brown sugar and half white next time.  I think I'll also try adding some spices and maybe more bananas as did the other reviewers.

I have received more compliments on this bread than any other banana bread I have made. Since I have a household of non-nut lovers (boo) I used mini semi sweet chocolate chips instead. Definitely a crowd pleaser!

This was awesome!! I made a double batch because I had so many bananas go at once and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan.  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I used nonfat vanilla yogurt and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  I also added some cinnamon.  YUMMY!!!!

Just excellent. I adjusted it to make it a bit healthier and it was even more delicious. I replaced 1 cup of the white flour with 1/2 cup of whole wheat and 1/2 cup of ground flax. The flax adds a beautiful nutty aroma that is very complimentary to the banana bread. I also reduced the sugar because I added a sprinkle of chocolate chips (not many). I will never use another banana bread recipe.

So moist and absolutely try letting this bread "sit" one day before eating because it is much tastier that way in my humble opinion. Oven at 350 and baked perfectly at 50 minutes. Great recipe!

The second time I baked this banana bread I only had 1/2 cup sour cream so I used 1/2 cup low fat vanilla yogurt as a substitute for the other 1/2 cup sour cream. Worked perfectly.

I made this last week followed the directions exactly and it was AMAZING!! My boyfriend loved it and asked for more now I am making another loaf. The first time I made it I split the batter in half in a loaf pan they cooked for like 30-40 mins. This time I tried all the batter in one loaf pan I ended up baking it for 55 minutes looks good haven't tasted it yet. I wouldn't change anything about this soooo yummy!!

Beautifully Delicious! I used 2 and 1/2 large bananas and cooked it for 1 hour and 15 min. Perfect! I will make this again.

I had plans to make this bread but waited too long only to find that my bananas had gotten too ripe, so.... it became pineapple bread. I used fat free sour cream and substitued the margarine with applesauce. I also added about a cup of toasted walnuts. It was so moist and very delicious! Next time I will check those bananas sooner and use this recipe. Thanks for the post Cathy.

This is a great banana bread recipe.  I usually use a recipe that calls for buttermilk, but all I had was sour cream and boy did that do the trick!  It was much lighter and fluffier.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg, and substituted in 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of white.  It was like marrying banana bread and spice cake!  I also used a 9x5 loaf pan and it came out fine, I just cooked it for a little over an hour at 350 like the recipes says.  A+!!

WOW!!!  This is fabulous.  I used applesauce instead of butter, but kept the rest of the recipe as written.  I baked in three mini loaf pans, and they were done in about 30 minutes.  I love banana bread right out of the oven with that little crust on the outside and the warm center, and these delivered in every way.  Great recipe that I will use time and time again.  Thanks!

I had 2 large bananas one day riper than we like to eat them... so my husband asked me what I was going to do with them... just decided quickly at 9:15 pm that I would make some banana bread. I found this recipe online; checked all the ingredients and had everything so I began mixing it up. Later I noticed that I had put cream cheese instead of sour cream and it was delicious. I added pecans. I brought the second loaf to work today and it disappeared in no time. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and son loved this bread.  I did not make any changes.  My husband said that it was cooked just right.  It was moist and had great flavor.  I added choc chips to one loaf.

Delicious!  This was a great way to use up extra sour cream and the my overripe frozen bananas I had.  I halved the recipe for just one bread and used 2 mashed bananas.  Blended together using my electric hand mixer until smooth, and then before adding into the pan, I folded in about 1.5 teaspoon of cinnamon before pouring into the pan.  Didn't use any margarine or butter and didn't need it.  Will make again.

Delicious!!! I substituted butter for the margarine, low fat plain yogurt for the sour cream, and used three large ripe bananas.  I also used 1 cup brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar instead of 1 1/3 cup white as well as adding a teaspoon of cinnamon. Lastly, I used 1 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I know this rating is not true to this recipe since I made so many substitutions, but I think this recipe is still a great base and you can make it less fattening or more fattening if you like!!  This bread stays so moist and is the perfect consistency, not dry and crumbly at all.  I also cooked my bread for an hour and made one loaf and six muffins topped with walnuts and wheat germ  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

Great banana bread!!  I made two small loaf pans.  I did the recipe exactly as written.  But I did add 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to batter and sprinkled some on top.  Best banana bread I have tried.

I found this bread to be sort of gummy.  It rose beautifully & I thought I had a winner, but, the texture was just not what I was looking for.  Sorry

I'm not sure i was meant to make this bread today. I didn't have enough sour cream and my baking skills were all off but somehow this banana bread turned out soooo good it's ridiculous! I had about 3/4 of the sour cream for this recipe and used 2 mashed bananas. While it was baking it looked like it was done so i took it out. gave it a gentle tap on the top and it seemed ok. Came back(about a 1/2 hour later) and the whole top was sunk in!!! lol i didn't know what to do so i threw it back in the oven and prayed for a miracle. I think you can do so much with this recipe and it will still turn out delicious! You just can't go wrong with this one even if your game is off!

AWESOME!  I used yougart in place of 1/3 of the sour cream and added butter, flour, cinnamon and brown sugar to the top.  I live at altitude so baked it for 5 minutes at 400 and then down to 350 for the rest.  Make it turn out great, even at altitude!

This is no longer Cathy's banana bread - it's mine!   I use half brown sugar, half white.  I also add half a bag of chocolate chips.  Maybe a teaspoon of cinnamon.  It is a great recipe, my 'go-to' something to bake.  Darn, the bananas are brown?  No worries!  The sour cream is really the ticket.

Yummm. I've tried several banana bread recipes, and I think this might be the best ever. I used 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar and it was plenty sweet.

Right before my oat bread was finished, I whipped this up with my Kitchen Aid so I didn't have to preheat my oven twice. I followed the recipe closely, only using NF organic plain yogurt in place of the sour cream. (All out of sour cream for now. Eeek.) Baked up nicely, though I did cover it halfway with foil to keep from burning. I used my extra large loaf pan to make one large loaf, instead of making two smaller loaves. The yogurt gave the banana bread a nice twang. I'd make this again, only I think I might cut back on the sugar just a bit. I thought it was a little too sweet.

I used more bananas than recipe specified (3 bananas - one extremely ripe with skin blackened and two moderately ripe) and less sugar (2/3 cup sugar 1/3 cup Splenda). I didn't have any vanilla extract on hand so I didn't use any. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and it came out absolutely perfect in only 30 mins of baking in a bundt pan. Splenda tends to shorten the baking time from what I've seen so I'm glad I checked it after 30 mins because it was perfectly cooked at that point.

Fabulous , easy to do by hand not worth doing in a machine, I sprinkled a little cinnamon in the baking pans and no matter how many I make- they're gone the same day.I keep having to make this recipe. Thank-you(Cathy!)

The best banana bread ever! The only change I made was to use half white and half brown sugar and to add a couple teaspoons of cinnamon. Oh and if I am making it for my husband I add a cup of chocolate chips (dredge them in flour first so they don't all sink to the bottom).

Heavenly!!  This is a wonderfully moist bread--just what I had a craving for!  I did as someone suggested and instead of all white sugar, I replaced it with 1 cup of brown and the other 1/3 cup with white.  I would highly recommend this delicious bread.  Thank you so much, Cathy!!

I have tried many banana bread recipes. This one is amazing. I of course add a bit of different items like chocolate chips or sprikle nuts on top. It all depends on what my family feels like that day. Thank you

Excellent bread! I added walnuts and baked in muffin tins and small loaf pans sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar. On some I added a topping of brown sugar, butter, walnuts and cinnamon. On the rest I just sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top.   Both variations turned out well.  This recipe was so good that I couldn't help but share with my neighbors as a "thank you" for helping me with snow removal while my husband is out of the town for work. I think they will enjoy. Definitely gift-giving or bake sale material. Thanks Cathy!

SUPER Banan Bread!!! I have look high and low, for a recipe with Sour Cream. Thanks so much Cathy. THIS will now be my Christmas bread, every year!!! The other suggestions are great too. BUT, the sour cream makes ALL the difference.

I have been making this recipe for 3 years now and I LOVE it!  I have a banana allergy and this bread has just the right amount of banana for me to eat without having any problems. It always bakes up very moist.  And I love that it makes two loaf pans.  I've never taken it anywhere where I was not asked for the recipe.

This recipe is AWESOME!!  I have tried to find a good banana bread recipe for years but so many of them turn out dry and the one's that were moist had so much butter/oil in them I felt guilty eating them. The sour cream in this recipe keeps the bread moist and helps balance the sweetness.  I substituted the margarine for the same amount of salted butter and omitted the 1/4 t salt.  I only used 1 C of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Mine was cooked in 40 minutes so be sure to check it early :) 

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I loved this recipe, it was so moist and delicious.  The only changes I made were: used butter instead of margarine, added some cinnamon (about 1-2 tsp) and I used a Bundt pan.  

My husband said to throw out my old recipe, this is the "one"!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This is by far the best recipe for banana bread that I have had, and I grew up on the stuff. I did what one reviewer said - add part brown sugar. I did add 1/2 cup of chopped pecans, 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup of chopped and drained maraschino cherries. The cherries really add something wonderful!

This makes an excellent batch of 22-24 standard sized banana muffins.  At 350 degrees, mine were beautifully browned all around but not burned in just under 25 minutes.

this recipe was really super! i've made lots of banana bread recipes from this site and this one came out the best by far. TIPS: i used extra low fat sour cream and added a little bit of milk, was moist and spongy. i did add chocolate chips for added texture and my roommates loved it!
this is the one im sticking with!

Yummy! I Made this recipe after trying several different recipes for banana bread that my 2 yr old refused to eat. This one was a hit! She was begging for more! It was also a huge hit with our dinner guests. I will use this recipe from now on. Hints: I only had 1/2 cup of sour cream and I used 3 large bananas, it still came out great and VERY moist. I cooked it for 45 mins and covered with foil half way through the cooking process. I wrapped the still warm bread in foil and it stays moist for the next few days while we munch on it. Thanks.

What a wonderful bread! I used a bundt cake pan, pecans in the mix and 1 cup of sugar.  It was the lightest bread we've ever eaten.
This recipe is a real keeper.

I have used this recipe before and loved it.  I am trying to be more health conscious without compromising flavor.  This time I substituted wheat flour, buttermilk instead of sour cream.  I used 5 bananas (almost too ripe) and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I added 1/2 cup of quick oats, 1/4 wheat germ, and 1/2 crused bran flakes.  Suprisingly it turnd out good!

This is the BEST banana bread I have EVER had! I substituted 1/3 cup of brown sugar for 1/3 cup of the white sugar. Other than that I made no substitutions. I'll never use another banana bread recipe. This beats them all!

YUM!!  I followed another viewers advice and cranked the heat to 425 for the first 5 minutes and turned down to 350 and cooked for 50 more minutes.  Halfway through I put foil across the top.  I used 3 medium, very ripe bananas but next time I would add one more.  I also used egg whites and added cinnamon.  This was very moist and I will definitely make again!

Excellent!  Made the following changes: 4 bananas, 1 c light sour cream, 1 c brown sugar (no white sugar).  Used cooking spray as opposed to greasing and flouring the pan and a bundt pan.  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes, cooled 10 minutes and it popped right out.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and very moist.  I added a couple of pinches of cinnamon and folded in some chopped nuts along with adding a bit more banana and using low fat sour cream.   Made about 8 muffins and a smaller loaf of bread. The guys at the office loved the muffins, thanks!

Very good moist banana bread. Sweet and bursting with banana flavor! I added a couple of handfuls of walnut pieces to mine. I cooked this in a 9x13 glass dish and it was done in about 40 minutes. Hubby barely waited for this to cool and then ate this til he was stuffed.

very easy to make and super moist! I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar and found it a little too sweet but maybe also because I used 3 med sized bananas. It took exactly 50 mins to bake to a golden brown. I used fat free sour cream and it worked great. Be sure to cool completely because it can be sticky.

I made this with fat free sour cream and it turned out great still!  Everybody I have served this to has loved it.  I used 3 bananas that I had frozen so they didn't even need mashing after they thawed.  I always use a bundt pan and that seems to cook evenly.  I tried it with chocolate chips once, but this recipe doesn't need chocolate to be good.

This bread is delicious.  But after 35 minutes of baking, it started to smell like it was burning.  I checked it and was very brown, put in a toothpick and it was done.  I did add 2 bananas instead of 1 cup and baked in two loaf pans but not sure if that's why it cooked so fast.

I used applesauce inplace of the butter. Not sure if this caused the problem I incountered. It came out way too wet eventhough I baked it for additional time.

I had 5 kitchens make this recipe for a Foods lab and they all took at least 75 minutes to finish.  I took the advice of other reviews and added additional bananas, 2 cups, instead of 1, I think this made it too gooey.  i will try this again with just the one cup.  It was very moist, almost to the point of "is it done or not".  Flavor was cake-like.

I have made a LOT of banana bread, but never come across a recipe using sour cream.  This was DELISH!!!!  My 11yr old and I nearly finished off the first loaf before it cooled last night, and the second is gone as of this morning! Definitely a keeper!!!

I've tried a lot of banana bread recipes and this one is by far the absolute best. The only thing I add is a few dashes of cinnamon to the batter. I also coat the baking pan with a very thin layer of butter flavored crisco and make a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon to coat the pan. I also add a little of this mixture to the top of the bread before I bake it. It has the perfect amount of mositness and banana flavor. Whenever I bake this I always give away to family and it is hands down the best. Everyone always wants more.

Very, very good. We made muffins, mini-muffins, and bread, and added 1 cup mini chocolate chips. Also quick and easy and we will try it again. It would not hurt this recipe to use less sugar, but it was not overly sweet in our opinion. Made at times by a ten year old and at times by an eight year old.

I've tried a dozen recipes for Banana Bread, and so far, this one is the best!  Really nice flavor--not overly sweet or bland.  I like extra-moist bread, so I add a little extra banana.  Also I add a handful of chopped nuts.

Great recipe.  I used two bananas in the recipe and it turned out fine.  It's not too sweet and perfect for slicing and toasting with butter the next morning.  Yum!

I made this recipe for my husband's work breakfast and apparently the six loaves were a hit because all loaves were gone within a few hours. I made each one with three and a half bananas and used a combo of brown (mostly) and white sugar.

Oh MAN!!  I just took this out of the oven and it is AMAZING. I was worried it wouldn't be sweet enough, so I used 1 & 3/4 cups of brown sugar rather than the 1 & 1/3 cups of white sugar.

I'm also used to baking bread in a bread machine, so I don't actually have loaf pans.  I used the loaf pan from my bread machine, which is narrow and tall, and ended up having to bake for about 90 mins.

But this bread is moist, bananalicious, and awesome.  Thanks!!!

I had a request for banana bread at the 11th hour last night and I quickly thought of this bread---I have made it before and it is the only banana bread my husband has requested again! So that in my book earns 5 stars! Thanks, Cathy! Great way to use up some of that holiday sour cream that we over-stocked...(:

This bread was very good and moist. I added some nutmeg and cinnamon for a little extra flavor and I would recomend that. I also used a little more banana than called for, more banana is always a good thing. :) I will make this again.

This was a great recipe! It was very moist and tasty. I did use 2 cups mashed bananas and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar.I baked it in a bundt pan and coated it with cinammon sugar. The cinnamon sugar burned a little bit but it was because I cooked it a little too long. I should have cooked it for about 40 minutes, but it was still good.

I really like the texture, very moist - but I felt it lacked spices.  I ended up adding more banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, & even some cardamom.  I cut back a little on the white sugar & added some brown sugar.  Made them into muffins & topped with granola.  With my modifications, this banana bread turned out really well.  A good starter recipe.

FANTASTIC, I substituted margarine for equal amount of apple sauce and I used fat free sour cream for a fat free version, I also used 1 cup splenda and 1/3 brown sugar splenda to keep it sugar free. It was AMAZING. So moist, the whole family inhaled these.

When I saw that there was sour cream in this recipe, I knew it had to be good. I was right! I have tried a lot of banana bread recipes and none have really impressed me, until now. I baked mine in a bundt cake pan for 40 minutes. Perfect! The only change I would make is to use more bananas.

I just cut my first slice of this bread and it is out of this world. Holds together really well, lots of yummy flavor in this bread. It is a rainy day and this bread just hits the spot.

I LOVE this recipe! I have used it dozens of times and it always turns out great. I usually use nonfat sour cream to lower the fat (it tastes the same!), but occasionally add walnuts or chocolate chips. I make them into muffins, and they are a huge hit at home and at the office!

Excellent, expecially following other suggestions with the cinnamon/sugar on the bottom of the pan. The sour cream makes it very moist. I also add the 1 cup of chocolate chips. Very tasty! We buy bananas just so they can over ripe for this!

I loved this recipe.  I used plain non-fat yogurt instead of sour cream and it still turned out delicious and very moist.  Next time I will add walnuts!

Made this bread and it tastes great.  The bread came out of the oven looking perfect, but after cooling it seemed to collapse a bit.  Any idea what I'm doing wrong?

My favorite one so far.  Very flavorful and moist.  Put it in a bundt cake pan and it turned out great, cooking time only about 40 minutes.  I also loved the idea of using cinnamon/sugar instead of flouring..what a nice touch!!

Absolutely terrific. Made it exact to recipe with the exception I added 2 bananas instead of one.  We like a good banana flavor.  Made it in two foil pans 2 1/2" x 6". No running over the pans, not sticky, just right and delicious. I forgot to add the chopped nuts to my batter, so sprinkled on the nuts and sugar after they were in the pans.  A real keeper. Thank you, Cathy.

Pretty good and easy recipe.  I like the texture and it was nice and moist.  I only felt it lacked a little flavor, maybe I'd add more bananas next time.

Fabulous! I loved that this used sour cream instead of oils. My husband and son loved it- it was super moist and had just the right amount of banana flavor. It was easy for my 4 year old to help make, and eat!

A very moist and tasty banana bread.  I substituted 2/3 brown sugar and 2/3 white sugar as suggested.  The bundt cake pan worked well.  I thought it was sweet enough on its own, but my husband liked it even better with sour cream icing.

This bread really is amazing. Incredibly moist, flavorful and delicious. My husband and I practically ate half the loaf right after it came out of the oven (which is why I suggest using light sour cream...or maybe greek yoghurt)

This is soooooo yummy!  I didn't have a loaf pan, so I used a 9x13 and found that 35 minutes at 350 degrees was perfect.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  It took 3 overripe bananas for me to get the 1 cup mashed.  I will DEFINATELY make this again!

I combined brown sugar (approx 2-3 Tbsp) with cinnamon (approx 1 tsp), ground cloves (approx 1/2 tsp), and ground nutmeg (approx 1/2 tsp). I then sprinkled this mixture over the top of the loaves before I baked them. It made a nice sweet crispy topping for this amazing recipe.

This is absolutely perfect.  I've baked the recipe twice, once following the recipe to a 'T' and the other time adding one cup of chocolate chips.  Either way it was fabulous!  Definitely adding this to my recipe box.

I took other's advice and made mine in a 9x13 - it only took about 30 mins to bake, though.  I used 3 bananas, brown sugar instead of white, and iced with cream cheese icing from this site, then sprinkled with nuts.  Everybody loved it!  Thanks.

Another 5 Star recipe.  Absolutely NO changes, no brown sugar, no cinnamon, no changes. Been looking a long time and I have to guess the sour creme is the secret.  Any recipe I've tried that uses sour creme in the baking seems to make it sooo tender and tasty.  I gave this as Christmas presents done in 4 mini pans per recipe.  Freezes beautifully.  Thanks Cathy, my search is over.

I made these in giant muffin cups. They turned out perfect! All 12 muffins were eaten by me and my fiance as soon as they came out of the oven. They were moist and not too banana-ey. I added almonds on the top for decoration. They are beautiful too.

I followed the instructions, and made no changes except that I used whole wheat flour and added chocolate chips. I personally didn't care for this recipe. It didn't rise, tasted bland, and even though I greased my pan it stuck and fell apart. I also used another recipe from this site today and we taste tested the two. The other one turned out prettier loaves and had more flavor and tasted better.

Fantastic! I have tried so many different banana bread recipes and have never found the “right one”, until now! This bread is super moist. I too made this with 3 bananas and just dumped everything one at a time into the electric mixer. I made two loaves one with nuts and one with out. This is a keeper, will be making it every time I have a hankering for some banana bread!

This was good, tasted just like regular ol' banana bread. Nothing special. Make sure you don't leave it in the full 50 minutes b/c mine was dry.

This was my first banana bread.  It turned out very moist and delicious and I gave one to a friend as a present.  I added chocolate chips to mine and I'm glad I did.  I'm copying this recipe down for future use!

Wonderful, moist banana bread! Also try 8oz cream cheese instead of sour cream.

So moist and delicious. I used butter instead of margarine only b/c I didnt have any margarine on hand. I will definitely add this to my recipe collection. I used the 9x13 inch pan and baked for about 35 minutes. Very tasty.

Added 1/4 t each of ginger, cloves, nutmeg and 1/2 t cinnamon to add a bit of spice.  I also subbed fat free plain yogurt for the sour cream and they turned out good - much lighter and fluffier than other banana breads I've made.

I have tried several recipes for banana bread and this is by far the best I've ever had!  It is wonderful!  I used light sour cream and added chocolate chips and nuts to mine.  Thank you for a terrific recipe!

This was an excellent recipe, I've made it twice.  As a rule, I bake with butter instead of margarine... not sure if that makes a difference.  The second time I made this I added dried blueberries and it came out perfect.  This is a great recipe as is, but adding dried cranberries, blueberries, apricots, etc. works great, too.  Love this recipe!

I chose to make this recipe because I had only 2 ripe bananas and most recipes call for 3 or 4.  I'm glad I made it because it's fantastic.  The best banana bread I've ever had.  It is lighter and a bit cake-like.  I have also made muffins from this but baked them for only 20 minutes.

Oh my!!  I have made a lot of banana bread in my day...but none even begin to come close to this recipe.  I added more than 1 cup of banana, I didn't really measure, I just used 3 large bananas and the bread was so delicious and moist.  I will NEVER use another B Bread recipe again in my life - thank you so much Cathy!!

if i could give this ten stars i would.  absolutely delicious!!  the sour cream makes it so moist.  i took other's advice and added a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg.      measure the bananas (3 medium bananas = 1 cup mashed) or the bread won't cook all the way through.

This was terrible. I followed the directions perfectly.  When I took it out of the oven the bread looked great.  Then 5 minutes later the entire middle had sunk down to 1/2 inch high.  When I tested it before I removed it from the oven the pick came out clean.  Don't make this.

This banana bread is awesome! I've tried many recipes on this website and this is the best I've tried in a long time! It has more fluffy/less dense texture than most banana breads. I used reduced fat margerine and no fat sour cream-It turned out excellent. Also I only had a 9x6 loaf pan so I used the remaining batter to make banana muffins-I just took the muffins out of the oven ten minutes before the bread-the muffins are awesome too!

***** Yummy! I made this recipe twice in mini pans reducing the baking time. The 1st time I added a cup of pecans, the 2nd time I added pecans & one chopped apple then spinkled crumb top on before baking. The possibilities are endless with a base recipe this good, who knows, next time maybe pineapple & coconut or white choc chips....  Highly recommend - 5 stars!!!

I made this bread along with two others from this website.  It was good, and I would definitely make it again, but it was just a little too sweet for me.  It had a nice, moist, fluffy texture, though.

Just like Cathy promised, moist and delicious.  I used very over-ripe bananas, cut sugar to 1 cup.  Used only 1 9x5 loaf pan.  Bread was great, easily replaces the Betty Crocker standard I've used for 20 years.

Scrumpious!!! I added 1/8 tsp nutmeg and could have added more. I also sprinkled some on top. Next time I'll cut the sugar down to 1 cup as I'm not big on sweet stuff but I'm sure most would prefer this amount. My boyfriend says it's the best he's had!!!

If you're looking for a moist cake-like texture, then this is your recipe.  It's also lighter in color than other banana breads I've tried. I would suggest adding an extra banana for richer flavor. Tastes great warm with butter.

OH MY GOD!!! This recipe was soooo awesome. I've never made real banana bread before, always bought the store box bread, and I will never buy them again. This was so good. I used extra banana - about 1-3/4 cups and it was great. I think the sour cream makes a big difference in keeping it so moist. Thank you so much. It was gone in a day.

I have been making the same banana bread for years but this will be the recipe I use from now on! Very tasty and moist. I used shortening instead of butter or margarine because that's what I had on hand and it came out great!

I loved making this.  It's full of flavor and came out very moist.  I made it exactly as it was and I wouldn't change a thing except the time it took to cook was a little less so I'd suggest watching it closely around the 45 minute mark.

This banana bread is the best and most moist that I have ever eaten. I am sure it has something to do with that special ingredient, sour cream!!!! I will be purposely letting bananas over ripen just so I can make this delicious bread again and again!!!

Excellent taste but my oven only took 42 mins for 2 loaves. I smelled that they were done and quickly pulled them out. I would only bake for 40 next time.

Gotta say, i have been making this for over 4/5 years now. It is absolutely the best banana bread recipe I've ever used. I've used quite a few. I'm going to try to make muffins tonight with this recipe and a crumble topping, I'll let you know how it goes.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This is very good as written and will make again trying some other ideas written in other ratings. I had bananas I wanted to get rid of but did not want to go to a lot of work ,so I made the entire batter in my Cuisinart food processor. It turned out great! Not tough at all.  I also made in 9x13 inch pan. A previous reviewer mentioned to lessen the bake time to 25 minutes. Glad I read that one as it was perfect.

First time to make this so used the recipe as is but added pecans. I got interrupted in the making so left out the salt so it affected the rising a bit but the flavor is still surprisingly good. Moist, delicious and easy. Will make again. May add the sugar dusting mentioned in another comment so it’s pretty for holiday giving.

Very good and moist.  I added walnuts to it, but otherwise used the same proportions and ingredients.  I've also added cinnamon powder in the past, and enjoyed that too.

I made this but used 1/3 cup of the sugar as brown sugar, used half cup of sour cream and half cup of chunky peanut butter, used buttermilk pioneer baking mix instead of flour and baking soda, and poured into muffin pans instead of loaves, and they are the best my family has ever eaten, thanks for the wonderful recipe.

wonderful! I use 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the margarine (one of those individual serving cups) and it turns out so moist and amazing! Don't be scared to try it! Also, I add 1 tsp of cinnamon and a cup of walnuts. bake in a 9 by 13 around 30 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.

This recipe is delicious! Instead of 1 cup of sour cream, I substituted 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt. I also added 1 cup finely chopped pecans! Amazing!! I baked in a 9x5x3 loaf pan. It took 10 extra minutes. Very moist and sweet. Will be using this one again!

This really came out good.  I read some of the reviews and made some changes based on what I had in the house... I used 3 bananas; vanilla yogurt and a spoonful of lite cream cheese that I had left over in the fridge (instead of the sour cream) and added walnuts and chocolate chips.  Will make it again!

This is a good Banana bread recipe.  I changed a couple things to cut fat and sugar by using Trivia baking sugar instead and cut the butter in half and sour cream in half then added Apple sauce.  I also added walnuts.   Very moist and delicious bread.

The first time I made this recipe I didn't have any sour cream so I made with 0% Fage yogurt probably about a 1/2 Cup and I always split any sugar ingredients into 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Came out good, had to cook a little longer that the suggested 50 minutes but was good.  

the second time I made it I went out and got sour cream..a full cup seemed too much but I followed the recipe anyway.  I cooked it for the  full 50 minutes plus another 5-6 because after inserting a tooth pick it was still coming out with uncooked batter on it.  My husband just tried it and liked it but was under cooked in the middle.  Even though it was cooled, I've stuck back in oven to see if I can still cook it so its not under-cooked in the middle...maybe, maybe not, but I'll have to toss either way so might as well try it.
P.S.  Also used butter (never use margarine) and probably a bit more banana (3 medium bananas)

The phone rang when I was in the middle of measuring the flour.  So I think hampered the taste.  I have three more bananas so I'm going to try again.  I love the sour cream in it.  Very moist and made two nice loafs!

This is the best batch of banana bread I have ever made! It is so moist and delicious. The spices give us such a nice little flavor that is just the best. The only thing I did a little different was add some chocolate chips cause my family likes that. The top is a little more flat looking than my older version of my banana bread. But the taste is really amazing

This is so awesome! I love to make quick breads and this is going down as one of my favorites! I made two changes the second time around. I diced peaches and threw them in and I used half white and half brown sugar. This is probably one of the prettiest loaves of bread I have ever made. I will definitely be making it again! I also love the versatility with this recipe. No matter what you add it comes out amazing! Thank you Cathy!

Very moist. I made it in a 13x9 inch pan but removed it from the oven after 30 minutes. Only substitution was yogurt which I had on hand for sour cream

The best recipe ever!  Yummy.  The only problem I had was that both loaves fell.  I live in Denver and the altitude is 5280 ft above sea level.  I don't know if it was that, but I don't usually have this problem.

I made this recipe with a few personal touches/ changes; 1) I put about 1 1/4c sugar and 3/4c brown sugar. 2) I used three overripe bananas and 3/4c sour cream. 3) 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. 3) I added about 1 1/2 tbp cinnamon.. I also used two 7x3 pans (one at a time about 40 mins ea).  And about 20 mins in I topped with about 3 tbp oatmeal ea. 
It turned out amazing!!

It was tasty and easy to make but not the best banana bread I've ever made. I couldn't find my moms recipe so I tried this one. It came out pretty dry and I feel like it definitely needed nuts or chocolate chips to give it something extra. It also could have used more than a cup of bananas. That being said, it is a solid recipe to use and tweak how you like.

I added about about a 1\4 cup more banana because that's what I had left. This recipe came out beautiful. The sour cream kept it nice and moist. I am just about to go to the kitchen and make it again because my husband and Daughter wiped the first one out.

Delightful recipe for a rich, moist banana bread.  It is quite sweet and the second time I made it I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup instead of 1 1/3.  I would likely reduce it further next time, but that is a personal taste, not a critique of the recipe.  It is a seriously good banana bread.  I want to try it with walnuts next time!

Getting ready to make this again. Loved It! I took advice from prior reviews and used vanilla yogurt in place of the sour cream. Used a half cup of white sugar and half cup of light brown sugar, added walnuts. Delish!!

Hands down best banana bread I've ever tasted, let alone made myself.  Dense but not heavy, incredibly moist, and with a fantastic banana flavor.  I didn't detect any tanginess from the sour cream (I'm guessing that might vary depending on your brand), just moist yumminess!  I made very minor changes that honestly didn't probably affect the outcome much - butter instead of margarine, double the salt, and a smidge over the amount of bananas, because that's how it worked out when I mashed them :)  I also baked in an 8.5x4.5 glass loaf pan (the only loaf pan I own!) for around 45-50 minutes.  I also greased but did not flour the pan.  A DEFINITE keeper!

Made as is. The taste was fine but the texture was off. It had a dry chewy texture where you would expect a moist texture. Think I'll stick to other banana bread recipes next time.

Yum! A few changes: applesauce instead of margarine, only 3/4 cup brown sugar, and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg per other reviewers.

Everyone in the house loved it!  Followed directions exactly and it came out super moist.  Baking time was less than 50 min. though, just set a timer for 35-40 min and keep an eye on it.

this recipe is very very good! I made one recipe of gluten free. this is what I changed to make it gluten free. for the two cups of flour I used 1 2/3 cup rice flour, 1/3 cup cornstarch, and 1 1/2 tsp xanthan gum. I also cut down the sugar by 1/3 cup. I did follow what the other reviewers mentioned about the temperature one the oven. I baked it for 10 minutes on 450° then turned it down to 350° for the rest of the time. I would definitely make this again. I also have made one batch of this 'regular' to give to my neighbors. the only thing I changed was to add 3 tsp ground flax and cut down on the sugar. they loved it too!

Yes, followed to a T! Added favorite chopped walnuts 1+c. And 1/2 teas cinnamon 1/4 nutmeg. Also inside each loaf I placed a few blueberries in the middle then added the rest of the dough on top! The pan is four 4 loaves baked 350 degrees 35 minutes tested for doneness.
Used non dairy sour cream and earth balance margarine.

This is amazing. I love banana bread so this was great. I used Greek yogurt instead or sour cream and I used 4 bananas  (because they were getting old) which was probably more than 1 cup. Will definitely make again! I also added walnuts because I like them.

Good basic recipe as far as the ingredients listed. That's why I gave it 5 stars.  Since some of you wonder about the  high rating when modifications are made, modifications are for personal taste preferences and what the cook has on hand.  
Modifications: substituting  yogurt for the sour cream (I do think the sour cream would have been good though), used 1 C white and 1 C whole wheat,   used 3 bananas.  ( I did not want to mess with mashing and measuring.)  Cut the sugar to 1 cup.  Sprinkling a bit of sugar on the bread or muffins before baking will give these muffins or bread a nice crunch.  I used a mini muffin pan.  15 minutes for bake time was perfect.  I had some batter left over so I used a small cast iron skillet to make a wonderful muffin top!  
Wonderfully moist with great flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I sought a particular recipe because I only had one ripe banana which is about 4 oz, so I split the recipe in half.  The recipe asks for margarine, and I used butter.  I don't buy margarine.  I also added 1 cup pecans, I would have preferred walnuts, but I was out.   My hubby and daughter both said that the bread was excellent.  I'm an avid baker and have baked a lot of banana bread and this recipe is the one I will be using as long as I have sour cream. I'm not sure why it even got low reviews, but it sounds like the batter was over mixed.  That will ruin just about all bread recipes.

Used whole yogurt instead of sour cream. Added the 2nd cup of bananas as Mimialea recommended and baked in two 9x9 glass dishes so they are pretty thin - cooked in 35 minutes in a convection oven. Smells pretty darn good - we shall see! The dishes are a standard 3 inches deep, what would have happened if I baked it all in one? Would it have taken the 50 min?

I make a banana baked item once a week and this recipie was tremendous!   Very moist and yet crusty on the edges.   I baked the whole recipe in a medium spring form pan lined with parchment paper and then cut out pie shaped slices.   It didn't last long; it was so good.

I've made this several times and it always comes out great.  Have substituted some mashed canned peaches for half of the banana when I've been low on bananas and it tastes delicious.  The kids like it with chocolate chips added!  Family favorite!

This is great! I used 4 large over ripe bananas and used 2/3 brown sugar and 2/3 white sugar. I also dusted the two 7x4 pans with cinnamon sugar as another suggested and added a bit of nutmeg. It took 50 mins at 350.

This is my new favorite banana bread. I had the traditional loaf pans ready and decided to make it in a 9X13 at the last minute. I also mixed 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 TBS flour, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 2 TBS melted butter and 1/4 cup sliced almonds and sprinkled on top. YUM! This is more cakes then ready in my opinion and the 9X13 suits it very well.  I found it to be done in 35-40 minutes in the 9X13.

This was wonderful! I changed just a few things based on reviews. Real butter, 1/2c  vanilla Greek yogurt and 1/2c light sour cream, 1 cup of white sugar with 1/2c  brown sugar and a little cinnamon.

I doubled the recipe (because I had an entire bunch of bananas about to go bad) and added cinnamon and cloves like other reviewers suggested.  It made four loaves of heavenly scrumptiousness!

With this recipe I probably just made the best banana bread in my life.
I did read other reviews first and I used 1 cup of Brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar. I also substuded real butter for the margerin.
My husband eat half the load as soon as it was cool enough to eat.

I made this recipe quite by accident -- I was looking at another recipe that called for 1/2 cup sour cream. When I was making that recipe, I accidentally measured out 1 cup of sour cream. I had already put it in my banana puree, so I quickly had to find a recipe that used that amount of sour cream without changing the other ingredients too much. This one fit the bill, so I made it. 

I used four very ripe (almost black) bananas, and I pureed them using my hand blender. I do NOT like chunks of banana in my bread, so I like for the banana to be velvety smooth. In a liquid measuring cup, the puree equaled exactly 1 cup . I used a half a cup of dark brown sugar and about a half cup of white sugar. When I tasted the batter it didn't taste quite sweet enough, so I added about a  tablespoon of light brown sugar. I also added in a couple shakes of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I also used butter for margarine.

I baked the bread in unlined, greased (with baking spray) cupcake tins. It made 18 muffins, and they were finished in about 20 minutes.

I was worried that the sour cream would overpower the banana, but I could taste it in the batter and the final product. They also have a distinct banana smell. The muffins were tender and especially delicious straight from the oven -- they were melt-in-your mouth moist. My husband and I quickly ate four between the two of us. He raved over it. The next day, I found them a little gummier, but still delicious. They are sweet, and I could hav

Used whole white wheat flour, 1 c brown sugar + 1/2 white sugar,  added 1 tsp cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, dash of cayenne pepper,  used 3 large bananas which was more than the 1 cup called for, used butter,  added semi-sweet chocolate chips and walnuts. Cooked at 400 for 7 min, then turned down to 340 for 50 min. Came out perfect.  Best banana bread recipe I've tried so far.

This makes a nice moist banana bread. I adjusted the recipe a bit by added dates, cinnamon and reducing the sugar content to half a cup. Dates and cinnamon add a nice flavour and less sugar makes it much better for you.

Wow! So Good! I didn't have any sour cream so I just used 1/2 cup milk and it came out great. I just put some butter on it and sprinkled some salt on it, Mmm. Thank You for this recipe :) Can't wait to try it with sour cream and maybe some other ingredients other people are mentioning.

It was light, not heavy and dry.  My husband and family just loved it!! the only changes I made were pure coconut oil ( lard like, then softened) instead of butter and 1 1/2 cups bananas.  it was so good I had to made 2 bat ches!!

I have been using this terrific recipe since I found it 2 years ago.  I like that it makes 2 loaves. Sometimes I will replace the margarine with cream cheese or for the sour cream.  I find it very forgiving. Always always add big handful of chocolate chips. I use what ever amount of bananas I have on hand as well. I have put large crystal demerrea sugar or cinnamon and sugar on the top for a nice crunch.

The sour cream gives this bread a subtle bite to combat the sweetness.  I love nuts so I added 1 C chopped pecans. I also add a splash of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  This recipe has replaced my tried and true from Betty Crocker Cookbook.

I've made it several times, and have only used butter instead of margarine.  My family loves it! Great recipe overall.

The basic recipe is a great start.  I only added cinnamon nutmeg and cloves.  The bread came out perfect. I made two loaves by doubling the recipe.

Yes, rave reviews. Moist, flaky, and oh so scrumptious! This as in everything I make is done for those and those who care about me. Add more bananas and used butter. It is not your everyday, but as a special treat-I love it!

Best banana bread by far. I've been. A king this recipe for many years and it has always been a success. I've too substituted the butter for Apple sauce and the sour cream for yogurt. It's un believable how moist and taste this bread turns out. It never last more tha. A day in my house!

Just wanted to say I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and used coconut palm sugar instead of white sugar (same amounts for each), and it was a hit!  The added chocolate chips and walnuts probably helped as well.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this for my dad few years ago and he loved it! Now, for the hubs, and he is insane about it. It tastes better every single time!!! I agree with the comments, use 1 cup brown sugar and .5 cup white. It literally tastes better. Also, I like my banana bread lightly sweetened. If you prefer that as well, use the light yellow color bananas, not exactly ripe.

Very good i lost this recipe a while back.  Im just glad i was able to find it again.  I use instead of sour cream buttermilk or 1c milk with 1 tbs vingar or lemon juice to make buttermilk.  Its the most moist banana bread ive ever had.

Great recipe! I don't use margarine, so I used butter instead. I didn't have sour cream in my fridge so I subbed in Greek yogurt, even better. FYI, Greek yogurt is a great sub for anything that needs sour cream, plus it has more benefits. I also threw a dash of cinnamon and brown sugar, in addition to the white sugar. It came out great!

Delicious!  I make banana bread often but just made this and my husband got home from work, tasted and just said this was the best bread I ever made.  Thanks Cathy!!  I did use whole wheat flour and 6 small'ish bananas so after mashed it was a little more than a cup.  I also added a very small dash of nutmeg and cinnamon.  I made 4 small loaves and added mini-chocolate chips to two of my loaves.

Made for the first time and came out delicious. We added walnuts and raisins for extra textures and flavors. Also used unprocessed cane sugar. Was a favorite with the whole family.

Great Recipe!  I have tried others and they are not as good as this one!  THank you so much for sharing.  I have followed exactly the recipe but added walnuts to the ingredients.  It made the house smell sooooo good!

I grow my own bananas and I make this everytime they are ripe. Sometimes I add nuts or chocolate child. Or even homemade grsnola. This recipe works everytime.

If you are looking for an easy, simple banana bread recipe that is moist and stays true to the banana flavor this is IT! This recipe takes more time to prepare since you don't just mash the bananas and throw it all in the bowl and mix it up. The end result is an amazingly moist bread with a slightly crunchy/chewy crust. I cooked it at 350 in a 9x5" bread pan. The batter prepared as above filled 1 whole 9x5" bread pan instead of 2 smaller 7x3" that the original poster wanted. It did take about 75 minutes to bake all the way through. ( 1 hr 10 mins ) For those who complained about it not being cooked inside but the outside was done, just add foil over the top if you need to cook it an extra 20 mins beyond what the recipe calls for. It will keep the top of your bread from burning while allowing you more time to cook the inside. Def recommend this recipe though next time I will add my own tweaks to it, perhaps a layer of chocolate chips in the middle or some cocoa added to it to make it chocolate banana bread, etc. it's a good foundation for a banana bread if you don't mind taking the extra steps to prep it. :)

This was a very easy recipe and came out so soft and moist! One thing i really liked compared to other banana bread recipes i have made is this one bakes a pretty light color. All the other recipes always come out dark looking. My 3 year old was able to help mash the bananas and stir the ingredients which tells you how easy it is! We both loved the finished results!!!

Yum! I did modify it. Only used 1/2 the sugar, added 3 ripe bananas, semi sweet chocolate chips (I double the batch so I used one whole bag), i love almonds so i used those instead and 1 1/2 cups of frozen blue berries! Yum!

My first time trying banana bread so it could have been me not adding enough of something but it was ok. I followed the recipe as is and it didn't do it for me. I still found myself craving my mom's banana bread. I will try again but with another recipe.

Today is the 2nd time I've made this recipe and my whole family loves it! The only issue I have is that when baking it at 350 it take about 1.5-1.75 hours to fully bake otherwise it tastes really good and is very moist! I didn't change the recipe at all

I was looking for a fluffy tasty version of banana bread.  I found it in this recipe!  I exchanged 1/3 of sugar for Splenda. And used real butter and not margarine. And increased nuts to 1/2 cup.  Best I've ever had.

Really moist and good! I did add a little nutmeg and cinnamon for more flavor. I used 2 medium sized bananas so I think it was probably 1 and 1/2 cups.

We love this recipe too and I do the substitutions that were recommended. I use butter, Greek yogurt in lieu of margarine and sour cream and cut the sugar ....1 cup instead of 1 and 1/4.

This is just wonderful! I have made this banana bread many times and it turns out great every time! My husband just loves it. The only changes I made was Butter instead of margarine and reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup. The ingredients are basic and easily available in the Dominican Republic where we winter and often end up with overripe bananas.

This came out SUPREME. I rushed it, had 2 old bananas, used butter instead of margarine and also added 1/4 cup of cocoa to chocolatize it.  Greased with spray oil.  The sour cream really makes it.  Added 10 minutes to time to firm it up.  After cooling some, it dropped right out of a pyrex loaf pan.  Served with brandy butter and vanilla ice cream.   A keeper.

BEST EVER!! I make this by myself all the time! My family loves it and I even make it as gifts and on holidays. Sometimes I add chocolate chips! If I don't have any sour cream, I use regular yogurt, tastes the same and is SOO moist! Love it!

Better banana bread I have tried on here,  I did add a little more bananas, but I always up the banana. My family loved it too. I also did a batch with chic chips.  Mmmm,Mmmm.  You can't taste the sour cream, it was a great addition for moistness, and this bread is moist.  Saved this recipe and will use every time now.

Only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine... I never buy margarine.  I made 24 muffins.  Next time I'll add some nuts & coconut, perhaps chocolate chips...I like that these seem lighter than some of the recipes for dense, heavy muffins.

I've been wanting to try a sour cream banana bread for a while to see how it compares to my regular recipe, which uses oil. It was good, but not great enough to deter me from my go-to recipe. Since sour cream isn't something I keep on hand (like oil), I'll probably stick with my regular recipe.

Pretty good, although the crust was a bit crumbly.  Good flavor.

This is an excellent recipe.  Very light and moist.  I kept recipe the same, except I added 1 1/2 cups banana and also added cinnamon.  I baked it in two loaf pans and it took about 45 minutes.  I will be making it again soon!!

I specifically looked for a recipe that had sour cream because I find them more moist.  I love banana bread and mine turned out great.  The only changes I will make next time will be one more banana and try 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.

absolutely delish. chopped pecans on top are a fabulous addition. I also added banana nectar to the mashed banana to top off the cup just because. adds a nice banana sweetness if you're bananas are not quite brown enough. mmmmm....

I used fat free sour cream and I added a crumb topping (from the banana crumb muffins recipe on this website). This banana bread was so moist and flavorful!

This is THE BEST banana bread recipe!!! It stays moist from the first slice to the last.  I made it in a bundt pan and added 2/3 cup chopped pecans for the same time mentioned and it turned out perfectly!  I will ALWAYS use this recipe!  THE BEST! Thanks!

Great recipe- very moist! The first time I tried it with 2 bananas and it turned out perfectly. The second time I tried it with 3 and the bread was just too moist and mushy. I will stick to 2 and plan to make this as often as I can! It was very popular

I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it was overdone when I checked at 40 mins.  I used 1c loosely packed brown sugar instead of white and half the flour was whole wheat.  I also used butter. I like that it had so little fat.

I love this recipe because I didnt feel like I could change things and it wouldn't be ruined....I used 2 ripe bananas, 1 cup yogurt (I didnt have sour cream), 1/4 c oil instead of margerine, 3/4 c brown sugar and 1/3 c white sugar, and a dash of pumpkin pie spice....this was so moist and flavorful and the banana flavor was PERFECT....thanks for the recipe

I've been making this for years and it always turns out wonderful. I always use light sour cream and add extra banana. I like to make them in a muffin pan so that I can easily freeze for quick snacks. Note: Freeze quickly before everyone gobbles them up, lol. Today I added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips for the kids. YUM!

Wonderful texture and fantastic flavor, even better the next day.  I made it exactly as the recipe and baked it in a Bundt pan for easy slicing.  I'll definitely do this again.  The Bundt pan is a great idea, but do check for carefully to make sure it is done.

I use splenda, and margarine as well as low fat or no fat sour cream.  I also use a little bit of banana extract to ensure a nice Banana taste! and this is the best banana bread I have ever had.  Even better than regular sugar ones!

The baking time was way off for a 9 x 13 pan.  My bread only took about 30 minutes.  I thought the taste was good, but not great.

This is 5 stars as is-- but the second time I revised with the following: Sugar- did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white.  I substituted 1/2 the sour cream with 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt--- and since I completely forgot I was out of Vanilla extract I used almond.  I've also always added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to my breads.  These changes made it so decadently rich and wonderful--- I will never make another!!!

This turns out really light and tasty. I double the bananas so it's more moist. Sliiiightly spongy but tastes great.

We absolutely love this banana bread recipe and make it often, probably twice a month. It seems unusual to have banana bread out of a 9 X 13 pan instead of loaf pan, but you just get more that way! We don't change anything about the recipe.  We find the best combo of bananas to use is about half really ripe and half not too ripe. Great bread!

Very moist, tender recipe. I use yogurt instead of sour cream, and cut the sugar to 1 cup. Tossing in a half cup of chopped walnuts was a very nice addition as well.

Cut back on the sugar and it's 5 stars but as is, 4. I doubled everything, replaced the sugar with brown sugar, and it only needed 1 cup [for a double batch].  Other editions were 2 packets of banana nut oatmeal, 1/2 cup applesauce, 2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp. more baking powder to make up for the added heavyness. No neeeed for these editions though, i just have a habit of throwing in everything but the kitchen sink in recipes.

This is the ABSOLUTE best banana bread recipe I have ever made.  I make it with cake flour for Banana Cake and I make it with a combination of whole wheat and white flour for Banana Bread and add other ingredients like flax seed and walnuts for texture and fibre. Thanks!

This is my husband's favorite recipe.  The sour cream gives it a nice kick. Sometimes we add nuts as well if we have some leftover from other recipes. Always moist and is even good frozen and rethawed at a later time.

This is an excellent recipe.  I tweaked it a little, though.  I used whole wheat flour, more banana, about 3/4 cup sugar, plus a tiny bit of honey (maybe a tablespoon), chopped walnuts, and LOTS of chocolate chips.  I've also learned to butter and sugar (instead of flour) pans.  It makes the crust carmelized and crispy.  YUM!

Super yummy, dense and spongy.  I wanted a recipe that used sour cream and gave this a try and it was a hit.  I made it in a hurry so perhaps that's why mine didn't rise much but that didn't matter.  My hubby gave it his seal of approval saying that it was "pretty  tasty!"  this bread wasn't dry at all, really moist and dense and delish.

I didn't like this banana bread as much as I expected to. I followed the recipe except that I added 10 minutes to the baking time. The bread is very moist, but the sour cream flavor seems to cancel out some of the banana flavor. My husband likes it well enough and it is good, just not great.

Substituted butter for margarine, added 1 additional cup of banana, 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp of cinnamon. Used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar. Baked in 2 8x4 pans for 45 minutes. Delicious!

I love it!  This is my new recipe!  The best recipe I'd tried before had A LOT of butter in it, and the others were too dry.  This is so moist and delicious, and much healthier!  I used reduced fat sour cream, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and replaced 1/2 the margarine with applesauce (as another reviewer suggested) and it's great!  I think next time I'll replace all the margarine, use 1 cup whole wheat flour, and add some walnuts.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

Hmmmm.  Well, this came out just fine.  I greased my 9X13 pan, but did not flour it, and the banana bread came out perfectly.  The texture is just too cakey for me.  I prefer a traditional texture (like zucchini or pumpkin bread has).  Oh well.

I like recipes you can muck around with and they still turn out good. I never have sour cream on hand so I used plain yogurt instead. Followed the other reviewer's advice and used brown sugar, but only used 2/3 cup -- however I think most people would prefer to stay with at least 1 c of sugar. Baked the bread in my 6 mini-bundt loaf pan for about 40 minutes; very tasty and light bread. Keeper recipe and I'll enjoy making future modifications (e.g. adding nuts, chocolate or coconut flakes next time).

Great tasting banana bread, but a little dry.  I wanted to try the original recipe first to give it a chance.  Next time I will use 3 bananas as suggested by other reviewers.  Plus, I used 2 dark Wilton loaf pans...I will reduce the temp to 325 (I knew that I should do this with darker pans but I still wanted to follow the original instructions). It didn't rise much (and I had fresh ingredients), so next time I will fill only one pan 3/4 full and use the leftover batter to make a few muffins.  Another reviewer suggested using 2 smaller pans and that would work as well. My mom uses a recipe very similar to this but puts a cinnamon-brown sugar-butter streusel in the middle and everyone raves over her banana bread.  She doesn't measure so this is the closest thing for me to hers.  Thanks for the recipe - I'll definitely try it again, with the tips from the other reviewers.

YUMMY!!  My whole family gobbled it up as soon as it left the oven.  It is really good.  So moist and I added a extra banana in there to make it extra tasty and sweet.

I have been making banana bread for years.  I was at my daughters in California and went on all recipes to look for a banana bread recipe and came across this one.  This is THE only bb recipe I will ever use.  It is FABULOUS!!!

Yummy! Moist and comforting. I cut the sugar as some reviewers suggested and added cinnamon. Next time I will top with a topping made of lemon and confectionary sugar.

Great recipe!  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 white and only 1 cup sugar and baked in in a bundt pan.  It was delicious!

I have made this recipe a number of times. Each and every time I make it, I get great compliments. I always get asked to make this whenever I am asked over for dinner at my friends place. My whole family enjoys this recipe. 

Instead of nuts I put in dark chocolate chips. 

This is the BEST banana bread recipe I have ever made. 

Actually, in a few minutes I will be going to go and make 2 loaves now.

Enjoy all.

I used 2/3 cup Tofutti sour supreme (can't have reg milk) and added 1 cup of walnuts.  The color/texture/flavor was perfect! (even better day 2). I baked it in a four-loaf nordicware pan and they carried the design beautifully.

Yes, this is definitely one of the better recipes for banana breads.   If I do not have sour cream I substitute buttermilk with good results, but not regular milk soured (not enough body).  Tastes more like banada cake and can be served as a dessert if necessary.

I thought this recipe was bland, even after I added cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. The consistency was more like a cake than a bread. I still give it 3 stars because it wasn't bad, and even as I type this, I'm craving another slice. Funny how that works!

I think this is a great recipe, I followed DiversWife suggestions and made it in a bundt pan with 1/2 c. of hickory nuts.  It baked for 40 minutes and was incredibly moist the next morning.  I got a lot of compliments!  I'll do it again, next time w/ a t. of cinnamon!

I used 1/2 the sugar listed, since bananas are sweet as well. Also used brown sugar. I swapped cake flour for all purpose, since I like a more tender texture, and added 1/2 cup walnuts and raisins, as well as 1 tsp of cinnamon. It smelled so nice when baking, I can't wait to see how it tastes tomorrow! (quickbreads usually taste better when allowed to sit overnight.)

I was disappointed with this. Couldn't taste the sour cream or the bananas and it was not especially moist. 3 stars because my husband and daughter did like it. Made it in the bundt pan as shown.

Excellent Recipe! Perfectly moist everytime!  The only thing I change is that I only use 3/4 cup of sugar as I don't like it as sweet :)

I started making this bread for my sister when she was pregnant with her 4th and she couldn't get enough of it.  Everyone at work wants the recipe.  Certainly a keeper and will keep baking it.  Thanks for the submit.

I love this recipe.  My family and friends love it when I make this recipe... the bread is sssoooo moist and yummy it is always a request that I make this banana bread for potlucks!

Over the years I have adjusted this recipe.  I have used only a cup of sugar and have added an extra cup or more of very ripe bananas.

We tried to make this bread as is by only adding 1/2 cup very finely chopped pecans and used 1/2 whole pastry flour and 1/2 unbleached white flour, without sacrificing texture or moistness. Was extremely moist and had more banana flavor than I thought it would have. It was consumed in almost an hour upon removing it from the oven by my whole crew. We baked this in a bundt pan at 350 for about 40 minutes. Ovens vary, so use temps suggested as a guide. Superb recipe!

Very good banana bread. The only thing I changed was the sugar. I only used 1 cup but this is for my own personal taste, don't like things very sweet. This recipe is a big hit with my co-worker.

The best Banana Bread I have ever made! Just make sure to really grease and flour the bottom of your pan(s), the bottoms of my loaves stuck. But they still tasted great!

I followed this recipe exactly.  It turned out moist and super flavorful.  I then topped it off with a recipe I found on here for Banana Butter Icing, which was also fabulous and gave it an even bolder banana flavor.  I will definately make this again and again!

This bread was very good, however I think it could use a tad more flour. Mine came out a little sticky and kinda flat on top. I did not measure out what 1 cup of bananas was, I used 5 and I thought it was perfect. Very moist!!

I liked it, but wasn't the best banana bread i had.  However I did forget to put the vanilla in it so I am not sure if that made a big difference.  It did come out moist, but didn't rise as much as I wanted to.

I just made this bread and it's awesome!
Very moist and tasty. I'm always searching for recipes that i want as keepers. This one is it! Thanks for a great recipe. The only change i made was to add some chopped walnuts.

I did try and make this healthier and was disappointed in the results. I used lowfat vanilla yogurt (Mountain High), reduce sugar to 1 cup, used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 ap, added pecans and spices. My family ate it all, but I have tried better banana bread recipes. The cinnamon/sugar to flour the pan was a nice touch though.

This is fantastic banana bread.  I follow the recipe except I do 1 cup plain sugar and 1/3rd cup brown sugar with 3 bananas.  My 6 year son would eat the entire thing if he could.  It is eaten at our house in no time.  You cannot go wrong with this receipe.

This recipe is tried and true.  I use it every time I make banana bread and it is a huge family hit; the kids ask me to make every week, it's great for a snack at school.

Good recipe. The second time I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and added a cup of blueberries.  It was fantastic.

Great banana bread recipe!!  I used 1 cup of buttermilk instead of sour cream, 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour/1 cup white flour, and cut the sugar to half cup white/half cup brown.  I made 12 muffins instead of banana bread. I can't wait for them to ccol a bit so I can enjoy one with a cup of tea.

Great bread/cake recipe. We baked it in a bundt pan and it baked evenly and looked great. It's a very sweet cake, we cut sugar to 1 C. and mixed white and brown, still very sweet - but eaten up very quickly! Will make again.

This recipe is awesome, I use 1 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, low fat sour cream and a handful of chocolate chips on top. The chips sunk into the batter as it cooked.

Very Tasty & Light.  Not over loaded with fat which I liked.  Added a bit more banana just because I wanted to use it up, also added a bit of cinnamon.  Would definitely make again!

This recipe is so great. I didn't change a thing. I made two loafs of bread and it was gone in two days. My boyfriend tried to eat one all by himself. This is definately the best banana bread that I have ever made.

I really liked this recipe. I did do a few changes though. I used light sour cream and I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. It turned out super moist and had a really good banana flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

Wonderful taste and texture! I made a few variations based on items I had on hand; added 4 whole bananas, split sugar with white and brown, used reduced fat sour cream, added walnuts. Bread was very moist, had no problems by using reduced fat sour cream. Thank you for posting this.

Thanks for all the reviews. This bread is wonderful. I did some changing as well. I didn't flour the pan. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, and increased the banana's to about 3 banana's. I also added 1/2t of cinamon and 1/2t of nutmeg. I will definately make this again!

I loved this recipe!  I sprayed the pan and sprinkled it with a cinnamon/sugar mixture.  It comes out well with low fat or regular sour cream.  Fat free sour cream changes the texture some.  It wasn't as moist with Fat free sour cream, but it still had a good flavor.  I also added a half a cup of walnuts.  Absolutely love this recipe.  Everyone asks for it when we have any kind of gathering.

Excellent recipe!  I love the fact the fat content is lower by using sour cream (I used "light").  The texture is excellent... soft, moist and yummy!  The only complaint is it is very bland.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg, but not enough.  NEEDS SPICES!  Also, I used 5 mini loaf pans instead of 1 big pan so I baked it for less time.  This is a keeper!

This was easy to make- i liked that is used sour cream as most of the fat instead of butter. I did add some nutmeg, cinnamon and a cup of chopped walnuts to the recipe but otherwise followed it exactly. It is wonderful. I will keep this recipe and make it anytime i have super ripe bananas!!!

everyone liked this. i found it lacking in spices, i like the ones that don't taste just like banana but more like a combination of spices and banana. i added an extra cup of mashed banana.
it was more like cake than banana bread though.

Delicious!  I used a Bundt pan and it turned out great.  It had a very smooth consistency; next time I think I will add nuts.  My son said not to leave him home alone because he will eat it all!

This is the only banana bread recipe I use anymore!!  And to top it off, I always use egg substitute; I use plain applesauce instead of margarine and I use fat free sour cream! Admittedly, I've tried to use Splenda, but I don't care for the taste or texture of that!  Sometimes I add mini chocolate chips for the kids!!  This is the best!  Thank you Cathy!

I have never liked banana bread UNTIL this recipe. It is yum!!It is so moist without being greasy like most banana bread. Try it! The sour cream is not noticeable. It just makes it moist and yummy! I wrapped mine up after it cooled off and didn't touch until the next morning. It tastes better that way. You don't even need to spread butter on this bread. Just eat plain!

Moist bread! The banana flavor could have been a little stronger. The bread was also a little too dense.

I absolutely LOVE this banana bread. I never liked how my banana bread had turned out in the past, but after trying this recipe I will never look for another one!!! I have tried baking it both in a 9x13 pan as well as two loaf pans and both ways have turned out great. I tried another reviewers tip of sprinkling on a topping just before baking, but I only used brown sugar and cinnamon as I didn't have the other ingredients and that worked just fine. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!

I made this with brunch for family.  Everyone raved about it.  I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a smidge dry, but that could be an 'oven issue'.  Follwed the easy recipe exactly and added nuts.  Made two perfect shaped loaves.  Will try again with  fewer minutes in the oven.  Served at room temperature with the option of butter or peanut butter.  Yummy!

Lovely banana bread! We did half brown half white sugar instead of all white. It turned out so light, fluffy and tasty. Definitely will make again.

Yes, it was moist and stayed together well after slicing, but next time I am taking the advice to add banana extract.  The flavor was bland without it.

A VERY good bread, but I did add a 1/2 tsp of banana extract, and I'm glad I did because the banana taste was pretty faint. However, this bread got rave reviews from those who ate it. All in all, a good bread.

This banana bread was wonderful.  The best I have ever made.  Of course, this is the first time that I have made banana brad. lol :o)  I increased the amount of bananas, but the center sunk down.  I will deffinitely make this again, but maybe I won't stir the batter as much when I add the flour mixture, and I won't let the batter sit for as long before getting it into the oven.

This bread is VERY moist.  It stayed moist for all three days it was here! (I'm surprised it stayed around that long).  I think I needed to add a little more banana for more authentic flavor, but otherwise - delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

I baked this bread and took it on a family camping trip.  Everyone loved it.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used a bundt pan greased and coated with cinnamon/sugar.  I finally found a great bananna bread receipe, it will be the one I use from now on.

This was a very easy recipe, I followed the recipe exactly except I made 1 1/2 batches, and didn't measure the banana's I just mashed up and used 4 large very ripe banana's and the bread baked in the exact amount of time as on the recipe and is so moist and flavorful.  Very good.  Will keep and make again for sure.

Super moist! I always use two loaf pans, which I grease with butter and then "flour" with a cinnamon/sugar mixture. I use that for all my dessert type breads.

WOW! Possibly the best banana bread I have made.  Made a few adjustments- Instead of 2 cps white flour.  I threw in 3/4 cups whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 cup white four.  Can't even taste the whole wheat flour!  I also took the advice of coating the pan with cinnamon and sugar.  Tasted great.  Used egg whites and light sour cream as well.  GREAT recipe!

This is my first time making banana bread, and I used this recipe because I couldn't get ahold of my mother to get the recipe I grew up with. I must say I like Cathy's version better! My boyfriend came home and was sneaking more and more out of the kitchen. We can't get enough of it! Thanks. Next time I will add chocolate chips

Ok this bread was delicious however you need to use two 9x5 pans cuz I used one like the directions said and it bubbled all over my stove. Great flavor though (I ate what actually cooked in the pan)

FANTASTIC!!  Absolutely Fantastic!! I made this recipe as a gift for my boyfriends grandma and Aunt and they requested the recipe right away.  The only thing I changed is I added two cups of mashed banana instead of one.

This is a very moist bread.  My results were pretty good but it seemed to lack a little flaver.  Next time I would add more banana.

This was OK.  Needed more banana and wasn't moist enough.  I think next time I'll double the banana.  I did like that this was made with sour cream and will probably try this again with a bit of modification

This is the best banana bread I think I have ever made.  So good I can't stay out of it.  It could use a few walnuts, though.  Think next time I will add a 1/4 cup.

OMG This is sooo good.  I tried so many different banana bread recipes on this site and while they were good, it wasn't anything to write home about.  I never got around to this one because I never have sour cream on hand.  So glad I did this time around.  This is the best banana bread ever and I will not even attempt to try a different one now.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you Cathy!

Oh my!!!  Moist, flavorful, amazing banana bread.  I made this late last night with my super ripe bananas.  We were so full from dinner but still managed to polish off one of the loaves!  Delicious with a pat of homemade strawberry butter (from Nieman Marcus cookbook) too!

Best banana bread I've had!  Super moist and not super "banana-y" flavor.  I baked in one 9x5 loaf pan so I had to add about 15 minutes to the bake time but it did not affect the taste at all.  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 cup chopped walnuts.  Delicious!

I have never made a bread from scratch before but this was sooo easy. i used more banana than what was called for and used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar. this was better than i remember banana bread to be. i had planned on bringing a loaf to work but my boyfriend asked me not to! he loved it that much. i will definatly keep this recipe in my collection.

So gooood!  I love it!  I did add some freshly grated nutmeg and a little cinnamon.  I also added an extra dash of vanilla.  The banana flavor is awesome in this bread!  It is also very moist!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

My family loved it!  They devoured 2 little loafs within 10 mins of getting out of the oven.  I used all white sugar instead of listening to other reviews but I did add some chocolate chips.  I just sprinkle some on top of the batter. Best banana bread ever! I think I just found a recipe to replace my mom's sugary version!

I used 4 mini loaf pans and they were done in 40 min at 350. I also added about 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Came out perfect- moist and flavorful. I think I might like banana bread without sour cream a little better, though, which is why it's 4 stars and not 5.

Fairly good and not too moist or sticky at all.  Cosistency was just right.  I used two standard throw-away loaf pans that I bought at the store and sprinkled some white sugar on top before baking.  Yumm-o!  I love recipes where you already have all of the ingredients on hand.  Thanks.

This is definitely the BEST banana bread recipe ever. I've tried almost ever banana bread recipe out there.  My search is over.  Thanks Cathy.  
PS. I used 2/3 c. brown sugar and 2/3c. white sugar and I added 1/2 c. nuts but I toasted them first.  It sure was worth the extra step.

I thought that this was very good although it spilled over and ended up on the bottom of my oven.  It took about 25 minutes longer to bake than the recipe stated.  Loved the taste.

Very moist and pretty decent taste, but not a "5-star" taste. Not sure what I need to change - probably add spices and more banana.  I used 2 1/2 very ripened bananas.  My toddler liked it and it was good enough to serve at a playgroup.

this is the best banana bread i have ever made. i added cinnimon, 1/2 cup applesauce, used light margarine, and no chocolate chips (usually i do and i think it ruins it). there is no need for chocolate here bc the bread is so moist and delicious.

Snaps for Cathy! This is my daughter's favorite recipe of any banana bread I've ever baked. I leave it on the counter and everyone takes a piece as they walk by. The only change I made was  1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of all white. A definite keeper!

This recipe was amazing!  I didn't have a loaf pan, so I made them into muffins and they were a hit!
My only recommendation is when you make them into muffins, baking for 30 minutes or so is enough, otherwise they come out dry!  I added blueberries to some muffins and they were fabulous!

AMAZING RECIPE!!! I used Non fat sour cream, and I didn't measure out one cup of banana..i used two and a half medium banana's and then the other half of the third banana, i chopped up into bits and folded them into the mixture. I also added 1 tsp. of ground cinnamon, and then dusted the top with brown sugar and cinnamon. YUM! I also made them into mini loafs and so they only needed to be in the oven for about 35 mins. They turned out amazing! Sooo moist and the perfect amount of sweetness! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!!!

This is truly wonderful banana bread!  Very moist and delicious.  I made this for my parents when they went on a 1000 mile care trip and it was devoured to the last crumb! Thanks.

Very good, moist bread.  I added chocolate chips to this as it is our favorite way to eat banana bread. I would definitely make this again.

I have tried numerous banana bread recipes. I thought this was quite good. Very moist! I used 1 1/2 cups banana as I like an intense flavor. I shared with my co-workers and they were very happy! They said it was the best they've had.

Incredibly good!  The two loaves didn't even have a chance to get cold.  Very, very good banana flavor, moist -- best banana bread we've ever had.  This will certainly be the banana bread of choice in my family.

I think it's time to toss out my old banana bread recipe!  This was so wonderfully moist and delicious.  I added a little pumpkin pie spice into the batter...but it didn't need it :-)  Fantastic recipe!

Awesome, Cathy!!! This will be my ONE banana bread recipe from now on. The only thing that could have made it better is if my hubby didn't throw away my black bananas I'd been waiting for all week, so I had to use not so ripe ones. I did use a dash of pumpkin pie spice as well. Yummmy.

This is a wonderful recipe for banana bread...will definitely make this one again! I made a couple of changes though...I didn't have white sugar so I used brown sugar instead...and I didn't realize I was short on sour cream so I mixed half the sour cream with plain cream cheese...other than that it was a hit! Thanks!

This is wonderful!  We will never have to throw bananas away again!  I took the advise of some other cooks and added some spices.  I used 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice because I did not have the individual spices and it was great!  I also added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  Try this, you won't be sorry!

Just made this and it's already almost gone! I love this recipe, it's a keeper for sure! My bread turned out moist and delicious. I added choc chips instead of nuts for my picky kiddos. I didn't think was like coffee cake like others mentioned, but the choc chips help make it sweet. Will definitly be making many more times!!

This was good.  Not great, but really nice banana flavor.  I prefer a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg in mine for added spice.

The whole family loved this banana bread; it is really moist and delicious! I did add about 1/3c. extra mashed bananas rather than throw any away. Also added 1/2 c. chopped dates and 1/2 c. chopped walnuts. Baking time for me was about 1 hr. Thanks, Cathy!

Awesome!!!    Have made this 2 times in the last week and my family LOVED it.  The only thing I think I need to do is bake it for less time as it got a little too dark, but nevertheless was very moist!!!

This recipe is superb!  It is extremly moist and flavorful.  Everyone who has tried it asks me for the recipe.  This is a keeper.  (Recently when I made this I used 2 medium sized very ripe bananas - wasn't quite a full cup but it turned out just the same as with a full cup of mashed banana)

I made one 9x13 pan and it was certainly moist but it took almost 1 hour and 15 minutes to cook and it didn't rise well - it was very dense.  I sprinkled the top with sugar before baking for a little extra sweetness.  Overall a decent bread but not the best I've ever had.

This bread is great! I made it for the first time the morning some ladies were coming to my home for coffee and I needed a sweet bread to serve. It was easy to mix up, the directions were easy to follow, and it was DELICIOUS! I've made it several times since then and it's a keeper! It's great just the way it is. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Cathy!

Very good and very moist. To make it a bit healthier I used wheat flour and Smart Balance instead of margarine. It was still excellent.

Good golly, this is an excellent recipe!  I made it exactly as written, and the loaves turned out perfectly.  Baking is such a hit-or-miss proposition for me, so I'm always thankful when a recipe comes along that works exactly as it should.

Yummy!  Did make a couple of changes: used plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream & butter not margarine only because I didn't have any on hand, used half brown sugar & half white, sprinkled with cinnamon & chopped pecans prior to baking. Thanks Cathy!

Sure, this recipe wasn't dried out, but it was bland.  It was just a cake-y bread that didn't really taste like anything.  I  guess I like my banana bread to taste more like bananas or to have some sort of flavor or something.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of sour cream cake or sour cream donuts but it didn't taste like that either.  The rest of the family was  felt it was rather dull as well with the notable exception of my toddler who doesn't like banana bread.  She keep asking for more.

This was excellent.  All 5 in our house loved it.  It's the best banana bread I've ever made.  My husband couldn't stop eating it.  I made it exactly as written.  Do yourself a favor and have a piece warm!

This is a wonderful recipe... the bread is very moist. I made mini-muffins with it and my two-year-old ate almost all of them! Definately a hit.

YUMM!  I used a 9 inch loaf and a 7 inch loaf pan (gotta make do with what you have) and they cooked much faster than the recipe says.  But they are very moist and yummy.  I added cinn. and nutmeg.  I am excited to try it with chocolate chips or apple bits.

This recipe was OK for me.  I had a hard time getting it to cook all the way through without burning on top and sides.  But the flavor was good, coworkers loved it.  The batter even tasted good and was very "light" which I think is unusual for banana bread.  Thanks Cathy!

This is an excellent banana bread recipe.  I just made it again for the second time!  It is very moist, sweeet, and delicious!  I added chopped pecans because banana bread should be made with nuts, and it was so yummy.  I made this recipe into mini muffins (without nuts) for my kids, and they loved them, especially my 11 month old daughter!  Any time she sees one she reaches out her hand for one and puts up a huge fuss.  So good.

Usually everyone has one piece of banana bread when it first comes out of the oven.. then it sits there. This banana bread was eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dessert. We all, including the kids, enjoyed it more than any other we've had. I threw in 1/4 cup oat bran to give it some texture.Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Thanks so much!

My whole family LOVED this banana bread!  I added 1-1/2 cups of mashed banana, and it was excellent.  Also, I only had 9x3 loaf pans, so I used two and decreased the baking time to 40 minutes.  The loaves weren't as tall, but the kids didn't care.  SO GOOD!

I just got finished making this banana bread and was a little iffy about using sour cream in the recipe but the results were awesome!  The bread made a lot more than I expected and it turned out very moist and delicious.

This recipe is fabulous and is going to replace my old family one.  I doubled the recipe and made one 9x5" loaf plain and 2 smaller loaves with 1 cup of mini chocolate chips added.  This is moist and delish!!  Thanks, Cathy.

I just finished making this banana bread and it was great! My mom's was always kinda heavy and dense but this is lighter.  Not too fluffy though.  I used 1 1/2 cups sugar because my bananas were not that ripe.  I made mine in the 9x13 pan (maybe that would help the lady that had hers go flat) my cooked in only 35 min on 300 degrees.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I tried this today and it is FABULOUS!!  So moist all the way through and very tasty.  Normally when I make banana bread it gets kind of dry at the bottom, but not this one.  The only thing I did different was to add a cinnamon crumb topping, but the base bread is simply perfect.  I think I added a little bit more than a cup of banana because I had three larger bananas that needed to be made into bread.  I will definitely make this again.  This will replace my old recipe for sure.  Two thumbs WAAAAAAAAAAY up from my family! :)

I've had a similar recipe for years that always came out too soggy on the bottom, so I was extremely pleased when I cut these 2 loaves to see that they came out perfectly!
This will be our family's banana bread recipe from now on!
Thanks Cathy!

I simply LOVE this banana bread recipe.  It always turns out moist, delicious, and difficult to keep my hands off of.  

I created muffins with this recipe for my kindergartner's snack day and the students gobbled them down.  Just be sure to watch your cooking times with muffins.

Very good, I added a bit of cinnimon for some extra flavor, wish the recipe said how full to make the pans, I was not sure so I only filled them half way, which I guess was not enough because my bread didn't puff up much.  But VERY GOOD! Thanks!

Ok, confession time.  I cannot bake.  I'm okay with that, but I still had to bring something to a party and I MADE THIS!!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and added a little cinnamon (someone else's suggestion...) and I cannot tell you how amazing I feel now that I've successfully baked something.  I would recommend this absolutely delicious recipe to even the most timid of newbie bakers out there!  :)

Very moist bread.  The sugar crust was great.  I added extra banana's for more flavor.

Very delicious. I melted the butter called for in the recipe (even though it never really states to melt it.)  I think what put this recipe over the top for great taste is the sour cream.  Thank you for sharing!

Very nice and easy.  I made it in a 9x5 loaf pan, added a little cinnamon on top, and baked it for 65 minutes and it came out great.  Will make again.
