This was great.  The polenta came out just the right consistency -- not hard, but not runny -- just like they serve in restaurants. The perfect liquid to cornmeal ratio!  Just make sure to stir frequently so it doesn't get clumpy.

I made a few changes so that this would be VEGETARIAN: I used vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth, and I used vegetarian sausage links (4 = 1/2 lb.).  The flavor was great.  I also used swiss chard instead of mustard greens because they were all I had on hand -- I think any leafy green can be substituted easily.  The topping reminded me of something that would go well mixed with pasta, maybe with some lemon juice as well.

I will definitely make this recipe again!

This was pretty good, however, their are a few changes that need to be made.  First of all, Mustard Greens are just too bitter, coming from the south and having eaten these frequently  I had a feeling they would be. I think substituting spinach or another mild green would work, also use any cheese you prefer, just make sure to mix some into the polenta close to the end of cooking time.  The little bit on top just isnt enough.

I omitted the hot chili flakes; used swiss chard and kale *that's what I had on hand*, and used 2 lbs of sausage *wanted my meat loving family to try it*. I had one serving as the recipes indicates...it was GREAT. Then I mixed the rest together in a the cast iron pan I used to cook the sausage and greens and baked at 400 for 20 minutes. It's great that way as well. I'll definately be making this more often!

I was sceptical but decided to give it a try.  This is a very good dish.  Quite tasty, quite filling, and quite economical as well.  I definitely give it two thumbs up!
