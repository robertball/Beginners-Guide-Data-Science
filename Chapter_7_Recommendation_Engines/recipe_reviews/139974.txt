Didn't have marjoram, didn't have tarragon (don't care for either anyway), but that didn't detract from this at all.  I liked this alot; Hubs thought just ok. I did include the wine (a Cabernet) and used this vinaigrette to dress a simple salad of Romaine lettuce and fresh garlic croutons.

This is a great recipe for salad dressing.  I put it in the food processor to blend the flavors and I used dried herbs instead of fresh but it still turned out really good.  My husband is extrememly picky about salad dressings and he actually liked it a lot!  Thanks for sharing this.

Awesome. I didn't drain the tomatoes. It wasn't quite tart enough. I added a bit more vinegar and juice from half a lime. I could just drink the dressing. I think it will be a GREAT marinade, too, Especially for fish or chicken!
