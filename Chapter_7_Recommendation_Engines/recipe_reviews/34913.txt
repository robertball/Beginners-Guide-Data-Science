Creamed Peas is something my mother would make occasionally and I remember thinking it was a treat when she did.  I loved 'em!  But...back then canned vegetables were most commonly used, so the creamed peas were made with canned peas. Hubs and I agree canned were, and still are, infinitely better than frozen, and while this recipe takes frozen peas a step in the right direction, they're still frozen peas.  That said, this is a good recipe, and I particularly liked the subtle hint of nutmeg (I used fresh grated). Cooking the peas for five minutes is not necessary and might even shrivel them up - just heating them up is fine. In fact, they were a little too creamy and just throwing in an extra handful of frozen peas took care of that - no cooking necessary!  I'd consider  giving this another try - with canned peas.

I like both mushrooms and peas and the idea of them together as a side dish sounded good. I did not have canned peas so I used frozen sweet peas. I did not cook the peas for a full five minutes as I did not want them overcooked. I just cooked them until tender and set them aside. I also wanted to retain their bright green color.  I thought they were tasty but a little too creamy for me. I would cut back on the amount of light cream next time. The nutmeg was a nice subtle addition and this dish was tasty overall. I served this with, "Sunday Meat Loaf," and "Montreal Steak Seasoned Mashed Potatoes," from AR site.

Creamed peas over New Red Potatoes is a favorite! Milk works just as well as the cream-Mushrooms were a nice addition but then again I like mushrooms in just about everything except Captain Crunch!!

This was the first time I had ever made creamed peas and I am so glad I tried this recipe first. It is the only way I will make them from now on! I only made one substitution - I didn't have cream so I used evaporated milk, and a little extra butter. I also used canned mushrooms instead of fresh. This was delicious, and everyone at the table loved them!

This tasted great, and looked much more complicated than it is!  I made some substitutions for convenience, but the taste was still fantastic:  canned peas and mushrooms instead of frozen or fresh, half & half instead of cream, and 1 tsp onion powder instead of onions (we don't like onions).  This has such a mild flavor, it went very well with a spicy main dish.

These were pretty good! Even my pea-hating fiance liked them. I gave it 4 stars just because it was pretty bland. I added quite a bit of pepper and threw a clove of garlic (chopped) in. I used skim milk and a little extra flour. Thanks :)

Excellent!! Used half & half instead of the light cream, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Hubby is already asking when we can have again! Wonderful recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Tasty but I thought it had too much light cream so I'll cut it back next time.  And add more mushrooms too - we love mushrooms and peas.

This was a good dish but not great.  It is definitely a little on the bland side (I thought), some would say just mild.  It would be easier to have regular peas than to go through all of that to make it.  It's not bad, just not quite worth the trouble.  Who knows, maybe it is better the next day?

Not a single pea was left over!  The only change i made was using gluten free flour and heavy cream, but have since made it with a lighter cream with great results.

Very nice change to standard peas. This marries 2 of my favorite veggies (shrooms & peas) together in a lovely, light sauce. The nutmeg (a pinch) adds a nice flavor as well. Highly recommended.

I really liked this recipe.  I made it around noon and stuck in the fridge to reheat for dinner.... it was an absolute hit with my husband. I loved the onion, and actually added onion powder also.

I made this dish vegan by swapping soy creamer for the heavy cream and used dairy-free butter. Everyone enjoyed it  with our dinner of mashed potato pancakes.

This was great - a real blast from the past.  I used a heaping tablespoon of flour with my skim milk (all I had).  It wasn't thickening up as much as I wanted it to, so I added a heaping tablespoon of ground parm cheese.  I only had the small frozen peas, so I just thawed them under running water, drained them, then tossed them in and let the mixture bubble for 5 minutes or so.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly, except for reducing the amount of cream using a bit more than 1/2 cup. (I figure Half & Half counts as light cream, so that is what I used.)  My husband likes peas, and he still liked them this way. He thought it was a mix and was impressed I had made it. I'm not a big fan of peas, but this was a hit for me too.

I made this recipe as is. It was very easy, and the taste was creamy and mild. I highly suggest using frozen peas versus canned, as frozen peas have been flash frozen at the height of their freshness and flavor, and therefore remain crisp and delicious when cooked. Whereas canned peas taste very different than frozen or fresh peas, and the texture is incredibly mushy. That said, some folks have grown up eating canned peas, and therefore may prefer them. Next time, I'd add a glove of minced garlic, and more salt and pepper to taste. And only boil the frozen peas a couple mins instead of 5.

My family was very excited to have "special peas".  Great tasting upgrade to a standard.

I love love love these!  I used shallots instead of onions because I wanted to use them up.  I used half and half because that is what I had and I threw in a 1/4 teaspoon of sugar because another pea recipe I like has sugar in it.  I was prepared to use less half and half based on other reviews but they needed the entire cup.  Thank you for this recipe it is holiday and company worthy!

The mushroom and peas are a great combination. For a different taste, I added some dried basil and chilli powder.
