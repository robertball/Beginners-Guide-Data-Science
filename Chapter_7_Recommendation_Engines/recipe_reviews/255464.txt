Very good, I was delighted with the texture and taste.  I will be making this again. However, the water ratio was too much, I added about 3 TBLS of gluten free flour to it as it was too liquidity.  I used 2 Corning Ware pie plates when I baked them, this worked well. Topped the bread with hummus, spinach, tomatoes, crumbled bacon, and sprinkled Cilantro as the final step.  YUMMY!
