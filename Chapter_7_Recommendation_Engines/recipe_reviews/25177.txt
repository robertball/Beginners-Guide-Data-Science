This was exactly what I was looking for!  The only change I made was to add a 20-ounce can of drained pineapples tidbits.  This was good the first day (after 5 hours in the fridge), but it was SUPERB the next day after all the flavors had melded together nicely.  I can't believe how easy this was.  My husband did think it was too sweet (maybe this was because of the pineapples), so next time I will omit the tablespoon of sugar.

Just as a side note, the recipe says it's 4 servings, but it is easily double that and then some.

Initially when I tasted this salad just after making it I didn't like it, too much mayo flavor but after putting in the fridge for several hours it was delicious.  All the flavors blended and it was yummy.  I also used light mayo and light sour cream. This recipe is a keeper, have made it twice already this week.

I thought the sour cream gave a it a nice richness, but the sugar made it too sweet. Carrots and raisins are sweet enough, the sugar is not needed. I'll make this again, but just skip the sugar.

Delicious! My mom always made this with just mayonnaise in the dressing, I think the sour cream really adds something. I like it as a sandwich filling too, on wheat bread with peanut butter!

I really loved this recipe! My kids even liked it and quite frankly, both really don't like carrots that much. The sauce was just right and added a wonderful sweetness to the carrots and raisons. I thought it was delicious. I will make this again. Great for a potluck!

This recipe is good!  I used two 8 oz bags of the fresh pre-shredded carrots and I still didnt use all of the dressing mixture. It ended up being way more than 4 servings, but with less carrots there was way too much dressing in my opinion. I also added a small can of drained pineapple tidbits.  I will make this again. Thank you!

Almost as good as my mom's. This salad was just what I expected. I used light mayo and light sour cream. I didn't have lemon juice, so I used cider vinegar instead. I first ate this after about 45 minutes after I prepared it, and it was good then, but now after it has been in the fridge for 6 hours it is even better, the dressing was thicker and heavier then, but now it is just right. Do let it stand in the fridge for several hours first if you can, it makes a BIG difference. Def worth keeping, Thanks Linda for sharing this. I love this stuff!

I'm not a fan of carrot salad but I made it for a gathering today and it was wonderful.  I followed the suggestions of others and added a can of drained pineapple bits.  I tried it before the pineapple was added and then after.  It's good before but the pineapple definetly finishes it off.  It was delicious!  Another tip, be sure to make it the day before so the flavors can blend overnight.  You won't be disappointed.

This was bland, and the dressing is too heavy.  I'd had enough after only 1 or 2 bites.

I could only manage a few bites and I even let it sit in the fridge longer so that maybe the flavors would blend...no luck...still awful.

Linda, thanx for sharing this delicious recipe! I followed the ingredient/directions as posted w/two exceptions  ... because I was taking it to a party and knowing our daughter doesn't like raisins I substituted the raisins for Craisins. Plus I followed the advise of of others and included a small can of crushed pineapple. Commenting on other posts regarding sugar ... I think the original recipe is great w/sugar. CERTAINLY make this salad a day ahead so the flavors can 'marry'. This is a 4+ Carrot recipe!

I didn't use any sugar, instead saved the pineapple juice and added 2 to 3 tablespoons of the juice to the mayo and sour cream.  Left out the lemon juice.  Used low cal sour cream and lite mayo.  Turned out great, people were asking for the recipe.

Just like the stuff you buy at the deli!  Let it sit in the fridge overnight.  If you try it before then it's very thick and mayonaissey and not sweet enough.  After it sits overnight though, its awesome!  Will make again!

I loved this salad.  It's way better than most carrot and raisin salad recipes than you can find.  It is quite rich, though, which while acceptable to me, may not be to some people.  Thanks for the recipe!

The dressing tasted like fruit salad dressing to my family.  I used light mayo and light sour cream.  I thought the addition of fruit was really needed so I chopped an apple and added that.  Good, but pineapple would have been better.  I think I will use this dressing again but play with the other ingredients to find that just right balance of flavor.  Thank you!

just made this for an early Easter dinner side dish. It's really good, but I agree it needs to be made the day before. I wanted it just a touch sweeter so I added a tsp of honey and a dash of cinnamon. I also used golden raisins. I will definitely make this again.

This salad was INCREDIBLE! I added 1 cup of pineapple bits and same amount of shredded coconut and left it in the fridge over night. The result is amazing, and is gone already after 36 hrs - ready to make another batch : )    While some people do not like it when ratings are given with recipe adjustments, I personally love it, and I find that all my recipes from this site has been a success because of other's review and recommendations / preferences / new ideas.

I really enjoyed this very much as a side for pork chops tonight. I did sub cranberries for the raisins just because I don't care for raisins.  I think next time I make this I'm going to sub pineapple greek yogurt for the sour cream.

I knew this would be a bit sweeter that we like so I reduced the sugar to half a teaspoon and the raisins to 3/4 cup. I definitely recommend less sour cream (2 Tblsns.) also so it is not so soggy and fattening. With these changes it worked well as a side dish for BBQ chicken & baked beans.

Near Perfect just as written! I followed the recipe except for substituting lime for the lemon juice and adding 1 tablespoon each of sunflower seeds, dry roasted peanuts and soy nuts. Wow was this good atop a large garden salad for a lighter dinner.
Thanks for sharing Linda.

I really like this recipe, the sour cream was a nice addition!  I didn't have brown sugar, so I used organic white sugar.  I used regular mayo.  I think it would be good with a pinch of cayenne (the hot/sweet thing) but with kids eating it. . .it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

I agree with other reviewers that this recipe is good the first day, but AWESOME the second and third days. I added pineapple tidbits, as well. On the first day, I thought it might need more sugar- not as sweet as I was aiming for. But after sitting in the fridge overnight, it was PERFECT. Tastes like Chick-fil-a carrot raisin salad. Yum.

This was wonderful!  Very similar to what I always order at Luby's.  I added a can of crushed (drained) pineapple, and it was perfect!  There was nothing left over after Easter Dinner!

I didn't like the mayo flavor so I made it a second time with plain yogurt instead.  Its a 5 star dish with yogurt, but only 4 with mayo.

I was the only one who would eat this. I thought there were too many raisins. I left out the sugar and half the salt. Used fat free sour cream.

This is a great, quick salad.  I've made it once a week since discovering it a month ago.  I don't use the lemon juice and brown sugar though, I followed someone elses advice and use a sploosh of balsamic (about 1 1/2 to 2 tbsps.)

This was a hit with a few changes.  At first I wasn't sure about the sour cream but it does add another layer of flavor.  Also used 2 tablespoons of honey instead of the brown sugar + I added some chopped pecans.  Sweet and crunchy and yummy!

My hubby says it is good, so I am giving it 4 stars. I didn't like it because I don't like raw carrots or raisons so I won't factor my opinion into this rating, that would probably be unfair to the recipe.

Good starter recipe.  However, I found that I needed a lot more dressing, and a lot more sweetener.  Since I used Splenda, the latter was not an issue.

This was good, but not great. The dressing is a little too heavy and thick. I think it would be better with a little milk added and more carrots.

I've never had carrot salad before and looking for something beside carrot cake to use up our garden carrots. I read the reviews and made it like the recipe shows except for 2 changes. I added small tidbits of pineapple and I don't like raisins so I added craisins instead. Took a taste of it when I was done, and it was ok. Took tips from the other to refridgerate overnight and had it with a chicken burger. It was a lot better the next day. It was sweet and still crunchy. I may have to omit the sugar next time to cut back the sweetness.

I enjoyed this salad very much, and to me it is one that needs to be made a day ahead of when you want to serve it. The flavors are so much better after an overnight chilling.

It was a little too moist for me.  Kind of mushy.  However, the flavor was wonderful.  Next time I'll just add more carrots to get a texture I like better.

This salad was edible, but we felt that the addition of lemon and salt gave it an odd and unwelcome flavor.  That combination of tart and salt just didn't enhance the salad.  Even a day in the fridge didn't improve the flavor.  I'll try another recipe the next time.

This is excellent!  My mom used to make carrot raisin salad all the time when I was younger.  I omitted the brown sugar and added 1 8oz. can of crushed pineapple and 1 cup of coconut for a tropical summertime treat that's worthy of a picnic!

I didn't have any lemon juice and was going to substitute vinegar; instead of regular vinegar I used my aged, sweet-tart balsamic and left out the sugar - tasty combination!

Just what I was looking for.  I made it lower in fat by using FF sour cream & FF mayo.  I also added about 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple.  I've made this a few times and my daughter & I just love it.

Excellent little salad  - I made it just as suggested except I added more raisins, and even my husband who has never liked carrot raisin salad ate the whole serving!

This recipe is now the family standard for carrot and raisin salad. I use Meyer Lemons when available and also add a bit of the lemon zest to the lemon juice.  It kicks the flavor up one more notch. Thanks to Linda W. for sharing.

Made it for a Thanksgiving party. After reading other comments we omitted the brown sugar and added pineapple tidbits, and everyone loved it. Not too sweet and the dressing was perfect. We also used regular mayo and sour cream. Delish.

I like to blanch raisins anytime I use them in a recipe so they are more plumed. This is a simple recipe and a great way to use carrots you have. I enjoyed the sweetness of ingredients.

Easy, fast, and I omitted the lemon juice but substituted 1/2 cup of crushed drained pineapple instead. Makes a huge quantity, could probably serve 8 easily. Hubby loves it! Will put in my repertoire

I just made this a couple of hours ago.  I let it chill for 15 minutes before I tasted it.  It was excellent, but it didn't quite taste like I remember from my school days.  I just added about two tablespoons of pineapple juice, chilled for another hour, and served it with cheeseburgers.  My grandkids absolutely loved it and are already asking when I'll make it again - Thanks!

I've been making this for awhile and it is very good! Lately, I've been experimenting with it by using miracle whip salad dressing in place of the lite mayo, craisins in place of raisins, and toasted walnuts. Delicious!!

I haven't made this salad in a long time and I was looking for a refresher just to make sure I wasn't forgetting something. I like the Mayo / sour cream combo instead of straight mayo. I was going to skip the brown sugar but I accidentally added too much salt, so the brown sugar level that right out. A good old fashioned recipe.

I made this on the spur of the moment, and to be honest, I didn't carefully measure the ingredients.  I borrowed from another recipe the idea of a squirt of orange juice, and I might have gone a little light on the brown sugar.  I didn't find it too sweet, possibly because I used more lemon juice than the recipe calls for.  I thought the taste was quite good, as did my husband.

My mom made this for years, but she didn't include the sour cream. I like the addition! I don't do sugar anymore so I used Splenda, and I had golden raisins, which I think are larger and sweeter. The recipe is great - will make it again, and often!

I only changed  this a bit:the sour cream to Greek plain yogurt and since I had no lemon juice I used lime mixed raisins and craisins (ran out of raisins) I also left out the salt (hubby has hight bp) We love it.  I basically don't like carrots, but I will eat this!!

Not sure what I did wrong - this was super watery - I will not make again.

Made this for my Mama-in-law for Mothers' Day...very good.  Did leave out the sugar as per other reviews.  Recipe as written made enough for 8 servings...not 4.
