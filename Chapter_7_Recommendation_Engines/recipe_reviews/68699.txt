This turned out very flavorful, although I might cut down on the pepper a little the next time.  I used my dehydrator instead of the oven, and it still took a fair amount of time to dry.  I ended up leaving it drying overnight and by morning it was perfectly done and chewy.  I'll be making this one regularly!

I love tofu and I love beef jerky.  So I thought I would give this recipe a try especially after reading the reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly; only change was to use a food dehydrator instead of the oven.  I am sorry but I was a little disappointed.  I love all of the ingredients listed but surprisingly the end taste just wasn't for me and the texture was too rubbery.  I am sorry.

I was shocked. This actually tasted really good!!!
I am on a low carb diet so I used low carb, maple syrup, brown sugar and barbeque sauce and it turned out great. I think the next time I make this I will add a little hot sauce to give it a kick!!!

Very Good.  Not beef jerky, but who would actually want to eat a cow!!  I used my Krups Toaster Oven and did the convect baking option.  After reading the reviews, I think this is one of those recipes that require a good oven.  If you have a poor quality one, the fluctuation in temperate will make it impossible to make these.  I flipped mine every hour and a half and reapplied the sauce.  This made them a bit too spicy so next time I will only re-coat them only two or three times.  If you don't like spicy, cut down on the black pepper.  The only reason I am giving it four and not five stars is because the spicy is on the front of the tongue and not on the back.  Proper spicy should be on the back or balanced.  I am going to try a dash of cayenne pepper or heat the sauce with a small piece of a habanero in it before applying it.  That should balance out the spice.  All in all, I never have tried jerky tofu before, and for a long time vegan, this is a nice new way to enjoy my tofu.  Thank you!!!!  Added:  I left one piece out and took a little bite each day.  I lasted 8 days before it started to get a little too tough.

The grownups in the house loved this recipe. A few of the kids thought it was a bit too spicy.  We omitted the liquid smoke and used Rapadura instead of brown sugar.  All in all a good recipe, we will definitely make this one again.

Delicious!  It's a sweet and spicy marinade and I thought it tasted really good without the liquid smoke.  I used a 250 degree oven and it took over 5 hours, but I think I cut the pieces too thick.  I also marinaded the tofu overnight.  I can't keep my hands off it, it's so tasty!

I made this for a vegan, and they really loved it.  I cooked it much longer than suggested, but I had started out at a lower temperature.  The only thing I personally would like would be if it had more flavor.  But as I said, the recipient was ecstatic.  Vegans are fun to cook for, because no one usually does. ;)  They appreciate it more.   Adopt a vegan and learn some new tricks. ;)

I made this recipe exactly as stated...and sorry but it was terrible.  Within 2 hours most of the jerky charred and unedible.  The pieces on the middle of the rack were not burnt but tasted awful.

Tried "patti cake"'s recommendation of 250 for 4 hours, and it initially turned out bad enough I nearly threw it away. I ended up tossing it in the fridge ziplocked overnight. After I got home from work the flavor had really soaked in, and the texture had become uniform and jerky-like. Very tasty, will make again!

Easy preparation.  I didn't get my tofu sliced uniformly, and every bite still had great taste & good texture.  I wasn't even a fan of beef jerky, and this tofu jerky is terrific. We increased the temperature toward the end to speed the cooking.  Might try the 250 at 4 hours recommended in another review next time.  Definitely a keeper!

this is wonderful to munch on! it´s a  much better option than pototo chips or other treats because it tastes very good and has good protein in it instead of fat! Absolutely great :)
I made them in a Dehydrator for 8 hours on 70°C

I really made a mess of this.  Came out 'burnt' tasting and I followed the directions to a tee.  Would like to know what a good batch tastes like.

I have no idea what liquid smoke is, so I didn't use it, but this came out really yummy. Also, baking 5 hours seemed enough for me, this is a great snack!

The person I made this for thought it was fantastic (she kept it in her pocket through out the day nibbling on a piece here and there.)  I only gave it 4 stars because I like real beef and the texture was off to me.

Very tasty, slightly crunchy.  I cooked them for 30 minutes less than said in the directions and they all (except for a few, fatter slices) came out perfect.  This may be because I cut most of them very thin though.  Just watch them carefully within the last hour.
