Using Manchengo Cheese and heavy whipping cream is a twist on a traditional recipe. A twist so good that even hubby,  who does not like the traditional recipe, gobbled it up.  Great recipe, thanks.

I added some cubed cooked potatoes and used sour cream instead of whipping cream.

I like it. It was easy and made it to easier by not sweating the Chile and peeling it. Didnâ€™t have time but still came out good.

So easy and full of flavor! I added a few dashes of nutmeg to the recipe. Two people left with the recipe and are planning to make it themselves so it was a hit!

I made a vegeterian version for dinner tonight.  I made a larger batch by doubling the recipe. 
***pls note that chilles Pasilla are also called (misslabeled) chile poblano in some groceries. 

I followed the recipe as is (I doubled) except I used Better Than Bullion instead of chicken Bullion. I made tacos with a side of black beans for added protein. 
my husband loved it! I thought it was okay. I will mk again but use less cheese sauce & add a little habanero for spice. 
I def recommend. I will make for my next pot luck at work ??

Flavors blend nicely in this recipe. Next time I'd like to try something to balance the texture...something crunchy or with a bit of a bite to it.
