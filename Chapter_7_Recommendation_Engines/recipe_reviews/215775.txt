I had a neighbor bring me some figs, and I didn't know what to do with them. I found this recipe but was skeptical getting a recipe from someone so young, but the fig preserves were wonderful. I couldn't stop tasting it as it cooked. I let it cook longer than an hour so it would thicken. The flavor is great! I hope I get more figs so I can do it again, yummy. You taught a seasoned cook a new trick. Thanks.

I just made the figs and followed the directions.  The figs tasted great and the jars looked beautiful after processing.  When I looked at the jars the next morning, after leaving them on the counter overnight, the butter had risen to the top of the jar and throughout the preserves.  What did I do wrong?  Has anyone else had this happen?

Oh, my, gosh!  These are fabulous!  The spices are perfect.  Delanna is right.  Fig preserves are better when they are not bland!  I (almost) doubled the recipe.  Did not have extra lemon juice so just used my last lemon and sliced thin. Also used ground ginger since that is what I had.  Can't wait to make another batch while my fig tree is producing.  Off to the store to buy more jars!

I made these preserves last year and jarred them to give out at the Holidays. I was floored by the response!  We moved into a house with two large fig trees and never knew what to with them, other than eat a few. Now I not only have  a great use, this recipe has been a huge hit! I had several friends offer money for any extra jars I had. I harvested three huge bags of figs yesterday and will be spending all day in the kitchen making preserves today!

Tastes similar to apple pie.  The figs remained whole and did not break down.  This did not thicken up like jam, but I think it is supposed to be that way.  I've made it twice and both times it yielded only half of the amount listed in the recipe.  The lemon rinds taste delicious after cooked.  I prefer not to slice it into rounds though.  I cut the lemon in half and the sliced it.  From what I've read the lemons are necessary when canning because figs are a low acid fruit, which makes them prone to bacterial growth.  So, don't leave out the lemons!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I have been making jams and preserves for several years and had never tried to make fig preserves.  A friend gave me some fresh figs and I found this recipe and thought it sounded good.  The fresh lemons add a nice flavor.  This one is going in my recipe file!

Great flavor.  Made the whole house smell great.  I doubled the recipe, and it yeilded 5 pints and 1 half pint.   I thought I would get more, since the yield for 5 cups was 8 pints, maybe it was to be half pints?  In anycase, so great! thanks!

I just finished making these preserves and they were VERY flavorful. I had a little leftover after canning that I just had to taste. I had no idea what to expect since I have never eaten figs other than in fig newtons. I was pleasantly surprised. I read the other reviews about the figs being whole and being packed in the syrup and the directions noted being careful when stirring not to break apart the figs. Therefore, I worked on keeping the figs whole. They turned out just fine but next time I would stir towards the end of the cooking time and allow the figs to break open after softening. I noticed that the lovely lady who submitted the recipe had a photo of her fig preserves and they appeared to have the figs more dispersed throughout the syrup. Great recipe and pretty easy too!

So tasty!  I didn't have lemons, but I had dried lemon peel.  The substitution still worked.

Delicious!!  I tweaked this a bit...my kids like jam...not preserves.  I followed this recipe exactly, except that I blended the mix to turn it into a jam.  I continued to cook it until the recipe was reduced to a jam-like consistency.  My kids gobbled up a sample on toast while I was canning it....not sure one of the jars will make it to storage before it disappears!!! ;)

Wow!  Very tasty.  I doubled the recipe and still only ended up with 4 pint sized jars, but still, totally worth it.  Mine ended up freezer jam as my jars were too big/pots too small to do the final immersion.  But it is so good that I am perfectly happy with it.  I followed the recipe, only difference is when I open a new jar I stick a knife in there and chop everything up a little.  My and my husband's favorite way to eat it is on a toasted english muffin with some peanut butter.  Mmmmm.  Maybe next year I'll make it with the smaller jars and give some away, but this year it is mine, all mine.  :)

Not having had much experience with figs, this was the first recipe I tried as a way of preserving them...so happy with the results. This is my second year making batches of it, and we had no problem getting rid of all I canned last year! While my kids like them smashed up on biscuits, I love them over plain yogurt topped with chopped almonds!The texture is not a jelly or jam, but whole figs in a flavorful syrup. I use more figs than the recipe calls for, more like 8 cups per batch.

This is my first experience canning anything other than freezer jam, and I had so much fun!  My recipe only yielded half as much as expected, but it tastes delicious!  I will be making more as soon as more figs ripen.  Thank you for this recipe!

I do want to add that I used figs from a fig tree growing naturally in Texas, so it is of a much smaller size than usual figs. They were on average an 1" to 1 1/4" in diameter. I also decided to peel the figs and only use the juicy insides. 
When I taste tested the jam after adding all the ingredients and mixing together at a simmer, it tasted delicious! I would definetly reccommend trying out this recipe at home!

Okay, my two picky boys turned their noses up, but I could eat them straight out of the jar! I licked the spoon afterwards and had a fit of excitement. All the favors (lemon, clover, cinnamon) meld together so well. I joked that it would be a great Fall candle scent.

I made this after a bumper crop this summer.  It turned out absolutely perfect.  Unbelievable flavor.  Perfect on hot buttered biscuits!!!  I mash my cooked figs but do not cut up.

Shazam! Loved it -- LOVED IT!

I thought this recipe would be good just from reading it. The positive reviews from other users made me even more confident. But the final product we wound up with surpassed even these optimistic expectations. We'll definitely be making this again -- a new family favorite!

We put in a little bit more lemon, but then again, our family likes distinctive flavors. Going with the original recipe's lemon quotient would, in my opinion, also give an outstanding batch of preserves. We had to cook the preserves for about 25 additional minutes. I think we had the heat turned down a trifle low. When we got to the end of the originally stated cooking time, the figs were still "swimming" in liquid instead of "wading" in it. A tad more heat and, as already stated, 25 additional minutes brought them to where they needed to be.

We used our own backyard figs for this recipe. We planted a small tree about three years ago. They take a while to get established -- this is our first year with a real fig crop. From that one tree we got enough fruit to make 1 1/2 batches, plus enough figs left over for fresh snacking. The tree is lovely, low-maintenance, and now gives enough shade to provide a summer outdoor sitting haven. So if you live in a relatively warm part of the world, I strongly recommend a fig tree + this recipe.

Can this recipe be made with dried figs?  should dried figs be hydrated before use and then use same amount  as fresh. Recipe sounds wonderful!

I just made this, but changed the numbers to the metric system as I'm European and don't use cups and although it smells great, I only ended up with 2 jars, got the feeling I didn't use enough figs...

I love the uniqueness of this recipe. The flavor is warm like fall, I like that I can't specifically taste the cinnamon or cloves. I found the lemon to be a little overpowering, but am afraid to use less lemon for preserving. Also I only got 3.5 half pint jars, I wish the recipe was more clear because it seems many people got about half the amount the recipe says it makes. Will make again though!

We've got a huge fig tree & I'm not really crazy about them - BUT I love this recipe. Labeled them as "My FAVORITE Figs". Can't wait to bake with brie. This will be the ONLY recipe I'll make in the future. No need to look further. Thank you!

We absolutely loved this.  It makes a small batch which is nice.  I filled two small jars and had enough left for instant taste tests on muffins.  The spices give a reminder of apple butter (which we love).  

I did use my immersion blender to chop everything up a bit before putting into the jars as it still had some very large fig pieces.  Very,  very tastey.  I have a second batch going as I type this.

Absolutely delicious exactly as written. One caution: DO NOT DOUBLE THE BATCH IF YOU ARE A JAM NOVICE LIKE ME. It took FOREVER to rise to temperature. Also, this makes a very chunky preserve which is perfect for adding to yogurt, spooning over ice cream, etc. I contemplated adding cornstarch and turning it into pie filling. I will make again - in a single batch :-).

Like many others who offered reviews, I found the preserves a bit too sweet and the consistency a bit juicier than I would prefer.  I loved the overall flavor, however.  It reminded me of the warm comfort of fall; my family enjoyed the aroma while I was cooking!  Next time I make this I'll probably add a little less sugar and break the figs up a bit towards the end of the cooking period as I am stirring.

I found the spices overpowered the figs too much. I also  did not get 8 half pints. I’m wondering if it should be simmered with a lid on ??? That would probably give more 1/2 pints and give a subtler spiciness .

The butter separated and hardened from the rest of Jam when I checked the next morning in the fridge. 
Also, the skin on the figs must have been tough bc they did not dissolve or breakdown much. I just have clumps of fig skin that have stayed intact.

Best recipe yet for golden figs!  I love the spicy addition of flavors.  I have had success freezing both cooked fig compote and uncooked figs, so I am hopeful that this recipe will also freeze well.

This is delicious. It took a little longer to boil down and thicken than the recipe suggests but I didn’t want it to burn so I lowered the temp. I’ll use a little less lemon next time but the tang is good. Maybe orange instead?mmmm

I just made these preserves this morning.  I followed the recipe exactly as is and the taste is great.  I had extra syrup but it may thicken when it cools.  I held back a table spoon of syrup to taste the flavors and I LOVE it.  I can't wait to try some on a cheese try or just toast.  Thanks for this recipe as I really needed something to do with all our extra figs and love having them later in the year.

Very tasty. I like the addition of butter and the extra spices. Instead of fresh ginger, I used a sprinkle of dried ginger. I was looking for more of a fig preserve instead of preserved figs so I removed the lemon rinds and then macerated the figs at end of cooking. I gave it just 3 stars because the cooking time and amount of jars needed was way off. I cooked it for at least an additional 30 minutes. It barely made 4 half pints. A little frustrating to spend 2 hours and only get 4 small jars. Plus, I had already sterilized the jar lids which can't be reused so those are wasted.

This has lovely lovely flavor. I gave some away as gifts and the requests began. This is my third year using recipe.I cut up the figs and do a rough puree so that it spreads smooths.I use the juice and rind of about 10 lemons when I do a triple batch. It was so special to hear from my gift recipients, "I don't like figs but this taste like pie in a jar". So now to make this years batch. SO excited.

Very nice recipe.  However, it took about an 80 minutes of cooking to thicken up a bit.  And, part way through I decided to cut some of the larger figs in half.  Really like the taste, but next time I think I will cut them all up.  Whole figs don't spread well on toast.  Also, consistent with what many others said, following the recipe only yields about half the stated volume.

I wanted to try this recipe because the sugar content is much less than many others. The final product  is very tasty, but something seems to be off in the proportions. I followed the recipe exactly, and it literally took all afternoon for the syrup to thicken then the yield was only two pints. I would like to try it again, but I am considering using lots more figs to the amount of liquid. Any suggestions?

Second time making this. First time, the spices overpowered the fig taste so I did not like it. This time around I cut down by 1/2 on the ground cloves, ginger & on the lemon.  I also used pure cane sugar. It is tasting delicious! Just  the perfect amount of spices without being over powering and can taste the figs. Will make it again.

We moved and found a beautiful fig tree or bush at our home...Not ever having had a fig bush, i wasn't sure what to do with the more than abundant crop of them..Found this recipe and wow!! Wonderful flavor, smell and oh so easy. I only had to cook mine about 1 hour and they turned out beautiful...only got about 4- 1/2 pints out of one batch tho...maybe I needed more figs in the batch , but whatever they are scrumptious!!!!

Very good recipe!  I'm making another batch today, but I'm going to decrease the amount of butter and back off on the sugar a little bit.  (My figs are very sweet!)  My elderly neighbor LOVES these, so I'll be sharing a couple pints with him.

I used a previous posters suggestion of taking out the cooked figs and chopping them up as we prefer to not have the big chunks. I followed recipe to the letter. It made four 4oz jars and one 8oz jar. Two did not seal but I guess that just means I have to eat it!  From what I tasted off of the spoon and bowl it is yummy!  Made the house smell DIVINE!

OMG!!! I did not think I was gonna like this jelly because I love figs so much, but you can still taste the figs so much! IT IS HEAVENLY!!!!!!!!! I cant imagine anyone not rating it 5 stars! The only thing I am changing is that I am freezing my figs first, then thawing them so that they break down and not stay whole, although it did not stop me from eating half the jar at each sitting! The other seasonings added a touch of taste and did not overpower the figs, my hubby loved it too, I have 3 gallons of figs waiting in the freezer, I am ready!!!!!!

I just made these for the first time and they were delicious.  Well what I licked off the spoon and pan was as I am letting the jars sit for 2 days like the recipe says.  I did it just like written except I only had ground ginger and one lemon so I used them and added lime juice for the 1 T.  I don't think it made a big difference but plan to make just like recipe next time.  I used brown turkey figs. Thanks for sharing this recipe Delanna!

I've just recently gotten into canning and I've always been obsessed with figs in all their forms so I thought I'd try this. Oh my goodness, SO delicious. I used these figs in marinades (esp with pork tenderloin) and also on toasts/crackers with cream cheese.... everyone I know is obssessed with them and always wants more more more.
