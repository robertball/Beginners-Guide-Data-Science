This is a great, simple recipe that people will love to eat; it's one of the most popular lunch dishes the the French bistro down the street from my office.

Some changes I would make:

*Use Swiss cheese instead of Gouda
*Add a clove of minced garlic to the cheese sauce along with the salt and pepper.
*I wouldn't use sourdough for this, I think it interferes with the delicate tastes of the sauce.  Instead, just use some sort of french loaf.

For those that are having issues with the sauce, what Sarah didn't point out in her original directions is that you are actually making a White Roux.  To help make it consistent and easy, heat the heavy cream and wine to just below boiling.  Then start melting the butter in another sauce pan.  Once the butter is melted, whisk in the flour and stir until the mixture begins to bubble.  Remove from heat and whisk in the hot cream and wine mixture.  Return to the heat and add cheese, stirring until the cheese is melted.

By heating the cream/wine first and insuring that the roux is bubbling, you should get a great sauce every time.

Delicious! Brought me back to junior year abroad in Paris and my favorite brunch place near the Tuileries.

My only comment to this recipe is the order of business - because of the delicate nature of making the cheese sauce & keeping it from separating, I would put the butter & mustard on the bread slices first and then, while the griddle or skillet is heating up, make the cheese sauce - then you can throw the bread, ham (I used mortadella), and cheese on right away.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe. You should probably use 1/8 of a cup of butter since 1/4 was a tad excessive. Otherwise, the sandwich was delicieux :D

WOW! This recipe is a keeper! This was my first time trying Croque Monsieur of any kind and I loved it. It was very easy to make. After reading some other reviews about how the sauce could be difficult I was a little worried but had no problems with separation at all. My advice is to definitely try this recipe. Very easy and super tasty!

Eh, I dunno...it may just be my inexperience with whisking, but I found the sauce very difficult to make and could not stop it from separating.  It was fine--we made French toast instead.  I don't think I'd try to make this again, at least, not for guests.

A delectable concoction, I prepared this just as directed. We all love it and I've served it several times. My son usually likes only American cheese, but he doesn't take a pass on this one.

I had no trouble with the cheese sauce separating - I just use a large whisk on it. I find the gouda about impossible to grate, so I just cut it into small pieces. 

Ordinarily, I would think that sourdough would be too strong a flavor, but I use Pepperidge Farm, and, when grilled, it adds just the right, not too "bitey" flavor. This is a treat for the palate any way you slice it. The sauce would be excellent for many uses.

Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

Made as suggested with minimal changes - my girlfriend tells me it's one of the five best dishes she's ever had in her life.

I love a good croque monsieur, but I thought this was a lot of effort for a so-so dish.

This will become a favorite Sunday brunch for us.  I have enjoyed this croque in French restaurants, where it is a classic dish.  Never thought it would be so easy to prepare at home.  
I substituted Swiss cheese for grueyere cheese  as had on hand.  Used milk not heavy cream for sauce and it works fine and was delicious.

I made this a few days ago, I'm not fond on Gouda so I use a Gruyere which I love. It worked fine and the sauce was wonderfully smooth.  I had the deli thinly cut the ham and I spread a very thin coat of Dijon on the bread.  Yumm

Didnâ€™t change a thing, but I did heat the butter separately and mixed it with the already heated wine/cream mixture as another review suggested. Excellent recipe.
