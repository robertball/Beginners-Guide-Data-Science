I made the following adjustments:
- Floured and browned the beef first
- Rinsed the browning pan with the wine and 1 cup water (only used half the water since using a crock pot)
- Layered the veggies in the bottom, meat on top, held the spices and bouillon back, cooked on low
- crumbled the bouillon and spices into the pot 2 hours before serving. Crushed the spices between my fingers to release flavor, used 1/2 tsp of each.
- Added 2 bay leaves and a lightly heaping tablespoon of cornstarch.

Wound up a little thin but acceptably so to my tastes. Very flavorful. Keeping the bouillon back towards the end will help keep your meat moist; the sodium draws moisture out.

Extremely tasty! I did not change a thing except coat my meat in flour and brown before adding. I used the slow cooker and layered it as follows: tomatoes, carrots, celery, potatoes, onions, meat. I added 1/2 cup water and 1/4  cup red wine and then cooked on high for 2 hours with no stirring. After 2 hours I began stirring about every 30 minutes and then 2 hours before serving, I added another 1/2 cup water and then the boullion and spices as another member said that the salt in the boullion draws moisture out of the meat if you add it at the beginning and she was right as the meat was nice and tender this way. Add peas 20 minutes before serving. This came out very thick and rich for me and I had to use no thickner, other than the flour coating on the meat. This is by far the best stew I have made. Oh, and I recommend pepper.

I'm not a big stew fan, but this recipe is fantastic!  I used my slow cooker for this recipe. At the suggestion of others, I also doubled the amount of seasoning.  During the last hour of cooking, I added a package of Knorr brand brown gravy mix.  The result was terrific.

I hate to be the one to give this recipe 2 star, but I will explain. I mede it exactly as it is written, and at six hours into cooking, the meat was done, though tough, the veggies were not fully cooked/stil slightly crunchy, it was very bland, and the base was extremely thin and watery. I came back here and took a good look at the reviews and found the problem. Most people changed the recipe. Anyway, I salvaged it by doing most of the stuff listed, turning the oven up to 300 and cooking it for 3 more hours. Then it was very good, but also extremely annoying, especially eating dinner at 9:30. Please, people, stop rating recipes that you have drastically altered and changed. It is very misleading.

this was tasty but sort of thin. I used the crockpot (which was FULL) instead of regular oven and would recommend to cut the water in half. You can always add if it is a little thick, but the liquid that comes from cooking vegetables in a crockpot will make it just right.

Awesome! I used 3pounds of stew meat and didn't cut it into 1 inch pieces, some were bigger...some were almost 3 inches.  I made it in the Crock pot for 8 hours on Low, added frozen corn along with the peas and added more wine (about 3/4 cup) since there was more meat.
My husband told me this was the best Stew he has had in a long time, and also mentioned how the meat wasn't dry at all, I think keeping it in large chunks helped.
I also added some flour at the end to thicken it a bit (Mixed it with some of the beef stew liquid)
Thanks for the recipe!!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe!!  I made it in the crock pot.  I would use a little more spice next time but other than that it was delicious.  I would definitely make this again.

GREAT!  I also went with double seasonings.  Also added salt to taste.  The brown gravy mix at the end is a great addition!
Will make often...

I made this today in the crockpot (8 hours on low) and had it waiting when my husband and I got home from church....What a treat!  He tends to be reserved with his compliments, so his enthusiastic "This is great stuff!" was practically gushing!  :)  I'll definitely make this over and over again.  I actually made half the recipe, but doubled the original spice amounts and it was perfect!

I am the original submitter of this recipe and just made this stew for Christmas Eve after a long hiatus.  Please make the recipe as is.  I've always made it in the crock pot and it turns out perfectly.  It is stew not soup.  It does not need additional moisture.  The original recipe did include 1 T salt, and 1 T sugar and freshly ground black pepper. I usually toss everything into a crock pot except the peas and let it cook all day on low. Then toss in the frozen peas about 30 minutes before serving. It is not a real juicy or tomato-y stew but is what we prefer.  This year I tried cutting the meat into smaller cubes, dusting with flour and browning before adding to crock pot.  I really don't think it made any difference.  I would go back to just tossing the meat into the crock pot raw.  Tapioca is the thickening agent and works just fine without the flour.

This recipe was wonderful - everyone seconds!  I too made it in a crock-pot (low 8 - 10 hours), and added a bay leaf.  It needed additional thickener at the end - some flour/water mixture.  The overall flavor was great.  The wine adds richness.  I'll definitely be making this again.

So so good.  Had to thicken it at the end with a little cornstarch.  Made this in the crockpot; REMEMBER:  always add your spices in the last half hour when slow-cooking.  Otherwise, the flavor cooks out and the result is bland.  This was delicious, will be a favorite this winter.

I read this recipe in a Christmas novel submitted by it's author years ago and have used it since. My kids grew up on it and love it. My sister and I used to make this while on vacation in her crock pot. It's that easy and delish! I recomend this reciipe 100%! Just put everything in crock, stir and walk away. Dinner will be ready when you are. No mess. This recipe will stay in our family forever.

Excellent Stew!  I made this in the crockpot - cooked on LOW overnight (really on low you can cook this for 15-16 hours if necessary).  Minor alterations:   *I did flour and brown the meat, and then put about a cup of beef broth in that pan and DEGLAZED THE BROWNED BEEF BITS, and used that as part of the liquid.  Unlike others, I used the full amount of water (broth) in the crockpot because we like more of a soup than a thick gravy type stew.  Also doubled the spices, and added a bay leaf.  That's it!  By far the best stew I've ever made, and talk about easy! The consistency was just right - not too watery and not too gravy-ish.  This will be something I'll make many times over the years.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good stew!! I made a few changes that made this very similar to Cracker Barrell's beef stew that I love!!  This calls for a lot of onions, so I reduced it to only one and a half chopped onions, added two bay leaves, added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce, I used fresh thyme and rosemary and did not add the marjoram. I used all the water called for. I omited the tapioca and used cornstarch to thicken it up.  This stew is definately a keeper!! Will use again and again. Thx for a great recipe!

We made a modified version of this on our last camping trip. Cubed the meat from a 7-bone roast then seasoned/floured & browned in our camp dutch oven along with the onion & 2 garlic cloves. Forgot about the canned tomatoes, used italian seasoning blend (don't keep to many spices in the trailer), added the veggies an hour into cooking time & cooked another 45 minutes. Vented the lid for the last 30 minutes & no need for tapioca. This was super tasty, rich, thick & oh so comforting on a cool evening in the great outdoors.

I followed the suggestion of others -- used the crock pot and doubled the spices.  Since my husband and I aren't big fans of potato chunks in stews, I omitted them but put a scoop of mashed potatoes in the bottom of our bowls and then poured the stew on top of the potatoes -- still had the flavor of the potatoes, plus the mashed potatoes helped with the extra liquid.  This recipe has replaced mine as

This worked out really well for me. I used organic beef broth in place of the water, added a couple bay leaves and added an envelope of aujus gravy mix. I also switched out the peas for corn. 
(The au jus mix was a stew secret ingredient I learned from my father in law for my own batch of stew. It's not really needed in this stew recipe, as I learned. My mistake, not the recipe.)

Mine turned out a little salty but still delicious. I added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar, which tamed the salt. This recipe makes a lot so be sure you have a large and hungry brood or you'll have leftovers for days.

I'll make this my go-to recipe for stew now. Thanks ever so much to the person who shared it!

This recipe turned out very flavorful.  I didn't follow the suggestions of other viewers and I should have, because they were right, the stew turns out very runny more like a soup. I prefer a thicker stew so I added a little corn starch to the stew and it thickened right up. Delicious! I will make this again and again. My family loved it too.

I really don't understand people complaining about this recipe. I thought it was fine, not my mom's standard but yummy and hearty, although I customized it to my liking. I don't like tomatoes or peas in my stew, I left them out and added 3 times more spices and bell peppers and some extra wine. Just a few points to the complainers:

The reason to stew beef is because it's inherently the worst cut of the animal, just above the leftovers for ground beef. Hence the need to stew as long as needed, could be half hour with excellent meat or 3 hours for old cow... Beef is not the same everywhere. Depending on where you shop, you either get old dairy cow or 2 year old steer. The cheaper the cut, the more chewy it will be. Proper unfrozen aging of the meat removes rigor mortis and provides for blood coagulation prior to packaging.  Some meats that are frozen just after butchering is never tender as the blood didn't coagulate. Buy better non-died meat.

If the recipe is too bland, add flavors you like. A recipe is tailored to you personal taste when you make it, nobody forces you to like someone else's taste.

If the stew is too liquid, add some thickening agent to it. Small glass of cold water with corn starch, flour or even beef gravy mix.

Whenever I do a stew, I simmer the meat until really tender THEN add all the carrots, give them a cooking head start, THEN add the rest for 10 minutes. Potatoes differ, there are hundreds of different types with different cooked characteristics.

The best stew I have ever made!  Thanks.  I followed the recipe, but also the comments of the reviewer for the crockpot method.  It was very flavorful and thick.  Delicious for the holidays when you want a hearty meal ready without more prep!

I used venison and duck instead of beef and dredged it in flour and browned it and placed everything in a slow cooker I also doubled the spices, I also added just about an 1/8 of a tsp of liquid smoke to it….Absolutely Wonderful!

After 12 years of marriage, I finally found a great beef stew recipe!  My son loved it too.  I did all the things everyone said to do.  The only thing was that after six hours in the oven, the potatoes were not soft so I cooked it an extra hour at 350.

I made this in the slow cooker and my husband actually said the words "this is a keeper".  Because slow cookers tend to 'keep' more liquid than a dutch oven, the only thing I would do different next time is use less water.  I doubled the spices and I did add the brown gravy mix at the end. With less water I don't think you would need the gravy mix.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Very good and perfect for the Crock Pot. I used one can of beef broth instead of water and bouillon cubes. And I did increase the spices. Left out the peas, just don't like those in beef stew.

When I made this for the group I cook for, and they loved it. The meat was flavorful and easy for me. I put all of it in a roaster put in 200 degree oven and it is ready by 5:30, and I could get everything else done that needed to be done for the day without worrying about stopping to fix dinner.

Very good and easy to throw together.  No fuss! I cooked mine in the oven at 200 for about 8 hours.  Everything was well cooked.  I also added more herbs and changed mine to thyme, bay leaf, and parsley.  Because I didn't have tapioca, I followed the suggestion of another review and used barley (about 1/4 cup).  I loved the barley and mine wasn't watery at all.  I will make again for sure.

I made this recipe for a Holiday Supper that I hosted for my office - 16 people.  Everyone raved!!  I used a little more of the herbs than the recipe called for.  I would definitely make this again and again.

This is good any time when the weather is cold.  Long cooking time makes the meat fork tender! however...
1. Recipe needs salt
2. I used a bit more meat.
3. Like some other posters, my instinct was to brown the meat in some fat, but I didn't, maybe next time.
4.  I used a very big, heavy skillet with a tight-fitting lid
5.  I used regular tomatoes, not stewed
6.  I did not thaw the peas and recommend that you don't
7. most importantly, instead of boullion cubes, I used 2 teaspoons of "Better Than Boullion" paste and two cups of vegetable stock.  The extra liquid was very helpful, and in fact I don't think it would have worked for me otherwise.

Am I missing something?  The only liquid is 1/4 cup of wine and a bit of tomato juice.  And some say it is too thin and watery?  Someone mentioned cutting the water, but there is no mention of water?

Real good stew recipe. I was wondering what the tapioca would do to stew.. but really it just made the broth a bit thicker. I did add about 1 cup of corn to the recipe. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this according to recipe (even with the peas-- I was skeptical), except that I simmered it on the stovetop. Husband and children gave it a thumbs-up.

I love the colorfulness, I'm tired of bland brown stew, and it was quite tasty. I froze the meat in the wine and vegetable broth until I was ready to make this recipe, marinates while it thaws. I followed advice on adding the spices (along with salt and pepper) towards the end and cut the water in half since I used the crockpot (I actually used vegetable broth instead of water), turned out perfect, didn't need to thicken it at all. Served over a bed of egg noodles, simply delicious.

I chose this dish for the first meal I have ever prepared in a crock pot.  This stew is to die for.  The only changes I made were to double the spices and flour and brown the meat.  The consistency was perfect for us, but I may try adding the gravy next time like others have suggested.  I'll be making this for my family often.

Pretty good!  I agree with everyone else--definitely double the spices, and add some thickener of some kind.  I cooked mine in the crockpot (low, 8 hours).  I omitted the celery and the peas, but that's just because we don't like them.

Excellent recipe.  I love spices so added a lot of extra spice to the dish.  Also, I floured and browned the meat before adding it to the cockpot.  I also used a pork and beef combo for the stew meat.  Added the Knorr's brown gravy mix the last hour, and it was the perfect consistency.  Next time I will add mushrooms as recommended by another reviewer.  I served in round sour dough bread bowls.  Yummy!!  I would have given it 5 stars, but had to read all the reviews first and then modified it accordingly.

I made several adjustments to this recipe, to accommodate what I had on hand, and preferences.  I added 1/2 chopped green bell pepper, skipped the tapioca (as I was afraid it would provide a strange consistency), used 1 15oz. can petite diced tomatoes & 1 15oz. can stewed tomatoes, used beef broth for the water and bouillon, used 1 tsp. Italian seasoning (though next time I would double that) and 1 tsp. montreal steak seasoning, then skipped the red wine altogether.  I cooked in a slow cooker for 2 hours on high heat, then reduced to low for 5 hours.  The meat was very tender and the broth was very rich.  However, it did seem to be lacking in herb flavor.  I may try it next time with the Knorr brown gravy packet as another reviewer suggested.  I also plan on using 1 8oz. can of tomato sauce for half the broth/water next time.  Overall, good recipe, hubby *loved* it, but it could definitely use more seasonings.

3 onions were way too much.  Also turned out a little watery despite I added a brown gravy packet.  I also doubled the spices and used 1/2 cup red wine.  The stew was delicious, but will definitely use 1 onion last time and maybe some barley to thicken the sauce.

This recipe was a little bland although it has potential. This is a good base for a stew however, I think it needs a little doctoring up for enhanced flavour.

I have made this stew 10+ times and my husband and I both enjoy it very much.  I flour and brown the meat. I cook the petite baby carrots in the microwave for 3 minutes to give them a head start, then into the crockpot. Then  I add canned diced potatoes (1 can drained), 1/2 cup celery, 1 cup onions and the tomatoes. Meat goes on top, then 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup Merlot wine. Set on low 8 hours.  At 7 1/2 hours I add seasonings,frozen peas, frozen corn and powdered gravy mix (stir). I serve with salad and rolls. Thanks for the starter recipe and all the added suggestions!

Tried this and it was very easy and a wonderful way to use the veggies from the garden.  It was nice to put it in the oven and forget about it for a few hours.  My husband loved it

I accidentally put the peas in right away and they were fine. I also decreased the water by a 1/2 cup and added a bit of flour at the end to thicken it, but it was totally awesome!

Very good stew. Made in the crockpot I don't think it changed the integrity of the recipe. By accident used one can of tomato sauce and one can of stewed tomatoes , the stew came out fine!

Excellent recipe,I followed other people's advice to flour and brown the meat before putting it in my crock pot and the meat came out juicy and tender and also added more vegetables than the recipe calls for, the whole family liked it! I'll be making it again many times. Thank you Maridele for sumitting your recipe.

This was pretty good. Much much better than anything you can get from a mix, thats for sure! I made it in the crockpot on High for 6 hours, and everything was tender and delicious. Made a great dinner paired with the Amish Bread from this site!

This recipe is fantastic and easy to make/follow. My children and husband ate it all up in one night. My ten year old son even said that it was "BANGING" lol. As suggested by other members I used the crockpot, doubled up on the seasoning, added two bay leafs, and used only half of the water. I usually do not follow recipes but did on this one and was very happily surprised. I've definitly found a beef stew recipe that I will follow and call my own from now on. Thanks everyone!

Okay,I really did not think this was anything special, tasty definitely but...my family LOVED it! There were not any left-overs. ALL GONE.  I used fresh herbs instead of dried. I added a touch of red pepper flakes because we like it spicy. And I did have to thicken it with cornstarch at the end. its a keeper!

First of all, this isn't what I would call beef stew like I'm used to having.  The stew I'm used to having has a really thick hearty sauce, this was rather watery.  However, that aside..... I made this recipe to the letter, and actually fudged a bit on the spices.  I doubled at least the amount of all of them.  I also added in 4 chopped cloves of garlic.  I can describe it in one word...bland!!!  I can eat it with a *lot* of salt and pepper, but it just tastes like beef and vegetables.  The only good thing is that the beef ended up very tender.

Overall, this recipe is really good. I had to add some spices to it, and cut down on the onions. I just thought 3 was too many for our taste. My husband loves it, and asked me to make it two weeks in a row! I made it with the Baked Corn http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Baked-Corn/Detail.aspx recipe on this site. Perfect combination! Thanks for the recipe.

The kids liked it a lot, but it needed much more seasoning. I tried it a second time in a pressure cooker (super fast!) and added about 1/4 tsp red pepper flake and used fresh rosemary and thyme and cut the water to 1/2 cup for the pressure cooker. . . very nice and very quick.

Who'd-a-thunk that rosemary could make or break a stew? This is the way I will make it (with my own improvisations to vegetables) from here on out.

This was just okay- not great but not bad.  The only thing I changed was that I doubled the spices and added some crushed bay leaves, and it still was too bland for my taste. The meat tasted the best after cooking for so long.  I might try again with more spices, or even adding an onion soup packet instead of the onions to liven it up a little.

For a LONG time, I've been searching for a good old fashioned, heart warming stew, and I am so happy to say that I found it with this recipe.  Many of the reviews suggested to double the dry spices and that I did along with using corn starch for a thickening agent since I didn't have any tapioca.  Thank you so much Maridele!  The stewed tomatoes really add a nice touch.

I was very disappointed in the way this dish turned out considering all the rave reviews.  I cooked it for 8 hours on low in the crock-pot.  The sauce was very watery, even though I added the tapioca and the brown gravy mix.  In fact, it was so watery that I had to serve it over egg noodles just to soak up all the juice.  The veggies came out fine.  The beef was fork tender, but was dry inside.  I won't make this again.  I just don't have good luck with crock-pot meals.

Doubling the spices is a must, as is adding a packet of beef gravy mix at the end.  I substitute half the potatoes for diced turnips - great, and 1" pieces of green bell pepper. Take your bread machine out for this one. I made a Potato Rosemary Bread to accompany the stew.  What an RX for a cold winter day!  Thanks!

I'm not usually a big fan of Beef Stew, but this recipe sounded really good.  I served it Christmas night and my family ate it up!  I did thicken it with some potato pearls right before serving as we were using bread bowls and I didn't want it to leak through the bowl.  I probably won't make it again for myself because I prefer to eat vegetarian dishes (the meat was expensive!), but I won't hesitate to make it for a family gathering.  Thanks for the recipe!

OK, I gave this five stars, but I did make some additions. I know how some  of you frown on rating a recipe that you've modified. First I substituted venison for the beef. I did not per-cook or brown it, although I may the next time. In addition to the frozen peas, I added frozen corn and frozen beans. I didn't thaw any of these, just popped them into the mix. My wife got me pearl tapioca and I didn't know what to make of that, but I  just added the same amount. After cooking a while (crock pot) it seemed quite thick so I added a can of Campbell's beef consumee and a can of water. This thinned it out to more of a stew than like the pudding it was. Like any recipe I think one has to be able to adjust it to their way of cooking and tastes. I made this the night before and then kept it overnight in our garage which was at about 50deg F.  We served it the next day (Christmas) along with Butternut Squash Chepotlie Bisque  and it was great. I'll definately make this again.

Sooo good and so easy!  I decreased the meat to 1 1/2 pounds and added mushrooms and a bit more tapioca.  Cooked it in my cast iron qoc au vin pot for 3 1/2 hours on 300 and oh my goodness, soooo yummy!

Had to leave out the peas because my slow cooker is too small at 4 quarts - everything else filled it to the rim. My 5 y.o. asked for seconds and cleaned his bowl twice, which never happens unless sugar is involved.

I made this for my families Christmas meal. It was really pretty good. I browned the meat in some flour then put everything into the crock pot. Easy to make and everyone liked it. I only gave it 4 stars cuz I thought it could have used a bit more seasoning.

I made this for New Year Eve, it was wonderful. I 
floured and browned the beef for some additional flavor/looks, double the herbs, increased the wine (cheap merlot), and used a brown gravy packet as someone else suggested. Really liked the
tomato in the stew.

I have a allrecipes hardcover cookbook with this recipe, and it does say add 2 cups of water, while here, water is not mentioned. Big disconnect. Also in the cookbook did NOT state to cover the pan which I thought was incorrect. I made this once, covering the pan adding only a cup of water but 2 cups of red wine.

This was absolutely delicious!!! I changed it up a bit though! I actually chopped up about four cloves of garlic and added some 
finely chopped red and green bell pepper to the onion and celery
mix, which I sautéed in some butter until opaque! I added some chopped up parsnips and a small turnip to the 
carrots and potatoes! I served it with hot buttered egg noodles 
with some freshly chopped parsley on top! This was more delicious
then any stew I ever had anywhere!

 

My roommate ate three huge bowls of it and fell in love!!!

Best recipe !!!!!So good .Spices just right.Had 1/2 pkg dried onion soup to use up,so threw that in,The wine was merlot.Good sized chunks of carrot and less onion( due to soup mix).Used cornstarch&water to thicken as I lost my tapioca!!!A great recipe to add or subtract what you have on hand.Slow cooker 5-6 hrs.A winner.

I didn't have marjoram, so I substituted sweet basil.  I would definitely recommend another's reviewer's advice and double the spices, as it was a bit bland.  This makes A LOT of stew!  I did add brown gravy mix at the end when I added the peas as the gravy was more of an au jus at that point.

I know some people are saying they cut back on the water - there is no water in this recipe, and it doesn't need it.  I followed it exactly and it was so good!!!!  Give it a try.

Amazing! Best beef stew I've tasted! 

After reading all the reviews and revisions, I went with the recipe as written - no modifications. In the oven, exactly as written. It was/is perfect as written. Thickness is appropriate for stew - very thick. Vegetables and meat were perfect - not tough, not mushy. 

I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a super-skilled cook, but I do ok. I've traveled a lot and know good food; it was great to produce really good food! Thanks!

Just finished making this recipe and it is awesome. I did double the spices, added a bay leaf as well as some salt and pepper but otherwise kept everything the same. I used the slow cooker set on high and it took about 4.5 hours. I did not use flour or pre-brown the beef and the beef is very tender. I think the tapioca is key for making a thick gravy. I also didn't skimp on the red wine. I have a meat and potato husband and he loved it!

We've used this recipe in our family for three generations, starting with my grandmother. My 15-y-o daughter loves this also and she's not a 'stew' girl, preferring fast food or my 'chinese orange chicken' stir-fry. This is an American Family Classic in our home, we use this throughout the winter season - so warm and nourishing!

I have never made a beef stew before, but always wanted to.  I found this recipe, read all of the reviews, followed a couple of suggestions from previous reviewers, and loved it!  I am currently making it again.  We do not like tomatoes, so I used 1 14 oz can of stewed tomatoes and 1 14 oz can of tomato sauce.  I did flour and brown the meat ahead of time, and I layered it all in the crock pot, leaving the spices out.  I added the spices in about 2 hours before serving.  I also added frozen corn and green beans in.  I add the peas, corn and green beans in about 2 hours prior to serving as well.

Delicious!!!My family loved it. We will definitely be making it again. I cut the recipe in half and found that the next time I will use the 1 pound of beef and add more vegetables. I also cooked this in a crock pot all day. Loved it.

Good Stew, I also doubled the seasoning, used 1/2 red wine, omitted the peas,only 1 sml can of stewed tomatoes because that's all I had so instead I used some of tomato sauce, I only put 1 cup of water in the stew and it was still a little watery.

This was wonderful.  I substituted low sodium beef broth for the water and  a little extra pepper.  The beef was tender and perfect even after about 8-10 hours in the crock pot.  My parents drove in Thanksgiving eve and it was the perfect meal for a cold Colorado night!

It was OK. Nothing spectacular. I like barley so I added too much and it sucked all the liquid from the stew. That was probably why it was OK.

I made this for company this evening.  Everyone loved it!  I didn't have tapioca on hand, so just used 3 scoops of brown gravy (amt for making 3 cups of gravy).  I used precut stew veggies from the produce section and it couldn't have been easier.  I doubled the spices and used a bit more wine.  Thanks for the recipe!

It isn't Christmas Eve, but that beef stew was awesome! I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception of pouring in a "bit" more red wine than the called for ¼ cup. And I made it in the crockpot instead of the dutch oven. The aroma of that stew simmering in the pot filled the house within a couple of hours. Wow! And it tastes as good as it smells. THIS is a keeper!!!

Absolutely delicious. I left out the wine because I’m not fond of the taste of wine in  sauces. Everything else was the same.  This will definitely be my go to beef stew recipe. AND....you’re right, it makes lots.  Made it in a slow cooker.

This was worth waiting all afternoon for!  I upped the "1/8th" measurement for the spices to a teaspoon each - my taste buds don't recognize an eighth teaspoon of anything in a huge pot of stew.  I didn't have any tapioca,  and I refused to pay six bucks for a little box of it at the grocery store,  so I used two tablespoons each of  cornstarch and cold water as the thickening agent.  It was freaking great!.

Made in a crock pot, so good. I never measure things precisely, I like to add things and change it up according to what I feel like, as with all recipes, but the recipe is a great one! If it's too watery, thicken it up, I do with either flour or corn starch. Doesn't change how good the recipe is...

This was the best stew I've ever made.  I made it in the Dutch oven.  My boys had seconds, even.  Best flavored gravy of any stew I've ever made.  This is the new house favorite.  Like many reviewers, I floured and browned the meat first.  No tomatoes or red wine, don't like the flavor. 
I used beef stock and seaoned flour for the bullion and tapioca.  Came out great.

I made this exactly as written (+ 2 bay leaves), and I loved it.  It made plenty for dinner that night and for the freezer and leftovers for the week. 

I recommend buy a chuck roast and trimming and cubing it yourself instead of precut stew meat.  It's a little less expensive and you get to size your beef cubes yourself, and trim a little more of the fat.  

Mine simmered in a cast iron dutch oven, and the flavor was fantastic.  It may need a little salt and pepper, but that's purely subjective.

This was delicious, I used a cast iron Dutch oven and it was ready in 5 hours, only changes I made was use a bit more spices and I used beef broth instead of red wine, will make it again for sure!

I just bought a Dutch oven so I wanted to try it out with a stew recipes.  (I've tried stews in my crockpot before but they never came out that good).  THIS recipe is very very tasty - my dinner guests all raved about it and had second helpings!  The meat is tender and the mix of veggies and flavors is delicious.  I followed the advice of another reviewer (Amber Pitts) to a tee.  Read her review to see what I did.   I plan on making this again and again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe on this site!  :)

I don't think I'll be waiting until Christmas Eve to make this again. I had a couple of insignificant changes; i skipped the marjoram (couldn't find it in cabinet) and doubled the thyme, used (2) 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes (that's what I had), 5 oz of peas and 5 oz edamame and 1 cup wine.  I was concerned the onions wouldn't cook down enough but they did.  I thought the consistency was good, it was a bit thinner than I would usually make but it was nice for dunking the dinner rolls. I layered the stuff in the pot, starting and ending with the tomatoes and added salt and pepper for each layer. I ended up having it in the oven for 5 hours at 275 deg. and then on low on the stove top for 30 min while the dinner rolls baked. I will try in crock pot but will soften the onions first for that method.

This recipe needs modification.  I followed the directions and found the meat to be tough, vegetables over cooked and the flavor bland.

Awesome base recipe! It was good just as listed, but then I doubled the seasonings, dredged and seared the meat, seared the chunked onion to bring out the flavor, used fingerling potatoes, added dried shitake mushrooms, and quadrupled the wine (I used a good zinfandel).

I doubled the recipe as well, so no room in my big crock pot. I just put a giant pasta pot on the stove and let it simmer for 3 hours. Searing the meat & onions sped up the process as well as added flavor. (If I'm really in a hurry when making soup/stew I'll sear the carrots and any other slower-cooking veggies as well, while I'm working on the main pot of soup. This substantially speeds up cooking time of the soup and adds flavor that otherwise only would be gained by slow cooking for hours.) 

I served this stew for Christmas dinner with crusty rolls & butter, green salad, & choice of zin, cabernet, or merlot, and EVERYONE was ecstatic!!  (Also had lots of appetizers.) I'll definitely make this stew again - it's the best recipe I've tried, and SO easy. Thanks!
