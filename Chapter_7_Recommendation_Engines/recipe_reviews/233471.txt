I made these for our 4th of July BBQ for two reasons. I wanted a red drink for the holiday and something fruity. 

This drink was good but a bit to tart for my taste. I added a little more simple syrup when I made these. My watermelon wasn't very sweet so that may have been the issue.

I did strain the pulp as someone suggested but next time I don't think I will do that or I will strain some of it but not all of the pulp. I suspect this drink would also taste good made with  other melons.

So delicious and refreshing!  I strained the watermelon before I poured it into the glass.  So good!

I did make some changes and it was delish! I had left over watermelon and the juice, so I cubed the watermelon and froze it and the juice in ice trays, eliminated the ice and put all in the blender! One tray of frozen cubes and 6 cubes of the frozen juice makes 2 large drinks!

In a word - Delicious, though I used vodka as another reviewer did.  I don't enjoy rum.  We enjoyed it so much we're going to do a brunch for friends and feature this drink

We found this to be a bit sweet with rum, so we changed the alcohol to vodka and liked it much more.  Too be fair, I didn't have enough fresh lime juice to put the full 1 ounce in each drink...that may have cut the sweetness...so I squeezed 1/4 of a lime into each glass and muddled it with fresh mint from my garden.  With my changes, we liked this recipe enough to give it 4 stars.  A nice summertime cocktail that assisted us in using up some leftover watermelon.

This is an excellent summertime drink. Watch out, though; it's hard to taste the alcohol! I think my shaker is on the small side, so I had a little trouble fitting all of the ingredients. I just didn't completely fill it with ice and it was fine.
