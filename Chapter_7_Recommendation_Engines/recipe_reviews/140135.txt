I have been looking for and testing different Alfredo Sauce recipes at home and at every restuarant out there. Thanks for this one. It is by far the best I've ever eaten and so easy to make. I did use the conversion to 2% milk because it's all I had in the house (7/8 cup milk plus 1 tablespoon butter). It still came out rich and thick. I left out the cayenne because i don't like the heat and added instead somewhere between 1/4-1/2 tsp of nutmeg, which all true alfredo sauce recipes call fo,r and that put it OVER THE TOP!! I confess I also added a little extra grated and schredded cheese because let's face it, you can never have too much cheese! The more I added, the better it tasted. I have also tried this sauce with chicken and broccoli instead of crab which was also very good. I will use this as a base for any recipe calling for an alfredo sauce in the future. My search is over!! THANKS AGAIN!!!!!

This is awesome! If you've ever had Red Lobster's Crab Alfredo, you won't feel the need to go spend that money anymore, because you can do it yourself at home for cheaper and it tastes the same if not better. This is the first Alfredo sauce that I have ever made, it was quick, simple, easy and called for stuff that I already had, so I didn't even have to leave my house. I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I changed one thing in this recipe after reading the reviews; instead of using 2 cups of half & half, I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of half& half!!!

This was really good! I did not have half and half so I used the whole milk/butter substitution suggestion listed on the tips and advice substitutions page on this site. I also doubled the recipe and used a little extra parm. cheese. Everyone loved it. I will definately make this again!!

This was an excellent Alfredo recipe.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut the half and half with milk.  Next time I make this I will also either cut back on or omit the cayenne pepper.  The taste was excellent, but the spice was a little much after a while.  I highly recommend this recipe.

The sauce for this was too thick; I had to add whole milk to thin it out, and it was still very thick and tacky.  The cayenne pepper was overwhelming and I could barely taste the crab (I even used more crab than the recipe called for, but it didn't help).  It was OK, but really, no better.

This was crabtastic!!  My DH was craving some crab and this fit the bill, along with some crab legs on the side.  I did use 1 cup milk with 1 cup half & half. I didn't think there would be enough sauce, but there was plenty more than pasta and it fed the 4 of us with extra left over,which was still good the next day.  I did use real dungeonous crab and parmigiana reggiano. It's easy to eat a lot and get totally stuffed, so pace yourself! I served with cheddar bay biscuits, but use club soda in place of milk for fluffier biscuits.

This was ok.....I added more half and half because the sauce was very thick.  I think next time I'll add more garlic and less cayanne pepper.  Even though my son ate it he said it was hot so next time I'll reduce it to 1/4 of a teaspoon but def. more garlic.  It was good but needs tweaking

Very good! I made this the other day for my roommate and myself. I used 1 cup half-and-half and one cup 2% milk instead of the two cups half-and-half... very decadent! Next time I will likely half the amount of cayenne pepper used, though. It was just a little too spicy.

My version:

2 T. Butter;
2 T. flour;
2 garlic cloves crushed;
salt and pepper to taste;
a pinch of cayenne;
2 to 2 1/2 c. milk (or 1/2 and 1/2);
8 oz (or more) crab meat;
3 oz cream cheese;
1/2 cup grated Parmesan;

Cook the dish as instructed in the original recipe.

The first problem with the original recipe is 3/3 butter/ flour to 2 cups milk is a very thick white sauce (almost enough to bind a croquette mixture) so use the classic white sauce proportions of 2/2/2. The half and half is not what is causing the excessive thickness but you can use regular (or even 2%) milk and it won't cut down on the richness too much. 1/2 tsp. of cayenne is way too much unless you like your food Indian HOT. Use just a pinch and taste the mixture. Alternatives that give a flavor boost would be a little nutmeg as in a classic bechamel or about 1/2 tsp. of Coleman's dry mustard as in classic Crab Imperial sauce. Depends on what you like. I also reduced the cream cheese to 3 oz. because the gums in the cream cheese add to the excessive thickness. You can thin with a little more milk or water if it is still thicker than you like but careful not to make it too thin.

We didn't have half and half, so we mixed one and half cups of milk and 1/2 cup of butter. Also cut the cayenne as other reviewers suggested. We used fresh crab leg meat. This is definitely NOT a delicate meal, it's extremely hearty and fattening, but OH SO worth it!!!! It is perfectly thick, I like a nice thick sauce. We separated the crab so it was just in the dish we ate that night. The left overs in the fridge the next day were solid, but melted right back down in the microwave and was still just as good as the night before, even without the crab...I couldn't get enough!

Its a good recipe but I agree, too thick.  I added some fat free milk to thin it down and used some Phillips Seafood Seasoning to give it a little more flavor.  I think the Phillips beats out old bay when it comes to things like cream of crab soup or alfredo.  Cut the cayenne pepper in half and add the Phillips.  Makes a huge difference.

Tastes great but the sauce is WAY TOO thick!  If I had known it would come out so thick I would have cut out the flour and added only one tablespoon of cream cheese.  I can always use it as crab dip :)

This is very good.  I have made it with the crab as written, which is great.  But I've made the sauce without crab many times for different purposes.  It's great for chicken alfredo pizza.  I use fat free half & half and reduced fat cream cheese and it's still decadent and delicious.  It does make a lot of sauce.  When I used it for crab alfredo I only ended up using half the sauce with the amount of fettuccine in the recipe.

Outstanding!!  Made this for my wife's birthday and she LOVED it.  I wonder how substituting Old Bay (and maybe part of the salt due to the salt in Old Bay) for the cayenne would make it taste?  The recipe is great as it is.  This is a keeper!!

I made this for me and my boyfriend and he loved it! I don't know if I accidentally added too much cayenne pepper but it seemed a bit spicy (even for me & I love spicy) so I might cut back a bit on that the next time.....pretty easy to make but I have to admit I started to panic when I got to adding the flour to the butter mixture....I was worried I might have messed up but after adding the half-n-half & cheeses and kind of beating/whisking/stirring with a fork I got that 'creamy' texture I was looking for. Over all I gave this a 4 stars but my fella said 4 to 5 ....so I went ahead and said 5 stars. Easy and delicious :)

I have been trying to recreate the Red Lobster Crab Alfredo for years and this may be even better than the restaurant version. The addition of the cayenne pepper really gives it that little extra kick that puts this recipe on my five-star list. Thanks so much for sharing. This is now my go to alfredo.

I made this exactly as written, except I cut way back on the cayenne.  It didn't taste anything like alfredo to my family, more like a garlicky cream sauce which is not what I was looking for.  I read this compared to Red Lobster's crab alfredo by a couple of reviewers, don't expect it to be anything like that.

My kids luv an Alfredo sauce when we go out so I was lookn for one to make. This one was good for my tastes but I would not call kid-friendly. I would either cut the Cayenne to 1/8 tsp or replace with Old Bay maybe..?.. Made for GF and Mother. GF and I liked but too much heat for Mom. Will continue to change for my kiddos...

This is a good alfredo recipe, but the crab in it tastes nothing like the restaurants I've been to. It just doesn't compliment this dish very well. I think next time I'll leave out the crab and substitute chicken.

Very nice.  I added some spinach to it to make it more of a well rounded meal.  I also couldn't help adding more cream cheese, yum.

Neither me or my hubby liked this. The sauce was wayyy too thick and tasted too much like flour. I had to add alot of milk to try and thin it out and it still was terrible.

I would have given it a 5 but it took longer than time suggested. My family loved it! We didn't add spice as we don't like heat but did add fresh lemon juice of 1 lemon when served and it was a hit. I will definitely make often!

With just one change I think this would be a 5 star recipe.  The sauce was too thick and tasted too much like cream cheese even after adding extra cream and milk.  Next time I'm going to try using half the amount of cream cheese.  Otherwise, the flavor was very good.  I used fat free cream cheese and fat free half and half and it still tasted really good, my husband didn't notice a bit:)

This was excellent. The only change I made was Old Bay instead of the cayene and bit more garlic.  I did use shrimp instead of crab. I sauteed the shrimp in a small amount of butter, white wine and fresh pressed garlic before adding to the sauce.

This recipe was very tasty and easy to make.  We substitued fat free evaporated milk for the half and half and light cream cheese with success.  We also made it with shrimp instead of crab and loved it.  They cayenne pepper added just enough depth of flavor to make this a company worthy recipe.

This was great!  My boyfriend (who loves crab) said it was in his top two dishes that I make and that he can't wait until I make it again!  I served it with garlic bread sticks and used rotini pasta instead of fettuccine, and I feel that the thickness of the sauce was perfect for rotini, but could see how it would be too thick for fettuccine.

I rarely rate low...but this just wasn't that special. Actually, it would be great as a crab dip, but for pasta sauce, I felt that it was a little bland. It wasn't awful, but I won't make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe,if you really like it cheesy, add 2 cups of cheese. Also to give it an extra kick add shrimp and scallops to the sauce also.I also skipped the cream cheese and it still came out great.

This was the best Alfredo sauce I've ever had! It was quick and easy and so delicious. I ended up with TONS of leftover sauce, though. Next time, I'll cut the sauce recipe in half.

WOW! I had some leftover crab from a Thanksgiving dip I needed to use up so I thought I'd try my hand at making this dish. I've never made an alfredo before but this was super simple. It was incredibly delicious. I did add chopped red pepper and fresh parsley for added veggie content. The sauce tasted just like Olive Garden's alfredo, and it will definitely be made again and again for special occasions or nights where a rich, gourmet dish is requested. Highly recommended, thank you!

This dish was amazing and SO filling. I haven't been this full since Christmas!I added some steamed broccoli to the sauce. Next time I make this I will use less cheese or add milk to make the sauce a little thinner. I have FINALLY found my alfredo sauce recipe. Thanks!

This was sooooooooo bland. It's my mother in law's favorite dish at Red Lobster so I wanted to make it  for her for her birthday last night. I couldn't even eat it and gave mine to the dog.  She told me not to fret that once she got her's home that she would fix it up to taste good. Do not use cream cheese and find a better cheese other than parmesan.

This is a lovely sauce! I had a 16-oz can of good-quality crabmeat so I doubled everything here except the cayenne pepper. At 1/2 tsp it was still plenty! I used butter and half & half, so added Neufchâtel cream cheese to cut the calories just a bit. Had already used up my block of Parmesan cheese, but had a very firm wedge of aged Gouda and it worked quite well. Will try this again when I next need Alfredo sauce.

I made this dairy free. I used almond milk instead of half and half, margarine, vegan Parmesan and vegan mozzarella for the cream cheese. I thought I had vegan cream cheese and it was sour cream so I had to think fast. I used nutmeg instead of cayenne and used broccoli and chicken instead of crab. I also used whole wheat penne. It was great. Next time I will used the crab meat and cream cheese. It was and easy dairy free meal.

Decadent, yes. Delicious, absolutely! I followed the recipe exchanging only one and a half cups half and half with a little more than half a cup two percent milk. I would make this again and again. I happened to have fresh crab legs left over and it was to die for. Everybody in my family loved it.

tripled the recipe for our family of six and some for my son-in-law and daughter who is expecting.    used neufchatel cream cheese and half cream and half  2% milk.  saved  a few calories and  was still creamy and decadent.  definitely would make again!!

I've made this delicious recipe twice now. I gave 4 stars only because I made several changes. The changes were primarily for health reasons. I used olive oil in place of butter and reduced-fat cream cheese (neufchatel) as well as fat-free half & half. I significantly increased the garlic & omitted the  cayenne pepper as personal preferences and omitted the salt because I follow a low sodium diet. I also used chicken and added broccoli. I will definitely be making this regularly.

This has been my go to Alfredo recipe for years. So easy and full flavor! I use penne pasta and mix in whatever veggies I have on hand (peppers, zucchini, shredded carrots, peas, for example) to add color and change up the flavors. Works great with shrimp, lobster, crab (pretty much all seafood), salmon, chicken, steak or whatever meat you have.

This was very delicious.  I followed others suggestion and increase the liquid amount with 1/2 of it being 1% milk.

I left out the garlic and cayenne, but I sautéed some bell pepper and onion and added that instead, and I topped with diced roma tomatoes. I did have to thin the sauce some, but it turned out rich and creamy. Definitely going to make again with these changes.

Outstanding! Based on some of the reviews, I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp and thinned with a splash of milk after adding crab, otherwise followed recipe.  This was quick, easy and absolutely delicious!

I'm a 16 year old guy and I made this dish for my family and I have to say, it's delicious! The sauce had the perfect consistency when I added 1/3 cup of milk in addition to the half and half. I added extra garlic and cayenne pepper seasoning because we like our food more spicy. The addition of about a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning put it over the top. If you have family coming over, this is the perfect recipe!

I made this and doubled the recipe. I used half and half and milk equally, cut back on the cayenne and added some old bay. Used the crab meat but added Italian sausage instead of doubling the crab. As other reviewers have suggested it was too think so I ended up cutting it with more milk. I would say it was outstanding and so would my wife who got it for dinner on Mother's Day. Kids are too young to appreciate a good meal yet but ate it up none the less!

This was very, very flavorful. I followed the directions almost to the T, except I mixed the cooked noodles into the sauce. This caused the sauce to "clump" together with the noodles, making it seem much more thick than it really was. In the future, I will merely put the sauce on top of the noodles. Live and Learn!

Made this to night and loved it.  Sauce is creamy, which is how I like it.  I added chili powder instead of the cayenne pepper and it added a nice little bit of heat.  Will make this again soon.

This recipe was way to thick! I ended up adding regular milk to thin it out some and then of course it did not have enough garlic taste. Next time I make it, I will cut down on the flour and triple the chopped garlic  I follwed this recipe to a T. So this is just my humble opinion. ;)

Delicious! Just like Red Lobster!  I made it a bit lighter by using low fat cream cheese and also 1% milk instead of cream (but I added just a bit more butter.)  At first when you are stirring it, the mix looks like it's all lumpy and it won't work - but then eventually it all comes together nicely.  I did whisk it with a fork to get any flour lumps out.  Use the shredded Parmesan cheese in the plastic tub that you get in the deli section for some stringiness to the sauce.   I'm sure you can go Gluten Free on this recipe and skip the flour - it can thicken up on it's own without it.  I didn't measure the cayenne, so I ended up putting a bit too much in (hubby loved it, kids thought it was a tad spicy, but not bad) so to tone it down I added fresh chopped spinach and some chopped tomatoes.  I must say - the colors of the spinach and tomato really made it pop!  Added a little healthy flair to boot.  The whole family loved it and thought it was DELICIOUS.  Also threw in some left over shrimp - great dish!  Kids were 10 and 12 and gobbled it right up.

My edits:
1.  Used 1% milk instead of half and half
2.  Used low fat cream cheese
3.  Added a bit more butter
4.  Used 2x the garlic
4.  Added shrimp
5.  Added chopped fresh spinach and fresh tomato
6.  Used linguine

After everything cooked, I poured all the pasta in a bowl and poured the sauce on top and tossed well so the pasta was coated.

I'm thinking mushrooms and/or peas would also go well in the dish.

Enjoy!

Excellent! I made this recipe as is, but with a pinch of nutmeg added. I almost always add a bit of cream cheese to my cream soups to enhance the texture, so when I saw the suggestion here to do the same, I was pretty sure I recognized a winner (for my palate anyway). It isn't the kind of meal I'd make more than once a year or so because of the shear calories/fat/etc, but I really think skimping on the ingredients it calls for would be tragic.

The sauce is creamy and rich and brings out the flavor of the crab meat. I will definitely be making this again! I left out the cayenne pepper and I only used one Tbsp of flour instead of three. The sauce turned out the right consistency this way.

I wanted to love this especially because I love Alfredo and crab. However, this was super thick/rich, even after I added more milk!!! I just have a family of three(husband, myself and baby) so I cut it down to 3 servings and it served more like 4 to 5. I thought this was bland in flavor even after I tried "doctoring it up" ... still blah. I will not make this again and would not recommend this.

very good sauce, i'm a fan of spicy food but this could maybe use a little less cayanne, if only because it overwhelms the crab flavor. i also used 1% milk instead of half and half because that's all i had and it turned out just fine. will definately keep this recipe around!

This tasted very good but I used canned crab (2 6oz) and I was disappointed that their were no chunks of crab meat.  It would've made the recipe a 5.  Also, next time I will omit the cayenne pepper as it was too spicy for my 3 year old and I had already halved what the recipe called for. I used "lite" cream cheese and 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 1/2 cups of skim milk since it was what I had on hand.  It was still very creamy and delicious.

This was pretty good.  I added a cup more milk, more fresh cracked black pepper and more garlic.  I didnt put the spicey stuff in it, our family wouldnt eat it.  But good stuff, a little goes a long way, its very rich, and sweet.  Thanks a bunch!

Incredibly good! This could rival any good seafood place for sure. As everyone else has said, it's a great alfredo sauce in and of itself. 

We toned down the cayenne pepper and used 1 cup half and half and 1 cup 1% and it was still SUPER thick. I think next time we'll do both cups 1% milk.

I am the only one in my house who likes alfredo so I made this for myself as a treat.  Let's just say that I ate this for 3 days straight and when it was gone I wished that I had more.  Excellent recipe!!

My family doesn't care for crab so I substituted chicken and it was very good!  Will make it again.

we followed this recipe exactly.  we thought it could use a little more garlic and it definitely needed to be thinner.  Perhaps with more half and half or less cream cheese, it would be perfect.  Liked the taste though...STUFFED!!

I surprisingly liked the cayenne and crab meat, although I may use chicken or shrimp next time.

Delicious.  Sauce a little thick but made up for in flavor.  The hot pepper accented the flavor giving a nice bite.

This is a very rich dish but very delicious! My 18mo daughter couldn't get enough of it! We all like spicy food so I added a little bit more pepper. Next time I will use a full box of fettuccini as I feel it made more sauce than pasta.

This was AMAZING. My family is over there licking the spoon as I type. Next time I will half the pepper as I have small children but for the rest of us it was perfect! I will keep this one in my book forever.
