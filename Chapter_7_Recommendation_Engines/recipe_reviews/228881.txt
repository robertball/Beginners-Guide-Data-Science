Delicious.. the creamy texture is wonderful. I used the florets and stems of a whole broccoli since it was going to pureed anyway... cheaper. Now I need to figure out how not to eat all of it as a snack.. would be a nice chip dip or even a spoonful on top of hot soup

I absolutely love this pesto. I used feta cheese instead of Parmesan because my my Parmesan was moldy. But is was still delicious. I used it on some pasta and I also had some on crackers. I almost prefer to eat it on crackers it is that good. I will make this again.

Easy, fast recipe! Two full cups of broccoli!?!? You won't be forcing anybody to eat their green vegetables with this sauce! It is out of this WORLD!
I had to forego the pine nuts and the fresh basil. I did use 1/4 cup dry basil and threw in a handful of pimiento-stuffed olives. I ended up adding more EVOO and used the liquid from steaming the broccoli for the broth.  And I substituted Pecorino Romano for the Parmesan! I slow-cooked 2 large chicken breasts in Italian seasonings, then I shredded the chicken and mixed with the Pesto sauce, and served over Penne pasta. Flexible recipe that can be expanded upon in many ways!

Both broccoli and traditional basil pesto are among my favorite foods, and this recipe made me feel like I'd gone to heaven.  I've eaten it on pasta, spread as a layer on salmon and baked/broiled, and just straight out of the food processor because it's so darn good.  I didn't have broth, so I just adjusted the oil to get the consistency I wanted.  Simple and delicious.

It was not creamy at all, way too dry and clumpy and had no delicious taste to it. I had to add jarred Alfredo sauce to the mixture to make it somewhat edible!

I didnâ€™t have all the ingredients, so I made a lot of substitutions. It came out OK.

I had overripe broccoli that I didn't want to throw away, so I used it in this recipe. It turned out a lite yellow-green, but the taste was still outstanding!  I used only 2 cloves of garlic, but there was still plenty of garlic undertones.  I used more than 2 cups of broccoli, and a little more veg broth ( I didn't measure how much-I just always dump it in).  The cayenne made it too spicy for me, so next time, I'm going to skip the cayenne.  This recipe made a double batch for me since I added additional broccoli.  My family loved this recipe, and it's a great ways
