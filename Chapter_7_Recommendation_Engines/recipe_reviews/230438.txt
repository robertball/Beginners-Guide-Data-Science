This recipe was not bad at all. I made it for a Christmas Eve get-together with my family, and we ate it with baby back ribs. It was not too difficult to make and my family enjoyed it. I used chopped fresh spinach, which was what I had on hand, and that was delicious, but I wasn't sure how much of it to use from just looking at the amount of frozen spinach listed in the recipe. The crepes took the longest amount of time to prepare, even though it was pretty simple to do. I added just a tablespoon or two of sugar to my crepe batter to round out the flavors. But, the crepe batter made a lot of extra crepes! I took the extras to Christmas morning breakfast with some different jams and fresh whipped cream. Also, I didn't have any wax paper, but had no problems with taking my crepes apart after stacking them up.

We thought this was very good.  I made half the recipe but used the full amount of spinach which worked out very well.  Next time I will sauté’ some onions instead of using the onion powder.

Delicious!  I made this for Christmas Eve. And my family loved it.   I did not make crepes, I used manicotti tubes instead.  The only other change I made was using fresh spinach.  This may be a new tradition for us.

My wife has a gluten sensitivity, so I substituted gluten-free all-purpose flour and it turned out great!  Family and guests absolutely loved it.

I doubled the spinach and added garlic. It was wonderful and everyone loved it.
