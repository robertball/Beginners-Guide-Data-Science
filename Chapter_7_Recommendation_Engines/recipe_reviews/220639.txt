I use frozen broccoli in place of the peas and cream of chicken in place of the cream of celery. The leftovers from this casserole rewarm well, if there's any leftover. NOTE: If you don't have ham, this is also good with tuna fish or leftover rotisserie chicken.

I was in a hurry, so I didn't sautee' onions and garlic.  I just used the spices.  Used skim milk and fat free sour cream and instead of Cheddar, used Colby Jack.  This was delicious and I will definitely make again, but next time I will follow the directions and it should be even better!  Hope you try this one and enjoy it as much as I did.  I didn't use the french-fried onions, either,but will the next time :-)

I can't believe more people haven't tried this recipe - it's awesome! I followed the recipe exactly except I only used 2.8 oz of fried onions and found that to be plenty.  I thought the peas went well in this dish.  I did use the large elbow mac which made it more fancy and fun.

Onion, garlic and soup flavors were overpowering.  Also, baking in such a shallow dish caused the caserole to be too dry.  Will not make again.

I made this last night, and will definitely make it again. I made a few changes, just because I did not have the ingredients on hand. I used rigatoni instead of macaroni. I missed that I needed sour cream and used Greek yogurt in its place. Also, I did not buy enough fried onions, so used 1/2 as much as called for. I think that the it would have been even better with all of the fried onions.  Oh, and finally I used 2 cups of chopped ham, because I wanted to use all of my left overs. I definitely would keep that change, it actually could use more than that.

I honestly had low expectations for this dish- only picked it because I had all on hand. But it was pretty good. I used sour cream mixed with onion soup mix and that was so much added flavor. The French fried onions are so good. I'm glad I tried it

Great way to use leftover holiday ham.  Husband thought it was a little salty.  I thought it was easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  Thought it could have used a little more zip, like some pepper Jack cheese, perhaps.

Nothing special about this casserole. I would probably make it again to use up leftover ham. I used mixed veggies in stead of peas but other than that I followed the recipe.

My husband and father in law loved it so much they went back for second helpings and were excited to have it for lunch the next day. I didn't have the French fried onions and used crushed corn flakes instead and I swapped out the cream of celery soup for cream of mushroom soup. I also added some green beans.  Came out awesome. Will be making it again for sure.

Very tasty and great for leftover ham!  I halved the recipe, except for added a full can of soup and a full cup of peas.  I also used fusilli noodles.  My family liked it a lot!

We all loved this!  Great way to use up that leftover Easter ham.  I followed the recipe exactly except used a bit more ham and cooked in a 2 qt casserole dish. Fabulous!  Will definitely make every time I've got leftover ham!

Delicious and easy!  Didn't add garlic or onion powder since it was already in there and used cream cheese instead of sour cream.  Will definitely make again.

From age 6-47, my family LOVES this.  It takes me about an hour to chop this up and prepare.  I make it the night before and bake the next night for dinner, I extend the cook time by about 10 mins.

Most of my family liked this.  I followed the recipe, except I used frozen broccoli and I played around with quantities.  I added 2 cups of ham, the whole package of frozen broccoli  3/4 cup sour cream, and 1 1/4 cup milk.  I also sprinkled cheese on the top when I added the french fried onions.  I also  added a little salt and it could have used a little more.  Pepper would be a good addition as well as Parmesan cheese, I'll try those next time.

our family loved this recipe and look forward to having it in the future!   It was a great way to use up some leftover spiral ham.  I made a few substitutions.  I did not have cream of celery soup, so I used cream of mushroom I had on hand.  We also prefer broccoli over peas and I used fresh broccoli.  I cut the french-fried onions in half and still felt it was plenty.  It helped to lessen the calories a bit in this dish.

Love this recipe.  I did change it and it fed 4 people and 1/2 for leftovers.  I tripled the amount of ham and cheese.  I also added a cup of corn.

I followed the recipe exactly (measurements AND ingredients). I thought the pasta amount was WAY TOO MUCH. The cheese, ham and peas disappeared. Nothing holds the noodles together, they're just dry. No flavor, just bland. I had to add salt and pepper to try and help, but sadly it did not. The onion topping was the best part. Now I'm trying to figure out how  to fix the rest of it, if I can't, then it's trash. I will not make again. It should be called "Pasta casserole with some ham and peas". Sorry. : (

I was making it exactly as the recipe, but as I tasted it before cooking in the oven, I couldn’t help myself.  I shouted” holy moly that’s good! I gotta add more ham!” So I added an additional 1/2 cup. The dish came out super yummy and I’ll be doing this one again! Thank you!

This is the first time I have ever left a review but this recipe is really really good.  I didn't have peas so I cooked some broccoli and added it to it along with a bit of more salt and pepper.  It was wonderful reheated as leftovers as well.  Yummy!!!!

Very great recipe! Only deviation from this recipe was I left out the sour cream (I don’t like it and it doesn’t like me). A great way to use leftover ham! The French fried onions really enhanced the result!

Due to ingredients on hand, I made a couple of substitutions as another reviewer mentioned - used frozen broccoli florets instead of frozen peas and cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery. My family raved about this recipe!

Very flavorful but a little dry for my taste. I followed the recipe exactly only adding marjoram and cayenne for our particular taste. It was dry. Maybe needs more milk or pasta cooking water.

The modifications I made were to double the ham, substitute cream of mushroom soup, and half the French onions. As recommended by others, next time I will sauté the onions a bit longer to soften them more. The family enjoyed the casserole.

I used this recipe because I had some leftover ham I needed to use up. I added a few more spices, onions and peppers. I also used bread crumbs instead of fried onions. Super tasty and the family loved it!

I loved this! Garlic and onion is a staple in my house! Just perfect! Added cheese on top too! Thanks for the tip...put tinfoil over and it came out perfect! So creamy, cheesy goodness. Just the perfect way to use up our leftover thanksgiving ham!! This will be made again!!

I halved the recipe but forgot to half the soup amount, so added a little more milk to the mixture. The results worked and the casserole was not too dry and tasted okay. I  will make it again when looking of a quick and simple dish.

I have made this recipe several times- first with ham and egg noodles, then with  flavored chicken sausages . It never fails.  I prefer the egg noodles over a heavier pasta. Tried adding water chestnuts for a crunch but  didn't add the texture I wanted. May try some almonds next time

I made this casserole exactly as written. It was very good for something so simple. A great way to use up and left over ham from a holiday meal. I will make it again. This is a good recipe to enjoy as is.  Soup or  vegetables of your choice may be used to suite your taste.

I made this ahead of time and froze it. Thawed and cooked according to directions and had to let it cook a little longer. The family loved it. The onions on top are the key. It's a great make ahead dish. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  Important tips:  1) don't forget to salt the pasta water, 2) don't overcook the pasta since it will cook some more in the oven and 3) add about 1 tsp of salt to creamy mixture.  I put in frozen broccoli florets and added crumbled bacon/ cracker topping on top.  It was ah-mazing.  My husband, who doesn't like casserole type dishes, went back for seconds. :)

This was really good and will be a repeat in the house.   I did not have Cream of Celery soup so I substituted Cream of Mushroom.  I did have some fresh celery on hand so sautéed that with the onion and ham.  I also didn't have peas so I used broccoli instead.  I used leftover Easter ham something about the smoked ham flavor with the cheese and veggies, everyone loved it.

Turned out very good (better than I expected). The instructions did say to use elbow noodles (the type in Mac & Cheese), but, the picture seemed to show either wide Egg noodles or Rotini style noodles. I tried both (together) with two (2) cups Rotini and one (1) cup Egg. I found that I liked the Rotini better, as it seemed to hold the cheese better. I haven't had this type of casserole in a LONG time (in fact, not since my Mom last made it for me over 20 years ago [rest her soul]). In fact, you could've called this recipe [better] "Ham & Cheese" casserole. -- So overall (again) a very good effort of a tasty casserole (not as good as Moms [was], but still very good). The only thing I would change is adding MUCH more Ham (but I am a meat "freak" so this is a personal preference thing). Try it out (most will like it ;-)

Enjoyed very much!  I only sautéed the onions for about 4 min and I could easily detect the firm-ish texture in the finished dish. I LOVE  all versions of onions but my kids would prefer a more subtle texture so next time I will sauté longer. I also didn't fully read the directions and I added the fried onions on top of the casserole before I put it in the oven. I Lightly covered with foil for the first 20 minutes and then removed for the last five and it was great.

I used this as a base recipe. Used cream of mushroom soup. Used cream cheese instead of sour cream. Used extra milk. Added shredded Velveeta and some shredded pepper jack cheese. Everyone ate it. I will use this recipe again for leftover ham. Quick and easy.

Was very good . The only thing I did different was added chopped red pepper for more color.  Definitely will make again with these possible changes like; mix fro.veggies,more of the sauce mixture to make it more creamy.  Found the macaroni soaked up much of the sauce. Also liked the idea of adding Worcestershire sauce.  Keeper recipe ??

Yummy!  However, I made modifications based on what I had on hand -- and it turned out great!  First, I doubled the recipe because I wanted to use the 3 cups of ham I had, so I doubled the macaroni and soup. I used 2 cans of soup and used what I had -- cream of onion and nacho cheese soup. After sautéing the onion, ham and garlic, I added the soups, milk, sour cream, etc. and added 4 oz of cubed velveeta -- which made it creamy and cheesy. I added the rest of the ingredients and after putting in a greased casserole dish, I put 8 oz of shredded cheese on top. I didn't have the onion rings so just used the shredded cheese. Actually, i think it was better without the onion rings because it was salty without it and they would've added more salt. Definitely a hit and one I will make again!!

Tasty comfort food meal. A few changes were to add fresh mushrooms with the peas and omitted garlic powder. The fresh garlic was grea!

Okay, my family loved this casserole. I picked this recipe cause I needed to clear a few items out of the freezer. So obviously my review is based on my needed changes! Leftover ham,
broccoli (instead of peas) and leftover veggie dip(instead of sour cream) 
TIP: Since I hate to waste food I always freeze any leftover sour cream based dips to use in recipes later.

simple to make and delicious! I had a ham steak that wanted to try something different with and saw this recipe. My wife asked what was smelling so good! creamy, flavorful and cheesy! I love garlic, so went a little heavier with the minced garlic than recipe calls for and it did not take away from the other flavors. Will definitely make again!

I made this using cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery and I used a whole box of elbow pasta.  Next time I would increase  the sauce amount as all of the liquid was absorbed by the pasta this time.

This recipe was a huge hit with my whole family. A true comfort food! I made it with leftovers I needed to use up  and it was absolutely delicious. Cut up a ham we had baked and used  leftover broccoli in place of peas. I added one can of corn and a can of creamed corn which made a great addition. I wish I had remembered to use some of her celery I had in the fridge. Next time I will sauté celery with the onion for an additional crunch. I didn't have any French fried onions so I topped with buttered bread crumbs but I think the onions would have been much better. My kids didn't even let me get it in the oven without tasting it. Doesn't happen too often in my house that everyone love the same meal! A keeper for sure!!

I didn't have any of the onion bits for the top, so instead of mixing the cheese into the casserole, I spread it across the top, and then sprinkled crushed cracker crumbs over the cheese.  This created a crispy topping as well and was thoroughly enjoyed by me and the kids!

Great way to use leftover Ham.   I used 2 cups of Ham and subbed in Cream of Mushroom soup. Topped it with crushed snack crackers.  Made enough for supper and an extra casserole in the freezer.  Really tasty.

Thought it needed a bit of "punching up". In a jam, for a potluck dish and plenty of ham on hand. Substituted wide egg noodles for elbow macaroni. More tender. No cream of celery soup, so added an additional 1 c chopped celery to onion sauté. No cream of celery, so substituted 1/2 can cream of mushroom. No extra salt at all, but maybe a Tablespoon of fresh ground pepper. Every other ingredient the same. It was vaporized as I was at the end of the long food line. Even the pan scrapings were delicious. Yep, I will make this one again!

It was pretty bland, my BFF wasn't impressed,  but it was more flavorful the next day.   I followed the recipe,  except did add some trader Joes 21 seasoning and doubled the ham.   good base recipe.

Because some said it turned out bland, I mixed in a tablespoon of Dijon mustard; I usually add mustard to ham-based casseroles.  Also, based on others' advice, I covered it with foil for the initial 25-minute cook time, then uncovered after topping with the FF onions.  (The onions make this dish btw, so don't skimp -- use the whole 6 ounces!)  Everything else was exactly as written.  It turned out perfect!  Another (tasty) way to use up all that leftover Easter ham, this one's a keeper.

As advertised, this is great comfort food. It's really Mac and Cheese with some ham and green peas thrown in. I use cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery because I'm not a big fan of celery. It was a great dish. I'd highly recommend it.

Followed the recipe, the only thing changed was I used rotini instead of macaroni. Also only put 1/2 tablespoon of garlic as we don't like strong garlic favors. I love peas, and I love ham, and I love combining the two. I didn't want it to dry out in the oven as some other reviewers mentioned this happening, so I covered it with foil taking it off when I put on the French fried onions. It came out of the oven with just the right consistency. So I'm wondering if the reviewers that had issues with it being to dry maybe substituted the frozen peas with a non-frozen veggie. I'm thinking that the frozen peas let off moisture as they thaw and bake. Maybe, maybe not? It is a tad on the salty side, but not so much that it is unpalatable. My hubby who tends to more frequently voice his opinion if he doesn't like something, said "it was good" and he "liked it" and that is about as enthusiastic as it gets from him. So I think this recipe was tasty and will probably be made again.

Is was very good! I used cream of mushroom instead because that's all I had. Put in an actual casserole as I just thought it'd look better. Also, after the 1st 25 minutes it did look a little dry so I put 3 or 4 more splashes of milk in and a thin layer of cheese on top under the Frenches. Put it back in for 8 and it was so good!! My advice is don't skimp on the milk. Easy and delish!

This was yummy. I tripled this to freeze ahead and give to my disabled friend.  I omitted the milk but used more sour cream (to use it up) then added about a cup + of reserved salted pasta water

I made it for dinner had leftover spiral sliced ham. I added broccoli and cream of mushroom soup instead of celery.  It was very good but a little dry next time I will use an extra can of soup and double the ham.

This was just okay - everyone ate it the first night (I think my son and husband were trying to be polite).  I got stuck with the leftovers for the next week.  Won't make again.

Great recipe!  Put my own spin on it. Made a cream of chicken sauce instead of using cream of celery soup. No peas, added mushrooms with the onions and ham mix.

This is very yummy. I used egg noodles rather than macaroni. I also used 2 cups cubed ham rather than 1. I used a casserole dish with a lid and it came out great. Not dry at all. If you want leftovers I suggest cooking more pasta than original recipe. I omitted the French fried onions.  - Lori

Delicious casserole that good any time of year and appeals to almost anyone's tastebuds.  Wonderful comfort food.  Definitely a keeper.
