This is amazing.  I served it to my dairy-loving friends and they said that they preferred it to regular whipped cream because of its delightful coconut taste (though that probably wouldn't go with everything...)

Recommendation: use coconut cream, not coconut milk.  It comes out much, MUCH better with coconut cream.

thought I should comment after reading some reviews to mention that white sugar is not vegan and honey is a non-vegan ingredient. this recipe turns out perfect and to make it truly vegan just use raw sugar instead of white but make sure to mill the sugar first to make it finer and so it will blend more easily . other than that, it has great flavour and is an awsome substitute

This worked like a charm for me. I have tried this with canned versions of coconut milk and found that the ones with stabilisers (including guar gum) work well. I tried this with homemade coconut milk and it actually worked. You do need to keep everything super cold but I was able to even do it by hand. However, I omitted the sugar and vanilla in each attempt. Also, beware when you put a dollop of this on a warm piece of cake. All that trouble you went through melts away! :-) UPDATE: I have just made another batch of this adding some espresso powder and cocoa and it is delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

I took a single can of coconut milk and put it in the freezer for 1 hour as I was in a rush for a last minut guest. I did chill the beaters and bowl too in the fridge. I followed the remainder of the recipe with the exception of adding whipped cream stabilizer that I had from King Arthur Flour company (I got it off their website- ingredients are powdered gelatin). Mine did not whip in the sense it did not become airy or develop into a larger air induced volume of frosting to fill the bowl as whipped cream would normally do. My daughter has made this and said she has gotten it to whip. I did have a nice spreadable frosting which had a great tecture. I almost think mine was too cold. It did make a nice frosting of about 1/2 a cup. It was stable at room temperature for hours during a party. Everyone loved it. My goal was a gluten and dairy free cupcake for a friend. I am not sure if the gelatin knocks this out of the vegan category. I topped with shaved coconut. I do not find the coconut milk to have a strong coconut flavor at all. It you want you can change out flavorings as the coconut milk seems to be a good carrier product for different extracts.

As I am trying to avoid processed sugar I used 2 tablespoons of raw honey instead.  I also substituted Hershey's Dark Cocoa powder instead of vanilla....AMAZING!!!!  The perfect chocolate whipped topping for cakes, brownies, and berries!!!!

I was impatient so froze the can for 30 minutes and whipped it for about 3 minutes, but it is still AWESOME. It had a thick, creme fraiche consistency (which somehow seemed even fancier for presentation than a really thick whip). It's richer than whipped cream--wonderfully decadent on pumpkin pie. I imagine it would be amazing on strawberry pie...

This recipe is perfect! I made it and used it for a birthday cake for my vegan friend. She loved it! It tastes soooo good! A few warnings though: You can't really pipe with it, you'll need to decorate the cake another way. And definitely DO NOT refrigerate the frosted cake over night! It cracks VERY bad. one picture is of the cracks another where I made more frosting and redecorated.

I have made this a few times now that we have a vegan in the family.  I was sceptical at first, thinking it wouldn't work but it hasn't failed me yet.  I've changed the flavour a bit using a different extract to pair with what I'm putting it on.  I can say I'm not going back to whipping cream, the stuff in the tub or the stuff in the can anytime soon.

Worked beautifully! For those who said that it didn't work for them, make sure none of the liquid gets in. Coconut cream instead of coconut milk, works exceptionally well, as the liquid is already taken out for you. I used it in a Strawberry Shortcake recipe that I found in this site and it was delish!

I used Simply Asia Thai Kitchen Coconut Cream and it turned out great!  I put it in the refrigerator for two to three hours.  I chilled the bowl and beaters I as well.  
1/3 of the can was thick coconut water which I disposed of.  I used the cream - which was super thick as well as a tablespoon of the coconut water to help with the beating process.
I beat the cream for about three minutes and it turned out great.  I added the recommended sugar and vanilla.  I also added some coconut shavings on top of the frosting.

This is such a delicious dairy free recipe! We use it for tossing pies, strawberries, basically anything! It’s really easy to make, though it takes time to prep since everything needs to sit in the fridge or freezer for a time before making. But be careful not to beat too quickly in the beginning or the cream will just break and be an awful texture.

I was nervous about making vegan "whipped cream". I could not find the coconut milk without gum gar in it so I was worried it wouldn't seperate. But sure enough left in the fridge overnight it looked just like the picture. I got two cans because I read on the other review it doesn't make as much. It made less "cream" than 1 heavy cream carton. It was not as fluffy but still had a nice consistency. I beat it a couple of minutes extra to get it smoother. My vegan friend really enjoyed it. She got 2nds, which she rarely does. Next time I'll try the coconut cream if i can find it.

I beat and beat and beat the coconut milk solids and...nothing. No peaks formed ever and I ended up throwing the ugly mess out. The ingredients say coconut milk but the directions say coconut cream - is there a difference? Ugh

This was a great, easy recipe. I only made one can's worth because my boyfriend is lactose intolerant. I whipped it by hand and added maybe a tbsp of sugar and a drop of vanilla. It tasted pretty darn close to the cream version. I may switch to this next time I make a pie!

I made this for someone with serious dairy allergies. He had never had whipped cream before. It was perfect. I give it only 4 stars because texture was off a bit first time I made it. I used powdered sugar the second time and it was perfect.

I made it but it was too sweet for me with just 1 tbsp. of sugar. I added cinnamon for additional flavor and to take out some sweetness. Put in freezer a few minutes after made so it can thicken. Recommend this recipe but use less sugar and a little bit of cinnamon. Also use just a little bit less vanilla

LIARS. It does not matter if it's lite or not, it does not work!! I have put the beaters and bowl in the freezer, put the coconut milk in the refrigerator, yet it still DOES NOT work properly. More like a stress-feast and disaster!! I spilled the whole bowl accidentally on the ground and myself with the first try, and now I am trying and again and yet to none of my surprise, will NOT work. All I wanted was breakfast!! I will still leave a five-star, but that is all I'm giving it!!! (Edit: Alright, so NO, I'm not taking back what I said, but I do have some specific details left out. If you leave the coconut "whipped cream" out for a while or few minutes, it turns thicker, but not into a whipped cream-like substance!!! It's just foam!)

I modified this a bit and added a scoop of Chocolate Protein powder to it so I could have chocolate frosting instead of sugar.  It was exactly what I wanted for a small cheat snack.   I used my KitchenAid stand mixer and let it run for about 4 minutes.

Tried it twice. First time was  a roaring success. Last time was an unmitigated failure. I think I screwed up by not making sure "literally" all of the liquid was drained off of the coconut cream before I started whipping. Also I didn't let the cream chill long enough. Be sure to chill everything plenty and remember, moisture kills whipped cream.

I was going to ice my 'half vegan' cake with my usual cream and cream cheese whip(Allrecipies), but I thought I'd try substituting the Coconut milk solids instead of dairy cream for something new. It worked, but I am not sure it doubled in volume as it does with the cream. Maybe it did (I did a 1/2 recipe). Maybe the coconut was of the wrong kind(had guar), ot the creamed cheese interfered with the process. Also, the cream cheese taste was not so compaptible with coconut milk(!?) It is my experiment anyway, so I am responsible for it, but I am looking forward to doing this again. I've loaded my pantree with organic full fat, no guar gum coconut canned milk & my explorations are to be continued.

Followed instructions exactly but it wouldn’t form peaks. It was runny despite mixing it for more than enough time. Gave up and tried for a creme fraiche consistency and added the vanilla and sugar. It still didn’t taste very good.

It didn't get as stiff as promised. A little disappointed.

If I could give this zero stars I would.  I followed the directions exactly-even had the bowl and mixers in the freezer overnight-total disaster and not edible.  I bake a lot and this is my first flop.

Thai Kitchen coconut milk did NOT work. It does have the guar gum.  My bowl and beater were frozen, I used none of the liquid from the can. It became an unappealing consistency,  and no increase in volume.

Sounds good and thank you for the recipe. The only thing I might add is to substitute maple syrup for the sugar. Vegan's don't eat sugar.

Great recipe!  Made it this weekend for luncheon at our synagogue - needed a vegan recipe. Served it over baked apple slices. Everyone loved it.
