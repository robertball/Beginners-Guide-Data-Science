This is NOT a good recipe for ribs.  I much prefer the "Honey Ribs" recipe that's made in a slow cooker.  These were bland and tough. Sorry!

The first time I made this I made the mistake of using long ribs - a greasy mess. However, the next time, when I followed the recipe exactly it came out great and I had to share it with my boss! She caught me eating leftovers at my desk and they smelled so good I had to give her a copy :-) Hubby and I both love it!

I enjoyed this recipe, very much. My wife is still laughing, over having earlier read a review, from someone who after changing this recipe by substituting short ribs to long, and the wine to beer, (90% of they recipe volume) said they were unhappy by this recipe.

This was fanTAStic. I did the long ribs.  They were perfect!  I used cumin instead of curry, though.  And I used Worchestershire instead of soy sauce. Oh yeah, and I added onion powder. I used all ingredients (minus the ribs) as a "sauce" to marinate the ribs overnight (reserving half of it to use while cooking) then covered tightly with foil. I slow cooked them at 250 degrees for several hours while we were out at a family function. (we were gone from 3pm to 6:30pm) They absolutely FELL off the bone and were sooooo tender! I had researched other recipes but this turned out to be the BEST launching pad recipe. This is going to be added to the hand-me-down family recipe box for all time. I might try to add cayenne pepper next time though.  That might just put this "insane" recipe right over the top and commit us all to the asylum! Everyone at the table kept saying between bites, "mmm-this is really, really good." Honestly, there wasn't any intelligent conversation at the dinner table tonight; only exclamations of delight. And once dinner was over, immediate texting to friends about the great meal.  My stay-at-home-mom, kitchen-cooking-ego is fit to burst!

These came out wonderful!!  I had to do something different because my grill broke and I was planning on BBQ ribs.  I ended up trying this recipe and it turned out great.  I did do a couple of things different.  I put all the sauce in with the ribs in a glass dish and covered it with foil for the first 15 minutes.  Once the sauce had thickened up, I removed the foil, turned the ribs, brushed the sauce all over them and cooked for another 15 minutes without covering.  They came out perfect!  I will make this again!

I started making this and realized that it just wouldn't have enough pizazz for me and my boyfriend's spicy taste. I made it as is with a little less olive oil, about 5-10 shakes of tobasco sauce, 1/2-3/4 cup of Famous Dave's Devil Spit BBQ sauce and a little chili powder. With the few modifications, it was excellent for me!

I tried this recipe for the first time for our weekly Friday night family dinner.  I followed the directions.  The ribs were in the oven for about 20 minutes, I took a glance at them and found the sauce was burning and I had a horrible mess.  I took them out right away.  The meat was flavorless and tough, all of the marinade had burned off.  We all agreed this wasn't a dish we'd try again.

This recipe turned out great. I used boneless beef ribs instead. I like my food with a kick so, I changed the pinch of curry to 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper, and instead of 4 cloves of garlic I used 6. Finally I didn't have the red wine, so I used 3/8 cup of red wine vinegar and 3/8 cup of white wine vinegar. I was a little nervous about changing the wine with the wine vinegar but it turned out so good! Even my 10 year old ate it and came back for seconds. The sauce was so thick, it went great with the white rice I made. 

It would have been five stars but the amount of olive oil was a little too much. It was still delicious but a little greasy. Next time I will use 1/4 cup of oil (which is half of 1/2) instead.

Very good, but it was more of an asian sauce than BBQ.  I loved it my husband prefers BBQ.

The ingredients and proportions  in this recipe are spot on, and would have been worth five stars had the recipe not called for cooking the short ribs at 425 for half an hour (ribs came out dry and overcooked the first time around). The second time around, I heated the oven to 250 degrees, placed the ribs in a roasting pan with a cover, and cooked them low and slow for about five hours. The meat slid right off the bone and was tender enough to cut with a fork. Absolutely delicious.

Edit 10/9/2016: Forgot to stress this enough in my original review; never boil ribs! The best flavors from the meat will end up dissolved in the water and going down the sink.

This recipe was EXCELLENT! I made a few small adjustments because my husband is cajun and doesnt like the taste of curry, and I hate boiling ribs. I substituted a small amount of paprika, chili powder, and a generous pinch of cayenne for the curry, then I marinated the ribs in the sauce for 30 minutes. I baked them at 350 for an hour and a half, completely covers in sauce. My husband and 2 year old daughter were VERY impressed, this has become a new favorite in thr house, and the sauce is thick enough to enjoy over rice!

Quick & easy. Tender & moist. Yummy flavor!

I ran out of olive oil and had to sub. half canola oil, which may be the reason my sauce spread out and burned to the pan rather than thickening up.

Had to make some tweaks...I used mochiko rice flour, white wine, maple syrup, and garlic salt instead of the regular flour, red wine, sugar, and soy sauce. Can you tell that I don't cook often? 
After boiling the meat and drenching it in sauce I ate a piece...tender and delish!  Its in the oven now, and Im sure the result will be great.  Thinking I'll chop up some onions and carrots for a quick side bake.

I fixed this recipe tonight for my husband and me and Wow! was it good. I just tweaked it a little bit. We don't use alcohol, so instead of using wine, I used 100% grape juice. It came out delicious. This is definitely a keeper. Without a doubt I will use this recipe again and again.

Delicious recipe to cook ribs in an hour!! Covered with aluminum foil for the first ten minutes, then added the remaining sauce at the 15 minute mark. Flipped the ribs at the 20 minute mark. Maybe should've boiled them for 25 minutes to make them more tender.

This was great! My husband doesn't like "sweet meat" and this was savory enough for him but sweet enough for me. I saved the sauce from dinner to use as a dip for cocktail weiners and a sauce for hamburgers (allergic to ketchup). 

The only problem/question I have is that the oil? or something in the sauce didn't set up into the sauce but stayed seperate. Next time I might try to decrease the oil since the meat is fatty enough. 

Still really YUMMY!!

The sauce was yummy! I seasoned my ribs with seasoned meat tenderizer, onion powder and beef rub. I cooked my ribs in the crockpot on high for 6 hours. Afterwards, I drained them and rolled each rib in the yummy sauce (excluded the red wine.) I poured the remaining sauce over the ribs and placed them in oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees (long enough) not toooooo tender, and definitely not TOUGH! Thanks so much for sharing such a great idea.

My family loved this recipe!  I have 5 kids and 4 of them asked for a second helping. My husband also said it was really delicious. The recipe is super easy and pretty quick to make. I did cut back on the amount of olive oil I used and added heaping tablespoons of flour to make sure the sauce thickened after reading prior reviews. I probably doubled the amount of garlic and also added onion powder. I served it with sticky white rice and stir fried some broccoli with garlic, olive oil, sesame oil and a tiny bit of soy sauce. I will definetily make this recipe again!

This was EXCELLENT!!! My husband was licking those fingers clean. Half way through the bake, I basted the ribs with a sweet BBQ sauce and put them back in for the remaining 15 mins. Delish!! The only adjustment I would make next time would be to use a little less soy sauce, and add some fresh ground pepper. :)

This recipe is OUTSTANDING! Although the only adjustment I did was totally exempt the oil and double the sauce. I have made this recipe many times and everyone loved the adjustments. Thank you for sharing! This one will always be one of my faves!

Two days after i made these ribs, my husband is still talking about how delicious they turned out!  I stuck to the recipe, let the ribs soak in the sauce for a few minutes to make sure the meat would absorb the flavors.

Liked a lot.  I did however marinade mine overnight in a similar sauce and then convection roasted. I then cut the cooking short about 15-20 mins and put them on the grill. Mmmmmm. They came out great. Juicy, tender and just plain Good.

Oh' WOW! made these ribs for my son's BD (he just turned 30) I made my own fiery hot Barbecue sauce for them. I used the long beef ribs.
FIERY HOT BAR-B-QUE SAUCE: 1 Cup apple cider vinegar, 1/2 Cup Brn.Sugar, 2 TBSP Roger's golden syrup, 4 TBSP Worcestershire sauce, 9 TBSP chili sauce, 8 oz. tomato paste, 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, 1/3 cup honey, 1/4 cup finely chopped onion. MIX IN MED. sauce pan. Cook on low heat, stir occasionally until thickened. Makes about 1 3/4 cups of sauce to baste the ribs.

The sauce was delicious, the three stars are for the sauce.
It needed way more time in the oven to become tender, as ribs should.
Next time, I will bake with a foil seal at a lower heat for longer.  That should solve the problem.
I'm going to try this sauce with chicken.
Note: per calculations with My Fitness Pal, this is a very high calorie recipie best saved for cheat day.

The immpression I have is that this recipe was never used by the original poster, but, modified from some other process "that seemed good at the time".  Anyone rating this higher is clearly trolling the rest of us.

The sauce/glaze was delicious. The cooking method was less than expected. The rbis were not even close to being tender. I will find another cooking method but use the same sauce.

I love this recipe!  I am making it for the fourth time tonight.  I have tried it with regular ribs, country beef ribs, and tonight I am trying it on beef rib strips.  The beef comes out very tender and flavorful.  I made this for a church dinner and it was one of the first items to go!  It is that good.

This recipe resulted in bland & tough as nails ribs. However, the sauce smelled like it could be good if used as a marinade and then heated on the ribs low & slow.

Just made this tonight. Forgot to grab red wine on the way home, so I used some leftover blush instead. Baked it as instructed but over a veggie medley - parsnips, carrots and cauliflower. The gravy was insanely good - everything just worked perfectly together. Even my picky 13 year old cleaned her plate! Definitely a keeper - yummy and easy!

Delicious! I needed a short rib recipe that didn't take 3 hours, yet would still turn out tender. This recipe fit that bill perfectly. I didn't have red wine, so I substituted onion soup mix and 3/4 c. of water, and I think I'll make it that way every time.....because there WILL be other times!

This was excellent. Using a dutch oven, I made a few minor changes; I rubbed the garlic and curry powder into the raw meat instead of mixing it into the sauce and braised the ribs for about 2 minutes in a mix of olive oil and butter (about 1tbsp each).  I then added the sauce and moved the concoction to the oven.  Hubby loved it.

The sauce is to die for. This was my first beef dish of quality and so simple to make. Only suggestion is to keep an eye on the time. I found it to cook much more rapidly.

For taste my hubby gave it 4 stars, but for ease of preparation, I give it 5 stars!  I didn't have curry, so I added ginger and it turned out great!  I love the yummy, sticky sauce!

This was my first time making ribs, and I was so excited when they turned out DELICIOUS.  I thought the sauce was a bit runny at first, but once it cooked in the oven, it thickened up.  I also flipped the ribs 1/2 way through so each side got well marinaded. Definitely recommend!

I think my cookie sheet was to big. My sauce didn't come out as thick and I know I measured right. So the sauce just spread across the baking sheet. Next time I would double the sauce recipe. Definitely needs the flour to thicken the sauce. Good flavor. We thought we could add bbq sauce for the last 10 minutes of baking time or some ketchup to the sauce to thicken.

The flavor of these ribs were amazing!!! 

Next time I believe I will be cooking these ribs along the lines of low and slow... they were a bit more tough than I like. 

Again, I loved the flavor profile though... it was awesome!!!

They were okay but I won't be making them again.  The sauce was good but it nearly burnt  in the pan.  The ribs themselves were tender in the meaty section but not overly tasty.  Section next to the bone did not tenderize.

This was delicious as written. The only thing I did differently was to put all the ingredients, except the flour, in my instant pot. (I didn’t remember to thaw).  I added the flour to the sauce at the end and simmered until thickened. Will be making this again!

Very good quick short ribs, the sauce was tasty the only thing is the next time I'll cover them in the oven and not boil them for so long so they can fall off the bone. The ribs were moist just not fall off the bone this time.

I just made this recipe exactly as described. It was on the oily side and it turned my pan black from the sugar. Next time I would decrease the oil and sugar. The flavor is delicious and the meat is tender.

I was unable to keep the sauce on the beef ribs.  Should I have added more flour to make the sauce stick to the meat?  Or should I have cut and separated the slab of beef ribs before applying the sauce?  The flavor was good.  I just wish more of the sauce stayed on the meat instead of draining off into the baking pan.

I didn’t have ribs..... I made the sauce according to the recipe, but decreased the flour by half, then added 1/4 tsp crushed red peppers. Once the sauce was combined I plopped in a frozen Tri-Tip roast, baked in a cast iron Dutch oven at 425° for 30 minutes, then reduced heat to 250° for around 6 hours. The sauce was plentiful and the flavor? I’m making it for my Mother’s Day dinner. It’s just that good. Oh my! Served over rice with a green salad alongside. Thank you for a great and easy recipe!! I might have to get some ribs.... ;)

I had only 1/2 Kg of moose ribs on hand so I halved the recipe. Holding the flour, I tossed all in a Sous vide bag at 68C for 2 hrs and did some homework. Finished as recommended on tin foil in the oven, flipping and dipping the ribs in the sauce again at the turn. Pretty tasty for quickly, toss'em in and go-on-about-your-business ribs. I'll do this again with a whole bag o'ribs! Nice job, MELISSACK!

My husband doesn't like tomatoey  BBQ sauces.  This receipe is just right.  I tweeked it a little bit by simmering the ribs in the sauce in the pan before putting them in the oven.  I thicken the remaining sauce by reducing it, then adding  Wondra.  I spread the thickened sauce  on the ribs a few minutes prior to being done. Yum!

These were delicious! If you are looking for an excellent ribs  recipe  that won't take 4 hours, this is it! Done in less than an hour. 
I baked it in all the sauce, covered, flipping the meat after 15 minutes.

The sauce/marinade tasted very very good and caramelized well over the ribs.  I added salt and pepper to it and drenched them about every 5 minutes in the oven (at 400 degrees instead of 425) to get a good glaze.  The beef however was not very tender after being boiled, and I may marinade or slow cook next time to try and get it more tender.  All around good recipe however.

This recipe was OK, but there was not much flavor and the ribs were a bit on the dry side and uninspiring. I will not make this recipe again,  so the search resumes for a juicier and more tangy beef barbecue.

This flavor was absolutely delicious. Just wish the beef ribs had more meat on them. Cooked them in the oven for about 90 minutes to make more tender. Will try this again on pork ribs, it's that good!

Amazing ribs..
Probably the best tasting i've ever made.  I cook and bake a lot so thats going some. I basted several times throughout oven baking to thoroughly coat the very tender meat.
Got hubby's 100% taste testing approval..
thx for sharing..

I usually make ribs in the crockpot but needed something quicker tonight. This recipe is awesome. My husband says they're the best ribs he has ever tasted. The ribs were really moist and nicely seasoned and didn't fall off the bone. I expected the sauce to be a little thicker, but it worked just fine. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Sauce was delicious. I did cut the oil in half and there was plenty. Next time I will try in a crock pot.

The flavor of the sauce was great. I will make it again but will have lengthen the cooking time because the ribs were still tough.

INSANE RIBS
I accidentally misread the recipe and used red wine VINEGAR instead of red wine and it was delish!  Actually made the marinade zesty and tart.  I will use this again and may even try it with chicken, shrimp, pork.

Awesome recipe! I did drop the heat down to 350 to keep the sauce from burning. When I make this again, I plan on making up some extra sauce

Really good and fast! Didn't have red wine so I did 2/3 sherry wine and 1/3 red wine vinegar.

Substituted wheat beer for read wine. Also added a few dashes of ginger, a squirt of Sriracha and about 1/4 cup ketchup. First thing is this seems way too thin. 

Next time I would heat it on the stove top and then add a tablespoon of corn starch mixed with a little cold water, and then let that bubble for about five minutes. Then set aside to cool down. This should thicken it a bit.

Insane Oven Beef Ribs Haiku: "These ribs were okay. But the flavor was lacking. All the sauce slid off." Enlisted my hubbs to make dinner and he chose this recipe, and he followed it to a T. They smelled great, looked tasty, but all the flavor that went into the sauce didn't really cling or linger as much as we would've liked.

This was a good recipe but nothing really fabulous.  I won't bother making again.  They were just too basic.
