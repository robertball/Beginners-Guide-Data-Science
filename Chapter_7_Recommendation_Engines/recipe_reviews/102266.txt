Easy, delicious and elegant. Made it for company and it disappeared. A definite keeper.
Update 4/13/06 - This pie was the hit of our Passover dinner. It's a good thing that I made 2. The other desserts were basically untouched. I got so many compliments from my guests and I didn't tell them how easy it was to make. :)

Made this for passover and everyone LOVED it. Used a coconut crust and followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. Garnished with rasperries and whipped cream. highly reccomend this recipe it doesnt taste like passover at all.

Fabulous crust!  The truffle part was a bit too heavy for me. I'll try making it with cream next time.

Fantastic Passover dessert! Many desserts for Passover are extremely dry and unappetizing - this was a great surprise for my guests.

The crust is a "5", the filling is a "4" - almost too rich (and I never thought I'd meet a rich dessert I didn't like!)  A tiny slice is all you need.

This was very rich and delicious.  The crust gets rather hard after being in the fridge overnight, so I let mine sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes before I could slice it.  I also did not have any brandy, so I used a tablespoon of water for the topping instead which was just fine.  Serve slices with Cool Whip-YUM!

Super yummy!!!  Easy to make but lots bowls and pots to clean up.  Everyone raved about the taste.  Very rich a little goes a long way.

This pie is very very rich.  I love chocolate, but it was a little too much for me. There was also a lot of clean up at the end.

This pie is out of control!
I'm hiding it in the back of my fridge ;]
Absolutely delicious.  Substituted almonds for the pecans and almond extract for the vanilla extract.  Came out great!

Amazing! Made for the seder. Everyone loved it-  it was a little too rich but still amazing.  Made the crust the night before and left out at room temp.  Didn't have brandy so substituted amaretto.

The filling to this pie was very rich and delicious - but I didn't care for the crust.  It became very hard and therefore difficult to cut.  But I'll make it again.  I may just use a shortbread crust instead.
