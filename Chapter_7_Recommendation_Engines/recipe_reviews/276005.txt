Everything about this was excellent. The pork and salsa complimented each other perfectly. One helpful tip I will share is to place the cubed pork in a bowl, drizzle with oil and massage. Then add the seasoning and massage again. It is much easier to skewer it this way and the jerk/coconut  seasoning sticks nicely and doesn't make nearly as much as a mess.
