I have been using a recipe very similar to this one for years and it gets rave reviews every time.  

One IMPORTANT detail that gets over looked is to save the pineapple juice and cut your bananas into the juice and allow them to sit in there for a few min.  This will keep the bananas from turning brown and keep it fresher looking longer.  also it is important to squeeze the pineapple to get ALL the juice out not just let the juice drain out using gravity.

Plus you can then drink the pineapple banana combo for good health.

Another good tip is to freeze the "crust" part before putting on your cream cheese layer, this will make it easier to spread as it keeps the crust in place.

another spin on the cake is to use gramcrackers as opposed to vanilla wafers.  but both are equally good, its all preference.

I made this for my banana lovin' niece who turned 7 on friday.  Because the kids all swarmed around the cake, and then devoured it, I didn't get to try it, but they said it was "really, really good".  Before I added the whipped topping, I drizzled a 7.25 oz. bottle of "Twix Magic Shell" (made by Smuckers) over the bananas, put it in the frige to harden and then added the whipped topping.  Oh and I also soaked the sliced bananas in the pineapple juice to prevent browning.  Thank you so much Judy, my nieces & nephews once again think that I'm the bomb!!

My co-worker found this recipe and brought it to work. Makes ALOT, served 10 pple for two days of dessert. I will be savoring the last serving of this weeks' run tomorrow. TRY THIS RECIPE!!! Oh, let me just say to put pineapple in strainer. First time I didn't drain sufficiently and it made dessert a bit too liquidy.

This is a delish and easy recipe.  I used Graham cracker crumbs and 3 T sugar instead of the vanilla wafer crackers.  My husband took one bite and said "OH MY GOSH!"

This is FABULOUS!!!  You can use crushed graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers & drizzle chocolate syrup over the cherries for added flavor. I do Weight Watchers, so I used fat free everything & it was still MMMM..sooo good!

This recipe is so yummy!  I made it for a friend's birthday, and now I've been asked to make it for other people's birthdays!!!  The only thing I'd adjust would be to double the confectioner's sugar/cream cheese mixture.  This has such a refreshing taste that it's just perfect for warm weather.  Heck, any weather!

Just made this today and it was really good and a hit at our picnic.  I cheated by purchasing 2 pre-made vanilla wafer shells.  I skipped the walnuts and drizzled with magic shell instead.  I really wish that I had either mini chocolate chips for this and/or chocolate sprinkles.

This is excellent and easy!  I crushed and mixed the walnuts with the crust, instead of on top.  I also used 3 large bananas instead of the 6 listed on the recipe.  I will be making this one time and time again!

Delicious! I added an extra package of cream cheese and since cool whip is made with hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup, I made my own whip cream using whipping cream and a little sugar and vanilla. Look for the recipe on this site.  It makes all the difference in the world. I also added sliced fresh strawberries. My family loves this! Too easy!

This dessert makes a lot & therefore would be great for a bigger crowd. The cream cheese makes the dessert very rich, so a small portion is all that's needed. The cream cheese mixture was the only thing that gave me a bit of a probem. It was very thick/sticky & hard to spread over the crust. Although adding another cream cheese would solve the problem of not enough, I think that adding some type of liquid to the mix would help it spread easier.

My mom has been making this amazing cake for years, and I absolutely LOVE this dessert! Instead of using crushed vanilla wafers, though, she always used graham cracker crumbs. *yummy* But the vanilla wafers sound interesting, so I'll probably try that soon! When you make this cake, it's best to let the fruits lay out on a paper towl while you prepare the rest; that way, the juices don't ruin the appearance of it. Enjoy this delicious cake!!! :)

This is a great dessert recipe for conquering the banana split urge in ya! We have made this many times, a great potluck dish. The pan always comes back clean. And like with our regular banana splits we also add strawberries sliced, along with the bananas. We like to take hot fudge and carmel sauce and drizzle on top for a nice presentation. It's YUMMY!

I made this recipe for a family get together and everyone loved it. The only thing I didn't like about it was despite draining the pineapple for at least 20 minutes, the desert ended up watery and runny after it was cut and set out on the counter for 30 minutes. Otherwise, was a huge success and my niece and sister-in-law requested a copy of the recipe. Thanks Allrecipes.com!! Another winner!

WOW! Sooo yummy! We used 2 9-inches disposable pie plates instead of one cake pan and froze the second cake. I hope it unfreezes okay! I will definitely make again, maybe top with peanuts next time!

This was VERY tasty.  I sliced my bananas and shook them up in a covered bowl with lemon juice before putting them on.  Also, my Cool Whip was still frozen, so I generously sprinkled grahm cracker crumbs over the top and drizzled with Hershey's syrup and Smucker's Butterscotch syrup. It really tasted like a banana split!  Thanks for sharing.  It's very versatile to be able to add different things to your prefrences.

I took this to a cookout and people were fighting over who got to take home the leftovers!  I didn't have confectioner's sugar but found that it wasn't necessary.  Also, I was in a hurry and didn't use the butter in the crust.  Several people compared it to the Dessert Rosa at Carrabba's.  As far as ingredients were concerned I didn't skimp...extra creamy Coolwhip, Jello pudding and full-fat cream cheese.  I am going to make reduced-fat/light batch...I will let you know how it turns out!

I have made a variation of this for over a decade and its a family fav now for every holiday.  

Instead of the vanilla wafers, I buy graham cracker pie crusts (2) for convenience sake. The cream cheese mixture is plenty for 2 pies, even the larger portion pie shells.  I add a little more pineapple and garnish with maraschino cherries, walnut pieces and mini choc chips. 

Love the magic shell and also choc syrup drizzle ideas, but I've not tried either yet.

I changed some things, mostly amounts, but this is a very forgiving type of recipe. I personally didn't like pineapple in it, but I don't like it on my banana splits either, so I don't hold that against anyone. I might use sugared strawberries and make this again, because there's something so GREAT about bananas and chocolate and cream together that this is worth another shot. Thanks for the recipe, this was a great way to use up 6 bananas (that wasn't yet another banana bread!)

YUM!  In place of the cool whip, I made this with 1 pint of fresh whipped cream sweetened with sugar and flavored with vanilla extract--was the perfect amount.  I drained the pineapple and it was still a bit liquidy when I ate some the next day--be sure to drain well.  For those who said they dipped the bananas in the pineapple juice to prevent browning, there's really no need, as they bananas sit right on top of the pineapple anyway.  Save yourself the time!  Also, one pkg of cream cheese is plenty--it's just meant to be a fairly thin, sweet layer on the crust and hold the pineapple in place.  If you do use 2 pkgs, I'd increase the sugar.  Great recipe!

I made this dessert for a work potluck that I was required to attend and everyone loved it. I used a premade nilla wafer crust, 2 pkg cream cheese (as one review suggested), sliced pineapple that I cut up into chunks (I do not like crushed pineapples), magic shell chocolate topping (placed on top of the pineapples before the whipped cream), and I sprinkled the top with sliced almonds and chopped pecans. I mixed the banana slices with the cream cheese instead of layering them on top. The filling was creamy and thick and everything tasted really good. This dessert was very easy to prepare (I made mine two days ahead of time and put in the freezer) just be careful if using a premade crust they are very fragile.

This is my first review and I'm sorry to say I can't give it 5 stars. It was good, but didn't quite deliver what other reviews promised. Sorry. I guess our not all our taste is in our mouth. I make the recipe exactly as stated. I found it rather difficult to cut and serve. The crust stuck to the glass baking dish and I had to scrape. I have to add that neither am I crazy for sweets nor am I a good baker.

This is a delicious and easy summer recipe. I used reduced-fat Nilla wafers, fat-free cream cheese, Light Margarine, and fat-free cool whip and it still tasted great!  Everyone at our family picnic was complimenting me and having a second helping, even my father-in-law who  despises anything low-fat!   Next time I'll use light cool whip vs. fat-free as the fat-free is slightly watery. Terrific and fun recipe~Thanks:)

Addition of one bottle of Twix Magic Shell over the bananas was positively genius.  I also used sliced strawberries instead of cherries, and omitted the nuts.  It's good, but it's not something you can do often.  (Second time I made it with the reduced fat options - and it didn't make a difference in taste)

This recipe was a hit by all. I did jazz it up a bit since it is called a banana split cake...had to add 1/2 can of cherries on top of the pineapple and chocolate syrup all over the bananas before adding the whipped topping. I substituted chopped pecans for the walnuts. I used more cherries than listed and cut the cherries in half and placed them over the top of the topping so that you got a cherry in every bite. Yummy for your tummy....cool and fun to eat too.

Crowdpleaser! I used reduced fat Nilla wafers (11 oz pkg, instead of 16 oz, only because I didn't notice it until a got home)reduced fat cream chase, and reduced fat Cool Whip.  The cream cheese, confectioners' sugar quantities seemed a little thin when spread,so I think I will try 12 oz next time.  The addition of the instant banana cream pudding sounds like a possibility also, although the crowd (11 adults, devoured it prepared just as it was!)  Only leftovers wil 2 pieces, which the host & hosted gladly kept for later in the evening.  (after already having had 2 pieces each.)
In case you can't tell, this is definitely a keeper.  Hope I have the opportunity to take it to more hot weather functions!

A little labor intensive but worth the work. I added mini-semi sweet chips, used magic shell to decorate and substituted pecans for walnuts. Wish I could buy pre-crushed nilla wafers but may take out the cuisinart next time to pulverize them.

I was a little disappointed in this.  The only substition I made was to use store bough shortbread crusts.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a tee.  I brought both cakes/pies to a 4th of July cookout and it wasn't one of the more popular desserts.  Oh well, not everyone can be a winner!

Delicious!  It was the biggest hit dessert at my family reunion this weekend.  Instead of the walnuts, I used the nut topping in a can usually found in the ice cream novelty aisle.  I love banana splits, but never wanted to try the recipes with the raw egg.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Wonderful dessert! I took this to a family reunion today and everyone LOVED it! I used 2 8oz. containers of cream cheese with 2 cups of confectioners sugar and it was just right!  I put strawberries and chocolate sauce on top - make sure to put the chocolate on right before you serve if it is for a picnic - the chocolate melted and looked funny - but still tasted great!

This recipe was so delicious!!  It was very light and fruity, everyone loved it!!  At our families fourth of july reunion, I accidentally dropped it in the grass - face down of course - scooped it up, brought it in, put it on the counter and left.  When I came back to get some food it was the almost gone!  Everyone knew it had been in the grass, but was still raving about how good it was!  Now that's a keeper!!  Thank you!

Only thing I added was some Smuckers strawberry sundae topping with the pineapple. I also followed others suggestions about the bananas in the pineapple juice to keep from browning. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it disappeared!

Awesome summer dessert! Perfect for a healthier choice by replacing the confectioner sugar with Swerve!

I even put together a topping tray. Great for 4th of July parties!

This was amazing...I’m pretty sure it’s the only thing my husband has eaten in the last few days. I think next time I would just add more cream cheese and whip my own cream.

I absolutely love this cake.  My only change is I use graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers.  I have had complete strangers call me for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was the biggest hit at a barbecue I attended.  Everyone raved, and it was gone within  20 minutes....yes, the whole thing!  There were plenty of recipe requests, and I plan to  make it again for my family at Thanksgiving dinner. Easy to make and heaven in your mouth!

My father used to make this years ago and he made it again about 2 years ago. I've not been able to get him to make it so when my 18 yo requested it, I had to make it for him. My oldest son is allergic to nuts so I topped it with vanilla wafer crumbs,

I used basic recipe but used sliced strawberries and I grated a large Hershey Bar into thin curls on top the strawberries, then whipped cream then topped with more strawberries and lightly scrape Hershey Bar to get a light chocolate powder on the whipped cream

This is soooo good! I was supposed to take a dessert to a church picnic, but it looked so yummy, I kept it for the family dinner and made another cake for the picnic. The family loved it and I promise to repent someday.

Have made it twice this week!  I used pecan shortbread cookies finally crumbed.  FanTAStic!  First one I refrigerated  1/2 and froE the other half.  Thawed slightly before serving.  Better than refrigerated one and bananas didn't turn brown.  Drizzled chocolate syrup, pecan pieces and maraschino cherries on each piece before serving

I made this dessert for my family reunion, I really did not get much feed back. I had about half left. It was very easy to make. I used 2 creamcheese pkg, but the same amount of sugar. I also put chocolate syrup ontop of the bananas. I am not a huge banana fan. I made fresh whipped cream. I dont think I will make it again.

This has become my favorite summer dessert.  It's perfect for a cookout or a birthday party.  I serve it in a large glass bowl, like a pudding, and watch as it disappears.  Everytime.

hhmmm...I hate to go against everyone else here but we all (4 adults, 2 kids) thought this was very ho-hum. Did graham cracker crust, added choc syrup on top, even added strawberries. Just nothing exciting.  Won't try again. Sorry.

I tried this recipe and it was so yummy! I decreased the amount of sugar a bit but other than that it was right on target. The only set back was the time, my family joked that it should be ready by the next night's dinner.
