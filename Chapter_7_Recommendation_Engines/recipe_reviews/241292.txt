Second time making it, sliced chicken lengthwise for more even cooking. Added some chopped onions and peppers. Again, delicious! Great recipe to start with and a fun one to play with. This Mom is grateful for a simple, quick yet flavorful meal!

It was awesome! I was expecting it would taste good when I read the recipe, but the actual flavor exceeded expectations. While it takes close to an hour to make, it is an easy meal to put together. Highly recommended!
