Sauteed Cauliflower Delight Haiku: "This WAS delightful! Wasn't expecting that much, but we loved this dish!" Easy, unique, interesting and tasty side dish. I followed the recipe exactly but left the pan on medium uncovered, rather than bumping to high, for longer than the extra 1-2 min., to ensure nice brown spots and nothing dried out, but to also allow me to finish preparing the rest of dinner. Something about the plumpy raisins and squishy tomato bites really worked w/ this, and a squirt of fresh lemon juice put this over the top. Yum delight indeed.

This is a regular around my house! I use dried cherries instead of raisins and it is delicious!

This was super!  I used sweet onion instead of red (that's what I had on hand), and halved the recipe as it was just too much for two of us.  I will definitely make this again.

I really liked the contrast of the sweet raisins to the sour lemon juice. I know it says the lemon juice is optional, but I wouldn't leave it out. 

I also used more tomatoes than what was called for (1 dry pint) and left them whole.

I chopped up one fresh cayenne pepper instead of the pepper flakes. I think I would use two next time.

Edit: I had some habaneros sitting around the kitchen, so I minced one of them. It was just enough heat for my taste (love the spicy!)

If you're looking for a different way to spice up your cauliflower, this is it. It's a great balance between sweet and spicy, not to mention it doesn't take long to prepare and cook if you're short on time. I'll definitely make it again!

I was really skeptical when I was preparing this dish, but we LOVED it.  Unique combination of raisins and onions in this recipe.  Great to have a new way to prepare cauliflower!

I never use raisons (I don't eat them) but I've made this twice and it gets better every time!
