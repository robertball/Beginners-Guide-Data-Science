Is a good recipe, but with a few things added will make you slap your mother. I used ground sausage w/ sage, add 1/2 med onion diced,1/2 med red pepper diced, while cooking sausage. Before putting meat mixture and egg on tortillas add sliced jalapeno, fresh cut cilantro and salsa. Turned out wonderfully. My wife is Colombian and she was impressed.

These were really good, very flavorful. My husband works very early in the morning, so I made a big batch and froze them separately so that he could grab them and on the go in the morning. I used salsa instead of taco sauce, whole wheat tortillas and added cheddar cheese. I will make these again for sure.

I am from New Mexico and am a bit of a snob when it comes to Hispanic foods and I thought this recipie was great. I used a homead red chili sauce rather than a taco sauce (takes a bit more time though).

Delicious, and perfect for freezing! I made a batch of 12 smaller burritos and froze them for breakfast throughout the week. I used Pace Blackbean and Roasted Corn Salsa instead of Taco Sauce along with cheese, and it added a bit extra to the burritos! They were even better after being reheated!

I too make my own chorizo and really enjoy it with scrambled eggs and tortillas.  I add the eggs to the just finished sausage then spoon that onto the tortilla

Wonderful!! I added green pepper and onions and fresh cilantro. You definately need to let it marinate overnight or longer. I made a mistake and fried the sausage and then added the rest of the ingredients and it was fine. Next time I will doa as it says. It does need lots of sour cream and salsa.

It was different than normal but very good!  I made the following changes:  1 lb hot sausage for the meat.  Added 1/2 of an onion, diced.  Cheese on top of the eggs.  I found that I had too much filling for 6 8" shells so make sure you have a couple extra.  I also didn't microwave my tortillas first and couldn't close the ends since they were overstuffed.  Update:                                            Made them again and this time used sausage with sage and srirachi sauce and salsa on the burritos.  I didn't use any taco sauce but thought they were much better this time.

Really good. I swapped out all ingredients for low cal/ fat ones including using precooked turkey sausage that I chopped up into small pieces, then combined with the rest of the ingredients.  I thought the vinegar sounded strange, but it really does add something yummy. I made mine a little smaller than called for and I got about 12 burritos. Next time I'm going to play around with the recipe and add some onion and chopped bell peppers to bulk it up more w/out adding fat or calories.

This reminds me of homemade chorizo sooo much better than the store bought with all the terrible stuff put in it. This was soooo good!

Excellent!  An great alternative to the standard restaurant breakfast burrito and so easy to make.  Made these for a hungry football crowd and they were a big hit.

We added peppers and cheese to this otherwise it would have been bland. Needed more heat but a nice start. With peppers we would give it it a 4 star but without the peppers this only ranked as a 3.

Superb!!!!  I love these breakfast burritos.  I could eat them all day long.  I like to make them up and freeze some for later.

If I could give these a 4.5 I would. They were really good. Not as spicy as I would have liked so next time I will use the Hot Mexican Chili Powder.  Had some leftover so I froze them and they heated up beautifully. I used the whole wheat tortillas which were good, but I still miss the fresh tortillas we had in New Mexico. That's probably the difference between 4 and 5 stars. Will definitely make these again soon!

Good, but way too salty. Half the salt is better.

Yummmmmyyy!! I did change a FEW small things. I used turkey sausage cuz it was all I had, and added rotel to the meat after I drained it. I would add a few more eggs next time- probably just 2 more would be fine. I LOVE the spice mixture with the turkey- the last time I made turkey sausage it was really bland, this mix gives it a good flavor I will DEFINATELY re-use. I'm a big baby about spicy stuff too, and this, plus the rotel, wasnt too bad. I served it with a little salsa on the side and my boyfriend STLL aded hotsauce, but he's a spice-junkie :)

Nice change to typical taco seasoning meat.  I use it with a cilantro lime rice in dinner burritos.  Thanks for sharing!
