This recipe is amazing! The only 2 things I did differently were, I added some fresh minced ginger (approximately 1 1/2 tsp. But I would add more next time) and I had a bag of precut broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, which I microwaved and threw in there at the end. I didn't have any red pepper flakes in my cupboard, but found some packets of red pepper flakes that we got from a pizza joint and poured those in there! Gotta improvise sometimes! Also, after we had eaten our dinner, my husband said that next time I should add some peanuts!Thanks for this delicous low carb recipe!

This was great!! I used the shredded coleslaw cabbage in the salad section to save some time. I did add some freshly ground black pepper, some sliced carrots, sliced celery, and sliced water chestnuts, and served with Lumpia (Filipino Egg Rolls). Thanks for the great recipe, Jim! (Update 11/25/06)- I made this tonight, and added some minced ginger (along with the other ingredients I added) for a change of pace. It was WONDERFUL...I also served it with steamed rice. This is one of my favorite recipes on allrecipes.com...thanks again!

Our level of heat tolerance in this house lies somewhere between “coward” and “wimp.”  So I’ll start by saying that our Spicy Garlic and Pepper Shrimp wasn’t nearly as spicy or peppery as the submitter intended as I cut waaay back on the red pepper flakes (ok, I hardly used any at all).  I have made this in the past using packaged coleslaw mix but this time I used some napa cabbage I had on hand.  Hard to say which I liked better!  The coleslaw mix obviously has a stronger flavor, but I did like the tenderness and lightness of the napa cabbage.  I used red onion for a spark of color and even threw in a little radicchio which also contributed interest and color. I love this stuff – it’s a nutritious, fantastic meal you can put on the table in minutes – so make sure you start your rice in advance!  Four stars rather than five only because I think the amount of crushed red pepper flakes is excessive, not just for the heat factor but because it may detract from, rather than enhance, the flavors of the shrimp and cabbage.

Awesome, My husband and I love this.  I chop up the shrimp into small pieces and use the cabbage as wraps instead of using it in the dish.  I just put the mixture in a bowl and scoop on to the cabbage leaves like you would making tacos. mmmmmmm...good

LOVED this one! It was spicy and delicious!!! I altered the serving amount to 4 rather than just 1, as the recipe states. Served it over the stir fried cabbage and it was outstanding! I used sesame oil to saute the cabbage, and I added a bunch of chopped green onions in with the shrimp. YUM!!! This one's a definite keeper!

We enjoyed this recipe, but be warned that it is very hot.  I scaled the portion size to four, which would have been 2.5 tablespoons of red pepper flakes.  I thought that sounded like too much so I cooked it with only 1 tablespoon.  That was more than enough!  Next time I make this, because it was good other than being a little too hot, I will use 1/2 tablespoon of red pepper flakes for 4 servings.  Other modifications:  I cut way back on the vegetable oil, used an entire head of cabbage and 1lb shrimp for 4 servings, left out the cilantro (didn't have any on hand), and garnished it with green onion and toasted sesame seeds.  Peanuts would make a great garnish too.

Delicious!  I have been doing the low carb thing so this was the perfect thing.  I used sirloin, sliced thin.  And I added some red bell pepper strips and some italian hot pepper strips.  I wasn't sure how stir fried cabbage would be but it was really good.  Also, I decreased the oil to 1 1/2 tablespoons, and I used half sesame oil half vegetable oil.  Yum

This is very good! I doubled everything in the recipe except for the oil. Be warned,  it is VERY SPICY! We love spicy, but it was a little over the top. It was so good though! My husband drank tons of water in between bites and finished the entire plate, and wanted more! I'm making this again tonight, but this time, I'm using a pound of shrimp (16 was not enough for the both of us), an entire bag of cabbage shreds, a couple dashes of red pepper, and 4x the garlic, onion, cilantro, and soy sauce. I served it with white rice and it was delicious. Thank you for the great recipe!

RARELY do I give not only 5 stars to a recipe but to add a recipe to my "family's" recipe book at home; yeah this one did it. Delicicious! I doubled everything of course; I threw everything together and sauteed it and it was THAT simple. Served over rice and wallah! Dinner's served! Thanks for posting. (EDIT-so I asked my hubby about this dish and he was SO MAD AT ME NOW for not making more, because he wants a ton it of it now, ALL DAY EVERY DAY as he says; really? Yeah same palate and thought process) EDIT: I made this last night and making it again tonight!!

My husband really liked this but I found it so hot that it was practically inedible. I chose it mostly for it's low calorie count and the fact that it had cilantro, which I love. I think the red pepper flakes overpower the other  flavors in this recipe. I liked it but was hoping for more cilantro flavor.

Made this for dinner tonight.  This really hit the spot!  I love spicy food.  I love good food!  Wish I had made a double batch!  Might make it again tomorrow.  I love the the other ideas.  String beans instead of cabbage.  Lettuce Wraps.  Bok Choy.  Pork instead of shrimp.....  Yum!  The possibilities are endless!!!!

This was very delicious and my husband and I enjoyed it a lot.   I doubled the recipe for two, and halved the oil, and was glad that I did, as it was plenty.  I also added straw mushrooms and snow peas....which I was also glad about.  I would definitely recommend adding a few veggies to this dish, as the shrimp and cabbage just didn't seem to be quite enough.  I also took other’s recommendations and only used as much red pepper as you would use in preparing this for one person.  I also doubled the cabbage bed, as it didn’t seem like quite enough.  We had a nice zinfandel wine with it, and it complemented the spiciness of the dish nicely. I will definitely be making this again, very yummy and also quick and easy to prepare!

Nice and spicy.  I feel like it needs something more.  Possibly minced ginger, thinly sliced celery, and maybe even some crushed peanuts.  As is still pretty good.

We had this tonight and it was amazing. I only used 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper flakes instead of 2 teaspoons, but it was still too much for us. I'll omit it altogether next time. Still a keeper. Goes onto our rotating meal schedule. thanks!  :o) Donna

Scaled up to 4 servings, so I used a 1 lb bag of shrimp, a whole onion and a small head of cabbage. Added ginger and carrots, left out the cilantro. This was quick, easy, and healthy. Thanks!

I liked it a lot, my boyfriend did not, but then again he's not a big fan of cabbage.  I thought the recommended amount of red pepper flakes would have been ridiculous.  I eat hot food all the time and 1tsp of flakes was more than enough.  I also added some other veggies like celery and bell peppers which I thought turned out really well.  I also only used 1 tbsp oil in the entire dish which I doubled for 2 people.  Very healthy, simple, and flavorful!  I may serve over brown rice next time for the BF.

Excellent base recipe and instructions. I added imitation crab meat to this along with the shrimp and it was delicious. Only thing, I cooked the onions with the garlic first and let that caramelize. Then i added the shrimp, crab, pepper, soy sauce, water, hint of fish sauce, and some big pieces of ginger and red pepper flakes. I let this all boil over high heat for a few minutes. At the end, added a little bit of sugar and flour to finish it off the sauce  with some cilantro and poured it over the cabbage. Delicious!

Phenomenal!!! Tasted great. It only calls for 1 serving so I used a pound of small shrimp and just kinda went from there adding more. Felt better having it over a veggie instead of rice or pasta. I definitely recommend trying this!

Absolutely delicious! We cut back a little bit on the red pepper and it was perfectly spicy. We would let the cabbage cook just a tad longer next time. Would definitely recommend :-)

This is a GREAT recipe!!  I first made it for a group of friends... they now ask for it again and again.  I have used chicken, small scallops and even served it over rice instead of cabbage.  To add a little flavor, I add a little oriental spice mixture (Emiril's Asian Seasoning) to give it a little depth.  THIS IS GREAT!!

I really liked this recipe but.... I love hot spicy food, and I cut the red pepper flakes in half and it was really hot (I was ok with it, one guest was scraping the flakes off). I would not use the amount called for next time. The other thing is that I halved the water and it was pretty soupy. If you are serving this with rice, it might be okay but since I was making a low carb dish, we did not have rice- not a big deal since we just used a slotted spoon. Overall, this was a great recipe.

I altered the recipe for four servings. I substituted the veggie oil with olive oil and reduced the amount to four tablespoons. I added two tablespoons of fresh minced ginger which I added with the garlic during cooking. As suggested by another, I added some frozen mixed veggies-broc, caul, carrots, snow peas. I steamed them in their bag in the microwave and added them at the end. I also reduced the red peppers to one teaspoon. My hubby added more peppers to his plate as desired. Also served with a side of long grained brown rice. A meal we will have again.

This was so simple to make and sooo delicious! I made mine with calamari and will try with shrimp, scallops, and tofu in the future. Took less than 15 mins and dinner was ready.

Good  Recipe, quick, easy and relatively inexpensive to make. I would recommend making this with rice as it would soak up the broth (?) a little better.
Overall a great meal.

This was okay - a very tame stir fry. I used fresh green beans & baby bok choy instead of cabbage. Also added fresh basil and thai chili instead of red pepper flakes. Maybe some fish sauce and fresh grated ginger next time...that would be yum!

Bland and watery...
Adding soy sauce, garlic, and cilantro to a dish does not make it an Asian dish.

I LOVED this!  I can't wait to make it again.  The spiciness of the shrimp and the slight sweetness of the cabbage went great together.  It was also super easy and super fast -- dinner was on the table in about 10 minutes including the time to chop the cabbage (my shrimp was pre-shelled and deveined).  I served it with a side salad and white wine.  I would note though that this recipe is not for the faint of heart -- my husband doesn't like a lot of spice so he thought it was too hot.  Next time I'll use less red pepper in his serving. :)

Recipe is very quick and easy to cook but I found it a bit bland.  I also added the onions along with the garlic and shrimp because I don't think cooking them for 10 seconds at the end would add much flavor.  I agree with the other reviewers who said it might be helped by adding other ingredients.

Definately a "HOT" recipe!  I didn't have any cabbage, so I used spinach instead and it was awesome.  I have to say though, the best part is the super fast prep time!

I was hesitant to try this but encouraged by all the good reviews. I tweaked the recipe a little but was very pleasantly surprised how great it was! I used 1/2 white cabbage and 1/2 red, as well as green onion instead of regular. Also, I hate cilantro so I used parsley.(fresh) I also increased the shrimp (just our personal taste) I layered the dish on a bed of rice. Believe it or not the amount of red pepper flakes is perfect! Spicy. . .but Great! Thanks Jim!

This dish lacked flavor tremendously.  I tried preparing dish to specs and was very disappointed.  I prepared the dish with some modifications.  I shredded the cabbage, add yellow onion; cut julienne style.  Heat wok, add peanut oil.  When hot add shredded cabbage, onion, Chinese Five Flavor, and Mushroom Flavored Dark Soy Sauce by: Lee Kum Kee.  Placed on plate.  Heated the remaining peanut oil, place garlic, shrimps, onion, added  Chinese Five Season, Oyster Sauce (to taste) , and 1 ½ tbsp. dumpling sauce, and crush red pepper. (to taste) Stir until all ingredients are saturated with sauce.  (Don’t overcook shrimps) Serve over cabbage.  Great Meal!! Plenty of Flavor.

The flavor on this was good, but I found it to be way too oily. If I make it again I'll cut the oil significantly.

Delicious! I shredded 1/2 whole cabbage and stir fried about 3-4 minutes. Forgot to buy the cilantro, but didn't miss - instead added 1 cup thick sliced mushrooms at same time as onion. I did have to cook considerably longer than 10 seconds to soften the onions/mushrooms at the end.  My husband (who doesn't do spicy OR cabbage) really liked.  Adding it to our favorites!

Fantastic!  I cooked it as the recipe stated.  Wonderful!!  Wouldn't change a thing.  Be careful when cooking the cabbage, as it overcooks very easily.  Take it off within 30 seconds and stir continuously.

This is an excellent, fast and simple stir-fry and the cilantro really puts it over the top. To make it healthier, cut the oil in 1/2 at least. You can use whatever protein & veggies you like too, as long as you keep the oil/garlic/red pepper flakes/sliced onion/cilantro/soy sauce you will have a tasty dish. I doubled the recipe but not the oil and I forgot to add the water.  I used orange pepper, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower and served over brown rice with steamed edamame on the side. We could have used a little more spice and will add next time, but we are used to spicy Thai food. Ginger, lime juice, sesame oil - all good ideas. ***Update: I ate the leftovers 2 days after I made this for dinner. Don't know what happened because I loved it the day it was made, but the leftovers were hardly edible. Next time we won't leave any leftovers.

I used the advice of a previous reviewer and instead of using cabbage, I used green beans and white rice.  The recipe was a little spicy but good - I used small, baby shrimp - next time I think I would use the large shrimp.

it was tasty, i added green onions and used sesame oil and fish sauce as well. i also squeezed lime juice over the shrimp prior to stir frying it to make the dish tangy and more thai. definitely less red pepper than suggested. my mouth was on fire!   you can substitute the cabbage for bok choy as well. i served it with broken rice and it was delicious.

We really enjoyed this, but like others, made some changes from the original recipe, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. It seemed like it would need some additional flavor (and sauce), so at the end, I added a couple tsp of sesame oil and fish sauce  & a little powdered ginger (didn't have fresh on hand) to add some additional flavor to pour over top of the whole thing. I also used green beans instead of cabbage only because I had them. Loved the spiciness from the red pepper!!!

This had some kick!  I followed the recipe exactly, but tripled it for three, and it was a great (and quick) dinner.  I might decrease the red pepper flakes just a bit when I make this again, so the garlic stands out a bit more.

This was good. I'd have it again. I liked having it over shreaded cabbage instead of rice or noodles for a change. Less carbs.

This would have been better if there wasn't so much cilantro.  I doubled the recipe for my husband and I and thought the cilantro taste was way too over powering.  I will make this again without cilantro or with a lot less.

I make this dish pretty frequently and it is always a hit!  Sometimes I add chicken or scallops to the shrimp and it is a wonderful combination.  Just watch out on the crushed red pepper flakes if you do not like hot food!

FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS! I loved this recipe. I didnt even need rice! The cabbage was so good as a part of this dish. Since I buy 1 lb bags of shrimp, I doubled everything. I didnt think that this was spicy though. Next time, I may try and add some chili paste. Thank you for this recipe!!!!

Really good and really fast! I used more cabbage (actually pre-packaged coleslaw shreds) and used chicken breasts instead of the shrimp. Also, I used green onions instead of just regular onion. Even my 3-yr old liked it!

I used 1 lb of shrimp and doubled the other quantities (except the red pepper flakes). I used the pre-packaged cole slaw mix for the cabbage, but I was not happy with the result. The cabbage came out soggy. Next time I will just serve it with rice and maybe add a few pieces of cabbage with the shrimp. I also added vegetables, shaved carrots, green onions, celery and water chestnuts, which I will add again. The result was great.T his recipe cooks very fast, so next time I will start the rice earlier and prepare all the ingredients before I start cooking.

Love it!    Next time I will dial back the red chili flakes to about 1 1/2tsp.   I used fresh minced garlic from the garden, an entire clove for two servings.  This dish was AWESOME.  

Will try with chicken in the near future.

I upped the recipe to 4 servings and was astounded to see it call for 2 tbsp of red pepper flakes. So I reduced the pepper flakes to 1 tsp, and then I added a bit of green onion after it was plated. I have a lot of sesame oil so I used that - love the flavor. Very filling and tasty, but I suspect a little squinch of lime juice would have added a little zing. I'll try it next time!

Lovely dish with incredible sauce. The boyfriend cleaned the plate! Only suggestion is to tone down amount of red pepper flakes just a tad so you can fully enjoy the other flavours. This is a keeper and pretty to serve!

This was easy to prepare and tasted great.  I used a whole head/bunch of napa cabbage and 1/2 dozen shrimp.  Served over rice and it was enough for DH and I to have leftovers.  I wouldn't recommend making more than you will eat at one setting because I don't think this is a good leftovers type of dish.

I added in powdered ginger and peanut oil to the cabbage and it was delicious.  Also it is important to add water to the shrimp when cooking to ensure they remain juicy and succulent.  I like others didn't use as much red pepper as called for in the recipe, but I did let DH sprinkle in the amount he preferred while I cooked.  He really likes red pepper and still he didn't reach the 2 teaspoons called for in the original recipe.

WOW!  Tasted even better than I thought!  I added red bell pepper, then tossed the cabbage back into the mix for about 10 seconds before serving to get all the flavors together, then squeezed a little lime juice over the top - SSOOOOO delicious!  I will definitely make this again.  Very easy and fast!

To make this quicker I used the coleslaw mix from the grocery store instead of cabbage (as suggested by another reviewer).  I've made this with chicken and shrimp.  My boyfriend and I have very different tastes but this is something that we both LOVED.  It was a little spicy for me so I cut back on the red pepper flakes.

This recipe was so good and easy! Husband was enjoying it so much he didn't leave too much left overs for me. But that's ok. I did find the red pepper flakes to be too much so next time I make this it will definitely be cut down to what I would usually use to season it.

My fiance doesn't normally eat shrimp but I made this to switch up our normal menu and he said it was a winner!  I'll be making this a lot.  I cooked the shrimp in fat free pam with no oil so it was really healthy.  I will probably half the red pepper next time because it was pretty spicy!

This is great! I fixed it without cabbage the first time and added celery,carrots,yellow,green & red bell peppers & brocolli. Also added a little cornstarch to thicken for a gravy for the rice I served it with. My family was impressed, will fix this again & again!

This is my family's new favorite shrimp dish.  I did change it up a little bit.  I omitted the soy sauce (only because I was not in the mood for something saucy) and coated the shrimp in flour to make it a little more dry.  Followed the recipe for the rest of it. DELICIOUS!

Interesting!  I'm not too keen on cabbage and this recipe didn't change my mind but the entire family really enjoyed it.  I would probably make it again and add a little sweetness to the sauce next time.

I thought this could use a little more flavor. A little bland. I did have to cut way back on the red pepper because my kids (3 & 4) dont have a high tollerance for spicy things.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe.  Some changes I made..1.  used olive oil instead of vegetable oil 2.  added celery 3.  sauteed the shrimp, onions, celery, garlic all together..then added soy sauce, cilantro, and peppers.  The spice was perfect...if you enjoy spicy food.  Also, I left out the cabbage and served the shrimp with rice and a salad.

This was very good.  My boyfriend and I both loved it. It is very spicy, but we like spicy stuff. I doubled the cabbage, shrimp and added alot more garlic.  I will definitely make again.

This was a great base for stir frying shrimp.  We put it over rice and ommitted the cabbage.  Even though we enjoy spicey foods next time we will reduce the amount of pepper.  We used about 20 medium sized shrimp which was plenty for 2 people.

I really liked this. I would recommend using alot more cabbage because it just doesn't seem like much. I made the recipe for 3 and it still seemed a little small. I think more veggies and a few more shrimp would be a nice touch. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for the first time tonight and my husband loved it!!  It wasn't enough food for him, but he loved the flavor it had.  It contained 2 of his favorite foods - garlic and shrimp.  The only thing about it though, was that it was a bit too watery, but at least it still had all the flavor!

This is a quick and easy recipe, and it tastes wonderful!  I used about half the oil and it still tastes great, plus it's a lot healthier.  Will make this one again and again.

I find if you add those dry hot red peppers it gives this receipe a little harder kick. Overall its great if you like spicy food and shrimp.

We just had this for dinner tonight and it was very good...but spicy!  I doubled the recipe and followed the advice not to double the pepper and it was still pretty spicy.  I used 3 tsp, I think next time I would only use the 2 tsp called for in the single recipe.  Still very good.  I also used a cole slaw mix for the cabbage as a time saver.  Served it with thai sesame noodle mix and home made egg rolls (put some of the cole slaw mixture in egg roll wrappers and fry!).  Carol

This is so simple and so DELICIOUS! When you double it to cook for two, don't double the red pepper flakes (bring it back a tsp).  I added 2 tablespoons of sliced green onion as well to the single recipe.  I doubled the amount of fresh cilantro and used low sodium soy in the single recipe and it gave it a very crisp, fresh taste which prompted me to redo the recipe for two.

The shrimp tasted two-dimentional, just red pepper and soy; the onions were cooked too briefly to lend any real flavor or sweetness.  The cabbage bed was nice.

This came out a bit bland.  I cut back on the red pepper because I am not a big fan of spicy food, and added some peanuts and sesame seeds, but it just seemed to be missing something...

I quadrupled the cabbage and garlic (we love garlic) and doubled everything else, made for two people. My daughter cannot handle heat so I put only 1/2 tsp crushed pepper in the dish, adding more to mine at serving. It was wonderful! New family favorite, and I just might start upping the heat to see what I can get away with!

This was a very good and simple recipe. I added a yellow pepper and chopped onion. I stir fried the pepper and onion before I added the shrimp since they take longer to cook. I didn't have any cabbage so I served it over Jasmine rice. It was delicious!

A family favorite that I must always double!  Love the crunch of the cabbage layer.  I add about 3/4 cup crushed peanuts and about a table spoon minced ginger.  The only problem is that the red pepper flakes taste really really good, but they do not agree with us the next day.  Tried substituting serrano peppers once.  Still good, but not as good.

Excellent and very easy and quick.  Used less red pepper flakes, even though we both love spicy food.  I used 3/4 tspn.  Added some red bell pepper.  Used low sodium soy sauce.  Used cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

It was pretty good. I expected it be more spicy. It was probably that I tried to make it for 8  people instead of 2. I will make it again. I actually did not follow my own rule of making a recipe just the way it says the first time.

This is sooo good and easy! Only use 1/4 of the crushed pepper. Also, I measure all ingredients FIRST before I start cooking this because it goes so quickly. Too easy to overcook the shrimp. ENJOY! Have made it twice and look forward to doing it again. Will get shredded cabbage in a bag next time.

I loved this recipe for its simplicity. It was quick, easy and delicious. With that said there was NO WAY I was going to be able to eat it with 2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes. I had a slight sweat going with only 1/2 tsp. (Hence my one star deduction) Bravo to those of you who could eat this with the full amount of red pepper flakes.  The beauty of any recipe is the ability to modify to personal tastes. Thank you for this recipe, it will serve me well for a quick, midweek meal!

I made this twice, once with shrimp, then with chicken. Both times, the flavors that overwhelmed us the most were the hot pepper flakes and cilantro. Something's missing/off. Family didn't enjoy it much. I wouldn't recommend making this without adding/subtracting spices, as other reviewers suggest. Third time's not a charm with  this one. I don't think I will be using this recipe again.

I did not make it however I would like to make a suggestion. In place of the peppers try using Old Bay Spice. I had spiced shrimp in Virginia and it was great. Very mild heat and great flavor .

I substituted calamari for shrimp, incorporated the cabbage with the main dish and stir fried rice noodles in with the calamari.  It was way way way too spicy for us.  Using 2 tsp. of red pepper flakes:  wow, way too much.  I wish I would have just used 1/2 tsp or at most 1 tsp.  I will keep the recipe and try the shrimp but will cut the red pepper way back.

This is awesome and very easy to make ,surprisingly spicy . I used 3 tablespoons of red pepper flakes for 24 shrimp and it was perfect for our love of spice ( we grow ghost peppers ) so not kid friendly I ended up rinsing off the kids shrimp in the future they will get a separate batch sans peppers .

Very simple delicious shrimp dish.  I love the cabbage versus rice as a side. I used our homegrown dried chilies ground up. It was super hot and super good. Fresh taste, beautiful to the eye.

Really lacking the spice I had anticipated even after adding more hot sauce and chili powder. I would recommend looking into the suggestions that are provided in other comments for additional ingredients.

We didn't enjoy this recipe.  Cabbage may need a lot more time to cook and there is far too much red pepper.

The first time I made this, I made it as written.  I thought it was good, but much too spicy for me (I'm kind of a wimp).  The second time, I halved the red pepper flakes, which made the dish more enjoyable.  I also substituted a chopped cabbage-kale-broccoli blend because it was what I had on hand, and then served the cabbage and shrimp over brown rice for a delicious, filling dinner.  This was very good and I will be making this shrimp again.  Quick, easy and healthy.

AWESOME recipe for starters. Would be a 5 if a teaspoon of sesame oil was used while cooking shrimp. I added freshly grated ginger and sliced bell peppers with the onions.

The picture does not give justice to what this recipe looks like on a plate, ready for serving. It was rather elegant looking meal.  The flavor was great.  I think there might be additional items I will try next time. I did add some fresh lime juice.  Next time, after the peanut scare, I might stir a little of that into the dish and maybe a little bit more heat.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an easy recipe to make. I'd suggest using more water in the first step to cook the cabbage. This will also give you more sauce. I think I like my cabbage to be a little more tender, next time i'll cook for more than 30 seconds as well. Reduce pepper flakes if you dont like too spicy. I'd also maybe add a bit of sugar to accentuate the taste. This was a decent meal, but it felt like something was missing.

We tried this with tofu, and honestly, it just tasted like pepper. We even cut back the pepper to half of what was recommended. There was no flavor, all heat. I can't imagine it being any better with shrimp.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. It was easy and fast. The only thing I changed was the amount of pepper flakes. I increased the quantity because my boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE spicy food!

Thank you for this recipe!

This was really good, and I'll definitely be making this again! While I was cooking it up I thought it might be a little bland (absolutely no experience cooking Asian food, lol) but it tastes fantastic, just like the seafood I crave from restaurants. The one thing I did differently was to cook the onions down with the shrimp and garlic, but I only did that because I don't like firm onions. In the future I think I'll experiment with adding green peppers, and then increasing the sauce, but this is delicious with no changes. Thanks so much for sharing

I'll be sticking with the Yakisoba Chicken recipe on this site, which is similar but much more tasty and the ingredients are more in proportion.

I skipped the cabbage and added 1 T lemon juice and a bit of ground Chayenne pepper to give a kick.

I made this recipe for my mother and myself. I absolutely loved it as I adore spicy food, but my mom found it way too hot to eat (probably because she's accustomed to rather bland cooking). Just keep in mind who you're feeding when you make this meal...

This recipe is BLAND and BORING.  The description "Thai-style" is very misleading, as there is nothing Thai about this recipe.  I won't make this again.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! It tastes just a like a dish served at a restaurant. My family was quite blown away.
I followed the advice from the other reviewers and cut down on the red pepper...but it wasnt terribly spicy. So, for the next time I'll definitely add more red pepper to this.

Just tried this recipe because my husband loves shrimp. Usually the hotter the better, however this was almost too spicy hot to enjoy. Make sure you have a beverage nearby. Also the final mixture that pours over cabbage is too thin. An enjoyable flavor if you're looking for something different, so I'll be revamping recipe for better results (slightly less red pepper). Can't get any easier than this!

This was so delicious and easy to make! I converted it to serve 4, but had to cut back on the red pepper flakes ( I just used 1/4 tsp, 2 tsp seemed an awful lot and it was quadrupled when i had it converted). I served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli Its a dish I would serve to company. A keeper.

Has a fairly good spicy kick to it.  I've made this twice already; it's an easy one-dish dinner.  My main complaints: (1) this "one serving" isn't enough food for dinner for me.  (The second time I made it I multiplied everything by 1.5 and that sort of worked.)  (2) The cabbage base doesn't quite work for me.  It looks good and tastes fine in bites that are mostly shrimp with small doses of cabbage, but putting what appears to be a reasonable amount of cabbage on one's fork makes it  too cabbagey.  In the future I'll try putting the shrimp on something more mild and with more bulk, like rice.

I doubled the recipe for two and this was very hot with the red pepper, but still excellent. Next time I will do as another suggested and not double the crushed pepper. I loved it Thanks Joe.

This is so easy and fast and taste like gormet type Thai food.  I used less red pepper and served it with chinese noodles with garlic and lemon on the side.  My husband said it is was better than anything has experienced eating in a resturant.

Great recipe!!!!

Made this New Years Eve.. everybody raved about it.. I squeezed some lemon over the cabbage to give it some tang.
