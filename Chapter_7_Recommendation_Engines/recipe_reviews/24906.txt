An overabundant raspberry crop inspired us to try some new raspberry recipes.  Salsa seemed an easy and tasty idea--and this one was! I took it to work and got asked for the recipe--can't get higher compliments than that!  Plus, we made a second batch the next day.

Great recipe & nice change.  We were surprised that the fresh jalapeno chile pepper added flavor but not heat!  This was good paired with grilled swordfish.

I made this salsa for a bridal shower and put it on chicken kabobs.  I couldn't believe how yummy & fresh it tasted.  I'll definately make it again.

A very quick put together dish. BUT the longer you let it sit the better. It's says anhour but trust me the next day is even better. I poured over creamed cheese and dipped with wheat thins, hmmmmm very  yummy! Honey baked ham was the only place I knew that sold this different kind of salsa and now they no longer do :( SO thank you so much for sharing now I can enjoy all the time!

This was a huge hit!  I like to use tortillas with cinnamon and sugar (baked) for chips.  This one is always a hit at summer parties and is great with pork or chicken on the grill.  I usually skip the sweet onions and make sure to use FRESH lime juice.

I really loved this. I have to admit I was a little skeptical at first. I had lots of wild black raspberries to use up, so I decided to give it a try and made half a batch. I took another reader's suggestion and made cinnamon tortilla chips (I followed the directions from Annie's Fruit Salsa and Cinnamon Chips). I let the salsa sit overnight to allow the flavors to blend. I will definitely make this one again, the next time I harvest berries.

Excellent fruit salsa!  My husband considers himself a salsa expert and usually avoids fruit ones.  He loved this!  We used it with homemade tortilla chips, salted and cinnamon/sugared.  Can't wait to try it with chicken on the grill!

We made this for a party last night and it got rave reviews. I just served with tortilla chips. Great mix of sweet and spicy.

I made with frozen red raspberries and toasted the jalapeno before mincing.  I also added 1/8 teaspoon of kosher salt to bring up the flavor of the raspberries.  Looks amazing and I will see how my guests enjoy it.

I made this a couple of weeks ago and tried it with some lightly salty, cinnamon-sugar tortilla chips (as a few others have suggested), and since then, it's gone into regular rotation around here.  I tend to add a little bit more sugar, a pinch or two of crushed coriander seed, and a little bit less cilantro, but the recipe's great as is.

I was looking for a healthy alternative, and tried this.  I entered it into our work salsa competition, and I actually won 2nd place!!!  It was wonderful, and I didn't have any leftovers to take home.  I made it just like the recipe, but I quadrupled the recipe and I added an extra jalapeno, and laid off of the cilantro because it was too strong and over powered everything.   I also used Truvia instead of sugar.  This will be made again!!!

Excellent! Loved the combination of the sweet berries with the jalapenos and cilantro. A very pretty salsa as well! Very good with chips and I agree with others this would be a good salsa alongside chicken or pork. You could give it an extra "kick" with a little tequila too! Will make again for sure!

FANTASTIC with ripe raspberries! Existing picture doesn't so it justice. Added extra jalapenos and sugar to taste. I think the secret to when it's "ready" is adding enough lime juice to completely coat the raspberries so they start breaking down, and stirring regularly. After three hours we were spooning this onto barbequed ribs and EVERYONE loved it.
