Last minute switch over from the roll I originally picked. I cut this recipe in half and used buttermilk instead of plain milk and melted butter instead of shortening. I proofed the yeast in the bowl of my Kitchen Aid with the milk, water and sugar for ten minutes, then added the egg and melted butter, then the dry ingredients. I did need almost 3/4 of a cup more flour than the recipe called for to get it to form into a ball and jump on the hook. I kneaded the dough with the dough hook for five minutes. I got twelve cloverleaf rolls out of a half recipe, not fifteen. Either way, this was simple and turned out nicely. Not my first rodeo with yeast but my first Cloverleaf roll recipe. Success! NOTE: After I had one last night, I have to say that this is one of THE best rolls I've ever had. I owe it to using buttermilk and butter. Bakery quality. Really delicious. EDITED: I've made two half batches in three days. It's safe to say we love these rolls.

These were very good!  I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose and they turned out great.  I also used canola oil instead of the shortening.  I will definitely be making these again.

Great flavor.  Perfect texture, but best when right out of the oven.  I've made these twice now, and the first time I brushed them with egg before baking to get a nicer appearance.  They look like something on the cover of a cookbook.  They were a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner and I plan on making them often.

These did turn out pretty good for me, but I think I will add a touch more salt (maybe 1/2-1 tsp) next time as they didn't have the depth of flavor I was looking for.  However, they were excellent with butter.  I also had to add about 1 cup more flour to get the dough into an actual dough, not a batter.  I only have one muffin pan, so I made 2 more sheets of knot rolls, baked for the same amount of time as the cloverleaf rolls.  I also used an eggwash (beaten egg and water) before baking.  They came out perfectly golden.  I will probably make these again, but tweak them a little by adding more salt, or dipping the dough balls in melted butter before baking.

This was my first time making rolls and these came out fantastic!I forced myself to freeze some to keep from eating them all at once. The defrosted rolls were just as good as the freshly baked. If you are a beginning baker this is a great recipe to try.

This was an okay recipe for me.  I was looking for a cloverleaf roll recipe that was similar to the one I have in my recipe book (which is currently in storage).  The rolls came out drier than what I was expecting, and it did not have that "melt in your mouth" effect that I had with my other recipe.  If I hadn't known how good cloverleaf rolls COULD be, I might have rated this higher.  I tried this recipe twice just to make sure.  More than likely, I will not use this one again.

These have a nice texture and are very soft on the inside, but the flavor leaves a bit to be desired...they are so bland, there is no taste to them at all.  Won't be making these again, sorry.

Awesome recipe. Made it just the way it called for, only thing I did different was that I used my bread maker, and softened butter instead of shortening! My suggestion is to use melted butter on top after you roll them and after you take them out the oven.  Delish!!

Very good rolls.  The bottoms were a little darker than I would have liked, so I may reduce the oven temp a bit next time.

These were wonderful, and stayed moist, delicious, and flavorful even four days after I baked them. This recipe tastes almost exactly like one from the Whole Soy Cookbook, except that one calls for soy flour, but I never use that anyway so it's all good. Anyway, this is an excellent recipe and I highly recommend it. For a different taste, replace 1/2 cup of the liquid with 3/4 cup pumpkin, and substitute 1 tsp sage for some of the spices. It works beautifully every time!

I made these mostly as directed and they came out fantastic! Light and airy. I used less than 51/2 cups of flour; just add enough to make a soft dough after the initial 2 cups. At least, this is what i did and the rolls are verrrrry good!

A very light and easy to make roll. I am really excited about these rolls. They have a nice light texture,easy to make in my stand mixer. Everyone really enjoyed these. Although I believe I will add just a tad more salt to this recipe next time. Other than that an excellent recipe.

First off, I did cut recipe in half. Very good using buttermilk & melted butter vs shortening. I did dbl the seasoning (salt +) and my rolls were perfect as far as having flavor. I used bread flour as usual and 1/2 C WW flour in the beginning. If your dough dry, you added too much flour. I mix it to a tacky state and go from there. Spray your hands and work surface with non-stick to keep things workable without making these dry as dust. Too much flour will make any bread dough dense or heavy...don't do it!  I did use my K/A stand mixer but...I always knead dough by hand once it's pulled together. For me...I have to get a 'feel' for any bread dough with my hands. It's an art making any bread/rolls, etc. and found this recipe pretty simple with minor changes with liquids. Love it otherwise! Nice

Hmmm, I'm not sure how to rate this. I used buttermilk and butter like some other reviewers noted, but the bread just wasn't very fluffy - kind of dense. I added the flour as recommended, but the dough seemed pretty sticky. So I'd like to try it again, but I think I'll try it with more flour.

Using my stand mixer made this pretty easy.  And they're very tasty - soft on the inside and slightly sweet.  A great roll!  I actually got about 42 from this recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. I wish that I had read more reviews first.  I agree with one reviewer who mentioned adding more salt to the dough.  I also added the entire 5 1/2 cups of flour, plus some and it still felt sticky.  Taste was good, texture was heavy, and firmer than I thought it should have been.  Maybe that had something to do with the extra flour I'd added.

I made these using my bread machine dough option.  The only changes to the recipe I made were adding two tablespoons of gluten and using canola oil instead of shortening.  The recipe actually yielded a few more rolls than the 30 it called for (probably due to the way I divided it up).  They baked up nicely, though the three balls fused together more than in the picture.  They tasted great, though not a strong flavor like others have mentioned.

These turned out great.  I only had whole wheat flour, so I added a teaspoon of gluten per cup of flour.  I mixed the dough in my bread machine.  I ended up with more dough than muffin pans, so I made regular rolls in an 8 x 8 pan with the extra dough.

Had a recipe that I used for years, but had a hard time with with it in the last couple of years because it was tedious and too time consuming. I looked on this site and stumbled across this one....OMG! simply the best. A few changes I made, I added imimitation butter flavoring and added more sugar. The first batch I made where good but very "yeasty" and kind of bland. Don't get me wrong, they were great with butter, but I wanted to add some kick to them and the flavoring and additional sugar seemed to do the trick. I also used butter flavored shortening. A tip for people who have problems with the yeast proofing, add a teaspoon of sugar and you should not have any problems, works like a charm. I quadrupled the recipe(I have a big family)and it came out great. I had dough left over, baked them enough to set, then froze them, sort of my version of brown and serve. Family members requested them to serve with meals down the road.  A great recipe for anyone and easy.

I've made these for Thanksgiving two years in a row now--they taste wonderful and are so pretty--everyone loves them. I would not make them the night before, however, as they are definitely best right out of the oven.  That means careful planning/scheduling--but well worth it if you can manage it!

I made these today for Thxgiving tomorrow. WONDERFUL!! They turned out great!! Everyone is already eating them! I made a double batch because I didn't realize that one batch would make so many... I'm glad I did! Thank you so much for sharing!! I brushed the tops with butter/oil mixture before baking, it made the tops golden brown.

This is an extremely tasty addition to the family dinner.  Everytime I make it, my kids get excited.  I dont make the actual cloverlead, I use 24 larger balls of dough in two large muffin pans and put a slit in the top of each roll. Room temp butter always accompanies these rolls.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were delightful. My husband loved them. They do require a bit of work, but how can you cut short homemade bread? Not possible. :) We really enjoyed them! On the menu for Thanksgiving!
NOTE: I later made these with white flour instead of whole wheat---and, what a difference! The white flour makes them far more tender. The whole wheat, (maybe it was just the brand of wh. wheat I used?), made them still tasty but tougher.

Made these rolls twice. The first time I followed the recipe as written and though I found the rolls to be very light and fluffy, they were also overly yeasty without much depth of flavor. The second time I used buttermilk (milk with 1 Tb of white vinegar is a good substitute) and butter, increased salt by 1/2 tsp and reduced the yeast by half. With adequate kneading (google window pane test) and longer rise times, I achieved an equally light and fluffy texture without the heavy yeast flavor and the buttermilk and butter added a very nice flavor! I am very pleased!

This is a great recipe...First...I heated the water, milk, butter in the microwave for 2 min's added butter, and additional 30's min's in the microwave than added the yeast...put this in my kitchenaid mixer and added flour until a ball was formed.  I hand kneaded for 3-5 min's...put in a warmed greased bowl for 1 hr., punched down and made clover rolls...have to say I used crisco, but when growing up and making rolls with my grandmother we always put butter on our hands to make the balls (and would do this again next time because if you are going to indulge ...butter is the way to go).  When the rolls come out of the oven coat with butter. Awesome!

What I've been looking for for years!  Tender, soft.  I used butter as the shortening.  Mixed it all up in the bread machine and while my machine can only do a 3 cup flour loaf of bread, with a little assistance from a wooden spoon, it kneaded this up alright.  The kids helped me roll the balls.  We made 24 rolls and braided the rest together into a mini loaf.  YUM!

These rolls were fantastic.  We ate the test batch straight out of the oven and they didn't even need butter - so rich!  I'm up at 6:00 Easter morning to get started on a batch for the first dinner of the day.  Nothing says lovin' like hot delicious rolls!!

Wonderful.  Simply wonderful.  Family devoured these little puppies.  Used homemade buttermilk - only about 2/3rds of what was called for +/- - and used butter instead of shortening.  Lovely soft dough.  A half recipe gave us exactly enough for 12 rolls (each roll apx 59/60 grams if you're weighing things out).  We served with roast beef, whipped potatoes, and a salad.  We honestly couldn't tell which was better ... drizzled with honey butter, slathered in jam, or left plain to mop up the lovely gravy.  Will most assuredly make again and again and again.  Thanks so much for recipe!

I give this a 5 star for its delicious taste and texture.But someone should realy change the prep time to 2 hours instead of 35min.they should include the rising time it takes.
