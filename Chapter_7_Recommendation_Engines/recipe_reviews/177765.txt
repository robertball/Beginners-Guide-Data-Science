This was delicious!  I saw the other reviewer gave this recipe only 4 stars because after cooking for 40 minutes the "rice was still hard and undercooked".  The recipe calls for cooked rice so not sure how it can come out undercooked.  Anyway, give it a try, it's a wonderful, hearty recipe - especially for the fall/winter months ahead.

i made this tonight, most of the family enjoyed it.  since i have young (picky!) children, i changed it a bit.  i made the meatballs and baked them in a 350 oven for about 25 minutes and skipped the spaghetti sauce (which really isn't popular at our house).  i also did not have any oregano (blush) so i used 1/2 tsp of dried basil and also used a bag of microwaveable rice instead of cooking my own.  it was yummy and my husband is happy to take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

We loved these meatballs!  The turkey stayed moist and tender, and cooked just right simmering on low for 20 minutes. 
I sauteed the rice with butter and onion, before adding the water and a beef bouillon cube. This added a nice tang to the rice in the recipe.

An excellent dish which will make much loved leftovers.

I thought these were great.  My family enjoyed them too.  The only problem I had was that I couldn't tell if the meatballs had cooked all the way through because of the sauce.  They were tasty and are worth making again.

excellent. Have made this many times and the entire family loves them. The only thing I suggest to change is cook the meatballs separately. Once they are mostly cooked thru, add the sauce and continue until the meatballs are thoroughly cooked. Keeps the tomato sauce from reducing too much and burning

Tasted great. Wasn't sure if I was supposed to cook the rice or what, but I did so next time I might use crumbs instead, the rice made the meat fall apart. I won't cook it w/ the sauce either, seemed like it took FOREVER to cook thoroughly.

I have to give this recipe a five star review.. they were perfect! I have to admit that I didn't pay attention to all instructions and didn't notice it said COOKED rice (as I assume other reviewers have done). I made a couple small changes but nothing major. I always cook my meatballs in the oven so that was one change.. 350 oven for an hour or so (depending if recipe is doubled or trippled etc). I made a triple batch so they were in the oven probably hour and a half. Also I wanted a little more of the original porcupine meatball flavor so for every jar of prego I added two cans of tomato soup. I also put in a handful of brown sugar in the sauce to give it a sweet/sour flavor. In three pounds of hamburger I put in four cups of rice and that was LOTS! (keep in mind i thought it was uncooked rice i was suppose to use.. my mistake). These meatballs are a huge hit!

Too much rice, but the meatballs are delicious. I always experiment with different spices. I'll perfect it eventually.

I gave this 4 stars because I made this as written and cooked for 40 min and the rice still was hard and undercooked. The flavor was excillent. Will make again but use little less rice. GREAT flavor though!!

I followed the recipe's ingredient list exactly and there is little flavor to the meatballs - the only flavor was the sauce.  The meatballs had little flavor. The one thing I did change was to put the meatballs in the oven (per another reviewers suggestion) I have had little success with cooking meatballs on a stovetop.

My kids love these meatballs!  This is my go-to recipe for a quick and easy dish that is also very inexpensive.  The flavor is excellent.  I have also tried it with ground turkey sausage and omitted the seasoning.  Came out great that way too!

Nice and simple.  If you cook meatballs in the oven without sauce kids can dip them in the sauce of their choice.

After 10min of simmering the meatballs were nowhere near cooked so I turned the heat up A BIT and by the time they were done there was no sauce, only gunk burnt to the bottom of the pan.  I wont be making this again.

Wasn't thrilled with this on the first day because we thought it needed way more seasonings BUT it was fantastic on the second day.  Next time I'm doubling the garlic and oregano.  Also, need to use really lean beef if you use beef.  I ended up skimming the top quite a few times.

When I read this recipe, I thought there was no way these would be anything to write home about. I just needed something different to try with that bland looking container of ground turkey. Wow, was I wrong! These were wonderful - moist, flavorful, perfect. I was amazed that something with so few ingredients could be so tasty. Goes to show that sometimes less really is more. Give them a try!

I have NEVER rated a recipe this low. I honestly can't say what it would have tasted like had it worked out. I followed to a T the directions to make the meat "balls". The mixture was a mushy mess that would NOT hold the shape of a ball AT ALL. I tried to salvage it by making meat patties only to be extremely underwhelmed with the "flavor". I added some garlic salt and worcestire sauce to add more flavor and it was edible but more a rice patty than a meat patty. I couldn't bring myself to waste a perfectly good jar of sauce along with what use to be perfectly good ground turkey and rice.

Yum!  I followed the recipe exactly and these were delish!  Might try cooking the meatballs in the pan w/o sauce first to get them nice and brown, then add sauce for the last 10 min. or so.  I found that my sauce got very thick and pretty much cooked out.  But still very tasty!

Used brown rice.  Definitely need to tweak the spices quite a bit.  Not very flavorful.  Will try to use some chix broth when cooking rice next time.

This is a good recipe.  For those who want a little more flavor than ground turkey generally provides, flavor the rice. I added a can of Cambell's condensed chicken broth with garlic and some roasted bell pepper and garlic spice blend while cooking the rice.

only okay--may have been better had I followed to a "T", but I chose to bake the meatballs first, since that's what I usually do when I make meatballs.  They were a bit dry, although the sauce did help with that.  Probably won't make again.

I cooked them in the oven first until they were almost done and then poured a jar of BBQ sauce over them and kept them on low in the crockpot.  They didn't hold up and fell apart but the flavor was nice...people commented that it was strange to have rice in meatballs :)

Very good recipe.  I did a few things different.  First, I only used one cup of cooked rice since two seemed like too much.  I used about 1/3 cup of bread crumbs to help the meatballs stay together.  I would also suggest using the leanest ground turkey you can find because I believe that helps them stay together during cooking.  I made my own sauce using tomato paste and seasoning packets to which I added more water than the recipe called for to avoid burning the sauce while cooking the meatballs.  I added about 1/4 cup grape jelly to the sauce just for fun.  They turned out delicious.  Hubby loved 'em.

These could probably use a little more spice, but were still pretty good to eat, as per the recipe.

Made this tonight. Altered the recipe a bit; doubled the meat, cup and a half of cooked rice, italian seasoning rather than just oregano, fried the meatball for a few minutes before placing with the sauce, oh and forgot the pepper. Everyone enjoyed it, but was a little on the mushy side in the middle (probably because I precooked?). Will try again!

I had to use 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to help bind them together and put them in the frezer for 10 min.  I know the recipe says to pack them tightly, but you can only do that so much.  Mine fell apart too.  I liked the taste of the meatballs and froze the other half which I am thinking of browning up like I would hamburger for spaghetti sauce and putting it on pasta, same concept, different application.

I tried cooked and uncooked rice in this recipe. I ended up using uncooked.  I added a little more liquid to the sauce to cook the rice through. Adding pre cooked rice to the meat just ended up being over cooked mushy rice in the end. Cooking the rice with the meat at the same time made the rice cooked perfect. And they seemed to have more flavor.  We made meatball subs the next day with the leftovers.

This recipe is my husbands favorite. It has been in the regular rotation for years. Great with seasoned rice, Italian seasons, and/or 7 Herb Ragu (get's a little bland without the seasoning).

My daughter was already claiming the leftovers when I first served these.  They were well-received by all ages.  Thanks!
