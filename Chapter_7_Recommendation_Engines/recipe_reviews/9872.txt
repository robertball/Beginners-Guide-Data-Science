Oh, how I wish I had read these reviews before I made these cookies yesterday.  I found that the dough was VERY difficult to work with.  So sticky that I couldn't get it off my hands!  I agree that you have to use a SIGNIFICANT amount of flour in order to be able to manipulate the dough.  I am somewhat pleased with the taste, but I wouldn't use this recipe again just because of the aggravation in working with the dough...

I've been using this recipe for years and wanted to pass on some helpful tips.  All butter is not created equal!  For this recipe the quality of your butter makes a big difference.  If on the side of the box it states that it "meets specifications for grade declared"  then you can count on a low butter quality.  Use only the best butter you can afford.  Also for this recipe I use extra large eggs.  This helps with the texture and makes the dough easier to work with.  I also add an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  If the dough is still too soft after trying these suggestions, I have found that using half butter half shortening works every time.

The end result is nice, but getting there is WAY too much trouble.  "Knead in enough flour to make the dough workable" translates to about 3 more cups, which leads to a slightly cake-like cookie.  Not to mention the trouble of adding all that flour.  I reduced the amount of milk to 1/4 cup, and added it in teaspoons as I mixed, but that still didn't help -- neither did freezing the dough for an hour, although it did make it *slightly* easier to work.  If you don't mind all that, then the recipe is worth it for the soft taste (altho I did add about a tablespoon of lemon rind). However, *I* will definitely be using a different recipe for sugar-cookies.  :(

I love trying new recipes, so many times when I make cookies (which is very, very frequently) I try something from this site that I've never tried before.  I followed this recipe precisely, using large (not extra large) eggs and they turned out great.  As usual, I didn't refrigerate the dough, but immediately rolled out cookies between two sheets of wax paper, dipped cutter into flour, cut out the cookies and placed them on foil-lined sheets.  (But make sure the shiny side is down and cookies are placed on dull side.  Otherwise, too much heat will be reflected and cookies will burn.)  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Ingrid!

I have never had much luck with sugar cookies, UNTIL NOW. These were easy, no chilling required (which I love), easy to roll out, and they don't get hard after baking like others I've tried. Family loved them! All around excellent. Great recipe! I highly recommend. A+++

My family and I just didn't like the taste of these cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly and found it to taste more like flour than anything else.

Poor recipe! Dough was very sticky and ended up adding a lot of flour. Cookies turned out to be more like a cake. Will not use again.

I absolutely love this roll out recipe. The dough is soft, easily malleable and has a wonderful consistancy for a roll out recipe. For me the instruction to "knead in enough flour" is wonderful because I often times find that recipes which are too strictly written do not turn out right for me. With this recipe it is more to the taste of the baker than to that of the recipe writter. What amazes me the most with this recipe is how wonderfully the dough can be rolled out thin then puff beautifully when baked. The almost cakelike consistancy when rolled thick makes them perfect for  Black and White cookies. This recipe is a family favorite now in our house hold after I made christmas cookies with it last year and they didn't last longer than one afternoon!

very easy to roll out... didn't need a lot of extra flour like others suggested.  I did chill the dough, but found that it worked the best when it wasn't too cold- or too warm.  just a little cooler than room temp worked best for me.  I've found my new sugar cookie recipe!! Thanks!

I give this recipe 2 stars.  My husband summed it up pretty well by saying, "they look like cookies, they smell like cookies, but they sure taste like nothing!"  Also this batter was very sticky and hard to work even after refrigerating.  I was looking for a soft, chewy, flavorful sugar cookie to make for Christmas.  This was not the sugar cookie recipe for me.

This is NOT a good recipe for cutting cookies.  It needed either MUCH more flour or much LESS liquid.  Like another reviewer, I'd planned on making cut-out cookies with my daughter (husband threw away my other recipe), but we ended up just scooping it out onto the cookie sheet - it would not hold any shape and it stuck to EVERYthing.

I also ended up adding 1 tsp of vanilla for taste.

Dough was not just soft, it was way to soft to roll. Once enough flour was added where rolling was possible, the cookies came out bland.

I just made thses and they are really easy and good. I read many reviews that said the dough was sticky and hard to work with so I decided to leave out the milk all together. It worked perfectly. I didn't need to add any additional flour, it was perfect rolling consistancy. I also used butter instead of shortning, but that is just my preference. Hope this helps.

The dough was extremely soft and sticky, and to be able to roll them out I had to add quite a bit more flour which ended up in a cake textured flour flavored cookie.  Not what I expected out of a sugar cookie recipe.  They were not bad cookies, just not to my taste.

This dough starts out extremely soft...more like drop cookies.  Expect to knead in about 1/2 C of flour.  Also, the dough smelled a little bland when I first mixed it, so I added 1 t each of lemon and vanilla extracts.  The cookies turned out amazingly well, but expect them to puff up a lot in the oven.  The flavor was exceptional, and they're tender but substantial...they don't have that floury taste most cut out sugar cookies do.  I loved them!  They're a little difficult to roll out, but well worth the trouble.  Use large shapes and you'll be impressed with these cookies.

The dough was only slightly thicker than a muffin batter, even after being refrigerated.  The cookies distorted as I tried to place them on the cookie sheets.  I added vanilla and decorated with sugar, but they were still bland!  Sorry.  The hunt for lactose free cookies continues...

Absolutely delectable! If you use butter shortening instead of regular, and cover in sugar  they are going to fly off the plate like mine did. :D

The cookie itself was... okay. I've definately had better. The flour method was horrible though, and I ended up adding 1 cup more flour per batch to the bowl, just so it didn't stick to everything! When it was finally ready, it was VERY easy to roll out, and had a lovely texture, but it wasn't as sweet as I would have liked. I did also add almond or else it would have just been flavorless. I would either use a lot of sprinkles in future, or frosting would be even better. Oh, and it does make more cookies than listed, too. I make a quadruple batch for holiday cookies, and it ended up making 17 dozen, rather than 12. I had to give them away to everyone!

Very Very AGGRAVATING!!!! The dough is to soft and to sticky. You can not kneed in enough dough to make this receipe work. It sticks to everything!!! Plus it is not sweet enough. The tops have to have sugar added to them in order for it to even come close to tasting like a sugar cookie. I will never use this again!!

Bummer... very hard to work with, after i worked it for a while then they became a little easier to pick up. Needs to flour cutters and more flour in dough. Tastes bland and I even added Almond and Vanilla extract.  Won't be making again!

The recipe for these cookies bakes up a tasty cookie, however I  too thought it was just more work rolling and cutting than other recipes  for cut-outs I have used, I did refrigerate dough and with some time the cookies came out very nice, I just will use a less time consuming recipe next time, but these were not a waste, like I said they were very tasty. Thank you Evelyn.

I love this recipe. The cookies are soft and fluffy and have a great sweet taste. Instead of adding just the 1 1/2 cups of sugar, i suggest adding 2 cups. Every time i make these i get requests for the recipe.

I only used this recipe because my good one was boxed up.  This was terrible to work with.  I knew I should not have added the milk.  I am sure that they will be tasteless when cooked because I had to add so much flour to cut them out and get them off the board.

I, too, wish I would have read the reviews. This dough is too difficult to work with! It's incredibly soft and sticky. I'm afraid to keep adding flour to it, for fear of what it might do to the taste. My search for sugar cookies continues!

I love this recipe.  Remember to put alot of flour on surface and carefully manipulate dough.  I divide in 1/4's which makes it easier to handle.  I add almond flavoring.

This all in all was a good recipe.  The cookies turned out great, and no need to refridgerate the dough before rolling ( a great time saver). However I did add a tsp of vanilla extract (kinda surprised it didnt call for vanilla or almond extract?) not sure how they would have turned out without it.  Also you really did have to add ALOT of flour to the dough when kneading it.  ALOT of flour, so it was messy.  I had so much dough sticking to me and everything.  But once you got the consistancy right....it rolled out SUPER EASY!

Very bland cookie. Shaped up well and was easy to cut when I added an extra cup of flour.

Just okay.  They do turn out to be nice soft cookies, but the dough rolls more like biscuit dough than cookie dough, and thus i ended up adding at least 2 extra cups of flour to keep it from gluing to my surfaces.  I did add 1t vanilla and 2t almond extract, so that helped with maintaining a nice flavor instead of being just a 'floury' hunk.  If I tried again, I'd reduce the milk to see if I could avoid all the extra flour.  Not really special alone, but an acceptable cookie when frosted.  I'll keep looking for the right soft cookie though.

This is the long lost recipe my family has been searching for.I have been trying diff. recipes to match that of my grandmothers. They aren't too flavorful, but with sugar granules sprinkled ontop, they are just perfect and so reminiscent of growing up in her house. Thank you...(sniff)

I found the dough to be very soft, but with added flour, it worked out well. The dough didn't even need to be rolled out; I just patted it down and cut out shapes. By themselves, even with added vanilla the cookies were quite bland, but with frosting and sprinkles they were fabulous. Perfect taste, not too sweet, and very soft. I very highly recommend them if you're planning on frosting them. Otherwise, I would find a sweeter sugar cookie recipe.

These cookies came out of the blender WAY TOO SOFT!!! Then - by the time I added another 2-cups of flour  - they tasted like four balls once baked. I should have called my mother for her recipe.

If the dough is too sticky and difficult to work with you are not adding enough flour.  This recipe takes a lot.  I also added a little vanilla to the recipe, and I got lovely, soft sugar cookies that took frosting well, help up and didn't crumble, and got rave reviews.  Definitely keepers!

If you are hesitating, TRY THIS RECIPE!!! I am absolutely amazed. I was looking for a recipe that required no chilling, and I came across this. My 5 yo son and I made them together, so for those people complaining about the kneading: A 5 year old can do it! This recipe is WAAYY easier than most sugar cookie recipes. If you're looking for homemade, quick, fun sugar cookies, this is it. The baking soda/powder combo created a light, fluffy, airy deliciousness that is unlike any I've ever tried. We were making Christmas cookies- these are beautiful,  and more importantly, delicious! No modifications required. I wish I could give it 10 stars. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe! We loved it.

I started this recipe before reading the reviews, but then noticed it got only 3.5 stars.  I decided to continue, but did make some adjustments that may help others.  I was surprised at the amount of milk, so I only added small splashes of milk after the second and third flour additions.  The dough looked about right, but was still a bit difficult to work with.  Instead of using flour to keep the dough from sticking, I used powdered sugar...same results as flour but better taste for the cookies.  I did also add 1 tsp of vanilla, as some had said it was bland tasting.  I also baked the cookies for about 8 minutes, as in my oven, 10 minutes made them too brown.  Good cookie, with those changes

I'm pretty upset, as well, that I didn't read the reviews. I "kneaded" in over a cup of flour and STILL couldn't manage this dough. I ended up rolling the dough out on my cookie sheet, laying out my cutters and then removing the excess dough b/c this dough was sticking to EVERYTHING. This recipe had me in tears and beyond frustrated. The dough tasted alright, but it's NOT worth the struggle.

I also found it very soft.  I think I would have done without some of the milk.  I used 1/2 cup and I think that was too much.  Next time, I will try without any milk and see how that does.

This is a very good tasting sugar cookie, but as a lot of the other reviews say, it was very sticky and needed lots more extra flour added to it to even be able to roll it out.  But, it's worth it for the softnest and taste!  Thx

These cookies were nice and easy.  Light and easy to roll.  Not too flour sensitive; so I could roll out my leftover dough over and over. I added a teaspoon of vanilla.

I didn't knead the dough, instead I beat everything but the milk until it resembled flour, then added the milk to wet it. I had no trouble rolling it out. It was the easiest sugar cookie recipe ever.

I always have a problem with sugar cookies: When I cut them and place them in the oven: They spread!!! It seems like if they're melting and loose the form! 
 What am I doing wrong?
 I love them, love their taste and love to make them. But I dont know why do they spread like that. 
 Please Help Me!!!!

Used only 1/2 cup milk and added about 1/2-3/4 cups flour. The best recipe for sugar cookies other than that. Not dry. Traveled ok

The cookies turned out okay, but there is not nearly enough flour to roll them.  I added probably a cup (I had doubled the recipe) while mixing and kneaded in more after refrigerating them overnight.  There is no set height to roll them either.  I rolled varying heights and ended up with twice as many as the recipe said.

These cookies needed A LOT of flour.  I found myself adding too much, and the final product tasted a little like cornbread.  They tasted ok, but not like a sugar cookie should taste.  I even added some orange extract and vanilla extract for more flavor, but they still came out a little bit bland.

This is an easy rolled cookie.  There was no waiting for the dough to chill.  too fast.  Taste great.

A little sticky at first, but when I added flour while rolling (quite a bit, really) it was much easier to work with.  Baked up great and tasted fantastic!
