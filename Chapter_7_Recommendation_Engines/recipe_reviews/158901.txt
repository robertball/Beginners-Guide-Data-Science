This is an incredibly easy and very delicious recipe.  I modified it slightly by adding a can of chicken broth before adding the rest of the water, but otherwise did not add or change anything.  I cooked it on low for 5 hours which was more than sufficient and used a potato masher instead of dragging out my blender and dirtying another item.  This left a few minor chunks of potato in the soup which added to its consistency.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

This was wonderfully easy.  I used chicken stock (kitchen basics is the best!)instead of water and 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the evaporated milk.  I took the suggestion of topping with shredded cheese and bacon crumbles and made Beer Bread 1 from this site it was the perfect accompaniment. Thanks for the great recipe.

This soup is wonderful and easy. I threw some broccoli and cheddar cheese at the end and it was a big hit. My husband said he'd give it ten stars if he could. From one busy mom to another, thanks for a keeper!

I am the original submitter of this recipe, and I just wanted to add a note about blending the soup.  Yesterday was the first time I tried putting it through the blender cold, and it was awful!  What a terrible texture - all lumpy and grainy.  I'd definitely recommend blending it hot, very carefully.  DO NOT FILL THE BLENDER TOO FULL!  Half way should be good.  Another option is to use one of those blender wand things, and blend it right in the pot.  The texture is much better then.   Thanks to all who have reviewed this recipe so far!  I hope many of you enjoy this soup as much as I do.

Good recipe! Makes for a nice base to add items to.  Thought it needed a little more salt & pepper, but you can add that to taste as you serve. It is good just by itself, but we have added just cheddar cheese, broccoli & cheddar, bacon and cheddar, canned corn & bacon.  The possibilities are endless.  Plus its easy to fix.

Wow!  This was so simple and very good.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it was way too salty and I had to add some regular milk (in addition to the evaporated milk) because it was so thick.  I will definitely make this again with less salt and more milk.  Thanks!

Great!!! Added 1/2 tsp basil 1/8 tsp thyme and 1 large clove garlic, topped with shredded cheddar and real bacon bits. Served with turkey and swiss sandwiches on crusty french bread. Fantastic will make again!

Great base recipe.  My slow cooker was filled to the brim.  You will need a large crock pot for this one, or cut the recipe in half.  I also added some corn startch at the end because it was still to thin.  I have two quart size bags left in my freezer that I will be heating up for lunch out on the ski slopes.  We added cheese and bacon bits (buy the bag of real bacon bits, it sure beats the mess that bacon makes, costco sells a large bag that is reasonable, that's a staple in my house).

This is so easy and so yummy!  No leeks at my local market, so I used a Spanish onion instead, and added some sauteed carrot and celery after I mashed up the soup - no blender so I used a potato masher before adding extra veggies.  I can imagine this would be amazing with some bacon or smoked sausage, as the contributor suggested.  A little cheddar cheese on top is great, too!

This was such a good but easy recipe. Our whole family, even our picky 2-year-old, loved it!  I did make a couple of changes - based on what I had in the kitchen at the time. I used 3 cups of low-sodium broth instead of boullion cubes, 1 cup of half and half & 1 cup of milk instead of evaporated milk, and I used a potato masher rather than a blender to mash the potatos, in order to leave some texture. This soup cooked perfectly and tasted great after a busy day at work - paired with a nice salad and crusty break, it was a lovely, easy meal.

This soup is just like the professional potato leek soup I order in restaurants. Maybe even healthier since it doesn't contain any half and half or heavy cream. It is delicious! The whole family loved it and I made it exactly as the recipe stated.

Very awesome recipe, great flavor, simple to prepare, as most say it does lack in salt, I added 3 cloves of garlic and only cut 2 of the leeks we put cheddar cheese on top too, instead of using the blender I used my immersion blender right in the slow cooker. I will definitely make it again!

This was so easy and delicious. I will definitely make it again.  I only changed it by adding four leeks and a 1/2 tsp of sea salt.

I thought this was going to be an excellent soup.  For my taste, there were too many leeks.  Three leeks equalled almost two cups.  I would approach the recipe again and add 1 leek and use milk instead of evaporated milk.  The taste was off.  It's my favorite soup and I order it whenever I see it on the menu.  This was too odd in flavor.

Absolutely delicious! I did add 2 cloves of garlic and did not use onion.  Also next time i think i will mash instead of puree, but this is the best potato soup I have ever had!

I LOVE this recipe. My variation on this is to use a potato masher to thicken the soup, and not the blender. It leaves a few bits of potato mashed and some chunks for some interest.

I made this soup on the stove and added 1 t. or so of dill weed based on other recipes I saw.  I also used more bullion (1 cube/cup of water) and olive oil instead of butter. It was amazing.  I think I might skip the additional salt next time since the bullion already has a lot, but I rarely use salt, so it might have just seemed a little extra salty to me and others would not think it overly salty.  Definitely the best potato leek soup recipe I've ever made, and I've made a lot of them.  A keeper for sure. I think it would adapt nicely to become a clam chowder base as well.

Good soup.  Wasn't sure about the leeks because the recipe called for so many of them.  I blended everything as the recipe called for.  When serving, I sprinkled some bacon pieces over the bowlful added some sour cream and black pepper and it was good.  This recipe is pretty forgiving.  The nite I made it, I was doing too many things in the kitchen all at once and I put the soup on high for three hours before I realized that I forgot to add the water.  I then added some water and cooked a couple more hours and it still came out good.

So yummy! Added 3 cloves of garlic, a can of corn and some precooked smoked sausage. Didn't need to blend it at all. Used a potatoe masher instead. Also, used a cup of half & half instead of evaporated milk since I didn't have any. Turned out fantastic!

Made some small changes.  I used 5 large baking potatoes (seemed like a lot).  I also replaced some of the water with a 32 oz. carton of vegetable broth (thought I was adding chicken broth) and then topped off with water and 1 bouillon cube per cup of water.  I went easy on the salt since I was adding broth and I omitted the pepper since I don't like it.  Make sure you let the soup cool a bit or it may explode from the blender!  This soup is amazing!!  My 7 year old had FOUR servings!

Like other reviewers have stated, this is a very good basic potato soup recipe to build from.  Adding what has been suggested by the contributor or other reviewers is a must for a well-rounded flavorful soup.  I, too, only processed 1/2 the soup and left the rest in slightly mashed chunks.  I added corn (would have also added broccoli and celery, but had none).  The soup still ended up needing something, so I added cheddar cheese to the pot of soup itself and stirred till melted.  That did the trick - especially for the kids.  There are many, many possibilities for this recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

Very good! I was hoping I wouldn't have to blend the soup but I did have to. The only soup I've had that was better was when the potatoes were baked first. Will make again!

5 Stars for easiness.  Flavor--maybe need more salt, but totally doable without it.  Consistency was perfect

Loved this soup, delicious!  I did add some dried basil and garlic while it was cooking and used chicken broth instead of boullion cubes and did not add salt...I also cut the amount of potatoes to 4 instead of 8 due to diabetes family members and it didn't matter, it was perfect!!!!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a great base recipe but you need to add things like cheese ad veggies to make it a meal soup.

I was anticipating a creamy smooth potato soup.  The recipe had a watery consistency and the odor of the leeks was very overpowering and unappealing.  The recipe was followed exactly.  I was very disappointed in the entire recipe.  In fact only one bowl was eaten.

Followed the recipe aside from adding some fresh garlic and was amazing!  Would be good with bacon and some cheese as well.

Great recipe, especially for something easy to throw together earlier in the day so it's ready when you need it.  Didn't have leeks so used green onions.  Also used regular milk as I didn't have evaporated milk.  Mine was kind of salty but my potatoes were on the smaller side so that's probably why.  Very good and will definitely make it again!  Served it in homemade bread bowls and it was yummy!

The soup didn't have a lot of flavor so I added a can of corn and made it into a corn chowder.  After that I thought it was a little better.

This was excellent! Thank you for the recipe!
I didn't have leeks but it was great anyway. It was my first time making this kind of soup. I chopped up the potatoes nice and small, added chopped bacon with the onion, and a couple scoops of salsa and chilli pepper sauce. I slow cooked on high for 2.5 hours before blending it, then added celery, carrots, peas, corn, mushrooms, red pepper, cooked for another hour and voila! beautiful soup. Topped with cheese and bacon of course. Super hardy and flavourful. Great as left-overs, the flavour gets even better the next day.

This soup was easy to make, but it has a terrible smell.  My husband wouldn't even try it, and I ate just one serving.  The soup's texture and taste weren't so bad, but there was an after taste which resembled the smell.

I loved this.  I left about half the soup unblended which gave it some nice potato chunks.  I added some turkey kielbasa (sliced) to the soup and served it with crusty bread.  Will definitely make again!

So good.  My picky eaters loved it too.  I didn't have time for the slow cooker, so this was made on the stove.  I forgot to buy the leeks, so I sauteed the onions in butter until golden. I also added garlic, garlic salt, and we sprinkled the top with cheese and had brauts with it.

Yummy.  I only had about 1 cup of leeks, so I used two small onions, instead of 1.  Instead of 8 servings I got 10!

This soup was wonderful. Even better the following night. My husband wants it again. I added garlic and a bit of thyme to mine. Used a potato masher and added half and half in place of other milk. Thus was so easy! Never knew I cook make something so good.

This is a huge hit at my house!  I use more chicken broth than what this recipe calls for and I also season it with Season All, in addition to the salt and pepper.  We top it with shredded cheddar and a dash of Cholula. Yummm!!

My family loved it, very filling. I skipped the onions and leeks. I added 1 pkg diced ham, 1 pkg real bacon, 4 oz shredded cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup of flour (to thicken).

Quite delicious. I use chicken broth and a bit of water, I don't use the bouillons. I use half & half instead of  condensed milk. I only use 2 leeks because I really don't want my soup overpowered with too much leek flavor (personal preference). The hardest part is peeling the potatoes, otherwise, this is very good, easy and I take it to potlucks and people rave about it. I also have shredded mild cheddar cheese and crispy bacon crumbles  freshly cooked available  - just wonderful.

This soup had a watery consistency.  I didn't use the leeks but it still had too much of an onion flavor.  I added broccoli, but that didn't help.  
  I won't be making again, and I'll be going back to my old recipe.

VERY GOOD. A good start to fall soup cooking. I used 1 leek ,part chicken stock part water,cooked 4 hours, added milk, warmed a bit  then puréed.
Consistency was fine for us. Added finely chopped broccoli and corn , also a bit of cayenne. Froze some. Very nice.

Very good, I modified a bit. Added chicken broth instead of bullion and water, extra onion, no leeks. At the end, after the evaporated mild was added I added a bit of plain greek yogurt (1/4C) and 1C cheddar cheese. Then I used an immersion blender to blend partially to make creamy but leave chunks.

My husband and I did not like the consistency of this soup after putting it through a blender.  Now I know we prefer potato soups with chunks of potato.  Like another reviewer said, we also found it very bland despite adding spicy Italian sausage crumbles to it.  It was edible though, so we give it a three-star.

I was excited to try this because of the great ratings, but I found it to be a rather bland soup.  I even tried spicing it up with a few of the recommended spices, but it just didn't have great flavor or consistency.  I'll keep searching for a great potato soup recipe for the winter months!
