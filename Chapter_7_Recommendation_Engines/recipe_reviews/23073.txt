This was a great recipe, but I have some tips for others wanting to make the recipe.  The taste, I thought, was great but you could add more spices if you want to.  (Just look at other gingerbread recipes to find out an average) Also, some people were complaining about the crunchiness of the cookies.  I noticed that too, but then I stopped rolling the dough so thin and they came out nice, gingery and somewhat soft and tasty!

I made these cookies for Christmas this year.  I found that rolling the dough 1/4" instead of 1/8" made the cookies softer and more fun to decorate.  My daughter decorated the cookies, putting two together with an "I Love Mom & Dad" theme (as seen in the photo).  

I am not the best baker, an have minimal experience with rolling dough, but I learned three things from making this batch of cookies.

1.  Put more than a thin layer of flour on the board before rolling the dough.  My first attempt had the dough sticking to the board because I used a light dusting of flour.
2.  Brush off the flour from the bottom of the cookies before eating them.  They taste MUCH better that way.
3.  I used the Reynolds Parchment Paper on the cookie sheet for the first time. I really like the results that I had.  The cookies didn't stick to the sheet and it didn't allow over cooking the bottom of the cookies.

This made a beautiful gingerbread house! I used the template on this website and did the recipe exactly as it says to here. It made a gingerbread house and quite a few large gingerbread people. This was so easy and looks pretty. :)
A note though: the frosting recipe is a good one, but it must be used fresh. If you're making your house over several days time, then just make enough of the frosting for that day.

This is a great recipe. I added more spice. 2  1/2 tsp ginger, 2 tsp cloves, 2 tsp cinnamon and i also added nutmeg for that extra kick. They are awesome. Soft and delicious. I will definatly be using this recipe for my gingerbread house. Oh and just so u know, use Fancy Molasses for gingerbread. I didn't know that there are 5 types of molasses. I used cooking molasses for my first recipe and they turned out really dark and tasted too licorishy. Although cooking molasses is a mixture of fancy and blackstrap its way to strong for gingerbread, but great for ginger snaps. Hope this helps.
I used the royal icing recipe , it turned out great. Ofcourse i added color to some and made them extra special.

i had to add about a half cup more flour to the dough in order for it to be workable for the cutouts, and the surface needed to be heavily floured.  but once i figured that out, the cut outs came out well and they cooked in about 6 minutes (contrary to the 8-10 minutes in the direcions).  the icing was so easy - i did a few colors, put them in small zip bags, and cut the very tips off the bags and voila!  it was a big hit with (and great activity for) my party goers!

These cookies were so easy to make.  I laughed when I saw it only took an hour to make them but I was cleaned up and finished an hour after I started them.  They were easy to mix and the easiest cookies I have ever rolled and cut.  My three year old helped me and we didn't even have any fall apart.  I only gave 4 stars though because as far as flavor they are not spectacular.  I am thinking some orange zest and more spice would jazz them up.

Well, I didn't have molasses, allspice OR cloves!  But I used this recipe anyway.  I used maple syrup instead of the molasses, doubled the cinnamon and crossed my fingers.  They turned out really great!  Of course, they're not really gingerbread cookies, but they were nice and crunchy and easy for the kids to decorate.  I'm sure with the correct ingredients they are wonderful.  The dough was just perfect and got easier to work with as I handled it.  A keeper!  Thanks!

These cookies taste delicious! They're not too sweet and the icing is the perfect touch. I added about 10 drops of food coloring to the royal icing to make different color variations. Then, placed the different colors into plastic baggies. Pushed the icing into one of the corners of the bag and snipped a VERY small hole. This created a cheap piping bag to paint my cookies. They turned out great. My daughter enjoyed helping decorate.

We made these yesterday in a WI blizzard. Wow and Yum! We like g.bread though while it's not usually our 1st choice, we had enough time to make a batch and these were disappearing while we were decorating. I didn't have any problem with them being crunchy, in fact, they were nice and moist. Not too spicy, a mellow flavor but the spice could be upped if you like it that way.

This made an incredibly fragrant Halloween gingerbread house. I let the larger pieces bake a little longer, then let them sit in a 200 degree oven until they felt very firm. This was my first gingerbread house from scratch and I'm very happy with the results. Thanks for the recipe.

The dough is really easy to work with, perfect for cutouts. I have not made the suggested icing, but the cookies work very well with Royal Icing. The small amount of spices make this a very kid-friendly cookie, although more adult tastes prefer it spicier. Nonetheless, these cookies disappear FAST!

I doubled the spice to give them more flavor.  I also had a touch of issue with them rising as much as they do, but once I was aware of that I was able to fix the shapes as they came out of the oven.  Leaving them out on the table overnight allowed them to harden up nicely and the building was a breeze!

A nice recipe. Note that the ginger flavour is fairly mild.  If you are looking for gingerbreaqd with some bite then look for one with more cloves and ginger.  And if you roll it thick it will need longer to cook.

They weren't sweet enough for our tastes - and too crunchy. I didn't use icing, though - that may have helped.

Written as is it's 4 1/2 stars but doubling the spices defiantly made it well over 5 stars. The first batch was good but you could defiantly taste more of the molasses so the second batch I doubled the spices and it was perfect! I used this to make gingerbread houses and they baked perfectly.. they didn't spread at all and since I made them alittle thinner they were nice and crispy. I let the kids eat a few Christmas trees to test them out and they loved them! I'm storing them in brown paper bags in my cabinet till needed. I can't wait to put all the pieces together and have our gingerbread house decorating party in a few weeks!  THANKS

I made these today and they came out great!  The dough, once mixed, is very easy to work with.  NOTE:  To those of you who didn't like the icing: it pretty much is "Royal Icing" i.e. it will dry HARD (great for packing).  I always add a few drops of pure vanilla extract or vanilla/butter/nut flavoring because I don't like the way it tastes by itself.  If you don't want a crispy cookie, then don't roll too thin- these cookies are supposed to be a little "dry".

A great simple base recipe. I tripled the spices, doubled the salt, and used 1/2 c molasses and 2 tbsp water instead of 2/3 cup called for. It was perfect, good flavor and not over the top sweet if you are frosting these. Also used 2 pieces of parchment paper to roll out so I didn't have to add flour to the dough. I rolled mine thin and only baked 6 min. Mmmm, soft and yummy!!

Like several of the other reviewers, I rolled the dough out a bit thicker (about 1/4") and the cookies came out beautifully!  Like one of the other reviewers, I also added more of the clove, cinnamon, ginger and some nutmeg...really spicy and flavourful.  It was an absolutely foolproof recipe and the cookies came out perfectly.  I've always been too terrified to try making gingerbread, but after finding this recipe, I think it will become a tradition.  NB I couldn't find any molasses in the UK, so I used golden syrup and it was absolutely fine.

This dough was easy to work with and the cookies came out chewy but sturdy.  Love the flavor, too, though they do need icing to be sweet enough for my taste. :)

Had to add a bit more flour than the recipe called for (about 1/4 cup) And the flavor left much to be desired.
However, it rolled wonderfully, baked perfectly and was study beyond belief. 
So, all in all if you're looking for a good recipe to use for gingerbread house making this is a good one, but maybe add some more spices (like some of the other reviewers suggested)

Made this for a ginger bread house and it worked perfectly! We made ginger bread men out of the remaining dough. I thought we would just have the decorated men to show with the house, but we couldn't stop eating them! They had really great flavor!

Fabulous recipe!  I used this to create my first homemade gingerbread house (usually just make one from a box!).  I was absolutely amazed at how soft and supple the dough was (so easy to roll out it's ridiculous).  Worked out great and the smell is divine.  Great recipe!  If I ever make another one of these, this is the recipe I'll use.  I also love the rich, dark color of this gingerbread.  Fantastic.

this recipe is really easy to follow so that's what makes it great. i found that rolling the dough thicker made the cookies chewy and not that crunchy. one thing i don't like about this is that the amount of spices used is definitely not enough. the cookies smell great but the taste is rather bland.

I rolled a little thicker for supporting the ginger bread house and it was great. Had a nice spicy flavor... until I put it back int he oven for safe keeping then the oven got pre heated...red hots dripping down the gingerbread house looked like blood. I cut little squares in the house cut outs and crushed up peppermint candy canes and put them in the holes. When everything was done cooking I had wonderful stained glass windows. I highly reccommend that small detail to any gingerbread house!

Very yummy!  The dough is really great, it's just like playdough, so easy to use!  I made a gingerbread house with this, and still be making regular cookies too (lots of dough left!).  I found they're better rolled to about 1/4 inch thick rather than 1/8, that way they turn out soft.  These things smell SOOOO good!  I didn't have allspice or cloves unfortunately, but even without it they taste grand, I'm sure they'd be even better with all the spices!  Wonderful!

Unfortunately, I had no luck with this recipe. It smells like gingerbread but doesn't taste like gingerbread at all! I suppose the amounts of spices need some adjustment. However, I do enjoy the rather cakey texture of the gingerbread cookies, but not the flavor.

The dough was very sticky and I had to put a ton of flour on the board to be able to get the cut-outs off and to even be able to roll it out. I think that you should add more flour to the recipe.

fast and EASY.  I was looking for cookies to hang on the tree. Since taste wasnt priority for me I used margarine, also used my kitchenaid mixer to stir in all of the flour (was also in a hurry, didnt sift flour, just scooped it) dough was perfect for rolling right out of the bowl. fresh from oven cookies were firm enough to handle yet soft enough for me to "re open" the ribbon holes I'd made with a wooden skewer. I got 18 of the 5" gingerbread men. Will use this recipe again-Thanks

This recipe was a little disappointing in the taste category.  The dough was easy to work with, the cookies puffed up perfectly and held their shape well, but the cookies did taste like cardboard!  Kids had a cookie party and we used this recipe and some store bought dough- this one made better looking cookies, but they definitely need quite a bit more spice in them.

Excellent cookie recipe; good moisture for a gingerbread cookie, good dough consistency.

The little icing recipe down below, however, came out to be about 10x too much icing and was also tasteless.  I added two tablespoons of lemon juice and made a little lemon glaze out of it.

I didn't use the allspice just because I was out, and I doubled the cinnamon and ginger.  This dough is so easy to work with. It didn't need to be refrigerated, and I was able to combine the cutout scraps and roll it out a couple more times until there was nothing left.  The baked cookies have a sturdy texture--they held up to my five-year-old's decorating style--but they are not tough or doughy to chew. I will make two batches before our next decorating day. The kids polished off a lot of these before they got any icing on them.

Phenomenal recipe and outcome. The only thing I did "differently" was use sea salt to enhance the flavor (in place of table salt), & I used bakers joy on the cookie sheet because my first few cookies did stick and break. Having freshly ground spices also added to the overall flavor. I am thankful to the owner of this recipe, this is one that will go in my actual recipe box.

This might well be the best classic gingerbread cutout recipe I have ever made.  Careful not to overcook it or they will be crunchy, as one reviewer noted.  If you watch it carefully, however, they are the perfect bite of soft but not crumbly gingerbread.  I use a dark molasses as that is what my family prefers and then a quick buttercream icing on top, instead of the royal icing recipe given.  The dough is nice and firm and can be rolled without refrigerating first, a big bonus when you have kids antsy to get rolling and cutting!  Love it and plan to use it for years to come.  Thank you!

This recipe was easy to follow and turned out great.  We had fun baking these up and decorating the different cutouts.  Followed the recipe and didn't make any modifications. This recipe will stay in the keep pile!

Love this recipe for ginger houses and cut outs.  So easy to work with, no chilling, yet still yummy and not too hard!  ( hint: roll cut outs a little thicker to maintain a soft inside) This is my new go to recipe!  Thanks!

I am giving this 4 out of 5 stars only because the cookies are a little bland as its written. Next time I will take the advice of others and double the spices.  Other than that, its a 5 plus.  The dough is easy to work with.  I made gingerbread men out of mine and they are are soft and have just the right consistency for gingerbread.  I refridgerated mine overnight simply because I was also making sugar cookies and wanted to do them both at the same time.  They turned out amazing! Now I just need to get the grandkids over to decorate them!

Fantastic! The molasses we get in England is like sugar (rather than a liquid), so I used a cup and a half and creamed it with the butter and sugar and they turned out just great. I doubled the spices and found that to be about right. Will definitely make them again.

THE EASIEST WAY TO ROLL OUT ANY COOKIE DOUGH IS TO PLACE THE DOUGH BETWEEN TWO SHEETS OF PLASTIC WRAP. DAMPEN THE COUNTER TOP AND LAY OUT THE FIRST PIECE OF PLASTIC WRAP. FLOUR LIGHTLY, LAY OUT THE COOKIE DOUGH AND TOP WITH THE SECOND PIECE OF PLASTIC WRAP. LESS FLOUR, LESS CALORIES, BETTER TASTING AND VERY LITTLE MESS.  ALSO USING SILPATS ON COOKIE SHEETS IS A MUST!

Easy and a very good Gingerbread cookie!   I think next time I too may add a little extra spice to them and making them a little thicker as other reviews suggest; is the way to go.   My kids loved making these and decorating them.

Even though I doubled the spice for this recipe, the base recipe is terriffic!  We used it to make gingerbread houses as well as cutout cookies.  They don't need chilling, crisp up nicely (we rolled to 1/8"), did not spread, and taste yummy!  Thank you Bradi9!  You made our annual tradition even better!

Besides the spices being doubled, this is the same recipe I use for my 'reduced fat' gingersnaps. The dough really needs to remain refridgerated or it's going to stick. Instead of rolling it out on a floured surface I rolled the dough between some folded wax paper. They were nummy nummy! I found they have more flavor when soft, rather than crisp. Thanks! I'll for sure use this low fat recipe again

Loved this recipe. Easy and quick to make, and very quick to bake - and it made TONS of cookies.
The only problem I had was at the point at which I added the eggs and molasses to the creamed sugar/butter - it caused the butter/sugar mixture to separate horribly, which wasn't ideal. However, as soon as the flour went in it wasn't a problem any longer. The dough was wonderful to work with. I can only imagine those who say it was too dry or too sticky have never made dough before - adding the flour is an art, not an exact science! ;) You have to stop adding flour when you get the right texture! (Doesn't every cook know this?)

I also doubled the amount of spice, and I'm glad I did. The gingerbread is tasty without being overbearing - I can't imagine how bland they might have been with half as much spice.

Will definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks to the author - love it!

Really enjoyed this gingerbread....did not have any difficulty rolling it out, did not stick to the rolling pin or the table.  Made very nice gingerbread men :)
I added a little more cinnamon/ginger and did not have allspice so I used a 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to round out the ginger/cinnamon/cloves.  All in all a very nice gingerbread. I will probably use it next year for a whole gingerbread house. :)

my first time making gingerbread cutouts and I was not disapointed with this recipe. The main reason I chose it was because the dough did not require refridgeration. Came together easy, rolled beautifully.  I kept a careful eye not to over cook the boys...absolutely key in producing soft cookies.  Made icing with icing sugar, milk and vanilla mixed to the right consistency.  I will definitely make this again.

First I would like to say that I really do not bake, that is more for my mom as I prefer cooking.  This is the first time I have ever made gingerbread cookies and I searched everywhere to find a recipe that I assumed would be good.  I chose this one, but followed the advice of many others on here by making small changes to suit my own taste.  I cut the molasses down to 1/3 cup and used 1 tsp of the spices and added 1 tsp of nutmeg.  I have never made icing in my life before and was a bit worried that I would do something wrong, but it turned out perfect.  I let the dough stay in the fridge overnight as I did not have time to actually make, decoarte and clean once the dough was made, and it was so easy to work with.  I cooked the cookies for the full 8 min(I used small cookie cutters too), and the cookies came out perfect.  I was worried about the cookies after making the dough because the molasses gave off a pungent smell that was distastefull to me.  My dad said they were great and the only dessert/treat he likes are chocolate chip cookies.  They are soft too which is a plus but they are not 'cakey'.  Overall it was an A+ in mine and my familys book and we will definantly be making again next year!

This one didn't go so well for me. The dough was not easy to handle and even though I increased the amount of spices by a considerable amount they still weren't that gingery. The overall texture after cooking was good though but we wont use this recipe again.

I made a gingerbread house with a metal mold.  This recipe's dough was rather sticky and prone to air bubbles.  Not great properties for a molded cookie, but in the end it worked out ok.

It tasted really good but I ended up baking it for only 6 minutes. The dough made lots of gingerbread men. I didn't have cloves but they still tasted really ginger-bready

Absoluetly the bomb! I used a version of this to make a gingerbread house for the first time and it turned out spectacular. It made enough dough for the house, plus plenty of men and regular round cookies.

These were the best cookies. The were so easy to roll and cut. The only thing I changed was 5 cups of flour not 4 cups. Also I used baking powder not baking soda.
THEY WERE GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!

These were a disappointment for me. They came out really hard bakes at 8-10 minutes..I changed it to 6 minutes. They were also really tasteless..like cardboard. Will not make them again. Not the nice rich flavor that I am used to with gingerbread cookies.

Loved this recipe! I just tried another posted here that turned out awful and needed chilling and fell to pieces when I rolled. So I gave this one a try. Didn't sift the flour, just dumped it in. And only other change was that I used nutmeg instead of ginger. Will use this recipe over and over again!! Thank you!

I doubled this recipe and took it to school to make with kindergarten and grade 6.  Tasty but not overpowering, chewy and not hard.  Perfect for the kind og cookie I have always looked and hadn't found until now.  I will use this every year from now on.  Thanks a bunch.

Really good other than the dough being a little dry and hard to work with at first.  By the time it had been rolled out a few times, it was better.

My 13 year old son made them without any help.  It's great to have a cut out recipe that didn't require chilling.  The dough was easy to work with and the flavor was great (we were pretty generous with the spices!) We did not make the icing.

I may have done something wrong, but these cookies came out with the taste and texture of dog biscuits.  And the icing had way to much icing sugar and was just too sweet to handle and dried to a concrete finish.

Great texture for building gingerbread houses, but too bland for cookies, even after adding extra spices. Also, if the weather is dry, do not follow the recommendations of others to add a bunch of extra flour.

Very good.  I made several recipes of these and took them to a  Christmas get together at church.  I cut them out with a snowflake cookie cutter, and decorated them in the snow flake pattern using white icing and immediately dipped them in blue sprinkles. Very pretty!  I got a lot of complements on them. One guy said they tasted as good as his mama's. Lol!  I wish I'd taken a photo.  I noticed someone said that their cookies were too hard.  They probably mixed them too much and/or they live in a very dry climate.  If in a dry climate you might want to mix in a few drops of milk.  One other thing is that your oven may need to be checked out to see if it is running too hot.  Get an oven thermometer (can usually find them at grocery stores) and hang it in your oven.  Turn on your oven and when it shows it is the correct temperature check the oven thermometer and see if there is a discrepancy.   Adjust your oven according to the difference.  That should fix the hard cookies problem.

Did not reach my expectations. Taste was bland, not enough spices. Also dry texture... Will go back to my original gingerbread cookie recipe.

First time making a gingerbread house from scratch (all the kits were sold out!) and this was surprisingly easier than expected. Recipe's straightforward. I learned a lot of things along the way. Building the foundation ahead of time (day before?) makes decorating it so much better. Also, put all the icing into a bag/bags so that it doesn't dry up. Bookmarked this - thank you!

I prefer mine with a tad bit more “bite” and the instructions should say roll to 1/4 inch, but they turned out wonderfully and those two are personal preferences rather than anything wrong with the recipe. They come out soft if you take them out at 8 minutes.

I found the dough difficult to work with and the cookies were soft and very dry.  Followed the recipe except doubled the ginger and cinnamon.  I am still on the hunt for that perfect rolled gingerbread recipe

I made a double recipe of this dough and it was very easy to work with and the cookies came out a consistency that was both edible and easy to decorate - made about 4 dozen medium sized cut-out cookies.  After reading a lot of other reviews, I doubled all the spices I put in and they were all fresh and flavorful, and it still seemed a little bland to me.  I saved them by adding ginger and cinnamon to the royal icing glaze, but next time I would probably put 3-4 times the amount of spices called for in this recipe.  Roll with parchment paper underneath and on top and then just pull out the inbetween sections and re-roll it.  Very very easy to do.

Great recipe, but as others mentioned, it definitely needed more spice. I about doubled the spices and it turned out great. The suggested thickness was a little thin too--I went with about 1/4"-1/6" inch and it turned out nice and soft in the center with crispier edges. It's a little sticky, but I don't think it needs more flour, just be cognizant of it while you're working with the dough ad rolling it out. Overall quite nice, and the frosting came out great too!

Great cookie! I cooked them a bit thicker b/c I like them soft and they were still sturdy enough to make a house! The dough was enough to make a small house and about a dozen large cookie cut outs. Will definitely keep for future use. :D 

I didn't make the icing, and I did add extra spice (cinnamon/ginger and a dash of nutmeg) for personal preference.

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/23073/classic-gingerbread-cutouts/ ... 1 6 17  Very slight changes:  half white, half brown sugar; only 1/4t cloves.  These kept their shape pretty well, but flavorwise, kinda bland - as in spice & sweetness.  I tried the between-wax-paper suggestion & it wasn't pretty, but it was better than the straight on-counter-alternative.  ''Wished I'd added more flour first - before chilling.  It didn't seem sticky in the bowl, but it was when attempting cutouts.  I didn't make the frosting.  Three days later review:  These got soft - too soft for a house, in my opinion; but baking longer would easily "fix" that.  E, 19, gave a thumbs up so I'm upping from three to four stars.  I got frustrated with the stickiness of the dough so made "ropes" then pretzels, snakes, hearts, letters.

This recipe is perfect for Gingerbread Houses! My tips: For construction quality gingerbread, bake these on the long side of the recommended time. They came out a touch soft when I did the average bake time, but add a minute or too, and they were perfectly sturdy. That being said, this recipe is a touch under seasoned for just plain Gingerbread Cookies. I'd add a bit more sugar and spice if I was going to just be making edible gingerbread men. Also, I'd bake them on the underside of the recommended time if you want to eat them like cookies. All in all, a great recipe that I will definitely use again!!

I used this recipe, not for eating, but for building a gingerbread house - so my review is based on that (not for flavor). I made 1-1/2 batches, which yielded me enough dough for 9" x 7" x 9" gingerbread house with a chimney, shutters, gabled roof with covered front door porch (see my picture for details). I had a little bit of dough left over (probably enough for 3-4 gingerbread men). A couple of tips, if using this for a gingerbread house: 1) You will need to add a lot more flour to the dough, to get it to be workable. I kneaded in flour by hand until it was not sticky. 2) Divide the dough into 3-4 pieces, and roll out directly on a well floured piece of parchment paper. I put a kitchen towel down, flipped my 1/4 sheet pan upside down onto the kitchen towel (so you have the flat side up), then put the parchment on top and rolled the dough out right on there. You can just put the baking sheet right into the oven like that (upside down). 3) flour the top of your dough slightly before placing your template on top (or your template might stick!) 4) Cut out your shapes and remove the excess dough from between, which can be re-rolled again. You only need to leave about an inch between pieces, as the dough doesn't spread that much. 5) I pulverized lemon drops in my spice grinder and used that for the windows. Just fill the window spaces with the lemon dust, and it will melt and create a stained glass windows. 6) Let all pieces cool completely on the parchment paper before removing

Cut this in half just to make a few cookies for kid's class thing. The dough is like crack ... really good. Mixed it up, it was very soft. Added a little extra flour, rolled it out, cut out some owls, baked them 9 minutes. Cannot wait to decorate them and eat them!

The only change I made was using 1/3 c of maple syrup in place of 1/3 of molasses (ran out). Rolled out to 1/4 because we prefer soft to crunchy cookies.
They turned out really cake-like in texture and quite bland. Frosting is a must. Would probably be great with your coffee, but definitely not a 'centerpiece' for your cookie platter.
If you like mild, cakey cookies, this is for you.

I made this once before, and all went well. This time, I'm having to chill the dough in order for it to be rollable.



Last time, I omitted the cloves and added nutmeg and cardamom.

This was my first attempt at making my own gingerbread house from scratch.  I doubled the spices and it was delicious.  I made it pretty thick and cooked it almost twice as long (it was almost 1/2" thick when done) so it wouldn't be too soft. The royal frosting was perfect.  All my worries about how it would set up were for naught -the house stood perfectly with just the frosting and set-up nicely.  Using the icing in a zip-lock bag with the corner cut was a breeze - so much fun!  My 5 and 7-year-old and 5-year-old friend had a blast putting candy all over it and have since had more fun eating it. I can hardly wait until next year to make it again! (I also can't wait to get over this cold so I can taste again - this was really yummy!)

Good recipe, rolled out well and didn't stick. I doubled the spices as was suggested. Will use again.

I've made this a few Christmases now and each time I have to hide the cookies when they're done or else I won't get any. This comes off a soft, cake like cookie, especially if you roll it thick enough. I highly recommend using the parchment trick (rolling out your dough between two pieces of parchment). I found that if I did that, I could easily get the dough cut, put on a cookie sheet, baked, and transferred off without any issues. The only problem I have had is around Christmas time I get never ending questions from my wife, friends, and co-workers about when gingerbread time starts.

This is a great recipe! I actually needed a bit more flour, but the consistency of the dough was beautiful. I used the template on the site for the house, and prematurely did a few cut outs and was left using scraps for the roof. But I was able to make it work. Over all, its easy and very tasty! Even for non-molasses likers.

I picked this recipe because it looked fairly simple, and it called for butter instead of shortening. Overall, not bad at all. I would, however, recommend at least doubling the spices. I doubled them, but next time I make gingerbread cookies, I will probably add a bit more. I also recommend letting the dough 'rest' in the refrigerator for a bit before rolling out to cookies. Baked up nice.

These were good, moderately soft, gingerbread cookies that went over very well with our family, young and old.  I rolled them a little thicker, as I like a softer cookie.  I would probably use powdered sugar for the rolling next time, to make a slightly sweeter cookie.

These made a soft, chewy gingerbread cookie, it balances out the hard royal icing used to decorate them.

Made a double batch to create my very first gingerbread house, a Hallowe'en themed one from scratch. Was pretty painless except when my roof wouldn't stay up but a little rearranging and viola, a scary edible centrepiece!

Makes a great gingerbread house even if I am not a big fan of the flavor.

Great recipe! I made gingerbread men as well as my first gingerbread house with this recipe,and both turned out great! You do have to be careful with the flour,as it can make them kind of dry,but that was my fault,and they were still good. The icing recipe is incredible,tastes great,and stuck my gingerbread house together no problem! I was very nervous about doing the house,but this recipe made it a breeze,thanks for posting!

I followed the exact recipe. I will NOT bake these again. I had to add more more flour than the recipe calls for and had to ensure enough flour on rolling surface as dough tended to get stuck. The end result was bland and tasteless. I have put them in an airtight container and will wait a couple of days to see if they taste better. Maybe icing sugar will asisst the taste somewhat hopefully

i made this last christmas, it was easy to make but it did not have enough spices in it so when i made them the second  time i doubled up on the spices, and ginger, ok i didn't just double i added a hell lot more, and i couldn't get molasses so i used a mixture of treacle and maple syrup. the cookie came out great everyone loved it and and the icing once again was easy to make and worked well for me.

Great Dough but a bit boring of a cookie.  Do Not make more than a single batch.

I didn't make the recommended icing. The cookies came out a bit dry and didn't have a strong ginger flavor like I would have liked - perhaps the next time I might add more spices than recommended.
