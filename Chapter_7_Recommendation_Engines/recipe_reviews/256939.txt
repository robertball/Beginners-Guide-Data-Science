i am a beginner vegetarian...off meats for sure but still have fish so working on it...but this was an alternative to try...i think that it barely tasted like bacon...its eggplant so yeah, its not Grandma's bacon...i also noticed the more i burned it the more it tasted like bacon...i like my bacon crispy so i just made sure the eggplant really blackened and it gave it that bacon taste...once u put this on a sandwich you probably will have a hard time knowing its not bacon if you wore a blind fold...

I love his stuff.. I did let it marinate in the fridge for quite awhile as I ran out of time to make it.  No harm though..I tried ooking it as per the recipe and it came out fine.  I will say the two step cooking process was kind of long so half I tried just baking. for longer than the time stated and it came out fine that way too.   I will be eating this for lunch today... It doesnt taste exactly like bacon, but its a tasty sub that captures a bit of the taste

It was a little spicy for me but that’s my personal taste. I will make it again but adjust for my taste. Thank you.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was a bit too spicey for my family so I will cut back on the spice. I found this burned too easily so I am working on a few changes: careful not to cut too thin, add the brown sugar later in the process, since it's the sugar that actually burns. I am also lowering the temperature to 200 and keeping in the oven longer. Wish I had a food dehydrator. I used a new vegetable peeler which 
Are makes vegetable "ribbons" to get really thin pieces. It made pieces too thin to handle properly.  It wasn't a complete loss. Those pieces became little "crumbles". Also working on substituting zucchini for eggplant,

Tried this for the second time today and it came out perfect.  I used a mandolin this time and sliced really thin, plus I removed the skin because that part was hard to chew.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out awesome.

I'm sorry, I didn't think this tasted anything like the flavor bacon should have and took a really really long time to dry it out. And yes, I have cooked with eggplant before.
