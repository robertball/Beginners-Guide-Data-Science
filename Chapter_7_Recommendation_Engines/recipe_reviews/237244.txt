I tried this recipe yesterday since I don't use gluten and am always looking for new gluten-free recipes.
This recipe was simple to make and amazingly good.  You have to like the flavor of plantains though.  I love it!
I made it this time with green plantains, which have a more savory flavor.  I also added a little bit of garlic powder.
The next time I make this recipe, I will try it with ripe plantains and I bet it will also be good, only sweeter.  Ripe plantains are very sweet.
Depending on how you cut it, you can use it in different ways.  Thank you AlliS for this recipe!

Super easy to make but for some reason we couldn't get it "dry" enough.  We used a yellow plantain so there was more banana taste than a green one might have had.  Used recipe as stated.  It wasn't bad and we will try it again.  Have been doing a paleo lifestyle the last week and it has been very satisfying.  The recipes from this site have been helpful and added to the ones I am using from a book I purchased.

Great base recipe. You can tweak as needed. I added cinnamon and honey to the batter and topped with nut butter once done...my picky eaters gobbled it up. Perfect for those carb craving moments.

This is my favorite paleo bread so far. I especially like the sweetness from the plantains when they are really ripe.  So easy to make.

We thought this was "ok":   for the health benefits of not eating flour bread, this is a good alternative.  I seasoned what I made with garlic powder, salt, and sesame seeds on top prior to baking.  I also baked the bread for about 20 minutes, as opposed to 15 minutes.   Drawback I found its only good the first day.  Next day, this lost its attraction for me.  Won't make it again.

The texture is amazing, looks like bread, and has a slightly tangy taste. You could do a lot with this. Best part is how easy it is to make.

I just made this and it's perfect for a snack with a teaspoon of almond butter or even as a dessert.  It relieves the cravings for carbs as well as the sweets. ??

I loved how easy this recipe was, I hate spending a lot of time in the kitchen and this is super easy and quick!  There are so many instances on the Paleo diet when you just need something to be the bread!  Sandwiches or burgers, bread+cheese+wine, toast with breakfast, bread to dip in your soup.  It works, and is quite versatile.  It's great with a little Chevrie goat cheese for those who allow goat cheese!

It is a soft bread, like a pancake. I poured it out thin and cut it into 3 x 4 inch portions. I immediately thought it would be nice for a peanut butter and jam sandwich. I used ripe plantains so the bread is on the sweeter side.

I have made this recipe several times. I made it as is, and it was very good. However, I can never leave anything be so I added my own touches and doubled the recipe. I added a teaspoon of: basil, oregano, thyme, a tablespoon of garlic powder and white sesame seeds, salt and pepper to taste. I also added 3/4 cup of almond flour and used peanut oil instead of vegetable or olive. Yummy!

A little too sweet for me. I used 1/2 tsp of salt and unfortunately couldn't find any green plantains like the others suggested. If I was strictly on the Paleo diet I feel like this would satisfy me. I was very impressed with how easy it was to make. I ended up using my blender as I discovered I lost my food processor parts and it worked just fine. Try it with almond butter (salt and sugar free almond butter). It was perfect because it cut the sweetness.
