These were very tasty! i used chicken breast because it's what i had. i cut them into strips. i did miss a step though. the double coating. i dipped in egg mixture then in the crumbs and onto the baking rack. Perhaps if i hadn't of missed that step they would have come out crunchier.  I enjoyed these very much and will pay more attention to the instructions next time, cuz there will be a next time!
