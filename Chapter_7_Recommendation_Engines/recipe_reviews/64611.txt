If I could give this six stars somehow, I would. This was terrific. I added some more yellow squash and zucchini than the recipe called for, used diced tomatoes with garlic and used a chicken bouillon cube. I also used double black beans instead of the kidneys and added cumin. I didn't have a slow cooker, so I cooked this on the stove for two hours at a very low temperature. This is a filling meal and very healthy. Thanks for the recipe. I am definately sharing this with others.

This is the way I've made chili for years with the addition of the two types of squash.  I also add a tablespoon of ground cumin as I love that flavor.  My husband and I have been on the South Beach Diet for the past two months and this fits right in!  We love it!  BTW, the South Beach Diet has been VERY successful for us as we've lost a total of almost 40 pounds!

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet, since I've made it four times! (Anyone who only likes "meat and bean" chilis... find another recipe, please!) I leave the zucchini and summer squash in big chunks, use half broth / half beer in place of the plain water, and simmer this is the crock pot all day. The kids eat it up topped with shredded cheese and with scoop-style tortilla chips. I've even eaten this chili cold the next day - it is SO DELICIOUS! This is a 10-star chili, for sure.

The is a fabulous recipe with a few additions to taste.  substituting a beer and chicken broth for the water is a great idea of one reviewer.  then add a chicken bouillon cube, 1 tsp each of poultry seasoning, cayenne, oregano, cumin, a clove of minced garlic and ground pepper to taste. Dynamite!

I made this both as a vegetarian version (for guests) and non-vegetarian (with turkey). Both were excellent. Changes I made were: added a beer and broth (vegetable or chicken, depending on verison) for liquid instead of water and boullian. Added garlic and several spices, about a teaspoon of cumin, oregano, and cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp of white pepper. Finally, put in a small head of broccoli, chopped, which added a little texture.

My family loved this recipe.  I also took it to a sick friend and she said it was the best chili she has ever had.  I did make some adjustments.  I didn't pre-cook anything but the turkey...I just threw it all in the crockpot.  I doubled the recipe, but with one less can of beans and one extra can of diced tomatoes.  I added a can of tomato paste and two cloves of garlic, minced.  I also added a tsp each of cayenne & chili powder.  Delicious and healthy!

The only vegetables in this recipe that I had on hand that I used was the zucchini, and still could've done without them, according to my husband.  Great recipe, but without the vegetables! Thank you!:)

This has become my favorite winter recipie.  It is so filling and tasty.  I use dried beans and rehydrate them over night.  Then I throw everything in the slow cooker on low and come home to delicious chili

This recipe was pretty good, though it was a little bland, so i added some seasonings:   minced garlic, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, oregano, cumin and some sugar (all to taste).   After adding these seasonings, it was *FABULOUS*.  :D

I had to adjust this recipe to what I had.  I didn't use the bouillion granules or black beans, and instead of water, I added a can of spicy tomato juice. Also added some cumin.  Pretty good!

Absolutely wonderful!  I've made this twice and it taste even better the next day.  I added extra corn and poured it over Fritos with lot's of cheese.  I also suggest using seasoned tomatoes for extra flavor like mexican style.  This recipe will get you compliments.

I made this without the zucchini and the squash and it was still really good.  I didn't have time for the crockpot, so I just let it simmer on the stove for awhile.  I'm sure if this simmered in the crockpot all day it would have been more flavorfull.

This was yummy - after I made some changes.  I did not use the carrots, peppers, zucchini or squash.. my family likes their chile with bean and meat. I used a can of Rotel (toms and chiles) instead of diced toms. I also poured in a can of chicken broth and 1/2 water instead of 3 cups of water.  Once everything was in crockpot I added garlic powder, poultry seasoning and salt in addition to the other spices.  
I will make it again and again.

This chili is delicious! I substituted "Smart Ground" a soy ground for the turkey, and added frozen peas. It was just great!
