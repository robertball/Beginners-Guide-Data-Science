I thought this was wonderful.  It came out juicy (despite the scoring) and tender.  This was part of the same cut of meat I used for another recipe, and that one did not come out juicy and tender.  I let it marinate for quite a few hours.  From reading the other reviews... I'd have to say I understand why lots of people would find this salty but unfortunately I happen to be a salt addict.  Plus I love the tanginess of soy sauce.  So if you like tangy, this is great.  If you don't, this is probably not your recipe.  And probably your average person should cut down on the salt.
Every once in a while I find it necessary to add certain comments:  ZeroCreature (an apt name), not that you'll ever see this, but you are quite insulting and egotistical.  Do people not have the right to just plain not like a recipe w/out your permission or insulting opinion about it?  There are at least 2 expert cooks who gave this a 1 or 2, and I'm quite sure they know their behind from a hole in the ground.

This was soooo good and easy the longer you let it sit the better.  I used an already tenderized steak, That made it even better.  I was getting a little sick of the sauce and gravy thing this was a great change of pace.

I would use a little less salt for my own taste. Will try it with sirloin next time I make it.

Finding a marinade that will make steak tasty enough and tender enough for my father to eat it without complaint - in fact, with high praise! - is impossible. Or so I thought! I used this base with some modification - I used three cloves of garlic sent through a press (we like things smelly and delicious around here!), a cup of homemade tomato sauce, and Italian seasoning blend instead of just oregano. I also made it a wet marinade (with the full cup of sauce) instead of a wet rub and kept it in a Ziploc in the fridge for about four hours before broiling it. Dad compared it to the Outback... I'll take it!

Wow, this was good.  We raise our own beef and after years of not liking the tougher round steak, I've found the recipe to make it into a favorite.  It was very tender and favorful.  Would possibly reduce salt and I did dab on some oil prior to grilling.  This perhaps made the rub a little more saucy as well as keep it from sticking.

For those who think this recipe is too salty: it's probably your brand of soy sauce.  Go with low sodium soy sauce, or find one that is balanced to your tastes.  Cheap, crappy soy sauce is often very salty.  It's one of those things you simply can NOT skimp on.  This recipe is quite good if you know your behind from a hole in the ground about the ingredients.

This was very, very good.  Didn't really score the meat but did marinade for about 24hrs.  After reading some of the reviews I didn't add all the salt only about a 1t. but I guess it all depends on how much meat you are using.  Didn't come out saltly, just perfect.  My whole family enjoyed it and like I've said before on other reviews, my 5yr old son is very picking and he asked for seconds.

Besides being way to salty, this steak reminded me of sausage which I do not like either.  I was very disappointed with this recipie.  Too bad because it was so easy to make.  After taking one bite, my family decided to have pizza instead.

This is a great recipe.  I thought the round steak would be tough, but it was good.  My kids even ate this. I have even left the tomato paste off when I didn't have it and it was still good.

It was ok.  I should have used a better cut of meat.  If I make it again, I will use less tomato paste.

My steak came out rather chewy and dry, and I don't feel I overcooked it.  There wasn't any real taste to it either.  I'll try another marinade.

this was not too bad but it could of had a lot more flavor. IF i were to make this again i would double or triple the marinade. i also wish user would of included how long to broil it. i have never cooked this kind of meat before nor could i find anything through Google. i had to kind of guess.

I didn't like the taste very well, I think that it was simply too tart tasting.  My husband tasted it and asked me if it was something "healthy" because he didn't like it very much! I think that it would taste better if cooked on a charcoal grill, I grilled it indoors.

Would definately make again.  I used celery salt in place of the oregano and dehydrated garlic instead of cloves.  It was great med. rare.

This was a tasty marniade but a little salty to our liking. Next time I would omit the salt and use a less sodium soy sauce.

I thought this recipe was really good.  Instead of soy sauce though I used worshire sauce.  It did seem to make the steak a little tough. Next time I dont think I will let it marinate as long.  But over all it was really good and my boyfriend asked for more; that's always a good sign. :-)

Simply the best steak I've ever eaten. The marinade is very tasty. I don't see how people can say it has no real taste. I left mine to marinate 24 hours, perhaps that's the difference... Then I BBQ'd it.

I used this recipe with Elk steak instead of beef (hunter's wife). It was pretty good but the venison marinade I make is much better, even for beef.

A great alternative for round steak.  I was surprised how much my kids liked it, since it's a bit spicy.

My family LOVES this steak. I either add 1/2 tsp meat tenderizer to rub mixture or sprinkle over steaks after scoring, before rub is applied. My picky eater scarfs it and asks for more. Good enough for company on a budget. Great recipe.

Best recipe for round steak I have ever tried.  It came out tender.    I marinated before work (8 AM) and cooked when I came home at 5:30 PM.  Tried as is, no subs.

Very easy, something different, hubby loved it. Marinated sirloin overnight in a large ziplock baggie. I broiled them until they were pink and very warm in middle. As for the salt, I did not add any salt and used Low Sodium soy sauce, Kikkoman Tamari is a good one. I can't wait to try these on a grill next season. Served them with butter-sauteed mushrooms and a salad. Yum!

This turned out pretty good, and I liked the simplicity.
I used V-8, about a cup or so,  instead of the tomato paste. I was concerned about it being too salty but left out too much salt.  Next time it will be even better when I have the right amount of salt.

i was looking forward to this recipe. The taste was good. But I have no experience with broiling. This recipe doesn't give you the temperature at which to set the broiler. So started low, the got to reading cook at a high degree, my steak ended up tuff and over cooked. I think if this had the degree at which to broil the steak, the steak would have been successful. 1 whole round steak, wasted.

I accidentally purchased round steak and wanted to find a recipe to broil it. I really enjoyed this recipe. I did a few things different only because it was what I was working with and it still was delicious. I cut the salt in half, used olive oil and added a bit extra, extra garlic, a pinch of sugar to balance and tomato basil Marinara sauce (super basic light sauce) instead on tomato paste. I left in overnight in a ziplock bag. I made it 2x now and I learned to crack the broiler a little bit open and cook it 9-10 mins for a nice texture. Very easy to make and flavorful!

This is my Go-to Recipe for company, but I have learned a few things to make it more to our liking:
-scoring is very important
-use better cuts of meat, get 1-inch thick steaks & double the batch of rub when for company
-MASH garlic into the salt thoroughly (mortar & pestle or Sturdy tablespoon in a bowl)
-I use 3 large garlic cloves, but we are major garlic fans
-use less salt
-use more oregano
-The soy sauce you use makes a huge difference (find one that isn't too salty, I use Tamari)
-incredible difference between grill & cooking in house.  Charcoal grill is BEST.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Grilled it over gas and the flavor was wonderful.  Will be making this again and plan to use it on other cuts of beef.

This just did not work for us. I think the rub/marinade may be OK but the cut of meat did it no justice. We will not be trying this one again.
