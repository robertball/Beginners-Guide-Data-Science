Very tasty! I used red potatoes and left the skins on instead of peeling them. I did need to cook the cabbage and onions longer than stated to soften them. I added a bit more salt and pepper, as well. This was a very satisfying side dish for our St. Patrick's Day dinner.

Made tonight to go with corned beef.  Very good.  i did not have cream cheese so used a mix of sour cream and plain yogurt...healthier and still delicious.  You do need to add a healthy amount of salt for flavor but turned out great.

These were so good.  Only thing is I blended 1/2 of the cabbage/onion mixture so my husband and 3 year old would not get scared from the cabbage.

Loved it!  Mashed potatoes and cabbage go so well together in many different dishes, and it works great in this one.  The little bit of cream cheese just gives it a nice, creamy texture.  Served this with  'Braised Corned Beef Brisket' 'Buttermilk Slaw' and 'Irresistible Irish Soda Bread' all AR recipes.

Fabulous! What a great use of cabbage, and a wonderful alternative to mashed potatoes. We made this as a side dish for grilled salmon, and it was an amazing meal. One note: we did have to bake the colcannon longer than recommended, because the top didn't brown in 30 minutes.

I think I prefer this over mashed potatoes. It has to be less calories ,less carbs and wonderful flavor!

A real crowd pleaser!  Don't tell them it has cabbage in it, and they'll never know.  I used leeks instead of onions and like the extra color for St. Patrick's Day.  I will be serving this instead of mashed potatoes from now on since it is much healthier.

This was absolutely fabulous!  My Irish grandmother used to make colcannon and it really brought back great memories to eat this comforting dish.  It did need a hefty dose of salt and I found that mine needed about 45 minutes in the oven to brown properly.  Aside from those two little tweaks, I wouldn't change a thing.

This is scrumptious.  I made this just for my husband and myself and at the end of the meal there wasn't enough left for lunch the following day.  We love all the ingredients in this dish and combined they were magnifique!  Thank you for this lovely recipe.  I do believe you could pair it with any meat.  We ate it with the chicken with caper sauce from allrecipes. For most, not a good combination, for us, quite heavenly.

It was good. I too didn't have cream cheese so I used a generous amount of sour cream and that worked out well.

This is SO good. I did tweak it. I cooked the veggies in chicken broth. I used 1 [1 lb] potato and a half a head of cauliflower. I did a rough mash of them with 3T of butter, 4 oz of light cream cheese, and ~1/3 cup of the broth in which I boiled the veggies. I did everything the night before, except baking the colcannon. I took it out of the fridge ~30 minutes before putting it in the oven to bake, while I prepped my soda bread. I am so excited to have another potato, and the rest of the cauliflower, cabbage, and cream cheese to make it again!

We thought that this dish would be really good, but we were not keen on it. It was rather bland-tasting, and I won't add 'a hefty dose of salt' to anything to add flavour. Not a keeper.

Made this as a side for our Easter dinner and it was a hit.  (My sister asked for the recipe.) I used small red potatoes which I left whole and unpeeled.  I added some cooked chopped bacon before baking in it.  Great side dish!

I didn't think it had much flavor, but three others at the meal liked it.
