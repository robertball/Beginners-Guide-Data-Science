I overhauled it with butter and half and half, took out the evaporated milk.  I give it points for giving me the idea!  Mine turned out AWESOME!

I made a few changes, added butter (as recommended from the other reviews) and used 2% milk as I did not have any evaporated milk.  Used extra bacon (cause all the kids like bacon) and everyone loved it.  All had to have second helpings.

I cut the recipe in half and used 2 medium sized Russet potatoes (in my mind, baked potatoes are Russets).  I left the skin on and followed the recipe.  The ingredients list says that the green onion quantity will be divided but the instructions only say to sprinkle them on top.  I mixed some into the potatoes and left some for the top.  I can't say I was overwhelmed with this recipe.  I think it really needed some butter.  I had to sprinkle quite a bit of salt on my portion to make it edible.

This was a total hit! I made a few changes because I didn't want to go to the store... I used 10 regular russet potatoes, cubed them up with the skin on & mixed with some of the sauce before pouring them into a greased dish. Then I poured the remaining sauce on top & covered the dish with aluminum foil...I baked them at 350° for 45 minutes then removed the foil, topped with some more shredded chedder, chopped green onions & crispy crumbled bacon. Popped them back in the oven for an additional 15 minutes to brown the top & there was not one bite left! Excellent side dish for our tri tip steak & pork loin (I cook for 15+ on Sunday's) This will be in our dinner rotation forever!

There is a BBQ joint near my house that takes a baked potato and puts all the classic loaded stuff on top of it.  THEN they top that with shredded smoked pork, BBQ sauce and french-fried onions. SO...I made this casserole.  Then before putting on the last layer of cheese, I topped it with homemade pulled pork, shoestring onions, BBG sauce and then cheese and baked an additional 15 minutes. OMG folks went gaga at my club event!

I liked this recipe as a BASE FOR MY OWN CHANGES AND ADDITIONS.  Halved the recipe,  added butter and slightly more than one quarter cup of sour cream to 4 baked potatoes which I did in the microwave to save time.  Certainly a good recipe to make your own,  Thanks!

5 Star recipe! I have to admit I modified it. I substituted half and half for the evaporated milk.  Also added cream cheese and butter. Healthy no delicious yes.. nice part is you can add or subtract what you want and how much of each ingredient you want.

My favorite to take to parties!  The only thing I substitute is the evaporated milk.  I use cheddar cheese soup instead.  Layer everything in a crock pot.  Turn on high for 4 hours, stirring once every hour.  Voila!

This was a winner with the kiddos!  I followed fellow reviewer's advice and left the skin on my yukons, used whole milk instead of evaporated because that's what avoided a trip to the market, added butter and a smidge of garlic and topped with full pack of bacon because who doesn't love bacon?...rest of recipe remained the same.  Perfection!  Will make again and again.

I made the recommended changes as well (2% milk and butter), I also mixed some of the bacon and green onion into the potatoes. And for a little extra zip, I added some grated Swiss cheese. Definitely a make again dish.

Good recipe and concept. I halved the recipe because I didn't need so much, and added a half a stick of butter and it turned out really great and fed my family of four perfectly. I cut the baking time a little and it was still great!

I love this recipe! I changed the 10 Yukon potatoes to 6 Russet potatoes. We also used skim milk instead of evaporated milk and about 3 tablespoons of butter when mashing!

My whole family loved this. Just made it to go with steak for Valentine's dinner. I thought the evaporated milk gave it a lovely consistency. I used 4 Idaho potatoes and no green onions. I didn't have Yukons or green onions. I think this is a great dish for a potluck or as part of a meal to take to a friend.

This was easy and very tasty.  I did use more cheese but otherwise followed the recipe.  I cooked and mashed the potatoes and assembled the casserole ahead of time and put into fridge for a couple of hours until wanted to bake it.

This was a hit at our Christmas dinner!  Everyone loved it, and there were no leftovers.  I used 12 potatoes,  a cup of sour cream, a pound of bacon, I also added 1 1/4 cube of butter regular milk instead of canned milk, and extra cheese. Will definitely make this again!

Definitely a keeper recipe!  I did make a change: reduced the amount of potatoes by half, but left all other ingredient volumes the same, and substituted half and half for the evaporated milk.  Great tasting, nice texture and very aesthetically pleasing because of the colors.  Will certainly make again.

I had a large amount of leftover mashed potatoes to do something with and found this recipe and decided to try and use it . I added a little milk and lots of bacon bits, cheese, some chopped onions, sour cream and seasonings. I froze most of it and just baked a small amount for our dinner. I took the rest to our family get together and baked it there. It was a great hit at our thanksgiving dinner, Did not have to worry about it being left over. It disappeared quickly.

This was pretty easy and absolutely delicious. I made a few changes based on what I had available, but it’d take a lot mess up this recipe! We added extra bacon, some seasoning, milk instead of cream, and didn’t mash, but cubed the potatoes. Next time I’ll probably mash a couple to mix in that some of that yummy sauce a little better, then pour the rest over the top, then top with the bacon, cheese and some chives. There’s so much you could add to this recipe to make it your own, but it’s awesome for sure! My family knocked it out!

Great recipe! I used 4 oz cream cheese in the potato mixture. My granddaughter has a "thing" about melted cheese. She likes cheese, just not melted. I sprinkled cheese on most of the casserole (I left her a cheese-less corner) I used a sprinkle of chives instead of green onions. It's what I had on hand. Very versatile and delicious recipe! Will make again!

so good. definitely add butter though. I added half a stick. I also only needed a half cup of milk. i used whole milk though. added extra bacon and cheese on top. for those who said it had no flavor, did you season it? some garlic salt and pepper gave it the extra bit of flavor the potatoes needed. will make again and again! my husband went for thirds it was so good.

This recipe was delicious!  All of the flavors were excellent and a great balance of taste.  My husband and 3-year-old went back for seconds!  I did alter the recipe a little.  I did not have evaporated milk, so I used regular whole milk.  Also, I did real bacon bits from the jar (to spare my time cooking real bacon) and that turned out great too!  So, if you need to make in a hurry, I do admit the "real" bacon bits in a jar work just as fine.  I will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

Since it's just my husband and myself, I basically cut the recipe in half.  Like the others, I also added some butter; I eyeballed the cheese, using sharp cheddar.  Actually, I supervised while my husband made this dish.  I was recovering from hip replacement surgery, and I knew making a dish like this would make him feel really good about his abilities.  He felt so good about himself, I should have made a whole recipe.  I barely finished mine, looked around and it was all gone! Thanks for sharing such a tasty and easy dish.
