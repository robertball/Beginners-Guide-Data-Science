Really easy and good! The only modification I made was a trick I've learned over the years about fish. I cook the fish about 1/3 to 1/4 less the usual time, then remove from heat, cover and let sit for at least 15 minutes (even a 1/2 hour). The fish stays warm enough and it gets juicier over time and doesn't dry out.

Easy, fast & very tasty.  I used sole as fresh perch are nearly impossible to get here.  This is one of those meals that comes together in a snap.

Very simple, but very good.  While the breading seems very plain, the browned butter does give it a good flavor, though we did add a little dried parsley to the breading.  We found the amount of breading called for in the recipe to be far more than what is needed.  Doubling the fish and cutting the amount of flour in half (leaving the peppers full amount, but reducing the salt) still left us with enough for another day (frozen in a zip-top bag).

Very simple and tasty. My husband loves perch and I was tired of just breading and frying-will use this recipe again.

This is the way I usually cook perch, but I often substitute something else for flour, like panko, quinoa flour, cornmeal, etc. All good! Use real butter.

Loved it! Quick and easy. Our neighbors provide us with fish from Lake Erie. This was as close as it gets to the fabulous fresh perch we have had at Kelleys Island. I used red pepper flakes, as one contributor recommended. Yum!

Easy to make! Great recipe when you are running out of time to make dinner! I was really short on time so I paired this brown butter perch up with brown rice and garlic toast with cheese. It was a warm,  satisfying meal.

Easy to make with a nice flavor for perch.  We followed the recipe but added a teaspoon of Old Bay.  It may have been the first time my wife ever had perch.  She enjoyed it as did I with just a touch of tarter sauce.

Made it ! Love it! I thing I changed was to deep fry it instead of using 2 tablespoon butter. The fish kept curling up and wasnâ€™t frying the fish properly when I used butter.

I donâ€™t usually make perch but I wanted a change from the usual.  This was easy and quick to make and very tasty.  I just wish I had taken off the skin before cooking the fish because the fillets curled up when cooking, making it a bit of a challenge to strip off the skin.  But, a nice, light meal.

I have been making a similar recipe for years! Make no mistake about it there is a HUGE difference between Lake Perch and ocean perch! And in my opinion Lake perch especiall,y yellow Lake Perch from Lake Michigan is the tastiest! Thanks for sharing your recipe it is so good! Like another reviewer said adding some Old Bay just a tiny bit adds a nice flavor!

Loved the brown butter method.  We really like Ocean Perch because it has a sweeter taste, are about twice as large as fresh water perch and cost less than fresh water variety. ($3.25 per lbs.)  We usually fry our fish Creole style but the brown butter is now in the rotation.

I agree with many others that browning the butter takes this dish up a few notches. I made it twice, once omitting the butter for olive oil. I will be making it again in the future with, yes, brown butter.

I followed the remaining directions  and this dish is a keeper.

Fabulous, and THE only way to eat Perch!  I even used gluten free flour.  If making more than one "batch", you may need to use additional butter.  I may try a combo of butter and oil next time.  LOVE the video, Chef John!

I used Mrs Dash Lemon Pepper seasoning instead of salt. It was very tasty and easy to prepare.

Excellent and easy! The browned butter gives the fish a slightly sweet nutty flavor. I'll definitely make perch using this method again.

I gave it four stars because it was so easy to make.  It would have received five stars with more seasoning.

I may try  adding a little something extra as others have suggested for flavor, but the overall  recipe was great. Fish were moist with nice texture, and the butter idea is much better in my opinion than using other oils.

I cut back on the cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon since I don't like it so strong. My family loved the perch and this recipe. I recommend it to everyone. I also browned my fish a bit more with the butter. Yum!

We used this recipe for whiting fish caught 2 hours before while surf fishing.  Warning:  Go easy on the salt when using fish caught from the ocean, let people salt their fish themselves.  Usually, no salt is necessary.  Other than that, this recipe was spot on!

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  I used Panko instead of flour and served with rice, steamed broccoli and a salad.  My husband loved it!

I used lemon pepper instead of salt and pepper in the flour mixture because I had no fresh lemon and it was a hit with the family because it was so tasty and a hit with me because it was quick and easy. Will definitely make again.

Yum, definitely no leftovers.  I used fresh caught canadian perch.  The cooked fish was flaky, light, and subtly flavorful (I didn't have cayenne).  The recipe took no time at all, much faster than recipes that call for a separate egg wash.  I paired with sautÃ©ed yellow squash, red bell pepper, and sweet onion, and a crusty bread.

Easy and delicious. It was my first time buying some perch. I had stuck perch in the freezer, not knowing what to do with it until I stumbled unto this recipe. I added about a spoonful of brown sugar. It has great, and you also taste that delicate flavor of the perch. So good! Going to buy some more perch.
