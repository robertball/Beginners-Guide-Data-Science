This was surprising DELICIOUS. The photo doesn't look appetizing but trust me, it's a brilliant idea to combine salmon, potatoes, and a cream sauce. A few things I added to enhance the flavors which were a little garlic and onion powder, and a pinch of parsley. I added a good amount of sea salt and black pepper and then a 1/4 cup of crushed butter crackers on top for a bit of crunch. I recommend using red or golden potatoes as they add to the buttery-ness of the whole dish. We all loved this - comfort food indeed.

Flaked fresh salmon instead of canned. Just cook the potatoes until al dente and hit the dish with pepper before you put the parmesan spread on top.

The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because of a mistake I made. The recipe calls for precooking the potatoes & I did not. I make a potatoes au gratin dish that is almost identical to this so I thought I could take a short cut, as that recipe does not require precooking. However, after being in the oven on 375 for 2 hrs, the potatoes still weren't cooked! But the main objection I have to this recipe is that after waiting all that time to eat the dish, it wasn't even good! I don't know if it was the mayo sauce poured over, something is clearly wrong with this recipe.

We loved it!  I sprinkled some salt over the top. I added some fresh mushrooms to the milk mixture.  This one is a keeper!

I made this recipe last night for dinner. It was a great surprise be I did not know what to expect. This is a really good recipe. Be careful not to over cook the potatoes.

The surprise is that it is actually good. My 22 month old loved it and ate all that I gave her. Your kitchen will smell very fishy afterwords though. Would love to come up with a fresh salmon version.

This recipe was pretty good.  I would change a few things if I make it again.  I would make double the topping, I would put a teaspoon of salt in the sauce, and I might add a pinch of spice.  The way the recipe was, it was so bland.  I used fresh salmon, so maybe that's where the salt went...  Canned salmon probably has higher sodium.  One thing I can say with certainty...  It needs more topping!  I want to taste that parmesan I grated!  It's a good flavor!  Then again, maybe my taste-buds are broken.  It just wasn't flavorful enough for me as is.

And how salted is "salted water" for boiling the potatoes in?  A pinch?  A quarter cup?  The directions were a little vague.
