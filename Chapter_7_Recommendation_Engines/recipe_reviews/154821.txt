These didn't taste bad, but definitely not the "maid-rites" I was expecting. Maid-rites aren't supposed to be saucey as I know them. If these were called "Sloppy Joe's" I would give them a much better rating.

Really excellent flavor! I did increase the proportions of sauce ingredients because it was not as juicy as I liked. Several dashes of garlic powder (after tasting as is) made it perfect!

Immediate Hit!  Little resemblence to real Maid-Rites but a fantastic sandwich. Even better the next day.  Must use mini buns to make 16 sandwiches.

This is quick and very good.  I halved the recipe, since I only had a pound of hamburger, and followed the recipe exactly.  I got just a small taste, as they were eaten up very quickly!  Very sloppy joe-like, but different from the Manwich I typically use for a quick meal.  Thanks Kendra :)  ***UPDATE***  I made these again tonight, and once again, I only had one pound of hamburger.  However, I forgot to halve the rest of the ingredients, and they still turned out great!  Since they were extra sloppy, we used the potato chips I had made to go with it as scoops.  This leads me to believe this would be great over mashed potatoes or wide noodles, for a nice change from buns :)

These were a nice change of pace from sloppy joes, but I don't know that anyone in my house would ever request them since my son didn't like them and my husband and daughter didn't say anything.    I liked that the ingredients are something I always have on hand, but I had to almost double the sauce ingredients.  When I got to the simmering part the meat tasted a little bland and was so void of liquid it wouldn't hold together.  Afraid of it burning while it sat there for 20 minutes I threw in some more of each ingredient and added some garlic powder as well.  I would make this again if I needed something to throw together, but I don't find myself serving it to company or adding it to my cooking repertoire on a regular basis.

These sandwiches were good!  Also very quick and easy, and made with ingredients that I have on hand...  I used bison meat, and it worked well.  In the instructions, "simmer" seemed a bit misleading to me.  In my version there was very little liquid.  So I just turned the burner down low for a few minutes after adding the ingredients.  (So I made them even more quickly than I'd expected.)

I made these with one pound of ground chicken. I made the whole batch of sauce because I wasn't paying attention, but I think that was a good mistake to make. This is great on English muffins.

Great recipe.  I never heard them called "Maid-Rite" sandwiches.  We call them Sloppy Joes.

This recipe looks exactly like what we called (in Iowa schools) taverns and how my mom used to make them.  I haven't tried the recipe yet, but I'm willing to bet it'll take me back.  Thank you!!

This was a great little sandwich. It was similar to a sloppy joe without all the tomato saucey taste and spices. My husband said he liked this better than a sloppy joe sandwich and even went back for seconds. It was a bit dry though starting out so I added some beef broth and let it simmer until the liquid was gone, twenty minutes. No other changes. I'd eat this again, it was pretty good.

This was the absolute easiest and yummiest thing. I didn't use ground beef instead I used ground buffalo.  Mmmmm..buffalo, the healthy alternative to red meat.

Very good recipe - easy and delicious. I added a little chili powder and a dash of cayenne to spice it up, and honey dijon insead of regular mustard, but easy, easy, easy to do any number of variations, or good as is!

Looking for a recipe that is quick, easy and you will have all the ingredients on hand?  THIS IS IT!!!  There is no need to change it up.  My husband couldn't get enough of it and ate it on potato chips when we ran out of buns.  These sandwiches are DEE-LISH!

Didn't  change a thing!  The sandwiches were delicious and not saucey at all.  The meat absorbs all the sauce and is super flavorful. I did put it in my crock pot to keep it warm since we are eating at different times today. Yum!  I will make this again.

As I was making this, I realized that it was the exact same ingredients I use in my sloppy joe recipe, just not as much.  It was a good sandwich but I wouldn't call it a maid-rite.

Awesome simple recipe!  I was looking for something quick for supper last night and came across this recipe, 15 minutes, DONE!  I did follow the suggestion of one reviewer and used a packet of beefy onion soup instead of the chopped onion (to save time) and added some garlic salt.  It really hit the spot and I will be making it again.  Thanks Kendra!

I only used 1 pound of hamburger and kept the rest of the ingredients at the normal amounts (so twice as much sauce as would be normal) and it was GREAT!  LOVE the flavor!  They're not quite "Maid Rites" but they are similar and even more delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly (other than doubling the sauce).

Made these for a group of people working hard on a Saturday helping my daughter build their new home.  Thumbs up from everyone!  They were delicious, easy to make since all of the ingredients are pretty standard in any cupboard and great to keep in a crock pot all day for anybody to come back and get some more.  Highly recommend!

FABULOUS! I made only one change: apple cider vinegar rather than distilled white vinegar.  Midwesterners love this regional specialty, and this is the best-tasting "Maid-Rite" I've ever had!  TIP: Make a huge pot of this stuff and freeze it in family-sized portions for a quick, delicious meal and a night off for the cook.

These were okay.  It reminded me of the canned Mamwich/Sloppy Joe stuff which Im not a huge fan of.  The rest of the family liked it so I may make it again just not very often.

We spend a LOT of time in Iowa and this is not the traditional Maid Rite.  If you like sloppy joes, this is closer to that.  Find the recipe that uses chicken gumbo soup for the closest version of this Iowa classic

The recipe was decent enough, but it is a sloppy joe, NOT a Maid-Rite. If it had been labled correctly, I probably would have given it a higher rating.

I didn't know how to rate this because it definitely is NOT anything like a Maid Rite sandwich but it is really good. So I rated it based on what they are calling it, and it truly isn't a Maid Rite. It is a delicious version of a sloppy joe though! So 5 stars if that was what they were calling it.

I had a few friends and family over for a gender reveal and thought this would be a quick and tasty recipe. My husband made it in about 10 minutes and it was a huge hit! I'm not big on leftovers, but we had enough left for a couple of nights and ate every single bite. I will definitely make this a regular dish in our household. We just used all of the normal hamburger toppings and buns and they were so good. My parents are from Iowa and said these aren't like typical maid rites, but I think they had way more flavor.

Awesome recipe!!! I made these for a family that had just lost a loved one. They loved them and I was even asked for the recipe!!

I doubled the recipe so I'd have some and took a maid rite to work for a couple of days.

This will be are cope that I go to again!! 

I didn't find them soupy at all as Erin wrote in her review. I used lean meat and had no problem.

These are the best sloppy joes...My kids love that they don't have peppers in them. They are easy to make & I usually have everything on hand. Super delicious!

I have looked for a good recipe for maidrites and haven't found one that is spot on, until now! I added a  couple of cloves of minced garlic and some chopped green pepper. Perfect! My husband raved! Thank you for sharing, Kendra!!

I used this recipe for my first time EVER making maid-rite/sloppy joe sandwiches.  They turned out well and tasted great.  After reading some of the other reviews, I doubled the sauce and added garlic powder as well, so they were really juicy.  I needed a fork to finish mine because the bun was soggy!  We made these for all the crew that helps us put up hay in the summertime, and it was a hit!  Thanks Kendra!

My mom's been making this since I was a little girl!  The only difference is that she uses a packet of onion soup mix and some water instead of the chopped fresh onion.  So quick and easy and CHEAP but tasty.

I've never had a Maid-Rite in my life, and had never even heard of such a thing until this recipe! I honestly didn't even know that it was a restaurant until googling it just now. I've never lived in an area that had one! Hope to try one someday. Anyway, I enjoyed this recipe, although I wish the meat came out a little juicier. I only used 1 lb of beef, therefore I halved all the other ingredients. Next time I will take another reviewer's advice and not half anything, because that will keep the meat jucier, like I wanted. Also, I stirred all the sauces/sugar/vinegar, etc into a bowl first, then poured that whole combined mixture over the meat. Very tasty, great flavor!
