Preparation was easy.  Added croutons because...what Caesar Salad doesn't have croutons?  Besides, I had to use them up.  If you want to make this a really solid appetizer/side then use a good Caesar dressing, or better yet, make it yourself.  As written, it could have used some serious jazzing up with fresh lemon and black pepper.  Glad I added the croutons, they were missing a huge crunch.  Would I make these again?  A solid maybe.
