This was a very easy recipe to make and tastey as well.  I took the advice of others and doubled the apples, which made it very thick, but good.  Almost bread like.  I omitted the nuts as no one at my house likes nuts. Was moist and the icing was good, not too sweet, as canned icing can be.  Next time I would add more cinnamon and maybe more vanilla next time for extra flavor, but I would make again.

This was really tasty- but I wish someone would have mentioned how QUICKLY the cake browns on top. I kept taking it out because I thought it was going to burn on top, but apparently it's normal, because it tasted great. I will try it again, now that I know I don't have to watch it so closely.

I have made this recipe three times now and everyone: co-workers, husband,and even my mother-in-law loved it.  It is sooo easy.  You can use any fruit pie filling and the recipe comes out wonderful.  The only item I varied was baking time.  When using a glass baking dish I've baked this cake for 40 - 45 min.

This was excellent!  It was unbelievably fast & easy to make.  The recipe didn't say to keep it in the fridge, but I did once I iced it because of the cream cheese.  And then I served it right out of the fridge- very yummy with coffee & tea.  The icing makes this cake. A definate keeper.

I was looking to make a dessert that would satisfy my craving for sweet but only use ingredients I had on hand.  This worked perfectly.  I didn't have the frosting ingredients so I sprinkled it with powdered sugar- mmmmmm.... it was just right!  I especially loved that it wasn't too sweet or rich.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was very rich and yummy.  I didn't use 2 cans of pie filling like some suggested because I didn't have any.  But I did add 1/3 oil to help with the moistness.  I know there was already a whole stick of butter in there, but I did it anyway and I was glad I did.  It turned out very moist and flavorful.  I also upped the cinnamon a little because I really like to taste it.  Also, for the icing I was craving the Caramel Frosting IV from this website and it turned out so rich and delicious.  I'm sure the other icing is great too...I will use that kind next time.

Holy  this cake recipe is insanely good. I added more cinnamon and vanilla in the cake and the frosting called for and turned them into cupcakes and they taste like apple pie but in cake form. Definitely going to make this again.

I added raspberry pie filling, omitted the nuts, and topped it with a mock whipped cream frosting.  The nuts would be a good addition for the next time I make it.  The cake was so moist it was almost wet, my family loved it.  It was very rich and very sweet.

Not sure about this cake...it got mixed reviews.  My brother didn't like the frosting, but I and several others of my family recognized that the frosting was the only thing that saved the cake.  It's worth the trouble to make a nice layer cake, not something like this.

I didn't have any apple pie filling, so subbed peach pie filling instead. Cake is very moist & very good! I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site. Thought the recipe for frosting from this recipe looked like it would turn out way too sweet. Took to work & had nothing but rave reviews.

I totally forgot to add the butter, and it was still AMAZING!  I used home canned apple pie filling- an entire quart.

Super yummy!  Not too sweet, the cake was moist and delicious.  I did not have the ingredients for the frosting, so served it with cool whip instead.  I also did not have walnuts - substituted with sliced almonds, which turned out great.

Very easy and very moist! Did recipe exactly as listed and it turned out great. Didn't do frosting (my family doesn't like frosting), instead just put some whipped topping on top. Really quick and easy.

VERY moist cake, very delicious...let cool completely though (was more moist that way).  Didn't try the icing (also left the nuts out of the recipe)...the cake is great by itself.  Baked in glass pan for 45 minutes and worked great.  Definitely a repeat for my house.

Excellent and different, definitely a keeper! Texture is something between a banana bread and a cake, with a subtle apple pie flavor.  I made it as directed, with just one can of pie filling and a touch more cream cheese in the frosting, and baked in a 9 x 13 pan.  It was slightly overdone at the edges at 1 hour, so next time I'll try 55 mins.  I may try more cinnamon and 2 cans of filling to see the difference, but it was awesome as written.  Tasted great cold from the fridge the next day or with coffee, too.

This recipe was a very big winner in my house.  My husband is not much for cake, but he loved it and said it was one of the best that he has ever had.  I did do a few things different though, instead of stirring the ingredients together I put them in a stand mixer on about medium speed, I also didn't use nuts or the icing.  I used blueberry pie filling instead of apple and left out the cinnamon, baked it for about 45 min. in a glass pan.  when it was done I sprinkled sugar on the top and put it in the broiler for about 2-3 min. and then let it cool for about 15 min. before cutting it.  Needless to say the cake was gone within a matter of hours.  I will be making this recipe again & again.

I've been looking for a good dump cake recipe that doesn't rely on a cake mix and this is it. It is easy and gets rave reviews each time I make it. I usually opt for a pineapple cake instead of using apple pie filling. Simply use a can of crushed pineapple in place of the pie filling. Also, I omit the butter from the icing so it is not so rich. It still comes out creamy and delicius.

This was good.  I made it exactly as the recipe states, no surprises!  It reminded us a bit of carrot cake.

My second time around, I wanted to make cupcakes (muffins?)  I wouldn't recommend doing this for this recipe.  Even though I greased the heck out of the muffin tin, they wouldn't stay in one piece to come out of the tin.  They're fairly sticky (and still delicious).  My solution was to flip them over and frost the bottoms so that there was something solid for them to stand on!

I had to reduce the cooking time by 10 minutes because it was getting too brown at edges, served it warm from the oven with vanilla ice cream (no need to frost).  It isn't the type of dump cake I expected but still good - almost a banana-bread consistency and color.  Would be good with coffee at brunch.

Delicious as it is.  I didn't change a thing except that I reduced the bake time because it appeared to be baking a bit too quickly when baked in a glass dish.  
I must admit that I was concerned about the amount of sugar, but when it was baked it didn't taste overly sweet.  
This is one of the best recipes in my collection now, and I've been baking for over 40 years.  
Oh, and one other thing---this cake tastes so good and was so well loved by my family that I had to give it another name.  It's just too special to call a Dump Cake! :)

I never use apple pie filling so I substituted 4 medium diced apples.  I put the frosting on, but found I like it better without.  It just seemed too sweet.  The frosting is awesome and I'll definitely use it on something else.

Absolutely delicious.  This is a variation of a recipe my family has been using for decades.  The only change we make is to double the cinnamon and omit the icing.  I sometimes substitute a half recipe of the Apple Spice Mix found on this website, if I want to spice it up just a bit.

We LOVED this cake.  I had only a short time to come up with a dessert and wanted to use ingredients I had handy.  Sooo, I used a raspberry pie filling instead of apple.  I also used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white flour.  Another substitution was 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  The cake turned out perfectly.  I baked it in a Pampered Chef 13x9 baker and it made the sides a little crunchy which we liked.  The walnuts actually made the cake taste a little more like a sweet bread than cake.  But it was delicious.  The FROSTING was absolutely perfect the way the recipe called for.  I going to use it now for my standard in frosting.  It was so easy, made just enough and cheaper than store bought.

Thanks so much for submitting this recipe.  We really enjoyed it and so did our guests.

Very nice and earns what I call the "Nelly award"...my term for recipes both extremely delicious and extremely easy in honor of a dear lady whose cooking talents are second to none.  I didn't use apple pie filling as I didn't have any (and don't really care for the canned variety) so I used a can of pineapple with a couple hefty tablespoons of apple jelly, then added a half cup or so of coconut and subbed vanilla for cinnamon.  What surprised me was that it was almost universally well liked.  I thought it would appeal more to a select few with the changes I made.  Go figure.

This was surprisingly good, and VERY sweet- I might cut back on the sugar next time.  I used a can of strawberry pie filling and extra cinnamon, and it was so moist and sweet it did not need icing.  A great recipe to experiment with!

This recipe was great - super moist, and the frosting was just sweet enough.  I didn't add the nuts since I was serving it to kids, and it was still delicious.  I also only put in 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and no one complained about it not being sweet enough.  Thanks for an easy recipe!

Took this cake to a pot luck last night and it really got the compliments and requests for the recipe.  I forgot to put in the baking soda and eliminated the salt and the cake tasted fine.  This is a "will do again and again!" cake.

This was a really interesting cake, especially with the addition of whipped cream on the side! It's a little heavy, but we thought that was a good thing. I gave it a crunchy topping by sprinkling demerara sugar on the top before baking, rather than making up the icing (didn't have any cream cheese at home!)

I didn’t add Walnuts due to possible allergies with the guests but it didn’t make/break this recipe. Absolutely moist and a huge it. The frosting may have been a bit too sweet for the cake as the cake is quite sweet itself. Next time I’ll skip the frosting and maybe make a crumble topping instead. And leftover cake was Perfect with morning coffee ??????

This is absolutely delicious.  I didn't use the icing because I was serving the cake at a brunch function and it didn't seem necessary.  It was moist and the hit of the event.  I will definitely make it again!  About three people wanted the recipe.

This is an actual dump cake. It doesn't matter the order of ingredients- just beat it all together! Thank you for the recipe. I top it with Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting also from this site.

Good cake, but not really a "Dump" cake.  'Dumping' the ingredients into a bowl and mixing, is the way I make all my cakes... unless they are a "Dump" cake.  Dump cakes generally involve putting a one or two things like fruit, nuts or chocolate in the bottom of a pan, pouring or "Dumping" a commercial cake mix on top of the 1st ingredients and baking.  I gave it a 3 star rating because it really isn't a Dump cake, in my opinion.

Easy Peasy. Didn't change the cake recipe at all and it turned out great. Very moist, and much like a spice cake. I look forward to trying it out with other pie fillings. 
I didn't make the icing - I just lightly sprinkled it with powdered sugar. The family loved it. I may try a brown sugar crumble topping next time as well.

5 stars for super easy and yummy.  I used veg oil instead of butter, and lite cherry pie filling.  My family is weird and does not like cream cheese frosting, so I made vanilla glaze which was good, but not as good as the cream cheese frosting would have been!
