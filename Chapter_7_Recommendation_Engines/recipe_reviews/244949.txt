1-26-2016 ~CHEATER ALERT!  The submitter remarks that this is a good way to "Add some oomph to those boring mashed potatoes!" but I confess my potatoes weren't boring to begin with since I used leftover twice-baked potatoes from a very nice steakhouse.  So instead of starting with just some boring boiled potatoes, I simply mashed my leftover potatoes that included  applewood bacon, white cheddar and parmesan cheese.  I slipped them out of the skin, mashed them up and, to guarantee they became crispy and brown, I fried them in clarified butter. These were so darned good I'd make them again, and in exactly the same way.  They're worth ordering this potato again (or using your own leftovers) just to make this recipe.

We've done something similar for years to use left over mashed potatoes. The one change we make is to form the leftovers into individual patties about the size of a hamburger. We fry both sides and serve them with a fried egg for breakfast. Add a few strips of bacon (or even fry the patties in bacon grease) and you've got yourself one heck of a delicious and filling breakfast.

This recipe is a great jumping off point, but I found it to be lacking in flavor. It definitely needed more butter and more seasonings. I added freshly cracked black pepper, more garlic powder, chives, and Himalayan pink salt. 
As written, I would have given this three stars. 
Love this method though for changing up plain ol' potatoes.

These were very good.  I use left over mashed potatoes added green onions, salt pepper and garlic powder.  We enjoyed them.

I actually made it with half cauliflower and half potatoes. I let the mixture chill overnight and pan fried in the morning. Topped it off with cheddar, greek yogurt and scallions. Yummy!
