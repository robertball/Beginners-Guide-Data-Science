I took a real chance and made this for the first time on Christmas day for 14 people. I increased the amounts of everything by 50%, except that I used 8oz cream cheese.  It was the hit of the party.  I think some of my relatives liked it better than the prime beef tenderloin roast!  As someone else said, this will change the mind of anyone who thinks they don't like broccoli.  One of the best, if not THE best, side dish I've found on Allrecipes.com

Absolutely the creamiest, richest most delicious dish! Excellent as a side dish, but definitely good enough to eat on its own. Yum!

Delicious, but very rich.  If someone likes creamy & rich dishes but not broccoli, this just might get them to eat broccoli, it is so good.

great. did make a few minor changes. sauteed onion with olive oil and garlic.  did not steam broccoli b/c I do not like it too mushy.  also added a few dashes of smoked paparika to add some subtle flavor.  will make again.

I could not help but compare this to my traditoinal broccoli casserole, which my family enjoys but does not devour like they did this recipe. I have made this many times and have subsituted sliced onions or shallots in place of pearl onions with the same great results.

Very good....however, I used only 3/4 bag of pearl onions, as that's all I had, and it was still very onion-y. Pearl onions are my favorite but it was a little overwhelming. When I passed this onto my girlfriend I advised her to use about half a bag of onions. Also, I think there needs to be more cream cheese to make enough sauce to cover the ingredients; a little more cheddar wouldn't hurt either; and 2 tblspn of butter didn't work for me with the 1 cup of bread crumbs. I had a lot of dry crumbs that just sat there or flaked off. This really is tasty, and I will certainly make it again, but with the above modifications.

I scaled this to two servings, putting the cheese throughout the casserole instead of just on top.  I assembled it in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated it.  I didn’t add the bread crumbs until just before baking.  I baked my little casserole uncovered, because I wanted my bread crumbs to brown, for 30 minutes.  Well, that turned out to be a mistake because it turned out dry, not saucy like I had hoped.  I won’t take any stars away due to my error.  I’ll try this again, baking it covered, to see if I get better results.

My family did not like this at all. We love broccli and onions but the onions were just too much in this.

Very very good!!  I added a little extra cream cheese and a little less butter.  Also had to use a large red onion because I didn't have any pearl onions.  My hubby loved it!!  Can't wait to share the recipe!

I have served this recipe (or something very similar) for Thanksgiving / Christmas dinners for years and it is always a big hit!  My cookbooks are packed so I was exceptionally happy to see this recipe here!
