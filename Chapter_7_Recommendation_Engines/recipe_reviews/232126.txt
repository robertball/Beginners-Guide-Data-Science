I posted this recipe and it looks like admin changed it up a bit.  For the dressing I always use equal parts honey, seasoned rice vinegar and olive oil.  That makes it so easy to adjust to a smaller or larger salad.  If I'm making a small batch maybe just a quarter cup of each.  for larger salads (or if I'm making extras to keep for another day) I sometimes make it with a full cup of each.  Keep it simple :)  Also the water in my kale (if I've just washed it)waters down the dressing a bit anyway.

Really enjoyed this. Kale by nature has a tougher texture than traditional salad lettuce and the walnuts really stood up to the heartiness of the leaf. It's also not the best tasting leaf in the world so the sweetness of the grapes and the dressing worked so well. Feta added the saltiness and voila! You have a terrific salad that is oh so good for you. Thanks Kristie for the keeper!

Wow, this is a new favorite!  A friend gave me some kale and not being that familiar with it, I went looking for a way to use it, and came up with this recipe.  I already had Honey Garlic Vinaigrette by DAWNER119 (also on this site) made up and in the refrigerator, so I used that as my dressing, rather than the one indicated in this recipe.  The only other change I made was to use toasted almonds instead of walnuts.  I cut the kale into about 1/4” strips and tossed it with the dressing.  I then sprinkled on the grapes, feta and almonds.  It was delicious and one we’ll be enjoying again!  Thank you!

Made this to take to a dinner gathering.  When people heard it was kale they were skeptical, but in the end everyone seemed to really enjoy it.  Other than cleaning the kale it was very easy to prepare.  I made a few small variations (1) I toasted the walnuts to bring out their flavor (2) I used blue agave nectar instead of honey.  Though it is no better for you than honey, to me it is more neutral than honey and lends sweetness while letting other flavors come through and I did do equal parts of the liquids in the dressing per the author's review of this recipe and I only added a little shot of water but wished I hadn't done that and (3) I added quite a bit of fresh ground pepper and a little salt to the dressing, that was good, it didn't need more.  Next time I would probably try a softer goat cheese as one of the other reviewers did.  Seems like it would add a nice creaminess that was lacking with the feta.  Great recipe, thank you!

love love love this for many reasons---massage the kale briefly with olive oil and 1 tsp salt--softens the texture and improves taste of kale.

This is a most flexible recipe!  I have added shredded carrots, sunflower seeds, substituted cran riasins amd raisins for the grapes, added pecans in addition to the walnuts.  I even fed it to boy scouts who grudgingly loved it!  I served it on a legendary bicycle tour and had to hand out the recipe.  Go for it, folks.  This will make you famous AND well fed.

This is so delish and so quick and easy!  Definitely one for our regular rotation! The dressing is light and a little bit sweet and the perfect balance for the bitterness of the kale.  I tossed the dressing on the salad and left it for about 30 minutes to soften the kale a bit.  I served with grilled sesame ginger salmon on top.

I didn't have grapes, so I used 2 Fuji apples cut in very small cubes and some sliced cucumber cut in quarters.  For the dressing just added 2 ounces of each; rice vinegar, olive oil and agave syrup (didn't have honey either, it turned out FANTASTIC!!!!

This was delicious! It's so filling and easy to make. I didn't toast my walnuts and it was fine. I just wish the vinegar wasn't so overpowering though. I would love to make it again.

A very simple yet tasty recipe. I used pecans since that was on the shelf & followed the same as another viewer by using equal parts honey and rice vinegar... then about half that of olive oil. Was tasty and critiqued well at the party.  :)

Loved this! I toasted the walnuts and used goat cheese instead of feta. So delicious! My husband thought it was a little strong of vinegar, but he's sensitive to that flavor. I thought it was perfect. Had leftovers the following day for lunch and it was a bit mushy, but the flavors had mingled even better and mellowed a bit. I topped mine with grilled/smoked chicken and it made a delicious summery meal.

I didn't have any grapes so I cut up an apple. Didn't have any liquid honey so I used Agave syrup. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter for 2 servings and polished that off all by myself for dinner. Quick, easy and so good!

Took to Easter. I loved the taste. The left overs didn't get as soggy as other salads and the taste was still great. Ate to the very last crumb.

I made this for the first time today, for lunch.  I was OK with it at the beginning, but I found myself liking it more and more with each bite.  I think it's the red grapes that make this salad so tasty!  Went back for seconds, which I rarely do for salad.  Thanks for posting!

Fantastic, especially to be so healthy! :)  And ever better after it sits overnight.  The dressing is wonderful and could be used on a variety of salads.  Think I'll add an apple or two next time just to up the healthy quotient.  P.S.  I thought I couldn't stand kale no matter what, but am happy to know I was wrong. Thank you, Kristie!

This is  fantastic! I'm having company for lunch today and needed a kale salad recipe since I had no lettuce, only kale. I did not have feta, but used goat cheese, crumbled, instead. Also, I added a few dried cherries and cranberries. Looking forward to serving it today!

I used mixed baby kales and added salt & pepper to dressing.  We enjoyed the sweet and saltiness of this salad.
