This recipe was really good. I would make one change in the future I cut the dressing down to half cup.

These flavors are wonderful together.  The second time I tried it I used crumbled bleu cheese instead of dressing and it was even better.

I made this a while back "my way" and it was delicious (see review, below). Last week, I made it according to the recipe as presented (using sliced Harvard beets which  I halved and Miracle Whip as the "creamy dressing") and it was excellent. 

*************

First review:
I LOVE beets. So I made this (kind of) last night for lunch today. I say kind of because, instead of fresh apples, I used 4 heaping Tbsp. of unsweetened Applesauce to coat the beets (mine were sliced, rather than diced) and instead of "creamy salad dressing", I used my own buttermilk/sour cream based dressing. I also included a handful of sliced yellow onion and a handful of sliced green grapes. To my mind, the walnuts (I used pre-packaged, chopped) "made" the dish. I think this is a REAL KEEPER -- especially if allowed to chill and "meld" for at least 4 hours.

I have been making beet salad for years but have never put the apples or walnuts in it....instead of overpowering the taste of the beets with a dressing, I use just a small amount of mayo with garlic, and onion powder.....great recipe, thanks.

In fairness let me say that a) I don't like beets (I was trying to use up some canned beets I tried feeding to my son) and b) I used a bacon ranch dressing which I don't recommend.  If you like beets and use a regular ranch dressing I bet you will like this.  But I also didn't care for the soft beets intertwined with the crunchy nuts and apples.

I really like beets, but this recipe was pretty bland. I used fresh beets and plain yogurt instead of mayo. I  added a shredded carrot for a little different flavor and some freshly squeezed lemon juice to try to add more zest.

My husband gave this rating and I agreed with him.  Kind of like a waldorf salad, but purplish after it sits overnight in the frig!  I used fresh beets that I cooked myself instead of canned ones. Next time I will try the blue cheese addition as another viewer suggested because we love that too.

This salad was a hit at Mother's Day. We found it refreshing and a perfect side to the grilled chicken.  We used just enough vinaigrette dressing to coat to give this a pickled flavor.

I LOVE BEETS!  But I didn't like this recipe.  I used a half cup of Honey Dijon salad dressing and maybe it wasn't thick enough.  Also, I didn't really like the combination of crunchy with the soft beets.... and I didn't like that my apples turned pink.

I LOVED this salad! I don't care for beets but am trying to add them to my diet. This was a great choice. It's just like a Waldorf salad (sub the beets for the celery). I used green apples for more color. My family and guests really liked this as well.

Im only giving it 2 stars because this recipe is way better with plain yogurt instead of the mayo.  Way healthier too.

Not my favorite.  Too heavy of a mayo taste without much seasonings.  Definitely prefer a balsamic base.
