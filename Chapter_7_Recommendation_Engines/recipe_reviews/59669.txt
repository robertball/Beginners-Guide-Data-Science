Reading a number of recipe complaints about soupy pie. Over cooking corn starch will loose it ability to thicken. Do not overboil!

I made this pie for my mom and stepfather they really liked it after it had been refrigerated overnight. They had tried at room temperature but said it was better colder. Also after having read about all the "soupy" pies from other cooks I mixed flour, cornstarch, and baking cocoa together, no problems with soupiness perfect consistency. Also topped with a chocolate meringue to tie in the baking cocoa in the pie.

This tasted good but even with the cornstarch it didn't set and was as soupy as could be. I wouldn't make this again :(

good taste, but way too runny.    If I make it again, I would add more cornstarch or a couple of tablespoons of tapioca.

This pie is now one of my favorites! I had no corn starch so I used flour instead, it came out a bit runnier than it was probably supposed to. I also added a drop of purple coloring to the meringue. We simply loved it!

I thought this was way too sweet. My guests didn't really comment while eating this. Eh.. don't think I'll be making this again.. even if I decide to cut down on the sugar.

More like blueberry soup. Maybe I need more cornstarch, but it did not set-up at all. Good flavor so we put it over vanilla ice cream.

This pie was good, but I personally thought the cinnamon was too much. Next time I will omit the cinnamon. But the berries & meringue combination was wonderful!!! Definitely worth baking.
