This picture is misleading.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was PURPLE because of the 1/2 cup red wine.  It tasted totally fruity and the off color

I used stew meat in this recipe as it was cheaper. I upped the onion and garlic (whole large chopped onion, several cloves of minced garlic) and because I had Campbell's Beef Broth, which is double strength, I used just one 10.5 oz. can. Because I had stew meat, after the broth and wine had been added to the skillet, I brought it up to a boil and then covered it almost totally (I wanted it to be able to vent, so the sauce could reduce) and let it simmer for a little over an hour. I then added the sour cream. This turned out really well but we all thought it had a little too much wine. The color really was off-putting and the wine flavor was really prounounced over everything else. I think this would be just right with half the amount of wine and a little more spice. Maybe some oregano and basil?

this was a delicious dinner.  I made it while my parents were down visiting.  It was a hit.  I used a combo of fresh mushrooms and some canned mushrooms.  It was very tasty w/ no leftovers!

I made this recipe exactly as written. I think I know what is the problem with this recipe (other than it is purple). The prominent flavor is not beef. The beef flavor is lacking. Add that to the less then appealing color, and it just doesn't work.

This recipe was good; I subbed ground beef because that was what I had on hand, and decided not to use red wine but rather cream sherry, after reading reviews.  I also decided to put the sauce together a little differently, making a roux first and adding the sour cream at the end as I am used to doing with stroganoff.

We love Stroganoff and this is my favorite recipe.  The red wine really makes it.  It also freezes well.

This didn't taste much like the stroganoffs I'm used to. I usually love to cook with wine, which is why I tried this recipe, but it was overpowering and possibly out of place.

I found this recipe absolutely wonderful! I've cooked for many years at a restaurant. The only thing I can say about the purple thing. Is what purple thing??. I'm betting they either bought red wine vinegar instead of dry red cooking wine or they didn't boil the mixture of wine and broth long enough. A patron said this was heavenly!!!

This may not be typical stroganoff with the red wine, and I think you might want to tone it down depending on who you are fixing it for. I also added 1/2 tsp. Emeril's seasoning which I keep made in my cupboard. It was a great hit with my son, who is very picky about mixed flavor things (just likes most things barbequed) and my husband.  My grown son went as far as to say "this is the BEST food I've ever eaten! I'm not sure about that, but it's still nice to hear!

This is a classic Stroganoff recipe. Can't believe people are complaining that RED wine made the dish purple... use a white wine if you don't like the color. There really isn't much to change about this recipe, maybe more onions. It is what it is, Beef Stroganoff and the recipe doesn't stray from that.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I used Beef Tenderloin, olive oil in place of vegetable oil, Marsala cooking wine, increased the onion to 1/4 cup and the garlic to 1 Tbsp (I love onion and garlic), added some salt and pepper.  It is the best Beef Stroganoff recipe I've ever used!

really liked the sauce with the red wine.  Didn't have garlic, but I don't think it made a big difference.  I use Tones beef base with water, which I think has less sodium and tastes great. I buy it at Sams club. I also chopped up a medium size onion--instead of 2 tbls.

Loved it; so easy! My hubby loved it too. No purple color here, very flavorful.And, I did use red wine. I usually add Worcestershire to my Stroganoff, but forgot. Will do so next time. Also substituted no fat Greek yogurt for sour cream; still delicious.  I have a thriving herb garden, used fresh parsley and some savory. I had left over rare beef roast, so I did not "cook" the beef pieces. I just added to the hot sauce, and it was perfectly cooked and delicious.

did a bit of subbing 1 can of sliced mushrooms & frozen chantrells hand picked and frozen.  Used left over prime rib and Au jus to replace the beef broth.  My husband loved it.
