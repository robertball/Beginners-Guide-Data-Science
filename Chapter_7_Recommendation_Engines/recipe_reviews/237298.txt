I did forget to add the part about adding the oranges so hopefully everyone figured this out.  It's asparagus time again so time to make this cool easy salad for supper.

I recently had this salad at a conference luncheon. Amazing.

Did I miss the step in this recipe where you add in the oranges?

this was a very good salad. This would be a summer favorite.
