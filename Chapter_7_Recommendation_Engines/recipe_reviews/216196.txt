Hi everyone, I'm the submitter of this recipe and I'd like to clarify something. AR changed my recipe a little. The breasts need not be "boneless halves". Pheasant breasts are small. I use skinless whole pheasant breasts with bone in. I remove the pan from the oven occasionally to stir and re-arrange the breasts so as to mix the cream well with the juices and cooked bits from the meat. The gravy is divine.

Good recipe, but I made changes. after browning the pheasant, I added 1/2 cup chopped celery, 1 cup chopped mushrooms and 1 medium chopped onion. I sauteed this in the pan for 3 minutes and then added the half and half. I put it all in a crock pot and cooked it on high. It turned out fabulous.

This is an excellent recipe!  My husband pronounced it the best pheasant recipe ever and my son was licking the dish! I used 2 whole pheasants cut in half.  After browning the bird I placed them in a 9x13 and then added 1 small onion to the butter that was left in the frying pan.  I deglazed with about 1/2 cup of white wine and added salt and pepper.  Then I added the cream and brought it to a boil before pouring it over the birds in the baking dish.  I covered it with foil and backed it for 1 1/2 hours.  The gravy was fantastic with the bird and delicious over mashed potatoes.  We have lots of pheasant in our freezer so this will be made again and again!

This was good, but the pheasant was just a tiny bit dry. I added a bit of garlic powder on the pheasant before dredging in flour, and added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the flour as well. I also added fresh sliced mushrooms which I sauteed in the butter. I only used 3 half breasts, but still used the whole two cups of half and half. I actually wished I'd used more. I served this over campanelle and we enjoyed it!

I made the recipe as described, except I did it in a family sized skillet and used 2 pints of 1/2 and 1/2.  I also included the leg sections, which became very tender.  My 2-year-old seriously ate 1.5 breasts himself.  My 4.5-year-old, who initially was sent to her room for crying that she didn't want to eat the gross looking food, ended up completing the meal by eating a whole leg section.  Both kids were belting out, "More pheasant, please!" faster than we could cut it off the bones.  Very yummy.  Thanks.  We ate it with boiled potatoes, beets, and caprese salad.

I made this for the Wild Game Feed which was held at the Wittenbergs last night (March 3, 2012).  It was delicious.  Served it with fettucine.

I fried it like the recipe said for a few minutes on each side. Then since I did not have half and half I used Cream of Chicken soup and a little left over chicken stock. I added a 4 oz. can of green chiles and a small amount of milk. Mixed all of this together and poured over the pheasant breasts. I then added 2 stalks of chop celery and a few slices of white onion. I sprinkled some paprika, oregano, garlic salt and parsley on top. Bake them for 1 hour at 325 degrees in a covered casserole dish. It turned out pretty good! Moist and very flavorable. It was a tab bit dry but not to bad. At the end I added some brocolli. Served over white rice. Yum!

I did add garlic powder and onion powder to the flour. I also added some mushrooms in with the 1/2 and 1/2. I should have read all the comments, as I did not realize that the 1/2 and 1/2 was going to curdle. I did check the temp of the meat after an hour, thank heavens, or it would have been shoe leather. Live and learn.

This recipe is perfect as written.  I used 3 whole pheasant breasts with bone-in since that is what we had from the hunt.  I prepared the recipe just as written and served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli on the side.  It was delicious!  The gravy is not pretty to look at since the half-n-half curdles during the cooking, but it is delicious and rich tasting.  The whole family loved it.  I can't wait to make this again.

This recipe is very easy to make and absolutely devine! I used the whole bird. I browned it in a skillet and then placed it in the crock pot to finish it off. It is a new Christmas tradition.

This  is the best pheasant recipe I have ever tasted.  I've been eating pheasant all my life.  62 years.  My grandmother's recipe  was to fry it.  My mother's recipe was to "crockpot" it.  And then this year I found this recipe.  My mouth is watering now just writing about it.  I've made it 4 times now and everyone loves it.

Love this! I added one yellow onion, a bit of celery, and mushrooms. I used white wine to deglaze the pan and then used my InstaPot to finish it. (25 min, natural release) The sauce you have at the end is rich and yummy. My kids and husband loved it. I served it with a salad and mashed potatoes. I think I will try red wine instead of white next time. I also may skip browning the meat if I’m using the InstaPot. I’ll try a rioux instead. The breading came off and cooked into the gravy (yum!) during the pressure cooking. So it really won’t impact flavors for that cook method.

The recipe states that the gravy is delicious. That is an understatement! So good!! And the pheasant is tender and savory. I used wild pheasant and it was excellent!

This is my hubby’s favorite recipe for pheasant. I use only the breasts and I filet the breasts off the bones. I usually serve it with a wild and white rice combination.

This is a wonderful, savory, stick- to- your- ribs pheasant because of the creamy sauce/gravy.  Super simple.  As suggested, I added sautéed onion,garlic, and a few small white mushrooms.  Deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine. Used one cup of fat free half and half  and 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup.  I only gave it four stars because the oven time is way, way too long.  Use a meat thermometer and don't overcook or the bird will be dry (even with the tasty sauce).

This was delicious!!! Although I did not read the recipe submitters comments before taking the meat off the bone. So we did 4 boneless breasts, only cooked them for 15 minutes in the oven. Everything else we did as the recipe called for and they turned out so good!!

Would have been nice if it said how long to simmer after adding the cream.  But it didn't so I simmered for about 10 minutes.  Also, only needed to bake for about 55 minutes.  Finally added a little Weber Beer Can Chicken seasoning and garlic salt to the flower before coating.  

Probably have to say it was the best pheasant I've ever eaten.
