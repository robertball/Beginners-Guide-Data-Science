The dough for this was easy enough to put together. I did half butter, half margerine, added a half tsp. each of butter flavoring and vanilla flavoring. I also used instant TURTLE pudding. I haven't made the cookies yet, as the dough is chilling but I will tomorrow. As for the dough, it took me less than five minutes to assemble. UPDATE: Not impressed. These baked up flat and spread all over my pan. What a waste. You want a good pudding cookie recipe, use Mom's Chocolate Chip Cookies from this site.

These are hands down the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.  I get rave reviews for them no matter who I'm serving them to.  The 'secret' ingredient of pudding adds something different and keeps them so moist and chewy.  I've made these with chocolate pudding mix in place of vanilla, and with white & chocolate chips.  Any way you mix it up, they're always fabulous!

A week ago I took the top six Chocolate Chip Cookies from this website and made all of them.  I took the cookies to work and my church social, and asked people to tell me which cookies were their favorite.  This recipe got about five percent of the vote.  They were described as "too sweet" or "too hard".  Not terrible, but not a 5 star recipe IMO.

These cookies turn out perfect every time!  I make them a LOT!  I think the key to perfection is making them big; I use my larger soup spoons and heap it on.  The only other thing I changed is the shortening--I use 3/4 c butter flavored crisco and 1/4c of either butter or margarine.

Thanks for a fabulous recipe--I never have to worry if they'll turn out good enough to take somewhere.

Great recipe.  Turns out a very attractive looking cookie, not flat like a lot of choc chip recipes.  I liked the flavor and it was a dense, soft cookie.  That is the kind I like.  I used butter flavored crisco.  My 2 year old had a lot of fun helping me make them and the dough was not at all sticky so she was able to mix it with her hands.  This one is a keeper.

I used butter instead of shortening, so that might affect my review...

I made these with french vanilla pudding, and the dough was beautiful.  I don't eat cookie dough (due to the raw eggs) but I happened to taste this, and LOVED it!  It was the best dough I've ever tasted.  The cookies were good (not cakey at all) but needed to cook longer than my cookies normally do.  They are VERY rich.

Although I do really like these, I have another recipe (without pudding) that I prefer.

Well, aren't these a yummy cookie.  You don't have to change a thing, although I did a little.  i just cut back on the white sugar a little, 1/4cup less and used sugar free vanilla pudding.  I also used white whole wheat flour, this made the batter a little dry, so I added just a bit of milk for extra moisture.  Delicious and alot easier than other chocolate chip cookie recipes.  I like that they are crispy.  Thank you, you deserved your blue ribbons.

Awesome cookies! Got a lot of complements. Came out nice and soft! I took the advice of some other reviews and used 3/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter. Also, I only had 2 small (1.5oz) pudding boxes totaling 3oz pudding instead of 3.5oz. Will defiantly make these again!

A little twist on the traditional chocolate chip recipe.  The vanilla pudding and sifting the dry ingredients really made these cookies fluffy.

I omitted the chocolate chips and switched the pudding to pistachio.  I also added 1/2 cup of raisins just for fun.  All I can say is 'Heavenly'.  The cookies fluffed up so nicely, very chewy and delightful.

I wish there was an option for more than five stars as these cookies are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made! I'm not entirely sure why some people gave the recipe such a low rating, unless they did something wrong, like the reviewer who chilled the dough. Nowhere does it say to chill the dough, and it will ruin your cookies. I keep the dough at room temperature the entire time. They always bake up with a nice crispy edge and incredibly soft center. These are amazing and I always get great reviews!

I have many other cookie recipes that I like better than this one; however, I had to use up a box of instant chocolate pudding, and I had to make cookies for my son's school.  So I had to try these.  They turned out very well.  Except for the flavor change of the pudding, I did everything according to the recipe.  For those of you that have had any trouble at all with these, you may want to stay away from using margarine. This is especially true if you chill or refrigerate your dough.  Use a butter or shortening.  Not all cookie doughs are best after refrigerating. Many turn out better by not.

I've used this ccokie recipe for years (found on this site) and it ALWAYS turns out great! The best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever tried.  If you take the ccokies out right as they are beginning to brown on teh edge, they will turn out the perfect teture and will not harden over the next few days!  Thanks for posting this and allowing my friends and family to enjoy such great cookies!

I have made these twice so far.  The first time I used chocolate pudding because I didn't have vanilla.  They turned out tasting & looking perfect.  Better than any other chocolate chip cookie I've made and I make them at least every couple weeks or so.  The second time I used vanilla pudding and everyone loved them too :)  HIGHLY RECOMMEND, these are so easy too.  Follow exact recipe though, no substitutes like butter or anything.

Yum Yum Yum! These are amazing choc. chip cookies.  So many recipes turn out flat and hard, but these are soft and full.  Made a couple of variations, but my favorite is using coconut cream pudding - Yummy!

This is my go to recipe from now on. I make these every Sunday to take to work Monday. I use cheesecake flavored instant pudding mix and add a few more chocolate chips, but keep the rest the same.

These are my favorite chocolate chip cookies of all time!! They soak up milk well but still have a chewy consistency, keep for a long time if stored in a ziplock, and everyone loves them! I follow the instructions exactly and always end up with great cookies!

My half batch turned out with amazing flavor and texture. I used half shortening and half butter and did overcook them slightly because they looked so raw even at 12 minutes- pretty certain that was due to my inexperience. Regardless, even over baking them did not take away their perfect slightly crispy edges and chewy interior.

I have made these cookies twice this week..they are the best cookies ever..I will never make any other chocolate chip recipe other then this one.  I am making another batch tomorrow but will use lemon instant pudding and use one and half cups of white sugar and omit the brown sugar, add a teaspoon of lemon zest and one teaspoon of lemon extract..and a whole bag of white chocolate chips..I think they will be out of this world! Baker Dee in n.c.  love this site!

These are not that great. They get hard after a couple of days. Usually cookies don't last that long at my house, but we've had better.

Very good.  Taste similar to raw cookie dough you buy at grocery store.

these turned out a little crispy. in their defense, I used chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla because that's what I had. They also needed 12-14 min instead of 10.

I took other reviews into consideration when making these cookies, but I wanted to stay as close to the original recipe as possible. The only change I made was reducing the amount of white sugar by 1/4 cup. They were still extremely sweet. I will definitly keep searching for other chocolate chip cookie recipes.

These are a bit too sweet for my taste, however they were a big hit with the family, so I will be making them again.  Maybe using dark chocolate chips would cut down on the sweetness.

This is a great recipe. I love the texture. Don't substitute butter!!!!! Butter makes the cookies spread out too much and thin. Also shortening has less cholesteral then butter.

Great Cookie! I chose this recipe because I wanted to bake something but didn't have any butter. They were easy to work with and came out awesome. Made a lot of cookies (though they will not go to waste:)

I tried to half the recipe and by mistake used a whole box of pudding instead of a half.  They were still awesome.  Great recipe.  Very soft and chewy.  My family thought they were not too sweet.  Wonderful.

I'm definetly not a big fan of semi-sweet chocolate chips, I find they taste like dirt but that's just my opinion. So I substituted the chocolate chips with my favorite, butterscotch chips.  I think it made them better, (but I wouldn't know since I didn't try just the regular chocolate chip way) I also decided to add a simple mini marshmellow to the middle of the cookie for decoration (also I have an addiction to those as well as cookies.) it added a nice little touch and made the taste a little different but definetly worth trying.  This recipe is amazing and I use pudding each time I make cakes so I figured it would be just as good in cookies and it was definetly worth it!

Have made this for years.  Big hit with everyone.  Loves that it stays soft for a long time.  But I still love adding more chocolate chips.

These were good (not as great as I thought they would be which is why I gave it a neutral rating)...a little on the sweet side for me...I like trying different recipes, this one qualifies as different :)

these were fantastic. I didnt prepare well though, because I only had chocolate pudding and peanut butter chips on hand.  If the original is even better, i can't wait to try it!

Absolutely wonderful cookies, my husband fell in love with them.  My problem is that I tend to be cooking them too long, once they sit they get too hard...anyone have any suggestions?  I'm sure this is 'my' problem, and not the recipes.  When they come out of the oven, they are magnificent!

AMAZING!!!!  I made these for the guys while the CHIEFS game was on and they were a huge hit.  Great color, great texture.  I did add 1/2 tsp. of Cinnamin, just because I love cinnamin.  I think the cookies would have been fine without it though.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.
