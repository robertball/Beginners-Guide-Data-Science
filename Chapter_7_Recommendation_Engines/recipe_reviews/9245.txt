These turned out wonderfully. I had to substitute 5T of the butter with salted butter (I ran out of unsalted) so I just ommitted the salt. It was a little difficult to tell when they were done and I overbaked the first sheet-full but they still taste great. The consistency is like shortbread so I had a few with my coffee this morning (I expect they'd be equally good with tea or hot cocoa.) Most of the batch I made are being sent to my boyfriend in the Army but I brought the rest in to work and so far everyone seems to really like them.:) I will probably make these for Christmas gifts although I think next time I'll roll them in crushed sliced almonds before baking. I might also try making batches entirely with almonds instead of chocolate chips.

I omitted chilling the dough because I found it tough and crumbly to begin with. These cookies taste OK but are nothing special. They also take FOREVER to bake (mine took almost 20 minutes!) and it was really hard to tell when they were cooked because they didn't brown up at all. I tried this recipe because my usual recipe contains brown sugar and I was all out.

I was wanting to make cookies but my boyfriend didnt have any eggs so I thought I would try these. They would get a 5 star for easiness. But for flavor just a 3. I even added walnuts and honey because I feared they would be plain and they were. Because they were so easy and required so little I will make them again but might try upping the extract.

I needed a recipe for Chocolate Chip cookies that had no brown sugar because i was out of this ingrediant. This is the first recipe i came across and tried it. I too did not use salt but salted butter and it was delicious. The recipe was so easy that my 7 & 1/2 year daughter made them all by her self. My only suggestion is turning this fab recipe into a double batch because they go so fast you'll be lucky if you get more than one!

I doubled this recipe because I was trying to find something to make all at once to send to my husband and some to take to work. I didn't have any butter just my luck so I used crisco and added 6 tsp of water per cup. However...I have to make some more because they are almost gone!!...They are perfect and they will just crumble in your mouth!! I also put some raspberry jelly in the middle of them and then folded them over before baking and those were really yummy too!! Enjoy: )

Okay I have to admit Cookues aren't ny specailty. I am by no means a cookie expert. But I must admit I had a lot of trouble with these. As many said I had a hard time telling when they were done. The dough was also crumbly which I don't know if that is supposed to happen. All in alk these cookies taste pretty mediocre. They didn't spead eaither.
