I use Rose's sweetened lime juice. Simple syrup and fresh lime juice make this an average drink. I prefer Vodka over Gin. A vodka Gimlet is a delicious lime tasting drink.

If you like gin and you like lime, you will love this!  I made this for the Western Region Faceless Frenzy, July 2012.  My gin loving friends were more than happy to help with this!

I loved it, however I used Rose's sweetened lime juice. I'm thinking straight lime juice would lock my dang jaws! ??

I made this for a 50s themed party with friends as that was a common drink at that time.  I used Tanquary Gin, lemon juice and simple syrup (leftover from preserving peaches) plus a slice of lime.  It was tart, a little too tart for me but some guests liked the tartness.  If I was to make it again, I would sweeten it up a bit.

I love gin and I love lime. I notice that the video called for 1 tablespoon simple syrup instead of 1 teas. I ended up using 2 tablespoons.  Don't use Rose's, it has high fructose corn syrup. Yuk! Making your own simple syrup is easy, just 1:1 sugar and water, bring to a boil then pour into a bottle. It lasts for a long time. My husband prefers vodka. I didn't think it was as tasty a drink with vodka. This is nice for hot summer evenings!
