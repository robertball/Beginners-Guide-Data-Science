Excellent recipe, very light and fluffy with lots of maple flavor! Substituted the cream of tartar for vinegar (3X amt of tartar amt) since I did not have any and was still great! Loved it!

This was good but a little sticky rather than peaky.  I doubled the cream of tarter and that helped it peak more.  I also removed it from the double boiler once everything was thickening up.  I put it on a Black Walnut cake and my husband loved it.  Garnished with walnuts on top of frosting.

Very tasty!  I'm waiting to put it on the brown sugar brownies that are cooking and I can't stop eating it.  It has a nice, light flavor.

Made today for my boyfriend's bday. He is on a low cholesterol diet and this recipe was just right. The only thing I changed was I replaced the vegetable oil with plain applesauce. I also made cupcakes instead of cake. Cooked at 350 for 18 minutes. Came out of the oven chocolatey and moist. I think they will be a big hit.

Made this to put on a spice cake for my Mom's birthday.  Everyone raved over it and said how great it was!  They were even talking about putting the left over frosting on top of waffles the next morning!?? Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

Easy, light and fluffy, with a good flavor. You need to be ready to use it the minute it's done because the texture starts to change in the pan pretty soon.
