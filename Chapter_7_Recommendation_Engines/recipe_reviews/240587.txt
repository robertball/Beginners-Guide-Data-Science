Really really good! I used almost a whole can of broth. The directions didn't seen to say at what point to add other half of broth. I put it all in at start. Only other minor change was to add a bunch of frozen peas at the time I put the biscuits in. Family devoured! Even pickiest complainer loved it. Thanks! (I Cooked biscuit/dumplings a bit over 1 hr and they wre done)

Followed to the letter with the exception of poultry seasoning, did not have any so I used a little thyme, rosemary, and sage.  Turned out amazing!  I was skeptical that the dough would make nice dumplings but it turned out so well!  My only caution is to use small pieces of dough, they grow as they bake.  Two teenagers asked for seconds (and thirds!)

Made this yesterday and I wanted to add - for all the working/cooking moms and dads out there I tried this on low for 8.5 hours when I had to be in the office and it turned out really well.  I actually didn't notice a difference.  Just be aware you either need someone to put the dumplings in ( I trusted a teenager) or it will take another 1 - 1.5 hours after you get home!

Very easy and very good. I did use one can of Cream of mushroom & one can of Cream of Chicken soup. I didn't have any Chicken broth so I used my 2-low salt Chicken cubes in 12 ounces of water. I did add 1 tsp. of garlic, 1/2 tsp.Italian seasonings and Mrs. Dash Table Blend. I cut each biscuit in 4 pieces and rolled them in flour for the final hour of cooking. It thickened up the sauce and it was wonderful. I added a salad and it was a very good winter dinner.

So delicious and so simple!! I used 6 chicken breast because we wanted plenty of left overs. I made some small adjustments according to what I had on hand. I did not have any poultry seasoning so I used Italian seasonings and sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. I did not soak the chicken first, I seasoned each breast and placed them in the bottom of the Crock-Pot. I then poured about half a box of great value chicken stock over the chicken. I chopped up one large onion and about 6 cloves of garlic very finely (we love garlic) and put it all into the pot on top of the chicken and broth. Next I put about half of a large bag of mixed frozen veggies into the Crock-Pot and cut up my butter into cubes and scattered it on top of the veggies. I then poured my soups directly over the veggies, I used one large can of cream of chicken soup and one small one. 

I cooked this on low for 7 hours then I took all of the chicken out and shredded it with two forks and returned it to the Crock-Pot. I used refrigerated biscuit dough as the recipe calls for and cut each biscuit into fourths. I rolled the pieces in flour and then dropped them into the top of my chicken stew mix. Leaving them at the very top, I placed the lid back on and turned the Crock-Pot to high and cooked for another hour. Dumplings were cooked perfectly and the chicken soup came out delicious and full of flavor!! Will definitely be making this many more times in the future!

This is very simple and easy. I used whole baby carrots because that is what I had on hand. I didn't use water or soak the chicken in water at all. I put about half a box of great value chicken broth in at the beginning and let it go on high for 6 hours because I was at work. The chicken is so tender. I added the biscuit dough and let it go another hour on high when I got home and it tastes fantastic plus I have leftovers!!

Awesome flavor.  Even added a few frozen green peas.  (Maybe 2/3 cup)  I used Cream of Chicken soup and Cream of Celery.

I've never made chicken and dumplings before so I didn't know what to expect but was thrilled with the way it came out.  My family finished it up and asked if I would make it again the next week.  I only have two comments.  Being a novice, I didn't realize that the biscuit dough bites should be placed on top, not mixed in with,  the stew.  Yikes, what a gooey mess.  Also, I did add some frozen petite peas which I thought made it too sweet but that's just personal preference. Fantastic easy recipe

Pretty good. Could be much better if I used the called-for ingredients. Didn't have poultry seasoning or celery, so I used 1/2 tsp rosemary and 1/2 tsp thyme and some sprinkles of celery seed. Next time make sure to use poultry seasoning- the rosemary taste was too strong.  Also added a bag of frozen cut green beans and 1/2 bag of frozen corn (good addition). Because I started the stew too late in the crockpot, I transferred it to a stock pot during the last hour. Used Bisquick for dumplings.

Loved this recipe.  Made it pretty much as written, but used chicken thighs...I think they always work better in slow cooker recipes.  Next time I will add more carrots and celery and include peas.

Yummy and hit the spot. I looked over many recipes before settling on this one. 

Everyone makes a few modifications and here are mine: I added a bag of frozen veggies. I also added a splash of cooking wine (why not, right?). I sneaked in some other seasonings, too, but used the ones called for in the recipe. I added some rosemary, some garlic, and a bit of thyme.  I also did not layer like instructed. I just chunked it all in and said a quick Hail Mary. 

I was worried about the biscuits getting doughy but they were perfect. I had never made chicken and dumplings before and these turned out great.

It worked! This dish was delicious. Very hearty and perfect for cold Kansas winter days.

So easy and so good! I added a can of creamed corn with the veggies, and added the other half can of broth after shredding the chicken and adding the dumplings. Nice and creamy, and filling too!

This was excellent! Great comfort food! Only thing I did different was used about a quarter can of the chicken broth in place of the water and just used the remaining broth in the recipe. Also cooked the chicken amd veggies on low for 7 hours then shredded amd added the buscuits and cooked on high for 1 1/2 hour as directed. No other changes and we loved it!

I made this today, followed the recipe almost exactly. Since I did not have low sodium chicken broth, I just put a little extra water so that it would not be too salty. I set it up in the crockpot  before going out  and I came back to an amazing aroma. I used Pillsbury reduced fat biscuit dough, cut them up into 8 pieces and had 3 biscuits left over for later. Will definitely make this again!

This dish is delicious and so easy to make. I didn't have four chicken breasts, only two of those ones that come frozen in the bag in the freezer section of the grocery store. So I used two chicken breasts and three medium sized chicken thighs. Which, I think added more flavor. I prepared the recipe as written BUT I added some thyme, sage, and celery seed (all to my own taste). In the last cooking hour, I also added a little bit of mixed veggies, the type that has peas, carrots, etc. with a tablespoon of flour  mixed with a bit of water to thicken the sauce. My family enjoyed this dish and I love that it is a SLOW COOKER MEAL, to boot!

VERY FLAVORFUL !! I used 4 chicken thighs, broth instead of water and added the usual veggies (canned peas and potatoes) but other than that followed the recipe as is. 
The only thing I would change is to make homemade biscuits instead of canned. My canned name brand biscuits never puffed up even after leaving them in for 2 hours.
Will make again

Wonderful comfort food!  Made almost as directed. I did however add more broth as other reviewers suggested.  I used frozen Pillsbury  buttermilk biscuits (thawed and cut in 1/4's) and thighs instead of breast meat...I may have used too many biscuits because there was not enough broth, even after my addition.  I will make this again and adjust biscuit/broth ratio.  Thanks for the EASY recipe :)

Really easy and tasty recipe. I marked it down to 4 stars because it needed more liquid, the biscuits soaked up what little there was. I also think this recipe would be better with cubed chicken instead of shredding. The shredded chicken gets lost in with the dumplings.

This is a weekly meal for my boys and I. My youngest comes home and shreds the chicken in the crockpot and tears up the biscuits - throws them on top and done. Tastes great as leftovers the next day as well. Highly recommend trying this easy recipe. Only thing I change is I just throw the chicken in with everything - don't worry about the poultry seasoning. Also for ease in the morning I use the pre chopped onion and celery from the store so I can just dump it in before heading to work!

This recipe was great!  I poured the second half of the chicken stock in right after the veggies and before the butter since the recipe did not mention when to use.  Also, I did not stir the biscuits/dumplings in to cook.  I just cut small (about nickel size) and placed them on top since I like to make sure they cook through enough.  They were perfect!  I did omit the celery only because I tend to feel like using celery overpowers the recipes I have tried it in.

Don’t use butter flaky style store bought biscuit, this made it sweet.  Next time I’ll only use one case of cream of chicken and leave onions in quarters so I can take them out. We are more of a broth chicken and dumplings family than gravy, but Everyone ate it!  I also flattened the biscuits out and cut smaller (think 16 pieces) instead of quarters for more of them and less doughy biscuits.

I followed the exact recipe. We thought it was good but next time I would add another can of chicken broth. We like more of a  liquid soup consistency and thought this was kind of thick.

So easy and yummy. I used frozen peas and carrots and fresh celery. I never used water just extra chicken broth. I floured the biscuit pieces. I put it on low for 6 hours then high for the last two and added the biscuits for the last two hours because I was worried they wouldn't cook.

I love this recipe! I like to premake a couple batches to freeze as "dump meals" I just leave out the liquids and the "dumplings" so I can just dump in the bag and then add the soups/broth. I even made it for a large gathering of friends and it was a huge hit!

This was just what I was looking for-a good base to build on and easy to make. I skipped the whole water bath for my chicken, 
just seasoned the chicken directly, lightly browned it for more flavor (I can do this right in my slow cooker), then dumped in all the veggies, including about 2/3 cup of peas. I mixed the whole can of chicken broth with the soups and rosemary  and poured this over the top.  I added the biscuits as directed and they were done in about an hour. Next time and there will be a next time,  I,ll make my own biscuit dough.

This is a great comfort food and easily prepared.  However...made as instructed, it was very bland.  I added fresh garlic, parsley, hot sauce, and an onion/garlic salt blend.

My kids loved this.  I didn't have biscuits so I used crescent rolls instead and everyone thought it was great.  And it was also very forgiving.  I didn't have the soups or the carrots and I added  them in after about 3 hours

This recipe is very favorful. I cut the chicken into smaller pieces therefore they took a lot less time to cook. Right before I added the cut up biscuits I also stirred in, 1 small package of frozen peas. This made it even more colorful. Next time I make this I will also add a bay leaf and 1 can of chicken broth....most of the original recipe liquid was absorbed into the biscuits. This was a delicious and easy recipe....great for fall and winter months.

I wound up cooking it for a little longer because my husband got stuck working late.  I only used 3 chicken breasts since that was already enough to fill the bottom of my crockpot pretty well.  I didn't use low sodium or low fat for the broth and soups, but otherwise I think I followed it to a T and it turned out great.  My husband said it was "jammin'" and went back for seconds.  Next time I think I'll use the recommended low sodium items (y'know, that the recipe actually calls for) because the way I made it this time was a tid bit salty for my taste.

Tasted really good and lasted us for three days of dinner for two people. I didn’t put the biscuits in the crockpot, rather baked them in oven and poured the soup over top. Will be adding to our monthly dinner rotation for the winter!

This is delicious! I misread the recipe and used 2 cans of biscuits but since I LOVE dumplings it wasn't a problem. I cut the celery and carrots into large pieces - love the flavor they add but I don't like to eat them. Also, I didn't have dried rosemary so I used 3 stems of fresh rosemary.

Delicious! I just sprinkled the salt, pepper and poultry seasoning on the chicken and put it in the crock pot.  Poured in all the water and broth and then layered the veggies, etc. I cut each biscuit into 6 pieces and tossed in a bit of flour before putting on top. (Definitely do not use the entire package of biscuits - I couldn't find the 10 oz size so I used the package I found. There were more dumplings than chicken mix.) Will definitely make it again and cut back on the biscuits and see if I have more liquid in the mix.

I did not like the amount of celery taste. It overpowered everything. I would either not use the condensed cream of celery soup or eliminate the celery stalks.
I think 2 cans of cream of chicken and half the celery stalks.

I have slightly modified, not because the original really needed it but because we like it as soup and some members of the family dont like celery or onion. I use a whole can of chix broth and even a little extra water. I also only do carrots and about 3 good size potatoes, omitting the celery and onion. I also add in 1 extra can of  cream of chix soup and I dont put the rosemary in (I used to just reduce the amount of rosemary  but I find that it's just as good without it).

Take the time to make your own poultry seasoning...but this recipe is FANTASTIC. Accurate & recommend low-sodium soups and add Himalayan Salt at the end to taste.

This was very simple, and had all the ingredients at hand. I added extra poultry seasoning and rosemary, but it still seemed to be missing something. Next time, I'll play around with some more seasonings. Chicken was very tender. Thanks for the recipe!

Summer yummy and easy to make, though it was a bit salty for my taste. Next time I’ll probably dilute the broth and use less/no salt in mine. I cooked it on low instead of high, so I did the chicken and veggies overnight and then another 4 hours after I added the biscuit dough.

I cheated even more and used mixed frozen veggies. I did add some garlic cloves crushed and a whole diced onion. It was delicious and now we make it every other week.

I made this to bring to work for my team mates. They did not hold back at all. Every bite was eaten and the guys kept going on about how awesome it was. Great recipe and very good meal. Will make many times again.

Made this using Christmas leftover Turkey.  Left out the rosemary added some fresh chopped garlic clove. Also didn't have any biscuit dough so made an Egg Noodles by Linda Recipe found on this site. https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11991/egg-noodles/

Hubby loved it even more than my Bisquick dumplings!  I followed the recipe ( minus the carrots), didn’t add the rest of the broth and it’s like a meal more than a soup.  The 4 grand buttermilk biscuits, quartered, that I used were actually browned on top and had flaky layers inside.  Very impressive!  Tossed a 1/2-1 c frozen peas in when added the biscuits.

Super easy, and pretty tasty! Next time I will add more spices.

I made this in a 6-quart slow cooker and one tube of biscuits worked perfectly. I cooked the first time for 4 hours and the chicken was juicy and easy to shred. I did roll the biscuit pieces in flour as other reviewers advised, and that thickened the juice nicely. After adding the biscuits, I cooked for one more hour and they came out awesome.

One family member did mention she thought the carrots were a bit "crunchy." They were less soft than usual for a slow cooker recipe, but not crunchy.

I will definitely make this again. Per some of the suggestions for this recipe I added broth instead of water to cover the ingredients, and I cooked the biscuits for the last three hours. It turned out great! Family absolutely loved it!

My family loved this. Like many, I made some changes. I made a homemade version of the soups, I used white wine in place of the water and replaced a tad of the broth with wine too. I added all of the broth at the beginning. I cooked it over night on low and used homemade biscuit dough cor the dumplings.

I made it exactly as the recipe said however, I did make my dumplings and cooked in another pot. I was afraid my slow cooker would not hold them. I liked the recipe very much and I will try it again but I will make some changes when I try it. I do however think that I will leave the recipe as is without the dumplings and try making it with rice, noodles, or maybe potatoes.  Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

Amazing!!!!!! Excellent as written but sometimes I’ll sub a can of cream of mushroom if I’m out of the other flavor, I’ve never added the Rosemary since we aren’t fans. Sometimes I add the butter and sometimes not, doesn’t seem to make a difference. Sometimes I’ll throw in frozen chicken breasts if I’m short on time and I always stir in a bag of frozen peas when I shred the chicken before the biscuits go on. Thanks we have this frequently!!

OMG so good! The whole house loved it! I'll be making this all the time! I put all the broth in at once since it never said when to use the other half. Instead of a can of broth, I used 1.5 tsp of Better Than Bouillon in 10 oz of water.  
Thank you to the original poster!

This was the first soup I’ve ever really made on my own and, I’m not going to lie, I’m pretty proud with how it turned out. I added corn, green pepper and a jalapeño. It didn’t turn out as creamy as I expected. I wasn’t a huge fan of the pillsbury dough for dumplings and will probably just use bisquick next time. All in all I’m pretty pleased!

It's very good. It says to pour half of the chicken brought in the slow cooker at the beginning but doesn't say what to do with the other half of it. I ended up adding it before cooking the chicken.

I would make this again.  LOVED the idea of mixing the poultry seasoning with water and salt/pepper before soaking the chicken in it.  The seasoning totally stuck with the chicken and enhanced the flavor of the meat.  I added only a half can of corn and an extra 2 TBSP of butter.  I don't think this would affect the original recipe considerably.  Overall, great recipe that I will be using again!

My boyfriend and I work different shifts so this is a nice way to make sure we stay away from fast food for lunch and dinners during work.  My Boyfriend ate about half of it when it was done in the crockpot and he couldn’t get enough of it!! I added some peas towards the end and it was wonderful!! I’ll be making this again no doubt!

This is even better than my mom used to make, and that's saying a lot!! I followed the recipe exactly, except for the dumplings. i wanted to try home-made ones and used "Dumplings by Carol" from this site, which were fantastic.
I have found my go-to chicken and dumpling recipe. Thank you for this recipe!!

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at how this turned out. We have a friend who makes & sells the best homemade chicken dumpling soup in his restaurant so we were prepared to compare this soup to his. These dumplings weren't as good as egg dumplings but they were better than most baking powder dumplings which tend to be softer and mushier. The broth was thicker but had a lot of good flavor. Since it was easy to make, I will definitely make it again.

This was really good, but I struggled to get the dumplings cooked in time. I think this would be excellent with egg noodles.

I love this recipe. All my little kids do too, which is rare. I made it with just one can of cream of chicken and omitted the celery and cream of celery (my husband can't stand celery). It is one of my go to's now.

I went with other reviewers and added more broth. I like my chicken and dumplings more soupy and added an entire 32 oz box of broth to the 1 can in the recipe. I didn't have rosemary on hand, but I did use thyme and sage. I only had one can of cream of chicken, and it worked well with the added broth. I used 16 oz biscuits. All else was the same. Turned out great!

I followed this pretty closely to the recipe. I did add Garlic salt ( I put garlic in everything!). I also took someone else’s idea of flouring the biscuits to make it thicker. Glad I did. It was perfect. Next time I may add a can of Cream of mushroom soup (another reviewers idea!) and a chicken bouillon cube

Flavor was ok, we didn’t care for the rosemary, and the dumplings were very heavy.. I’ve made chicken and dumplings for many years from scratch, including the dumplings. I was looking for something I could make in the slow cooker while I was at work.  This recipe may work for some I won’t be using it again.

I made this according to the recipe given. My husband loved it but me, not so much so we compromised on the rating. I agree that this is a good dish for a cold night but I would use fresh rosemary and pearl onions. And I will make it again. I particularly liked the suggestion to cut the biscuits in quarters and roll in a little flour to make the dish a little thicker.

Very tasty and easy!  I made just a few changes: Used both boneless skinless breasts and thighs instead of just breasts; Used regular versions of the cream of chicken and celery soups instead of reduced-fat; Used Italian seasoning instead of rosemary (personal preference); Instructions never say when to add the other half of the broth - we just added after everything else.  Will be making again!

I've made this as-is, but prefer more vegetables. We add frozen peas and corn. I also must be doing something wrong because I've never gotten the biscuits to cook right in the crock pot. (They end up too doughy.) So we just cook them separately now and pour this mixture on top.

Really good recipe though. It's one of our go-to's.

I loved this recipe.  The flavor was perfect.  But I made a Rookie mistake and purchased the wrong type of biscuits.  (Pilsbury Grands, Flaky Layer)  Thank the cooking gods that they were cut in small pieces.  The Grands ballooned up. Ha!  Nevertheless, my Wife and I ate it up like it was our last meal(s).  Excellent leftovers

We've made this multiple times. It's good exactly as written and way better when you've made it so many times you can play around with it. We no longer put dough in the pot, we bake biscuits and pour this over them. We use far less liquid now because the frozen chicken we use has water in it and it was more soupy than a rich thick stew type we were looking for. Once we cut down the liquid (if we use frozen chicken) it gives me that thicker consistency we desire.  We kind of use whatever spices we like and I've added sliced sautéed mushrooms. We love this dish and its a staple in our house for the last 1 1/2 years.

Turned out great even without the celery since I didn't have any. Used celery seed instead. It smells wonderful & tastes delicious. Only had crescent roll dough so I used that. It worked fine. Other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written.

Really good comfort food and so easy!  I did use broth in place of water, no butter (figured enough fat on chicken) and no rosemary.  I also cooked peas on side so I could decide if it was too sweet, I thought it was nice addition, everyone ended up stirring in with rest of meal.

Followed recipe as written. Used recipe for poultry seasoning on this site since I didn't have any.  We all enjoyed it.  I did add all the broth at beginning since recipe doesn't state when to add other half. I also flattened biscuits and cut them into 15 or more small pieces for each biscuit and placed them on top (per recommendations of others to not mix in).  Definitely will make again!

This was a very easy recipe and it tastes good. I added the peas as others recommended and I think it was a great addition. My dumplings kind of all ended up being a layer of dough instead of single dumplings but that was probably my fault. I would say maybe to use two cans of cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of celery because it had a bit too much celery flavor throughout the dish.

Overall, very good.    I added more seasoning (oregano, basil) however it turned out very good.   Chicken was super tender and the sauce had a great taste.

I am really impressed with this dish! It was so easy to throw everything in the slow cooker (I did not follow the directions exactly I just threw the chicken and the seasoning in at the same time instead of coating it ). It is also super delicious!

A  big hit, bigger than my standard C&D recipe.  I increased the amount of chicken used, and rather than shredding, started with cutting the chicken in small chunks.  Less work, same result.

I was skeptical since the recipe seemed so simple. It is quite delicious. The only changes I made, were seasoning the chicken my way. I like adobo and garlic powder. I didn't use water at all, doubled the chicken broth, Cooked overnight on low. The biscuits do look weird the last hour, but once you stir them a little, they look more appetizing. I served mine over a little egg noodles. Yummy!

I'm not that great of a cook so I try to find easy recipes. This was very easy and came out tasting like I spent more time preparing it. I wasn't sure about the canned dough but I can't make biscuits so I went for it and it was great. Thanks for sharing this recipe, my wife is a southern girl and she absolutely loved it. She took leftovers to work for lunch.

This was wonderful.  I added some diced potatos and peas and more soup so I had more broth. I was feeding quite a few people. I also just cooked the biscuits on the side so they could add them when they were ready to eat.  Four of the ladies asked for the recipe and the leftovers were gobbled up by my husband who took it for lunch.   This is definitely a keeper!!

I changed one thing, I skipped the whisking the mixture part, and just added all ingredients to the slow cooker, did everything else the same way as in original recipe.
I will be making this again

I mistakenly added the entire container in the beginning instead of some at the beginning and some at the end. It still came out very savory and not overly seasoned. The "dumplings" were a little doughy. In the future, I will either make the pieces much smaller or use and actual dumpling I've heard Goya makes. (The recipe didn't specify how small or large to make the biscuit pieces. I cut each biscuit into nine pieces, but that wasn't small enough. The triangle pieces on the end were a nice size, but the center pieces were too doughy.) All in all, a great, simple, delicious, filling one-pot recipe. Both my parents AND children loved it!

This was good. It just wasn't as good as most southern chicken and dumpling dish, but it was easy enough. After reading reviews, I tried the dumplings after an hour (and I made them small); they need the full 1 1/2 hours as directed or more if larger.

It is delicious with exception of the biscuit "dumplings".  I  added half a bag of frozen peas, an extra can of cream of chicken soup and an additional 5 ounces of chicken broth. I will make it again but next time I will bake the biscuits rather than add them to the chicken dish.

Served this for a dinner with extended family, and it was a HUGE hit with all. We have fond memories of my grandmother's homemade chicken and dumplings, and the taste of this brought smiles to the whole family! The only changes I made to the recipe were to use 1/2 a large onion,  2 carrot sticks and 2 celery sticks. I also added frozen peas at the same time I added the biscuit dough as another reviewer suggested. I also felt the chicken was cooked and ready to shred within 3 1/2 hours -- more may have been too long.  Buscuits were ready in 1 hour.

Other than using more chicken broth after the "dumplings" puffed up, I followed the recipe. I might add some peppercorns next time and maybe a bit more poultry seasoning, but it's VERY good as is. My husband loved it, so that pretty much makes it a winner. Thanks!

Really great, easy to make it came out wonderful the first time.

Next time, I will probably use 1 less chicken breast, and replace it with more veggies. It seemed a tead heavy on the meat.

Delicious. I altered it by cooking a whole chicken in the crockpot before and used the broth from it and the soft moist meat from the whole chicken. I was out of celery but used cream of celery soup. My family gobbled it up!

Awesome!  Made it twice so far and was amazing both times.  only thing i may do differently next time is double the biscuit dough (the dumplings taste amazing, and more wouldnt hurt).

I made this pretty much as directed. I didn't soak the chicken in the seasoned water mixture but I did whisk it up and just poured it over the chicken instead. I used the whole can of broth at the beginning. This turned out amazing and had my house smelling so good! Next time I make this, I will double the recipe. We had no leftovers!

This was awesome. My two teenagers couldn't get enough. I used the entire can of chicken broth, but kept everything else pretty much the same.

The flavors in this dish are amazing, but be very careful of the size of the dumplings as they will expand greatly in the cooking.  Mine ended up way too big and really ruined the dish.

This was my first foray into chicken and dumplings and, despite that I had way too much help (and rosemary) from toddler nephews and that I haven't a clue how dumplings should be cooked, it tastes really good. The nephews are both eating it, too.  I wasn't sure if they would.

I added maybe way more poultry seasoning than the recipe called for (because I love it) and I took the suggestion from many of you and threw in frozen peas, but I also added a bag of frozen sweet corn, because it sounded good.  It worked.  While my dumplings may be iffy, I rolled them in flour as someone suggested and the liquid thickened nicely, as promised.  I may try boiling the dumplings in water seasoned with poultry seasoning next time (I read that tip on another site when I realized the dumplings weren't cooperating), but this is definitely something I'll do again.

Awesome!  Everyone loved it. Used the Grandes for the dumpling. Very flaky. Mixed chicken thighs and breast. Cut both up prior to cooking. Came out great!

I just made this soup and the family loved it. The only thing I did different was add some garlic too the soup while it was cooking and I diced up the chicken before I placed it in the slow cooker so I didn't have to remove it later.

I must say I was skeptical about this getting done in my crockpot, but boy was I wrong. It cooked through and was a huge hit. Even my picky daughter liked  it! I will make this again and again.

My family loved this!  No need for all the extra steps- I dumped everything in the crockpot at once (except for the biscuits) and cooked it for the suggested time.  Turned out great!

This recipe is so good! I just added a little more poultry seasoning and added some smoked peprika because it's one of my favorite seasonings as well as a little bit of garlic salt because I ran out of regular salt. I didn't have anything other than cream of chicken so I was afraid it would be a little boring, but it wasnt! I also chopped the celery tops because I always add that to chicken soup and it worked out perfect. Great recipe

Very easy and tasty recipe. I followed pretty closely to the recipe but used two cans of cream of chicken, baby carrots and Safeway Organics brand boxed chicken broth because that's what I had in hand. I really liked how it was kind of a balance between soup and stew. Next time I will use peas like others said to do; only because I love peas. But its good even without .This will be a new addition to the rotation! Thank You for the recipe!

Really easy but so good. I took the tip and added cream corn and sweet peas; I liked the additions a lot.

Was OK. Followed others recommendations and used a can of creamed corn. Added extra of the spices and some carrots, green beans and celery. Added some corn starch as well because with the broth and vegetables I thought it'd be too runny. Added lemon pepper while eating and that helped but was still kind of bland.

This was delicious and super easy to make! I used Cajun seasoning to season the chicken before adding it into the crockpot and it gave it just the right kick. My husband is picky about this meal, but he loved this recipe! Will definitely be making this again and soon!!

Quick and easy. I cooked for 4 hours on high then shredded chicken, added frozen peas, remaining 1/2 can of chicken broth, and biscuits, then cooked for another 1.5 hours. I might try dicing chicken into cubes instead of shredding next time.

AMAZING! Will definitely use again. So easy to make and so tasty! I used a whole can of broth and left out the onions and cream of celery since we didn't have any, but it still tastes GREAT! I actually will probably use more broth next time, maybe another can because I found that after sitting in the slow cooker (off) for a while, when I went to get a second helping, almost all the broth had been soaked up into the biscuits. It wasn't bad that way, and I know it was probably intended, but I like soupy soups. Anyway, thanks so much for sharing!

I used the entire can of chicken broth and I also used cream of mushroom soup with the cream of chicken soup because I didn't have cream of celery soup on hand. I love chicken and dumplings and this recipe was so easy and yummy. I will definitely make it again using the cream of celery soup with the cream of chicken soup.

So delicious, first time I made it with the chicken breast and loved it, but the second time I wanted to try dark meat and used boneless skinless thighs and it was amazing. One of my favorites
