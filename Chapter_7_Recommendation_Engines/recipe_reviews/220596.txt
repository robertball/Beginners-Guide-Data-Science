So I watched the video of this recipe that was posted on the home page, and decided to try it...Had to improvise a bit (apologies to you review purists) used Capt. Morgans spiced rum and had no pineapple juice since I used pre-sliced fresh pineapple in a plastic container and it had a little sponge on the bottom which stole all the juice. Subbed OJ. Subbed a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg for cardamom (personal preference). 
My skillet was a bit larger than 12 inches, so my batter just barely covered the pineapple and cooked up in about 20-25 minutes. 
Very tasty - very buttery

Sorry- I thought the cake was dry. There are other recipes I find much more moist and have more flavour. The cardamom did not add the "special" element I thought it would.

I was surprised by this, because I expected the dough to be liquidy, as usual for cake. The dough was actually very thick, almost knead-able, even after I added a splash more of milk to try and loosen it up a little. But, I gamely spread the dough on the fruit-and-sugar in the skillet, and baked it... and it came out DELICIOUS. As a note, I used coconut sugar in place of the brown sugar in the topping, and a third of a cup of agave instead of the half cup of sugar in the cake itself. Worked just fine.

Great, reminds me of my mom's cast iron pineapple upside down cake. Only difference I have made in recipe is to use canned unsweetened pineapple slices with a maraschino cherry placed in the center of the slices and Splenda brown sugar blend for brown sugar. Also do not have cardamon and used dash of cinnamon. Great recipe Chef John!

I was looking so forward to trying this recipe I even bought a cast-iron skillet! I don't know if I did something wrong (I can't see that I did), but it was disappointing. It looked pretty, just like the photo, but the cake was dry and didn't have much flavor.

This was quite good, but I'm sorry to say that I likes the box mix version my brother made for me better.  He used a yellow cake mix (substituting applesauce for the oil - cake was really moist - but of course with a brown sugar & butter topping it still wasn't low fat).  The fresh ingredients worked fine, but it was on the dense side as most scratch cakes are.

This is fantastic. I couldn't make it in an iron skillet because I didn't have one -  I used a wok and then baked it in a regular pan. I don't think there was substantial merit.

The pineapple portion was very tasty, but this was one of the most dry upside down pineapple cakes i have ever made/had.  Very disappointing.

I did not care for this. I felt that I wasted good Rum & Pineapple on this. Sorry Chef John, but this was just not good. Dry as the desert that I live in.

I doubled this, and left out the cardamom and rum... used almond extract in the topping instead, and canned pineapple chunks.  The topping is wonderful, glad i watched the video because mine always stuck to the pan. Baked at 400 for 25 minutes in a cast iron skillet, it released perfectly.  The cake itself is, a little doughy tasting to me though... it is very light and fluffy, although I would prefer this a bit less done because i like my cake very dense and heavy.  Doesnt taste like a boxed cake at all, which is good, but something is just lacking for me.  I usually put a can of chunk or shredded pineapple in my cake mix, to make it a bit more dense, so maybe I will try that next time and see if it changes much.  If you like a fluffy cake, though, this is perfect for you!  Just be sure to mix the dry ingredients together first, makes a definite difference.

Very yummy and so easy to make! I used up some fresh pineapple.  Followed the recipe ingredients, added 1/2 tsp vanilla to batter and ommited cardamom(didn't use or have).  The batter is very thick and it rose up nicely and was moist, sweet and delicious!

It was pretty good however there was not a lot of juicy glaze involved...maybe if I doubled the glaze it would have been perfect....My father-in-law and a 10 year old niece loved it.

Made this today and it is DELICIOUS!!!  I did not have Cardamom so I too used Cinnamon in the batter.  I did not have Dark Rum so I just used regular Rum which was just fine.  My fresh pineapple was not ripe yet so I used a 15 ounce can of drained (save the juice) pineapple slices.  For those of you who thought the batter to be on the dry side I added 2 tablespoons of pineapple juice.  Although, I think the batter is supposed to be on the dry side in order to absorb all the butter, and juice from the pineapple!  This is a GREAT and simple recipe!!!

I would recommend doubling the cake batter part of this recipe, as you will want more, if you are like me. (still add only the 1/2 cup melted butter to that batter though)

I made this cake a second time because it was so good and easy to make. The first time I found the dough to be a touch dry so I used buttermilk instead of milk. I also added a bit more of the pineapple juice to the sauce and took it off the heat shortly after it started to boil. Very good my family loved it.

I cannot get enough of this cake. Followed the recipe to the T, leaving out the cardamom because I didn't have any, and added extra cinnamon. The cake turned out SO perfectly. Took it out of the oven early, because I love my cake soft and dense...it was sublime! I ate too many servings by myself! The caramel offsets the tart of the pineapple, and pairs really well with coffee. I've made it twice so far--it's my absolute favorite dessert.

Good flavor, but much too dry. If I ever try this again I'll add a lot more juice in the beginning - maybe 1/2cup? Or even perhaps a full 1cup of juice... I'd just have to try it. When you flip there isn't any hot liquid to soak into the cake. The best part is the edge of the cake where it caramelized with the topping.

Made this for my dad's birthday since upsidedown pineapple cake is his favorite. Everyone who was there ate it and thought it was the best cake upsidedown pineapple they ever had. I myself thought it was delicous as well. To add a bit of appeal, I waited till the cake cooled down and sprinkiled powdered sugar on the top of the cake.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday 3 years ago and he has requested it for his birthday ever since! This cake is sweet, tangy, fresh, and flavorful!  I like that this is different from the typical overly sweet and artificial pineapple upside cake using canned pineapple and cake mix.

DRY!!!!!  This was not the gooey, buttery cake I love and remember from childhood.  The topping was delicious, but the cake was dry, crumbly, and had very little pineapple (or any other) flavor.  I have lost my mother's recipe and will have to keep experimenting; this is not it.

Good flavor , easy to do but a bit dry. I felt like I should make extra brown sugar butter too to drizzle on top after slicing.

This is simply amazing.  I did not have an oven safe skillet for this so i used a very deep dish pie plate pouring the sugar mixture into it.  Worked very well. The dough may look thick but it will work out.  A staple for sure.

I thought this was very dry, even though I added more pineapple juice than than recipe called for.  The "cake" portion was like a dry biscuit consistency and very heavy.  I prefer the pineapple upside down cake v!

AMAZING !!! The batter was a little thick so I added a jar of baby applesauce (that's what I had on hand)and a 1/4 cup of pineapple juice. I did not have rum so I substituted Rum flavor instead. For more flavor I added 2 tsp. cinnamon a dash of nutmeg and allspice (this added lots of FLAVOR which I love) This is so SIMPLE and SO easy. I would recommend making this. Those who had problems with this recipe I suggest making a couple adjustments and trying again. That is what cooking is all about.

I made this in a 9x13 pan instead of the cast iron. I made 1 1/2 the amounts shown to make enough. I probably could have completely doubled it really. It tasted VERY good. I really love the way the top(which later becomes the bottom) gets a little crispy as it browns, it reminded me of the top of a blueberry muffin. This is my moms favorite cake and I made it for her birthday. She gave it a connoisseur's approval so it has to be pretty decent. Didn't have the cardamom, and maybe I don't know what I'm missing, but it was fine without it.

This was a huge crowd pleaser. I made it for 40+ people in a large stainless steel pan (didn't have the iron skillet). It still worked! the browned butter in the cake was to die for... Thank you Chef John for the video and the great recipe!

The upside-down pineapple portion was fantastic, but the cake portion left something to be desired. I baked it for 5 minutes less than the minimal baking time and it was overdone. I'd love to try this again with a different cake on the bottom. Overall it was still a good dessert as is.

I thought it was a very good cake but I am not sure why I didn't think it was excellent.  I didn't have a cast iron pan that was small enough to flip so I used a regular cake pan.  The cake did not stick to the bottom and I had no issues with the directions.  Perhaps the cake part needs a little something to make it shine.  The topping was great, even if I could only fit 1/4 of my pineapple on one layer (maybe next time I'll do 2 layers of pineapple even if it will be messy).  I'd make it again.  My son really liked it and I thought it was good.

Outstanding!  Be sure to watch the video for tips on ingredient combining and handling. My husband loves Pineapple USD Cake. He said this version was the best he had ever had. I agree. It was easy to make and didn’t last long!  If you are feeding a crowd better make two!
The dark rum cooks off leaving a hint of a taste that adds texture to the flavor.  I followed  the instructions exactly except I used dark brown sugar.

I liked the flavor of this cake, however the cake batter didn't have enough liquid in it and the cake came out dry and cracked. I guess I should have watched it closer and not baked it for the full time or maybe we just live in different climate than Chef John. Either way the flavor was there.

I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was wonderful but I found the cake to be rather dry. I only baked it for 25 minutes. If I try it again, I think I will use a 10 inch skillet, increase the amount of the butter/brown sugar sauce and perhaps add some oil to the cake batter. As I said, the flavor was spot on, just a little dry.

This was easy to make, everyone enjoyed it.

Given that the nearest store is a 30 min drive away and there wasn't any in my cupboard, I omitted the cardamom. I used 3/4 of a small fresh, slightly overripe pineapple.

Next time, I will cut down on the amount of butter in the batter; it left a noticeable taste, almost overpowering the pineapple.

This recipe was strangely laid out so I made an attempt to follow it to a T until I realized that the cake batter wasn't so much a batter as it was a dough  - almost comparable to a cakey cookie dough. I ended up adding a little more milk to thin it out - but it wasn't easy to spread. Thick in some spots, and thin in others, it separated in places, too, so it's unlikely to come out like an actual cake - it'll be more like a cobbler I'm anticipating. It's currently in the oven and I'm monitoring it closely because it is super thin in the cast iron (yes, the right sized pan), and I anticipate it will likely overcook in some places and undercook in others. I'm not optimistic about how this will turn out, so I'm curious as to whether there is a typo in the recipe, or if I missed something? I will update when it comes out.

Afterthoughts: So, the cake had more flavor than I expected given the reviews (I ground my own cardamom though) and for the first few hours after baking it was more crumbly than dry, but by the next day you could officially call it dry. It wasn't inedible, but it was disappointing, and since I can't quite see how you'd fix this recipe by making small changes to it, I'm dropping the rating to 2 stars because there's likely just something better out there that's worth the time, energy and ingredients. A for effort?

Made recipe as written but was extremely disappointed with the results. Cake portion was very dense and very bland. Not the light, flavorful cake I envisioned. Will not try this recipe again.

The flavors are good and I like to fact it has rum and pineapple juice in it.  But the cake was so dense it soaked up all the caramel goodness and couldn't find the gooey topping.

The first time I made it, I was in a hurry. So I didn't do the browning the butter step. The cake was good. The second time, I did it, carefully as Chef John says, and the cake is amazing! As soon as I put it in the oven, I started again, because I just know this cake won't last!!!

This is delicious! I did not have rum so I used a teaspoon of vanilla. I also used 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of cardamom. The browned butter makes a wonderful difference. Thanks Chef John!

My husband loved it.  It was a little dry but maybe I cooked it too long, though I tried to follow the recipe in timing.  Added some milk when serving it and it was like a coffee cake pudding, really good.

Tasty. Liked the browned butter in the cake batter. Hardly detected the cardamom, which was one of the things that made me choose this recipe.  Used 10.5" skillet vs. 12" and canned vs. fresh pineapple. Heading of recipe says cook time is 45 minutes, but detailed instructions say to bake for 30-35 minutes.  I guess they add the time for melting the sugar and butter? Batter seemed small for size of pan, and if I used 12", it would have been even thinner! I probably baked it a tad too long as cake part was a little dry. Served 8 generously. I think 12 servings would feel skimpy.

A couple of big changes to keep in mind for this review - I had to adapt the ingredient amounts for a 12 inch skillet (the only one I own for now), and I used cinnamon+nutmeg in place of cardamom.

So first, the pineapple flavor was marvelous and it wasn't cloyingly sweet like I've had before. The method is very easy/simple for a home cook and the results are incredible for the effort involved. However, and this is possible because I had to adapt ingredients for the 12-inch skillet, my cake was a little on the dry side.

All that said, this recipe was tasty and beautiful before my family devoured it!

Excellent!!  Made it just as Chef John wrote (after watching the video and reading comments from other raters).  Used fresh pineapple (from Costa Rica - very yummy!), dark rum, sugar, butter, etc., and followed all the steps.  SO GOOD!  Would not change a thing. Thank you Chef John!!

I never made any pineapple upside down cake before. And I didn't expect the cake to be that sweet, especially after tasting a little batter. From the sweetness of the fruit and brown sugar, it is understandable that the cake is not as sweet as a regular cake. They compliment each other. I substituted a pinch of of ginger and lemon peel for the cardamon, which I didn't have. I decided to bake it only 20 minutes since I read the reviews of the cake being too dry and my new oven is overly efficient by 5 minutes or 25 degrees. Turned out very good and moist. I will wait to see how my husband likes it. He will be my true rating! Glad to have tried it.

I loved the fresh pineapple and brown sugar mixture.  I used Captain Morgan and orange juice because my fresh pineapple didn't have any juice.  The cake, however, was quite dry but I guess I should have known that by reading the other reviews.  Not sure what have been better but I"ll use another recipe for the cake part next time.  Sorry this wasn't a very good review, but it's my honest opinion.

This was surprisingly easy but sadly I too found the cake rather dry.  It's not bad, the wife seems to like it judging by the speed of disappearing slices. But she agrees that it is a bit dry.
I will do this one again with minor modifications.

Wow!  This is my favorite recipe for "Pineapple Upside-down Cake"... I'm surprised at some of the low reviews or those that said dry.  I admit I used canned and maybe that's where the extra moisture came from but I'm wondering if some with problems with this recipe were from pineapple that wasn't ripe/juicy enough.  I haven't had the "rum" since I don't usually have alcohol on hand but I've used rum extract (1/2 tsp) along with enough pineapple juice to equal a tablespoon... The brown butter flavor is what really sets this off along with the cardommon...  I'm an experienced baker who know's what she likes so I used maraschino cherries in mine as well.. :)  Thanks Chef John!

I've made this three times. It's better than Cats. I want to make it again and again...If you had a hard time with sticking, you probably didn't fully cover the bottom with pineapples, I had a little sticking this last time and that was the reason.

It was awesome, I did make some changes after reading all the reviews. I added more butter to the cake batter and in the brown sugar mixture.  I also soaked dried tart cherries in the rum and put them around the pineapple chunks.  When I make it again and I definitely will, I will double the cake batter and put more rum soaked cherries on it. Truly amazing !!

Thank you Chef John! I took the advice of a few who said it was dry and added a few tablespoons of pineapple juice to the batter. I also used canned pineapple instead of fresh. It took a long time for my butter to brown....so i turned the heat up being sure not to burn it. I also used a slightly smaller cast iron skillet....mine is only 9" at the bottom and 10 1/2" at the top. The cake part was nice because it was not overly sweet. It was difficult to find a pineapple upside down cake that did not call for a disgusting boxed cake mix. Yuck. This tasted like real home cooking. Grandparents, and children devoured!

Pineapple and brown sugar caramel is to die for, although I wouldn't have minded a touch more rum!! Easy release if your skillet is well seasoned and don't wait the full 10 minutes. Turn out a few minutes after removing from oven. Also I agree with the other reviewers....cake seemed a bit dry and not the most flavorful but definitely good! I would add pineapple juice or more milk....or just find a better batter recipe. Sorry I would have add added a photo since it is such a pretty cake...but we already ate 2 slices!

It looked just like the picture--it was beautiful, but it turned out quite dry. I cooked it even less time than mentioned in the recipe, but it was quite crumbly and dry. I may give it another try because it looked so nice. . .

Absolutely delicious of course. Sometimes I make this substituting the pineapple for peaches. Peach Upside Down cake is also delish using this recipe. Next I'll try ... apple upside down cake?

This cake is fabulous! I added 1/3 cup pineapple juice and 1/3 cup crushed pineapples to the cake batter because it was too thick to even scoop out of my bowl. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T and couldn't wait to taste it once I smelled the pineapple from the oven!

Awesome. I didn't have enough brown sugar, but used a cane sugar and honey substitute which blended extremely well with all the other flavors. the only thing I was concerned about was the amount of batter. I had a REALLY hard time getting it to cover all of the pineapple and when it did I had bits of pineapple sticking through. Next time, I'm definitely going to make a little bit more batter next time. Other than that, when all was said and done, it's a super delicious recipe that I will definitely try again.

The syrup and the pineapple are excellent, but the cake bread is not that good.
