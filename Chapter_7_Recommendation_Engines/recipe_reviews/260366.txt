I used all fresh ingredient.  Had no marinated artichoke hearts so I used some oil/vinegar and Italian seasonings to soak fresh veggies for 4 hours.  Then the recipe as written.  Everyone at the potluck loved it and it was all gone.

This is w/o a doubt the best casserole I've ever made. Here's where I differed from the recipe: 
*Edit: It seems strange that 8 oz of cream cheese is mentioned twice, separately. I made this w only one 8 oz Cream Cheese, and feel pretty sure that is how it's supposed to be. Only use one 8 ounce package.
-I didn't include spinach so I put in more mushrooms (6-8 ounces is good!) 
-I didn't have garlic powder, so I used 1/2 tsp garlic salt instead. 
-I made it using only a microwave, toaster oven, and stove top! Ran out of propane, and didn't have time to wait for delivery; so I was left finding a recipe I could make w/o oven. -Not completely necessary, but well worth it: used the toaster oven to toast 3 slices cubed plain wheat bread, which I drizzled drawn butter on after toasting. Added to the top of casserole after done cooking in microwave.) 
-Used one beef bullion cube in a cup of hot water. (that's the only broth I had on hand.)
-my 9X13 casserole is aluminum, so I had to make this in halves using my square glass 8"x8" (20cmx20cm) in the microwave (so I wouldn't start a fire.)
Veggie ingredients should be as dried out as possible b4 cooking in microwave, so it doesn't end up watery. I started off drying the asparagus and artichokes together by heating in microwave in 3 minute spurts, then tossing, repeat. Keep mushrooms separate from asp & artichokes, bc you need the shrooms to be in the saucepan while melting cream cheese in heavy whipping cream and 1 cup broth.  I dried

I was put off by the photo, but this is an amazing keto casserole!  I followed it exactly as written and it's a keeper!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this with half and half instead of heavy whipping cream to lower the fat. I took it to a ladies meeting and got rave reviews, asked for the recipe, and to bring it again.

Per notes I used fresh garlic which I sauteed in butter along with 1/2 of a large yellow onion.  I then added the spinach/mushroom mixture to my pan (after microwaving for 5 min) and sauteed together for a minute of two before adding the broth, cream cheese, whipping cream and seasoning.  It was great as a meal and it would likely make a great dip if you chopped the asparagus.

I made no changes. It was tasty enough. This seems to be a side dish & requires a steak or pork chop, chicken or beef patty to go with it. Probably won't make it again, as I like to have a complete 1 meal dish that includes some meat protein.
