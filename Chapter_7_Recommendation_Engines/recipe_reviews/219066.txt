This is my own recipe, and these were MY instructions about the caramel:

"Add the sugar to the metal pan and melt over the stove at low-medium heat moving it with a wooden spoon until golden color. Turn the heat off a little before the desired color as it will continue to darken and it will burn if you are not careful. Very carefully and using oven mitts, swirl pan around while sugar is still soft to cover bottom and sides. It will get thicker as it cools and eventually harden as a lollipop. Set pan aside to cool." 

The recipe was changed by the website; Im ok with that, however the reasons I do the caramel straight into the pan are: 1) melted sugar is VERY hot and the less transfer the better 2) one less pot to clean.

If you must use a separate pot (for ex. for ramekins), then I suggest a heavy non-stick saucepan with a good non-metal handle instead of a skillet. The melted sugar will flow out better.

I also DONT use a towel under the pan. Im sure it doesn't afect the quality of the final product; you decide how to do the 'baine Marie' (baño de María in Spanish).
Hope you like my recipe!!!

I love the rich simplicity of flans. This is an excellent, creamy and rich coconut flan. My guests loved it and I was able to make it ahead so it was a quick and impressive dessert on the fly. The only change I made was to bake in individual custard cups. Thanks for sharing this lovely and delicious dessert Milly.

I have this flan in the oven right now.  The batter tastes heavenly!  I used coconut extract (1 Tablespoon) as I didn't have any coconut-flavored rum in the house, and didn't really want to face any stores on Christmas Eve. I also added 2 Tablespoons instead of 2 teaspoons of vanilla, simply because I like a really strong flavor.  

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, well 2 reasons actually, and I may come back and modify later, but the first is I haven't actually finished it or eaten it yet, but so far, by all accounts it is shaping up just beautifully!  My ONLY problem is that the amount of flan mixture is much too much for my 9-inch round by 3.5-inch high baking dish, and I had to make a second batch of caramel and divide it into 2 separated flans....Maybe this is just my experience but the mixture filled my dish to the brim, and I was afraid of it being too thick, and spilling over, so I used a 2nd pan and divided the mixture to make 2 flans. :)  Thanks for the recipe!

PERFECT! I loved it. I always make the caramel in the microwave (not the ideal way, but it works). 1 cup sugar + 1/2 cup water in a pyrex. 15 minutes later (microwaves are all different though) I've got the perfect colored amber caramel. I bought just one 8oz block of cream cheese because I didn't pay attention, so I used that and it was still great. I loved the flavor, the texture, the consistency, the ease to make...everything. I only had an 8 X 3 pan, so it ended up taller (thicker) and therefore I had to bake about 30 min longer. No biggie. Thank you for yet another delicious recipe, Milly!

Excellent recipe! I made some changes though. I did not have evaporated milk or coco lopez (had only coconut milk). Instead I used 200 ml of fresh cream, 11/2 cups milk and half cup of pineapple concentrate. Also I made a topping of sweetened coconut flavoured with pineapple by stir frying 1 cup of freshly grated coconut with a tablespoon of butter, few tablespoonfuls of pineapple juice, sufficient sugar to taste and 3 tablespoonfuls of white rum until semi dry. Everybody loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was a big hit at the party I brought it to.  I didn't have coconut milk so I used regular milk and it came out just fine.

Excellent!! everyone loved it... I did make a few changes.. I toasted coconut flakes about 1/2 a cup and sprinkled it on top as i put the dish for baking.  Then I served it with more toasted coconut flakes on top and caned sapota slices on the base. it looked marvelous and tasted incredible. the coconut  and the sapota gave it  texture to chew.
thanks for this incredible recipe...just don't count the calories!

Too many ingrediants. I couldnt fit it all in my blender and what I could fit ended up over filling my pan. It tasted eggy but with a little bit more vanilla and sweetner and a lil less eggs im sure it could have more potential.

My family came to the house to have an enchilada dinner with everything made from scratch.  I wanted to make an authentic spanish dessert and found this recipe.  This was my first time ever making or even having flan and I'm glad I chose this one to make.  It was a huge success.  I did add a couple of small twists though.  Instead of the coconut rum I used coconut extract (same measurement).  And I topped the flan with shredded coconut before I baked it.  YUMM     I also cut the fat grams a little by using any fat free ingredients that I could.

By far the best flan I've ever made! I'm Cuban and we make flans all the time. Unbelievably creamy with just a hint of coconut. I made it for Easter and I should have made 2 ..everyone absolutely loved it!! Thank you for this amazing recipe that I will keep on making!

If you had asked me Saturday night to review this when I was making it, it wouldn't have been a good review. Everything went wrong starting with the Caramel and ending with my flan not cooking to the point of being done. I tried the Caramel on the stove, and in my fear of burning it I took it off too soon and it made an awful mess of my glass pans. I tried it in the microwave as another user recommended. I microwaved the 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup water for about 12 minutes. Unfortunately I overcooked it slightly and burned myself quite badly, but I wasn't going to try making it again. I spread in my pans and finally got everything in the oven. I baked flan for 1 hour then added another 30 minutes and flans still weren't set (and I split batter into 2 smaller pans than what recipe calls for) I wanted nothing more than to go to bed, so I turned oven off and left flan in there. I fully expected to be throwing away the flan in the morning. To my utter surprise leaving it in the oven had finished cooking it. I put it in the fridge and unearthed it a few hours later. And it was one of the most delicious desserts ever! I loved it. And even after all the hassle I went through, I will make it again. It's super  yummy!!

Made this exactly as per the recipe. It’s delicious! I’m Puerto Rican and don’t like thin traditional flans. I prefer more of a quesillo. This recipe is just right if you prefer that thicker consistency. YUM!!!!!

I made the recipe as written, with two changes: 
1. I made the caramel the way I always do, in the microwave.
2. I cooked the flan in the pressure cooker.

This made a bit much for the pan I usually  use, so I put about two cups aside and made three small mini cake pans of flan in addition to the large one.

One other thing--I mixed with an electric mixer, not a blender.

The flavor and texture were superb! Be aware that it is not as golden as the usual flan--the color is more off-white than the usual eggy yellow. Don't be alarmed. It tastes fantastic. I garnished with toasted grated coconut.

I  will be making this for a family reunion this weekend and I know my cousins will love it!

Not a review but a comment.  Could you please provide details for pan size?  I did not have a "large" glass pan that was round like the picture, so I used a bundt pan since I saw pictures of other flans in bundt shape.  Big mistake!  The unbaked flan seeped through the edges of the bundt pan and onto the floor of my oven!  So instead of enjoying this delicious sounding dessert I spent the evening cleaning an oven.  Please help out us amateurs and be specific!

Beautiful dessert.  Texture and flavor more like cheesecake. Coconut flavor is very mild.  
Also - cooks up a big batch, so be ready with a big dish for baking.  And using an emersion blender blends everything at once very easilly.
Thank you for sharing.
