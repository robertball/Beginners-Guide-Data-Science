We enjoyed this recipe--my husband ate seconds and didn't complain. I followed the recipe as best I could, but omitted the soy sauce as we didn't have any. I also used elbow macaroni instead of rotini because that's what I had, but I really don't think that changes anything. Overall, I think this is a great meal. 

The only change I would make is to stir the taco seasoning in the milk before it's added to the pasta.

I felt like is was maybe a good base but it needs more flavor. I'm not even sure what seasonings though.

The mix is really salty. It was easy to make. I will make it again, but will add my own seasonings and not a packaged taco seasoning. I added 1/2 cup cream cheese to give it some more creamy flavor. I also added jalapeños and rooster sauce to the  top of the bowls. was a nice touch if you  like a little more spicy flavor.

I followed the recipe but I added black beans, corn, and Rotella. It turned out amazing! I definitely will be making this again.

As someone else said, this is a good base, but I thought the taco mix was way too much and overpowered the dish.  Next time I would omit that and put in my own blend of spices with less chili pepper and cumin.  Also could keep chili out of it all together and add peas and parmesan cheese.

Very good... followed as written but halved since it was only two of us.  Did add some green pepper as suggested by one of the reviewers; also added a can of dice tomatoes.  I also omitted the soy sauce.  Drained cooked pasta and then added half cup skim milk, about 3 oz.  velvetta and some cheddar cheese.  My husband said he really enjoyed this.

This was really easy and very good! I used ground hamburger and medium cheddar cheese and added pepper as well as a can of diced tomatoes. I am not sure if I used an entire 1/4 cup of soy sauce (I poured and counted to 8 hahahha). I'll be making this again.

It's good, but I would either use half of the soy sauce or none at all. It's all I taste in it. With that said a fun easy recipe to play with.

I put in a tablespoon of Soy Sauce after reading all the reviews on it being to salty.  It was really good that  way and the kids loved it.  I'll try 2 tablespoons next time.

Way to salty! I think the soy sauce with the taco seasoning was a little to much.

Thanks for posting, but I found it very salty. I think if I were to do it again I would not add the soya sauce
