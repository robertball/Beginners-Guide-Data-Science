good for how easy it was to make, I added ground ginger for some extra taste. Next time I think I will add peanut butter and chili garlic sauce

This was a simple recipe that looked gorgeous as it caramelized and tasted almost as good.  I didn't have any sesame seeds so I added a splash of sesame oil and then after the chicken cooked I drizzled a few extra drops over the chicken.  Also, I used chicken pieces on the bone (a whole chicken cut into 8 pieces) and I think because it took almost twice as long to cook the glaze benefitted from the extra time and turned a deep color.  Beautiful.  My teenage son and my husband scarfed down the whole chicken (a single wing leftover) and used the extra glaze/pan drippings (which I defatted with my defatter cup) over the rice and broccoli and chicken on the plate.  I give this 5 stars, but next time I might add a crushed garlic clove or two.  Thanks!

Ridiculously easy to make and very very good.  I only had a little bit of honey so I did 1/4 cup honey but added 1/4 cup of maple syrup.  I also salted and peppered the chicken before I added the sauce.  The result was spectacular.  Everyone loved it and I will be making this again.  A recipe does not have to be complicated to be good.  The only thing I will do next time is flip over the chicken during cooking so it can soak in the flavor on both sides.  When done don't dump the juice, use it as a sauce for rice or some other side.  Yummy.

My family really liked this recipe but I did make some changes.  I used half soy sauce and half teryaiki sauce to make up the 1/4c. in the recipe.  I also added fresh diced ginger and used orange juice instead of lemon juice.  I used this mixture to dip the chicken into and then sprinkled the sesame seeds on top.  I then added 1 tbsp. of cornstarch to the mixture and heated it until thick.  This was the sauce I spooned over the chicken before putting it into the oven.  It was really good served with broccoli and rice.

REALLY good recipe! I just eyeballed the quantities. Also added some grated fresh ginger and garlic. I just poured the mixture over chicken thighs. I spooned the mixture over the chicken every 10 mins while it cooked, and it turned out juicy and flavorful! VERY quick and tasty. Will for sure make again.

This just plain wasn't very good. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good, either. I did it stove top, since I didn't want my boneless, skinless breasts to get dried out in the oven, and thought the sauce might have a chance to thicken and coat better in a skillet. It just just sweet. Didn't have any flavor other than sweet. I subbed rice wine vinegar for the lemon juice thinking it would be more authentic. Just.. blah.

Yummy and easy. I am a lazy cook, so I just poured the sauce over frozen chicken breasts and cooked for an hour.

I liked the way the sauce tasted, but it didn't stick to the chicken at all.  It made a huge mess in the pan, too.

For a quick meal it was pretty good with a couple of tweaks.  I decided to fix it on the stove top in a non stick pan.  I started with the ingredients as written, heated sauce tasted and then added about 2 Tbs peanutbutter, 1 Tbs sweet chili sauce, would have added fresh Ginger but didn't have any, then added a dash of 5 spice.  Once I got the sauce flavorful I added the cut chicken thighs and sautéd until chicken was done and sauce was nice and sticky.  Served with grilled asparagus over rice.

My girls are getting tired of chicken lately, but this recipe got a request that it gets made next week again.  Very little prep time.  Easily doubled or tripled for company.  This is a keeper!!

We liked this but I would have liked it better if the sauce was thick.  It never "glazed" for me.  Instead, it was very thin.  I will make it again but I will cook the sauce first and thicken it with cornstarch before pouring it over the chicken.

The sauce was good before I cooked it.  The only thing is I tried to convert this into a crockpot recipe because I get home late and lost a lot of the flavor in the long cooking time.  Will definately try again in the oven.

very good. we both loved it, I drizzled a bit of the left over sauce on the chicken before putting it in the oven, next time I will use all of the left over sauce this way, it was so tasty and it went very well with our stir fried veggies.

This was not so good.  I added garlic to the sauce and marinated it over night, cooked the chicken in the sauce and served it over rice.  No one in the family like it. I will not make again.

The chicken did not absorb enough of the flavor to make this worth while.  If I make it again, I will definitely let it marinade overnight.  For a quick and easy meal it was decent.

I made this tonight with "Vegetable Lo Mein Delight" that I got on this site and Asian rice crackers. I thought this chicken was good, but I was looking for something that tasted more like chinese food.  I added more sauce after it came out of the oven.

Very very yummy and super easy! I actually would have given it 5 stars, but I accidentally used Worcester sauce instead of soy sauce, so it didn't caramelize enough. Still yummy though!

The first time I made this, I loved the flavour, but didn't like that the sauce seemed thin. Still, I would give it four stars. To make it even better, though, here's what I do: (1) remove from oven, (2) remove chicken and pour sauce into pan, (3) bring to a boil, (4) mix together 1/4 c cold water and 1 1/2 tbsp flour and whisk into the boiling sauce, (5) cook until thickened and pour over chicken.  You may have to adjust the amount of flour, depending on the desired thickness and amount of sauce.

Yum! This was very good, and SO easy! I basted the chicken with the leftover sauce a couple of times during cooking, making sure to get all the sesame seeds on the chicken. This is definitely a keeper recipe that I will make again. I took the leftover chicken from dinner, cut into small pieces, and added chopped celery, some pecan pieces, and a little bit of mayo, making a wonderful chicken salad for the next day, too!

After adding a dash or two of ginger and garlic, the marinade was pretty good, however, it was very watery and didn't coat the chicken well. I felt like I wasted the majority of the seasame seeds and soy mixture. Also, the marinade ran off the chicken while cooking and burned onto the pan and scorched the chicken. Also, I used chicken tenderloins because that cut down the prep time. Needless to say, this was a very messy meal and I don't think it is worth making again.

This recipe needs something added maybe some more honey. I like the idea of ginger but my family is real picky.  Keeping this for experimenting.

Very tasty and very easy.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I doubled recipe and could have cut down the cooking time by ten minutes so watch when you are cooking.  Served it with Divine Asparagus and brown rice for Mother's Day.  I made all the mothers happy!

I added peanut butter, chili sauce, Sriracha and cubed the chicken and marinated it in the refrigerator for about an hour prior to cooking. I served over basmati rice. Very yummy and flavorful. This one is a keeper!

This was good.  I made it with homemade soy sauce.  It turned out very tasty.  I liked the idea of the sticky coating from the honey, but this was a lil too honey tasting fr me.  I will be making again with some personal adjustments.  The recipe was exactly what I was looking for!  Thank you so much for sharing :)

Directions say to "dip" the chicken into the sauce and then "place" it into the baking sheet, so all that sauce gets wasted if the recipe is followed exactly. Instead, I plopped the chicken into the sauce, swirled it around, and then dumped everything into the baking sheet. I couldn't bring myself to waste all the leftover sauce. Smells awesome while cooking! Decent flavor. Not completely satisfied with the end result. It wasn't as sweet as I had anticipated. It's just "meh."

I am giving this 4 stars because my daughter loved it, but the sauce did not stick to the chicken and it was way too sweet. Next time I wont add so much honey. Over all it was good

So good!  The sauce does come out somewhat runny, not thick and goopy like restaurant Sesame Chicken, but I think that's a good thing-- spooning it over rice is a lot easier.  I'd also recommend sprinkling the sesame seeds on top of the chicken in the pan, rather than mixing it into the sauce/marinade.  Finally, make sure you have friends or family to share it with, otherwise you may be tempted to eat it all yourself!

I made a GREAT mistake with this and I thought I'd share. I grabbed the teriyaki sauce out of my fridge instead of the soy sauce- it tasted just like what my husband and I get at the local chinese except it isn't as crunchy because it isn't fried. I also made fried rice to go alongside this. I made the rice with additional honey+teriyaki sauce and it was great. Next time I think I will cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces and just toss it with the fried rice.

The sauce does not stick to the chicken and  is thin. Would be better if it thickened up a bit. I made this twice and even the second time it wasn't that good when I made it a little bit differently.

This was so easy!  This is a fantastic dish that is very flavorful. The next best thing to "fried" sesame chicken!

I added a bit too much lemon (couldn't waste all that Meyer lemon!!!) & had to thicken it up w/corn starch but I think it worked out better that way the second time!  My honey loved it over rice...

Tried this recipe and my husband and guests loved it.  Definitely will make it again.  Great way to use chicken thighs.  I served it with Chinese style fried rice and it made a great meal.

VERY Easy and tasty if you are in a hurry. Tastes sort of like teriyaki. My family loved it. I will definitely make it again.

Honestly, I wasn't to "wowed" by this dish. The picture made it look great, but then I didn't like the taste. Certainly not one of my favorites.

This wasn't very good. The chicken had hardly any flavour at all. I ended up covering it with BBQ sauce just to give it some taste.

I didn't care for this much. My boyfriend said he loved it, but no one ate the leftovers. It was very simple to make which I love. It just didn't have the flavor I was looking for.
