I used pillsbury crusts and added a little more brown sugar. I also added vanilla to the meringue.
It turned out very good. If you like butterscotch this is worth a try

This is an amazing recipe.  Cook on med-low and no double boilder is needed.  Tastes just like the old fashioned Butterscotch Pies from long ago.

I was hoping that this would be like my grandma's recipe - and it was similar, but not the same.  Overall, the recipe is good - the texture is nice.  It is not overly sweet - in fact if I were to make it again, I would probably add 1/4-1/2 cup of brown sugar as I like my Butterscotch Pie really sweet.  I followed the ingredients exactly and only changed the process (I did not use a double boiler - just used a pot and stirred the whole time - tempering the eggs and adding them at the appropriate time.)  I took the pie to a party and everyone liked it.  My custard did weep a bit, and the meringue shrunk and wept (although it was touching all around) so it was not pretty - but tasted good!

This is a great butterscotch cream pie! I've started making it for family thanksgiving for the past few years! It turns out beautifully and tastes delicious. Didn't change a thing! Don't be shy to make it...it isn't as complicate or difficult as it may look. Just take your time and watch the meringue in the oven so it doesn't over bake.

YUM. This came out super perfect. The only addition I had to the instructions was to cool the filling slightly before you add to the pie crust, this way your crust will not get mushy. Thanks so much for this super recipe! I made if for Christmas for my father in law who loved it!

What ever you do, do not let any of the yolk or any other fatty substance into the meringue.  Wash all utensils and the bowl before whisking.  Even a little yolk ruins the meringue.#2  make sure the pie filling is good and thick.  Also, the pie filling should still be hot when you cover with the meringue.  All lessons learned on the first try.

I did not make any changes and though I let the pudding cook with bubbles for over 5 minutes before adding egg yolks, the texture and taste detected the flour.  I would not make this recipe again.

This is perfect but i added a little more brown sugar and NEVER use self-rising flower because that makes it taste horrible.

Awesome pie, I will say I did make a double recipie as I wanted a full pie.  I was surprised I used it all, none left for the custard cups. I did not need 12 egg whites, 9 would have been plenty. My pie is the current featured picture on my cooktop grate

This was my first time making a pie from scratch. Ever.
My husband asked for a butterscotch pie, so I decided to give it a shot.
I had to read the directions several times, and take it slow to make sure I understood the instructions.
It turned out great and my husband LOVED it!
As a joking side note, I am not so sure that Northern girls can make a proper meringue!

This one didn't set.  The filling was runny and there was a lot of clear liquid in the bottom.  I'm giving it three stars because we ate it like pudding and it had a good taste.  The only change that I made was to add more brown sugar than the recipe called for.  I will be searching for another butterscotch pie to try.
