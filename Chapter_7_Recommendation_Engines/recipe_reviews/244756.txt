Used more berries and with 1 tsp cinnamon - tossed 1/4 cup cane sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon and flour with the berries.  Then used less brown sugar in the topping.  Delish!

Easy to make but tasted just ok. Nothing special. I added some cardamom to the crumble topping, but couldn't taste it. Next time I have a lot of blackberries to use up, I'd try cinnamon and pecans or slivered almonds in the topping.

Did anyone else notice that the recipe calls for berries to be tossed in 1/4 cup of flour? I have never made any crisp before, so I followed this recipe to the T...I reread it over and over thinking this doesnt sound right. The 1/4 cup flour must be a mistake. It left an unmixed flour coating on the bottom.  Change the 1/4 cup flour to sugar and make add something like a few tsps of water and it would be better.

Great recipe! Easy to prepare exactly as written. I used fresh blackberries and had to have it with whipped cream. My husband had only one criticism, I hadn't sweetened the blackberries! Lol

Very simple recipe and quite delicious.   I put mine under the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end of the baking time and this gave the crisp a beautiful coloring on top.

It was a good recipe and was tasty but shouldn't have been less flour. Felt a bit like paste.

While this is super yummy, it is also too sugary for me.  It's probably because I only had 2 cups of blackberries/blueberries, but followed the recipe anyway.  I'm going to  try using the correct 4 cups of fruit next time because I plan on making this again - It's delicious even with the sugar overload!

Incredible. I couldn't stop eating it. Add sugar or Slenda to berries before baking, about 1/2 cup. Then double topping. I really tasty dessert with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

We live in Oregon and harvested 20 pounds of blackberries last fall. I have been making this recipe at least once a week since then and it is absurdly good. My tweaks are adding a cup of finely chopped walnuts and some cinnamon to the topping, but it's also phenomenal as is. We also prefer brown sugar for the sugar in the topping. I'll make this recipe for the rest of my life.

Added a bit of cinnamon and softened the hard butter in the microwave 20 seconds making it quicker and easier to blend the topping vs using a pastry cutter. Instead of putting all the topping just on the top, I blended it together with the berries creating a tasty hot mess. It was a yummy use of our local berries picked. I like the idea of tossing the 1/4 cup flour with the berries to help soak up some of the juiciness. Also added some extra oats as my berries were a bit overly ripe.  Draped it lightly with aluminum foil over the top midway during baking so it wouldnt brown up too much. I would make this again.

This came out fabulous! The other one I made  (also from this site, ? Grandpa Johnâ€™s ) was much too sweet and too much juice. This one coats the blackberries in flour instead of sugar . Less juice and much more flavor!

After picking the berries, I made this with one variation using Chef John's idea to add 1/4 c. sugar to the berries with the flour. Then added the crisp and it turned out awesome topped with ice cream . In fact, my husband went back for a second serving.

Excellent. I saw the comment about it being too sweet so I reduced the brown sugar by about 25%. Turned out plenty sweet, just right.
