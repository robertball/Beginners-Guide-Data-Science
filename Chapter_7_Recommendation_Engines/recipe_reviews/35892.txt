Some tips to make it more authentic. Use fresh, spicy chilies. Use galangal/Thai ginger, not regular ginger. Use holy basil/Thai basil not the Italian basil. Use regular oil, not olive oil.

Lovely! Tastes very authentic. Use holy basil if available for the killer taste. I also tried adding more red pepper flakes and then realized I should just use chilli powder instead to bring more colour and bring up the spice level...and yes it did the trick! Added broccoli and red peppers to make this a definite make again dish! :)

This was ok, but unfortunately I couldn't taste of wonderful flavors of basil or cocunut milk very much... just salt.  I'm sure it was due to the fish sauce (check out the sodium content on the bottle!) so if I were to make this again I would just omit it.  Any flavor it may impart is not worth that huge amount of salt!  I did use low-sodium soy sauce and added a little extra coconut milk.  I'm sure this would be really good if it weren't so darn salty.  I even reduced the amount of fish sauce to one TBS!  I used a red onion, which added nice color.  Served with brown jasmine rice and steamed green beans.

My boyfriend adored this recipe and I thought it was pretty good.  I used a whole can of coconut milk because I hate having open cans in my fridge.  I think next time I will cook the chicken in the sauce.  I usually do that but decided to follow the recipe this time.  I believe that cooking the chicken in the sauce will make it more flavorful and tender (I've found it usually does).  Plus, you'd be cutting down on calories and fat that way.

I loved this dish. Others commented on it not being authentic . . . who cares! Authenticity is not the issue, taste is, and this dish tastes great. Now, that being said, I had to be creative to get this dish to turn out here in Bolivia. In place of fish sauce, I used 1 T anchovy paste and 1 T oyster sauce. I added broccoli, didn't have green onions, used coconut paste (no coconut milk), and tweaked the measurements of the other ingredients to compensate for the sweetness of the coconut paste. My wife was not a fan of the spice (I thought it was perfect) but my 2 year old couldn't get enough! I will definitely make this again. Maybe I'll pull some aside for my wife without spice.

Definitely NOT the authentic Thai basil chicken, because the real one is not soupy like this and much much more spicy.  However, I still give it a five star, and just think of it as chicken basil curry.  The amount of basil seems a lot, but I still think the dish can use more basil flavor.  As soon as my basils grow out, I will make this again, but either use more fresh basil, or add some dry basil too.  And if you like your Thai food spicy, make sure to add extra extra red pepper flakes.

Improvements - used whole can of coconut milk (not just 3/4 cup), more soy and fish sauce (about a teaspoon more of each), 4 tablespoons of sugar (really balances the heat), added water chestnuts, more shiitake, added the sauce before chicken was browned (why dry it out before getting that good flavor in it?) and added cashews (love the taste with coconut milk).  With these additions I loved it.  Really tastes like the good Thai restaurant dish, yum...

I didn't bother with the coconut milk. This is a good stir-fry recipe. Don't be put off by the seemingly large amount of basil--when it cooks, it loses pungency. I also added a large handful of chopped cilantro. Use lots of ginger--peel the skin off with a vegetable peeler.

I made this with 2 large chicken breasts (no clue how much they weighed). I followed the recipe exactly otherwise, but ended up adding a little more soy sauce, and quite a lot more red pepper flakes. To be honest, I wasn't sure if it was even going to make it to the table (the flavor was just really peculiar, plus it didn't help I was making it with the most flavorless, watery coconut milk I have ever bought) but as soon as I added the basil, it really came together. I only wish I'd been able to get Thai basil at the store. With a couple of tweaks, this could be really amazing. Thanks, Gabrielle!

Hmmm...I'm a little puzzled by this recipe.  All of the ingredients I love, and yet lacking something.  Hard to put my finger on.  I definitely added more red pepper flakes, I like a punch to my thai, and added lots of fresh basil, love that flavor.  I guess I have to blame it on the sauce, I would add more soy, perhaps some fresh squeezed lime.  I also added fresh red pepper strips.  A pretty dish, good reviews from my hubby, but not a do over for me.  I sincerely thank you for your submission and enjoyed trying this recipe.

This was really good!  Instead of the red pepper I added a teaspoon of fresh red chili pepper sauce (really HOT) that I got from an Asian market.  I also did Thai holy basil from my garden instead of sweet basil. Definately add 1 to 2 tbsp. of sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We gave this recipe 5 Stars with a few changes based on our personal taste. We like spicey so we increased the red pepper flake, added Hot Pepper Sesame oil, added a bit more soy sauce and added curry.  We left out the fish sauce only because it has preservatives in it and I couldn't bring myself to buy it (I have the health curse of reading labels and staying clear of chemicals!) The flavor of this dish was delicious.  We added red bell pepper and extra basil, the presentation was great with the colors!  Next time we make this recipe we are going to use prawns and aspargus instead of chicken; we feel those two changes will put this recipe "over the top."  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe.

This recipe was very good - loved by 3/4 of my family (you were never gonna get the 4th with this one, so don't feel bad). I love Thai food, but I don't go out for it very often and I had never ordered this dish, so I'm not so picky about it's authenticity - just picky about "good," and it is. It was a little salty for me, so I added more coconut milk. I also used about 1lb of mushrooms instead of 3, cuz I love them, and 1 can of julienned bamboo shoots. Thanks for the recipe - we'll be having it again.

I love the basil dishes in the Thai restaurants here and it killed me that I didn't know how it was made - til now!  This is definitely a 5 star recipe but I did this slightly diferently which brings it up to 10, for me. First, instead of coconut milk, I used coconut cream (which I got at the asian market). It is quite high in saturated fat, but so is the milk anyway, and it's not like I'm eating this everyday. But the cream is so much more rich and creamy and brings in a depth of flavor that the milk cannot.  I also got the Thai basil there instead of using regular basil. I think the Thai is a little more subtle and not as overpowering as regular basil might be.  And I didn't use the whole amount either, more like a cup. I also did what the restaurants do too: used white mushrooms, quartered and sliced zucchini and chinese eggplant (which I added during the last few minutes since they don't take much time). Finally, I personally like a lot of sauce to sop up with the rice (which I serve on the side rather than underneath - just persnal preference), so instead of letting the sauce reduce, I actually cover the saucepan.  This not only steams the vegetables and cooks things a little faster, but adds to the amount of liquid.  Then, to thicken it up, I just use a couple tsp of cornstarch mixed with a small amount of cold water. This dish turned out just as good, if not better, than the restaurants!  So thank you, Gabrielle for submitting this...I could just kiss you!  lol

Unlike some other reviewers I thought there was a lot of flavor.  I only used about 3/4 cup of the basil, because I was reluctant, but shouldn't have been.  More would've been good.  Also, added about 1/2 of a red pepper (to use it up) and splashed fresh lime.  Yummy!

I adapted this for my vegetarian daughter by stir frying tofu in sesame oil and garlic until firm and browned. After sauteeing the vegetables, I added the tofu and liquid (reduced the fish sauce and used Thai chili garlic paste) added basil and simmered until it was reduced 1/3. Excellent!

This is very good! I followed the directions except I used lite coconut milk and added extra basil - as other reviewers suggested. I made this and separated in 2 (while cooking) because my mom doesn't like anything spicy and I love it spicy.  I also added extra red pepper flakes. We both loved it.  This has a very good flavor.  YUMMY!!!!

WOW!  I didn't expect this recipe to yield such a wonderful result!  Follow your own rice cooking instructions, though.  I used a high quality fish sauce (and upped it to 2 TBS) and at the last minute, elected to dump the entire can of lowfat coconut milk in.  The sauce really reduces to almost nothing when the other ingredients are incorporated.  I used 2 c of leftover rotisserie chicken and threw it in at the last minute so it wouldn't be overcooked.  Add plenty of Basil.  YUM!

GREAT recipe: but with a few modifications... I added a combo of crushed dried Thai chiles and Sriracha sauce instead of red pepper flakes. I also added more ginger and garlic, more soy sauce, and most importantly I added Kaffir Lime leaves!!!! Just those 4 lime leaves added a huge burst of authentice flavor (which makes up for the fact that I only had italian sweet basil - not holy basil). Good luck & Enjoy!

I'm a new mom and don't have much time to cook. I made this the other night for my husband and it was really easy (just a lot of chopping) and delicious! My husband really liked it, and he's more of a meat and potatoes guy. I added one sliced thai red pepper, 2 tsp of sugar, and extra shitake mushrooms. Next time, I'll use lite coconut milk.

so yummy!   I used cilantro instead of basil because 1- I had it and 2- I love cilantro. I also served over glass noodles instead of rice and added additional vegetables.  Sure its probably not as authentic but it tasted great.  very aromatic dish with wonderful flavor.  Has a perfect mix of sweet with a little bit of tangy.  Will definitely make this again!!

My husband is a picky eater, and he said it was good. I love thai food, so i found this to be bland. I didn't have fish sauce, so I omitted. I used white mushrooms instead of shiiitake because that's what I had. I added red peppers, spinach, salt, and sugar to give it more taste. Next time I will buy some hot chili to give it that extra kick and I didn't have enough basil. I think sweet thai basil would have given it a better flavor. I also used canola oil instead of olive oil. Would make again if I have LOTS of basil.

I followed the recipe exactly, EXCEPT I added 2 tablespoons of red curry paste and a can of bamboo shoots and it was FANTASTIC! I like my recipes a little spicier and the curry paste definitely adds that and more flavor. I have read some reviews about skipping the fish sauce and I DO NOT recommend it. I started using fish sauce a couple of years ago and was amazed at the difference. Dishes I have made for years were better and other people noticed!

This was a very good recipe, fast and yummy! I left out the fish sauce but it still tasted fine.  Great basil flavor.

Good! I used light coconut milk, extra basil and pepper flakes as others suggested, and threw in    a dash or two of garlic chili sauce.

Very very good. Authentic taste. Used holy basil and blue Ginger in addition to regular Ginger. Used about a teaspoon of hot chili sauce instead of pepper flakes. Will make again and again!!

Wonderful! I didn't have fish sauce so used oyster sauce, also added carrots and bell pepper. I didn't think it sounded spicy enough but it was, I used the amount of pepper flakes called for and didn't add any additional after serving. I chose to serve mine over rice noodles. Very good.

It was good.  I doubled up on the milk and added more veggies (zucchini, mushrooms, red bell pepper).  I also added a jalepeno for an extra kick. I think next time I wll omit the soy sauce.  I ddn't like the color it gave the sauce, kind of unappealling.

I love recipes with a lots of ingredients, and at first this one scared me and I thought I messed it up, but I followed the ingredients correctly and was blown away by the amazing flavor. I believe I added a bit of sugar. fun and easy to make

I only used half the amount of chicken because that's what I had but left everything else the same. Only had a little bit of sauce left over, so if I make it with the full amount of chicken I'll definitely double the sauce. I love fresh basil so would probably add some extra of that as well.

I thought this is was a great recipe that needed a little tweaking...i lived in South East Asia for many years and feel confident in my perspective of this dish. I felt it needed some more heat so i added more red peper flakes and a bit of cayene I also agree with others that the entire can of coconut milk was appropriate. I also felt it needed more salt instead of less. I added more soy sauce, more fish sauce and a bit of salt.  I also added fresh lime juice to brighten the dish. After tweaking it was brilliant.

Delicious! I made three changes; sesame oil instead of olive oil, portabello mushrooms instead of shiitake and rice sticks instead of jasmine rice. We both enjoyed this dish and I wish I had made more! Thanks for a great recipe that I will use again :)

We thought this was great, although I did make a few minor changes to the sauce - light coconut milk, 1T fish sauce, 1t crushed red pepper.  I also added some bell peppers with the onions, and cilantro and edamame with the basil and mushrooms, skipping the green onion.  Served over brown short grain rice since that's what was in the pantry.

Loved the sauce.  My husband likes the restaurant version of minced chicken but the whole family thought the recipe was delicious.  The dish was easy to prepare and the sauce was fun to make.  I slow roasted the garlic and onion and that added a slightly sweet flavor.

I made this tonight and it was excellent.  I used regular mushrooms instead of shiitake mushrooms and dried basil instead of fresh as that was what I had on hand.  It still tasted great.  I also served this over chow mein noodles instead of rice.

Yummmm!!! This recipe is amazing, delicious Thai-ness! Great for dinner and just as good reheated for lunch. I used brown jasmine rice (instead of white). Also didn't have green onions, but it didn't matter, turned out fabulous anyway! Last note: Added 3/4 tsp. of dried crushed lemon grass. Would give it 6 stars, but 5 is maximum. Try it!

I used brown rice and this was so good! I used thai red pepper garlic paste and pomegranate red wine vinegar substituted for 2 of the spoons of vinegar, I cut back on the fish sauce a little(1/2TB)added a little sherry cooking wine and Vidalia onion dressing(scant)because I am not a green onion fan.. This just really hits the spot!!

YUM!!  I followed the recipe but didn't follow the amounts being measured.  I used two large chicken breasts.  Let it them cook a bit in the coconut milk before adding 1 red pepper and asparagus, as well as some red pepper.  I served it over cauliflower mash.

This was easy to pull together and was full of flavor!  I used chile-garlic sauce in place of the red pepper flakes and added some broccoli, red pepper and snow peas because I like a lot of veggies in my stir fry!
Will be making this often!  Thank you for the recipe!

this was very good.  tweaked it a bit.  i marinated the chicken in some fresh squeezed lime juice and siracchia sauce for about 20 mins first.  no vinegar, skipped the red pepper flakes and had no mushrooms.  served with rice noodles and thickened a bit at the end with some cornstarch/water.  thanks for the post gabrielledc!
**changed my rating to a 5 star.  just had the leftovers for lunch...boy this is good!!!!!**

Made this last week. Used button mushrooms instead of shitiake and light coconut milk. My BF enjoyed it, but I found it to be OK. I would add more spice next time, probably some jalapenos or some cayanne pepper.

Really liked this recipe - made as is, aside from had to substitute ginger powder for fresh as I didn't have any.  Husband went back for seconds :)  Will make again.

I enjoyed this dish, but I'm not sure that it's something I want to make again. I thought it was a little bitter so I added about 2 Tbsp of sugar, which helped a lot.

Very tasty dish! Absolutely enjoyed this dish very much. I used lite coconut milk, button mushrooms and thai basil instead. Otherwise, stuck very closely to the recipe. A keeper for sure!

Too salty! Like some of the other reviewers said, the saltiness drowns out the flavor of the coconut and the vegetables. All I could taste was chicken, basil, and salt. I will not be making this again.

This was very yummy dish.  I used chicken thigh instead of breast since I like it better.  Next time, I think I'd put more onion.

I don't know if I just didn't make this right, but I felt like it didn't have enough flavor.  It was kind of bland and nothing too exciting.

This is not Thai Chicken with Basil (Phad Krapao) but it is tasty nonetheless. As mentioned by another reviewer it is more like a curry than anything. Krapao does not include coconut milk, fish sauce, vinegar or onion.

We loved this recipe.  I didn't want to have a half open can of coconut milk in the fridge, so I used the whole can and made it more of a 'soup'.  Also, I didn't have any fish sauce, so I added some Hoisin sauce and used a Fresno chili and some Thai basil from my yard.  It tasted just like the Thai curry coconut soup at our local Thai restaurant.  Yum.  Will definitely be making this one again.

Great flavor! I added some bok choy I had in the fridge, otherwise I did not change a thing. After this recipe, we are no longer going out for Thai.

Delicious - love the fresh basil, definitely makes the entire dish! Had to make a few tweaks due to personal preferences and ingredients on hand: no fish sauce so used 1 tsp. of miso paste for saltiness, leaks and red pepper instead of the onion and mushrooms and added 1 tsp. of red Thai curry paste for some extra flavour.  Excited for the leftovers!

I loved this! It tasted so authentic! I didn't have the fresh ginger root, so substituted for ground, and I didn't have the mushrooms or fish sauce either. It was delightful. Next time I will add a veggie mix, and peanuts. Thank you!

mmmmm... So good. The ginger gives a great kick and it has a great combination of sweet and spicy. We had it over a bed of rice noodles rather than rice and it was delicious. Wouldn't change a thing.

I thought this dish was very good. The flavors were very close to the thai basil chicken in restaurants. I was very pleased with the outcome and I used regular basil in the grocery store because I couldn't find Holy Basil. I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious and much better than the chicken basil we get from the local restaurant.  I plan on adding more of the coconut milk/vinegar/red pepper flake mixture next time so get more sauce out of it... other than that, my husband and I loved it.  We didn't even add the hot sauce that typically is served at the restaurant as it was tasty as it is!

Really good.  Added about 1 tsp red chili paste from the asian market to kick it up a bit...but that's a matter of personal taste.  Other than that, good recipe.  Oddly time consuming though.

Great recipe!  We don't care for shitake mushrooms, so sauteed sliced baby portabella separately instead and they were great.  Garnished with diced sweet red pepper and chopped cashews- this made it really pretty and the nuts added a great little crunch.  Also added about 2T unsweetened coconut to my rice before cooking, and used light coconut milk to reduce calories.  I will be making this again soon!  Chopped water chestnuts could also be added for texture.... next time!

This recipe is fabulous! I am a huge lover of thai food and this did not let me down! I didnt have a few things like the fish sauce, fresh basil or fresh ginger but the dried and ground versions of the spices were perfect. I also added more mushrooms and coconut milk than was called for and added sliced zucchini and red bell pepper to it. I love how you can make it spicier with just a touch more red pepper flakes, and it was perfect over steamed jasmine rice. Will make quite often!!!

My 1st Thai food attempt. Used Thai basil from the garden, 14oz coconut milk/added some baby carrot strips/bell pepper strips (from garden),low sodium soy sauce & vinegar so it wasn't too salty, with a little bit of red curry.Yummy and fun.

This recipe was okay. I thought some things were off. I think it calls for way too much soy sauce, and I cut the vinegar in half because that would kill the coconut milk flavor (some of the reviews said you couldn't taste the coconut milk). It was well like by my children, I served it on a bed of spinach for myself to keep it healthy.

A good basic start to coconut chicken stir fry.  Nice for my kids who at the tender age of 3 and 1 don't like spicy food.  I separated some for me and added a ton of green curry paste.  delicious!

Thought this was just OK.  I think using Thai basil, fresh chilis and more coconut milk would add more flavor, maybe a little lime juice too.

Just like take-out.  Doubled the coconut milk (used the whole can) and only 2 tbsp of soy sauce (tamari).  Next time will scale back the vinegar more, it was a touch too sour.  Did add the spoon of sugar that one reviewer suggested. Used a dash of thai chili and garlic sauce rather than the red pepper flakes.

Added one sweet red pepper cut in chunks at the end of the chicken cooking phase, which added nice colour and more vitamins.  Also used about a pound of button mushrooms rather than shitake.

I was really unsure after tasting the coconut mixture at the beginning, but the ginger/garlic/basil additions are really strong and balance out the flavours at the end.  This is definitley not a bland dish.

The whole family loved it including my two-year old.  Restaurant quality.

after spending 2 weeks in Thailand last year my husband & I love Thai food. This was an excellent recipe. I did add extra red chili pepper & some kefir lime leaves, chopped very small, in the coconut mixture. I opted to add green beans instead of mushrooms and green onions. I served this with coconut brown rice. Brown rice made with 1/2 coconut milk, 1/2 water. Also I recommend low sodium soya sauce & lower fat coconut milk. Delicious & low fat!

Great recipe!  I made some changes.  I didn't add mushrooms because my boyfriend hates them.  I added broccoli and shrimp.  I also added more coconut milk because I like the taste of it.  Very yummy!  Will make again!

This was fantastic, I changed ever so slightly. Added only half the patis and 1/4 teaspoon of sugar.  While I only changed 2 ingredients, I did change the procedure. To make it even easier I cut chicken, placed sauteed aromatics, raw chicken, and liquid in a baking disk, stirred in 1/2 the basil and baked the entire thing. From start to finish it was done in 20 minutes and the chicken breast was very tender. Great basic recipe, when you have it in most Thai places their is sugar in the sauce. next time I'll add bell pepper.

This recipe was simple to make.  It is very good, however it tastes nothing like the thai basil that I get when I eat out.  I used beef instead of chicken, added 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes, 3 or 4 shakes of dried basil, and chili sauce.  It still wasn't very spicy.  I made two batches of the coconut sauce--one to marinate the beef in and one for the sauce reduction.  The meat turned out very tender.  My husband and I both liked the recipe, but it just doesn't taste at all like the thai basil dishes we're used to.

Very tasty. I will make this again. A bit soupy, but as long as you think of it as a curry...it's wonderful. I added some extra red pepper flakes to spice it up.

This was tasty, but I do think the recipe needs some work. I added extra mushrooms and spinach to this as it was rather soupy and needed more substance in it. I stirred in a bit of cornstarch and water and that did help. I went heavier on the red pepper flakes and used lite coconut milk. I served this over udon noodles. I think next time I may try broccoli spears or another veggie in this.

I seemed to like this more than my husband.  We have been to several Thai restaurant within cities with a lot of asians and it just didn't qualify.  Would this be served at one of those restaurants? No.  Would it be served in a small town where people with bland tastebuds would enjoy it? Yes.  Like others, I added extra basil and red pepper flakes, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Can honestly say that I will not be making this again.  And I had so much promise in this from other reviewers and Lynn in Tokyo :(

My family loved this recipe. It seemed seemed to be missing a little something sweet so I added 3  tablespoons of mirin and it was perfect. As an added twist, instead of eating it over rice we ate it over whole grain ramen noodles. Thanks for sharing!

This was very simple to make and since I'm diabetic I mixed my rice with riced cauliflower.  To make it even easier,,I used frozen preprepared cauliflower.  To add to the veggies, I added ginger carrots with a little sweetness on the side.  I'm sure there are more appropriate Thai vegetables, but I'm not aware of them now.  I will have to research that.  The chicken was great and it was easy Asian food to modify for my diabetic diet.

Flavor explosion! While making this I was a little worried that it would lack in flavor. Wow, I was wrong!  Once all the liquids boil down the flavor intensifies and it is an awesome complex flavorful dish.

I'm sorry, but neither my hubs or I liked this at all. Not only did this taste NOTHING like our local Thai restaurant's chicken basil dish, it was SUPER bland to boot. Thai basil / ginger might have perked this up a bit, but to be quite honest, this dish simply lacks oomph and authenticity. For starters, I've never had Thai basil chicken with anything other than ground chicken. Secondly, the sauce in traditional basil chicken is SPICY! This sauce was tangy (from the addition of rice wine vinegar) and very mild. Lastly, restaurant-quality basil chicken is made with FRESH veggies (chiles, bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, etc.) and WHOLE basil leaves which wilt as they cook (like spinach) and infuse the sauce with amazing flavor. Maybe this will float your boat, but it did absolutely nothing for us. Thanks anyways, Gabrielle.

YUM!  What a different recipe from the normal stir fry I make.  My husband has been helping me in the kitchen since I'm 9 months pregnant and I thought this recipe would be a bit of a challenge for him but not too diffcult.  You should have seen how proud he was when we tasted it.  The flavor of the basil was fantastic.  The only thing we left out were the mushrooms since we both don't like them, other than that it was a hit!  I will definitely be making this recipe again, we liked the kick the red pepper flakes made and I don't often cook with coconut juice.

Loved this!  I added broccoli and poured the reduced sauce over the cooked veggies, rice and chicken and tossed it all together so it would look like what we usually order. The sauce all absorbed into the rice.  It didn't taste like our local restaurant's, but it may be even better.  I used regular basil, so that may have made a difference.  I was leary of the way it smelled but it tasted divine.  I didn't find it too salty at all using low sodium soy.  I peel and freeze ginger root, so just grated what I needed here.  Yummy.

Made this exactly as directed except I served it over steam fried noodles boiled for one minute and this meal was fantastic.  Really nice flavor and so easy to make. This is a new favorite of ours. Thanks! Updated Jan 29, 2014 - for some reason I didn't note that there's way too much fish sauce in the this recipe and to cut it back next time. So last night I made it exactly how written and ended up throwing it out uneaten. Way too salty!!  If I make it again, I hope I remember to cut back or leave out the fish sauce. Revising my 5 star down to 3 for this serious flaw in this recipe in my opinion.

This was fantastic. Who cares if it's authentic or not?! I used chile-garlic sauce instead of red pepper flakes. I didn't have any mushrooms, but added some asparagus I needed to use up. I will be making this again soon. It was also very easy to throw together.

This was absolutely delicious, and I had serious doubts while preparing it.  I did change it slightly, based on our tastes.  I doubled up on the garlic, used 2 cups of chopped basil, only used 1 teaspoon of fish sauce and 1 tablespoon of the rice wine vinegar.  Oh and used the fresh ginger that comes in a tube.  I used the prepackaged sliced shitake mushrooms and deleted the onion.
We enjoyed this! It was not soupy....not one bit. 
Thank you for a great recipe!

This was SOOOO great!!! The only thing i did differently was omitting the fish sauce. Also It was pretty spicy for my husband and I so next time i make it i will only add HALF the red pepper flakes. but besides that it was AWESOME!! Tastes very similar to a Thai Restaurant! :)

My husband and I love Thai food and we both LOVED this recipe! I only used a tablespoon of fish sauce and I didn't have ginger or spring onions, which I will try next time, but it was delicious without them. It was just the right amount of spice for us and we like spicy food. We will definitely make this again and again!

Wonderful, easy recipe, even though I used plain old white mushrooms and less basil because I didn't have enough on hand. My husband & I loved this, but had to find some chicken nuggets in the freezer for my 2 yr old.

Good dish.  I used galanga and ginger.  If you want to thicken the sauce, add a bit of corn starch.  I served this dish over sticky rice rather than jasmine and the combination was good.  I also used fresh Thai chili peppers.  Didn't have Thai basil, but the Italian basil served its purpose.  Big hit with my guests.

Me and my boyfriend enjoyed this thai dish. Next time I would add more spice with chili pepper sauce or more cayenne pepper. Used thin pork chops instead of chicken and oyster sauce instead of fish sauce as both were on hand. Added red bell peppers. I agree with others: used whole can of lowfat coconut milk, more basil leaves. Will def make again. Very easy!!

This was fantastic - the jasmine rice really sets it off.  We didn't have the fish sauce at my boyfriend's house so we eliminated it and it was still great, awesome leftovers.

Don't judge this recipe until you have added the basil and simmered a little. Very good! I doubled sauce and added a little honey.

Made this for dinner and it was very tasty. I don't like mushrooms so I omitted them and added string beans instead. Also added more basil than what it called for!

This is one of my favorite ways to use fresh basil from the garden. I find I have to add some cayenne for more flavor, although I would love to try it with some Thai chilies if I could find some. I also add more garlic and extra veggies.

I added broccoli and cashews. Honestly, I thought the sauce was runny and bland--even despite using fresh ingredients. I will not make this recipe again.

I followed the recipe, and also used Thai basil like others suggested.  Tasted a little bland.  We (my family) are avid Thai food restaurant goers.  I would suggest adding green curry (mild) or yellow curry (moderately tangy), a little more fish sauce.  Also, I think next time I will put at least half the soy and fish sauce directly in with the chicken, onions, garlic and ginger so that it absorbs into the chicken more, and the rest in with the coconut milk sauce.

Very tasty!  My family loved all the different flavors of the dish.  Cannot understand how some would say it is bland.  Only substitue I made was red bell pepper slices instead of mushrooms.  Will definately make again!

This is the best thing I have cooked in a LONG time.  I used sesame oil, cut the soy sauce (low sodium) down to 2 T and the fish sauce down to 1 T.  You have GOT to use fresh ginger - get it from an asian market if possible.  None of this jarred, prepackaged stuff.  I went really heavy on the ginger, basil, and red pepper flakes, though I didn't measure any of them so I don't know how heavy.  Added a little curry powder since we like things really spicy and a squeeze of lime.  Couldn't find rice wine vinegar, so I just used rice vinegar.  This is what I always order at Thai restaurants, and I am shocked to say that it was better than I've ever eaten at a restaurant.  I can't wait to make it again.

I actually thought this dish was fantastic.  I doubled the garlic, ginger, onions, mushrooms, and the basil.  I also want to try the dish with out using the coconut milk in the dish, but rather marinate the chicken with it.  I never prepare a dish without using the freshest ingredients.  I know that it takes some time to get your mis en plas ready, but when the dish is coming together, it is so much easier and less stressful.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used button mushrooms instead of shitake as they weren't available.  It was really good but not great.  To me, it needed a little some "extra".  But I would definitely make it again.

Easily customizable for your tastes.  I don't like mine spicy, so omit the red pepper flakes, and it works great with de-boned rotisserie chicken instead of chicken breast.  You can also change up the amount of garlic or onion and omit the mushrooms.  With some tweaking, I can make this taste like the basil chicken I used to get at a hole-in-the-wall Thai place in college!

I really enjoyed this - some of the kids found it just a tad too spicy.  I added more mushrooms than was called for and even threw in about 10 whole mushrooms (to avoid putting them back in the fridge) - that worked out great (especially the whole ones).  Next time I'll add some fresh string beans to add a little more bulk (beyond the rice).  Will certainly do this again.

I found it to be overwhelmingly vinegary. The rice vinegar is strong and took over the entire sauce, taking away from the mild coconut milk and basil. If I were to re-do, I would use only  a tablespoon of vinegar and extra coconut milk to mellow out the flavor.

I made this for Sunday night dinner and it was just a little better than "okay".  The flavor is good but the sauce was a bit runny.  I cooked it long enough for the sauce to thicken, but it never did.  My husband liked it and ate it all, but it just didn't have that "wow" factor.

GREAT Recipe.  Used a little cornstarch in water at the end to slightly thicken.  Thai basil...rather than the generic globe basil made it memorable!

This was a hit with my hubby and all my children (which is also a reason I am giving it 5 stars). I thought it was a bit bland...but then I didn't add as much pepper as it called for so that could have something to do with it.  I did not think it was too salty, but I just used 2 Tbsp of soy sauce (i was running low) and 1 TBSP of fish sauce.   I will make this again....I will just make mine and hubby's spicier.

This was way too salty, masking the coconut flavor (even though I used a whole can of coconut milk). Next time I would reduce both the soy sauce and the fish sauce. Added steamed broccoli, which tasted great with this. I'd like to try again because the flavors had potential.

Not quite as flavorful as I was expecting and I added extra pepper.  I also added a ton of veggies.  It was definitely a good start, however, and I think I'll try again with some more tweaks.

On my weekly trip to the local farmer's market, I came across some very fragrant organic Thai basil and couldn't resist buying it. I never cooked with Thai basil before, so I search for an easy recipe and found this one. I took EVERYONE's advice I read here. I followed the recipe to the letter.  Except I used a whole can of coconut milk and added 1 tbsp of brown sugar.  I also added: broccoli, julienned red bell peppers for color, and water chestnuts and baby corn for crunch. My boyfriend and my teen and tween daughters devoured this very easy to make dish. Great recipe!!! One pointer; if you don't have fresh ginger on hand, sprinkle in the dried kind. You can find it in the spice section of the grocery store.

Wow!!!! This is so good, my children 9 & 14 loved it (pre pepper flakes) and my husband loved it as well.  The best part is that it is so easy!!  The hardest part was finding fresh basil in Feb!

This stir fry is really good but the flavors in the sauce are so complex it is difficult to taste any of the individual ingredients.  I might try it without pepper flakes and ginger next time to bring out the basil and coconut...?

With all the reviews I read I was really afraid that this would be too salty or sour so I cut down on both the soy and rice vinegar.  Mistake!  The dish had a nice sweet, spicy kick (combo of thai chille sauce and red pepper flakes) - but definitely needed more salt to bring out the other flavors!  I was out of basil, so I substituted cilantro which gave it a nice smooth kick.  Next time I will use the recommended amounts of soy, rice vinegar, and fish sauce and try adding brown sugar.  I will make it again, for sure, just won't worry about the salt content!  I'm still giving it a 5 as I am sure it would have been much better just left alone!!

This was delicious. I used a whole can of coconut milk and added two spoonfuls of sugar, bell pepper, baby corn and water chestnuts. We'll definitely be making this again.

I tried this recipe last night for my family and it worked out very well. Two of them said it was the nicest meal I had ever made!! There are one or two things that I changed about it however. There is too much vinegar in the recipe, which makes it very sour. Also, it is very salty (and I like salt), so a few spoonfuls of sugar is definitely necessary. I added a small amount of cornflour to thicken it as I had used two tins of coconut milk. I will def make this again.

This was a GREAT recipe with a little tweaking. I ended up needing half the required chicken and a whole can of coconut milk with the original amount of soy sauce, fish sauce, and rice wine vinegar. I also added water chesnuts for crunch, but more veggies (like snow peas, grated carrots, green beans, julienned bell peppers, etc) would have definately added to the dish. The basic ingredients, though, were amazing. Just don't be afraid to adjust to your own taste!!

Loved this recipe..Took no time at all to make. I didn't have the vinegar or the fish sauce but I added 2 tbsp. Thai sweet spicy sauce, and a little extra soy sauce. I added a pinch or so of crushed pepper and upped the green onions. Turned out super fab!

A little too salty for my taste but overall pretty good. More coconut milk and a little chili garlic sauce would be great. Definitely worth a try.

Made this tonight and it turned out great!  Even the kids liked it (wasn't very spicy with the recommended amt. of red pepper flakes - use more if you like it hot!) 
Someone mentioned that it was missing something in an earlier review.  At the end, my husband added some honey and that seemed to bring out all the flavors.  So I would recommend adding some to the recipe

I was craving Thai when I searched for and found this recipe.  It's quick to make and fairly authentic-tasting.  I used Trader Joe's basil (easy to get and the best deal in town!) and light coconut milk. The amount of red pepper flakes was just the right amount of spice for me and my husband. I sent this recipe to my sis in Seattle, who made it the next day and gave the same rave review :)

I'd like to try it with red bell pepper, as another reviewer did. Definitely a do-again recipe! Yummy!

I've never made a thai dish before, but my boyfriend loved this dish last night.  He called one of his friends to come over and taste it!!!  The little touches were perfect.  I did use a little less vinegar and a little more soy sauce though.  Perfect dish to get away from the norm!

Thoroughly enjoyed this although my kids didn't care for it. I used skinless chicken thighs and instead of the shitake mushrooms, I added an 8 oz. package of frozen wild mushrooms. Served with brown jasmine rice. Photo submitted on 3/11/07

This is a very good recipe.  I did add a few of my own touches such as a couple handfuls of broccoli, spinach, sprouts and a few dashes of garlic chili sauce.  I also drained the liquid into a saucepan and reduced it until it was to a thicker consistency.  Added the chicken and served it over coconut jasmine rice.  For the rice I used the remaing coconut milk and made up the difference with water (could use chicken broth).  The whole meal was healthy and delicious.  It is a great low carb alternative if you leave out the rice!

I thought this recipe was just OK.  I thought it would be alot better from what the other reviews said.  It was quite bland, so you would need to add some ingredients to it, as others did.

Alone, this is a nice chicken stir fry. The flavors are balanced and it's delicious as it is written.   You will do fine just making this as is! If you are looking for the Thai flavors, some simple substitutions will get you there.  If you just use the Thai ingredients, ie, ginger (galanga), Thai basil, vegetable oil instead of evoo, Thai bird's eye chili peppers, Thai fish sauce (not absolutely necessary,  but nice if you have it) and kiffer lime leaves as well as Thai soy sauce (if you happen to have)  you will have better than restaurant results.

Having spent lots of time all over Thailand, a few cooking classes there and LOTS of Thai cooking, I appreciate the differences in many Asian dishes and recipes.   The use of specific ingredients( when possible) takes recipes to a whole other level almost always making them better than restaurants.

Easy to make and tasty. I added two ingredients: juice from half a lime, and about 1 Tbsp of  Thai Sweet Chili Sauce from my local Walmart (instead of pepper flakes).

Omitted fish oil so then it needed some salt. Going to substitute soy paste for the fish oil next time. Love the heaps of basil, a great dish.  Can also make with Tofu instead of chicken, no alteration to directions needed.

I absolutely love basil, but even using half it was too much.

The recipe is good except that it uses too much fish/soy sauce. The amount specified here makes the dish way too salty.

After cutting the chicken into bite-sized pieces, I conditioned it with 2 tsp baking soda and let it sit while chopping up the veggies we used. Before cooking the chicken, I rinsed it well under cold water and used a paper towel to dry it as best I could. This gave the chicken a velvety texture and it wasn't dry or chewy at all.

I used the veggies in the fridge, so ours was a little different. I had fresh broccoli, onion, and red and yellow peppers so that's what I used. 

Followed the advice of other reviewers and used the whole can of full-fat coconut milk. 

I began by sautéing the veggies in sesame and olive oils in my very hot wok. After they were crisp-tender, I took them out and added a touch more sesame oil. Then stir-fried the chicken until it had a nice browned crust on both sides. Added just the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, fish sauce, and garlic chili paste (it's amazing for heat!) just as the chicken was almost done cooking; then added in the coconut milk and scraped up the bottom of the wok. I didn't have fresh basil this time so I just used dried (next time I will definitely try to use fresh, but dried gave it good flavor, too).  Added the veggies back in and stirred well to get them in the sauce. Covered the wok and let the broccoli steam while I juiced 3 small limes and mixed in cornstarch to the lime juice. 

After the broccoli was steamed but still just a touch crisp, I added in the lime juice-cornstarch slurry and cooked it up until the sauce thickened a

I added shredded carrots that I had on hand. I would like to try the holy basil that I was hearing about next time. Yes I will definitely make this again. I squeezed a little lime on it before eating.

This was great!  I reduced the crushed red pepper to make it less spicy.  Left out the mushrooms because we didn't have any.  I will make this again, and experiment with adding other vegetables.

I followed this recipe pretty closely with a few minor changes. I used a little less fish sauce, a little more soy sauce, a little more of the coconut milk, boneless  chicken thighs cut in bite size chunks, & included shallots. I didn't add the basil to the dish until I plated & I was so glad I did that. My husband and I both thought it tasted really good. We'll definitely make it again!

This was an excellent change of pace as I don’t often cook this type of cuisine. I will definitely be adding this to my monthly meal options. I loved the flavor and the ability to add-on with various veggies on hand. I’m a huge fan of Spicy and with this recipe the more the merrier! With the base of ingredients to create this you can simply modify this recipe to make it your own. I used more of the coconut milk than called for because, Sauce!!! The substitution of chili oil for cooking the chicken and then a dash or two of siratcha as well as some brown sugar into the coconut milk mixture took it to the next level for me.  I highly recommend splurging on the Jasmine rice as an accompaniment.

This was really good.  I used Thai basil and the flavor really came through.  I would have sliced the chicken a little thinner next time like the size the recipe called for so it would cook faster. I used low fat coconut milk and I think it was fine.  I just had to cook it down a bit more.   I will definitely put this recipe on my list of make again recipes.

I made this recipe because it looked different than your average stir fry. I like the flavor of Thai dishes, but never really attempted them at home.  I followed the recipe very close to the recipe provided and the whole family really enjoyed this dish. I was actually surprised  to see my picky son liked it. I substituted baby bella mushrooms  and it was still good. I added the mushrooms too late in the process and by the time they were cooked the way I like them , the chicken got cooked more than needed and wasn't as tender as it should have been. I will be making this again and will be better the next time.

If I had this at a restaurant, I would be a happy camper!  This was the first time I cooked with some of these ingredients, and it turned out great.  Like others, I used the whole can of coconut milk.  I also added more heat by using some garlic chili sauce (about 1 T.), and sweet chili sauce (about 2 T.).  I think the sweet chili sauce made a big difference because it added some of  sweetness which otherwise would have taken the finished dish down a notch.  As it was, I also added some agave nectar  when it was done because it seemed to need a little more of that signature Thai sweetness.  I also put in more basil and added some rice noodles.  Boy, this really was good.  Only thing I might add next time would be some chopped peanuts.

I played around with the sauce a bit. Thai basil is a must, I won’t make it if I can’t find it. I also added oyster sauce instead of fish sauce and a few teaspoons of green curry paste. If you have a stalk of lemongrass throw it in too.

I actually made the recipe without looking at the reviews. Only a few adjustments – subbed zucchini for mushrooms since my husband just doesn’t like them, omitted green onions for same reason. Would add more salt and flavoring. Oh and used thighs instead of breasts.

I made this and substituted the fish sauce for oyster sauce as I was worried about the salt content. It was absolutely delishous and do quick and easy to make!

Very good; I used fresh cilantro instead of basil and the family enjoyed it.  Also used reduced-sodium soy sauce and it was plenty salty.

Delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as written, except for substituting regular mushrooms for the shiitake mushrooms, because that's what I had on hand.  I sauteed them along with the onion, ginger and garlic.   I also used the whole can of coconut milk, as we like a lot of sauce.  I used low fat coconut milk - I don't recommend it.  It was watery and lacked the flavor of the full fat version.  I'll definitely make this again, but with the full fat coconut milk.  Thanks for the recipe!

The second time I made this I added 1 tbs of brown sugar, 1 tbs zest of lime and 1 tbs of lime juice - loved the flavour it added. I also mix all of the sauce ingredients together and only add in once the veggies and chicken are ready. So no browning of the garlic and ginger root before.

Loved this dish, whether it's authentic or not. Added extra coconut milk and didn't reduce much in fact put the lid on it the first few minutes cause I like it to be saucy, used chili paste instead of flakes about two tbls. Haven't any access to any thai basil so used Italian sweet and used cremini mushrooms cause that's what I had... Also had leftover steamed shrimp I added to it as well and just loved it

This was delicious. It does require some time to do all of the chopping so allow for that. Also, we do not care for fish sauce so we substituted peanut butter in the same amount. To keep it healthy, we used a lower fat peanut butter. I recommend this recipe. Super good and extremely healthy. Thanks!

The dish doesn't taste at all of coconut milk. It is salty, sour, and a little bit slimy. The sour would have been better coming from lemon grass (lighter, better taste, a touch of sweetness), the fish sauce was wholly unnecessary, coconut cream would have made a thicker sauce, and the vinegar added nothing positive. However, it is so inconsequential in taste I don't think it's worth the effort to make it again to try those edits.
Even after I added the rest of the can of coconut milk, I couldn't taste it past the odd salty, sour combo.

This is simply delicious!!! I skipped the fish sauce since I don't like it anyway.  The flavor was just amazing, I could eat this everynight.  Can't wait to make it again.  I may spice it up a bit.

I make Thai food at home at least once a week. As per other reviewers, I would say that this dish as written is American food. I think the idea for this recipe is good but one needs to use other ingredients to make it Thai. Use galangal if you can find it.  It is expensive so don't waste it.  Once found, slice it and use part for this dish. The rest can be sliced into 1/4" slices and put into a jar filled with rice wine in the refrigerator for a month for future use. Use peanut oil, never olive oil in Thai dishes. Thai basil is a must, not Italian basil. The flavors are very different. For a more authentic touch use ground chicken or pork instead of diced chicken breast. Skip the pepper flakes and go for sliced chilis of whatever heat you wish. And lastly, want to feel like you are on the beach in Phuket ? Fry an egg sunny-side up and put an egg on each portion when serving this dish served atop Thai jasmine rice.  Thanks for your submission of this dish, it has sparked many home chefs to experience another country's food without the price of an airplane ticket.

I cut my breast in half then sliced it to make thinner pieces of chicken. I did not have garlic salt or chili oil so didn't use. I think it would too salty with more salt anyways. I used two red Thai chili peppers for the heat. I lost my basil in the fridge so I used cilantro instead. I will definitely make this again.

I've made this a few times, the first two exactly as the recipe is written, and it wasn't bad. I felt it could use more flavor. All of the bones were there for a great recipe, but some of the ingredients weren't quite enough. 

We've tweaked it and added galanga instead of ginger, and upped the fish sauce and basil quantities. We also like it pretty spicy, so we use minced hot Thai chillis. (Or in a pinch, dry Thai chillis.) The point is though, this won't taste very authentic if you're using American pizzeria chili pepper flakes. (Which I'm not saying is what the recipe actually calls for. It just says red chili flakes, and that can mean a lot of things!)

Superb authentic-type Thai recipe resembles other Thai dishes from cookbook recipes I have prepared previously. Just remember to be careful with the coconut milk, not to burn it. 

Potted Thai holy (Tulsi) basil has strong flavor as strong comparably to ginger. Although more like licorice, I was surprised that it added lemony flavor tones. 

Tip: I recommend if you reconstitute your shiitake mushrooms from dry black mushrooms, add the slices (discarding the stems) during the coconut milk reducing stage.

I used more coconut milk, and added 1 tsp curry powder to the sauce, and at least an additional tsp of red pepper flakes.  I didn't have fish sauce.  Also used 1 small can of water chestnuts near the end, and a tablespoon of thai chili sauce.    My family enjoyed it and I will make this again, possibly adding some broccoli florets to make it a one-dish meal.

We love this. It's on our regular rotation. A few tips: double the liquid ingredients, use fresh peppers (jalapeño, habanero, or Thai hot peppers), and Thai holy basil. The dish goes equally well with noodles, white rice, or brown rice.

tasty, and not too strong for my non-adventurous family. 
I did use corn starch to thicken more, and subbed Chinese broccoli for onions (kids hate onions) . 
served over sticky rice (which I also combined with the left over coconut milk for a quick rice pudding).

This was fantastic.  I used most of a can of coconut milk and added and extra tablespoon each of soy sauce and vinegar.  Also through in some extra veggies and served over soba noodles.  We loved it, thanks!

Added Cilantro, which was a nice touch. I can't figure out how to keep the coconut milks flavor as present as I like it. Any suggestions?

Will make again.  Very yummy, can be a little salty.

Skipped the mushrooms (personal taste), added the whole can of coconut milk, used pork instead of chicken, used regular basil from our garden. Marinated the meat a little first in a little extra soy sauce, garlic, and ginger.

Made a more low carb version without the rice and it was super - recipe seems very adaptable.  Flavors are excellent - used coconut oil instead of olive oil, no fish sauce, visalia onion, baby portabellas, and baby bok choy.  Yum!

We gave this a solid 4 stars! Loved the flavors and super easy to make. prep time takes longer than stated if doing all prep by hand and not in a food processor. Followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make it again. DId not think it was salty at all. am wondering if the salt issues others spoke of was do to salting chicken? we will be doubling the sauce and tweaking with some others veggies for the next go round. overall solid, filling, wonderful flavors made for a great dinner last night!

This was alright. After reading some other reviews I used only 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce and it was still too salty. The red pepper flakes created a little bit of mouth burn.
I also suggest removing the chicken from the sauce to let it reduce or it will dry out the chicken.

Family loved this!  Even my pickiest teenager went back for seconds.  I used whole can of coconut milk.  I also added bamboo shoots, broccoli and used regular mushrooms, which were delicious!  I also served over "glass" -- rice-- noodles that complemented the sauce deliciously!

Hot Luv ! I made it at the closest to the original recipe but with what I had at hand, that is without garlic, with a lot of dry basil and with 1 jalapeno replacing the red pepper flakes. Unfortunately I had no shitake mushrooms neither so decided to replace the rice wine vinegar by a whole tangerine (skin and flesh) cut in 8, which we found to be a very nice addition. The spicy sauce proportions fit for a half chicken that I cooked in my pressure cooker. The result was quite authentic (very spicy !), good and flavourful. Shall try next time with the mushrooms and maybe more coconut milk for a less hot version.

This recipe was very disappointing.  It lacked flavor and pizazz.  I would recommend adding more basil, and I think adding some vegetables such as broccoli, etc. may help.  All in all, it was pretty bland.

YES I DO SEE this is on the radar too. Going to be tough to top this one though. I did adjusted to my personal taste. Your way is very delicious. The next time I did it and I add it to my recipe box and to My Note: My family loved bouth ways, and I'll be making this a lot more. Both are delicious, it's a matter of what your taste is....I now have two ways to this. YOU HAVE SUCCESS!! with me. Now I can do my happy food dance!!  Thank you!!! Happy Cooking to you and y'all!

The recipe was very good, I think I would cut down a little on the pepper flakes and add more milk to it, but it was very tasty...........mine rather turned out darker than the photo and a cousin from Thailand said it was more like a curry than a stir fry

This is a simple Asian stir fry recipe that is sure to impress!  When I first served this for dinner, both my husband and I had the "wow" reaction.  Don't let the list of ingredients intimidate you, this is actually very easy to make.  This tastes better than some meals I've had at Thai restaurants.  The combination of ginger, coconut milk, basil and fish sauce gave the dish so much flavor.  Add this recipe to your weeknight menu!

Really good! I diced the chicken into smaller pieces so that they soaked up the flavor. My husband enjoyed it, and said he could even eat it two days in a row! I did not add the mushrooms, but it didn't matter really. Will make this again.

I didn't have any ginger, or fish sauce and it was still delicious!  Used green beans, regular onion, a cup of cilantro, a handful of micro-basil and 2 serrano chiles and a tsp of brown sugar and it was spicy delight!  I will use ginger next time, but I have cooked with fice sauce before and I really feel this didn't need it.  I served with brown coconut rice (cooked in half water, and the rest of the coconut milk from the sauce) and bean sprouts on the side.  Great!

This was awesome!!  I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil and cremini mushrooms instead of shiitake mushrooms (my store didn't have shiitake), but left everything else the same.  I think next time I'll add 1/2 tsp. sugar (just needed a tiny bit of sweetener).  I added 1 tsp. cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great flavor! Listened to some of the advice and used less fish sauce and red pepper flakes... and added lime juice. It's a keeper for our family!

Loved this! I admit I was missing many of the ingredients so made it up as I went along - no fish sauce, used 1.5 tbs lime juice, no soy, used terryaki, used ground red pepper instead of pepper flakes, and a tsp. of ground ginger. I didn't have mushrooms, but used zucchini , green eggplant, and red bell pepper. Also no basil, dry or fresh, used 2 tbs homemade pesto. Turned out great - hope I can recreate it!

Very Tasty!!! Made it with beef instead of chicken, very delicious. Used 6 garlic cloves and grinded it in the grinder with the ginger root. Very delicious!

Great dish, very flavorful. I skipped the mushrooms (husband doesn't care for them) and the dish still felt very complete. Will make this again.

I found this to be salty (even with low sodium soy sauce) and not that great, maybe more veggies and less soy sauce/fish sauce would improve it?

Very good, and I didn't have fish sauce or fresh ginger. I made this to use some of the basil from our garden it was quite delicious.

This recipe was fast, easy and very good.
Even without the fish sauce and I used Italian basil and lite cocnut milk.
I will definitely make again and again.

Excellent recipe! The only thing I did differently was use dry basil as that is what I had.  It still worked well.  I served it over brown rice cooked with a little olive oil, s & p & basil.

I made this recipe for the inlaws and they loved it! I did add more ginger, red bell peppers, and baby corn to the recipe.  We made our own coconut milk since we couldn't find it in the store, and added more than it called for and a little bit of the pulpy part.  It was ggreat, will definitely make it again!

Excellent Thai Recipe. I followed others suggestions by adding sugar to it. As well, I used fresh chili peppers instead of flakes. Turned out very tasty!

I made this the other night and it was very good. I added a little bit of brown sugar as someone else suggested and omitted the fish sauce. I had never used fresh ginger but I grated it finely and it worked out really well. I'm very glad I tried this recipe it makes me think I can make more exotic recipes!!

My husband & I loved this recipe! This was our first attempt ever at making Thai food. I followed the recipe with exception of using regular basil and we still loved it. I can't wait to make it again with holy basil to compare the flavors. Thanks!

Great recipe!  I substituted the Chicken with Tofu.  Delicious.  It has been put in my permanent collection.  I also used an entire can of coconut mils and added other veggies.  Thanks.

Okay- wow.  I made this with half chicken and half shrimp, just used a bag of stir fry veggies instead of the others, and added about 1/4 tsp curry.  I used fresh ginger and halved the basil as others have recommended.  It is amazing, I'm replacing my normal BORING stir fry with this wonderful recipe, as this is just as easy and waaaaay more flavorful.  Thank you for this simple thai dish.

I made this dinner last night for my family and I doubled the recipe except for the red pepper flakes and the chicken! I supplemented that with Bamboo Shoots, brocoli, water chestnuts, and red peppers!  IT WAS DELICIOUS! I would make this meal again for sure!!! Yummy! My family loved it too!

Phenomenal! I love Thai food, but don't get to eat it very often. This is a great easy recipe to make at home. I made the recipe as directed minus the mushrooms (my husband hates them) and I sub'd the mushrooms with bamboo shoots. I have never cooked nor have I eaten much basil. My husband thought that the amount of basil was way too much. I thought it was a little on the heavy side, but that may just be a personal taste thing.  I still loved the taste and ate too much so giving it 5 stars anyway. Thanks for the recipe!  (We did not think it was too spicy)

This was quite tasty!  I forgot to buy fresh basil, so I did cheat and use dried, so I bet it would be even better with fresh. A good easy weeknight dinner!

Not particulary exciting. Added a touch of mirin to balance out the flavors a bit. It helped but not enough to make me want to use this recipe again.
