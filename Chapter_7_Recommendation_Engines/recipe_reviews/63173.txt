I've served this to my family 3 times now, and I love it. My husband likes it and my son will eat it under duress, which is better than I can say for any other form of liver I've tried. Instead of pouring the tarragon sauce over the top, I serve it on the side as a dip for the french fry-like fried liver strips. The sauce is so delicious I could eat it straight.
