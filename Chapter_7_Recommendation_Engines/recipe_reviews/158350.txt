This is my recipe and I thought you all should know that the key to getting peak flavor in your steak (at least with this marinade) is to pierce the meat with a fork  several times. This allows the marinade to seep in and obtain optimal flavor in a shorter period of time. I mentioned that in the original recipe but it got lost somewhere between submittal and posting. Thanks for trying it, though! I appreciate the feedback!

I was skeptical of this recipe because I have never heard of marinading steak in vanilla extract, but I'm glad I went with it anyway because the end result was a nice change, and very yummy! After reading another reviewer's response I decided to marinade my steak with this recipe and my husband's with another marinade, but he did try mine and said it was good! I'll be using my leftovers for steak and eggs for breakfast tomorrow, thanks for the recipe :-D

I never do steaks at home because Husband likes them medium-rare, and I always manage to overcook them. But the store had sirloin on sale sooo cheaply this week, that I HAD to buy a couple. I was skeptical about this recipe, so I cut way back on the vanilla - just a tiny drop. I also marinated the meat for about 45 mins because I was worried they would take on too much flavor. They turned out great - just the right amount of sweet and heat. I'm not sure I will use the recipe again, but it was definitely nice for a change. Thanks!

I really liked this marinade as I needed a change, on the other hand my husband wasn't a huge fan of the sweet taste with steak.  I guess it just depends on your taste.

This recipe was a big hit @ my house. I did add about three tablespoons of sweet and sour but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

Excellent marinade.  I used hickory smoke salt instead of liquid smoke because I didn't have any (so then skipped the salt), and I used fresh chopped garlic.  Very nice flavor!  Thanks for sharing!

We thought this was a great marinade... Hubby wished I made extra to baste onto our steaks while they were on the grill.

This is a tasty recipe. I loved the flavor, but I do think it could have used some salt.

I didn't have any of the liquid smoke stuff so I left it out. And instead of minced onion ( since I didn't have that) I used onion powder. GREAT marinade! I love it because it is so quick and easy to make. It also tastes great!! It was a winner with my hubby. We've used this several times now on different kinds of steak as well as kabobs. All turned out delicious!

Turned out good without liquid smoke.  I refrained from adding it out of fear of flavor dominance, and I avoid adding artificial anything when I can.  I broiled it to a medium rare using pasture-raised petite sirloins, which turned out tender, juicy, and a tasty balance of sweet honey/vanilla and spicy cumin.  I felt as though it lacked in tang and realized perhaps an extra teaspoon or two of balsamic would do the trick for next time...

This is one of the best marinades for steak. I even used cayenne pepper for an even more spicier kick! Love this!!!!

Thank you for sharing this wonderful marinade! My in-laws love it, my entire family!  I make extra so I can baste...mmmmm. I typically let it marinade for 4 hours, but even 2hours does the trick.  I'm not sure if anyone has ever had a Steamboat steak, but this marinade is very similar. Happy BBQ'ing!!!

This is really good. I marinated a london broil in it then threw everything into a foil pack and cooked in the slow cooker. This turns out wonderful and is not all that sweet. I will use this one again for london broil!

It was okay. I was like the other reviewer that sweet and steak are not good together. This would be good on pork chops.

Very tasty.  Definitely needs to marinate overnight for best flavor, though.
