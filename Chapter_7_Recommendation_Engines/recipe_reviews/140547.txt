Four stars as written, as these would inarguably be on the “ho-hum” side, flavor-wise.  But with a few small additions, these are easily elevated to five stars, particularly if you’re an artichoke lover like me.  (I love artichokes so much that Santa used to put them in my Christmas stocking when I was a kid, but I digress) More butter, a chunk of cream cheese and fresh parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme made these exceptional.  Ahhh, for summer, when otherwise expensive fresh herbs are plentiful right in your own back yard!  I’d like to try other herbs as well – fresh oregano, dill or rosemary are all interesting possibilities.   Very creative recipe.

Very yummy.  This recipe is really a more healthy alternative to traditional mashed potatoes.  I roasted a few cloves of garlic and threw that into the food processor with the artichokes and milk.  The recipe as written calls for very little butter, but the artichoke mixture was so creamy I was able to use even LESS and my potatoes were still moist and creamy!  Healthy, easy, quick, delicious - everything I need in a recipe!

These are really good if you're an artichoke lover. Since some reviewers said it made a lot, I used 3 large potatoes, and 2 cans of artichokes. I left about 5 artichoke hearts out of the puree and roughly chopped them, I wanted some chunks of them in the mash. It turned out great!

Delicious and creamy, without all of the "bad stuff" in normal mashed potatoes. My new favorite! Just be sure you cut all of the leaves off the hearts- they mess with the texture, and make for an unpleasent find.

These were good.  I bought a jar of marinated artichokes and I next time I won't (didn't care for the marinade).  Hubby LOVED them!  He made TWO sandwiches with them and the "French Bread Rolls to Die For".  LOL, he's just like a kid!  I will try again!

This was super easy to make and totally delicious.  I made a few small changes, I doubled the recipe and I added 1 cup of parmesan cheese and 1 TBSP of Italian seasoning and 1 tsp celery salt to this recipe.  For a change it can be spread in a greased pan, sprinkled with chedder/mozzerella shredded cheese and baked @ 350 degrees until cheese is melted and potatos are warm.  Delish!!!

WOW these were so good!!!  Creamy and smooth especially with fresh garlic.  I just recently learned to eat artichokes (mainly because of those restaurant spinach appetizers)!  I followed recipe except for only using a half a jar of artichokes cause I was worried the kids wouldn't eat them.  I will definitely make again!

It was a tad dry for how I like mashed potatoes, so with a touch extra liquid this is a 5-star recipe! Such a simple side dish, and with potential to be far less fatty than mashed potatoes without sacrificing flavor! SO good!

Easy and healthy alternative to using sour cream and cream cheese.  I used vanilla soy milk, which makes recipes even more creamier!  This was something different and lots of good flavors to take in.  I will make this again!  :)

This was very good! Slightly dry but still quite tasty. I used vegan butter spread and soy milk to make it a vegan side dish for Thanksgiving! Thanks for sharing.

i would LOVE to give this recipe 5 stars, but it was just not THAT good! i was so excited to try it, but it was a let down. the only thing i did different was, diced my artichoke hearts instead of puree them. everything else was done according to the recipe. there was just no flavor beyond the normal "mashed potato" flavor. i was quite dissapointed. i may try again, if i happen to have some artichoke hearts that need to be used, but other than that, i will not buy them just for this recipe again

The artichoke taste was wierd and they were way too garlicky. Unfortunately, I served these to guests because they rated so high and no body liked them.

When I saw this recipe, I thought it sounded delicious!  But, it was very bland.  I doubled the recipe to make 12 servings.  I also  added a cup of sour cream, a teaspoon of horseradish, 1/4 cup more of butter, and used a total of 3 cloves of garlic.  This helped, but I would play around with it more before serving it to guests.

A nice change from the regular mashed tats I make.  Company enjoyed them but couldn't really tell it was artichoke it them, whether that is a good thing or not.  Next time I will use even more garlic and more artichokes.  Very creamy potatoes.

Well, this was slightly different. Not bad, my husband said it was okay, 3 of my kids came back for 2nds, my oldest child said it needed something. I love potatoes and I love artichokes. So I believed it could work, it did. But I think it needed something else as well. I salt and peppered to taste but it was still slightly bland. I didn't want to over salt the dickens out of it and be overly done with sodium, but I think I might add more garlic and possibly some italian blend seasonings the next go around.

Vegetables mashed together with potatoes is a typical dish in Belgium ("stoemp" or "rata"). I had never thought of trying with artichokes, though. The association is not bad but not something I would make again. I still prefer mashed potatoes with carrots or cabbage.

Made this today for a dinner with friends we were hosting and no one liked it :( It ended up bland and kind of tart. I think the artichokes took over the flavor too much. We tried to doctor it up with parmesan but it just wasn't very good. I'm so glad we made mac and cheese as well or we'd have no starch!

This is such an interesting twist! I like "dirty potatoes" so I used red and left the skin on. I needed non-dairy so I subbed chicken consomme for the milk. I also added an extra can of artichoke hearts since people said it lacked the artichoke flavor. Just a note for ease: if you're using a blender or processor, no need to mince the garlic cloves; just slice them and the blender will do all the work. Can't wait for leftovers today!

These are so good!  So creamy and awesome flavor.  I knew parmesan cheese would be a great addition, so I added 1/4 cup.  I added 1/4 tsp. salt to the water to boil the potatoes and 1/4 tsp. fresh ground black pepper to the mix.

These were a hit!  I used red potatos with the skins on, two cloves of garlic and found I didn't even need to add the butter.  Served this with 'Imitation Meatloaf' for a unique twist on a standard pairing.

These are awesome! Mom and I made these for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about them. We doubled the recipe, boiled a few cloves of garlic with the potatoes and mashed them together, made them a little creamier with half and half, and added 1/2 c - 1 c Parmesan cheese. It was amazing!

THESE ARE AWESOME!! It's so nice to be able to serve a healthy and equally delicious version of mashed potatoes. The only change I made was to add basil and rosemary to the milk mixture. I only used 1 Tbsp of butter, and a little more on top (i kept it warm and broiled it in the oven). The artichoke isn't overpowering at all, but it definitely gives it a distinct flavor, I will add more next time. A keeper, thanks for submitting!

I thought this was great, but my family barely touched them.  I think you really have to be an artichoke lover to appreciate this dish.

tasted pretty good but not worth the extra effort.  Plain mashed potatoes with buter and sour cream are just as good.

These were the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. Even better than the ones loaded down with cheese and ranch dressing. And WAY healthier!

I thought it was yummy and so did my son, but my DIL doesn't like artichokes so she wouldn't eat any and won't fix it.  I did add a bit of garlic and chopped up green onion.  That seemed to give it the zip it needed.....

What a great twist on the mashed potato.  I had bought artichoke quarters by accident, so I had to cut off the leaves.  Makes sure to just puree the hearts, otherwise it won't be creamy.  Next time I will definitely make sure to pick up just artichoke hearts.  I only added one clove of garlic, because I didn't want it to overpower the dish and I'm glad I did, because anymore and it would have.  Next time I will definitely try roasted garlic instead.  My little guy loved them, so I will definitely making these again. Thanks for the recipe!

My family loves artichokes and mashed potatoes so this was a no brainer.  They were awesome paired with the Pork Roast

These mashed potatoes were awesome!  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and cooked two garlic cloves with the potatoes.  So yummy!

These were an interesting change for tired old mashed potatoes, and would make a great side with so many dishes.  The artichokes add a unique *something*, and I think that it would be difficult for anyone to put their finger on it!  We had a ton left over, so I used them to replace the mashed baked potatoes in a baked potato soup recipe -- we LOVED that!  Can't wait to try these recipes out on others in the family.

Perfect and a nice change from plain mashed potatoes.  My son can't have milk so I used soy milk and it was fine.  We added a little grated parmesan on top and it was delicious!

These were good, rich and creamy like the previous reviewers noted, however, the artichokes gave it a nice nutty flavor, but I couldn't taste the artichokes as much as I hoped!
