I bartended through my college years and I have made many a LI Ice tea. This is a whopper of a drink. It has five oz. of hard liquor which only seems necessary if you want to get loaded. I made this with half shots and it still packed a punch. It was also way too sweet for us. Sorry, just NOT my cup of tea.
