WOW!  I was really surprised at how good this was.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so I put about a tablespoon and a half of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of pepper.  It was wonderful!  We put it over egg noodles.  I didn't realize that I forgot the cheese the first time around.  With the leftovers we had mozzarella, so we used that.  It was SO good.  I stirred it in a little first, then put more on top once it was on the plate and let it melt.  It was amazingly good.  I will definately make this again!

My family loved this recipe.  I thought it was very flavorful.  I changed it a little by using the juice of 1 fresh lemon and cracked pepper instead of lemon pepper seasoning. Also added some parsly flakes.  I served it over brow rice with asparagus on the side. Excellent.

This was NOT a keeper...we made toasted crab sandwiches topped with provolone cheese and it was bland to say the least.  Definately will NOT make this again.

I'm not sure if I disliked this recipe so much because I expected it to make a sauce or what but this turned out terrible. I served it over pasta and it just didn't work for me.

Thank you for this recipe. Without this recipe, and the other reviewers' comments, I would have NEVER considered using any product marked "imitation."

Per the other reviewers' comments, I served it on egg noodles.  I only used 1 tablespoon butter & I added about 4 oz of low fat cream cheese.  I used chicken broth to make the sauce a consistency that my family prefers.  My family loved it.

Dianne's use of lemon pepper, garlic and Romano cheese was perfect.  Per one of the reviewers, I added dried parsley for color and garnish. Thank you Dianne and thank you other reviewers!

Very very very different! I only use imitation crab for ceviche. I have never had anything like this. Will make this again, but add more seasoning.

This was good.  I shredded the crab, and should have cut it up a little finer.  I buttered and broiled French bread slices to serve it on.  Next time I would add a little more pepper and maybe some diced celery for some crunch.

Pretty good & easy. I used real crab & 1/3 cup mozzarella plus a sprinkling of parmesan & romano, also lots of extra black pepper. Served it with buttered & toasted italian bread. I will probably make it again, but might try fresh lemon next time.

This recipe is really good.  I did alter it a little bit after I made it the first time to suit my own tastes, but I have to admit. It's fantastic.  I used it as a topping on homemade pizza, on top of a quickly whisked up alfredo-type sauce as a base with a variety of soft cheeses on top.  It was gobble down really quickly, and only request was to add scallops next time!  Thanks for the great recipe, so quick and easy too!!

This recipe was tasty, cheap and easy to make.  I made a complete meal in less than 30 mins.  I saut√©ed frozen veggies with the garlic before adding the crab.  I didn't have enough imitation crab, so I added a can of crab too.  As another reviewer suggested, I used lemon juice and pepper.  I also added a bit of salt and replaced the romano with parmesan.  I tossed it with some pasta.  I would make this again.

Bland, the only thing that saved this meal was I served it on sourdough bread.  It gave it a little flavor.  DOES NOT Taste good reheated.  P.S. Another reviewer  after me said she changed it and it was good.   That is what happpens when you add some flavor to the recipe.

As a dip it was ok but if you bake it with bread crumbs for about 30 minutes and it's really great!

This recipe was a really wonderful starter. I had some lump crab and didn't know what to do w/ it, so this was great! I read the tag and it sd this would be good w/ a cream sauce, so as I was sauting the garlic, I added a little white wine and let the alcohol boil off. As I added the ingredients, I added a little more wine and a little more butter. I also added fresh basil and more lemon pepper than the recipe called for b/c I love lemon pepper. I added a little heavy cream at the endand let it all simmer together for a while. It didn't make a lot of sauce, just enough to lightly coat the noodles, which is probably a good thing since this isn't the healthiest sauce. It surprised me how well it turned out. Thanks for the great recipe!

Only okay.  I used half to one teaspoon lemon pepper & that was plenty.  More wouldn't have improved the taste.

Really good! However, I made quite a few changes because of my food issues. 1) I used real crab. Snow crab to be exact. 2) I used lemon zest and ground pepper instead of lemon pepper seasoning. 3) I didn't have ramano, but I did have Parmesan and feta... Awesome on toast points. I wish I would have had portabello mushroom caps, because I think it would make great stuffed mushrooms.

Yum!!  Quick and easy!  Next time I think I will toss the crab with the pasta before adding the cheese.  It clumped up a bit.  Obviously, not enough that we didn't enjoy it!

This was wonderful and full of flavor!  I am not sure what the 1st reviewer was talking about when she said it was bland!  I added 2Tbsp of Bacos and used grated Parmesan cheese instead of Romano.  I ate it plain without even any rice of pasta and it was lovely!  Very quick to throw together!

I added some pine nuts and broccoli for color and texture. I also substituted avocado oil for olive oil and Parmesan cheese for Romano. Probably would have been better with Romano. I also served it over egg noodles. It was filling, easy and yummy!

Fast and easy to make. Rather than chop the crab, I bought flaked imitation crab and mashed it. The pieces of crab were still substantial, but I figure that this process is faster than chopping. It was a little dry imo, so next time I think I may either cook with white wine or not add lemon pepper and add to tomato sauce. I also halfed the amount of butter asked for and thought it didn't compromise the taste.

Used real crab as opposed to imitation and completely omitted the romano.  Instead, after it cooked, I smothered the top with mozzarella and put it under the broiler to melt the cheese. Pretty good appetizer.

This is a super quick and easy way to prepare imitation crab. The flavor is simple but delicious, and could be easily tailored to individual tastes. I love it tossed with various pastas, with or without the cheese. Thank you so much!

I made this with real crabmeat and it came out good. I ate this on it's own but it would go great with pasta too.

A delicious and cheap meal. I added in some frozen peas and served with whole wheat penne pasta. It was great. Something we will be having a lot.
