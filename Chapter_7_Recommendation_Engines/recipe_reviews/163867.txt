Good recipe, but remember that Worcestershire sauce is NOT vegetarian unless you get a vegan version; regular Worcestershire has anchovies in it.  Also, use brown sugar instead of the honey if cooking for vegans.

Fantastic recipe!  Even my carnivore husband loves it.  I like to substitute extra firm tofu for the tempeh and use a full can of tomato sauce.

I've made this a number of times and love it. I'd give it 5 stars except I always have adjustments to make. I always add way more tomato sauce - usually the entire can worth. I tend to do less tempeh and more onion and bell pepper just because I like to load up on veggies where I can as well. I always double the garlic in any recipe too. Other than that, the flavors are spot on and this is a GREAT vegetarian alternative - and we're not even vegetarian! ;)

Thanks for the recipe, but be sure to make sure you get vegetarian Worcestershire sauce, since the original kind is made with fish. ^^

I had just bought my vegetarian worshtishire sauce and was surfing for a recipe to try it on... and voila'. This recipe whips up quickly. It's been over 14 years since I had a sloppy joe, but this certainly reminded me of what I used to enjoy. Small amount of clean up involved- the flavors are good with sweet initial flavor and a spicy aftertaste. I agree with another reviewer, my 8 year old thought it was too spicy, though I thought it was perfect. (I'm a mild salsa type gal). Very good flavor, I don't think it could pass as the real deal but certainly will pass this on to EVERY vegetarian/vegan I know (I think vegan use br. sugar in lieu of honey).  I used MorningStar for my tempeh/meat substitute.

After a long search for tempeh at the grocery strore I came up empty handed, so I used veggie ground round. So this rating may be a little "off". However I found the combination of spices to be just to much, will not be using this recipe again.

Very good and a great way to use tempeh (which we love but always use in stirfry).  It wasn't as saucy as I expected, so I added more tomato sauce and a little ketchup.  Good spices for us, actually too spicy for my toddlers so I'll cut back on the cayene and some others next time.

In the end the general consensus in my house was that this was pretty good, but probably won't be made again because the 20g of fat is more than we would like, not because it wasn't good though.  It did need a few modifications.   After I had followed the recipe exactly and sampled the results I was pretty disappointed.  As other reviewers have said it needed more tomato sauce, and I added about an extra tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. It was terribly dry and definitely did not resemble any sloppy joe I had ever had. With the additions it was much better, and as leftovers actually seemed to be much more tasty than the initial serving.

Wow, this is really good! I used extra firm tofu instead of tempeh, since it was what I had on hand. I halved the recipe but stuck to the 1/4 cup tomato sauce. I left out the celery seed since I didn't have that on hand, either, and I used vegan worchestershire sauce. This would be a great quick weeknight meal!

This was brilliant. Since other reviewers thought it needed more tomato sauce, I started with a big can and kept adding sauce until it tasted the way I wanted it to.

I'll give this five stars for the flavor, but next time I'll use ground beef and pick something else for Meatless Monday. Veggie ground needs to be deeply buried in a recipe to work, not be front and centre. I love love love the flavor of the sauce though and will definitely use this recipe again.

I did not care for this recipe as written. I added extra tomato sauce (as others suggested). I also added about 2 T chili powder, 1 T apple cider vinegar, about 1/3 cup ketchup, and an extra dash of salt & pepper. 

Also, I suggest adding the bell pepper when you add the onions, the bell peppers could use the extra cooking time for a softer result.

No way!  Tempeh is not a family favorite, apparently.  My husband was the only one who ate a whole sandwich.

Very nice recipe. It was a solid meal, but ends up being almost impossible to hold together on a burger bun -- may be best served in a pita pocket or tortilla shell for eating.

I think this recipe was pretty good. I did add more tomato sauce as some of the other reviewers suggested. I used only 1/2 the amount of oil to make it a little lighter and it still tasted great with all the spices. It had great flavor and my husband and 1-year-old enjoyed it!

I very much like this recipe and have made it several times.  I use a lot more tomato sauce than the recipe calls for.  I just pour until moist.  I also cut down on some of the Italian seasonings to adjust to my taste.  Overall, I love this recipe.  Very filling and easy.

Loved the taste, just didn't love the texture of the tempeh.  I loved that I could make up the sauce and use it with ground beef for the guy and with tempeh for me!  I'll try it again and try to brown up the tempeh more!  Thanks for the recipe!

Instead of the Tempeh, I used Tofu. For those people that don't know the difference, Tempeh is less processed than Tofu but if you can't find Tempeh, Tofu is a fine substitute. 
I gave this only four stars because it was a little on the spicy side, which can be tweaked. However, the molasses and honey, was a great kick to this dish.

Excellent, also doubled tomatoe sauce and garlic, and added tomatoe paste then used 'Smart Ground'. We are not vegetarians, but my family loved it.

The recipe would have received a 5 star if not for the fact that I had to add more tomato sauce, which technically changes the recipe. I don't know if different brands of Tempeh are more moist than others, so that may have been a factor.  Flavor is five star, texture is great too.  Will be making this again!

Being a vegetarian, I have had A LOT of vegetarian sloppy joe's. These were the best ones I have ever had! My boyfriend has recently jumped the meat train and joined me as a veg head, so he sometimes can be difficult to please, and he said these were the best Sloppy Joe's he has had...PERIOD!

I loved this recipe. The only things I changed were that I added a whole can of tomato sauce (I think the recipe as is is too dry), used extra firm tofu instead of tempeh, cut down on the spices slightly, and did not add the cayenne pepper at all. Put the mixture on whole wheat buns with cheddar cheese on top. Yum! I will definitely be making this again.

This is a nice way to use tempeh in something other than stir fry. We did use more 1/4C additional tomato sauce. Next time we'll half the recipe since we were cooking for just 2 and this made a lot of leftovers.

This is awesome. Per others' suggestions, I added some ketchup and extra tomato sauce. Also, left out the peppers and celery seed because I didn't have any.

Made as a condiment to baked potatoes. Yum! Replaced tempeh with 15oz can of black beans. Only 1/8 teaspoon of cumin. Add  1Tablespoon cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon of chili powder. Cook green pepper same time as onions. Used entire 15 oz can of tomato sauce. Keep on burner until bubble down to thick consistency. Love the molasses & spicy taste.

This was a tasty dish, but don't expect it to be interchangeable with meat sloppy joes.  It's better to think of it as its own thing.

I have and it was good, I had to replace with sugar as I didn't have any honey or brown sugar, made it a bit sweet, we are vegetarians so I used TVP in place of meat, all ingredients in the recipe are all great for the flavoring of TVP, I used catsup in place of tomatoe sause I couldn't make myself open a whole can of tomato sause just to use 2tablespoons +2tsp of tomato sause and I opened a can of roasted diced tomatoes for the liquid for the TVP made it excellent yummy next I won't use as much sugar next time I will have honey or brown sugar

Very yummy! My whole family enjoyed these! We used Lightlife's Veggie "ground beef" instead of tempeh and you'd never know you were missing meat! Also, skipped the molasses. Keeping this in our rotation.

This is a solid recipe.  That being said, I'm totally going to be that guy who made something very different from what the recipe says to do...

I made my own unseasoned marinara to serve as the base.  Dice a tomato or two, an onion and some garlic.  Mix in tomato paste and a touch of water.  Then season that sauce with the spices listed in this recipe until it tastes that way that you want it to taste.  I didn't use Worcestershire sauce.  I used Bragg's amino acids instead.  I do think it would be better the next time with a touch of brown sugar.  

I used the fake crumbly hamburger meat stuff instead of the tempe.  I mixed in some fresh black and pinto beans that i cooked in my pressure cooker.  I used some green and red pepper.  I served on a fresh organic ciabatta roll that I found in my grocery store's bakery.  

This is totally in the rotation.

Great!  I used a full can of tomato sauce, as recommended, left out the cayenne pepper for the little ones (would have been even better with it) and used protein veggie crumbles instead of tempeh or beef.  Turned out great.  Just the right amount of "sloppiness".

When I initially made this, it came out a little drier than I like for my sloppy joes so I doubled the recipe. The flavor is really good, but is not a "normal" sloppy joe. If I were to make it again, I would probably use more tomato sauce and less, if not none at all, of coriander.

Delish! I omitted the Worcestershire sauce (I am vegetarian and there are anchovies in most of those sauces) I used ketchup and chipotle seasoning instead. Topped with some nice cheese and soft rolls these were just what I needed as a comfort food on this chilly November night in New England.

We ended up using the TVP (Bob's Red Mill Textured Vegetable Protine) instead of tempeh.  Before making the recipe we soaked the dried TVP in Better than Bullion vegetable broth.  Using the TVP made a base that, in my opinion, was even tastier than if we had used ground beef.

I love this recipe, have made it many times.  The sloppy joes are so flavorful and delicious.  I do use 'Smart Ground' by a company called LightLife instead of the tempeh.  I think you would be hard pressed to tell its not meat.  Thanks for this great recipe, i love it so much, I created an account here just so I can rate it!

Personally I think you should triple the tomato sauce and cut the cumin and coriander by at least half. The original recipe is ok but you are very aware of the above mentioned spices. Everything else about the recipe is great.

Fabulous! We used whole wheat pita pockets to keep the calories low and made the sloppy joes - neat joes! Super yummy, super tasty.  My boyfriend and his roommate thought these were yummy as well. My first time using tempeh and I was very pleased! I will be making this again.

I'm trying to reduce my my meat intake so this recipe caught my interest.  I loved it.  So did the boy friend who is not trying to reduce his meat intake at all.  Like a lot of others I added more tomato sauce.  I also added a touch of salt, more cayenne ant topped them off with Sriracha.  We like it spicy.

Thanks for a new way to use tempeh, we'll make it again.  I did run mine through the food processor a little to break it up more like hamburger, kids never noticed the difference.  We also wanted more sauce and ended up doubling the sauce.  For our house it only fed 4 1/4 people.

This recipe was awesome. I used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire for my vegetarian friend. I did have to use 4 times the amount of tomato sauce and it still wasn't saucy though. Also I don't think I would add the thyme next time either, it kind of took away from the sloppy joe flavor.

I added ketchup only because I was out of sauce and substituted meatless crumbles instead of tempeh. We like using Hawaiian Bread for Sloppy Joe Sliders. My non vegetarian people like this recipe as well.

My only comment is that this can be a bit dry (using veggie crumbles). I'd use just one 12 oz package; I tried using 16 oz, per the recipe (for tempeh). I'd also add a whole small can of tomato sauce...more than a 1/4 cup. Otherwise, the flavors were awesome in this recipe. Best veggie sloppy joe I've had so far!

I thought these were excellent!  Maybe the tempeh gave it a deeper flavor?  I didn't have molasses nor coriander so left those out.  I would definitely try this with maybe turkey next time!
