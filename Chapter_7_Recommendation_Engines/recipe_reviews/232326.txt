We really liked this recipe!  I did substitute a few items and used green salsa Verde with 1/4 c. fresh chopped cilantro in place of the salsa. We had a side of Quinoa and roasted asparagus and it was a DANDY meal!

It was really good. I wish I would have doubled the rub and made twice as much. After spreading the rub on my steroid enhanced chicken breasts I saw that there was nowhere near enough. I compensated for my lack of rub by sprinkling on some chili powder. Be sure to use a flavorful salsa (Herdez medium slasa is what I used) this was quick and easy and my family loved it.

Simple, quick, and delicious! I needed something easy for a weeknight meal and this was a great way to enjoy Mexican without all the guilt! I sprinkled both sides of the chicken with the garlic powder and cumin plus a little chili powder. Since there's no need to brown the chicken first and opting out of the oil cuts back on the fat I sprayed an 8x8 baking dish with Pam and put the chicken topped with a 16 oz. jar of salsa in the oven and baked 350 for 45 minutes. The last 5 minutes I grated low fat Colby Jack cheese over top to melt. To make the presentation a little better to serve, I topped it with chopped green onion and sliced black olives. This was wonderful served with fat free plain greek yogurt (instead of sour cream),brown rice, and black beans. This has to be one of the easiest low fat meals ever!

I have made a similar tasty and easier recipe. Mix 3/4 cup salsa ( what ever heat you like) 3 tbsp of brown sugar and 1 tbsp of Dijon mustard. Pour over the chicken and bake for 45 min at 375 or 400. Sauce is awesome over rice or couscous . No need to sauté or add oil. Chicken is ALWAYS juicy.

I made this just as written with a quick salsa that I made myself.  It was wonderful with melted cheese and some sour cream on top.  My husband said to put it into rotation so that means it's a good one. The only thing I would change, and this was just if you're using fresh salsa, is to cook the salsa a bit before pouring it on the chicken and baking it. Mine tasted a little TOO fresh. I was fine with it, but my husband thought the salsa needed to be cooked.

I wanted to make a Mexican chicken bake that wasn't hard to make or full of cans of soup.  This was great, and my family loved it!  Will definately make again.

This recipe is really good.  I just got it a couple of weeks ago in an All Recipes daily email.  I have already made it twice and it's definitely a hit with my husband who even ate it for leftovers. One thing that made it easier for me is to cook the whole thing on top of the stove in the pan.  I just seasoned the chicken and browned it as recommended, poured the salsa on top, lowered the heat so it was just bubbling, covered it and cooked it for 15 to 20 minutes.  When the chicken was just about done I topped it with cheese.  YUM YUM and really quick.  BTW I may have used more spices than the recipe calls for.  I did not measure them just sprinkled both sides of the chicken with salt, pepper, cumin and garlic powder.  I think I used more salsa too, maybe closer to 2 cups.  Again, I did not measure just covered each piece of chicken in salsa.  I used mild as called for and the second time used the cheddar cheese I had on hand and it was equally good.

loved it. I would recommend a thin chicken breast or cut them open and filet or stuff them instead.

Definitely will make again. I had some chicken sitting in a homemade marinade of olive oil, lemon juice, and spices, then prepared it this way, just trading out the seasonings for what I had in the marinade. Then I fried it in the same marinade and baked it according to the directions, and it was top notch.

Healthy Mexican Chicken Bake Haiku: "Needed more flavor.  But points for ease & healthy. Use a good salsa!" As noted in a different review, using a quality salsa is pretty much key here. The recipe really didn't require the browning on the stovetop 1st, which could've cut out a step and made it even easier. I thought it was just OK, but needed more salsa, cheese and olives when I plated mine. The leftovers were nice sliced over a salad though!

I prefer to cut the chicken into bite size  pieces, season then cook. Add the salsa and some cheese on top. Place the skillet in the oven at 350° for about 15 minutes. Served over brown rice. It's perfect for our weekly meal prep. Delicious!!

We made a this and put it in the freezer for a  ready meal.. We used Sweetfire Salsa from Benton Harbor MI.
Followed it exactly.  Last night we got home from a trip and decided to thaw enough for the two of us (one breast) and had it with a salad.  Poured some extra sauce on the chicken and immediately  clicked it into our favorites.  Can’t wat to have company and make it for them.  Nice to have such a great make-ahead meal that freezes so well.
Thanks Joy!

This was sooo good and filling! I made a few changes. Used canola oil instead of vegetable oil. Doubled the amount of seasoning. Used natural seasonings instead of salt and pepper. Used two breasts instead of four. Used half the amount of cheese and half a cup of salsa.  Would definitely make again! Served it with Mexican style corn (added rotel peppers and butter) and refried beans .

Good recipe. Chicken stayed moist, although the entire dish mostly tasted like the salsa.   We will definitely eat again.

Made as is, (well with a little extra cheese) and it was EXCELLENT! My man and child loved it as well...
Made some jasmine rice on the side...cooked with a little salt, pepper, cumin and garlic. Went perfect as an accompaniment.

Just ok for me. Not enough flavor or spice for me. it just tasted like salsa poured over chicken. A decent recipe if your in a hurry though.

This was excellent! I am on a diet and this satisfied my cravings for Mexican food.  I followed someone else's suggestion and simmered it on the stove rather than using another dish and heating up the oven. I also used another reviewer's suggestion and sauteed red pepper and onion to add to it.  Great alternative to the normal chicken breast recipes.

Great! Followed recipe pretty closely. Had an empty spice bottle. Made the mix of suggested spices except salt and added a little poultry seasoning. Have extra for future use, or to add as desired. Mixed shredded Colby Jack and Mozzarella, that’s what I had. I used Green Mountain Gringo Hot Salsa. It’s low salt and my favorite! Put the deglazed sauce on the top and bottom of the chicken before the cheese and salsa. Placed chicken apart on a large sheet pan to avoid getting too much broth in the pan. To keep the deglazed sauce on better. Had butternut squash for the side. Will make again!

I made this basically the same, except for adding cayenne to the rub. I'm frustrated by the all the water that comes out of chicken (seems to always happen)  even after sautéing in oil. It dilutes the sauce to a watery finish. Cooking out the water ahead of time can overcook the chicken.

Easy and tasty. I browned the chicken in an iron skillet and then added the cheese and salsa and put it directly in the oven. It saved transferring to another  pan.

I loved it!  The flavor of the salsa on the chicken added a little "kick" to the flavor.  I also used a little sour cream to dip my chicken into.  I will definitely make it again!

My family loved this recipe. We used a mild salsa since I have a 5 year old but the chicken came out great and juicy. My kids even asked for seconds.

My husband loves this one but it takes the chicken much longer to cook then the recipe says, in my experience. The next time I make it I will butterfly the chicken to be sure it is cooked well without drying it out.

Kind of an average but good meal. I used Pace picante sauce but drained the liquid off.  It stuck to the chicken and didn't create a lot of liquid in the pan.  I used twice the amount of cheese, probably makes it "unhealthy".  I will make again. Family liked it.

For a recipe that's easy enough to make with ingredients you probably already have on hand, this is one tasty dish. And easy enough, too: just brown the chicken (after sprinkling on the spices*), then transfer the pieces to a (slightly greased - e.g. with Pam) baking dish, cover the pieces with salsa from the jar, sprinkle on the cheese (I had cheddar, so I used that and it tasted just fine) plus, at my son's urging we also scattered some black olives over the cheese, and then baked the assemblage for 25 minutes or so...and wow - it looked so pretty I forgot to take a picture of it, but believe me - it was pretty - and we ate every bit of the 2 pounds of chicken tenders I'd used for it.  Bravo, whomever you are who thought of this simple but tasty and just a tiny bit different evening meal!
*Tip: you probably want at least 1.5 recipes of the spice mix that gets sprinkled on the chicken just before it gets browned, but I made a double-recipe based on some of the other reviews and that was really more than we needed.

This really surprised me!  It was so good, lots of flavor!  I did double the seasonings and used it as a rub.  I may have used a little more cheese than called for, but I don't think it even needed the cheese.  So delicious!  I will be using this recipe again..maybe in the slow cooker to use for burritos.

Wow, we like spice, so more spices were added, and it turned out great.   With a large family I have to double recipes, so this was quick and delicious.   Served with aspanish rice and black beans.   Awesome!

The only addition was some celery ( I needed to use it  up) I also cooked up baked potatoes  (needed to use these up too) and used the extra sauce along with sour cream over potatoes and this was just delicious!  I did cut down on cumin as I thought it would be to strong. Only used half of the amount. This is fast and so good!

I have had to start a VERY low salt diet, and this chicken dish really had the flavor and variety that we like.  I live in Guatemala and it is hard to find store-bought salsa that isn't filled with salt, so I make my own from roasted tomatoes, onions, garlic and cilantro.  I followed the recipe except for adding salt, and we had a very satisfying, hearty dish for dinner.  Next time I will add a bit more heat to it, but it was fast and delicious.  thank you for a great recipe.

I changed it a little, used chicken thighs, turned out great!! just  put the thighs in a pan, tossed some santa Barbara medium salsa and baked for approx. 1 hr. used rice on the side, could have used corn bread, maybe next time...was fantastic!! the thighs were great left overs, not like breasts, that dry out so quick.

Definitely a five star.  My son and daughter-in-law were here and I wanted to try something different.  I made these along with Uncle Ben's Mexican rice, corn and corn bread.  The entire meal was quick, easy, filling and consumed in a short amount of time.

Really enjoyed this one! Finding something tastey and healthy do do with chicken gets difficult because there's not many options but this was great! I used half regular salsa and half green salsa verde. And also had avocado to serve on the side, yummy!

It was delicious. Difinitely would make it again! I just baked it in the oven first instead of browning it on the stove.

With a recipe that sounds so simple you'd expect that it would be very tasty, but this one really is. The salsa combined with the other ingredients takes on more of a marinara flavor but with a kick. It's really good.

absolutely delicious, taste like an expensive mexican food dish (especially if you make it with authentic salsa) the chicken was so juicy and flavorful.

 we had refried beans and cheese quesadillas with it!

Great, easy to make meal for the family, who loved it. I especially appreciate the video provided!
For sides I did a can of refried beans and plain rice, but next time I'd like to make some Mexican rice and black beans if I can find good recipes for them, for which the taste will not clash with the main meal.

I made this and admittedly made some changes and it still turned out fine.  Instead of the seasonings, I coated the chicken with taco seasoning.  I cooked the chicken completely in the pan, topped it with the cheese and covered the pan to melt the cheese.  I warmed some salsa in the microwave and topped the chicken with the warm salsa when plating.    I garnished the chicken with chopped green onion tops, sliced back olives and added a dollop of sour cream.  Skipping the oven made this a really quick and easy recipe.    I’ll do this one again!

I just found and made this today! It's such a easy dish to make, I made a few changes, instead of cumin, I used smoked paprika and in place of olives for garnish, I used green chilli  peppers. I also made this in a convention oven  ( cuts down heat in the house ). You ought to try it!

I gave the recipe 4 stars because I made 1 change.  I doubled the spices (cumin & garlic power) 2 teaspoons of each.  I followed the rest of the recipe without any changes.  We really enjoyed the dish!  The chicken was very flavorful and super moist.  I will make it again!

This is the easiest recipe. I made it even easier by browning the chicken in an oven safe skillet. Then there is no need to transfer so only one pan to clean! If you like crunch you can top it with crushed tortilla chips or strips the last few minutes of baking.  I served it with pre cooked Spanish style brown rice, canned beans and salad. Doesn't get any easier than that. If you want to keep it low carb just skip the beans and rice and serve Mexican style green beans, squash, and/or cabbage instead. My grandmother's Recipe was to sauté fresh garlic which had been crushed in a molcajete with Mexican spices. Add fresh cut vegetables, continuing to sauté for a few minutes. Then add canned tomatoes with green Chilis, cover, and simmer until tender. Of course if you don't have a molcajete, which is a Mexican mortar and pestle made out of basalt stone, you can use a regular mortar and pestle. To make it easier I usually just use garlic paste in a tube and already ground spices. Not quite as flavorful, but still pretty good.

I made this as written with the exception of using Colby Cheese instead of Mexican Cheese Blend. The chicken breasts were moist and had a lot of flavor. This has definitely made it to my make again list. Thanks for sharing.

I followed this recipe exactly but added a few steps at the end... I shredded the chicken and made soft tacos. For toppings I used Salsa, Plain Greek Yogut (instead of sour cream) & lettuce. It was amazing!

Very good and easy! I used a small jar of On The Border salsa (which we love!) instead of just one cup.  Also waited and added the cheese the last 5-10 mins of cooking time so that it wouldn't burn.  Will make again!

This was much better than I thought it would be since Mexican blend cheese is fairly bland as is. I used a medium salsa and used chili powder instead of cumin as I didn't have any cumin on hand and it came out great! The juices were perfect and this would go very well over a bed of rice. Definitely try this one for a quick and tasty meal!

Exactly what the reviews promised. Easy and mainly healthy. Used Rotelo can along with salsa since had purchased 6 big chicken breasts. In addition to adjusting for the larger number of chicken breasts, increased the ingredients the spices (except no added salt) as suggested by several All Recipe reviewers. Thank you all for an easy and tasty dinner :-)

Very easy to make and very delicious! I would recommend making your own salsa or picking one you really enjoy for this as not all salsas are the same.

Super good!  My only problem was that the chicken came out a little dry.  I probably baked it too long, since I'm always afraid of undercooking chicken.  I will definitely make this again, but probably bake a little higher (375) for 20 minutes only.

I made it with just three chicken breasts instead of four, used the same quantities though. It was awesome.

This recipe is SO easy and healthy, I make this all the time now.  I don't measure the seasonings and use a Mexican spice mix (Mexican Heat) that I sprinkle on each side of the chicken when browning with a little pepper and garlic powder.  The spice mix I use has a bite to it so that adds an extra kick, but otherwise I make this recipe exactly as written.  I also use a 2% fat Mexican cheese mix (Kraft) to make it even healthier., and whatever salsa I have on hand.  It's great, my boyfriend loves it.  To keep it low carb I generally serve this with sautéed green beans sprinkled with Old Bay seasoning (found on this site, so good), and a salad.  However, this is also great with rice and beans and sour cream too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Like previous review - I would either double or triple spice recipe. I added lemon pepper seasoning as well. Also sautéed medium sized yellow onion and 3 large mushrooms (all sliced somewhat thick) with chicken breasts. Next time I would add seeded jalapeño slices to sauté (unless using a hot salsa). I would also bake it covered with foil as the chicken was a bit dry. 
The spice mix (although I know I said to triple it) the  cheese and the salsa all made the sodium content kind of high.

Excellent, easy to make. I usually need more of the rub than the recipe calls for, but I use chicken strips instead of whole breasts.

Yum. Double the sauce and I added a small can of green chiles. Served with brown rice and green beans.

I fixed this tonight for dinner. Reduced the serving size for 2 - it's just me and my husband.  It took very little time, effort, and expense, but came out AMAZING.  I've got plans to take this recipe and "run" with it by changing it up from time to time just to keep hubby on his toes!!  We both really enjoyed it and cleaned our plates.  I served it with fresh, steamed green beans and corn-on-the-cob.  He thought I'd slaved hours on what he called a "gourmet meal."  This is a keeper!

We loved this recipe!! It will be a regular. Used my own homemade salsa that has less vinegar because I pressure cook it. I think if I were to use store bought, I would add a bit of sugar. My husband was still raving as he left the kitchen.
