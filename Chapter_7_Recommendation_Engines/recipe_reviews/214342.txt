Good light, refreshing, guilt-free summer treat. When I need something a little dressier for guests, I whip 1 cup of heavy cream and sweeten with 2 packets of Splenda, and replace the Cool Whip with this. I also puree half the strawberries before stirring them in. These two measures make for a sensationally rich taste. So worth the extra calories! Have made it several times, peach Jello with chopped peaches, and our favorite, cherry Jello with strawberries.

One of my favorite childhood recipes that I craved and my mom had no idea what I was talking about. You really need to let it cool down with the ice before you add the whipped topping or it will separate. Several people have asked for this recipe.

This was just what I needed today. Cool, sweet treat for the kids and I without much guilt involved. Portioning them out into small dessert dishes was a good idea. I bet making this with orange jello it would be almost like a Dreamsicle.

Very good for diabetics! I made this with cream cheese and a fruit cocktail, with artificial sweetner and they had no idea it was healthy!

Wow, how easy does it get...and good, too!  This is a very light and flavorful dessert.  Nobody ever would know how easy it is to make.  There's no nutritional info on this recipe, but if made as written, gotta be guilt-free.

We really enjoyed this! Very fresh, light dessert. Perfect ending for our big Sunday dinner. I usually do not like any type of sugar substitute or "sugar free" due to the terrible after taste but I really couldn't detect that as much in this dessert. My husband said that he couldn't tell that it was sugar free at all. I am looking forward to changing up the fruits/JELL-O flavors. Pleasantly suprised at the texture and flavor. Pretty presentation also. Great dessert!

Who would have thought Jello and Cool Whip could taste this good.  I also made this with raspberries - thanks for the idea CC.  I have loads of raspberries, so this was a good way to use them.  This came together in minutes and then chilled in the fridge.  It is a light, refreshing, summertime dessert or snack.
