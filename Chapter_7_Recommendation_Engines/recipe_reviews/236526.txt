I am hooked on this--a great way to cook up the eggs my hens produce daily. The wasabi and pickled ginger really make it pop! I make it with lite mayo. It's great mashed together as egg salad too. Spoon onto Romaine lettuce leaves and add some diced cukes for a cool, refreshing, healthy meal!

This is a keeper! I made this recipe twice, the first time as instructed, and the second time, with twice the wasabi and a dash of cayenne pepper on each egg for a little extra heat. The second version is my favorite but both are very, very good!

Great variation! I topped the finished deviled eggs with Tobiko (flying fish roe) for added color and crunch. Beautiful!

These were fantastic. Didn't have the onions or pea shoots. The ginger brought all the flavors together. This will forever be our 'go-to' recipe for deviled eggs.

I made a double batch with a plan to fill the eggs the next day for a potluck.  They didn't make it!!  I had to make another double batch before the potluck and my family was watching me like starving zombies the entire time!!

I used sweetened Saki instead rice wine vinegar. I substituted chives for the green onion. It was a winner! Pot luck gold for anyone who likes Wasabi. They were half gone 15 minutes after we got there.  Just for perspective, I hated deviled eggs. Now, I love them.

So simple to make and quite different from the everyday deviled eggs.  Definitely will make again.  Didn't have the garnish items so served them without and still was a great hit!

The only thing I did to change this recipe is I used a wasabi mayo to save a step but otherwise it was all we hoped it to be a picnic favorite

I will definitely make again.  I left off the ginger and pea shoot but sprinkled Spanish Paprika instead.  I made the Wasabi paste.  Dry Wasabi mixed 3 to 1.  3 t Wasabi and 1 t water  makes paste.  Mix then turn  bowl upside down for a minute.  Makes 1 1/2 t just right.

Love this, and it's a hit with my foodie friends! It's terrific as is, but if you don't have pea shoots or pickled ginger on hand,  you can mix in 1-2 tsp of minced ginger with the yolks, and use a little triangle of crisp cucumber sticking up out of the middle of each half. This adds a nice crunch.
My fav add-in  now is to also sprinkle on each a pinch of shiso furikaki (a rice topping that comes in lots of flavors--in this case, red shiso leaf and salt). YUM!

Quite a hit with my Mahjongg friends!  One suggestion:  mix the mayo, etc.  before blending in with the egg yolks, much easier.  I sprinkled finely chopped  green onion on top, as I didn't have pea shoots.

What a great change to the normal deviled egg. I would like to up the wasabi next time to see if I could get a hotter flavor. Love how it looks and would be great to take to a party.

This turned out better than expected! I love Wasabi but these eggs were still a little strong for me so I will be adding less next time.

This is a favorite and my go-to recipe if vegetarian or Jewish friends might be present at a covered dish lunch (my other go-to has deviled ham). Usually use wasabi mustard  instead of straight wasabi paste since I don't want them too spicy. Pickled ginger adds a bit of zing.
