The caramels really need to be cut in half; they run all over the cookie sheet while baking if left whole.  The caramel also gets VERY hard after the cookies have cooled...a couple seconds in the microwave seems to help.

They aren't the prettiest cookie. And I cut the caramel candy into pieces so that the caramel would spread

it is not sweet enough, too dry and too much oats...the only thing nice is it is chewy enough where the caramel is and the texture is better than other cookies...but i will not make that again

These cookies are dry, very messy, and not at all attractive.  The first batch I baked almost ruined my cookie sheet because the caramel ran everywhere.  It helped to flatten the cookie or cut the caramels in half, but they still didn't taste good.  I wish I would have read the other reviews before trying this recipe!

I've found that cutting the caramels in half keeps them from running over the cookie onto the pan. You end up with a caramel puddle in the middle - which I like.

Yes, they were moist, but I had a hard time getting the carmel to melt before burning the cookie.  I wouldn't make this recipe again.

These did not work at all for me.  The cookie part was good (and I used the parts of them that I could for another recipe), but the caramel was so hard that it was inedible.  I think the caramel needed to have some cream or butter added to it so that it would stay softer.

I loved the taste of these cookies! They aren't really the prettiest thing. I tried to drizzle the caramel and that was a mess and hard to clean up! If you try to push down the caramels they sink into the middle of the cookie and makes the cookie fall apart. The caramel also got really hard after it cooled.

Sorry but I did not care for these :-( Doubled the ingredients and in the end, only 33 were salvageable. Find another cookie recipe, there are tons of good ones out there!

Very delicious and the caramel gives a great added flavor to the oatmeal.
