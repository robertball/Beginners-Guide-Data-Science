This was an OK recipe as it stands but needed more flavor. I made it a second time to see if I could spruce it up. It was awesome. I added 1/2 cup of white wine, 2 tablespoons butter, jumbo shrimp and little neck steamers (in their shells).

This is an absolutely delicious  meal and its just beautiful to look at. It has wonderful texture. Definiely use FRESH Basil.  I also added shrimp. After the pasta was cooked I sauteed it in a couple tablespoons of olive oil and minced garlic and tossed the pasta in with the sauce and let it simmer for 5 minutes to soak in the flavors. Its a gorgeous looking dish and so tasty. A perfect summer meal and I'm sure I'll make this quick meal during the Christmas shopping season. Its comfort food also. Hope I can find fresh basil during the winter months.

Really delicious. Don't be shy about adding a little more flavor, some more garlic.. add some freshly ground black pepper too. It certainly doesn't need a pound of pasta. I used 1/2 box and it was more than enough. For a healthier option, use whole wheat fettuccine or spaghetti. It adds flavor to the meal. I used sea scallops instead of bay scallops (what the store had, and my personal preference) and they were great. I just chopped them up into smaller, bite-sized pieces. My mom and sister loved it so much, they kept my copy of the recipe and make it all the time.

I've tried many recipes for scallops, this one is the best! Didn't have roma tomatoes on hand, so I added a can of diced tomatoes. Will make this one again and again!!

This was a simple dish to make and it tasted good.  The only recommendations I would make would be to use a thinner pasta (the fettucini just seemed to overwhelm the scallops) and use less red pepper.  One change I did make was that I used cut up sea scallops instead of bay scallops.  The whole family ate this dish and enjoyed it, including our kids (ages 6 and 4).

Made this last night and husband loved it! We are having company tonight and I am making it again! I didn't have fresh basil and forgot to put it in until almost before serving. Tasted just fine. Also, I added ground cayenne because my pepper flakes didn't smell as fresh as they should have been. It was spicy; salt content and flavor were on the mark. Used a small can of diced tomatoes also. The easiness and quickness of this dish is unbelievable. Try it.

I added the scallops at the last minute so I wouldn't overcook them. I found this recipe is better prepared ahead of time and reheated in the microwave.  The flavors were more intense.  This is a quick, easy and delicious meal and I will definitely make it again.  My husband raved over it!

This was a really good summer pasta dish.  I sauteed onions with the garlic and I also added sugar snap peas, since I had them.  This is definately a keeper!

This recipe is fast, easy, and very tasty. I used regular tomatoes because that's all I had, and I went a little heavy on the cheese. I will make this one again! Thanks Lisa!

I added some ingredients to give it some more flavor.  i added about 1/4 c chopped onions and 1/8 c chopped red bell pepper.  Per another review I added butter and white wine before put in the scallops. I also added 1tbsp of fresh lemon juice.  Also, I didn't have FRESH basil so I used some dried basil from our garden in the summer--I put in about 3 tbsp.

This was a really good dish. I substituted the Scallops for chicken because we are not big on scallops. It turned out really nice and I even enjoyed the leftovers for lunch the next day! mmmm good!

Oh my!! This was fantastic!! I have tried countless pasta recipes, and my family and I all agree that this is our favourite! I did, however, make a number of changes: I (1) halved the recipe, except for the pasta, which I used 1/3 pound, (2) used angel hair pasta instead of fettuccine, (3) used paprika instead of red pepper flakes, (4) sauteed half a minced onion and half a cup of sliced mushrooms along with the garlic, (5) added 5 jumbo shrimp sauteed in margarine, (6) did not used Parmesan (my family is not a fan), (7) added a couple dashes of ground black pepper, and pretty generous helpings of garlic powder (not garlic salt) and roasted red pepper powder, (8) used 1/4 cup fresh basil and 1 tsp pesto instead of 1/2 cup fresh basil, (9) used 1 large tomato, minced/pureed instead of 2 chopped roma tomatoes, (10) added 1/2 tsp brown sugar, and (11) sauteed the scallops before adding to the pasta. These changes made this dish out of this world!! I highly recommend this!

Amazing recipe. I was generous with all the ingredients. I added mushrooms in with the zucchini, butter, and white wine.  Also used whole grain pasta with some butter and dried basil after it was done.  Will do again and again!

This is awesome!! But, like others, I made a few changes.  There were so many comments about how there wasn't enough sauce, I started with double the sauce ingredients - partly because I was overloaded with fresh zucchini!! - and I treated the sauce like I do Italian sauces.  I prepared the sauce first, including the fresh basil, and let it simmer for at least 30 minutes, longer is better, just keep an eye on it so the liquids don't cook away. Then I added the scallops and simmered them slowly in the sauce until done. Doing this really helps all the flavors to blend.  This is so easy to adjust to your own tastes. Add tomato paste and a dash - or two - of clam juice (like I did), white wine, or whatever other liquids may strike your fancy for taste and consistency. And the sauce would definitely do well with angel hair pasta, linguine, fettucine, or just good ol' spaghetti!!  I used small scallops, and based on the size of the scallops and the amount of sauce, I agree that small scallops are better for this particular recipe, too.

Wonderful recipe and I, too, made some changes. Half the pasta was enough and pre-cooked shrimp were used instead of scallops so no sauteing was needed with them. I used 1 can diced tomatoes, and added Old Bay, butter, white wine and black pepper to the simmering sauce.  This meal was money - thanks so much for the posting!

Made this for my boyfriend and I yesterday and he loved it! Great as leftovers too. Made some minor changes: used 8 sea scallops (about $14) and seared them separately in the same pan, after making the olive oil/zucchini/tomato concoction. That way it still had the flavor but I could carefully monitor them. Cooked until slightly brown on both sides of the sea scallop. Then used mushrooms/onions as well to add more stuff to the sauce. I used an Italian tomato instead, diced. Used 1/4 tsp dried basil instead of fresh and it was very flavorful. The red pepper flakes were key in giving this dish it's pizzazz so don't forget to add it!

This made 4 portion sizes, one big plate per person for din, and 2 tupperwares for lunch the next day.

I made this dish, looking for ways to get rid of some bay scallops.  I always know it's a REALLY good recipe when my intention is to make it just to get rid of ingredients, then I end up buying more of those "unwanted" ingredients just to make the recipe again!!  I made some small changes but they wouldn't really affect the recipe much. Changes: doubled the garlic (added in in the middle of cooking when I realized I could barely smell/taste the garlic), simmered everything in a splash of wine wine, and added about 1 Tbsp of half and half near the end (another ingredient I needed to get rid of).  I also mixed the parmesan right in with the sauce.  SO GOOD and healthy!!!!!!

Pretty good overall.  Definitely not enough sauce to cover 1 lb of pasta like the recipe states, so I would make less pasta or more sauce.  Nice light flavor.

This was 4-star restaurant kinda good! I tweaked recipe like others suggested (added white wine, onion, added butter to oil when cooking onion,garlic and zucchini, used shrimp and mussels instead of scallops, and used 3 roma tomatoes-1 can italian stewed-1 can diced and added a few ladels of well salted pasta water to flavor and thin out sauce some). Used dried basil but fresh parsley and was fulla flavor (hint: when using dried herbs, crush them between your fingers, it releases the flavors). I tossed the cooked pasta pasta with 2 pats of butter, a splash of olive oil and another clove of garlic after draining.  I used linguine instead of fettuccine but note, this was REALLY messy, the sauce was flying everywhere so wear a BIG BIB LOL.. my husband (the italian) raved and I mean RAVED about this dish! We can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow night as it will just get better sitting overnight.. will make this again!!

This dish was delish!  I think the fresh grated Parmesan cheese gave it the finishing touch!  The changes I did:  mixed fresh basil with dried and used less than called for because I ran out of the fresh. Per other reviews, I added 1/4 cup white wine and 1/2 t. Old Bay.  I added, at the end, 1/4 lb cooked shrimp.  Also use much more of the Parmesan cheese than stated.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very flavorfull. I did add 1/4 c. of white wine at the end, when simmering, a few more extra garlic cloves. Also added shrimp that I cut up, and it was great. Will definetely make this one again. We do a dinner exchange on Friday nights, so I will serve it for everyone then.

Great recipe… I followed the directions, and read some of other reviews.  The garlic, tomato, basil, olive oil base is great. I also used sea scallops as many of the others did. The crushed red pepper adds quite a zing.  Admittedly, I used a grating mill shaker, so I did not measure, but added a generous amount. I enjoyed the hotness; some may want to taste and add more sparingly. You could make this adding asparagus, artichokes, olives, or whatever ever pasta favorite additive you enjoy.  I will definitely this make again. It was nice as written, but I would to hesitate to mix it up. Have fun with this recipe, it’s fast, delicious and has a nice presentation. Thank you for sharing Lisa!

This was amazing!  The only thing I changed was to add about a 1/2 t. Old Bay seasoning.  This will be a regular item on our menu!

Thank you so much for this recipe! I made it for my boyfriend and he told me again the next day how much he enjoyed it, and he doesn't even really care for scallops! I only made a few changes; I used less tomato, substituted heart-healthy pasta and sauteed minced onions with four cloves of garlic, doubled the crushed red pepper, and used a bit of ground black pepper as well. I have added it to my collection of recipes that I will definitely be making again! Thank you for a healthy and delicious meal!

This recipe has great, great potential, as you can tweak it to just how you like it. I made it tonight with all the fresh ingredients from my garden and farm market. I added about 8 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms, 1 chopped onion and half an eggplant, peeled and cubed. We're also watching fats, so I maybe used 2 tablespoons of olive oil, max. Didn't miss the extra. I only used the 3 cloves of garlic as indicated, but I feel it needed more. I also agree with Tanya93 in that there wasn't enough sauce to match the pasta (I used cappellini). It was only enough for about 1/2 pound of pasta. Oh yeah, the other change was that I didn't have scallops but I did have tilapia, so I placed the fillets in the vegetable mixture for the last 5 minutes and covered the pan. They could've probably used some additional seasonings, such as garlic powder or some Emeril's. We really liked it...very fresh tasting, and fairly "guilt-free"!

Delicious! I made this with fresh zucchini, garlic, paste tomatoes, thyme and basil from the garden.  Added 1T dry vermouth to the pan after browning onion, garlic and zucchini then added fresh peeled and chopped tomatoes and chopped fresh basil and thyme.  Separately pan-seared four large ocean scallops per serving then finished poaching in the sauce.  Added some salt and fresh ground black pepper, then served over rice. Yum!  Definitely a do-again!

SO GOOD!!!  I couldn't stop eating it!  Didn't change anything except thinly sliced the zucchini instead of dicing and added a few more cloves of garlic.  Used fresh basil.

Delicious!  So quick and easy! I did not have any scallops on hand but did have shrimp. On the advice from others I added some Old bay Seasoning to the shrimp while they were cooking. I also reduced the olive oil and added some white wine. I served it with some crusty garlic bread. Yummy.

Excellent recipe with recommendations of other reviewers; I added Old Bay seasoning while scallops simmered, added approx. 1/2 cup of white wine and about 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.  DH has already requested to have this again and very much liked this pasta dish.  Thanks Lisa for a great post!

The flavor of this recipe is nice and simple, I must admit, it's just right about of everything.  However, scallops cooked like this is just not that good.  I would definitely saute the scallops seperately with some seasoning and olive oil, and then add them to the mix later.

This recipe is wonderful, after a couple of tweaks. I saute zuchinni, red bell pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes in olive oil, then strain the liquid from a can of diced tomatoes and blend the basil into it.  Then I add the tomato/basil mixture and the reserved diced tomatoes to the pot and simmer for a little bit before tossing it with linguine.  It turns out wonderful!  I have tried it with shrimp and scallops, but I prefer it this way - just vegetables.

Like some of the other reviewers, I found this to be very bland if you make it exactly according to the recipe; that's why I gave it only two stars. The oil and veggies simply don't make enough sauce, especially if you use the entire pound of pasta like the recipe calls for. The pasta will be very dry. Also, if you use dried basil, you only need 1/4 to a 1/2 cup, to use 1 cup would be a cooking disaster! To make this recipe better, I added onion, a 4 oz. can of mushrooms, white wine and lots of Old Bay Seasoning. If I made it again, I would use a thinner pasta, like angel hair (and only half a pound) and I would mix lemon juice and some butter with the oil. You may also want to peel the tomatoes b/c the skins will get funny, especially the next day.

This is a completely lovely, just lovely dish!  Don't let the simplicity of the ingredients fool you -- when made as-written, particularly with the fresh basil, this is full of gentle, well-balanced flavor, and is extremely nutritious.  I am planning on repeating this one for our guests this weekend!  
The only thing I changed was searing the scallops first, separately, just because that's the way we like them.  Otherwise, I recommend this as-is!

I made this for company on the weekend, and even though its simple, who would of thought of this combination.  My company loved it.  The only thing I did was add extra tomato, but would definitely make it again.  You can start this just before your company arrives.

This was a very yummy pasta dish that came in handy when I had some zucchini to use up and some extra scallops. I did find it a little bland though, maybe because I left out the fresh basil because I am not much of a fan of it. Instead I added a can of Italian style stewed tomatoes, about a 1/4 lb of jumbo shrimp, and 1/4 cup of chopped onion. I also tossed my pasta in fresh parsley and 1/2 tsp of garlic salt. This was delicious:)

Delicious!!! I used linguine instead, and as per some other reviews, added a bit (1/2 cup) of white wine. It didn't even need the Parm on top! I also used scallop "pieces" that were less expensive and just the right size for this meal and homegrown tomatoes which added extra flavor. I also only used half of the pasta in the linguine box. I ate one portion and my husband ate the rest of it!!!

My wife thought this dish was OK, nothing special, but I liked it quite a bit. I would make this again for sure. We used dried basil instead of fresh, only about 1/8 cup (for 4 servings) and that was plenty. We also added some mushrooms, white wine and butter near the end. Be aware - this dish starts out with very little liquid, but once you add the tomatoes, it produces an abundance of liquid. I would suggest 'draining' the tomatoes or otherwise trying to get some of the liquid out before you add them. We let it simmer to reduce for about 5 extra minutes.

My family and I really enjoyed this meal.  I did make just one major change - instead of scallops I used pinto beans (I didn't have any scallops).  It was so good we would make it this way again.  Besides this change, I followed the recipe to the T.

This was AWESOME -- definitely a "keeper" recipe.   It was so colourful with the green zucchini (I kept the skin on) and the red tomatoes.  I didn't use red pepper flakes but did add 1/3 cup dry red wine.  As well, I used spaghettini noodles (about 300 g) instead of fettuccine as I prefer a lighter noodle.  I also thickened the sauce at the end with a little cornstarch -- easier to adhere to the pasta!

Simple & fresh....Like other reviewers, I used angel hair and chopped up sea scallops in lieu of fettuccine and bay scallops. This reheats easily!

This dish was wonderful - so light, yet delicious. I used angel hair pasta b/c it's my favorite. There wasn't enough sauce to warrant using fettuccine pasta. I thought more of this recipe than my husband, but I think that is b/c it was a little too spicy for him. I did 1/2 pound bay scallops and 1/2 pound shrimp. And I added green onions in with the zucchini. I will definitely be making this again!

This was actually much better than I expected.  It has a very refreshing lightness to it because of the fresh tomatoes and zucchini.  The kick from the red pepper flakes is perfect.  This is a definite keeper that I will be making again!

This is a great base recipe.  It is fast and easy and easily modified to fit your families tastes.  I used a tad more olive oil so it would be more saucy.  The whole family loved it.

This is a delicious summer dish! I ended up using shrimp in place of scallops, only because that is what I had on hand. I would like to try it with the scallops next time. I did find that 1 lb. of pasta is way too much for the sauce. I used a 13.5 ounce package & still had leftover noodles. Also I only used a couple tablespoons of olive oil, and it was plenty. Good flavors and a great way to use up some of those summer veggies!

Wow, this surprised me. I made it because I had all the ingredients. (I used a can of diced tomatoes.) I thought the ingredients sounded boring, and that there would be way too much basil... but it was all perfect! Super fresh-tasting. I was really, really glad to have leftovers. I think I'd use less pasta next time.

Fantastic recipe - A new household favorite! I did add extra olive oil, garlic and salt for more flavor. I also simmered the broth a little longer than suggested to allow a rich tomato broth to form.

I was happy to find a recipe calling for ingredients that were already in my kitchen. Even without fresh basil, this dish turned out fantastic! I was so glad to have leftovers! Thank you!

One Word: YUM!
My husband never eats anything without pasta, so I set out to find something a little different than his usual fare.  This hit the spot!  I only had Sea Scallops so I chopped them in 4's in place of the Bay Scallops and it turned out great.

This was a delicious meal! I did add 1/2 cup of white wine as one reviewer suggested. So glad I did.. I'm sure the recipe would have been just as good but I felt it was a great addition as it added extra flavor and juice to the pasta. Next time I will try adding more fish such as mussels or shrimp. Thank you for the recipe!! :)

This came out great! I added a splash of white wine and diced black olives along with the scallops and topped with fetta cheese instead of mozarella for a bit of a Greek twist.

Love this recipe!  I took the advice of one reviewer and made this sauce the night before we were to go scalloping.  Our attempts at harvesting scallops last labor day weekend failed due to the storms, so I added shrimp. All of our guests and family raved about this!  I am making it again tonight, and we are going to try again tomorrow to get fresh bay scallops here in the panhandle of FL.

Difficult to say. It was fun to make, but the taste didn't do it for me, so I wouldn't make this again. I've decided bay scallops don't do it for me. They are too small. Pan seared, full-sized scallops just taste better. Zucchini is difficult to master as well.

This was great but I made a couple changes.  I had some fresh prawns so used them instead of scallops and I didn't have enough fettuccine, so used regular spaghetti instead.   It was a big hit.

Excellent and very easy.  I love recipes that allow me to raid the garden and cook up the bounty immediately.  The only thing I changed was adding a few ounces of white wine to pump up the flavor.  YUM!!

Wow, this was a lovely dish! The flavors were excellent and the meal was quite filling. In fact, my husband and I stretched it closer to 6 or 7 servings with out serving any other food. My only complaint is that in the recipe itself, I would have liked to have seen measured amounts for the vegetables. For example: 2 Zucchinis/3 cups. Through out the cooking process I was afraid that my zucchini was too large and that I'd have a bad proportion of zucchini to the rest of the flavors...

Very good. Used angel hair pasta, asparagus(did not have zucchinis)will make sure I have them next time, and a can of diced tomatoes in place of the plum tomatoes. Easy to make and flavorful.

Yummy!  Flavorful and delicious.  We added the shrimp, and it worked well.  Didn't use quite as much olive oil (maybe 2 tablespoons.)  Also added about 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro after cooking at serving time.  This is a keeper.

I used 1 lb. of bay scallops and added about 1/2 lb. of med. shrimp.  I also used whole wheat thin spaghetti. I tried the other suggestions with 1/2 cup of white wine, and I used 2 T. of butter with 2 T. EVOO.  1/4 cup of EVOO is not necessary.  I also cut the red pepper flakes to a heaping 1/4 t. b/c I knew 1/2 t. was too much for my guest. I didn't have fresh basil so I used 1 T. of dried that I crushed in my palms. We thought it was delicious with these changes which were minor.

This is a great, simple recipe. I did, however, make some substitutions and exchanges: 

I changed the Bay scallops to Sea Scallops- and I still thought they were cooked a little long. When I do this again, I will cut it back a minimum of a full minute. 

I also added green onions and mushrooms to the mix. They turned out GREAT! 

I also decided to use dried basil instead of fresh. It allowed the flavors to really infuse. I will only use the fresh basil for garnish. 

As for the tomatoes, I did not add them with the Scallops. I let the scallops cook and added them to the hot pan, but removed them from the heat. They were sweet, but not mushy. 

My last comment: This dish is better the next day.

My husband really enjoyed this fresh dish!  I used shrimp in place of the scallops.  Added summer squash with the zucchini and fresh roma tomatoes.  It was wonderful like you would have a fine italian rest.  Will make again and try different veggies like mushrooms, broccoli and others.

This recipe was AWESOME! (with the suggestions from other reviewers.)  I first made the recipe as written but wanted a little more flavor and the sauce was a bit on the runny side for our taste.  I then added more garlic and 1/4 cup white wine, simmered an additional 5-10 minutes, which made the flavor and sauce perfect!  I also added snow peas,and next time will probably add mushrooms as well. Oh and whole wheat angel hair was perfect with this dish.  VERY HEALTHLY dish that tastes great!

This was an awesome recipe. I'm not a big fan of scallops, so I used jumbo shrimp instead of the scallops. It was great!! If you use the shrimps, use the ones that are pre-cooked and throw them in to simmer for the last 5 minutes. I cut up all the ingredients about 3 hours before I actually started cooking it and it only took me about 20 minutes from start to finish. My whole family loved this dish, even our 4 year old son (who isn't real easy to please).

This is really delicious, but needs more tomatoes.  I used eight Romas fresh out of my garden. I like a little more sauce with my pasta so the next time I make it I will cook less pasta or double all the ingredients.

Great recipe! Sauce was a bit runny but was very yummy. Glad I added some white wine as per one of the reviewers. Fresh scallops are a necessity, don't get the frozen kind! Overall, yummy recipe for both seafood lovers and non-seafood lovers as well.

This tasted fine.  I would suggest using only half a pound of pasta.  I also used some leftover tomato sauce.  Next time, I will used more scallops and zucchini.

Wow!!! I am watching my fat so I followed the directions of a previous reviewer and used only 2 tablespoons of oil.  Also, because other reviewers had mentioned that the sauce was "dry", I used canned, diced tomatoes and poured about 3/4 cup of the juice in the pan also.  The consistency was perfect.  In fact, my picky 9 year old daughter complemented the meal at mealtime and then again before she went to bed.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first time making anything with scallops.  My husband loved it, he ended up eating everything!!  The only thing I changed was that I added a few more tomatoes that the recipe had.

I just loved this recipe! I added a small shallot and instead of using 2 squash, I used one squash and one zucchini.  The color was great and the taste and sauce it makes when you add the scallops is so yummy.  The key I think is the fresh basil.  So healthy!  My whole family loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe. Family loved the freshness of the dish. I do agree with some reviews to add white wine and use a thin pasta like angel hair.

This is a recipe that has become a regular at our household, however as others have noted, we had to slightly change it. With the changes it is amazing! We love spicy food, so we actually just tripled the red pepper flakes (to 1 and a half teaspoons, instead), and it has a kick but is not too much. I think even for people who don't like a ton of spice it should still be doubled, as the first time we made it is was really bland. As a reference, I order the 1-2 star spice levels at Thai places, so that should tell you something...
The other tip I'd give is that we use vine ripe tomatoes instead of plum. The flavor of the tomato makes the meal, so we make sure to get really nice plump tomatoes. I still do 4, even though they are bigger than plum, but we love tomatoes. 
Last- don't make the mistake of thinking you can substitute dried basil for fresh (we did this once when the basil was forgotten at the store, and it completely changed the flavor).
Enjoy!

Quick, easy and delicious.  I only cooked the zucchini about 2-3 minutes - cooked, but not mushy.

Used fresh, large hand peeled shrimp instead of scallops and a couple  more cloves of garlic.   No red pepper flakes due to my Mom's tummy, just a bit of fresh, ground pepper. Fresh fettucini, loverly!!!  Sprinkled a bit of mozza cheese on the top as didn't have parmesan.  Froze one portion for a few days to take for lunch one day, no prob!!!  : )

the reason I only give this 3 stars was that the scallops were kind of bland..the veggies and the sauce was excellent, very fresh, but I think maybe if you saute the scallops first it would be more flavorful.

This was easy and very tasty.  I did add a couple of things.  I added more garlic, mushrooms and some broccoli slaw.  I did this to cut down on amount of pasta and no bread. Hubby loved it.  Will definitely be making this more.

I made this last night for my husband and I.  It was delicious!  My only changes were that I used a few more tomatoes (because I have an abundance in my garden) and since they were pretty watery, I added a Tbs tomato paste to thicken the sauce.  The Scallops were great though, and the zucchini was a nice addition to fresh tomato sauce.  Thanks for sharing!  I would double this recipe and make it for a dinner party in the future.

This was so good. I added a can of roma tomatoes,  extra garlic and one red onion. Threw in a tbs of butter with the oil. I was unsure about all of that basil, but used fresh and it was yummy. Can't wait for the left overs today.

Very easy and extremely tasty.  If you enjoy more sauce on your pasta, I would reduce the amount of pasta slightly--its a bit too much pasta for the amount of sauce for my taste.

This is an excellent dish.  My husband and I just had it for dinner.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated using fresh basil.  I won't change anything the next time I make it.  It's a recipe that will go in our "normal" rotation.  It is a close approximation of a sauce from a local restaurant that we enjoy....We also thought that it would be good without any kind of meat or try it with shrimp next time....

This is one of our favorites.  My husband says it's better than any pasta he's eaten in a restaurant.  I took another reviews advice and add wine.  Tonight I am using broccoli because I don't have zucchini and expect it to be good, too.

Very good recipe.  I only used 2 tbs olive oil.  Things did start sticking as I added mushrooms to the recipe as well but that was no longer a problem after I added the tomatoes.  After adding the scallops I added a 1/4 white wine.  Would really recommend adding the wine.

This is a good recipe but I made a couple of changes. I seared the scallops and topped the pasta with them instead of cooking them in the sauce. I also added some red bell pepper with the zucchini. I'd only use fresh basil with this recipe.

My husband turns his nose up at any "odd" ingredient in pasta, but he loved this dish made with shrimp instead of scallops. Used fire roasted tomatoes and feta in addition to the parmesan(mixing recipes found on this site - makes it hard to decide which to review, but the results were wonderful.)

Was definitely missing some flavor for me.  Went back for the leftovers and added some pomodoro and tomato paste to basically turn it into a red sauce.  much more to my liking!

I made this for dinner tonight with a few modifications...  First, when I added the tomatoes and basil, I threw in about 1/2 cup of the white wine I was going to have with dinner.  Also, I had huge, beautiful sea scallops that I pan fried separately (dust of flour, pan fry in medium-hot oil, baste with oil and melted butter) and then added individually on top of each plate.  Top with a little grated romano, and voila!  A wonderful dish that used local, summer-ripened vegetables.  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  My husband loved it!  My store didn't have plum tomatoes in stock so I used a can of diced tomatoes instead.  I also added a little butter and fresh lemon juice to the sauce.  It turned out great!

This can sometimes turn out a little bland and dry as other reviewers have mentioned.  It is still really good though.  Adding an extra tomato or two increases the flavor and moisture.

I enjoyed this dish, I made it with a lot more scallops than the recipe asked for. Next time I would add some shrimps and some other herbs. I used angel hair pasta too.

It was good.  You could sliver the zucchinis instead of dicing them.

It was good, but in my opinion needed a little more pizzazz.  I would make this recipe again and maybe add some cayenne pepper, or something else to spice it up.

YUMMY!  This was so good!  Be sure to use fresh basil (and plenty of it - I only used about 1/2 cup).  I made the full recipe and my husband and I have been eating the leftovers (sometimes straight out of the fridge!) for two days.  Next time I may double the sauce - hubby says he wants more "stuff" in it, but I think it's great the way it is.  Thank you for this great way to serve scallops!

Fantastic recipe.  I used shrimp instead of scallops.  Sauteed onions with the garlic.  I did use dried basil and with the fresh tomatoes, I added tomatoe puree because the sauce was a little too "light".  This recipe will become a family favorite.

YUM!  This recipe was so easy and so delicious!  I used a little more salt and sea scallops instead of bay.  I also substituted canned peeled tomatoes which I diced instead of fresh tomatoes - a helpful thing when tomatoes are out of season.

We like this recipe for a light, quick-to-fix meal.  Often add shrimp to the scallops for the extra protein.  Young, small zucchinis are best.  We used a bigger one once and the skin was a little too tough. I usually add a little extra pepper flakes.

Surprisingly good. Everyone had two servings. I used frozen peas instead of zuccini and canned tomatoes because that's all I had. Made too much so will have leftovers for lunch next week.

The amount of crushed red pepper was good for me, however, half would have been preferred by the rest of the family.  I did add some white wine to the scallops.

This was a great summer meal.  We would give it 5 stars with the following...I julienned my zucchini with my mandoline to make it more like noodles and used the amount called for. I added another clove of chopped garlic when I added the seafood.  My store ran out of scallops after I got a 1/3 lb, so I had to sub in shrimp for the rest. Chopped fresh basil is a must.  I also added 1/4c (not sweet) white wine.  I think a solid 4 as written but 5 with the changes. Enjoy.

Loved it, super simple and easy. Used shrimp instead of scallops and added twice the amount of garlic, and even then I could have added more. I used 3/4 tsp of dried basil, and it worked out great. Definitely will make it again.

I made this last night and it was wonderful. I didn't remember where I put the recipe so I did it from memory.  I see now, we forgot the olive oil and parm cheese, (oops). I added shrimp, served with garlic toast and used regular spaghetti noodles instead.  Even my mom, who usually does not like my recipes said she enjoyed it.  My mom was a little heavy handed with the pepper flakes but it's still a keeper! Thank you for sharing Lisa! LOVE IT!

We found the red pepper to predominate the flavor of this and otherwise found it to be bland. I followed the recipe fairly closely except I did add the wine some other reviewers suggested. Doubt I'll make this again.

I really liked this dish.  The only thing I substituted was yellow squash for the zucchini and it turned out great, adding a yellow color to the red and green of the tomatoes and basil.  Use fresh basil if at all possible as I think it makes a big difference!

We loved this!  I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I used vermicelli instead of fettucine, 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, 3 Tbsp of dried basil instead of fresh.  I used 1 red bell pepper instead of the red pepper flakes because my kids don't like spicy foods.  I increased the zucchini to 3 and the scallops to 1.5 pounds.  This was a fantastic meal and looks beautiful to serve for company or a special occasion!

Healthy and tasty. I had to make a few changes due to what was on hand: salmon instead of scallops, and whole wheat spaghettini instead of fettucini. I did cut down on the serving for pasta, put enjoyed this meal with a tossed salad, and glass of red wine. Recommend!

Made this tonight (with fresh angel hair pasta) in about half quantity, and added a splash of cooking sherry to the scallops. The red pepper flakes amount was too strong for us, but easily remedied next time. My husband suggests adding mushrooms to achieve nirvana. Fast! Easy! Delish! a keeper.

Oh my this is so good! I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried, and I still loved it! I really want to try this with fresh basil, I bet it would be much better! I will try with chicken now that scallops are off season!

This was very good. I added mushrooms and green onions, and also seared the scallops separately since I prefer them cooked that way to bring out their natural sweetness. Very tasty!

Mom mom, husband, and I enjoyed this (the two of them are scallop lovers)! We did make some changes.  I added 1/4 cup sun-dried tomato pesto to the noodles after cooking them as a different recipe suggested (couldn't really taste it, wouldn't do that again to save on calories) and we only had one zucchini. I also added 8 oz. fresh mushrooms, which made up for the second zuke and added lovely flavor and texture. My mom couldn't stop raving about this meal!  Thank you!!

There is too much 'going on' in this recipe.  Scallops are too delicate to be drowned with all these ingredients.  Less is more with shellfish, for me.  If I used pesto, I would use a small amount added to a bit of cream or half-and-half.  Shellfish and fish, in Italian cuisine are tradionally served without cheese but I like a bit of Romano on top.  I love home-made pesto and vegetables with pasta.  I wouldn't make the recipe again but do love scallops with pasta.

Good, but didn't blow me away.  The zucchini cook time was way too long and they were soggy.  I added the 1/2 cup of white wine, which made this a solid recipe.

This was a quick, easy and visually appealing dish I will definitely make again.  I used the zucchini, Roma tomatoes and basil from my garden.  After reading the reviews, I added garlic, onion and white wine, because I can't imagine pasta without it.  I also think this would be equally as good with shrimp or chicken breast, depending on what you have on hand.

This was excellent.  I had to make some changes to go with items I had.  I added diced red pepper,and a small bottle of marinated artichoke hearts, and I cut up tomatoes (regular fresh tomato) and left off the zucchini as I didn't have any.  Followed the rest of recipe and it was so good I couldn't believe it.  I will be making this many more times as it was easy and quick to make expecially if you have unexpected company.  Made a salad to accompany the meal.

This tasted like 10 stars when I was done with it, but in all fairness I'll give it a 4 since I made so many changes. I didn't have garlic in the house (I freak out when that happens) so I sauteed half an onion with a bit of garlic salt instead. I used shrimp instead of scallops. I used fresh parsley as well as basil. I added a splash of white wine and a spoon of pesto. It was incredible. My husband loved it and he doesn't even like tomatoes, onions, or zucchini very much. So I did make a lot of changes, but this recipe has GREAT bones, and I would highly recommend that you try it and feel free to improvise.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I have made it several time for family and friend, and all have LOVED it... It's healthy and delicious at the same time! I use the frozen, smaller version of scallops (sea scallops I think) and they work just as well. Lovely!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I have to hands down give my Venetian's friend's scallops a five compared to this one.  I agree with reviewers that it needed more flavor.  I added some fresh onion to the mix with the garlic and some white wine as suggested.

Great recipe!  I made a few changes by substituting sea scallops (which I cut up) as well as adding fresh broccoli.  We also use a different pasta such as rotelle.  All in all, you can definitely experiment as it's tough to mess this up.  Enjoy!

I loved this recipe. I used shrimp and spaghetti instead of scallops and linguine. I also used fresh chopped tomatoes from my garden. Added a little tomato sauce, about 1/4 cup to sauce. Turned out great. Family loved it!

Excellent recipe and easy to make!  I loved the crushed red pepper flakes.  I also added some white wine and sliced mushrooms and used whole wheat fettuccine for healthier carbs.  This is a winner!

My family LOVED this dish.  My hubby made the comment: "Wow, this is something you'd find in a nice restaurant".   The only changes I made were that I used linguini and I add 1/3 cup of a dry wine.  Awesome.  Will definitely make again and again.

This was fantastic!  I didn't use nearly as much oil called for and used a can of diced tomatoes with the juice.  If things started to look a bit dry I'd give a splash of oil and, later, a few tablespoons of the pasta water.

Thanks, this really was a terrific meal and so quick and easy to make.  My husband couldn't stop raving about it and told me it MUST be put into the dinner "rotation"!

Wasn't thrilled with this recipe. Very bland. Maybe bland isn't the word - flavors just didn't meld. Red pepper flavor very prominent. It tasted just like "zucchini", "tomatoes", "Scallops" in one dish - not a blending of flavors. Won't try again - sorry.

This dish was ok. My husband says he liked it, but it needed more meat. I thought like someone else said that it need an extra kick. It's very bland. I guess it's just not my taste, but now I know my family likes zucchini. It was a nice experiment at the least. Thanks anyway.

Very good!  I live in the Garden State, so I used fresh Jersey tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes.  The sauce was light, but delicious. I would make this again.  It's a great summertime meal.

This is a one of a kind of recipe.The first time I cooked it exactly as written.It was wonderfull.The second time I used a fresh marinara sauce insted of tomatoes.It was even better.But this recipe because it is so simple  gives a lot of room to experiment.The kids liked it to and they would rather have pizza.Thanks Lisa.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I used frozen scallops and they were delicious.  The fresh basil makes it taste like something from a restaurant.  I will difintely make this again.  Tasty, easy, and healthy!

This recipe is great.  Made it for dinner last night and my husband really enjoyed it.  He is pretty much a purist when it comes to scallops so trying this recipe was stepping out of the norm for what he prefers.  However, he had no problem going for seconds and cleaning his plate.  He enjoyed the leftovers (and there wasn't much) over a mushroom omelet for breakfast this morning.  Will definitely make this again and plan to try it as a sauce over an omelet for a company brunch.

What a great recipe.  I was nervous cooking this for my inlaws.  Everyone loved it.  A little spicy for little ones though.  This would also be good with shrimp if you don't have scallops.  The recipe needs more salt and zucchini.  Other wise awsome.  It's a keeper!

It was ok. The zucchini made the sauce too watery and bland.  I might try this again with a different vegetable or just tomatoes, onions and garlic.  I might add sautéed mushrooms. I did add enough Locatelli cheese when serving.  That really helped.

I increased the zucchini, tomatoes, and oil since I eliminated the scallops. Definitely a keeper, but next time I will leave all the other ingredients the same and just decrease the pasta as this made a lot.

Notes on what I did with what I had: Sauteed garlic in oil, added zucchini and chopped tomatoes with red pepper flakes. After a couple minutes I added pasta water, and some white wine. Then I added some salad shrimp ( I would use med. shrimp if I had it). Once that cooked for a bit I added fresh chopped basil, then I added the pasta I had cooked to the skillet. Heated this through and topped with grated cheese. The result was awesome!

This was a light and fantastic meal to make on a cool night. I only made some small adjustments last night. I've cut half a zucchini, used one roma tomato and used minced garlic. Since I didn't have fettuccine, I've used linguine. I would make it again.

Loved it with some additions!!! The best part of summer is using fresh veggies in your dishes! I used all fresh ingredients, including sea scallops straight from the canal, so very yummy. I added 1 sweet onion (can't go without it in a pasta dish), and lots of Italian seasoning (oregano, thyme, parsley). We like things salty, so I added about a Tablespoon of garlic salt, and about 2oz. of dry white wine. It was just fabulous, my fiance loved it! Light, healthy and so tasty. Will definitely make it again!

This recipe was wonderful!  I used twice the amount of garlic and canned diced tomatoes.   I also had a yellow squash, so I added that along with the two zucchini.  My wife is gluten free, so I used gluten free pasta.  While it was a great meal, I think it would have been even better with asian rice noodles.   I will definitely use this recipe again and am eager to try it with other protein sources like chicken, sausage, shrimp, or calamari.

Added some rough chopped mushrooms with the zucchini. Spoon off the excess liquid. Turn up the heat and add the  scallops to the center of the pan; think stir fry technique here. I used the larger Sea Scallops cut into quarters. Do not over cook the scallops or they will get tough. Lastly add the diced tomatoes and greens to wilt and serve over Jambalaya flavored Ready Rice. Sprinkle of Old Bay spice and squeeze of lemon optional. This is also great over riced cauliflower for lower cabs.

I used angel hair pasta when I made it... It was DELICIOUS!!!  Served 5 people perfectly.  It was a bit spicy, but that could be adjusted by reducing the amount of red pepper added.

Would make it again.... and again!

What a great summer dish! I made it following the recipe, but you could add any veggies in it, and it would still be wonderful.

I made this once with prawns and once with small scallops and leftover grilled salmon.   I used fresh linguini and added sliced red and yellow peppers for some extremes vegetable!  We loved it and will make it again.

Sry quick and easy recipe. Made it for my husband. Saw a few reviews that said it needed more flavor, so I added about 3 tsp of capers and a coup,e of diced spring onions, and a few extra dashed of cayenne because my husband likes the heat. He enjoyed it. I don't really like scallops, so I tasted the fettuccine only and it was good. Will make again.

My family loves this recipe.  I also add white wine into the sauce.  I also use two cans of diced tomatoes, cut up asparagus, zucchini and squash.  I’ve used both large and small scallops and love this with angel hair pasta.  You can’t mess this recipe up - easy to prepare and delish!!

I made this according to recipe,  but was having dinner with friends who are vegetarian so left out the scallops.  I think when I make it next I will use scallops and/or shrimp and it would be even better.

This is a great meal -- easy and quick to make but looks and tastes like a sophisticated, gourmet dish. I added an extra clove of garlic. I also sprinkled a generous amount of salt and black pepper on the scallops before putting them in the pan, and they turned out delicious. My husband doesn't like zucchini, so instead of the zucchini, I "cubed" an English cucumber, which was a wonderful addition/substitution! The basil made my house smell amazing! Highly recommend.

I had to change a couple ingred's, instead of scallops I used shrimp cut into chunks, and I used fresh spinach with dried  basil for the fresh basil.  It just lacked that ? in flavor I was hoping for. My husband said that I can have his "re-runs."

Delicious!  I broiled the scallops separately for 7 minutes with a tsp. garlic salt, lemon and olive oil.  Really flavorful.    Parmesan cheese was not needed.

I had to make some changes due to diet (less carbs the better) and what I had on hand (no fresh herbs). 

I thought I had used too much garlic, but once everything was added together, it worked out. 

Making again for sure!

Delicious and very easy to make! I ended up using sea scallops rather than bay since I prefer them however pretty much stuck to the recipe outside of that.

It was ok flavor-wise, but I took some reviewer advice and added 1/2 cup white cooking wine and then it was a bit too watery.Perhaps  next time just 1/4 cup of cooking wine, and maybe even some starch to bulk up up the sauce.

Loved this! Yes, I did change it after reading some reviews, but my new version was terrific. I used 1/2 lb dry fettuccine pasta, 1/4 c. olive oil, 5 cloves minced garlic, 3 zucchinis, diced, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, 1 cup chopped fresh basil, 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved, 1/2 lb. bay scallops, 1 lb shrimp, 1/2 cup white wine. I'll make this again soon. Thank you for the starter idea.

I think less pasta, more seasoning. I doubled the basil.  The sauce tasted great but after tossing the pasta into it there wasn't a wow factor. (I cook my pasta in salty water-like the ocean and added red pepper to the water too.) The dish itself was blah. I thought it was ok, but my husband didn't say anything about the new recipe,didn't get seconds and replied meh when asked if I should make it again.

This was a good base recipe. I was a bit overwhelmed at the many changes several reviewers made to it. So what I did was to add some veggies like red pepper, yellow squash. I substituted chicken for scallops. I added pine nuts, chopped onion to the garlic - olive oil. I also used ground Italian seasoning, shredded Romano and parmesan cheeses, and garnished with chopped parsley for added flavor and texture.

I followed the recipe but used dried basil, as it is what I had on hand. I also chose to serve the sauce over zoodles (zucchini noodles) as a lower carb option. It was absolutely amazing!!

This recipe was pretty good but needed much more salt and Parmesan cheese to make it great.  I added 2 tbsp butter, 1 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp salt and 1 tsp garlic powder.  I still had to add more salt and extra Parmesan cheese to my plate afterwards and then I ate 2 platefuls!

This recipe did need a little tweaking, so I can't give it 5 stars.  But it was good.  I added a little white wine and also  sautéd the scallops in butter and garlic before adding to everything.  Don't be stingy with the salt or red pepper flakes.  A little asiago cheese grated helped the flavor too.

This recipe is super easy to make and tastes great. I would have reduced the amount of olive oil to less than half of the 1/4 cu prescribed though.

So yummy. I cooked it with butter I stead of oil and it was amazing, even with dried basil vs. fresh basil.  Hubby and the kids (age 2 & 4 )loved it. Will definitely make it again.

I took the advice of others and added to the flavor of this dish. I also wanted to keep the calories low on this dish so I used fresh herbs ( thyme, rosemary, sage and a fresh onion.) This dish now  is full of flavor without adding calories and fat.

I think this was fantastic. I used fresh pasta, ground red pepper instead of crushed and added 4 tbsp butter and 1/2 cup white wine. Fantastic.

I am not a cook at all, but I was able to do this recipe. My family enjoyed it very much. The key was the scallops. When I bought them, I also bought some jumbo shrimps which was a good complimentary to the meal. The best was my son telling me that his one criticism was that there was not enough for seconds.

It was good.  I added broccoli just because I had some in the fridge that I wanted to use.  I bet bay seasoning would have made it just a tad better.

This is such a nice light dish, great for summer.  As in other reviews, I added 1T butter and cut back the olive oil.  added 1/4 c white wine and a little lemon juice.  I mixed fresh and dried basil and peeled my tomatoes.  The second time I made it I added cauliflower florets with only one zucchini.  Terrific!

Wow!  I made this recipe pretty much as written and it is fantastic!  I made the sauce ahead of time because that's when I had time, but I didn't put the scallops in at that point...I was afraid to cook them and then reheat that they would get overdone.  So heated up the sauce & added the bay scallops to cook.  This was already awesome just when I was cooking the zucchini!  You could just make zucchini this way and it's delicious!  Did use just a 1/2 lb of pasta, I used linguine because that's what I had, but you could use any pasta you prefer.  Oh and I used a bit more red pepper, we like it spicy.  A wonderful, fresh tasting meal that I will make again for sure.

Simple, quick, healthy and delicious, this recipe has it all.  After reading the reviews, I used thin spaghetti which worked out very well.  We felt it needed extra seasoning, but  it was still wonderful.

My family absolutely loved this one. After setting the pasta aside for a bit, I had to rinse it in cool water to pull them apart, but it came out great. Tasted restaurant quality. We really enjoyed it. Thanks so much for the recipe.

My notes:
used 3 small/med zucchini.  added homemade chicken broth - maybe almost a can worth, added 1/2 onion when sauteed garlic.  added 1/4-1/2 butter, fresh basil, and put tomatoes in only a few minutes before done.  added a bit more salt, black pepper, a bit of old bay and a little dried basil as well.

Yum!  Really enjoyed this.  Used home grown squash, tomatoes, and basil, so good!  I added some pepper and served with lemon. I thought the flavor was good, I didn't find it bland, but I may have been a little heavy handed with the red pepper!  Hubby and I like things a bit spicy.  :) Thanks for sharing, will make this again!

It's hard to give a recipe 5 stars when you alter it.  I had fresh tomato, basil and zucchini on hand.  I also had scallops in the freezer so in my ingredient search found this.  Was going to follow recipe but then decided to make a chopped garlic, tomato, zucchini, scallop filling and made ravioli and topped with pesto sauce made from my basil, olive oil and parm.  I basically followed the ingredient list, just used them in a different way.  I'm sure that this recipe made as directed would be very good.

We thought this was fab. I also resorted to a can of petite diced tomatoes with olive oil and garlic cuz the tomatoes I had disappeared! I found I had to make a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce to the consistency we like. Healthy, light, very tasty, sure to be added to our rotation. I wish I could upload the gorgeous pic I took on my Bberry...oh well.

Amazing!!! Very easy to make.  I just added 1 shallot with the garlic and instead of diced tomatoes I bought a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes drained it and added some white wine.  It was excellent!!!! Made this recipe twice already and great responses.

Pretty good says BSr. I used linguini pasts, sugar snap peas instead of zuc (but would like to try it with zuc, cause might be saucier), just a sprinkling of red pepper flakes, a comb of dried and fresh basil, cause did not have enough fresh, lots of tomatoes. I drizzled a bit extra olive oil over top, near the end. Was good.

I liked it, but I deviated significantly from the original recipe.  I opted to stray even before making it once as listed because the ratio of pasta-meat-veggies seemed way off.  I increased the veggies by at least 2x (used 28oz can diced tomatoes, zucchini, and added a pint of mushrooms).  Used 1lb scallop and .5lb shrimp with just a half pound of pasta, and the ratio still seemed off.  The flavor was good though - just adjust ingredients for a better balance, depending on your preference.

Good recipe, but the crushed red pepper brought a little more heat than I prefer with scallops.  I halved the recipe for all ingredients except the scallops and roma tomatoes (I used right at a pound of scallops and 3 roma tomatoes).  I also added about 1/4 white wine to the zucchini as they were sautéing.  This fed 2 ravenous adults with a bit leftover.

This recipe was amazing. My children even loved it. However, the only thing I may change in the future is the amount of red pepper flakes. My husband, my son and myself thought the amount was fine, but my daughter thought it was too spicy. So I may add a lil less next time. Otherwise, I am absolutely in love with this recipe.

I've made this recipe many times for family and company because it's simple, fresh, and flavorful.  I typically use sea scallops because they are more flavorful and less likely to become tough.  Sea scallops need to cook longer (before adding the vegetables) than the smaller bay scallops. I suggest keeping a close eye on the vegetables as they cook to make sure they don't get overdone.  The tomatoes should only cook for a minute or two at the most. Fresh basil and Parmesan are key.

This was a hit with my seafood eaters! I was surprised at the colorful presentation, fragrant aroma, but slightly disappointed with the flavor. Feedback from the family included the scallops were too bland unless you ate it with everything else. I added smoked paprika (one of my favorite spices).

I added more garlic and more pepper flakes than the recipe called for and I still thought it was too bland.

Wonderful recipe! We didn't have a few items so we modified the recipe slightly: 
1) No Roma Tomatos so we used a can of diced tomatos. 
2) No Scallops so we pan fried in olive oil some tilapia filets
3) No fettuccine pasta so we used penne pasta

Overall very pleased, the zuccini, garlic, tomato, red pepper, and basil taste was WONDERFUL! Definitely a new favorite.

Wow this recipe I will make over and over, it was fantastic. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and it turned out great.

I love scallops and this receipte was very good.  I loved it.  Very light and tasty.  I didn't even make the pasta.  I ate it as is and it was delicious.  Would definitely make it again and would try different seasfood to simulate the same flavor.  Excellent taste.

Superb recipe.  I added spring onions but didn't have any white wine (I'm trying that tonight).  But I did pan fry the scallops.  This is the real way to cook scallops and it made them taste amazing.

This was really yummy and healthy! I used whole wheat fettucini. I even made an extra dish without red pepper, garlic, and basil for my 13 month old. He loved it, scallops and all! I think next time I'll add more tomatoes.

This is such a yummy dish!  The first time I made it, everyone loved it. The only thing I added were shrimps since it usually goes well with scallops.  Will be making it again tonight.  Thanks!

I thought this was wonderful.  Light and full of flavor.  The only thing I did differant, I used sea scallops, cut into quarters.  Much better then the bay scallops the recipe calls for.  
This is good enough to make for company! Good job.

Thought this was terrific! Light, like others said; did not add the full amount of garlic, but did put in about 1/3 onion. Used red pepper instead of flakes.

This is a light and delicious meal.  Easy to make, too.  I used sea scallops and cut them into thirds.  Also, I used fresh basil and a can of chopped tomatoes with the juice instead of fresh. The pepper flakes add a bit of heat.  Overall, a geat recipe for any season of the year.  Will definitely make this again.
