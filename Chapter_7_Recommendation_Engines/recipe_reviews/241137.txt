Skillet Smoked Sausage & Red Potatoes with Veggies Haiku: "Ack! This is oily! But oh-so-easy to make. Fine, fine it was great." So other than there being way too much oil (2 TB unnecessary, especially when the smoked sausage is greasy too), this turned out to be very tasty. I let my sausage slices brown and crisp a bit longer b4 adding the zucchini, squash, and jalapeno. Because there was so much grease from the oil and the sausage though, the veggies got a little too smooshy, and the leftovers had that slimy orange film on them (which didn't seem to faze my husband.) For ease of preparation (not to mention fast as I'd pre-cut all the veggies and sausage 1st thing in the morning so it was cooked in no time at all) and for the taste being good, I'd gladly make this again.

I skip the jalapeño because I don’t like things too spicy, but I love this recipe. It also freezes well and is good saved over brown rice.

I've made a variation of this before using carrots instead of zucchini. I like the flavor of zucchini more but you miss out on the ability to brown the potatoes and sausage, which isn't necessary for the recipe, but I find it adds to the texture.  All in all, still good and really easy to make.
