Great tasting, easy, quick punch for any occasion. I always double the champagne. In addition, I freeze orange juice in a round Tupperware jello mold and have that float in the punch bowl for it's chill-effect, looks and added orange flavor. (I have also added maraschino cherries and whole mint leaves to the OJ, prior to freezing ... it looks pretty neat if you make them look like flowers by setting the mint leaves & cherries in the bottom of the jello mold; SLOWLY add a small amount of OJ to cover. Freeze that, then fill the rest of the jello mold and freeze solid.)

I pureed the strawberries instead of leaving them whole and dipped the edge of the glasses in decorative sugar.  Good easy punch and my guests really liked it.

I made this punch for New Year's Eve and it was delicious...however, I too made it more interesting and fun by using 2 champagne and only 1 ginger ale.  I also made a ice ring with strawberries and ginger ale that kept it cold until it was gone!!  Big hit with everyone.  A definite for next year and maybe during the year, if the occasion arises.

This was such a nice change of pace for my New Year's party! Although I scaled back the ginger ale to 1 liter per bottle of champagne - I did want people to have a good time, after all! Two liters would be terrible - but 1 liter was perfect. I bet this would also work nicely with frozen raspberries or even blueberries. Thanks a lot Phyllis! I'll make this on future special occasions.

I served this with sliced strawberries instead of whole.  Next time I would stick with whole ones because it made it look merky and you couldn't tell it was strawberries.  Everyone liked it though... I may try next time cutting down on the ginger ale a bit too.

I am getting married next month and plan on serving this to my guests.  We did a trial run this weekend and WOW is this stuff tasty!  We used Pink Champagne and used one bottle of that to one 2-liter bottle of ginger ale and only used 1-10 ounce pkg of strawberries.  This recipe is definetly a keeper!

This was very good. I used 2 liters of ginger ale for 1 bottle of champagne, but it could have used more champagne. I also liked it even better the second day when the strawberry flavor was infused in the drink. Next time, I'll prepare a day in advance and not worry about the strawberries being thawed out. I think it works well that way. Pureed strawberries, as one user suggests, would probably be the best. I will definitely make this again. Thanks and cheers!

This was OUTSTANDING!  I wouldn't change a thing.  This will be a staple at every adult party we have from now on!!  There was not one person at my New Year's Eve party that did not have at least 3 glasses of this.  Everyone LOVED it!  Happy New Year 2011

Easiest crowd pleaser ever!  I do agree to increase the champagne amount, though.  Also, if you thaw some of the strawberries a bit and mush them up with a fork, it increases the sweetness.  Overall, great and inexpensive!

I blended the strawberries first.  I decided since I had a few friends over that I would just make the drinks in the glasses.  I added about 1/4 champagne flute strawberry puree, filled to about 3/4 full with champagne, then topped off with the ginger ale.  Everyone raved about how good this was!  We were able to get about 9-10 servings with 1 750mL bottle of champagne and used only about 1/3 of the 1L ginger ale bottle.  Yummy!

This was a fun New Year's Eve sipper! We used all the ginger ale to make it less potent. I would use a mix of fresh and frozen strawberries next time. The frozen ones are a little soggy.

it made enough for 15 people to drink...lightly.  I pureed the strawberries; next time I will strain out the seeds as well.  1 2l ginger ale.  I think I will use 2 DRY champagnes next time b/c it was a twee too sweet.

Refreshing and easy!  I used two bottles of Andre Strawberry Champagne to each two-liter bottle of ginger ale, and made ice rings out of the strawberries and strawberry Kool-Aid.  People couldn't get enough of it!

I made this just for fun when my family came to visit. Since I wasn't tryign to make an ornate presentation, I didn't bother with any sort of garnish. The punch tasted great, and I made the recipe as is. I suppose if the intention was to get tipsy, you would omit one liter of ginger ale. However, I don't like my family or myself to be tipsy when we get together, so this really worked!

Very nice- even with adding more champage didn't taste of alcohol, nor does it really give you a buzz- great for an afternoon event, or an evening with light drinkers.

This is an inexpensive, easy and great-tasting champagne punch that was a huge hit at a wedding reception I recently hosted.  Everyone was asking for the recipe, I will definitely make this again!  I used an inexpensive (but not super cheap) sweet pink Moscato champagne - 2 bottles to one 2 liter bottle of ginger ale, plus the slightly thawed frozen strawberries.  I also made a non-alcoholic version substituting pink sparkling grape juice for the champagne - this was really good as well and a nice alternative.

I should have followed the other suggestions and used 2 bottles of champagne to one bottle of ginger ale.  It was lacking in flavor at our gathering.  It was better later that evening, after the strawberries had a chance to add flavor.  I did use pink champagne to give it a little color.

This punch was okay- it didn't have a strong flavor. I used 2L of soda and a full bottle of champagn and used 10oz of frozen raspberries. It either needed more champagn to bring out the briskness in the flavor, or more soda to sweeten it up. The raspberries added a beautiful color, but didn't have a whole lot of flavor either. I would suggest using sweetened fruit, or adding something like fresh mint to liven it up a bit.

I was having a Ladies night in and had about 20 women coming over.. Wanted something easy on the pocket book also.  This is so good.. I actually  mixed all liquids and the strawberries the night before and added mint leaves.  Then about 3 hours before everyone showed up i took my frozen fruit ring out and let it sit and melt some.. This was great.. Great flavor! I had lots of request for the recipe.. Thanks so much !! I will keep this for ever. I loved this and i am not even a champagne person!! SO GOOD!!

Great hit for our New Year's feast. We mixed two different types of champagne since they were left over from the night before. The longer you let the flavors meld the better it tastes.

This recipe is so easy, quick, and delicous! I've had tons of request for this recipe when we served it at my baby shower. But it goes really fast so make sure to have extra!

I must say this is a very easy and elegant punch. The suggestions to use 1 liter to 1 750ml is helpful as is the use of whole fruit. I used a copper punch bowl when I made it for a baby shower and a crystal punch bowl when I made it for a wedding reception. Rave reviews at both!

Used 1.25 liters of ginger ale, 18 oz. of frozen strawberries and a bottle of champagne. Made it for a football party and everyone loved it as a refreshing alternative to beer.

Easy and yummy!  I used a clear pitcher instead of a punch bowl and served in wine glasses.  I also used only one package of strawberries and 1 liter of ginger ale.

This was DELICIOUS!  Perfect for any occasion especially Christmas!  I used a bottle of Asta Spumonta as well as a brut. The 2 worked very well together, giving this punch a little more sweetness which I prefer. Will remember this one in the future! Thank you Nicmoss; ;)) Happy NEW YEAR 2015!

Made this for New Year's Eve and my guests loved it. I used proseco and added about 1/4 cup of pomegranite juice, which gave it a beautiful color and a slight tartness. Will definitely make this again.
