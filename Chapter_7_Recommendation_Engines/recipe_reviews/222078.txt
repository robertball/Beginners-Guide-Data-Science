This is a fantastic recipe! I adjusted it a little bit by cutting out the oil and using applesauce instead... turned out great! It could even have some sugar eliminated and add more cinnamon.

I cut this recipe back to 12 servings. I did make two changes--I increased both the baking soda and baking powder to a full teaspoon each and instead of using half of one egg, I added a couple tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce. I made muffins out of this recipe. Baked at 350*, my muffins were done at just over 20 minutes. This is a nice basic zucchini bread that was moist and chewy. Out of 12 muffins that were made, there are four leftover.

If you are like me  and are trying to eliminate vegetable oils (that are the cause of so much inflamation in our arteries), try substituting 1/2 cup of plain yogurt for the vegetable oil.  I also like to add 1 teaspoon of lemon zest to the recipe.

This was a good recipe.  simple and easy to follow.  i did tweak this recipe to make it gluten and oil and dairy free.  replaced the all-purpose and whole wheat flour with oat flour (same measurements), and took out the 1/2 cup of oil and milk and added 1c of applesauce.  was really pleased with the results!

Great flavorful bread! My family of seven loved this recipe, and here are my changes: I used 1/2 cup melted butter instead of the oil and lowered the sugar to 1 cup.  I also added 1 cup of applesauce.  It turned out perfect.  The butter added the butter flavor and I felt I didn't need to cover the bread in butter before eating.  We actually ate it warm out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Delicious!

Good recipe, I tweaked it a bit. I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and added 1 ripe banana. I also reduced the sugar to 1 C. It turned out fantastic! I also added 1 C. of white chocolate chips!

Soft, fluffy and totally DELICIOUS!  Came out great!  My "healthy" version:  Used all whole wheat flour (3 cups), increased both the baking soda and powder to 1 teaspoon each, cinnamon to 4 1/2 tsp. plus added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, added 1 ripe banana and decreased sugar to 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white,  yogurt instead of oil, almond milk in place of regular milk, added one extra cup of zucchini + the walnuts.

Good Zucchini bread.  The only difference was I used all whole wheat, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg (LOVE nutmeg!) and used some brown sugar for depth of flavor.

These came out great! I substituted the milk and oil for 1 cup of applesauce, and I was out of vanilla extract so I used 3 tsp of maple syrup. I also made half the recipe in a bread pan and half in muffins.  The muffins cook at the same temperature for about half the time.  Delicious!

I LOVE  this as a guide but I wouldn't call it "healthy" with all of that sugar. I tripled the recipe, used 1/2 c sugar, 1/4 cup packed brown sugar TOTAL for the tripled recipe and 8 large zucchini grated. Also substituted the oil & milk with homemade applesauce (that I make without sugar). I did use the walnuts bc my family needs the extra protein in the am. Also used 5 eggs total. It worked out fabulous and I will freeze these muffins for quick back-to-school breakfasts.
My kids never complain about it not being sweet enough but you could add chopped dates to give it a sweet boost. I may try that next time.

Made this yesterday and was really disappointed with the result. My loaves baked fine, but after taking them out, they fell flat and were soggy in the middle. I changed the recipe by using only 1 C sugar, put in 2.5 C zucchini and only AP flour. What did I do wrong? I could tell the batter was too liquid when I was mixing, I wish I had added more flour. The milk made the mixture too watery for me. Though I'm not sure why my bread was flat and still too soggy? I will follow the original "non-healthy" recipe next time an see what happens. Otherwise, I will not make again.

I just made this recipe for the first time, and intended to make it exactly as written. I made a mistake, though and only added 1/2 cup sugar, instead of the 1 1/2 cups the recipe calls for. This was a happy accident, though, as the bread was plenty sweet enough for my family's taste.  Other than the sugar, I made it exactly as written, baked it for 42 minutes and it turned out delicious! Very moist! Definitely a keeper!

I loved this recipe.  I did cut the oil by 1/4 cup and substituted applesauce (1/4 cup).  I also added one ripe banana to sub for about 1/2 cup of sugar.  

Next time I think I'll use 1/2 cup of plain yogurt instead of applesauce! Thanks DLD review for the suggestion:) Happy and healthy snacking is possible.

Since we try to eat healthy I changed a few ingredients. I used 1/2 cup ground flax seed and only 1/4 cup of canola oil. 
I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Also added 1 teaspoon orange zest,1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 2 tablespoons homemade applebutter. Left out the nuts since the flax gives it a nutty flavor and I needed to cut a few calories. The final product was delicious.

Excellent recipe!  Used water instead of milk and added an extra cup of zucchini.  Super moist and delicious!  Also, I only had whole wheat flour and it still worked out fantastic.  :)  Thanks, Healthier Mom!

Best zucchini bread I've made! I did substitute applesauce in place of the oil & omitted the walnuts (kids don't like them). My picky 3 yr old had a piece and asked for more!

It was very good,  but I always leave out the baking powder from any recipe as research has shown that it attacks and disables the B vitamins  along the myelin sheath of the nerves. This leaves kids antsy and adults nervous and easily annoyed. Instead I just increased the baking soda by 1/2 tsp. Then I reduced the milk by 1/4 cup and soured the remaining with 1/4 cup of lemon juice. This increases the acidity, which reacts with the baking soda and creates lots of little bubbles in the batter. I reduced the oil to 3 Tbl. I pop it in the oven immediately after adding the soured milk as the bubbles burst quickly. I also substitute whole grain spelt flour and white spelt flour as I am somewhat gluten sensitive. I also used goat milk instead of cow. And instead of the sugar I used 1/2 C of maple syrup and 1/4 tsp sweet leaf liquid stevia.

I loved this recipe.  Changes I made:  I doubled the milk and pureed it with the zucchini in the blender; I used 6 egg whites instead of whole eggs; I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil; I used chocolate coffee creamer instead of milk; I used splenda instead of sugar; I used 4 tsp soda and no baking powder.

Definately a good recipie, i tweaked it a bit as well following some of the other reviewers. i replaced the white whole wheat flour with whole wheat flour, the sugar for 1 banana and 1/3 cup 1 1/2 tsp truvia, the oil for 1/2 cup plain yogurt. if i make them again the same way i would probably add a little bit more of the baking powder/soda (mabye 1/2 tsp of each) because they were a little dense. i think this was due to me changing the part of the flour to wheat. otherwise they tasted great. i was thinking about using oat flour instead of the other two kinds but i didnt want to change the recipe more without testing it, mabye ill try that next time.

I followed the recipe except I substituted the oil for applesauce as another commenter suggested. It turned out decent--a tiny bit mushy. I wish I had put more cinnamon in there for more of a kick. It was a little bland. Also, I live in CO so it took the whole 60 minutes to cook plus I increased the cooking temp by 15 degrees.

I tripled the recipe and made 4 loaves and 1 9x13 pan and each turned out great (I had a large zucchini and freeze the sliced cakes for lunches).  I skipped the nuts and added raisons and chocolate chips and subbed half the oil for applesauce.  Very moist and tasty.  I'll make it again.

I substituted regular whole wheat flour and used buttermilk because that is what I had - otherwise I made it as written. I usually don't care for whole wheat quick breads but this was very moist, tender and just sweet enough with half the fat of the standard recipe.

This is a great recipe to tweak. I substituted applesauce for the oil, and used vanilla Silk for the milk. I also did half white sugar and half brown sugar. Added both cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice (didn't have just nutmeg). I also upped the amount of zucchini to 5 cups, left out the nuts and added about 1/4 cup raisins (what I had left in the package). I did not have loaf pans, so I used casserole dishes and made Zucchini Cake. This made about 21 servings at 131 calories a serving. Everyone in the family loved it.

Made this tonight. Really delicious! I haven't made zucchini bread in years. I made it as is except I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and I had to use all nutmeg instead of cinnamon because my son is allergic. A hit, I will definitely make it again!

I love the proportions for all ingredients.  Less sugar allows me to tweak by adding a tablespoon of molasses, 1 cup raisins and 1 cup dark chocolate chips.  I also round down the whole wheat flour and replace with some ground flax seed and toasted wheat germ.  I make as muffins and mini breads so guessing a bit on higher temp and less time.

I followed this recipe exactly as written with one exception; I had some chopped pecans I wanted to get rid of so I used those instead of walnuts.  It was delicious. It was moist, the texture was perfect, it was not overly sweet.  I  sifted the flour mixture twice  and was careful not to  overcook it.  I tested after 40 minutes and again at 50 minutes and took it out at 50.  Of course, ovens do vary.  I will almost certainly make this again and not change a thing  except maybe use the pecans again.

Loved it - used yogurt as suggested because my husband doesn't eat oil and didn't have walnut so used almost slivers and only one cup of sugar - it was quite sweet at that. Only problem is....I ate too much!

Too sweet and somewhat rubbery. Made into muffins which domed very high. The mini muffins were like basketballs. But we ate all of them and it's a way to eat more vegetables.

SO GOOD!  The loaves even smell wonderful while baking. I like that this recipe makes 2 loaves, since I am doing the work I can make enough to freeze as well.  I have made this about 3 times already and will make again.

This is a great recipe as is, but I have been trying to watch my weight, so I made a couple of changes to make it even healthier and lower in calories. I substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil and only put in 1 cup of sugar. It was plenty sweet enough and really moist. It also takes the recipe to 4 smart points per serving on Weight Watchers.

Very easy recipe, turned out perfectly! I made one loaf in a cast iron loaf pan and 12 muffins. The muffins were ready in half the time of the bread. As for substitutions, I increased the zucchini to a little over 4 cups, replaced the oil with an equal amount of unsweetened applesauce, replaced 2 of the eggs with a large, very ripe, mashed banana, used all whole wheat flour, added an extra tsp of cinnamon as well as a tsp of nutmeg and only used 1/4c turbinado sugar and 1/2c brown sugar. I will definitely make this again!!

Like many other people have commented on this recipe, I used less sugar and added more cinnamon. It turned out wonderfully! I have had many complements on this recipe and will make this again.

Good but a little dry. I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe would try using 1/2 c applesauce instead of milk next time to give it more moisture.

I love zucchini bread but am counting calories so I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and a sugar substitute blend (Zing) for the sugar, and left out the nuts. Comes to about 130 calories for a muffin (makes about 18 muffins). Next time I may try subbing the milk for Almond Milk.

My husband is pretty picky when it comes to "healthy" snacks and he LOVED this! (almost ate a whole loaf himself...)

Changes I made:
-1 c reg. flour, 1 c wheat flour, 1 c oatmeal
-1 c sugar and about a tsp of honey
-used 1/2 applesauce 1/2 oil for the oil
-sprinkled brownsugar on top 1/2 way through cookies

This is good but I used one reviewer's advice and substituted plain yoghurt for the vegetable oil.  I'm not sure if this is what's responsible for the spongey texture but I think it might be.  I also added a touch of lemon zest and a dash of nutmeg.  The flavor is wonderful - it's just the texture that's not quite right.
