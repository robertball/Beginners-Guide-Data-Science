This was super easy to assemble and make.  I made it for a father's day picnic and out of 5 side dishes, there were no leftovers on this one.  We sliced the leek the night before and soaked them in a bowl of water to get all the sand out.  In the morning, all I had to do was assemble and bake.  It was super easy and delicious.

My husband and I really liked this dish.  There was a little liquid in the bottom of the pan but I just spooned it out.  I will make this again.

A creative dish that's eye-pleasing and very quick to throw together.  I only had one leek, so I made 1/8 of the recipe.  I liked the combination of ingredients, though next time, I would reduce the amount of rosemary and sage, as the bitterness/pungentness of these spices only heighten the bitterness of the leek.  I would increase the amount of thyme, crackers, and cheese (by a substantial amount for the latter two).  If the crackers and cheese are not themselves too salty, I would also add a pinch of salt.  I used olive oil instead of butter and it turned out fine.

This was really good, but kinda' soupy.  It would have been very good with rice as a bottom layer, which could have soaked up some of the juice.

I went to the farmer's market the other day and happened to buy both leeks and tomatoes, so decided to try this.  It is really good.  Flavorful and so, so easy!!!  AS was mentioned, some liquid does accumulate at the bottom..so just serve with a slotted spoon.  Also, I was out of sage and thyme, so I just used Italian seasoning...and it tasted great!  will definitely make again and again.  In fact...I think I'll go back to the farmer's market tomorrow and get some more tomatoes and more leeks :o)

This was really, REALLY good! Even my mother-in-law liked it. I was generous with the crushed crackers and it turned out great. Thank you!

I made this for dinner guests tonight and they reached for second and third helpings.  I drizzled some olive oil over the leeks before adding the rest of the ingredients, and they cooked up quite nicely that way.  Very nice dish, but not quite the rave that deserves five stars.  I will definitely add this to my side-dish repertoire because it tastes good AND is a breeze to prepare!

I used this recipe as a guide for preparing leeks, of which I had bunches.  However, I had no tomatoes, no buttery crackers, and no mozz.  So I used plain breadcrumbs, white cheddar, and omitted the tomatoes.  Then followed the recipe as written, and it was fantastic!  No soggy bottom, no pools of liquid (which of course is caused by the cooking tomatoes).  Next time I may use the tomatoes for just as "variation" but I will seed them first.  Awesome!

Best with thick juicy tomatoes and then not as much butter is needed.  Delicious!

Made this last night and it  was the most enthusiastic I've ever seen Himself about a vegetable dish (normally you have to chloroform him to get any down him at all). Only change made - as I didn't have any dried sage - was a sprinkle of McCormicks Greek Seasoning instead.

This was the best ever! It came out perfect. Even my picky 6 year liked it :) If you de-seed the tomato first it won't have so much liquid. Also sourdough bread crumbs in place of the buttery crackers ROCKS!!

No, this what not I was looking when I planned to make leek this way as it was very much chewy, I am disappointed , next time I wont add leek at all to the recipe,may be subs with cabbage or mushroom will do good ,provided cabbage also is precooked a little bit.

This recipe was extremely easy and the taste was out of this world.  The only thing that I changed was the amount of grated mozarella on the top.  I just grated it all over the top instead of the small amount it required.  I will make this recipe many, many more times in the future.

I cooked this tonight because I had leeks and plum tomatoes on hand from a local farm bag.  The only change that I made was that I used swiss cheese (because that was all I had).  Results were fabulous ! The swiss cheese was delicious with the leeks. Some reviewers commented on liquid remaining on the bottom.  I had none.  It was perfect.  Perhaps the plum tomatoes made a difference?  I also let mine sit in the warm oven for about 15-20 min after it was finished. Thanks for the recipe!

Personally, we did not care for this at all. I felt way too many leeks for my taste. It was a beutiful dish for presentation but I just didn't think it was keeper.

This is a nice light side dish for a hot day. I deseeded the tomatoes and used just the white and light green parts of the leeks. Also left out the thyme from the topping and added in some garlic powder. I had crackers to use up this time but another time I'd probably just use breadcrumbs. Thanks for the recipe Sal we all enjoyed it,.

My tomatoes must have been too dry as this came out dry, undercooked and the flavors didn't meld at all.  I did, however pop the leftovers in a skillet the next day with some chicken broth and simmer for 1/2 hour and it was excellent!

Delicious!  I changed it a little for my lactose intollerance.  Almond milk was a great sub.  And I added flax seeds to the crumbs, also rice cheese tastes great on top

I made this as written, and thought it was ok. I sliced the leeks very finely - I should have used less green, I think. They were a tad tough and bitter - and broke the slices apart into rings so they would cook better. I wish I'd added a little diced onion to the leek layer, and also used some extra-sharp Cheddar with the mozzerella. This was quite nice for a change, but I'm in no hurry to make it again. If I did, I would probably omit the leeks altogether. Thanks, anyway. (PS, I did, in fact make it again - the next day. That time I omitted the leeks, and used tomato, onion and mushroom. It worked really well, reminiscent of pizza!!)

This was pretty good, not great, but good.  I went through a lot of trouble to find leeks and I think this would have come out just as good with yellow onions. The leeks seemed chewy....maybe I didn't cook it long enough.  There was so much liquid at the bottom.  If I make this again, I may just use onions, cheaper and easier to find.
