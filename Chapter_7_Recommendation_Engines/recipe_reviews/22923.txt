This recipe had a good flavor, but I don't think tofu was the best filling choice.  I would probably go with the soy "ground meat" or textured veggie protein next time.  The sauce was delicious!

I too felt this recipe was on the bland side.  Thankfully, I added a lot more crushed tomatos than the recipe called for; I couldn't help myself -I had to mix some in with the stuffing.  Thank goodness I did -it was the only thing that made the peppers edible.  Next time I will go with a traditional tomato/onion/rice type stuffed pepper mix.

I had never had tofu before so this was a nice dish to first try it in.  But in the end, I played with this dish some.  (1) Added lemon pepper, salt, pepper, parsley, and more paprika & parsley.  (2) Topped the stuffed peppers with cheddar cheese.  (3) Omitted tomatoes (just our choice.) and poured cooking wine in bottom of sprayed down pan. --- My 3 teenagers LOVED it!  My husband & I thought it needed something a little more. (Cheese?)  --- I WILL make this dish again for my teenagers.  Perhaps with some toying I'll grow to love this dish as good as my teenagers.

And also here... my German opinion to German-American veggie cooking... good idea... did that as well - my mum's stuffed peppers go without the rice, only ground beef and she serves them with potatoes. But as I am vegetarian I altered the recipe and stuff them with rice an lentils (needs some adjustments in the flavouring... if you want to stay closer to the original you are better off with the rice/tofu!)

I wanted to like this recipe, I really did. But I found it much too bland. If I ever do make this again, I will follow some of the other reviewer's suggestions and add some other ingredients to give this dish more flavor.

I used red peppers, which went very well with the sauce.  I found the filling to be a little dull.  Maybe some cheese or increasing the seasonings would help.

I used meatless crumbles in place of the tofu and it turned out great!

I made five recipes' worth for our Wednesday finals week dinner in my dorm. Even the people on my floor who scarcely eat anything but meat loved this recipe. And, though simple, the tomato garlic sauce that accompanied it was also a hit.

This recipe didn't work.  Like other reviewers, I thought the filling was bland and had an unpleasant texture.  I added feta on the top before baking but it wasn't much help.  The whole thing reminded me and my girlfriend of eating ricotta cheese, but neither of us like ricotta.  

I think the problem comes from the misuse of tofu.  In situations like this, it tends to respond more like a dairy free (and taste free) cheese than as a meat replacer.  You could still use it to add protein to the dish, but I might up the amount of rice and decrease the tofu in the mix.  I would also add more seasoning of some kind or another.  I suspect that using seasoned ground beef in place of tofu would also solve these problems.

Added some feta for some added flavor and it was very yummy. Maybe cut back a bit on the amounts f liquids added, as they tend to be a bit runny. Will be making again though!

I think this reciepe lacked bold flavors even though I through in a chile serrano in the stuffing and a couple other spices after reading other comments. :( My bf said he liked them but I think he was just being nice.

These were really delicious and very flavorful! I used 2/3c. of cooked barley instead of the rice and added a touch of cumin (1/2 tsp.) along with the other spices in the mushroom / tofu mix. I also used 4 red peppers, cut lengthwise and seeded.

I've been making this for years, it's a huge hit at my house.  My changes: pretend ground beef in place of tofu; a nutty, wild rice instead of white; and I add some feta.      Yum.

My family and I did not enjoy this recipe. If I were to make it again I would use a ground meat alternitive.  But if you love   tofu then go for it.

This recipe was pretty bland... I had high hopes with the visual of the stuffing pre-baked, but nothing exciting once roasted.  2 stars because is wasn't BAD,  just  needs inspiration.

This was wonderful stuffed pepper.
Reading other reviews, made a few adjustments to the recipe:

*Sautéed onions etc with curry powder
*Used aburaage tofu (fried pouch tofu) cut in small slivers, for more substantial, crunchy consistency
*Boiled the peppers 2 minutes to soften, before filling

This wasn't bad, but not my taste. If I were to do it again, which I don't think I will, then I would make a lot more tomato sauce to go with it.

I'm not a big fan of tofu, so I substituted rice instead (bad plan). My friend suggested that I substitute potatoes next time. Just thought I'd pass that along.

Pretty tasty, but I found the recipe rather bland. Perhaps next time, I will throw some feta cheese and rosemary in also. The walnuts were a great touch, though.

A bit bland and takes a while to make.  I think it would be better with sweeter red or yellow peppers.

Fantastic recipe!  My family really enjoyed this recipe.
