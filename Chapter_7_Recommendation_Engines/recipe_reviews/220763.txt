I made this recipe at the request of a friend except I used a traditional walnut filling instead of poppyseed because I did not have poppyseeds on hand. The recipe measurements are dead-on accurate. The dough has a brioche type texture. I found it to be soft and sweet and easy to work with. I had no problems rolling it and found that extra flour was not needed (get it, kneaded). During the hour it rested I kept it uncovered in my oven on proof. I would like to make this again using the poppyseed filling and will try substituting half the water out that is called for to make the dough with milk for even richer dough. Great recipe!

This dough is awesome! So easy to work with and turned out great. I cheated on the poppy seed filling and used canned.. But this dough recipe is definitely a keeper

I used poppy seeds from GFS, and the filling was delicious.  I thought it odd that the recipe did not call for the dough to have a "first rise" before forming the loaves.  I don't know if the humid day was a factor, but the dough was so springy that I had a hard time rolling it out to the 12x16 rectangle, and while I stopped to re-read the directions, the dough rested a moment and was easier to roll.  I baked it as directed, and unfortunately, I have more of a poppy seed cracker roll with a delicious filling.  It is not bread-like at all.  If I were to make it again, I would let the dough rise for an hour before rolling out to form the rolls, then let it rise again.

Been making makos beigli for 30 years and my husband is Hungarian (among many other Magyar recipes).  This recipe is the best of any I have found  The dough is easy to work with and, yes, I use the canned poppy seed.  I add a table spoon of honey and some grated lemon rind and a teaspoon or so of lemon juice to "doctor" the canned poppyseed.  Enjoy!

I used to buy poppy seed rolls at a local farmer's market...and marvelled at their deliciousness and seeming difficulty to make.  I am so glad I found this recipe! A Polish friend requested a poppy roll for Christmas and so I experimented.  Found this recipe and (thanks to all the previous reviewers!) tried this one as it had the best ratings and looked easy and sensible as well.  Since we have an eggless kitchen I omitted the egg (added a half tb of cornstarch into the dough and rubbed the loaf with butter and cornstarch prior to baking), also used 9oz of poppy seeds, 2 tb extra of sugar in both the filling and the dough.  It came out amazing! A Russian and a Pole at dinner both told me it was the best poppy seed roll they ever had.  I loved it too and made more for presents...definitely a keeper!  I'm now experimenting with whole wheat and sourdough versions. Awesome recipe! Thanks!

Made this for my father who may not be here next Easter. We always had poppy seed bread on Easter Sunday growing up in NJ. Moving to Fl, changed that. This Recipe was great and the closest I have seen to what I remember as the kid. It hit a home run for me with dad he really loved it.
I found the recipe very easy especially for someone who relies on her bread maker and has not kneaded dough since 8th grade home economics..... thanks so much for sharing it will be a staple in my holiday bake book!

This roll tasted delicious I made the recipe exactly how it is stated except cut everything in half because I only wanted one roll.... It also looked rather impressive and wasn't all that hard to make... all the steps in the instructions may look intimidating but it is actually rather easy...

This was just incredible!!!!!!!!!!!!!  When I saw it was a yeast dough, I had second thoughts but it was so easy to put together and the dough came out perfect and trust me I am not any kind of dough expert.     I used canned poppy seed filling and used a butter knife to spread it all over the inside to just about 1" from the edge and it came out so good baked just as the recipe said.     This is definitely a KEEPER.  THANK YOU for sharing it with the world!!!!!   Right up there for holiday traditional sweetbread for us!!!!!!

Great recipe!  Thank you.  My Polish mom always added Golden raisins to her recipe.  Tends to give a little more moisture to the roll.  Also walnuts chopped rather small.

I wish I had my Czech grandmother's recipe.  Oh well.  Changes I  would suggest trying -double the amount of flour- 4 cups of flour to make two loaves rather than 4 cups for two loaves. As an option, add a tablespoon of sour cream to the dough.  It does make the dough sticky and requires more flour, but you can pinch and seal the edges of the dough better this way. Add a teaspoon of vanilla to the filling,  and sprinkle on some golden raisins, which can be soaked first. Substitute honey for sugar. Avoid using the canned poppy seeds - you can find dried poppy seeds around. No need to glaze with egg white, use the whole egg in the dough instead.

Excellent! My mother and Slovak grandmother made this every year at Christmastime. They made poppy seed, apricot, and nut rolls using this same basic recipe, just substituting the filling.

Same recipe as I have lost long ago - on an old label from poppy seed filling from a Polish Store, that always turned out well for me. The only difference that I have noticed was the butter melted and cooled to be added to yeast instead of working it in with a pastry knife, as in this recipe. Many thanks for posting!

The dough came out perfect the first try.  Be sure the seam is down and centered while raising and baking or you may have some filling leak out

It seemed to take a lot longer to rise to double in bulk than the one hour.  I let mine rise 2 hours, and it was a little flat still.  I could blame the yeast.  I will try it again, because the dough was good and I used a can of poppy seed filling and it was very easy.

It took me 3 loaves to get it perfect ( I'm an amateur at baking). It kept coming out too crispy so I followed one reviewers recommendation and let it rise another hour before rolling to form rolls. I also bought fresh poppy seeds off amazon. Turned out great ! Will make this again!

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and it came out great! My Slavic husband said that the taste of both the dough and the filling was PERFECT. I was worried at how thin the pastry was, but I guess that contributed to it baking perfectly through all the layers. Even though my seam was down and centered, it still leaked - oh well. This recipe is a keeper!

I thought this recipe was fantastic, especially the bread.  It was extremely easy to make (I haven't baked like this since high school 15 years ago).  Poppyseed in my opinion is rather expensive, and though my husband raved about the poppyseed filling, I found it bitter compared to a canned variety I used for comparison.  However, the bread is quite versatile and tasted wonderful with a raspberry filling!  Did I mention how easy the dough is to work with?  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Several things to mention: The level of fineness for the poppy seed grind could guide the baker better than, “about a minute”. 
Recipe doesn’t yield sufficient dough to roll out two 12”x16” rectangles. That’s unless the dough is thin to the point of being opaque. 
In addition, the recipe misses proper instruction on the rising period.  Should it be covered or uncovered for that hour +\-?
Positioning the long  seam under the roll might also mention that the seam, like the ends, should be pinched to spare ooze.

What a mess.  The half cup of milk was a big mistake.  Everything leaks out during the rising time.  No sugar in the dough seems like a blunder as well.

I 've been looking for a poppyseed roll recipe that would be closest to the one my Slovak Grandma used to make.  This is it!  She always called this to-die-for bread "machovnik" (pronounced "mack-ov-nik."). The only difference is she always used milk instead of water in the dough (which I did this time too) and she used shortening instead of the butter (which is why I wanted a different recipe). I definitely prefer using organic butter!  However, my bread spread out on the baking sheet and ended up being rather flat. It tasted just as good, but I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions  of how to help it keep it's shape other than putting it in a bread pan.

As usual, I used the canned poppyseed filling by Solo.  Soooo, I'm so glad you gave a recipe for the poppyseed filling.  I will definitely use that from now on!

This was incredible! The dough was easy to work with. My Slovak father used to buy this at a bakery in New York, I haven't had it in 40 years!! It tasted exactly how I remember it! I also used a can of poppy seeds, simply fabulous! Thank you so much for a little piece of my childhood!

I rolled my dough too thin and it split, but it was easy to make and smelled wonderful. I also let the dough rise for about 30 minutes in a warm place. It handlers well and baked up nicely... Cut beautifully. I sprinkled with sugar before baking and also sprinkled with powdered sugar after baking. Smelled like my childhood!

This is an outstanding recipe!I used my stand mixer for the dough which made it quite easy to do.I also used canned poppy seed filling like many others. Before baking I did the egg white wash and sprinkled with raw sugar. A keeper for sure!

The proportions are way off. It is a poor imitation of Eastern European recipes (I grew up in Russia and very familiar with this kind of bakery). The dough must have longer rising time, and better to use milk instead of water. Looks like a quick make to fool guests. Not recommended.

I followed the recipe and it turned out delicious.  Or so I’m told.  I’m not a fan but the Mrs. is and she said it was good, very good.   

I did struggle with the dough, trying to get it into two 12 X 16 rectangles.  Probably just not patient enough to roll it as thin as I needed.  I will try again.

Can anyone give me advice as to how to get the poppy seed filling not to seep out while in the oven?  EVERY TIME I make this, it oozes out.  Other than that, it's delicious .  I'm making this afternoon and welcome your input.  Thanks!

The next time I make this I would give the dough a first rise and not roll it out as thin as was suggested as  i did have a little filling spill out during baking but this recipe is absolutely delicious!

My husband is hungarian and he was delighted with this poppin seed roll. I just added apple mermelade to the dough before putting the poppin seed filling. It helps to keep the moisture. Great recipe!

When I was a child my Omi always had a poppy seed roll in the freezer just in case someone stopped by unexpectedly. I never liked poppy seed anything as a child, but my son loves poppy seeds so I made this for him. I made the dough in my bread machine on the dough cycle which freed up my time to do other things. I made 4 smaller rolls (8x12 inches) that baked in 25 minutes, I brushed them with butter when I removed them from the oven, then with a simple glaze (1/2 cup icing sugar and 1 tbsp cream) once they cooled slightly. I shared them with our neighbours and everyone enjoyed them.

This recipe was great! I would use 11/4 cups of flour next time because the dough was stiff for me. I used poppyseed paste that was ready made and I put a light icing on top. Definitely the taste I was hungry for.

I used an old family recipe for the poppy seed filling rather than the one in this recipe - but only because I had some left over from another recipe.  The dough came out OK, but like others, I think it would have benefited from a second rise.

Great tasting recipe. Not sure what happened but I noticed my dough didn't double in size after an hour. I attempted the recipe twice and even used a new packet of yeast. I will still use this recipe but next time I'll try using bread flour and see if that changes anything. Otherwise this recipe is the best just makes a smaller loaf.

I made this one day while having a really sweet tooth and quite a few poppy seeds around. It turned out so so good! Used less sugar (personal preference), but followed the rest. Oh, and may I just mention that it goes great with wine? I certainly wouldn't have thought that.

I made this roll exactly like the recipe stated. Everything was fine til I added the poppy seed mixture. It had been in the fridge for at least 6 hours. Was very runny and put it in the 1st roll. Rolled the cake and liquid came oozing out! For the 2nd one, I only put in the poppy seeds that were on top of the liquid. Was a bit better but not great. Put it in the oven and baked for exactly 30 minutes. Was a bit too over cooked. Let it rest with a towel on it til it cooled off as suggested. Tastes ok but bread a bit hard. Thank goodness I put the rolls on parchement paper as so much liquid came out... and started to burn. Would have been a disaster trying to clean the cookie sheet. Might make again or might try another recipe...

I made this recipe as written.  I had to knead in quite a bit of flour to make it not sticky.   When I rolled it out to the size indicated, the dough was so thin it was translucent. and subject tore easily.

  It is quite tasty, but a bit on the sweet side.

Had to try this out.  My parents are both from large German and Austrian families.  Poppy seed rolls are traditional for me at Christmas.  Wanted to see how this compared. The poppy seed filling was way too runny. Will not make again.

My grandparents were Czech.  When I made this roll, both my mom & dad said "your grandmas would be  proud".  I did modify the recipe a bit - instead of brushing the roll with the egg white prior to cooking, I baked it as is.  At the suggestion of my father,  I mixed up a little bit of powder sugar and milk, creating an icing and brushed it on as soon as it came out of the oven.  DELICIOUS!

People ask me for the recipe--until they find out it involves yeast. I give them the recipe and make it for them.  Nothing to it. I love yeast dough because you can shape it. I am having trouble with 2c. flour  dividing the dough into two  12x16". No way. There is only enough dough for one pastry. I doubled the flour to 4c. Also , the directions say to start rolling up from the short  (12") side. Shouldn't that be "roll up from the 16"side  so that you have a long pastry instead of a short and fat one? ( I used the Hungarian poppy seed filling, also on this website) The taste is wonderful.Those Europeans know how to cook--especially for the holidays.

The ratio on pastry to poppyseed was off for my family. Too many poppyseeds. I will make a single loaf with the bread next time and cut the poppyseed mix in half. Maybe add a little more sugar to the bread dough to make up for the reduced sugar/poppyseed mixture.
