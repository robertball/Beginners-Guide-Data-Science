Great recipe! Tasty and satisfying.
Serves 5 or 6, instead of the 4 mentioned.
Found in markets since you wrote recipe various products with jalapenos (cheese, corn chips), so had option of using regular salsa and omitting separate jalapenos.
Am using sour cream or avocado as garnish.
Another comment noted that most canned refried beans are NOT vegetarian. So can use home made refried, or plain canned red beans.

Loved these but I have a couple of things to say here. I used jalapeno in place of the bell but that is the only change I made. I personally just felt it was the right call. I am in no way a vegetarian but feel it necessary to point out that most all of the refried  beans you buy in the store are made with lard. Again, I have no issues eating lard but it is not vegetarian. You'd need to buy special beans or make your own if you are a vegetarian.  These were good and I will most definitely make them again. Thanks for sharing!

I added jalapenos while cooking and chopped tomatoes with the lettuce.  This is awesome!  Thank you.

Love this recipe. We swapped out the salsa with salsa con queso  and it was amazing (idea of the lovely K) we will probably make that a standard with this meal ... only downside is that we ate so much we ruined our dinner appetite

made it as is -  only two of us so had a lot of waste.  Will apportion it better next time.  Too much of the beans.  Really good.  I added some salsa on top of mine.

I substituted chili with beans for the refried beans, added bacon crumbled up and topped with sour cream.  Great recipe that is quick and easy.  Thanks for sharing it.

Just made it for a late night meal as I had been craving something mexican lately. Honestly, it turned out amazing! Thank you so much for such a simple, satisfying dish!
