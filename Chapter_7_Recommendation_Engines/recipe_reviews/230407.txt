I used mostly coconut milk... pecans or walnuts, dates and coconut. cinnamon and some coconut sugar.  most excellent, and keeps well refrigerated for the following day. rinsing the quinoa  *well* several times is key to avoid bitterness.

I used natural creamy peanut butter instead and added 2 Tbsp brown sugar and it tasted pretty good.

Easy to make!  I subbed raisins for the prunes, but any dried fruit would have worked!  Great hot cereal.

Very nice breakfast option!  We have a prune tree so I was looking for ways to use some up, made it as directed except soy instead of almond milk plus a spoonful of almond butter and a dollop of vanilla to get the flavor back in.  Also tried adding a diced apple and coconut, both of which were good additions though the apple can throw off the liquid-to-quinoa ratio.

this was the first time I used quinoa and I didn't like it...but reading more about quinoa, I'm going to rinse it more then toast it (to hopefully cut the bitterness). this seems like it will be really good so I'm going to try it again!

This is a healthy, tasty meal. I used whole milk, and added whole grain organic flax meal for fiber and more taste. Nutmeg make me sleepy so I used ground cloves instead. Yum! I have also made it using one apple and apple pie spice for flavor. Another yum!

Mine came out too sweet, but may have been the Dried plums I used since I didnt have prunes. Still ill cut the fruit in half and try again.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I didn't have vanilla almond milk so I used the original unsweetened almond milk. I also used creamy peanut butter. Will definitely make this again.

I'm doing the Dr.Oz 48 hour detox cleanse and this is pretty much the breakfast.. Gotta say I dont care for it! I really though it would be ok, because I really like quinoa salads, but the texture and the prunes really turn me off. Might skip this tomorrow and just do the shakes all day!!
