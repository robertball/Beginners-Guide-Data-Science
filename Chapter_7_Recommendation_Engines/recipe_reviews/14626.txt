This has to be the best Stroganoff on earth.  I did add 1 can cream of mushroom an upped the sour cream to 3/4 and the mayo down to a 1/4.  This is so fast and simple to make let alone awesome.  This is a must try!  Thanks for this one it will definitely get used and passed on!

i don't understand the negative reviews here. obviously, this is not a gourmet recipe. but it is quick and filling comfort food that also happens to taste great, and is very easy to modify a bit here and there to suit your tastes. after i browned the beef, i rinsed it once to help eliminate grease. i browned the onions and mushrooms separately in a little butter, and i think that helped the flavor a lot. i increased the garlic powder a bit, and added a few dashes of dried dill. i decreased the mayo and increased the sour cream. also added just a bit of worchestershire sauce. although it doesn't look too spectacular, it tastes yummy!

With a splash of worchesteshire, 12 oz. of sour cream, and less mayo...this recipe is very good.  (It can get tangy if you use Miracle whip.  I used Hellman's).  I didn't think it was bland at all.  It tasted exactly like I expected stroganoff to taste, only better!

This was yummy! I omitted the beef broth and used condensed cream of mushroom soup instead of just mushrooms. (I like my stroganoff thick!) I also added extra garlic powder and some basil.  We ate leftovers for lunch the next day! Even my husband liked it!

Apart from using fresh mushrooms, I made this as the recipe stated, and it was thin, bland and watery. So, I added a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup, some more garlic powder, lots of black pepper, several good sloshes of Worcestershire sauce, and a little more mustard powder. The result was much better! This is a great basic recipe, but it *does* need some modification. Thanks!

Added add'l sour cream, lots of salt and pepper and dried parsley (to taste), which flavored the dish wonderfully without overpowering it.  A great trick: since you only need 1/2 cup of beef broth, use the rest of the can in the water you boil the noodles in to add extra flavor - I ONLY USED 6 OZ EGG NOODLES - PERFECT AMOUNT!

Glad I checked previous reviews first so I knew what I was expecting. Bland, thin sauce and not enough of it. I added about 1T. worcestshire sauce, 1 T. vermouth,1t.yellow mustard, a few shakes of paprika, s&p, more sour cream and about 3/4 can of crm of mushroom soup.MMMMM now that's a ground beef stroganoff I can serve my husband and 18yr. old son!

YUMMY!  The whole family loved this recipe.  I used 1 1/2lbs of ground beef, so I just increased the sour cream and the mayo to make more sauce.  My kids HATE mushrooms, so I just chopped them up really fine, and put them in with the ground beef, and they never even knew that they were in there.  Easy, fast and CHEAP.  Bet this meal didn't even cost $2.00 per person!

Used the recipe and added a little extra sour cream. I found it to be excellent and my wife has asked to add this to the monthly menu list. Definitely a keeper. Not fancy, just plain good.

The beef stroganoff was good but the sauce could have packed a little more kick. Still, hubby loved it & that's good enough for me.

My husband isn't a fan of ground beef, but this is his comfort food!  I love this and make it often.  Tonight I didn't have any beef broth, but I had a packet of Au Jus...I used about 1/3 of it, and I think it is even better, and if it's too thin, just add a tablespoon of flour to 1/4 c or so of milk and add that to your mixture...WORKS LIKE A CHARM!

I don't understand this recipe. The mayo made it extremely oily. Why not just use cream instead? My second batch (with cream) turned out perfect and was very rich tasting without the oil and vinegar taste of the mayo.

Wonderful dish! I made it tonight. I cut up half an onion and saute for 5 mins. Then I threw in my chop meat to brown.  I sprinkled minced garlic on top of meat while browning with a little adobo, a dollop of dijonnaise and worcheshire. After browning, I drained off all liquid. I then mixed in a a bowl worcheshire sauce, half a thing of sour cream and one large tablespoon of mayonnaise. I added beefy onion lipton soup mix and a cup of water. I added to beef in pan and let simmer for 15 minutes.  Extremely flavorful. I cooked my noodles and added a teaspoon of butter so they wouldnt stick. This is a great recipe. Fast, Easy and Quick!

We really like this recipe.  I have made it several times, and it's always a hit.  I use about a Tsp (or more) of Dijon mustard instead of the mustard powder, and I also use beefy mushroom soup instead of the beef broth.  This is an easy recipe to play around with and alter based on what you have on hand, or personal preference.  I have used onion powder or dried minced onion in the place of the chopped onion and minced garlic in the place of the garlic powder...it always comes out good.  Not fancy, but a good, quick weeknight meal.

I've been making this recipe for more years than I'd care to admit to, and outside of the mayo, it's always served me well.  I usually only use I.M.O. (a substitute for sour cream) rather than mayo and sour cream. Cookie

As written, it's GOOD, but not great. WORTH MAKING AGAIN WITH MINOR CHANGES!! I'm a garlic fan so I automatically doubled the garlic powder, otherwise following the recipe EXACTLY (using light sour cream & mayo). **UPDATE**: double the listed onion & seasonings (4x the listed garlic), add pepper & increase sour cream by 1/4c while decreasing mayoby 1/4 c. This seasons it better, gives more zing while keeping it creamy. Wonderful & easy! :)

I tried this tonight and was not entirely disappointed.  It was, as other reviewers said, a bit bland.  It does need some zip.  Next time I will add a can of cream of mushroom soup, some paprika, a Tbsp of all-purpose flour mixed up in the broth to thicken sauce and (to our taste) a shot of hot sauce.  Then sprinkle a little parsley over the top of dish before serving.  I have not used mayo before in a stroganoff, but I found it did not damage the flavor at all.  I possibly might replace the garlic powder with a couple tsp of minced garlic instead.  All-in-all, the dinner was enjoyable and I will make it again with my alterations.

Trying the recipe as written was good Stroganoff and is a terrific starter if someone wants to have a base recipe. Stroganoff isn't supposed to be gourmet - but harty, tasty, and filling. Tonight I used 3/4 pound of a tender steak, cut it into pieces salting & peppering sauted in with chopped onion and canned mushrooms. (I even sprinkled in some ground flaxseed since we try to use that wherever possible for health reasons.) Upped the sourcream and added worchestire because I had no mayo (only Miracle Whip).  Since Stroganoff is a bit sour, I made STARNETSA's "Green Beans with Cherry Tomatoes" to bring the meal into balance.

I'm sorry but the recipie as written needs some help. First, ditch the mayo. All that will do is make your dish oily. I replace the mayo with heavy cream. Added about 2 tablespoons of worcester sauce, and a pinch of fresh oregano. 
It turned out great. Nice and creamy vs. watery and oily.

This is very good!  I added some salt and pepper, but other than that, it's great. I didn't have mushrooms so I left them out, but that didn't stop my family from devouring the entire recipe. There were no leftovers!

This was a great recipe. I did change a few things. I didn't have mustard powder, so I used a squeeze of mustard instead. Also I used cream of mushroom soup instead of mushrooms and mayonaisse. Mine turned out wonderful. I have struggled before trying to get the amount of ingredients right with this recipe. But now I have a great recipe to follow and it's super easy and quick. Thanks. :)

This reminds me of one of the first dishes I learned to make for my husband 40 years ago. I found it in a cook book and it called for meat balls instead of just ground beef. It also used cream of mushroom soup. Over the years our budget got better and we used bite-sized pieces of left-over steak or roast beef, sometimes simmered briefly in wind. Lately we have used cream of celery soup instead of the cream of mushroom (easier on older tummies). We continue to doctor it up with parmesan cheese, garlic, green pepper (toss in at the last minute to warm not wilt) whatever we're in the mood for. We've learned not to omit the sour cream. This dish is always easy and tastey. Thanks for the memories!

I like this recipe, it's quick and easy, sure it can use some tweaks and additions. I sauteed one whole onion with two cloves of minced garlic, and a chopped green pepper before adding the beef and browning. I seasoned everything with salt and pepper. I've made this recipe with the exact ratios of spices and sauce ingredients and I've also used prepared mustard, more sour cream, less mayo. I always add some dill weed and smoked paprika.

Easy Warm Comfort Food that fills you up! I read most of the other reviews and changed a few things. Doubled the amount of ground beef, decreased sour cream and mayo to  1/4 cup. Seasoned beef with salt pepper garlic onion and and a nice size dash of Cayanne (goes well with the sour cream and mayo) then instead of beef broth I added a 1/2 can of beef GRAVY and 1/2 cream mushroom soup for a thicker base. Wash Delishious with a little more flavor and thickness! Enjoy :-)

I used 7 large mushrooms and a medium red onion (you can never have too many fresh mushrooms).  Sauteed then added the meat.  It's mperative that you drain after the meat has cooked.  I added a little more sour cream for texture and taste.

This is a good recipe if you're looking for something to do with that pound of burger and don't want to make spaghetti sauce again.  It's easy, tasty, and hearty.

This was great although I have to admit I changed quite a bit and it turned phenomenal. I added 2 cans of mushroom soup, about 10 cloves of real garlic, 3 tbsp of soy sauce (You would be amazed what this does to a mushroom sauce, amazing) A tiny bit of worchester sauce, and added skim milk till I got th right consistency! With some salt/pepper and a dash of paprika, you will fall over at how delicious this is! I will also add that I omitted the mustard and mayo. Hope this helps to give this recipe that added kick!!!!!  Not the healtiest meal, but worth it cause its just soooo delish!

I have made stroganoff before and it wasn't nearly as good as this. That being said, I now know that I'm not a fan of this traditional dish. I just can't help but feel like I need to add more veggies and seasoning. The only change I made was to use more sour cream and no mayo.  I'm glad to have had a more authentic recipe to try. Thanks.

I've been making this dish for years.  Brown the meat and drain the fat. I use a turkey baster. Add the chopped onions, lots of black pepper and garlic powder. I don't use salt. Stir. Add a can of mushroom soup, any kind.  Stir.  Add a can of mushroom pieces and stems. Stir. Cook for 10 minutes. Just before serving, I cover the mixture with sour cream to taste. and sprinkle it with dried parsley. I serve it over rice. I find that the trick to making this dish tasty, is lots of garlic and pepper.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for it's versatility b/c I changed it quite a bit.  Here's what I used:
1 lb. ground turkey
red wine
1/2 tbsp. dried mustard
1/4 tsp. minced garlic
1 can cream of mushroom soup
slightly less than 1/2 cup sour creme
1/2 cup fat free mayo
garlic salt/pepper to taste
worcestershire sauce
1/2 chopped onion
1/2 cup beef broth
appr. 3 tbsp. prepared horseradish
elbow macaroni

I browned the ground turkey with a splash of worcestershire sauce.  I then drained and added the chopped onion, cooked for about 5 minutes.  I combined the mustard, garlic, mayo, cream of mushroom soup, and beef broth.  I added this to the beef/onion mixture and cooked for about 10 minutes.  While this was cooking I cooked the elbow macaroni.  About 3 minutes before I took off the beef mixture I added the horseradish and garlic salted/pepper to taste.  Once the macaroni was cooked, I drained and combined.  My family said it was the best stroganoff they ever tasted.  I was very surprised and pleased that you couldn't taste the fat free mayo at all.  I only changed the recipe b/c I didn't have all of the ingrediants.  We were thrilled with the taste.  Next time I'll use fat free sour cream and low fat cream of soup to make it a true low fat recipe.

I made this recipe last night and my husband loved it! I read the reviews and like others I cut down the mayo by half and used more sour cream than it called for. I also used Worcestershire sauce in the meat while cooking it and then added cooking red wine, once the meat was done I used about 3 tbs. of the broth and added it to the sour cream sauce and drained the rest from the meat before adding the sauce in! Instead of ground beef I used beef tips! Great recipe! It was amazing and so simple! I will be making this again!

Wasn't bad at all.  Way better than Hamburger helper!! for this recipe i used 1 can of condensed Campbell cream of mushroom soup.  2 Teaspoons of fresh garlic.  rottoni noodles, and scallions for decoration to add a splash of color and a impressive way to dress up the stroganoff!!  Overall me and my kids enjoyed it very much!

This was a good recipe.  I did as others and added 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo.  I increased the garlic powder and added 1 tsp. black pepper and salt to taste.  1/2 package of lipton onion soup helps the flavor a lot!   This is great over a baked potato also.

I read the reviews first prior to preparing the Ground Beef Stroganoff and would like to share my minor adjustments.  Ingredients: 1 lb. ground beef 1/2 c. chopped onion 1 tsp. yellow mustard 1 tsp. butter 1/2 tsp. garlic powder 3/4 c. sour cream 1/4 c. mayonnaise  1. Heat skillet on medium-heat and place butter in it to melt. 2. Add ground beef and let it brown (season with salt, pepper and basil). Then add the chopped onions (season again). 3. While browning the ground beef and onions, take a bowl and add the sour cream, mayonnaise, yellow mustard, mix. 4. Pour the mixture into the skillet and combine the sauce with the ground beef and onions (season with salt, pepper and garlic salt).  *Remember to keep seasoning to avoid the bland flavor the ground beef gives off.  I served this for dinner on top of rice; it's very filling. My boyfriend thought it looked grotesque but very much enjoyed it and my best friend loved it.

It was ok but if you are not a big mayonnaise fan you may want to skip this reciepe. I don't like the meat in Stragonoff so I thought this would work. I juse a bit more sc than it said to but either way I could taste the mayonnaise. I like mayonnaise spread thinly on a turkey sandwich and I don't mind it in tuan salad or chicken salad but this just tasted like mayonnaise to me. My husband liked it but me and my son did not. So I'm giving it two stars for my husband.

This was my first attempt at a stroganoff, and the results were fantastic!! I did apply some of the other reviewer's suggestions. I increased the sour cream and decreased the mayo, added a can of cream of mushroom soup, and added worcestershire to taste. My husband and I both agreed the worcestershire is a needed addition. It was super yummy. This is being added to my collection of quick-and-easy weeknight recipes!!

I can't thank you enough for putting this recipe on this website!  I was literally in tears one night not knowing what to make for dinner.  I was on the floor of my kitchen crying out to God to help me know what to quickly feed my family that everyone would like and I remembered this website.  Even my 3 year old who usually struggles to eat and normally never wants a second helping - ate this up and wanted more.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes due to what I had on hand and personal preference.  I used plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and I doubled up on the dry mustard and garlic powder.  

Next time, and yes there will be many next times, I will use fresh mushrooms and brown them with the meat for even better flavor.  Thanks. This is a keeper.

Not my favorite.  The mayonnaise definitely added an unpleasant flavor and it needed seasonings as it was very bland.  I won't be making this particular recipe again.

This was just okay.  We had dinner quick and easy.  Noticed right away there is no salt and pepper so I added that, and I used fresh sauteed mushrooms which could have been a factor in making it so runny.  Even after adding seasonings and more beef we felt there was something missing.

I made the recipe as written, only adding cream of mushroom soup per other reviewers advice.  There is some awful taste in every bite that I can't narrow down what it is?  I didn't even buy the cheap mayonaise.  A friend of mine came over just as I was finishing and I had her try the first bite.  When she made an awful face I thought to myself.. that's kind of rude.  Until I tried it... it really was that bad.

This beef stroganoff turned out pretty good for as simple as it was, but could definitely use more flavor, and the sauce needs to be thicker. I would add more seasoning next time, and either add a cream of mushroom soup or make a roux to thicken the sauce up.

This was easy and tasty.  I don't like mushrooms so I added some canned peas instead and it was good.  I also added some worchester sauce and some salt and pepper.  Would make this again.

Didn't like the mayonnaise flavor so I added some A-1 as another reviewer recommended. I also used fresh pre-sliced mushrooms instead of canned and added the sour cream at the very end instead of with the mayo and broth.  Overall quick and easy, but a little on the bland side, but you can adjust the seasonings to your own families tastes.

I just made this last night and it turned out great. I didn't add any mushrooms though because I can't stand them but the rest of the recipe worked great.

my mother used to make this... one change- she always used a Tbsp of A-1 sauce to add a bit of kick. I also made an extra cup of  sauce using the mayo and sour cream mixture. We love to have extra sauce on flat noodles! I used fresh mushrooms. I saute them in some EVOO with the onion.

I thought this was a great recipe, but I almost always add stuff. I also always use fresh mushrooms and garlic, when I have them on hand. I didn't have enough sour cream, so I substituted some plain Greek yogurt. And I added seasonings: allspice, nutmeg and a bit of paprika, along with some fresh basil. Oh, and I used a can of cream of celery soup! Delicious!

Quick, easy, very good.  I combined certain advice with my own touches to make this an excellent recipe.  A little worchestershire in the broth before you mix, a small squirt of spicy brown mustard(had none dry), a little tobasco(can't get enough) and some dried parsley while the sauce is simmering with the hamburger.  I will be excited to try this recipe as proper beef stroganoff.  BTW, added quite a bit of parm blend (w/asiago and romano), as my daughter is quite fond of cheese.  Not gourmet, but excellent for quick & easy

Loved this recipe. I read the reviews before hand and added more liquid. I used 1 cup of sour cream plus a cup of heavy cream. This made it nice and creamy. I also added worcestershire to the meat for more flavor. This is a keeper!

Yum Yum Yum....need I say more....the whole family loved it.  I couldn't stop sampling it before I finished preparing the rest of dinner.  The only suggestion is not to cook the entire amount of noodles...was a little too much. Other than that it was fabulous, and pretty easy too.

I made this recipe during the week when time was at a premium. I too have never heard of mayo in stroganoff, but decided I would try it since I didn't have much sour cream to work with. While it was cooking I tasted it to see if I needed to add any spices and I could taste nothing but the mayo. I was hoping that simmering for awhile would decrease the taste but that was not the case. We weren't too fond of this recipe and I ended up making pb&j sandwiches. I think deleting the mayo and increasing the sour cream to make a creamy sauce would be the right thing for this recipe. Sorry, I liked the concept.

I am sorry to report that I was very unimpressed with this recipe. While it was cooking, the smell of mayonnaise was very strong. I thought the sour cream would mellow it out, but it didn't. I added 1/2 can of cream of mushroom (didn't help much) When the noodles were mixed in, I did a taste test and all I could taste was the mayo! I won't use it in Stroganoff ever again! I'm not trying to discredit the author, but the taste of this meal did not work for me.

Never had a Stroganoff with mayo in it and thought I would give it a try.  I won't do it again.  The mayo was stronger than the sour cream taste.  My kids were not fans either and they usually love stroganoff. It wasn't inedible but it also wasn't nearly as good as other stroganoffs!

This got rave reviews from my family (and me). Like other reviewers: I INcreased the sour cream by half and DEcreased the mayo by half. Used fresh mushrooms (sauteed separately in butter and stirred in about 1T flour, then added it all to the burger/cream mixture to thicken the sauce). Added quite a bit more dry mustard to taste. Also added worcestershire and salt/pepper to taste. Amazing, simple and something that will go on our regular rotation.

This was a delicious basic recipe. Comfort food at it's best. As others suggested I did alter it. I added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic and a tsp of worcestershire to 1 1/2lbs of ground beef and the diced onion, after browning. Also added a packet of chicken gravy mix, and a chicken oxo cube dissolved in a 1/2 cup of boiling water. I used a whole onion and a can of mushrooms (would prefer fresh but didn't have it). I omitted the mayo and mixed together in a separate bowl 1 cup of cream. 3/4 cup of sour cream, a can of cream of mushroom soup, and the dried mustard and garlic powder. I stirred that in, and only because the color was kinda off putting, added about 2 Tbsp of kitchen bouquet. I didn't add any salt as there's more than enough in the oxo/gravy packet. Did add pepper though. Simmered for about 10 mins on med/low heat then stirred in approx' 3 cups of cooked macaroni. Yummy! Made lots and would easily feed a family of four.

The original recipe is bland. Instead of beef broth I used white cooking wine, I upped the sour cream to 3/4's cup and sour cream to 1/4 cup. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, salt, pepper and thyme. I think what really made the difference was the wine. It's an okay recipe with a bit of tweaking.

We usually use another AR stroganoff which uses cream cheese.  Tonight, we were out of cream cheese, so we tried this recipe.  It was very acceptable, although the sauce was thinner and less creamy.  A very good back-up recipe.

I made this recipe last week and it turned out ok. Then while it was simmering I added some worshechire sauce.  I think about 2 teaspoons, then it turned out really well! My husband hates beef stroganoff but really enjoyed this one. (I told him it was just a noodle dish!)

This was a popular meal in our home.  I did make small changes, mainly using fresh mushroom and garlic.  The resulting mixture needed a bit of salt, but this was a nice, quick, satisfying meal.

This recipe is quick and very tasty. I've made it twice now and used some of the other reviewer suggestions. I used 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 light mayo, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, increased the beef broth to 1 cup,  increased the dry mustard to 1 tsp and added some worcestershire sauce. I left out the mushrooms because my girls probably wouldnt eat this with them. I cooked a 12oz bag of whole wheat egg noodles and added it right to the sauce! Thumbs up from my 3 little girls and my husband. Definitely will keep this recipe!

I thought it was an ok recipe although I ommitted the mayo and mushrooms, browned the beef in a large pan, drained fat, drained the beef further on paper towel (It was 85%) sauteed onion and 1clove minced garlic in butter in large pan.  In a separate saucepan, made a white sauce with 2T. butter melted, whisked in 2T. flour until smooth and bubbly, then whisked in 1c. beef stock and 1c. milk, brought to simmer over med high heat.  Once thickened I added it to the sauteed onion, garlic, browned beef.  Also added 1/4 t. tarragon, 1T. Worchestershire, salt and pepper with 3/4c. sour cream--heat through, served over egg noodles.  Kids and Hubby liked it.

VERY good. As written. I wasn't sure if Mustard Powder and Dry Mustard was the same, but I used Dry Mustard. This was a very good dish that we will use in our monthly rotation.

Basic recipie but way too bland.  I even tried the variations that other people suggested and nobody in my family liked it.  I won't make this again.

Excellent flavor and pretty simple to make. Added a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken the stroganoff up a bit although that was simply a personal preference. We'll definitely eat this again!

At the suggestions of other reviewers, I reduced the mayo to 1/4 cup, increased the sour cream to 3/4 cup, added a splash of Worcestershire sauce and a can of cream of mushroom soup, salt and pepper to taste, and cooked the noodles in water with beef bouillon added.  My picky 2 year old and husband loved it.  It made enough for at least two meals.  I also added some Tony Chachere seasoning to my personal serving, which was great!

I followed some of the changes that others suggested and it was very tasty. Added a can of cream of mushroom soup and some Worstershire to the sauce, as well as salt and pepper to taste. I will definitely make it again.

This was pretty good but probably not worth the calorie intake. I did reduce the mayo content to 1/4 cup and used light mayo.  Next time I will try making it with fat free sour cream.

This was delicious and speedy!  Needed a pasta recipe that had ground beef in it and the thought of red sauce was not sitting right with me. I will definitely make this again!

I made it with red potatoes instead of mushrooms and superior touch beef base with a little water instead of broth and added tomato paste, some sherry, and some white wine.  yum!

This was a great recipe! I used fresh garlic instead of powder and a LOT of salt and pepper, at the end it was just missing some depth so i added some thyme, that was it! That made this dish perfect. THat's why i rated 4 stars without the thyme and extra seasoning this just wouldn't be the same

This recipe turned out all right. Compared to my sister-in-law's recipe, though, this didn't nearly measure up. It was quick and easy and did taste good; however, I guess that I'm just spoiled. :-) Thanks for sharing, though!

This was great, although I did add/change a few things. I browned the beef with a handful of chopped baby bella mushrooms, small onion and garlic. Then I added quite a bit of dried parsley and pepper. I threw in more sour cream and less mayo than noted, added a can of cream of mushroom soup and omitted the beef broth. I also used grainy mustard instead of the powder and a few liberal dashes of Worcestershire sauce. I served over the egg noodles, but to make it a bit fatter (i.e. delicious) I buttered them. I did change quite a few things and it was exactly what I remembered eating as a kid and definitely hit the nostalgic spot! My daughter also loved this.

This recipe is similar to a standard I've eaten since my childhood, and even served to guests on special occasions in my own home.  I have never added mayonnaise, and I add the sour cream at the end, just warming it to the same temperature as the stroganoff, but not to a boil.  I add 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup early on as soon as the meat has been drained.  If you want to add a splash of gourmet, pour in 1/2 cup of white wine.  Bon Appetite!

I like my stroganoff to be more saucy than meaty SO I added probably another cup of sourcream and another 1/2 cup beef broth. I used a can of Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the mayonnaise. I also added probably 1 tablespoon of Worstershire sauce, and probably almost a full teaspoon of garlic powder.  Loved it!

Just made this about 5 minutes ago.. Absolutely delicious!! I made some modifications like many others here, including 2/3 can cream of mushroom soup, omitted the beef broth, added some heavy whipping cream, and added the worcestershire sauce. Delicious!!

We enjoyed this very much, but I did spice it up a bit with some Emeril and garlic powder and pepper, and I think next time I'll add some cream of mushroom soup to thicken it.

Sooo Good!  I made this a bit different than the original, using things I already had.  I started by cooking about a teaspoonful of minced garlic in some olive oil, then added 2 chopped green bell peppers, and a half of a large onion, chopped.  Seasoned with salt and pepper and a blast or two of butter spray and cooked until soft/crisp, then put them on a plate for later.  Browned a pound of very lean ground beef in same pan, seasoned with season salt, and pepper.  Then put the bell pepper/onion mix back into the pan when the beef was done.  Mixed a can of cream of mushroom soup, about 3/4 cup of sour cream (maybe more, I don't usually measure things), about 1/4 cup of mayo.  Added a slosh of A1 beacause I wanted to add Worstershire, but didn't have any and that seemed like a reasable substitute.  Mixed into beef and veggies and let simmer.  It seemed a little thick and like it needed a beefier flavor and I had no beef broth, so I made some.  I used a packet of Top Ramen beef flavoring, dumped it into my mushroom soup can, added hot water a bit at a time, and stirred with my sour cream scooping spoon until I had some nice flavored broth.  Then added this slowly until the consistancy of the Stoganoff seemed right.  Served on buttered toast with green beans on the side.  Amazingly good.  My husband loved it too.  I am sure we will have it again soon.

This was pretty good, but I made some adjustments based on what I had in the fridge. I used plain nonfat yogurt in place of the sour cream, omitted the mushrooms, added some chopped swiss chard, and used chicken broth instead of beef. I served it over spaghetti. Very stroganoff-ish, but with more flavor in my opinion.

I like that it doesn't call for canned condensed soups and is more fresh items.  I used fresh mushrooms, drained some juice out from the mayo mixture, then added more sour cream as well as worcestshire sauce and pepper. With these modifications I loved it and will cook it again.

this was wonderful! i didn't have mustard powder so i just gave it a generous squirt of creole mustard (maybe2T?) i used light sour cream and light mayo, and it didn't taste "light" at all. and we omitted the mushrooms for personal preference.  i served it over egg noodles as suggested with green beans and it was quick easy and delicious.  thank you!

Great basic recipe! I added fresh mushrooms and used vegetable stock because that is what I had on hand. We put in over mashed potatoes. My seven old year loved it, but he loves anything that is like biscuit and gravy. We will be making this recipe again.

This was actually excellent just as written.  I only added 2-3 dashes of Worcheshire (sp?) sauce.  Definitely a true "kid pleaser".

This was really simple and worked out great for me since I only had a half cup of sour cream on hand. I used beef bouillion cube and half c water instead of broth. The sauce was rather bland and I thought it was predominantly mayonnaise tasting which I didn't care for at all. The rest of my family liked theirs and devoured every bite. I added a little parsley for color. Thanks for sharing, my family has full happy tummies after fixing this one.

I made this with 3/4 can cream of mushroom soup and (to me the best part of stroganoff) a bell pepper. I left out the mayo and mushrooms. This tasted yummy! I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that I did make some changes. I will double this recipe next time for my family of 5. We like leftovers!

It was very good. 16oz. of noodles was WAY too much. I would half that next time. I also will leave out the mayo and just use sour cream, but otherwise, my boyfriend loved it.

It may not really be fair for me to rate this, because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used 1 cup of sour cream and eliminated the mayonnaise entirely; I have never heard of mayonnnaise in stroganoff. I kept everything else the same. I thought this was very bland, and too runny. But, who knows, maybe if I had included the mayonnaise I might have liked it better.

I am trying to cut calories, so I used ground turkey, fat-free sour cream, lite mayonaise, and low-sodium beef broth.  It was delicious!!!  I will definately make this again.

This recipe is definitely a 4 star recipe. It's easy, quick, tasty and versatile. It's not something I would serve to guests, but it works as a weekday comfort meal. I too added worchestershire sauce, it works well. I replaced the mayo and sour cream with plain yogurt, light cream cheese and cottage cheese. It seems just about anything along this vein would work. I added chopped fresh broccoli to the pasta in the last few minutes of cooking to add a vegie. I also topped it off with finely sliced green onion. Yummy :)

Wonderful!  I didn't have sour cream so went with other users idea of mushroom soup and added Mrs Dash and Worcester sauce.  Also used fresh mushrooms and prepared mustard.  Very Good.  Will make again.

This tasted really good after the changes suggested by others (fresh mushrooms, dill, worstershire sauce, soy sauce, etc) and I reduced the mayo content and upped the sour cream.   Hubby liked it and 2 year old ate some.  

But I've decided I'm going to try the Easy Beef Stroganoff recipe submitted by Colleen next time.  

The mayo in this recipe isn't sitting well with me an hour after eating this.  And I made so many changes it's looking more like the other beef stroganoff recipes on the site.

I used soy sauce in the meat and some cream of mushroom. I made this dish twice, I found a good way too take out any sour taste in it is to add sugar. I would start with a 1/4 tsp and then add to taste. It really helped to tone down the zesty flavor of mayo and the sour of the sour cream.

Great Base Recipe!! I added some seasoning salt and pepper to the beef while cooking (happen to be out of garlic and salt)  Also used some red and green peppers sauted with the onions to season this dish up.  I saw some sour complaints so, I used half sour cream and half plain yogurt in place of the sour cream. Delish!!

Well, I tried. I'm a guy and a pretty by-the-book due to inexperience. I used all the extra tips and while consistency was fine, this just has no taste. I don't know my way around the kitchen enough to suggest a fix other than pepper the hell out of it. I tried the mushroom soup, extra sour cream, and worchershire. Try something else, no taste here.

My husband and I thought this was disgusting.  I even added some worschteshire sauce and couldn't eat more than a couple of bites.  It was also hard to get all of the grease out of the ground beef so it was a little too greasy for our taste.  This recipe will be going in the trash.  Sorry.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I followed the other reviews and added more sour cream to the sauce.  I agree it would have been too saucy had I not.  I also added parsley to the meat mixture for flavor and added the remaining beef broth to the water for boiling the egg noodles.  Excellent idea for enhancing the flavor.  Will certainly make again.  Tasty and easy, and everything is usually on hand for last minute dinner arrangments.

This is a terrific recipe.  Definitely quick and definitely easy.  My boyfriend loved it.  The batch I made was a little watery, but all I had to do was add corn starch to thicken it up. If that happens, just add some corn starch and it thickens right up.  Also, I used more sour cream (reduced fat) and very little mayonaise.

Pretty good stroganoff recipe - for those of you who like a little more sauce than meat, you may want to consider either adding less meat or making more sauce.  I also found that 16 ounces of noodles was an ENORMOUS amount.  But as far as tastiness, YUM YUM!!!

I've been making this dish for many years but I use  1 1/2 to 2lbs. of ground beef, 1 diced med. size onion, I don't use mustard or mayo and I up the sour cream to between 3/4 and 1 cup depending on how many egg noodles and ground beef you use.  I also add garlic powder to taste or minced garlic.  I also use a 16 oz. bag of cooked egg noodles in mine.  Salt and pepper to taste.  I sauté the onions and sliced fresh mushrooms (or canned drained mushrooms whichever you have on hand) in with my ground beef.  Drain the ground beef then add in your drained cooked noodles and stir in your sour cream last.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Makes for a fast, filling and delicious meal. I like to mix the noodles in with every thing else.  That way your noodles stay moist and don't clump together under your meat mixture and they don't dry out when storing the leftovers.

I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce.  My son, whom hates sour cream and mayo, never even noticed that they were in the meal.  He loved it!  I used veggie curly pasta as well.   I would cook this again.

I made this with some if the changes previous reviewers suggested. I didn't use mayo because I don't like it warm, so I added 1/2 a can of mushroom soup. I didn't have beef broth so I used two packs of beef oxo and put 1/2 in with the noodle water. I also added garlic salt, Worcestershire sauce, and oregano. Everyone in the family loved it.

This is a good recipe, definitely comfort food, but I very highly recommend using fresh mushrooms!  They make it SO much more flavorful than canned.  I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I did add some cornstarch and water at the end because I wanted it a little thicker.  I don't understand the reviewers who substituted condensed cream of mushroom soup.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Part of my whole reason for trying this was to get a little further away from pre-processed foods and find something closer to making it from scratch.  The thing about using condensed soups is that every sauce ends up tasting kind of the same.  I like that this has a different flavor.

I thought this was pretty tasty. I read and followed some of the reviewer suggestions, adding a can of cream of mushroom soup, some sqirts of worchestershire sauce,omitted the mayo, and my own touch, 4 oz. of goat cheese. It was yummy!!

This was terrible! No one in my family could eat it, even after I tried to fix it. I am no gourmet chef but this is the first time something I've made was not edible.

I do not know what I did wrong, but this was horrible. I normally like dishes like this, but it was unedible. My husband but said, "It was filling." Normally, I get a "that was good" comment, but not with this recipe. I check the recipe after cooking and trying it, and could not find anything I missed.

I ALWAYS read the reviews before I try a recipe, and for whatever reason I didn't with this one.  Boy, I wish I had.  Only change I made was adding fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  All I can taste is mayo.  Mayo, mayo, mayo...I added a TON more sour cream, salt, etc, but still can taste the mayo a lot.  It's edible and it will get eaten just so we don't waste $, but I will never make it again.

Okay even after taking suggestions from previous reviewers by adding mushroom soup, adding more garlic powder and worcestershire, and finally about 4 oz of V8 tomato juice, still it didn't taste anywhere close to meals I have had in restaurants especially German restaurants

Very good! The only thing I left out was the mushrooms because my family does not like them. I did as a few other reviewers had done and used 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo. It came out very tasty with a zing to it. My family loved it!

This was a hit with the family.  I added some of the suggested ingredients as well as a splash of red hot sauce for a kick.  Hubby was impressed with a new dish and really liked it.  Picky 5 year old didn't like that I used noodles that were good for us, aka whole grain noodles, but he ate it anyhow!  Thanks for a new recipe!

I also made a few changes as suggested by other reviews. I increased sour cream to 3/4 cup, decreased mayo to 1/2 cup, replaced beef broth with 1 can cream of mushroom soup, and sauteed the onions and fresh mushrooms in butter before adding to cooked beef. It was very tasty and filling. Our somewhat picky 3 year old liked it!!

this was a totally flop. It would have been better with cream of muchroom soup instead of mayo. The mayo was overpowering.

Just what my hubby asked for~ great flavor and so easy. I followed advice from some other reviewers and added a bit of Worcestershire sauce and used more sour cream than mayo. Excellent for ground beef stroganoff.

I made this last night, it was decent, but even after draining the meat, it still seemed extremely greasy, and it was pretty bland, so we added a bunch of salt and pepper to it to give it some kind of taste.

I found this to be bland, and I'd added in 1T worcestershire sauce.  I think it could use some red wine and lots more spice - maybe pepper, garlic powder, etc.

I obviously did something very wrong because this did not turn out for me. I did use more pasta than called for so that had a lot to do with it. Although I did drain the beef, it sure seemed greasy. Not sure if I'll make a second attempt.

This was a great recipe! I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I had to improvise a bit. I used cream cheese instead of sour cream, a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of regular mushroom, and extra beef broth to get the consistency right and balance out the stronger flavor of the cream cheese. Also, I used all low-fat versions of all the ingredients and whole wheat noodles. This recipe turned out great, and I will definitely make it again for a quick I-don't-have-time-to-go-to-the-grocery-store meal!

This dish is very easy, filling, and tastes very good. I omitted the onion (didn't have any), mushrooms, and beef broth. I increased the sour cream to 3/4 c. and decreased the mayo to 1/4 c. I used ground turkey, instead of beef, and added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. Once I had the meat mixed with the other ingredients, I added Worcestershire sauce, a little basil, and pepper to taste. Next time I may add little beef broth to enhance the flavors even more. This is a really good dish!!!

After reading some reviews, I planned to add some things to this from the start. Well, even with some sprucing up with minced garlic (in addition to garlic powder), parsley flakes, worcestshire sauce, and a can of cream of mushroom soup, this was just okay to me and my family. It just seemed to be lacking something. Really wanted to like this alot just because it was so easy to put together and would make for a good quick dinner.

Good Recipe but I defnately had to change it a little bit. I used less mayo than called for, but quite a bit more sour cream. It was also a lot more thin than i Like my stroganoff sauce so I added half of a can of ready-to-eat cream of mushroom soup. It was kind of bland so I added extra garlic powder & dry mustard & also added paprika, salt & pepper. Added celery for an extra crunch. With the changes, it was delicious!!

Made this the other night and will not be making it again. Anyone that likes the rich sour cream flavor that makes stroganoff will not like this. The mayo kills the flavor. I even tried adding another cup of sour cream but couldn't get rid of the mayo taste.

This does not pretend to be real beef stroganoff.  It's great for what it is--easy and tasty.  I did brown a couple of tbs of flour with the meat to insure a thicker sauce and it worked great.  Also used dehydrated onion as I was out of fresh.  Will be making again.   Forgot to mention that I omitted the mayo.

Surprise, it is very good with just 3 additions.  When sauteing onions I added one crushed clove of garlic (and the garlic powder too).At the end it needs a bit of salt and a splash of worstechire (sp?).  Looks like dog food, but with some bright veggies on the plate its not too bad.

Very interesting taste.  I did add cream of mushroom soup and Worcestershire sauce (1T).   The guys loved it, but I thought that the mayo was a little over powering in taste.  Will make again for the boys but will stick to classic stroganoff for me.

This recipe was very bland and too thin. I don't think I would even use this as a base recipe.I was looking for something quick and easy for dinner. A few hours after I served this we were all eating sandwiches because no one had eaten dinner. It didn't go over well. You would be better off add ground beef to cream of mushroom soup with some spices and it would be better.

Just not that good. The 3 star is that it is a good, starter recipe. Not 5 star because there is such a lack of flavor! Again, as a starter recipe this is good. If you want a flavor to your meal then you need to season, season, season! Also, you need to find a thickening agent (flour, cornstarch, etc...) because this has a difficult time thickening on it's own.  I will make it again with a major overhaul.

We thought this recipe was a keeper. Took the suggestions of 'SNUGLBUGLS' (rinsing the beef after it's browned to reduce grease then browning the onions and peppers separately). Replaced the mushrooms(hubbie doesn't like) with green pepper. Increased the garlic and onion powder and added 1T worcester sauce, then decreased the mayo tp 1/4 cup and increased the sour cream to 3/4 cup. Very tasty and will definitely make again!

I don't want to be unfair;   maybe I will try this again.  The mayo was overpowering.  I didn't read the other reviews first that said to ditch it.  I also added worcestershire that seemed to help some.  My son nor husband cared for it either....and my husband is usually game for anything.  Sorry.

Too much pasta and not enough sauce. Beef stroganoff was not meant to be made with ground beef. Next time do it right and use the good ingredients.

I don't think this should be called Beef Stroganoff. The mayonaise gave it a really strange flavor.  I tried the other suggestions with Worchestire sauce and parsley but it still had an odd taste.  Sorry but I wouldn't recommend this with any adjustments.

It was a great starter recipe but way to bland. I only took a little bit of the mayo and more sour creme. It still didn't seem very saucy so I added some milk and potato starch. You really have to spice it up a bit with salt, pepper, horseradish, mustard and some worchestershire sauce but I usually do that anyway.

This recipe was really good.  I used more (fat-free) sour cream and only 1/4 cup of mayonnaise because we're not huge fans and prefer lower fat.  Also, I used plain yellow mustard instead of mustard powder (didn't have any) and no mushrooms.  My boyfriend is a very picky eater, but we both loved it!

I tried this recipe last night and I have to say that it is a good “starter” recipe for basic Beef Stroganoff.  I read all the feedbacks and comments so I was prepared to use additional ingredients.  I started with a can of the cream of mushroom condensed soup, fresh garlic instead of ground, increased the mustard powder, and added some salt & pepper to taste along with the other items that is listed.  To quote my husband, “it looks a bit rough, but it tastes good” and to me, that is what counts!

No complaints here.  I made the recipe as directed and it was as easy as it was tasty.  
One thing I wanted to mention.  The shopping list calls for mustard seed, not ground mustard (which I already had).  I didn't think it needed mustard seed but picked it up just to be on the safe side.  Figures.
One more small note -16 ounces of noodles is way too much.  One 8 oz bag would have been more than enough to serve 4 healthy appetites.

When I made this recipe, the mayonaise seemed to seperate into little "clumps" and quite a bit of grease came to the top, even though I had strained the beef after cooking.  After spooning out the extra grease and adding some cream of mushroom soup, more garlic powder, salt, and pepper, my family seemed to like it.  Thanks!

No leftovers at all. I added worcestershire sauce, and de-alcoholized sherry (about a tsp ea.) My onions were chopped scallions. Otherwise, all was as instructed. Lovely, and a relief to find such a fast and delicious recipe during the busy days before Christmas.

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish very much.  The only reason I gave it a four out of five is because I think that it isn't creamy enough, my family likes things a little creamier.  But this was very quik and simple.  I enjoyed it greatly.

My husband thought this was quite tasty. We did make a few changes- I opted for 1 package of fresh mushrooms rather than canned, I also added black perrper and salt. Also I used minced garlic rather than garlic powder. On my end, I do think it needed a lil something.. maybe very thin strips of green bell pepper and a shot of red wine? I will be tweaking it further next time I make it.

i agree with previous reviewers that does need more spices depending on your taste and also agree with snuglbugls that i don't think the cook meant for this to be gourmet food, it is an easy, filling meal for a busy weeknight.

This recipe required some tweaking with proportions for my taste (I used less meat and noodles, actually macaroni; but more sour cream and mayonnaise, and garlic).  My family really liked it!

My family agreed this was a 3 star recipe on taste, however, I definately give it 5 stars on ease and economy, so we'll settle in the middle with 4 stars.  For our family, I skipped the mushrooms since we don't care for them, and used the refigerated minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I will probably make this dish again and again, it was just so easy, warm, & filling for this cool autumn evening, however, next time I think I will try Miracle Whip instead of mayo, to give it a more zip.

I doubled the sour cream (fat free no less) and beef broth and threw in a splash of red wine (Merlot) and it was absolutely great. I even used left over meatloaf and it went over like a winning lottery ticket!

I am a great lover of Beef Stroganoff, and this is one of the worst recipes I've ever tasted.  I tastes nothing like the traditional beef stroganoff.  The sauce is way too thin and there is not enough seasoning...it is very bland tasting.  Any other time I have had beef stroganoff it has had a rich flavorful sourcream and mushroom tasting sauce. I've gotten better results from lipton's box brand. Unfortunantly they don't make it anymore.- Shamekia

This is a really great tasting and quick recipe. My toddler really liked the sauce spooned over the egg noodles. I served it with glazed carrots. The whole meal took 30 minutes from start to finish! I added extra sour cream because I like that flavor, and just a little milk the next day to heat the leftovers. Really a good one for busy working moms!

I am sorry to say, I did not like it at all. It comes out as white, pasty groundbeef mixture. In order to get any taste established, I had to add flour mixed w. water, a can of mushroom soup as well as spices. None of those where in the recipe.

If it is to watery.Something is wrong.
I use a good quality cream of mushroom soup, undiluted.
If using 90 % hamburg, do not drain. Use plenty of sour cream.
Taste first, all ways.

I really liked this recipe.  My husband voted to have it again, as did I.  It was extreamly simple to make and very tasty.  I made about 1/3 of the noodles though, which was more then enough to serve the two of us.  I assume kids would like it, I don't know I don't have any, nor want them.  It's funny how this recipe review form assumes that everyone has kids. It probably should be an optional category to rate,but it isn't. Thus, I said it was kid friendly.

Can premake everything up to adding the creamy mixture then heat up while boiling noodles. A plus while attending to kids.

I didn't think I would like the mayo, but I always try to be true to the recipe first time around. It was good! I did use 8 oz fresh mushrooms as that's what I had on hand (cooked with the beef). Next time, I'll use 3/4 c sour cream with 1/4 c mayo.

Beef Stroganoff is my husband's favorite so I figured I'd try this since it's quicker and easier. 
It's not horrible, it's pretty good. Has that same tangy kick as the regular recipe.  But honestly it's just not the same. I wouldn't call it stroganoff.

Ive made a lot of different styles of this dish. I wish it would have said boil your noodles #2 instruction and then go on instead of it being at the end. Next time im going to increase the broth,sour cream and mayo and add the noodles in raw. That way the noodles taste way better from absorbing the broth. Otherwise my boys liked it.

Made this on a night when I had some ground meat to use and didn't want to make the same old tacos. It was quick and easy and even my picky younger child liked it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I think it would have benefited from some type of vegetable added to lighten it up a bit.

My family really likes this.  I made it dairy free by using plain dairy free yogurt instead of the sour cream and you couldn't tell the difference.  Easy too - didn't add the onion and it still had great flavor.

Very easy but needs more seasoning beyond what is called for. It's good when you only have ground beef available.

They let towards the end is to not over heat once you add the days (sour cream & mayo mixture) then it won't be watery. Also once you add it, don't over stir it where you break up the fats. I added more sour cream and dry mustard to taste. Also carmalized onions first before adding beef. but that's just personal preference. Husband approved! Less one star cause I still think there's an ingredient missing that could give it that extra oumf, but not sure what that is.

My whole family really liked this recipe. I had all the ingredients on hand, it was easy and quick. Next time I will double the sour cream/mayo/beef broth because it was really good and would have made it creamier. Great dish tho! Will make it again.

It was pretty good and very quick to make for dinner.  Didn't care for the mayonnaise taste so I will use more sour cream, maybe add sweet cream also.  And it needs a little bit of a bite, maybe a little balsamic vinegar.

Such a nice change of pace!  Easily made beside tacos or other hamburger based meals for those wanting something different. I used less mayo like someone suggested and added Worcester’s sauce. I will certainly make again. My husband loved it. I used sweet onions.

The only change I made was adding some (very little) Worcestershire sauce.  It was ok.  My daughter liked it, so that is a big bonus for me because she is a picky eater, but my husband didn't, and I just found it to be a bit bland.  I think next time I will use all sour cream instead of sour cream and mayo, and I will add more seasonings and Worcestershire sauce.  It just needed a zing added to it.  Good base though and since my daughter ate it I can't say it was something I wouldn't make again.

I hadn’t ever made beef stroganoff. At the request of my darling hubby I searched All Recipes and found this simple BUT delicious recipe.  I followed it pretty much to a T with the exception of the beef, We had some left over chunks of beef off of a beef filet we purchased in bulk with the thought of making stew.  I floured the beef with coconut flour and browned the chunks in avacado oil, used a full container or sour cream & added a little worstershire sauce.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  Thank you to the original chef who posted this recipe...it will be a go to in the future.

follow the recipe but once it's done, gets to be oily, probably from the mayo or sour cream all together with the beef fat, although I use 88% ground beef

Amazing! Super filling and savory, and goes great with any kind of pasta or rice. The only change we make is browning the beef with extra onion and garlic powder, dried chives, dried parsley, pepper, and beef bouillon. We also drain the fat from the beef after it's browned instead of incorporating it in the sauce.

I love Beef Stroganoff! I thought this recipe was perfect because I had some ground beef to use up. I read reviews on it, like I always do on this site. I added Worcestershire to the beef, used fresh garlic, sautéed onion & fresh mushrooms separately first in butter, used 3/4 sour cream & 1/4 mayo. Added pepper to the beef mixture at the end. I kept staring at my cream of mushroom can, but I didn’t use it. It tastes great, but it can use a little more thickness. I’ll make it again using the mushroom soup.  I let my husband add his own salt when served because I don’t cook with salt. Long story short- we devoured it as is!!

Followed this recipe to the letter. It is merely a glorified, scratch version of Hamburger Helper. It was very bland per the recipe so I followed the advice of another commenter who said to add a dash of Worcester sauce so I did. That didn’t help. I added cream cheese, cheddar cheese...additional seasoning to try and bump the flavor. No dice. Mayo is not right for this recipe. I drained the meat in a colander and still extracted nearly a full coffee cup worth of additional fat after adding in the wet ingredients. I was embarrassed to serve this to my family who graciously ate one serving. Never again.

Cut mayo to 1/4 cup and increased sour cream to 3/4 cup, sautéed fresh mushrooms with the onion separately, then added the beef after draining it, also added Worcestershire sauce to cooking beef... next time would cut back a bit on the mustard.... overall delicious

I was disappointed in this recipe. Too bland for us. I added sliced mushrooms and topped with paprika and sliced chives for color. If you are a meat and onions kind of person you will like this.   It is a quick & easy dish if that is what you are looking for.

I made all of the modifications suggested by other posters.  The recipe came out so bland that we didn’t want to eat the leftovers. I am not sure what else the recipe needed to make it taste it good.

I made so many changes to this I almost didn't want to rate it; but it was really good.  I love the simplicity of the recipe - you can add whatever you like to it; I added one can cream of mushroom and cut out the milk.  I also sauteed garlic and onions with the beef and added a lot of seasonings.  Thank you for this recipe; i will definitely make again, and this time will add more sour cream, or maybe some cream cheese.

When they go back for seconds you know that it worked, and that's what happened to me.  There is a lot of commentary that involves tweaks to this basic recipe and that's helpful I think, but we made the stroganoff as written, period, and it was tasty.

I served this on ziti that I had in the fridge instead of egg noodles because we have an egg allergy in the family: it is what it is for that ingredient.  I cooked the ziti soft.

This recipe gets you a quick and easy dinner that's filling.  I took a star away because the sauce came out a bit thin.  Next time I will just thicken it with some corn starch.

Hideous.  This recipe is hideous.  I was in a hurry and I didn't want to take my usual time in  preparing dinner so I found this one.  You can make quick and easy, but you can't make quick, easy and good with this recipe.

I read the reviews and made the changes that many have recommended. More sour cream, less mayo,  more garlic and onion, cream of mushroom soup and salt and pepper. Everyone enjoyed it.

Why anyone would spoil this by adding in a can of cream of soup with all its preservatives, namely MSG, is beyond me. If you feel it's "lacking", use spices, add more garlic, salt, pepper etc. I found as written, yes, a little lacking. I doubled it the next time, using fresh minced garlic, carmelizing my onions, salt and peppering them as they went into my pan, then adding in the minced garlic, about 6 cloves, in the last few seconds before I added the hamburger. I used a 16 ounce container of sour cream and half cup of Hellmans. I did use beef stock instead and to thicken it up slightly, I used 2 TBSP in 1/3 C milk. I also added about a TBSP or so of Worcestershire sauce to it. This is delicious!

This is a very easy recipe and can be on the table in 30 minutes from unloading the groceries to serving, no problem.  The stroganoff was a nice, saucy texture, but it was a bit bland.  We had to add a healthy dose of black pepper and will use fresh garlic instead of powder next time.  We also plan on using fresh mushrooms (baby portobellos) instead of canned on try #2.  All in all, though, a good school-night meal.

This is a nice base.  I omitted mayo, added more sour cream and garlic powder than suggested.  Also added salt, pepper, dried parsley, Worcestershire sauce, a little heavy cream and a tad of flour to thicken the sauce.  Nothing fancy, but it's a nice hearty meal that the  family seemed to enjoy.

Delish!! Read some of the reviewers first and followed their suggestions. 
1. Used 3/4 sour cream 
2. Used 1/4 mayonnaise 
3. Used a splash of Worcestershire sauce 
4. Didn't have mustard powder, so I used yellow mustard instead. Put in a little more than called for 
5. Added a little more garlic powder than called for as well
6. Used a can of cream mushroom instead

This is a good recipe with adjustments based on your personal tastes. I omit the mayo, double the sour cream and mushrooms, and add about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. I omit the mayo because I just didn't like it with that added (nothing against mayo; I just don't care for it in this recipe).

I made this but made it different.  I started w/ the ground beef, onions and mushrooms in a pot.   Browned almost all the way thru.  Added 2 tablespoons of flour,  One or two beef bouillon cubes, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper.    Stirred until everything coated  then added 1-1/2 cups warm water.    cooked noodles according to package directions.   Beef was thickened now.  Added Worcestershire sauce to taste.    Added some extra pre-mixed corn starch to thicken a bit more.   Drained noodles.  Served beef mixture over noodles with a dollop of sour cream on top.   So, kinda the same but not the same. ;)

So impressed with this recipe. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and cut back the mayo to 1/4 cup and upped the sour cream (I used plain Greek yogurt) to 3/4 cup. As a beginner, this recipe was so easy and so good. Thank you for sharing!

Despite some negative reviews, my family LOVES this!  A few changes... use fresh (pre-sautéed) mushrooms, use 1 whole teaspoon of garlic powder, add 7 splashes of Worchestershire sauce and reduce the mayo by a bit.  Served over cauliflower rice or pasta makes it awesome!

I LOVED this with these little adjustments:  No mushrooms, but did add a can of cream of mushroom soup (condensed, didn't add any water).  Omitted the mayo, upped the sour cream to about 3/4 c, and used a generous 1/2 c of beef broth.  Didn't have any mustard powder on hand, so I just tossed in a few red pepper flakes just for a little something extra.  I was so sad when I ate the last of my leftovers!  Definitely will make again!

My family loved it! I loved that it was quick and easy. We are on a special diet so I had to improvise, used plain greek yogurt and a canola mayo. Also, used soy sauce with a half cup water to replace the broth. I may have added a little more salt and pepper, and a little parsley. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this dish. I modified and added chile powder Liptons onion mix and extra seasonings to the ground turkey. Used fresh mushroom and add or decrease liquid depending on the consistency you like. Best part is that is was done in 30 min.

Tried this recipe this evening.  Easy, flavorful, and delicious.  My changes to this recipe:  I added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce just a tad, and I used fresh mushrooms and garlic.  I omitted the mustard as my husband is allergic to it.

My kids loved this and want me to keep this on the regular meal menu.  My issue is that it is VERY bland.  It needs some flavor.  I added extra garlic and Worchester sauce, chives, parsley.  I will still work on the flavor a bit more till I get it to my taste buds!!!!!

I've tried this recipe twice to date.  First time as written, the second replacing the mayo with sour cream.  I much prefer it with the sour cream (but then I am not a big mayo fan).  Virginia

Very tasty! A great quick dinner idea. Will definitely make it again. Only change I made was omitting the mustard powder because I didn't have any on hand. I did find it a little on the heavy side but otherwise delicious!

I made this exactly as written, except I left out the mushrooms and I added salt and pepper. I mixed the sauce right into the cooked noodles and told my kids it was homemade hamburger helper. They gobbled it up! Next time I will add more sour cream, as the creaminess was gone after mixing with the noodles.

I like to make this often when I can't decide what else to do with the ground beef. Sometimes I use fresh mushrooms in stead of canned if I have them on hand. Great easy recipe.

I followed the advice of another reviewer, using 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, and 3/4 cup of low fat sour cream and 1/4 cup of mayo for 1 recipe. Also used 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms, and increased the garlic powder by half. Once cooked, it needed to be thickened with corn starch because it was a bit soupy. That said, the only thing it needed, once on the plate, perhaps, was some pepper. This has no really strong flavours, so it would probably appeal to kids too. I did double everything and it still turned out great.

This was very good - but I was happy that I took the advice of others and put 3/4 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup of mayonnaise.  I actually used Miracle Whip and as another reviewer stated, it was a bit tangy, so I may put less next time.  We also sprinkled some shredded cheese on top and it added just a little something extra... Very tasty!

A pretty good basic recipe. I could taste a little bit more sour cream than I expected but it was still enjoyable. After tasting it I added some Parmesan cheese to cover the sour cream taste and that made it a lot yummier in my opinion but less...stroganoffy? I think I'll make this again. With a little doctoring up I'm sure it could be 5 stars.

I would give it 5 stars with an added can of cream of mushroom soup as others suggested. I made it with light sour cream and mayo and fat free cream of mushroom soup and it was still really rich.

An alright meal, but a little on the bland side.

We did not care for this.  I used fresh garlic instead of powder when browning the meat, cut down the mayo, added the cream of mushroom soup and increased the sour cream like the one review.

This turned out much better than I expected. Everyone in the house liked it, which is hard to do with 4 kids. I did have to make a sub. I thought I had sour cream but I was out. I used 1/2 c heavy whipping cream and added a bit of corn starch to thicken it up at the end. Salt and Pepper to taste was all that was needed. Turned out good. Thanks.

Hey, it's quick, cheap and easy.  And on top of that, it's yummy!  An excellent weeknight meal.  I imagine this would freeze really well too.  So you could make it up, and freeze half, then you have it for another night when you don't want to cook!

We really didn't like this recipe. I made it as-is and the end result was fatty and salty yet bland - it needs more something, and something other than a store-bought jar of gravy.

Great recipe for a quick meal.  I added salt/pepper, 1 extra can of mushrooms, 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg and 1 tbsp brown gravy mix to thicken it a little.  Delicious!!

I've made a couple of the Beef Stroganoff recipes on this site. This one is my and my husbands favorite! My husband doesnt really like onions so i used onion powder instead. I also added more beef broth and just let it simmer and reduce down some. I am adding this to the "make on a regular basis" list!

not bad.  i used fresh mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup instead of beef broth. i also didn't have any mustard powder. maybe that was the problem.  it was lacking in flavor. great starting point though. i'll play around with seasonings when i make it again.

Fast and easy. I used fresh mushrooms and mixed the noodles in with the meat mixture at the end. Easier to make than packaged mixes like Hamburger Helper.

Great for how easy it is. Not the best I ever had, but it was the best I ever had that I made in 30 mins with stuff I already had in my kitchen. My wife is out of town and I will have this ready and waiting on her when she get home. Great recipe.

This made for a nice, easy supper for a picky eater (by not using the mushrooms). The taste had a little more mayonnaise than we would like. Not bad.

So fast and easy, tastes great.  Use reduced fat or fat free sour cream, 93% lean meat, and lower sodium beef broth and it turns out great.

I loved this recipe. I made it as is and put it over rice. I didn't have mushrooms, but next time I will make sure I have mushrooms I think it would totally make this a 6 starrrrer...And a little salt and pepper was needed.
3/1/10- My boyfriend made this for me b/c he like it so much last time, however he tried doubling it and it was not as good as it was the first time. It was really bland with no taste, it was made as is with the only change being fresh mushrooms and being doubled. It was edible, but not memorable.

Decent stroganoff. As one reviewer mentioned, I added Worcestershire sauce, added some kick.   I'd make it again for a quick fast dinner that was good.

My preference is stroganoff made with strips of lean beef, but all I had on hand was lean ground beef. This recipe turned out texturally good, but I found the flavor lacking. My modifications: I substituted 1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms, adding it with the onion. I also doubled the garlic powder and mustard and made the sauce with 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayonnaise. I found those proportions created a lighter sauce, which I wanted at the time.

This is really a good mince beef stroganoff... I sauted my mushrooms,garlic (fresh) and onions separatly from the mince then added it all together. Also, I used a bit of mushroom soup powder to do the thickening for me as I also found it wasn't quite the "right" consistency. Another useful hint, I think, is to reserve the tinned mushroom juices and use that in conjunction with the stock... Though to be honest I'm not sure how much flavour that added. Just that I hate to throw anything away. All in all I simple, easy and time efficient recipe!

Very delicious,  even my daughters who are somewhat picky liked it though as I'm the only one in my family who likes mushrooms I'll probably leave them out next time.  Also I think the recipe could use a little more meat for the amount of sauce so next time I'll use 1 1/2 lbs ground beef.  Thanks Linda for a really great easy to make dish that's perfect for busy evenings

I prepared this as written, tasted it, and did not care for it. Definitley too much mayo. I also added about 7 or 8 "glugs" from a bottle of worchestershire sauce--I have never heard of a stroganoff without it.  Also added a splash of soy sauce, which gave it more flavor and acted as a salty seasoning. I also added ground pepper. It was farily good after that, but my son didn't like it. Probably not a keeper for us, even with the modifications.

I remember this recipe from the days when the answer to "What's for dinner?"  was  "something out of ground beef".  It was a hit then and still is a family favorite.

Good basic recipe. I followed some of the other recommendations and added 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can mushrooms, added salt and pepper, reduced the amount of mayo and sour cream and used a little cornstarch to thicken it up. Cam out GREAT! Will definitely use in the future!

Very tasty and easy to make for those of us "less experienced" cooks! I'm not much of a mushroom fan so I'm going to play with the recipe a bit next time but as is, this is pretty good!

My son didn't eat any of it because it had mayonnaise. I didn't tell him, but he could taste it. I was very disappointed about that. I think it would be better without the mayo.

Can the powdered garlic and mustard be substituted for the real thing?  I'd rather add garlic and mustard itself, as opposed to the powder.

As is it only gets a 3 from me. Since previous posters thought it too thin and bland I made it with mushroom gravy instead of beef broth from the get go. I also did not think meat in a "hot cream of mayo sauce" sounded appealing so I sbusituted 1 c of sour cream for a 1/2 SC and 1/2 mayo. The rest I made as listed and tested. It was still bland. I added a bullion cube for more beef flavor....let that dissolve in there for a bit and tasted. Better, but still not enough. I added 1 tsp. of Worchestershire sauce. Now it has some flavor. The sauce was a little thin initially but by the time it got poured over the noodles and sat a little bit the noodles did take up the extra liquid so that was not really a problem. Hubby did really like it in the end...but it had a lot of stuff added to it too.

Very good taste... I did change it a little... I added fresh mushrooms and a can of mushroom soup. Instead of egg noodle I stuff bolios (bread) and made stroganoff boats.

This was ok. It tasted ok. My boys like Stroganoff but I had a hard time getting them to eat this recipe. It's a great starter recipe. I would use less mayo.  Thanks for Sharing!

The flavor of this was excellent (the only additional seasoning I added was a few shakes of worcestershire sauce).  But I (like other reviewers) had the experience of the end product being too greasy for my preferences-so for that reason will probably not follow this recipe again but will go back to stroganoff thickened with flour instead of the mayo ingredient.

Made sure the beef was drained thoroughly and it was just fine. Used fat-free Miracle Whip which made it healthier, but surprisingly sweet. Next time I'll use MW low-fat instead of no-fat. I think it would be a good place to hide bell peppers or other veggies that need using.

Overall good recipe.  I'm not sure the mayo has any redeeming value in this.  I halved the mayo and used more sour cream and it still had a hint of mayo flavor that just didn't seem to fit.  Next time I'll use more sour cream and maybe just a tablespoon of the mayo or skip it all together.  Thanks for the recipe.

Quick and Easy, a bit too bland and tangy for what I would consider Stroganoff, but definately passable for a meal in a pinch.

I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I substituted cream cheese that we had in the refrigerator, and it was delicious. The only thing I might change is to add a little milk or half and half to the sauce because it was quite thick (and I usually prefer thicker sauce). Maybe it wouldn't be so thick if one used sour cream, as called for in the recipe. My wife and I both enjoyed this recipe.

I was looking for a quick meal and thought that we would try this based on other reviews. I was disappointed because it was extremely bland. To make it more flavorful, I tried adding more spices (garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder, paprika, worcestershire sauce, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper) and nothing I seemed to try worked. In the end,  I ate 3 bites,  my husband called it "just substance" and one of my three daughters call it "yucky".  Now, on the bright side the other two girls seemed to like it and that is why I rated it two stars instead of one. I am sure that this is a good recipe for someone else,  it just did not work for me.

I sought out this recipe to replace my old one that used Cream of Mushroom soup since Cream of mushroom soups usually has MSG in it (Campbells does) So I needed a recipe that did not have the soup in it. This was very good. We had a bunch of left over pasta though I will not fix as much noodles next time.

I made several changes b/c the original recipe seemed to be lacking a lot of flavour.  Like another poster, I added 3 tbsp of horseradish and 1 tsp of dry mustard.  This gave the dish some kick.  My DH and my 3 picky kids loved it.  Will make it this way again.

This recipe was easy and tasty.  I wasn't wowed by it, but my husband really liked it.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and increased the sour cream and decreased the mayo and I seriously cannot imagine it with more mayo.  I also felt that the sauce was too watery.  Next time I might decrease the broth.  Overall, it was not amazing, but a good change of pace and something different to do with ground beef.

We thought this was a very good recipe!  Nothing fancy, but it's not supposed to be.  I added more Sour Cream to thicken.

I think this deserves 3 1/2 stars, really, for being economical, quick and satisfying. Based on other reviews I added some worcestershire, bit of salt and pepper, plus a little more onion than called for, and used low-sodium broth. Next time I make it, I will probably go with 3/4 cup sour cream and just a 1/4 cup of the mayo, 'cause the mayo taste was a little much for me.  Not overpowering, however, and "The Hubbs" liked it a lot (which is always good for some bonus points in my book!  :-)   ) Thanks!

I modified it just a little bit. I didn't have mustard powder, so I just used a bit of the horseradish dijon musstard that I had in the fridge. And I didn't have any beef broth, so I added a bit of water. It turned out great!!

Nice, quick dish.  I uses fresh garlic, sauteed with the onion.  Also subbed low fat cream cheese for the mayo, just personal preference.  Added a little grill seasoning and worcheshire to up the seasonings.  Will make again.

This was a good recipe.  Wish I would have read reviews before making as it needed more "spice" for my family.  Other than that, it was ggod.

I was going to make stroganoff hamberger helper when I found this recipe. I'm happy I found it, it's really good.  I made a few changes added salt,pepper and worcestershire to the ground beef.

enjoyable meal.  I may have put too much sour cream because it was a bit on the sour side.  Many mentioned the bland taste. I dont think bland is the word. There is flavor but still missing the last kick.  I think next time I try this i will use extra garlic and onion and add some dry herbs to complement the dish. All in all it was worth the effort.  I made it with mashed potatoes.

This was a very easy dish to make and I also cooked the onion and mushrooms in butter separately before adding them to the ground beef.I also used pasta shells for a change of pace.My wife and I loved it and I thouroughly recommend it.

My husband and I have very different ideas of what beef stroganoff should be, and this one pleases both of us.  In addition, it is very easy and quick to make!  The only change I make is to add a small can of mushrooms, use 3/4 pound of ground beef instead of 1 pound (to make it slightly soupier) and halve the amount of noodles.

This was a nice and easy comfort dish.  I thought it was thick enough and actually added more beef broth.  I also added a touch of Worcestershire sauce. And I served it over white rice instead of noodles.  My 7 year old said it is his new favorite dish!  Good enough for me!

Excellent recipe, although I had to omit the mushrooms, due to a mushroom picky hubby, my family loved it, and even my picky child ate it! Thank you for sharing!
