I was afraid to try this recipe, since I've never had fennel, and always assumed I wouldn't care for it, since I *hate* the flavor of licorice. But after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a shot. Even as I was preparing it, I was skeptical, smelling the strong licorice scent coming from the fennel bulbs as I chopped them. I shouldn't have doubted the allrecipes reviewers so much! The finished product was sweet and almost nutty, creamy and delicious, and didn't taste even the tiniest bit like licorice. A perfect side dish, and a whole new veggie to add to the repetoire! Thanks so much for changing my mind. Also, thanks for the prep instructions for fennel-novices like me - made it easy to work with like I'd done it a million times.

This is a great fennel dish but as usual I put my own touches to it. Only one fennel bulb so I sliced a few small red potatoes into it and added a small sliced onion. Used sour cream instead of creme fraiche and salt and fresh groung black pepper . DELISH!! Everyone raved and had seconds.

I was very skeptical about making this - I don't much care for fennel's licorice taste - but this turned out pretty good. The fennel flavor was very mild, and complimented the Parmesan nicely. Oh, I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche. Thanks!

Love fennel, both raw and cooked, and like it baked with Parmesan too. I won't be making this particular fennel recipe again, however, as it just was nothing special at all except for it being fennel in a lot of cream. Boring dish.

I made this using yogurt instead of creme fraiche as creme fraiche is hard to find in Aussie supermarkets.  I sorta guessed the other quantities but whatever I did it turned out really yummy.

An impressive dish!

This dish was really great!  I was nervous because I don't like the taste of raw fennel, but when cooked it loses that harsh licorice flavor and tastes wonderful.  I did add one cup of creme fraiche and I know I added about a 1/2 cup of cheese. I have also used sour cream instead of creme fraiche and it works just as well.  Great dish, I'm really glad I tried it!

Here's a less fatty alternative: I used a 2" slice of block cream cheese melted into 1/2 cup of fat-free sour cream, and topped it with Parmesan. That is much less sauce than this recipe says, but OOH yummy!  I will be making this again and again :)

Not quite sure what I did wrong.  I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche as others had and baked as instructed.  All the fats separated during baking and the end results look like curdled cheese.  It didn't look or taste appetizing.

I recently moved to Italy where Fennel is in abundance.  Wanting to try it this sounded good.  It was excellent.  I only made some minor changes.  I sauteed the fennel in olive oil instead of butter.  Added salt and pepper and instead of cream fraiche and half & half I used a new product (Philadelphia cooking cream) the entire container.  I also added panko bread crumbs on the top with the parmesan cheese.  I baked it all in my skillet since it can go from stove to oven. Why dirty another dish?

I was a little disappointed with this.  It was bland, a little dry, and visually unappealing.  I increased the creme fraiche/ heavy cream slightly and added spinach for what I hoped would be additional flavor.  The creme fraiche/ cream slightly curdled and got dry with open baking in the oven, and I can't imagine that this was the original intent.  I feel like this was somewhat of a waste of good produce.

I was part of a CSA & received a bunch of fennel but had no idea what to do with it. I made this recipe for a dinner night with friends and everyone was so impressed by how good it was. If I ever end up with that much fennel again I'd definitely make it again!

I didn't have enough fennel so I added a leek and some chopped fresh herbs: tarragon, parsley, and chives. I also used a mixture of vegan sour cream and cream cheese, with vegan parmesan and some herb bread crumbs on top. It was excellent, I will definitely make it again.

It's always exciting to have a somewhat underappreciated vegetable for dinner- not just your avereage brocolli. And I was impressed that cooking the fennel this way made it taste so mellow and sweet. However, this recipe definitely needs some more salt and more flavor. With all the fat, I just can't justify eating this unless it's completely fabulous, and it falls remarkably short of that.

This is a really good side dish. I've made this recipe a lot since trying it the first time. I noticed that it tastes a lot better if you use organic (or home grown) fennel instead of non-organic, store bought fennel. The dish I made with the non-organic fennel didn't have hardly any flavour and just tasted like the cream sauce. With organic fennel this dish has a really nice, nutty (typical fennel) flavour.

I just finished eating and felt compelled to make a review.  I loved it!  I didn't taste the 'licorice' but my husband said he could...he hates fennel and still loved it.  I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche.  I'd change one thing: mixed in some parmesan with the cream sauce not just a sprinkling on top.  I sprinkled on a little salt and pepper after it was done.  So good!

Excellent dish! Even my boyfriend, who doesn't like fennel, liked this.  I added salt and pepper and sauted the fennel longer (maybe 10 min) than stated in the recipe.  Also, the first time I made it, it curdled a bit, so the second time I omitted the half-and-half and doubled the creme fraiche (creme fraiche doesn't curdle very easily).  That was perfect.  This is economical enough because I make my own creme fraiche (recipe is on this site--it is easy but must be done a couple of days ahead).

What a fabulous recipe! Thank you so much. I swapped the creme fraiche for sour cream (only because that's what I had in the fridge). Because fennel is not a common vegie, everybody raved about it. Comments like: What is this? Fennel? LOL so funny. Thank you for a super easy, delicious side. :)

Good recipe.  We substituted Philadelphia Cooking Cream Italian Cheese & Herb for the creme fraiche.  Came out a little dry, although we cut the recipe in half.  I'd try it again.

I had never cooked fennel before and was looking for a recipe.  Smothered in cheese, I guess nothing can be too terrible.  This dish was ok - not great.  Probably won't make again

A little greasy, but no surprise there--looking at the ingredients tells you it will be.  I only had one bulb of fennel so I too used an equal amount of potatoes--it turned out to be four thinly sliced potatoes since I have very small red ones.  When I went to add the parmesan, I discovered I didn't have any, so I subbed seasoned boursin cheese for the topping.  The cheese gave it an extra flair and flavor actually, so a happy accident.  Bf doesn't like fennel so I only made this for myself and won't be making it much because of that, but I do like this.  It is also a bit rich so definitely a very occasional, but rich side dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy and delicious!  I added some chopped fresh garlic to the fennel while it was being sauteed.  I also found it easier to core the fennel buy cutting the bulb in half first.  Great side dish!

I serve this to guests (most of whom never had tried fennel in their lives) and it was well received.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a considerable amount of coarse kosher salt.  I can't imagine how this would have tasted without it!  Salt is a critical addition to this dish.

I love this recipe!  I served this for a mixed crowd including kids and some picky adults and everybody raved about it.  Will make again for sure.  It had a fettucini alfredo taste without the carbs from the pasta.

I made this because I love raw fennel and was curious how cooked fennel would taste. I was pleasantly surprised at the flavoe-was kind of sweet and had great flavor! Simple recipe plus minimal ingredients equals success!

This was a great vegetable dish!  I used milk in place of half-and-half and yogurt in place of the creme fraiche, mixing the milk and yogurt into a slurry before adding them to the pan, and it tasted great!  I also added some pepper.  Minced garlic might be a good addition too.  Good stuff; my husband thought it was artichoke hearts in cream sauce at first - very mild flavor.  Next time I would cut the fennel into smaller pieces to make it easier to eat.

This was my first attempt at cooking with fennel and what a great recipe to start with.   I didn't have any creme fraiche so I added a little sour cream and it was still great!

I enjoy fennel but I wanted to try a new recipe. This was pretty good but I did add some dried onion and fresh black pepper. Creme fraiche was not available so I used greek yogurt. Maybe a little more parm next time. Thanks.

Great recipe, but it turns out we are not huge fennel fans. Actually my 5 year old daughter loved it. I'm going to try the same recipe but instead add another veggie.

The flavor was  delicious but like one of the other reviewers my half and  half mixture separated in the oven. Next time, I will turn the temp down because I think 400 degrees was too hot.

This is now a main course at our house.... so so good. Its important to let it bake slowly so the Fennel is soft but not mashed. I do not always have cream so slow cooking with parmesan is key. Delicious

Delicious!! I received some fennel in a farm box that I didn't get a chance to customize.  I was worried what to do with it since I normally don't care for the taste of it.  I researched some recipes and settled on this one.  I seasoned the fennel with a little sea salt,  mixed freshly ground pepper, and some paprika,  and cooked it in the butter until both sides were browned.  Then I added the remaining ingredients as instructed and cooked it until it had mostly conglomerated together and the top was brown and bubbly. I was a little hesitant to taste it at first,  but it smelled so good I couldn't resist. Long story short,  by the time I was ready to pack up the leftovers to put away,  I had eaten half the dish.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who either doesn't like fennel,  or is looking for something new to try. I'm confident it will not disappoint!!

Very Good!  But i did cut way back on the cream mixture.  I did need to cook the fennel longer in the saute pan because I didn't have as much sauce for it to bake in and soften up.  Also added fresh bread crumbs with the parm on top.  Everyone loved it but we are fennel fans.

I used an oven ready frypan to fry it.  When I then cooked it in the oven, 30 minutes was WAY too long.  Next time I will use the same technique but lower temp in oven or shorten oven time.

Excellent.  I used flaked parmesan which worked great.  Combination of 35% cream and whipped cream, parmesan on top.   So simple but very, very good. The liquorice flavor is very mild and the parmesan on top gives just the right texture to the whole thing.

This recipe is a staring point. However, if you choose to follow it , 400 degrees and 30 minutes might leave you with a mighty black dish. I took mine out after 20 minutes.

This was superb. I made changes suggested by another reviewer. 

I used 2 bulbs of fennel though and added 3 red potatoes cubed and half a Vidalia onion chopped. 

I sautéed the onion till golden, added cubed potatoes and sautéed it all a few minutes. Then I added the fennel to sautée five more minutes as directed.

I used 1 cup milk and 1 cup low fat sour cream instead of cream and creme fresh to lighten it a bit.

I followed the rest of the directions.  It was scrumptious.

I searched online for substitutes for creme fraiche and found that plain yogurt is recommended. I substituted plain greek yogurt, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and it made the best fennel I've ever tasted.  My husband and son liked it too.  I had 2 at the table who don't like fennel, and they didn't like this version either, but that won't stop me from making it again.   Made this again 11/5/2015, this time using sour cream and milk instead of creme f. and half&half,  and I drizzled a little maple syrup on top before roasting.  Delicious, and even better than the 1st time!  I used an oven-safe sauté pan for the frying step so did not need to transfer to another pan for roasting.  After 10 minutes the topping was brown, so I laid a piece of foil, shiny side up, on top for the remaining 20 minutes of roasting.  If I made again using very small fennel bulbs I would cut the rest of the ingredients in half.  The reduced, solid topping tasted great, but there was more than enough of it... I've said this before, but I'll say it again... a recipe is much better if it indicates more exact measurements that "2 fennel bulbs." It really should indicate the size of those bulbs too.

Enjoyed with a rib eye steak and roasted cherry tomatoes. I liked it although I did reduce the ingredients a little, more parmesan less liquid.

Fantastic recipe. I was a little hesitant because I wasn't sure how the flavors and textures would balance (especially the curdling cream)--but it turned out delicious. I now always double this recipe because everyone loves it.

Mmmm, this was my first time cooking with fennel (I like it raw) and we all enjoyed this dish. Will definitely make again.

Not bad, not the greatest. We ate our portions but didn't finish off the dish. One tip I can offer is that it took a little longer that five minutes to saute the fennel until they weren't crunchy. Baking them helped but had to bake longer to ensure what we were after.

Delicious. I had to use sour cream and heavy whipping cream, they were all I had. Tasted like it was much harder to make than it was. I think I may try a smidge of nutmeg next time. I will make again and again. Wonderful!
