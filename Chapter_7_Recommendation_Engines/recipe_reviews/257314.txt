11.9.18 I loosely followed this recipe, but well enough that I feel my review is valid.  I had five blsl thighs.  Combined 3/4c shredded mozzarella & 1/4c pesto.  I unrolled the thighs & divided the mixture on each. Then, rolled, & wrapped a piece of bacon around it like a bacon-wrapped filet, bacon touching the chicken "side," not the pesto, & secured with a toothpick.  Placed on baking dish.  Cut pieces of uncooked bacon to lay over pesto & raw chicken that was visible in an attempt to have the chicken not be dry/hard.  At that time, I realized I hadn't seasoned the chicken at all.  'Considered sprinkling with spices then, but didn't.  There really wasn't a need anyway.  The pesto & bacon seasoned it nicely.  Baked twenty minutes at 350.  To the oven, I baked white rice for thirty & had a nice dinner.  Fancy-ish, but not too timeconsuming.  Yay!  :D

I normally don't look at recipes that don't have at least 100 reviews, but I'm glad this one caught my attention. We love bacon, but I left it out figuring that the skin wouldn't get crispy. Ended up with very tasty chicken, and crispy skin. Bacon wasn't needed! Nor is any additional sauce.
I only used 1/4 of the pesto/mozzarella (total of 2 tablespoons pesto and 1 tbsp. mozzarella). I first inserted the pesto/mozzarella; try to open the pocket where a flap of skin can be tucked under the thigh. Then enlarge the pocket over the thigh leaving the rest of the skin attached to the thigh. Spread around the pesto/mozzarella, then tuck the skin flap under the thigh. 
Then I sprinkled on the seasoning, 
Yes, I'll make this again - it is terrific and easy!

This was pretty darn good :) It's a variation of one of the meals we make...a bacon wrapped chicken with cream cheese and jalapenos on the inside. I made a homemade cheesy cream sauce and poured over before placing into the oven. (You can also just add a can of cream of chicken soup and spread over the chicken.) Superb. The chicken was super moist, and the bacon chewy. Nice job! Thanks for the recipe!
