Crockpot variation: Put all ingredients into crockpot (no need to cook onions first, and oil can be omitted). Add 2 additional cups of water/broth and cook on high 2 1/2 hours (can be kept warm on low setting after that, with occasional stirring).
More flavor: Use vegetable broth instead of water. Double all spices except for salt.

This is a great recipe.  That being said, I'll mention a few things I did differntly.
First of all, I soaked the peas in water for about 8 hours prior to cooking.  I omitted the barley, and I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil.  I sauteed the onion, celery and (3) bay leaves together.  I also omitted the potatoes, and put all of the herbs in the pot with the peas and 8 c. water, rather than waiting until the peas had cooked 2 hours.  The only ingredient I added after cooking for 2 hours was the carrots.  After adding them and another cup of water, I let the soup simmer about 1 more hour.
It's really a delicious, hearty soup. I didn't find it to be too thick, possibly because I soaked the peas first.

When she says it makes a thick soup, she isn't kidding!  I love thick soup but this was ridiculously thick, too thick to be soup.  All 7 1/2 cups of the water was used up and the solid then started to burn the bottom of the pan.  I added 4 more cups of water, which turned out to be PERFECT, so I'd definitely recommend using a total of 11 1/2 cups water for anyone making this soup!  The taste was delicious, and I blended abotu half the soup for a better consistency, but either way it tastes fine, just depends on your preference.  I only used one potato cause that's all I had around the house but it was still good.  Definitely one of the best soup recipes I've tasted!  Thanks!!

Love it.  I just put all of the ingredients in the crock pot without pre-cooking anything.  I do use more water than it calls for, though.

This was, without a doubt, the best pea soup I have ever made and loaded with nutrition.  One problem - my carrots were not done and the soup was so thick that it was in jeopardy of burning.  Next time I may add them earlier or steam them separately.  And please don't leave out the barley!!  You would not want to miss that good nutrition.  I also had to add at least 4 cups extra of liquid.  I used part broth and part water. If you like pea soup, do try this good recipe.

Mmmmmm...use this recipe!!! This was my first time making split pea soup and I am glad I chose this recipe.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added a lot of extra water (about 3-5 more cups), and this soup still came out nice and thick.  Also, although this soup has a wonderful flavor when made as instructed, I am not a big fan of parsley, so next time I will not use as much.  I think I will also skip the potato next time so the split pea flavor is not compromised.  All in all, this is a GREAT recipe...just tweek it a bit here and there to make it yours.  I recommend serving split pea soup with croutons and a few (or many) splashes of red wine vinegar.

Good split pea soup recipe. I added some veggie boullion (spelling?). Very filling, sticks to your bones! Good to make in the fall/winter. I made mine in the slow cooker so while I was at work it cooked. I added a little water to it when I got home and it was smooth and yummy! I ended up freezing some since it makes a LOT. A+++

Although this is not as flavorful as pea soup made with a ham bone, it is a tasty recipe. Since so many reviewers recommended adding more water, I used 12 cups of water and doubled the spices. This worked out well. However, next time I will not add the barley. That is what thickens this soup. If you make it without the barley, it will not be so thick. If you do find it needs to be thickened when it is done, you can always add some instant mashed potatoes flakes. That will thicken it up nicely.

I love this soup! I've now made it for the second time..  Basically, I stick to the recipe.  The first time I added chopped ham and this time I put in some "fresh pork hocks."  Of course, I add extra garlic to everything.  My Husband likes thinner soup so I added extra water in the beginning and some chicken broth after I knew how thick it was.  It makes such a hearty meal with a salad and bread.  I'm sure it would be just as tasty without the meat.  I'll definitely be making this often.  Thanks for posting such a great recipe!!

Yummy split pea soup.  Add a little liquid smoke to it as there's no ham chunks in there and it's awesome!

Good!  I did not have the same problem other people had where a lot more liquid was needed, but then I did not add the barley or potatoes.  I also used homemade chicken broth instead of just water.  It did have to cook longer than 3 hours though, so I think the next time (there will be!) I will just use the slow cooker.  Lesson learned: a one pound bag of split peas = a tad bit over 2 cups...now that I know, there is no need to measure next time.

Loved this!  I threw everything in the crock pot, omitted oil, and added 2 extra cups of water and a chicken boullion cube.  Cooked on high for 4 hours, and then low for 4 more hours. It's fantastic!  I've made it once a week for the past 3 weeks, frozen some, and probably eaten a bowl at least once per day.  On Weight Watchers, 1 cup is 4 points.

Probably the best split pea soup I have ever made!  SO tasty!  I substituted vegetable broth for the water, and left out the potatoes.  I also added the carrots, celery, parsley and spices after sauteeing the onions & garlic.  It is a very thick soup, so I added water from time to time during cooking to keep it the consistency we like.  Will definitely make it again!

I made this today and it is wonderful.  I am only going to give it 4 stars because I did make a change.  I added Goya's ham flavoring which really gave it that smoky flavor but NO real ham.  I will try without next time, but this was really delicious. I am sure great both ways.

This is an outstanding soup - really delicious and healthy!  One of the best soups I have ever made.   The spicing is perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I did add some extra water, though.  I started with the 7 1/2 cups, but if it looked like it was getting really thick I added a cup of water every now and then while it was simmering.  I probably ended up using about 10 cups of water total.

So perfect for a chilly evening - thanks for this recipe!

This was absolutely delicious! Every adult in my family loved it, and went back for 3rds & 4ths. Only thing I did differently was add a little more salt to my taste, but that is a personal pref. And I did soak the peas overnight, which did shorten the cooking time. It was ready in about 2 1/2 hrs. from start to finish. I had planned to add some chopped ham to the pot after I fed lunch to my vegan son-in-law, but it was so good I didn't want to mess it up. And please ... be sure to add the barley! That is what makes this so hearty and unique. You can't taste it. It just gave the soup a nice "meaty" texture. One daughter said this was her fav dish of all that I make. That says a lot, 'cuz she likes everything I cook. Try it!! You will be glad you did!

I prepared this on the stove top as directed. I added more salt to taste and added a 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke in step 2 to get that "hammy/smokey" taste to it. I did not miss the ham bone, or the fat that comes with it. Go for it! It comes out delicious!

I cut this recipe in half because I have a smaller family.  I would recommend checking the soup from time to time to make sure there's enough liquid.  Mine ended up getting burnt on the bottom because there wasn't enough liquid.  Otherwise it was good.

I adore this soup.  I'm neither vegan or vegetarian, but this is so good.  Sometimes I use broth instead of water, sometimes I omit the celery, and I've added broccoli to it as well.  It's excellent every time!  I always have to add more liquid, as it really is very thick - more like chowder than soup.  Yum!

This soup is fantastic--delicious and very nourishing. I quick-soaked the peas (cooked them in water for 2 hours on high in my Crock Pot) and used a whole bag instead of just two cups. I also used 4 cups of vegetable stock and 3 1/2 cups of water. I omitted the barley and doubled the spices. To cut cooking time, I sauteed ALL of the vegetables together until the onions were glossy, and then added the rest of the ingredients and brought the whole thing to a boil. Then I reduced the heat, covered it, and simmered it for 90 minutes--and it was absolutely perfect. A great recipe and very versatile--thanks, Deborah!

Really good-the best I've had. It is sorta like Amy's canned split pea and California Pizza Kitchens- but way better! I didn't even miss the ham.  I only have one suggestion. Save the black pepper for right before you eat it and use 3-4 turns of freshly ground  black pepper. Also, it doesn't say to cover when simmering, but that made it super moist. I froze the remainder of mine in 2 cup servings and it heated up great. Enjoy!!

This soup is not only tasty and healthy, but it also freezes very well. I double or triple the recipe, so I have plenty to give away as a blessing to others. The versatility is also helpful as it caters to many different tastes, food allergy needs, beliefs and preferences. This recipe receives raves all around! Thank you, Deborah Sah.

I made it in the crockpot (just dumped all the ingredients at once and let it cook for 8 hours on low). Turned out great!

Absolutely delicious!  I also had to add much more water than called for (about 12 cups) so it wouldn't burn.  I added some chicken base and used a little bit less oregano and it was so filling and hearty.

Very good but as most reviewers mentioned is is THICK.  I did end up adding more liquid (2 cups I think) but could def have added some more.  I have some frozen that I plan to thaw this week and heat with some added veggie stock.  Yummy Hearty winter soup that I plan on making again.

Yum. This is a 4 and not a 5 because a couple changes had to be made. Like the other reviewers, I added about 12-13 cups of water to the pot, rather than the 7 1/2 cups. I also had to increase the salt and pepper to taste, and added a couple dashes of red chili pepper flakes. After these minor adjustments, the soup was absolutely perfect for a cool fall afternoon.

A couple of tips that might help folks, based upon what I see in the reviews:  This is an excellent recipe -- and you don't have to be vegan to love it!  Notes on prep:  Split peas, like lentils, do not need to soak overnight.  In fact, they do not need to soak at all.  Doing so will seriously affect the texture of the soup.  Carrots won't cook till soft?  Years ago I learned the trick of getting a beautiful looking pea soup -- coarsely grate the carrots.  They cook in a wink, and those little flecks of orange with the green peas make for a great presentation.  Happy cooking, and thank you Deborah Sah for a great recipe!

Tasty!  I made this in the crockpot, so added additional water.  Used chicken boullion, threw in some chardonnay, upped the garlic.  Will make again and again!  I love how filling this is whils also being truly healthy and nutritious.  A great meal for the cooler months!

This was phenomenal. I used veggie broth instead of the water, and used 10 cups instead of the 7. It was plenty thick even with the additional liquid. I used bulgar instead of barley and think the texture was better that way. Add some liquid smoke for a more traditional flavor.

Loved it!  I'm always annoyed at those who completely change the recipe and then rate, but I took the advice of other regarding the liquid amount.  I added 1 cup of white wine and one cup of organic vegetable broth when I added the vegetables for the last hour of cooking.  I stirred in fresh thyme and basil, instead of dried, before serving.

I was skeptical, but willing to try this recipe based on the rating.  I am so glad that I did as it was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any celery or parsley.  I will make this again and suggest other skeptics to try it.

This is such a good alternative to the real thing.  I used one vegetable broth bouillon to ensure it ended up with enough flavor.

Delicious! Seriously hearty soup. After reading reviews, I omitted the potatoes and parsley, and also added the carrots/celery at the beginning, with the onions. I ended up using 5 cups of veggie broth and 5 cups of water.

Yes yes yes!  This is my all-time favorite recipe on this site.  This makes a ton of soup, so I always half the recipe. I would double the water so the peas don't burn.  I usually serve it with a little bit of hot sauce--any kind I feel like.  Thanks, Deborah!

Pretty good! We're not vegan, but I found some split peas super-cheap, and I thought I would try a soup! I followed Suzannah's advice for the crock pot with a few changes as my crock pot is only 3 quarts: no oil, half an onion, 2 bay leaves, ½ tsp garlic powder, 1½ cup split peas, 1/3 cup barley, a few shakes of seasoning salt, a couple chicken boullion cubes, 7 cups water, 2 potates, 10 baby carrots (chopped), 3 stalks of celery, a few good shakes each of pepper, basil, and thyme. I added a little extra salt as it was cooking, and I cooked it on low for about 7 hours. It was good with grilled cheese! Next time, I might add chopped ham or maybe some bacon. I like my pork. :) Thanks for sharing, Deborah!

Well, I followed the crockpot instructions and 2.5 hours on high just don't cut it.  It was more like 5.5 hours on high.  Of course, ditzy me didn't soak the peas first, but the potatoes and carrots were not soft enough at 2.5 hours either.  

I made this for a vegetarian friend who was sick, so I used 3 14oz cans of vegetable broth, a can of cream of celery soup ('cuz I had it and didn't have celery) and then one 14oz can of water - I did not use any barley.  Chopped up some baby carrots and 2 long potatoes (next time I'll just use one), a whole onion, a bag of dried split peas, and the rest of the seasonings.  Once it was done, I thickened with instant mashed potatoes and added more pepper and added my salt then.  I think it turned out quite well and my vegetarian friend was veeerrrry happy.

Of all of the split pea recipes I've ever tried, this is by far the best tasting.  An excellent recipe. I made some changes which probably would not make much of a difference in the end result. 1) After sauteing the onions and garlic in evoo, I added the rest of the ingredients into the pot making sure to chop the potato pieces into large chunks to ensure that they would cook in roughly the same amount of time that it would take for the peas to cook. For me, cooking time works out well when I bring the mixture to a boil, then cover and simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours. 2) I omitted the parsley. 3)  I added more water per other reviewers suggestion.  Rule of thumb for me is that I make sure there is roughly 1 1/2 inches of water that rises above the dry ingredients and it works out well this way.  Try this recipe.  It may become your favorite split pea soup ever!  UPDATE 9/16/14:  I make this soup now in an 8 quart pressure cooker.  I keep all ingredient amounts the same except I only use 1 cup of split peas and 5 cups of water.  I bring the soup to high pressure for 10 minutes, then turn off the stove and let it come down in pressure on its own.  Total cook time:  30 minutes.  Using a pressure cooker allows me to make this on weeknights and at the last minute as opposed to spending hours on the stove.  It's amazing!  We invested in a Fissler, but there are other reputable brands out there, like Fagor.  Amazing machines for an amazing recipe.

i love this recipe.  i think i must have made it at least 6 times during the two weeks after i found it.  i'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian, so i tried other highly rated split pea soups from this site, but i thought they were too salty with all the ham.   Anyway, this is fantastic.  i use a wee bit less celery (personal taste), and i use chicken stock for most of the water called for.  i'd still be making this once a week, 'cept it's getting too hot for soup here.  :)     thanks Deborah!!

Excellent!  I made it in the slow cooker and got a great thick and creamy soup.  I actually had to let some of the water evaporate off during cooking, but I didn't use the barley.  I recommend dicing the potatoes very small so that they get very soft.  I also added carrots, celery and sage.  Very easy and cheap -- perfect for a busy college student.

The best pea soup I've ever made. I added 4 cups of water near the end and 2 large Knorr Veggie cubes. It was then the perfect consistency for me. I'll be making this often. I've passed the recipe on to many others.

I cannot praise this recipe enough!  The finished product has a delicious, hearty texture, and wonderful flavor!  I brought the peas and barley to a boil as the recipe directs, but then put it into the slow cooker - adding the vegetables three hours or so later.  It took nearly a day to complete (they don't call it a slow cooker for nothing), but it turned into a simply marvelous stew.  It's amazing how healthy it is as well!  It has an abundance of fiber and protein, and a good dose of veggies.  It simply blows the old starchy condensed split pea soup away.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

Very good soup. Excellent nutrition. Tastes healthy without being bland. Like the reviewer below I also added about 4 extra cups of water and the soup was still pretty thick. Also freezes and reheats well!

This was great!  The barley is a good touch because it adds texture.  Also, I accidentally bought cilantro instead of parsley, so I put it in anyway and it added a nice tangy flavor.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I half the recipe but use 6c of water and toss it all into a pressure cooker for 20-30 min after first steam release. I've been making this years now. It's a great thick soup for teaching your infants to eat with a spoon. My now 2 year old actually asks for this soup for dinner.

Attended a vegan potluck recently and this was one of the best recipes there. I added vegetable stock base to the water when I made it. This is an exceedingly simple soup to make.

We enjoy homemade soups and this is one recipe I will share with family and friends. It does need a lot more liquid than the recipe calls for. I suggest you keep a close eye on it while it is cooking. Thanks for sharing Deborah.

SOOOOOO GOOD!  I did add extra water (3 1/2 cups).  I have also made it when I didn't have barley and just substituted with 1/2 cup split peas and it's still delish.  If you aren't vegan or veggie I might recommend adding crumbled chicken sausage for additional flavor (it doesn't need it, but my boyfriend sure loves it this way!).

Very nice soup, but wow, "very thick" doesn't even begin to describe it!  I added maybe double the water and it still came out almost solid.  Tasty and easy to make though!  I used sweet potato instead of regular potato because that was what I had.  Otherwise kept it the same.

I used 4 cups of broth & 4 cups of water; doubled all the spices and used fresh herbs instead of dried, added tbsp. of crushed red pepper, paprika since I love spice. I also used marrow fat peas instead of split peas since that what I had on hand and simmered everything for 4.5-5 hours. I also added red pepper & doubled the carrots. It was hearty and delicious!

This is the best split pea soup I've ever had!  I made a few modifications, and it turned out great. I doubled the thyme and basil, and added 1 teaspoon curry, 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne.  I also substituted green lentils for the barley.  Finally, I pureed about half of the soup and added it back to the pot for the perfect consistency.  Thanks Deborah!

Probably the best split pea soup I've had.  I used a pressure cooker and cut down on the time to cook it. Still turned out great.  I added some crushed red peppers for spice and added kick.

My husband says this is restaurant quality (with a few suggested variations)!!  First, I used olive oil instead of veg.  Vegetable broth instead of water and added the herbs (which I doubled) with the peas and barley.  Didn't add the salt.  After I added the potatoes, etc., I only needed to cook it for another 20-30 minutes.  Perfection!!

The barley's texture just doesn't fit with the creamy texture of cooked peas, not very pleasant to eat. The soup was also a little bland (added an extra 2 cups of water as per other reviews), maybe with no barley, chicken stock and with double the seasoning(except for salt), it would be better but as is it's not very good.

This was delicious....I started off in the crockpot and finished on the stove because of work. I used yellow split peas, I thought this was very flavorful even without the meat. I topped with homemade crutons and served with a spinach salad. Thanks!

I loved the addition of barley - excellent!  I didn't have any potatoes on hand, but the barley more than compensated.  I used organic vegetable broth instead of water and made everything else as written.  This soup turned out excellent - even for the two kids who didn't want to try it.  They loved it and so did I.

ZERO STARS (actually if you could put a negative sign in front of that star selected above).
It is not good and I followed this recipe exactly.
it had no flavour except the peas and I could taste a little thyme. there was no depth or layers to the flavour. I can't believe this is a four and a half star recipe, it is just terrible. Both my parents are amazing cooks and my dad really does make the best vegan pea, I will have to get the recipe off him.

I had this soup at CPK and i loved it and of course came to my favorite cooking source to find it.  I made this particular one and it was wonderful. its filling, tasty and easy to make.  only thing, as others mentioned, it takes a long time to simmer enough to get the flavors to blend.  I added fresh squeezed lemon juice and a touch of fresh chili pepper for a kick.  it was wonderful and i will be making this again.

My husband loves pea soup - and he can even keep eating even after he is full - afterall he is Dutch - and the Dutch love pea soup - which is why this soup would have to be pretty impressive for me to rate it 5 stars -- BUT -- after 3 hours -- and following the recipe to the T -- it's not too thick, not too runny -- it's just too blah!  And it did not impress my native Dutch husband - who didn't even finish the soup -- or me.

I just wanted to say thank  you for this delicious recipe.  I made it for the first time for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing different I did was add more liquid.  It was quite thick.  I added one large can of chicken broth (which of course made it non-vegetarian), I added a little at a time.  When I was ready to serve I just added a little to make the right consistency.  Everyone loved the flavor.  Terrific recipe.

I love this recipe. It is so easy to make and especially convenient when you don't have a ham bone or any other type of meat to use. I suggest shaking some Frank's Red Hot sauce or Tabasco on top when served (just to add to the already great taste, not to alter!).

I didn't really like this split pea soup.  I added an additional cup or more of water
and still it was too thick to completely cook the peas.  My husband and I didn't
really care for it (especially after all the time it took).  We will not make it again.

Great recipe, but requires a few tweaks.  As many have mentioned, using the water amount recommended makes the soup incredibly thick.  Most will definitely want to add more water, but what is important to remember is if you are going to add more water, you will have more soup, and some of the key ingredients adding to the flavor, such garlic, salt, onion, parsley get watered down as well.  So keep in mind you will probably want to use more of all these ingredients, especially the garlic.  I'd recommend at least double the 3 cloves they recommend, and even 10 or more doesn't seem to overdo it.  I did not think it required more celery, carrots or potato...

This is delicious!  I used Vegan Broth instead of water and skipped the celery.  I also added 2 tsp of cumin toward the end of the cooking time to add a smoky flavor.  I pureed 1/2 of the soup and added it back to the chunky soup.  Wonderful!

Pretty good.  I made it as directed, but added more water when it all got absorbed.  Next time I might add some more spices, more garlic, and maybe some white wine, but overall a very yummy and nutritious soup

I give this recipe.  If followed, along with Deborah Sah' suggestions, this is the best pea soup recipe I ever made!  Yes, I did have to add a little more water as I cooked it as she suggested. I will keep this recipe.

I have made this a million times and it always sticks to the bottom of the pan and slightly burns the bottom of the pan.  Other recipes don't say to cook for a total of 3 hours.  Am I missing something?  Its delicious!

This soup turned out great. I substituted a few things because of what I had on hand. I was out of barley so I replaced it with a 1/2 cup of Trader Joe's harvest grains blend (couscous,orzo,baby garbanzo beans and red quinoa) and added about 8 small baby red potatoes. Also replaced half the water with vegetable stock and added just a touch od red pepper flakes. We were out of celery so it didn't make it into the soup. The consistency was perfect and it was well liked. We will definitely make this again and will also prepare the original way, which I'm sure is wonderful. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I altered a few things, based upon what other reviewers have written.  I used olive oil to saute the onions, celery, and bay leaves (I used three).  Then I added the peas, water, and the spices.  I ended up using about 12 cups of water total.  I simmered this for about 2 hours, and then added the carrots.  Within 20 minutes, the carrots were cooked through! (I didn't have barley or potatoes, so I left those things out.)  I garnished with some green onion slices, and I am now eating some of the best soup I've had in a long time.  Great recipe Deborah!!!

Delicious!  I am not a meat eater, so I used veggie bacon and it turned out terrific - still had that wonderful smoky flavor.  I would definitely make it again!

I eliminated the barley, added curry,cumin, leeks, and liquid smoke. I also used half water and half vegetable broth and kept the lid on to eliminate liquid evaporation. I also soaked the peas for a few hours which expedited the cooking process and made for a soup that was "self pureeed".

I used a pressure cooker and with the saute time, it only took 40 min! I sauteed all the veggies first, at the same time. I added the rest of the ingredients along with veggie stock and water. The soup came out way too thick. I added one cup of red wine and two cups of water. Much better. I also added Mcormick bacon pieces -- they are made of soy! So, the soup it still vegan. :)  Next time I'm going double the seasoning amounts and add four or five more cups of water and/or broth. A good basic recipe.

This is not a soup; it is a paste. I got scared early on, and added one cup of water. I will not do that next time. Some is going to burn to the bottom, but the extra soak time when you wash dishes is worth it.

This is a very good recipe...I did however add a little vegetable broth and more water to make the soup a bit thinner and stretch further.  I also added vegetarian kielbasa for a little extra something good.

The last time I made this soup I used a mixture of green peas, yellow peas, and lentils for a little variation and it turned out great. I also use vegetable stock rather than water.

I wouldn't call this "Split Pea" soup, but it is wonderful! As all the other reviews, I did add more STOCK (yep I subsituted the water for vegi stock). Next time I would not add the potatoes, and to make it spicy I added chili pepper flakes. It is hearty and can stand alone as a meal. Plenty of leftovers!

I've only had split pea soup once before at a German restaurant and so I wanted to create it at home, omitting the pork which I've given up. I started out with the intention of making it vegan but then I had to use milk because I had some in the fridge that needed to be used up. I halved the recipe, perfect for my family of 4, used 2 cups of milk, 3 cups of water, cilanto instead of parsely, added a extra garlic clove, used all basil without thyme, omitted the barley, and pureed the whole thing in the blender. SO GOOD! Don't worry if you don't have all the ingredients, because even with all my substitutions it turned out fabulous and very hearty.

We are a family of seven.5 girls and my husband and I.We're new to being vegan but I have to tell you this recipe rules beyond anything I could have hoped for.Everyone of us thought it was sooo yummmy.Even my 6 and my super picky 15 year old noshed it down and wanted seconds.We have made several variations on this with different types of spices.No matter how many ways we alter this recipe it continues to shine as one of our very favs.

I tried this soup without the barley, bay leaves or thyme. Not because I don't like those ingredients but I just didn't have them on hand. I substituted four cups of water for vegetable broth. The soup was delicious.

I am a lazy cook so after the onions became translucent, I threw everything into my Le Creuset pot and set the timer for three hours. 

I used 11 cups of water.

This is an easy recipe with lots of flavor.

I made the recipe as directed and yes, it is thick...but I liked it thick.  It was sooo tasty!!!  I did add a couple extra cups of water the next time to see how different the consistency would be...still good either way.

Like some others said, I had to use a lot more water, but the soup is absolutely delicious, thick, hearty and very tasty. I left out celery, added red pepper flakes and red wine vinegar, and some vegetarian broth. Will be serving this dish on a regular basis.

This is EXCELLENT! Tons of flavor. However, after 3 hours of cooking the split peas were still not tender enough. So will add more water and continue to cook it tomorrow morning. Otherwise, this is great! Thanks for sharing.

I love it - yummy hearty pea soup! I soaked the peas overnight and only cooked them for about half an hour before adding veges. Does need more water/stock. The way the peas & potatoes naturally break down makes for a fantastic consistency without pureeing. Just the vegetarian recipe I was looking for thanks.

This soup is fantastic.  I know its annoying when people list all the changes they made to it that made it better but I did have a couple of minor changes.  Like other members, I had to add more water as it cooked, it was more like 10 cups total.  The only other thing I changed was that I cut back on the amount of potatoes added but that was personal preference.  I felt the barley added enough to it.  otherwise it is perfect.

my heavens, but this is fantastic.  my modifications: I left out the barley, added three cubes of vegan boullion, sauteed the carrots and celery with the onion and garlic and added the peas, water, and potatoes all at the same time.  the peas had totally dissolved within a little over an hour, and the flavor and thickness are great (although I'll probably have to add water when I heat the leftovers)--so forget about the two hours of cook time.  this is better than my favorite restaurant split pea, and completely healthy, too!

Fantastic!  I absolutely Love this recipe.  I ended up adding 10 cups water total to get a chunky style soup (Campbells eat your heart out).  To make up for the increased volume of water, try adding a generous portion of garlic powder (to taste), 1 TBSP butter, and salt & pepper to taste.  This is what I did and it turned out fantastic.  Best split pea soup I ever tasted.  Even adding the extra water did not detract from the great taste.

Good but way too thick. Had to add extra salt/pepper to compensate for the extra liquid. The split peas I used gave the soup a sweet taste, so I'm going to try using different brands. Will make again with adjustments.

I've been searching for a good split pea soup that didn't rely on ham for great flavor.  I found this recipe very easy to make, however, it took several hours of simmering to get my vegetables tender.  You really CAN'T overcook this soup!  It sat on my stove on a Sunday afternoon and through the evening.  The final product was very thick, but I enjoyed it!  I will definately be making this again.

This is the first time that I've made split pea soup and it turned out very yummy.  I had to add a lot more seasonings than descripted.  Other than the fact that it took 4 hours from start to finish, it's easy, yummy and healthy!

I usually omit the potatoes because it becomes a little too starchy with the barley. Definitely needs at least 10 c of water. Sometimes I put in a few cups of vegetable broth. Once it is all done I puree it to give it a smooth texture.

I soaked the split peas before I started the recipe as another reviewer suggested and I substituted 3 c of vegetable stock for 3 c of water.

i made it almost exactly as the recipes but did not use, barley or parsley and added 1/2 c brown rice, and 1/2 c broccoli but the recipe is really delicious in its original form, the spices are perfect in the original recipe and loved the potatoes in it/ the original recipe tastes better than my variation/i didn't use parsley or barley/ i tasted the original recipe before i put the brown rice, and broccoli in and liked the taste more of the origianl recipe. this is probably the best split peas soup recipe i've ever tasted.

This was thick and delicious - a perfect soup for cold winter nights. Even though I cooked it for four hours, the peas were still a little hard; next time I'd cook them for five hours. I'd also leave out the potatoes - they were bland and didn't add anything to the soup. I did, though, add a sweet potato I had lying around, and it was a great addition.

This was a very easy soup to make, and it was very hardy.  DH and I both really enjoyed the soup.  DH had to add a little salt to his, but overall it was a creamy, thick soup that hit the spot.  We will make it again.

Followed the recipe exactly for the crockpot and this was a real winner in my house. It's wonderful, flavorful and very filling. The only thing I did differently was to add BOILING water to the vegetables. Also, after about 3 hours, I added another 6 cups of boiling water because the mixture was becoming too thick to stir. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

This has been my go to split pea soup recipe for a couple of years. I use vegetable broth instead of water and usually end up using at least 4 cups more broth as the peas, barley and potatoes take on moisture and thicken. This soup is a winner and it's incredibly nutritious as well as delicious.

I followed some of the other reviewers and made the following adjustments; omitted the barley, as I did not have any, added some chopped ham and a bone, used about 10 cups of water, simmered on the stove for a few hours, and used only one potato.  I actually had some leftover parsley, which I added, it gave the soup a wonderful flavor.  Very good, next time I'll use Barley and omit the ham.

Very filling!  I halved this soup, both bc I only had a cup of split peas and because it's just two of us.  I kept the spices as directed for a full recipe, though, and am glad I did.  I put this in the crock pot all day.  I had it on high for about 4 hours, then changed it to low for the last six.  I added two more cups of water and vegetable bullion to this.  Hubs liked it but thought that it needed chicken.  Since this is a vegan recipe, I'm amused, but I suppose since we aren't vegan it doesn't matter for us.  I added leftover chicken to our leftovers of this soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this soup yesterday and it was delicious. I tripled the batch and it's all gone! Between me, my mom and two younger siblings, we ate it all. I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil, bay seasoning for the bay leaf and did not add barley as we've already been getting enough carbs of that sort via excessive amounts of christmas cookies. :p but anyhoozles, i strongly recommend this recipe. very easy and delicious. :))

This was delicious! If you do it in a crock-pot (as I did last night), be sure to cook on high for 3 hours. I added a bit more salt and pureed about 2 cups of the soup. It was perfect!

I am editing an earlier review.  The cook time and water measurements are off- I needed to add a lot more water.  I am adding stars because after this sat the flavors really developed- we liked it.

Overall this was pretty good. I have some barley and was looking for a recipe to use it up. I made this without the celery since I am not a huge fan. I also only had a little more than 1/2 a cup of split peas so that is all I put in. I did add a little extra barley though since I had plenty. After an hour of simmering the soup started to burn at the bottom so I had to add some more water (only a cup though... I'm a little sad I did not read the reviews ahead this time). It looked like the split peas and barley were done though, so I added the carrots and just 1 potato thinking they may not get fully cooked without the rest of the soup burning. And I was right. I used only 1/2 teaspoon of parsley because I only had dried and that was enough.I think I may try this again but definitely with MORE WATER.

I give it 2 stars for being healthy and economical to make, but it was sooo bland! I even added broth instead of water. However i did have to add water to keep it from burning and getting completely dry. And it took forever to cook. I should've made lentil soup. I am not vegan but I don't eat pork or other meats so I would sure love to find a good split pea recipe. This one just did not do it for me. 
Revision-(I edited my review and added a star, since my younger son ate 2 bowls as a snack after baseball.

This is the best soup I have made so far! I usually use 1/2 broth and 1/2 water and that makes it super flavorful! It is so forgiving too. Try it even if don't have all the ingredients.

Great recipe... I'm not a fan of split pea soup, but this one I'll make again. I did modify it a little. After sautéing onions, garlic, & bay leaves (used 2), I simmered the peas (left out the barley in this step) in 6 c vegetable broth for an hour. Then added double the spices, veggies as called for, 3 cups water, and medium barley.. Bring back up to a boil, then simmer for an hour. It made the soup hearty with lots of banging flavor. (my bag of peas said they could be ready in 20-30 mins. Sorry I forgot to get the brand.) Happy eating!!

Made this last night and it is indeed good. Creamy, comforting, perfect for a cool fall evening. Didn't need additional water as some of the other reviewers have stated. I did however have to cook it for a good hour longer than the recipe said. It's not big on flavor (but that was expected) so I used bacon salt (which is vegan) instead of regular sea salt and added Bill's Best Chik'nish Seasoning. Would make again, though I'd probably do it in the pressure cooker. All told, this soup took me about four and a half hours to make. That's just too much for a weeknight.

I made a big pot of this soup on Sunday.  I used vegetable stock instead of water, but then added 4 cups or so of water as it cooked.  I also added extra veggies.  Very hearty!

Sometimes I add about 1-2 Tbs of the dry chicken bouillon to prefect the flavor a bit, but this is one of the only recipes that I will actually follow because it is so good. Thank you!

I love all the natural ingredients in this recipe and the inclusion of Barley. Though I was very thrown off by the reviews as many people stated that the soup turned out too thick. I followed one review that said to throw everything in a crock pot and cook on high for 3 hours. I did just that-3 hours later the peas were still crunchy...I used dried split  peas. I then added 3 more hours and the peas never softened up. I was very disappointed. I now have the soup in an actual pot where it has been cooking for 2 MORE hours and the peas are still not soft. I think next time I will just stick with the original instructions to use a big pot and simmer on the stove. Other than that, I am really impressed with the overall flavor, and I am sure when the peas are cooked, it will taste even better! Well done!

I am anything but a Vegan but I made this and it was awesome.  I added extra garlic.  I think next time I will cut the veggies smaller.  It is better the second day.

Excellent soup! I followed the receipe except did not have barley.  I added a little cumin seed sauted with the onion and garlic.  And added fresh basil, tarragon from my garden. My husband loves it.

This has come out so delicious each time I make it, although I tweak a few things. First of all, I don't typically have barley lying around, so skip that. Use olive oil instead of veg oil. Vegetable broth instead of water. I think that adds a little more flavor. And dried parsley instead of fresh, which comes out fine. This soup is amazing and especially yummy leftover, although it's so thick that you really need to add quite a bit of water when reheating or you'll have more of a split pea porridge.

I love this soup!  I added too much barley and it dried up like a lake in the desert but some vegetable broth smoothed it right out (I'll measure more carefully next time!).  This is fantastic, a keeper!

This is a fabulous recipe. I cut the cooking time by an hour by throwing in the carrots, potatoes, and celery at the hour and a half mark. At that time I also added 3 extra cups of water. I finished it off by adding a lot of black pepper. Spectacular!!

I added several cups of extra water, used parsnips instead of potatoes, left out the barley and put in all the seasonings at the beginning. SO GOOD! I think next time I won't simmer it for so long. It turned into green mush, and I prefer to see the shape of the peas a bit more.

Our whole family loved this soup!  I was a little hesitant, since our kids are pretty young, but really, everyone enjoyed it - I prefer this over the typical style recipe with meat.  Thanks!

Cooked in Crock pot like we had done with other split pea soups. Found this one to be a bit dry tasting. I would recommend blending about half of the soup in a blender or food processor. We did add the extra water as some others had suggested (12 cups total).  In the future I would add more garlic. We like to also put some Tabasco sauce when served, a few drops seems to do the trick.

Definitely use 12 cups of water from the beginning or else the soup will be too thick, and in danger of burning.  Even with the 12 cups, you will need to stir occasionally, or the bottom may burn. I made this for a friend and didn't think I would like it, but this recipe is absolutely delicious, and I've already made it twice in 2 weeks.

I only had 1 cup of split peas and no barley, but made the soup anyway.  Doubled the seasonings and added more potato.  I have to say, it was really, really good.  A+

This soup was a hit in my family although I did some altering.  I omitted the Potatoes and put all the veggies in with the onions to fry.  I also soaked the split peas for 4hrs which cut the cooking time down by half.  I did use chicken broth (homemade is best) and I added sausages about 2 bratwurst chopped in small pieces).  I added extra water so that it wasn't too thick.  The barley adds really nice texture to the soup, I don't recommend omitting.  I love this recipe, it's definitely going in my favourites!

I give this soup 4 stars for the recipe as written. With the following changes I would give it 5+. The following are amounts that are different from what the recipe calls for:

4 cloves of garlic;
1 tsp basil;
1 tsp thyme;
1 tsp pepper;

I also added:

10 c. vegetable broth (instead of water);
1 1/2 Tbs. of soy sauce;
1 tsp garlic pepper;
1 tsp Emeril's essence seasoning salt.

Then I pureed it with my immersion blender and served it with soy bacon bits on top.

very good! I put the celery and seasonings in with the peas and barely and for the last hour I added the potatoes and carrots. I used a lot more carrots, lots of celery salt, and more seasonings of everything listed. Very nice recipe and healthy! This is the 1st time I made it with the barely & potatoes and I like it!

Very good, you don't even miss the ham. I replaced the barley with rice and used nearly 3 times (I just kept adding water as it was looking really thick) the amount of liquid recommended (half water/half broth). The soup was a little too chunky for my taste so I pureed about 2/3 thirds of the soup once it was cooked and it turned out great.

I guess I set my expectations a little too high on this one. It's really flat, contrary to how I imagined it would be. It's like none of the spices helped. My Mom used to make some fabulous split pea soup with Mrs. Dash spice. I always thought that was an amazing addition to the recipe. 

Sorry to say this recipe didn't quite live up.

Excellent!  I did as the other posters suggested and put in more water - about 10 cups total.  I also used chicken bouillon cubes in place of salt, which gave the soup a wonderful flavor.  My fiance is still raving about it!

This soup is so tasty- I did add 2 cups of water as was suggested and I also added about 1/2 cup of sundried tomatoes and an 8 oz can of corn and a T of salt to make it a little different. I love the barley- delicious!

This soup had a nice flavor, however it took over five hours for the peas to get tender (maybe they were really dense!).  Next time I will definately soak them overnight.  I also added more liquid per other reviewers' suggestions (almost twice the given amount).  I was a bit disappointed with my results which mainly had to do with the length of time it took, so I could not give this one five stars.

This is the first time I've ever made any kind of soup, and I thought it was pretty good.  I added more water as other reviewers suggested but even though the soup did not seem too thick, the barley kept sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Still, I wouldn't leave it out as I really love the taste.  I think I might use less of the carrots and potatoes, though, as I felt they detracted somewhat from the taste of the split peas.

My view is pretty much the same as all the others.  Very yummy, my 7 & 9 y/o's ate it.  I took everyone's advice and used 12 cups of water to start with and also added a vegan boullion cube.  We topped it off by sprinkling the top with bac'uns (vegan fake bacon bits).  In a word: YUM!

This recipe is great with the exception that it needs a little extra water.  Throw in one or two extra cups of water, and keep an eye on it while it's cooking so it doesn't turn into sludge and burn.

We loved this soup. We made grilled cheese sandwiches with bacon (morning star fake bacon or fakon as we like to call it) so we got the smoky flavor of ham that is normally in pea soup and didnt miss a thing!

This was good and healthy but way too thick.  It ended up being more like pea blob than pea soup.

Delicious soup!  I added fresh thyme, fresh basil, and chicken bouillion cubes and pureed it in the blender and it tasted even better.  I froze some of the extra soup in individual containers for future lunches.

This soup was really great!  It was so thick that it was more of a stew than a soup.  My son brought me a thermos and begged to have it in his school lunch the next day. :)

I love split pea soup, and was ecstatic
to find a recipe for one without ham!
I must say, even though the poem suggests
eating this soup 9 days old (peas 
porridge hot, peas porridge cold, peas
porridge in the pot, 9 days old), make
sure you keep the pot in the refrigerator.

A fabulously flavorful and hearty soup that even my non-vegan spouse loved. We served it with build-your-own veggie wrap sandwiches. The only change I made was to use vegetarian broth instead of water. Definitely a keeper!

I used 12 cups of veggie broth instead of water.  Other than that it was perfect.  I don’t understand all these people modifying this VEGAN recipe with chicken broth and ham bones!  Sure,  you can make yours that way but why using a VEGAN recipe?  Go get one of those other recipes.

Very tasty soup. Since the other reviewers said it didn't have enough water, I started with 10 C water. By the end I had 12 C total water. Will definitely make it again

I used this recipe as a base. I made it in the crock pot and used vegetable broth instead of water and added an additional 1-2 cups of broth. Threw everything into the pot and tripled the seasonings except the salt. I also threw in a couple of dashes of Liquid Smoke.

I have been using this recipe for many years, and I can't say enough good things about it. I am not vegan, but my daughter is, and I don't eat ham anyway. This is a nice, quick, tasty recipe and the flavor surpasses that of the ham based soup I grew up with.   I make this at least a few times a year. Sometimes more in the winter. It's comfort food for a snowy day.

Really good. I threw everything in the crockpot for 10 hours on low and used a high speed blender to blend 3-4 cups at the end. I omitted the barley.

Followed the recommendations and added 4 extra cups of water. The soup was very tasty and I will make this recipe again. Next time I'll try replacing a few cups of water with vegetable stock for extra flavour.

I read the reviews & followed advice: sautéed all the vegetables  together, added additional water & even a couple of drops of liquid smoke. I did NOT add the potatoes because I didn’t have any  — plus, I don’t eat potatoes. Regardless, the soup was OUTSTANDING!!! Simple, but very flavorful. Yes, it made a lot. I froze about 1/3 of it & I gave some to a friend who couldn’t believe that it was meatless. I will definitely make this again! 5 star, 2 thumbs up recipe!!

The instructions for this recipe were off. I had to keep adding water to keep it from burning, and the vegetables weren't cooked through at the end. I recommend adding all the vegetables in the beginning, increasing the water to 9 cups, and reducing the cooking time by 45 min.

Needed a gluten free veggie soup and this got rave reviews. I put everything in the crockpot and somewhere between 6-8 hours on low it hits perfection, but don’t be afraid to let it keep cooking on low. I did use organic veggie broth and exchanged the basil for more thyme. Don’t make this without the thyme!

This was amazing!  My first attempt making split pea soup and it was so great, I have no reason to ever try another recipe.

I love how thick this soup is.  And the barley adds such a wonderful texture.  I used to eat a lot of processed pre-packaged foods and split pea soup was one of my favourites.  It's something I have definitely missed over the years.  Now that I know how easy it is to make, I think it's going to become a staple!  And it's so much more delicious - and nutritious - this way!

I made some tweaks to this recipe, so I thought I would share:  I omitted the potatoes and celery.  I added 1/4 cup extra barley - because I love barley!  I also doubled the garlic, doubled the basil, and used 2 tablespoons of dried parsley in place of the 1/2 cup fresh because I didn't have any fresh on hand.

I noticed, like many others, that I did need to add extra water throughout the cooking time.  I just added as needed.  The 3 hours total time got the peas to that perfect soft consistency.  I'm so in love with this soup :)

What a wonderfully thick vegan split pea soup recipe! I didn't have potatoes and it still turned out amazing. Even my meat loving hubby liked it. Thanks for sharing.

I read the reviews and Used 4 extra Cups Of water As Well as simmered it another hour.  The flavor was very rich.  I have made it 3 times now.  It tastes better with chicken broth than water.

Delicious soup, and simple to make! I omitted the barley, took it easy on the parsley and used one and a half chicken bouillon cubes.  Plus, a dash of sea salt.  I'll use the barley next time, although soup was thick enough without it.  I highly suggest trying it!

My family all loved this soup. I accidentally used lentils instead of peas. I used twelve cups of water and just about doubled the spices. It was perfect! Hubby said it was the best soup I ever made.

AWESOME recipe! My husband and children all made faces and sighed when I told them what I was making for dinner. I was worried when I realized how much of this it made and assumed I would be freezing it all for lunches for myself. Well...the ENTIRE pot was eaten by every one of them in just a day and a half! It was so good that my husband has requested I make this again today. And make a double batch. As well as keep it in the weekly rotation. I followed the recipe verbatim except adding more cups of broth and water. Loved it!

It was excellent.  The consistency and flavor was perfect.  I did use half chicken broth so it is not Vegan anymore, but when I make it again I will use water only..

I made this with what I had on hand and with what I like. I used yellow split peas, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and a tablespoon of butter. I did the quick soak method after sorting my beans, simmering them with the onion and garlic to infuse more flavor (since I didn't have veggie stock to use). After waiting an hour for the quick soak, I simmered for about 90 mins, blended it in batches in my blender, and added the butter to finish. Delicious.

I am just stunned at those negative reviews, the recipe said it was thick and could be made thinner with more water. So anyone complaining of that part didn't read all the directions.  As far as bland is concerned, again you can always season to taste so if you use what they ask and want to add more.  
This soup smelled wonderful as it cooked yesterday morning I was making it for Lent since it has no meat in it.  I like the ham hocks in split pea soup but with the potatoes and barley it wasn't lacking in texture at all.  I think I added more thyme then was on the original recipe, I had soup for breakfast.  Awesome!

I made it again tonight. We liked the flavor, but it is an understatement to say "thick".  The first time I ever had a dry soup.  It dried out immediately on contact with air. I had the same experience another reviewer had, stuff stuck to the bottom and then formed a crust on the bottom of my pan which I'm currently trying to boil off!  I had added a cup of chicken broth with the vegies, and I'd probably cut the potato to one. I don't think I'll make this one again.

I only changed one thing. I used Veggie stock instead of water. WOW this is such an amazing soup. My toddler loves canned pea soup, so I tried this recipe in an effort to give her some quality nutrition (so hard with a toddler sometimes). This soup is so hearty and filling. The whole family loved it. I will be making this many more times.

Made it just as written. It was fantastic. Hubby says he likes it better than any other pea soup he's ever had (and he's a carnivore). If you're making it, try it VEGAN instead of adding ham. That's the point. Promise, you'll like it just as well, and you'll have saved the life of a very grateful piggy.

Sorry this soup has potential but it needs way way more water. The soup was too thick and burned too easy. I stirred it often but it didn't matter cause a soup that thick on the burner for 4 hours is almost impossible not to burn unless you are constantly stirring for 4 hours straight.  A lot of work and ingredients involved in making a soup that ended up burnt to  and was unbearable to eat. Very embarrassed cooking this mess for my family.

Loved this hearty full-flavored soup!  I omitted the oil, added vegetable broth to thin it.  Who needs ham when there is so much flavor without it.

Great flavor but needs a little tinkering. Had to use 10 1/2 cups water total, because ingredients were burning even with 8 cups to start.

This soup is thick and hearty thanks to the barley. During the cooking process I added water, when I noticed that the water had evaporated with the simmer. It had a great flavor and thick, rich texture.

Just like the pea soup I grew up with!  I followed the direction to a Tee and it turned out perfectly.  It's a rich, pea flavoured soup.  Got 6 lunch meals out of this one batch.
No variations needed.

This recipe tastes amazing.

Full disclosure, a few things I changed: only 1 tsp of salt (kosher sea salt); more garlic, carrots, celery, and potato, but no parsley; brown rice instead of barley. (Personal preferences and/or adapting to what I happened to have in the house.)

Most importantly, I did not need to cook it nearly as long as the recipe says – more like 1 – 1 ½ hours for the first simmer, and maybe only 30 minutes more after adding all the veg. I also used more water, somewhere between 8 and 9 cups, and I actually think I could have used even more. The soup came out very thick, and towards the end I really had to be attentive that it didn’t burn to the bottom of the pot. However, overall this recipe is super easy, low-maintenance to cook, and DELICIOUS!

I've made this several times with and without the barley to cut cooking time. I always sautee the veg's prior to adding to pot o' soup to bring out the flavor. Tonight I needed it even faster, so I omitted barley and switched peas out for red lentils. Delicious.To add to richness I used my submersion blender to thicken. Very versatile.  A staple in my house.

I make this soup every winter.   I substitute vegetable broth for water , add additional water as needed and don't add additional salt.    Very popular with my family and friends.

  Tonight I threw a parmigian cheese rind in while it was cooking the last hour.    Of course that made it no longer vegan, but it did add an interesting extra flavor.

I didn't make any changes except to add more water and we cooked it in the crock pot. In adding the water I guess I should have added more salt because it was fairly bland. My timing in the crock pot must have been off because the barley stuck to the bottom of the pot. My family wasn't a big lover of split peas to begin with so I doubt we will make this again.

I made 10 servings &  made a few changes:
Omitted parsley 
Added lemon pepper 1/2 tsp 
Added 3/4 tspn of black pepper
Added smoked paprika 
Added 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar 
Added 1-1/2 cups water for 10 servings
Added potatoes after 2 hours, but waited another 20 minutes to add carrots & celery, as I like a little crunch to vary texture of soup. 
Added additional tspn of salt
This was a fantastic recipe. 
This was enough to feed 5 hungry men, with only a small bowl left over. 
The barley was a great touch. 
Will definitely be making it again, soon.

made it in the crock pot. I used veggie broth instead of water. also added a few drops of liquid smoke. didn't pre cook anything just threw everything raw/dry into crock pot. subbed quinoa/orzo for barley. didn't have issue with soup drying out..started with half the amount of liquid and added the second half toward the end..maybe that made a difference? anyway the finished product was very thick more of a stew. very tasty:)

I have made this so many times.  I make it just as said, but add a little vegetable bouillon. We love it, and feel so good when eating it. Healthy healthy healthy:)

Great, easy recipe with a delicious outcome.  I used a mix of vegetable broth and water...and used probably another 1.5 cups of liquid than the recipe calls for.  Also, I added my veggies after about 1.5 hours instead of waiting for 2 hours because I noticed the peas had almost completely broken down (not necessarily a bad thing).  Soup was done in 2 hrs.  If you want your peas to have more structure, I suggest adding the veggies an hour early.  I will definitely make this again.  The barley is an awesome touch.

I added a few extra cups of water, substituted 4 cups of the water for chicken broth, added broccoli and substituted the barley with bulgar. Because of the extra water, it seemed to down out some of the herbs so next time I'll add more and keep the barley.

This soup is DELICIOUS! I keep going back for more. I used 8 cups of water, one vegetable bouillon cube, and slightly less than 2 cups of split peas. I also doubled the thyme and basil and omitted the parsley. Will definitely make this soup again.

This soup is fabulous.  Thank you for such a great recipe!!  I adjusted ingredients to my family's diet and made it gluten-free by substituting 1/2 cup arborio rice for the barley, 8 chopped green onions for the yellow onion, and I used less fat for sauteing.   Otherwise, I used two huge red potatoes rather than russet and added 1/4 t. cayenne with the spices.  I started the peas in water in a separate pot while I chopped/sauteed the vegetables because I didn't have three hours for the soup to cook.  As I finished chopping/measuring items, I added them to the soup.  It was completely done in two hours.  Be sure to use lots of water, stir frequently, and turn heat down once the potatoes and rice soften and begin to stick to the bottom of the pan.

Very yummy. I made a few adjustments. I omitted the barley (didn't have any), added one large potato, used part vegetable stock & part water, and like others suggested, I added more water. It was absolutely delicious. I will definitely make it again and include the barley.

Great recipe.  I did have to add more water a couple times during cooking.  Added vegetable base to the water to give it a little more flavor.  Also used cilantro because I didn't have parsley.  Very good!

I like a quick cook soup when I'm making lunch for the week on a Sunday night.  I sautéed my onions, celery and garlic together then added the potatoes, carrots, spices, barley and peas and 12 cups of water seasoned with vegan veggie cubes.  Brought to a boil and summered for about an hour and 20 minutes and came out perfect!  Not too thick not too thin!  I did have some sticking but I didn't use a heavy pot so that was probably my downfall.  The soup however was delicious!

This is WONDERFUL!  My family really enjoyed this soup. I did find that it needed twice the amount of herbs, as another reviewer suggested, to suit our tastes.

I made this using red lentils instead of split peas. It was good still but the lentils did not have as much flavor as the peas would have, because of that, I did season my bowl with some curry powder and Sriacha and it was pretty good that way. The kids liked it as it was made with no additional seasonings. I cooked it in the slow cooker for about 3 1/2 hours on high. I just threw everything in at once. I will make this again with peas or lentils.

Delicious!  Based on the reviews, I added about 4 cups more of water in the beginning, as well as the carrots, celery and I doubled seasonings.  Added diced potatoes in the last 45 minutes (or so) of cooking. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you Deborah!

Tastes OK, a little bland.  I ended up adding an extra 1.5 cups of water and it was still too think, like smashed potatoes vs. a thick soup.

This is an excellent recipe. My friends and family loved this soup. I did take out the celery. Instead of the salt I used Goya's veggie seasoning and a tablespoon of curry. I must agree with the others that the soup is a thick Super thick but very tasty. Thanks for sharing.

Great soup, especially the texture -- I did add more liquid, as suggested. I skipped parsley just cause i didn't have any, and I added a generous pour of balsamic vinegar at the end, because it felt like a flavor was missing (who knows, maybe it was the parsley!). That did the trick.

This soup is excellent!!  I will make it again for sure.  After reading other comments I made this in the crockpot. I followed the recipe exactly except  I used 8 cups of vegetable broth instead of water.  I also did not put potatoes or parsley in my soup.  It was fabulous!  You can't beat a great vegan meal!

Needs more salt, but other than that I really liked this recipe.  I used to use a ham bone to season my soup, but I much prefer this healthier option.

Wow, so tasty and filling. I left out barley (made it gluten free) and potato (didn't have on hand) it worked out perfectly and I don't think I would add potato next time. I liked the full pea flavor. Only other change was I used Italian seasoning in place of the dried seasonings called for. I imulsified partially to leave a slight chunkyness. I will definetly make again and again. So inexpensive and easy. Mine didn't take as long as recipe called for. Upon sitting it thickened up as well.

Very delicious.  We are not vegetarian, so I used chicken broth instead of the water and salt.  Added about an additional 3/4 teaspoon of salt and a sprinkle of cayenne.  I didn't use barley and forgot to add the parsley, but didn't miss it.  Also added some turkey kielbasa.  The kids loved it.

Used all ingredients except for barley and instead of fresh parsley I used dried. I just threw it all in the crock pot on high. It cooked in about 4 hours. The only thing I added was Bragg's liquid aminos. It was wonderful! The herbs were just right! Thanks for a very yummy recipe! Even my picky eaters liked it!

I'm not vegan, but I ADORE this split pea recipe!  Nice to have a split pea recipe that doesn't need meat, just in case I've run out of meat.  But I didn't feel that this recipe needed it.  was very fulfilling and lively on the tongue!

I skipped the barley, used 1 potato, 2 stalks of celery, and 2 carrots instead.  I love how easy this was the make and the flavor of it.  I added 1/2 cup of split pea after the 3 hour mark because I wanted a little more texture.  Probably need to cook for another 30 minutes and then will turn off the stove.  

Will definitely make it again and highly recommend this.  Great alternative to a typical ham split pea soup.

Instead of vegetable oil, I used canola oil, omitted the barley and instead of parsley I used cilantro. Added a couple more carrots and couple more celery stalks.  Yum yum !

This is delicious! DEFINITELY follow the advice to use more water (I used about 12 cups--although some say that if they don't add barley, they don't need the extra water. I added the barley so I can't speak to that). I also threw in some veggie bouillon cubes. I appreciate the flexibility of this recipe. I didn't have celery or bay leaves or parsley and it still turned out delicious.

Don't let the term Vegan put you off.  This is delicious and perfect for a meatless Monday or Friday in my case.I was looking for a recipe that included both split peas and barley and found this yummy soup.  I had to sub poultry seasoning for the thyme, basil and black pepper.  And I didn't have any potatoes so added an extra 1/4 cup barley.  I like split pea soup a little sweeter so I think I'll add an extra onion next time.  And I agree with others, I had to add at least 4 cups more liquid, which I added when necessary.

This soup is so good. I make it quite often. I made slight modifications to it though. I use 4 cups of vegetable broth and 5 cups of water. I dice up the potatoes and carrots and mix them in a bowl with the basil, black pepper and about 1/2 a tablespoon of canola oil and place them in the oven until browned. Then add this to the soup with the remaining ingredients after its been simmering for two hours.

so tasty and comforting on a cold dreary day.  Had to more than double the liquid by the time all was said and done, but I was making a smaller quantity. Used veggie broth and bouillon instead of plain water to add more flavor and doubled the garlic.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. The only think I would do differently next time is cut the potatoes into smaller pieces.

Awesome! I did 9 cups of water, used 2 small/medium red potatoes.  It burnt a little on the bottom but actually gave it a great smokey taste to it! My boyfriend loved it, thinking without ham it wouldn't be as flavorful!

It is good, a great  place to start but i omitted the carrots and potatoes and used olive oil and added a tbs of liquid smoke and a 1/2 brown rice(wish i had left the rice out). Also, a little more garlic ! Very yum and authentic tasting!

Everyone loved this soup. I made it exactly according to the directions with one exception: I added 2-3 T vegetable base (Better Than Bouillon brand) during the last 30 minutes of cooking to pump up the flavor. Served with homemade croutons.

SO GOOD! The best Split Pea Soup I've tasted, very hearty and filling. I modified slightly: left out the barley, used 8 cups of veg broth (more flavor - I like Better Than Bullion) and only used one potato. I've made this twice now, and experimented with consistency. It's good on the chunky side (half blended, half not), but I prefer a pretty smooth texture, so think I'll blend 100% from now on. Keeps well, makes great leftovers.

This is a great healthy dish. I halved the recipe, omitted the vegetable oil, and used dried parsley equivalent (1 tsp dried herb = 1 tbs fresh). Finally, I threw all of the ingredients into a slow cooker and cooked at low for 6 hours.

I boiled the soup for well over the recommended 3 hours and still had some chewy peas.  Overall, the recipe was tasty, but did lack that ham flavor that most split pea soups possess.

Recipe is great!  I ended up using an additional 2 cups of water during the last hour to thin it out a bit.  I added the spices when i first sauteed the onions and then added more spice to it when it started cooking.  I probably tripled the spices all together.  A very hearty and healthy soup.

I have never had split pea soup before so I don't know what to compare it to, but this is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't have any trouble with the amount of water/thickness. I did add another tsp of salt because I found it a little bland. I will absolutely make this again.

I had some dried split peas on hand, and I feared that I wouldn't be able to find a flavorful split pea soup recipe. This one convinced me that it's possible!  It was great and full of flavor. I'm not a vegan, though, so I used homemade chicken stock instead of water.

Quite tasty prepared as is, which is what I did.  My daugher sprinkled on about a tablespoon of homemade bacon bits that I always keep in the freezer, and she said that pushes up the rating to five starts.  For me however, I was aiming for a vegetarian dish.  Will make again.  :)

very good, and the barley was an excellent addition. I suppose it makes a thick soup, but i've always preferred it when it comes to pea soup. This is the best pea soup i've had in a long time.

I was concerned that this would come out bland with all that water and no broth what so ever.  I threw everything into the slow cooker(no pre-cook or saute) & added about 4 extra cups of water.  Let it cook on low for 7 hours.  Delicious!  We are not vegans but we do eat vegan on occassion.  We will make this again.  It's a keeper!

This was really good. Had no fresh parsley so added about an 1/8 of dried but otherwise followed recipe to the T.  Needed to add more water as I went along but just kept my eye on it. Loved the barley.  Made it a little chewy.  I don't think I ever ate barley before.  This is a keeper when I want a stick to your ribs dinner.  It made a ton to freeze.

This makes a lot of soup. I changed by not adding the potatoes and adding 11.5 cups of liquid. 4 of those were broth. The first time I made them I used chicken broth but it wasn't as balanced even though I doubled most spices. The second time I used 4 cups of vegi broth and doubled the spices - including garlic and onion except for salt and everyone loved it. Definitely something I'm going to be make a lot of.

I'm still looking for a good veggie split pea soup - even after doubling up the spices it came up wanting. This soup is an odd substitute for the real thing.  Sorry I made it.

My fiancee really liked this soup but i thought it could use a little more flavor.  We followed the crock pot directions and added a bit more water to make it more soupy. Pretty good recipe overall! Will make again, maybe with more spices next time.

If you’re in the mood for split pea soup, this will hit the spot. I thought it was good, but for the amount of time it took, I’m not sure if I’d make it again.

This recipe I cannot get over! Delicious. I have made it several times already. I usually use only 1/2 tsp of celtic sea salt, only 1 stalk of celery, no barley and about 6-7 cups of water. It comes out great everytime.

Very yummy! I love the lightness that the barley gives to this recipe. The other reviewers are right - you need a lot more water than the recipe states. 
I've been mking this for three winters, though, and it's still a favourite.

THIS RECIPE TURNED OUT GREAT.  I'M NOT STRICTLY VEGETARIAN SO I USED CANNED CHICKEN BROTH INSTEAD OF WATER, AND ADDED 2 PACKETS OF GOYA HAM FLAVORED CONCENTRATE.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN CALLED FOR TOO MUCH LIQUID BUT I ENDED UP HAVING TO USE EXTRA BROTH.  YOU WILL ENJOY THIS ONE.

This is a great recipe. I always hated split pea soup. I think it's the ham that I really hate in it. This turned out fantastic. I added lots of potatoes, and it really needed quite a bit more water, but it's fabulous.

I didn't need to add any liquid to this recipe but I did cover the pot while it cooked. The only change I made was to use homemade vegie stock instead of water.  Very yummy!

This was one delicious soup Deborah.  I changed it up a little due to what I had on hand, but had great results.  I used all chicken broth and left out the potatoes and barley.  I also added some crushed rosemary and chopped up a ham steak and threw it in.  I gave it a few pulses with my handmixer to chop up some of the veggies.  The leftovers were just as yummy heated up.  I'll use this one again.  Thanks.

This recipe was a life saver!
I made it right after I had my wisdom teeth out and ate the whole thing in the course of 5 days!  It was excellent.  I didn't really want to sit and watch the pot so I sauted all of the first ingredients but then just threw everything else into my crock pot and left it on high for the night.  By lunch time it was all set and none the worse for wear.  The one thing I will say is that I ended up adding quite a bit of salt and some pepper to each bowl, there wasn't much in the original recipe.  I also didn't add the parsley until later and I'm not sure it really helped the recipe.  It certainly made my apartment stink for a day.  I might leave it out next time.

Superb! I used olive oil, celery seasoning because I didn't have any celery, two vegan buillion cubes and more water. Easy, quick, simple and better and cheaper than Campbell's(which I love)!

My baby loves this.  My infant son loved this dish so much that I froze the leftovers in baby portion sizes.  I heat it and mash it with a fork and he eats this whenever we have something to hard to his two little teeth to eat.  My husband was not as crazy about it, but it makes great baby food.
