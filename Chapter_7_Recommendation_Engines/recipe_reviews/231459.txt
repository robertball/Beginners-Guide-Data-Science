This was pretty good, especially for crock pot pork chops. They were very tender, and the barley was perfectly cooked. Instead of dicing the onion, I just left it whole so that my picky eaters could get the flavor without the texture of the vegetable. I halved this because my family is small, but I wish I had kept the original amount of barley -- if you're serving six, consider doubling it, or your portions will be small.

I made this recipe with 4 chops and there was not enough barley. Next time I will use one cup and perhaps add a cup of carrots the last hour. The pork chops fell apart like pulled pork. Should I have seared them in a pan first?

As per other reviewer's suggestions, I doubled the amount of barley . . . big mistake, as the whole dish was ruined! The barley was dry and the pork chops were dryer, to the point that they were inedible. Obviously, one needs to add more cooking liquid if adding more barley than the recipe calls for; just wish I had realized that before I ruined the dish.
