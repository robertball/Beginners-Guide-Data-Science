These are so good!  Browning the butter adds an absolutely wonderful flavor.  I only made a very small batch to try out the technique - never made cookies this way before.  But you can be sure I'll be making them again...

These cookies are delicious! So light and buttery! I didn't make any changes other than using whole almonds instead of almond halves.

The timing is wrong, it takes an hour and 10 minutes to prep plus another 30 minutes for cooking time and therefore it take about 2 hours to make and ready to eat.

The taste of this cookie cannot be faulted - rather like an extra light shortbread. However the consistency is very crumbly which made putting them together difficult. In the end I used cling wrap to hold the roll together when I refrigerated it. I also found it only made just over half the amount stated. Don't know if I will make them again - the taste may tempt me!
