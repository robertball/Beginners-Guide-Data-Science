Pretty good at home. I'm not sure what makes this a campfire recipe besides the marsh mellow though. We don't usually take the double boiler with us camping or use it on the open fire.

I loved this.  I don't know if I could make it over a campfire without the whole thing falling in though.  I toasted this in the toaster oven on a piece of foil until the outside marshmallows got brown and it was delicious.
