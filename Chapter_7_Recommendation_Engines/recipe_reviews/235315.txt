My daughter and son-in-law eat Paleo for health reasons. . . Wanting to spoil them a bit, I did most of the cooking during my recent visit.  I have been wanting to try this recipe for a month or so. . . . I followed it exactly and used Granny Smith apples. This "oatmeal" took some time to put together, but was well worth the effort. It was a delicious comfort food, perfect for a cold winter morning! Will definitely be making this again.

This is one of my favorite paleo breakfast recipes. The eggs and spices really give this the flavor and texture of real oatmeal. Now I can get my oatmeal and protein fix all at once. I make a double batch and eat it throughout the week. Tastes even better reheated

I used a blender to combine all the ingredients. I omitted the apple and oil and raisins and opted to top off the dish with strawberries and currants. I also used organic stevia. With my blender, the texture was light and fluffy.   It tastes very good and is very very filling!  It would be a great base recipe on which to build and customize. I wasn't really sure about the texture at first, but I have really started loving the flavor and how filling it is!  I am sure there is a way to make it less fluffy, but with my blender, that has not been the case. I added more pecans on top for an added crunch. This recipe is a keeper. I will be making it weekly.

Good, with a few tweaks.  I added some water and a splash of apple cider to the apples and raisins so they cooked down softer.  Omitted pumpkin pie spice and added 1/4 shredded unsweetened coconut.  I rough chopped my nuts instead of putting through food processor.   Gave it all a little more "oatmeal" texture.   I put some fresh strawberries on top for a brighter note - I think fresh pineapple would be good too.

My 11-year-old son already has high cholesterol. So I'm looking for more nutritious breakfasts than what he usually eats. This was a winner, especially because he didn't like regular oatmeal. I really liked it too I made it exactly as instructed.

Followed the recipe exactly and the entire family loved it.  (We have three boys ages 13, 12 and 9) We have only been eating Paleo for about a month and we were looking for some good breakfast recipes to give us some variety.  This one is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

Wow this recipe was very very good I was impressed ate it at 7 am and its 245  now and I am still going. It was hard to believe I was eating eggs not oats. The only addition I did was add dried cranberries.

Pretty good for Paleo "oatmeal".  Only takes a few minutes to make and you'll likely already have most of the ingredients on hand. For those wondering, the texture resembles mushy cream of wheat.  If I do make it again i'll likely skip blending the nuts into the mixture and just crumble and add on top. FYI I added fresh wild blueberries and slivered almonds on top for added crunch.

This was really good Paleo "oatmeal"!  I loved it, but I think the one thing that would have won me over completely would have been to pulse the blender after adding the nuts.  It was super smooth, and I think the bits of nuts would have been a great texture.  I do not like raisins so I subbed chopped up dried apricot :)  Tasty!

It took a while to put together, the end result was tasty but the texture is not exactly what I had imagined. Overall I would not make this again, and if I were to spend the time doing so, I would make a double batch! Good & healthy meal :)
