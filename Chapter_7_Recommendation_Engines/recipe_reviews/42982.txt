i loved this recipe! altho perhaps calling it a 'salsa' is a tad misleading. it's best eaten with plain rice, asian style, which might explain why the flavors were too strong for some reviewers, hehe! try a small teaspoon of this on a large rice cracker as finger food.

My boyfriend loved this recipe, but unfortunately I didn't.  I found the taste of the fish sauce and all that cilantro too strong.  The prawns that the recipe called for are just too large - you have to eat a bite of prawn, then a bite of the salsa.  If you like cilantro, you should try this recipe - but I suggest you use small shrimp that can be eaten with the salsa in the same bite.

This is an interesting combo and so very delicious! Very easy to make as well. I have made this many times and love it the more I make it! I mix the prawns in and eat it with a spoon I love it so much! Goes good served as an appy with french bread too. If you love cilantro, mint and lime juice you will love this recipe!!

Very good (and pretty)! You may think the salsa dressing is too salty/limey at the beginning, but it sweetens a lot after the bananas are added. King prawns were a little too dear for me, so I used large shrimp. You may want to chop your bananas & cucumber smaller to make this more like a salsa, I just brushed my shrimp with the dressing and ate it all like salad. Thanks for the recipe!

Brilliant, the Salsa was amazing, used it with fish cakes instead of prawns.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks

I was looking for something outside the usual meat'n taters. This was an unexpected spicy/tangy taste kaleidoscope! Didn't have any fish sauce so I used soy instead-- worked great! Also subbed the red pepper with red pepper flakes, as it's what I had on hand. And finally, subbed with queen-sized shrip instead of king prawns. One thing I wasn't sure about was whether the dish should be served warm or cold. Guess I'll have to taste test both! I will definitely make this interesting dish again. (Gave it a 4 since I didn't follow the exact directions.)

Gave this 4 stars because I changed it so much from the original but what a great base to start with!  I eliminated the cilantro and put in only 1/4 tsp. of the thai fish sauce (1 tablespoon of that stuff would put me off fish for a year!)  I will increase the bananas next time.

So fresh, I love it! I went heavy on the cilantro, used a very firm banana, and (spice wimp!) used some of a yellow bell pepper and couple dashes of cayenne instead of the chile. Prawns - yeah right, couldn't find them at my tiny neighborhood grocery, so threw a packet of salad shrimp right into the salsa and ate it with a fork. Best solo dinner ever, thanks so much for sharing!

I used a Serrano chile pepper, soy sauce instead of fish sauce, splenda instead of brown sugar, and ginger from a bottle.  It turned out great.  I halved the recipe because I figured it would not be good as a left over.

I'm in love with this. My store didn't have tiger prawns so I used tiger shrimp. I wasn't sure how these flavors would come together but they all worked perfectly. The shrimp themselves didn't have too much of a flavor on their own, so I plated this with a little sriracha to add flavor to the shrimp. After adding a little heat on the shrimp the crisp cool salsa was the perfect taste to complement it . I enjoyed this and will make again. This recipe as written would also taste great served in a lettuce cup/wrap.
