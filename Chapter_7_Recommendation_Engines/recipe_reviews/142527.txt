I've made this over and over and it never fails to get compliments. I make no changes. TIP: I made this today into a pumpkin loaf. I used mashed pumpkin in place of the banana and added cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and ginger. Turned out beautifully. It'll make a nice Christmas loaf for friends.

I tryed it as is and then the next time I changed it some. I used 2 bananas 1 8oz can crushed pineapple drained and 1 6 oz jar maraschino cherry drained and diced. It was a great Hawiian version

I made muffins instead of loaves, used paper baking cups to prevent them from touching the metal pan and baked them between 25-30 mins, yielded 2.5 dozen! they were very moist - perhaps too moist, but they were technically done, but next time I may bake for a few mins longer.

In my opinion these needed more banana flavor (i used 4 overripe bananas), and some spice to the batter. next time i will alter the recipe to better suit my tastes. they just tasted like semi-plain sweet muffins with only a hint of banana. on some of them i made a crumb topping (from another recipe on this site, Banana Crumb Muffins). I liked them with the crumb topping and they gave them a pretty look. Hubby took them to work this morning and they went over so-so (by comparison, I made regular cinnamon friendship bread for them and I heard raves all day long) I probably will make these again but tweak the recipe alot.
I will say that I really liked this recipe because it used 2 cups of Friendship Bread starter - not only did it make the muffins puff up alot and look really cute, but it got rid of 2 bags of starter so i didnt have to find as many "friends"

I started making this bread a year ago, and it is a hit with family and friends.  I substituted the 4 bananas with 2 boxes of Jello instant banana pudding; it's incredibly moist and there's a great banana taste!  Instead of shortening, I used 1 cup of oil.  I utilized this same recipe for pumpkin bread, applesauce bread, and cranberry bread; makes great gifts!!

This recipe is now the only recipe for banana bread that we will ever use. My family loved this bread so much that the boxed brand banana bread I made two days ago is now being passed up. This bread is very moist. I only made one loaf and changed the recipe a bit. 1 cup starter, 2 ripe bananas, 2 eggs, 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 cup flour. Didn't have any walnuts so I didn't add them. I also added a little cinnamon and a very small pinch of nutmeg. It came out very nicely. Will be making again for years to come. Thank you for the recipe.

Everyone loved this and it's my favourite way to use the starter, mainly because most of the other recipes have pudding mix in them. I confess to making a change. Because I ran out of white sugar, I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar. This was moist, kept very well, and baked nicely in my longer (13 inch) loaf pans. I will be making it again in 10 days when I have more starter!

I've made this recipe as-is a few times and it is excellent. I've also used it as a basis for experimentation. I've found that if my starter isn't yet fully active, it works wonderfully by simply mixing all ingredients except b.p., b.s., salt...and letting it rest in a bowl for a few hours. Then stir in the other ingredients and bake.  It seemed to allow the various fruits I've used to macerate and the resulting flavors/aromas are intoxicating.

I loved this bread. It was very moist and flavor full. I made it just as it was written, next time I think I will add just a little cinnamon to the batter. I will definitely use this recipe again when I have the starter. Thanks.

This was my second.  The first was the cinnamon one and this one kinda combined, which was gone in two days.  I still have this one.

Our new favorite banana bread!  Using the friendship starter always produces such moist, flavorful loaves of bread, and this one is no different.  I did cut this recipe in half, so I only had to use 1 cup of the starter.  I also used 2 full eggs, and added in a small package of dry banana pudding mix.  Most other friendship bread recipes that I have made call for vanilla pudding, so I decided to add the pudding, and banana just seemed to be the right choice for this bread.  It was a huge success.  I now have the starter going with several in the freezer because of how much we enjoy this particular bread!

Love it! Excellent banana flavor. I left out the walnuts, next time I might cut down just a hair on the sugar. Otherwise, change nothing!

This recipe has good flavor.  It's great and definately moist.  I baked it at 300 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  I never seem to get the middle done without burning the outside if I bake at the higher temp.

Very very good bread!  I forgot the last step in the 10 day process before splitting up the starter and just started making bread, but all of the bread batches I made still turned out great and I froze more than half of them.

I just made this recipe and it turned out ok except it has a faint taste of beer.. matter of fact before I used the starter it smelled kinda like beer.  I know that when I got the starter from my friend it had a sweet milky smell and the bread she had baked and given to me tasted sweet and milky. I was going to make the chocolate version tonight but Im afraid to now.

These turned out so yummy! It's my first try cooking with my friendship bread starter. I had some bananas to use so I found this recipe. I just sampled my first batch of muffins. Delish! I have a loaf in now. I did increase the salt to 3/4 and it's great.

This turned out amazing but I did have a few modifications!  I used salted butter instead of shortening and added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also omitted the milk on accident but the recipe turned out fine.  I baked for about 1 hour and 5 minutes with my convection oven.  This is maybe the best banana bread I've ever made!!

Great- but made a substitution.
I thought this recipe was wonderful. I read that some people felt that the banana flavor wasn't as much as they would have liked, so I added another half of banana and added half a package of vanilla instant pudding. I also subbed 1/4 of the shortening for 1/4C of butter. Lastly I sprinkled some sugar on top. It came out REALLY good. I think this will be my new go to recipe for banana bread.  Note I also needed to cook it an extra 10 minutes and could have probably cooked it another 5-10 minutes, but it was still reall good and cooked through.
