Thank you Dash!!!! I'm from Nova Scotia and I CRAVE these things. This recipe is a great recipe for donair meat ~ the sauce is bang-on, as well. For the reviewers who may be unsure of what to do with the sauce and meat:
1) Fry a pita in a small amount of oil to soften it (I just put mine in the microwave for a few seconds ~ it's just to make the pita pliable to wrap around the fillings), fry the donair meat in same pan to warm it, and then fold the pita around the donair meat, sauce and chopped tomatoes and onions for toppings. (I've also had them with mozzarella cheese melted in them ~ mmmmmmmmm).
2) Meat and sauce make great oven-baked subs (same topping suggestions).
3) Donair Pizzas ~ sauce, meat and whatever toppings strike your fancy, mozzarella cheese.
4) The famous Donair Plate: fries topped with meat, sauce, chopped tomatoes, chopped onions, mozzarella cheese and baked in the oven. (I  order mine without the fries ~ personal preference).
I can't believe donairs haven't really caught out outside eastern Canada ~ these are big business at the pizza shops here....I order donairs way more often than pizza ~ my 13-year-old has been an addict since he was old enough to pick off my plate. :-) Oh, and pizza corner rocks for donairs.

I am from Halifax too. This is the exact recipe used by the restaurant that invented the Donair. The trick to the meat is to ask your butcher to put it through the meat grinder 2 more times to grind it extra fine. Medium beef also works the best. Also, absolutely no substitutes can be made for the sauce. You must used evaporated milk and you must chill the sauce before using. The cold sauce meets warm spicy beef is an important part of the experience. a warm pita is important too.

It seems some people are getting Gyros (Greek) mixed up with Donairs (Lebanese).I used to work in a Donair Shop in New Glasgow, N.S.& have never had anything even close to it here in Ontario.Two tips:1) mix the sauce as little as possible & slowly add the vinegar.2)moisten the pita with water & heat it up in a pan with some drippings from the meat.It should be baked on a rack in a pan.I usually make 5 lbs of meat at a time & freeze half for a donair pizza later.Pizza Delight, Cambridge,Ont. is the only place I've found that makes a decent donair like home!!!

I moved to Regina from Edmonton 4 months ago and back home there are donair shops EVERYWHERE...here there is not a single one.  So I desided to make them and home using this recipe and everything turned out wonderful.  I now make 10lbs of beef at a time and freeze it in little ziplocks for individual servings and for friends who have moved here and miss the tastes of home.  Again the sauce is perfect as long as you remember to blend the ingredient WELL before adding the vinager.  We wrap ours in a steamed pita bread and top it with the sliced beef that we fry after it has been frozen or cooled and then add on diced tomatoes, onions, lettus and mozza cheese.  We then wrap it in wax paper and foil and put it in a plastic bag like they do at the donair shops so it isn't that messy when we eat it.  I hope that everyone else has as much success with this recipe as I did....enjoy!

This recipe is amazing! My husband (from Halifax) and I have been using it for the past 8 months and it is both of our favourite meals.  I am vegetarian so I use veggie ground round for mine and just add the spices to it instead (without salt).  my hubby makes the meat version and it's turned out every time.  The sauce is also delicious and anyone who says otherwise is not making it right...it takes some technique...this is how we do it: -must use full fat evaporated milk -mix in sugar and garlic completely until sugar is no longer granular -begin whisking the mixture to get liquid moving and pour in 1/4 c of vinegar AT ONCE -ONLY STIR 3 or 4 more times and let the chemical reaction occur and the mixture thickens (on its own)...this is key!! The sauce turns out perfectly this way...so we recommend following the steps exactly if you want the same great results that we get! ***also make sure to wet the pita under the tap and sear it on a hot pan so that the pita is moist and pliable for adding the donair ingredients!

This is absolutly fabulous meal. The important thing they left out of the recipe is how to eat it!  after looking around the net, First we tried it on fried pita breads. which was delicious, but was messy, and fried.  so, we then tried it, with just dry pitas, and opened them like pockets. with the meat, and the sauce, and tomato and onion.  would be good with lettuce or cucumber too.  would also be good on a premade pizza crust like boboli and the sauce and tomatos onions and cucumbers.  Fabulous meal, for something that sounds so gross. I will make this again and again.  plus, since the meat is so simular to meatloaf recipes... maybe ill try just making the sauce for that leftover night.

Thanks for a great recipe!  These are awesome!  Be sure to add diced tomatoes and onions to your donair.  Try what the last reviewer suggested... donair pizza is very good.  It's been a year since I had one while visiting family in NB, but I'm so happy that now I can make them any time.  This deserves more than 5 stars!!  About the sauce... mix the sugar and garlic slowly into the milk with a whisk using a non-metal bowl.  Add the vinegar one teaspoon at a time and whisk gently only 2 or 3 turns after each.  By the 4th tsp, it will be thick!

THANK YOU!!! My husband and I now live in New England, but we both grew up in NS.  This recipe was SPOT ON.  We like spicy foods so I doubled the herbs and spices which suited us perfectly :)  We always got garlic fingers with our donairs (great for dipping in the sauce)so I whipped some up using frozen pizza dough.  I sauteed 5 cloves of minced garlic in a few tbs olive oil, spread it over the dough and sprinked with basil, oregano and whatever cheese was on hand.  This recipe could NOT have been better for our cravings!!!

I am from Atlantic Canada and this is a great recipe for donairs (I love them and have them alot) I can't believe that this delicious treat hasn't gone much past Atlantic Canada yet and I could barely belive it when I found this out.  The meat in this recipe is perfectly spiced and the sauce tastes perfect as well.  You are a real donair expert! :)

I love this recipe!  First time I had a donair was in Halifax while I was visiting, when I came upon this recipe I was stoked! I find that for two of us, the amount of sauce is too much, so I cut it in half, 8oz of evap. milk, 1/3 c of sugar, 1 tsp gar. powder and 2 1/2 tsp of vinegar. I make two small loaves instead of one and cook them both but freeze one, that way your meat is ready to go next time you get a craving for this delicious meal.

I'm a born and raised Halagonian, but now live in Europe. While pregnant, I would crave donairs all the time, so I always made extra to have on hand in the freezer for those 2am cravings.
Since I now have lots of practice making this recipe, (too much I'm sure) I have found through trial and error that you can achieve a better texture to the finished product if you mix the meat mixture in the food processor. This makes the cooked meat much more dense (like the real deal back home) and less like typical meat loaf that your Grandma makes. You can get a nice thin slice this way.
I also put the sliced meat in the frying pan for a few minute to get that slight crispy texture that the original donairs had. (Before the electric shaver machine became the standard..blah.) Awesome recipe! Don't forget to dip you bread in water and fry/heat it in the pan with the meat!
If you have extra sauce, why not try another Halifax take-out favorite...garlic fingers. Yum!

I'm from Oklahoma and I had never heard of donair.  I tried this in pita bread with sharp cheddar cheese, tomato and romaine.  I was not blown away by this recipe.  I found the meat to be dry, first off.  I tried to have an open mind about a milk-sugar-garlic-vinegar sauce (Oklahomans like their milk gravy but this mixture is TOTALLY unexpected..) I guess it's culture shock.  Not something I'll make again.

I'll give this recipe 5 stars.  Made it for the ist time today and really enjoyed the recipe.  However I think I will add Cumin and Red Peppers next time for more depth and Kick to the meat.  When making the sauce I did not realize that the vinegar is supposed to thicken the sauce So I cooked the sauce to a rolling boil for a few minutes.  Added a little dill. The sauce gives the donair its authentic flavour.  Once cooled in the fridge is was exactly the right consistency and the taste is awesome.  Will make this recipe again for sure. Everyone Loved it.

The secret to the thick sauce is more sugar, and use evaporated milk with at least 2% fat.  I kept thinking it was the vinegar/milk interaction and never got it quite right until I went overboard on the sugar by accident and voila!

I made the donair's last night, and made using the exact same ingredients, however next time I will reduce the salt to 1/2 -3/4 tsp. I also put all the spices in a grinder and ground to a powder ( used oregano flakes, whole pepper and red chilies), then added all the meat and spices in my blender and blended until very finely ground. I rolled in plastic wrap very tight , then placed on a broiler pan. After having it cool in the fridge for 1 hour, I used very sharp knife and sliced very thin. No need to keep overnight in the fridge before slicing. It turned out wonderfully!!!! For the sauce I used one can of sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 cup white vinegar, added 1 tsp of garlic powder. Thank you so much for sharing this, I will never pay again for a sub standard donair again

The meat is amazing. Tasted just like any I've had from the best Donair shops. I would recommend at least doubling the recipe as it doesn't make much. It also freezes well so I think I'd make a few batches to keep in the freezer for quick meals. I sliced it cold the day after making it and pan fried it briefly. If you don't feel like the meat throwing workout, just use a food processor. My second batch done in the f.p. yielded just the same texture. Everyone was raving over this. It only gets 4 stars because I had issues with the sauce. I followed the directions to the letter and it was way too runny. The taste was spot on though. It also make far too much for the amount of meat, that is, unless you like your sandwich *really* heavy on the sauce. Thanks for the recipe and making our tastebuds do the happy dance.

OMG!  I just finished making and eating this wonderful recipe!  Having grown up in NS, and worked in Donair & Pizza shop I was excited to have this small taste of home.  After reading some reviews, I can not stress enough that the recipe calls for evaporated milk NOT condensed milk which is correct.  To make the sauce you need to whisk the milk, garlic powder and sugar until the sugar is incorporated.  Then begin whisking quickly and add the vinegar all at once and only whisk 4-5 more times and stop!  If you continue to stir the sauce will liquefy. Let the sauce mixture sit and the flavors meld while you prep the sandwich. On a hot skillet fry the meat to heat and run the pita under water and heat it as well.   Note that the pita, and meat are served hot, but the sauce, tomatoes, and onions are cold. There was enough sauce to garnish at least 6-7 donairs and for us the meat only made 3...so I would recommend that you at least triple the meat portion of the recipe! Thanks for a taste of home!!!!

I did not make the sauce part of this recipe because I live in eastern canada, and bought it instead. However, I was looking for an alternative to the expensive prepackaged meat. This is great! A teensy bit too salty, and I recommend using cracked black pepper as it is more authentic. Overall, however, very delicious and donair-y. I formed patties on skewers and barbequed them, as I didn't have the time to allow it to bake. Worked out fine. Thanks.

Good recipe for one of my favorite treats.  Living in Atlanta and I can't get to Bashi's or the Pizza Corner to get one.  Everyone is right about the sauce being thin.  The secret is to have almost the same proportions of sugar and vinegar as you are trying to make a suspension of the milk fat in the condensed milk.  When I worked at a pizzeria in Halifax we'd make it as follows: 2 12 oz can condensed milk 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup white vinegar 2 tblsp garlic power 1 tblsp white pepper  Mix all the ingredients except vinegar together. Once mixed, start stirring and quickly add the vinegar in and stir roundonly 2 or 4 times more. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hour or overnight to let it setup and for the flavours to meld.  Try donair pizza with the sauce as the base instead of pizza sauce.  Oven baked donair subs rock too - cover the m with mozzarella and add the sauce at the end. Mmmmhhhmmm!    Another great use (as every pizza shop in Halifax sells these) is to make cheese fingers out of a pizza dough with garlic butter and cheese and  dip in the sauce. Last great alternative is the "donairpep".  Add pepperoni when you are frying the meat up, it adds a nice touch.  You can also add green peppers, mushroom, what ever you like to a make a "loaded" donair.

The meat turned out just right. Dense & easy to thinly slice. I wish I’d use a little less oregano as it tasted a bit too strong for me. The sauce was…um…er….unique! Yeah let’s go with that. Extremely unique:o) And there was a heckuva lot of it. A HECK of a lot. Since there’s no chance of me aquiring a taste for it, I didn’t keep it. Thanks for sharing:o)

As an ex-Edmontonian who's baffled by the complete absence of good Donair shops outside of Alberta (and Nova Scotia), this recipe is a godsend.  Finally, something for my Donair cravings.  

Based on my one trip to Halifax and K.O.D., this seems like a very authentic Halifax donair, and should be very satisfying to anyone from Edmonton. 

The key to a mouthwatering donair is the sweet sauce, and how the sauce gradually mixes with the meat and spice to make each bite better than the last.  But this recipe is nuclear sweet.  If you're not from Halifax you'll probably want to cut down the sugar by a quarter or a half.  And as others have suggested, you really need to up the vinegar to thicken the sauce.  It's also quite garlicky.  You can cut down on the garlic powder it that's not your thing.

A little dill weed made a nice addition to the sauce as well, but it was a shot in the dark.  I'm still searching for a sauce closer to the typical Edmonton donair, but this is a delicious starting point

If you want to have thick sauce, here is how to do it: Combine the evaporated milk, garlic and sugar, mix until the sugar has dissolved.  Then drizzle the vinegar over the top, (I use about 2 tablespoons, maybe more, I do not measure it).  Let the sauce stand without stirring it for at least 5 min. Stir it with a fork, see how thick it is and how it tastes, if you need to drizzle more vinegar over the top.  Do Not Taste the sauce with the fork or spoon you used before, the enzymes in the saliva will cause the sauce to go runny.

Fantastic and tastes almost as good as a restaurant...a rotisserie would make it perfect as it tastes best slowly cooked without drying out.  I recommend undercooking it since it will be fried up anyways.  Always wet the pita and blast it for a few seconds in the microwave to make more pliable.  I usually add mozza cheese at this point. Thanks for the great recipe.

The meat was really good – tasted a lot like the lamb in gyros because of all the spices and mixing process the ground beef goes through. I did not feel like this recipe was complete. If I hadn’t researched Donairs, or read the reviews, I wouldn’t have known to lightly fry up the thin slices of meat and serve it on a pita. I think this should have been part of the recipe for people who have never heard of a Donair like me. I used a Bosch mixer to knead the meat and it turned out great. The Donair sauce thickened just fine (I added the vinegar all at once like other reviewers said to do). I made three sauces – a tzatziki sauce, a red greek meat sauce and the Donair sauce. We liked all of the sauces - they were just different from each other. The Donair sauce is sweet and garlicky, the tzatziki sauce is cool and refreshing and the meat sauce is savory. I realize if you use a different sauce it probably doesn’t qualify as a Donair, but the meat does go well with other sauces. We will definitely make the meat again.

Outstanding! I surprised my wife with this and she wondered why it took me an hour to "reheat" the kebab meat. She thought I had bought it from the local kebab shop and only believed I had made it when I showed her the rest of the loaf!
This has saved a ton of money (€6.50 a kebab).
Thank you SO much.

These were very close to the donairs I'm used to, but it was quite dry.  I used lean ground beef (the recipe doesn't specify), but next time I think I'll use medium or even regular and maybe not cook it as long.

My family loved this!  It was just the right amount of spicey.  Recommend you definitely throw and knead the meat according to the receipe.  You will end up with a loaf that has the texture of donair meat and is easy to slice.  Don't forget to let the loaf stand for 10 min after cooking to make the slicing even easier!  Also recommend you chill your sauce to get that real donair experience and definitely garnish with lots of chopped onions and tomatoes.  Also suggest to heat your pita before assembling donair (stack in microwave with a damp paper towel covering them and heat until warm).  You could also add warmed up sliced pepperoni with the meat.  We are having donair pizza tonight with the leftovers (I will definitely add pepperoni to the pizza to make sure there is enough meat).  Absolutely YUMMY!

What a wonderful recipe!!!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to the "T" , it was good, but lacking in depth flavor for our taste (I like a heavily spiced donair meat).  So I made the following adjustments: 1 tsp salt (kept the same, perfect amount) 2.5 tsp oregano 1 tsp flour 1.5 tsp fresh cracked black pepper (fresh makes a huge difference in flavor) 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning 2.5 tsp garlic powder 2.5 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp cayenne  In addition I added:  1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp red pepper flakes   The sauce is bang on! the first time I tried it, it was pretty watery.  Don't be afraid to add a touch more vinegar... it's the vinegar that thickens the sauce - but as other reviewers have noted... don't stir too much after adding.     Each batch ends up different, so add another 1/2 tsp of vinegar at a time stirring slowly until you get the consistency you like for the sauce.  Thanks again Dash, we will never go out to buy a donair ever again!!  OH BTW... the leftover meat is AMAZING for pizza.  Make your favorite pizza dough, use the donair sauce instead of regular pizza sauce,  layer on your thinly sliced donair meat, and add some shredded cheese.

Wow!  This is EXCELLENT!!! Hint: Do let the meat sit in refrigerator at least overnight before serving.  I tried it straight out of the oven and just wasn't that impressed.  However, tried again the next day and WOW!!! really great.  I didn't have great results with the sauce though.  Too runny for my liking.  Nothing compares to the PIZZA DELIGHT donair sauce so I did some searching and finally found something comparable.... use 1 can sweetened condensed milk, 1/3C white vinegar and 1-2tsp garlic powder (or to your liking). Combine the garlic powder and milk together well then slowly about 1/3 at a time add the vinegar, let sit a few seconds then just stir to combine, let sit another few seconds and continue until all the vinegar has been combined.  Refrigerate it for at least 30mins before serving.  So delicious!   I used store bought greek style pitas (which are thicker and more like pizza dough) then followed another reviewers idea for wetting them well then frying them up in an oiled frying pan to warm and soften them up.  Good job Dash!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is very good. This is the first time I have tried making donairs. We had a a few friends over and they were all skepitcal of trying homemade donairs, as was I. I doubled the recipe but next time, I won't double the sauce. Doubling the recipe serves about 10 donairs. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was that I mixed the meat in a food processor. After that, I got my husband to throw the meat into a bowl 20 times. Didn't knead the meat. I baked it as 2 separate loaves. After cooking, I let the meat cool down before chilling in the freezer for 2 hours for easy slicing. When it was time to eat, we reheated the meat with a pita bread in frying pan for about a minute. Served with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and jalepeno peppers. Forgot the cheese. We also used quite a bit of vinegar cuz we like a thicker sauce.

I lived in the Maritimes for 20 years and got addicted to donairs.  I never found anything close to them in Ontario.  Whenever I would go back to visit the east coast, I would bring donair meat and sauce back to Ontario with me that I purchased in the grocery store.  My husband, who has lived in Ontario his whole life, got addicted to them too.  The only place I was able to find donair meat or sauce in Ontario was through a restaurant supplier...and the sauce wasn't quite "right".  Not to mention, I had to order a 4l jug!  

I had a craving one day...and thought I'd search this site for a recipe to make the meat and sauce myself.  I tried both the sauce and meat recipes and they were both WONDERFUL!!!  Exactly how they SHOULD taste!!  My kids LOVE the sauce and would eat it with a spoon if I let them.  It's just like the sauce served in that pizza chain!

Thank you SO much for such a wonderful (and simple!) recipe!!

OH MAN!!! Pretty darn close Dash...Moved to ON 7 months ago and we've been craving donair.Everyone is extremely happy because of you. Thanks again..YOU ROCK..
SAUCE Afternote:  I have had trouble with my sauce being thin in the past but today I tried it with chilled evaporated milk and adding the vinegar very slowly and stirred slowly....I also had to add an extra 3-4 tsp of vinegar and adjusted the garlic to our liking...You could stand a spoon in it it was a thing of beauty....good luck its worth a try!!!!

Having been gone from NS for 10 years now, we are always looking for our donair "fix".  We just recently found a GReco pizza in Ontario and were ecited about donair pizza.  This recipes is really good, but hte sauce was just OK, maybe because I used non-fat milk, dont know.  Next time will try whole milk.  Thanks, this is a keeper!

I made “Dash’s Donair” last night and we loved it! I made the meat just as the recipe calls for only tripling the recipe as I have 4 boys to feed. It was quite a hit; I am giving it only 4 stars because we did not care for the sauce.  The sauce did pull together nicely, only stirring a few times after the vinegar was added as others said. However it was way too sweet for our tastes, but we gave it a shot. We are use to gyros here and thought the meat was very similar to what we get at our local Greek Restaurants. I also made the “Tzatziki” sauce on this site as a back up to the Donair sauce and we loved it. 
We will be making this again soon.

This is really good! I have never had a donair but seen it on the reviews page and decided to try it. It tastes very similar to a gyro and made this way has a kind of similar texture to. The best part is I know what kind of meat went into making it. I used 93% lean beef and it worked fine. I lined a square pan with foil and sprayed it with pan spray. I didn't know what to think about the slamming it 20 times, but I did that in the large plastic bowl I had mixed it into, but it really does compact the meat making it slice up in nice thin slices. Do not skip that step! I served it on thin Lebanese pita bread with sliced tomatoes and onions. I tried the sauce but did not like it at all. It was so sweet and I don't care for canned milk taste anyway. It is a waste of canned milk as it makes way too much anyhow. After finding I did not like it I just made a white sauce with about 1/2 cup lite sour cream, a minced garlic clove, and a spoon of milk to thin it. I will definitely be making this recipe again, but doubling it next time. Thank you

This is a fantastic recipe!  All of the donair-loving men in my life go nuts for these. :) I've even tried making them with ground turkey (a bit healthier) and as long as it's got a little extra cayenne in there, no one's the wiser.  Awesome!  Thank you!

I make this all the time. The only thing I do differently is put the ground beef through a food processor to make a smoother consistency(don't over do it though), Excellent. I also like it on submarine buns too.

Yup. Just like I remembered from Greco's in N.B.  Didn't change one thing except how to thicken the sauce.  The ONLY way it will get the correct consistency (like pancake batter) is to heat all sauce ingredients in saucepan over medium heat, stir constantly and slowly stir in about 1 tsp cornstarch.  NOW, it's a perfect recipe.  My sauce (although very tasty) was always runny even after barely stirring vinegar in.  I then let it chill as meat is chilling as it is better room cool or at minimum room temperature. I Bought Greek gyros bread-do NOT even use pita bread-must be thicker and soft. That is what donairs have in common with gyros - the bread.  My southern born children adore this recipe from my childhood which makes me very happy.  Thanks DASH!

Important:  REALLY REALLY WORK THE LOAF!!  I'm a big guy, ex-baseball pitcher.  I use a large wok and SLAM the meat mixture into the wok at least 40 times.  It's worth it for the texture.  You MUST USE A BROILING PAN, unless you have a spit rotisserie.  I've made this recipe several times and added some secret ingredients to give it a personal touch.  Thinking of opening my own restaurant, based on the rave-reviews.. and for the fact that you can't get a donair in Montreal.

Having eaten out East at many a donair restaraunt, I made this for my wife and neighbours (who come from the East Coast). First time I made it, became an instant hit. Reminded family and friends from back home and said that it tasted just like "home". I did not tweak the recipe or add any extra flair. Will definitely make more and take the suggestion to double, maybe even triple the recipe so that there is some to freeze.

Thanks for the great recipe!!!  A note for people curious on how to eat them, in Nova Scotia, they are usually so full of meat that you have to use a fork and knife to eat them.  Especially if you got a belly buster! (1 lb donair)

We loved this. Had no idea what Donair was.  There was only one other Donair recipe on this site so I did some research on the internet to compare recipes.  The Greeks, Turks & Lebanese lay claim to this dish. This recipe was VERY similar to others with a few differnces. Majority called for bread crumbs instead of flour.  After reading I used combo of 1 1/2 lbs beef, veal & pork.  Doubled all spices, except for salt (halved that), 1 1/2 tsp. of paprika, 1/3 cup of bread crumbs instead of flour.  I used my heavy duty mixer using flat beater on a high speed for 5 minutes.  Let the machine cool down & then used first speed for 15 min.  (Do not overwork your machine)You could see the texture of the meat change - it was getting kind of stringy! Baked it at 300 for 2 hrs. turning over half way.  Chilled overnite.  For the sauce I used the exact ingredients called for but what other recipes advised was add ALL the vinegar VERY quickly and then to give it only 3 or 4 quick stirs - then refrigerate.  That is what I did-it worked perfectly.  We aren't big on pita breads etc. so I just spooned a layer of sauce on the plates, topped with shredded lettuce, then the slices of fried meat, some diced tomoatoes, thinly sliced onion and cucumber and more sauce on top. If you love Gyros - you will love this.  When I make it next time I will use 3lbs of meat & make two loaves.  Reviewers on the internet said this freezes nicely.  Thank you so much submitter!  Gyros whenever I crave them!!!!

loved this recipe! i have also tried another recipe for donairs but this one tastes more authentic. i tripled the recipe and added 1 tbsp of paprika to the 3lbs of meat and spices. i'm lucky enough to have a kitchenaid mixer so i knead my meat mixture with it for about 5 mins using the bread attachment. i must admit i've never been successful getting the sauce thick using canned milk. so this time i followed anothers suggestion and added sour cream until it thickened to the desired consistency. i also added a clove of garlic to the sauce. i actually prefer the taste of the sauce with the sour cream added. i will continue to make this recipe.

This was a great recipe!  My husband said it smelled like pizza when it was cooking.  Throwing the meat really made a difference in the dense texture.  Unfortunately, we didn't like the sauce - way too sweet.  Will try the Tzastiki sauce next time.  Thanks for a good dinner!

Bang on!!!

I left eastern Canada in 1999 and haven't tasted a good donair since. They have variations here in the USA, but they're not the same. They are usually called Gyros (Pronounced Gee-ro or Jy-ro) and is a Greek version. There's a Turkish version as well. I think they spell it donare (doe-nar) Both are OK, but the sauce is thicker and doesn't have the same flavor.

Thanks for this recipe. A taste of home in my own kitchen

As a born and bred Maritimer, I'm most impressed!!! This worked perfectly without any changes. For those having problems with the sauce, try adding the vinegar stiring only once or twice then letting it sit for a few minutes. I found the sauce thickened perfectly doing it this way. My kitchen smelled like the best donair shop in Halifax last night...thanks Dash!!!

The seasoning is perfect, I'll definatly recommend a similar seasoning to be done to make buffalo/beef burgers.  I threw the meat into the bowl about 30 times as hard as i could (missed once), this worked fine to get the meat almost as compact as that in a donair shop.
As for the sauce, i have a palette for sweet foods as well as garlic so it was perfect.  I did find that the evaporated milk i used didn't thicken enough, so i tried several different thickening agents.  In one bowl i mixed in flour, and in another corn starch.  Both of these i found left to much of a grainy texture.  The last bowl i used sour cream as the thickening agent and it worked perfect.  start with a little bit of sour cream in the bowl and add the sauce, wisk together until desired sweetness (or thickness) is achieved.  I recommend the sour cream method for those who find the sauce way to sweet, since i find the flavouring essential to complementing the donair meat. Im sure gelatin or tapioca will help for those who dont want to sacrifice the flavor too much.
I made this about 6 hours before eating it, and refridgerated both sauce and meat.  The meat sliced nicely and my guests really enjoyed the meal. I served this with Diced campari tomatos, red onions(soak them in water first), medium cheddar. Unfortunatly theres no donair places in the neighbourhood and the ones in an acceptable driving distance dont compare, so my dinner guests wont stop harassing me to make them donairs again.

Yum! I did not deviate at all from the recipe & the flavour was excellent..very similiar to Turkish doner kebabs.  I only cooked the loaf 1 hour and it was perfect.  I did not make the sauce though...rather, I used a yogurt/garlic  and tomato combination that I got from a Turkish cookbook.  Thanks!

I love the donairs we get at a local Greek restruant. The flavour & texture of this meat recipe was very good. The suace on the other hand is wayyyy to sweet for my liking. I prefer a garlicky/yogurt sauce our restruant uses.
I will keep this recipe for the meat part of it.

I forgot how good Donairs were and these brought back memories of ones I enjoyed while living on the East Coast. Super easy to do in a food processor to get the right texture. The only thing I wish I could have done was shave the meat super thin so it would have stretched further. The sauce was perfect, add vinegar all at once and just give it a couple stirs to blend in.

Out standing.  Being from Nova Scotia, i spent many a nights on pizza corner eating some of the best donairs in the world.  This by far is the best donair i have found being so far from home.  The sauce was also incredible.

I have never had or made one of these before, but after looking at the pictures and reading the reviews I just had to try one.  It was pretty neat to throw the meat forcefully down and is a great recipe to make to get out any anger issues.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the meat and thought it was great.  I did not like the sauce because I am more used to a sauce that goes over gyros.  But my husband ate it and did not complain.  (he is the most picky person ever!)  Deff a 5 star recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

These were amazing! I was not going to make the sauce as sweet sauce is not my thing, but i figured if it was disgusting i would make some tsaziki.  It was actually ok.  Everyone else thought the sauce was really good though.  I will be making these again and again.  My husband wants me to make a really big one so he can carve it on a rotisserie!

We LOVED this. I made the sauce as listed, but made a few changes: I halved the sauce, used heavy cream, and added more vinegar. I think I used 5 tsp white vinegar for 6 oz heavy cream. I left the other measurements (of everything) the same. I served this in pitas (which fell apart, because I steamed mine in the oven, bad idea) with lettuce and red onion (which I pre-soaked in ice water for about 3 hours, to cut the bite). Everything worked exactly as described; the sauce thickened beautifully in the fridge (I did let it fridge for about 3 hours). The interesting thing about the donair sauce is this is the EXACT same stuff that Mexican restaurants around here give you with tortilla chips! I never knew how it was made, and every time I've asked I've been directed to cheese sauces, so this was a FANTASTIC find! (I have no idea why Mexican restaurants in Virginia serve tortilla chips with Eastern Canadian Lebanese sauces, but I was super glad to discover this recipe!) My husband proclaimed this sandwich "super tasty" :)

It's been a long time since i had a donair this good.  I use sweetened condensed milk, no added sugar, and add 1/4 cup vinegar.  Smoother the donair meat in sauce and make it nice and messy.  Wrap the whole think in tinfoil and enjoy.  It is meant to be messy, drippy and fun to eat.

We use it as a gyro: same basic seasonings, but with tzatziki sauce (also on this site), lettuce, tomato, and onion on flatbread from Trader Joe's. When I mix one pound of lamb and one pound of ground beef together with the spices, it tastes like it came from a restaurant.

This is the best tasting sauce recipe out there. Instead of using the entire can, try using only 1 cup of the evoparated mil instead. The sauce thickens faster and tastes great.

The meat was amazing! but I found the donair sauce too sweet, I will probably will omit any added sugar next time I prefer more of the garlic flavor to come through. Overall delicious recipe :)

All i can say is..WOW! We are from Belleville Ontario, where there is a great donair shop, in true East Coast style called Nova Deli. They got us addicted from our teens on, and when we moved to the Greater Toronto Area, we thought there would be a somewhere to get a good donair...We were wrong :-( Everytime we go back to our hometown we buy some of the meat and the sauce, BUT NO MORE!! lol. Ty, My husband loved it and actually ate a whole one before i had finished warming up more meat.(he had seconds:-) Topped with shredded cheese, tomatoes and onions. I just got a new KitchenAid food processor, so I actually mixed the meat and spices in it, baked it as directed, then chilled it before i sliced it. The sauce.../sighs with joy, was just amazing. Follow the directions, you will have a great dinner. Make extra and freeze, Donair pizza rocks btw.

I am in culinary arts at Vancouver Island University and it was my job to make something for the highschool kids. I pulled out this recipe because I have always wanted to try it and its much easier at school with all of the ingredients at your disposal. It was amazing. a huge hit... we sold out and the kids and teachers loved it. the only thing i would suggest is making it a larger thinner loaf as opposed to a heavfy thick loaf. it took really long to cook and was dried out because of this. thanks again. this was great.

Loved this recipe. Used equal parts ground lamb and ground beef for meat. Also only used 1 teaspoon of garlic powder in donair sauce.

I made this as a pizza using the brick oven pizza dough from this site, I used the sauce for dipping the crust. Am looking forward to trying as a sandwich with the leftovers which I have frozen.

My family and I love donairs, but don't buy them all that often or buy the pre-made ingredients to make them at hoe because it is so expensive.  A friend told me about this recipe.  Wow.  It is amazing.  Really easy, quick and inexpensive to make and looks and tastes just like the kind you buy.  I don't recommend using lean or extra lean round beef though.  It tends to be a bit drier than I would prefer, but medium is perfect.  The secret is in the pounding and throwing of the meat.  It gives it that perfect consistancy.  Plus it's fun!

Awesome!  I made the meat mixture using the food processor (as another reviewer suggested), and then baked it.  I let it sit in the fridge overnight, and sliced it up the next day for lunch.  Sliced so easily.  I was a little nervous making the sauce from plain evap. milk, so I followed another reviewers suggestion (2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk, 1/4 cup vinegar, 1/2 tsp garlic powder), and mixed it up.  Looked a little scary, so I put it in the fridge to thicken up.  I was amazed at how good the sauce tasted! The consistency was like mayonnaise. I wouldn't want much more than the 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, as that was plenty.  I put the meat (quickly fried) on the warmed pita, covered with sauce, thinly sliced red onion and tomatoes, and rolled up.  WONDERFUL!  We live in an area where we can't get these.  These were soooo good!  I think I will follow the other reviewers footsteps, and make a few extra loaves to stick in the freezer for when we have a donair attack.    Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Tasted Great!... My husband and I loved it!... If you want the meat to be smooth run it thru a food processor and then mix the meat and all the ingredients by hand in a steel bowl.  Splash a small amount of water on the pitas before warming them up on the frying pan you warmed the meat in, it gives them extra flavor.

Not bad at all!  Growing up in Halifax Nova Scotia, and being transplanted to Boston Mass in 2000 forced me to leave these sinful treasures behind....until now!  They're not exact, but !!!  They are close enough in a pinch! Sure beats Baked Beans!

Wow, thanks for sharing! We developed an addiction for donair's when we had a great shop closeby. When it closed down I tried a couple of recipes and nothing came close. This meat recipe is BANG ON! We serve it with Tzatziki sauce and  fresh pita's made with Peppy's Pita recipe from this site. Delectable!

I've tried a few donair meat recipes, and this is closest to the real thing. I'm from Nova Scotia too, and I sent this recipe to my brother and his friends who moved out West a few years ago, and desperately missed donairs from the Pizza Corner in Halifax. Needless to say, they thought it tasted just fine!
I wasn't crazy about the sauce, but the meat was fantastic. I think chilling it overnight made a big difference (if you can wait that long).

Finally I don't need to go and buy donairs.  This recipe is awesome and has the taste exactly right.  I never knew the sauce would be so easy.  I even used this to introduce a friend of ours from the states to the wonder of the donair and now she loves them too.

Delicious! I, too, am a transplanted Haligonian, and miss having a good old 'Pizza Corner' donair. Here in London there's only gyros, and although I like tzatziki, it has no place in my donair! This recipe is so easy, and tastes great. The extra processing of the meat (I used my food processor) and slamming it around awhile really made the texture, and the sauce was bang on. Thanks Dash...craving satisfied!

We discovered this recipe before Christmas and decided to try it for Christmas Eve as a treat--the sauce wasn't so hard to do, and it was amazing! Have already tried it again, will be experimenting for the easiest way to do. We miss Halifax!!

Yummie, yummie. This is the BEST recipe I have made and I have tried a few.  I made the donair meat to take up to the camp and everyone loved it. What I especially found helpful was the preparation of the meat by "throwing" it in a metal bowl.  You could feel the difference every time and I only ended up with 1 very small air bubble (my fault,I ended up losing count)and the meat turned out nice and compacted. Also, this is the best sauce recipe I have made. All others end up way too sugarery, clumpy and/or runny. Last thing - I'm a Maritimer (from NB) and this recipe is restaurant good. Thanks for sharing!!

The donair meat is seasoned perfectly. It tastes just like a donair should taste. I always double it so that I have plenty ready for donairs, subs and pizza. Yum.

I do make a slightly different sauce. It's fool-proof, very thick and tastes great.
2/3 cup canned sweetened condensed milk 
1/4 cup white vinegar 
1/2 tsp garlic powder 
Stir like crazy and chill.

The meat was good, but it took ages to cook. We had to cook it and then place it in the freezer to be able to slice it. The sauce was far too runny, had to go to the store and buy donair sauce. I did everything i could think of to thicken the sauce and it didn't work *beat it, whip it, cool it*. It's definitely a keeper recipe for us, in regards to the meat but it'll be something we make a few days in advance.

Great recipe, and flavours are bang on. I modified it to my taste and preferences by tripling the seasoning. I then put the meat mixture into a stand mixer and mixed on high speed for 5 minutes to beat up the proteins and get the dense sausage texture that the good donair shops have. I then formed the meat into a round cake pan that I greased and really pressed down to compact the meat even further. I put that under a 500 degree broiler for about thirty minutes flipping halfway through to really sear the loaf and get the maillard reaction going. It basically looked like a large hamburger patty with nice crispy bits on the outside when it was done. I let it cool for 10 minutes and sliced thin with a razor sharp knife. Served the meat on toasted flat bread with the donair sauce (made with half the sugar and a little extra garlic), fresh tomato, diced red onion, and aged white cheddar. Amazing!

hey Dash! 

Thanks for the brownie points I scored with my Nova Scotian Boyfriend this new Years EVE! He said it's Halifax in his mouth! I myself being from New West (B.C) thought I had had a donair, but boy was I wrong! I think I had been having the greek and middle eastern variations.  This turned out so goood, we both couldn't believe it! I prepared the meat and popped it into the oven. While the meat baked, we went off for a dog walk. When we returned an hour later the house smelled exactly like a donair shop. This made me so excited when making the sauce that I forgot I wasnt supposed to stir it too much so it did end up being a little runny like fruit yogurt, but was still amazing. I tried to combat the runny-ness by chilling it. It did thicken up a bit, but still did not meet my thickness expectation. I can't wait to make this again AS A MATTER OF FACT we have declared saturdays Donair Day :). Thank you! thank you! THANK YOU!!

near spot on, I have tried numerous recipe's for down home donairs and this one is by far the best, i used my kitchen aid mixer set on low while i added the spices then turned it to medium for a few mins to blend well and make the meat more pliable, turned out perfect, for the sauce tho i use 2/3 cup of sweetened condensed milk, 1/4 cup of vinegar and 1 tbsp of garlic powder, its always nice a thick.  Will use this recipe again and again, my new fav for my down home cravings, now to try to perfect the donairzerotti

One of my absolute favorites! The Donair is full of flavor and makes the world's BEST pita sandwich. I cool the Donair well and slice paper thin, then crisp the slices in a hot pan before loading up into a pita with chopped tomato, cucumber, and fresh mint. Drizzle with sauce and a squirt of fresh lemon. Add feta if you are feeling luxurious! Such a fantastic, straight-forward recipe.

The meat turned out well, I made it the night before and sliced and slightly fried it, I followed the directions to a tee, and my sauce was as runny as water....I am not sure, but should it not be the consistency of Mayo or sour cream?

This recipe is awesome! I just put the meat in my food processor, premixed the spices, poured the spice mixture in the food processor with the meat, and mixed away! That was I got the finely ground texture like donair meat is supposed to be. Regarding the sauce, I also premixed the sugar and the garlic together before pouring the milk in. Otherwise the garlic will ball up into chunks (kind of like flour). I'm really cheap, so I don't buy takeout much. I am SO GLAD to have learned how to make proper donair! :)

Great recipe for first time try. The only suggestion I could make is adding an 1/8 tsp of cumin to it for a little kick and to take meat after ingreidients have been blended and put it through a mixer or a blender so the meat comes out with a very smooth ((bologna like) texture and will be less likely to fracture upon slicing. Otherwise this is the best recipe that I've tried off the net to date. It's so cheap to make compared to what it costs in the store. You get 2/3 yield from original weight(un-cooked). It's like $10 or more for a lb of donair meat in any grocery store. It cost $3 to make.

These are a favorite in our house.  We prepare them a bit differenetly.  We put the pita on a baking sheet then add a couple of slices of pepperoni then slices of the donair meat, top with mozarella cheese and then broil them.  We then top with onions, lettuce, tomato and sauce and eat them with a knife and fork.  You can also make a donair pizza with the sauce on the bottom instead of tomato sauce.

Reminds me of a place in Edmonton "Charles Smart". The first donair place that my wife took me. 
Also to make the sauce do the 1/4c vinegar and only whisk it a few times. I can't remember who said this but it is the way to go.

this was great! my family loved them. i used more of the spices but not more of the oregano. i also used this sauce recipe instead (but it was too sweet i think but i have never have had the original!):

    2/3 cup canned evaporated milk
    2/3 cup sugar
    1/4 cup white vinegar
    1/2 tsp garlic powder 

Stir canned milk, sugar and garlic powder until sugar isdissolved. Add vinegar and continue mixing. The quicker you add thevinegar and the less you mix (I usually give the spoon 3 or 4 turnsaround the bowl), the thicker the sauce will be. Let sauce sit for atleast one hour in refrigerator before using. Eventually (hours to dayslater), the sauce may start to separate. DO NOT STIR IT. Simply skimthe thick sauce off the top.

One thing I do, because my sauce NEVER turns out thick enough- is to use a can of sweetened condensed milk, about 1/2 cup of vinegar, and a tsp. of garlic powder.  MY recipe you can stir to your hearts content and it will still be ridiculously thick. I grew up in Nova Scotia but we are a military family, and living EVERYWHERE has made my husband really miss donairs now that we live out west. This recipe for the meat is perfect!

Used turkey.  Instead of throwing it all over i used a metal cutter to make the meat finer. This did the trick!  The smell of it cooking had my wife drooling, and when i reheated in the microwave the coworkers were oohing and ahhing.  It smelled better than it tastes but still tasted good.  Am not sure what i am missing on this one, maybe a little more salt and frying it will do the trick.  Will be eating it again tonight with adjustments and will post my findings.

Tastes just like I remember all those years ago.  Thinly slice the meat and fry it in a pan to crisp/warm it before eating and then run the pita quickly under water and throw into the hot pan for a few seconds to soften it.

I assume this is the Canadian version of doner kebabs, but I tried not to compare the two at all when we ate it. I cut some of the salt, and the meat turned out wonderful-really moist and flavorful. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce though, I thought there was too much garlic powder (and I NEVER think there is too much garlic!), but since I've never had one of these, I can't compare it's authenticity. Mine never thickened, so it ran off the pita instead of adding a zip to the meat. It was still pretty good though!

This was amazing.  I had to stop myself from eating the whole loaf!!!  Instead of baking it in the oven, I wrapped it in tinfoil  with a few holes in the bottom and baked on the upper rack in the barbecue.

This is the real deal! The only change I made was poultry seasoning instead of Italian seasoning (I was out of Italian). It turned out so good, I keep making it that way. 
TIP: I use my kitchen aid with the paddle attachment, and beat it or 3 to 5 minutes and get the exact texture.
TIP:  I have also turned these into hburger patties, grilled them on the BBQ and serve it on a bun with the donair sauce, tomatoes and onions.

Based on previous reviews I did a combo of the food processor and knead/throwing-which was indeed quite fun!  The texture was good; it sliced thinly after being refrigerated for a day.  I doubled the spices, which might be overkill (and I like to really spice up my food).  I used all ground round, but I think 1/2 ground lamb and 1/2 ground round would be tastier/more authentic.  Fun recipe though!

I would like to say that this is a great recipe. It is very similar to the traditional donair that you would eat in Turkey. Yes, Donair is from Turkey and was introduced to Nova Scotia by Turkish-Immigrants in the 1970s. Over all, I would say that it's worth making.

This might be the best recipe I've tried from this site!   Definately restaurant quality! (I'm from the east coast of Canada where these are very popular ) For the donair sauce I only used 1/2 C sugar, 3 tsp vinegar and about 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  I thickened it on the stove with corn starch and then let it cool before serving.

This was super easy and super delicious!  My husband was skeptical, but he was pleasantly surprised by how good it was!  I put the meat in the food processor to blend it well (I read about  this on another site, to get the right texture) and that worked out pretty good.  The portion isn't very large though, so next time I'll double, or triple the beef.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe. I doubled the recipe as I have a lot of mouths to feed (6) It was so easy to make, and I admit I had a little fun smashing the meat in the bowl...hehehe. Next time I make this though, I will up the spice by a bit. It is a little milder than my local donair shop, and we prefer it a little stronger. The sauce turned out great, but I accidentally put in a bit of onion powder instead of garlic in my hurry getting this to the table...oops! When I added my vinegar, I poured a little at a time in and BARELY stirred it. It thickened beautifully. Also for those with issues with the sweetness of the sauce..it's supposed to be that way! It melds with the spices in the meat..yum!  I would love to try it. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe but had trouble with the sauce.  I used fat-free evaported milk and could not get the sauce to thicken.  I used more than the 4 tsp. suggested.  Next time will try regular evaporated milk and see what happens.

The meat looked and tasted awesome. I'm still always surprised when I make something I've only eaten in restaurants and it actually comes out tasting exactly like it's supposed to. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I didn't care for the the sauce. I followed it exactly and it set up nice and thick but it was soo sweet and sugary it turned my stomach. And my husband refused to eat it and ate the rest of his plain instead of with the sauce. I had to go buy some tzatziki so we could eat the leftovers and that was delicious.

We just had this for dinner and we weren't disappointed.  The meat turned out really yummy and I have always wondered how they made the sauce.  Now I know.  My sauce was a little on the thin side so I will have to make some adjustments there next time.  I doubled this recipe thinking I could freeze the left over for another night.  Yea right.  My husband and my daughter (who doesn't like Donair, but love these) had seconds.  Even my 3 yr old loved this and asked for more.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing Dashriprock.

Born in Nova Scotia, lived in NB and can't live without my donairs ! Simply divine ! Paradise ! lol  Good thing we have these recipes or we'd be flying to NS just to get some !  I'm in Quebec and the only ones I found here are nothing like a real donair. Not even worth buying. This pizza place says their donairs are like Pizza Time but NOT at all !  sorry for rambling on .. have mine in the oven right now and just wanted to say that last time I made some, I made my own pita bread with a recipe I found on Interent and they were so GOOD ! Well worth the work. They were soft and chewy like the ones at Greco, nothing like the store bought pitas, but then it's more work to get what you want. lol  * ok now I tried this one and this is the best recipe for the meat, didn't try the sauce but the meat had the same texture as in Pizza places.  I do agree on doubling the spices or adding a bit more if you like it spicy.  as for the Italian seasoning, I personally didn't like it much and would cut down or leave it out. Gives a different taste then to what I'm accustomed to.  Also, I always add some paprika and find it even tastier that way.

I know this recipe is not for gyro meat but that is what I used it for. Instead of this sauce, I used  Yia Yia's Tzatziki Sauce found on here. It turned out delicious. The only comment I would make is too use a high fat beef like 80/20. I think it holds the flavors better.

I can't give full stars because I altered it slightly.  I mixed Ground Turkey, Pork and Beef together and mixed it all in my Kitchen Aide then followed the recipe otherwise.  Turned out great!

This is awesome.  Made a double batch and froze one.  When I used the second one I made a sauce of 1 cup mayo; 1/4 cup sugar; 1 tbsp vinegar and garlic powder to taste.  Warmed up thinly sliced Donair meat in microwave and melted cheddar cheese on top.  Warmed up tortillas and put together.  It was even better the second time around.  Next time I will put tomatoes and onions in wrap.

Used the meat portion of this recipe to make (I guess) Gyros instead of these Donairs. Turned out just as good as I could have hoped! The meat ended up firm, so it could be sliced to put into a wrap and smothered in tzatziki sauce. Perfect, thanks!

Yes!  This is it! We made this earlier in the day and found it just not thick enough after 4 tsp of vinegar added slowly.  So I added a 5th tsp and that made it perfect for us.  With the meat, I had enough to make one small loaf but used the same amount of spices (i like punch) it was fun throwing the meat!  For now, the loaf sits in the fridge smelling good but chillin out till dinner.  Thanks for sharing!

No doubt in my mind.  This is a five star recipe.  And it's so easy.  Used to live in Halifax so have had some great donairs.  This one is right up there with the ones from Halifax.  Wouldn't change a thing except to triple the amount in order to have some to freeze for a second meal.  Huge thanks for this recipe. Round two of this review - made these a second time but multiplied the recipe times 5 so have some made ahead.  One of the comments was "This is a home run!"  Didn't change a thing other than making a larger batch.

This is so awesome! My tips: Use a food processor to mutilate the meat properly, that is so important. Also, use a meat thermometer so the meat isn't dry from overcooking. And, mix spices together first, seems unimportant, but DO IT! And homemade WW pita is a must.... wraps up so nice. THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!

Yum - These were spot on East Coast Canada donairs. The only thing I would note is that it took a few extra teaspoons of vinegar to get the consistency of the sauce thick enough.

My husband suddenly wanted to make his own donairs- he found this recipe- and created it himself.  It was FABULOUS. We both thought it tasted exactly like the donair place in town!  It's nice to be able to create it at home and know EXACTLY what is in it!!   The only thing we changed the second time around was the amount of sugar in the sauce. We only used 1/4 C because we thought the sauce was terribly sweet.   I also love adding Tzatziki and/or hummus.  If you like Donairs- this is a DEFINITE MUST TRY!! **BTW** the sauce is to be prepared COLD- do not make a flour and butter Roux as is suggested in past reviews (you'd need to prep it in a sauce pan for that).  A teaspoon of starch should help thicken, and it works great at room temp if you have a minute or two.

I use a very similar recipe to this one. One thing to note is that I don't shape into a loaf but rather flatten it out more to about 1 inch thick.  It seems to hold together better and is easier to cut.  Always cut the meat cold.  You don't heat the sauce, you put cold sauce on the hot meat & warm pita with tomatoes & onions.

Although I've never eaten a real donair, I can tell you that if you like gyros you have to try these.  The flavor of the meat is exactly the same.  My only problem was that my sauce never thickened up, but that's probably my fault.  Even my 3 & 6-year-old kids gobbled them up.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I'll now be able able to eat one of my favorite foods any time I want.

Oh my, this is reeeeeeally good!  No one in our part of Washington seems to have even heard of a donair (gasp!) and in our desperation to satisfy a craving we came across this recipe.  We were surprised at how good it turned out to be!  I do think I'll reduce the oregano very slightly next time I make it, but that is just a personal preference.  Very flavorful, moist and so yummy!  Thanks!

Its been 20 yrs since I lived in Truro Nova Scotia, where we had an amazing Donair shop. This receipe flashed me right back there in a heartbeat. I could not believe it. I can't wait to make this receipe for my mother when she visits next, I know she'll be floored!!

Well, I have to add my kudos to this recipe.  As a Nova Scotian expat, my husband had been requesting that I make donairs for years.  I finally decided to try this recipe & it was fantastic.  He really didn't expect them to taste like pizza corner donairs but they were incredibly close.  I think the key to getting the right consistency of the meat is the food processor idea.   Next time I make them, I will try to make the sauce a little thicker.  I made my own nann bread to use in place of the pitas. So nice to have a taste of home!

Easy to make --time consuming because of having to bake and refrigerate before re-frying but it's easy peasy, and tastes an awful lot like gyros meat --which is what I was hoping for! I served it with cucumber yogurt sauce instead of the weird sweet evaporated milk here, and it was good.

I'm planning on making this for supper...can't wait :) I'm in Nova Scotia and could order it out but i'm interested in trying it on my own. Our local Pizza joint, Recardo's, which is run by a Lebanese guy makes these deliciously. For those of you having trouble with the sauce, you could make what's called a Kafta with the same meat but spread Miracle Whip over the Pita instead. It turns out best if you heat the whole thing up in the over a bit before serving, makes it a little crispy and warms up the Miracle Whip and gives it a different taste...oh and don't forget to add Mozzarella :) Enjoy!

The perfect donair! I've got the meat cooking in the oven right now, it smells delicious. I always top with tomato and lettuce, sometimes onion too. Make your own fresh pitas for a special treat!

REALLY GOOD!
I was amazed at how the meat turned out.  We chilled the cooked loaf in the refrigerator for about 5 hours and then we thinly sliced it before eating.  I was thankful for the picture, because with growing up in Chicago, we don't have Donairs.  We have Gyro's.  So the picture helped explain how you're supposed to eat them considering the directions do not explain that.  After we sliced the meat we fried the slices in olive oil for a little bit to warm them up.  They were really good.  Will definitely make this again.

Wow.  I went to school in Montreal and frequented a small place called Kojacks . . . Greek fast food.   I moved to Toronto many years ago . . . never found the right taste here. . . I bought a couple of pounds of hamburger just before deciding to do a low carb diet after Christmas . . . decided to search for Yero, or Donair . . . this is exactly the taste I need.  Thank you.

Utterly unbelievable replica of take away shop donair ,and much less greasy!! I used lamb mince and it was gorgeous. Will save us quite a bit of cash in the future as donair sandwiches cost about £4.50 a time at our local take away 
As for the sauce, it was like putting a creamy sweet desert topping on top and ruining perfection. Pure sugar!!!I'll stick to sour cream based garlic sauces in future. This aside, it was a hands down winner.

This recipe is the bomb! I just moved to Ontario from Dartmouth and this is better then any "shwarmas" you buy up here that are the closest thing to donairs. I shredded some cheese and put it on top too.

Have to agree with everyone,  you need to make about 10lbs at a time and freeze.  Some how my freezer loses one or two after a visit from my sister.

Made it and loved it. Donair meat really is like its own meat. For the sauce, it should be made known that adding garlic is an option. Donair sauce can be eaten both ways, for those who love garlic or hate it!

Donairs are by far my favorite food and I've had a lot of them. This recipe is great. It actually tastes even better than any donair I've ever had in a restaurant. The only difficult thing about it is slicing the meat thinly. That is key. Other than that I like to heat it up with an extra bit of the cayenne myself. Also, I found it easiest to keep it at the 4 serving size..I tried to double the recipe and it did not turn out well. The meat began coming apart.

I followed the recipe exactly including throwing the meat.  Perfect texture. I am from NB and this is as good as Greco that I crave from time to time.  My BF never had these before and loved them too.

The donair itself was amazingly like the stuff you get in restaurants (otherwise known as Gyro).  I didn't try the sauce - don't like the idea of a sweet sauce. I love Tzastiki sauce, so that's what I used.
Will definitely make again!

This was delicious!! After cooking I did wrap in foil and place in fridge overnight. I then took thinly sliced pieces and heated/browned in some olive oil before eating in a pita bread topped with sauce, red onions and tomatoes. Wasn't able to get the sauce thick enough so I'll keep trying but really enjoyed this recipe.

I made this yesterday, and ate it today.  I didn't realise how simple it was to make donair meat... this one's a keeper.  I suggest even making the sauce the day before, refrigerating it to let the flavour settle.

I’m still giving this recipe a 5 star even thought I couldn’t get the sauce to thicken.  We have donairs pretty often a Greco a restaurant that makes donairs, but it’s nice to be able to make them at home. And guys the sauce is suppose to be sweet that’s what makes it so good with the spice meat.  If you have never had it before I can see how it’s a little different but give it a chance, you might not like it all that much at first but if you have it a few times you will get addicted.  You can make so many different things with this sauce and meat, you can make a donair pizza, sub, burger, and it’s all good.  We like to put lettuce on our donairs. Thank you Dash

The meat was very good. I just think the sauce was way to sweet. We used sour cream instead. Will make the meat again though.

Fantastic!!  I have been craving donairs since moving to Boston, and this was perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used my meat grinder to grind the meat twice, and added 4 Tablespoons of vinegar to the sauce, stirring just enough to mix.  Yummy!!!

I've never heard of this bizarre dish either!  But it must be similar to the fare at the "doner kebab" shops all over England.  There, the huge loaf of meat is on a rotating vertical spit and is scraped off.  I would think the sauce here is an attempt to recreate the yogurt sauces used at the shops, perhaps before yogurt was available in Nova Scotia. Anyway, I plan to try it!

This recipe is fantastic! It turned out great and the meat was easy to slice nice and thin. I didn't even cool it down that much. I think the trick is really working the meat. Thanks for the great recipe. I will definitely make this again.

I made it exactly like the recipe calls for and served it with: Street Taco Tortillas (3 inches and thicker than usual); Diced tomato.

The flavor was good, but the sauce is a monstrosity, and here is why:

Far too much sauce compared to the rest of the recipe. I had to throw away about 4/5 of the sauce (not joking). It is so potent that you only need a few spoonfuls per serving, and the recipe creates almost 1 pint of sauce. 

The sauce doesn't thicken at all. It is just liquid, making this a nightmare to eat. The sauce is as sticky as pancake syrup. No fun!

So the flavor was fine, and it was a good one-off, but I won't be making this ever again because it is a pain to eat and it is just wasteful. I'll stick with the more traditional Lebanese Donair that uses a tahini sauce.

I'm from New Brunswick and this donair meat tastes EXACTLY like commercial donair meat. And the sauce is spot on. It's wonderful!

One thing I would add - when making it at home I wet the pita (I turn on the tap and splash each side quickly through the stream) and bake the pitas until warm. It'll both heat AND soften them, so they're easier to roll without breaking.

My husband found this recipe a couple of years ago, and we have never written up a review for it until now.
This is the BEST recipe! My husband and I live in Texas, but he is from Nova Scotia and was so excited when he made this recipe and found that it took his taste buds right back home.  He makes no changes to the recipe, and everything comes out perfect!  He got me hooked on these things, if you haven't tried this... make it today (or as soon as you can)!  5 + stars!!!

I am a Nova Scotian girl... Born and raised. Have been in the USA for 10 years craving Donairs and going home once every year or two and indulging in a large with extra sauce.  I found this recipe and this has satisfied my cravings on about 5 occasions. My children and boyfriend love it! One tip..don't substitute the canned milk for no name. Use carnation only! I usually triple the recipe and use about 2 lbs of ground beef and 1 lb of ground turkey. Really work the meat well. I use my hands and fist, the. Work it into two loves and put them on  a baking pan with aluminum foil. I flip the meat about half way through the cooking time.  If u have a electric meat cutting knife I would use it to slice the meat once it's done.  I then throw it in a frying pan to crisp it up a bit.  Enjoy!!!!

I'm sorry for the low rating.  There's nothing wrong with the recipe itself, it all worked out as I assume it should have, but we just didn't care for this at all.  I was intrigued by the recipe having never heard of it, and we love gyros, so I wanted to try this.  I followed to the letter, but there's too much oregano for our tastes, and the sauce...well, it's definitely not to our tastes.  Far too sweet and very strange when you aren't accustomed to it, I guess.  If you love these, you'll love this recipe, I'm sure, but we couldn't eat them and ended up eating egg salad on our pitas.

I share this with all my Nova Scotia friends who have moved away and it's always a hit. Also if you have a jerky gun and a food dehydrator make yourself some donair jerky.

So good!  Thank you, from a displaced Nova Scotian.  Made it just as is, made sure to knead and smash the meat really, really well so it is smooth.

My dad owns a Donair Shop in Sherwood Park Alberta. I moved to Ottawa and unfortunately, donairs are not a big deal out here. Craving donairs, I tried this recipe and was soo happy with how it came out. It's delicious and as close to the real deal as I've come across. Thanks for posting!

We really love gyros & I went into this recipe knowing it was not quite the same as gyros but was anxious to try it. The meat was tasty, cooked it on a broiler pan & it was flavorful & moist, not dry like some reviewers said, but I did use ground beef with a high fat content. I believe my sauce came out as thick as it was supposed to be(had a consistency like Greek yogurt) following the directions exactly, made  ahead of time & it sat in the fridge for around 2 hours, think I saw a review said that it had to be used immediately or it goes thin but mine seemed to get even thicker after being in the fridge. However, the sauce must be an acquired taste, we thought it was really weird having the sweet-tasting sauce on there, perhaps because we're so used to eating gyros, & I wish I had prepared a tzatziki sauce instead. I may make the meat again with tzatziki sauce, not exactly like gyros but quite tasty & I like that it uses cheaper ground beef instead of lamb.

I first tried these things in Ottawa by force of my friend. Man, I'm glad she made me. There's nothing good around here, so I make this instead! Soooo gooood! Replace the evaporated milk with coconut milk and only add enough sugar to sweeten to your liking (just a little too much sugar for me) and it's even better. this is seriously the best recipe ever. got to be my favourite food. I made an account just to say this, haha!

Being that I am from Halifax and living out west, you could say that I am a little picky about my donairs. In fact, I don't buy them here because you can't get a good Halifax donair, until now! Try this recipe folks. Its the closest thing you will find to a slice of the east coast! Make sure not to cheap out on your pita bread either. Buy the good stuff and steam it in a frying pan with a touch of oil before rolling up! Enjoy...

We're ex-pats from Nova Scotia to Alberta---and BOY do we ever crave 'real' donairs!! This recipe is spot on! I use red chili flakes in mine, and white pepper as well as black. We like spicy in our house. I often double (or triple) the recipe and freeze the raw loaves for my sweetheart to bake when needed. 

Also--for something different, I sometimes add 1tsp of "Bay spice" which is equal amounts of Ground bay leaves, coriander and fennel seed. This adds a bit of 'sausage-like' flavour which we also enjoy. Just a little change for a some variety.
Thanks Dash!!

Using Dartmouth Donair as the standard for all donairs sold in Canada, this recipe hits the mark.  Anybody who has had a Canadian east coast donair will love this recipe.  I have made this several times and through trial and error I recommend the following:
a.  use regular ground beef, lean makes the meat too dry and the fat in regular ground really adds flavour;
b.  LET THE MEAT COOL before slicing; slice THIN;
c.  save some of the pan drippings and fry the slices using about a tablespoon of the drippings until browned(2-3 minutes);and
d.  make sure to use Lebanese style flat bread pita not Greek style pita.  Makes a big difference!
Now enjoy these fabulous sandwiches!!!

This recipe is awesome!! Reminds me of donairs I had growing up on the east coast. I made two loaves for my superbowl party and they were a huge hit. Everyone wanted the recipe. I have one question though, is there any way to make the sauce thicker? I cut the sugar back to a 1/3 cup and now I can't get the thickness out of the sauce and just get a runny mess. Tastes great, but would be better thicker..........any suggestions??  I tried cornstarch but it affected the flavour.

I love this! Best way to make it taste like take out is to brush the pitas with a little water and heat in frying pan or if your not scared of a little fat. Save the drippings from the meat and fry the pita in it! My boyfriend swears it makes all the difference in making them taste like they are from our fav take out

Another person from Halifax here. :) After reading the great reviews , I thought I'd try this recipe to make donair burgers for a summer party. It did not disappoint! I took the recommendation to use the paddle on my stand mixer and beat the meat to get the texture right. The combination of spices is perfect to achieve the donair flavour. I formed the meat into slider burgers, and barbequed them until well done. (donair meat is always better with a crust) I also served them with chopped tomato and onion, the sauce (I cheated and bought sauce from the local donair shop) and slider buns/mini pitas. They were a hit at the party, with none left. I doubled this recipe to male about 30 sliders.

I live in Halifax and this is BETTER than greasy shop donairs. The sauce is perfect if you use 4 TBSPS of vinegar added all at once and do not stir it too much. I slice the meat  very thin and just throw some in a pan to heat it when I want one - try cooking the onions a little in the pan with the meat - delicious! BEST donair meat I have ever had and I have had alot!!!!

There is something amazingly cathartic about slamming a hunk of ground beef repeatedly upon your counter top. I also mixed it initially with my hand mixer, as I don't have a food processor. The texture was pretty much perfect given the combination of the two. I haven't had a donair in years, since I was last visiting Halifax. I saw this recipe in someone's recipe box, and my mouth started to water as my head filled with memories of the meal.  Goodness, this is delicious. Spot on. Exactly what I was craving. I could hardly muster the resolve to let the meat cool for slicing.

Great recipe...  I've made this many many times and I like adding way more spice.  Also to make the sauce come out perfect you have to use CONDENSED milk.  I know Eagle brand is the most common but you can just as easily use the generic stuff.   Condensed milk is really thick and you just need to add vinegar to dilute it.  Lot easier than trying to make evoporated milk thick :)  Hope that helps folks.

I guess I'm just not a donair fan, this is the first time i've ever tried one and the sauce just didn't work for me.  I didn't like the mix of intense sweetness w/garlic.  just wasn't my thing.

Great recipe, however not identical to the ones that I buy... that is to be expected though since you are using ground beef and an oven instead of a rotisserie! Worth trying if you're craving donair and don't live near a place that sells them!!!

Very, very good. I mixed it by hand only and the texture was very good. I would add more garlic next time though. The sauce was very thin and runny, but I used fat free milk and splenda so that may be why. The flavour was great though, and I just ate it open faced (onion and tomato on top) with a fork and knife due to the messiness of it all (I split the pita in half to reduce the carb intake as well). Delicious.

Very authentic, one of the rare recipes that resembles the real thing. very impressed, also the meat held together very well, like at the donair shops, i followed the instruction to "throw" the meat with force...haha....good way to release tension...although the sauce was a bit too runny and made triple of what was needed, or else i would have rated 5 stars, i think at the shops the sauce is more thick, but the taste is very similar! Delicious, and i kept this one in my cookbook for the future

YUM! SO good. Followed recipe exactly and it was perfect with some tomatoes and red onions. I've never had this before so the sauce was a bit strange to me, but I'll probably use some tsaziki next time. I made it in the morning and let it cool completely in the fridge then sliced and fried it to warm it up. YUM!

Really enjoyed this recipe. I live in Fredericton, NB, so donairs are always available. But it's nice to be able to make it at home too. I found the recipe a tad too salty, so that would be the only real change I would make - reducing the salt a bit.

I made this for dinner a few weeks ago. Most of my family had never had donair's before, and I only had it once before (when I was pregnent and craved it, although I had never had one before...). They turned out FANTASTIC! The meat was fabulous, but the sauce was really REALLY sweet. We didnt use too much. I also let it boil for a little while to allow it to thicken up. Overall it was a very excellent recipe, which I will be making more often. I was amazed at how well the meat stuck together, and I was able to slice thinly!

I tried this recipe because my family loves donairs and though they are abundant in Calgary, Canada where we live, I thought it would be fun and handy to try to make them at home.  My 16-year daughter made up the recipe which was very simple.  The only ingredient we didn't have was onion powder, so we used onion salt instead which didn't diminish the flavour at all.  The sauce was very runny when made despite adding some flour and butter as someone had suggested, but the flavour matched the sauce from shop-bought donairs I thought and donairs I've found always have the sauce dripping from them when you eat them...that's part of the fun of eating them!  In all, a fantastic keeper of a recipe and we will definitely make these again when we have a donair craving!  Thanks for submitting this easy, economical and tasty recipe!

This is really good! WOW! I doubled up the spices in my beef as I like a lot of flavour. The only suggestion I would make would be to change the preparation of the sauce. If you gradually add the vinegar, you wont get a nice thick sweet sauce. Instead, add the vinegar all at once and give it just a few whisks. Over stirring it will make it too thin.

thank you DASH... I made this recipe last night and all I had to say was WOW..... I am totally satisfied.  I moved to Toronto 5 years ago from Edmonton to find out that there was not one DONAIR shop in toronto. In Edmonton there was at least 5 in the area i lived in. SO now being 4 months pregnaunt and craving donairs, I was going crazy trying to find an awesome recipe. And THIS most definetly is the one. Add some mozzerella cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onions and lots of sweet sauce and u have the BEST homemade donair ever... THank YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!

The donair meat was fabulous.  I made it exactly as the recipe says. However, I wasn't fond of the sauce.  So I used my old sweetened cond. milk sauce recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Love donairs!! When I found this recipe I was soooo excited, but skeptical. I thought it was going to be a lot more difficult to make than it actually was. It tastes really good, and does the trick when I get a craving for some good down home food.

Don't forget when you assemble your donair (with sliced onions and tomatoes) to top it with shredded mozzarella and toss under the broiler to get it all melty. Yum!

I'm originally from Liverpool, NS. I've been looking for donair meat that tastes like the A1 Pizza place there for so long. The sauce in this recipe is a perfect match to theirs, but there's something missing from the meat. It's close, though. I'll have to experiment the next couple times I make it. A1's has a garlic taste to it, so I'll try adding more garlic powder. Still, a great recipe either way.

I never heard of a Donair until I stumbled on this while searching for meatloaf recipes. I approached this with some hesitancy, especially the sauce. My fears were unwarranted. This turned out great. My wife was raving about this discovery. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and followed the advice left by others regarding chilling the meat before slicing it, using it in a pita bread, etc.

This was good I enjoyed it. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used ground turkey instead of beef. i don't care for ground beef. and I accidently used poultry seasoning instead of italian seasoning. The sauce however didn't thicken up and remained very thin. I will make this again.

These were really good...not awesome but really good.  Made them with Peppy's Pita Bread (from this site) and was a great meal.  The sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste but still really good.

My husband was born & raised in Halifax but hasn't been able to get back there for years.  When I found this recipe, I knew I had to surprise him with these for dinner.    He said they are exactly like the ones he used to get!  I was so pleased that with Dash's donair recipe I could bring a taste of home to my handsome, wonderful, caring, perfect husband!  Thank you so much Dash for sharing this great recipe with us!!

WOW, if I could give it 6 stars I would.
While stationed in Germany in the mid 80's I ate alot of kebab sandwiches.  After returning to the states I tried some gyros but the taste wasnt the same.

Fast forward 20 years.  While watching Trailer Park Boys I noticed the boys would frequent a place called King of Donair.  Not knowing what a Donair was I searched the web.  After finding out what donair was I knew I hadn't been eating Gyros kebab in Germany but, Donair!

I found this recipe and gave it a try. 
I made a 2 pound batch and formed 2 one pound loaves.  I baked them at 300°F under the broiler for 75 minutes.  My probe thermometer gave me a reading of 160°F at this time.  Perfect.

I actually like these better than the slab meat one I got in Germany.  Easy and cheap to make.

I've never heard of a donair but came across this recipe while looking for something different to serve friends on a movie night.  I read the reviews so I knew I would not be getting what some would have expected to be a gyro.  I followed the recipe for making the meat mixture exactly and I must say, these were very easy and inexpensive to make. I served 8 people and we all loved them!  I used the fool-proof sauce recipe that RAYNEBOW spoke of in his review (2/3 cup canned sweetened condensed milk, 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  Mix thoroughly and chill) and it turned out great!  Definately a keeper!

Tasted awesome!  I severely overcooked the meat (2x45 mins does not equal 1 hr 15 mins!) so next time I'll do it right...but I can tell this will be a keeper for sure.  

The sauce was quite runny for my liking but tasted fantastic.  I'll try adding sour cream as someone suggested to thicken it a little.

Thanks for the recipe dash!

I absolutely love the Donair part of this recipe. I used ground sirloin because it was on sale and cooked the loaf for a little less time than the original recipe suggests. It's great that you can really get physically involved with making this loaf and the result is flavorful and surprisingly moist. I chopped up tomato, cucumber and white onion to go inside the whole wheat pita. Next time, I'll use bread that's more like Naan or a softer, chewier pita. 
I wasn't a fan of the sauce... it was too sweet for my taste. Something salty and/or tangy, like sour cream, hummus or dill yogurt, would be a better pairing for the meat.

Excellent recipe. My local donair shop closed recently, so you've saved my crave. Serve wrapped in a grilled pita bread with white cheddar, onion, and fresh tomatoes. (Wrap your donair in a sandwich bag so it doesn't drip)

Surprisingly simple. Didn't know what this was until I read some other reviews (I'm not a Canadian - from the reviews it looks like that's where its from). This Gyro-like meal is excellent change of pace - the sauce is tasty but I like Tatziki (white sauce) better - actually added feta, lettuce, tomato and put on warmed pita.  I was unsure about how big to make the loaf but it only makes one size as a loaf really. Make sure to slice meat pretty thin as it has lots of flavor. I might try ground pork/veal/beef to see how that changes things.

Excellent! I made two big batches, sliced it after it was cold and then froze it for a quick meal on a hectic day.
Thanks!

I was looking for a recipe for ground beef that wasnt a meatload f hambuerger recipe, and came across this one. Everyone remarked how it tasted just like our local restaurants donairs. Incredible recipe with NO leftovers.

I've given it 4 stars only because I thought it was dry. I will try it again with adding some lamb or pork to it. Other than that we liked it. We used to have Donairs in Windsor Ont. The owners were from N.S. I also have had doner kebab in Holland. My husband lived there for a year and I'd have as many Doners as I could while I visited him. One more thing about Donairs, we are used to the sauce that they use for Shawarma it's garlicy and not sweet.

Thank you for the recipe!  It's very easy to make and tastes delicious... just like the 'real' donairs in this area (New Brunswick).  It was my first time making donairs and I'll definitely use this recipe again.  The sauce didn't turn out very thick (even after whisking for 3-4 minutes), maybe I had to let it set ... I'll try again.

Interesting recipe.  I seemed to have overcooked mine so it came out a little dry.  I found the meat better on a french roll than on a pita though as my sauce ruined the pita.  My sauce came out a but runny though, make sure you follow the comment below on cooling the sauce in the refrigerator, it seems to help it thicken.

Delicious! Working the meat is a little labour intensive but worth it. I've made these quite a few times for family birthdays. I'm from the maritimes, but live in a different province and the closest place to me that makes good donairs is over an hour away. I'm so happy to have this recipe.

I have made this recipe over a dozen times and every time it’s perfect. I have mixed the meat by hand but I do Prefer to Use my kitchen aid mixer with the paddle. I also double the recipe and make donair pizza with the other half.

Overall a good recipe but the sauce was much too sweet for our west coast taste buds,  1 or 2 tablespoons of sugar would be enough for us. It doesn't specify but I would use regular ground beef, lean came out very dry. Also, I used 750g of ground beef and it was definitely done before 1hr 15mins so check early. I had no problem at all with the sauce thickening when I added vinegar. I wonder if other reviewers might have used a low fat evaporated milk instead of regular?

This was AMAZING!!! I’d never had donairs only gyros and these are so different and delicious. The spicy beef with the cold sweet creamy sauce is such a wonderful combination. I just took a huge flour tortilla (that’s what I had on hand) and warmed it for 25 seconds to make it easier to wrap up. I added the beef, shredded lettuce, diced fresh tomatoes and topped with the cream sauce then wrapped it all up like a burrito. SO GOOD easy to eat and not too messy.

A failure-even the sauce was not good. I used to love getting donairs in Ontario. I may try to make them again using a different recipe.

I did my university degree in Halifax, and ate many donairs in my time there. Now I live in northern Manitoba where donairs like this do not exist. This recipe helps quell those donair cravings. Just like the ones I used to get on Pizza Corner. Excellent recipe!

I grew up in Halifax, enjoying real deal donairs. This recipe is the closest I have ever found to the Halifax favourite. We make it frequently! And sometimes we just make the sauce to have with homemade garlic fingers.

This is even better than the memories of donairs. We used to get them two or three times a week at the shopping centres, but they just disappeared. Them came the gyro and we were happy to see them until we tasted them. Thought that I would never find the original donair. Thank you, when your instructions are followed exactly ,it is as god as I remember.

I've never tried authentic Donairs, so I don't have anything to compare this recipe to.  My family and I really enjoyed them.  Next time I will cover the meat while cooking (it was a bit dry even though I cooked it in the broiler pan), and I'll either reduce the sugar in the sauce or add extra vinegar (It was a tad too sweet for my taste).  We absolutely loved them with melted mozzarella, lettuce, onions and tomatoes.  Warming the pitas in a little oil in the pan is a must.  We will be making this again.  Thank you!

Meat was delicious but pretty dry. Did not make the sauce, so can't offer an opinion on it. Excited to try this spice mix on a meatloaf or some burgers.

After moving from Calgary to the Greater LA area, I started to miss that Canadian-Mediterranean flavor. I came across this recipe, and started making it. I'm a total cooking rookie, so I was worried on how to prepare the beef, but I somehow managed to pull it off. Surprised with how everything turned out, it tasted like home. For the sweet sauce, I used condensed milk instead of evaporated. I find that it's a little easier to make, and if you want the sauce on the thick side, this is the way to go.

This was really good. I was surprised by how easy it was to make. I used dried oregano instead of powder because it's what I could find. I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing

You should use red onion and the sauce will need three tablespoons of vinegar.  I have made this any times; fantastic and much cheaper than ordering-in.

I've been using this recipe for over a decade now, and have had made a few changes.  Italian seasoning contains oregano, so I only use that.  I prefer making it with lamb instead of beef.  Cook it to medium rare, 135 degrees in the center, takes about 30 min.  Make it a day ahead of time and let it chill in the fridge overnight.  When you're ready to eat, slice it up and pan fry the slices to desired doneness.  I don't usually make the sauce.  Eat it with tzatziki sauce and call it a gyro, or toum and call it shawarma.  It is awesome with freshly made pitas baked on a pizza stone.

I haven't tasted the end product yet but the recipe for the sauce should read CONDENSED MILK not evaporated!  I just wasted two cans of evaporated milk to find that out.  Please fix the recipe.

Too much oregano. The Italian seasoning already has it in it too. This tastes like a big ol' meatball. Cut out the Italian seasoning and add paprika.

The whole family loves these donairs. I make 3 meat loaves at a time and slice and freeze the other two. I use my Kitchenaid with the regular mixing attachment to beat it rather than slamming it on the counter, which becomes tiring. With this technique, it's a breeze.

If this tasted like Halifax donairs  it would not be as popular as it is.  I made the meat exactly as specified and overcooked is being polite....it was like eating cardboard, inedible.  The sauce was ok but needed a little cornstarch  to  thicken to desired consistency.

I'm not sure what people think a "Donair" is, but this is NOT it!  I lived in Halifax for a number of years and love the Halifax Donairs, and find this recipe not even close. This is simply, dry ground beef in a pita with a canned milk sauce. Not impressive if you ever had a real Donair or Gyros.

I gave it five stars mainly for the meat and the method of cooking it; it turned out fantastic!  I doubled the loaf by adding a pound of lean ground lamb.  I also have some Aegean seasoning on hand, so I used that instead of the Italian.  The sauce was good, but, I will reduce the amount of  sugar next time, maybe to 2 Tb.  I found that I was adding a lot more vinegar because it was too sweet for me.  Really great recipe and my kids asked me to do this again soon!

First time I ever made my own donair meat and it turned out frickin great!!! I did buy higher quality spices and feel it made a difference. I didnt use the sauce from here, instead I used the recipe for maritime donair sauce and substituted the garlic powder for fresh crushed garlic and that made even more of a difference! I will definitely make this again!!!

Delicious!  My sauce turned out too thin; I have since read the reviews that give detailed instructions on how to make it, so I hope it will turn out better next time.  And there will definitely be a next time!  I also plan to use the "throw down" technique on other ground meat recipes.

Living with two Maritimers, I was nervous to try this.
Will have to come back to review the meat, but HUGE TIP for the sauce: If you just whisk in the sugar, the texture is grainy. 
Using a small steel bowl, place it in a pan with boiling water and whisk until the sugar dissolves so it's smooth like it's supposed to be (It's ok to let the bottom of the bowl touch the pans surface). Roughly about ten minutes, watching and whisking constantly to avoid burning. The ratio of ingredients is spot on for the sauce and the guys LOVE IT.!

I have made this recipe a number of times. Not having a donair shop within 300km of me had me itching to try it. I experimented the first couple times to make sure it tasted right, and couldn't believe how close it was!
The only thing I noticed following the recipe was that the consistency is more like meatloaf. And almost too beefy.

I modified the recipe a bit, and multiplied the recipe to a batch using 10lbs of meat. I made mine using 50/50 ground pork, and ground beef. I had the meat shop triple grind the meat for me, I also used a couple tablespoons of transglutimase(meat glue). I put the whole thing into a large zip lock bag and formed it into a TIGHT log, and left it in the fridge for an hr to allow the transglutimase to do its thing before cutting the bag off and roasting it on convection at 350F.  

This resulted in a flavour, and consistency more of the donair meat I was used to.

I will definately be making this again, and again, and again.

THANKS DASH!

Tastes like home!
I throw all the ingredients into my food processor and process it a few times until it's smooth.  
Also, when making the sauce, I mix everything together except the vinegar.  Then I pour all of the vinegar in at once and give it one or 2 stirs.  Over stirring will make the sauce thin.  I let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  It should be thick enough that a spoon will stand up straight.  Delish!

No changes! This was an amazing recipe. Almost the same donair you get in Nova Scotia! Fabulous sauce, meat was succulent, can only serve with onion and tomato. Can't make this into a wrap. Thank you!

My husband and I just returned from a trip to Nova Scotia. While we were there, we discovered Donairs and we absolutely loved them. When we returned home, we had to find a recipe to curb our craving. This recipe is spot on and so very easy to make. We made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was amazing!!!!

I made this last night and my family absolutely loved this dish! 
Having never been to Halifax, and not at all familiar with the dish,  I spotted this in the AllRecipes features and decided to try it because we do enjoy gyros and this seemed similar. 
It is not difficult to prepare, and in fact I found it to be a very convenient weeknight dinner because I baked the meat the previous evening while cooking dinner.  So, I had a nicely chilled loaf to start with, and only had to prepare the sauce and cut up the onions and tomatoes.  After that it was quick to slice and warm the meat and assemble the donairs.   Having watched the ingredients going into the sauce, my kids were a little skeptical, but we all tried it and it did not disappoint.  A fun, messy, delicious meal. 
Thanks for introducing us to this wonderful dish!

No need to go out for fast food donairs, these rock!  We have a fantastic donair shop in Burlington but this recipe is just as good if not better!  I stuck to the recipe and its great.  Have made them a few times and they impress everyone.

Trying to satisfy a family member's craving for Donair eaten in Berlin, Germany, & ran across this.  Not the same Donair, but rated it delicious anyway.  A bit on the salty side, though not inedibly so.  Definitely throw the ground beef mixture down to compress before shaping--I threw it into a large glass bowl multiple times and it seemed to do the trick.

This is the best Halifax Donair recipe out there!!! I've made this many many of times. I live in BC but originally from Cape  Breton and you can't find any donair out here that tastes anything close to it. So happy I found this recipe! 
I've made the donair sauce many of times... Some turned out and some did not (was just liquid not thick like it should be)... If anyone is having trouble with the donair sauce there's an awesome YouTube video, which helps me every time!

I'm from Halifax and I used to eat his Donairs. I haven't had one since I was 14 years old. There is nothing like a Donair. I want to thank you for returning to my childhood even if for just a brief moment.

I had never heard of these, but was looking for  a fairly easy ground beef recipe. I'm glad I tried these. They are amazing! My wife and daughter loved them, too, and we have already decided that these must be made again.

The moment I bit in to this donair it took me to another time and place (the East Coast matey!).
I used a mix of 50/50 lamb/beef which was AWESOME. I also shorted the ingredients a bit (next time I won't though because it would've tasted even better following the measurement instructions).
The sauce was excellent. I pondered adding chopped onions right into the sauce but keeping them separate and getting that burst of flavours is the way to go.
This recipe is just fantastic!

Excellent and I have made it several times exactly as is.  Make my own flatbread for serving.  Have served it several times to guests and have had rave reviews.

Very good results. The meat was soft and very flavourful.The only problem for us was the sauce. We found it way too sweet and garlicky. The amount of garlic powder in the sauce was too much, considering the meat already had lots of garlic flavour. We will probably make a cucumber mint yogurt raita instead. Many reviewers said this sauce was very authentic and I'm sure it is, but not for our Toronto taste buds.

My first attempt and it was a pleaser. I didn't have a steel mixing bowl to slam the meat down so I used a cookie sheet. It worked out well and the meat sliced and looked like I ordered it from a local pizza joint here in Halifax. The donair sauce is bang on and plenty left over. Next time I make this I'm going to make some naan bread over pita bread way more flavor and just awesome taste.

I made this last night and was really surprised how easy it was to make! I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out beautifully. You really do have to pound the meat into the bowl but I didn't mind. It was a great way to get out some stress! I made the meat and sauce a few hours ahead and all I had to do was warm the pitas, heat the meat and add the veggies. There was not a morsel left! Five stars! My only problem is I have so much sauce left, I hope I can freeze it for next time, this was so good that I'll be putting into my meal rotation! Next time I'm going to try making a pizza with it! Thanks for the great recipe.

I cannot thank you enough for this recipe.  This instantly became a favorite in my house.  Tastes exactly like what you would get at a top donair shop.  I recommend doubling the recipe....I doubled it and it was just my boyfriend and I, and he finished almost all of it.  It's too delicious not to want more and more.  The sweet sauce is just like you get at a donair shop, too.  Yum yum yum! I can't wait to make them again!

I am not from the eastern provinces and have never had Donair so I didn't know what to expect.  I ran across this recipe while looking for something to make with ground beef.  I had fun throwing the meat down but was a little dubious of the amount of sugar in the sauce.  The end product was really nice, but a little sweet.  If you don't like the sweetness you can eat the meat without the sauce and then it is more like a gyro.  My meat was a little drier than I prefer so next time I will shorten the baking time by about 5 minutes.  Thanks for the fun experience.  Next time I am in the Maritime Provinces I will try one at a Donair shop to see if mine was authentic.

I have made this a few times. My husband and son love it. Love being able to satisfy the craving without needing to go to the local pizza place for one. Meat keeps well in the freezer. Excellent recipe.

House smelled great while cooking but would not feed 4 adults. Was uncertain about the sweet sauce but everyone seemed to like it. More than half of the sauce was leftover. Served sliced in pitas with spinach, tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion and mozzarella.

AMAZING. Tastes exactly like the donair from my favorite place. I used partly skim evaporated milk for the sauce an it tasted the same.

Thanks for the fantastic recipe! It's great to be able to make these from home.

Edit: Two years later and this is still a go-to recipe for my family. I tried making donair burgers with this recipe by shaping the meat into patties and grilling them on the BBQ. We used onion buns and regular donair toppings and used sweet sauce in place of condiments. The result was super delicious and super easy!!

I live in the Halifax area and have been for over 27 years. I made this for the first time over the weekend (made it Sat, then refrigerated overnight and ate Sun) and my family all agreed it's better then a lot of the donair places. It was really quite good and so simple. I followed the recipie to a "T" and didn't alter a thing. AAMOF, I can't think of anything I would change for next time. Definately putting this recipie on my book with 5 stars.

I have made this recipe but changed it to vegetarian by using veggie burger, eggs and cracker crumbs and oil to take the place of the hamburger meat.  Absolutely delicious.

This recipe is spot on! The one thing I did was after mixing the spices, I ran it through my grinder on the smallest grind twice. This mixes the spices in to the meat so perfectly and it gives the meat that same restaurant texture. The other thing is to shape it into loaves and wrap them tightly in plastic wrap for a couple hours (best over night) in the fridge before cooking.

This was delicious!  My boys didn't want to eat it in the pita, but they took it out and dipped in ketchup.  Couldn't convince them to try the sweet sauce!  Silly boys!  They loved the meat, though.  Yum!

I was very disappointed sauce was runny with no tips on how to make it thick.
Also the spices seemed off to me it tasted more like a meat loaf as opposed to a donair. 
Though its gotten rave review on this site  so who am I to argue.

I just tried this recipe.  It's delicious but would cut back on the salt.  Found it a tad too salty.  My husband is diabetic so used 2/3 cups of Splenda and thickened up nice.  I did the taste test and added a bit more vinegar.  I prefer a sweet and sour taste.  Don't know why people are having trouble with the sauce.  Follow the instructions and it comes out nice and thick.

Loved it! It was simple to make, cost effective, and delicious. The meat was spot on. However, after reading the reviews, I decided not to make the sweet sauce and went with a Tzatziki sauce that worked great with it.

I have only been to Canada once, but had something along these lines while I was there and wondered what it was! I love southern food, but this sauce is nothing like a gravy. It is tangy, sweet, and creamy all in one- don't be afraid to try it, you Americans!
Now, I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I was disappointed in how little the sauce actually "thickened"-- I whisked for a good while and followed directions but it didn't do the trick for me. I would have preferred a thicker sauce to the runny, messier one I got, but it still tasted great.
If you are not wanting to wait nearly 2 hours for this meal, try what I did as a shortcut: Thinly slice sirloin or some other high-grade meat, and season as you would the ground beef in the recipe. Cook on the stove top and then add to sandwich bread or wraps or whatever you like. I like it with some lettuce, chopped onion, and tomatoes. Add the sauce, and enjoy! It's unique and tasty!

Wow! My hubby just retired and was looking for different lunches. I made a 3 lb batch following the recipe exactly.  I sliced and froze them in portion sized batches.  3 Weeks later I'm making another batch!! He didn't care for the sauce, here in Ottawa it seems to be mayo based.  The meat is to die for.  Make sure to give the meat a 2nd grind and the throwing down the meat is key.  Thank you Dash!

Loved these! I had no idea going into this recipe that vinegar would thicken the evaporated milk mixture so I almost didnt make this thinking the sauce would be too runny. Good thing I learned differently since these were great!! Thanks for sharing!

I don't eat meat but made this for the family and they ate it up. We took it from the oven, let it cool a bit, sliced it fairly thin, then fried it to get it crispier. Will probably make it again.

I've been eating these my whole life. I grew up in Nova Scotia eating these, then I moved to Ontario and have been enjoying them here for over 20 years. A real European treat, I love them with diced onion and tomato and of course, the sweet sauce.
Many European and Middle Eastern and African countries have their own version but the Lebanese is my favorite. Juicy and flavorful unlike the bland, dried up versions available.
This version of the recipe is very good.

Very easy to make and taste yummy!!  My husband loved it so much.  I used low fat milk since that eas all I had.  The sauce was a little bit on the sweet side and I'm not sure if it's because I used Splenda or its supposed to be sweet like that.  I may cut on sugar a little bit the next time.

I haven't had a Donair this good since eating one at Charles Smart in Edmonton, Alberta 20 years ago!  I doubled the recipe but used half ground beef and half ground lamb.  I also reduced the sugar in the sauce to half of a cup.  The secret to the sauce is to combine all ingredients, except the vinegar.  Once combined, pour the vinegar on top and let it sit for about 5 minutes.  Stir 4-5 times with a spoon and then leave it alone!  Lastly, heat up one side of a 
Lebanese flat bread before assembling.  Don't forget the shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes and sliced onions.  Delicious!
