I'm the submitter of this recipe, and I just wanted to add: if your shortbread crust is a bit dry, try adding in some ice cold water a tablespoon at a time until it comes together a bit! Hope this helps!

I made no changes in the recipe, I am new to tart making but I make shortbread quite a bit and the crust mixture was much drier than I expected more crumbs than a crust. The filling was delicious I did not wait to let the oven cool down enough before I put the tart with the filling in so it was not silky filling, but it tasted great and it was a user error. If someone else can help me out about the crust I would make it again
