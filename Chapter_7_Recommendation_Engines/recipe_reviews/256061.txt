Wow! Who knew that spinach and kale could taste sooooo good? I was a skeptic until I tried it. Yum! Hubby loved it, but unfortunately my kids were turned off by the color. That's okay, more for me! I changed the recipe a bit, only because I didn't have everything on hand and it still came out great. Instead of pineapple juice, I put one cup of frozen pineapple and I used frozen mango. I had to add a little more orange juice to compensate the thickness and added a tablespoon of sugar, only because I have a sweet tooth. Wow!  It was delicious! Thanks for sharing!
