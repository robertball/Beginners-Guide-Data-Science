unbelevably bland; do this: double the salt and pepper on the chicken. add (to chicken) white cooking wine and hot sauce. to pear sauce, add small amount of white wine and hot sauce. boil pears in wine, hot sauce, chicken broth and honey for a few minutes, then mash pears (essentially make a rue). spoon over  chicken in a casserole dish and bake for 15-20 minutes. yum.

I was really disappointed by this recipe.  It sounds very good, but the sauce had a bizarre texture (like flubber?  that's my best approximation) and no taste at all.  In all, the dish was very bland and even though my roommates ate it, I did not eat the leftovers because I didn't want to waste the calories on it.

I'm rating this a 5 for my family. My kids and Hubby raved about this dish!Sauce was fine, if you like a roux type sauce.But instead of just browning the chicken on sides, I also poured sauce over & baked through.

I'm sorry but this recipe did not have much flavor.  Left remainder on stove and threw out in the morning.  Chicken would probably be better baked, but don't know what to do with the sauce.  It could go either way.  More spices or add some cinammon, raisins & a tad of sugar for a sweet sauce.

Great idea! I did it quit a bit different and WOW! I used frozen chicken put in boiling water and added garlic while that was boiling on low, I cooked the bacon.  After bacon was done I added 1 cup of organic chicken broth once that came to a boil I added a can of pears (water not syrup) mushed them up then added onion.  I then added the flour water mix to thicken and tossed in a tbls of red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.  I then placed the chicken and the sauce in the crockpot and let it cook for 5 hrs on low.  Put it over baby red potatoes.  Amazing flavor, tender meat and very filling.

This chicken tasted great but was not real pretty looking. My kids liked it and that is what counts around here! I will make this again.

This recipe is pretty tasty but a little too labor intensive for our family. Also, we don't recommend serving it with white rice. The rice is too bland for this mild dish.

I loved it. I added baby Bella mushrooms and the green onions in the skillet. After cooking the bacon  I tookit out and added that to the skillet.  I made the pear sauce but also added white wine and honey to it.  After it thickened I put it all in the skillet with the chicken and simmered for 20 min.  It was wonderful

good recipe, however I would bake/boil my chicken instead of putting it in the pan.  Just because of the oil.

Excellent recipe. Make sure you dice up the pears well. It heats up great for leftovers.

This was delicious, but I did make a major change which made it more like a dessert/side dish. I skipped the chicken and served it over yolkless egg noodles. I'll definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe if you're cooking for a Gluten Intolerant person and want gravey or need a bland main dish. We didn't dislike it, but there's something missing. We liked it somewhat, but both hubs and I keep saying it needs something. I may make this again with tweeks! We'll eat it for lunch tomorrow. Maybe sitting overnight in the Pear Sauce will make it better.

I picked this recipe because I had a can of pears in juice that had to be used. Used 2 med. onions, chopped and thighs instead of breast meat. Came out very yummy.

Replaced the green onions with about 1/3  caramelized yellow onion.  Added a little more dimension as well as a sweetness to balance out the salt of the broth and bacon. Then sauteed the chicken in those drippings.   I also baked the bacon at 375F for 20 minutes instead of the pan  and used the drippings from that to saute the Served it with a couscous dish. Everyone enjoyed it (even the kids, who I thought wouldn't!).  The Reisling was a good pairing with it.  Will definitely make again.

It is too bland.  There is some kind of spice missing.  I would not make it again.
