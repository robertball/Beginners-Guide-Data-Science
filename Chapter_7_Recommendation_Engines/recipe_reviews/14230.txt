WOW!!  I certainly agree with everyone else but I wanted to share my creative finds with everyone who follows.  I had several loaves of French bread in the freezer so I decided to experiment with the recipe. First, to make all batches I cubed the bread, put it in a large, glass measuring bowl with a lid, melted butter in the microwave, mixed in the dry ingredients (except parm cheese), then poured it over the cubes in the bowl.  After shaking mixture, I put it on the jelly roll pan, sprinkled on parsely, for color, and baked them. (Be sure to bake until browned.  Mine took longer.) I tried a SMALL batch with olive oil, for the heart healthy attempt. I recommend splurging on the saturated fats in butter or ICBINB butter flavored margerine, as I use.  The olive oil isn't bad, but the butter is much better.  (I also used garlic powder for both garlic batches, mixing it in the melted butter).  I put Parmesan cheese on one butter batch and the olive oil batch.  I liked the butter batches both ways. The other way I tried it was by mixing in dry, ranch flavored salad dressing, after I poured the butter on the bread cubes.  I had to experiment with the quanitity by tasting it often but liked approximately 1/2 pkg Hidden Valley Ranch dry mix to a 3" x 18" loaf of bread. (Sample it first, don't just dump in the quantities I suggest; it may not be to your liking.)I can't wait to find some day old pumpernickle or rye bread to throw in the mix.  Sorry for the lengthy review.  Thanks for s

I've been making homemade croutons for a couple of years (haven't used this exact recipe), and I just thought I'd throw in a couple of tips.  I find that the best croutons are made from large, bakery-type kaiser rolls (plain ones, of course, not ones with poppy seeds or whatever). . . I just buy a bag of 6 or 8 rolls, use some of them for lunch sandwiches in the first couple of days while they're still soft, and then throw them into the fridge until I'm ready to make croutons.  (Croutons are okay if made from fresh bread/rolls but better when the rolls are stale/firm.)  I use garlic powder instead of garlic -- the taste ends up evenly distributed . . . just garlic powder and enough butter to coat (although you could add herbs if you wanted as well).  Bake on a jelly roll pan lined with foil -- then clean-up is super-easy.  And here's the best secret of all (I never would have believed this before I started making my own croutons):  once the croutons are done baking, spread them on paper towels to cool . . . and then, once thoroughly cooled, put in a ziploc bag -- your croutons will keep JUST FINE in the cupboard for up to a couple of weeks.  You'd think they would mold or do something else gross, but not at all -- so really, throw some croutons in the oven every week and a half or so while you're preparing something else in the kitchen, and you're good-to-go all the time!  (My husband became a huge salad fan when I started making croutons a couple of years ago...)  :-)

No french bread on hand, I used day old Dave's Killer Bread. I also doubled the garlic. Nice and simple for what I needed, but this could be easily modified for a snootier salad. WAY better than the store bought by a mile. NOTE: You can also use extra virgin olive oil in place of the butter.

Irresistable is definitely the word to describe these! I'll NEVER ever go back to store bought again! I had some bread that was going stale and this recipe was just what I was looking for.... I melted the butter in the microwave and added just a bit of EVOO. I also added some italian seasoning and oregano along with the minced garlic. I watched them carefully so they didn't burn. I turned them once during cooking. I think you can mix up just about any combination of herbs, spices, and add in some grated cheese and these will turn out great!

I read this recipe at 4PM...it is now 4:27 and the croutons are done!  I can't believe I never made croutons befor, it is SOOOO easy!  The "melt the butter in a LARGE Glass bowl in the microwave" is the hot tip.  I used stale sourdough that I was just about to toss to the birds. I always have a jar of chopped/minced garlic in the fridge and tossed in a teaspoon of that.  I sprinkled on some grated parmesian and italian herb seasoning...added some extra garlic powder (not garlic salt!) Used a non stick pan and in 15 minutes the aroma was a delight.  They are cooling right now as I type...you have to try this one it is a winner.  I will never toss out stale bread ever agains!!!!!

Wow, these are GOOD!!  I didn't have the french bread, so I used regular loaf bread.  I melted my butter in the microwave and used garlic powder along with a dash of onion powder, parmesan cheese and ground black pepper.  I cut my baking time down to about 20 minutes and they were perfect!  I made these to go along with my Caesar Salad Supreme, also from this site.  I just put my bread cubes in a large plastic container and poured the butter mixture over and tossed well. No need to dirty up a skillet.

These are wonderful, except they are definitely not good for you. :) I will have to limit how many of these I make for myself. I make the following changes: I use 1 tablespoon butter and 3 tablespoon olive oil, add 4 teaspoon parmesan cheese and add 1 teaspoon italian seasoning. I will be sure to add these to my regular rotation.

Great Recipe.  Turns out much better sautung them first rather than simply baking them.  I did as another posted - used a stick and a half of butter, a whole loaf of frech bread and sauteed.  I also added Oregano, which I loved.  This is an excellent base recioe that you can use to flavvor any way you like.  Thanks.

I loved these croutons.  I decreased the butter by half and they still turned out great.  I will never buy croutons at the store again!!

I tried one batch with olive oil, the other with butter. To my GREAT surprise, my 5 year old daughter and myself preferred the croutons made with olive oil! (and we are "butter people".) I warmed the olive oil in a small pan, then added a crushed garlic clove; took it off the heat and let it "steep" for 20 minutes while I cut the bread--perfect amount of garlic flavor (and no mincing of garlic!)

these croutons are definitely 5 star as written, as many have already said.  however in my eternal effort to cut fat/calories, i've found that spraying them liberally with PAM or butter flavored cooking spray is a pretty great alternative!

Yum, yum, yum!  I made these tonight for the family with a tossed garden salad and they were fabulous!  The only problem was saving them for the salad after they came out of the oven!  I just used some thinly sliced Italian bread and they were wonderful.  What a way to make a salad so much better.  I will never buy prepackaged croutons again.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, they really were excellent!

I can't say we cared for these.  They had very little flavor.  I think next time I'll try adding some italian seasoning and garlic powder to them.

I used rye bread and also melted the butter in the microwave and then mixed the bread and butter in a bowl - which worked out great. I didn't have any garlic, so I didn't add it, but wished I had. We really liked them, although my husband did say that it would have definitely been better with the garlic. They were quite soft/stale the next day, but I just popped them into the toaster oven for a few seconds and they came out like they were just freshly made. Will definitely make again (with the garlic!)

I have been baking my own croutons for years, I use 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. In a pinch garlic powder or garlic salt will suffice as well.
Key is to not over cook them.

MMMM.  I used Italian herb bread, found on this site, and sprinkled paprika (the luckiest spice in the world, for you bachelor party fans ;) on them before baking...gone.  The kids ate em' all, my son mixed them in with his spaghetti, hmmm.  Thanks Cathy!

Great recipe, thank you.  The second time I added a little freshly chopped parsley.  Another time, Added a sprinkle of Paprika, and yet another, a little basil. We are salad lovers here, and very thankful for finding your recipe as we can create different flavours every time.

Excellent! I used a loaf of artisan-style bread I'd made a few days before and had lost it's freshness. Rather than cutting back on the butter I just used the entire loaf. As others recommended, I substituted garlic powder for a garlic clove to get a more even coating on my croutons. Once I took them out of the oven I coated them with Parmesan cheese. Hubby tasted one and simply said, "Wow!"

The rating speaks for itself. These croutons are fantastic! As a teenager I worked at an upscale restaurant that had what I thought were the worlds greatest croutons; However, these croutons with a little extra garlic and a dash of salt quite possibly could compete. Yum!

Like everyone else  - these are great.  I made a larger amount of croutons.  I used French Bread and
added some Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic, which I
let soak in the butter.  Also lined my pan with foil
for easier clean up.  There is a loaf in the freezer
waiting for me to make more right now.

These were great. I had about 1/2 loaf of bread from the crusty french bread recipe and I used this recipe for it. Instead of cubing the bread I just sliced it in about 1/4" or a tad smaller slices. I followed the butter and garlic method, but then added a sprinkle of dried parsley and basil to the croutons before baking. I made these to top soup, and they were just what I was looking for. I would like to try olive oil, to cut back the saturated fat of butter, and maybe even try some with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese next time. However, taste wise and appearance they worked great.

A good basic recipe that you can adapt to your ingredients and your tastes.  They are so yummy that I can't stop eating them by themselves.  I used part butter and part olive oil.

I am updating my review on 02/23/2008.  What I have been doing lately is using the Italian Butter recipe on this site when making these croutons and it is delicious.  Use 1 T of Italian butter instead of herbs and garlic.  Super!

I have made these wonderful croutons several times now and they are always delicious!  I use about 3/4 parts olive oil and 1/4 part Smart Balance Margarine.  I use garlic powder and dried italian herbs---superb!

Absolutely fantastic!  I used a whole loaf of french bread for this and increased the garlic and butter according.  My only changes is I added 2 tsp of rosemary and 4 tsp of Parmesan cheese to the butter.  These are so wonderful, you will want to snack on them.  Another suggestion is to leave slices whole and serve with french onion soup.

I'm rating this five stars, but only if you make this change: Instead of using a clove of garlic, use garlic salt and Italian seasoning. I tried it first using the clove, but it burns easily and tastes bitter. When olive oil is warm but not hot, sprinkle in garlic salt and Italian seasoning to taste. Try on the tip of your finger; add more if necessary. Then follow the the instructions for mixing and baking. The croutons are much better this way!

I can't believe how delicious these are.  I melt 2 sticks butter, throw in some chopped garlic and sea salt.  I cut up a whole loaf of french bread, and then toss the butter mixture and bread together, bake at 400 for about 20 minutes.  It makes a lot, but the last in a ziplock for awhile.  I eat way to many to make them last long though.

I normally do not like croutons, but these were great! I had unexpected dinner guests and needed croutons for my caesar salad... these were quick, easy and delicious. I used whatever bread I had on hand. I will now be making croutons for my salads! And this sure beats buying a box and having them go stale in my pantry!!!!! :)  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I used good quality oil oil, fresh garlic and pumpernickel, light rye and sourdough bread and added some oregano.  They are good for at least a week.

Wow these were fabulous! I used french bread and regular bread to check the difference and french bread is a must to get the crunch. They were so good we kept eating then right out of the bowl.

I will give this 5 stars because as written, I'm sure it will be very good. However, I only had stale sandwich bread on hand (whole wheat) and the garlic in a jar (which I don't really like) and some of the bread cubes were really soggy and even after 45, yes 45, minutes of baking (and careful watching, and turning) these pieces are still not 100% crunchy but I'm giving up because I don't want the other ones to burn. I had to douse these in sea salt, italian seasoning and fresh cracked black pepper because all the garlic burned off. I wish I had some parmesan cheese which might've made them better. They are ok, but not super. Still too sweet and bready. I wanted salty, garlicky and crunchy. Oh well. Like I said, I'm sure if I had done this recipe to the letter it would've been better! I think I might try olive oil next time. I love it, and I think it wouldn't make my bread really soggy like the butter did. I think you would get the best flavour if you sauteed the garlic and any herbs in the oil then strained it and mixed it with the bread with sea salt and fresh ground pepper. Also I think the French bread (or any crusty bread) is a must because my good old bagged sandwich bread is just too soft and smushy and soaks up the butter and stays soggy. But that's just my opinion :) Will definitely try this again!

great, but you can add just about anything and get fab croutons.  i've heard that the reason the French think the Americans can't cook is because we buy croutons.  i probably will again, but i hope not.

No surprise here -- these were delicious! I didn't have any loaf bread so I just used Sara Lee's wheat sandwich bread. It's just me and my husband and so we didn't need much. I used 3 slices of bread and melted 1 tablespoon of butter in the microwave with garlic powder, a dash of pepper, and some dry parsley flakes for looks. I baked for 20 minutes, flipping halfway through bake time. I threw them in a ziploc bag and tossed with parmesan cheese. They're tasty and beautiful addition to any salad...never going to store bought again!

WOW! I am not the biggest crouton lover but these are fantastic!  I love them just the way they are but I can definately see playing around with them....my family is going to love them with the White bean 'n' Ham soup (From this site that I made for tonight as well)  That is if they make it that long. Thanks for the recipe!

Agree with the others-won't ever use store croutons again!!  This is such an easy recipe and a great way to reduce wasting tale bread, rolls, etc.  I'll try different seasoning to add to this base recipe.  thanks

I thought this was a delicious recipe! I had two hard rolls that needed used up so I cubed them up. After adding the butter and garlic i drizzled a little EVOO and some extra herbs. I love homemade croutons!

These are to die for!  I didn't have french bread on hand, so I substituted plain white bread and they still tasted great.  I took everyone elses advice and used 1 tbsp butter and 3 tbsp olive oil.  Also, to keep from getting the burnt garlic pieces on my croutons, I simply sliced my garlic in half, and cooked them in the butter/oil mix.  Before adding the bread, I took the cloves out and discarded them.  This way, you get the garlic taste, but you don't have to worry about any small pieces burning.  One last thing, beware if your croutons are cut in different sizes.  This was my  first time making them and the size of my croutons were not consistent.  As a result, the smaller pieces will cook a lot faster.  These turned out to be the best croutons my husband and I have ever had!

Very good.  I've even made these with less margarine and sprayed them with Pam cooking spray before cooking to cut the calories back some.  Although they sure are heavenly just as the recipe tells you to do them. :)

this recipie was incredibly easy and the end result was fantastic. I even vary some of the ingredients, like instead of french bread, i used rye, and instead of minced garlic, i used minced onion, and it still turned out great.

I just made these tonight.  I really do not like croutons on my salads but I liked the idea that I can make them to my size liking.  I had some leftover sandwich rolls & regulare white bread.  I cut the crusts off the regular bread (which I don't think was necessary)  I also added some seasoning according to comments but I will be making these for now on.  No more store bought.  I wonder what restaurants would think if I brought my own.  LOL.  Thank you Cathy

Like all the rest, there's absolutely no need to buy croutons when you have this recipe ( Nor will you want too!!) I increased the amount of bread and butter and instead of fresh garlic I used garlic powder. As well, I added about a tsp of parmesan cheese to the butter mixture.  Delish! These make an ordinary green salad exciting again! My 4 year old wanted to eat just the croutons for supper!!

I find that the best garlic croutons are made from frozen garlic bread, i prefer the New York brand Texas toast.  Then follow this recipe and add between 4 and 8 tablespoons of melted butter along with some garlic powder and grated parmesan cheese to the shaker bag.  Bake at 350 until they turn a light golden brown.  The BEST ever!  I know I won't ever buy croutons again.

Enjoy.

These are really good! My father-in-law always makes croutons, but they're never any good. I'm pretty sure with this recipe I don't have to worry about that anymore! 

I changed it up just a tad, though. I didn't have stale bread on hand so I used some regular sourdough bread, which I don't think affected it since it's still delicious and very crouton-y. And I used olive oil instead of the butter because I wanted it to be a bit healthier. 

It's a really good recipe! Definitely using it more in the future!

Wow- the biggest challenge with these croutons is actually getting them on the salad without eating them all! :)  I melted the butter and sauteed with garlic in a skillet and then poured it over the cubed bread on a baking sheet.  After 15 minutes, I pulled them out of the oven and stirred and added some garlic salt and parsley- yum!  They turned out perfect.

ummmmmm, these should be illegal!  They are wonderful, and easy, and not so good for you. Have them once, then hide the recipe, till you have company.

I used butter substitute and added some grated parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes to this.  Very good.

I really liked these.  I doubled the garlic though because my family LOVES garlic.  Next time I'm going to try them with sage too.  I ripped the bread instead of cutting it which resulted in some very rustic looking croutons that went great in the broccoli cheese soup I made.  I will definitely make these again.

These were great!  And very easy.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added an extra dash of garlic powder, and generous amounts of dried parsley and grated parmesan.  I also cubed 3 slices of whole grain flax bread instead of French because it made them a little healthier ;)  I baked them for 5 minutes longer than suggested for extra crispiness, and tossed them the next day with a homemade Caesar salad.  My mom gave the croutons RAVE reviews and asked me to email her the recipe!  That's saying a lot since at first she couldn't understand why I'd bother making croutons when you can easily pick them up at the store.... now she gets it!!!

These were super good and fast to make. I didn't want to preheat the oven so I just did them in a pan over med. high heat.

These are the best!  I had a full loaf of stale french bread.  I cut the bread into 1/2 inch rounds instead of making cubes.  It was easier for me and the croutons are really big!  I used a large frying pan and melted 2 sticks of butter.  I added garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  I used my tongs to dip them into the butter mix.  After dipping both side, I layed them on the cookie sheet and put in the oven!  Very crispy and delish!  Some people added salt, but I don't think it needs any.  The seasonings have enough flavor.  Great with soup & pastas!  Enjoy!

By far, these are the best croutons I have ever had.  I make my french bread from scratch, and I think that helps the flavor too.  I will have trouble ever buying again, and will avoid it whenever possible in favor of these.

I used about 2 1/2 cups crusty chewy sour dough bread, replaced 1Tbsp of the butter with olive oil for the taste and added 1/4 cup parmasean then parsley flakes for color.  Could have cut back on the butter by 1/4th at least (maybe due to the harder bread texture) and they need more flavor.  More cheese? More garlic?  Probably more italian herbs.  All in all, I can't stop munching on them as they cooked perfectly and smell FABULOUS!!!  EASY and a keeper. Never a bought crouton again as I'd be embarassed for how easy and much better these are.

I liked these croutons very much.  I thought that the proportion of butter to bread and the cooking time made for croutons with texture and crunch, without giving me "Cap'n Crunch mouth."  I used an Italian bread that was getting stale.  I also added about 5,000 (count 'em, 5,000) Italian herbs and spices after transferring them to the baking sheet.

These are GREAT! You'd never imagine something so simple could make such a difference in your salad! I didn't have enough of the bread specified in the recipe so I used everything I could get my hands on! ha ha I used french bread, rye bread, Texas toast and swirled pumpernickle. All of them turned out AWESOME. The Texas Toast I think worked out even easier than the french bread. The bread is thick and easier to cut into cubes. I cut all of my bread while it was frozen which helped it keep its shape. Now, anytime I have a piece or two of a loaf left I just pop it into the freezer until I am ready to make croutons. I may have ended up using more butter/garlic but I might have easily tripled the recipe. ha ha These are very good, pretty easy and if you line the pan with foil, fairly easy to clean up! My mom BEGS for these croutons. The first time I made them she ate a salad everyday for a week! :)

Great croutons and easy to make!  I had a ton of Italian bread leftover after a party and decided to use it up by making croutons. I also added some dried italian dipping seasoning to the croutons, and that added a lot of flavor - great idea, and I will be making these again! Note:  I also put them in my fridge to keep them fresh for a few weeks - they are all gone now, with none wasted!

Lovely croutons!  My husband and I loved them!
We used whole-wheat bread, and I didn't have any butter, so I used olive oil.  I added some italian seasoning and parmesan cheese, too....basically, I didn't do much by the recipe, but I used the basic technique.  This is a very versatile recipe, and will be used often in our house!

Totally awesome.  All I had on hand was some white "day old" buttermilk bread.  I followed everyone else's lead as far as I used 1 T. butter and 3 T. olive oil, garlic salt and italian seasoning to taste in the warmed butter/olive oil then quickly sauteed cubes.  At the very end, I sprinkled on fresh parmesan cheese.  They are in the oven now and OMG do they smell heavenly.  DH came out and stole a couple already...:)  Thanks for a grrreat recipe.

Great croutons!! Like many others...I have been converted! Never again will I buy croutons! I made a large batch and followed the recipe almost exactly...except I took "Josie's" advice and added a dash of onion powder.  However, if I can discover the correct amts, next time I will use garlic powder in lieu of minced garlic...what didn't stick to the cubes burned in the oven while baking.  Easily adjustable and very tasty.  Went great with our salad.

Great recipe as is.  I made two batches with leftover stale sourdough.  I used 8oz of cubed bread for each one and used the microwave to melt butter/seasonings.  In the first batch, I used the butter/garlic exactly as written.  In the second batch, I added 1/2 t Penzy's Italian Herb mix and 1/2t granulated garlic (in addition to fresh minced) and 1/2t onion powder and some S&P.  I liked the additional herbs better but the original recipe was FANTASTIC!.  I think I am done with store bought croutons from this point forward. Thank you so much for this wonderful addition to my recipe file.

I just finished making these and like another reviewer said: never again will store-bought croutons go in my salads!  I'm making a salad for a ladies lunch and I can't wait to hear what they say.  I did what others suggested and used garlic powder.  Melted the butter in the microwave and when I had finished tossing the croutons and put them on the baking sheet, I sprinkled a little Parmesan.  Wow, wow, wow.  Can you tell I loved it?!  These will be wonderful in my French onion soup, too!  Thanks for sharing.

Outstanding and easy! Great way to use up leftover french or italian bread. I freeze slices, then slightly defrost, make cubes, then toss in melted butter and minced garlic (I skip the sautéing, not necessary).  I wanted them to brown more quickly, so toasted at 360 for 15-20. YUM. ADDICTING. I would double these, they won't last.  Hard to eat store bought croutons after making these. Thanks for sharing!

I make these every time I have salad, especially for company. Everyone notices how great these are, and though such a simple thing, homemade croutons make such a big difference! One thing that I have found to work best is rather than putting the bread cubes into the saute pan to coat, I put them in a large bag to coat. This coats the croutons really well and makes them evenly buttery-delicious! Thanks for the great recipe.

Make sure to cut the bread first, put it in the pan and then melt the butter, or else some of the bread will be super buttery and some will have none.

I made these for my family, using leftover hamburger buns and dinner rolls.  I also used fresh garlic.  The kids and hubby loved them.  Thank you for this go-to recipe!

Delicious! I will say, twenty minutes was way too long and I burnt the first batch. Fifteen minutes was much better. For three slices of bread I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/8 tsp Italian season and some black pepper to the butter before tossing the bread. And as everyone else says, microwaving the butter is more convenient.

This was amazing... Simple, easy, I've made garlic bread dozens of times and never considered making croutons for my salads. I didn't have any butter or french bread/rolls, so I just used whole wheat bread slices and margarine. I also used garlic powder instead and added a pinch of dried basil. Very yummy. No more buying a small box of croutons for $3-$4.... Enjoy!

Great basic recipe - cut the butter down to half and substituded my home made herbal olive oil.  Added some dried parsley before putting on the pan.  Next time, I will add some good parm for even more flavor.

As another reviewer wrote . I will never go back to store bought . Homemade croutons are so much better.   I used olive oil instead of butter and they turned out awesome.  I will definelty be adding more seasonings and experimenting a lot more but I love garlic so this is why I made this recipe first. Thanks so much for sharing

This was really good. The bread needed to be flipped over so that both sides were crispy, and I will be adding more garlic next time. Overall really good.

Easy peasy and so good. Delicious just the way they are or you can dress them up with different seasonings and types of bread. I typically use more bread in the same amount of butter so mine aren't as buttery but they still crisp up nicely and taste great.

OMG made these for a dinner party and they were a big hit!  So easy to make and nice to have on hand.  Store bought croutons are so filled with sodium, which is a big no no with my blood pressure.

These were AWESOME! I can't believe what I've been missing by not making my own croutons sooner. I added some onion powder, parsley and fresh cracked pepper and sea salt to the butter, along with the garlic, then just poured everything over the bread cubes and proceeded. These baked up wonderfully and the end result was very yummy! I now have a new use for all that bread about to go stale! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are delicious. I add black pepper to mine, and sometimes I use olive oil instead of butter. If I do that, I also add salt. Thanks for the recipe!

Quick and Easy! Put these on a salad with sliced cajun chix breast and cheese. Hubby absolutely loved this salad! He even asked for more croutons on his salad! I followed recipe to a T but did sprinkle some sesame seeds on the croutons for the last 5 minutes! Timing is perfect on these...did them in the toaster oven!

That was phenominal!  They reminded me of a popular restaurant around here, Johnny Carino's, salad croutons. I followed along what the other viewers said and I actually cooked mine for 25 minutes so that they were nice and brown.  I used the italian seasoning packet and used about half and put it in the melted butter and then dumped the cut cubed bread in the bowl and mixed with my hands and then put on a greased cookie sheet.  I will most definetly be making these a lot now and NO more store bought croutons!  Thank you for such a good and easy recipe!

I am a garlic fan, so when I saw this recipe, I knew I would love it right away. And I was right. I doubled the recipe because I knew I would eat half of it straight from the tray, which I did :) Several of the reviewers said that they had used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. I thought that was not a very good idea, so I made mine with fresh garlic. Fresh garlic bits got burnt in the oven, and the pieces that had those garlic bits on were bitter. Next time I will try the recipe with garlic powder. Other than that, I loved it! Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!

So yummy!!  I did something a little different though.  I cubed the bread.  Then put butter and garlic (added some parmesan cheese) in a pan, on very low heat.  I put the bread in a garbage bag added the butter mixture and shook it up like shake and bake.  The kids had fun helping with this~ then baked them a little longer than it said, but they are soooooo good.  I will make these all the time.

I love these.  I make these quite often since they are so easy & taste a lot better then store bought.  I usually make up a large batch and keep them in my freezer for salads and soups too.

These are awesome. Way better than the stuff from the bag!! I made an entire batch last weekend; some went into salads, others on top of soup, and the rest...well, I ate them just by themselves! A good addition to anything, or just fine on their own. Try adding some garlic powder and paprika to them too.

Yum!  I could tell the croutons were a hit with my family when they were gobbling them right off the cookie sheet.  Very flavorful and super simple to prepare.  All of my "day old" bread will be made into croutons from now on.  What a great way to get the kids to eat salad!

Why would you ever buy the hard, stale, broken croutons from the store ever again?  These are awesome.  The only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  I've found that you get more of an even garlic flavor throughout all of the croutons this way.  Awesome!

These are great... not hard like the croutons in a package (or a lot of chain restaurants).  Do watch them carefully when they're in the oven or you can burn them.  I've even used broken hamburger buns or rolls in place of the French bread and they come out great.  Also a mixture of olive oil and butter works well too.  GREAT!

these were good- i mixed it up a little bit & used a garlic pepper seasoning instead of the garlic since so many had complained about the garlic burning.  also, i just used leftover deli rolls that were half way stale anyways.  great use for old bread!  will definitely keep it in mind.  made more right after dinner & just put a little olive oil in the bottom of a cake pan, added parmesan and garlic pepper seasoning & then tossed the bread cubes in it & threw it in the oven.  less mess, & about the same taste as doing that part on the stove.

like the other reviewers, i used 1 tbsp of butter and 3 tbsp of olive oil. I minced the garlic and added salt and pepper (the right amount for your taste) and then i sprinkled a tad bit of garlic powder before putting them into the oven. these were great

a simple, yet delicious recipe for croutons.  i added olive oil as others suggested so the butter and olive oil were a 3:1/4:1 ratio.  i also utilized a garlic mincer, which helped a lot because the garlic did not burn in the oven.  a big fan of garlic, i used both garlic and mccormick garlic salt to get the full garlic taste.  i made this twice, and made sure to mix the bread in the pan very quickly otherwise the bread gets saturated and too salty.  for "perfect cut" croutons, put the bread in the fridge the night before, and the outcome is perfectly square bread cubes that are much easier to cut

I was not a big fan of croutons until now. I made mine with sesame wheat bread, and 1 tbls of unsalted butter 3 tbls of olive oil, a clove of garlic , a little bit of parsley (for color), and fresh ground black pepper and just a dash of kosher salt. I brushed the oil and butter onto the bread cubes that way there I got the garlic flavor but not all the minced pieces which could burn in the oven and produce that burnt garlic flavor.Also I shook the baking sheet a few times and I broiled mine the last 2 minutes (give or take). Well they sure are great and very rustic!

This a super-dee-duper recipe. I have already made this twice in a week and passed the recipes on to three people who now don't buy store bought croutons. I highly recommend using the garlic powder because minced garlic tend to burn in the oven. Also do soak the croutons in the garlic butter at least 30 minutes before baking to get the full garlic flavour.

Great simple recipe - I like to use thin slices of a sourdough baguette with this. Before baking, I sprinkle some italian seasoning - great as a snack or on a salad. Looks fancy, tastes fancy!

This is wonderful and exceptionally easy. I used a whole loaf of Italian bread that was pre-sliced from Walmart (on their bread clearance rack- costs me .60 cents!) I put the slices on a cookie cooling rack and turn them after about 3 or 4 hours and then let the other side sit that long. Then slice them up into crouton sized pieces. The great thing about this recipe is that if I need more butter mixture for the bread I just melt it with more garlic clove and pour it over the bread cubes. Only thing I would change- if you are a garlic lover- add a bit more minced garlic. I will NEVER EVER buy store bought croutons again. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Yummy!!!!I will never purchase store bought croutons again.  Tip: I used the ends of bread that normally gets thrown away.  It also doesn't have to be french.  (I used a combo of wheat and potato bread.

Very easy and great in our salad! I used half olive oil and half butter and added a sprinkle of parmesan and dill before I put them on the baking sheet. I only had whole wheat bread and it turned out great. I am going to try with sour dough next! Thanks !

These taste good, are easy enough to make, and make good use of leftover bread, but I honestly still prefer the packaged kind. Not enough taste, and that was after adding more garlic, basil, parsley and salt!

The best!  I used a little more butter than called for and used the microwave to melt it.  I then put the bread crumbs in a tupperware bowl with the butter and fresh garlic and gave it a shake - so easy!  In fact, my hubby requests more salads now that I make these croutons.  Sourdough is our favorite.  Thanks Cathy for great croutons!  You're a genius!

These croutons are great.  I am a crouton lover.  My suggestions, I used regular bread slices and left them out on the kitchen counter over night to dry.  I think any bread would be good with this recipe.  Thanks!

Okay, I have now tried these all ways: butter versus olive oil and garlic powder versus garlic clove. I can tell you by far the best way is butter with garlic powder. Or you could use unsalted butter with garlic salt, either is delicious.

Easy and  quick. And I haven't bought croutons since discovering this recipe. I store them in a recycled  glass sauce jar. And there always fresh.
Extra toppings...sprinkle  parmesan cheese on before baking.

yummy!  I probably used 5 TBS butter though, and two cloves of garlic (crushed).  Then I added some seasoned garlic salt, some italian herbs, and some parsley.  Baked it for about 20 minutes.  EXCELLENT!!!!  thanks Cathy

These are beyond delicious!!  I made mine from bakery hot dog buns.  OMG!  They didn't even make it onto the salad.  This is a fantastic way to use up bread or buns that would otherwise be thrown out for the birds.  Thanks for this amazing - easy recipe!!!

Why buy croutons when they are THIS easy to make?I used the loaves of bread I received with my take-out from the Cheesecake Factory. The contrast of brown and white bread is visually exciting. Used fresh garlic and a bit of garlic powder and Italian seasoning. They turned out delicious!

I made these for dinner with my mom and we loved them!  I will never buy store-bought croutons again.  For the bread I used nearly stale hamburger buns just because that's what I had on hand and they turned out so yummy!

I just sprinkled some extra spices the second time I made them as I wanted a bit more italian flavor for caesar salad.  Pan toasting and then in the oven seems to be the best prep.  I finally like croutons!

These croutons weren't as good as I had hoped. Maybe it was because I used wheat French bread instead of regular French bread (a mistake on my part). Will try again with the bread called for.

You can't get much simpler than this recipe. And it tastes great. I used the crusts cut off of our pizza instead of french bread. I also sprinkled on some salt before baking since the crust was kind of bland (the reason I cut if off). Great way to use up leftovers and they were a great addition to my garden salad.

These are DELICIOUS!!! I used the ends of some Vienna bread I had left over. I melted the butter in the microwave, mixed it with minced garlic from the fridge, garlic powder, sea salt, and some cayenne pepper for kick. They are AMAZING! Never buying store bought croutons again!

These are wonderful. I will probably tweak this recipe a bit next time because I feel like they could have used some more seasoning beyond the garlic. Still, this recipe will remain my starting point for croutons.  So easy and so good. I don't think that you could mess this recipe up unless you forgot to keep an eye on them while they were in the oven.

Made these last week with a multi-grain French loaf.  They turned out really good.  Today I'm using a Black Russian Pumpernickel.  I'm into shortcuts so this time I'm melting the butter in the microwave and adding powdered garlic to it.  I am also adding salt as I thought it was needed originally.  I am putting the cubed bread into a very large bowl and drizzling the garlic butter over the bread as I stir it around.  I think this will get the butter more evenly distributed and I can do it all at once instead of batches in the skillet.

If you make these croutons per the recipe these croutons are terrible.......way too much butter. However, I have read suggestions from other readers and they sound more reasonable.

Used half a loaf of french bread, 1 stick of butter and 2 HUGE garlic cloves.  Came out alright, I think I need more butter and garlic next time and they'll be perfect.  SUPER easy though. Thanks!

Very versatile recipe, i added about a 1/2 packet of ranch seasoning mix to the bread before I sauteed it otherwise followed the directions as written.  We now love salads in our house and I will never buy croutons again!

Delicious! Here's the thing: you don't need to use french bread. You can use any kind. I used two hamburger buns that I had leftover. I cut them up, sautéed them with 1/2 teaspoon garlic as I didn't have a clove on me, and then baked as directed. Will definitely be making these again.

I made these to go with French Onion Soup and they were excellent with the onions and cheese!  I mixed garlic powder, onion powder, and parmesean cheese in the butter.  Will have to make these again, would be perfect for salad as well!

Good starter recipe. Some things I changed... Melt butter over low heat with garlic already added, or if using olive oil place oil over low heat with garlic already added..this makes the garlic flavor cook into either the butter or oil.. I a lso added a bit of italian seasoning, and dash of salt and pepper, and some grated parmesean.. Yummy...

I LOVE this recipe.  I will NEVER buy store bought croutons again.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, other than adding a teensy bit of oregano before I put them in the oven to add a little color, and they were DELICIOUS.  Ten million stars.  THANK YOU!

After finding that my homemade challah turned out as dense as fruitcake, I decided to try this recipe out as salvage.  It worked, as well as one could expect!  The baking time was a lot longer for my super-moist bread, but eventually the croutons came out crispy and full of flavor.  I used some pepper, oregano and garlic powder in place of the minced, per another reviewer's advice.

I used bread I made that didn't come out just right and this is a great reicpes to salvage a big mistake. Best mistake in fact I have ever made. I cut the croutons a little bit bigger and served them as hours de vours. sp? with a nice alfredo dip in the middle of my plate. It was a nice touch that I wouldn't have normally used at my dinner party.

Yummy and easy croutons!  Am definitely making again.  I may have been using a non-standard baguette, but I ended up with lots of excess butter and servings for maybe 2-3 people instead of 6.

My 2 year old has developed a taste for croutons, so I thought it would be a good idea to make some for him from our homemade bread.  This was the first recipe I tried, and he absolutely loves them!  As a bonus, I now have a use for all the stale bread I find left in the bread box.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I make big, healthy salads for parties and wanted to add something different for a change.  I cubed the french bread into 1/2" to 3/4" pieces, used 2 tablespoons butter to 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Actually, it didn't look like enought so I added another tablespoon of butter(!)  After coating the cubes in the butter/oil mixture, I sprinkled  basil, garlic powder, and parsley then baked them as directed.  I placed the croutons in a pretty dish with a big spoon next to the salad so they would remain fresh and not get soggy.  I did have to tell everyone that they  were homemade because people assumed they were the horrible store-bought croutons.  So very savory, crunchy soft and delish - everyone raved about them!

I had cut the crusts off of honey wheat bread for another recipe so I used them in this recipe. Very good croutons! I had to double the recipe as I had the crusts from about 20 slices of bread. I added a bit of kosher salt, as well as some italian seasoning. Boy, is my grandson gonna be happy...he'd rather eat croutons than potato chips!

When Costco stopped selling Chatham Village Croutons, I couldn't find a good brand to buy.  These are very good.  I used 1/2 butter-1/2 olive oil (for flavor/health), and garlic powder to more evenly distribute the garlic flavor.  I cut up some old French sourdough and let it sit for a couple of days until it got good and crisp-stale and it worked well.

These were so good and easy that I will never buy those crummy boxed ones again.  I followed some of the advice in other reviews and reduced the butter -- but only to 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp olive oil.  I also sliced the garlic and removed it as someone else suggested and it worked great.  Since I didn't have french bread on hand, I used plain white and it still worked great.  Thanks.

The beauty of this crouton recipe is its simplicity. Just basic, great-tasting croutons. I think some croutons are too spicy, dried up or too crunchy. But these were perfect.

Quick, easy, and tasty. People are always impressed that you made your own croutons, and they taste 10 times better than anything out of a box. You can experiment with adding different seasonings to these to shake up your salad, too!

YUM YUM YUM!  These are great, even better than store bought.  I'll never buy croutons in the store again.  I used Garden Herb Bread from this site, delicious!  I really do thing you could use any type of bread and it would turn out great!  Thanks for the great recipe!

YUMMM!!!  Had trouble saving some for the evening's dinner...  Used whole-grain bread for extra fiber and doubled the garlic.  The taste of garlic on the croutons was subtle. More like an aroma.  Personally, I prefer a stronger garlic taste, so I will add even more garlic next time to experiment.  I will also let the bread sit in the garlic butter for a few hours before baking, and will see if it'll make a difference. Nevertheless, a great recipe!

Yum,Yum,Yum!  I used olive oil instead of butter, added extra garlic, threw in some Italian seasoning and some Locatelli Romano cheese and these croutons turned out great!  Make sure to flip the croutons while they're cooking.  No more boxed croutons for this family  :o)

Even though I used stale white bread and sprinkled some dillweed on it, I could hardly taste the garlic (two cloves).  I would say it was buttery but without the pizzaz.  The sprinkled on dillweed was obviously not enough for flavor, but it gave it nice color.  I will try it with olive oil in the future per the recommendations of other reviewers.

These are so much tastier than store bought croutons.  I will never have to buy another box again!  I used sourdough and added a little parmesan cheese before baking.

I've used this recipe many times.  I simply use up heels of bread and any bread or buns that have been in the freezer for a while.  I cut up the bread crouton size & let it sit out on the counter for an hour or two to dry out.  I combine the butter & fresh minced garlic in a glass measuring cup & microwave until melted.  I then let that sit for several minutes for the garlic to infuse the butter.  I then add about 2 T. fresh parmesan & a teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the butter.  I spread the bead cubes onto a baking sheet & toss it with the melted butter mix.  I then bake at 350 degrees for about 8-10 minutes.  Don't bake too long or the croutons will come out very hard.  This is a very good recipe with just a few minor adjustments.

I bought a loaf of French bread and let it sit in the pantry for about 2-3 days until it was stale.  I sliced into small piece and tossed (in a Ziploc bag) with butter, olive oil, some grated parmesan cheese, garlic power and dried parsley.  They were so delicious on top of a Caesar salad!  I baked them at 325 degrees, so they didn't burn for about 20 min.  YUM!

Hands down this is a keeper recipe! I used the bread I had at hand as I hate to throw away mildly stale artisan bread. The recipe gave it a new life to my mildly stale bread. Try it just as is.

This recipe is fabulous! I actually made my own Italian focaccia bread and used that for my croutons. This bread was prefect because it already had great seasoning and it baked well (crunchy and still not burned!) I also substituted olive oil for the butter and it turned out great! Thank you for this recipe, it's perfect!

Very tasty! I took some advice and added a good amount of Italian seasoning and a tiny bit of garlic salt. I made a double batch, but I could still easily eat the whole bag I made alone!

Once you've made these, there is no reason to buy your own croutons. These are so easy and delicious.  Add a few extra seasonings for variation to this already fabulous recipe as we sometimes do.  These are fast and delicious.  Yum!

Loved this recipe! Thinking next time I'll use garlic salt instead of minced garlic. The minced burned in the oven. But they still tasted FANTASTIC!

These are SO good. I used 4 hamburger buns, cut them into cubes and put them in the pan. Only problem was that the first cubes I put in the pan soaked up all of the butter/garlic mix. So i just put a few dollops of butter over the cubes and sprinkled it all with garlic salt. I didn't time them since it usually takes longer; but they still came out amazing.

Agree!! These are awesome, worth the effort by far!!
I make a 13x9 jelly roll full of these and keep them in a lock tight container and they keep very well.  Not to mention they smell amazing when they cook!!

Very good!  I used sourdough french bread and really liked the tang from the sourdough.  I'll probably use more garlic cloves next time.

Wanted to use garlic powder instead. I tripled the recipe and add two teaspoons total. So good! Way better than store bought. Goes great with Buttermilk Garlic dressing just like that Steakhouse restaurant. So good!

Great base recipe to play around with.  I like a lot more garlic and maybe Italian style herbs.  If you use less butter (or if your bread is already pretty dry), be aware they may brown in the oven faster than expected (which is fine if you keep an eye on them).

This ia an awesome and easy recipe. I tried it with some leftover baguette and they came out so crispy and buttery. I used Smart Balance butter for a more heart healthy version. Forget the salad, they are good just to eat alone or with some hearty soup.

Tasty and simple to make. People always look puzzled when I say that I made them. I guess it's not common to make your own croutons, but these are so much better than the store-bought ones.

A really great basic crouton recipe. It's hard not to eat these straight from the oven haha. Definitely helps to make the flavours pop in a good caesar salad.

Why do we buy our croutons at the store??  These are simple and excellent!  My husband is not a big crouton fan, but he was popping them in his mouth fresh out of the oven, before we even sat down to eat!  The only thing vague about this recipe is the amount of bread to add:  how big around is this loaf of French bread supposed to be?  I used about two cups of bread cubes from a loaf of homemade bread machine Italian bread (from this site) I had in the freezer and this seemed about right.  We used them with the Bermuda Spinach Salad (from this site).  Yummy.

These turned out soooo good! I wont ever buy croutons again! I did change the recipe a tad, I used bread that was from a bakery and was getting stale, it was called Dakota bread, it had nuts and stuff in it. Also, I used dried minced garlic, and before tossing in the oven I sprinkled course sea salt on top...yum! I set my oven timer for 5 minutes so I could stir them while baking, did that 3 times and they were done perfectly! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Wow! My boyfriend ate them first, and then the rest of the salad. An excellent detail in a big, nutricious salad!

I used leftover honey wheat bread and just buttered each piece as though I were going to toast them for breakfast! Then I cut into cubes, took a wide spatula and put them on a cookie sheet. Toasted at 350 for 15 minutes and then tasted them. Wife and I agreed they needed 5 minutes more. Turned out perfect! Seasoning used was garlic powder and seasoned salt (lightly). Will make again. Others said that letting them cool completely and then storing leftovers in baggies will work...will see.....will see if there are ANY leftovers! LOL

Homemade croutons jazzed up my boring salad.  Subtle garlic flavor and very buttery... not as crunchy as the crouton quarry rocks that come in a box.  I might add a touch of garlic salt next time to kick up the flavor.

Simple and delicious.  I did double the recipe, using 4 T butter and 1/4 cup olive oil.  This is a tasty and convenient alternative to storebought croutons.

Yummy!  I took a whole loaf of a rosemary garlic bread and used a whole stick of butter and doubled the garlic.  They turned out delicious.  I'm ruined now and will never be able to buy store bought croutons again.  Not when I can make them this good at home.

Excellent!  I used a tub of whipped garlic butter and some italian bread that was a few days older than I'd like for sandwiches.  GREAT way to get more use from old bread instead of throwing it away!

Mmmmm, delicious little things! Great garlic flavor, and so simple, easy, and quick to make. My family was complimenting me throughout the whole meal. My mom even loved them and she doesn't like croutons! I will definitely make these again, even if I'm not going to make a salad...they are awesome even just as a plain little snack! Nice and crunchy too. :)

What an easy and tasty recipe.  I baked mine for about 9 minutes and they came out perfect.  I used a bread dipping mix that was given to me as a gift, so I sprinkled this into the butter mixture and it worked just as well.

Doubled the recipe and used more garlic of course and a touch of garlic salt and italian seasoning while sauteing. Used fresh baguette bread and was worried it would be soft but I cooked it just a tad longer like 5 minutes and it was perfect and tasty.  We had company for dinner and served these with a caesar salad from this site and it got rave reviews!  I put leftovers in a ziplock bad to use later.  Very easy and fast, will make often.

They are okay, not spectacular... Followed advice of melting butter in microwave, added italian seasoning, salt, and garlic powder, and later sprinkled on some parsley flakes.  Had to add lots of olive oil (too many bread pieces).  It's true the crushed garlic burned a little, but taste was still ok.  Baked for 25 minutes in toaster oven.  Stale bread turned out too crunchy; fresh bread turned out much better, crunchy on outside and soft on inside (but by day two was also too crunchy).

Perfect Croutons!  I used white crusty buns that were a couple days old.  The croutons turned out crunchy yet light melt in your mouth.  I will always use this recipe for croutons now.

The taste was great, but mine came out really soggy despite cooling all day. Next time I would probably use less butter. But, I look forward to making these again!

While I love store bought croutons, for special occassions these blow anything  you buy from the store out of the water.  They are incredible and a treat well worth the few minutes it takes to prepare them.  I don't make any changes as I think the simple version are the best.

I'd never made croutons before and these turned out wonderful! I made a double batch with fresh garlic. Next time I'll try using garlic powder and some garlic salt...I thought they needed a little salt. I made them with tomato soup...yum!

Just made a double batch of these buttery croutons and I am just thrilled with how they taste.  I don't think I will ever serve store bought croutons for guests again.  These are so easy to make.  I used garlic powder instead of fresh and they were still delicious!!  Very easy and quick to make.  As other reviewers have said, I could not keep my hands out of them!  YUMMY!!!!

very easy to make, I can't see why anyone would buy croutons after seeing how easy they are to make at home.

I used French bread because I happened to have it, but I think this would be great with any kind of bread.  I added a few more spices and used olive oil instead of butter, they turned out great and backed for about 20 minutes in my oven.

These croutons are SSSSSOOOOO good and so easy to make!  My husband keeps eating them straight out of the Tupperware container as a snack.  That must mean that they are good.

Awesome!  Followed recipe exactly.  They're not as good when they're still warm but they get REALLY GOOD (and addicting) as they cool. I can see eating a lot more salads if they include these!

Best croutons ever.  Far better than store bought. I also appreciated being able to use bread I was going to throw away because it was stale. I will never buy croutons again. Not only that, when I served them, one of my guests asked me where I bought them because they were so fresh. When I explained I had made them, she gave me the most amazing look that vacillated between jealousy and hatred!!! It was awesome!

15 minutes at 350 was, too long... started to burn at 13 minutes.  Minced garlic will also burn, I’ve had better luck with garlic powder.  1/2 and 1/2 with olive oil and I’ve achieved great croutons.

I used garlic powder instead of fresh, and it was still good. Also, I added some salt. I also baked the croutons for only about 10 mins, and it was already crispy (maybe because I used a stale baguette). Will definitely make again.

I seasoned mine with Club House Parmesan and Herbs, and with garlic granules, as I thought they might store longer than with fresh garlic ( even though I prefer it.) I also baked them at lower temp (250)  for half hour to avoid toughness in the bread. These  croutons are awesome on salad and so easy to make. Why throw out stale bread then go buy overpriced croutons  at the market?

This recipe is super easy and makes excellent croutons.   You can easily adjust this recipe to add extras that you like-parmesan cheese, herbs, etc.  Great way to use up stale breads and rolls.

Made the croutons for the first time tonight following the recipe exactly as written. Delicious! I will not buy boxed croutons again! These are so easy and amazing. I will experiment with other ingredients in the future as some of the reviews suggest. Thank you for a quick and amazing recipe.

I made these exactly as the recipe said and loved them.  These croutons had the perfect amount of crunch to them and it was a nice change to not almost break a tooth eating store-bought croutons.   I've kept these for at least 2 weeks in a zip-lock bag in the cupboard and  have also cubed up the bread and frozen it to saute and bake at a later date with no change in flavor.  It's a very economical way to use up leftover french bread and it's the only way I'll ever eat croutons again.

I made these and they are absolutely delicious! I eat gluten free so made the croutons out of the heels of the gluten free bread. I tripled the fresh garlic and also added oregano and garlic powder. I'll have to make them again soon as they're already gone

So easy to make and very tasty!  I didn't have the suggested bread, so I used several pieces of thin-sliced sour dough.  The croutons turned out yummy!  My husband said he could smell the garlic outside the front door before he walked into the house.  I may have used several cloves of garlic - we LOVE garlic in my family!

This recipe was so easy!! We used Cuban bread instead of French bread just because that was what we had on hand and we substituted 2 Tbsp of the butter with olive oil. Added 2 tsp each of Italian seasoning and parsley for color. They turned out great and were perfect for our Caesar salad!!

I used a combination of butter and olive oil, two to one ratio.  I added garlic powder, and chopped parsley to the melted butter mixture.  This is my now 'go to' crouton recipe.

WOW, very tasty, made recipe as written, only made a much larger recipe.  Used fresh minced garlic and real butter, sprinkled with a bit of Italian Seasoning.  Great for soup.

So delicious! I use stale homemade bread (whatever flavor I happen to have at the time) and to only use garlic to season. Perfect!

Used day old French bread, 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder, 3 minced garlic cloves( we LOVE garlic) a few shakes of Dried Italian herb seasoning  and cooked them at 400 degrees the last 7 minutes stirring often. Poured excess butter off and let them stand to crisp and dry.

Melted the butter in the microwave, added garlic powder, a little Italian seasoning, poured over bread cubes in a ziplock bag. On to cookie sheet, popped in the oven. Forgot to set timer, but I think they were in for about twelve minutes. Excellent.

1. I added flavor.  
2. This is so much more butter than I needed for the amount of bread. 3.I also cut the bread into smaller pieces because I was hoping that cutting them smaller and keeping the baking time the same would give me nice, crunchy croutons. 
It took up to 30 minutes to finish all of the croutons.

Love this receipe for croutons. I add some parsley OR italian seasonings before baking if I am in the nood. Otherwise I make exactly as the receipe states. Quick and easy way to prepare croutons.

Really easy, but did need a bit more garlic. I tripled it for the amount of bread I used. Butter was just right, but I'll use 4-5 cloves for the same amount of bread next time.

Simply fantastic. Cut up some po-boy and followed the directions. After preparing the crutons for my salad I had some left over so I froze them in a plastic container and used them 3 days later. They were still better than any others I have ever had anywhere. I did add an extra garlic clove.

I used gluten free bread to make these and substitute these crutons in soups instead of soup crackers. Perfect!  I also sprinkled a small amount of garlic salt over crutons before baking.  Excellent!

My mom was visiting, and she couldn't get enough of these as they came out of the oven. Not many actually survived for the salad. Super easy and very tasty!  Hard to pay money at the store for croutons when you realize what a great result you can get at home for a little effort and time.

I used the ends of 5 different loaves of bread that I had previously made and my family had eaten. Therefore, I doubled the recipe. In addition, I added 2 tsp of turmeric and 2 tsp of sugar. They came out excellent!

The quality of the croutons depends on the bread you use. Good bread = delicious croutons.  I will be making this recipe again the next time I have company over. It was delicious.

Easy and wonderful.  I added italian seasoning too. Second time I made it with a mix of olive oil and butter and tossed the croutons on a large metal bowl and sprinkled with parmesan cheese before putting on a cookie sheet and baking.  Bread seemed to hold up better that way.  Stored them in an air tight container.

I made them with too little butter to decrease the calories and then accidentally left them in the oven for too long (I scraped off the too brown part with a grater and no one was the wiser...), so they weren't exceptional. But I can easily imagine that without my mistakes it would have been 5 star food.

These were awesome- I cut back on the butter- used a stick for a french stick I had in the freezer.  We used them on top of the casear salad supreme from this website, but we also snacked on at least half of them before dinner!

This was very good.  I used someone's suggestion about buttering the bread first before cutting. I seasoned with a little salt, but it probably didn't even need it. I also added parmesan cheese just before baking. Made it for a caesar salad tonight.

I'm always looking for ways to spruce up my croutons.  This is a great basic recipe.  I didn't have french bread on hand but I did have stale bagels.  I drizzled olive oil on the cut bagels and sprinkled on sea salt, white ground pepper, Old Bay seasoning and a dash of celery salt.  Stuck them in the oven until they were brown and crispy.  Mmmm!

These croutons turn out the perfect consistency. I used plain white bread since I didn't have any french, and it turned out delicious.

Didn't have French bread but used regular bread cut in cubes. Also, I added some parsley to the butter just to get some color in the croutons.

Followed this recipe as is, and though the croutons had good crunch, the garlic flavor wasn't very strong.  Will need to experiment with seasonings in the future, but will start with this as a base.  My croutons were about 3/4" - 1" cubes which were a little too big.  Next time I'll cut smaller.

i used the magic bullet to blend all the ingredients together. i added some basil and "buttered" the bread on 1 side as per another reviewers suggestion prior to cubing. baked for about 14 minutes and it was perfect! i'm never buying croutons again!

Although this was very good i'm only giving it 3 stars because it tasted like you ripped pieces of your loaf of garlic bread and threw it on your salad. Does make a good garlic bread recipe.

YUM! I used minced garlic from a jar b/c that's what I have and I sprinkled on some Italian seasoning. Don't use the skillet... just put the butter in the microwave. I was supposed to save them for dinner Saturday but they were all eaten last night!

These croutons were really great.  They weren't so tough and hard, just really light & crisp.  They were very buttery (yum!), and on my second batch I added some dried italian herbs and extra garlic powder since we like a little stonger seasoning.
These would make a really nice gift along with a pot of soup, or a homemade soup mix.

These were so good! I used a little bit more bread than stated and rough cut it. I used fresh bread as well and it was no problem. 
Thanks for the great recipe-I will never use store bought again!

This was a great recipe.  I had a whole bunch of leftover bread cubes from having cheese fondue.  I've never made croutons before, but this was a very simple recipe to follow.  I doubled it because I had a lot of bread cubes and I kept throwing them in until I thought it seemed like enough.  I made a big salad with leftover turkey and I made a Roasted Garlic salad dressing.  It was delicious!  I have to say, the croutons were the best part.  I made them out of sunflower bread, wild rice bread and rye bread.  They were fantastic and looked beautiful.  I will definitely make them again!

I don't really care for croutons much, but I decided to try this recipe because I had some left over homemade wheat bread...and my fiance' adores croutons! This recipe made some AMAZING croutons though, and I loved eating them!!! I used galic herb & italian seasoning instead of the minced garlic. The flavor was very real and alive...a mouth full of taste!

I save the ends of my bread machine loaves in a plastic bag in the freezer.  Once I have 6-8 ends saved up I cube them and prepare the recipie as indicated.  If I am going to use the croutons for soup garnishes, I will sprinkle with worstershire sauce prior to baking.
