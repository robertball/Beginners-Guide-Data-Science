I have never before reviewed a recipe online, however, this was so good, and so simple that I felt I had to.  The only thing I added was cooked, sliced, turkey italian sausage to make it a little more filling for my teenage boys.  Even my middle one, who claims to hate eggplant loved this dish, and finished the leftovers the next day!  A keeper for sure!

This dish is very simple and quick to put together (although it does take a good hour to cook). I used about half the cheese to cut down on calories and found that it was still very flavorful because of how strong the goat cheese flavor is. Great meal and surprisingly filling.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it was delicious and easy, but I am still giving a couple of recommendations.  Make sure you cook it at least 60 minutes . . . my eggplant was borderline cooked in a couple of places.  I only used about 8 oz. of the goat cheese (as recommended by others) and added parmesan cheese to the top of mine at the end, which I thought it needed.  Next time I will add a light layer of parmesan and mozzarella to the goat cheese on top before cooking.   And I will cook it 70 minutes to be sure the eggplant is completely cooked.  It's just as good as my eggplant parm recipe, without the extra step of breading and frying the eggplant before assembling . . . love skipping that step!

I had received the eggplant, tomatoes, onions, and garlic from a food pantry.  I slow simmered those last three to make the sauce, it was rustic, flavorful, and easy.  I couldnt afford the goat cheese because I had to make a large batch so I could have dinner and lunch for the week.  I quadrupled the recipe and used a large container of fresh mozzella balls. It took the whole hour to bake, but it was worth it.  Cheesy, saucy. healthy, goodness.  Next time I will use my vegetable peeler to make long thin slices of the eggplant and use a firm cheese i can slice long and thin too.  I know it will take longer to layer, but I think the results will be well worth it.

This was delicious! I used the "Best Marinara" recipe from this site as the pasta sauce. This is a yummy lo-carb way to satisfy my pasta craving! Thanks.

I couldn't see how my eggplant was going to create enough layers using a 9x 13.I used a 8x8 instead.  So it took much longer to cook. I did add some fontina since I was short on the goat cheese. Good flavor but I think it would be better if the eggplant slices were roasted first. And it would cook in much shorter time, too.

I love anything with goat cheese but i was very disappointed in this.  It was alright but i wont be making this again.  It definitely needed some spices added to it.

Didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would, very bland, if I make it again, I was precook zucchini, added some onions and seasonings.  It tasted better the second day.  I love eggplant but maybe goat cheese is not a fan after all.

Great gluten free option to lasagna. However, I used more sauce than called for & still felt like I still needed more sauce to adequately cover the eggplant.

This recipe is amazingly simple and amazingly delicous! All of my roomates wanted a piece after I made it. It did well in the fridge too, the eggplant doesn't get as soggy as pasta noodles do. A great recipe to make for get togethers since it is vegetarian and gluten-free. You could probably even substitute a vegan cheese if you wanted.

For a goat cheese lover I thought this was only ok. It didn't hold any kind of shape at all, just seemed pretty sloppy.

Great way to use eggplant!  I did add sausage as others suggested, and added a little onion, garlic, and wine to dress up the pasta sauce.  With garlic bread on the side, it was a perfect meal.

Delicious and sooo easy to make!  I did, however, substitute ricotta for the goat cheese.  Because there's no pasta it's not as heavy of a dish but just as satisfying.

Only used 6 oz. of goat cheese instead of 11 because that was the size  available at our local store.  Glad I used a smaller amount because I think more would have overwhelmed my husband who has never tried goat cheese. This was an excellent recipe though! Very easy for a weeknight and delicious!

So I made this last night for a friend of mine who works the night shift. He hadn't had anything to eat all day and by the time 11 o'clock rolled around, needless to say, he was HUNGRY. He had two helpings! First time he had ever eaten eggplant! I think I just opened up a new world for him. Thanks so much for this easy and awesome recipe.

You definitely have to cook it longer.  My eggplant was undercooked which I can't stand.  I covered it for the first 30 minutes and then uncovered it for the next 30  minutes.  It was starting to brown too much on top but the eggplant was still not tender.  Either saute it first or bake it (more work) or bake the whole casserole longer.  It was just okay.

This recipe was delicious!  I did, however, add 1 pound sautéed turkey breast with chopped onions to the mix to make it more substantial.  The flavors melded very nicely together.

I made it exactly per the recipe and it was really good.  I will make it again and may change the cheese to sliced mozzarella or fresh mozzarella. Thinking of adding one layer of cooked lasagne noodles for substance .  Easy to make, delicious taste  and easy to vary ingredients.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added parmesan cheese to the layers.  I also added crimini mushrooms that I needed to use up, and Grapevine Italian Street Fair seasoning.  I baked it for 70 minutes.  It was really good and I will definitely fix it again.

My changes were due to what Ihad on hand. First layer crumbled, seasoned goat cheese. Second layer shredded mozzarella. 1 small jar pizza sauce mixed with one can tomato soup, not condensed but serve "as is" kind. Sprinkled grated parm on top. I  sweated the eggplant for 30 min. or so, then wiped dry before using. Cut it fairly thick, so only two layers fit. Yummy and easy. Just using mozzarella would be fine...and cheaper.

I made this tonight and it was awesome!!  I lightly sprayed the sliced eggplant with olive oil, sprinkled some Montreal Steak seasoning and grilled them.  Then coat the bottom of the dish with some marinara sauce instead of spraying it with cooking oil.  Then layered with the grilled eggplants, marinara sauce and used goat cheese with garlic and herb instead of plain.  My 14yr old son had two helpings.  Highly recommend!

I made this with my own home made pasta sauce that included mushrooms  and a yellow bell pepper.  I made it a little spicier than most people do as I add curry powder, cayenne, and allspice.  The allspice takes the bitterness of the tomatos away without the addition of sugar.

 It takes more sauce than the recipe specifies.  I used 3/4 of a 4 quart pan full of sauce and just had enough to cover 4 layers of eggplant.  

I love it.  Eggplant, goat cheese, and a tomato sauce is a great combination.

I love this recipe! The only change I made is using crumbled goat cheese. When I cut it into coins it was good but the cheese just didn't  melt and cover well. Using crumbled made sure there was a consistent flavor in every bite.

This wasn't my favorite recipe. I needed to double it for my family and I added ground beef to homemade sauce. As I suspected, the goat cheese overpowered the entire dish. I love goat cheese but it was a bit much. I will make this again but with a variety of Cheeses to tone down the tartness of the goat cheese. I think this will be amazing with a mozzarella, goat cheese, Parmesan combo and sausage instead of ground beef.

I'm following Dr. Jason Fung's high fat/low carb eating guidelines, which means no refined carbs like pasta.  But I was craving lasagna so decided to try this recipe.  Unfortunately, I left the goat cheese I had just bought, when my daughter and I went to town, in her car and she ended up taking it home with her.  So I had to substitute mozzarella, and I also sprinkled some parmesan on top.  I was bummed because I love goat cheese.  But let me tell you, this came out simply amazing!  I think if someone didn't like this recipe it was because they used a sub par pasta sauce or they just don't like goat cheese.  High quality ingredients make all the difference.  I used the tomato basil pasta sauce by Thrive Market.  Their sauces are far and away the most delicious you can possibly imagine and I believe that is how I ended up with a three-ingredient restaurant quality dish.  This recipe will be made every week in our house!  Thank you for sharing this!

I don't know that I would call it lasagna, because we really missed the noodles, but it was a delicious eggplant casserole. I used a three cheese sauce and sprinkled the top with a shredded Italian cheese blend that I needed to use up. The results were delicious and came together faster and easier than any lasagna I've ever made. I'll make this again.

I always make a recipe as written the first time I make it. This was not very good. I should have salted the eggplant to draw out the water before I put it together. It was watery and even after an hour an a half it still wasn't done in the middle. There are many was to make it to my liking but I might as well right my own recipe.

Great simple recipe, first time using eggplant.  Instead of canned sauce I made sauce by cooking up some garlic, onion and bell peppers with canned tomatoes.  Made bigger portion with 2 eggplants and cooked for about 70 minutes.

Very simple recipe and good results.  Took one reviewer's advice and added some meat, so I put ground turkey in mine to add some more protein.  Would definitely make again.

We enjoyed this recipe - really needed to use some fresh eggplant that we had - my 8 yr old raved about it until he found out is was eggplant - then said he didn't like it - guess I shouldn't have told him - I am going to saute the epplant to soften the slices before adding to dish next time - we also added italian sausage as recommended by other reviewers
