This mac & cheese is incredible! You have no idea what a pain it is for me to make mac & cheese here....2-3 different kinds to make everyone happy. This one pleased everyone! Yay! The only issue I had was the amount of butter. I, literally, poured 1/2c of butter off when it came out of the oven. I'm going to try halving the butter next time. That's the only thing holding this back from being a 5 star recipe for me. Yum! Thank you!!! EDIT: I now make this on a regular basis & use 1 stick of butter only. To us, it's perfection!!

Made this mac n cheese bake per recipe and my family loved it. My wife and mother-in-law and oldest daughter thought it was great as is. My youngest and I, both charter members of BLAm (Bacon Lovers of America) will insist upon the smokey, cured goodness of pig candy being in the recipe next time. I think I might add a little fresh thyme as well as bacon next time I make this, and I will make it again. I think it is a very good rendition of a classic.

We really enjoyed this.  I followed Lisa's recommendation and cut back on the butter.  I will make this again and again!

This is absolutely delicious!  This recipe prompted me to write a review, which I rarely do - it's that good!  I made only a few changes.  I used only 1/3 stick of butter because that's what I had, and it was just the right amount.  I also used shredded Colby Jack and mild Cheddar, and I used lite sour cream instead of regular.  It came out AMAZING and both my husband and mom loved it.  Will definitely make again!

This is by far the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had and I now claim it as "my Mac n Cheese" when I refer to making it. I have made this recipe several times. I actually skip all the steps of mixing things separately and just mix everything together when the macaroni is done and it turns out perfectly. My mouth waters every time I think of this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

10 10 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/230283/tasty-baked-mac-n-cheese/ ... Thanks to Nadine M of the Buzz for recommending this!  This is the front runner in the Mac n Cheese competition.  :)  'Really like the ease of prep with this.  I'm tempted to say it's "Guy-easy," but that might not be "nice."  :D  The only thing all tasters agreed on that would be done next time is the put all the cheese in it, not so much on top.  I didn't do the sauce on the bottom.  'Just mixed it together & greased the pan.  I used 1 stick, 1/2c butter, adding 2T to the pasta; only sharp cheese.  My cream cheese was previously frozen so a little funny textured (looked like what Greek yogurt tastes like, if ya know what I mean. :D) so I added 4 ounces, half the block.  The cayenne isn't too hot; but, for little kids, you might want to have half without or less.  PS This is guy-easy!  ;)

I used half and half instead of regular milk to make it creamier(1 1/4 cups). I added 1/4 cup of mozzarella and Parmesan to the main mixture too. and sprinkled the bottom of baking dish and the top of the mixture with parmesan.  Cover with foil when baking to prevent from drying out.

I made this last night and it was wonderful, used the cheeses I had on hand, mozzarella and sharp cheddar. This was so easy, no roux to make, no waiting for the cheese to melt.  I mixed it up in the afternoon, put it in the fridge til evening, and baked according to directions.  I won't be making any other mac and cheese recipe from now on...Thank you Eva

I made this amazing dish for my son's first birthday party, and we expected around 40 guests so I doubled the ingredients - except the milk. I raised the oven to 400 degrees and baked for 25 minutes. Not only did the kids eat every last bite, but the parents asked for the recipe! It was definitely a hit!

Simply addictive!  I cut the butter in half, skipped the cream cheese because I didn't have any, and added crispy bacon just before it went in the oven.  Can't wait for the next church potluck - they'll think I can cook!

My husband says this is the best dish I've made.  I did just a few additions: added a pon of thick cut bacon cooked crispy then crumbled last in the bowl with pasta and sauce. I then put a layer of crumbled Original Club crackers and didn't toss them in  butter and glad I didn't,  didn't need it. Next I cooked it an extra 5 minutes.  Sooooo good!

I liked this recipe and will make it again, but I will not put in the cayenne next time. My three year old didn't enjoy it as much as he would have otherwise. He agreed that he liked it enough to do it again, but said "Next time don't put pepperoni (pepper). Only for Pizza." So yeah, out of the mouth of babes, no cayenne.

Nothing special as far as my family thought.  Leftovers left uneaten.  Not creamy at all.  Will not make again.

My family and I thought it was pretty good! It wasn't the best thing ever, but it was enjoyable. It was pretty thin at first, but thickened up nicely, though it was a little runny. I did eyeball the cheese, as what the recipe called for looked a little slim, and if I make it again I'll add more noodles, it was a bit thick. It was yummy, though, thanks Eva!

Very good and very easy! I made this for my daughter's birthday party and most of the kids really liked it. I chose the recipe because it was easier than others, which was great! The only thing I didn't like is that it was way too buttery. Per other reviews I actually cut it down and it was still too buttery. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

We love this dish.  This is the third time I have made it.  The first two exactly as written and we loved it.  Did a minor tweak this time.  To the sour cream mixture I added two oz.. of jhalanio Havarti cheese.  Work great added a little extra heat.  LOL maybe to much for me so will cut the cayenne pepper back next time.  Will be making again.

I made Mac and cheese cups with this recipe and doubled everything except the Macaroni and milk. I mixed part of the sour cream mixture in with the macaroni, scooped it into a greased muffin tin, and then poured some more of the mixture on top. I sprinkled some more cheese on top of the cups, baked at 375 for 20 minutes, then broiled it for 4 minutes to get the tops nice and crispy. I would definitely halve the butter because it was pouring out of the muffin tin cups. I also meant to add garlic powder and pepper but forgot this time. Still delicious!

Really tasty and easy!  The cream cheese and sour cream give a nice zip that you don't get with just all regular cheeses.  Nice not to have to deal with making a roux as well!!

ok so I had no sour cream or cayenne, so I subbed milk and extra cheddar, used black pepper instead of cayenne, sprinkled with butter soaked breadcrumbs. used 1 stick butter in recipe.  Guess what,  still tasty.

I have made this twice now. The first time, I followed it to a T. It was dry, and bland. The second time I added extra cheese, and used heavy cream instead of milk. I also added mustard, onion, and garlic. The flavor was much improved, but the texture was still extremely dry. We will not be making this again.

We substituted a box of Jerusalem artichoke noodles (12 ounces instead of 16). Otherwise followed the suggested ingredients and baked for 40 minutes instead of 15 minutes. Made the best (simple) Mac n cheese! Very easy, very satisfying. Served with stewed tomatoes and a salad.

Very tasty. I also reduced the butter to 1 cube. I put 1/2 cube in pasta and half in sauce.  3 out of 4 of us really enjoyed it. I have 1 son who thought it was too hot & spicy with cayenne in it. Next time I would put half the amount of cayenne. I also gave it extra time in oven for a total of about 25 min.

I used heavy cream instead of milk, added mozzerella and queso fresca along with french onions and bread crumbs... and cooked it for 25 mins. It must be a mistake when it says to cook about 15 mins. It was a hit! Gone in the same night. Super creamy, cheesy and yummy!

I did not like this recipe. I followed the recipe except lowered the butter like many reviews suggested. The cheese did not get creamy at all and instead had a thick texture that I couldn't stand. I guess i'm spoiled on KFC's mac and cheese because I could eat that all day and all others taste aweful to me. I give it 2 stars because my husband liked it, although he didn't love it. I will look for a creamier recipe next time.

Very good & creamy. I made a few minor changes: I only used sharp cheddar instead of mild and sharp. I left out the cayenne since my 4 yr old would have spotted it. I also increased the cream cheese to 1/4 c. Then I just stirred the whole lot together and put in the casserole to bake rather than layering.

Good recipe. I will not use parchment paper next time, it started ripping off with the serving spoon.
I added additional spices: curry, paprika, tumeric, garlic, ginger.
I also added additional cheese flavors & frozen peas.

Love this recipe. I like to add a little extra Jack cheese, a package of crispy cooked bacon, and 2 finely diced jalepenos. I've passed this recipe with modifications on to several people and I havent met anyone who doesnt love it.

I doubled this recipe for a big Thanksgiving crowd and really didn't care for it. It was easy to make and looked wonderful when it was finished baking. However, it didn't have much flavor and the texture was lacking. Very bland

This is hands-down the best mac and cheese I've ever had. It's so creamy and flavorful. I'm sure it's very fattening though, and the ingredients can be expensive so I only make it on special occasions.

I don’t know. It’s good but I could taste the cream cheese. Maybe it needs to be mixed more and/or baked longer than 15 minutes.

Made this for the first time. Used half and half cream instead of milk. Doubled up on Philadelphia cream cheese. On top layer of cheese went with a 50/50 on Colby Jack & Sharp Cheddar. Added a panko bread topping by mixing it with butter than adding on top. Turned out great and everyone loved it. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This recipe is money! ALL of the kids loved it! Even the kids-at-heart. Only thing I changed was adding some Gouda to the mixture. We served with chili and the boys all mixed both together at the table into their own chili Mac. Fabulous. Winner for the kids is a winner for me!

Followed tips and reduced total butter to 1/2 c.  Used reduced cayenne to a pinch and added a pinch of paprika.  Also added about 1/2 c of Italian bread crumbs on top with about 1/4 C of Parmesan cheese spreaded evenly. I covered with foil for first 10 and took off for last 5mins.

I made this tonight and it was awesome! I put the butter in with the sour cream mixture but forgot to put it in with the noodles and from others reviews that's a good thing. I also sprinkled the top with breadcrumbs and it gave it a nice extra something. Also I didn't use cayenne pepper because I have 2 little boys that wouldn't like the spice! I reheated it for a midnight snack and it was still nice and creamy!

Very delicious!  I did use regular pepper instead of the cayenne because I wasn't sure everyone would like it if it were spicy.  Also.....GENIUS one the parchment paper!!!!!  It scooped out of the pan so easily and clean up was a breeze.

I halved the sharp cheddar and added approximately 4 oz of mozzarella in its place. Added the 8 oz of mild cheddar as directed (Hal of which I stirred into the Mac n cheese. The other half of mild cheddar went on top, along with about 4 oz of Mexican blend cheese. Baked for the 15 minutes suggested and turned off oven, leaving fish in the oven while preparing sides and plates. Absolutely delicious.

I didn’t have cheddar cheese so used Mexican cheese blend and Colby jack instead plus 1/2 cup Parmesan in the top layer. I also followed advice and cut butter to one stick. I also sprinkled Parm breadcrumbs and more Parmesan on one half as an experiment. Both sides were delish- I preferred the side with the breadcrumbs because of the crunch and because I love Parm. My nephews ate it up (I gave them the non- Parm side as it seemed more kid friendly) and my sister said it was the best Mac and cheese she’d ever had. Definitely a keeper!

I wanted to try a different recipe for Mac N cheese and choose this one.  I usually make a rue for my cheese sauce but, went ahead and made this one.  I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I will not be making it again.

It was delicious and easy to make! It did taste a bit spicy and I really liked it, however it was unconventional for my boyfriend! He is a very traditional mac n cheese man so next time I will take out the cayenne pepper, but I loved it!

Followed the recipe, exactly. I was disappointed as there wasn’t that cheesy flavor other reviewers raved about.  Very bland. Not sure what I did wrong.

Nope: I’m a baked Mac n cheese snob and this wasn’t good. I don’t know what I’d even do to change it but I was NOT having it. I got compliments at thanksgiving when I brought it but I have no idea why, I’m never making it again. I hate to leave a bad review but, the app keeps prompting me so here it is.

I'm only putting it as 3 cuz I thought it was ok but not great but I'll make it again and probably change that. I didn't put enough cheese and stuff in it or so I thought. Everyone at the potluck was raving about it but I just think cuz they are all moms and were being sweet to me. I liked the kick from the cayenne pepper. Next time I'm putting more cheese and more everything and we'll see how that goes.

Like others have stated, it had a good flavor but was not creamy at all.  I won't make again.

Been trying to find a homemade Mac n cheese recipe for awhile. And I found it! I’ve made this probably about 5-7 times. And nothing but great reviews from my family and my husband. And some of these people are hard to please. I personally cut the butter down in the noodles by half and that’s it. Sometimes I don’t soften the butter for the sour cream mix as well so I’ll put those chunks in the noodles to melt. So that’s my other “half” persay. Followed recipe minus the butter amount and it comes out wonderful each time. No complaints! Highly recommend.

I have a new favorite baked mac & cheese recipe.  I served this at our Labor Day cookout and it was a huge hit.  It's so quick and easy to make!

In following the reviews, I just mixed all the ingredients together (excluding the mild cheddar), then mixed in the cooked macaroni, and then spread the mixture into a 13 x 9 Pyrex dish.  I added the mild cheddar on top, covered the pan with tin foil, and baked for about 20 minutes (my oven cooks cool).  It turned out wonderful.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Recipe as is good. The only way I would make it again is if I were to add hot dogs, andouille, or bacon.

A very good Mac & Cheese.  I double everything but the butter, substitute Chipotle Tabasco Sauce to taste for the cayenne pepper, mix everything together, and bake in one large Pyrex bowl.  This is perfect for large gatherings.

Tasty.  I used less butter, actually used ghee, added some chopped up andouille sausage for a little kick and baked it 5 minutes longer for a crunchier top

I made this recipe last night and it really is delicious. I was looking for a low calorie recipe but could not find one so I simply followed this recipe with all reduced fat and low fat ingredients. Even using almond milk. The three ingredient changes I made were to use mozzarella cheese instead of the mild cheddar and I added two garlic cloves and used 1/4 of butter in the sour cream mixture and 1/8 of butter in the macaroni once it was done. 4 stars because the recipe was super easy to follow!

Loved this recipe.  Rich, cheesy and loved the kick with the cayenne.  I think I gave it just a touch more cayenne than recipe called for.  I plan to make again!

It was ok.  I mixed it all together and lessened the butter a bit like some other reviews stated but it turned out somewhat dry.  I added some butter and a little more cheese on top when it had almost finished baking.  I think I'll stick to my old recipe.

This was my first time making macaroni and cheese (not from a box) and it was fantastic. I read some of the other reviews and added only 1/4 cup of butter, but doubled the cream cheese and it was perfect. Highly recommend!

Excellent and easy to make. I reduced the butter to half cup and used gluten-free pasta (Tinkyada Pasta Joy elbow macaroni) and flour. It  drew rave reviews at Christmas lunch from die-hard mac'n'cheese fans, including the teenagers. This is my go-to baked mac'n'cheese from now on.

Suggested items for editing:

Under point 4 delete the following sentence since all sour cream used up in the bottom of the casserole + in the sauce:

Stir remaining sour cream sauce into macaroni. 

The following sentence is not in line with the 25 minutes indicated as cook time in the header:

Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese topping has melted, about 15 minutes.

This was super tasty and moist!! I used a block of 11 oz of sharp cheddar from the cheese section. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of ground mustard. My 11 niece said it was so god she asked for seconds! My husband loved it!

It turned out really good! Didn't have parchment paper, but used spray cooking oil instead on the bottom. Added ham bits to make it a main dish with garden peas served on the side. Used mac n' cheese mix in the box from Dollar General (what I had on hand). Will make this recipe again for sure.

I made this for dinner one night and it was AMAZING!!! Though I did think it was a little greasy and too rich but I should have made a half recipe because there was so much leftover but even after it was microwaved it was delicious. I am definitely going to make this again.

I used a different method in the steps I made it, but THIS is the only recipe I've run across with every NECESSARY INGREDIENT for a tasty home cooked BAKED mac & cheese! I only adjusted everything to my taste & memory that mom use to make & finally perfection! She would proud.  Thanks!! So much! One of my all time fav dishes yet so hard to find or create.

Turned out amazing! Used 10 oz gluten free elbow pasta instead, used a tsp of xanthan gum instead of flour (could also substitute with gluten free flour), and left out cream cheese simply because we didnt have any when i made it.

Excellent recipe. I've made several times. You can substitute any cheese you want. I just mix it all in a big pot then put in the baking dish. No need to do layers or make the mix separate. It blends nicely. No need to use parchment paper; I grease the pan with bacon grease. Family loves it!

The best baked mac and cheese I have ever had!  I cut out the paprika because I don't like it, and added just a hint of garlic.  I think next time I will cut back the cheese a bit and add more cream cheese.  I also don't see the point of putting all the sauce on the bottom of the baking pan, it just means more to clean/throw away.  I'll mix it all in next time.

This recipe is delicious. I used half sharp and half Alpine Cheddars. Plus I used twice as much cream cheese because I could. Oh yum! Thanks.

I have made this mac n cheese several times by the recipe and it has been delicious every time. When I recently thought of making it again, I noticed some ground turkey I had to use before spoiling so, I modified the recipe to use it. I followed the recipe for the cheese sauce except I used red cayenne pepper in place of the black pepper. I also added some ground turkey and peas that I cooked in paprika and pepper. Then I threw some fresh parmesan cheese, pepper and paprika on top before baking. It has a bit of a kick from the spices and it was quite delicious.

Hands down the best baked mac n cheese I have made. Thank you for the recipe. I did take the advice of another review and only use one stick of butter and it turns out perfect. When I get "this is better than my Mom's" from my husband... it is a winner. (love you Mom)

Was trying to get my sister to like Mac & Cheese and I succeed with this recipe. I only made 1/2 the recipe in case she didn't like it. I add one medium onion fried and chopped cooked bacon. Didn't have any regular cream cheese so used Philadelphia Herb & Garlic cream cheese spread and probably used about 2 tablespoons as I wanted to empty the container. Didn't use anywhere near the butter it said to. I stirred about 1 tablespoon into the cooked pasta and maybe about 1/4 cup in the sauce. I used a a whole package of Cracker Barrel Tex Mex shredded cheese (320 grams/3 cups) putting about 2/3 of it into the sauce and the rest on top. I did not put any sour cream of the bottom of the dish I just used it all in the sauce. I sprayed a small baking dish with PAM avoiding fighting with the parchment paper. Will make this again seeing as I now have my sister loving Mac & Cheese.

I used the exact same ingredients without measuring everything. I've taught myself to just use more sour cream, less cream cheese than sour cream, 1 or 2 tablespoons of flour, if I want more sauce mix use 2 eggs if not use 1 and a half cup of milk. Turned out perfectly. Check out my picture. Also once it's done cooking I broil it for about 10 mins so it can be crispy at the top. My favorite dish!!

Just made this tonight & I dig it. I pretty much followed the recipe, but I only used half the butter like Lisa said in her review. I didn't use parchment paper, I just sprayed the dish with cooking spray. I also used smoked paprika instead of cayenne pepper & added an extra tablespoon of cream cheese. I stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes after it was done baking & it turned out awesome. I have a baby shower to go to this weekend & I'll be taking this with me. Good stuff! :)

My bestie was over last night and we were BOTH craving mac 'n cheese. Made this recipe and we both loved it (as did all 8 of our kids)! We've been searching for a relatively easy and less expensive version of our favorite dish for a while and this was it! I used Sharp cheddar only and also used a whole egg instead of just the yolk. Definitely will make again!

This is the BEST MAC N CHEESE I've EVER made. I also learn not to leave it out too long or else the cheese on top gets really dry and doesn't taste as good. Other wise it is AMAZING!!!!

I made this with the suggestion of mixing all the ingredients together (minus the cheese topping) and then mixing well with the pasta.  Oh my!!!  This is PERFECT!!  My go to from now on.

Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

I  was excited to make it but used condensed milk instead. I'm not used to grainy Mac n cheese. It was something new to try but the next round I'm going to remove the flour or egg which probably make it taste grainy. Will try again soon

I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I just used the whipping cream and a teaspoon of vinegar (let sit for a bit) It tasted wonderful!

This was super tasty! I ended up leaving out the cream cheese because I didn't have any. I used mozzarella and colby-jack cheeses. I also didn't use as much cheese as called for. It wasn't quite as creamy as I wanted it to be, so when I make it again, I will likely add more milk or maybe more sour cream - or maybe I'll make sure to have the cream cheese! I also added some pan fried hotdogs (because we always add hotdogs to mac and cheese).
