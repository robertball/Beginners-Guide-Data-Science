I scaled this for 12 on Easter, and it was a huge hit. I had tested it out the night before on a couple girlfriends and made a couple changes that I believe really helped the dish. 

1) Increased the garlic (doubled it)
2) Chopped a medium onion up and threw it in the pan just as the bacon was finishing cooking. Then when I threw the bacon in with the beans the onions went in too. Combined with the garlic it gave it just the flavors it needed. 
It was such a hit everyone was asking for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I made this dish for Thanksgiving at my parents, so I cooked it right before I left and just reheated it a little once I was there.  I would not change a thing to the ingredients, but had to make some slight adjustments to the cooking times.  I needed to cook the beans much longer than 3 minutes to thaw them.  Also, when I put the feta cheese and beans in at the same time, the cheese melted before the beans were hot enough.  This resulted in the cheese turning in to a big glob that I had to cool and tear apart.  I think next time I would cook the beans with the onion powder and pepper and then add the cheese when the beans are hot enough.  It was delicious though.  Everyone who tried it loved it and I gave the recipe out to several people.

Who wouldn't be intrigued with the idea of feta cheese on green beans?  I just had to try it.  Hubs would have no part of it, but part of the beauty of this recipe was that it was easy enough to accomodate both of us. I used fresh green beans rather than the frozen, not that I wouldn't have used the frozen if fresh weren't available.  I threw some finely chopped onion in with the bacon and garlic and so omitted the onion powder.  To finish, I didn't mix the feta cheese into the beans because, simply put, I didn't like that idea. I just sprinkled some of the feta over the top upon serving.  Unusual and delicious with quite a nice presentation, particularly for just...green beans.  Great recipe, and certainly best if not cooked beyond crisp-tender.

Good, but not great.  This needs slight modifications...I have a new microwave and my beans did not cook in 3 minutes.  Wish I would have tasted one before adding to the pan.  This needs more garlic and onion.  Next time I try this I will steam fresh beans and use them.

Green beans, feta and bacon-- all my favorite things!  Made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a real hit.  I used fresh green beans and steamed them for 10 mins before adding to frypan.  Be sure to soak your frypan right away so the cheese residue doesn't stick; this makes for an easier clean-up.  We really enjoyed this and I'm definitely going to add it to my holiday repetoire.

This is a great side dish to bring to a BBQ or summer party. I use the Green Giant Full Length Green Beans Steamable Bags and add crumbled bacon, feta & seasonings as soon as I take it out of bag. So fast and tons of compliments!

Made these for our family Thanksgiving potluck. Wanted a new twist on green beans and thought these sounded good, but they were only so-so. (Also made the Syrian Green Beans which were awesome!)
I think the flavors worked well together, just too overwhelming for the beans. I will perhaps make them again, but cut down on both the feta and bacon. Used fresh green beans -- about 1 lb, partially cooked for about 5 mins in microwave, drained, then proceeded w/recipe. Just seemed too heavy, though I love both feta and bacon.

4 stars as written because why would anyone use frozen when you can easily use fresh? Mine was a 5 star dish because I used fresh green beans, steamed. My family loved it. Will be making often.

Followed the recipe exactly, while I loved the bacon and the feta I did not like the beans.  Maybe it was because these were frozen beans I'm not sure.  I plan on trying this recipe with fresh beans and see if that makes a difference!

Very good. I put the green beans mix and feta cheese in the oven so the feta could melt more prior to serving. You must like feta to enjoy this. But if you are a fan of feta cheese, this recipe is a sure fire winner.

Really good! I used bacon bits- using a little olive oil to saute' with. I had to cook the green beans 5 minutes in the microwave to thaw. Cooking it this way takes about 15 minutes total. A delicious, easy, low carb side dish!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I might try it with turkey bacon next to cut some of the fat and sodium out.  It also freezes and reheats well.

These came out yummy! I did use fresh, cooked in my electric steamer for about 16 minutes and just let air dry while I was making the rest of dinner and then followed the recipe.

I made this without the bacon and it was AWESOME!!  I cut down the portion size to 4.  The green beans were a little cold so make sure to heat them up good in the pan & test before serving. UPDATE: I also made them with canned whole green beans.  I microwaved for 1 minute then put them in the pan of bacon grease and added the ingredients.  SUPERB!!

Excellent! And not only did it go fast, but I was able to make it quickly (all in the same skillet).  When browning the bacon, I cut the slices into 2-3" pieces.  Leaving it in the skillet, I drained most of the grease.  Because I was using an electric Wok, I then simply added of the remaining ingredients (except the cheese).  Since I let the frozen beans thaw while the bacon was browning, I did NOT cook them in the microwave first.  After the beans were cooked, I then add the feta cheese!   This was a huge hit!

This was easy to make and simply excellent.  I didn't even bother with the onion powder and black pepper, because we prefer a very strong feta I knew would be seasoning enough. (Don't skip the garlic, though.)  It was a rich side and definitely not what you make if you really want the flavor of green beans.  But, it was great for dressing up our weeknight dinner, and I can easily see it as a company dish.

This is so good!  If you love feta, you will love this. I have made it twice now and just got around to reviewing it. I think I like using a little less bacon and not quite 4oz. of feta!  The kids loved it as well!

We had this last night and it's fantastic!  My new favorite way to make green beans.  I did cheat and use canned beans, since I wanted to try this and had no frozen or fresh.  I just sauteed them in olive oil (2 1/2 cans) rather than bacon grease, then added garlic to the beans and proceeded with the recipe.  I used a handful of pre-cooked bacon crumbles stirred in with the feta.  I'll be making this often in our house, as it was a favorite.  Thanks for sharing.

Thanks, this was a good vegetable side dish.  I used 1/2 bag of bacon bits and 3 oz feta.  It was very flavorful.

These were delicious!    I went from another rater's suggestion and used olive oil and bacon bits instead of real bacon, and it still turned out yummy!  The only problem I found is that when you do this the bacon bits and the feta cheese stuck together, but it was still great!

Made this for the first time tonight. Due a picky eater I substituted the feta cheese for goat cheese and used cooked bacon I had on hand. Next time I’ll used fresh green beans and feta cheese, maybe add some walnuts for some extra crunch.

Will be making again! I used bacon bits bc I didn’t feel like frying up bacon. I just made make shift bacon grease by adding beef bullion to a couple of table spoons of olive oil. Next time, I be extra and make the bacon and use the grease for the flavor. Every bite had so much flavor!

I used fresh green beans and steamed until almost cooked.  Simple to make.  Everyone liked them.  I think the key is the Feta added just after the beans, onion, and garlic have cooked until tender, then to turn off the heat just as the Feta starts to melt.

Great recipe! I left out the feta cheese until everything finished and put the green beans and bacon into a container with a lid and poured the feta on top and closed the lid so it was slightly melted but still crumbly. ??

What a great twist on the typical- family loved and we will definitely make again! To speed things up after work, I steamed a 12 oz bag of green beans (fresh-not frozen) and then tossed with real Hormel bacon bits, feta cheese, onion powder and garlic powder while it was hot and served after the cheese softened.

Made this twice over the Thanksgiving holiday using blanched fresh green beans(instead of frozen), chopped onions sauted before adding green beans to the pan (instead of onion powder).  Both sets of guests loved it as did my family!!

Super easy to make! It was delicious and quick. Im 13 and found this super easy and a family favorite. If you want, you could use fresh beans for a crispier result, but for soft beans this was really good! RECCOMENDED

My husband and I really enjoyed these. My young girls didn't really eat them very well and they usually like green beans but I think they didn't  recognize them! Very yummy. I didn't give it 5 stars because my kids didn't eat much and the fact that you take an otherwise healthy veg and add lots of saturated fat. We will try again maybe next time with turkey bacon like another reviewer said.

Really yummy. I would recommend fresh green beans. Just steam until tender. They were a great addition to my Thanksgiving.

Wow, these were the best! I've tried many recipes with fresh green beans from my garden, and I can't find anything to give them enough flavor. This was it! My husband even liked them, and he's hard to please with vegetables! I only made 1/2 of the green beans that I had picked in case we didn't like them, but I was regretting not making them all. It was so easy- I steamed them, sprayed them with olive oil, and added the onion powder, bacon bits, and feta cheese.

This was great!  I used turkey bacon and did not put onion powder in because I did not have any. I will make sure I have it next time as I think it would only make it better. I also put a bit more minced garlic in because my fiance and I love garlic. Real bacon would make it better but we're watching our weight and that's all we had. To keep it warm while I made other things, I put it in an aluminum pan and put it in the oven on 250F for 10 min. 

Thanks!!!

I made this for Valentines Day & it turned out great.  It was quick & easy.  I ended up getting the cut green beans that self steam in the bag in the microwave.  I think they were by Jolly Green Giant.  The shortest cooking time was 6 min. so I put it in for 5 1/2 min then added it to the bacon & garlic & added the cheese.  And cooked it about 1 1/2min so the cheese didn't clump.  I plan on making it again next week.

This was an awesome recipe. The only thing I'd change would be to use canned green beans, frozen were just too crunchy. That's more a personal preference, tho.

Unbelievably good! I make this whenever possible. I used frozen green beans (they ones in the microwavable bag) and also used turkey bacon instead. Delicious.

These beans were tasty! I brought them to Thanksgiving at my sister's house and everyone loved them. I used uncured/nitrate-free bacon to offset the saltiness of the imported feta. The dish was definitely the best when they were freshly made, but leftovers were passable, too. The problem with the leftovers is that the feta kind of disappeared - maybe I crumbled it too small or something initially. Anyway, I won't hesitate to make this dish again.

Didn't work at all.  The feta and bacon clung together and not to the green beans.

Sooooo good! Any strong, salty cheese seems to work. I used extra sharp English cheddar since that's what I had on hand. I might try turkey bacon next time to cut out some of the fat. I will definitely be making this again (maybe tomorrow!).

I LOVED these beans. My fiance will never eat vegetables, but he gave these a try after I mentioned bacon. He had seconds. Turkey bacon works well too.

It's very tart for my taste.  I had to add sugar.  It didn't have enough flavor for me.  I added a little salt, thyme, basil in addition to the onion powder, garlic and pepper.  Next time I'm going to try it with another type of cheese.  I want something that isn't "cheesy", but is sweeter than feta.

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!  This was awesome.  I didn't use a full 4 ounces of the feta (almost though).  This is a very rich dish.  Very filling too!

The feta flavor is very strong; you may wish to decrease the amount of feta somewhat.  Hubby said it was interesting but not a keeper.

I tested this recipe for the Thanksgiving feast. WOW.. Everyone loved it. Instead of frozen green beans I used fresh. It is a recipe I will be using again for sure.

This recipe is quite good.  I asked a Greek friend of mine about the combo and she said she'd been using feta and green beans forever (but had never heard of adding bacon.)
Although I doubled the recipe, I only used 6 oz of feta and the taste of the feta was quite strong.  Since I like feta, no problem.  I used one package of thick-sliced bacon.  I figure it wasn't quite 16 slice, but it should have been the same amount.  Anyway, I liked it and my Peruvian wife liked it as well.  Silicon Vally says, "way to go."
