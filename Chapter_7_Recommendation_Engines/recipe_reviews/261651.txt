I want to make this. I read the ingredient list, watched the video to see how it’s prepared. To my understanding. Aren’t nachos made with tortilla chips. I’m going to try that. It’ll be salty sweet.

This was a tasty creation and was unusual in its presentation, but I did find it a little difficult to get from the plate to my mouth.  I appreciate the versatility of the ingredients.  This should be eaten fairly immediately after finishing production and if refrigerated should be left at room temperature to eat.  I would like next time to drizzle this with caramel sauce!  Thank you, Hershey's Kitchens!

This recipe was so good, and you can easily get your health conscious friends to join you in this sweet and delicious dessert.  It's healthy for you, it has APPLES!  ;)  Just remember when you go to melt the chocolate that the little black bits will not melt down.  I forgot to read that part, but all was well.  It tasted great and everyone was raving about the recipe.  And it was healthy too! :)
