Ack! "Do not brown the onions"??? That's the best part of French Onion soup, the rich, caramelized onions! The ingredients for this soup are great, but I did cook my onions until they were a sweet and dark brown (not burnt) before adding the stock and other ingredients. Try it, you will be amazed at the richness it adds. I also like to toast the French bread a bit before it goes onto the soup, the bread is less slimy soggy if it is toasted.

Delicious!!!! I give this 10 stars with a few minor changes. I used less than half the amount of butter, and PLEASE be sure to caramelize the onions! Instead of sherry, I opted for a dry red wine and make sure you toast your bread before putting under the broiler with the cheese. Otherwise it is just too soggy. Thanks!

I LOVE French Onion Soup!!  My hubby and I use to have to go to one of our finer restaurants in town (that is not kid-friendly so we had to find a babysitter too) to get the best onion soup in town but thanks to Lori Levin, I can make it myself!  I sliced about 5 large onions and cooked them for about 40 minutes over med heat, stirring them once in a while.  Then I added 1 minced garlic clove in for about one minute before adding 1/2 cup white wine (a bit more than 2 tbsp!).  I let it cook until almost dry then I sprinkled the onions with flour and cooked that (while constantly stirring) for about 3 minutes.  Then I added 5 cans of beef broth and cooked for about 20 minutes.  I used grated Gruyere and this was absolutely the best french onion soup I have ever had and I can't believe I made it myself!!  Thanks Lori!!

This is very close to a recipe I have been using for the past 30 years or so.  The only changes/suggestions that I would make are to add a tablespoon of Worchester Sauce and use all butter instead of the olive oil. Make sure that you saute the onions well. (Also, make sure that you slice the onions into fairly wide slices, about 1/2-3/4" wide.)  You don't want them burnt, but you do want them browned.  I use Campbell's Double-Rich Beef Consumme and 1/4 cup of Sherry.    For the cheese, I put a tablespoon of FRESH shredded Parmesan cheese on the bottom of the bowl, then ladle on the soup, then top with a large homemade crouton, then the swiss cheese, and another tablespoon of the fresh Parmesan.    For the croutons, take a large wine-glass and press into a slice of thick bread to get the perfect circle for your soup bowl.  Spread with butter and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Put in the oven at 250 for about 1/2 hour or until they are dried and crisp.

After ordering this soup many times at restaurants, this recipe reproduces precisely what French Onion Soup is supposed to taste like. Look, French Onion Soup a challenging soup to eat: chunks of chewy cheese and soggy bread floating on top...but it's supposed to be that way. I often suggest additions or subtractions to a recipe, but here I suggest you stick with the recipe as is. I've made this recipe many times exactly as indicated and everyone loves it. Nice job. Easy to make. Tasty.

The basic recipe is very good with easy to find ingredients.  I didn't like fighting with all the bland provalone cheese.  So now I use Gruyere and Romano cheeses for more flavor.  
The sherry is not optional - buy a good one and add it near the end of cooking.  
Use a spanish white onions for more intense flavor (Vidalia if you want it subtler)

I have tried many french onion soups and this is one of the best. It was not salty, nor was it overly sweet, it was perfectly seasoned. The only thing I had trouble with was judging how much onion to use. I used two large white onions and found that to be perfect. I cooked the onions for a half hour before I added the broth, and used the sherry, which I think is necessary in making this. This recipe did not need any additional seasonings, it's perfect as printed.I did use beef stock instead of broth though. The stock I used is Kitchen Basics and it is sold in a juice box like container. Using it will make any soup much better than canned broth! This recipe is a keeper, thanks for sharing Lori!

OH-MY-GOSH!!  I cannot believe how simple AND delicious this soup is!!  I doubled the recipe and brought this to our family Sunday fiasco and the crock pot was emptied!!  They LOVED it, not to mention they think I can cook!  I used 1 large vidalia onion, 1 large white onion, and about 4-5 med yellow onions (which I put on my sunglasses & stuck tissue up my nose while slicing, time to invest in a slicer as my hubby really thinks I'm a nut, hey, but it worked)!  I sauteed those in the onion and oil then threw it all in the crotch pot.  Oh and I used half of the full strength broth (10.75 oz Campbells), and half swanson, which is diluted.  And I added the Parmesan to the soup as it brewin'.  Thanks so much Lori, it IS great!

My guy loves onion soup and he said this was a good as any he's eaten in fine restaurants.  It's very simple to make.  Like others my only additions were 1 beef bouillon cube and 2 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce.  I did make one mistake - when it was simmering I forgot to cover it and I ended up only having enough for 3 - a lot of it evaporated - so remember to cover!!!!  Thanks submitter - will be making this often.

I've been trying to perfect the onion soup for years, and this recipe served as a perfect base. I try onion soup every chance i get, and I still say mine is the best. This recipe is simple and delicious as is, but here are my tweaks to take it up a notch into perfect (or as close as i've come to date).
1. Use 2 Large Yellow Onions/2 Lg Red Onions
2. Use 1/2 the butter, that's simply too much
3. Caramelize the onions. Naturally. Throw a couple pinches of salt during this process to help the onions sweat.
4. Add 2 cloves minced garlic (w/ onions)
5. Use FRESH THYME Bundle and Bay Leaves and add them WITH the onions.
6. Use 1C Red Wine to deglaze onions. Bring to Boil then Down to simmer and add broth
7. (Here's my magical twist). 6 Cups of Broth - 4 Beef, 2 Chicken (I use Better than Boullioun paste because it's not too salty and therefore I can control the salt)
8. Add 2 tsp Worcestier Sauce (oh...this is key)
9. Chunk and toast french Baguette before adding to soup
10. Shredded GRUYERE Cheese. If you can't find Gruyere, 2 Provolone slices is fine..don't use Swiss. (still dash some parm/romano on there)

Voila.

As written, I can only give this a three star. It is a basic onion soup recipe that is tasty, but lacks the full-bodied flavor of great onion soup. If you do not carmalize your onions, the soup does not have the sweet flavor of a good onion soup. To carmelize you need to saute at a low heat and be very patient. It typically takes me about an hour to carmelize the 4 cups of onion. Also, cut the fat in this recipe if you are going to try it. No need to fill this recipe with about 150 grams of fat as written. Use just enough fat to keep your onions from burning.

YOU DO HAVE TO BROWN THE ONIONS!!! This is what gives depth to the soup. I also toast the bread before putting it in the soup.  You put one toast at the bottom of the bowl, a little bit of cheese, the soup and the last toast with a lot of cheese on top and the you broil.

Here is a hint for cutting the onions, leave the root side for last.  All the tears are in that end.  My uncle gave me this tip and I never cry while cutting the onions.

You know, I decided that I wanted to re-review this recipe. As I search on allrecipes.com for recipes, namely, french onion soup recipes (cause of curiousity) I wonder why anyone else even bothers submitting different recipes. This is the BEST french onion soup I have EVER had and my family and friends BEG me to make it. I crave it almost daily. I only make it a few times a year, though. It freezes well, and it tastes FANTASTIC. Don't even bother with other recipes... this is it!!! Personally, I add a lot more dry sherry than the recipe calls for... I honestly think that's what makes this recipe so good.

I can't imagine French onion soup without caramelizing the onions; that required sauteing them for about 35 minutes for me. I used sweet onions to get the most out of the caramelization due to their higher sugar content. I omitted 2T of the fat, salt (there's plenty in the cheeses!), used low-sodium beef broth & French sourdough bread, baked & toasted.  Additionally, I added a clove of fresh minced garlic, used a sprig of fresh thyme rather than dried, fresh mozzarella cheese rather than provolone to achieve that gooey cheese thing, and the nutty goodness of Gruyere for my Swiss cheese.  The sherry brought it over the top.  Great tasting soup, for us, with these changes.  Thanks, Lori!

Hubby and I just recently started eating French Onion soup so I thought I should try to make some... made today for lunch(perfect day for it..snowing outside).. it turned out quite good. I caramelized the onions and probably added a bit more cheese than called for.. also added some worsteschire(sp?)couple dashes and added some minched garlic when cooking the onions.. I used garlic parmesean croutons..only thing I would change next time would be to cut down the butter.. you could almost taste it. Overall this is a keeper!

this is a great base recipe! I used a mixture of red spanish onions, and yellow onion. sliced thin, then carmelized them for over an hour. I used 2 minced garlic cloves, 5 c. beef broth, 1c. chicken broth..deglazed my pan with 1/2C. white wine (DO DEGLAZE YOUR PLAN!! use something - red wine, vermouth, champagne, sherry,, it *really* adds to the flavor!!!), then put it all in my slow cooker on low, for the rest of the afteroon (3 hours?), with bunches of fresh thyme, and some crushed bay leaves. before eating, I grated some fresh parmesan, and put 'a small handfull' into the bottom of each bowl, then ladled the soup into my FOS bowls,, with a slice of toasted french bread (next time I think I will make the croutons, as the sliced bread was a little hard to cut through after baking. I think a 'stuffing/crumb' topping would be better IMO). used a thin slice of gruyere overtop each bowl, w/ some chopped chives. VERY IMPRESSED. will make again, pronto

You MUST caramelize the onions and toast the bread or this isn't classic French Onion Soup! Simmering all day also helps to produce a rich deep soup broth and adds to the flavor.

Delicious soup which I'll be making again.  Unfortunately I didn't have large bread slices so I just used a couple of small slices from a baguette and broiled some shredded cheese on top but it wasn't nearly as yummy as putting the whole thing under the broiler with lots of cheese on it but I've given it a top rating because the onion broth was so tasty.  I have to buy some onion soup bowls and will try it again when I've done that.

This was pretty good.  I know what I will do next time to make it a 5-star recipe.  The sherry seemed to overpower the soup and gave it too much sweetness.  So, I put a bit of red wine vinegar in it to take away the sweetness and that really helped.  The beef broth I used was Trader Joe's organic beef broth.  I wouldn't skimp on the broth.  The onions really must be carmelized for the best flavor.  I toasted thick slices of Trader Joe's French baguettes and put Trader Joe's "Quattro Formaggio" on top.  Quattro Formaggio is a cheese blend of Parmesan, Asiago, Fontina, and mild Provolone which was a wonderful blend of cheeses to compliment the French onion soup.

Super yummy!  I halved the recipe and used plain yellow onions, which I sauteed in the butter/oil combo until caramelized, about 30 minutes.  To speed up the caramelization, I sprinkled the onions with a little sugar and salt.  I also used fresh thyme from the garden vs. dry, and added a teaspoon or so of beef bullion powder. One tip I had to make the soup a little less "greasy"- I dipped my bread slices in the pot of onions before adding the broth to soak up some of the butter/oil before toasting the bread in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes.  Mmmm!

Wonderful recipe.  Many others did not call for Provolone (we are not Swiss fans), and I only had Sherry on hand (rather than red wine) so I chose this recipe over all the others.  Despite the finicky eaters at the table who do not like their bread 'soppy' everyone enjoyed the soup.  Other recipes asked for sugar to be added to the onions, which I did out of curiosity.  I will not add the sugar in the future.  After carmelizing the onions, there is plenty of sugar.  The only other thing I did differently is to use my own beef stock from a Crock-potted roast.  I believe homemade stock is always better than consomme or boullion cubes.  Thank you Lori for a great recipe!

A very good base for onion soup. I add 1 or 2 cloves of chopped garlic, and cook the onions on low heat for about an hour to slowly carmelize them. I add more sherry (about 1/4 cup) and find that any red wine will do in a pinch. I also toast the bread first, and use any cheese on hand such as parmesan, swiss, gruyerre, provolone, even meunster. You just want to have a combo of an ooey gooey cheese and a pungent flavored cheese like romano or parmesan. Topping with parsley at the end makes for a lovely presentation.

This one is a little tricky.  I read all the reviews prior to making it.  I followed all directions in recipe and took some advise from other reviewers.  I found that the only things I changed were cooking the onions a little longer and adding some flour at the end of the onion cooking process to absorb some of the butter and it turned out GREAT.  The second time I made it I cut the butter and oil amts in half and it DID NOT taste the same - so I don't recommend that.  Do as the recipe says, but brown the onions and add the flour, It needs the butter for the GOOD flavor!

This is a classic French Onion Soup recipe that I have used for years. The only change, being said by other also, is to carmelize the onions.  Saute the onion on a very low heat for 45 minutes to an hour.  Do not burn the onions.  It adds so much more depth to the soup.

4 stars as is...to make it 5 I made basically the same minor changes as many of the previous posters: 1) You DO want to brown/carmelize the onions for better flavor. (I used the onions I had on hand: Vidalias) 2) since I was using bullion broth I omitted the salt....bullion is salty enough on it's own and I hate overly salted onion soup. I only use Knorr brand bullion.....using the best broth/bullion is really important. For the pepper "to taste" I used 1/4 tsp. 3) I doubled the Sherry...I DO like to taste the wine in the soup for added body/flavor.  As one poster noted....some folks have changed it so much it is no longer close to the same recipe!!!

I did everything I could possibly do to botch this soup and it still turned out delicious! I didn't have an Thyme so instead of regular butter I used Kerrygold herb and garlic flavored butter. Couldn't remember how much of a stick was a half cup so I just tossed in what was left...about 7/8ths of a stick. Went to add the olive oil and couldn't find my tablespoon so I just estimated. I used 2 medium yellow onions which left me just shy of the 4 cups so I tossed in two diced garlic cloves and some green onions to make up the difference. Sautéed for about 20 minutes but did not carmelize the onion mixture. Then comes the kicker...I looked for my beef bullion and I couldn't find it so I had to use low sodium CHICKEN  broth with some chicken base because I am out of salt too! I also has no sherry so I used a splash of raspberry white vinegar!! Simmered it for the half hour and then because I didn't have any ramekins I just tossed the soup in a big mug with a chunk of stale French bread put 3 slices of provolone on top and microwaved it. Despite all of that it was still delicious and tasted reasonably like French onion soup is supposed to. Even with the chicken broth instead of beef! I can only imagine how yummy it would be if I made it with the right ingredients!! Thanks for the recipe, I will make it properly soon and if I remember I will submit a new review!

This is a great recipe, and our family are FOS addicts!  A few sugggestions:  Letting the onions carmelize is a must - and try adding some minced garlic in with the onions - it's a great layer of flavor in this soup.  I would substitute a couple of bay leaves for the thyme (too strong of a flavor for me, bay is much more subtle).  And the bread definitely needs to be either toasted, or stale, so it doesn't disintegrate completely in the soup.  I've also found that buttering the outside of the bowls (and the lip) makes the cheese come right off - and you WANT to get every gooey bit!  It also makes cleanup a snap... it can be such a pain to get that baked cheese off the soup bowl!  5 stars for this one!

This recipe is awesome! I've been making it for about a year now and have discovered that you can make it using about 1/4 of the butter and a touch of EVOO and it tastes just as good without all the fat.

Made Garlic Croutons from this site, and they went PERFECTLY with this recipe.  I followed other reviews and carmelized my onion; 8 Tablespoons of Butter and 2 Tablespoons and probably 6 cups of onions, cooked over medium heat for over an hour.  Next time I am doubling the recipe because I wanted leftovers and there weren't any!

I made some changes: added worchesterchire, chopped fresh parsley, a good deal of riesling wine, but no sherry, and I used only parmesan cheese. Don't hover over the stove "continually stirring" the onions...certainly keep an eye on them, but part of the beauty of this thoroughly scrumptious recipe is that it's a throw-together no-brainer!

I made this with half the butter and, like others have pointed out, caramelizing the onions is a step you must not skip.  

Add about 1/2 tsp salt to the onions and saute for about ten minutes on medium heat, stirring occasionally. Then turn head down to low, cover and let simmer for 30 minutes or so until the onions are soft and caramel colored. 

Toasting the bread before putting it in the soup means it is less soggy. If you can find it, I'd recommend Gruyere cheese over Swiss and Provolone.

This was great! Definitely did NOT need 1/2 cup butter or the olive oil. I used 6 T butter and it was still too much, probably would be okay with just 1/4 cup. I toasted my bread before broiling as others suggested, which helped a little with the sogginess.

Lives up to its name - Rich and Simple! We usually double the recipe when we make this but found that you have to use 6 or 7 cans of beef broth instead of 8 (and make up the rest of the liquid with just water) if you don't want it too salty. You don't have to double the thyme as well as it would be overpowering. Also, we broil the bread with cheese separately so that the bread doesn't get too soggy.

Followed this recipe mostly, instead of 2T sherry, I subbed 2T dry white vermouth, used thinly cubed guyeyre cheese topped with grated ramono cheese, turned out great! This my first attempt.  Will definately make again.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  Thanks Lori!  I like to add a bit more sherry and some crushed garlic cloves (add while simmering, remove before serving).  Also, the first time I made it, it was a little bland, so really go for it with the salt & pepper!

I would rate this higher if I could. My husband thought this was better than anything he's ever had in a restaurant! I carmalized the onions- I used 3 large yellow onions. I added about 2 tsp chopped garlic near the end of carmalizing the onions. I then added 1/2 cup of red wine and 3 cans of beef broth. I used quite a bit more thyme than the recipe called for and the key, I think, was the addition of red wine vinegar- I would estimate that I added about 1.5 tablespoons. This really gave it a punch of flavor. I don't have any oven proof soup crocks so I first smeared the sliced of french bread with a thin layer of butter then toasted in a skillet on the stove top. I topped them on the bowls of soup then added the cheese and microwaved until the cheese melted- about 40 seconds. Perfect!

This was a 5 star recipe, but I made a few changes that made it a 10 star, no kidding! I used white cooking wine instead of the Sherry, and added 3 Tbles Brandy after I turned the fire off, toasted the french bread, and used Gruyere cheese, with shaved fresh Parmesan on top of that. Spendiferious!

AWESOME!AWESOME!AWESOME!AWESOME!AWESOME!AWESOME!
My Brazilian hubby wouldn't even LOOK at soup, let alone taste it when we were first married.  We went to a pizzeria where this soup was being served.  My hubby tasted my soup and asked if I could make it.  I found this wonderful recipe!  I served this at many family functions and I didn't make enough for everyone.  It was a hit!

Yummy! This soup is extremely rich and tastes exactly like the FOS I've had at high-end restaurants...actually, it tastes BETTER! The FOS I've had at those pricey restaurants is so dang salty! I changed mine up quite a bit. I'm the type of cook who doesn't really measure anything, unless I'm baking. I used 5 huge white onions, which btw, took 3 flippin' hours to carmelize!!! Maybe it was my choice of onion? Next time I'll use yellow onions. It was so worth it though :) Didn't have sherry, so I used red wine...I don't know how much, maybe 1/4 cup, with which I deglazed the pan. For the cheese I used fontina and fresh mozzarella and left out the parmesan. I cut my french bread about an inch thick then cubed it and toasted it til it was golden brown. French bread is light and airy inside, even though I toasted it, it seemed quite soggy.  I think next time I'm going to use a baguette like I normally do.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this - I agree that browning/caramelizing the onions would have given it more flavor. I also think the amount of butter could be cut in half. I'll definitely make it again with those modifications.

Three words....TOO MUCH THYME!  I had a feeling it was a lot, but followed the recipe anyway.  I wish I had read the poorer ratings first.  A pinch would have been plenty and then the soup probably would have been fine.

I agree, you've got to carmelize the onions first.  I also cut back on the amount of butter.  Great flavor after these changes.

What an easy, yet fantastic recipe.  I did add a couple tablespoons of worcestershire.  Next time I might add a bit of garlic.

Great basic recipe, good job. The only two things I did different was the add red wine instead of sherry and used a hand held blender to mix the onions. It is a little easier to eat when you mix the onions makes it thicker.

Very good. Brown your bread, caramelize the onions, half butter, watch your salt, a little extra red wine doesn't hurt.

LOVED IT!! After reading other reviews I opted for carmelized onions (4 large)....to prevent less tearing, put them in the fridge the day before, used red wine (almost used an ale beer instead, will try that next time)...added 1/2 c red wine when onions were a their prime, cooked off the wine and sprinkled with a little flour. added 12 cups water with 12 beef bullion cubes and 2 paks swanson beef boosters. I let it come to a boil and let it simmer for 20 min. I added another 1/4 cup red wine and let it simmer for another 20 min. It was pretty amazing! Definately going to make this again!

Absolutely delicious!! This is very easy to make and I strongly recommend this. I made small changes to the recipes by using just 1 type cheese instead of the recommended 3 types. It is the best French Onion soup I have tasted.

Please do carmalize your onions (adds so much flavour).. take your time... makes all the difference.. a splash of dry cooking sherry also makes the 'french' part so tasty!

FANTASTIC!!! And SOOO simple!! I did brown the onions like other reviewers suggested but I didn't add the sherry, thyme, or parmesan (didn't have it) and it was still better than I have had in restaurants.  OUTSTANDING!  I have found my new escape... I will be making this again and again and again : )

This is absolutely delicious!  I made it vegetarian with a beef flavored veggie broth.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  I would say the sherry is an important part of the finished flavor.  I'm glad I went to the trouble to get some to put in.

I modified the recipe a little. I did cook the onions until browned (around 30 min). When I added the broth and all of the seasonings listed I also added a basil leaf. I buttered the sliced bread and stuck it in the broiler for about 5 minutes before adding it to the soup. The soup came out great-it's all gone! will definitely make again and again

Kevins favorite!  Ack! "Do not brown the onions"??? That's the best part of French Onion soup, the rich, caramelized onions! The ingredients for this soup are great, but I did cook my onions until they were a sweet and dark brown (not burnt) before adding the stock and other ingredients. Try it, you will be amazed at the richness it adds. I also like to toast the French bread a bit before it goes onto the soup, the bread is less slimy soggy if it is toasted.

Saute chopped onions till golden brown (carmalized) then add tsp. or so of chopped garlic.  Add beef broth and simmer for 6 to 8 hrs. Add a little salt and very little Worcestershire Sauce.   Add Bristol Irish Cream (again not to much) and Beer.   Put in bowl, top with toasted bread.  Add cheese on top and broil till cheese is melted and is slight golden brown around edges.  Add these ingredients and it will be a 5 star. If serving to children leave the alcohol off.

Ok - I have never had french onion soup before so I don't have anything to compare it to.  However, since this is my first time in both making and eating it - what a great recipe to christen the occassion!!  It was awesome!!!  I have been converted!  My boyfriend - a french onion soup expert - agreed that this was pretty darn good.  We toasted the bread in the toaster first before adding it to the soup and cheese so it wouldn't get as soggy.  Thank you Lori for opening my eyes! Will make many times from now!!

Turned out o'k. My boyfriend loves the onion soup at Panera and he says Panera is still the best. :( For myself I enjoyed the soup very much, but I love onions any way you cut them! Update 12/2014: Made this again and it turned out much better. I used Better than Bouillion for the broth, and I browned the dickens out of the sweet onions. Had some smoked Gouda to add to the topping as well, yum!

This was very good.  I would have liked a little thicker (just slightly) soup and I definitely took the advice of others and carmelized the onions.  I used a little gruyere cheese and then decided to put a slice of provolone on top.  The melted provolone was a little rubbery so maybe I'll try some mozarella next time.

Perfection. Pure and simple. I made a few changes, out of both preference and necessity. I threw out the sentence "Do not brown the onions." because I think that's the best part. I used a beef and onion flavored beef broth, and a splash of dry cabernet sauvignon in place of the sherry, and instead of the provolone, swiss, and parmesean, I used shredded gruyere. The result was, hands down, the best French onion soup I've ever tasted. Thanks for this great recipe!

I cooked the onions as suggested but instead of simmering them I through the ingredients in the crockpot for a few hours.  When I got home I just served up the bowls broiled the cheese and it was ready in a snap.   I'd have to say it was the easiest meal I have ever prepared.

I made this recipe last night when I got home from work.  It was easy to make and everyone loved it.  The only thing I did different was I broiled some Texas Toast (garlic flavor) and used that instead of French Bread.  The garlic flavor in the soup was excellent. This will be a make again recipe.

I've tried this two ways:  with the suggested beef broth, and with more traditional beef stock (keeping in mind that stock is made with actual bone marrow, as in from-scratch recipes).  Stock lends that extra measure of savoriness, no doubt about it!  I'm sure others have also gone this route, and they're not really messing with a good thing...they're following tradition!  Enjoy either way---this is a can't miss!  (By the way, those of us who've been sampling the nation's French onion soups will enjoy and appreciate this one all the more, leading us to wonder what some restaurants are thinking!)

This recipe is SO freaking good.  There are a couple of things people should know, though.  1.  The sherry is essential for the soup.  Do not leave it out.  2.  Caramelize the onions for the richest, best flavor.  You'll thank me for this.  3. A nice trick is to toast the bread, then cut a garlic clove in half and rub the cut side over the toasted bread before putting the toast in the soup and layering on the cheese.  It's a subtle change but it really excellent.  4. Cut down on the butter or else you'll have a ton of grease floating on top after the cheese is melted.

I thought this was really yummy but my husband has never had French Onion Soup before and  "the bread wierded him out" so I won't be making it again. If you like french onion soup..it is definitely worth making.

I prepared it as directed and I thought that the broth was a little flat.  I added 1/3 cup of red wine, 1T worcestershire sauce, and 1T balsamic vinegar as directed in another recipe.  I really liked it with these additions.

This is a great recipe and best I've made..including ,my standard for years from Julia Child !!My mother-in-law is from the French Countryside ( 80 plus in years now !) and she combines 1/2 chicken stock and half beef stock as that is how they made it when she was growing up, so that is what I did here also. Instead of Sherry, I used a good drinking red wine . I do usually use the combo of provolone and swiss , but was out of both, so just used mozzarella as is what I had..Also, I toasted  some bread ( I usually use French bread , but , only had hamburger buns,so, yes, that is what I used !) under hi heat broiler, then took out and rubbed with olive oil and some fresh cut garlic..put in soup bowl and covered w the Mozzarella ..then bake under broiler for a few minutes until cheese is brown and soup bubbling. Delicious !!

What a fantastic recipe!  I used 2.5 sweet onions because that's what was on hand.  I did caramelize the onions and deglazed the pan with about 1/4 cup red wine.  I used a half teaspoon of thyme after reading the other reviews.  Everyone in my family including the 7 and 4 year old kiddos really enjoyed this soup, this is a keeper!

This soup was so tasty.  I followed the advice of others and put in only 1/4 c. butter.  I used Red wine vinegar in place of the sherry and added 1 T. worchestershire sauce.  I also put Gruyere cheese on top in place of the provolone and swiss and I used freshly grated parmesan.  Yummy!  My 3 and 4 year old even cleaned their bowls.

Great recipe. Very simple (that's may favorite part), however, I modified it a little. I used just mozzarella and swiss cheese and I add a few drops of worcestershire sauce. Then I top it off with some french's fried onions. Delish!

Good, but I think the onions need to be caramelized as other reviewers have suggested.  Next time I will try Gruyere in lieu of the other cheeses.  Also, we had some soup left over which I refrigerated and was later disgusted to see an unimaginably THICK layer of solidified butter sitting atop the soup.  Next time I will use way less.

Fabulous recipe.  I did as others suggested and sauteed the onions.  I did not use butter, only olive oil and I also reduced the thyme to 1/2 tsp (personal preference).  Will definitely make again!

This is a very easy and delicious recipe! I recommend caramelizing the onions and using fresh beef broth if you have it. I added about 1/2 C of white wine in place of sherry. I also toasted the french bread in an iron skillet and topped it with provolone & baby swiss before broiling the soup, bread, and cheese in the oven.

I put about 3 small onions into the bottom of a crockpot with butter, on high for aprox 45 min.  Then I added 2cans of beef broth.  I didn't have 4 cans so I added an envelope of lipton onion soup and added 2 cans of water.  Cooked on high for aprox 4 hrs.  Continued to step 4 used Gruyère cheese instead of the other suggestions

Wow... DELICIOUS! Probably not the best recipe for FOS on this site but definitely way better than any store bought one.  I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great.  I had a ton left over, so the following day I re-simmered it and added about two tbsp of red whine, about a tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and this was equally as delicious!  ***Also, I took a tip from another FOS recipe.  Add one teaspoon of salt when you are cooking the onions in butter.  It helps them carmalize!!

OH. MY. GOODNESS!  I absolutely adore this recipe! It's easy and so delicious!  The best I've ever had. I didn't have sherry so I used a little burgundy. It's great without cheese on it even.  I'll be making this often.  Thank you ,Lori.  Yum!

Very rich and simple, just like its name! I left out the bread since I'm doing low carbs and it was fabulous! Didn't need to broil it either-definitely restaurant quality.

Fabulous French onion soup. I substituted some port wine in place of the sherry and it was a delightful change. Though, I must agree with another user - DO brown the onions! The caramelized flavour is a must. Also, if you start with a roux before adding the liquid, it makes a great thick pasta sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

very simple and very delicious!! I know it's redundant but yes, you really must carmelize the onions but other than that no other changes are needed

One of the things I like to rate at every restaurant I go to is the French Onion soups. This is way up there with some of the best I've ever had. I didnt have sherry so I used white wine, and I didnt have thyme so I used oregano. Had a blast melting the cheese on top!!! Thanks so much for a perfect French Onion Soup Recipe!!!

This is the first French Onion Soup I have ever tried to make and the first time it came out amazingly good! Even my daughter who does no like onions liked this! I browned the onions as others did and I am still playing with the amount of oil & butter. I like the taste but it is a bit too oily for my tastes. I tried it with roasted garlic loaves from Costco and Oh my goodness is it good! Yummers! Thanks so much! Even this busy mom can make a yummy and somewhat fancy (looking) meal!

This is a great base for French Onion Soup! Like others, I recommend you carmelize your onions for a richer extra  flavor. I also substituted a good dry red wine for the sherry and would recommend that as well. Finally, my family loves onions and so we added an 2 cups of onions since this soup was very thin without them. Overall, a great soup and well worth trying and adding your own touches to!

This was so easy and delicious! I will cover the pot when simmering next time and will add the sherry (did not have any on hand at the time). Will also toast the bread before adding to the bowl:) My hubby LOVES French Onion soup so he's pretty happy too!!

This was very good. A few changes: You def. need to brown the onions for optimal flavour. I added no liquor but imagine it would be tasty either way. The broth itself needed a bit of ooomph so I added some salt, garlic seasoning and a dash of worch. The trick to gooey FOS? Add one slice of cheese to the bottom prior to pouring in your soup. This was good but I'm still on the seach for the BEST FOS.

This might be a jumping off point but I wouldn't call it a complete recipe. I found it was very bland and lacked depth.  I thought the thyme was an odd addition to the overall flavor. I will keep looking for the right soup recipe for me. Hope you have better luck.

Disclaimer:  I'm probably biased, since I tried this in an attempt to replicate my mother's never-written down recipe.  I had never used thyme before, but I'd say you could cut it down by half.  Do NOT rush the onions when sauteing, and make your slices as uniform as possible.  Removing the hearts is also wise.  I imagine that caramelizing the onions could make for interesting flavor, but I enjoy the texture of non-browned ones and have always made it that way.  Toast the bread, you'll be so glad you did.  I often use regular good sliced wheat bread, crusts cut off.  I like white pepper and my mom has dashed Worcestershire at times.  I've skipped the sherry, but it really is worth getting.

This recipe is very tasty!!! I deleted the butter and the sherry totally and added  about 1 1/2 tsp. granulated garlic and I did carmelize the onions. I didn't have beef broth so I put 42 ounces of water to 5 beef bouillion cubes in a pot and boiled it so the bouillion would combine with the water.  Then I added the camelized onions to the broth and brought back to a boil and served. Very Good will use often Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!!  I made this at my mother in-laws request while they were here visiting us last week and she said it was the best she had ever had!  I tweaked it oh so slighlty (because that is just how I cook). Make sure you carmelize your onions... so important!!  I used a cream sherry which made it a little more smooth, FRESH thyme and 2 garlic cloves, worchestire sauce, mushrooms and used a blend of cheeses.  In place of french bread I used an asiago cheese baquette which was fabulous!!  Thank you so much for a wonderful onion soup recipe!!  Unfortunatley my hubby doesn't like it so this will be something I will have to make for me when he isn't around.

I use a mixture of onions each time I make this.  This last time I used one large sweet onion, two small purple onions, and 1 small yellow onion.  I also recommend caramelizing the onions in SALTED butter and  olive oil.  Also adding a sprinkle of salt to the onions will help them  caramelize them better.  I have used both sherry and red wine in this soup and find the red wine gives a richer, better flavor.  We leave out the parmesan cheese and opt for only the provolone and this is a keeper.  This is my kids favorite soup!  They ask for it, they beg for it, they love it.  They are 4 and 9 and this is one meal everyone can agree on!

Onions took an hour to caramelize. PERFECT. I toasted the bread beforehand, brushed the slices with olive oil, sprinkled with reggiano parm...then baked...When I was ready to serve...plopped the bread in, topped with swiss...heaven.

This was excellent!  I didn't use sherry, but I did add a little white wine.  Next time I will try to remember to spray the rim of the bowl with non-stick spray for easier cleaning after dinner.

This is a really solid French Onion soup.  I was out of sherry and it is still excellent.  The best part is it couldn't be more simple!  Definitely carmelize the onions.  I had provolone on hand and it turned out really well.  Delish!

The ingredients in the recipe are great.  The cooking process is lacking. You MUST, MUST caramelize the onions....low to med low heat for 25-30 minutes...until golden brown...don't forget to stir every 5 mins or so...You want those onions browned!

This soup was AMAZING!  I made a few changes: 1/2 stick butter, 1 can Beef consomme, 2 large yellow onions, 6oz Cabernet Sauvignon, no salt/pepper.  Then added a slice bread & 1/2 slice provolone on bottom of bowl before adding soup, then whole slice provolone & slice of Muenster & grated parm on top, which made the soup very hearty.

I made this for dinner yesterday and found it had way to much butter. I used expensive Vidalia onions and think that they were to soft to hold up to a longer simmer time that some responders mentioned. The family said it was just okay. Next time I'll remember to cut the butter to a quarter cup.

This is quite good. One thing as some others pointed out...it's IMPERATIVE that you caramelize the onions! That is what will make all the difference between an ok soup, to a great soup.  This takes time - don't rush it.  It will take about 20-30 minutes to properly caramelize onions.
Perfect!

This soup was absolutely delish!  I put some garlic and bay leaf in to kick up the spice a little.  I think next time I will cut down on the oil just a little bit.  I'd been wanting to try a french onion recipe at home for the longest time, and this was so simple and tastes great.  I definately cooked the onions for an hour, until they were nice and sweet - it's not french onion soup unless the onions are cooked well! I served this to our guests even though it was my first try and they loved it.  My husband who normally doesn't like french onion soup even enjoyed it.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was a great recipie and SO easy!  I made it without the sherry and served it to to my boyfriend and friends and they all loved it.

I have made it twice in the past two weeks and we love it.  I even used cheap Campell's beef broth and less butter/oil... still great!  It's delish and simple!  The thyme is the best ingredient!  

I will absolutely make this again and again!

Wow...I was really unimpressed and so disappointed by all the wonderful reviews it received.  I even went out the same day I cooked this to get the oven proof bowls!  I think it was the thyme...1 tsp was too much.  Thanks anyway!

This was soo easy to make and turned out to be to BEST FO soup I've ever had.  I recommend browning the onions for added taste.  I also used 1/2 red cooking wine instead of the sherry.  Instead of the bread slices, I used restaurant style croutons.  This makes eating it a little less messy!  Very rich and delicious!

AS GOOD AS if not BETTER than FRANCE.

So I've been to Paris last year and then i went this year with  my bf and we both love their french onion soup.  Now everytime we go out, he orders it but only to be extremely disappointed.  Why do they taste so weird here and nothing like the ones in france??  Even at this one expensive french restaurant, it didn't come close.  I am being completely honest, and this one tastes just as good as the ones i've had in france.. (my bf actually thinks its better)and wayyyy better than any american version.

To get it to taste like real French Onion Soup I made these minor adjustments:

I cut the butter amount in 1/2, and i added 2 cubes of beef buillion to the broth.

DELICIOUS.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was really great.  I made it as part of a Father's Day dinner for my husband because he LOVES French Onion Soup.  I actually made it the night before and resimmered the soup before adding the fixings.  I think the flavors really were enhanced by doing that and it was a time saver the day of the dinner.  I would recommend getting the bread nice and toasted before putting in soup.

Wow~this is really delicious! Make sure to use unsalted butter as this is still plenty salty. Use a good quality beef broth and you can't go wrong with this recipe! MMmmm, my mouth is watering writing this! Thank you.

Outstanding, hearty.  Herbs de provence can be substituted for the thyme.  Also, a veggie broth substitutes equally well for this otherwise vegan soup!

Awsome - Thanks!  I use red, yellow and white onions and I can't cook with out a clove of garlinc, or two.  I toasted the bread a little bit before I put it on top, I think it may absorb a little less soup.  Will do it again.

Definitely better than restaurant.  Easy  delicious.  I agree that the sherry (or red wine) is a must!  You can easily change the type of onions andor cheese to suit your taste.

I recently discovered that I LOVE french onion soup and order it whenever we eat out.  I just had to find a recipe to see if I could make it at home.  This recipe is wonderful.  I took the suggestion of a few posters here and added a few generous splashes of worcestershire.  I agree, you must use the sherry.  I topped it with swiss and provolone and it was DELICIOUS!!  As good as any restaurant and better than some!

This recipe lives up to its name and beyond.  Really rich in flavor, and deceivingly simple. I made it twice in one week.   I used Maui onions, kin to Vidalias, but found in Hawaii.  Awesome!  I used provolone and parmesan simply because that's what I had to work with.  They blended really nicely.

Yum!  This soup was excellent-I added a little Worcestershire sauce and instead of using French bread I threw in cheese and garlic croutons in the crocks before I put on the sliced cheeses-I tried it with Swiss and Provolone.  Very good, my husband and sons all love this when we go out and they gobbled it down here!  Easy to prepare and very satisfying results.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Wonderful, Wonderful! I ate this and then used it again to make the Salisbury Steak recipe here on the site. Just an awesome soup! I added just a hint of garlic to it too. Never knew onion soup could be so easy! Can't wait for Viadalia season here again, can you imagine this made with those onions? Just heaven. Thanks for sharing!

My husband really loved this soup.  Because I always have tons of leftover onions in the bottom of my soup when I go out, I only used 3 cups of onions and it was just right.  i couldn't get my picky 3 year old to even try it, but my 18 month old barely left any in my bowl for me!

Wonderfully simple and delicious soup.  I did tweak it a bit or else it would have gotten 5 stars. Reduced the thyme amount, added some garlic powder and a splash or Worcestershire sauce.

My family LOVED this soup. My mom doesn't even like French onion soup, an she had two bowls. I didn't have sherry but I added a splash of red wine and it was wonderful! I will be making this over and over, especially on cold days! It was so easy!

Excellent,  I made this as a part of a menu as the starter and it worked out very well, except the  cheese.  I am not exactly sure what went wrong onther than perhaps I didn't leave it in the oven long enough.  Other wise it was delicious.

Excellent!  I used sweet onions fresh from our garden and a really good beef boullion for the broth.  I split french rolls on top of each bowl and generously topped with cheese and then broiled to melt and brown.  My husband and I really liked it, but the kids weren't impressed since onion soup (even at its best, which this is) isn't pretty to look at.

Outstanding.  My husbands only complaint was that he wanted more cheese and bread to finish the soup.  The flavor was delicious and very quick to make.

This recipe was GREAT!  I can't believe how easy this soup is to make.  I love to go out to eat just to get this soup, now I will make it at home.  The only thing I did different is I added white wine instead of Sherry because that's what I had at home...Tasted Great!!

This was a very good recipe... following the same basic principles of the Julia Childs recipe. You must, MUST brown the onions to get a true, deep flavor, IMO. I did not have thyme, but think the recipe works without it. It was a very nice change for dinner.

just finished making the soup and it's delicious.  A great recipe. I did tweak it a little. I didn't have Sherry wine, so I used a little balsamic vinegar and a little Port wine. My husband said it tastes similar to Panera Bread's French Onion Soup... my 7 and 4 year old loved it too- so definitely a keeper recipe!

This recipe is wonderful! I used Red wine because I didn't have any Sherry (I agree with others, this is definitly not optional, it made the meal!) and I used fresh Thyme instead of dried.  Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. The broth was wonderful, flavourful and not as salty as the ones I've had before.  This goes into our favorites for sure.

Excellent and easy to prepare.  I varied it slightly by using a 5 cheese grated Italian Mix on top of the provolone slice, instead of the other cheeses and it was delicious.  Also, I substituted half margerine in place of half the butter.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe "almost" as stated.  I cooked the onions over med heat for about 1/2 hour until they were brown and caramelized.  I also added 2 tsp. of worcestershire sauce and an extra beef bullion cube to deepen the flavor.  YUM!

Good, easy recipe.  Way too much butter/oil, though.  I halved the butter and there was still enough to cook the onions and create a rich broth.

Everyone LOVED this soup.  Like being in a restaurant and very easy to make.  I want to buy some soup crocks now so the cheese melts over the edges.  Loved this soup.  I did toast the bread before I put it in the soup.

I doubled the recipe and added in garlic and wostershire (sp) as some suggested. Next time I'll try it with half the butter. I see where some people say to carmelize the onions - not sure how to do that with so much butter. I cooked the onions down and then added my broth & stuff and probably cooked it a good hour after that until the onions were very very mushy. The longer they cook the better the flavor. For a first timer the soup was perfect. Everyone ate it (hub & boys - 18 & 13) and hub went back for seconds :) I also put the bread, sliced, in a warm oven for a couple of hours to crisp it as someone had suggested. I never realized french onion soup was so easy!!

This was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly except I don't cook with alcohol, so I used orange juice as a substitute. Just as good if not better than any restaurant style soup, and I'm picky about this kind since it's one of my favorites!

Very nice flavor.  I didn't have enough beef broth, so I used 2 cups of water with beef bullion....I used fresh cracked pepper.  I didn't have sherry so I used a bit of dry red wine.. Even my 5 year old ate it.

I have made this several times to the enjoyment of my whole family.  I guess I need to make more because they always want more.  Even my 12 year old loves it!  I did toast the bread as several other people suggested but otherwise kept the recipe unchanged.

My first stab at making french onion soup was NOT a disappointment with this great recipe.  I agree with other reviewers to carmelize onions and not burn (who would want the burnt taste in their soup).  Also I found that bread under the broiler for a few minutes and then added to soup was better - otherwise, I found the bread became too soggy and fell apart giving the broth a mushier texture.

Half butter and oil. Use 2 large onions. Used marsala instead of sherry. Toasted bread. Used Italian blend cheese. Try 1 cup wine and 1/4 cognac or brandy. Cook onions 10 minutes, add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and salt, cook until brown. Sprinkle 1 T flour and simmer 1 1/2 hours.

This soup was wonderful and oh so easy to make.  I had 3 of my sisters over for a pre-Mother's Day lunch and served this.  They all wanted the recipe.  I made as is except used organic beef broth and added some French's fried onions to the broth.  I tore the bread and cheese to fit nicely in the bowl then ladled a small amount of broth over top before broiling.  There is a local bake & broil who according to one of my sisters makes the best French Onion Soup.  She said she will not order from there again after tasting this one.

This is a wonderful soup!  My daughter said it was the best she's ever tasted, even better than her favorite restaurant! I added red merlot , as I had no sherry, and it really enriches the flavor.  I also lightly browned the onions, and added a sprinkle of garlic salt to the broth.

This was very good.  I followed the advice of others and carmelized the onions.  I didn't have beef broth - substituted beef stock and 1 packet of beef boulion.  I also used chipolte chili pepper instead of black pepper to add a little smokey flavor.  Topped with a combination of shredded mozerella  & slices of swiss cheese.... very yummy and smelled heavenly.  My only (very minor) complaint is that I would have liked to see the broth get a little darker.  I cooked it quite a while to try to obtain the darker color.  Maybe next time I will try to add some red wine instead of sherry.  Other than that the recipe was perfect

I had been craving frnch onion soup for a long time and I found this recipe. Its delicious! But I agree with the other users. Carmelizing the onions would be better and use less thyme because it was just a little too over powering. And instead of french bread I used my own English Muffin bread I made in my bread machine. I just put it in the toaster oven and browned it up real nice before putting on the soup. Yumm!!

Definitely cook the onions until brown, took about 25 minutes (but I also tripled the recipe). Substituted a dry red wine for sherry. Added way more thyme. Next time I'll use way more onion too. Best french onion soup I ever had!

Extremely good recipe! Very simple and tasty. Like others, I'm used to browning my onions for my soup, so I went ahead and did that. I didn't have any sherry on hand nor red wine, but I did have vermouth, so what the hell, I used that. Certainly did the ticket. Thanks for a fantastic recipe I'll be sure to use again! And I can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow.

I have never made French Onion Soup before and found this very easy. I'm not sure if my thyme was old, but I didn't like the way it tasted. Other than that, I thought the soup was excellent

This was awesome!!!!  I very tasty Onion Soup.  I definitely think carmelizing the onions is the way to go and Red Wine to enrich the broth.  I would cut down on the butter a little to hasten the carmelizing of the onions. I also thought that the better quality broth you used the better the soup so do not skimp on the broth.  Overall, this is easy and relatively quick soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent beginner French onion soup recipe. It is extremely simple yet wholesome and delicious. I think the sherry is a necessity. Dried thyme may be substituted for fresh thyme or even a bouquet garni.    I have noticed several people posting negative reviews based on their personal cheese selection. It seems obvious to me you can choose your own cheese without changing the essence of this dish. Saying things like "zomg swiss cheeze sux" does not reflect well upon you as a cook.   To reviewer Tiffjergy and several others: You consider yourself an expert cook, but this was "too much work and took a long time?" In my professional opinion this is a very quick yet effective recipe.   Also, browning the onions is acceptable yet loses the delicacy of properly sweating the onion. A rapid carmelization establishes sugary notes in the soup which may quickly appeal to the palate. However, spend a bit of extra time on this dish and the onions will literally melt in your mouth.   Consider a proper onion soup bowl to truly reveal the amazing characteristics of this soup.

This was as authentic tasting as any French Onion Soup we have ordered in French Restaurants.  Very good.  Only thing we would do differently is add fewer onions...just a bit too much onion for our taste.  This is a keeper and especially good on a cold, rainy/snowy day!

I followed recipe closely except for one step... I cooked the onions on very low flame for about 45 minutes added the broth, sherry, thyme and simmered for 30 minutes uncovered. I will cover the pot next time.  I toasted the bread and added the cheeses I popped it in the microwave to melt the top. (I was getting tired and did not feel like torching it in the broiler and with the rest of the sherry in belly I may have) I did not care for the cheese toast but that is mostly all my BF ate. He though that it needed more broth and that the thyme was overboard. If you like onion soup by itself this is a great recipe. If you have only cooked with the powered stuff you might not be so keen on this soup.  The soup was super simple and I likes it very much. It just did not go over well in my household. I would make it for myself & my foody friends if so inclined but for the guys at my home I will use a soup mix and save myself the trouble.

Great French Onion Soup.  I made it with "Basic Beef Stock" from this site.  To make onion soup portable and for large groups I put the bread slices on a baking sheet, top with cheese, and broil.  Then each person can get their own bowl of soup and top it with the bread and cheese.

This was absolutely amazing. And so so simple. I left out the sherry since I didn't have any ( but will make again with it) and use Gryuere cheese with parmesan. DELICIOUS!

This is a very good soup, and easy to make. I made some changes though, as suggested by others. I cut the butter in half, omitted the oil, caramelized the onions (4 onions took about 1 hr), used beef stock (instead of broth), used 1/4 cup of sherry, and added a Tbls of worcestershire. Finally, topped it off with toasted, french baguette slices and only  Gruyere cheese. This will become a regular in our home!

I made this for my parents, aunt, and husband (who isn't a huge fan of french onion soup), and they all loved it, in fact my husband has asked me to make it again.  I followed the ingredients, but not the measurements... and it turned out awesome!!  I did cook the onions for a long time like someone else suggested, so they were a beautiful brown.  I can't wait to make it again.

Delicious flavor, but WAY too heavy on the butter/oil for my taste. Could cut butter in HALF and use little to no oil and I'd be happy. I also broiled the bread a little before I put it in the soup and thought that was a nice crunchy addition. Also omitted the sherry and still had excellent flavor. Will definitely make again! Enjoy!

Lori's recipe is awesome!  I've been making this for over 5 years now and just now got around to posting a review (sorry Lori!)  Everyone raves about this soup.  I think you can tweak it any way you like and I sometimes do but it's an excellent recipe.  One of our family favorites!  The thyme makes this wonderful!

I thought this soup was superb. I eliminated all the butter except a tablespoon I used to brown the onions. (Yes, I did carmelize!) I also did not use sherry since it was listed as optional and I did not have any in the pantry. In the future, I think I will stick with one cheese. Provolone and Gruyere seem to melt the way French Onion Soup cheese should melt and the Swiss and Parmesan cheese didn't seem to make much of an impact on the overall flavor of the soup. I have been seeking a great French Onion Soup recipe for years and I am happy to have finally found a recipe I can proudly add to my recipe box.

I have wanted to make French Onion Soup for a while, but haven't found a recipe that sounds like what I was looking for until this one.  I finally made French Onion Soup using this recipe and we loved it! Thank you for sharing.  Watch the broiling time...it only took 5 minutes in our oven until it started to burn.

One of our favorite restaurants serves THE BEST onion soup and so I have been searching for a comparable recipe for ages - and this is it!!  Very easy to make and very tasty.  I used white and red onions, and leeks and it was very good.  My husband loved it - no more $7.00 a bowl for a great onion soup!

This was so good. It is very close to restaurant style soup. I followed exactly and wouldn't change a thing. The family loved it! I still cant figure out why people make a recipe for the first time and change everything about the recipe then rate it!! Makes no sense. Great recipe Thanks!

I like to top with a large seedless rye crouton, shredded manchego and swiss.  Try rendering a 1/4 of a strip of streaky then add the butter and oil for a slightly fuller finish.

De-Lish!  We had this last night as our first course for Bastille Day and it was so wonderful. I served it out light on the onions for my husband who is not overly fond of onions and he finished it right up! We used panini slices as the bread and I forgot to shred some parmesan on top but it was still such a wonderful dish. Would definitely make this again!

This was very easy and I loved the thyme used in it. I only used 1/4cup butter and I browned my onions as well. I used red wine as one suggested and only two cheeses. Some french onion soups tend to have a sweet taste to it but I loved this one it was not too sweet and I only added salt to taste. Will definately use again.  Thanks

I thought this soup was very good and my husband thought it was excellent. Like many others, I carmelized the onions before continuing with the recipe. I used vidalia onions, which worked well. All in all, I found the soup a tad bland for my tastes. Next time I plan on putting 2T worcestershire sauce, 1T red wine vinegar, and 1 bay leaf in the soup for added flavor. Oh, and I plan to cut down on the butter because I found the soup a bit greasy. The cheese combination called for in this recipe was delicious. Thanks for the yummy, easy recipe!

The French Onion soup needs more taste. I think the different cheeses were to much. I love French Onion soup and this recipe doesn't meet my expectations.

This soup is a winner!  I hosted a special dinner party for 6 and had this soup as the 2nd course...my guests said it was the best soup they had ever had...and they were french onion soup fans.  I've been requested to make this soup again for our church luncheon...

Very simple and delicious.  I added about 1T of Worcestershire sauce, as previously recommended, but would probably cut the butter in half next time just to make it a little healthier.  Otherwise, really good... thanks!

Very tasty soup. I didn't have oven proof bowls so I laid the bread slices out on a cookie sheet, topped them with the cheeses and put them under the broiler until they were speckled with brown and bubbly, then put them over the bowls of soup. I liked the combination of cheeses better than just using Swiss. Yummy!

This is the most amazing French Onion Soup, we made this for Bastille Day and it was wonderful.  The name says it all; Simple and Rich.  We made it exactly as stated as far as ingredients.  I did prepare up to the point where it would go in the bowls.  Then I put it in the refrigerator as suggested, the next day I warmed it up, placed into the bowls, with bread and all the cheese, broiled it until beautiful and served.  It was the best.

This is how French onion soup should be. No frills, just flavor. I actually threw mine in the crock pot for a few hours, it works! I topped with slices of French Baguettes, another recipe on this site, and mozzarella.

Truly rich and delicious.  By necessity, I had to use chicken broth instead of beef, basil instead of thyme, and also leave the bread out for my gluten-intolerant mother-in-law.  I used a generous handful of grated jack cheese on each, and had a lovely meal accompanied by green salad.  Thanks for the easy, yummy recipe!

We love this recipe. It is super easy, and very tasty.  I have been using a combo of different onions, 2 white, 1 yellow is my husbands favorite,but mine is 2 yellow and 1 white.  We both agree red onions do not go.  I started substituting some beef consume for broth and that also kicked the flavor up. ?? Lastly I found using sour dough is great, but again my husband likes the French bread. 
One problem, which is not with the recipe is we love bread bowls for soup, but can't figure out how to make it work with these.. they are better for creamier soups.

Enjoy!

Oh no... I'm sure the soup resulting from this recipe is fine, but by not caramelizing the onions, not pouring the soup over the bread (having been toasted and topped with swiss), using provolone and not swiss, I can't say this is "french" onion soup, but onion soup with thyme.

I browned the onions (1 big sweet, 1 red, 2 big spanish) over low and slow heat....I couldn't help myself.  The beef stock I used was in a red box- Kitchen Basic (? we can't remember the name right now) because it was 2x as much as Swanson broth- we figured we'd see if $ = quality.  It does.  I followed the recipe exactly- with a couple shakes of worchestershire sauce and used some parm. cheese in with the other cheeses at the end.  We toasted the bread before we put it on the soup.  Overall, I'd say this is the BEST and EASIEST french onion soup I've ever made.  YUM!!!!!!!!

I made this today and it is the best onion soup I have ever had! I browned the onions till carmelized and added 2 cloves of garlic and a pinch of brown sugar. I omitted the sherry.  I toasted baguette rounds placed them in the bowls of soup covered them with swiss and paremsean cheese then melted under the broiler. Yummy! Will make again and serve with green salad. Thanks for the recipe.

VERY good soup, and very easy!  I toasted the french bread under the broiler and dropped them into the soup bowls afterwards and it was still fantastic.  We cut down on the cheese and only used the provolone, and subbed out 1/4 cup of the butter for 2 tbsps extra olive oil.  Next time I'll cut the oil down to allow the onions to brown as others have suggested.  There was too much grease for anything to brown!!  But still a very yummy soup.

This was amazing! Almost exactly like what I've had in restaurants. Next time, I will use half the butter, not only for health reasons, but also because I think it will make the soup taste even better!

This french onion soup recipe is by far the best I've come across! Great for the cold days we've been having. I did change some of the ingredients. I waited until the onions were almost carmalized then I sprinkled 2 tbs of flour over them and continued to stir. I added a bay leaf, 2 sprigs of thyme and 2 cloves of garlic. Then added 2tbs of white cooking wine because I didn't have any sherry on hand. Simmerd that for about 10 min then I removed the bay leaf and thyme. After that of course came the beef broth and salt and pepper to taste. Simmerred for about 30min and whalah....sooo YUMMY!

This is my go-to "impressing company" soup! everyone is wowed that it is homemade, and it is so easy!! It is very delicious too. Other reviewers have commented on the type of broth to use, I personally use a very famous brand (starts with a C) of Beef Consumme. I water it down some, but not fully, it is very flavorful. I always serve this soup in the white soup crocks that are oven-safe- toasting the bread, and topping with a slice of provolone, and a slice of mozzarella cheese. Then I brown it under the broiler. Swiss is traditional, but I recommend using gruyere, it's worth the cost!It literally looks like it came from a restaurant. Using good-quality sherry is great too, but even "cooking sherry" is fine. Thanks for the awesome impressive recipe.

While this was easy it was lacking the flavour of french onion soup and was also fairly greasy.

Yummy recipe.  I sauteed the onions in some of the beef broth instead of the butter and olive oil to cut down on the fat.

Followed recipe exactly.  Delicious!  Hint:  Use a quality sherry, rather than an off the shelf cooking sherry.  The taste difference is amazing.

I'm vegetarian so didn't eat this myself but I did prepare it.  It was so easy to prepare that I was able to make my own seperate  food at the same time.  It was a huge hit and has been request frequently.

Easy to make. No need for near as much butter and oil. I cut way down and it was just great.

This is a great recipe for french onion soup.  Like everyone else I made some of my own adjustments.  I used vidallia onions for a sweeter taste and before I added any liqued, I sweat some garlic out with the onions.  Then  I used brandy to deglaze the pan (I didn't have sherry), then I poured in the stock.  It is execllent!!

The soup itself was delicious. I am on low-carb, so didn't use the bread; the cheese didn't puff up, which was a little disappointing, but the soup was still very, very good.

The best thing about this soup is how easy it is to make.  The second thing, is the taste.  It's very delicious and satisfying for such a simple recipe.  However, keep in mind, this soup is based solely on the broth or beef stock you're using.  Expensive doesn't always = the best.  The best beef stock or broth to use, is the one you're familar with and like the best according to your tastes.  I find canned broth or stock to be not for my tastes, so I used OXO cubes, about 8 cubes, some Worch. sauce, and a bit of beef extract paste mixed with boiling water.  This gave the flavor dimensions a very solid, rich taste.
I didn't use the sherry or Thyme (I don't like Thyme) but suspect a full-bodied sherry would have been a nice addition.
Try adding  a splash of red wine when adding the beef broth !

Well, the title of the recipe sure does not fib. It certainly is RICH and pretty easy. However, I found it to be a bit too rich for my taste. I really liked the first half of my bowl, but I definitely couldn’t finish, it was just too rich. I think the thyme is what gave it it’s super rich flavor. I’ve actually never had French onion soup with thyme, so I found it interesting that this recipe called for it. I may try using less next time. I also added garlic in mine (I put garlic in everything) and I think that added a nice flavor to it. My husband loved it, but agreed that it was a bit on the rich side. I have no idea what the people were thinking who wrote the reviews that this soup was bland and had no flavor. If anything, it had too much flavor lol. It’s not the type of soup you would want seconds of. It’s perfect just as a starter to a meal. I think I may make it again because my husband liked it, but I will be looking for a 'lighter' recipe for myself.  :)

Excellent!  Since we are vegetarians, we made a few changes.  We used vegetable broth and added "Kitchen Bouquet", a browning and seasoning sauce.  We find it helps the veggie version.

This was pretty good.  I caramelized the onions for almost 3 hours before adding the broth.  Also added a beef boullion cube.  Would have been great with homemade stock.

I was so disapponted.  My family loves F. onion soup.  After slowly eating a bowl (not a good sign), my husband refilled with my son's Campbell's chicken noodle soup.  I won't be making this again.

My sister made this for Christmas and it was fabulous.  Although, I would suggest toasting the bread first.  Ours was a little soggy, but it didn't take away from how fantastic this soup was.  Definitely a keeper!

We love French Onion Soup and this recipe is one of our favorites.  Our favorite part is all the wonderful cheeses.  Carmelizing the onions can be a bit tedious, but its completely worth it!

I made this for my parent's 40th anniversary and everyone loved it.  My husband told me it was as good as "Little Bo's," one of our favorite restaurants, and my mom said it was as good as Applebee's!  I used fresh Valdalia onions and one yellow onion, and added a little brown sugar.  It really is very, very good!

I made this soup a couple of weeks ago.  It was the first time I made French Onion soup and it was out of this world!  My husband and I both loved it.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I never do when I cook.  It definately rates an A+ with me.

It’s a good start. I agree with some of the suggestions, additions. I only use butter. I get my onions browned and keep scraping the pan and keep any bits from bottom of pan. I cook on medium heat, and when onions are browned I add: a TBS of garlic, a teaspoon of Dijon mustard, a TBS of sugar, a tsp of worcheshire and cook for an additional 3-5min) then add my broth 2 bay leaves, a dash of dried oregano and dried parsley. The best French onion soup you’ll ever have!

Used 5 large  caramelized  onions which was too much.  Also beef stock and dry sherry,  both which I think added to much salt  Saved leftovers and added pepper, worked out great.  Will use low sodium stock next time and skip sherry.

This was easy and delicious, and I used spring onions from my garden since we were pulling the onions  out.  I couldn't find provolone so I used mozzarella.  I added a few generous shakes of cayenne pepper, and this gave the soup a nice heat.  Put some of the salt and pepper while cooking the onions (I cooked them till they were very soft and tender because I do not like crunchy onions).  Oh, and I added garlic at the very start, before I put the onions in.  The garlic and cayenne pepper will be  must additions when I make this again.  Thanks for this recipe!

This soup is fantastic.  I followed the recipe except added a little more dry vermouth.  I confess I used Swiss cheese instead of the recommend cheese.  I think it is better than restaurant quality because I found it to be way less salty!  Also I used Minors beef base instead of beef broth.  I realize Minors bases are expensive but they are truly worth it.  This is a KEEPER of a recipe!

After reading many reviews and following my own tastes in food, I decided to fully brown the onions. I also added a tsp. of sugar along with a large pinch each of salt and pepper to the onions as I browned them. I also reduced the amount of butter to 2 tbls. and used 1 tsp. fresh thyme instead of dried. I also used the dry sherry. I think it just added another layer of flavor to this yummy soup. I used mozzarella instead of Swiss because my family does not like Swiss in soups. I toasted the french bread and cubed it for easier eating. This soup was DELICIOUS. Full of flavor and better than most that I've tried in restaurants. This will be made often in my home.

Great recipe, like many others I tweaked it a little. Swapped out red wine for the sherry and added a chicken boullion. I also cooked the onions until caramelized. I also didn't have broiler proof bowls so I toasted the French bread pieces under the broiler for two mins then added provolone  and Swiss until browned (3 mins) and dropped them into the broth, magnifique!!

Little less thyme, less butter, toast bread in broiler with little spray butter. Beef stock in box much taster than can or broth. Gruyere cheese is a good substitute for swiss. Good over all recipe as is.

I made this last night. I followed the directions with 2 changes..I carmelized the onions and toasted the bread. I had high hopes after reading the reviews. I was really disappointed. ... the amount of thyme was way too much and the amount of beef broth made it waaaay to beefy. We did not care for it at all! I think the beef broth needs to be cut down to less than half the suggested amount and replaced with water. Not sure I will bother with trying this again even with changes

This tasted just like my favorite French Onion Soup at a certain restaurant. The only thing I did different was to omit the swiss cheese. Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing.

I've been craving French Onion soup for months now. This soup is perfect. I didn't have the stock so I added about a cup and a half of water with 2 beef bullion cubes (I made a single serving) I also didn't have the thyme or sherry but it's brilliant!

Made this recipe for dinner this evening. I skipped the bread and cheese on top. I'm sorry, I know it is a hallmark of this dish but even with toasting I find that addition to be soggy so I did shredded provolone & mozzarella on top and had egg twist rolls with garlic parmasean butter on the side. My son helped cook it so it is definitely a simple recipe. My husband ate two big bowls of it so I guess it was tasty too!

I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and the olive oil to 1 TBSLP, carmelizing the onions for one hour, and lowering the heat. I also added 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup of sherry and reduced the amount of thyme. The boxed beef broth I used was low sodium. Used a combination of gruyere, mozzarella and parmesan cheese, adding some inside the crock bowl before pouring in the soup. Great comfort food on a day when there's a blizzard going on with 2 ft+ of snow! Thanks Lori for the great starting point. GO PATS!!!

Love this soup. Only things I changed was I used a red wine instead of sherry because that is what I had. And browned the onions. Fantastic soup!

Incroyable! 6 medium yellow onions, at least. Caramalize. Well worth the time. Then: 1 minced garlic clove for 1 min. 1/3 cup Merlot or sherry. 1 tsp sugar. 1-2 litres beef broth (homemade plus 1&1/2 cubes Knorr's beef bullion or Campbell's in the carton). Sprinkle Parmesan. Leftover toast. Swiss, Emmamental & mozzarella cheese shredded. Heaven.

I prefer Onion soup with the caramelized onions!  Try a cognac instead of sherry or wine. Try vegetable broth instead of beef--it itastes just as good.  I use four grated cheeses together; Swiss, smoked Gouda, Gruyere and cheddar.  Finally, try red onions--they are sweeter.

Absolutely delish. I didn't have any sherry and it was yummy.  And I did not add any salt.  The broth had enough...even the low-sodium.  Def going in my recipe box.  Thanks.

I made my first onion soup today.  Tasty!  But the advice to brown the onions is good advice.  I used thick sliced provolone, bad idea I love cheese but it was too cheesy.  It was quick easy and tasty A+

This recipe is super easy to make and tastes great.  It is a little time consuming, but worth the time.  I took the recommendations of another and cooked the onions until they were just starting to turn a light brown (about 45 minutes).  I don't believe it would have tasted so good, if I would have put the broth in earlier.   I didn't have sherry on hand, so I used white wine which is listed as a substitute on line and also cut the thyme in half as it is not my favorite spice.  I will definitely make this again.

This was awesome just the way the recipe is written.  My hubby says it rivals the French Onion soups he has had at some very expensive restaurants.  Thank you for sharing, I am so happy to have one of hubby's favorite foods that I can add to my rotation! :)

For me this is NEARLY perfect, however...when the onions are ready I like to dust them with a little bit of flour and then deglaze with the Sherry before adding my stock or broth. The end result is a VERY SLIGHTLY thickened variation that truly sticks to the palate. The key word here being SLIGHTLY, lest it becomes something else. Also, prepping this in a large Rondo really lets me FEEL the process and love for making this grand recipe.

Just made this today (a perfect day to make it on this snowy December day)...YUMMM-MEEE!!!! I caramelized the onions, used the sherry AND some red wine...I used 2 sweet onions, 1 yellow onion and 2 red onions. Only 1/4 cup butter...2 Knorr beef bouillon cubes. 4 cans of beef broth and 1 can of chicken broth (I would have used 2 but didn't have another one) As I started cooking I realized I didn't have any dried Thyme...ugh! So I used an Italian blend with thyme, marjoram, rosemary, sage, oregano & basil (McCormick). I used Gruyere and Fontina cheese on top.  It was REALLY good! My picky 8 year old daughter LOVED it! So did the hubs. By the way, I have NEVER made French Onion Soup before...but I'm a confident cook and things I make for the first time usually come out really good. My brother makes FOS all the time but this one kicks his FOS's butt!!!! I will be making this again and again!

I loved this recipe! Sooo simple, the only change I made was to use 1 stick of butter rather than 2.

Great start -has good ratios but you must brown onions or soup will taste like beef broth.. -- buy low salt broth too so soup doesn't get salty as it reduces.. I used 2 chicken broth and 1 beef.. would be good with high end veggie broth too.

This soup was delicious and oh so easy! The hardest part was not burning the butter in the first step. I will definitely make this again, HOWEVER, I will cook the onions more (until they are brown and caramelized) then continue on with the other steps as stated in the recipe. I recommend making the switch from sherry to red wine; I didn't measure it. I also added another onion to it. This is certainly one I will make again and again for my family.

Simple, easy, delicious! My modifications: I didn't have that kind of wine, so I skipped it. I'm not a fan of Swiss cheese, so I only used provolone. I turned up the heat on the soup just enough when I was ready to serve it so that the heat of the soup would melt the slice of provolone cheese I put into a regular soup bowl. I then sprinkled into the soup a few Caesar croutons I already had purchased before. The cheese melted, the croutons soaked, and I skipped the whole broiler thing. I'm no chef, so perhaps these modifications wouldn't work for more sophisticated tastes, but for me, it was easy and delicious!

I made this as written, without the sherry. It was so easy, and tasted fantastic.  Will make it again, doubling it and serving it as main dish with a salad.

This was good - a really simple recipe. I didn't have sherry, or swiss cheese. I think this will be an easy, go-to recipe. I might try some of those that are more involved for a more complex tasting soup.

Really great recipe.  Next time I will dramatically reduce the amount of butter used.  Its not that I don't love butter, its that I couldn't get the onions to caramelize. I halved it because my husband was out of town, and I love soup, but not enough to eat it for weeks.  Also, I had about half of a huge red onion in my fridge, so I used that and one yellow onion.  I didn't measure the thyme, but thought it was a nice flavor.  I also added oregano because I really like oregano, and its a very spanish flavor (as is Sherry).  
Will DEFINITELY make again.  Delicious and simple.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband really liked it, but it was really too rich for me. I felt a little ill from all the butter I think. And when I was putting away the last bowlful to the fridge for leftovers, there was like a 1/4 inch of liquid butter/oil sitting on top. I only used 1/4 cup butter but otherwise followed the recipe.

This was absolutely delish!!!!  I followed the recipe, except I decreased the amount of butter. I probably put a 1/4 cup instead of 1/2.  I didn't have sherry so I used red wine that I had leftover. Per someone elses review, I added 2 dashes of worsheshire sauce. I bought Gueyre (sp?) cheese (expensive- so I will prob just use provelone/swiss next time) but absolutely delish!!!  I toasted the bread in cubes too before placing the cheese on top.  SO GOOD!  Just as good as actual french onion soup I had in Paris. Will be making this again!

Awesome! I made this today. I did carmelize the onions, cooked them slowly on low for about 30 mins.  Used Publix french bread, toasted, and provolone and swiss on top with also some parmesan.  It was delicious.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I'm sure I'll make this a few more times as winter is just getting started!

This is a delicious recipe and perfect if you've never made French Onion Soup before! The only thing that I would recommend is changing the amount of butter/oil. The amount called for is way too much and if you put it in the fridge overnight it becomes filmy on top of the soup.  I have never used the recommended bread/cheese prep on here -- instead I make homemade croutons in the oven and put sprinkle cheese over the top.

I doubled the recipe and took it to a party. I received rave reviews for this dish. Since I was carrying it to go, I toasted French baguette bread with the cheeses on them...so folks could drop them in or dunk them like large croutons. Oh, and I also caramelized the onions...better flavor, in my opinion.

It was pretty good.  Next time I make it, I will make a few changes.  the thyme taste was too strong for me so I will leave it out.  May add garlic and worchestershire sauce.  This was my first time making french onion soup so I know for the next time to cook onions more also.

It's not the best I've ever had but it was good.  I would probably make it again... I had to use extra beef broth to make it a "soup" (maybe I used too many sliced onions.  I hope that by freezing the leftover portion and reheating it that it will be even better the second time around!

Yum!  I LOVE French Onion Soup when we go out and now I make it at home!  I do follow the recipe for the most part, but I do brown the onions some...it adds more flavor as others have said.  I do not use the sherry or thyme...instead I add 2 Tbsp Worchestershire Sauce.  Then, instead of French bread, I just use croutons...they don't get as soggy.  The end result is delicious!

Now, I did alter this just a teeny bit by doing 1/4 cup each of butter and evoo, but the rest EXACTLY as written (with a Better-Thank-Bouillon sub for canned broth) and a heavy hand with the sherry =)  Result = A-MA-ZING!!!  PERFECT!  Used a day old dried out French baguette from Panera, tossed in evoo s&p garlic, toasted 400d 8m, and that part was absolutely delectible... soaked up the broth and caught the melted cheese, all crunchy and soggy... mmm...  Paired this with Panzanella Salad (to use up the rest of the baguette cubes) and a nice Pinot Grigio.  Best dinner I've made in a bit...  I cannot stress enough how a good quality oiled and TOASTED bread can take this to ethereal places.  You can't rush this one either, but give it an hour or so of your life and you will be quite pleased with yourself, as I am.  Made the full recipe and it is 4 generous entree sized servings (using 3 lg Walla Walla onoins).

This soup is so easy to make and tastes just like the soup you'd get in a good restaurant.  I doubled the onions and let them brown (you definitely want to let them brown since this is what gives the soup such a rich flavor).  Instead of canned beef broth I used Better than Bullion beef base and it came out great! I think next time I will blend the Gruyere cheese with mozarella so it's a little easier to melt.

Taste was a little bland. I toasted the bread before adding it to the top of the soup, but still ended up with a soggy mess. Not as good as restaurant style French Onion soup. I'll keep looking.

Great Recipe!  Very quick and simple.  Don't waste time changing any of the ingredients.  I suggest toasting the bread before putting it on top, otherwise it gets quite soggy.  I also put a dash of paprika on top of the cheese.  Yummy!

I thought this soup was very good.  I also cooked my onions for about 20 minutes before adding the other ingredients. I did have a problem with my french bread soaking up all the broth I had in the bowl while it broiled even though I toasted it first. It was still yummy though, I just added more broth.

I was 10oz short on beef broth so ended up using water instead, and it still turned out fantastic! I can only imagine what it will taste like with the right amount of broth! I made the french bread as well. I wasn't even a big french onion soup fan, I was making it for my bf. But now I'm a fan and will be making it again soon! I have never made this before, and as a beginner, it was a pretty easy recipe. Definately try this one!

I'm only giving this 3 stars, even tho one of the reasons I didnt like it was my own fault. I'm not sure what I was looking at, but I put 2 teaspoons of tyme in it. The extra tyme ruined it, but it still had very little flavor, not like I remember my grandfater making.

Authentic!  Followed exactly, except I carmelized the onions.  Tastes just like in the restaurant.  Easy and delicious!  I cut the bread into small pieces and toasted it prior to putting in soup.  So good!

With some tweaking, this recipe can easily be a 5 star.  I agree with the other reviewers that say carmelizing in french onion soup is a must.  It truly makes all the difference.  I also thought the thyme was overpowering.  I definitely will make this again, but with the carmelizing of the onions and alot less thyme.

A very good soup.  Made as written, however I did use fresh thyme rather than dried.  Next time I would omit the provolone and substitute with Gruyere cheese.  And also add a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce.  Thanks for the recipe Lori!

Delicious! I don't usually like French onion soup much, but my husband does and orders it at restaurants all the time. My neighbor grows onions and gave me some, and as I sat there wondering what to do with a few huge onions, I decided to give this a try! As I said, I often find French onion soup to be just ok, but this was DELICIOUS! A few tips: YES, toast the French bread before using.  Much better when it is not completely soggy! In my opinion, saute the onions. I think that step helped me to like the soup so much more. And lastly, make sure you have enough broth. Much of the broth soaks into the bread when you bake it, and you don't want to end up with mostly onions on the bottom!

So I have tried this soup as written, and again with a few changes.  As written this is a very good side dish or appetizer. It is delicious, while leaving one room for the meal ahead.  Personally, when I make French Onion Soup, it is the meal, so I've made some changes.  I caramelize the onions, as it makes the soup richer.  I also add 1/2 tsp Parsley to the soup.   I toast some crouton-sized bread chunks in the oven while the soup is simmering.  French bread works very well, but I prefer the Bread Machine Pumpernickel Bread recipe found on this site.  When the soup is ready, I fill the bowls, add a few toasted bread pieces, crumble in some havarti, top with a  full slice of havarti, and a bit of parmesan.  I put it in the oven until the cheese melts, and then serve.

very simple and VERY GOOD! I carmelized the onions like everyone else said..took like 25 mins. I think next time I would of used less butter..I am watching my calories and I dont think that much was needed. :) I also added salt as another recipe suggested to help with the carmelizing

This was AMAZING, but "do not brown the onions"?!?!?!? Are you INSANE? That's where the french onion soup gets its flavor!! I substituted vegetable broth for the beef broth and caramelized the hell out of the onions for my sister's thirtieth birthday dinner and everyone LOVED it. For more everyday dinners I would cut the butter down, though..maybe halve it. It is EXTREMELY rich. Perfect for a special occasion, a bit overwhelming for Tuesday night dinner. And be patient--caramelizing onions takes forever, but it's very much worth it.

Tastes excellent!  I made a vegetarian version my using 2 cans of vegetable broth, 1 can of water, 1 TBS soy sauce and 1 TBS Worcestershire sauce in addition to the thyme, salt and pepper....its tasted great!  I would recommend cutting back on the amount of butter....while it tasted great with 1 stick, it may be a bit much, and I am sure you could get away with half as much!

Just as I remembered onion soup should taste. I did brown the onions and found it gave the soup a wonderfully sweet and rich flavour. I had some left over white wine so I used it to deglaze the onion sugars. I also had some left over stale 2 day old baguette and that did the trick without needing to be toasted. Great soup!

I didn't have bowls that I could put in to broil, but I diced and mixed the cheeses together and layered it on top of some garlic and parmesan croutons.  The cheese still melted just fine.  This tastes just as good as, if not better the soup I've tried in restaurants!  I will definitely make this again.

This was a great recipe but way too many onions for me. At the end of the bowl I was just eating onions with hardly any broth.

Thank you Lori for an excellent recipe. I have never made French Onion Soup before and decided to give it a try after reading your recipe. I did made a few changes.. I browned my onions (I love them browned) I did not have swiss or provolone cheese - so I used gruyere cheese instead. I used only 2 tablespoons of butter and replaced 1 can of beef broth with one cup of a dry white wine. I added the dry sherry after cooking the soup for 20 minutes. This soup was a real winner in my house! Even my husband (who does not typically like cooked onions) enjoyed the soup. Next time, I will try the soup with Provolone and Swiss.

Super easy to make, and everyone loved it!  I actually made this to go with the slow cooker beef I was doing so the guys ended up with a side of soup.  Perfect for a cold rainy/snowy day!  Will absolutely make again!

Perfect dish for this dark and stormy night.  I adapted it a bit based on reviewer recommendations and ingredient availability.  Cut the butter in half (absolutely no loss) and carmelized onions over about 40 minutes.  Added about 1/2 cup white wine (instead of sherry), which I boiled off.  Stirred in a couple of Tbsp flour and cooked a bit before adding broth.  Toasted the bread (from my inventory of frozen baguette leftovers) for the topping prior to putting in the soup, adding cheeses, and doing the broil thing.  Cheeses available tonight were gruyere, mozzarella and romano.  Absolutely dee-lish and prepared from easily available ingredients.  Highly recommend.

The soup its self is awsome, but the french bread gets soggy instantly. Next time ill try a baguette or a bread much denser and dryer.  Great soup! Tastes just like Mimi's Cafe french onion soup. TY

this was really yummy!! the only reason I didn't give the full 5 stars is because I think there was a little too much butter/oil, and I added some more sherry. I also used some different cheeses just because that's what I had on hand - sharp white cheddar, shredded italian blend, and shredded parmesan. Very good, and even better the next day!

I had been looking for a really good onion soup. I Just made this last night and it was great! The cheese and bread on top really were the final touch. My bread didn't finish baking in time so I used croutons and they worked fine. I will for sure be making this again. I think it would go great with prime rib and a salad!

A real winner, served it for a ladies Lunch. What a hit. I was using my very old original Pyrex dishes. They are patterened and not dishwasher safe so I was reluctant to broil them Instead I broiled the toated French bread -cheese on top then put them in the soup . Rave reviews. Thank you

Delicious! Toast the bread, for sure! Definately use sherry! It made such a difference! Next time I will cut the thyme in half, it was a little over powering. Yummy! Can't wait to make it again!

Good jumping point. Only used the butter for the onions (which I browned). Then added a bay leaf, some balsamic vinegar, and Worcester sauce to the recipe. The added flavors really rounded it out, and it wasn't any more effort to make. Best I've ever had!

Good basic recipe; I used 3 cans beef broth one can chicken broth.  Used red onion, vidalia onion, and some julienned leek.  Substituted a little chardonnay and brandy when I deglazed the pan before adding stock instead of the sherry (and yes, I caramellized the onions).

This recipe was delicious!  For those of you who are French Onions Soup fans, I highly recommed this recipe for all to try.  I too made some minor modifications; I carmelized the onions and added a pinch of parsely to the broth.  To avoid sogginess, I sliced the bread into one inch pieces and lightly toasted them (on both sides) in the oven before placing it in the soup.  I had to omit the sherry since I did not have it on hand; still, it came out perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was really tasty, however when I made it I halved the butter (because we are on a low calorie diet) but even with halving the butter, I still thought there was a bit much (the taste was slightly overwhelming).  Maybe it's cause i'm used to eating low cal though :p  Anyways, next time I am going to use 1/4 of the recommended butter and i think it will be perfect.

Amazing.  I've never made french onion soup before but we just LOVED this.  I didnt put the sherry in, because i dont like the flavour of cooked alcohol and it was beautiful. Can't wait to use up the other half of our french bread on more soup!!!

This was very good, had to change a couple of things just for personal preference though. We went with rosemary and parm croutons and all I had on hand for cheese was mozza and parm. It was great either way, the longer it simmers, the tastier it gets.

Make sure you caramelize the onions because thta is really what gives good deep flavor, and I drian off the extra butter to cut the greasy mouth feel, but otherwise, the basics of this recipe are fantastic.  Use a good quality stock, not cheap stuff, and you will get a really rich deep flavor, the extra couple bucks is worth it!

Sorry, there's something missing here. I followed the recipe exactly and it was too bland, too much provolone cheese also. I tried to doctor up the left overs but something is still missing.

I served this at a dinner party and started with this soup. I read the reviews first and followed the recipe through and decided that next time I will cut the butter in half as the taste is fairly strong, and I used beef boullion and water for the beef broth. I agree that the onion should be carmelized as others said, and I think it made for so much more flavour. Everyone absolutely loved it. I am sure I will make this again and again.

I've been using this recipe minus the sherry for years and it's a hit every single time. The key is the beef broth, use a good quality broth. I've found that Swanson low sodium beef broth is the best by far. I also score the bread on to make it easier to eat with the soup... Yummie!

I made this the first time, following the recipe exactly (except I didn't have the Sherry) and the only major complaint that I have was the amount of oil/fat.  I took a couple of thin napkins to try to soak some of it up from the top of the soup before I added the bread & cheese but it still tasted very "greasy".  It was very tasty.  Next time I'll try less butter and Swiss cheese since most highly-rated recipes are calling for Swiss.  Very good otherwise.

I thought this was pretty good.I agree with one of the others- I did brown some of the onions. I also thought there was too much butter- went I put it in the fridge for left overs there was a huge skin of fat on top. I pulled that off and it was great.  Next time I will only use enough butter and oil to brown some of the onions.

Absolutely divine.  Just like ordering from an upscale restaurant.  I cooked the onions longer as previous reviewers suggested and it turned out perfect.

A great French Onion Soup recipe! It IS very rich with all the butter (which I wouldn't change) and I doubled the whole recipe to have lots of leftovers. I pretty much followed the recipe as is. I did add the sherry but was only able to find "dry cocktail sherry," but it tasted as it should to me and I do recommend using the sherry, it was a good flavor addition. I did not carmelize the onions b/c I don't like the onions too sweet in my soup - I think the carmelization is just a personal preference, no right or wrong. I also made sure that I toasted the bread before adding it to the soup, that I also recommend. I will enjoying my leftovers and will certainly be making again! Thanks for the posting!

I wanted to try this recipe because it does not call for caramelizing the onions.  This was good but not a true French Onion Soup for us without the caramelized onions.  I will continue to spend close to an hour to caramelize the onions and add a couple of tablespoons of flour before I transfer to my slow cooker to add the remaining broth ingredients.  I also will use half beef broth and half chicken broth.

This recipe is amazing! The french onion soup tasted better or was on par with that of fancy restaurants! I advise to definitely brown the onions. Instead of sherry I add a little red wine. The parmesean is optional in my opinion. Make sure to bake the bread for a few minutes to dry it out some.

This recipe is very easy and quite quick. I skipped the sherry (personal preference), however the flavor of the soup was still very hearty. Excellent for cold nights.

I made a couple changes to this recipe- 1) I added more onions (approx 2 additional cups, I didn't think there was enough onions with only 4 cups.  I let the soup for at least 2-3 hrs, this gave it enough time to become flavorful. It was very delicious and simple to make!!

Update 3/18/12: I tried this recipe again and this time I wasn't a fan of it...I think it has way too much butter in it.  Next time I will use a higher quality beef stock and cut down on the amount of butter.

This was easy to make, and delicious too!  Once all the flavors had a chance to mingle, it really came together.  I wasn't able to use my broiler, but when I put the (oven-safe) soup bowl in the oven with French bread and two kinds of cheese on top to melt, it came out looking just like the stuff I had at a restaurant a week before ... and tasted even better, because I knew everything that was in it.  Didn't have any sherry, so I left it out... never even missed it.  Great comfort food on a chilly evening!

This is a great recipe, goes together so easy and fast!  I don't use the cheese and bread in the soup though, as I don't like soggy bread.  I set those aside to make sandwiches.  Sliced roast beef and provolone on a nice bun goes great with this soup, and for those of you who like soggy bread, its great to dip you sandwich in the soup.

I thought that the soup was good, but it just doesn't compare to my mom's.  I know it really isn't fair to compare it.  Like other reviews, you really need to carmalize the onions.  Much better flavor.  I also substituted the sherry with brandy. Mmmm!  I also used Muenster Cheese, just because I really, really like it.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly which is why I'm only giving 4 stars.  This soup is easy to make and pretty tasty but it needs a little something.  Next time I'll try carmelizing the onions as suggested by another reviewer and see if that gives it the extra kick it needs to reach the 5 star status.

Delicious!  I did make a few changes.  I caramelized the onions; this is part of what gives the soup it's richness.  I also used homemade croûtons for my bread.  I prefer the flavor & texture they add to the soup as opposed to untoasted bread.  My favorite to use are rye croutons.

It was the first time I made French Onion soup ever, and a second  time I ate french onion soup. This recipe won my heart. Definitely brown the onions! I used a red wine blend, instead on sherry and beef base, instead of canned stock (a semi-liquid paste, sold in the same isle with bullion cubes - it gave  such a rich flavor, you could not even tell it was not the real deal). I did not have oven-proof bowls, so I just toasted the bread slices topped with swiss, mozarella, and parmesan under the broiler until slightly browned and bubbly. Delisious!!!

Fantastic!  I carmelized my onions, though (oil and butter in the pan, cooked onions on medium for 40 minutes covered) to add extra flavor.  The only cheese I had was provolone and that proved cheesy enough.  I also didn't have any bread, so I sprinkled some croutons in the bowls and didn't put in the oven.  Delicious.

Love it. I did brown my onions because from all of the recipes I've read before says to brown the onions. Mine was a little sweet, I think because I used sweet onions. So I had to add about a 1/2 tablespoon of beef bullion to calm the sweetness. I didn't have any thyme so I added tarragon and it still tasted great. My husband agreed and I will be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe.

So simple yet so tasty.  I made it with only shredded mozzarella since I didnt have those sliced cheeses on hand, but it was so delicious.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Way too much thyme for my liking(seemed to overpower the onion flavor)-next time I will cut it in half. I do recommend to caramelize the onions too!

This was excellent!! I made it tonight for dinner with full intent to move on to the main entre that I had prepared.  I found this filling and satisfying.  My husband who is not a fan of onion soups liked it!  What I changed:  I used sweet onions and carmelized them. I was a little short on the beef broth, so I added a can of campbells Onion soup straight from the can.  I also toasted the french bread before I topped the soup with them and the cheese -- My dinner dishes were broiler proof, so I used the soup bowls I had.  Excellent! Thanks for sharing.

So satisfying and easy to make!  I didn't add extra salt--the broth had enough.  And I omitted the bread (trying to cut extra carbs!) and just placed the cheese on top of the soup.  Will make this again!!

I kept the recipe almost the same except 1)I too browned the onions 2)I used my own stock instead of from cans 3)I skipped the alcohol. The  soup was great in flavor but there is so much butter in it, I actually felt sick all evening after eating it. Next time I will either use at least half the butter or stain off the excess (because it does need a good amount to fry the onions). Overall a good soup and worth making again.

might put just a tiny bit less oil and butter, so that onion has a real chance to caramelize (like this it more like swims in the oil then caramelizes), but otherwise excellent recipe, which has been a true success every time we cooked it. very simple and delicious.

I thought that this was a good recipe; not a great one, though.  Despite other users' rave reviews I have to admit that I thought it was a bit lacking in flavor.  After letting it simmer for a while my husband and I both agreed that it lacked the little bit of kick we both like in french onion soup.  I added quite a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce, red wine, and pepper, which made it pretty good in the end.  My husband LOVED it, I thought that the French Onion soup 3 recipe from this website was better.  I won't try this one again.

Absolutely delicious! I used red wine instead of brandy because that's what I had. The thyme is key to the great flavor. I have cut back on the butter to about half to make it a bit healthier and the flavor is still great!

Very, very good.  My only concern was the amount of butter/oil on top of each bowl.  Next time I will cut the butter in half and see if it ruins the flavor or if it's fine with less.  Next time I will also use a little more sherry and a little less thyme.  My husband loves french onion soup in restaurants and he gave this one a thumbs up with 4 stars.  Thanks!  I'll be making this regularly on cold, sleety days like today.

I love this recipe!  It was so easy and so tasty!  The only ways I modified this were to use Riesling wine instead of the dry sherry, and I used one slice each of provolone and light swiss, without the parmesan.  There were two servings left, which I left in the individual serving bowls... they heated up great as leftovers.  I will definitely be making this one again!:)

My husband is always begging me to make this soup.  I follow the recipe exactly except for the bread.  I just bake the bread and melt the cheese in the oven on its own and when I pour the soup into the bowls I just plop the bread on top!  Its just as good, I promise.  Very good comfort food!

I have made this recipe several times now. The last time I made it, I subbed sauteed mushrooms for the onions. I thought it was out of this world! My father-in-law likes the tradional onions, though, and I make it that way for him. I originally picked this recipe from all the other French Onion Soup recipes on this site because it called for sherry and not white wine.

This recipe was great!I used 3 medium onions(not sure if that was 4 cups, but it was adequate. After adding all the ingredients, I let it cook for a few minutes. To serve, we put it in a bowl, and topped it with some Muenster and Swiss cheese, and lastly sourdough bread pieces. GREAT!!!

Very simple and easy to make. I think I messed up by using 50% less sodium/fat free beef broth because there wasn’t much flavor at first. I added two beef bouillon cubes, doubled the sherry and added 1/4 cup chardonnay. I used only Swiss cheese and thickly grated parmesan (no provolone). It turned out fantastic. My husband said “yum” as soon as he tasted it and I loved it too. Will definitely make again (with modifications).

I have made this several times and absolutely love it.  I use a combination of sweet, yellow and white onions.  I also used red wine instead of sherry.  I never knew that restaurant quality French Onion Soup could be so easy to make!  This will be a recipe I make over and over again.  Love it!

This soup was incredeably easy to make and was really good! Next time I would probably add a beef bullion cube for a stronger taste.

I made this soup almost exactly as directed, the only thing I did differently was substitue Marsala wine for the sherry, and it was absolutely wonderful!  I think it is comparable or better than the French onion soups I have tried at many restaurants.

I too used a home made vegetable broth with a shot of Worshestershire.  I didn't use any butter, just the olive oil.  I decreased the thyme to 1/2 tsp and it was good.  I added a lot of garlic while browning the onions.  I know the recipe said not to, but when I checked other recipes they said to.  I didn't use any salt, the cheese was sufficient.

Absolutely undeniably fabulous!  My family raved!  I raved!  I will make this over and over again.  I put a little too much bread on top...next time I will make sure to cut the bread smaller but it was beautiful and yummy!  One of my favorites so far on this site!

Good the day I made it (but almost too rich)... but leftovers were fantastic!  The butter separated and hardened on top of the dish.  I threw away half of that layer, then reheated.  Yummy!!!  We don't have any broiler safe dishes, so I put the french bread on a foil lined cookie sheet, then added cheeses, broiled and plopped that on top of the soup bowls.  This made reheating leftovers very simple.

My husband LOVED this recipe.  He's a picky eater and oftern orders French Onion Soup at Restaurants.  He thought this was on par with any he's had at a restaurant.  I added some minced garlic when sauteeing the onions.  With the extra bread I made the "Roasted Garlic Bread" recipe found on this site as well.  Went great with the soup and a beer.  I'll definitly make this again.

I simmered this uncovered and it reduced to only three very small bowls of incredibly rich broth and onions. Although very decadent, I will choose to cover the soup next time I simmer. Excellent flavor!

Simply Superb. I have served this soup at my formal multi-course dinners and it never fails to receive rave reviews. My only changes are to add a splash of Worchestershire; and, slice and broil the baguette bread, then immediately rub with fresh clove of garlic prior to adding to the soup. It is a keeper recipe--anyone who writes otherwise did something wrong in the prep.

Awesome!  I have had french onion soup before and nothing compares.  I did make some changes but I can say for certain that the basic recipe is a hit!  I used an organic onion grown at my school's garden, and pacific beef broth for the broth.  I slived 2 cloves of garlic and added a pinch of parsley.  Instead of the french bread I toasted hoagie roast beef sancwhichs topped with parmesian cheese in the toaster.  I will never make a different french onion soup again.  Even my fiance who hates onions ate it!

This was a terrific soup Lori.  I used 2 really large vidalia onions and I think it made 4 cups ( I didn't measure).  I only used Provolone and Mozzarella since that's what I had in fridge and it worked out great.  I served this with Italian Grilled Cheese sandwiches (also on this site).  Yummy!

I am giving this four stars only because it was incredibly salty.  Next time I will not be adding ANY salt to it...the broth and cheese are plenty salty for this recipe.  I will be making it again though...it is a nice starter to a meal. :)

Excellent soup and VERY EASY!!!  I used the Campbell's Beef Broth and it said "double strength" on the can.......it was fine!!!  I did not cook the onions till totally tender, as they got tender as they simmered.  Didnt have any swiss cheese, so that was eliminated. I ladled soup into our "big cups", topped w/ CROUTONS, instead of the bread, sprinkled w/ parm, and topped w/ provolone.  Popped into the microwave to melt the cheese a bit and EVERYONE loved it!!!!

I originally made this last year and rated it 3 stars, but I thought I would try it again tonight.

My biggest recommendation is to only use 1/2 of a stick of butter and I think it's important to not skip the addition of the sherry. Also, using fresh thyme really spruces the soup up. It's very quick and easy to make and I have to say that this time the flavor was  excellent.

This recipe had delicious flavor but was too greasy for my taste. I cut down the butter from one stick to about 2/3 of a stick and still it was far too much.  Next time I'll try half a stick or maybe even less, and probably decrease the thyme a bit, too. But, we enjoyed it and I'll definitely make it again with these revisions.

Excellent!!Thanks for the recipe! I love easy dishes the come out great. **TIME SAVER**: If you toast the bread and cheese seperatly you can just heat them up later in the micro and pop them in the soup when its time to serve! Thanks Again!!

Excellent soup!  I tweaked it a little though by toasting the bread first, then I added 2 tblsp of Worcestershire sauce, a bay leaf, 1 tsp parsley, 1 tsp brown sugar, a splash of browning sauce and a splash of red wine.

Fabulous. We also try french onion soup in restaurants and have a hard time finding just the right combination. I hate browned onions and more so when it's used in french onion soup. This soup provides all the onions you could want without getting browned or carmelized!!!  Thanks. It's a keeper.

THIS IS A TERRIFIC RECIPE!  I SUBBED RED WINE FOR THE SHERRY (I WOULDN'T LEAVE THIS OUT, IT MAKES THE FLAVOR!)  AFTER I COOKED THE ONIONS I LET EVERYTHING SIMMER TOGETHER IN THE CROCK POT FOR A FEW HOURS!  THE FLAVOR WAS FANTASTIC!  I BAKED THE SLICED BREAD DRY SO IT ABSORBS ALL OF THE LIQUID  USED SWISS CHEESE ONLY!  A+

This recipe is simple to make and so very delicious!  My boyfriend LOVES French Onion Soup.  I've tried making it before but it never tasted as good as in a restaurant.  I think the difference was the sherry.  This is the first time I used a French Onion Soup recipe with that as an ingredient.  I truly believe it made all the difference.  I would not leave it out.  Thank you Lori for the recipe!

Good recipe, but I was unable to find 10 ounce cans of beef broth, I did find 10.5 ounces of CONDENSED broth.  I purchased 14.5 ounce cans of beef broth that was not condensed and the recipe worked well.  I think that the recipe should read 40 ounces of beef broth to save the confusion, unless I was supposed to use condensed broth to make a very stronger tasting soup.  None the less, I would make this again.

Wow! Fantastic, I added about 6 peppercorns and a bay leaf, and I took the advice to use garlic texas toast.  I also let it simmer in my crockpot while I cooked the remainder of my dinner.  It got rave reviews from my special guest.

Wow, this is rich and simple just like the title says. Even better than the stuff in restaurants because it is not so salty. The only changes I made were to add some brown sugar to the onions and to add some stew beef that had been dredged in flour and browned. Yum! I will definitely be making this again!!

I thought this receipe was very good. It lacked the bite that you get with restaurant french onion soup, but for at home it did the trick. Halving this receipe made just enough for 2 people. I would certainly make this again.

Everyone loved this recipe!  It's easy to fix and the taste is better than most resturants that I have had.  I thought about cutting out some of the onion in the receipe, but was glad that I didn't once it was made!  Deffinatly will make it again.!

Excellent!!  I cooked the onions longer, about 30-40 min because I like them more caramelized and didn't add sherry because I was out.  Absolutely delicious!

This was so simple to make. And def don’t let the onions caramelize. They will get too soft after the soup simmers. I made that mistake. Otherwise the flavor was so yummy!!

I cook for a very picky crew, and they all love this recipe! I've made it 5 times now, and get raves every time and frequent requests to make it again. One of the crew doesn't like onions, so in a second pan I make a mushroom soup with this base and BAM! everyone is happy!

This is a good easy recipe. One thing I would suggest is using a variety of onions (I used half yellow and half red) possibly adding some shallots to the mix and caramelizing half of them to add a few different levels of flavor.

Okay, about what you would find in an average restaurant. Mu recipe kicks butt, I should add it.  It is missing that special secret ingredient I learned of in a small bistro in Paris back in 1976 . . .

Simple and yummy. Did not have sherry, but DID have really great tequila, well, because we live in MX. So, why not? Awesome, subtle character change from the usual. Keeper recipe for its simplicity.

I made this recipe last night. Super simple. Delicious. Didn't change anything. Next time I will add more Sherry as I really the flavor and felt 2T just wasn't enough. I had never cooked with unsalted butter before, either, pleasantly surprised! I will definitely make it again!

This recipe is pretty good, lots of flavour and very easy to make. I made it 100% according to the recipe and I would absolutely make this again. It was a great way to use up all the extra onions I had accumulated.

Followed the recipe mostly except after reading reviews cut the butter down to 4 tablespoons and no olive oil. Also just used a pinch of thyme. I used 2 sweet onions and 2 yellow onions and it took about an hour to get the onions nice and caramelized at low heat. Made my own croutons out of old French bread. It was really good and easy too!

This turned out really delicious!! I made a few changes as recommended... I carmelized the onions, I used 3 cans beef broth and 1 can beef consommé for a richer flavor. I simmered it for a little over 30 minutes. Added Trader Joe’s Onion Salt during final taste test and it was awesome! I added fresh Asiago and slice of Swiss cheese and baked it. Love loved it! Super easy, so tasty!

I used low sodium beef broth and yellow onions because I had a big surplus of those onions. It was great!  My husband ate 2 servings. I will be making this again.

My daughter loves French onion soup, but she has celiac disease so we don't order this when out.  I made it with gluten free bread and she loved it!  Will make it again!  Did not know how easy it is to make-and the croutons were to die for!

Delicious just the way it is, however, next time I would cut the oil in half and probably only use 2 tbl. butter. It just doesn’t need so much butter.

This soup was delicious and a big hit with my wife and daughters.
I did not have oven proof bowls so we broiled the French bread and cheeses for 5 minutes to a golden brown then put it in the individual bowls of soup.

Okay - I'm rating this "as written" - the flavor is not where it should be - why?  because why would you not caramelize the onions?  The depth of flavor gained by this one simple step makes all the difference.  Here's what I suggest to bring this to 4 stars:  Be sure to caramelize those onions - and you may want to ramp that up with about 2 more cups of onions because they will cook down.  I'd use about half the butter because the cheese has a lot of fat in it.  Otherwise it's an ok recipe.  The changes I've suggested will make it better.

So simple and delicious, tasted great before adding the dry Sherry. The dry Sherry calmed the sweetness down a bit which made it perfect.

WAY to much Thyme. Whole family felt like we were eating spoonfuls of Thyme.  It even sure that the home should be used at all. 40+ yrs of eating French onion soup at restaurants and don’t recall ever seeing Thyme floating around. And don’t brown the onions??

I added sage to taste, and season all to taste, and added a dollop of sour cream to the bowl without using the broiler, as well as the cheese. Also made cornbread to try with it. YUMMY!

I used salted butter instead of unsalted. I caramelized the onions, omitted the sherry, and added two bay leaves. I also substituted mozzarella for the provolone cheese. At the end I sliced french bread, placed it in a casserole, poured the soup on top, covered with the cheese and broiled for 5 minutes. It was a HUGE hit!

Good solid flavor. Not as good as restaurant richness.  I used College Inn Bold Beef broth, Fairbanks California Sherry, Smart Balance Original for butter and followed the recipe as written. For us, it had a tad too much thyme.  I will keep experimenting to find that extra richness we were looking for. I have used Smart Balance for other recipes and find that it is an excellent substitute for butter that lowers the fat without sacrificing flavor.

This is such an easy recipe. I changed it to six servings so my measurements are different than what is written. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added a tablespoon of worcestershire and I also added a  heaping teaspoon of better than bouillon beef flavor and I have to say that this is as good as any I have had at the finest of restaurants.

This is a simple recipe indeed, but as others have said, it needs some modification to be really delicious.  I carmelized the onions and added a little flour to them to give the soup some body.

I used half the butter and oil and it still turned out nice and rich.  (And, maybe start out with 1/2 the thyme?  It was a little strong for me.)  I also added another cup of onions that I sauteed and pureed before adding to the pot.  I would definitely make it again.  FYI, I did use the sherry.

I changed a few things in the recipe but it was fantastic. I made my version vegan, I only put in 2 table spoons of vegan butter, I only put in 1 table spoon of olive oil and I put 3 table spoons of sherry. I also caramelized my onions. It was lovely ??

Best french onion soup I have ever made did not change anything except left the bread out.  Perfect for a rainy night.  Also had to use dry white wine instead of sherry turned out perfect.  This one is a keeper!!!!

This was not a recipe that matched my acquired taste for what I'd consider excellent french onion soup. It had too much butter and also advised not browning the onions, something many other recipes encourage in order to obtain the best flavor.  Otherwise, while palatable enough it did not meet my palates expectations.

I made this  for my boyfriend and I one day for dinner. I was very excited because the recipe was so simple! It was amazing. Though, I highly recommend you caramalize the onions for a long period of time...just leaving them translucent makes no sense to me! Otherwise, AMAZING dish, if you are thinking of using this recipe DO IT !

Delicious! I made two minor changes. I did not add the sherry because I had none and I added only gruyere as this is my favorite cheese. Super easy and tasty. I will be making this again. Thank you.

I used 2 slices of mozerella cheese, one on top of the soup under the bread and one on top of the bread. I used the top on an onion roll lightly toasted. It far exceeded my expectations! I've already made it 2 more times.  I will never buy it from Applebee's again.

Very good recipe, but I agree with other reviewers, you definitely want to carmelize the onions.  I didn't add any salt, due to the saltiness from all the cheeses, and, although I love black pepper, I didn't add that either.  I enjoyed this soup and will make again.

I made this soup for New Years Day and it was really good. I did use more onions(my husband is a onion fiend) and some additional broth for me. I did cut back the thyme to about 1 tsp and added no salt. I did cook the onions a little more but not much and used cream sherry instead of cooking sherry and it made it slightly sweet and amazing. I also added some Worcestershire sauce  for an added kick(stole the idea from one of the other commenters). But the biggest change was I used my crock pot. The onions ended up flavorful and buttery and the broth was deep flavored and yummy. Am already planning to make again.

Opted for only butter, no olive oil. Other than that exactly as described. Excellent.

Can't agree more.  Simple and tastes spot on.  Translucent onions versus caramelized is way better for bringing out the best in the flavor of the onions.  I love caramelized onions, but the soup, the translucent seem to be a better way to go.  I am also a garlic fanatic and am surprised how well this tastes without garlic anything.   Thank you for sharing this recipe.

OMG! We lived in Germany and then Holland many yeats ago. This recipe is spot on compared to our memories while on tours while in Europe. 

I did not have the Sherry, so that was obviously omitted. My provolone was thin, so did 2 pieces in each bowl. Also, my hubby will only eat the soup if I strain out most of the onions, lol. So, I strained onions out for him, the taste wasn't changed.

Thanks for the wonderful memories this recalled.

Easy to make! Instant favorite! The sherry and thyme are the key ingredients and the mixture of cheese is devine. I made this exactly as written with broth and I've made it with stock. The stock makes it a bit more flavorful but great both ways! Super easy to make more or less servings.

It’s amazing how easy it is to make this delicious soup. I followed the recipe but made 8 cups instead and added 4 tablespoons of Sherry for added flavour. My Wife loved it so much that she told me from now on I have to make this French Onion Soup at least twice a month, I have no problem with that. Great Recipe ????

I added about 1 teaspoon of sugar about half way through while browning the onions . After they were completely browned I added two cloves of garlic finely chopped.

I've never been much of a french onion soup fan but made it for my boyfriend who is. Oh my god, I'm a fan now - this recipe is delicious! Following other reviews, I added 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and half the amount of butter. I carmelized the onion to a golden brown, the flavor is savoury and sweet. I've made it twice now, and both times we squabbled for the leftovers!

This recipe was very delicious. The multi-gen family liked it . i used Gruyere instead of Provolone. I got a reasonably priced one at Trader Joe's. And I used stock I had frozen on hand from a crockpot chuck roast recipe made a week ago.

Absolutely disgusting. There is just way too much butter. Once it was simmered and ready to eat, you could see the butter on top, and it had a strong buttery flavor. The thyme also overpowered the original beef flavor of French onion soup. Overall, would not recommend. It would be way easier to buy a premade one.

First time making any kind of soup from a recipe. This French onion soup tastes similar to that I’ve had at fancy restaurants. It’s  so easy to follow. I didn’t have all the types of cheeses mentioned so I just used slices of toast covered with Colby jack and shredded pecorino. Delish!

It was the most Delicious French Onion Soup I have ever eaten!!!!   If I could, I would  give this 10 stars.  It was simple and inexpensive to make and it was far better than the French Onion Soup I recently ate at the most expensive and famous restaurant in New York City.

It was amazing as is. But after making it a few times I added almost half a cup of red wine, an extra beef bullion cube, and I add 1 meatball into each cup (fully cooked of course).

The onions need to be fully caramelized, and need to be cooked for like an hour before the broth goes in.

Followed bulk of recipe except for 1) browned the onions, 2)  the cheeses: used  Gruyere and Provolone, and a sprinkle of Parmesan.    Very easy and yummy.

Made this exactly as written, other than browning the onions a bit. This is really a decent, easy recipe for french onion soup. My only complaint is I felt there was way too much butter and oil. Some spoonfuls from the top of the bowl were literally like eating a spoonful of melted butter. Once refrigerated, you could really see how much there was as it collected and hardened on the top. I'd use half the amount of butter in the recipe, or even less, and probably leave out the olive oil altogether. Otherwise, a fine recipe!

Everyone in my finicky family loved this soup. I didn't have sherry so I substituted 2T red wine vinegar with a pinch of sugar. Quick easy and inexpensive... But it looks like something out of a classy French bistro.

Really loved the soup!!  I did read through the comments, and made a few suggested adjustments. Used all butter with no oil; browned the onions, increased sherry to 1/4 C; added 1 tbs Worcestershire sauce; and topped with Swiss and Gruyere.  Definitely will make again and again!

Really, really excellent! I will never buy  canned French Onion soup again. Ever. I did cook the onions to a golden brown. And since I didn't have sherry I used a red merlot.  And just a little thyme, since I wasn't sure how that would taste. This is a keeper! Thank you, Lori!!

This incredibly simple recipe turns out amazing. The hardest part of making this soup was cutting the onions. I used a sweet onion, a red, and a yellow. The flavors married up beautifully. I did slightly caramelize the onions because that is a personal preference. This will be a frequent winter fare in our home.

Way too much thyme.    Also, I didn’t brown the onions per the recipe.  The onions were too fragrant and the texture of them were just too crunchy.  I would def brown the next time for texture and flavor.  French onion is a favorite of mine but won’t be making this one again.

I think this is a great recipe! I would keep the onions at a golden brown. After the simmer and broil they will be perfect. Also I added a touch of garlic (after trying recipe verbatim.) Maybe a teaspoon finely minced. The difference is incredible.

I have made this twice, the first time using some butter along with the olive oil as in recipe ( I didn't use as much as called for, about half) and the second time without any butter, just enough olive oil to cover the onions.  Both were good, I liked it the second time better without all that butter.  Healthier that way too.  I don't even do the bread and cheese atop it, weird to some maybe but I like it just the way it is.  Sometimes with a piece of toast or English muffin on the side. I used medium yellow onions.   Also, I didn't have sherry either time so left it out and didn't use a substitute. Seasoned to taste with salt and pepper.  Maybe the next time I'll try browning the onions or letting them get a bit darker. Thanks!

I just returned from Quebec...and we tried many versions of French Onion Soup throughout the province, besides the fact that I have travelled extensively, tasting FOS in many capital cities.  Sorry to say, I would not put this at the top of my list.  I prepared a version in Montreal at a friend's house, based on one of her cookbooks, that was superb in comparison.

It was mostly good, but I would recommend cutting the amount of butter in half. That seemed like way too much to me.

I also would not listen to the instruction to not carmelize (or "brown") the onions. It's commonplace to carmelize onions for onion soup-- that's just part of what makes it onion soup. To not carmelize them, it would taste too "raw". Definitely brown the onions.

With those changes, the soup should be fine-- maybe even more than fine. It could use maybe a little garlic, but that's to anyone's preference.

I LOVE this soup!  It's wonderful!  I caramelized the onions, used Merlot instead of the sherry, added 2 dashes of Worcestershire, and I used a little bit of flour & 1 tsp. of crushed garlic on my onions when they were finishing cooking.   
I double the recipe because I love it so much!  But I still only use the 1 stick of butter and 2 tbsp. of olive oil!

This was my first attempt at French Onion Soup, and it was great!  I did make a few changes because I forgot to check my cupboard before going to the store. Instead of Thyme, I used 1/2 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp basil.  I did not add the sherry - I'm not a big fan - and I used a garlic sea salt/pepper blend instead of straight salt and pepper. I wasn't able to find sweet onions, so just used yellow onions, and they were amazing as well.

I reheated left overs two days later, and it was even better than the first time around! I will DEFINITELY make this again!

added 1 bay leaf and replaced sherry with Pinot Noir.  Out of this world.  Would 1/4 lb of butter have achieved the same goal.

RAVE reviews!
I did make some changes though. I caramelized my onions to give it that savory sweetness and omitted the sherry altogether. It turned out DELICIOUS....I know, because my hubby can't seem to get enough. This soup has become a regular on the menu in our home. Thanks so much for sharing!

Did some things different and it tastes just like a soup from Water Valley Inn Restaurant in Hamburg NY.  Before then I couldn't find ANYTHING in comparison.  Here's the deal....Use Red onions...I know that sounds weird but they are not as strong.  Add 1 packet of Lipton's French Onion Soup Mix and add about 1 Tbs of "Better than bullion" beef base.  I cannot over state enough how absolutely delicious this is. I always caramelized the onions before but then disliked the sweet taste that it lent to the soup.   Not to caramelize seemed sacrilege but it was brilliant!

Easy and Great! Made some changes due to what was available. We had made caramelized onions in the crock pot already so just added them o the broth. Also no Thyme so used fine herbs. Swiss cheese. Port instead of Sherry. Garlic Bread.  Some parsley flakes as garnish. Worked out great and was really easy. Will make it again.

What a great and simple recipe!  I have a strong palette for flavors and the simplicity of this recipe is just perfect. I did omit the sherry since I don't like alcohol in general, and I used salted butter, cuz well, I love salt. It wasn't missing a thing or overly salty (I still had to put salt and pepper in it for seasoning.)  Man oh man is this AWESOME!

Great recipe!  However, watch the strength of your thyme and adjust accordingly; especially important if you are not "wild" about thyme.  My thyme must have been very strong because I used 1/2 teaspoon and the soup still had a strong thyme flavor.  Like others, I caramelized the onions and also used a beef stock paste (brand used: Better Than Bouillon) to enhance the watery beef broth.  This recipe delivers a delicious onion soup. Thanks, Lori!

It seemed like a good and easy recipe, I followed everything exact I even caramelized the onions like some of the reviewers said. But after it was done it was very sweet?? It did not taste like French onion soup to me, can someone tell me what I did wrong and how to fix it? I would really appreciate it thank you!

Great recipe but the 1 tsp of thyme is a bit much in my opinion.  Going to try it again with 1/2 tsp to see if that makes a difference.  I'd rather taste more onion than spice.

I am a huge fan of a GOOD French onion soup.  This is a GOOD one!!  I used sweet vadalia onions and condensed beef broth.  The condensed broth makes it much richer tasting like the restaurant's.  Did not add the sherry.  Used about a half cup of Cabernet wine instead.   I toasted the french bread first as well.
Will make again.

This recipe is great however I made a few adjustments.   I caramelized the onions, when you do this, it make the flavor intense. I also used burgundy wine which is so good. I used a little when caramelize the onions, and pUT it in when I added the beef broth. I didn't use thyme..I hate it..don't need it. I love allrecipes because it uses simple ingredients. With cooking you have to use the kiss method...keep it simple stupid!..lol..when I put it in the oven I used Monterey jack cheese. I cut that off the block. This cheese just loves to be melted. This recipe is so good. Just tweak it to suit your palate. Just don't stray too much..tweak.

This soup had great flavor but was way too greasy. It was unappetizing to see how much floated to the top after I broke through the cheese. Next time, I'll cut way back on it and I think this will be a keeper!

This is a great basic recipe. I didn't make many changes, but I did just a few:
Caramelized the onions
Added a dash of Worcestershire sauce
Great flavor easy recipe, and with the bread and cheese it tasted like a restaurant french onion. Thanks!

This is a delicious French onion soup recipe! Although no changes are needed i did replace the french bread for large croutons and added crispy onions on top, right before serving. The crispy onions were found next to the croutons so i went for it.

I didn't make any changes and loved it.  If I were to make any, I would leave out the cheese.  It was a lot to handle and the soup would taste just as good on its own.

Do you ever have one of those days when the Universe just gangs up on your cooking?

All over Xmas I've been saying to my Franco-Italian fiance: 'keep that last little piece of Gruyere, I'll make you a French Onion soup.

I did make a mess of transferring the American measures to European I think, but spotted it early enough to compensate.

As we're into end of Xmas cupboard nearly bare, there were a couple of sustitutions:
* Hadn't any Parmesan, so mixed in Extra Mature Cheddar.
* Hadn't any sherry or similar left (Thanks to another large batch of tomato soup last week, not just random boozing I hasten to add  ).
* Grabbed my herbs on the go and a sprig of dill got mixed in with the thyme.
* Since we've been poorly and not cooked the last few weeks, I didn't have any beef stock to hand, so broke out the emergency OXO. For one bag of supermarket elderly onions, I used two beef OXO to four pints water and went a touch lighter than normal on the salt seasoning.

Himself pronounced it delicious and has squirreled some of  the Gruyere so he can have it just the same for tomorrow lunch (High praise from the Frenchy).

I'm guessing that after tonight's dinner, I probably  have aprrox 6 decent portions - two for tomorrow and four for the freezer.

Used shredded sharp cheddar as the third cheese and spiced it up with chili flakes. Also increase the amount of onions by a third. Next iteration I plan  to increase onions further.

I know the sherry is optional but it makes a huge difference in taste, even just using the cooking kind. It also deglazes all of those nice flavors at the bottom of the pot. I add it after the onions are done cooking and before adding the broth. Make sure to carmelize your onions, its worth the time. I also add a little rosemary, had it like that in a restaurant and it compliments the beef flavor nicely.

Very good and easy to make. Only reason it wasn't five stars is the teaspoon of thyme was a bit of overkill. Maybe half a teaspoon of ground thyme would be better, would give it a nice flavor without overpowering the onions or giving you little bits of thyme leaf in your silky soup.

Simple and delicious!  Followed as close as my none measuring skills wld take me and it brought on my happy dance when done. I did use half low sodium stock, and red wine instead of sherry (none in house).  Those were my only changes. Thanks again. I can't wait to make again!

It's true ... this is REALLY good and so easy!  Will definitely make it again but will cut the Thyme to a "dash".

I made this for my family and even my super picky daughter liked it. The recipe is very simple and easy to make. Most of the time is spend simmering the soup. I would recommend using less butter when caramelizing the onions. Half a cup seems to be a bit excessive.

Sorry. I don't understand how this recipe has gotten so many 5-star ratings. The onions, while good, are not what you would use for French Onion Soup. Considering this recipe messes up 1 of 2 ingredients that are absolutely essential, this is a big, fat 0. Honestly, they didn't even mention that you HAVE to use low-sodium beef broth because it should thicken up over time a tad and you already have to add salt to the onions to caramelize them. Completely change the recipe, and THEN I could see it getting 5 stars. But until then . . . Idk what this lady's friends are on, but I want some of it.

I omitted olive oil
Sautéed 4 yellow onions sliced on mandolin
low to med-low covered in large frying pan, stirring now and then for over an hour.
Added 2 tbl sherry, thyme and a little 
worstchestere  sauce instead of salt and little pepper and sauteed golden onions with one large box of beef stock and one small (kitchen basics).
Simmered for an hour.
Ladled into bowls, topped with low-fat , lactose free swiss cheese and parmesan,  added stale toasted sourdough bread cubes on top and microwaved till cheese was melted, 3-4 min.
Wonderful?.
Recipe here makes about 4 cups of soup.I ate two for lunch!!
  Note:  After  simmering and cooling, i skimmed off butter fat before serving.      loiscongdon

I used a butter infused olive oil and i did caramelize the onions, it was very easy and very good, as good as I've ever had in a restaurant. You can also use croutons instead of the french bread and it works just the same.  I will definitely make again and again, especially for having with guests.

The ratios are all off. Way to much onions and butter for such a small quantity of broth. You'll wind up with a small quantity of separated soup and a heaping pile of onions.

Delicious! The hint of the sherry and thyme really shine. I chose this particular recipe because it didn't contain flour or sugar--2 no-no's for a wheat intolerant diabetic. With that being said, I made this without the crouton ( no GF bread in the house) and it was divine and I didn't feel a bit cheated.

Fantastic! We made it without the bread and cheese. It is spectacular without them. The only thing I changed was adding a 3rd tablespoon of the sherry. (It was all that was left in the bottle.) The only thing I would try next time, is adding less butter. It seemed to just be too much butter,  a bit excessive, health wise. I will double the recipe next time.

This recipe completely misses the mark because the onions are just cooked  until translucent and not browned....caramelized onions are what make French onion soup FRENCH ONION SOUP! It's missing so much flavor!

This French Onion soup was very good. I sautéed  a handful of the onions  until they were browned to bring out a deeper flavor, then cooked the rest of the onions until translucent.  Loved it!

I love this soup overall. I can probably live without the sherry or red wine as I've seen red wine is an alternative but I like it to taste more of the beef broth. I've also thought of using vegetarian stock. I didn't add the time but and I like it with extra onions. It came out really delicious just like in restaurants I've had.

Best French onion recipe ever.  However, I also Carmelized my onions and I added fresh thyme instead of dried.  I would recommend a lot more than 4 cups of onions for 4 servings.  I'd say 3 large onions would be good.  So good!

This is a great recipe!  I do prefer sherry to white wine that other recipes use, but after making it this way, I would add a little more sherry to enhance the flavor.  It was very delicious!  I did use the swiss & provolone; however I have made this soup using mozzarella as well.  Whatever cheese you have on hand that will melt well would work.  Definitely added to my recipes on this site.

This was very easy and very good. I give it 5 stars with the changes I made.  I did carmelize the onions  which I do like and suggest.  I also toasted my bread and melted the cheese on top of the bread and added more on top of the soup. The cheese i used was what  I had on hand which was white cheddar and grated cheese.  I will definitely make this again!

This soup was awesome!!  I followed the recipe exactly with exception of adding 2 tablespoons of worschester sauce.  My family thought this was the BEST French onion soup they've ever had.  This recipe will be a keeper on my winter meal menu.

I have made this soup many times - it's easy and delicious.  The only change I make, is to add a little more sherry (1/4 to /2 cup) and make more servings.  Absolutely wonderful - truly a 5 star soup!!!

I tried it this way just to see if you can really get away with paring the cooking time way down, and it just isn't the same as when the onions are truly cooked for fine taste. I agree with some of the other posters that caramelizing the onions--and yes, they will turn a VERY deep brown-- makes all the difference in both flavor and texture. You need to cook longer.  I usually use red wine but I found sherry works just as well to enhance the taste. Julia Child used cognac, so I just might try it the next time I have it on hand.  I felt than another reviewer of this had a great idea by trying Gruyere. No doubt many cheeses would work well.

Simple and easy to make.  It tasted just like the better restaurant versions.  I must say that I caramelized the onions.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  Surprisingly filling.

Overall, the flavor of this soup was good, and making it was very easy.  The one thing I didn't like was the amount of butter, next time I will only use 4 TBSP.  I used cooking wine in place of the sherry.

I pretty much followed the recipe and only found it okay at best.  I used about 1/3c. Butter and I'd use less next time since it tasted too buttery/oily. You likely need 1/4c. or less. I caramelized the onions, which I liked. I also added 2 tsp. Worchestershire sauce and 1 beef bouillon cube and STILL found the flavor to be bland! I liked making the bread  with shredded Gruyere & Parmesan cheese. However, I liked them when I toasted them before and  I broiled them for 3-4 minutes outside of the soup in the oven. The ones that I put in with the soup still came out kinda soggy.

I added one beef bouillon cube.  (Also, I left it in the crock pot for 6-7 hours on low).  When I tasted it  I thought it was a little bland.  Though when finished, it was great, with a salty taste, so if you do not like salt, you may find this a bit much.

This soup is absolutely amazing! My husband was raving about it! He said, "This one is a definite keeper!"  I took the advice of previous reviewers:
1. Skip the sherry
2. Keep the butter
3. The more onions the better!

Carmelized - browned - onions are the foundation of French Onion Soup.  Other than that, this is a nice foundation recipe.

REALLY GOOD well worth making again,,,does need tweaking though. DO NOT SALT I doubled ,,,8 cans of 
broth. Salty cans ,,,next time I think 6 cans and 2cups
or cans of water. Check and decide about salt. Watch the butter,,,a little less would be good.

I'm giving this a 5 because I think if I had followed the exact recipe and would not have browned the onions it would have been a lot better! I know that sounds silly but I did like the soup with the onions browned, it just made it a little to sweet for me. I'm not a huge fan of that much sweet, especially on onion soup, so next time I'm not browning the onions!

This recipe is the bomb!..along with the suggestions from the reviews!  Definitely caramelize your onions first, toast your sourdough before adding, and a splash of cognac at the end.  Voila!...oh, and thanks for the recipe.  Cudos, Ms. Levin!

This recipe is fantastic as long as you caramelize the onions. I found that no matter what you do to the bread it turns soggy, so I put the bread on the side and use it to dip. The soup is way too hot anyways so the bread allows you to start eating without burning your mouth.

I was not as impressed with the soup. Sure, it's beefy and has a good onion flavor, but there are a few key steps missed in the direction thats ABSOLUTELY make a great french onion soup. First and foremost, you must carmelize the onions. To speed this along, I usually throw a teaspoon of sugar into the onions after they've turned translucent. Secondly, deglazing the pan. You don't have to use wine, if you don't have it, but using a little chicken broth to deglaze the pan and scrape all the toasty bits off the pan will help tremendously in developing a rich flavor. These things take seconds and will not add significantly to the amount of time it takes to churn out a good french onion soup. Finally, the provolone adds nothing....except for allowing you to add gobs of extra cheese on a budget. The best choice is a gruyere or swiss. The longer it is aged, the better. I agree, you can add some parmesan to add that saltiness you get from a good aged cheese, but parm is just as expensive. All-in-all, I would say this soup was OK, and comparable to the soup you can buy in the can, but I've had better homemade.

I made this tonight for my husband and he absolutely loved it. My neighbor came by and tried it and devoured it. I followed the recipe to a  "t" and was told don't change a thing. This is becoming a staple recipe for week night dinners. It really only took about an hour to make from start to finish and was so easy. If you like French onion soup, give it a try. You will not be disappointed!

Simple recipe and very good. I used a vegetable broth base and only used the Swiss cheese. Definitely use the sherry. I also halved the recipe and it was still so delicious. I would cut the butter a bit next time, but otherwise it's a keeper.

Oh MY!!!!  I have never reviewed - this is wonderful. Carmelize the onions.  I have never attempted French Onion Soup at home, it is so easy and delicious.  Just an idea, when I was young we had very little, my Mom would make FOS and crack an egg into it so it was a "complete" meal.  Thank you!

Excellent and EASY!  I do not cook a lot, but managed to not mess this one up.  I followed other suggestions and added another beef bouillon cube, and two tbspn of worsteshire.  I also used red merlot in place of the sherry.  I browned the onions a little, but did not slice them up real thin either.  Will definitely save this and make again. Oh, and I left out the thyme.

I enjoyed making this recipe for my husband, who loves French Onion soup.  I increased the sherry to about 1/2 cup for personal preference, but followed all other directions to the letter.  Great recipe!

Great recipe!

Also: Recipes, such as this one, can be made with a combination of beef and chicken broth. The think is that yellow onions are best, but red, or a combination of the two (more yellow than red) could be used. A bay leaf can also be a good bit of flavor.

This was excellent. I did carmelize the onions for added flavor.  I used progresso beef stock. I aloso happened to have 1/4 stick of garlic herb butter laying around so I threw that it.  Very easy. Very Good.

Caramelizing the onions is a must for this recipe. Next time I would cut the thyme to 1/2 TSP and add 1/4 TSP of parsley.

Best French onion soup with a few modifications.  I do not like thyme, so I took that and the swiss cheese out, and I added 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce.  Makes this recipe unbeatable!

Wow do we ever love this.  I cook it every fortnight for my family.  The boys especially love the bread with baked cheese on top.  We never have swiss or provolone, so we use mozza. Parmesan is a must though!

I made this for dinner last night and it was a hit!  I made my beef broth with beef buillion and water...I added a little extra buillion to give it some extra flavor and about a cup or so of red wine (I tend to "eye ball" instead of measure!).  It was perfect!  I will definitely be making this again!!

A month ago I had the most amazing French onion soup at a incredible french resturant in New York. I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. I would have a hard time claiming the Frech resturant's recipe beat this one.This is incredible and will be the only recipe I use going forward.

I made this for my Project Runway finally party. My guests LOVED it. Someone brought a nice red wine so I threw some of it in as well. It made only 6 mug size servings which was perfect but I was wishing for more the next day! I caramelized the onions which took about 40 mins then used red wine to scrape up all of the brown bits in the pan before adding the rest of the liquid. I had to use Swiss cheese and it was wonderful. Be sure to toast your bread. I put slices of rustic bread in the toaster then right before adding it to the soup, I stuck it back in the toaster to crisp it up even more. THIS IS A KEEPER!

This soup is delicious!  Like some of the other reviewers, i was a little surprised that the recipe says to not let the onions brown...i DEFINITELY recommend browning them! This was soooo delicious and easy to make! if you want to splurge a little, try gruyere cheese.  The provolone and parmesan are still good but gruyere makes it a little more special!

I love French Onion soup and searched awhile before selecting a recipe.  This was perfect.  I used large white onions and cut out all of the butter.  I don't know what it tastes like with the butter, but it was awesome without it.  I froze half of it and look forward to making this often!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic recipe.  Simple, Quick and great tasting.  I love French Onion soup and have only before had it at dinner out so it was my first time making it.  Was also pretty cheap to make considering it costs $7 a bowl here.  I followed the recipe pretty much exact. I used though 1 white onion and 1 vidale onion.  I did brown the onions.  I also got some jalapeno/cheese rolls from our local bakery guy for very cheap at the market so I cut those up into croutons and cooked them until they were a little crisp.   Amazing!

This is my first attempt at making french onion soup and this was the perfect recipe for a newbe!! It was so easy to follow! However when I doubled the recipe I should have known not to double the butter!! I used salted butter and added a little dried dill and it turned out amazing! Thanks Lori! Great soup!

This turned out great.  It was so easy.  I toasted the frend bread before putting in the soup and topped with swiss cheese and gruyere cheese.  Had a restaurant quality flavor to it.  Served it on Valentines Day for whole family.

This soup is awesome!  It is so simple and tastes restaurant quality.  No changes to recipe -- it is perfect the way it is.  Other French Onion soup recipes are much more complicated, but don't bother because this one is fantastic.

I changed this so much I don't know if I SHOULD rate this one.  What I ended up with was awesome though!  I used 1 T butter, 3 T olive oil and the onions.  I cooked them, covered on med heat for 30 minutes.  Uncovered it and added 1 tsp sugar and salt and cooked them for another 15-20 minutes.  Added about 4 cups of broth and thyme.  Simmered for 15 minutes.  I didn't have broiler-proof bowls, so I toasted the bread and cheese (mozzarella and parmagiano).  Ladled out the soup and topped it with the bread!  Fantastic!!

If french onion soup is on the menu at a returant I order it every time.  I can honestly say that I will never have to go out for french onion soup again.  I loved it.  On Valentine's day I made it for my husband who never had it before.  It is safe to say this will be a staple soup in our house.

Very good! I've never had or made French Onion soup, so I was a little blind as to how it all should taste. I "doctored" it up a little after reading the reviews. I added a little garlic toward the end of the sauteing time of the onions. Then I sprinkled a little flour on the onion mixture. After adding the onions to the broth, I added a touch of Worchester Sauce and Kitchen Bouquet and simmered for 30 minutes. I thought it was very good, my husband thought it was great!

All I got to say is WOW! The only thing is you got to brown your onions to get a more intense flavor but other then that, this is better then any soup I would buy!

VERY easy to make! I have not had this soup in years and have never made it! I will definately be making this one again. I made sure the onions were nice and brown before adding the stock and it turned out great! The only complaint was the bread got soggy even after I toasted it.

This was so wonderful.  I think you could decrease the butter and or olive oil though because it was a bit greasy.  I also added a bay leaf because I like the flavor.  This recipe will definitely be a staple in my collection.  Thank you. Very easy to prepare too.

My husband, who never cooks, made this tonight. We both love french onion soup but always agree when its to bland or when the flavor is just not right. This is right up in our favorites for french onion soup. We will definitly be making this often in our house. My In laws were here for dinner as well, and they called my sister in law and told her that this was better than her recipe!!!!

You MUST brown/caramelize the onions!  It takes longer (20 mins) but, it brings out the sweetness of the onions.  You'll love it!

Yum!  I agree that the onions need to be sauteed first just until they start to brown so that's what I did.  Loved the addition of sherry.  Will definitely make again!

I was surprised how good this turned out, especially since I used vegetable stock. I might omit the sherry when making again or use less - I didn't particularly care for the flavour it added. I cooked the onions for quite long, letting them stew in the butter/oil until they were very soft and brown, which I felt was key to getting a rich flavour. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe was a big hit! Following the suggestion of others, I caramelized the onions, which really made the soup. I added a dash of red wine that I had on hand instead of sherry. I also added a dash of Worcestershire, which really gave it a nice kick! I didn't have any Swiss cheese, so I just sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top of lightly toasted French bread (keeps it from getting too soggy too fast in the soup) and added a slice of provolone on top of that. I didn't have enough oven-safe bowls, so placed the bread/cheese directly in the oven on broil and just dropped them into the soup after the cheese was brown and bubbly. My uncle, who was visiting from Canada, absolutely loved it! He thought it was just as good as in a restaurant, if not better! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Delicious!  The soup seemed a bit weak flavor-wise before the bread and cheese were added - but upon sitting down and having a few spoonfuls of the soup? Deee-lic-ious!!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  I made croutons out of crusty bread and used those instead of french bread... I did not use thyme because I didn't have any, and this was still so delicious!  Used a large white onion, 3/4 of a large vidalea, and two small yellow onions... a total of 5 cups.  Cut the butter in half, but next time I will leave it out all together.

I cannot believe how good this tastes considering it has so few ingredients and is so easy.  This is a staple in our house during the winter months.  Fantastic!!

Absolutely delicious and uber easy - even my boys who "hate" onion soup ate it up!  I don't really like to tweak recipes before I rate them but had to this time.  I used a dry red wine instead of sherry (I had it on hand) and added a little beef stock paste for a richer broth (my personal preference).  It is a wonderful soup that my hubby will ask for again and again - I'm even making it for Thanksgiving dinner!  Thanks!!!

This was the first french onion soup that I had ever made myself, and it was very very good. And very quick and easy.  My boyfriend has me make it all the time, and even my brother, who doesn't even like french onion, ate seconds!  This will definately be on our holiday menu!

best french onion soup I have ever had. I did however use many of the suggestions that were recommended. I browned the onions. I covered the pot. I increased the white wine and cooked most of it off before i added the stock. I also added flour and garlic. Phenomenal. Will make again cant wait to use it for a dinner party.

This soup was very good, but I think that the swiss cheese was too much.  It took away from the fabulous flavor of the soup, which is why I only gave this a 4 star.  Otherwise, this soup was awesome!  I am so glad I can make this at home now!

This soup was SO easy to make, I LOVE IT!!  The Parmesan cheese burned a little so I changed the order of the cheese layer and put the parmesan in between the swiss and the provolone!!  Thanks for sharing

The taste of this soup is superb!  Matches if not exceeds restaurant soup.  I've never made French onion soup before so I'm very pleased that it turned out the first time.  I doubled the recipe and made enough to can 6 pints.  Wonderful with croutons and Provolone.

Such an easy and delicious soup!!! I loathe swiss cheese (smells like feet) so I used Provolone instead. Added a little more thyme, I love the flavor, and a bit more sherry. Also I didn't have any french bread so I used ciabatta bread instead. Absolutely fantasitc!!!!

This was very good soup, bearing in mind that I made some changes as many do here. I cooked the onions for as long as I had patience to do so... having never caramelized onions before I didn't know if I was doing it right or starting to burn them. They smelled like onion soup, so I added the broth. I added no salt or pepper since I hadn't sampled the finished soup before... as it happened, it didn't need them. I keep no alcohol in my home so I had to find a substitution. Online cooking sites said orange or pineapple juice made good subtitutes for sherry. I was skeptical but put in what I had... a kids' citrus beverage I won't name just in case. I guess it was fine, because it certainly doesn't taste bad. It tastes like onion soup, huzzah! The only complaint I would make against the actual recipe, outside of the onions not being caramelized in it, is the thyme. There's so much that you could call it Thyme Soup convincingly. I will probably leave it out completely next time since I don't much fancy the spice. Unless you love thyme, it should at least be reduced.

I really liked this but next time, I would cut back on the butter because 1 stick is too much and I had alot of butter/grease swimming at the top. Also next time I would use half stock and half broth for a darker, richer flavor.

This was intensely good and sarisfying! I added 2 tablespoons of flour when I was carmelizing the onions. Letting the onions carmelize causes chemical changes in them which result in better flavor, so I carmelized them which took about 30 minutes. I also added  1 tablespoon of parsley flakes & a tablespoon of pepper.  I ate this with a bread bowl recipe from this site, lining the bottom of the bowl with melted cheese so it wouldn't leak. Perfect and filling, thanks so much!!

I make this soup 8 quarts at a time and only make a few minor changes... I don't use the thyme or olive oil. It seemed to make it too intense and oily with those ingredients added. This is such a simple and delicous recipe, everyone seems to love it.  I vary on the cheeses, I always use swiss but I added provologne or sometimes munster to it. Yum!

This was so good! I had no idea that my favorite soup would be so easy and quick to make! I did make a few changes....I added a pinch of sugar and carmelized the onions, this took about 30 minutes. Then I added garlic powder, white pepper, thyme, bay leaf, and beef broth. Next time I will add an extra can of broth, but that may just be my personal preference. I will be making this on a regular basis!!

Ouch!  The thyme really overpowers this recipe...It's a homerun next time if I add zero thyme and strained the browned onions from the fatty cooking medium before adding to the broth, I'm no expert guys, but I think "carmelized" means to sautee something in sugar....

Great recipe!  Mine was a tiny bit on the bland side...though I attribute it to using a different brand of beef broth than usual.  Pick your broth well, it makes a huge difference in the taste!!!

This soup is so good I am now disappointed with almost all restaurants. I have to agree with others...browning the onions is a must!  I know it takes more time, but the increase in flavor is amazing when the onions are browned to a nice dark caramel color.   I also like to use a combination of red, white and yellow onions. The only other change I made is to skip the provolone cheese, but that is a personal preference.  Another great thing is that the leftovers freeze really well.  Thanks again!

Simple, yes. Rich and flavorful, no. This was fine, but not what I was looking for. Next time I'll try another recipe.

This was really good but I feel it was missing a little something from some of the restaurant ones I have had.  Will definitely make again, though!

Wow!  Delicious!  Simple and rich as the name suggests.  I used fresh thyme (since I had it on hand and didn't want it to go to waste).  I used a bottle of beer in it, too.  :)   The next time I make it I'll probably try it using the olive oil only, no butter.  By the time the cheese melted on the top, the soup got kind of greasy.  But, oh so delicious.  Thanks, Lori!

Very good recipe but this was actually a little too much cheese for me.  I also carmalized the onions but kept everything else as written.  Next time I would cut down on the Thyme as I thought it was a little overwhelming.  Thanks

This recipe is great because you can add and subtract ingredients -- and it will still be great! I usually add some worcestershire sauce and alot of sherry and thyme, because it really makes the soup!  Sometimes I'll make croutons with french bread and monterey steak seasoning and use those in the soup-- it gives it an even more amazing flavor!

Very good base soup! I do like beef flavoring in mine however so I added 4 teaspoons beef base or you can use boulion. I then always add bacon cut in 1" peices to my onion soups.(A tip from my mother inlaw)This one I put 8 oz in (adds so much flavor!) I also added about 5 oz of thin egg noodles. boy does that make the soup a complete meal. I also add croutons on the top of the cheese instead of bread ( We don't care for soggy bread. Thanks for the recipe:)

This was a good start, I adjusted it just a bit.  I added 2 beef bullion cubes, just because it needed more flavor.  I also added a bit of flour to the onions just as they were done browning and deglazed with extra sherry.  I threw in a bay leaf too.  It was a great start to a great dinner!!!  Thanks!!

The soup itself was FANTASTIC.  We did not add the sherry.  I recommend to everyone to omit the bread and cheese.  We placed slices of french bread on top of the soup and cheese (broiled) as directed, but the soup soaked the bread like a sponge.

This was very good.  I used a lot less butter (maybe 3 Tbsp) and probably more bread (diced it - good idea) than called for.  And I used a boullion cube like others recommended.  (I might use 2 next time.)  It was great leftover as well.  My husband loved it too.

Very easy! I loved it! I used margarine instead of butter because it is all I had. I have used canned broth and boulion. Both turned out fine. I actually thought the soup LOOKED better than the picture as well. Try it! Very good!

This soup was just awesome. I used water and beef base instead of canned beef broth, I used more base and then added a touch of chicken base as well. It was to die for.

GREAT RECIPE!  I did use a bit extra bouillon as sugggested for added flavor.  I did NOT add any salt as broth and bouillon have plenty as it is.  Definitely use the butter not margarine and I used vidalia onions because of their sweet taste.  I loved the soup and am making another pot of it as I type this!!

This was not as great as I had expected.  Perhaps, I will try a different brand of broth as mentioned by other users.  I used swanson's certified organic beef broth.

This soup was really good. I didn't have sherry so I substituted it with worcestershire sauce like someone suggested and it turned out just as god as the french onion soup in Bennigan's and T.G.I.Friday's. Another thing I did differently was not broiling the soup. I toasted the bread and sprinkled some cheese on the soup. It melted just the same.

WOW - what a great soup - better than most restuarants.  I used 250ml of chicken stock along with 1 250 ml of Knorr beef broth.  I also used a can of consomme with 1 can of water. I didn't have sherry so didn't use nor the thyme.  I didn't have any french bread so I cut up the end pieces of brown bread in strips and in a food processor I took garlic, parmassean reggiono, basil and olive oil and blended.  Once blended I poured over bread and baked in oven until very crisp.  I added those to the top of soup and added mozza, swiss and parmassean.  Delicious.  I am goint to make tonight but will use the sherry.  Can't wait

I love, love, love this soup!  It's so easy and tastes great.  It has turned me into a French onion soup addict, so I order it frequently at restaurants now.  I've only found a few places that serve a soup that I like as well as this recipe.

This recipe was, in fact, easy. I didn't care for the Thyme flavor and wouldn't add it next time. I did add the sherry and liked the flavor of that. I had to make my own broth so I added 2 extra boullion. 1 per cup of liquid was not flavorful enough. Probably would have been fine if I had used regular cans of beef broth. We did like this recipe and would make it again. I made a steak caesar salad to go with it and it made a wonderful meal.

I was looking for a great French Onion Soup recipe and found it in the first one I tried.
This soup turned out just as I had hoped. I had to skip the sherry (none to be found in the house) but could tell that it would be welcome in the next batch. EXCELENT

I don't know whether I did something wrong, but this soup did not turn out for me at all. The oil and butter separated a lot from the broth, making it kind of greasy on top without much flavor. I think the recipe may depend a lot on the quality of the beef broth you use. I'm not sure, but it turned out pretty disgusting for me. My husband and I ate a few bites before he stopped me and said, "Let's get takeout."

Very, very yummy. I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe to add a clove or 2 of garlic.  My husband loves French Onion soup, but is picky about where he has it and thought that this was by far the best he had ever had.  Also it was very, very easy.  My only problem was the bread but that is always my problem with French Onion soup.  How do you eat soggy bread?

Great recipe! The broth turned out tasting just the way we like it. I didn't have any provolone cheese on hand so I substituted mozzarella and still came out great. Also a snap to make. Simply... Yummy!! Thanks you for sharing.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for and tasted just as everyone had expected it to taste. Our friend is a master chef and he loved it as well as the rest of us. We did make one change and that was we broiled gruyere cheese on top rather than both the parmesean and swiss cheeses called for in the recipe. Absolutely wonderful soup!

Made this for a holiday party. Served in wide-mouth mugs. It was so delicious. I'll bet the sherry makes a big difference but as we don't consume alcohol, I left it out. Everyone really complimented me on this soup.

I was a little disappointed. Despite using expensive, good-quality beef broth - and also adding a beef bouillon cube - it really wasn't beefy enough. The thyme was too over-powering. The bread was horribly soggy. I would try it again with adjustments, and definitely toast the bread and cheese separately.

This was a very good soup, but we found it a tad too rich...just a matter of palate, though.  The kind of thing that you love at the beginning and then OD on if you eat too much!  We did try to add a bit of water lighten it up a bit!

This soup was to DIE for!  I used white onions (it didn't specify in the recipe so I just guessed), no sherry, and on top of the diced swiss cheese/provolone/parmasean mixture I added a thin slice of baby swiss cheese.  I can't tell you how easy this recipe was.  My husband even made his brother come over to have a bowl because of how good he thought it was!  I've never made soup before and this was a great first recipe to use.  Thanks so much, Lori!

I love French Onion soup and get it in restaurants all the time. The canned kind is never as good, and I was searching for a good homemade version. This is the simplest one I have found, and a very good one. I've enjoyed it several times! If you're looking for a version with a bit more flavor and are willing to invest a little more work, check epicurious.com...their's has garlic, white wine, Dijon...very flavorful.

This soup was completely bland.
I have no ideal how it got such a high rating.

i really enjoyed this, though i just put mozzarella on top of the soup (no bread as i really don't like soggy bread).  i was worried about the thyme too as it smelled really strong when it was first put in but after the 30 minutes it was fine.
the only thing was that the soup looked really greasy (didn't taste too horribly greasy though) because of all the butter and after being in the fridge there was a huge film of grease on top that i had to skim off.
it IS a very rich soup.

I could never understand why people would make soup when they could just as easily buy it, until now. This was so easy and sooo good. I ran out of beef broth so I used chicken and it still turned out wonderful.

Excellent!  I was worried about the tyme, but it added superb flavor.  For quickness, I used garlic butter croutons; which always work well in a pinch.  I also cut back on the butter to make it a bit lighter.  With all the cheese, not sure it made a difference.  Hubby and daughters loved it!  Thanks!

I made this soup for my boyfriend since I know he loves onion soup with lots of cheese. :) I had *never* made onion soup before (i've never had it either!), but this recipe was so easy to follow, and it turned out delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly except i used 1 quart of organic beef-broth (instead of 4 cans) and i used only 2/3 stick butter. And I used 1 huge Vidalia onion (approx 4 cups) which seemed to help with the taste. Anyway, if you know anyone who loves onion soup, make this for them and they will love you forever!! :)

I have been making French onion soup for several years and could never quite get the flavor. This recipe is the best and quite addicting. The only change I made was to increase the sherry to 1/2 cup and add 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. The thyme adds a great flavor.

This was incredibly good...  I scaled it down to one serving one night when I was in the mood for French onion soup.... didn't have any sherry, so used white wine instead (about 1/4 cup).  The only change I'll make next time is to go a little easier on the thyme, just because it's not my favorite spice.  But I do like the addition of thyme in this recipe.  I think that's what's been missing in other recipes I've tried.  Anyway, thanks a lot!

Very good recipe, after it was made I just added more spices to my liking by tasting.  I definately would recommend using more sherry.
I opted to use croutons rather than bread & it worked out wonderful.  Rather than broil the soup to save time, I just put in in the micowave until the cheese melted.

This is great and an easy week night meal. I used one huge yellow onion and one red onion. I cooked the onions and some minced garlic for about 20 min. I then added 1/2 cup of white wine, cooked down a bit, added about 4tsp of flour, then added the beef broth, a dash of worcestershire. Then simmer about 30 min while I did my 5 mile bike ride. Came back and had a wonderful dinner. Did not have thyme so I through in some Essence. This will become a regular on my soup menu. Thanks.

Very good soup. I had made it twice now and I found that I needed to cut back on the thyme (my personal taste) I also skipped the swiss cheese because I didn't have any on hand.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Definitely not the best I've had...will keep this recipe for a guide, but I think the soup needs more flavor.  (Of course, I reduced the oil and butter which could be part of the problem.)

This soup was excellent!  I did use different kinds of onions(yellow, white, and red), and my husband and I couldn't get enough.  I can't wait to make it again.

great, simple recipe. I was actually making this for some chicken. I made it, covered my chicken breasts in it with 1.5 cups of rice and baked for about 45 mins. It was great. I'm looking forward to just trying the soup with some cheese on top.

My friend suggested I try this recipe and I must say, I was not disappointed! It turned out great and I received many compliments on how it tastes even better than most restaurant versions!
I used brandy instead of sherry as I didn't have any on hand, and also used the Kraft shredded Italian cheese blend. I found that adding another tablespoon of brandy added a little extra flavour to an already great recipe.

I have made this several times with rave reviews.  Like others, I add worcestershire sauce as well as toast the bread before broiling soup.  I also omit the swiss cheese and just use sliced, smoked provolone for extra flavor.

This is the best French Onion Soup I've ever made!  The closest thing to what an outstanding restaurant makes. I added some extra onions and also used some sweet onions.
