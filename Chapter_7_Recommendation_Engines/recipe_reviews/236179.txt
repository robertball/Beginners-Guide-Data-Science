Found the recipe AFTER I boiled down the Easter ham bone and removed the meat from the bone.  So I used the ham broth created in the cook down, instead of chicken broth. Gave it a little extra ham flavor. Followed the recipe as written after that. Very tasty split pea soup!

This is the best basic version of split pea soup to make your own additions from. Try adding some cubed potatoes, or rosemary, or cubed ham, or whatever. Go nuts, it would be hard to screw it up too badly.

Fabulous!  I used a ham steak, because that's what I had on hand and a heaping teaspoon of Better than Stock Ham base.  No other changes!  Hubby said it was the best tasting ever.

I made this just as is with one exception:I didn't have any ham sitting around, so I got a pound of thick-sliced smoked ham from the deli, chopped it up, and added it. This came out delicious. I probably could have rinsed the ham, as it's rather salty, but I like that. I also could have used less ham, as I'm frugal and that ended up being a lot of ham.

I used this as a  base for the soup. I did not soak the split peas. I halved the ingredients. I used mostly leaks with a little onion, celery, carrots, and 2 small diced potatoes.  In addition to the spices listed I used some basil and herbes de provdence splice blend. After simmering awhile i added just a little bit of hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce and a splash of  white wine.  I simmered and stirred often for a total of 90 minutes. No salt was added since I added about  12 oz of diced smoked ham. Using a wisk to stir during the last half hour  broke up the potatoes and thickened the soup to a smooth perfections. Just a splash of half and half at the end finished everything off beautifully. This is as comfort food as it gets. Try it and adjust  things as you go. This was really fun to make. Great leftovers for take to work lunch!
