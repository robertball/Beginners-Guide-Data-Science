This is a super easy and tasty recipe.  I use two loaves of thawed sweet bread dough(or even just regular frozen bread dough)cut into walnut sized pieces and add chopped pecans to the butter/pudding/milk mixture. Turns out great every time and is always a hit!

This recipe just about made itself! Very good and super easy! You must serve it warm!! Otherwise it is very hard and gummy. Would make again trying a different pudding to change it up some.

This is a no fail carmel recipe!!  Makes an awesome brunch, dessert, or breakfast.  Perfect for breakfast pot lucks!!  Made a double batch and this hungry family of 5 gobbled the entire thing up in a matter of minutes!
