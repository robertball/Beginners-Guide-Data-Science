After reading others' reviews c/o crumbly-ness, I used 1/2c oat flour and 1/2 c whole wheat pasty flour instead of 1 c oat flour (to get more gluten), and added a little more salt. I haven't had any trouble with them being too crumbly. Will plan to add cinnamon and the usual amount of salt next time. Thanks for a great, fast, healthy breakfast idea! Mine were done at 25min in a convection oven.

I followed the recipe to a "T", including making my own oat flour according to the submitter's note. Baking time was spot on at 35 minutes. Don't skip the optional coconut, it really makes it tasty. These are quite crumbly though, so you will definitely need a fork to eat them. Very good with a cup of coffee. UPDATE: The next day, these were so crumbly, that I found the best way to eat it was to put a square in a bowl, add some milk (I used almond milk) and microwave it until warm, and eat it like a warm bowl of oatmeal.  I also found these to be very filling, and it kept me satisfied until lunch time or later.

I doubled the batch and put them in a 8x13 pan.  They were moist and delicious!  I did not add the walnuts for personal taste reasons.

These are very good. My 2 yo loves blueberries so i always find blueberry recipes, this is a keeper! Its crumbly but as one has suggested to lessen the oat flour and flour, i used the same amount of oats and lessen the oat flour to 1/2 cup, i just took it out of the oven and cooling it down so i havent tried it yet but man does it smell good!

I really did enjoy these bars. Made my own oat flour and in my oven, they were done in 30 minutes.

These are good but very dense and super filling. After chilling I cut into squares (not bars, too big). Family enjoyed them for a quick breakfast or snack. Definitely a recipe that is better the next day.

Followed directions but made my own oat flour and had to use thawed blueberries, fresh would have been even better.  These are fun to make and so delicious.  I doubled the recipe and I am so glad I did; gone, gone,  gone.

This was very good. Not sure I would call them "bars", more like a sort of coffee cake, but very tasty. I made the oat flour myself, very easy. I had pecans,so used them instead of walnuts, as I like them better, anyway. Since I am gluten free at the moment, I would definitely make them again.

Loved these!  I substituted dried blueberries for fresh because that was all I had on hand.  Also used sliced almonds in place of walnuts.  Mixed about 3/4 cup coconut into the batter.  Any ingredients I changed were substituted because that's what I had on hand. I don't have a square pan so I spooned the batter by 1/4 C full into muffin tin and cooked for 10 min.  They came out perfectly, but more like a muffin than a bar.  Nice and moist and should freeze well. Oh and it was easy!  Next time I want to add finely diced apple in place of blueberries.

My family loved this! It was a little crumbly, but we didn't let it cool before eating it.
