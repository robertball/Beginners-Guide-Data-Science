Great recipe!  My husband loves brussels sprouts, so I had him in mind when I chose to make this.  I was hesitant about eating cold brussels sprouts - but they're good!  So easy to make and simple ingredients!  Very yummy - thank you!

Love brussel sprouts, and this is a delicious way to prepare them! I added the chilled brussel sprouts to a bed of chopped spinach, and touched off with a bit of Parmesan cheese. I also used a skillet to get the char on them after boiling them as the recipe instructs. The vinegar and oil mix on them is great!

I used fresh sprouts and canned tomato but rest was as in recipe. The overriding flavor was the cider vinegar. Nothing special as the reviews suggest.

I added shelled edamame and sauted tofu and served on a bed of spinach and arugula as a main course on a hot summer evening
