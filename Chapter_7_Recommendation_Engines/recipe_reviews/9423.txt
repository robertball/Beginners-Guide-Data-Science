I actually made this in a slow cooker while I was preparing other dishes for a party.  Put all the ingredients in a cheesecloth (thick paper towels to make two sacks would work just fine)and tie it with kitchen twine. This method keeps you from having to fish around the ingredients when it is ready to serve.  Slow cook on low for about 4 hours, stirring occasionally. This was so easy to make and the aroma that fills your home while it's cooking is just divine! Thank you!

Do yourself a favor and omit the brown sugar from this recipe.  I have a sweet tooth, but the sugar in this cider is unnecessary.  It left a film on my teeth I can't get off even after brushing twice!

That said, the spices and flavor of the cider were wonderful.  I didn't have any problems with my coffee maker, either.  Although, I think it would be easier to do as others suggested and make it on the stovetop or slow cooker.  I love the orange in it.  Will make again with no added sugar.

I made this recipe in a larg pot on the stove and skipped the step of putting everything throught the coffee maker.  I wish I hadn't skipped that step.  It smelled wonderful while on the stove, and the first few cups were good (or so I was told) but when I finally had a chance to get a cup, it had a very strong flavor.  Maybe the cloves or one of the other spices, but I think if I would have removed all of the spices from the pot after the first 20 minutes, then it would have just kept warm and the flavor wouldn't have been so strong.  I served mine with a dollop of whipped cream on top of each mug.  I will make again, but follow the recipe exactly.

Very good! I made it in the crock pot using a coffee filter and a piece of ribbon to keep the spices in.

What is wrong with my family?  Nobody wanted to even try this unbelievable concoction.  Great!  All the more for me.  How can one drink be refreshing, comforting, spicy, and sweet at the same time?  Somehow, Hot Spiced Cider gits er' done.  This will be traditional Christmas fare for me.  I can see myself rounding up the ingredients for this recipe whenever the snow starts to fly.  I used my slow cooker.  I wrapped the spices in a coffee filter and tied it with a rubberband.  I turned the slow cooker to the "high" setting until it was hot enough, then lowered it to "warm."  I don't particularly enjoy the clove flavor which can be somewhat dominant, so I may reduce or eliminate that spice the next time around.  Still wonderful though.

WAY too sweet as written... be sure to decrease the amount of sugar.  Many people dumped their servings at a recent get together.  I made it in the crockpot and will likely try it again with no sugar.

Excellent!  I love apple cider and this recipe was really easy to make and really good.  I left out the allspice because I don't have any on hand, and also made it on the stove top instead of the coffee maker.  I just put all the spices in a tea strainer and that worked fine.  I like that I can just put this back in the apple cider jug and reheat it as we go!

This was very easy, and very good. I did make this in my coffee maker the first time, and initially thought it worked fine, until my husband tried to use the machine to make coffee. It was clogged with what we believed to be burnt sugar, and he took it apart and spent a lot of time cleaning it before it finally worked again. The next time I made it in a big pot, and that worked fine. I tied the spices up inside a coffee filter. 

I didn't end up using a whole orange (used about half of a huge one), and used ground allspice rather than whole, but followed the recipe other than that.

VERY popular recipe for us!  Like others, I opted for a slow cooker instead of the coffe maker.  Just tossed everything in, set it on low, and let it warm for a few hours.  I cut the brown sugar in half, as I thought it would have enough flavor without more sugar. It was perfect.

Yum! I used less brown sugar (about 1 TBSP  less) and nearly 12 cups of apple cider because we don't like things too sweet, and it was great. We had a little left over, so the next day I warmed up 8 oz. and poured it over a green tea bag. I never enjoyed green tea so much!

I used apple juice instead of apple cider--I grabbed the wrong bottle at the store this week. The oranges I used were clementines, mine were small so I used two. I made this on the stove only because I don't have a regular coffee pot anymore. This is AMAZING. So warm, spicy and comforting. We all just love it. I saved a little in the fridge for tonight to warm up with a little cinnamon whisky. VERY GOOD.

I hosted a Christmas party last night and this was a hit. I made it per the directions in a slow cooker. I bought the least expensive unsweetened cider (in the juice isle).  At first, I did not use the brown sugar per others suggestions after tasting, I deemed it needed it. I have a feeling had I purchased the cold cider for twice the price I would not have needed the sugar. Save yourself the money and buy the inexpensive/unsweetened and add the sugar. FINALLY and this is key have a bottle of BUTTERSCOTCH SNCHAPPS on hand. Guests can add a shot per cup...this was a HUGE HIT! At the end of the evening I poured the remainder back in the jug to use again tonight (Christmas Eve) and I will be certain to add the schnapps to my cup! YUMMY!

This was yummy.  I made it in my crockpot.. put it on high for 3 hours as recommended previously.  I put the spices in the coffee filters and tied them shut with rubber bands, then let them float in with the cider and orange slices.  One thing to note... 2 qts of cider will give you about 6 mugs of cider.  I had to go out and buy another 2 qts for my 12 person party.

WOW!!! I used my coffee maker, and had to make this twice in one night!  The four of us just kept drinking it and drinking it. It was so good. Everything blended so well, I never tasted any one ingredient as overpowering, it was a perfect blend. The only thing was that I washed my entire coffee maker out before and after making this drink. It was worth it! I liked that it was fast and ready, just like a cup of coffee. Encellent!!!!! Thank you so much for this recipe.

Very Good!!!  Doubled the recipe and only used one orange.   Did this in a crock pot and it worked fine.  Just don't leave the spices in too long!

Very awesome! I did my cider in a slow cooker with the spices in a coffee filter hanging in from the edge. Added cinnamon sticks and they were a hit with my Christmas party! The orange was only slightly overpowering for me, but I'm not a huge fan of oranges and everyone else loved it :D

This is as good as the Biltmore House Wassail mix,(which i was having withdrawals from until I found this recipe) Nothing is better on cold winter's night than to snuggle up with along with a good book or movie and a cup of this.

Used a crock pot and borrowed another reviewer's suggestion to bundle the spices in a coffee filter secured with a rubberband. It was delicious, definitely the recipe I'll be using from now on!

This was my first attempt at spiced cider and it turned out fabulous.  I followed the recipe as stated but I did not use the coffee pot.  I put the brown sugar and cider in a pan and heated it to boiling to dissolve the sugar completely.  I poured this into my crockpot.  I tied the spices in a coffee filter as others have suggested and put that along with sliced oranges in the cider.  I turned it to warm about 2 hours before my guests arrived and it was perfect.  I kept the spices and fruit in the cider all evening and I thought the flavor got better and better.  Thanks for a great recipe.

FANTASTIC!!!! It was most definately a big hit. We had extra cider in the fridge so we decided to make this completly last minute for Thanksgiving. Since our coffee pot recently died, we made this on the stovetop and it worked just fine. I also had to substitute ground cinnamon and ground allspice since that is all we had on hand. And then we just lined a strainer with a coffee filter and strained it through that before serving. It was still completely FABULOUS!!! We're making it again for our upcoming holiday party. I'm so glad i finally found a good spiced cider recipe!! :)

Wonderful treat for a snowy night in the 'texas tropics'!  Ü  I have a special coffee maker just for this recipe.  Recipe is great for a party or gathering of friends where you don't to spend time with preparation.  I didn't have whole spices noted, and it worked well with ground form.  ENJOY!  Ü

I used this as a base recipe, however when I made it the second time this fall it was much better. I opted for the slow cooker because I wanted it to keep warm throughout. the second time I left the brown sugar out and subsituded the orange for a lemon...way nice...had a light taste.

I love this recipe!  The aroma is wonderful, it calls for cozy pj's on a snowy night by the fireplace!  Or a festive hot drink at a holiday bash, very versatile.  I use an electric coffee percolator and just put the ingredients in the metal basket.  It works perfect!  No messy coffee pot to have to clean up or degunk.  The whole spices stay in the basket and never float around in the drink.

We made this in a crockpot and drained it before serving and then put it back in the crockpot to keep it warm.  It was incredibly popular and the orange slices were so yummy that instead of throwing them out we added them to our mugs.  There's no cider where we live so I had to make it with 100% apple juice and it was still amazing.  Thanks!

I made this but added a LOT of rum. Let's say it was the "life" of my holiday party! I left it in the crock pot and it smelled divine. So tasty....

I used this recipe for a corporate event, and there was more commentary on the cider than the cookies we had spent hundreds of dollars on.  It's wonderful!

I served this at our office Christmas party and everyone loved it.  I simmered it in a pan on the stove and then kept it hot in a crock pot.  I left the cinnamon sticks in it and it smelled and tasted wonderful!

We loved this! I used a crockpot to warm the cider and wrapped the ingredients in cheese cloth instead of placing in a coffee pot. Worked great and I plan on making it in the future.

I made this on the stove top with a gallon of apple cider.  I used 2 cinnamon sticks and maybe 1-1/2 tsp cloves.  After reading the other reviews, I also reduced the brown sugar from 1/4 cup to maybe 3 or 4 tablespoons.  It turned out awesome!!  The entire pot was gone in a couple hours.  I do agree with previous reviewers the bottom of the pot was really strong, and I'm not sure how to change that, but I will definitely be making this again!

A wonderfully delicious recipe. I mixed the ingredients and simmered in a pot over the stovetop, and it came out delicious. It won over a group that included both apple cider lovers and newbies alike. ^_^

I can't keep enough apple cider in the house.  We found cider without sediment, so it was nice and clear.  We put the spices in coffee filter so that wasn't floating in there either.  We replaced the orange with 1/3 cup no pulp orange juice and cooked it all in the crockpot for about 3 hours.  It's delicious, and my teenagers make it themselves because they love it too.  Very, very good!

I made this cider in a crockpot.  I doubled the amount of everything except the sugar and i thought it was perfect!  I did not have cinnamon sticks so i used ground cinnamon in its place-guessed at the amount.  I turned the crockpot on high and let it heat for approximately 3-3 1/2 hours.  This will be a regular for my family this fall and winter.

Altered recipe a bit so I could cook it in the crock pot...
Added orange juice because that's how I've always had it.

Got many compliments!

Cider is delicous BUT I do suggest if you decide to make it in a coffee pot then its worth going to your discount store and buying a cheap $10.00 pot just for this.  If you make it often during the holiday season it will be worth your purchase BECAUSE it will ruin your pot.  Everything tastes like cider and your cider has a slight coffe taste.....no matter how many times you run water through...before or after.

We made this in the coffee maker and it tasted WONDERFUL.  However, this recipe would be better if you can make it with a coffee maker in which you can wash all of the parts.  I used a typical plug-in coffee maker, and spent 2 - 3 hours cleaning out the resovoir where the water usually goes.  (I felt very blonde for not considering this before.  I am naturally blonde, but still felt silly!) The apple cider that was in there was VERY sticky, and I didn't want my coffee to have apple flavor in it.  I will try it on the stove or slow cooker next time.

I have been making this for years!  I got the recipe from the Gooseberry Patch recipe book. I can see how some might think it to be too sweet but you can easily dilute it with more cider. I think it is perfect. Just be sure to run clear water through your coffee pot a couple times afterwards to clean it out. Happy Holidays!

This was so good! I made it on the stove top. I put all of the spices in a cheese cloth and floated the oranges and cinnamon sticks. I also put in a few extra cinnamon sticks. This was sooooo good! I simmered it on low for 4 or so hours.

I was happy to find a cider that you could make in a coffee pot.  People at my party could not get enough of this cider!  It worked perfect in a 30 cup coffee maker and did not leave any messy clean up inside the coffee pot.  Many people requested the recipe.  The cider had a hint of orange to it that made it taste wonderful.  Thank you for the perfect recipe!

I am not a fan of cider but my husband loves it.  This is the recipe we use all the time.  It is so easy and quick and I love the way it makes the house smell in the winter!  I've made it with apple juice instead of cider and my husband loves it that way as well.  Thanks for this recipe.

My mother-in-law makes the best hot cider.  Short of asking her for her recipe, I decided to take my chances and find my own recipe.  I found exaclty what I was looking for! This cider is excellent; a great addition to our company Christmas carry-in.  It was a hit!  I used my crockpot instead of the coffee pot.  I put it on "high" for 3 hours and turned to the "warm" setting to keep it at the right temperature.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very tasty.  I didn't use my coffee maker but instead used a pot on the stove.  I would suggest putting the whole spices in a cheesecloth tied with string or a coffee filter as another reviewer suggested.  Very nice and warming on a cold winter's day!

this was a perfect combination of spices for cider.  the second batch i made, i just winged it with the same spices and it still turned out great.  we made ours a party and added a lot of rum too!  i cooked mine on the stove top and threw all the spices into a coffee filter and stapled it together like a little satchel, and just let the oranges float freely in the cider.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used apple juice instead of cider and didn't add the brown sugar; it was definitely sweet enough, so I recommend you use the brown sugar to taste. Also, I made this on the stove rather than in a coffee pot. I'll definitely make this again.

Very delicious!  I made it in a crock pot left on high for 20 minutes.  To infuse the spices I emptied out a tea bag and places the spices inside.  I then tied it up with a piece of thread.  I didn't use the orange.  Came out perfect!  Definitely will make this again!

So good....perfect to have on hand this Halloween for neighbors who stopped by!  Everyone loved it.  I just made it on the stovetop and filtered thru a fine sieve before serving.  I skipped the brown sugar, tho, and it was plenty sweet!

This tasted great, but I don't think the sugar was really necessary, and cleaning out the coffee pot afterwards is quite a task. I'll probably make this again next fall or winter, but without the sugar, and might try it in the crock pot.

This recipe ROCKED!  None of the stores had apple cider in stock so I ended up with regular apple juice.  I heard it was a little on the sweet side so I doubled the spices, added another quart of apple juice (about half a bottle), but kept the brown sugar (and orange, cut up into 6ths to fit better into the filter basket) the same.  My coffee maker only makes 12 "cups" of coffee at a time, so I just filled it up, emptied it into a carafe, then refilled the reservoir with the remaining apple juice.  BTW, even with my additional apple juice, this recipe barely satisfied 6 people (there were lots of seconds and thirds...).  I had to make another batch to keep them happy.  **BE AWARE!**  This has the potential to CLOG your coffeemaker if you let it sit overnight without cleaning it!  After your last brewing, dump the cider into a carafe or other storage vessel and run hot water or vinegar through your coffee maker IMMEDIATELY!  It may take a few runs for the water to run clear, but it's better than replacing your coffee maker or giving this AMAZING recipe less than its deserved 5 stars!

Big hit at the party and lots left over( I made a LOT) so I'm still enjoying it.  This was a great and easy recipe.  Was way too skeptical to try in the coffee pot, so I made in the crockpot with all spices in the coffee filter tied with a rubber band. Worked great.  
Will definitely make again, party or no party, its a keeper. 
p.s. added a touch of rum and re-heated after party was over for a nice hot spiked drink. Quite nice.

I just made this on Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  I have tried a few recipes in the past and my whole family said this was the best one.  I put it in the crockpot with everything in a coffee filter tied with a rubberband (like others suggested)and put the orange and cinnamon stick in floating around.  It worked great and was delicious.  If you have a white crockpot, you will really have to scrub at it to get it clean..maybe spray it with a little bit of cooking spray beforehand?  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy.  I like to tie sugar and spices in cheese cloth then put it into my crock pot, then I add cider that has already been warmed on the stove.  It makes the house smell wonderful. Thanks!

I made this receipe twice over the 2005 Holiday season.  It was very easy to make, although I did so on the stovetop due to the fact that I didn't want to have to clean the coffeemaker.  I also made a gallon at a time.  Everyone who tried it thought it was great including me.

Made on the stovetop & substituted ground cloves & allspice -- and it turned out wonderful!  Will definitely make again.

The best spiced cider I've tasted yet!  For large crowds (10+), you'll want to make on the stove top so you can double the recipe.  I heated it on the stove, then transferred to my crock pot to keep warm and free up my stovetop.  It disappeared quickly!

I made this in the crockpot b/c all the notes about it ruining coffeemakers scared me. It turned out okay, but didnt seem spicy enough. One change I'll make next time is to heat it on the stove first, strain out the allspice & cloves and then put in a crockpot. Its best not to gag your guests with whole spices :)

Great Christmas party drink.  We had this at our annual ornament exchange and it was spiced very nicely.  I didn't add any sugar because I like the natural flavor of apple juice.  Sugar wasn't necessary at all.  Everyone loved it!

A wonderful alternative to alcoholic beverages and coffee.  Easy to prepare and it made my house smell wonderful.  Will be fixing it next time I have a gathering in the winter for sure.

I tried this for an office party and I did use the coffee maker.  It couldn't have been easier or more delicious!  It is now almost February and I still make it at least twice a week at work instead of coffee.

Oh my Gosh! The comments helped me immensly.  I used a crock pot instead of the coffee pot and cut back just a little on the brown sugar and it was perfect.  It was the best I've ever made.  My guests loved it; I could tell because there was little left over and some wanted the recipe.  This is definitely a keeper!

I think it may be best to add the brown sugar at the end only if needed. I also think that the cider you use makes a difference. I've made this before and it was wonderful (using half the sugar). But this batch was way too sweet even with the reduced amount of brown sugar. In an attempt to save the batch, I added the juice of 3 lemons...and it worked! In fact, I may continue to add a little lemon juice to future cider.

This is the 3rd time I've made it and I believe I've hit a homer!  Don't use any brown sugar, this is sweet enough with the cider. I added 2 cinnamon sticks instead of 1. I also boiled it on high for 5 minutes in a large pot, let it sit and cool for another 5, then double filtered it through my coffee maker basket. I would hate to see what this would do to the insides of a coffee pot for those of us who enjoy coffee. The first filtration is with a paper towel, then back through the basket with a coffee filter. Nothing but rave reviews from everyone that drank it. Well worth the extra work.

Used this recipe several times during the holiday season and everyone loved it.  It was simple and quick since I put it in a slow cooker and let it sit while I did other baking.  Instead of using an orange quartered, I used 1 orange spice tea bag.  Great recipe!

Five stars WITHOUT the brown sugar.  It was delicious without it.  I made it successfully in my coffee maker, but the coffee maker never worked again.  The pump wouldn't pump.  Next time (after I buy a new coffee maker) I will use the crockpot.  I didn't have any allspice, so I subbed some pickling spice and it was wonderful!  A big hit at our Christmas party-- every drop gone!

I made this cider for Thanksgiving. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/8 cup, as recommended. I used a crock pot instead of a coffee maker. I tied up the whole spices in cheese cloth and put the ground nutmeg, salt, sugar, and oranges straight into the cider with the pouch of whole spices I created. I cooked the cider on high for a couple of hours until it was steaming hot, and then turned it to low when it was almost time to start serving it. I stirred it a few times while it was heating up. I took the cheese cloth pouch out at the end, but left the oranges in.

I didn't put it in a coffee maker, I just put all the spices in a DIY teabag. I also didn't add any brown sugar because it was always sweet and yummy straight out of the carton. I tossed mine in the slow cooker for 6ish hours and my boyfriend's best friend is now OBSESED with it. Also, to spike this, spice rum is amazing.

Very yummy.  I used a little less cloves (1/4 tsp. less) and 3/4 tsp, cinnamon because I didn't have a cinnamon stick.

We put apple juice in a slow cooker, added mulling spice, then added these ingredients tied in a coffee filter.  It came out incredible even though we didn't have any oranges on hand.

This was a HIT at a neighborhood Christmas party. I made spiced wine and this recipe and the Cider was gone in the first 20 minutes! I give it 4 stars, because I halved the amount of sugar and it was still a little too sweet. I also did it on the stove and let the flavors come together for about 2h beforehand... but only because I don't own a coffee pot! Thanks for this recipe!

This has to be the best spiced cider recipe I have ever tasted. Made it in the slow cooker instead of a coffee maker. I didn't have any whole spices, but the ground ones still worked well. Tied them all up in a coffee filter. Made this for Christmas, and it was gone before dinner. A keeper. Thank you.

This was great I used the coffee pot, and I didn't have any brown sugar so I just used white and less than it called for.  Also all I had were ground spices except for the cloves and added it all in the filter and then mixed it up a bit, and left out the oranges.

I made this for the large Thanksgiving gathering and it got rave reviews!  I couldn't find cider, so I used juice instead.  I made it in the crock pot and it simmered for several hours making the house smell terrific!  I am making it again for our Christmas celebration tonight.  Thanks for this recipe, I have doubled it both times with none left over.

I really liked the flavors of the cider, but mine came our really sour for some reason.  I don't know if it was the brand of my cider or what, but it was hard to drink because of how sour it was.

I made this in a saucepan and it camed out soo so good. It adds a ton of flavor to regular cider that everyone in my house loves. I used the cloves and cinnamon stick a few times before I threw them out, and I added less brown sugar since the cider is already sweet enough.

I only had ground cinnamon and cloves but it didn't seem to matter.  This cider was delicious!  I also added a pat of butter into the caraffe before brewing - a great accompaniment to Christmas brunch!

This is delicious! Threw in another cinnamon stick, orange sliced about a 1/4 inch, and a few more cloves. Simmered in a pot on the stove for about 30 min before serving.  Everyone got an orange slice and a cinnamon stick. It was a big hit.  The only complaint is that it went too fast.  Will have to double the recipe when I make it again at the holidays.  Thanks and enjoy.

This had a GREAT taste, but completely blocked my coffee maker! I cleaned it 3 separate times and ended up having to throw away. I think the brown sugar carmelized from the heat in the filter basket. I am glad it was a cheap coffee maker!!! Don't know what I could have done differently.

Absolutely delicious! Easy too! Had to use 1 tsp. ground cloves because I realized I didn't have whole ones. My coffeemaker isn't quite big enough, so I dumped in as much as I could & then poured in the rest after I emptied out the pot. Made a double batch for our Thanksgiving get-together, and everyone loved it! I will make this again and again and again...

This was a lovely flavoured cider. Another recipe I used was too sweet and didn't have a distinct apple flavour. We tried this one second and its consistency was also what we were looking for - smoothe and delightful.

Yum, yum, yummy!!! I love this recipe! It tastes better and costs less than the mixes you buy in the specialty stores. I prefer hot cider over hot cocoa, so this is a god send. Thank you for sharing.

This is the very best hot cider recipe!  I made it in my coffee maker, then brought it to work and kept it hot in a crock pot all day.  The whole office smelled fabulous!  I made a double recipe, but next year I will have to triple it!

Very easy. Everyone loved it. Did not add any sugar per other comments and it turned out great. Used a large urn and once brewed, left all evening and people just helped themselves. Will use this recipe again. Had to keep an eye on the cider level because the last bit was very pulpy and had to be strained but it is cider not juice so that is to be expected.

I made this spiced cider for my daughter's birthday.  Everyone loved it!  I thought it was a little sweet, and I love sweet drinks, but you could easily lessen the amount of sugar.  I'll certainly make it again.

I used the basket in the coffee pot method.  I didn't follow the exact measurements but it still tasted WONDERFUL.  Definitely use less sugar than 1/4 cup.  And since it clogged my drip up (had to open and stir with a spoon to dislodge the clog) I would recommend adding the sugar to the pot, after some has brewed in...then stir.  I will be making this again soon.  Delicious!

I made this in the slow cooker and the recipe is good.  A word of caution though:  Do not leave the orange slices in for more than an hour or so.  The white pith of the orange peel will make the whole batch taste bitter.  Or perhaps you could peel the orange first?  Mine was very bitter and I searched the internet for a remedy.  Adding a little more sugar and a bit of fresh lemon juice helped.  It probably didn't get rid of it completely, but it certainly tamed the bitterness to a drinkable level.

I skipped the coffee maker and the brown sugar (usually apple foods/drinks are sweet enough).  I put everything in a pot on the stove to heat it up and it was WONDERFUL! I did put the cloves in a tea strainer for easier serving, but that was it.

I made my cider in a crockpot - and it didn't seem to have much cider. I prefer the natural apple cidear I can buy from WalMart and will do so next year vs. this recipe.

This tasted really good. I didn't have whole spices so I used half of everything since I had only ground spices. Made 8 servings and used 2 Tblsp brown sugar,  1/8 tsp ground allspice, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, a dash of ground cinnamon, 1/8 tsp salt, a pinch of ground nutmeg, 1 clementine, and 4 cups of homemade apple cider.

Very good and very easy. Doubled everything but the sugar (kept it 1/4 cup). Heated it to boiling on the stove to thoroughly dissolve the sugar, then let it heat in the slow cooker. As others have suggested, I put the spices in a coffee filter, closed up with a twist tie. Everyone loved it.

Extremely easy and yummy!  I'm a real estate broker & serve this at virtually ALL of my fall open houses.  I use 3 quarts of apple juice instead of apple cider (it's easier to find & usually cheaper). I usually start it on the stove and then transfer it to the Crock Pot.  If I don't have the whole spices on hand, I just use the ground spices & have not noticed a bit of difference in the taste.  People rave about this cider.  Is definitely a recipe to keep long-term.

This was a huge hit at my autumn get-together, will be making it again soon! Yum! :-) Notes:  *This recipe worked great in a stock pot on the stove. Only needed about 30 minutes to simmer and we kept adding juice to the concentrate over the course of the evening. *We skimped on buying new spices and just used ground versions of each. When doing this again, I'll put the spices in a cheesecloth or the coffee filter that others have suggested, since straining the cider wasn't that much fun. *We skipped the cinnamon sticks added a healthy dose of ground cinnamon to the recipe and loved it.

I make this in a crock pot also. We love to take it in a large thermos bottle along with some ginger cookies when we go looking for our Christmas tree. It's a warm and fuzzy treat for the tummy on these cold and rainy autumn days! The aroma wafting through the house will make you crazy for a big mug of a fantastic hot cider!!

Really, really, really good.  The reason I gave this 4 stars is b/c I significantly changed the way it is made.  I heated it on the stove until it was hot but not boiling then simmered it for 30 minutes.  I took the suggestions of others and used a tied off coffee filter for the spices (but not the brown sugar).  I had clementines and no oranges so I used 2 of those.  My husband and I both thought this was absolutely delicious.  In fact, I am going to make some more now - perfect remedy on a day when the wind chill is -zero!

I used only 1 Tbsp brown sugar.  Took a coffee filter and put the cloves and allspice in it, then tied with a twist.  Used the crockpot, added the remaining ingredients to it and cooked on high for 1 hour; then turned to low 1 hour.  Spiked it with Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum!  EXCELLENT

Made my whole house smell WONDERFUL!! It tastes delicous also! So easy to make. I made this on the stove over medium heat for a couple hours, wrapped all the spices in a coffee filter and tied it with a twist tie, and just let the cinnamon stick and oranges float in the cider. Abosolutely wonder. I had made a precious apple cider recipe and it tasted like theraflu, so i was hesitant to make this, but glad i did! Definately a keeper!

My hubby made this mix in big batches one year except we used dried orange peel, and added star anise. We made up packages of the mix added a couple of mugs and put it in a basket for neighbours gifts. The smell in the house while it simmers is so homey and comforting. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great and easy recipe.  Cut the brown sugar to 2 T. and I didn't have cinnamon sticks so I added a t. of ground cinnamon into the cider before pouring through the coffee maker (it wouldn't go through the filter on the first batch where I put it in the basket).  No oranges either, so added 2 T. lemon juice to give it a zing and it was perfect - just like grandma's spiced tea:)

I made this cider for our Halloween Bonfire.  It had great flavor and was easy to make, but it killed my coffee maker.  Will try again using the stovetop method.

I made this for my works Thanksgiving pot lunch. I placed all the ingredients directly into the slow cooker; then placed on low to heat overnight. When I brought it into work, I just turned it to warm for the day. I have received many rave reviews and many asking for copies of the recipe. I will defiantly be making this again. :) Very EASY!!!

I let this simmer in the crock pot while I prepared for our Halloween party, and everyone loved it! My family doesn't usually drink apple cider, but it was gone by the end of the night. I used a bottle of store-brand apple cider from Target. Per the advice of other reviewers, I omitted the brown sugar and cloves entirely.  I put the other spices in a coffee filter and sealed it with a twisty tie, and I just let the orange slices float around freely.  They made it look colorful and festive.  Thank you for the recipe! I'm sure I'll make this again on special occasions.

Made this for work and everyone loved it!  I made mine in a crock pot as well; wrapped the spices & sugar in one coffee filter and the orange wedges in another, simmered on low and it came out perfectly.  Tasted great too!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was delicious and made the house smell so fragrant.  I followed others suggestions and heated and served this up in a slow cooker. I also put all the dry ingredients in a paper coffee filter and sealed it with a rubber band.  I plan to make this every fall.

This hit the spot on Christmas morning. We wanted something warm, sweet and different (to us anyway) to go with our coffee and settled on this. It seemed a bit strange to put all that stuff in our coffee pot but it worked like a charm. We used most of a two-quart bottle of cider right away and wound up going through twice that. Will be making again for certain.

This recipe was a hit with my entire family. It was gone within a matter of a  few minutes. I used coffee filters to hold the spices. Instead of quartering the orange, I added the juice to the cider and peeled the rind off and dropped it in as well. It was much easier than fitting the quarters into the coffee filters. Thanks for a great recipe!

The cider turned out great. Everyone liked it. But DO NOT use a coffee maker! The first time I used it, the cider went through great. The second time through, it clogged up and started smoking. Almost caught fire! The maintenance man at work was nice enough to take it all apart and fix it.

We make this all the time once the leaves start to change.  I don't use a coffee maker, I just dump it all into a crockpot in the morning and we dip into it throughout the afternoon and evening.  A very good, basic mulled cider, open to many variations (adding sliced citrus fruit, reducing or increasing the spices, adding ginger-fresh or ground-for a little zing...)

I made this last fall for a party and everyone loved it.  I just thought of this the other day, and I'm going to make it again. I didn't put allspice in or the orange. Great tasting cider.  I ran water through my coffee pot a few times after making this.

This cider was very good and easy to make. I dumped everything in a large pot and simmered it for 1/2 hour, which I think is easier than putting it into the coffee pot. I made a few minor changes: I used 1-1/2 cups of orange juice in place of the orange. Added some extra brown sugar and some ground ginger and NO salt. I don't know what the salt is for! It turned out great and perfect for my holiday open house! Thank you for the great recipe!

This is excellent.  The first time I maded it I used apple juice and the second time I made it I used apple cider.  It was much better with the cider.  I didn't make it in the coffee pot because ours is a Bunn and it has a resevior of water so the cider would have been diluted.  I made it in my crockpot instead.

After reading through the reviews, I decided to follow the recipe as is, but I cut the brown sugar and cloves in half.  Also, I put most of the ingredients in a coffee filter paper, tied close with twine and then simmered everything together in a stockpot on the stove.  Everyone LOVED the recipe - definitely repeating this one again!

I received many compliments on this cider BUT it was not by following the exact recipe. I read many of the reviews and recommendations prior to making my first cider. I had a goal in mind, a warm, sweet (but not overwhelmingly so) mulled cider with flavourful and aromatic spices and orange undertones. While this goal wasn't exactly reached, people were still very complimentary and enjoyed seconds, thirds, and sevenths of the end product. 

Because I was making 1 gallon of cider, I doubled the recipe. I began by pouring the purchased 1 gallon cider into a nonstick stock pot, adding a thickly slicing orange (4 slices with seeds removed) and brought to the beginnings of a boil (which was then quickly reducing to simmer). While the cider was heating to a boil, I added the spices into a cheese cloth (except ground nutmeg and salt which were added directly). I added the spices per the adjusted ratio for increased servings to the pot; the only spice not added at ratio was the salt (I added half of what was called for, for fear of a salty brew). As the spices simmered, I tasted the cider. I had not yet added sugar, because some reviewers mentioned that it became too sweet. This recipe NEEDS sugar, if using a standard purchased cider (which is not overly sweetened to begin with). I noticed in my sampling though, that a tartness lingered. I believed it to be due to the orange, so I removed the slices after about 20-30 minutes of simmering. I proceeded to add brown sugar and Splenda unt

Lots of potential, but like most others here I varied a few things. I also cooked this in a slow cooker on high, which took longer than I had expected, but the final result was fantastic. Below are my changes. 

1.) Remove all of the sugar
2.) 1/2 Tsp of cloves instead of the full tsp
3.) Blood orange instead of a regular orange, with a slightly grated peel, quartered and tossed in. 

I added all of the ingredients directly instead of attempting to filter, and fished them out at the end. Was fantastic.

Cut sugar in half as it is a bit sweet. Didn't have orange so didn't use it in the recipe, but I didn't miss it either. Suggest using the slowcooker as the preferred method although the coffee pot method made an excellent brew. At least one other reviewer had the same experience as me: after making this in the coffee pot, the coffee pot didn't work anymore. Not sure if it was because of the cider or just coincidence. Otherwise, excellent and easy cool weather drink!!

I loved this recipe.  I made it in the crock pot and placed all ingredients in a coffee filter, tied up, except for the oranges which I just left in the cider.  I set the temperature to low and in ~2 hours it was ready to go. I served it at at Gingerbread house decorating party and all in attendance really enjoyed it.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving. I threw everything in my crockpot so it was ready when I needed it. However, I left the oranges in after I served it up & it got very bitter from the rinds/peel so I didn't have any leftovers! Next time I must remember to take out the oranges! Dee-lish!

I made this three times in a crockpot, and the first time it was delicious. The second and third times it was undrinkable - be careful with the spices that you don't add too much because it will quickly overwhelm and ruin your cider (at least in a crockpot; I don't know about through a coffee maker). Making some more tonight and will follow the recipe exactly. Yummy!

Good, But I will keep looking for something with a bit more spice. I make it alot actually, because its easy. I make it differnt than the instructions imply and I am assuming that it would taste better if I had a coffee maker or a slow cooker, so to compromise, I make it stove top in my teapot with a giant tea bag and bring it to a boil. It is a quick, easy tasty drink.

This is soooo good! Totally omitted the brown sugar. Would probably be over kill. We made this in the crockpot, bundled up the oranges and the spices in coffee filters and let them float in the cider that way. After a few hours we removed them and let the cider continue cooking for a few more hours. It was outstanding. I put it back into the cider container and stored it in the fridge afterwards. Now we heat it up as we go. Everyone was "ooo" and "aahh" over this one.

Made this after dinner on Thanksgiving and what a treat!  Decided to just make this on the stove.  We used a plastic type coffee filter we found and filled it with all of the spices. We placed the basket in the pot with the cider and orange wedges.  The only change we made was to cut the brown sugar by half.  The result was DELICIOUS!  It was sweet but not too sweet with just the right amount of spices.  We have never had spiced cider before but this will not be the last time!

The spice combination is good, and the idea of using the coffee maker is great too.  Way too sweet though - definately too much brown sugar.  If I made it again, I will cut that down to half the amount.  It does make a good hot toddy though (I drank mine with some rum).

I made this for a fun fall party and everyone LOVED it.  I only put 2 tablespoons of brown sugar in it and I made it in my coffee pot.  It was quick and easy.  Just be sure to immediatly run water through your coffee pot several times afterward.  

It also made my house smell delicious :)

I skip on the brown sugar, salt, and orange.  I sub whole allspice for ground, cinnamon stick for ground cinnamon, and use apple juice.  I'm usually the only one who wants any so I make it 1 cup at a time and "wing it" on the measurements.  I strain out the clove and "floaties" from the other spices.  It makes a tasty hot treat on a cold Colorado winter night.

Very yummy, so so good on a frigid night.  For some reason I couldn't find apple cider in the store, so I used fresh-pressed apple juice.  Other than that had all the same ingredients, put it all in a slow cooker on low for a few hours.  Still good when warmed up the next day.  I didn't have a problem with it ending up too strong, I left all of the spices and orange pieces in there the whole time and it was just right (although maybe a tad on the sweet side, probably doesn't need that much sugar for my taste).
Thank you so much for such a comforting recipe!

I ended up running equal parts of apple juice and pineapple juice through the coffee pot, then keeping the cider warm in the crock pot during an open house at work. It was a big hit. It seemed like the spices were not quite strong enough after running it through the coffee pot, so I kept a tablespoon each of the allspice & cloves plus a stick of cinnamon in the crock pot for a stronger flavor. This recipe is easily tweaked to meet your own tastes.

I served this to my friends and got back a coveted rating of "It's better than Stovetop!" Since I only had juice, not cider, I added a bit more spices, and since brown sugar is a rare commodity over here I used white, but it worked wonderfully.

I was cold and looking for something different(not the usual coffee,tea,or soup)to drink to warm up. I followed the directions to a T except for the allspice.(all I had was ground so used it but only 1/2 the amount called for.)All I know is it tastes wonderful.....I'm addicted; and so is my son who doesn't like his cider warm. Thanks so much for a fabulous tasting and incredibly easy recipe.

This recipe is really tasty. It's also really fun to make. I didn't have cinnamon sticks so just put in 1/2 t. of ground cinnamon. It turned out really great. It's for a potluck at work tomorrow so I'm going to pour it into the crockpot in the morning & let it simmer all day at work. Yum!

Great recipe.  Have been making hot spiced cider for years since I live in apple country, but this is so neat to make it in coffee maker and the aroma was "so autumn".  Thank you! CNY Jane

This is one of the main reasons I look forward to autumn! I make this in the crock pot and the whole house smells amazing. Nothing beats curling up with a blanket and a mug of this.

What a fantastic way to make great cider! I make a huge batch when I have people coming over and even bought an insulated coffee carafe server thingie to keep it warm on the table. I never have allspice or cinnamon sticks but I do add ground cinnamon and it's great. YUM!

I made this cider for a party this weekend. I cooked it on the stove and served all of it to my guests; I only got to taste a tiny bit of it when I made sure it was the right temperature. I'd make it again for sure and I'll pour my cup first next time!

I used Alcoholic cider and brewed this in a slow cooker for about half an hour before my guests on boxing day arrived. went down so well I kept having to top it up and guess the amounts. Added a little bit of dark rum to give it extra pep. Found this to be an excellent base and will be making it again for next year. Thank you - went down a treat.

This is a wonderful and simple cider recipe - I served this at Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it!  I cooked it in my crockpot (instead of the coffee maker) and added 3-4 orange slices.

This is the most DELICIOUS cider recipe!  I make it every fall when it starts to turn cool.  All of my friends love it and can't wait till it's cold enough for me to make this famous cider.  It's so easy to make, and I can't tell you how wonderful it is.

Talk about comforting. I take night classes during the week and when I get home this is all I want. It's simple, it makes everything smell wonderful, and it's very relaxing. I bought a separate coffee pot just to make it. I'm having a party this Saturday and plan to make a lot of it. This is what Fall is all about!

My 13 year old daughter chose this recipe to make as the non-alcoholic beverage for her friends at our dinner party, and the kids loved it!  It was a cold night, and the hot cider was a hit.  I did use two coffee filters to bear the weight of all the fruit, but it tasted wonderful!

Made this recipe as directed with less than 10 minutes prep (not counting the perc time) in my 30-cup percolator, and it was great! I unplugged the percolator after its cycle to keep the cider from getting too hot. Guests loved it, asked for recipe. This is now my go-to hot spiced cider recipe!

If you think this is too sweet, mix it 50/50 with hot tea.  You can’t make it with tea already in it because tea starts to get really bitter if it steeps longer than 5 minutes or so.  Hot cider is good for one warming drink.  Mixed with tea, you can sip it to keep warm and refreshed all day long.

It was a hit! since I didn't have a coffee pot, I just used a large Dutch oven and cooked it on low. I did skim out the large seasonings to keep it from getting stronger and make up for my lack of a real coffee pot. Smelled and tasted delicious! Thanks so much!

I agree completely with Rebecca that brown sugar (or any sweetener) is not at all needed for a wonderfully tangy drink. I loved it  as an antidote for miserably cold weather and, more importantly, the result impressed my daughter. Two midification

Very glad I read the reviews advising against the brown sugar. I made it without the sugar, just on the stovetop, and it was wonderful. Will definitely make it again.

I prefer less brown sugar and half an orange for the full recipe.  The recipe was too sugary and the orange flavor was overpowering the spices.

Tied the spices into a coffee filter and threw it into a slow cooker.  Worked great but left the spices in overnight and ended up having to dilute what was left because so much spice leached into the cider.  Remember to remove the spice bag before storing the cider!

Great recipe.  I omitted the coffee pot  and brown sugar (put in a crock) I doubled the recipe and used a gal of apple cider- ground spices and and I sliced the washed orange into disc.  Once the crock gets hot, stir to mix the spices.  I made it for office and it drew people in as it smelled wonderful.  lots of people wanted the recipe.
yummm not one drop left!

I used this recipe to add some spice to my homebrewed cider and it worked a treat - personally I dropped the salt and upped the allspice a little. Dont be afraid to experiment with each batch :)

I absolutely love this recipe!! Let me say first, that I am sure our local cider has a lot to do with it- it is the most delicious cider in the world. I made this recipe around Christmas time last year in our office and the aroma drove everyone crazy! I served the drinks in small plastic christmas themed mugs and everyone had seconds and then was able to just discard their mugs. I am making it for the office tomorrow. If you want to lighten the mood in your office around the holidays, this recipe will be a hit-Promise!

Great cider! I realized I didn't have a cinnamon stick at the last minute so I just added some ground cinnamon to the slow cooker and it worked fine.

This is so good you will love it.  Cut the brown sugar in half.  We made it stove top because I didn't want to run it through our coffee machine.  It was absolutely delicious and a new Christmas tradition for us.

I made this in the crock-pot for a party.  I followed others advice and used a coffee filter w/ a rubberband for the spices and let the oranges free-float.  I thought I might have to remove the spices at after a few hours, but never needed to.

This was great! I didn't have "whole" spices to use so I subbed 1/2 tsp of cinnamon for the stick and used the ground amounts for everything else. It came out delicious and everyone loved it. I topped with caramel and whipped cream like starbucks does! thanks!!!

Simple and delicious! I ran the cider through my coffee pot and put all the spices in the filter. To clean it I had to run through two rounds of white vinegar but it worked perfectly and smelled divine when brewing.

Very tasty spiced apple cider.  Upped the yield twice its size to a gallon, and added the zest of the orange.

This was not bad and was pretty simple, but I'm still looking for one that is similar to the one I had at Hobee's restaurant.  Hobee's is very flavorful with a bunch of spices, but I can't tell what.  I used a pot since I don't have a coffee maker and I took the suggestion of using a coffee filter.

This is the easiest and best tasting cider I have tried. You can make it ahead of time and the longer it sits the more flavorful it becomes. I've made it for a Holiday Boutique and for Thanksgiving and recieved many many compliments on it!

This will make a nice addition to my holiday "drink" rotation.  I wasn't able to brew the full amount in my coffee maker.  I only have a 4 cup machine and a clove got stuck in the drip hole and I had to shut it off.  BUT, I did several cups worth and was able to enjoy about half of the recipe.  The clove taste really came threw.  Thanks for sharing.
