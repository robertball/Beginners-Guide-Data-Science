This recipe was pretty great as is.  The changes I would make next time are: 2 cans of tomatoes (and double the wine), 8oz of fresh sliced mushrooms when sauteing the onions.  I added the peas (still frozen) after 15 min and simmered for 5 more min.

My fiance and I loved this!!!!! I did some little tweaks to it though. I didn't have any coconut oil so I used olive oil instead and I used fat free condesned milk.  I also used tomatoes with chopped chiles to give it a little extra kick.  I also shredded some baby carrots into the veggies as well.  I also used chicken stock instead of the veggie stock.  I will make this again!

This was really good!  I adapted it slightly - added WAY more veggies than called for and a touch more cheese, broth and evap. milk.  Also, used a 29oz can diced tomatoes and I would use even more next time!  Also, added diced carrots and am thinking mushrooms and/or asparagus would be a yummy addition next time too.  Thanks for a keeper =)

This was very yummy.  My husband enjoyed it too.  Only changes I made were based on others' reviews so I used more tomatoes, wine, peas and paremesan. Used chicken broth instead of vegetable.  Used olive oil instead of coconut.  I also liked the fact that we were eating something that was pretty good for us too.  I will def make this again.

This was sooooooooo great! I simply used carrots instead of celery (not a fan)and doubled the tomatoes and peas and used olive oil. Scrumptious! I do agree that mushrooms would be lovely also.

I gave this 5 stars, my husband gave it 4 stars (but he's comparing it to his favorite food ever, salami sandwiches ;) ).    This was easy to make (it took a little bit of time, probably because I hadn't drained the tomatoes enough) and was delicious! This was my first time cooking quinoa and it won't be my last.    I substituted shallots for the onion (it was what I had on hand).  I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers :)  Made this again - it is even BETTER with mushrooms in it.  I added them to the onion/celery mix when they were cooking.

This was my first time at trying quinoa as well.  I was really nervous.  Because I'm such a picky eater, I omitted the tomatoes and replaced peas with edamame.  Delicious!

We are just beginning to venture out and eat helthier "rice type" things. I like quinoa and made this for the family. I used a 28 oz can of the tomatoes and they were fantastic roasted in the oven...don't skip that step, it makes a big difference.  And I added a little more parm cheese than the recipe stated. and used fat free half and half. I had it on the side of a pork dinner and it was even better the next day. Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy!  I thought all of the different flavors blended well together.  I didn't alter the recipe at all, and it made great leftovers!

What a nice flavor.  You don't even realize there is no meat in this dish.  We had with with Cajun Sweet Potatoes for a delicious complete vegetarian meal.

This was an awesome quinoa recipe - it DOES make a full 12 servings, though!  After reading the recommendations, I followed the other readers' suggestions of doubling the tomatoes and peas, and adding some shredded carrots to the sauteed vegetables.  I didn't think the coconut oil added any special flavor, though, so next time I'll probably make it with an oil lower in saturated fat.  But definitely a keeper!

Added some shredded carrots along with the onion, garlic, and celery.  Only had 1 & 1/2 cup of quinoa and more than doubled the amount of peas and it still came out beautifully... and delicious!  It smells amazing, I love the hint of coconut from the coconut oil.  Quinoa lovers will adore this meal.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I liked how this recipe turned out. I did change a few things though. I used chicken broth instead of vegtable broth, I sauteed my onions and garlic in a light spray of canola oil, I didn't add the peas( don't like them) or the celery( ran out of it).I added the roasted tomatoes to the plate so a person could choose to have them or not. I will definetly be making this recipe again.

I found this recipe when I was searching for ways to cook with coconut oil - I am pregnant and coconut oil is suppose to be a "super food" for pregnancy. This is an awesome quinoa dish! Really feels like eating comfort food but is pretty healthy; this has become a winter staple for us. As suggested by other reviewers, I added more tomatoes and peas. I also added some roasted asparagus (roasted in oven at 400 with some olive oil and sea salt) then cut in pieces and added at the same time as peas.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe, but it seemed a little bland. The people I had over for dinner loved it and plan on making it themselves, but my boyfriend and I weren't all that impressed. However I loved the consistency of it, so I think I will try it again and add some kick to it. I didn't have coconut oil so I used vegetable, and I didn't have the evaporated milk so I omited it. Next time I think I'll add diced chilies, more tomatoes, wine, and use olive oil. But it was a great recipe for quinoa all in all.

I'm a little perplexed by all the rave reviews.  This is OK, but not better.  I agree with the reviewer who recommended doubling the tomatoes.  They kinda shrivel up in the oven and disappear once mixed into the quinoa.  I will do that if I make this again, but I probably won't make it again.

Don't waste the time.  The onions overpower the quinoa and overall it just does not blend.

Five stars as made with many of the other reviewers suggestions; including replacing chicken broth for veggie broth and using mushrooms/grated carrots instead of celery. Also used some extra cheese! Will definitely be making again!

Even without celery and substituting olive oil for the coconut oil due to what I had on hand, it was a hit!  My vegetarian daughter requests this often and her very non-vegetarian boyfriend loved it as well.

This is very enjoyable.  I decided to make this last-minute, so I had to substitute, some from necessity and some for preference.  I had cherry tomatoes that needed to be used so I roasted those instead of using the canned, diced tomatoes...had about 4 cups before roasting, and I did roast them until they were browned a bit.  And I had no vegetable broth so I subbed with chicken broth.  I despise celery, so I omitted that and added some shredded carrots.  I sauteed my onions until they were browned a bit and then dumped everything in into my rice cooker.  I also had no evaporated milk but did have a half cup of heavy cream to use up, so in it went!  :)  Based on other reviews, I added quite a bit more cheese, and I would definitely recommend doing that.  And I also liked the amount of tomatoes I added.  This is a great base recipe that you can tailor to your preferences with veggies.  I will definitely add more next time, and I will definitely make it again!

It works nicely with sun dried tomatoes instead of using roasted fresh tomatoes. I used olive oil instead of coconut oil and a mixture of cream cheese and milk instead of evaporated milk.

I don't know if I did something wrong but my dish came out like paste.  I was suprised by the consistancy, I expected it to be more fluffy.  My family still liked the taste and some actually liked the stickiness so I gave 4 stars.

My family loved this one.  I didn't use celery or coconut oil (just because I didn't have it home). I used vegetable oil and I used a bag of frozen carrots and peas and added fresh mushrooms.

I made this as written except I used pecorino romano cheese because that is what was in the house and I used 16oz frozen peas. Loved it and will definitely make it again!

This was quite good.  My family had never had quinoa and everyone enjoyed it, including the kids.  My only neg thought with this dish is that it needed more celery and in larger pieces because I liked the crunch of it.  It would be good for some texture.

Love it!!!  We are not vegetarians, so I served it with a side of meatballs (bought frozen, no sauce).  We had some leftover, but it didn't last long!  Kids loved it as well.
