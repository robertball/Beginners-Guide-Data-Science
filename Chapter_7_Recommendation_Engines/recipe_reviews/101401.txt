These were so delicious!  I made them for a dinner party and there were no leftovers.  One of my guests said they were the best pork chops he'd ever had.  I changed the recipe slightly.  For the apricot sauce I used home canned peaches, instead of apricots because I couldn't find fresh apricots.   I added curry powder and sliced green onion to add interest, because I didn't like it prepared as directed.  I made the glaze for the pork chops almost as written--I added a little more curry is all.  Will make again!  Yummy!

It is a VERY taste specific food. If you don't think you or your husband will like it your probably won't. My husband hated it while I thought it was tolerable- and he LOVES pork!

One of our favorite recipes.  We make this all the time.  Since we don't have access to a grill, we use a grill pan on the stove and these still turn out great.  Goes really well with mashed sweet potatoes and cinnamon or sweet potato fries.

very good - I have my own supply of fresh apricot jam that I made from apricots from our own tree and lots of fresh apricots. This was a great way to use apricots and make a new recipe with grilled pork chops and it tasted great!
