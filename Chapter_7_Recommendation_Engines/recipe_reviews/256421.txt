We LOVED this! I made single burgers (Mac Jr.'s), and quartered the sauce recipe, which was the perfect amount for 5 burgers.  Also, I made my patties about 4 ounces each b/c I was only making singles. The family flipped over these...they really did taste just like a Big Mac! I will def be making these again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Hubby declared the sauce to be spot on.  That said, the recipe makes enough sauce for dozens of burgers, not just two.  I cut the sauce in half and still.....  it's a LOT of sauce.  
I did make my burger patties bigger than instructed, but I couldn't help myself.   2/3 lbs for 4 patties is probably about what McD's would serve.

This does not taste like Big Mac Sauce. We eat enough Big Macs in this household to know the difference. I’ve yet to find a recipe that is anywhere near tasting like the actual sauce.

To be honest I just made the the sauce to put on some sliders.  The sauce came out great and I've reused this recipe numerous times.

I doubled the recipe and made 8 patties out of 2 full pounds of beef. I cut the sauce recipe in half. These were great! I will be making them again.

How could I not make this immediately?!?! Easy peasy with the most difficult part being the small mince of the onions. Everything I needed was already in the house! A couple of ice cold Cokes added and my husband and son were in heaven!

This sauce is delicious!! Perfect for burgers & french fry dipping. I dont always follow the recipe, I just kinda wing it till I'm satisfied with how it tastes. Everyone loves this sauce at bbqs and is always asking me for the recipe.

I like the sauce but I should’ve cut the recipe in half it made a lot. I didn’t feel that it had the same flavor or color of a Big Mac  but I’ll more than likely make it again

The "tartar" style sauce. This recipe makes 2 CUPS! However the recipe only makes two burgers... so something is wrong here. The burgers only require about 2 tablespoons of sauce each. 4 at the MOST!

The sauce bears no resemblance to McD's special sauce. Any brand of Thousand Island dressing would be better.

It was good, but I felt greasy eating it afterwards. The sauce is on point though, although it isn't the right color.

Thanks so much nick!!!
This meal (clawed as a gourmet burger by my father) was a hit with my family.. I found the sauce recipe to be a bit big so I quartered it...Otherwise it's first class. Thanks again!
