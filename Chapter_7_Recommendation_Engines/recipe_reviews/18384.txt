We made this last year and can't wait to make it again. I gave it four stars ONLY because we made a few changes...to us, it wasn't hot enough, even our picky 4 & 5 yr old "non-spicy-eating" daughters ate it. This could just have been the jalapeno peppers I got, which vary due to ripeness, etc, so I plan on doubling up or leaving in some seeds this year. Also we used 100% cranberry/pomegranate juice in place of the water (YUM!) and omitted the sherry based on other comments. Finally, I pureed the finished product and while it seemed a little thin while hot, it jelled up nicely if you prefer a smoother consistency.

Based on some previous reviews I made a couple changes.  I used 2/3 cup water and 1/3 cup lite corn syrup and 1/2 cup Splenda in place of the sugar.  Left out the lemon juice and substitute triple sec for the sherry.  This was amazing!  It tasted like jalapeno jelly with cranberries.  I'll be making it again and every Thanksgiving from now on!

I love cranberry sauce and this was really a new take on things for me with the jalapenos. NOTE: if you remove the seeds AND MEMBRANES of the jalapeno you will remove most of the heat yet retain the pepper flavor! The membranes hold the heat so if you don't want the heat...plus I used 1/4 cup high-quality pear-flavored vodka rather than the sherry; I think sherry makes things a little cloying in any recipe, but that's just me. Thanks for this recipe!

I love sherry in tetrazzini and stroganoff, but not this. I added it bit by bit, and wish I stopped at 2 Tbsp. or left it out. I doubled the lemon juice. I think this recipe has promise, but can't figure out what it needs. Green pepper, like jalapeno jelly? I am going to experiment further, and definitely add less water and more jalapenos.

This recipe rocked with my slight changes: instead of lemon juice I used the zest and juice from one orange, and I didn't have sherry so I used Captain Morgan Tattoo Rum, which is dark and spicy and citrusy. I let the sauce simmer a bit to cook off the alcohol for the kids. It was the most incredible cranberry sauce this family ever had....it was gone in a heartbeat! The chant was "Make More, Mom!"  My last tip: DOUBLE THE RECIPE! Always wear gloves when seeding and mincing the jalapenos.

For kicks, leave in the jalapeno seeds and use vodka instead of sherry!

One of our local grocery stores deli makes this sauce and I've always wanted to try it at home.  This recipe is top notch.  I didn't change a thing.  If you don't like it hot, but still want the flavor of jalapeno be sure to get all the seeds and the white parts out of the inside of the pepper.  I fill my sink with water and cut the pepper in half under the water.  Then, take a baby spoon and scoup out all the seeds underwater.  Be sure you wear gloves when you do this or you'll feel the heat for a couuple days!  I used 2 peppers cleaned and diced fine and the flavor is perfect and not overpowering at all.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was a little runny.  But the flavor was delish.  Those who like hot/spicy loved it.  It made plenty and have some left over for christmas.  Maybe cooking it a little longer would help with the thinness, but we just used a slotted spoon and all was fine.

A great variation on the traditional cranberry sauce. My sauce turned out a little runny, so I'm going to work on ways to make it 'jell' a little more. But, overall, it was a hit at our table.

This was yummy.  The spice level was just enough to add a hint (without seeds), and the jalapenos added a little bit more texture which was great on sandwiches.

Very good. Mine was a little thin too(my fault) but we used it on leftover turkey subs and worked out pretty good.

Wanted to try another variation of the run-of-the-mill sauce and this one hit the mark!  Excellent flavors all melded together into a mouth watering accompaniment to the turkey.  Only change we made was to sub chardonnay wine for the sherry (only cuz we didn't have it).  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great cranberry sauce. I did have to add some more jalapenos because the kids said it wasn't spicy enough. It still was not hot enough for the adults, so I added about 7 habanero peppers towards the end. My family LOVED it!!! My husband said that it is the best cranberry sauce he's ever had.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving with friends.  It was delicious and the adventurous people enjoyed it.  I think next time I would add a few jalapeno seeds to spice it up just a little.  Also, it didn't really set up so it was more like a gravy than a gel.

I love this recipe! It does turn out a bit thin, but that's okay. I do add more jalapeno than Uncle Bill, and I cook the sherry, otherwise it has an alcohol taste that I don't care for. It's super yummy and just a bit different than the usual cranberry sauce.

Just didn't care for the flavors together much. My family didn't either so I won't be making again.  We love Jalapenos so I was surpised.

Little too sweet. next time I'll definitely reduce the sugar by at least 25%. Sherry could also be reduced by about the same. Otherwise super good!

I love the recipe as it is.  I adjust the amount of jalapeno depending on how hot they are...the heat varies with each pepper.  If it is just for my hubby and I, I make it hot. If it is for the rest of the family I make a non-spicy version.   I replace the water with whatever citrus fruit juice (Grapefruit or Orange)I have in the fridge.    I also add very small slivers of orange and lemon rinds.   I really should make this other than at Thanksgiving.  It is really a great recipe.

These cranberries were okay. I have yet to find a recipe for a cranberry sauce that my guests rave over and have tried several different ones over the last few years.  My guests seem to prefer the whole canned cranberry sauce more and my homemade cranberry sauce hardly ever gets eaten every year.

This was really good!  The jalapeno really added a lot to the recipe.  I'm going to have to add jalapens whenever I make cranberry sauce from now on!

Cut sugar 25% which I think was the right amount. Also used a splash of Grand Marnier and a splash of vodka right after cooking it down. I don't know if it needed the liquor. I used 2 tiny, very spicy homegrown jalapenos and it had a good heat level.

I made this for the first time today for Thanksgiving dinner and it was fabulous. Thank you William for this great recipe.
