HAHA Great video! Utterly delicious. IF you use an 8" square dish like I did, cut the tortillas in half after heating to make a neat appearance along the edges of the pan (rounded side in.) Thanks again, Chef John!
**Oct. 2019. Made in the "suizas" style - also good. Thanks for the method, Chef John! A keeper, for sure.

Delicious! Just enough bite (spice) without lingering heat.
And yes, will make it again.

Simple and yummy dish, my husband and I both enjoyed it very much. 

I did sprinkle  sprinkle in a few  red beans with each layer, and added shedded lettuce and diced tomato on the plate when I served. The sauce has got a nice kick; these along with the guacamole and a touch of sour cream complimented the spice nicely.

My wife and I made this and it turned out very good. I loved the sauce but a little spicey for my wife. Had fun throwing it together!

I made the recipe as is. It was good all together but the chili powder and the cumin in the sauce was very strong. I put sour cream in each layer with the chicken. I made each one 3 layers since everyone would only get one. My youngest wouldn't try it because it smelled too strong, my oldest said it was spicy, but everyone else really liked it and was negotiating who would get my daughter's portion lol
