The marshmallows are not suppose to melt just get soft. After adding marshmallows to top and returning to oven watch carefully, may not need a total of 10 minutes. Don't let the marshmallows brown or the top will be crusty and hard to slice cleanly.

This cake was a total disaster.  Marshmallows didn't melt, but formed a crust on top of cake, that made it tough to cut and chew. No one could eat more than one bite.

Perfectly wonderful with rave reviews!  I used self-rising flour which eliminated the need for baking powder and salt.  I toasted the walnuts.  This is not a "cake-like" consistency but Mississipi Mud cake isn't supposed to have a cake-like consistency.  It's like a very rich brownie covered with melted marshmallows and topped with a wonderful chocolate frosting.  We loved it and my daughter said I could do this for her birthday from now on.  The richness cries out for a tall glass of cold milk; pure Heaven.  Thank you for sharing!!

This was extremely sweet, in fact, too sweet for me.  But, I took it to a potluck and everyone else seemed to like it, hence the 4 star review.

Delicious.  I made it for my daughter's 20th birthday and because she doesn't care for walnuts and her father's allergic to them, I left them out.

My daughter and I loved it and my husband ( who is not a big chocolated fan) loved it, too. I used pecans and I did use 1/2 cup cocoa and only 3 cups confectioners sugar in the frosting. I also spread the frosting on the cake while it was still warm. It was even better the 2nd day. I will make it again. 5 stars from me!

It was way too sweet for me. I only used half of the frosting but still too sweet. N also the cake was a bit too hard n dry. May b my oven problem.

It was great. Just like I remember my mother making from my childhood. Mine would have been better had I used actual marshmallows instead of a jar of marshmallow creme I had. But I will make it again.

This has been a family favorite for 40 years.  I take the cake out of the oven and spread a jar of marshmallow creme over the top.  Just put dollops and let them melt.  I then put the icing on and swirl it together.  Its suppose to look like the dirty Mississippi River. If you are a fan of coconut put a cup in the batter for a change.  Fabulous!
