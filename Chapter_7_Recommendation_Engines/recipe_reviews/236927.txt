A very tasty soup!  Instead of almond milk, I used cashew milk because that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The curry flavor is mild, but is definitely noticeable and gives the soup a really nice flavor.  I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I love trying new soup recipes and this one's a keeper!

I used 2 cans White Kidney Beans.  Added chopped carrots and finely choped celery.  I also doubled the curry powder and added 2 Tabelspoons Quinoa and a little seaweed (Emerald Cove, Pacific Wakame).  Next time I will add barley.  I really like the addition of almond milk.  I used plain pure almond milk called "Malk" (3 Ingredients Filtered Water Organic Almonds, & Himalayan Salt).  Thanks for the recipe!  Will make again.

Very tasty soup.  I did make changes which change it from being a vegan dish.   I used what I had in the kitchen.  Substituted veg broth with chicken broth, kale with spinach, almond milk with heavy cream.  I didn't have curry so I combined the following spices.  Cumin, turmeric, red chili powder and a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon.  Excellent...will definitely make again.

What a pleasure to make such a great dish.  After making the substitutions mentioned previously I added a cup each of carrots, celery, small pasta, potatoes, a tin of corn and a little corn starch to make it thicken.  I served this with a slice of multi-grain bread.   Everyone had seconds.  Thanks to you and your reviewers.

I used 1 teaspoon of curry powder and a little bit of red pepper because we like our food spicy. I thought it was delicious, and so easy.

I substituted a leek for the onion (needed to be used!) and rice milk for the almond milk. My 12 month old loved it! I also doubled the curry spice, as we all enjoy curry flavor. Will make again!

I love this soup! The only thing I do different is double the curry and add 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. SO yummy!

I follow the recipe pretty close, except I made it my Cuisinart Pressure Cooker.  I sauted the garlic then the onion in vegetable spray, then added 2 thinly sliced carrots and 3 stalks of celery with leaves, thinly sliced along with the washed and chopped kale.  I poured in the vegetable broth and cooked it at low pressure for 7 minutes.  After releasing the pressure I set the cooker to simmer and added the chickpeas and almond milk.  I didn't have any curry, so I added some ground pepper, 1/2 teaspoon Ceylon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, and a good turn of Himalayan Pink Salk Flakes.  The soup was delicious and didn't taste like kale.

Absolutely delicious! Used a bag of Baby Kale Blend (that's all I had) which consisted of baby kale, spinach, baby swiss chard, and some other mixed greens and came out tasting fantastic.  Next time I'll double the recipe, got to have more!  This is light and satisfying, great for lunch.

love love love this recipe. first time i made it i followed the recipe exactly. knew then that this one was a keeper. these days i add a small tin of corn kernels, a regular size tin of asparagus cuts and tips, 1 cup of small pasta shells and since I'm not a vegan/vegetarian, half a chicken that's been shredded. i find it more filling that way. delicious recipe either way.

For me, the kale is too strong. If I were ever to make this again, I would use spinach.
