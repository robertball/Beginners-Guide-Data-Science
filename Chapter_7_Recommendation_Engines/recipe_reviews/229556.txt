I threw in a clove of fresh minced garlic in with the butter and sauteed it a bit before adding the honey, lemon juice and ginger. I made no other changes. These were out of this world......even my kids liked them!

Really nice flavor combination.  I steamed the carrots instead of cooking in water, then sauteed them as directed until the sauce was glazed and very browned over the carrots.  Converted some non-carrot eaters in our family to liking this vegetable!

These are very good but I would cut back on the honey.  The lemon off sets the sweetness of the honey very well.   These would be easy to steam or par boil the carrots ahead of time and finish just before serving.

Very good. I sliced three regular size carrots into 1/8th inch rounds and used the recipe set to 1 serving.  I also didn't have lemon juice so  I used about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of lemon extract.  The honey and lemon gave it a pleasant sweet taste and not at all overpowering.  Will definately be cooking this again.

Dd LOVED the honey, lemon, ginger combo. (I did add garlic) First bite..."Is there ginger? (I used fresh grated, all I had)  Yum. This is so good! I like this so much better than the orange juice version. Make this A LOT more, ok?" Winner , winner, chicken dinner!

I loved these!  I eyeballed the ingredients, probably added less honey and more ginger, and the results were excellent.  I plan to make them again when we have guests next Friday.

I took the advice of another review and sauteed a couple of smashed cloves of garlic in the butter first.  I Used more ginger than called for and finished it off with some fresh cracked black pepper and a dash of salt.

I’m eating autoimmune paleo so I couldn’t use the butter. I substituted coconut butter, not knowing how that texture might end up. It worked great, another nice option for me.  Just the right amount of sweet with the savory

I used garlic powder instead of ginger and added a little salt and pepper to taste. My family was OBSESSED and want me to make them again.

This turned out really yummy!  My boyfriend doesn't care for sweet glazed carrots, but this had a nice tangy/sweet mix that he actually enjoyed.  I'll definitely make this again!

I will make this again, but will reduce the initial cook time from 10 minutes to 6 or 7 minutes to avoid overcooking them before the glazing process.
The changes I made to the recipe were to use a few slices of fresh ginger root instead of dried, and I sprinkled a little fresh thyme.

I used normal sized carrots (colorful assortment) cut into smaller pieces.  really liked this recipe though I'm not a huge fan of carrots, I think we ate them all.

Very tasty.  I used garlic and replaced the lemon with key limes and it was very good.

The flavor was very good, but the sauce never formed a glaze or thickened at all.  I just spooned it over a bed of rice.
