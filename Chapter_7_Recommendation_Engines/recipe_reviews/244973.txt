As is, 2 stars. However, after making this I think I know how I might could improve it next time. A big problem I ran into was the sauce not being able to thicken up due to all the excess water coming out of my zucchini spirals. Next,  time. I think I will make and thicken the sauce separately, saute the veggies (all of them, including the spirals) and then add the sauce on as I'm serving to combat the water in the veggies from thinning out the sauce perpetually.

One of the other reviews suggested cream cheese as an alternative to cream.  Worked great!  My husband couldn't eat enough of it.

Added some garlic powder and Parmesan cheese in. Sauce didn't thicken up, so the recipe is pretty watery. Should have cooked veggies separately.

I had to adapt this recipe....I cook for one most of the time. I used pesto (my own homemade) instead of fresh basil. I also put cooked chicken in. My end result was "browner" looking than the picture, but really tasted great! I will try this again.

This dish was absolutely delicious! I used less basil than the recipe called for (personal preference) and added about 1/3 cup of shredded Parmesan-Romano cheese.
This is a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe!

Oh my gosh!  Totally surprised at how fabulously tasty this recipe was.  I wasn't sure my meat eaters in the family would like it, but they sure did!  I did substitute the whipping cream with cream cheese, because I didn't have any whipping cream.

I really liked the flavor of this, but did make a couple of additions and substitutions based on what we had on hand. I added a little bit of garlic powder and left out the mushrooms. I substituted some squash into it and added some shredded mozzarella and parmesan. It turned out really well! My husband wasn't a huge fan, but I really liked it.

It was ok. I only used 1 cup of heavy cream. More than enough. In the very end I thought it needed meat (I know it’s in the vegetarian section of all recipes). So I had some boars head precooked bacon that I microwaved and added to the top. I wish I had cooked some shrimp in the pan to also go with it. Needed some bread to sop up the extra sauce. Good flavor I guess just maybe my fault for not doing the add-ins. I do however recommend only 1 cup of heavy whipping cream.

This was a very easy to make and delicious recipe. Next time I make it, I will double the zucchini pasta as there was plenty of sauce leftover.

Flavor was great. I added extra basil, because I love it so much. As other commenters have stated, the sauce doesn’t thicken well and I even patted all my veggies down with paper towels to eliminate extra moisture. I will likely use half as much cream next time and see how it goes. Overall, a tasty recipe!

Excellent.   Didn't have mushrooms, but added some garlic when sauteing the onion. Otherwise made exactly as written.  Needed a bit more Salt & Pepper so we added it at the table.

Great recipe! I added summer squash to it and served it over chicken, since I didn't have any zoodles. I also substituted almond milk for the cream. We loved it!

Creamy goodness. Add some crushed red pepper flakes and you've go a winner.
