If my extremely picky three year old granddaughter can't stop eating them, I'm SOLD on this recipe. They pack a ton of protein- and I made them exactly as written.  Here are a few hints that will make your experience better, addressing previous concerns with consistency and burning.  I used my trusty Nutribullet to pulverize the dry ingredients first, then dump into a mixing bowl or 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup.  Add the wet ingredients to the same Nutribullet container and blend until completely liquified.  It should be very runny.  If it seems thick, add a couple tablespoons water and blend some more.  Pour the wet into the dry and mix with a spoon.  Your frying surface should be at a medium-low temp, sprayed with cooking spray.  I pour mine by 1/4 cup measure onto my nonstick fry pan.  Cooking these pancakes low/slow is key to success!  I've made them many times and after they cool, for the ones I'm saving for later, I layer in sealable containers separated by wax paper.  Keep 'em in the fridge and reheat. Yummy with fresh berries, sliced banana and real maple syrup!

These were delicious! I've never had/made anything like this, but as I was mixing it up, it smelled soooo good that I couldn't wait to dig in. As they are, they just have a hint of sweetness. Also, these are not as fluffy as the usual pancakes, but they are super moist and flavorful. I did not use the protein powder. I topped mine w/ butter, sliced bananas and maple syrup~YUM! I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious pancake!  Your family won't know it's an alternate pancake recipe  modified to be lower carb/high protein; not eggy or dry.   It is a great way to use my Tera's Whey bourbon vanilla protein powder which I don't care for as a drink.  I quadrupled the recipe so I could freeze some, and I drained the cottage cheese in a sieve for an hour to remove some excess liquid.  I still thought the batter was very thin, but it cooked up nicely.  Cooked six 1/4 cup sized pancakes on an electric griddle at 300 degrees, 3 minutes per side.

These turned out pretty tasty, though I had some issues with the batter and cooking. I had my pan on medium heat but found that the batter was soft so the outside would start burning before it had cooked enough to be able to flip them. So I turned the heat down to low and added a little flour to the batter (maybe about 1/4c), and the remaining pancakes were great. Served with sliced banana and syrup - yum!

I just finished making these for breakfast and I really wish I would have taken a pic. They cook up so beautifully. They have the texture of a crepe but thickness of a pancake. Taste kind of like banana bread. Great high protein recipe just before going to the gym! :)

Very tasty! I used Select protein snickerdoodle flavor and left out the cinnamon from the recipe. Cooked on low-medium heat, between 3 and 4.

I literally make a double batch of these and freeze them individually every two weeks for my toddler-aged son. They freeze well and are perfect for breakfast on the go. He loves them and we love them too and their packed with protein. They're a bit finicky to get the temperatures right, but on a gas stovetop I go for medium-low. Electric griddle, medium-high.

I followed the exact recipe.  I did leave out the protein powder which is optional.  They were exceptional.

I did have to turn my griddle down lower than I was expecting for the temp mentioned in the recipe or they browned too quickly for the inside to cook through.
It has a really nice flavor with the amount of cinnamon. I have made other recipes that did not seem as fluffy or had as good a flavor. 
I try to make them smaller in size and I  like to toast the leftover pancakes in my toaster oven to crisp them back up and spread a tiny bit of nutella between two of them to take on the go.

Delicious!  Blended it all up before camping and fried them up there.  Threw some blueberries on top.  We loved them and so did our kids.  Followed the recipe as written.

Excellent flavor overall.  I didn’t use the protein, only use half of the sugar and half of the banana because I don’t like the prominent flavor of banana in my pancakes it was perfect.  I Used the Vitamix. Really easy

These pancakes are EVEN BETTER than normal ones in my perspective. I eliminated the brown sugar and it still tastes amazing! I added blueberries, pecans, & other fruits when they were in the pan. My fav one is the pecan.

Had use a non stick pan and use vegetable oil along with butter so they wouldn’t stick, definitely needs to be dressed up with maple syrup and/or yogurt

I added a couple tablespoons of teft and wheat flour in hopes of offsetting the easy burning I read about but they still burnt easily on medium low heat.  I hope someone adds something that will help but the taste and texture were awesome.  I also used coconut oil which has a high temp burning point.

compared to other banana pancake recipes I've tried,  this one had been the best. the cottage cheese gives it a nice fluffy texture.

I give this recipe 5 stars.  Only change I made was using Arbonne Essential protein powder (vanilla flavored) so I decreased the vanilla in half.  Put everything in a blender at once (so easy)!  Served with lite fruit cocktail.  Tried one bite with syrup.....not too good so my recommendation is to stick with a fruit of your choice.  Have a little patience and stick to cooking them on medium heat.  Well worth your time.

Husband says "it's tasty" it was quite flavorful. The texture was a bit off. And it didn't make much. It was easy. Do be careful of the temperature. I found they could burn very easily, use a low temp.

Great recipe. I did not use the protein powder only because what I had was berry flavor.  Instead of oatmeal, I used Bob's 5 grain cereal. It is mostly oats but has some other grains. They were wonderful with a tiny drizzle of real maple syrup. I added a few blueberries on top for texture. Yum!
