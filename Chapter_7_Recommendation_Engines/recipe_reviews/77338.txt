These were way too dry.  Next time I'll just make regular pecan pie.

The crust ruins the recipe. Way too much flour!  Cut the flour to 1 cup, and it might have worked with melted butter, like we use in graham cracker crusts. The topping is acceptable, but it does not remind me of a pecan pie. I'd rename and revamp this recipe or just forget it!

I added one tub of applesauce to the crust (more liquid but no more fat) as it does have too much flour and I added some almond essence too.  It still needs to crumble when you press it into the pan.  I added some cinnamon to the topping for an extra taste.  A good quick and easy recipe.

I took the info from the other 2 reviews and melted the butter (I used margarine)and that made it compact.  The filling is pretty good and for a quick and easy goodie, I guess this isn't too bad.  If I can ever afford another bag of pecans for messing around with, I might keep tweaking on this recipe and get it better.

Too much flour in the crust!!  Very dry.  Crust needs less flour and more butter cut into it.  The pecan filling is pretty good, though.
