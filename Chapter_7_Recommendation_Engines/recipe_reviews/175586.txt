This is very delicious, I've made it many times for a slightly fancier dip.  I sprinkle the Parmesan on top instead of mixing it into the dip.  I've served it with twisted herbed breadsticks for a heartier appetizer.

Made this because I had some sun-dried tomatoes to use up.  I thought it tasted even better then the regular artichoke dip.  I took it to a party, and it disapperared before most of the other appetizers on the table and also before the other regular artichoke dip someone else brought.  Lots of positive comments.  Do not omit the sun-dried tomatoes--it makes it extra good!

Delicious!  I used fresh grated asiago cheese in place of the parmesan because I like that better and that's what I had at home.  Sprinkled a little sweet paprika on top before putting it in the oveen, just to give it a little color.  Nice and easy.  I mixed the ingredients the night before we had company over and put it in the oven shortly before our friends arrived so it was easy to just pull out and serve.

It was super easy, but super tasty as well.  I used the sun-dried tomatoes and served in a toasted bread bowl.

I love artichokes so I had to try this. This was good, especially considering how quick it was to make. It was a little garlicky, but I think it may have also been the size of the cloves I used. I am not sure, so if I make again, I will cut back on the garlic a bit. I left out the sun-dried tomatoes because, they were optional and I do not care for them anyway. I might try them that way for a party though for some added color. My dip melted all together in the oven, but didn't get a light golden brown like the picture even keeping it in the oven a tad longer. But, I don't think that affected the flavor. Next time, If I decide to make again, I might also try lite mayonnaise, as the cheese is already rich enough. Either way, the whole pan got eaten!

deeeeeeelish!  i live in italy and our mozzarella has more moisture in it than the overseas version so the consistency was a little runny until it cooled a bit but the taste was really & truly exceptional!  i will definitely be making this again!

Can't go wrong with this one...  What's so great about it as well, you can add extras to it! One thing I did to add some "bite" was mix some ground Jalapenos to it... My friends loved it!

I loved this recipe and so did my guests.  It was very easy to make.  I did use smoked sun-dried tomatoes-which made it even better!  Definitely try this one-you won't be disappointed!

Great flavor. A bit to much oil at the end. I used mayonnaise with Canola and changed the fresh garlic to roasted. Still needs something else, but can't put my finger on it. Very good on a baguette. Time to try this again.

I didn't have the tomatoes so I used roasted red peppers.  I was good but needed something.

I've made this dip for many years but leave out the sun dried tomato's because I'm not a fan of them. I also use 1 to 2 tsp of roasted garlic that I buy premade in a jar (found usually in deli/produce section at market). **TIP** Start with 1 tsp of garlic and taste. You can always add more garlic but if you use to much and dont like it, then its to late. This is such a huge hit and very quick to make when unexpected quests stop in. I usually serve with warmed tortilla chips or warmed sliced banquette bread. The bowl is always completely emptied.

I made this for some friends and it was a total hit! I like to tweak it and add a spoon full or so of minced garlic (the kind you get in a jar from the store), and some sour cream to make it creamier. I also added more artichokes then what the recipe called for because they are so good! Thank you so much for sharing this, I love it!!

Triple it. Trust me. I've made this several times, with variations sometimes. My favorite was adding about 2 oz of diced green chili, per batch.  My artichokes were marinated in water, not oil. I think that makes a difference. The marinated ones taste better than just plain artichoke hearts.

I added 1 3/4 cups ( 8 ounces= 1 cup) marinated artichoke heart instead of canned artichoke hearts. I didn't add the sun-dried tomato. I tried sun-dried tomatoes in different recipe and never got used to it; it has an odd taste to me. Otherwise, I follow the recipe to the letter and I baked it around  25-30 minutes. The cheese didn't melt properly so I put it back for another 10 minutes, took it out and decided to try it out anyway. It was so salty! Didn't like it at all!

This was pretty good.  I didn't measure the mozzarrella, I probably put at least 1.5 cups.  With that said, this tastes good, but its too "cheesy/stringy" to be a dip.  I used fresh mozzarrella, so not sure if that might be the problem.  And I like garlic, but I think 2 cloves was too much, maybe 1 next time?

this is the best,I was buying an artichoke dip with jalapenos,and my wine night girls loved it ,to The point of licking the bowl.I made this dip well,they like it  even better,they raved about it and now ask if I am making it every week.I made it with Light mayonaise,I wonder what it would be with greek yogurt as that is what was in the one I bought.Will be making this instead of buying it.Can be made before hand,
