I did all the instructions correctly but to me it seems like the texture of the Brulee was a bit off.   It may be due to the spice and other added ingredients. I baked it for longer than the time asked due to the Brulee seemly uncooked when taken out. I cooled it for 6 hours and caramelized  the sugar. Once cracked into it seems a little gooey. I would prefer the original recipe.

Excellent!!!  If you're grinding your own spices be sure and grind them very finely as they will swell, especially the cardamon.  Absolutely delicious recipe, thank you for sharing!!
