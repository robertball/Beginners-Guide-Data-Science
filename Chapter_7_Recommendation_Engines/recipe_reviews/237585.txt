Made these and they were wonderful! The sauce is super yummy! I made mine with peas and shrimp and it turned out well. I didn't have scallions, so I left that out. I think next time I will try to make it with avocado or edamame or some other fun vegetables. Based on some of the other reviews, I doubled up the rice paper and they didn't fall apart at all. Also, this does not do well overnight in the fridge. The rice paper hardens.

if you soak the rice paper in cool water rather than warm water they tend to be more durable.

This review is really more about the sauce than the rolls seeing as everyone with customize them to fit individual tastes.  I love peanut sauces of all types, but especially ones with coconut milk in them, but like many I'm watching my calories.  Using the Silk coconutmilk to cut the peanut butter was wonderful.  Great flavor with less calories.

I didn't actually make the sauce and wrapped almost anything I had on hand. It was like having a salad wrapped in rice paper. Very refreshing and next time I'll try making peanut sauce.

I changed it slightly; no bell peppers and added thinly sliced chicken.  It was delish and the sauce is amazing!! Loved it.

I couldn’t find the rice paper wraps so I mixed everything together to make a salad. That peanut dressing is amazing.

Delicious!  The peanut sauce was a little too salty for me so I added about 2 tbsp of honey.  Also I don't like using a lot of store bought sauces so I chopped jalapeño in a food processor and added about 1 tbsp to my peanut sauce!  So good!  I could eat this ALL DAY!
