These are very delicious!  I made them at the height of peach season, and every single family member said "Eww" as I was cooking.  Those Ewws quickly became Wows when I brought these to the table, however.  Every last one has always been eaten.  I've made them without the Parmesan or Romano when I didn't have any on hand, and they were just as good I think.  I've made them with prosciutto instead of pancetta and they were still good. I've added some of the following spices: cinnamon, mace, nutmeg, allspice, cardamom, and ginger.  All good.  I've added pinches of crystallized ginger.  Equally good.  It all depends on what you like.  The black pepper, ricotta, peaches and dough are all obviously essential ingredients, but go with what you personally like as embellishments - you will not be disappointed.  For me, cardamom is essential.

This might be the best thing I've ever made off of this website, and I'm on it every day! Will DEFINITELY make again. No one could get enough, it disappeared off the table.

It was very good. But I used pita bread because I didn't want to make my own crust. Still was very good.
