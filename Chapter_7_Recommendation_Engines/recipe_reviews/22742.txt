An easy basic recipe.  It turned out really nice--light and moist.  This would probably also be good with green chilis stirred in.  A warning about the printer ready recipe, it converted 1 1/2 teaspoons of egg replacer into 1 1/2 cups!!!  Be sure to look at the original recipe for proper proportions.

So lovely and light mmmmmmmm I used 1tbl spoon of milled flax to 3 tbl spoon water as egg replacer equivalent to one egg. Almond milk instead of water and all organic ingredients made these perfect.

mm mm, sooo good. my whole family loved it. my only changes were to use 7/8 c soymilk mixed with 1/8 c lemon juice in place of the water (a buttermilk-like solution), and also i baked it in an 8 inch round pan at 350 for 20-ish minutes. i'll be making this again!

I'd made vegan chili for a potluck and decided to make cornbread to go with it.  I doubled this recipe, added corn, diced red bell pepper, and jalepenos, then cooked it in a 10X13 pan.  It turned out WONDERFULLY.  There was one piece left at the end of the potluck and a friend took it home with a bowlful of chili for her dinner that night!

These are the best corn muffins ever!  I love the crisp tops.  After a long baking streak, I ran out of all-purpose flour, so I used whole wheat instead.  I didn't have any powdered eggs either, so I just used a regular egg.  I like my corn bread on the sweet side, so I might add another tablespoon of sugar next time.  I will definitely be making these often!  Yum!

I really liked these! Not too sweet, but that works, they go great with a warm pot of soup or breakfast. And they're truly addictive! I had a tin only for baking cupcakes, so it made more, smaller muffins, I suggest filling up empty spaces with water, I'm not sure why, but my mom told me to do that.

This recipe is wonderful. It goes really well with vegan chili. I can hardly wait for this summer weather to end so I can start making lots more! Oh yeah, and the non-vegans in my family enjoyed this recipe just as much as I did.

These were insanely easy to make and much more flaverful than I expected. They were so popular I had to whip up another double batch during my last dinner party. I couldn't find dry egg replacer at the grocery store, so I left it out. These still turned out much better than I expected. They were gobbled up by both my vegan and non-vegan friends. I think next time I'll add some filler like peppers, jalapeno, or dill.

Thank you!
I used the recipe but substituted the one cup of water for the 7/8 of soy milk and 1/8 of lemon juice.  Please, have chili with the corn bread, it is a very good and healthy pairing.

These were very tough, dry, and tasteless.  I DID use applesauce instead of oil, though, so gave it two stars instead of one.

These were ok. Probably would have been better with the full recommended oil, but I used less to make them healthier. Nice with jalapenos and chopped red bell pepper.

Yesterday I rated these muffins with 4 stars. They stuck to the paper liner, but were otherwise yummy.  But after sitting on the counter for less than 12 hours, the muffins are now rock hard. I'm throwing out the rest of the batch. I did double the recipe, so that might be where the problem lies, but either way I'm not making these again

These were really yummy. I didn't have egg replacement (nor did I know what it was...) so I used 1 1/2tbsp corn starch instead. I also added 3/4cup of frozen corn for moisture and I also added 1/2 tsp of paprika to the dry ingredients.  They turned out wonderful!

Very moist and light. Rose well. I used the buttermilk suggestion with soy milk and lemon juice. I converted the recipe to make 9  muffins and it was more than enough for 12. We are not vegans so I made them for my son's school lunches and added 1/2 cup of ham and 1/2 cup cheese diced.

Great recipe, it turned out very moist.   Since it is just my husband and I, most muffin recipes make far too much.   This was the perfect size and made 8 small muffins.   Instead of water, I used soy milk with a bit of lemon juice as suggested by another poster.

WOW!!!  These are delicious!!!!  My son has dairy and egg allergies and I couldn't believe how good these were!  Perfect!  I will definitely be adding this to the list of foods he can eat.  I couldn't tell a difference between these and cornbread with egg and dairy.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Made as a side dish to an all vegan mex themed meal. I doubled the recipe as the yeild says 6 muffins, no, I ended up with 20. These made the perfect side dish. I loved how smooth they turned out. All other corn muffins I've had seem to have a rule that they need to be mealy and with chunks of corn in them. These were slightly dense, but over all a good side!

I made a double batch and added about a cup of fresh blueberries. I made a couple of changes doubled the sugar (it's true some white sugar is not vegan) and used milled flax like another reviewer. I think if you use flax it's best to mix the flax and water and let it sit while your mixing the other ingredients and add it last. With these changes it made 21 regular sized muffins. I will be serving these with breakfast in the morning thanks for the recipe! So yum!

Just okay.  I'm still on a search for better corn muffins.  Be aware that the batter is very runny, but it cooks just fine.  Probably won't make these muffins again.

I didn't have any egg replacement and just added a small can of cream of corn.  it came out very moist, but still missing something.  perhaps a little more salt next time.  overall not bad for vegan.

Very good. I was looking for a dairy free recipe and so I just used 1 real egg instead of the egg replacer. It's not very sweet and makes a pretty crumbly bread. I sprayed a 8"x8" baking dish with non-stick spray and just baked the batter in there for 15 minutes. Came out perfect. Tastes great with soy margerine!

I used ground flax seed as my egg replacer.  I also reduced the sugar and oil to 1 Tablespoon each and added a generous Tablespoon of applesauce in place of the other Tablespoon of oil.  We ate it with beans and salsa served on top.  Was great with it.

I made these exactly according to the recipe as a test.  I did not care for this.  Reading the reviews, most people who liked them added/changed things.  The recipe as it is is bitter with too much baking powder, and i didn't like the texture or appearance.  i'll go back to my whole wheat honey corn muffins and try using egg replacer and soy milk in that recipe to make them vegan.

We are vegans solely for health reasons so we used an egg white. We added about 3/4 cup frozen corn. Easy, quick, and YUMMY!!!! Excellent with vegan chili!

These were good. The only change I made was the addition of a little vanilla extract. On a sidenote however, these muffins are not technically 100% vegan since they use white sugar.

My kids have various food allergies, including egg & dairy, so I was very excited to try these muffins.  I made them exactly as the recipe states - no changes.  They looked okay but needed help taste-wise.  I think they need more sugar to help the flavor.  They also have a strange aftertaste, maybe due to the egg replacer?  The consistency is good, though.  I was very excited to see a vegan recipe but unfortunately was disappointed.  Thanks anyway!

These turned out great!  Used real eggs instead of egg replacer and added more salt as suggested by other reviewers.  Very tasty and easy.  Thanks.

These were delicious! I used 1 tablespoon flax seed and 3 tablespoons water as another reviewer suggested. Baked for 15 minutes at 375 convection. Very moist and came out of the pans easily

Excellent base recipe. I changed it around to make it vegan and gluten free. For the half cup flour I used 1/4 cup almond flour, 1/4 cup Bob’s gluten free flour. Instead of white sugar I used raw organic, no bone char process. I added a 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup coconut milk, 1/2 cup water.

I made no changes, but the muffins stuck to paper. Next time I would either put in a pan or use tin for the muffins.

I did 2/3 corn flour and 1/3 corn meal for the corn flour portion. I cooked some corn in a caste iron skillet and poured the batter over it before baking in the oven. Was delightful with our chili!

Delicious! I only changed one thing. I used gluten-free all-purpose baking flour b/c that's what I had. These came out great! I will be further experimenting with this recipe: maybe using honey or other savory things. Also maybe I'll try soymilk instead of water as well. But all in all a great basic recipe and super easy and quick. As you can see from the pic, I couldn't help but to take a nibble...

Second time using this recipe today. My vegan friends really like it and requested I bring it to their party tonight. I doubled the salt, added diced chilis, and used coconut milk (or rice milk) instead of water. I also fried and cut up veggie dogs for an added effect. They are still a tiny bland to me so may add some spices or onion next time.

Absolutely perfect muffins!  I used chia for my egg replacement.  I wish I had read others modifications before making them-- I may have tried almond milk in place of water-- although they were delicious as made.
