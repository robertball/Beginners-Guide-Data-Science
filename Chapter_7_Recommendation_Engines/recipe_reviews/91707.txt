Yummy for your tummy! I had to increase the butter to 1 stick plus 2 tablespoons because the mixture was too dry otherwise. I used almonds and walnuts for the nuts and substituted milk chocolate chips for semisweet.  Super easy to make.  I did spray my pan with no-stick cooking spray and the bars came out very nicely. This is definetly a recipe I would make again.

This dessert is a hit! Everyone I share it with loves it!  I find that the 1/2 cup of topping isn't enough to cover the top of the dessert - so I had another 1/2 cup of oats, 1/2 cup of flour, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 2T of butter on top of what it calls for - to have enough for both the crust and the topping - and reserve a cup instead of a 1/2. Works like a charm!

Loved it!  I only had 3/4's cup of semi-sweet and it worked fine.  We added 3/4's cup coconut, too to the nuts & chips mixture.  All the other tips listed really would make a difference in the outcome of the bars.

Excellent!  The crust and topping is a little bit dry, and I would recommend you do what someone for the "Chocolate Chip Oat Bars"  (SAME RECIPE!!!) suggested - add at least 2 more T of butter.  (Only difference between the two recipes is the other one says "cold butter.")  The flavor is excellent and it is fairly easy to make.  I LOVED them.  A friend who doesn't generally like oatmeal (I didn't realize) really liked them.  My preschooler daughter thought they tasted like peanut butter and wouldn't eat them.  LOL  Overall, tasty and easy.  I will make them again for company.

This recipe is similar to the Magic Layer bars that my family loves, but a little less sweet.  I wasn't expecting to like it as much as the magic layer bars, but I did.  I used the pastry blender to cut the butter into the sugar and flour, incorporating the oats at the last minute.  I find that easier to mix the dry ingredients with the butter.  Also, when pouring the sweetened condensed milk over the crust, I try to keep it away from the edges so it doesn't harden onto the pan.  It's just easier to cut.  It's a little more work than the magic layer bars, but worth it.  Thanks for sharing.

The whole family loved this recipe even though I messed up on the directions (just didn't read carefully). I did not reserve any of the mixture for a top layer, so I just cooked it without a top layer. It was a great treat and easy to make - definite keeper!

These bars were good, very rich.  I felt there was a lot of condensed milk, and even after cooling, I had white milk oozing out when I cut into the bars.  My kids did like them and ate most of them, but we've had better bar recipes.

very rich and gooey. I did not have very much oatmeal mixture for a topping after making the bottom crust as written, but they turned out very yummy anyway.

My mom had an Eagle Brand cook book when I was growing up. This recipe was in it and is one of my favourites. I made sure to copy it out when I moved out! It comes together fast and is so yummy. I've never met a person who didn't like it. This is a recipe I turn to if I find out someone is coming over and I need something to serve to them quick. I almost always have all the ingredients on hand. I've never made changes to it, I don't think it needs it. I recommend cutting it after it's cooled a little, but is still warm, otherwise the edges can stick to the pan.

Great, easy recipe!  My husband doesn't like nuts, so I used cornflakes instead.  They worked just fine to give a little crunch.  These bars do dry out if they sit around too long.  I had a covered pan with 3 bars left that sat for 5 days over the long holiday weekend that were too hard to eat.  Key - don't make more than you'll eat in a few days.

I used this for a HS bake sale and omitted the nuts (too many kids with allergies these days) but added some Heath toffee bits in with the topping.  It got rave reviews!

These were pretty good as is. I would however add more flavors it's just chocolate and oats. Next time I'll try adding butterscotch chips or cherry bits or something.

I'd give this more stars if I could! I used coconut instead of nuts and from another review made extra crumbs for the topping. Thanks for the great recipe:)

wow so simple and easy to make I listened to the other reviewers and added an extra 2 tablespoons butter and mine turned out great... they got a little over done so I think the cooking time should be about 20 minutes... also these would taste great with some coconut sprinkled on for the the topping...

Wow! So yummy. After reading some other reviews I added a couple more tbsp of butter and put 3/4 of the crumb in the bottom, leaving 1/4 for the topping, then I melted a couple tbsp of butter and drizzled it on top of the topping. I also didn't have enough nuts (pecans) so I had to add some coconut. It was fabulous!!!

These bars are a huge hit at work!  I don't bother with the top layer of oats.  I don't measure the chocolate chips (I mean seriously, the more, the merrier) and I use pretzels instead of nuts.

This is delicious! I followed the recipe as written.
The tricks I used are:
1) line the pan with parchment
2) spread the crust thinly and then there is enough topping.
3) use Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk instead of heavy cream if you have it on hand, or regular condensed milk if that's what you have. 
I've made this two or three times now, and each time it comes out better.

I didnt have brown sugar so instead i used white sugar mixed with about 2 spoons maple syrup

and the nuts i had were peanuts - which i dont recommend using bc of taste, and used reg. choc chips but only about half as much recommend. 

overall i like the taste of these (even though im not a fan of condensed milk but had some in the panty needing to be used). thought they tasted much better after cooling down for a while
