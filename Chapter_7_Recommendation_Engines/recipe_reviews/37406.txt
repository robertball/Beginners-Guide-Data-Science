Very tasty! If you use a lower fat cream cheese it's pretty good for you, too! I liked the addition of fresh lemon juice...I personally liked the tart/sweet combo.

This is great! I added ranch dressing to the cream cheese for a little extra zing.

my husband took the apples off and ate them seperately, but i really liked them on the sandwich.  gives a great crunch.  we sometimes like to put butter on the and grill them, too.  oh and ham works well with this if you have it.

I didn't like this at all.  The texture was terrible.
