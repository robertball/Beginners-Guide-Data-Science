Wow! These are delicious! I hate regular sloppy joes, but I LOVE Philly Cheese Steak and these were spot on! Definitely drain your meat after browning. I’m sure that was implied, just not stated. I diced my veggies just so they’d distribute more evenly. The only thing I might change when I make these again (Oh, yeah! I’ll make them again) is to use regular white buns, only to make them more philly-like. But that’s just a preference. They’re fantastic as written. Thank you for sharing!!!!

Good but I used lean ground turkey and I think that affected the taste.  It was just so-so the way I made it.

The boys loved it. Good game day slop, pun intended, to feed the masses, and it tasted remarkably like an actual cheese steak. Nice twist.

Drain beef very well before adding water.
