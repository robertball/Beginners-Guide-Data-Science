I can't thank you enough for this recipe! I grew up in Kingston eating Dallas Hot Wieners as well as Uncle George's. Missed them so much. As soon as this sauce started to come together I knew it was close to the real thing. The smells brought me back to my childhood and the sauce did not disappoint!!

This isn't even edible, let alone close to the flavor of texas hots sauce.   The picture in this recipe looks exactly what I was after.  What this recipe produced, however, looked more like a red chili that smelled of vinegar and cinnamon.  I was hesitant so make this because the 6 cups of water sounded like a lot.  Even after reducing by half, it was incredibly bland.  Nasty stuff.

I grew up around Jamestown, NY and there's a place called AJ's Texas Hots and I've been to TexasHots in Wellsville, NY (must stop every time we go back home) and I have to tell you the truth about this recipe.  It's exactly the same if not better.  I made a double batch for company this weekend thinking they could take some home with them but there's no way my husband is giving it up.  The added bonus of the house smelling just like those amazing restaurants  was priceless. Thank you so much for this recipe.

It is called Texas HotDog sauce because it was created bythe TexasHot restaurant in Wellsville NY, grew up going there in the summers my grandparents lived and eating them fresh made in their restaurant this recipe is spot on!

Being from the Hudson Valley in NY, I knew exactly what it should taste like.  I have tried many different recipes trying to find just the right one.  This is perfect.  I didn't have any white pepper to add, but still tastes perfect.  Thanks for your work finding the right ingredients to put together.
