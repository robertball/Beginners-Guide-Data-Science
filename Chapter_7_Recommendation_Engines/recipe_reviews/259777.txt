Hi, I posted this recipe. The applesauce should be 1/2 cup. Since posting this recipe, I have amended it and increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups (one and a half). This makes the cookie less flat.

The first batch was too soft so I added more 1/4 C more flour. And another pinch of baking soda to the remaining batter. The rest cooked up much better.  Still a soft cookie, but not a pancake.  The flavor was excellent.  My daughter likes to eat the cookie dough, so great that it does not contain eggs. I will probably add a 1/2 C of flour to the whole batch next time. Or could decrease the coconut oil a little.

The recipe doesn't give an amount for the applesauce so I used 1/4 cup as a standard egg replacement.  I also added two tablespoons of molasses, 1 cup shredded coconut and 2/3 cup chopped pecans. The cookies are crisp on the outside and chewy inside. Perfect chocolate chip cookies.

Like others I used 1/4 cup applesauce, and instead of white sugar used truvia baking blend sweetener (equivalent was 2T and 2t).  Otherwise I just added to it for fun - 1/4 cup dutch cocoa, 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Came out rich and lovely.

I made  them twiceThe first time they came out horrible. So the second time I used some adjustment I substituted honey for brown sugar and I also added extra flour and  White sugar and they came out much better.

I make this recipe and I follow the recommendation  from previous comment to used 1/4 cup of apple sauce and I did.  I still need to add 1 tbs of flour because I find my mix to soft and came out perfect, however when I try I find for my self to sweet. I make some with dry cranberries for my husband he like it but he find it to soft but good. I divide the mix  in tree and my last one was cranberries with walnuts and oh yes! that one are very delicious, we both approved it!
