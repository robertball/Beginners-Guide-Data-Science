This recipe was great. I don't have a Dutch oven so after step 4, I put everything together in a crock pot on high for 3 hours.

I have been cooking with venison for many years.  This is the best venison stew recipe I have ever made.  The flavor was outstanding and the venison was tender and juicy.  Yum.

I liked this very much.  I added a few stalks of celery with the carrots and just a little more beef and chicken stock after the first hour but I probably could have just let it go.  I was worried that it would get dry but it didn't.  Wonderful flavors.

I've made a lot of venison stews, so for me to give this five stars means it is excellent.  I did make changes.  I halved the recipe because I didn't need to feed so many people.  I left out the anchovy paste.  I didn't have that hanging around the house.  I didn't bother with mushrooms.  It would have been nice, but I didn't have it on hand.  I added all the carrots and potatoes at the beginning before I put the dutch oven in the oven.  They were perfectly cooked, not overdone at all.  I think putting them in later would have left them underdone.  I adore venison, and this is definitely a recipe I saved!  By the way, my husband LOVED this.

Great recipe!  My only changes were to use sweet potatoes and turnips as I didn t have red potatoes or mushrooms.  The broth is rich, thick, and flavorful.  I think using at least one sweet veggie, like peas or sweet potatoes, is a nice counterbalance to the slight tang of the wine sauce.  I made this with freshly harvested venison after we forgot to grind a small bit.  Rather than dirty the freshly cleaned grinder, I opted for this stew.  This recipe has convinced me to put up more venison stew meat in the future.  Thanks!

As long as my brother keeps getting a deer every year, I will continue to use this recipe. No peas and left in oven an extra 30 minutes. Wonderful!

This stew is excellent! There is no need to look for another venison stew!  The venison was very tender and the gravy exceptionally tasty. I made a few small changes: I added some chopped celery with the onion, and I added a little sage and tarragon per another recipe on this site. It was also much easier for me to use all beef broth instead of using some beef, some chicken. I left out the mushrooms because I am the only person in my family who will eat them. They would have made a great recipe even better! 

I imagine this recipe could be adjusted some to thicken it further and be used as a filling for pot pie. 

I served this with cornbread and a salad. I will definitely make this again, and it will be my go-to when I have venison stew meat. Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe to make my first ever venison stew, and it turned out beautifully!  I rolled the venison in flour before browning instead of adding tablespoons of flour.  I also added one stalk of celery, and a couple of turnips (peeled & chopped) to the stew.  I cooked it in a dutch oven for about 2 hours 45 minutes.  My house smelled amazing and everyone loved it.  I'll definitely make this again.

Good flavor but SOOOOO watery. Not enough flour or something. I was so disappointed after spending so much time and effort to make this.

I made this stew per the recipe except I marinated the venison in coke over night. I used a large portion of neck meat so I was concerned the connective tissue would be chewy. Turns out I was probably worried about nothing but the coke did enhance the flavor in a subtle way. It's a keeper!

This was excellent, I will be making this again.
Everyone loved it!
I have a cast iron dutch oven, I might make this while camping. I put the cast iron dutch oven in my preheated oven, and cooked it in there.
It turned out awesome!

I also made this recipe in the crockpot but cooked it for 3 1/2 hrs because the potatoes weren't quite done. Served with Texas Toast and it was a delicious  meal for a snowy day.

So good!! Substituted white potatoes for sweet and added 1/2 cup red wine instead of 1 cup. I also fried two pieces of chopped bacon at the start instead of just adding 2 tbsp of butter, once the bacon was halfway cooked I removed it and added a 1tbsp of butter then added the venison. I readied the bacon once it was time for it to go back into the oven. I used a Dutch oven so it cut the cooking time in half. I put the stew in the oven without the sweet potatoes,  carrots and mushrooms for 30 minutes, then added them cooked for another 45 minutes, added the peas and cooked for another 10. I found I did need to add a little flour and water to thicken. But other than these small changes it was amazing and I will be cooking it again.

Wow, This is one of those "worth the trouble" recipes when every essence  is so deep, rich, and fragrant! I LOVE Chef John's recipes and looked specifically for these flavors to use with fresh venison, cut into 1 in chunks, seared as beef, turnips instead of potatoes (cutting carbs), about a 1/4 tsp cayenne, and homemade brown stock as a base, doubled mushrooms broiled in butter first, fresh thyme, I was out of basil so subbed fresh rosemary and a dash or 2 of oregano...everything else the same. Dayummmm, he "knocks it out of the park," AGAIN! Thank you Sir, you make me feel, "skilled"!

Absolutley amazing!  I added celery and cooked it in a slow cooker on high for 3 hours(as suggested by another user) but I did everything else exactly as the recipe called for.  My husband and I loved this dish, I will definitely be making this again in the near future.

This was great! I was looking for guidence in cooking Elk and this was perfect. We added parsnips and turnip, Hubby put the kibosh on the peas, followed the recipe after that and loved it.
