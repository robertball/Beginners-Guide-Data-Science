Excellent and succulent pork dish. I also added tree ear (a Chinese mushroom/fungus) to the cabbage/carrot mix. It was a big hit with my Chinese wife who doesn't see me cook a lot of native dishes. I would double the amount of marinade for next time and possibly add a little egg and huangjiu (Chinese yellow wine) in future.

Really good and easy recipe. I added some hoisin sauce for extra flavor. Next maybe will add some mushrooms or bean sprouts.

Made as written and this was good. I would have liked the flavor of the marinade to come out a little more so next time I will double the ingredients in the marinade. Good recipe!

I didn't make any changes and would make this often. A delicious  eggplant alternative!

The pork comes out so tender! Very nice flavor. See my note about adding pancakes for authenticity.

A good foundation recipe, but it needed more. More spice, more flavor, more texture. A great jumping off point.
