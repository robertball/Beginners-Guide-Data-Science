Amazing!! made a few changes to the recipe of my own. I used 2 tomatoes, 3 small red onions, and fresh mushrooms. I baked at 400 for 40 mins, I followed the advice of tinfoil and covering it while it baked, but next time (and there definately WILL be a next time) I will cook uncovered for the last 10 minutes to let some of the moisture evaporate. 5 stars as far as my company was concerned!

Absolutely no way should you ever cook salmon this long - an hour just killed it and it was just grainy and dried out.  I'd cook this for 20-25minutes and no more - it keeps cooking for a few minutes after cooking and slightly pink in the centre = a soft and juicy piece of perfectly cooked salmon.

I cooked this twice. The first time I followed the original recipe and I thought it was good. However, second time I followed some of the reviews and shortened the baking time and I have to say what an improvement. I think cooking it for an hour causes the salmon to lose its flavor a bit.

why salmon needs to be baked for so long time? 30 to 40 minues should be enough.

The cooking time is much too long. Another spice that should be added is dill. Dill wakes up fish like a train whistle at midnight.

Recipe for Salmon is delicious and I have used the same ingredients on  TALAPIA.  The 40 minutes works having the salmon steak cooked thouroughly.  Adjust time if a "THIN" piece.Try adding green peppers and a dash of dill...spray a little bit of olive oil and lemon juice..MMMMMM GOOD for sure

This was a good, basic fish recipe.  I skipped the tomato and mushrooms because I don't care for either of them and it was really good.  I didn't care for what the lemon slices did for the fish and they left a bitter aftertaste where they were sitting so I'll probably just squeeze the lemon over the fish next time.  Definitely a keeper!

So full of flavor.  We ate every last bite!  I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic to punch up the flavor.  Topped with parsley for a little flavor and to give a nice color.  I agree with the other reviews that 40 minutes of bake time is just right; doesn't need any more.

My husband and I loved this dish.  A light, summery, healthy meal!  I used fresh mushrooms and baked for 20 minutes, checked on it, and then put it back in for another 10.  Serving size was really only for 2 people - we didn't have any leftovers.  Will definitely make it again!

I love this salmon! I have made it twice now and normally serve it over cous cous. I have made some additions like adding a little balsamic vinegar, soy sauce and garlic. Next time, I want to try the dill addition that was suggested.

I followed this recipe exactly, and I thought the flavor was terrible.  I couldn't even eat the vegetables; I just pushed them aside and tried to make do with the salmon, which was edible but barely.  Maybe it's just my tastebuds, but I ordinarily love salmon and all of the ingredients in this recipe; it was just the combination that was terrible.

We loved this recipe!  I left out the mushrooms and the scallions.  I only had 1 filet, but cooked the whole hour and it came out so moist and delicious.  I will definitely cook salmon this way again!

This was really good.  I just did green onions, scallions, and kernel corn.  I too raised the temperature and dropped the cook time.

This was the first time I made salmon in the oven and it was great! I put a few sprigs of lemon thyme on top of the veggies and under the salmon. I also added just a little water to the bottom of the pan. I made some rice and once the fish was done I mixed the veggies into the rice and served the fish over it. It was delicious! You can do this with any variation of veggies or just place the salmon on a bed of fresh herbs. I agree with other reviewers who said the cooking time was WAY too long. I would NEVER cook fish for longer than 30 minutes, otherwise you end up with a very dry piece of fish. I did 30 minutes in a 350-degree oven.

I liked this very much.  Very easy.  Next time, I will take suggestion about using lemon juice or lemon pepper or maybe some white wine.  As far as cooking time, I cooked it in the toaster oven (my oven is not working) at 350 for about an hour, then took the aluminum foil off the top and cooked it another 10 mins.  The suggestion about capers was another good one.  I made 4 servings and have 3 left over for dinners the rest of the week.  I will definitely make this again.

I made a few changes to this recipe since it has already been heavily reviewed.  I Sliced all the vegetables, and added summer squash (I sautéed the onions for about 5 min to take the edge off).  I then layered the veggies in a 2 quart baking dish.  Place  the salmon on top, dabbed some pats of butter on them,then sprinkled fresh chopped Dill and placed sliced lemon on top.  I covered with Aluminum Foil and baked for 30 min, took the foil off and baked another 10 min.  We loved the dish!

I used this recipe, but I did some changes, I did not have lemon on hand, so I use about 1 Oz lemon juice, slice onions a little Worcestershire sauce, homemade salsa over the top, bake at 325 oven for 45 minutes. 
Fish can bake at a lower temp, the fish cooks evenly.

Easy and Delicious!  My four (small) salmon fillets weighed a total of 1 lb so I adjusted the baking time to 35 minutes.  Used a 9 x 13 baking dish.  Will make again.

This was quite good. I made my own changes to it, I used fresh mushrooms, half of a white onion and minced garlic. I also juiced a lemon and mixed it with olive oil, chopped basil (I use the freeze dried lighthouse kind) garlic salt and pepper. I poured that over the top.  I was baking it with something else, so I baked it at 425 for about 30 min. It was extra saucy, but I just spooned it over the top. It turned out incredibly tasty!

This recipe is amazing AND easy!! I used two tomatoes, omitted the mushrooms and butter, squeezed a lemon on top as opposed to the lemon slices, and only cooked it for 25 minutes on 325. It was delish!  Next time I will give the mushrooms a go. I will definitely make this again!

Really enjoyed it. Even my wife, not a salmon fan, thought it was tasty.

After making, I decided to add some lemon zest and cilantro the next time. Very good as is, but will be better.

I made this and it was great!  I went light on the onions since they give me trouble. I put lemons underneath, salted, followed by tomatoes and onions, and added parsley for color, and topped with lemons. I squeezed what was left of the lemon over the whole thing.  Baked for 40 min @ 375.

This is now my go to Salmon recipe.  Even my finicky daughter loved it.  It came out so moist.  I added fresh mushrooms, not canned.  I kept the recipe the same otherwise.  I may add a splash of white wine next time.  Keeping it covered is the key.

I made this with a few modifications. It was amazing. Instead of using butter I added slices of lemon underneath. Seasoned with dried parsley and chives, lemon slices and white pepper.  I poached it in foil.
