I don't know the first thing about making these traditional Salvi quesadillas. Since I happen to be married to a Salvadorean, I do know when they are good and not good. 
I came across this recipe and decided to make it. Folks, let me tell you that this is the real deal! It came out so moist and fluffy and not too sweet. And it was just as good the next day. I made the big 9x13 last night, and everyone just devoured it! 

Gracias Cipota!

What a deliciously different treat.  I will admit after the first bite, my taste buds were very confused, but not negatively. Parmesan, sugar butter.. dessert. I liked this a lot.. will make again.  I did use greek yogurt instead of sour cream since I had that.. came out fine

Delicious and authentic recipe! My mother's side of the family is from El Salvador. I recently moved from Los Angeles to a town in Oregon without any  Saldadorean bakeries. It came out perfectly. I ended up doing a repeat 2 days later because everyone loved it!. Best and easiest recipe for quesadilla around.

I've made this twice now and both results were awesome. The first time I made it I actually used all-purpose flour and I loved it. My husband was on the fence. The second time I used rice flour and he loved it (I actually preferred the first). 

Most people haven't heard of this bread and I took it to work and my coworkers loved it. 

Good job on the directions- found easy to follow.

The recipe was easy to follow and it turned out fantastic!  I used a combination of parmesean and cojita cheese.  This will definitely be made again soon!

I married into a Salvadorean family.  My mother in law was a great cook.  I have some hard shoes to fill.  Unfortunately she passed away right when my now husband and I were dating.  I felt awkward asking for her recipes when she was ill and in her death bed.  Ive made this recipe for the whole family and they all LOVE it.  My husband now said that this is his favorite recipe and always compares ANY quesadilla to this one.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this recipe that even some Salvi family members have asked me to share with them.  The instructions are so simple.  Once again thank you so much

Really simple recipe with great flavor. My husband(who is not from El Salvador) likes it better than the ones sold at el Salvadoran restaurants. I’ve made it several times now and it’s become a family favorite.

My family LOVES when I make these quesadillas for them. Best recipe for authentic quesadillas hands down. I was so upset when I couldn’t find your website anymore. I searched far and wide trying to find this recipe again. Alas, your recipe and I are reunited. Thank you! 

I’m first generation Salvadoran American and being able to make this treat for my aunts and uncles really bonds us together. ??

I surprised my wife is from El Salvador and made this quesadilla and she absolutely loved this authentic taste of her county.  Cheers for the recipe!  Thanks again.

This looks fabulous--thank you for sharing! One question I need to make it the night before for my son's presentation on El Salvador--do I need to refrigerate it overnight before serving in the morning?
