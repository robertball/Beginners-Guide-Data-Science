I used fresh veggies and a bottle of beer for extra liquid.  Still no leftovers.  Thanks!

Good start but I would increase vegetables and beef cubes.  Keep potatoes chunky and use beef broth to increase liquid.

This stew is great. I made it on the stove top and added beef broth and thickened it up with cornstarch. Super easy to make with very little prep.

Tasty. I used fresh veggies instead of frozen. And thickened it up a little with cornstarch. It was a nice change from the way I usually make stew.
