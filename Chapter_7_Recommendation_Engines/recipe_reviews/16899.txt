I made this recipe for Christmas dinner.  It received rave reviews.  I omitted the pate and in it's place made a pesto of 1/2 cup each tightly packed fresh basil leaves and fresh parsley leaves and 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese.  Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil, basil, parsley, Parmesan cheese and a pinch of salt in a food processor.  Process until smooth.  Spread this mixure over the beef and top with the onion and mushroom mixture.  To Die For!!!

I've made this twice now -- once with a whole tenderloin and this week with individual filets.  Personally, I prefer the individual filets, particularly when it's just two of us (makes for more manageable sizes of leftovers).  When doing the whole tenderloin, make sure you have a meat thermometer handy -- the baking times listed will get you to a rather red rare tenderloin, which may not be what you'd prefer.  I'd also recommend placing the wellington on a rack for baking, to keep the pastry out of the juices.  To do individual filets, I skipped the initial browning step, chopped the mushrooms rather than slicing them, skipped the pate (didn't have any on hand), and wrapped each filet separately.  We baked it at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes, which got the pastry just barely golden and the meat medium rare.  But again -- a thermometer is definitely helpful in this recipe!

I fixed this for a dinner party this weekend with individual filets and found it well worth my time, everyone loved them.  My only advice is make sure you buy the absolutely best pate you can afford and invest in a good cut of tenderloin; it will really make the difference in the overall quality of the dish.  My only other suggestion is use a rack to lift the filets off the bottom of the pan so that pastry doesn't become soggy from the pan juices.

I loved this and it came out great, but we like steak really rare, so what I did was sear two filets in a tablespoon of very hot oil for three minutes on each side, then let it cool before wrapping in the pastry. After that, I cooked it for 25 minutes as instructed and it came out perfect.

Very easy receipe. Guests loved it. Puff pastery much easier to work with than Phylo. Use plenty of flour when rolling out pastry to make it very thin if desired. Cooking times resulted in the desired medium-rare. This recipe of so easy, even for first-timers, I would recommend using it for individual filets for that VERY impressive fine dining restaurant look. Also recommend placing pastry covered meat on a rack in the baking pan to reduce the mushy bottom of entree due to juices.

i made this for an anniversary dinner for my parents.  Not being much of a cook, even the butcher laughed at me attempting this.  I made individual portions.  The key to keeping the bottom from getting too soggy is to add a small bit of cold toast that is rounded off with crusts cut off (so as not to tear the pastry.  This soaks up any juice keeping the bottom crispy.  No one was aware it was there, even after I'd told them. I also seared the meat in a frypan. Wonderful easy recipe that makes anybody look like a real chef!

I have made this several times and I have found use single filets. Much better in the end. I have found most people do not prefer the pate part so I substitute finely ground mushrooms/onions/garlic which works very nice. Also use pastry dough, I couldn't find it either first time. I finally found it in the frozen food isle on the bottom of the cooler in the frozen pie crust area. It will usually be in a long box. Much easier to work with than regular dough.

Absolutely wonderful! I made a suprise dinner for my English boyfriend and he loved it. I did not use pate, rather I added more butter, mushrooms and garlic. I also used an excellent cut of filet mignon. As mentioned by another cook, remember to use a wire rack to keep juices from soaking the bottom of the pastry.

I made this recipe last night for the first time and it was a big hit in my household.  I think however I will try it with individual filets the next time the presentation was less than average and it was difficult to serve.  I would also recommend browning the meat a little longer.  As much as I love my meat medium rare, it was very red in the center.  This is a keeper and I will be making it again.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!! Just some tips to improve: ° There's no need to mix butter with pate. Puff pastry has enough ;-) ° Cubed mushrooms to make it easy to slice when serving. ° Don't put filet on the oven, brown it instead over a hot thick grill, making one turn only for each side. The purpose of this step is seal the juices inside the loin, should not take more than 5 minutes to avoid cooking the meat. Remove from grill, and allow to cool completely. Deglasé grill with a little red wine, reserve. ° Assemble a rack over a jelly roll pan and place the roll over to bake to prevent juices make the pastry soggy in the bottom.  ° Final Note: Oven MUST be preheated before putting the roll in.

When looking for a recipe for Beef Wellington, I came across this one. Having read several rave reviews I decided to use it for a special birthday menu.  Based on recommendations made in the reviews, I chose to make the individual Wellingtons, and after a trial run, in which the meat was overdone, decided to alter the cook time.  So...I cooked 9 individual Wellingtons at 450F for 6 min. and then at 400F for 10 min.  The pastry was beautifully golden, and the filet was lovely and pink,  It worked perfectly.  I highly recommend it.  Enjoy!!

Made this today for a variant on the traditional Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it! It was so easy to prepare and didn't take a lot of time. Though I spent a good deal for the meat, I had simple sides that ended up going very well with the richness of the Wellington. I prepared my side and the Beef Wellington all in one pan which made for easier clean-up and less oven time. Here's what I did: I cut 2 1/2 to 3 lbs. potatoes into chunks, sliced two red peppers and some fresh asparagus,  added six cloves of crushed garlic. I tossed this altogether then spread in a 9 x 13 baking dish. I let this bake at 450 while I was preparing the Wellington. I then took the veggie dish from the oven, placed a small wire rack directly on top of the veggies and placed my fully prepared meat on top of that. I had already browned the meat the recommended 10 minutes, so I just let this bake 10 minutes more. After this, I removed the dish, placed the Wellington in the center of a large platter, then put all the roasted veggies around it. It was very pretty and took less room on the table. This timetable produced a rare center which was very tender and tasty. I took the advice of one reviewer and marinaded my beef in balsamic vinagrette. Though this is an expensive dish, it is well worth it for very special occasions and when you really want to impress!

Oh my, was this an attractive & delicious Christmas meal centerpiece! What we did different: We used a 3-1/2# tenderloin (fed 8 people) which we halved & rubbed with salt/pepper/garlic powder the night before, then quick seared in a hot skillet; added 2 small cloves of garlic to the mushroom/onion mixture, & once it cooled chopped it all very finely to almost make a duxelles (since we did 
NOT want to use liver pate). We layed prosciutto on the pastry, spread the mushroom mixture over, then placed the beef on top...placed it on a preheated sheet & baked as directed to 130 degrees then allowed it to rest 15 minutes (while we heated up the side dishes). It was perfectly med/rare! I believe cooking it on a rack wouldn't allow the bottom crust to crisp up as much, all I know was that this was not as hard as I thought it would be so DON'T BE INTIMIDATED, so much more delicious than I dreamed it would be & is sure to be my new Christmas dinner tradition - YUM!!!

This is a good recipe and a variation of the French Filet en Croute which I learned from my grandmother while growing up in Normandy. The beef was always the chateaubriand, the choicest cut of the Filet Mignon and was first seared in Black Butter and soaked in Calvados (Brandy) which was allowed to evaporate before being wrapped in raw ham which was covered in a paste of morrelle mushroom, dijon mustard and goose liver before being wrapped en crote and glazed with beaten egg yolk and score and decorated before being baked in a preheated 400F, 200C or Gas Mark 6 oven for 40 minutes. Done properly the juices will remain within the package and the croute will be crisp on the outside and creamy in the inside. A medium body Burgandy is suffice to accompany. The English Beef Wellington is still a good recipe.

This was excellent!!  I made this for our Christmas dinner and, per several different reviews, made only a few slight changes. First, I did individual filets for the purpose of portion control.  I salt and peppered and seared them for several minutes.  I sautéed the mushrooms and onions in butter but added the red wine to let it reduce with the veggies. I also added worcester because it's just so yummy. I assembled, baked and oh my goodness, we had a fabulous dinner!!

I held a hugh dinner party and figured that Beef Wellington would be a hit.  It was a true scucess.  The only change I made to the recipe was I marinated my prime cut of Beef Tenderloin in Balsamic Vinegar and spices to insure a juicy meat.  I also cooked for 20 minutes instead of 15 and it came out perfect medium rare.

This was FABULOUS. I have never had, nor made Beef Wellington before - but what I made tonight turned out stunning and there were raves all around. I used Sirloin instead of fillet minion - for budgetary concerns - I also took the advice of post reviewer and used a home made pesto instead of the pate. One more thing - we cut the meat into individual serving sizes before wrapping them up into their won pastries - and it turned out superb. i would and will totally make this again.

Cooking time is incorrect.  I added 20 minutes and it still was bloody rare!  Add about 40 minutes to cooking time.  The pate' is a must!  It was good, but not worth the time and effort.

This as wonderful. I used individual Filet Mignon to serve 4 people (1 lb). Since I did this for an elegant dinner each person had a 4 oz piece. Good for portion controllers too! This is what I did a little differently:  I did not bake the steak. Instead, I seared it 2 minutes on each side on high heat on a skillet with the butter. Instead of using pastry sheets, I used puff pastry SHELLS.  I placed the steak on a middle of the cookie sheet and had the shells surrounding it. Baked everything at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. I let everything cool for 5 minutes and then cut each filet in half. Thsi gave me 4 pieces, around 4 oz each. I then plated in this order: pastry shell at the bottom, filet, mushroom mixture, pate, pastry shell.  This not only kept the pastry crispy but it was also more beautiful, I think, than wrapping it with pastry.

i have tried many recipes for beef wellington and this is by far the best.  sometimes i do a whole tenderloin and other times individual filets which are much easier.  to find out the way you like it the best play with filets and the cooking times and when you put the puff pastry on we cook a little longer for medium before putting the puff pastry on. i dont use the liver pate and i dont think it really changes the wonderful taste of the dish.  i make it every christmas for 16 people.

This dish was so flavorful and to die for! However, I tweaked it quite a bit for my own liking:

1. Instead of liver pate, I used a chicken/beef pate in a can and mixed worshershire sauce in it.

2. For my mushroom mixture, I minced the mushrooms, garlic, parsley and a splash of sherry.

3. Instead of puff pastry, I used 4 large sheets of philo dough and glazed with butter.

4. For the sauce, I added butter and zip sauce into the wine & broth.

Tips: Pre-heat pan in oven before placing wellington inside - did not get soggy on bottom at all!!

I was nervous about trying this recipe because it is one of those things that I've always loved and wanted to make but it seemed intimidating.  I am SO glad that I finally went ahead with it.  I made it almost 100% to the specified recipe except for adding some red wine to the mushroom/onion mix.  I used the pate, and I'm very glad I did.  It added another (delicious) dimension to the dish.  Thanks very much, Normala, for providing a wonderful and easy-to-follow recipe.  I'm so glad I tried it.  The family loved it.    One hint on the leftovers if you do a whole tenderloin instead of individual wellingtons...since the middle of the roast will be very rare at this cooking time, serve the end pieces the first night.  The next night, slice the Wellington into individual slices and lay them in a pan, cut side up.  Put a tiny pat of butter on each fillet and bake at 375 for about 15 min.  mmmmmmm

I have always wanted to make Beef Wellington and I found this recipe, VERY GOOD! I think the most consistent remark is adding flavor, which I always "Dr." things to taste anyway.  I would recommend doing just that for this recipe.  Do a simple rub (S&P, 1/2 clove of garlic lanced into each medallion)on the filets first, add the sautéed onions and mushrooms to the red wine and beef stock; I also added a teaspoon of rosemary and a tbsp of Worcestershire to the sauce.  I did individual wellingtons with 4 filets and placed the pate and  onions and mushrooms on top of the filets as well.  Having made it once it will forever be etched into my memory and I cannot wait to make it again!!!

I prepared this the night before, following directions carefully and baked it on a rack to avoid soggy bottom layer. Overnight, I left it in fridge, on an oven ready serving dish, lightly covered in aluminum foil.  The next day, I removed it from fridge for about 30 minutes and then put it in oven, at 300 degrees for 15 minutes, covered in foil, to avoid overcooking crust.  It was delicious!  next time i would let it sit at room temperature closer to 45 minutes and then put in oven.  Spray the rack so it is easy to pry off the puffed shell.

This was my first Beef Wellington. I made exactly to recipe except the following: 1 1/2lbs. beef tenderloin, chopped onion & mushrooms, substituted sausage for liver pate - gave a nice flavor & couldn't find pate. Next time I will set the individual filets further apart so I can serve each separate and place the Wellington on a bakers rack to prevent the pastry on the bottom from getting soggy with the juices. YUM!

This is the easiest and most delicious Beef Wellington recipe I have ever tried. We loved it. 
I couldn't find pastery dough so  I used Pillsbury dinner rolls and rolled it and wrapped it around the tenderloin.

This was such an easy recipe and was delicious!  I seared the individual filets for two minutes on each side and baked them for 20 mins on 400.  They came out to a perfect medium!  I can't wait to make again!

My fiance while watching Chef Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen has had a craving for Beef Wellington, we even found a cute Scotish Restaurant that we thought served it but it ended up just being a pot pie.  Well this receipt was fantastic!!!! changed up the liver pate for proiscutto as some have done.  Seared the meat for at least 5 minutes on both sides and OMG it was worth every cent i spent to make it...this is definiately one of my favorite receipts that i ever made..TY so much for sharing.

I have tried this with both the pastry puff and philo and the puff is definately better. I also used a substitution on the pate since my family is picky. I used garlic, onion, red and green pepper, basil, parsley and parm cheese mixed with olive oil and a little s/p. Came out tastey.

I made this with two individual filets for my husband and me.  We both really enjoyed it.  We did not get the overly pate taste that some of the other reviewers complained about.  The only difficulty that I encountered was the seams on the pastry separated while baking.  I thought that I had sealed them well.  If anyone has any suggestions as to how to get the seams to stay sealed, I would appreciate hearing about it.

I don't know if I did a thing wrong but this was so bad that i could not eat it. The puff pastry was so thick and heavy on the outside. The beef tasted like liver. It was too much work for it to turn out so bad.

Very good....need to cook the meat more!  I have made this 3x and the last time I used individual filets.  This way I could address peoples different tastes of Rare..to Med Well.  This is a very easy recipe..just a lot of steps and a lot of clean up.  But we Love it!!

After years of watching Hell's Kitchen, I was always interested in making Beef Wellington.  This was surprisingly easy and tasted great.  The meat can be baked to any guest's preferences by removing pieces earlier for the rarer requests.  Definitely keep the wrapped meat on a baking rack to keep the wrap crisp.  I placed the dish on the lower rack to keep the pastry from over baking.  I recommend keeping the liver pate in the recipe.  It added a nice flavor to the meal.

Absolutely delicious. I followed the cooking times to the last minute and it come out a nice medium rare. I also didn't bother to let the beef cool before I wrapped it in pastry and it was fine. I also followed the advice from the reviews and baked it on a wire rack.

This turned out delicious and tender! My suggestions. Use filets of tenderloin and wrap individually. Sear filets on med high heat beforehand and it comes out perfectly. (Trust me, I'm a meat perfectionist:)

Great flavor!  I made this for my husband's birthday and he loved it.  Large servings if you follow the recipe.  I used 2 - 8oz. tenderloins.  I didn't use butter on mine, which took longer to brown, and mushrooms were chopped instead of sliced.  I couldn't find liver pate so after talking to the butcher I used Braunschweiger and it tasted wonderful!!  The pastry did get a little soft on the bottom, but still tasted great.  I didn't make the sauce and thought this did fine without it.  I was impressed this worked out as well as it did.  I did have to extend cooking time because the meat was pretty rare - thermometer is a must to prepare this dish.  Definitely worth a try!!

I used this recipe to create a very similar recipe.  I used pastry shells instead of sheets and omitted the pate.

Cut 2 ½ lb. Beef (filet) into bite size pieces.  Fry in 2 tblsp. Butter until Done (About 10 minutes).  Fry in 2 tblsp. Butter until Done
½ Large onion, chopped fine in food processor.
Package of sliced portabella mushrooms, chopped
1 tsp. Jar Garlic.  Add meat to onion mixture.  Cook on low just to keep warm.  Bake 12 Frozen Puff Pastry Shells 400 for 20 minutes.  When pastry shells are finished put on dinner plate.  Take tops off each.  Fill with meat and onion mixture.  Serve with 10 oz. Frozen spinach fried in 2 tblsp. Butter and ½ tsp. Jar garlic.

This recipe was fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the pate portion.  I did not have any so I skipped that part.  The recipe was loved by every single person.  I made the red wine and beef broth sauce but no one even used it because they enjoyed the Beef Wellington on its own merits!  Great recipe!

I made this for my husband on Valentine's Day, and though I cooked the beef more than I normally would have, it was a huge hit!!!!!!  I even used the liver pate which amazingly brought out all the other flavors, and hid the liver taste.  If I could delete my husband's memory, I would do this every year, because it's relatively simple for how fancy it looks.  I even cut little hearts out of the pastry and put them on top for an extra Valentine's Day feel.

What a woderful meal this makes! You have a delicious cut of beef, mushrooms and onions to enhance the flavor and then the pastry closes off the beef to the air keeping all those aromas, flavors and juices inside! I did find out that by adding a bit of roasted garlic and a bit more onion really adds to the already delicious flavor. And the pastry, with the juices it soaks up from the slicing, is great!

Great recipe. I omitted the pate, and instead used chopped mushrooms and onion sauteed and seasoned. Olive oil in place of butter. I also precooked the tenderloin for an extra ten minutes since I prefer my beef medium-well. An added plus was pre-marinating the meat for extra flavor. If you don't have a rack to cook it on, you can use a broiler pan instead to avoid sogginess, but be sure to spray it with a little Pam for easier removal.

Excellent recipe! Made this for my Dad on Father's Day. Dad will subject the family to hours of scouring foreign cities in hopes of finding a beef wellington on the menu, so I knew this would be the perfect meal.

He was amazed that I would actually attempt to make this since it is a bit labour intensive and raved for days on end how great dinner was.

Suggestion: Place a thick slice of pate on top of beef filets instead of mixing the pate with butter and coating the meat.

Wow! This was so good.
Very easy and not too time consuming.
Very fancy presentation.
I omitted the pate, since most said that it was overpowering.
I think next time I will add some spices though. 
We will surely have it again!

Excellent recipie! Thanks alot, my english boyfriend loved it! I made it for 2, so I asked my butcher for the cooking time on a smaller piece (500g/1.1 pounds) I browned the meat then baked for 25 mins and rested for 10. Perfect!

I made this dish for Christmas and I was a bit nervous because everyone responds to Beef Wellington like it's some kind of super difficult Moby Dick type of meal.  I loved this recipe!  It came out perfect and was so easy to make.  Easier than any turkey, duck or prime rib I've ever made for a holiday meal.  I will caution those of you who don't like pate.  If you don't like it, don't use it.  The flavor of the pate was very prominent, which was fine by me because I like pate.  I only made one adaptation ... I used individual fillet mignons because I made it for two people.  Other than that it was perfect.  I will definitely make this one again.

I can't wait to try this recipe and I am giving it 5 stars because of its simplicity. For those who changed it or didn't like pate, get real. That is what Beef Wellington is about. It is elegant, it is formal, and the few times I have had it "it is to die for." I will try this recipe next week.

I made this for my wife on Valentine's Day.  We ended up ordering a pizza.  I have no clue what "puff pastry" is, nor did my grocer.  She suggested that I use filo dough, which I did.  What resulted was a filet mignon that tasted like fried liver and pastry dough.  It is a shame that there is only one recipe for Beef Wellington here, so we are all sort of stuck with this one.  Live and let learn.  Additionally, this meal was far to expensive to make and having to see it go wasted, dampened my spirits further.

This is the best recipe for Beef Wellington ever! Definitely use the pate even if you think you will dislike it, it adds so much depth to the flavor. I used a peppered duck pate and it came out fabulous. I also used individual fillets instead of the large tenderloin - much nicer presentation! Definitely will make again and again!

I made this Christmas day and it was delicious! The only adjustment I made was less onion and more mushrooms. I highly recommend this recipe!

Made this tonight for my boyfriends birthday. We both loved it!! I made the individual filets, since there are only two of us eating. Despite the amount of work involved, it was totally worth it! I did omit the pate, and added some port wine and shallots to the mushroom/onion mixture.   Will make again!

I used this for leftover beef tenderloin. Used liverwurst with no butter, instead of liver pate and butter. Did not make wine/beef broth mixture. Turned out tasty and delicious!

I tried this recipe for my mom for Mother's Day-its her favorite.  I've never made it OR tasted it before.  I used a bigger (3 1/2 lb.) tenderloin and increased the initial baking time by 10 min. and last baking time by 5 min.  It turned out perfect!  I seasoned the meat before baking and used a pate made from liverwurst(a recipe can be found on this site, but I used onion powder instead of chopped onions)-I found it did not take over the flavor of the beef-everyone agreed it added to it.  I also added the red wine to the mushroom/onion mixture like others on the site.  I forgot to buy beef broth but I had some powdered beef boullion & used that instead--I added some seasoning to it and it was really good.  All in all, the meal turned out phenomenal--my mother said it was better than the restaurant she goes to and my father, children and husband LOVED it.  The only thing I would've done different is make this into individual pieces due to it slightly falling apart when sliced.  This recipe is to die for!  Thank you so much!

Wow. What a lot of work. It was good but I won't do it again. If you want to impress someone, wow! I personally just didn't like the crust and the beef. Too much. I did add a splash of sherry to the mushrooms (very good). Also, I made roasted shallot sauce (from this site) and I highly recommend it.

My first attempt at Wellington, and it was quite a success.  I think part of the key though is to spend a few dollars and get a very nice piece of tenderloin. It would be very difficult to slice through this without it falling to pieces if the meat were even slightly tough - the presentation DEPENDS on it keeping together nicely. Delicious!  I used a "spreadable peppercorn pate" and it had a nice little pepper kick.

I have made Beef Welington many times before so I am familiar with the process and what the outcome should be. The timing and temperature in this recipe is perfect. I made it twice in a week, once with a 2 1/2 lb tenderloin and the second time with a 6 lb tenderloin. It was perfect each time. The first browning in the oven is key.  Resist the temptation to keep the beef in longer than 10 minutes for the small roast. Cooling between each step is essential as well. The assembly is quick and the final roasting is 25 minutes regardless of how big the roast is. (because the thickness is the same) Once the pastry is uniformly brown, take it out and let it sit for at least ten minutes.

I agree that the cooking time is off for this recipe. I had a 1 lb tenderloin that I seared first then cooked in the oven at 425 for 15 mins and it came out a perfect medium rare. Thank goodness I read the other reviews! 

To keep the pastry from getting soggy I drained the mushrooms and onions really well by putting it in a strainer and pressed down on it with a spatula to get rid of all the liquid. I then used the leftover liquid for the sauce which was divine! I saw a video that had Gordon Ramsey cooking beef wellington and he mentioned mushrooms hold a lot of water so instead of cooking off the liquid I just drained it. 

Great, simple recipe!

Made this for my loves--BF and two teens for Valentine's day.  They thought it was something super special.  The pate makes a huge difference don't skip it even if you have to buy it canned (which i did). The packets were so pretty before and after you cut into them.  I was so proud of my presentation that I facebooked the pics :)

I used this recipe on pork tenderloin and it was fabulous! I didn't use the sauce, but my husband and I honestly didn't need it. This recipe was absolutely wonderful. Other than the sauce I followed the recipe in it's entirety. I was worried about how the patte would taste, but it was excellent. I would use a rack within a pan next time to keep the bottom from getting soggy, I just didn't have one at the time. Even with a soggy bottom though, this recipe was a hit! I can't wait to try it with beef.

Great!  Made individual ones using 3 oz filets (omitting the pate), and they turned out flaky and delicious.  Wonderful with a comforting side like mash potatos.

My boyfriend loves Hell's Kitchen and this is a dish made on the show a lot I have had this recipe saved for over a year on my list. I made it for the first time Yesterday and it turned out great!!! I did not use the pate however as others suggested proscuitto worked well and the searing helped as I like my meat cooked!!! Boyfriend loved it and having it for leftovers tonight:-0 Thanks for putting up the recipe.

as a substitution for anyone not liking pate, lay slices of proscuitto out flat, spread the sauteed mushrooms out  and wrap it around the filet/tenderloin.  Definitely reccomend searing the meat first

This was my Christmas treat for my old folks. You know the kind of thing?  Come to mine for Dinner Mummy & Daddy, nothing fancy, just a hearty meal...  Boy Was i wrong!!! 

This is fancy, Very fancy, and what is more it is stunning!  The beef was so tender and juicy that you would struggle to find better in a restuarant of the highest standing, and the presentation is pretty awesome too.  

If this one is not in Your recipe Box, then for heaven sake ADD IT!!!  Not my skills that made me a hero to my folks, but plainly just following this recipe.  Yes boys and Girls you could be a hero too!!!

P.s.  Young guys out there keen to woo your lady friends this is an absolute must...  as long as they are not vegitarian of course.

Made this yesterday for our 13th Wedding anniversary and it was a hit!  My wife adored the Beef Wellington and me.  As with other reviewers I did use Filet Mignon verses the tenderloin.  This is an awesome meal that you can adapt to your tastes easily.  Thank you for sharing!

Delicious!  Instead of the rather simple wine sauce in the recipe I made a Madeira sauce to go with the wellington.  Definitely a keeper!

I added too much dough.  Next time only one sleeve of the phillo dough.  The beef needs to cook just a little bit longer for our taste.

The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because I just don't like pate.  I know that pate is standard with Beef Wellington, and I hoped my taste had changed, unfortunately, no chance.  We scraped the pate off the leftovers and made sandwiches the next day...now those were good!

I've made this recipe several times, but used individual filet mignons, leaving off the bacon and omitting the pate. I cut the puff pastry into fours. It is simple and very filling. I've used it for small dinner parties as well as for quick, yet elegant dinners. It makes a wonderfully tasty meal. I typically serve it with homemade mashed potatoes with skins, fresh veggies, and a fresh greens salad.

I made this for my hubby on Valentines  ...he loves Beef Wellington but hadn't had it for a very long time.  He absolutely loved it ...said it was the best meal I ever cooked.  The only thing I did differently was I pureed the mushroom and onion mix and then mixed it the pate with it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was great, the meat was NOT DONE, I removed it from the "shell" and baked longer, it was still great. Next time I'm going to use individual filet mignon and probably brown longer, I want it pink in the middle not blood red! The flavor is SO AWESOME! Looking forward to making again!

Although I do not eat beef, I prepared this dish for Sunday night family dinner, we always have extended family over on Sundays.  Everyone loved it...even said it was the best dish I had ever served,and I pride myself and never skimp on my cooking. Prepared as noted except the pate...didn't have it, but it didn't seem to make a difference with the like factor.  My hubs wants to try it next time with the pate to compare.  Thanks!

Wow! This was amazing. Made it with the "Pesto Sauce" rub on the outside like the "most helpful" reviewer said. Holy Cow! I had never made this before, but it came out great. Did 12 minutes for the first cycle, then 12 minutes at 450, and 13 minutes at 425. It came out about "medium" which was perfect for my wife and I. Really, really yummy. This was my first beef wellington. Thank you for showing me a way to do it!

Note: with all of the butter usd mine smoked up the oven a bit, and subsequently the house. Not sure how to avoid the smoke with the high temps in the oven. Maybe I can find some info on that somewhere here. It still tasted awesome though!!!

This is a great recipe; you can omit the pate and make your own spread with mushrooms, etc.  I have done a similar recipe using a boneless pork loin (made individual servings) and encased in filo dough.  Will dig out the recipe and post soon.

Once again a total winner - have variations which I will send to you when I have time - am 67 so lots of experience - yours was great.  
To the ladies who complain - surely you should all know 'rare' cooking time = my oven i dial up and ask for rare fillet - it gives it 7 mins and voila = eat

This was wonderful! I had heard that wellingtons were difficult to make, but this recipe made it easy. The only thing I would change next time is I would do the the full 15 minutes (I did about 11) when browning because mine came out a little rare for our taste in the middle. I would also like to say thank you Mrsmac because we took her advice as a replacement of the pate because most of my family hates liver. It was soo good! Thanks

Made this for Al's Birthday.  Brant loved it but Al was not crazy for it.  Said it was very rich.  Made it without the pate but did put irish butter on top of meat along with muchrooms.  I loved it.  Only need small portion.

This was great and way easier than I thought it would be. We used a cheaper roast rather than tenderloin and it turned out great still. I think next time I will use a bit more pate and perhaps a smaller onion, and it might be fun to try the individual sizes some people have done. Either way this is a keeper!

My partner and I thought this was fantastic. We both love meals that look fancy but when you get down to it aren't really that difficult, step-by-step.  However, we did make a substitution, we're not big mushroom fans so I changed them with cashews and it turned our fantastic!  If mushrooms are stopping you from making this then go for cashews.

Excellent flavor - all components worked well together!  The only problem is that my cut of tenderloin was very thick and did not cook in the time specified - even though we prefer rare meat, this was completely raw.  I plan to try longer in the oven bag next time.

This was a very good recipe, but I prefer my filet mignon with a different sauce. I placed my wellingtons on a rack which made a huge difference because the whole thing was nice and flaky.

This fell apert on me, but that was my fault - I didnt wrap them properly. It all tasted good - the meat was cooked perfect medium rare, but a steak pie would have similar and would be much easier to make. One to impress for a special occasion but I couldn't make this regularly.

I guess I just don't see what the big fuss is.  It tasted okay, but I've had much better. It was definitely lacking in the flavor department.  You know it's sub-par when my husband thinks of ways it could have been better (maybe if we GRILLED the steaks first..)  All in all it wasn't AWFUL (when is filet mignon awful?) but honestly, I think it could be improved a lot.

Thanks Normala for this recipe.  It was a big success on New Year's eve for our party of six.  I made individual portions and used the left over pastry to make initials for each portion. My guests were all impressed and loved it.  My British guests said it's better then what they had back home in the fancy hotels. I used store bought pork pate and it turned out really well, adds another layer of flavour.  I will definitely make it again.

Sorry to give this 3 stars. Maybe it's me, maybe it's the pate. My husband loves beef wellington so I thought this would be a good suprise. Followed recipe exactly and all I could taste was the pate. My husband said the same "too strong". I've come to the conclusion that I don't like pate; period!

I used a broiler pan to help keep the pastry from becoming soggy---worked wonderfully!  I'm not a big liver fan, however my husband loved it.

I have made this dish twice and loved it both times. The first time I couldn't find the puff pastry dough and used filo dough instead. The second time I used the puff pastry dough. I actually liked the Filo dough better :) But both were superb and looked wonderfull.

This recipe was superb!  Much easier than the version I tried a few years back.  The only adjustment that was made was additional wine in the beef stock.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and we couldn't get enough!

I prepared this recipe for a dinner party for friends, many who had travelled abroad and they all said it was the best they had ever tasted.  My husband and I both enjoyed preparing the dish and enjoyed serving it since it smelled marvelous while cooking.  Timing was perfect for a medium rare center.  My hate's off to the chef!!

2/14/00  Marla, I made this for valentines' day for my husband, and cut out little heart shapes of puff pastry, to add to the pastry top of the wellington.  I tell you, this tastes great! and looked pretty nice also!  I especially loved the wine au jus. Fabulous! pretty easy to assemble. I used fillet mignon instead of the tenderloin, (a little more costly) but I cut each fillet in half, and it turned out great.  My hats off to you marla!!!  thanks again and Keep the recipes a comin!!!!

01/01/01: What a way to ring in the REAL New Millennium! Even though we made it without the liver pate', it was dynamite! Neither my husband nor I had ever had this dish before so it was quite an experience.  The directions were quite good, except we had never worked with phyllo dough before and weren't quite sure how to handle it.  As I was buttering each ultra thin sheet I thought, "I'm not sure I'd go through all this again."  The first bite quickly erased that thought from my mind.  We rate new recipes on a scale of 1-10 (10 being THE best). A recipe rated 8 and under gets tossed. THIS IS A DEFINITE "KEEPER!"  Thank you so much, Marla!!!  Keep those yummy recipes coming!

Deeelish!! Followed recipe very closely, just used a little smaller cut and browned a little longer in the beginning as I didn't want it too rare and have the puff pastry get too brown if I it needed it in there longer.  Cooked it to an internal temp of 140 F when I took it out to rest at the end for 10 minutes. The pan jus was also good, though pretty salty since the butter I used in the browning process was salted...so added a bit of water then thickened with wondra flour for a bit of a thicker consistency. I didn't have a wire rack, so just used the one from my grill and put that over a cookie sheet! Worked perfectly!

I have made this recipe (or this slightly tweaked) for more than a decade, typically on Christmas.  Delicious.  A lot depends on the quality of the beef.  I find that the hardest part of this is getting the pastry to work.  Here's my tip:  have plenty of puff pastry.  Roll it out and place the bottom part in the baking dish, which has been buttered.  Spread pate on pastry, cover it with mushroom and onion mix, then place meat on top.  Cover top and sides of meat with pate, then mushroom and onions.  Finally, place a separate piece of pastry on top, and connect by crimping the sides.  Much easier than trying to cover the whole thing with one piece then transferring to baking dish.

Great, but I followed others advice.  I used onion, garlic and mushrooms around the  beef, instead of the pate mixture.

This is a stellar recipe, which a friend and I made for a reunion of a dinner club (we hadn't met for over 30 years!). The recipe is relatively easy to prepare if you watch the video a few times, read the allrecipe reviewers comments, and start with a quality tenderloin. We used a meat thermometer, cooked the Wellington on a rack in a pan, and did use the pate. The flavour was exceptional - the slices weren't the easiest to cut so I might let it stand a tad longer the next time, or make individual servings as others have suggested. From another site, a suggestion was made to put the uncooked but prepared Wellington in the fridge for a few hours, which we did - so the times given (needless to say) were off, but that's another reason why the meat thermometer was so helpful. A great recipe for a reunion dinner club - all the people in attendance raved!

If you aren't a pâté fan, you can substitute with humus. Also, I've used a mixture of cooked carrots, onions, and garlic that I'd strained and mashed instead of pâté.

This was absolutely delicious! I had trouble finding pate and puff pastry shells so I omitted the pate and used flaky crescent rolls for the shell. Delicious and very easy. Will definitely make again!

Pate was tasty addition to this recipe....Next time I'm gonna stuff the filet with a seafood mix of lobster tail  crab meat (not the imitation stuff) and top it off with some Brie or Gruyere cheese. Then wrap with puff pastry. I'll post when I complete this dish. Will be making this over and over.

The Filet ended up being a bit well done, and the pastry a bit underdone... But I prefer my steaks cooked more so I enjoyed it, the flavor on the mushroom topping was delish!

Absolutely devine!  The only "mess up" was on the puff pastry.  My husband picked up the puff shells, so as you can imagine I had a time trying to get the meat wrapped.  My store did not have regular liver pate so I used Mushroom/liver pate instead.  And a bit of advise, if ones are looking for more of a cordon bleu recipe I'm sure there are plenty on this site.  This is an ellagant recipe and it is what it states, Beef Wellington ;) Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  Will definalty make again ;)

Well it came out looking exactly like the picture. But frankly it didnt come up to expectations. I was expecting something cordon blue- an exquisite belnd of choicest ingredients to make a sonata of the senses. Instead I got a very middling bit of roast. Something that I would have expected to find in a Fanny Cradock Recipe Book. Thank goodness things have moved on a bit from then. I 'll stick to slow roasting with rosemary garlic and honey glaze. Sorry really wanted this to be special- very much the opposite.

Delicious, but we found that the meat needs to cook a little longer at the beginning and that it can be difficult to get the pastry even, had just mirowaved each slice an additional minute, though, and it was perfect! Yummy with the pate!

Very impressive dish.  I, like other reviewers, made two individual portions using filet mignons.  I also seared my filets in the pan before wrapping and baking, rather than pre-baking.  My only issue is that I believe I seared mine for too long, because my beef came out more like a medium instead of a medium rare.  I did put the wrapped filets on a rack, but the bottom of the pastry was still a bit soggy.  This was just fine, however.  This would be very impressive at a dinner party and I will definately be making this again.

I make beef wellington and this version  with omitting the pate and making  the  pesto instead  was incredible.And just for the sake of time I use the already rolled out pie crust sheets and cut to fit properly being careful not to overlap too much...The pesto spread is amazing..Another reviewer wrote  this also.

I was disappointed with the end result flavour of this recipe. I should have taken the advice given by some and omitted the pate/butter mixture and replaced it with something that had more zing. I even lit my tenderloin with cognac after I seared it.....it just seemed to be missing something in the flavour department. I much prefer Chateaubriand!!

Oh WOW!   I made this for a special Valentines Day dinner and it was GREAT.  I used a pesto of parsley, basil and cheese in lieu of the pate (which I cannot buy in this area).  This is the best thing I have ever cooked.  Of course, it is also one of the most expensive.  I used extremely good (and expensive) fillet Mignons.

O.K. Lets get something straight here.  Unless you live near a deli good pate' in the US is rare.  The only thing I could find near me was a can of pork pate' made by Underwood.  Those wonderful people that brought us canned deviled ham. (UGH!)  Try typing in "Val's Hungarian Jewish Chopped Liver" for pate' and it will give you alot better results.  Also, tell your butcher, if you have one, what your doing, it doesn't have to be a tenderloin if there is a real butcher near you.  I got away with a very good cut of porterhouse with his tenderizer method.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit.  Omitted the Pate and used pesto recipe shown by MRSMAC8 on April 5, 2004.  It was wonderful.  I did cook the meet a little longer without the Puff Pastry and then a little longer when I added the puff pastry (use a meat thermometer).  One hint, don't cover it while warm the pastry will tend to get soggy.  Will make it for Christmas dinner this year too.

I am so pleased to find this recipe. I used to spend literally hours preparing this dish the "old-fashioned" way - squeezing the mushrooms through cheese cloth to remove juice, etc. I tried this quick recipe and my family loves it even more than before.

I followed the tip of putting the pastries on a rack so they didn't get greasy, but I found this to be very very bland.  Everyone commented that the meat had no flavor, even with the pate and mushrooms.  Sorry to say I won't try this one again.

I wanted to cook something for my roommates that would amaze them with my cooking finesse. I shared the ingredients, and everyone of them requested that I leave a different thing out, be it the pate, the onions, or simply the temperature of the meat. But I stubbornly kept my ground. They actually ordered a pizza in advance, just in case. Needless to say, this is so good, the pizza became breakfast in the morning. Awesome!

I had some trouble with this recipie.  The meat seemed flavorless, and was too rare for the cooking time.  I might try individual filets next time.

I wanted the "perfect" dinner party for my friends that were moving.  The reviews were
fantastic; it went nicely with garlic mashed potatoes and a nice winter salad of greens and mandrin oranges and fresh green beans almondine. I had wanted to make this for years and found your recipe easy to follow!

A very nice recipe.  Although it isn't a "quick meal", it is relatively easy to prepare.

I left out the pate and added extra onions and mushroom, along with alittle more wine to taste.

Terrific touch Marla!

My first attempt was just okay.  Some thoughts... Novices, know that beef tenderloin is expensive.  2.6 lbs at Sprouts, was $50 at  $19/lb.  Be prepared.   Also, allocate more time.

I merged this with other methods.  I didn't use the pate, I used English mustard on the beef.  I diced the mushrooms really fine and added green onions, a shallot and garlic to the mushrooms.  I also  I laid down prosciutto and put the mushrooms down on that.  But I didn't have enough prosciutto - mistake #1, have enough prosciutto to cover the beef.    I had all of this on cling wrap which I used to help me roll the beef... but I had standard size wrap and I should of had a longer one, so that was mistake #2.      Result left me with a soggy bottom that broke when I tried to move it.  Had I had more prosciutto that covered the mushrooms, I think I would have avoided this.

This was also my first time working with puff pastry and I need more practice.  My ends were thick and lumpy.  And after baking it one side had ripped open exposing the mushroom filling.  I'm not sure what I did wrong to cause this.  I need more practice.

My review is mostly an account of what I learned from my mistakes.  My presentation wasn't that good but the meat cooked well and was tasty.   I want to try this again, it was a nice cooking adventure.

Great recipe! I read MANY reviews and came up with these changes: onions, mushrooms, garlic, and parsley sauteed, drained and cooled; cut loin into fillets and seared in cast iron skillet for 3 mins all sides, cooled; brushed a mixture of dijon and spicy grain mustard all over fillets; egg washed inside of pastry (hoping it would hinder the sogginess), added mushroom mixture, and a few tbsps of shredded parmesan; egg washed the outside; placed sheet pan and rack in oven during preheat; baked at 425 for 15 mins then lowered temp to 350 for another 10 mins or so. Even after doing some of the "preventative" measures the puff pastry was still soggy on the bottom, but it didn't hinder taste at all. I'm glad I went with a quality cut of beef. It didn't need sauce/au jus at all! Served with potato stacks and asparagus.

Loved it.   If you haven't tried the pate don't knock it till you try it, its awesome.  the only thing I would do different than what the recipe calls for is add salt to the meat before cooking initially.  The au jus is phenomenal. This time we purchased the fillets that are already wrapped in bacon and it was the perfect accent for the dish.  We never made beef wellington before but it was so worth it.  Thank you for the recipe!

Followed the instructions but used individual boned venison loins, seared them off in a very hot fry pan. After chilling, wrapped and roasted to medium rare on using a meat thermometer. Perfect!

Wow! I made this as a special occasion dinner, and it came out fantastic! I took the advice of several other reviewers and used individual filet mignons. I also baked it on a wire rack to keep the bottom from getting soggy. It was rich and delicious, and not nearly as difficult as I thought it would be.

Husband's fav bday dinner.  He doesn't like mushrooms so the earthiness and richness of the pâté completely replaces and even adds a dimension and level to the palate of the dish. Looking forward to trying the individual filets other have suggested here. I like to pair it with a purée of mashed potatoes, roasted cauliflower and parsnips and a green veggie. Enjoy! Thanks for sharing!

Amazing recipe!!! I recomend it to anybody who wants a easy, fancy and delicate dinner. I didn't use all the puff pastry so I cut out some flowers and leafs to hide the lines. The picture I put on here is before baking (I forgot to take a picture after we ate it very quickly lol) but it turned out to be beutifully gold.

Tried this (with a bit of cheese sauce added), but just resulted in a big mess.  At least the meat could be retrieved afterwards and was edible.  How do you prevent the pastry just falling apart?  Is there some kind of 'adhesive' you can use?

OMG, yum!  I consider myself a decent cook, but have never made Wellington until last night for Valentines day.  This recipe is amazing and incredibly easy! (I officially don't get what all of the intimidation is about). It was juicy and absolutely bursting with flavor!  If you think this is bland, you must have left out some of the ingredients. 

I took the advice of others below and used two individual fillets (about 6-8 oz each).  I then followed the steps above (pate is a must), but before wrapping in the pastry, I wrapped in prosciutto. I also added pastry hearts on top of each wellington for a special (corny) touch. I cooked on a rack and placed a sheet of vegetables below to cook  at the same time (asparagus, red pepper, cubed red potato, and carrots).  Finally: YOU MUST USE A MEAT THERMOMETER! Check EACH fillet throughout cooking because they may need different timing depending on thickness and position in the oven (mine did).  Enjoy!!

A very nice recipe, as far as the beef is concerned I would really brown it in a skillet before placing in in the oven. 
I did omit the softened butter and used a softened herb liver sausage mixed with finely chopped shallots and crimini mushrooms.
I took this mixture and spread it thinly on the pastry and left a edge that I moistened with egg wash.
I put a very light coat of Dijon mustard on the cooled beef prior to wrapping.

Made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner followed exactly as written and it came out wonderful. Make sure your puff pastry isn't too thick where you pinch it together.

I just made this for Christmas Eve dinner and followed recipe exactly including timing and it turned out perfect. I agree that baking on a rack might be a good idea. Next I am going to try this using individual filets. It's really an easy great recipe.

I made this exactly as described (except I only had a 2 pound tenderloin) and the beef was RAW at the end of the cook time.  I couldn't bake it anymore because the puff pastry was already quite dark.  I had to take out the beef to heat in the microwave for a bit to make it more comfortable to eat.  The taste of the dish was fine, but the cooking time was not correct.  Also...it was a pain to cut and I have sharp knives.  I'm sure this was the grain of the meat, but it didn't look so nice for my guests while I was trying to cut through raw meat that wouldn't actually cut.

I found that the precooking of the tenderloin wasn't long enough, it was extremely rare and we had to put it back in the oven. Other than that it was easy to do and FANTASTIC when all was said and done, impressed the  out of my inlaws :)

this recipe was great - taste was incredible and it was actually rather simple. Any mistakes I made were truly self-inflicted. I pulled out the puff pastry to thaw MUCH sooner than I should have, so it was a little harder to work with that I had anticipated. Also, I used a rack as suggested, but the rack I used was slanted, not flat. Next time I will use the flat rack to make this easier to transfer to the serving plate. Again, all these issues were my own fault. I think next time I will use this recipe but make individual servings instead of the 'loaf'. Thanks for a great Valentine's Day dinner!

I made this for a special family Valentines dinner and was very disappointed. It looked very nice, but we did not like the taste of it. I did not care for the pastry on the outside either. Perhaps this just boils down to personal tastes and not a bad recipe since everyone else has rated this high. Sorry!:-(

I was rather surprised to see someone left out the liver pate then said it didn’t matter!
I beg to differ on this one.   To me and my guests, it made the dish.  Can’t imagine it without it.  I did make the pate myself.
Great recipe, will be my standard for Wellington.
Thanks

This was wonderful! I made this for my in-laws who are VERY picky eaters and they loved it! I skipped the pate out of fear that they wouldn't eat it, but later found out that they don't like mushrooms. What do you know, they loved it so much that they didn't even realize! Thanks so much for such a great dinner party recipe.

My boyfriend and his father loved this --except i chose to leave out the liver pate. Also, I think that next time I make this I will only cover the top of the meat with the pastry, it ended up being a little too gooey underneath from the juices. Overall, awesome--make sure to choose an excellent cut of filet.

I made this dish for my boyfriend's birthday (his favorite) and couldn't have been happier.  Very delicious and I don't like liver! It was so good, he ate the leftovers for 2 days straight and wasn't sick of it.  Tastes great with rosemary potatoes and a cherry tomatoe/green olive salad. Oh...and don't forget the tiramisu for dessert.

Marla - I tried your recipe for Christmas Dinner - My first attempt at Beef Wellington!  My brother-in-law is from England and he raved!  He said he felt like he was back home, only better cooking!  Thanks for a relatively simple, yet elegant, recipe!  I'm forwarding it to my Dad!

Oh Marla - yum! I made this tonight for Christmas dinner and what a hit! It was actually very easy to prepare, and less time consuming than a turkey for example. The wine/au jus was delicious as well. I did leave out the pate per everyone's request and used blackberry merlot in place of red wine - very good! I would defintely make this again - although not often due to the high calories and fat!! But well worth it for a special dinner. Thanks!

I made this for a random friends dinner! IT was fabulous, however I could not find liver pate so I just used prosciutto and it was salty enough to season the meat. I had never even tasted this recipe Beef Wellington so it was nice to receive so many compliments.

Thanks to this classic recipe, I made beef Wellington for the very first time and my In laws seriously believe I’m a gourmet chef. They said it is absolutely the best thing they ever had.

Excellent recipe and will absolutely  make  this again. My 20-something son and I made this Christmas Day. We made individual fillets and really the only change we made was that we chopped the mushrooms rather than slicing them. Made it a bit more manageable when eating it. I would encourage readers to not be intimidated by the pate as it adds a richness to the recipe. This was my first time making Beef Wellington and I now have my recipe for life!

I followed the directions and it was perfect.  The whole family loved it.  I did as someone recommended and placed it on a rack... note:  do NOT use a roasting rack because the dough fell through and thinned out the top.  Next time I am using a  rack with smaller slots.

OH-MY-GOSH this was good! Made 4 individuals and substituted the "Pesto Sauce" rub for the pate (the "most helpful" reviewer gives recipe). I served it with Chef John's Fondant Potatoes (recipe on site) and a salad.  Expensive, but worth EVERY penny!!

Excellent. I used two big prime fillets and followed the recipe except for the cooking techniques. I followed other reviewers who seared the beef first for about 1 1/2 minutes per side and then cooked on an over rack at 400 for 25 minutes. Unfortunately, that resulted in over-cooking. I was hoping for medium rare, but got medium +.  Served with au gratin potatoes, garlic green beans, and of course a great Cab.

Made this for our Christmas dinner and it was truly awesome! This was my first time making this and the only advice I would give is to make sure on the first go in the oven, be sure to get to 125 internal temp to be sure it isn’t too rare when finished off with the crust. Delicious!!

I made this for the first time today, and it was delicious. I would reccomend browning the meat a little longer, probably 15-20 minutes versus 10. Mine came out extremely rare, but since it was just family we stuck the sliced meat in the broiler for a few minutes. I used pillsbury pizza dough for my cover. Was very delicious.

Yum. I followed the cooking directions exactly and got medium beef, though this was likely to because I had smaller fillets rather than one big one. If I managed to get my hands on the right size fillet I think this would have been great. I do like the idea of adding whole mustard to the beef before the mushroom mix - this would add a lovely flavour to the finished dish. Will play with this one and likely make again. Not bad for my first attempt at a Wellington.

Great recipe.  It is so incredibly quick and easy and yet you end up with a dish that is special enough for any holiday. I definitely recommend it. 

I had sous vide cooked some petite fillets ( they look like tenderloins but cost about half as much) the night before and needed something to do with two remaining fillets so they wouldn't become one of those leftovers that stayed in the fridge until thrown out. This recipe was perfect. 

I was able to skip the searing step since the fillets were already cooked to perfection (rare-medium rare) the night before. The only other substitution I made was that I used chopped liver (from my local bagel store) instead of pate' . 

My family loved it and we practically fought over each bit of the leftovers the next day.

Recipie needs more seasoning. It calls for no salt or pepper except for pate. It had no pronounced  taste. The kids loved it. Meat cooked well and looked gorgeous. If we made again would def season our own way.

I would consider cooking it a bit longer than the times indicated. I made twice and it was quite rare in the center. It’s a great recipe and pretty easy to make. .

I've made this twice and it is spectacular!  In both instances, I purchased 2 filet mignon roasts, both about 1.5 lbs and I roast them simultaneously.  I've followed the cook times exactly and miraculously, the beef is perfect.

Agree with KIM20 the Cooking time is incorrect.  Had 2 1/4 pound tenderloin that also came out bloody red.  Could it be my oven's temp -- doubtful.  Other than a BIG misjudgment on cooking time, overall a good recipe.  The pate provides a nice strong flavor for a delicate meat.  Next time, meat thermometer which was my mistake.

Grilled filet first for flavor instead of baking. Added garlic to onions and mushrooms and mixed fra gras with truffles with it to make my spread.  Very tasty. I am a private chef. My customer cleaned his plate.

This is an excellent recipe!!!  The pate' took it to another level.  I highly suggest you place it on a rack when cooking as the juices will make the bottom soggy.  The only thing I did differently, I chopped the mushrooms in a blender to make them like crumbs.  Also, I didn't cook the whole tenderloin, I cooked individual filets.

This recipe was amazing.  I haven't tried to cook a Beef Wellington before, so was a little nervous, but it came out great and the family raved about it.  I did modify a bit.  I thought it might be too rich with the Pate, so I whisked some melted butter with dijon mustard and used that instead.  I also used 2 tbsp. chopped scallions from a jar and sauteed with about 1 lbs of chopped white button mushrooms.  I layered prosciutto on plastic wrap, set the roast on top, covered with the dijon mixture and then the mushroom duxelles and wrapped the roast with the prosciutto.  This helped to keep it all together before wrapping in the phyllo dough.  Cooking also took about 10 mins longer than recommended time, but it came out super delicious.

I made this for a New Years Day get together with my girlfriends family . I followed the recipe with only one difference and that was using store bought prepared chopped chicken liver ( with eggs and chopped onions) instead of the butter/pate mixture and OMG !!!! How delicious!!! I did have a problem with the bottom of the pastry shell sticking to the rack but the flavor was absolutely delicious!

Outstanding.  Like other reviewers, i made individual filets rather than a whole beef tenderloin.  First i sauteed the mushrooms and onion in some butter then sherry until absorbed, removed from pan, added a bit more butter, and then seared the filets (seasoned with S&P) about 2-3 minutes on each side.  Rather than pate, I used prosciutto based on some online replacement recommendations.  Prosciutto on the bottom of the pastry, then the seared steak, then the mushroom/onion mixture on top.  i chose 425 the whole time, cooked about 1/2 an hour and covered with foil for about 20 minutes.  It was a PERFECT medium.  Oh definitely use a rack so that the pastry doesn't get soggy on the bottom, my toaster oven rack fit nicely into the 9x13 dish i used.  thanks for a fabulous recipe with rave reviews!

Yum!  Don't like pate so just made a pate out of sauteed mushrooms and onions and red wine and cream.  Use a meat thermometer.

Um, this was sooooo good! I used a filet mignon for Christmas dinner. I made it the day ahead... good thing because I was super sick Christmas day. My son baked it in the oven for me and it was perfect. Very easy to make and so delicious. I can't wait to make it again!

My boyfriend requested this as a treat, and I can see why! This was my first time buying beef tenderloin- hold onto your socks! This was an excellent meal and a for sure indulgence. 

Made the recipe as suggested, but could not find liver pate for the life of me so saw another reviewer recommend pesto and tried that. Also added parsley and parmesan cheese. 

Served with risotto, excellent! Reduction is good for veggies, potatoes etc.

This is a great recipe to follow. Like others I opted out the liver pate and added a layer of pesto. I also used individual cuts of meat, but kept the cooking time the same. The result was medium rare steak. To prevent less juices from soaking the puff pastry, I seared the meat in a frying pan with high heat and let it sit for 15 min. Then used the juices with mushrooms and onions and added a few spices. By far the greatest meal I've made.

Literally just the beef and the pastry--pour some beef broth over it.  Very tasty.

I did not use the pate per my husband's request. Although it takes some time to make this meal it is quickly becoming a favorite. I use individual tenderloins for a single serve portion.

I remember the first time I made this. You know in cartoons when someone is extremely satisfied with something, and the angelic music would play in the background? That's what happened the first time I tried the recipe.

I made this for a special Christmas Eve dinner and it was very impressive especially considering how simple the recipe is. I took MRSMAC8's suggestion of subbing the paté with pesto because I thought the paté would be too rich and it turned out wonderfully! The flavors really worked well with the meat and the mushrooms. I followed the cooking time exactly to the recipe and the meat was cooked perfectly. As all of the other reviewers note, the star of this recipe is the meat itself so it's important to use a very high quality piece of meat.

have made this a few times for my parents and family on "special" occasions ranging from holidays to "Hey kid, you wanna live here, rent free? Then make dinner once and a while!!" 

...Gotta say this recipe is good enough to let me keep living at home rent free for at least a little while longer :D

I made this today using two venison tenderloins. I was worried at first how the pâté would taste with it but wow, it was so delicious. It presented so well and both Wellingtons were out of this world tasty. The reduced sauce paired so well with it too. Can't wait to make this again for a special occasion.

A perfect recipe to make for a romantic dinner. This recipe does take some time, but in the end results in a very rich dish. My boyfriend is not a big fan of pate, but this turned him on to it. Serve it alongside some cauliflower puree or for a lighter option (since this dish is so rich) a side salad.

Made his for my hubbys bday dinner and it turned out great after a few changes. I used filets and seared them in a pan with 1tbsp butter and 1tbsp olive oil to start, then let them cool and cooked the onions and mushrooms in the same pan and reserved them. I didn't use live pate and instead coated the filets with spicy mustard before topping them with the mushroom and onion mix and rolling them up. I used the same pan filets, onions and mushrooms cooked in to make the red wine sauce. Wellingtons came out perfectly pink and delish!

Prepared this for my husbands 49th Birthday dinner. Needed a little more cooking time due to the fact that the cut of meat was so thick but WOW!  Rave reviews by all of our guests, even young children.  I will definitely be adding this one to my recipes often used.

I cooked this last night, and yes, it was tasty, but I don't know if it was worth all the hassle of preparation. I think I will try it one more time and decide then.
