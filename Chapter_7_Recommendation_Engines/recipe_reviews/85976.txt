I was in the process of moving and didn't have much left in food, but i did have some chicken and Blue Cheese dressing, so i did an ingredient search and this recipe came up. (I also had to find an alfrado recipe-- Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce w/ cream cheese, et al.) The recipe was so good! I halfed it, and doubled the chicken. I wanted to eat the whole thing to my self. But left some for my husband, and lunch the next day. It reheated just fine! I would recommend a good alfredo sauce hand made, not out of a jar.

The bleu cheese dressing and tomatoes combined to make the alfredo sauce extra rich, a little too rich for me. I didn't have any chicken pieces, so I used frozen meatballs. The meatballs went great with the cheese and helped distill some of the bitterness of the bleu cheese. If I make alfredo again, will probably leave out the bleu cheese.

very good. i also used crumbles instead of dressing. the only reason i gave it a 4 was because it doesn't reheat well. so maybe next time i will sprinkle the alfrado with the bleu cheese.

I didn't like this. Not only was this very rich, it was also very expensive per portion. The high calorie count wasn't justifiable given the small amount of real food in the dish - most of the calories are from the sauces.

We used chunky bleu cheese dressing in this and I put a few more tomatoes in than it calls for (I like them) and some garlic it was really really good.. my fiance and I love rich foods and this was not only easy to make but reheated well (I thought).  The only complaint I have is that it made WAY too much.  We ended up throwing away some of the leftovers just because we had eaten it 3 times already.  Next time I'll half the recipe. Won't make it often (too fattening) but will make the rotation again sometime :)

YUM!  I actually changed a couple things because of what I had on-hand.  I used tomato sauce instead of alfredo sauce.  I also used bleu cheese crumbles instead of dressing.  It was fabulous!  Great flavor.  I'd definitely make it again.

I really like this recipe EXCEPT, I used blue cheese crumbles, added sauted red onion and bacon crumbles.  I also used grape tomatoes. I also made extra pasta about another half box.

Yummy!!  This made a great combination!!! My husband and I loved it!!  At first I gave it four stars but after eating it agian I decided that it was five stars and my husband would give it more if he could.  The flavors were great togther.  I thought that the blue cheese was to strong a just the sauce but when you ate it with noodles and chicken it was just right.  We will make this agian.

Did a semi-vegetarian take on this recipe (scaled for two); Substituted a 10 oz. can of Companion brand braised gluten (seitan tidbits-available from Asian markets) for the chicken, which sauteed a little while in the pan, after the tomato simmered with some garlic and yellow onion in EVOO, and I put 1/3 cup of real blue cheese crumbles in with the alfredo sauce. I sprinkled the final dish with some black pepper from a mill. It lay on a bed of multi-shaped Wacky-Mac tri-colore pasta I had. I enjoyed it on a winter's night.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it had an off taste to me. I liked the convenience of the recipe and I had some jarred alfredo sauce that needed used up. I was out of tomatoes but that was the only thing I left out, I only cut back on the amount of ingredients.

This sauce is just FAR too rich. Also, I cut almost all the ingredients in half, and have more than I know what to do with. The addition of red onions and bacon helped, but I think the blue cheese dressing AND Alfredo is just over the top. (I love me my butter and cream, so that is saying a lot)  Both my husband and I felt pretty crummy after eating this. I will not be making it again.

This was very rich.  I didn't use bleu cheese dressing, but substituted blue cheese crumbles, which probably mellowed it out some from the "creamy" standpoint and stepped up the sharpness of the bleu cheese.  We enjoyed it but it is so rich that it will not make the "regular" weekly rotation.

The bleu cheese gives this alfredo sauce an unusual and delicious twist!  I didn't have steak seasoning so I used a combination of seasoning salt and garlic herb seasoning.  Wonderful!  Will make again and again!

I made this again, this time using Montreal steak seasoning.  EXCELLENT!

Used leftover chicken for this recipe. And instead of bottled bleu cheese dressing, merely topped the pasta and chicken with crumbled bleu. My husband loved the flavors.

I was disapointed that this recipe didn't turn out the way I imagined it would.  Perhaps I used the wrong brands of alfredo and bleu cheese.  However, I don't think a different brand would change my opinion too much.  Like others have said, too rich.  Also, the recipe calls for to much pasta and not enough chicken.
