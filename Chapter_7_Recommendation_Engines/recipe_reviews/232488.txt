I did not see the cook notes that a variety of berries could be used so I stuck with what the recipe indicated which was raspberries. I'm giving it four stars because I do not believe the cornstarch was necessary. Prior to adding in the cornstarch, water, vanilla extract, and lemon juice the raspberries had already reduced which thickened it enough. I chose to follow the recipe, and I added in the cornstarch mixture. I immediately regretted doing so because it thickened it so much I could no longer pour the compote on top of my waffles.

I used blackberries and raspberries.  I had a little more than 6 cups of berries so had to adjust sugar but used 2 tbl of cornstarch. The consistency turned out perfect!!!

Excellent!  I used 4 cups of blackberries and blueberries that I had on hand and followed the rest of the instructions as written.  The vanilla extract and lemon juice are wonderful flavor additions and give it more depth than other fruit compotes I have had.  I served the compote cold over angel food cake and received lots of positive comments.  I would like to also try this compote warm over pancakes.  Yum!

I used fresh strawberries from the garden and took out the sugar. Added just a little more cornstarch and a little less lemon juice. Perfect! The vanilla is a great idea! It was a hit with the family. No leftovers.... :)

I LOVE this dish! It is so good on waffles or pancakes. I also put it on grits. SO GOOD! Although, I didn't use cornstarch and it turned out great.
