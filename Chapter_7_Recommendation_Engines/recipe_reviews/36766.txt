I cheated on this recipe to save time.  I browned the meat and onion and then added a package of taco seasoning mix and a little tomato sauce.  Mixed the beans in with the mix.  I then rolled as directed and baked.  I usually fry mine and they were much less greasy this way.  I topped with cheese, salsa, lettuce and sour cream.  I will continue to bake my chimichangas rather than frying from now on.  They were great and a lot less messy.

*****!! Very much enjoyed this recipe. I took the advise of other reviews and changed it up a bit. Here are my suggestions. Do add 7oz of green diced canned chiles. Reduce corn to 3/4 cup. I preferred to not have this recipe taste like a burrito, so I did not add any taco seasoning like some reviewers did. Instead of the taco sauce as the recipe calls for, I preferred to only add 1/2 cup of Enchalada sauce for better flavor and to steer clear of the burrito recipe. Between the green chile's and the enchalada sauce that will make the meat mixture moist enough 
without over doing it. I also preferred the flavor of "Blackbean" refried beans instead of the regular. Also I fried the chimi on each side and served it with some of the enchalada sauce on it topped with cheese, tomato, lettuce, sourcream etc. This recipe is fantastic my family really enjoyed this. 
I consider myself to be an excellent cook, and I was not disappointed at all, and I will include this recipe as one of the best I have. Try it today, you will not be disappointed!

I love this recipe. I have tried it several different ways - with shredded chicken, shredded beef, ground beef, and all bean. They all turned out wonderful. I make them to the point where I roll the tortilla and then I freeze the Chimichangas in individual packets. When I want to use them I take out as many as I need, microwave them until they are warm and defrosted and then spray them with Pam and bake them. I serve them on shredded iceburg lettuce with sour cream and salsa on the side.

I followed some reviewers suggestions and used a packet of taco seasoning since I was short on time. Also added 1 can of diced green chilis in place of the bell pepper, and mixed the refried beans right in with the meat. Very easy and it tasted fantastic. I still had some meat and bean mixture left so I refrigerated it and later made appetizer chimis using soft taco size tortillas for wrapping. It just takes maybe 1T. of meat mixture to make one. They're adorable! I froze them and will use them later this month for a small party we're having.
Thanks Nicole for a great recipe!!!

HELPFUL TIPS:  I only made this b/c I had some ground beef to use but I'm glad I did.  I was worried they wouldn't have that nice crispy fried taste to them if baked but as long as you bake until they have a nice lightly hard touch (I had to bake them 10 min longer to achieve this ...just touch tortillas until desired doneness) they were fabulous!  Definitely take the advice of cutting the corn to 3/4C and save the rest for a side dish the next night.  I also added a can of green chile to the mix or can be used to substitute the green peppers and onions.  Also great idea to only make what you need and save the rest of only the meat mixture and freeze.  They thawed out and worked wonderfully the second time around, and saved me the trouble of having to make dinner!  I DO add at least half a package of taco seasoning, and never have taco sauce, so use enchilada.  I also agree you just need 1/2C of sauce to make these work w/o being soggy!   For a SUPER quick side dish with minimal ingredients, try the "Best Spanish Rice" from this site.  So easy and so good.  ...and if you have chicken to get rid of, the "Chicken Chimichangas" is equally fabulous. ;)

I buttered both sides of the rolled chimichangas and turned them halfway through baking so both sides would yet golden.  Very good, next time I will cut the recipe in half.  The recipe made 7 very big chimichangas.  My husband and I were only able to eat 1 each.

Made only 4 Chimichangas, and froze the remaining meat mixture for future use.  Looked and tasted GREAT, brushed olive oil over tortillas before rolling them, came out nicely browned and crispy.
Added this one to my all time fav's!!!

This is really a very good recipe. It is easy to make and well liked. It was just my husband and I, so I froze what I didn't use for another time. It was nice to just thaw it, wrap and bake. I made it a second time for guests at a casual get together, they were gone before I ever got one. It's also very easy to adjust if you are missing something or just want more spice. In other words, I think this is a great all around recipe. Thank you, I'll be keeping this one.

These were great.  I made my own ground beef filling(a piccadillo type).  I loved the idea of oven baked chimi's.  Haven't had a chimi in years cuz I'm aways trying to cut fat grams. Excellent compromise.  Topped with lower fat sour cream, red onions,and my homemade salsa.  Also excellent using the "Charley's slow cooker Mexican style meat" found on this site.  Great to freeze (assemble and freeze individually b4 brushing on butter) to have on hand for busy days.

I didn't follow this recipe to the letter, I almost never do.  A five star recipe to me is one that either teaches me something new or makes me say "why didn't I think of that!".  And this recipe had me with the latter.  I can't believe I never thought of brushing butter or oil onto tortillas before baking them.  I love chimichangas, but would never do the deep frying thing at home.  I've seen Chimi's done a million ways in restaurants.  So, I don't understand the criticism for the fillings.  When I made them they came out really crispy and seemed like they were well fried.  They weren't greasy or soggy like they would have been if I had deep fried them.  They were perfect.  I did go a little heavy on the butter, making sure they were well coated.  Maybe that makes a difference.  I won't go into how I seasoned my meat, because every likes a different level of spice and different vegetables.  The method here is really sound and I learned a technique that I will be using forever.  I do recommend keeping the beans and meat seperate and constructing as described too.

This is definitely a "favorite".  I make it for several parties and everyone raves about it.  I save a step and mix the beans in with the burger mixture and just spoon on the tortilla.  This is a great recipe to freeze.

These are quite good!  I really wasn't sure about adding 2 C. of taco sauce, I used 1 + 1/2 C. and it was plenty moist and flavorful, also I used home-made refried beans instead of canned--followed the recipe exactly otherwise and I will make these again!

This recipe was excellent.  I did not use the corn, but everything else was exactly the same.  I served it with diced tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, black olives and diced onions.  EXCELLENT!! My husband wouldn't stop sighing in delight and my brother came over and said he didn't think he would be able to eat a whole one and by the time he was done he was practically licking his plate.  I loved the fact these were baked and not fried.  My husband says he wants these at least once a week!

I had to sub around & use ingredients that I had on hand, but I loved this idea of baking them. I only had corn tortillas so I warmed them a bit in the microwave. I also didn't have any corn or taco sauce. I did make a homemade salsa verde in place of the taco sauce and it was delish! Topped it with the salsa verde & Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce and we had a very yummy meal. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and versatile. I cooked the ground beef with a package of taco seasoning, then mixed in a can of refried beans to save me time in filling the tortilla shells. I did not have corn on hand, but this recipe could work with any combination of fillings! It browned nicely at the reccomended temp and time. Will make again!

I have always loved to cook but have really gained an interest since finding this site. These Chimichangas were amazing! I followed the directions to a tee although I used less corn like many suggested here. These were restuarant style and then some. I did butter them heavily before baking them and even once before they were done. One suggestion though, eat them as soon as they come out from the oven. I tried reheating them for my roomy a few hours after she got home and they were not nearly as good. Will make these again and again and....thanks for the great recipe!

We really liked these.  They are so easy to make, and they're tasty and filling.  I used super lean ground beef and Trader Joe's whole wheat tortillas.  I also used pepper jack cheese.  The leftovers are great warmed up the next day in the oven, wrapped in foil.

I am sure this is great the way it is written, but I tweaked it to what others suggested. I did not use corn(kids wouldn't like it) added the refried beans to the meat mixture, used taco seasoning mix and 1 cup of taco sauce. I did not use butter but sprayed pam in pan and on top of shells, sprinkled cheese on top. Baked for about 15 min @400 served with/lettuce, sour cream ,salsa and guc with a side a spanish rice... everyone loved it~Thanks for the recipe sooo good.

These are terriffic!!! My family loves them. And request it often. I make as directed except I omit the corn.  I don't understand those that rate this one star and admit to having not tried it.  I don't care what you are GOING to do, I only care about what people have to say about the recipe after they have tried it!

These are great! They're just like a fried chimi but made in the oven. I use 2 lbs ground beef, leave out the corn, and mix the refried beans into the meat mixture (much easier that way). Garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I brush them with 2 tablespoons of melted butter, they crisp better when I use more than 1 Tbsp. HINT: I have found that 30 minutes is not long enough to get these crispy. I bake mine about 45 minutes OR until they are brown and the shells are firm to the touch.

This recipes was EXCELLENT!! I made it as listed, and the taste and texture were spot on. Serve with some Spanish rice & you've got yourself a meal!  This is a great make-ahead meal too - make the filling, and keep it on hand in the fridge or freezer. When you're ready to make, slap down a few tortillas, open can of beans, fill em up and bake!! DELICIOUS!

Easty to make and tasty, everyone in the family liked them but way too much cheese, easily could cut by half. Probably even a quarter.

My family loved these! I used onion powder instead of the fresh onion because I didn't have one, but it was still great! They turned out just like the fried chimichangas. Will use this recipe again. Thanks!

OMG, This recipe is so good!!!  Not to mention easy to make!  I followed the recipe, and served with sour cream, yummy.  Using the taco sauce instead of taco seasoning gives it a great flavor.  This is one of my new favorites!  A+++++

this recipe was very good, but was not very good as leftovers, so only make what you know you will eat freshly made.  will make again.

Excellent!!!! Highly recommend! No need to ever fry-- there were so savory and tasty straight from the oven! The crunchier the tortilla, the better the taste! Definitely let them cook at least 35 minutes to get the hard tortilla. No need to put any topping on-- these were easy to pick up with our hands and eat like a sandwich. Everyone loved them, from our baby all the way up to the adults. Here are the changes I did:  I used packaged burrito seasoning and mixed the refried beans with the meat. I used shredded colby cheese (a must) and added  a can of green chiles and corn, along with the onion and a red bell pepper... that way the kids eat their veggies and don't even know it. :)

The hardest part of this recipe was overfilling the tortillas and making a mess wrapping them. Good thing I used non-stick foil in a baking pan to bake them since some of the chimichangas leaked. This recipe is easy and tasty though! I'll definitely make again!

This is a great recipe but it would be better with less taco sauce, maybe only 1 cup. I will probably make this again.

This was simple, yet delicious.  Everyone kept murmuring as they were eating it how much they enjoyed it.  I did omit the corn and green bell pepper, using ingredients I had on hand.  This will be a staple in our future menus for sure!

These turned out well, and were great the next day for lunch. They were a little bland, which isn't something that I usually mind.. add a little more pizzaz and these will be awesome!

These came better than I expected! I followed the recipe except I didn't have any taco sauce to I just used taco seasoning with water. They were not crisping as fast as I wanted them too so I put them under the broiler for a few minutes and that did the trick!. My 3 girls all loved them too, definitely a keeper. I can't wait to try them with different filling. Thanks for the recipe.

What a great way to enjoy chimichangas w/out having to deep fat fry them!  Thanks for this recipe!  I didn't have bell pepper (so I omitted), used about 8oz of La Victoria Mild Taco Sauce (the rest we used at the table).  Looking at the recipe I forgot to add cumin (oops) and we used cheddar which I had on hand.  It was truly yummy!  I double the meat mixture so we can reinvent it on nachos, tacos or quesadillas...I could go and on :).  I will leave in the oven a bit longer next time...I really liked it lightly browned!!  :)

This was a great recipe!  Even my picky husband loved it and went back for seconds.  I don't understand why a lot of reviewers are omitting the corn...we loved it!  It was a stretch to say it makes 8 though...we stretched the beans a long way to make 6 or 7.  Next time I'll just buy more beans!

This was great. Easy to make. Just like what I'd expect from my favorite Mexican restaurant. I added jalapenos, but that's the only change I made.

I thought these were pretty good and would give this a 4, and my husband loved it and said he would love to have it again!

I used salsa because I didn't have taco sauce, and probably only used half of what was called for. We also had the lettuce and tomato but totally forgot to get it out when the chimis were finished cooking!!

The filling was great, but I wouldn't recommend baking them. Just buy nice soft tortillas and fill them and eat them fresh! I also used green taco sauce (made with tamatillos) and some green chilies. Very good.

I didn't have any taco sauce...  So I substututed with taco seasoning and add only chili powder since I thought the seasoning mix already have other spices the recipe calls for...  It still tasted pretty good but I'll make it with taco sauce for the next time to compare the taste diference.

I loved the method of crisping the chimichangas in the oven. I liked the flavor of the beef and the cheese is soooo melty from being heated for so long.  My only dislike was the beef and bean combination, but thats a personal preferance.  I recomend this to all to try!!!

Wow!  Made these almost exactly as written (made a few minor changes to accomodate dairy allergies), and they were awesome!  First meal in awhile where hubby wanted seconds.  Will definitely add these to our recipe rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Great baked chimichangas!  These were very tasty!  I made my own Taco Sauce, which I highly recommend doing, in order to cut down on all the sodium from store-bought.  It gives the filling such a good flavor.  I used 1 cup each of onion, green bell pepper, corn, and Taco Sauce.  Everything else stayed the same.  The mixture was perfect for us.  I baked 4 for dinner and wrapped the other 4 to freeze for future use.  Perfect!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Really good... make sure to get butter on the whole top so it won't get burnt.  Tastes better with sour cream or guac on top.  Otherwise, it's a but dry.

I wanted to give these 4*, Hubby said 4 1/2*. Very tasty meat. A bit messy but very tasty. Definitey above average. Hubby took left over meat to work and put it through his salad with lots of grated cheese. I bought an enchilada kit and just used the tortillas and enchilada sauce that came with it. It was cheaper that way. I also didn't have any corn, but used celery instead and more bell pepper. UPDATE: I have mastered this because I wanted to try it again because of the recipe's ease and I have to say that it is 5* worthy now and have changed my rating. The enchilada sauce in the meat makes it so good, then using a baking tray that isn't lined, and spraying the chimis with a light coating of oil before putting in the oven works wonders. I also use a store bought salsa which makes them soooooo goooood.

This was great.  The only thing I did differently was use Joe T. Garcia's medium salsa instead of taco sauce.  I had guests from San Antonio, Texas tell me it was truely authentic with a kick!  Will make again.

Pretty good.  I went ahead and fried these instead of baking them.  Top with a generous amount of heated Salsa con Queso and tomatoes and they are even better.

I loved this recipe, and so did all my dinner guests! (aka guinea pigs!) A friend's mother used to make amazing chimichangas but I could never get the recipe; these were even better, so I'm thrilled. My boyfriend is not a cheese lover so I left cheese out of half of them, and added olives. He LOVED them!! Definitely will become a staple meal in my house. Served them with spanish rice, salsa and salad. Next time I will brush with a little more butter as I don't think I used quite enough this time. I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I have gotten many wonderful recipes from this website and I use it frequently but I will admit that this has to be the very worst! It was absolutely tastless. I followed the recipe to the tee and even added some extra salsa, sour cream and shredded cheese at the end and it was still horrible. This one will definitely NOT be a keeper at my house.

I really iked these, but will play with the recipe a bit as I just felt there was something missing.  As another reviewer suggested, I mixed the refried beans in to save a step.  I thought the corn, onions, and green pepper were all great in this.  Like another reviewer, I sprayed with cooking spray instead of brushing with butter.  They turned out fine.  I'm not sure what it was, but there was just some flavor I was expecting that wasn't there.  Still, it was pretty good.  We got 7 large chimichangas out of this and froze 5 of them for lunches.

I cheated and used the old el Paso soft taco kit along with the corn, onion and pepper.  Just mixed the seasoning, taco sauce, and tomato sauce into my beef and vegetables.   My kids do not like spice and they loved it.  When they came out of the oven I added salsa to mine only, and topped theirs with sour cream and extra cheese.  Thank you for the easy and quick recipe.

I really loved smothering the things with cheese to the point where you can barely roll them and then I used some of the leftover re-fried beans to stick the tortilla together. Lastly I liberally sprinkled cheese over the top and the best part was, when they were done, none of it fell apart because it was all glues together because of the cheese!

This was a keeper for us. We're trying to eat more beans and this is a very tasty way to do it.  After baking I let them cool and put them in a closed container for lunches during the week.   The only change I made - only used half of the spices and only half of the taco sauce because I wanted to be able to handle these easily once cooled.  Also I used beef cubes instead of ground beef.  Yum!

A good way to use up some ground beef. My only problem with it was that it was a little salty. I think next time I will do garlic powder instead of the salt. Topped with a little sour cream and black olives.

these were very good, needs more spice for 5 stars.
i used homemade refried beans instead of canned and a red pepper instead of green. i'll add a little more spice to the meat next time. i added chedder and monterey jack cheese to the top in the last 10 minutues.

These were allright. To be fair, I made several changes - and I wish I hadn't. I appreciate reading all of the helpful reviews on here and agree that they are what makes Allrecipes unique. Having said this, I think there's a LOT to be said for trying a recipe as it's SUPPOSED to be. After having made significant changes, this is what I suggest: a) it doesn't matter if you sub a sm. can of diced chilies for green bell pepper - do whatever you prefer, b) I halved the corn, but am wondering if I could have added more, c) I only added 1/2 c. of taco sauce to my beef mixture, but could barely taste it (I'm thinking 2 c. worth would be a smidgin too much, but 1/2 c. just wasn't enough...) d) if adding, use the ENTIRE pkg. of taco seasoning (why waste half of it???) and e) DO NOT add your beans to your beef mixture! My biggest gripe is two-fold. Not only were these bland, they were also VERY beany (and I mean SUPER beany!!!). I think a good schmear of beans on each tortilla would have been spot on  - you can always serve leftovers on the side. Now on to the kudos. :) I was afraid my chimis wouldn't crisp up in the oven but they did. My hubs even commented how impressed he was with the outcome. If you follow Nicole's directions, your chimis will be nice and crunchy. The key is to brush lightly with butter (too much butter will make them soggy) and bake in the upper half of your oven. Served with herbed corn (Edna Hoffman), this was a decent meal. Thanks for sharing, Nicole! :-)

Make these!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I also built the chimis with spanish rice inside.  We made some chicken and some beef. Both fantastic!  If you don't have butter on hand, spray canola cooking spray on top to make the tortillas crisp.  Also, garnish with avocados because WHY wouldn't you!!??  =)  Adios!

I really enjoyed these. I didn't have enough taco sauce, so I threw in a can of tomato sauce and extra seasonings to make up for flavor. The bf really enjoyed it, so I guess this is a keeper. Thanks, Nicole!

I read some of the reviews before trying and took some of the suggestions. I used ground sirloin. I also used enchilda sauce instead of taco sauce. I used black beans and went ahead and mixed them with meat. I also added cheese on top after almost completely baking so that it melted. I also used the Best Spanish Rice recipe from this site. I loved this recipe can't wait to cook it for my hubby.

Loved these!  not only are they delicous but they are so easy to make.  don't omit brushing melted butter on top just before baking.  This is what gives these the same crispy exterior without deep frying.

Edit: my tastes have changed.  I made this again 5 years later and i'd give it 1 star now

Great idea putting on the butter & baking instead of frying. These were really yummy! You can put just about anything inside - good way to clean out the fridge.

My husband is very picky about his Mexican food. Since his mother is from Mexico, he always tells me "this isn't how my Mama would make it". When I served him these, he finished his plate and brought the left-overs to work the next day! Thanks for sharing. I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe.

Yum!  I will make again and again for those chimi cravings I get.  I am also going to look for a queso that I can serve on top like my favorite restuarant does.

Tasted good but giving 3 stars because it tasted more like a burrito than a chimichanga. I would have preferred a more restaurant style filling which I kind of expected by reading the name of the recipe, Loved the idea of baking instead of frying and may look for a different filling and use this cooking method.

Since none of my veggies were chopped, cheese not grated, etc...this took a bit longer than 45 min. to prepare.  I think if I were to make it again, I would reduce the taco sauce significantly.  It seemed to overpower the other flavors in the dish.  Very filling and makes alot..  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I did not have any corn, but it still turned out fantastic! I had 8 inch tortillas and it made quite a few!  I froze them in groups of two after we ate til our hearts content and I froze 8 chimichangas!   I cannot wait to eat them later!

I thought this was good, but was expecting more. There was nothing to dislike, but wasn't the best Mexican i have ever made. They did not crisp as I would have liked them to. Maybe next time I will do as other reviewers and "fry" it on both sides first? Also, next time I would add maybe some pork green chili, or enchilada sauce at the very end of the cooking time.

AWESOME!!  I don't fix Mexican recipes much because they just don't taste as good as our fine restaurant here in Red Oak.   But this was an exception.  After reading the reviews, I didn't use quite as much taco sauce and I also tried McCormick's great guacamole (in pkg) and just added avocados and put on the top after baking along with lettuce, tomato, etc  It was better than guacamole in the jar. The only ingredient I added was black olives.  I'm going to see if Nicole has other Mexican recipes on this site!!  Also, I really dislike refried beans so I made my husbands with them and believe it or not I used garbanzo beans in mine and they tasted great!

Everyone loved it!!!  The only thing I changed was that instead of green peppers, I used green chilies.  I also added black beans when adding the corn.  For me and wrapped mine in a whole wheat tortilla.  That was OK but when I tasted my husband's, it was much better on a flour tortilla.  But most things are :)  Will make again!!

Used fresh garlic instead of salt - this is SO superior and more nutritious, too. Reduced cheese significantly and used fat-free refried beans. I so appreciate the nutrition facts so that we can eat healthier.

A rare five stars for me and my family.  Left out the onion and pepper and next time will be leaving out the corn.  Used salsa instead of taco sauce but next time I will use taco sauce.  Used Mexican blend cheese instead of just Monterey Jack.  Very rare everyone LOVED it and with a few tweeks they'll all be even happier the next time I make it

I thought this was very good however I used the advice of many others and made modifications.  I did not use onion or green pepper, instead I added a 6oz. can of green chiles.  I did not add the taco sauce or any of the spices.  Instead I added salsa and a taco seasoning packet.  I also used about 1 cup of corn, refried beans, and black beans.  Everyone enjoyed this including my 8 year old son.

Decent meal, but not something that we will make again.  I added 2 jalapeno's to get some heat but the problem we found was the tortilla shell - it was soft and mushy.  I thought the butter might make it more crisp but it didn't - if we were to make this again, I would try frying the tortilla first.  Good meal, easy to make but nothing special.

For those concerned about health ingredients such as garlic salt, grated cheese, regular ground beef or refried beans substitute garlic powder, grated low fat cheese,low fat refried beans and ground chicken, all available at most leading grocery stores. Corn can be omitted. Brush tops with canola oil, salt free marg or salt free butter. Before serving top with fat free sour cream. All it takes is a little effort and imagination to make what was old new again, and it tastes just as good.

These were great. Surprisingly my favorite part was leftovers for lunch! This made 6 HUGE portions. I baked 2 of them for supper and the rest I froze before baking. Yesterday I set one out in the fridge overnight to thaw and brought it to work for lunch. Reheated in the microwave so it was more of a burrito rather than a chimi. I topped it with fresh salsa, and it was a fantastic work lunch.

Excellent- I often find that I just stick w/the basic 4-5 recipes I use for ground turkey & was looking for something different & since we love mexican- this was perfect! I did mix the refried beans w/the GT mixture & also added 1 4oz can of green chiles, added cheese into mixture as well and filled the flour tortillas all together. Baked & topped w/lettuce, tom & sour cream. Yum! Using 1lb of GT, I was able to get about 7 large filled chimi's, froze the rest. BF raved about these & said add them into rotation! Thanks for submitting, this is a great add for a mini mexican night at the house!

Yum! I followed this recipe as written, subbing green chiles for the green pepper, and tossing the whole shebang together rather than putting the cheese, beans, and meat mixture into the tortillas seperately. I quadrupled the recipe, fried some tonight, and will freeze a bunch to bake or fry later. Very good, thanks!

These were quite good!  The biggest thing we noticed with it was the sweetness, it just seemed a little too sweet.  I guessed it was the cumin, so next time I make it I will a tad less.  Strange thing is, when I had leftovers, I didn't add tomatoes to the top and it actually tasted a lot better.  It seemed the sweetness of it just didn't go with the taste of tomatoes.  So just a suggestion-try it without the toms and see how you like it.  We froze the leftovers and they microwaved beautifully and tasted wonderful.

We really enjoyed this dish especially since it was baked.  I only made enough for two but had extra meat mixture left over so I added it to some homemade queso and it was EXCELLENT!  I've started using that as my standard dip and my nephew said it was the best he'd ever had.  Give it a try!

These were very good.  I would rate them a 4.5 really.  I didn't have enough green pepper so I added a 4oz can of green chilis.  I also only put 1/2 cup of corn in and mixed the beans into the meat mixture!  Turned out great. Pretty easy to throw together.  I had some filling left over and it was great with tortilla chips!!!  Very authentic flavor!

This is the best baked chimi recipe I've found. I omitted the corn, and followed the suggestion of others and used a taco seasoning packet to save time. Just mix the taco seasoning in with the beans and meat, add some cheese, roll and bake. Easy and really good! I also made some white queso dip and put it on top (excellent). Just keep in mind, these are baked, not fried.

This recipe was really great!  I made it the first time a few months ago and it has become a staple of mine.  Even my youngest, who is extremely picky, gobbles it up.  I did modify a few things.  I left out the corn, doubled the meat and seasonings, but only increased the taco sauce slightly.  It made the chimichangas meatier and I topped them with cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream and served them.  YUM!!

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!! Such fresh flavor, not too tomatoey either!  The perfect combination.  I had this recipe printed out in my box for at least a year, finally tried it.  Amazing!!!  Thank you!! Left out the corn per taste, also used it for enchiladas instead of store bought sauce.  Just cooked the sauce ingredients seperate from the meat, mixed 1/2 in and poured 1/2 over the filled, rolled tortillas.  Thank you for the awesome recipe!! Making them tomorrow with roast beef!

Delicious!! I left out the green pepper because my husband does not like it, and they were still super tasty.  I used picante sauce instead of taco sauce - is there a difference? We will be making this one again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a pretty good recipe.  My hubby said it tasted "authentic". My daughter said it was ok. I did change just a few minor things.  I used garlic powder rather than garlic salt.  For the toppings instead of lettuce I chopped up some fresh cilantro, chopped tomatoes and sour cream.  Some of the other reviews mentioned that the top didn't brown as well as they like.  What I did for this was for the last 3 or so minuted I turned on the broiler and it worked nicely.  Just be sure to watch that it doesn't burn

This is very good! The beef mixture is great! I used black bean & corn salsa and 1 cup taco sauce. I would definately recommend to flip the chimi's over after the bottom is golden. This way both sides are crispy. Very good! A keeper!

This was so AWESOME, but what made it so great was not in the recipe. I made Mexican Rice III from this site and put a scoop full into each Chimi/burrito for the chimi itself, I only put a handful of corn in ( next time I will leave corn out) I only had 1 cup of taco sauce so I used one cup of salsa too, and no G.pepper so I used red. If your having a hard time with the shell, just sprinkle a little water on your hands when you wrap it up and it will help. I loved the baked shell mine were not really brown but great light crisp. I know that a chimi does not have rice in it, a burrito does, but a chimi doesnt have any kind of red sauces in them either, atleast none that I have ever had. And the rice that I made I had to use different color peppers also, but doesnt matter. I'm telling you if like Cilantro try this with the rice, its awesome. I think next time I will try the meat with no sauce maybe some spices then beans and rice, and dont forget the homemade guac. on top!!!!

I'll give it 4 stars, because the filling is very good. This is basically a baked burrito. I'll fry it next time to make it a chimi. It was still a good easy meal.

I was hoping these would be a little bit crispier, but I guess frying is the only way to get the crispiness you expect from chimichangas.  The taste was good, I followed the recipe except I omitted the green pepper because I did not have one, and I used pepper jack cheese to give it a little zing.  The leftovers look a little soggy, but I will try one today for lunch to see how it is.  Overall, a decent weeknight meal.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I substituted diced green chiles for the green bell pepper, as I don't care for bell pepper. I used sharp cheddar cheese and omitted the lettuce and tomato.  I cooked them for 15-20 minutes, then poured red enchilada sauce mixed with some green chiles over the top, and topped with more cheese.  They came out great!

Excellent!  I wasn't sure about the corn and green peppers, but we loved them just as the recipe was written and wouldn't leave them out!!  To save on time though,  I mixed the  refried beans and cheese right into the meat mixture instead of layering it. This was a big hit and we'll definitely make them again.

I took this to our church ladies group Christmas party, and several people asked for the recipe.  I did replace the corn with a can of drained black beans, and I added two diced cloves of garlic to the meat mixture.  I served with sour cream, lettuce, tomato, and black olives.  Great!

These were really good & really filling. I used one 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes with jalenpenos in place of the taco sauce & tomato.  Also left out the corn.  Browned thoroughly & came out nice & crispy on top.  Much better than fried! Very good!

I think this may have been the greatest thing i have ever eaten!  I added some cheese sauce to the tops of the chimis to put them over the top!!!  When my friends and family sat down to eat no one said a word, they were too busy eating!  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe.  I got lots of comments like ummm good mom!  I didn't have any taco sauce so I used a whole jar of salsa.  I made a beanless version for my son who doesn't like beans and he thought they were great.  We served with lettuce, tomato and sour cream.  These were a hit and definetly going to be on our list of favorites.

Very tasty chimichangas.  Do serve with sour cream and/or red enchilada sauce.  I used a taco sauce that had a smokey jalapeno flavor.  Will try the black beans - as suggested by another reviewer - instead of the refried beans.  Not authentic, but more healthy.  A great recipe.  Thanks, Nicole.

Wow!  This was great.  Dieting demands called for some changes, turkey instead of beef, lowfat beans, lowfat cheese, lowfat sour cream...the baking was the key, and a little butter won't hurt!!

This was very good.  I used shredded sirloin instead of ground beef, black beans instead of corn, and added some green chili peppers.  I think if you have the extra time, use shredded beef.

This were absolutely fantastic and probably one of the best things I've made for a while.  And they're filling.  I didn't use the lettuce or tomato or any sauce on the side -- didn't think they needed anything else.  Unfortunately kind of fattening, especially with all that cheese, but that's part of what made them good. :-)

These were great, and very filling. I served them with the Red Enchilada sauce from this site and had lettuce, tomato and sour cream on the side. Not only did the sauce taste nice with these, but really added to the visual appeal. The hardest thing about this recipe was rolling the tortillas correctly!

These received 2 forks up from everyone at our table, adults and children alike.  Made them according to what I had on hand....used 2 cups salsa for taco sauce; our refried beans were with cheese; had a pkg of 10 flour tortillas and we topped them with lettuce, black olives and more cheese.  Took a previous reviewers advice and sprayed our 13x9 with garlic-flavored spray, as well as the tops of the tortillas.  Yummy.  Will add to our menu rotation. Thanks Nicole, this is a great change from gorditas and burritos or tacos.

one of my favorite dishes to make, i use smashed black beans instead of canned and eliminate the corn, also use egg wash as a sealer.....you can put almost anything in the tortilla before frying and it comes out great!

LOVED it!!!  My husband doesn't like beans so i took them out and we didn't have peppers so i used salsa with peppers and just decreased the taco sauce a little since I added the Salsa... no cumin ($6 at grocery store so forget the cumin! lol) and it still turned out SUPER!!!!!!  Used a lot of cheese- yummy!  And put cheese on top during the last few min in oven... The sheell turned out soo good that I'm going to use this way of of cooking it with other fillers- chicken or steak!!!  Great and Easy recipe!!!!!!!!

Yummy!  When I tried these, I made just a couple changes.  I used butter-flavored PAM instead of butter (garlic flavored would be great too).. And before I baked them, I sprayed them lightly w/the PAM as well.  Only other thing- was to add a touch of fresh, chopped cilantro (YUMMMMM) to the final dish.  This is easy and great Nicole!!  Goes great with tortilla chips on the side to scoop up anything that falls out!  SUPER~ :)

They turned out great. I added tomatoes when I added the cheese (before baking). I used olive oil instead of butter and that worked nicely. Very yummy!

Super delish and instead of using a traditional flower tortilla I used a thinner home made version bough at a market.  They baked nicely after brushing them with the butter giving them a crispy effect instead of being deep fried.

My family doesn't like taco seasoning or taco sauce so I puréed dice tomatoes with green chilies and mixed with enchilada sauce to combine with the meat.  I also mixed the meat mixture with the beans.  Outstanding recipe

I was surprised at how well these turned out. Very tasty! A nice alternative to a burrito and a lot less greasy than a fried chimi. I used melted butter on the tortillas after wrapping up the contents to crisp them up in the oven. I will definitely make these again.

The only change I made was adding diced steak leftovers in with the onion and bell pepper. My husband is in love with these! He wants me to make them weekly now. Fantastic recipe.

This was an excellent and easy meal and easily fed our family of seven with some left over.  We have made it a couple times already and have added it to the recipe box for future use.  It was easy to make.

Wow'd the entire family. Twice I made enchiladas using this recipe AND helpful suggestions along with my own. 
  
CHANGES: 1. Substituted an orange bell pepper for the green pepper. Adds color and flavor. 
2. Added 7oz green chili peppers. 
3. Substituted enchilada sauce for the taco sauce, chili power, garlic and cumin.  
4. Served with guacamole, sour cream and extra shredded cheese on the side. 

This was a huge hit with 4 teenagers and myself.  It's probably not fair to rate this recipe because I altered it too much, but the kids were impressed and ask for these enchiladas regularly. Thank you to the community for sharing!

Delicious! I made it as written except  I used green onions (because I had some leftover from another dish), left out the green pepper and added a little cilantro. I didn't have taco sauce, so i used enchilada sauce. It took about 10 minutes longer to brown than the recipe says. Next time I'll try it with chicken.

Wow! I made this exactly as written except I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce because that's what I had an omitted the bell peppers. They were amazing! All three of my kids ate them up, and that is saying a lot because they don't eat much. This morning they asked it I could make them again for dinner. They were flavorful and perfectly crispy. You may want to let them sit for a bit before serving since the pouches hold in the heat and steam.

If you want these to be that nice "golden brown", you have to use real butter. Spreads have water added.

Since there are only 2 of us, but I needed to use up some ground beef so I made the full recipe.  There was enough for 6 chimichangas. I fried 2 and froze the others for another day.  I used half taco sauce and half mild salsa since I had that on hand.  Next time and there will be a next, I will use a spicier sauce to suit my taste.  Very yummy recipe!

So here is what I did because I had to improvise... I browned the meat with the onion then added a jar of my neighbors home made jarred chunky salsa which had green peppers, hot peppers, banana peppers and tomatoes. Then added a can of fiesta corn. mixed in a packet of taco seasoning then vola! filling complete! spread the refried beans on tortilla as directed put my meat filling in and added some extra cheese slices I needed to use up, rolled them bad boys up, put them in the oven with heavy butter coating them. came out golden and crispy. topped with sour cream, avocado, and salsa. YUM!

These were SO good. SO SO good! I am so glad I made them! I used extra lean beef (94/6), fat free beans and reduced the corn by about half. I took some other reviewers advice and brushed a little bit of melted margarine on top, to allow it to get crunchy. I cooked for only about 25 min, which was plenty of time for the inside to get super hot and then turned on the broiler for about 3 min, this helped the top brown and crisp some. Served them with light sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes...absolutely amazing.  Next time, I will probably omit the cheese, since it really doesn't add to the flavor but just adds fat and calories.

this is awesome.easy to make and the entire family enjoyed it so much i get to make it again as a regular meal on my days off. i used  Pam spray before putting them in the oven and baking them and omitted the corn because of allergies,also substituted homemade beans rather than the canned cause of the sodium contents. rather tasty.

I used leftover pot roast and added a can of diced green chilies.  Filling and quick to put together.  Didn't add quite as much taco sauce as it states.  Not sure how authentic it is but a tasty change from plain old tacos (though I must admit plain old tacos will probably always be our favorite Mexican meal)!

Very yummy and simple to make.  Oh but use medium tortillas.  I used large and they were hanging off the plate. I apparently do not know what a 12in tortilla is.  :)  But still delicious either way!!!!!!

These were delicious.  I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce (what we had on hand) and left out the pepper (family preference).  Even my picky kids ate it!

Delicious!  Followed the recipe as is, there is no need to alter.  I made a tray of 8, which was the perfect amount for 8 people.  TIP: If the tortillas are steamed/heated slightly they are less likely to tear & have the filling fall out.

This recipe turned out well. My only complaint is, it takes longer than the stated 45 minute total to make, and it takes longer than 30 minutes to brown. Other than that, my fam n I liked it. Thanks Nicole! :)

Wonderful recipe!!  My family absolutely devoured it!  I did a few things different, didn't change anything just skipped a few steps, added onion while the hamburger was browning then drained it and added everything else!!  I make my own taco seasoning from a recipe on here and it is fabulous!!  Also I baked it at 350 for 25 min. and then put shredded cheese on top and stuck it back in the oven until cheese melted!!  Served it with lettuce, tomato, salsa and sour cream!!!  Absolutely YUMMY!!!

Very yummy!  My husband and I really liked these!  I changed the recipe a little according to what I had on hand.  I'm sure they would have been just as good or even better if I had followed the recipe exactly.  I will be making these again!

Very good, as other reviewers suggested, I omitted the taco sauce and added taco seasoning. They certainly weren't wet, but the end result would have been better with a tomato flavor in it. Next time I will use taco sauce, just not as much as the recipe calls for.

I got "10" stars from my kids! They loved this!It wasn't too spicy so that was good for them, however; I do wish it was a little more spicy. In the future I'll probably not cook it as long, and when it's done, I'll put more cheese and taco sauce on top. Besides that, it was fantastic! And that's coming from a hispanic herself (; Thanks for sharing!

These were really good!! I added 1/4 tsp cayanne pepper to the hamburger mixture to spice things up a little and it really gave them a little something extra (but not burn your tounge off hot)! I also made a little bit of brown (rice with a mexican twist to add a little flavor) and put that on before the hamburger mixture to make them a little more filling. My husband is pretty picky and actually liked them so its a keeper in my books, but I wouldnt call them "knock your socks off delicious".

These are awesome.  I used canned beef instead of ground beef and only 1 cup taco sauce cause that is what I had on hand.  I reserved 1 cup of broth from the can of beef and made a spicy gravy to top the chimis using garlic powder, cumin, oregano, crushed red pepper, and black pepper and a roux of 2 T. oil and 2 T. flour.  My husband said they were "off the hook!"

These are amazing! I love my chimichangas fried, so I wasn't sure how much I'd like these baked, but they taste almost as good as the deep fried ones! This recipe is definitely worth a try. I didn't have corn on hand, so I omitted that, but next time I will definitely be trying it with corn. Yummy!

This was a delicious meal. I omitted the corn but did everything else as instructed. And I fried the burritos instead of baking them. They were perfect. I will definitely make these again.

My whole family enjoyed this, I did make a few changes, I added yellow and red peppers to the beef mixture and instead of salsa or cheese to the burrito I added queso dip to the beef mixture as well. I also added fresh cilantro at the last second, but I love using fresh cilantro. I baked them using convention roast (it browned them nicer than it would have using another setting) at 350F.  When I served one per  person I spooned some extra queso on top with more fresh chopped cilantro and then lettuce and sour cream for those that wanted it.  Basically you can stuff them anyway you want, be creative and add what you like. Great basic recipe!!

I followed the recipe exactly except 1)I doubled it, and 2)I used (because it was all I had) 2 c. salsa, 1 c taco sauce and 1 cup enchilada sauce in place of 4 c. taco sauce. It was delicious. Will definitely be making again! Thanks!

I only gave this 4 stars because it's so delicious that it's not fair that it's so high calorie!

My husband loves this dish, we eat it once a week and save extras for his lunch that he shares with his coworkers - they love it too! My favorite part about this recipe is the time the chimis spend in the oven is an opportunity to clean the kitchen, take a shower, or get something else taken care of before dinner starts. 
Very good, yum yum yum.  My thighs love them too. Haha. :)

These were so delicious! I added some sausage too. And cooked black beans on my slow cooker, then blended them and added it to the ground beef. Served it with home made salsa.

This recipe was very tasty.  I didn't have 2 c of taco sauce, so I substituted 1 c of salsa and it tasted fine.  Definitely leave them in the oven for at least the full 30 minutes, so the tortillas crisp up.  I used high fiber tortillas and low fat beef to make it a healthier option.

Used one bag of frozen Mexican veggies instead of fresh... Corn onions and bell peppers. And used rotel instead of taco sauce and burrito seasoning instead of spices listed...will make again with origional ingredients. This was great!

Loved these!!!  Reduced the green pepper to about 1/4 cup.  These brown up nicely in the oven to get a nice crispiness on the outside.  The filling is spiced just right, and I really like the addition of the corn and beans.  Topped with a little more taco sauce and sour cream, these made for a delicious southwestern dinner.

I found this to be very delicious. Make sure you completely cover the tortillas in butter before they go in the oven so that they will be nice and crisp. I served this with a green sauce over the top. Sour cream is good on the top to.

I used about a half cup more taco sauce and added hot sauce to my butter that I brushed onto the tortillas.  These were great and a very cheap and easy dish to make.

Absolutely an amazing dish!!  My whole family (kids too)  love these!!  I do make a few minor adjustments..I use a bag of frozen veggies (a southwest flavored mix) (you'll want to drain after these heat up) & I cut the chili powder & the cumin in half.  I also use enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce (it's just whats in my pantry). Thanks for a great recipe!!

Although this dish was easy to make, it didn't taste very good.  It was way way too salty.  I think it would taste really good if it weren't overpowered with sodium.  I don't think I'll ever make this again, but if I do, I'd use 1/2 the amount of taco seasoning.  I believe this is where the salt is coming from.  Not a very good dish.

I tripled this recipe and put them in freezer bags in the freezer hoping I'd be ahead of the game a little with prepared food.  The family loves them & I can't keep them stocked fast enough. We've baked & fried them and we like both ways.  Very versatile- we've used black beans in place of refried and they are very good also. Thank you for the recipe Nicole!

This recipe is phenomenal! My husband doesn't even care much for Mexican food and it is now one of his favorites! I only made a slight alteration, (added a small can of ChiChi's chili peppers) which is rare for me. I usually try to get creative. This recipe didn't require it, though. I would recommend that you get 2 cans of beans if you want enough for all of them. I went pretty skimpy on each one and still almost ran out. These are just so easy and so delicious, I can't say enough about it! :)

I made these tonight and they were such a big hit!! Thank you to whomever sent it in! I made the beef and bean, then a couple of bean and cheese (for my picky eater), added side of mexican rice (cheated-made store packaged), and velveeta and rotel. Thumbs up from all of us!

We thought these were great - even as leftovers.  They didn't get as crisp on the outside as I expected, and if you cook them too long, the burritos will start to split.  But, we loved the way they tasted and how easy they are to make.  Will definitely make these again!

This was excellent. I had only 1 cup of Taco sauce, so I substituted 1 cup of lime salsa. I used whole wheat tortillas. Oh, I forgot to put the cheese inside but it turned out to be a happy accident! I just covered them with cheese for the the last 15 minutes and they were awesome! The spices are perfectly balanced and I wouldn't mess with them. This will become a regular, thanks!

Mmmmmm, these are very good. The picture of these is somewhat odd to me. The recipe is also at the end. It states to add cheese and then brush tops with melted butter. Not sure why you would do that. I put the cheese on the inside of each Chimi and brushed the tops with the butter, then baked them. Also, only baked for 20-22 minutes. If I would have gone any longer, my tortillas would have been burnt to a crisp. Flavor is absolutely awesome!

YUM! YUM! YUM!  I made these for the first time and had my parents over.  The recipe is perfect.  I didn't want my Chimichanga's tasting like taco's so I went exactly like the recipe calls for.  This is definitely a keeper!!  Thank you for a new addition to my dinner rotation :)

These were great.  I did what some of the other reviewers suggested and just added the beans with the hamburger mixture.  My fiancee loved them also. We had a lot of leftover meat mixture so he made another Chimichanga for breakfast only added some scrambled eggs to it.  He loved it.

Yummm!  I wil admit I made a few changes.  Per other reviews, I took the easy way out. In place of the seasonings, onion, green pepper, taco sauce I used taco seasoning, reg. black beans and Ro*tel. It was easy and fast.  The butter brush on and baked is a great answer for those of us that don't deep fry.

These were absolutely delicious. I did as other reviewers suggested and mixed the beans with the meat filling; it was so much easier. I also brushed mine with olive oil instead of butter. Everyone was impressed with how tasty these turned out. I will be using this recipe again and again. This one is a keeper! Thanks for submitting this one, Nicole!
Update 4/3/16: I made these again and I brushed them with avocado oil this time and it was even better! I also did a picadillo style meat filling this time as well, it was spicy and absolutely amazing. You can do so much with this recipe. I skipped the corn when I did it this time because I added more onion and bell pepper. I also added 6 chopped Serrano peppers, 2 habaneros and some tomato sauce. I cooked it down til the sauce thickened and then mixed in the refried beans and simmered it for about 10 minutes. It turned out perfect and it made a nice change to a great recipe that we use a lot in my family. Tip: use the leftover filling to make quesodillas or to top tostadas and then bake them in the oven til they're crispy.

We thought these were extremely tasty. They didn't really remind of any chimichangas I've ever had in the past, even though I did replace the bell pepper with anaheims (because I've never had bells in food like this and we prefer pretty much any other kind of pepper ever). I also omitted the corn, because I personally don't like it. I found this recipe to fill more than 8 tortillas though I confess I'm not sure I got 12s, they may have been 10s, I didn't measure them and the bags didn't specify. I put the extra mixture into corn tortillas and it tasted great but they broke so they weren't pretty. All in all we really enjoyed these and they were quite low-fat (used fat free refried beans) and used maybe half as much cheese as the recipe called for. Served with picante sauce and a little sour cream on the side, we loved them :) Thanks for the recipe!

VERY GOOD! I omitted the corn because I thought I had a can, but didn't. I also added some black beans. I really can't believe how good these turned out and I will definately be making them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I like that these are baked instead of fried. I omit the chopped onions and green bell peppers and substitute 1 tblsp taco seasoning for the taco sauce. Serve with salsa and sour cream along with the lettuce and tomato

I really liked the simplicity of this dish, my husband thought it was missing texture. Minor changes to fit what I had on hand: Enchilada sauce for taco sauce, green chilies for green peppers, no corn, Emeril SW seasoning for cumin. I can't believe I'm out of cumin! I cooked the onions with the meat, mixed the meat, beans, enchilada sauce, chilies, and seasoning all together. Assembled and baked per the recipe but I flipped them halfway through. Easy and tasty!

Great basic recipe...I followed another reviewer's and used enchilada sauce with a little dab of sour cream mixed in...after cooking in the oven I poured the sauce over the chimichangas added Monterey Jack cheese and popped back in the oven to for about 10 minutes. Served with lettuce tomatoe, and more sour cream...Delicious...Make your own enchilada sauce using Emerill's recipe on the food network, very easy and very good!!

These were great! I did mix the beans in with the meat mixture as well to save myself a step. I added some cheese to the top after they browned up. Delish and a great addition to our Mexican rotation. Thanks for the great recipe

These were delicious!!! I had a recipe for something very similar & these were by far the best ones I've ever made! They were so easy to make as well. The only changes I made was I used salsa in place of the taco sauce & I didn't spread the refried beans on the tortilla. Instead after I browned my meat & added the veggies I cooked them until they were cooked through & then added the beans to the skillet & mixed it all together. This is the way I do tacos & so I just did the same thing. I like them better cooked & it make it more filling than just spreading on the tortilla (but thats just the way I like to do it!) They were delicious, my hubby & I both really enjoyed these! I think next time I make them after I brush them with butter I'm going to bake them & then sprinkle some more cheese on top the last 5 minutes of baking them cause we are cheese lovers!! Excellent recipe :)

My kids like chimis, but I rarely make them because of the fat in frying them. Saw this and thought it was worth trying. Well, they turned out nice and crisp! I left out the corn (family preference) and cut way back on the taco sauce. I also added more cumin and spices, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Definite kid pleaser!

My entire family loved this recipe--even my very picky brother in law.  The only changes I made, were to add a little diced, canned Jalepeno, and instead of brushing with butter, I sprayed the Chimi's lightly with cooking spray.

Delicious....I cheated and used taco seasonings to cut time.  The only thing that I did different was that I brushed the Chimichangas with vegetable oil then placed them on a cookie sheet. And at the the last 10 minutes, I brushed them the butter.......

I'd recommend using the seasoning in the recipe rather than a store bought taco seasoning, its so much better! Be careful not to put too much refried beans on the tortillas, I went a little overboard and ended up with beans shooting out of the chimichangas.

By far the best recipe!!  Doubling the recipe isn't enough to satisfy my family's need for thirds on this meal.  I loved it!  We all loved it!  You can use any meat you have on hand.  The last batch I made was from leftover Pot Roast.  I imagine with Thanksgiving round the corner the next version will be with turkey.

The first time I made these my husband was surprised at how good they were (I'm not the greatest chef). These are a regular on our menu now. Last time I made a double batch and froze half the filling so I can have a quick go-to freezer meal again. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I first started making this 5 years ago and it's been a staple in our house ever since.  I make a double batch, then wrap individually in plastic wrap and pop them into large freezer bags so we always have a stash. I also add fresh cilantro to give it a fresh flavor.

My husband really enjoyed this as did I! I changed it up a little bit and took the advice from a few others and added taco seasoning instead of the other seasonings. It was a lot quicker. My husband is picky and I omitted the corn, tomatoes, green peppers and lettuce. Instead of onion I used onion powder. I used sour cream after and it was an awesome meal!!!!

I made this recipe exactly as is but omitted corn.  I didn't have any on hand.  I thought the theory behind this was good...I will use this recipe as a base...but it was missing something.  Our local mexican restauraunts chimichanga is usually more creamy cheesey inside. but overall nice for a change of pace. thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe as written. I definatley think it had too much corn, the taco sauce gives it a 'taco bell' so to speak flavor. I did use the refried black beans which i prefer over regular refried beans. This recipe did not seem like an authentic tasting mexican recipe, just an americanized burrito. Thanks for sharing though

Love them!  Didn't have taco sauce, but made some up with ingredients I had at home.  They come out nice and crispy from the oven without the grease of being fried.

Great taste.  I used a can of tomato sauce and taco seasoning because I always have those on hand.  I finely diced the green peppers and onions in my food processor and my 3 year old didn't even know.  He ate them up without complaint!

I will admit right off the bat that I thought the tortillas in my pantry weren't as old as they apprently were...and thus very crumbly.  Since I couldn't get my tortillas to roll very well, I just layered everything lasagna style.  The dish certainly didn't qualify for a chimichanga, but it tasted just as good and was even easier to put together.  So, my laziness and forgetfulness has now lead to a new recipe in my household.  I mixed in my refried beans with the beef mixture and used cheddar cheese instead of mont. jack.  I used a combination of taco sauce and pizza sauce since again, I thought I had more of it in the pantry.  I added half a packet of taco seasoning to make up for it, and it was fantastic.  Great recipe, even with all my screw-ups.  That totally deserves all 5 stars!

Oh, how I love the butter and bake technique. And the filling is fabulous too!

I followed the recipe and thought the filling was good. I just couldn't make the chimi's. My tortillas kept splitting and they were fresh. I also don't feel the instructions were clear enough on how to fold them. We ended up eating burritos.

This was awesome! I used 8 oz. of Monterrey Jack and 8 oz. of sharp cheddar, instead of all Jack, but other than that, I followed the recipe. The kids and hubby loved them too! I sealed the leftovers in individual bags and tossed them in the freezer for future lunches.

This recipe tastes great, I do recommend however that you use a large bar pan to cook these on since they need space in between each one so they brown up nice and crispy!

My family didn't care for this. I think one reason was too much corn. I'd recommend cutting back for those who want to try it.

Absolutely delicious!  Followed advice of others and left out the corn and added beans to meat mixture while cooking.  I used l/o roast instead of hamburger.  Sauted onions and peppers than added meat and beans.

This was really good!  One tortilla makes a huge portion!  I took the advice of others and used a taco seasoning packet.  I added black beans to the beef mixture, and spread the refried beans on the tortilla like the recipe called for.  This became good "glue" when I was trying to fold the chimichangas!  I forgot to put cheese inside, so I sprayed the tortillas with Pam and put the cheese on top.  I didn't bake it the entire way (my husband was hungry and cranky) but it turned out good.  One thing though, my husband thought the filling tasted like chili.  Don't know what that is about, but I might switch up some ingredients next time.  Thank you!

I just have to say that I was seriously disappointed in this recipe. It was so very bland, that my family doesn't want me to fix it again. I'm sure that doctoring it up would probably help, but I won't try this recipe again, since my family was so unimpressed with the dish.

Made a few revisions.  First, like many other reviewers I added a small can of tomato sauce and a packet of taco seasoning to the meat. Second, I added a spoonful of tomatoes and chilis on top of the meat mixture inside each chimichanga.  Third I used whole wheat tortillas and sprayed the tops with Pam before sticking in the oven.  Third, I sprinkled cheese on top of them with about 5 minutes to go.

Easy and delicious! :)

I followed some of the other reviews and used a taco seasoning and some taco sauce, I also added green chiles instead of green pepper. Thanks for the recipe!!

MMMMMMMMMMMM! These were SO good!! Made a double batch and put the extras in the freezer, wrapped them individually in saran wrap. Popped a couple - frozen - in the oven, took about 35 minutes, turned half way thru, and they were just as crispy and great as they were the first time. Will make these again for sure!

Very good.  We substituted green chiles for the pepper and buttered both sides and flipped half way through.  This makes a ton, so either cut in half or freeze half.

These were wonderful. My hubby ate 2 of them.  The only thing that I would change is to season the refried beans a bit more. Otherwise, these were fantastic and I'll be making them again!

I left out so much on this recipe I am not sure I should even rate it but here it goes. I didn't add the oinions, peppers, corn, or taco sauce. I also used the Taco Seasonings 1 recipe from this site instead of only using the spices recommended in this recipe. I also mixed the beans right into the meat and it was creamy enough which is why I omitted the taco sauce. By the time I got to rolling the meat/bean mixture into my corn tortillas I realized the tortillas were too old and kept cracking so I made a layered casserole and baked that way. Served with sour cream and salsa. It was pretty good but next time I am going to make sure I have fresh tortillas because I really wanted chimichangas not a casserole.

This was wonderful.  I didn't have taco sauce so I used enchilada sauce.  (1 can red, 1/2 can green)  My family loved it!  I will surely make it again.

good change of pace from tacos :) I used one small can of diced chiles instead of green pepper and it was tasty :) will probably cut back the taco sauce to 1.5 cups instead of 2 next time. My chimis overflowed into the pan a bit more than I liked. I also skipped the butter and pamed the bottom/sides of the pan and then put more pam on top of the tortillas once in the pan. They still browned nicely.

I had extra meat and cheese leftover after filling the burritos and spread it on top before baking - so these were more like Burritos Enchilada Style rather than Chimichangas, but DELICIOUS nevertheless.

YUM YUM! These chimichangas, my family's first, made our Cinco De Miyo a great time! We used Italian spiced ground turkey because it was all that was available (and my mom can't eat beef), and it turned out wonderful. All the leftovers were eaten, and they made a beautiful presentation. Thank you!

Great recipe...simple and inexpensive to make.  I love the idea they are baked and not deep fried to save on fat intake.  Took them to a Mexican theme party and they were gone in no time.  I always serve with salsa, sour cream and guacamole

Awesome recipe!!  Some changes I made: Like one of the other reviewers suggested, I used "Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Beef" recipe from this site in place of ground beef. I used 2 cups salsa since that's what I had, added some jalapeno for additional spiciness, used Garlic Powder instead of salt since that was also all I had.  I put enchilada sauce on top, only because I had an extra can from my last mexican fiesta that I wanted to use up.

This was similar to a dish I get at La Hacienda, local mexican joint in High Point, NC called Chimichangas Supreme.  Next time I make this to make it more like that dish I will use beef tips and put melted cheese on top after complete.

Contrary to what another reviewer stated, I think these make EXCELLENT leftovers, just had last nights for lunch today and will finish up the rest for dinner tonight.  Still ended up freezing some of the mixture for next time.  

Recipe is definately a keeper - thanks for adding to my amazing mexican dish recipes.

I will put less corn in next time and more cheese inside and on top. I thought they were very good. We served with a hot salsa and sour cream, but guacamole would have made it AWESOME!

I made this last night and couldn't be pleased with how they turned out! The only change to the recipe I made was I used 1 cup taco sauce and 1 cup salsa (rather than 2 cups taco sauce). I had a little mix meat leftover since I didn't want to over stuff the tortillas but otherwise I think the ingredient measurements are right on. This recipes makes a great meal and I'm eating the leftovers right now and it's even better - definitely restaurant quality and easy to make. I will be making this a lot!

This was really a great meal. I made a few changes that added something a little "extra". - added a small layer of black olives, jalapenos, and cheese inside the wrap. Topped it with a little bit of cheese and salsa, came out perfect! Next time I plan on trying it with the black bean refried beans. To cut down on prep-time I used my bag of seasonal (frozen onions and bellpeppers already pre-cut) yummy!

These are very good, a hit with even my picky eaters. I like to serve this with spanish rice and refried beans, and the left over's heat up really well.

Neither my husband or I would consider Mexican food our favorite.  In fact we rarely eat it, but for some reason I was wanting something Mexican and decided to make these.  We both LOVED these Chimichangas, and I'm even looking forward to making them again.  Only thing I did differently was I used salsa instead of taco sauce, because that's all I had.

This was fantastic!  My husband and kids really loved it.  It's hard to find recipes that kids like as well as adults.  I didn't use the taco sauce.  Instead, I used two cups of Old El Paso enchilada sauce.  Very yummy!  I do agree with some of the other reviews that these are more like a baked burrito rather than a chimichanga.  Will make again.

We loved this! Even my finicky kids ate it!! I only made a few changes...instead of the taco sauce & spices, I used salsa. I added the beans to the meat mix and sprinkled the cheese after cooking and popped back into warm oven to melt & served with spanish rice. YUMM!!

This was a great meal for a family with teenagers. I added black beans and black olives, upped the spices and used hot salsa instead of taco sauce. I also tossed in a smattering of cayenne pepper to give it a kick. They turned out nice an crispy, as I put them under the broiler for a minute. Next time I'll add green chiles, but I'll definitely make it again. My husband is from New Mexico and these dishes are never hot enough for him!

I have to agree with some that said the filling was okay,it did seem to lack the kick that I was expecting it to have. I think next time I will add a can of rotel to it.

This was an excellent recipe.  Left out the corn only becuz I didn't have any in the house.  I did use a packet of taco mix to add to the hamburg instead of using separate spices.  Came out awesome.  I also topped them with salsa & sour cream along with lettuce & tomato.  I'll definitely make these again.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

I was really looking forward to making these, as past reviews were overall positive.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with those who said this was just 'okay'.  Filling was good, but nothing special.  While the tortilla did get nice and crispy in the oven, it just didn't have that good chimichanga flavor.  Just tasted like a baked burrito.  Thanks for the recipe, but the "chimichanga" in the title is sadly misleading.

I don't know why I did rate this recipe sooner.   I made this again, last night, and it's wonderful.   You can alter it to suit your taste buds.   I used a salsa instead of a taco sauce and it worked out wonderfully.   Love it.   I even had a leftover chimichanga for lunch and it's excellent reheated.

OLE!  Wow, we loved this.  After baking we quick fried the chimichanga in a small amount of oil.  It crisped it and browned it beautifully.  I'm having a leftover one for lunch right now.  Yum!  You're going to like this recipe.

Simply delicious.  I usually order the chimichangas from a popular local Mexican restaurant, but always find they're slightly too greasy.  This recipe is amazing! The flavour is quite similar to the restaurant, but without the greasiness.  My husband & toddler were in heaven.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy, and very good.  I made everything exactly the way the recipe read.  The only thing I will do next time is top it off with sour cream along with the tomatoes, and lettuce.  I also will melt some extra cheese on top.  Overall great!  My roommate had seconds, and commented on how much he liked them.  I had a lot of left over meat that I will probably use as filling for taco's or something tomorrow night.

This was a decent low-fat version of a chimichanga, (but isn't that kind of like vegetarian meatballs?) If I'm not going to fry it, I'd rather have a burrito!

YUMMY!  These were so easy to make, I omitted the veggies and used taco seasoning and the taco sauce with the meat.  I really liked the baked, makes me think they are healthier.  Watch out Taco Bell, here comes Taco Amy!

These were excellent!  After starting the recipe, I realized that I was lacking cumin and chili powder.  I used taco seasoning instead.  It turned out very nice.  To prevent the chimis from sticking to my cookie sheet, I put parchment paper on the sheet.  I think that using all the cheese was really delicious!

Very good recipe. We put sour cream and salsa on top. Next time I will get more tortillas and put less filling in htem. They were really large. We only used about 4 oz of cheese rather than the 1 #.

Easy to make - maybe good to have in the fridge for kids, but not for me -- I thought they were bland and I didn't care for the texture of the baked tortilla - everything except the very top was slimy.

Tasty. On the first go around, I felt like it was maybe missing something, but the next day, it was even better. I used medium salsa instead of taco sauce (taco sauce always seems too bitter), and only 8 oz of cheese. Could have maybe done with a bit more chili powder, but overall, we liked it and I'm sure I'll make it again.

I am not sure why everyone loves this so much. I thought it was just fair. It was fairly easy to prepare but it was kind of boring and bland. and the size of the tortillas were to big. I wouldn't bother making this again.

Delicious!  I used ground turkey and taco seasoning and they were great!  They turned out a lot crispier than I expected!

My husband absolutely loved this!  I did make a few minor changes - I used salsa instead of taco sauce and added a can of cheddar cheese soup to sort of hold all the ingredients together.  He raved about this - a definite keeper that I will make again.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

This was quick, easy, and very good.  I didn't have any taco  or enchilada sauce so I combined a small jar of mild salsa and a 15oz can of diced tomatoes that I pureed in the food processor.  It worked just fine except I should have drained the canned tomatoes.  Also added ½ tsp salt and some pepper. I will make these again.

Delicious. I left out the onions and green pepper. I thought the taco sauce would have those flavors. They turned out great. I made a mexican night theme with my husband. I started with tortillas chips and salsa and mixed up some tequila with strawberry magarita mix and crushed ice. On to the main course served with spanish rice and sour cream.My husband thought they were great.

This was a good recipe. Brushing the outsides of the tortillas with the butter made them come out of the oven an delectable golden color and gave them a pleasing crunchy texture to bite into. I used a jar of pico de giao salsa for the colorful filling which gave it a nice texture. We were happy with this dish.

SUPER RECIPE...Made this for my Cinco de Mayo Party this year and everyone raved.  We had a contest for best food and I won with this recipe.  They looked beautiful and tasted amazing.  I made the meat mixture the day before to make it easy to assemble when ready to party. THIS ONE'S A KEEPER.

These were delicous!  The only change I will make, is to used shredded beef the next time I make them, simply because my husband would prefer it, and I think it would taste delious too.  Even my kids gobbled these down!

So good, and easy!!!  I just used meat and beans.  No corn, green pepper or onion, and we loved it.  I think I will use shredded beef next time, and maybe even add some potato!  They were crunchy and good.  Such a great alternative to typical burritos!

This was tasty.  I tried to make a taco sauce out of taco seasoning and water (since that's what I had), and also used mostly corn tortillas since I only had one flour tortilla.  I probably won't do that again!  The flour tortilla ones were much better, I thought.  This is a rather low rating from my house, but I will definitely keep this in the rotating recipes because it is fun and different.

This recipe is awsome.  My husband just loves it and there were no left-overs the first time I made it.  He even said that it is better than going to a Mexican restaurant.  I would add a little more Tabasco, but I like things really spicy.  DELICIOUS!

Very good chimichangas.  I liked that they were baked instead of fried.  Instead of ground beef, I used shredded roast beef that I had leftover from another meal.

I didn't have any bell pepper on hand so had to omit them. I used chunky salsa instead of the taco sauce as there are peppers in the salsa. I made my own refried beans which is so easy and much less expensive that buying a can already prepared.  We all really liked this recipe.  Served with green salad on the side.

We usually like this type of meal, but these just didn't do it for us.  I made a few minor changes but not enough to make a huge difference.  Baking them was a good idea, but just didn't turn out very well.  We won't be making them again.

We followed the recipe almost exactly and my husband is in love. He said this is his favorite thing we’ve made in a long time. The only thing I changed was we brushed butter on both sides before we rolled and stuffed them. I read a few other recipes that did this and it worked perfectly. A+

Real good. Helps to mix beans with beef mixture so it’s even inside chimichangas.

I changed this up just a bit by omitting the corn and using taco seasoning mix. The mix, along with the other seasonings made it too salty, so I added a dollop of tomato paste, and it was perfect! I think my oven temp is just a bit lower than it reads, so after the recommended cooking time, mine didn’t look very brown so I turned on the broiler for just a couple of minutes. That did the trick and they turned out perfect! I will definitely return to this recipe again!

It definitely doesn’t need 2 cups of taco sauce— more like 1/2 cup— but the rest of the recipe was FIRE

Followed exactly, except I used black bean refried beans. Next time I will bake just a tiny bit longer for an even crispier outcome.  Delicious, my three teenage girls loved it.

Unlike most of the reviews, I made this as written and was not disappointed. The flavor was great and it was fairly easy to make. The only changes I am going to make for next time is I will omit the corn and fry these instead of baking. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Delicious!  Even better the next day heated in the oven for a few minutes for lunch!   I used a can of Chile peppers in place of the green pepper and used 3/4 cup of corn.  I only used 8 ounces of taco sauce.    I used a little smear of beans to seal the tortilla shells and baked for about 35 minutes.  Served with Spanish rice and air fried green beans (odd combo but had to get my greens in and didn’t feel like a salad - lol).  Yum!!

I was looking for a good un-fried chimichanga recipe to work with, and this is it!  As with any recipe of this type, you can change the ingredients inside to your own tastes -- we omitted the corn and used smashed black beans instead of canned refried.  But I followed all the given cooking instructions and the texture was just what I was looking for -- crisp on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside.  I've done this as a main dish and also smaller ones as appetizers.

Good, but lacking something I'm familiar with. It also works to get a sheet pan screaming hot in the oven, put a little oil spray on it, then lay it down seam side down. Gets a "fried" texture to it. Brush with butter on the top per instructions and you can also flip that, too to get both sides "fried."

Excellent flavor for the number of ingredients and ease of this recipe! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and made some of the modifications mentioned by other reviewers. I cooked the ground turkey with the onion, then added taco seasoning, beans, corn, and spices. I added a can of tomatoes with green chilies instead of bell pepper (didn't have just green chilies on hand). Not sure if this was what enhanced the flavor so much but we loved it. Will definitely save this recipe and make again for an easy dinner or even for guests.

I made these exactly as written other than frying instead of baking and they were absolutely fantastic.  I was a little nervous about how the bell pepper and corn would go over with my often picky family but they raved about dinner and have asked me to keep extras on hand in the freezer.  This recipe is definitely a winner!

I made this tonight and it was a BIG hit.  I made some modifications based on what i had on hand - using black beans instead of refried beans and enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  The flour tortillas came out so crispy/crunchy that you would never know they were not fried (except they weren't greasy).  This recipe will go in our regular meal rotation!

Pleasantly surprised with how delicious this is! Chimichangas are my favorite dish so I had low expectations given the ingredients list. I'm the shredded beef, deep-fried type. I used a medium taco sauce and garnished with cilantro. My husband and I LOVED IT! Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  I made it at the last minute without having toppings or enough taco sauce, but used some salsa instead.  It is a bit heavy on the corn, but essentially the recipe is wonderful.  I ate one and a half and my three year old ate her whole (smaller) one!  Thank you, she is picky!

My 8 year old food critic son loved these. 
I took the advise of another reviewer and added enchilada sauce and green chilies as well as reduced the corn a bit. We will definitely make these again! Thanks for the recipe

The best!!!!  I made this last year and have scoured allrecipes to try to find this recipe.  Then...aha!.  I sent it to my Mother in law over my e-mail and finally, after 45 minutes procured this recipe.  Making it for our friends tomorrow.  My husband doesn't eat red meat, but chopped up chicken works a treat.  A++++++++++++++

Filling, easy, and tasty. I made with ground turkey, 1 can enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, 4 oz green chiles instead of green pepper, and refried black beans. The filling only lasted for 7 chimichangas, as I felt that making them smaller would have been too heavy on the tortilla. I will definitely be making these again!

My family loves these! I did tweak: season beef with salt, pepper, adobo with cumin and maybe a little extra cumin. mix cooked & drained ground beef 2lbs with 1 pouch green enchilada sauce and 1 can refried beans. Add 1 cup or so of thawed frozen corn. Heat through. On tortilla add 2 Tbsp cooked brown rice, 2 Tbsp shredded cheddar, about 2/3 cup meat mixture. Very very very yummy :)

I've made these twice, exactly as the recipe calls. They were a HUGE success. The second time I made them, I did three batches, one for meal swap with my neighbor, one for my family, and one for a family with a sick mom. They remind me of the frozen burritos you can buy in individual packages, but about 100% tastier and better! Love that you can make ahead and bake when ready, and they heat up beautifully as leftovers. A+ recipe!

We loved this recipe! Any leftovers caused a race to the fridge to eat it for breakfast. The only change we made was using cubed stew beef and slow cooked it in the crock pot. We also made our own fresh taco sauce. Because it is baked instead of deep fried, this recipe can very guiltlessly find a permanent spot in the regular weekly dinner menu.

It's quick and easy.  Beef mixture was good and can be tweaked for personal preferences.  Didn't care for the use of flour tortillas as they get hard and tough as they bake.  Try using puff pastry cut into rectangles and filled as per directions.  Fluffy and light and a closer match to an authentic chimichanga.

My whole family loved it. I've made it 2x now and did some adjustments but it  the original is good too. My family has individual taste buds so  I make the basic meat  in  a crock pot with 2 .5 lb  butt roast. Less fat than the chuck roast which is fatty and can make the meat mushy.  Plus the Butt round shreds real nice. I let it simmer for 12 hours or so with all the seasons plus I added 1Tbsp of chipolte  for extra flavor.  Because it asks for 2 cups of beef broth it can be very liquidy.  When its done. the recipe says not to drain but I had too because the juice made a mess of the tortilla when preparing and rolling up. So I drained and began to load on lg tortillas adding everyone's favorite ingredients. Some I layered with refried beans  then shredded beef, than  Monterrey  jack cheese. Others chimis i put on green chili's. This shredded beef recipe is a perfect base to add what ever specalties your heart desires.I will this recipes again and again. Its so easy

The only thing different I did was use queso cheese on the inside of the chimichanga and a little bit of Monterrey jack shredded cheese on the top. SO easy will make this often.

I left out the corn used 1  1/2 cup taco sauce.  Really good! like that can bake them.  I like to use Corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas, more flavor.  So good to freeze ahead of time, having homemade convenience food.

Ok, I like to use Pepper Jack cheese and cooked shredded chicken for variety.

Thanks to your recipe I  made the best chimichanga we ever had. I followed your direction, I loved the idea of spreading refried beans on the tortilla before adding the filling. I left out corn, used a cup of salsa. Chopped red peppers, one onion along with the pound of hamburger. I put vegetable oil on the baking sheet rubbed some oil on the tortillas before wrapping them up.  Baked them about 15 minutes at 350. Slather on the sour cream and serve with a green salad.
Thanks again!

The whole family loves these. They will become a regular part of our menu. Next time I think j will use taco seasoning packets instead of taco sauce. Same taste and a lot cheaper.

So easy to make and delicious!  I think I overstuffed the tortillas because they leaked a bit but I'll reduce the filling next time. They came out crispy without being fried. Followed the recipe except I didn't have any garlic salt so I just added garlic powder and then salted to taste and I left out the corn.   Served with Mexican rice and sour cream. My husband had seconds!  He loved it!  Will definitely make this again.

Loved this! I modified it a bit, though, for speed and to accommodate my vegetarians. I browned 1/2 lb beef and 1/2 package veggie crumbles in two separate pans and added taco seasoning to taste instead of the listed spices. Everything else I did the same. I topped it with lettuce, chopped tomatoes, a dollop of sour cream, and chives for garnish. So good! Thanks for the recipe!

I admit I had to switch things up a wee bit only because of what I had in the fridge. I switched up taco sauce for salsa and cheddar for mozzarella. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe. My family LOVED it. My picky eater 19 year old son was thrilled to find another one on the pan. We've already figured out how we're going to make these at camp this summer.

I didn't exactly follow the recipe but I used it as a guide for a baked chimichanga. I'm a vegetarian so no meat but I substituted black beans. I also didn't use the taco sauce but rather I used a mole sauce I had made for a different recipe. All other ingredients and cooking instructions were followed. They came out crunchy and delicious without the fat from frying. The hubby loved them! Will use again!

I've made this twice now and it is very good and so easy.  I omitted the green bell pepper and corn only because my family is not a fan, but we didn't miss them at all!  So good.

Used garlic not garlic salt to cut down on sodium content
The description states baked not fried, but this recipe may as well be classified as fried with the brushing the tortillas with melted butter before baking. Skip this step to have a less fat/calorie entree.

My wife absolutely loves these!  I made them the first time strictly as the original recipie called for. They turned out great! The next time I had some chicken I needed to use and no refried beans.........no worries they were still amazing. Like others I used a packet of taco seasoning for both types of meat. Don't forget the corn! It really adds to the overall flavor. It is in our families dinner rotation for good.

Made it as is, came out fine. If you like spicy,  then you may want to turn up the heat by adding some jalapeños maybe.  I was surprised by receiving several compliments from my picky 12 year old.

I also cheated and added taco seasoning mix with tomato sauce.  I also made a ancho-chipotle cream sauce to smother them with at the end.  I know it is not very conventional with chimichangas, but it worked out great!

I used canned corn with diced peppers in it to save myself the extra step.  I ended up filling the tortillas too full so they were too hard to pick up and eat. Burt a delicious recipe as is.  Thanks!

Easy to make and fun.  Lots of opportunity for tweaking spices or ingredients of substance.  Great dish for not a bunch of work and time.  It's hard to screw it up.

I changed the recipe by deleting the green bell peppers and corn by adding 1 small can of diced green chilies and 1 small can of jalapeno peppers.  For those who like them really hot use 2 small cans of jalapeno peppers.

The recipe cook time just needed to be longer than stated. I left mine for 40 mins and still wasn't brown enough so I had to leave it longer. Tasted great otherwise.

I made these as directed and thought they were delicious! I was worried about them being soggy but brushing the tortillas with butter made them crisp in the oven. I had 2 lbs of ground meat that I needed to use, so I doubled the recipe and saved the remaining meat mixture to use another time. I will make this again.
Update: I melted velveeta cheese in the remaining meat mixture and dished it over tortilla chips for nachos-Delicious!

The only changes I made was I cut up some green onion to go on top with the tomatoes and sour cream plus I used refried black beans instead. This dish was easy and delicious!!  My husband and I couldn't stop eating the filling it was so good!  Baking it with the butter on top gives it a semi-crispy outside, which is a nice touch!!  Will definitely make this again!

Was great as is. Did add the beans to the meat mixture prior to spreading and it worked well. Also used green chilies instead of bell pepper. Next time might add olives and sprinkle cilantro on top after cooking. Loved this dish.

I found this recipe and as soon as I saw it I couldn't wait to prepare it for something different for dinner. My husband constantly tells me that he's bored with the same old thing to eat. He was full of compliments and already wants these again! Next time I will change it up with some chicken just to add to my rotation of dinners for two. The possibilities are endless with this versatile and delicious recipe!

I really modified this recipe to fit the ingredients I had.
I mixed my retried beans with velveta, consume, salt and pepper.  
Added it to my browned ground beef, onions and garlic.  (I seasoned my beef with seasoning salt). 
Once mixed, I took another reviewers suggestion and added a little enchilada sauce.  Turned out okay.  Husband rated a 3 star.  Could be all my changes I made.  I think I just used this concept.  Will try again sometime and follow recipe.

Very good, will make again. 5 stars for the idea to bake instead of deep fry. Served with "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce" and "Refried Beans Without the Refry", both recipes from this site.  I changed up the filling quite a bit as I didn't want these to taste like taco/burrito/enchilada - seasoned beef with S&P, 6-8 cloves garlic, onion, and a little shake of chili powder and cumin. Only used meat and beans for filling. I will do it this way next time also.  Served corn and extra beans on the side, along with usual toppings and cilantro cream sauce. Excellent. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't have all the ingredients do this is what I did...
Cooked the ground beef and onions together till the beef was brown. Drained fat, added water and taco seasoning. Added 1 can of corn and 1 can of black beans. Put cheese and beef mixture in tortillas baked for 15 min turned over and baked for 10 more mins. 
Love it! Well at least two of three love it, my youngest is super picky and "only likes
soft tortillas, not crunchy ones". She's missing out. 
I know it's not a true review on the actual recipe but we really loved it and I'm sure it could only get better if I followed it correctly. Enjoy!

One of the best recipes that I have tried on Allrecipes!  This is a no fail recipe.  Sometimes, instead of taco sauce, I use a can of Rotel and an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce.  One tip is to make sure you spray the pan with Pam or grease with butter prior to placing the chimichangas as they tend to stick to the pan. Garnish with some cilantro and Happy Cinqo de Mayo!

I make this on a regular basis. Both of m picky kids like it! Love the technique of putting the butter on instead of frying the whole thing. So much healthier!

These were good...nice & crispy. I will definitely make again, but would like to try with shredded chicken next time. I'll maybe use enchilada sauce too, just to compare and contrast with taco sauce. Would have actually given them more like a 4.5 stars just because I felt like it was missing something, but can't quite put my finger on it. So, hopefully using chicken next time will make the difference.

Yum! I changed based on what I had; used chipotle taco seasoning instead of taco sauce/spices and used red pepper instead of green.  I really liked the chipotle flavor, but would like to try the original recipe also. Nice change from the usual tacos or burritos.

AMAZING!!! We loved this recipe, I did make a change to it, instead of using the taco sauce I used salsa, to cut back on the sodium. I have had other chimmies before but never with refried beans in them, And it was a very good change...Thanks for a great recipe that is very easy to prepare and very easy to eat :)

I made a few changes to accomodate what I had on hand. I used 1 can of diced tomato and a packet of taco seasoning instead of taco sauce, a can of ranch style beans instead of refried and I mixed everything together (minus the tortillas, butter, lettuce and tomato) and served with chips. I originally tasted it and it tasted like chili. So I added another can of diced tomatoes and it was great. We all loved it. I will definitely make it again but reduce the chili powder.

These came out fantastic! I had to use cream corn in place of regular corn and just drained the excess fluid and it still came out great! I also made a variation for vegan guests by using TVP reconstituted with one packet of ChiChis salsa seasoning then added the other ingredients from the recipe and it was fantastic as well! Everyone raved over this recipe, and these chimis also reheat very well by wrapping in foil and sticking in oven (even the toaster oven!) at 350 for 30 min. Piping hot and crusty on the outside! Yum!

I would've given this recipe 5 stars but I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I browned the grd. beef, added a pkt of taco seasoning, 3/4 c water, then a can of corn (drained) and a can of refried beans.  After it was heated well I put spoonfuls down the middle of the tortillas, then put a lot of shredded cheese on top of that, rolled them up, seam side down in pan, brushed with melted butter and baked @ 350 for 10-15 min.  Once on our plates we topped with sour cream, lettuce and tomoatoes and DUG in!!  Delicious!!

Really good. Only thing I did different was I added a can of diced chilies and I mixed my beans in with the meat to make it a bit easier. Was great. Had more then enough meat to make 8. Freezed the other half for later on.

This is a tasty and pretty versatile recipe and, for me, serves more than 8 -- more like 12.  Instead of taco sauce, I used Speedy Homemade Salsa (from this site).  And I sprayed the prepared chimis with Pam rather than using butter; just a little more healthy.  They crisped nicely.  One of the best things about this recipe, besides the fact that it's simple and quick, is that they can be frozen, thawed and reheated in the microwave.  Wonderful!

I made this recipe using ground bison meat and multigrain tortillas.   If you didn't want to go the meat route, these can easily be made veggie by just chopping up more vegetables and adding spinach.  I shredded fresh colby jack and cheddar cheese.  It was super yummy!  Everyone raved about these.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I used flank steak and black beans instead of refried. Put everything in a crockpot except corn and beans until meat shredded. Added beans and corn for a hour and then baked. Fantastic!

Great recipe with lots of room for adding your own spin on things.  You can stick w/the beef or you can just go vegetarian and use black beans along with the refried beans. I followed as written for my first time trying the recipe out but I can see plenty of room for changes.  I think other reviewers had good ideas about freezing some and using them for other meals, or even making smaller versions and serving them up at parties as an appetizer.  Thanks for sharing :)

Delicious!  I've made this recipe with beef and chicken and have nothing but rave reviews each time.  The first time I didn't alter the recipe at all.  The second time, I reduced the taco sauce down to 1/2 cup,reduced corn to 3/4 cup and added diced tomatos with chiles.  Perfect either way!

I didn't use the taco sauce but instead, added taco seasoning to the beef/onions.  Used organic canola spray instead of melted butter to save some serious calories!!

I'm giving this recipe only 3 stars because I was expecting so much more from this dish. The filling was good but was beginning to come out half way through cooking. My boyfriend and I make mexican dishes alot and this dish just fell flat for us. If I make this dish again I will be adding some chopped jalapeno's and fresh cilantro, maybe even some mexican rice.

These weren't anything SUPERB, but they were tasty. It took a lil more than one can of refried beans; and I think I would suggest heating the beans in a pan w/ a lil water before spreading them. It would just make the spreading easier.

I gave this 3 stars because it was incredibly salty.  I drank no less than 8 glasses of water after eating this.  It was the beans.  Over 1100 mg sodium per serving.  YIKES!  I will look for low sodium beans next time.

This was pretty good. Instead of taco sauce I used tomato sauce with taco seasoning, using only what was necessary to coat the meat mixture and seasoned to taste (the taco seasoning was homemade from this site). Since I used my own seasoning blend, I omitted the spices. I used a marbled cheddar instead of Monterey Jack. Sprayed my rolls with non-stick olive oil spray. Didn't use the tomato or lettuce. The recipe is pretty cheap to make, but be prepared to pay about $2.25 for a can of re-fried beans. I will look into making homemade next time (you won't need the whole can- freeze and save for a Mexican-style pizza!). I would make it again.

I didn't use the corn or bell peppers but I did use a can of tomatoes with chilies. Pretty much the rest stayed the same as directed but you certainly can mix things up a bit and their sure to turn out great.   They freeze wonderfully also.

I have made this now a few times.  Took the suggestions of omitting the green peppers and adding a can of chilies instead, as well as mixing the beans in directly and using enchilada sauce and a taco seasoning packet.  The kids love this dish.

YUM! I live in Australia where Mexican food is hard to come by so I have had to venture into cooking it at home. My family loved these! I made one small change to the recipe. Instead of re-fried beans, I used mexi beans which is just an assortment of whole beans. I would recommend these highly for anyone craving Mexican food.

I used a packet of taco seasoning instead of seasoning these with the other ingredients. But my husband and his friends LOVED them. I also only baked them for 15 minutes then turned the broiler on to brown the tops.

Great recipe! Like other users, I had to make a couple of slight adjustments.  I was annoyed to find that I had bought creamed corn rather than regular, but I threw it in anyway.  It was really nice... to my shock!  My 8 year old has just entered a picky stage and he inhaled it.  Thank you!

My husband loved this dish!  I modified it a little.  I subbed canned grn chilies for the grn pepper and salsa for the taco sauce.  I also added 3 cloves of fresh garlic and some fresh cilantro (maybe 3 T.).  I actually cooked this down for about 20 minutes.  Once I rolled them all up, I baked them in a grated pan so they wouldn't get soggy on the bottom.  I served with melted cheese and red sauce on top.  Really good!

Delicious! Made it just as the recipe called for but I needed to open another can of beans - I'm never sure how to divide the ingredients once I start "building" the wraps. Great with salsa and sour cream on top. I fed 4 adults and still have enough left over for another meal for 2.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic.  The whole family loved it.  Instead of the large flour tortillas, I used the smaller version tortilla. Also a few minutes before they were almost ready, I put a little taco sauce and sprinkled cheese on top to moisten it up and served it with Guacamole(recipe i found on this site) on the side.

I've been making these for years, but I use home- made beans, that I make from the leftover ham bones after we finish the ham.  When cooking the beans, I put in onions, grated carrots, celery and potatoes.  After a meal or 2 of beans and corn- bread, we make the leftovers into burritos.  I add a can of chopped green chilies in place of the bell pepper, and add a can of slice black olives and the corn along with the ground meat and taco seasoning.  We freeze them and when we feel  like a bit of Mexican flavor, we take a coupe out of the freezer and pop them into the oven.   Great for a quick meal anytime.

This was a quick meal but I made some changes to suit my family. I used 2 1/2 lbs of ground beef for the meat lovers  in my family. Instead of using chopped bell pepper I used a can of Mexicorn(corn with green and red peppers). After baking I topped with a cheese sauce. The refried beans I used were fat free!! You gotta cut fat and calories somewhere!!

Very good.  We served the "salad" on the side with a little sour crean on top of the chimichangas.  Will make again since, I have so some filling left over (only made half since it's just two of us.)  This would be a good meal to feed a crowd!

My husband told me this is one of the best things I have ever made.  I thought it was pretty good, but didn't like it as much as him.  I would make it again for sure!  Quick and easy meal!

I was surprised at how easy this was to make and how good!  I tweaked it a little bit - one cup of salsa rather than the sauce and added taco seasoning rather than the seasonings.  I also added the beans to the meat mixture in the pan and left out the corn.  I will definitely make this again.

We like spicy stuff but this was a little much and I even reduced the spices. We don't like refried beans so I left them out. I used 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/4 tsp cumin. I followed the directions for everything else other then the cooking time. Mine were done it 20 mintes. I froze the leftovers for another time following another persons advise to wrap them in seran wrap and stick in a freezer bag.

I did use some suggestions from other members.  I left out the taco sauce and chili powder using taco seasoning instead.  I also left out the green pepper and used a 6oz can of chopped green chilis in it's place.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack cheese.  After 15 min. in the oven I spread some more butter on top of each one; not sure if this helped but I'm know it didn't hurt.  They turned out excellent!!! Great Recipe!!

I'm not a fan of onions, so I thinly sliced them and cooked them first in the pan, and then added them to the top of half of the chimichangas before I put them in the oven.  They turned out perfectly!  My boyfriend kept going back for more.  A keeper for sure!  Thanks!

These were super yummy! The only thing I did different is I fried them in a pan with a little butter. They were crunchy and yummy. I tried them in the oven the first time I made them and they were just ok. Fried in a pan with a little butter really made a difference!!

Was excellent!  I took the suggestion of using a packet of taco seasoning instead of spices.  I also did this in 12 servings versus 8 for a recipe exchange and only used 1 packet.  That was the only change I made and I loved it.  So glad there is leftovers so I can eat some for lunch tomorrow!!

Fantastic.  My husband and I loved these.  I prepared them pretty much as written, though I was a little short on taco sauce.  I thought it was great that they came out of the oven with a slight crunch.

Loved this recipe!  I doubled it for a family dinner.  The only thing I changed was adding a small can of green chilies.  I served with lettuce, pico, sour cream and white cheese sauce.  Everyone loved them.  My kids asked me if I was sure I didn't buy them from a restaurant.  Will definitely make again.

I love the fact that these are baked but the taste was so off from what I expected that I had to go looking for another chimi recipe.  The corn sounds more like a southwestern thing so I didn't add those.  The main problem with these is that all I tasted was taco sauce.  It completely overpowered everything.  I agree with the reviews that say this is more in tune taste wise with something off of the taco bell menu.  If you love taco sauce, by all means try this one, but if you want more depth of flavor and authenticity, I recommend the chimis with green sauce from this site.  Thank you for the upload regardless though!

Unfortunately I didn't realize that my family used all our taco sauce when I started making this. So I followed some recommendations and used 1 package taco seasoning and 1 6oz can tomato sauce. My husband doesn't like green peppers so I used a can of green chilies as well. I also used ground turkey to cut out some of the fat. I didn't add any of the seasoning as I used the taco seasoning. And for ease I added the refried beans to the meat mixture. I also sprayed them and the pan with Pam rather then using butter. My family LOVED these! Will definitely make these again and again!   Also had extra meat mixture left that I rolled out and put in the freezer. I can't wait to see how well it turns out after freezing.

Delicious! Didn't use corn, and I drizzled some white store bought cheese dip on top, and the pico de gallo recipe from this site as a topper, which was outrageous! Now on our weekly rotation, sometimes with chicken and shrimp as a filler.

I thought these tasted fantastic. Instead of 2 cups of taco sauce, I used 1 cup taco sauce, and 1 cup picante sauce.  Otherwise, I did everything else as written, and they turned out nice and crispy with a great flavor.  I'll definitely be making them again!

Awesome! However I did modify it just a bit.  I am a vegetarian, so I used Boca Burger instead of ground meat.  I also added a tablespoon of chili powder because we like food to be spicy and I had some Pampered Chef chipotle seasoning which added a sweet smokey flavor.  I cooked a box of Far East Spanish rice and mixed it in.   I was wonderful.  My husband and I loved it! Thanks for such a great recipe!

Great recipe! I omitted the garlic salt, and instead put fresh garlic in with the onion and pepper. Also, I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. After adding the sauce and seasonings, I brought the mixture to a boil for a few minutes to give the vegetables a chance to soften even more and let the sauce thicken. Very flavorful recipe, very great texture! Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe last night for a "Ladies Night" meal and it was extremely delicious.  I didn't have corn on hand, which is unfortunate but it still turned out wonderfully.

Not crazy about the flavor, it tasted a liitle off. Too much corn for my taste.

A solid simple recipe.  Fresh chopped tomatoes and chopped romaine lettuce were extremely refreshing as sides.   For some reason the brushed butter didn't brown the top of the tortillas, but seemed to drip to the bottom and brown the bottom (the tortilla side touching my foil-lined baking pan).

These are simple and delicious. I don't add the corn and use a can of black beans instead of refried, but they roll up easy and bake crispy. We smother ours with enchilada sauce, cheese and a bit of lettuce. Makes them really restaurant quality. Also, I add 1/2 cup or so of the enchilada sauce to the meat mixture to make it moist and flavorful. I don't know how 2 cups of sauce would do. Tasty!

This recipe was excellent. I used pulled pork, added a little spanish rice and left out the corn. I served it with diced tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream. YUM! I loved the fact these were baked.

This is one of the first recipes I attempted cooking from allrecipes and I'm still using it. Don't leave out the re-fried beans and for those of us in the UK there is a recipe for Taco Sauce on allrecipes which tastes good (I just combine both recipes) and you can use a different cheese. This is depending on how well stocked your local shops are!

We really enjoyed this meal! I had to improvise since I didn't have all the ingredients needed for this recipe. Here are my substitutions:  - Trader Joe's "Corn and Chile Tomato-less Salsa" instead of regular corn. - No beans in the house, and I didn't have a suitable substitute. Darn! - I omitted the green bell peppers (red bell peppers were in the corn salsa). - I omitted the chili powder since the corn salsa was very spicy. - Cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack. - Regular tomato salsa instead of taco sauce. - Garlic powder instead of garlic salt (and added kosher salt to the meat while cooking it). - Once on the plate, we ate it with sour cream instead of lettuce/tomato. Although that would have been good too!

Really good!  I made some of the alterations that other reviewers suggested.  First, I substituted ground turkey for the beef since I don't eat beef.  I substituted a can of green chilies for the green pepper.  I used a package of taco seasoning instead of the spices.  I did add some garlic.  I cooked the beans with the meat.  I also used 1/2 cup enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  I topped with a little bit of enchilada sauce, cheese, lettuce and tomato.  I froze the extra filler for later.  I will be keeping this recipe for later use!

Yummmmm! Loved these!  Here's what I did:  I sauteed onion, garlic, and jalapeno and then added beef.  I cooked the beef until done and then added a can of green chilis, a can of corn, a can of refried beans, a cup of salsa, cumin, chili powder, seasoned salt, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. I then filled burrito sized tortillas and topped with cheese before folding.  I brushed melted butter with a little EVOO, garlic powder, and chili powder on each chimi.  I served with sour cream and homemade pico de gallo. Yummmmy!

Not what I expected. Maybe if I played around with the ingredients (omit the corn and increase the ground beef and beans), it will have the taste that I desired. This recipe has great potential but fell short in what I believe is a beef and bean chimichanga. Will make again with modifications so I can bump up the stars.

So, so, good! I've been making these for at least 4 years - the whole family loves them. If I don't have quite enough taco sauce, I make up the difference with salsa; gives the meat mix a nice kick. I make the full amount of meat mixture, cook and serve half (makes four chimichangas) and freeze half for another time. Defrost for a quick meal!

These were good.  I did as other reviewers suggested and put the (fat-free) beans directly into the meat and I thought it gave the filling a great texture and flavor that it wouldn't have had if the beans were spread on the shells.  Shells are a bit of a pain to work with as mine split, but that's my fault and not the recipes.  Definitely warm your shells, wrapped in a damp cloth, in the microwave for 1 min before you try and wrap these.  Also, let the filling cool a bit since trying to wrap these while it's hot is extremely difficult and hard on your fingertips.

These were pretty good & everyone enjoyed them at my Mexican themed deck party last night (and it was before the tequilla started flowing, so I know it was a genuine like for the food, lol).  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I buttered both the front & back of the chimichanga's; needed 4 tbs to do so).  Since I had never made chimichanga's before, I was super nervous these could easily turn into chimi-wronga's, but it was pretty cut & dry.  If I were to note anything, it would be that I would probably put a little bit more seasoning in the meat as well as a clove of garlic or two.  All in all, great (and filling) recipe...thanks for sharing!

Made this recipe for Mother's day and it was for my wife's side of the family.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  I followed what others said and added the beans to the rest of the mix and warmed them up before rolling in tortillas.

These were just ok for us-they seem to be lacking flavor of some sort. I thought the beans were a little overpowering. I may make again & play w/the recipe a little.

I love the simplicity of this recipe.  I made a few changes due to the fact that my pantry was limited.  E.g. I used whole beans instead of refried, ommitted onions and corn and used salsa instead of sauce.  Next time I will stock up and try the recipe as stated.

Yummy yummy!  This was very tasty.  I took the advice of the reviews and just mixed everything together.  I did a lazy version of this with canned chilis and dry onions, but it was still tasty!!

We thought these were great--and so easy to make.  I made it exactly like the recipe, except I mixed the beans directly in with the meat.  Also, I didn't have any taco sauce so I used picante sauce instead.  Very tasty!

It was good. My family all commented on how yummy it was. I, on the other hand thought that it was a bit too heavy. A little like Taco Bell.

I tried this tonight and my husband and I thought they were good but not great.  I didn't really like it with the corn and taco sauce and I think whole beans would have been better.  Although baking them is healthier, it took away from the chimi experience because they didn't really get that crispy or hard at all.  I'm not sure if I'll try this again but it was easy.

Tasted fine, but would have been easier and tasted the same just to buy frozen burritos.

Great & lower fat alternative to fried chimichangas at the restaurant.  My family enjoyed these - we will make again, trying alternatives each time to mix it up.  I did mix the beans into the beef mixture as suggested by others, and omitted the corn (family preference).  Thank you for the recipe - it's a winner!

Like many of you on here I LOVE this..started making it about a year ago but just started updating it a bit! I fry mine a bit to get that crunchy chimi texture right when taking them out of the oven. I also replace the green peppers with green chilis. Also,a local restaurant serves these with this queso dip..so I tried a bit of Pace's 4 cheese on top...AMAZING!!Not the healthiest,but its so worth it!

I love this recipe. I, too, made just a few adjustments. I used about 3/4 or so cup corn, and I used only about 1/2 the cheese. It came out nicely crispy. I plan to use the rest for a few lunches at work.

I'm a Mexican food freak, but this just wasn't good...in my humble opinion.  My tortillas were touch and hard to cut, instead of crispy, like I had wanted.  Next time, think I'll just stick with enchiladas or soft tacos!

I added the refried beans right in with the meat.  The jar of taco sauce I bought was only 1 cup so I improvised with 1/4 C of salsa and 3/4 C of spaghetti sauce.  Very good.  My husband, 18-month-old, and I all ate it right up.

Very good, nice twist to regular ground beef tacos.  Used taco seasoning and refried black beans, all in the beef mixture to cut down on time.

Made this last night and was somewhat pleased. Followed the recipe except left out the corn and cumin. Just personal preference. It was good, just not that exciting as others had made it sound. Will make again, just not in my monthly rotation. Thanks for the post!

Maybe I was expecting too much but I thought this tasted like a microwave frozen burrito you can buy at the store.  I don't understand how it can have such a high rating.  It could be I'm just used to authentic Mexican food.  Won't make again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have three children, ages 5, 9, and 15, with varying tastes, but this recipe was a hit with all three.  Even my boyfriend who doesn't care for Mexican-style food loved this.  I added a bit of jalapeno seasoning, similar to taco seasoning, and cooked the beans right in with the meat. Quick, easy, & tastes so good!

These were fabulous.  I used red bell pepper instead of green which was so good.  I also cut down the corn because that was all I had.  The only trouble I had was wrapping the tortilla.  It kept breaking when I rolled it.  I must have been doing something wrong.  These are very big!  One is more than enough per person.  I only made three and after  putting them in the oven found myself eating spoonfuls of the meat mixture on it's own saying mmmm, mmmm, after each bite.  I loved this mixture.  I think next time though I will use soft tortilla's like a burrito or even as soft taco. The spices gave it perfect flavor.  For the reviewers who said this was bland.............you must have  missed something in the recipe.  This was packed with flavor.  I used a medium/hot taco sauce, maybe that made the difference.

I have made these several times and usually serve them with queso. I have frozen the ground beef mixture and the completed chimichanga and found that both work well. This recipe will be in my rotation for a long time.

I give this only 4 stars because I didn't follow it exactly, I left out the peppers and I used taco seasoning. I did like this recipe and found it very tasty and quick and easy to prepare. My kids loved it, with the exception of my oldest who is very picky and enjoyed every thing but the corn, which she picked out. Other than that we loved these chimis and will be having them again!

This were good.  I used red and yellow peppers as it was what I had from my garden.  I also used one cup of the salsa in the bottom of the pan and put the other cup into the meat mixture as instructed.  If you don't have the spices, you could substitute a taco seasoning mix.

I used this recipe as a jumping point and made my own roast beef with taco seasoning and green chiles to taste, and based on the advice of other reviewers. After that, I spread beans, meat and cheese on the tortilla per the directions (no corn or other veggies), wrapped them up and sprayed with cooking spray, and baked them. I flipped them half way through and they come out crispy and delicious! Of course, I topped them with sour cream, salsa, cheese, and lettuce. Yum! We're having them again for dinner tomorrow. I love foolproof recipes like this!

To even get my family to try this, I followed another's advice and used diced green chilies instead of the green pepper and because my husband also dislikes onion, I had to cut it back to just a couple of tablespoons. The flavor of the spices was just right, but not for those who only like their Mexican food mild. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this recipe 3 times already.  My kids and husband love it.  The last time I made this I had both cheddar cheese and monteray jack shredded on top of the chimichangas.  Also, I have use both hot and mild taco sauce when making this.  We prefer the mild.

This recipe was great! I cut the recipe in 1/2 since I am cooking for two then followed as is. It was great, and a nice change from our normal tacos. I will definitely be making this again.

This meal was easy to prepare and fairly inexpensive.  It had a great flavor, but I wouldn't necessarily call them chimichangas.  More of a baked burrito.  The shells just didn't have that same texture you get when frying.  I would, however, make them again.

Very good.  My wife loved it too.  I did add a queso and some guacamole to mine, but it did not need it.

Hubby and I both loved these...one of the best Mexican dishes I have made and much easier and cleaner to make than the fried chimis!  Didn't change a thing....

This recipe is AWESOME. Definitely one of my husbands favorites. It's become a staple in our house, so easy to make! I love that the recipe always makes extras so it's easy to make later with the mixture...yummy!

These have lots of flavor!  My husband and I really enjoyed them.  I only made a half recipe.  I used half medium and half mild taco sauce and added about a tablespoon of taco seasoning.  The only thing I wasn't real impressed with was the outside(tortilla), probably just because it's baked and not fried, which I'm sure is a bit healthier.  Chimi's are one of my favorite things to order from a mexican restaurant, so it's hard not to compare.  With that said, I'm sure I'll be making these again sometime.

Fantastic! TRy these! I was originally going to make enchiladas, but I decided to go with these instead. Im glad I did. They were very tasty.
 Here are the changes I made: I did not have beans (canned, or pre-soaked), so I opted out on them...but even without they were moist enough and very good. I also didnt have bell peppers on hand, I just used a green hungarian pepper, and that added enough zing that made up for the missing bells. I got creative and poured the remaining mixture of meat and cheese on top of the wrapped up chimis before they went into the oven, and IM glad I did because it added some extra texture. 

I made my own taco sauce from scatch instead of a pre-made one, therefore I had more control over the sodium in the dish. 

I also made my own tortillas from scratch which I would reccommend because it gives a much more authentic taste.

Added a dab of sourcream to final product and it was a grand.

I thought these were really tastey.  I made a couple of minor changes.  I chopped and seeded a whole jalopeno that I added to the onion.  I used black beans instead of refried (personal preference)  The rest I kept the same.  It was easy and tastey.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe for a quick dinner. I used black beans instead of corn and refried beans. Just mixed all together and spooned into tortillas and topped with cheese.

This was good!  The easiest way to cook this is to use a packet of taco seasoning and mix the beans in the meat.  I took the suggestion of using the green chilies instead of the green pepper. There is plenty of meat mixture leftover.

Love It. I actually cooked this at my in laws while the boys were working on snowmobiles and all 12 full sized burritos were gone. Everyone loved it including my 3 yr old and 18 month old. I followed other reviews, and mixed the beans right in the ground beef mixture. And I skipped the taco sauce and just used taco seasoning to season meat. I also add a little bit a salsa in the meat and beans. Just made this last night and I stirred the cheese right in the meat/bean mixture made it one step easier.

We loved these!  Took suggestions from other reviewers and used Taco Seasoning Mix and chopped chilies instead of the taco sauce and green pepper.  I also added a jar of salsa and a can of olives to the mix.  I made 9 large ones for me and my husband.  He told me not to bother freezing any, they won't last past the weekend.

This turned out wonderful.  I went by the recipe but only used less taco sauce.  I only bought one small bottle, but it still tasted wonderful.  We used left over beans and smashed them.  This is a good way to use left overs.

Love them! It's a nice variation to the ol' tacos and burritos. I love that it is not fried too. The only change I made was omitting the corn to make it to my husbands liking and I also cheated a little and used a packet of taco seasoning. These were so easy for my kids to eat (who are 2 and 3 years old) because they didn't fall apart like tacos do when they are handling them!

It was pretty good, I found it to be a bit bland as written so I added a bit more zip by adding jalapenos and more hot sauce, but of course thats person specific.

Okay, I first have to say I'm a vegetarian, so I do not make these with beef, I just add extra beans, but these have been a huge hit with my family.  For the kids, I simply make theirs with the beans and cheese (I use cheddar) and for the husband and I we eat with the beans, cheese and corn mix.  I did go the easy way though and instead of adding all those spices just use tomato sauce and taco seasoning.  Anyway, this has become a weekly requested item for dinner!

We had these for dinner yesterday and everyone enjoyed them.  I substituted green chilies for the green pepper and it gave them a nice zip.  They are very filling and we found that one Chimichanga per person was enough.  Kids thought maybe some rice in stuffing would be good too.  Maybe we'll try that next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband probably would have given this recipe five stars.  I am the culprit who brings it down a notch.  I tweaked the filling a bit but followed the idea of baking the tortillas.  I think that I will lightly fry the tortillas next time before I place them in the oven.  The tortillas came out a bit too crispy and dry for my liking.

This is WONDERFUL! The only different thing I did was omit the refried beans since I didnt have any. And the taco sauce, I used one small jar which equaled one cup. It was still delish! Served it with white cheese sauce and we couldnt tell the difference from the restaurants around here.

Delish! Made some tweaks: left out the bell pepper. Used Red Taco Sauce (mild). Put into a 9x13 dish sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Kind of a tight fit, but it worked well. I'd make 1/2 a recipe next time as it's w-a-y too much for 2 people!  :)  Great recipe and will make again.

Fantastic! I was so pleased that these are baked not fried. Being from NM I had to substitute chopped green chiles for the bell pepper and green chile sauce for taco sauce. Before serving I smothered the individual portions with green sauce and cheese. Thanks.

Wow!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting vegetarian "ground beef".  My husband loved them and insisted that we make them again the next weekend for guests, who also raved.

These were very good, everyone loved them.  I used a packet of taco seasoning and a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, and they turned out great.  I love that they are baked, not fried!  Also, I left out the beans.

Made this recipe just as stated and it was quite good, but it made a lot for our family (two adults, 2 kids). I did freeze the leftovers as others suggested, but haven't tried them yet. I would definetly try to split the recipe next time or be prepared to do something with all that's left.

This is a phenomenal recipe!  When I made them tonight, I subbed chicken and black beans for the beef and saved a lot of fat calories.  I also used green chili enchilada sauce along with the taco sauce.  I served them with Best Guacamole from this site and light sour cream.  Absolutely delicious!

Awesome!  After following recipe a few times, started to change it up a bit...ground turkey, instead of beef, zucchini, mushrooms, black beans mixed right in with the meat...Delicious!  Thank you!

When I made this I omitted the corn, but I otherwise followed the recipe's ingredients as written. This was amazing and tasted just like those wonderful fried versions I used to have in elementary school! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us.

These are scrumptious! I made a little extra sauce to put over the top. 8 inch flour tortillas work perfectly. To save on calories, I used fat free beans and the fat free spray butter works great to brown them. Thank you for the recipe!

Love this recipe. Easy, flavorful and had ingredients on hand so dinner was made in no time at all. Left overs were even better tasting the next day. Served with mexican rice (found on this website). Perfect.

I rated this recipe 4 stars.  My husband gave it a 5.  I made it exactly the same way as the recipe stated, but only used 1 cup of taco sauce because a bottle only has 1 (didnt know it until I went to cook).  I just added about a 1/2 cup of water to the taco sauce bottle, shook it and then added it the recipe.  I felt it was missing spice to it.  It was still delicious and were eating the leftovers tonite.

Made these last night and everyone loved them!  I didnt follow the recipe exactly, but it didnt matter a bit.  I left out the corn, added salsa to the meat too, didnt measure any of the spices... in a nut shell, this is a great recipe that can be easily adapted to fit your own tastes.  OH, dont forget the sour cream!

This is a quick and easy recipe.  I didn't have taco sauce so I used a smaller sized can of crushed tomatoes in puree and added about half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I toasted them in a frying pan with some veg. oil and they got nice and crisp.  The flavor was yummy, I will probably make these again, might try it in the oven next time.

Follwed other's advice and used taco seasoning in the meat.  I did not have green pepper so used a can of green chilis.  Buttered both sides and turned them over half way through cooking time.  The flavor was good and the tortilla crispy.  Too large for one person.  Next time I will use smaller tortillas rather than burrito size.

I changed up the recipe a bit since I am allergic to beans. I fried up the hamburger meat, added garlic powder , onion powder and chili powder to taste. then i just put the meat, then some taco bell hot sauce packets (kids request) and monterey jack cheese. rolled it up, basted with butter and baked it. i garnished it with some lettuce and a spoon of sour cream. my kids loved it and i didnt expect them to!

I added Taco Mix instead of the regular seasonings. It was pretty good. It didn't taste like a fried chimi, but it did cut out a lot of fat.

These are yummy and easy to make. They reheat for leftovers nicely in the microwave. Lettuce, tomato, cheese and sour cream are great on top. 
btw: Chimichangas are burritos that are deep fried. If they are too burrito-ish, just add more butter/oil, or if you don't like the baked version, than go the deep fried way.

These were ok; my husband liked them much more than I. Chimis are my fave as far as mexican goes, and this recipe tasted like a baked burrito instead. They were crispy, but I didn't care for the taste. The filling was pretty good though.

This recipe is a keeper.  I used what I had in the cabinet so I substituted diced tomatoes with chilies for taco sauce, added some garlic tabasco for extra heat and blended the beans right into the beef mixture to cut back on time.  Next time I will try to wrap in spring roll wrappers to change it up a bit.

I didn't really like these, but my husband did. They were crisp right out of the oven. If they sit, they become plain ole burritos. The tortillas soften up. So serve & eat them immediately out of the oven.

I also used taco season packet and only 1 cup of taco sauce because that was all I had.  We were very hungry and took them out of the oven at about 15 minutes.  Next time I will leave them in for the full 25 minutes because the well cooked crispy parts were so good!

This was ok but it was pretty easy to cook. Doubled the onions & green peppers & hamburger (2 servings). Used creamed corn because had it in the fridge to use for leftovers. Premade the day before serving. Added Mexican cheese blend to the top at end of cooking time & served with yellow rice. Also I didn't add the lettuce & tomato at the end.

This was a great recipe.  I didn't have much in the pantry and was easily able to pull this recipe off.  Instead of taco sauce I used salsa.  I didn't put in the fresh veggies seeing as there's some in the salsa and I'm not a huge onion or green pepper fan.  I also had no seasonings so I threw in half a package of taco seasoning.  I used extra butter as some reviewers mentioned and the chimichangas were nice and crispy.  This will become a regular on our dinner table!

These were awesome.  I used 2 round steaks that I cooked until the were shredable and I also used a can of green chiles instead of a bell pepper because I didnt have one.  My husband loved them. Thanks.  I will make this again.

This recipe is a keeper! I left out the corn and green bell pepper. I used 1 cup of salsa instead of 2 cups of taco sauce. I didn't put butter on the tortillas, but covered the top of the chimis with extra Colby Jack Cheese. I baked the chimis for 10 minutes and then covered the pan with foil so the cheese on top didn't get too crunchy. I served these with queso and sour cream. I think they will make great leftovers, which is something I look for in a recipe since my husband and I both bring our lunch to work.

Awesome chimichangas!  Seem more like burritos, but whatever you want to call them, call them excellent.  I made so many of these that I ended up freezing most of them...and I've found that they make wonderful lunches when on the fly.  Also made them healthier by using turkey in place of the beef.  Thank you!

Hubby liked it, even though I was missing quite a few of the ingredients. Most obvious was taco sauce, but it still tasted good. I'm going to try again, AFTER I've been to the grocery store with a list. EDIT: I tried it again, and it's still a hit. Fabulous recipe.

Really really really good. This is the second time I've made them, and my roommate came home and said, "You made these individually? You're crazy, you could just use frozen ones!" But when  he tried it, he said it hit the spot:) I also added a small can of diced chiles. The outside was nice and crispy - I wish it stayed like that after reheating. I served it with sour cream, lettuce, guacamole and the Mexican Rice III from this website. It was a great Mexican dinner!

These were more like burritos instead of chimichangas, but still very good. Very easy to make and relatively quick. I also poured salsa over them to serve and it was even better with the salsa. I also omitted the butter and just sprayed them with olive oil. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was a five star if you add a packet of taco seasoning and a little hot sauce.  I loved the crispness of the shell.  Add sourcream and salsa prior to eating and it is a tasty meal!

This seemed to lack the punch and flavor I had expected. Not a meal that we would have again.

I thought these were great,my hubby loved them. the only thing i would do differntly next time is after brushing them w/the melted butter i would cover the ends with aluminum foil,as they brown much quicker then the rest:) I served mine w/spanish rice,and sour cream and salsa.

Quite good, although let's just pretend it's called a beef and bean baked burrito.  If that's what you're expecting, you won't be disappointed it's not a chimichanga.  I fudged the veggie amounts (used 1 onion, 1 red pepper, and 1 can of corn rather than trying to use the exact amounts required in the recipe).  Topped these with sour cream and Avocado Salad (from this site).  Delicious!  Thanks!

Way to much corn and really no other flavoring.  Tastes better fried instead of baked.

A semi-easy recipe with a wonderful taste, I wouldn't change a thing.  After two bites my husband exclaimed that this one was a 5 star recipe and that is what it got.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I agree with a previous reviewer regarding the blandness of the filling. I ended up adding a good slosh of homemade hot sauce, some ground coriander, and way more cumin. Husband liked it but said it could have been improved with some black beans or rice. Anyway, thanks, Nicole!

Fairly quick & very good. I prepared as directed except I omitted the corn & reduced the green pepper to 1/2 cup. Next time I will omit the green pepper & use a small can of diced green chiles for more flavor. I also used Mexican blend cheese. They were plenty crispy baked in the oven. I will definately be making these again, maybe with shredded beef or chicken. Thanks!

I am giving this 4 stars but the recipe does need some tweaking. I did mix the refried beans with the meat mixture for ease of preparation. I don't think it would change the taste much doing it either way. The meat mixture tasted a little bland, which surprised me. The second go around I really upped the spices and came up with a meat mixture that was nice and flavorful. The "shell" of the chimichanga came out great. It was nice and crispy and I smothered it in queso cheese. Yum! Next time I am going to use chicken fajita meat and my mouth is watering just thinking of it. If you prefer chimichangas to burritos you might want to use fajita chicken or beef otherwise it still tastes burrito like even though the shell is crispy.

Pretty good.  I think I'll try it again, but change the meat filling a little.  I didn't really like the taco sauce mixed in, so I'd probably just season the hamburger with chili powder, cumin, garlic and have a more dry filling.  Otherwise, I loved the idea of baking them.....they were pretty crunchy with the butter basted on top.

Like previous reviewers, I used shredded beef instead of ground. It was easy enouogh to assemble, and I liked the crunchiness of the tortilla. We will make this again, of course tweaking it to fit our tastes.

This was a nice change from a regular burrito.  I used taco seasoning in place of the sauce and spices.  After assembling them I browned all sides of the tortilla over medium high heat on a griddle sprayed with non-stick spray.  This gave them a good crispy shell. I smothered them with homemade green chile and topped with sour cream. Yum!!

We had these last night and my family raved! I have two young children (3&5 yrs old), and they ate every bit. I used spinach, basil, and garlic tortillas because that is what I had. It would probably be good with ground turkey or only veggies. Instead of lettuce and tomato I used swiss chard and salsa.

My daughter's favorite recipe!  She's going to put it in her own recipe box!  We didn't have any "red" salsa; so, we put the green salsa in it.  Boy was it yummy!

This is more like a burrito than a chimi, but still good and easy to make.  Instead of the spices suggested, I just threw in a packet of taco seasoning mix and I stirred in the beans also.  Make sure you spray the bottom of your baking dish with a non-stick spray so the tortillas don't tear.

These are the best, I used salsa instead, and put cheese on top of the chimis as well, very tasty and filling.

Fabulous.  Baked, not fried and still yummy. I reduced garlic salt, will probably just use garlic powder next time. Also will spray baking sheet with cooking spray for easier clean up.

Very good! This is a great way to make healthier chimis. I made a huge batch and froze half so they're easy to pop in the oven. I also topped with cilantro and chihuahua cheese. You won't be disappointed.

I thought this recipe was great! My fiance thought it had a lot of garlic salt (a whole teaspoon is a lot) and it was very spicy, so if you don't want really spicy, reduce chili powder to 1/2 teaspoon. Next time I will reduce the garlic salt to 1/2 teaspoon. We both thought it was wonderful, though! the tortillas crisp up very well in the oven with the melted butter on top. Try it!

These were great.  I was looking for chimis that were baked, not fried...boy did I hit the jackpot.  I left out the bell pepper and corn, and use my own "meat seasoning" combination.  My husband is Mexican-American and hates anything Taco-Bell-ish, and I happen to like things like that.  Thanks to this recipe, I can now have it!!

Yummy! Although I hate it when people rate recipes when they've made so many changes, I have to admit I did use Taco sauce for the mixture and then pour enchilada sauce over the top before sprinkling the leftover cheese over it too. It was delicious. My kids and hubby raved over it, as well as my friends who helped me polish off the last three the next day!

this was just okay to me. Te filling did not have a very distinct mexican flavor. I think I might try again and use a taco seasoning packet. The idea to use the butter and bake them is great, it saves time and mess.

These were really good!  I took the advice of others and put in taco seasoning. I also substituted a can of black beans for the pepper,onion and refried beans.  They turned out nice and crispy without frying.  They also freeze well for a quick snack for the kids!

My husband and I thought this recipe was AWESOME my 12 year old son also liked it alot (the 3 and 5 year olds wouldn't touch it w/a 10 foot pole but they hate everything!!) deleted the green pepper, didn't have taco sauce so used about 1 1/2 cups of chipotle salsa and it was wonderful!! Was great warmed up the next day also. Will definately be making again. :O)

Unfortunately not a hit in our family. My husband and I thought it was so-so, but my kids didn't like it at all. Might be alot better with a red or green sauce poured over the top.

This took a lot of time to make, not bad though. I probably would of enjoyed it more without the bean, or less of it. It just seemed like it took a lot of flavor away. Adding taco seasoning to the meat might of helped too.

Made these the second time with changes.  Upped the seasonings and sauteed onions, red and yellow peppers with the beef.  Omitted the green pepper and added scallions before rolling.

Soooo good and loved that they didn't have to be fried like traditional chimichangas. I loved all of the vegetables and different spices working together to make one great flavor. Awesome recipe, thanks for sharing!

I mixed the beans in with the meat as some others suggested and I think it would have been better had I not.  The flavor was good, and I liked that they are baked not fried.  However,  the filling was too mushy with all the beans added in.  Next time, I'll add only part of a can of beans and not mix them with the meat.  All in all, a good recipe to keep on hand.  I just had to learn on the first go round how best to assemble them.

Very good recipe.  My husband loved it and said they were "outstanding."  I substituted a couple of ingredients  however.  Instead of 2 cups of taco sauce I used 1 cup taco sauce plus 1 cup of enchilada sauce.  Instead of the corn I added one can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilis (drained) and a small can of sliced black olives.  In the end, I thought they were fairly spicy and very good.

I liked the way the were baked.  They came out nice and crunchy.  But these didn't have enough kick for my family.  Instead of taco sauce I'd use salsa or enchilada sauce.  I won't make them again.

It was good and I would make it again.  The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because I don't crave to make it.  I made some changes to the recipe.  I didn't have taco sauce, so I used enchilada sauce.  I also added some black beans and cut back a little on the beef.

Everyone loved these. All I had was 10 in flour tortillas so they didn't wrap up as neat as they should have.  Will make agian but with the 12 inch wrapers. I left out the spices for filling and used a envelope of taco seasoning instead. I skipped the butter and sprayed with Pam. Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

Very good chimichangas.  I added more spice to my beef mixture as it was a little bland.  I have a homemade taco seasoning mix that I use, so that's what I used here.  Instead of taco sauce I substituted enchilada sauce and only used about a cup, didn't want it wet and runny, just moist.  I topped them with a mix of enchilada sauce and sour cream mixed together, as an earlier reviewer suggested.  I also topped with queso sauce that was used as an appetizer.  Will make again and again!

Not the best I have had, to me they were quite bland and they just weren't jumping off the plate as other reviewers had noted.  But they weren't bad either-just kinda there.

Everyone liked these.  Followed the recipe exactly but I guess I made them too big because I only could fit 6 on the cookie sheet.  I had a small bowl of the meat mixture left.  I will serve the leftover meat on some tortillas with cheese melted.
Thanks, will make these again.  Michele, Cambridge, Ontario

This recipe was AMAZING! My husband went nuts over it! I served it with plenty of cheese and sour cream and guacamole. I didn't use the cumin or chilipowder. Instead I sauteed my meat with taco seasoning.

My husband and I really liked this recipe but it is kind of messy--we ate it with a fork. I probably put more beans in the tortilla than I should have.  I used toothpicks to keep them apart while baking.

Using less onion,less green pepper, no beans or corn, low carb "Lavash" bread instead of "flour" tortillas, I converted this one to  about 12 carbs of a very good Mexican ground beef Chimichangas!  I did add sour cream and fresh chopped cilantro to the meat, just before I rolled up. And, I used some cheddar cheese,on top, the last few minutes  in the oven.  Excellent! Thank you, so much, for sharing an oven technique for chimichangas!The spices were perfect for us (not hot). Topped with sour cream and fresh cilantro. Very hearty;we did not even want a side dish to go with it. I have to believe the original recipe with beans and corn is five star too.

These were very yummy!  Took the advice of a previous reviewer and mixed enchilada sauce and sour cream warmed up to use as a sauce.  Unfortunately my kids didn't like it so I won't be making it again anytime soon.  Thanks, though!

Tried this last night with some adjustments.  Didn't use the beans or the taco sauce, instead made the Red Enchilda Sauce  and left out some of the called for spices then added 3/4 of that to the meat mixture and the reserved sauce was warmed up and served on top with sour cream.  The guys loved it and declared it's a have again.

This recipe was good but I found that it took longer than the recommended time to prepare.

These are a hit in our house.  We serve them wrapped up or on chips.  The only thing I have changed is subbing the green pepper for a red one (they are sweeter).  My children love them!  You can even make the meat mixture the day before for better flavor.  We never have any left over.  I have also made this as a dinner for friends and everyone wants the recipe.

This recipe is great.  I did not add the bell peppers and the corn but added more onions. Some members of my family are picky and EVERYBODY love it.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I've made these for company and everyone wanted the recipe.  Also, these make great leftovers.  In fact, they may even be better the next day!  I usually freeze a few for quick lunches too because the recipe makes so many.  Thanks for sharing!

This was incredible! I spiced it up a little more because my hubby and I love spice. This is a wonderful recipe and not to mention, easy. I was always afraid of cooking mexican style food, but this was so easy. Thank you for sharing.

My family loved this!! Even my 18-month old munched down every bite. It is a recipe to be played with...it was a bit on the mild side for us. Next time I'll be adding a cup of mild taco sauce and a cup of medium taco sauce. Definately a keeper in this house!

I tried to find a recipe that I had all the ingredients for in my kitchen and came across this one. I made it tonight and although, I personally didn't know how to roll the tortillas like a chimichanga, they tasted great! And they are very filling. I would definitely make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was so tasty.  I made a batch of these before I had to go out of town and instead of letting them go bad, I gave them to my folks.  They are still raving about them.  Anyone can feel like a Mexican chef with recipes like this.

Delicious! I wasn't sure what the recipe meant by "taco sauce", so I used a bit of tomato paste and used powdered taco seasoning on the meat. The dish turned out just as I had expected, and the leftovers froze very well. I'll make this again.

I had some leftovers from the Cubanos Frijoles recipe, and I used that for the filling. Hubby raved about it and even my preschooler had a few bites without making his usual "eew it's not pasta" face.

Absolutely delicious...I am a huge fan of Mexian food and have to say this is one of the best recipes I have tried. I love the fact that it is baked and not fried. Wonderful served on a bed of shredded lettuce with sour cream and guacemole.

These were very easy to make and tasted great!  I was skeptical at first about how they would taste baked instead of fried but was pleasantly surprised.  I'll definitely make them again.

Great recipe! I didnt have any refried beans when I went to make this so I blended up a can of mexican baked beans which worked just as well. I also smeared extra beans on top of it just before serving. Yum!!!!!
