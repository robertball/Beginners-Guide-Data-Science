Absolutely delicious. I initially had doubts about how it would turn out, however I followed the recipe strictly and it was wonderful. A hit at my families early Thanksgiving dinner. Thank you!

Tried it and didn't like it.  I don't care for the rosemary, sage, cayenne pepper, and thyme.  They're overwhelming.

The second time I made it, I used 4 eggs instead of one (it makes the dressing fluffier - not hard as a brick).  Eliminated the salt, but I snipped about 2 T. of fresh parsley into the saute pan, along with 3 cloves of minced garlic.  And I dumped in several really good shakes of Morton's Nature's Seasoning.  While the veggies were sauteeing, I poured a box of organic chicken broth over the crushed crackers.  (I used an old Tupperware Fix 'n Mix bowl, as the volume is quite large.)  I waited until after I mixed the butter/veggies into the softened crackers before I added salt.  (I tasted the mixture first to determine if I needed additional salt.)  Then I mixed in the well-beaten eggs and poured it all into a buttered Corning Ware pan.  (Oh... I eliminated the milk/cream.  Kind of silly to add that, IMO.)


I used 3 RIBS of celery - a stalk is the whole thing (you'd think that a CHEF would know that!).  I got rave reviews from the family - especially the picky grandchildren!  LOL

My recipe can be used with beef, pork, poultry, and fish because I don't use the sage, rosemary, and thyme.

I thought old fashioned cracker dressing was referring to the way the white folks made their dressing, so I had to check it out to expand my diversity training. It's delish!

This is the exact dressing that my Dad would make for Thanksgiving over  50 years ago.  Everyone loved it.  He was Lithuanian but I don't know where he got the recipe.  This year I will be making it and taking it to my son's home.  Every year my daughter-in-law stuffs the turkey with traditional stuffing and I bring a pan of a different dressing; oyster, cornbread, fruit, etc.  This year it will be cracker  in honor of my Dad.

I needed to use up some matzoh crackers, and subbed them for the saltines in this recipe. Poured mushroom soup over the top, baked it, and we ate it casserole style. Yum :)

This is what I remember growing up.  Stuffing/dressing that was dense and moist and flavorful.  Fantastic recipe.  I would not change a thing!

I thought it was great. Nobody present had ever seen dressing like this so it was hard for them to accept and a few liked it. The kids couldn't take it. I even found a couple pieces in the freezer 10 months later - heated them up and it tasted great still.

This is the first time I have ever seen a cracker stuffing recipe anywhere.  Cracker stuffing issue family tradition going back to my great grandmother.  I basically make this recipe minus the milk and chicken broth and with the addition of a pound of cooked and crumbled pork sausage. Instead of the broth and milk I BRIEFLY dip the crackers in water before I crush them for no more than 10 seconds.  I think this Thanksgiving I will dip them in chicken broth instead.

Very nice dressing and easy to make.  Nice change of pace anytime! Made it exactly as shown but added summer savory. Totally delicious..  Cooked just long enough for the top to be crispy and the inside was nice and moist. Will definitely make again.

I really wanted to Love this! I had been looking for a great dressing recipe. This just wasn't up to par for me. Very bland tasting. Followed the recipe exactly. Kind of dry. Even with adding turkey gravy it still was missing something.

Made it and it was absolutely delicious!  I'm used to the regular old fashioned bread dressing, and this was a nice change.  What made it even better was the next day.  I cut the leftover in squares, and melted butter in a skillet and browned both sides in it and ohhh boy!!!!! was that so tasty with bacon and eggs as a side.  Almost like frying up some polenta squares. :)  Will make it again!

Made this last year for Thanksgiving. EXCELLENT! Thinking of making it again instead of bread stuffing. It was just that good.

I agonized over this stuffing because it was dense and I thought would be dry.  Turns out it was a hit on turkey day.  I added some poultry spice to up the flavor.  I thought it needed it.  

I also made a vegetarian version and it was bland.

It was a little dry but easy to make. I think the dryness was because my dinner was delayed 2 hrs and had to keep it warm. I will try again for just a regular dinner night

I've taken wheat out of my diet and when my family was having traditional stove-top stuffing, I went on a search for something satisfying for me and this was it.  I used wheat free crackers and no egg, but it was definitely satisfying with all the right herbs.
