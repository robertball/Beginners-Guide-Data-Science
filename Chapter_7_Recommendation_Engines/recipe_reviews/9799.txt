I was very disappointed with this recipe.  The cookies have a taste an texture like sawdust.  They are too dry and are flavourless.  I will not be putting these on my Christmas cookie tray.

These were nice little cookie sandwiches, but nothing really special. Maybe I just didn't make them right.

I doubled the recipe and ended up with about 32 rounds instead of 40. I used splenda instead of white sugar and I didn't have any almonds, so I just added a little almond and vanilla essence to the eggs before combining them with the flour mixture.

Really delicate, tasty cookies. Only makes ten per batch and they cook fast, I had to bump it from 12 minutes to 9. Excellent with blueberry peach jam!

The finished product was perfect. Mini linzer tarts. My husband couldn't believe that I made them, fortunately he came home just as I was pulling them out of the oven so he knows it's true! I was worried after adding the egg that I did something wrong and kept re-reading the recipe, as the "dough" was so flaky and wasn't holding together. I just kept at it and ended up using my hands to push it all together. It took a good 10 minutes of continuous kneading to get it right. Next time I will use just less than 1 cup of flour to see if that helps. Very simply ingredients. This recipe just produces 10 finished cookies, so it was a good test run. Next time I will double/triple the ingredients to get a good batch - especially with the holidays coming up.
