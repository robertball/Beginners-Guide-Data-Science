This is similar to a recipe my grandmother used. She added chopped celery in place of the parsley and a cup or two of heated drained sauerkraut. She also browned the bacon before adding flour and the vinegar. The sauerkraut makes all the diference in the taste.

So spouse doesn't liky mayo, and wanted a more vinegar potato salad. This didn't look too difficult, and it had good reviews...it was YUMMY and a big hit at the cook out! The "sauce" cooked a whole lot faster than what the recipe said...after putting in the vinegar, and it thickened right up. One warning...this is not a low-cal recipe, but the taste is well worth the calories!

This tastes wonderful but I can't see using all the bacon grease in this recipe I would like to try it with less fat.

I made this recioe for a Birthday dinner and got exceellent reviews.  This is just like my great grandmother from germany used to make.Next I am going to and dill pickle juice instead of the apple cider vinegar and fresh dill and some chopped up dill pickles.  My other grandmother  from Bohemia used to make it with dill.

Yummy!  Loved it!  I do agree with one of the other reviews that there was not enough "dressing", but this may very well have been my own mistake because I accidentally used self-rising flour.  Oops!  I added a little water to try and thin it a bit, but it was still pretty thick.  After adding the vinegar sauce to the potatoes, I doctored it with just a little bit of mayo mixed with spicy brown mustard, just to add enough sauce to cover the potatoes. (got this idea from another recipe that used vinegar, mayo and mustard)  I will definitely make this again!

I wanted to like this recipe, but, it just didn't work for my family.   I much prefer the Hot German Potato Salad III from this site.  This salad just didn't have enough sauce for us.  It was barely enough to coat the potatoes, so, we lost the sweet and sour taste that is so good with German Potato Salad.   I used the exact ingredient measurements, so, I don't think I did anything incorrectly.  I think it would have been good flavor - just too dry.  I'll stick with my other recipe.

I consider myself a good cook but bacon can't cook w/the wetness from the onion.  The bacon was way undercooked & the flour added made a globular mess!!

It was a hit with my family! After reading the reviews though, I felt some changes needed to be made. I doubled the sauce and ended up adding about a cup of water to thin it out a little. I used half the amount of bacon that I drained of excess grease and cooked the onion (and some celery) separately in olive oil. We didn't have celery salt so I substituted Old Bay seasoning (my new favorite seasoning blend). Right before serving I sprinkled a handful of crispy onions along with the parsley over the salad to give it a little crunch. Thanks to all the previous reviews and a great recipe I ended up with a wonderful dish.

I agree with some of the other comments.  The flour made the sauce too thick and it was hard to coat  the potatoes. Frying the bacon and onions together left bacon undercooked and the onion overcooked!

The first time I tried this, I was sloppy about following the specific cooking directions and it did not turn out well. The second time, I followed them precisely and it was AMAZING! It was a big hit at Oktoberfest and I'll definitely make it again.

Thank you. My picky husbands loves it. I have made this several times. When I don't have bacon on had I have substituted deli ham or ham left over from a roast.  If I use ham I do add a little butter when cooking. It's still just as good.
