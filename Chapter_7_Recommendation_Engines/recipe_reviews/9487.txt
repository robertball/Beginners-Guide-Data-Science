This is an ok recipe for pecan pie.  It is one of the better ones actually, but the very best pecan pie is the one my mother has made for years.  I am going to submitt the recipe today.  It is for those of you that like a LESS SWEET version.  This version is REALLY SIMPLE, and every time I make it, everyone says it is the very best that they have ever eaten.  Pecan Pies today seem to be all corn surypy, so all you can taste is sweet.  My recipe is sweet, but buttery, almost caremelly. Here's the basic ingredients list.  
1 stick melted butter
1 c. sugar
1 c. butter flavored pancake syrup
1/4 tsp of salt
1 tsp vanilla extract
3 eggs
1 prepared pie crust(deep dish style crust or you might have a little too much filling.)
1 c. Pecans or Enough Pecans to cover the bottom of your pie shell.

You beat the 3 eggs well in a medium/large bowl, mix in the salt, sugar, and pancake syrup. Mix well, then slowly add the melted butter a little at a time to the egg mixture. Finally add the vanilla.
Arrange the pecans in the bottom of your pie shell and then pour the syrup misture over the top of it.  Put it into the preheated oven and bake like other recipes say.  I promise this is the best pecan pie you'll ever eat!!

Pecan Pie is always a favorite with my family and this one is dynamite!  One thing that should be in the instructions is that the water and corn starch are mixed together before adding to the sugar mixture.  I sometimes forget and add the water before I remember to mix it with the starch.  The result is either a watery base and end up cooking the sugar mixture longer.

I made this recipe as directed and it didn't turnout as well as I had hoped. I didn't want to give up on this recipe, so I made it again and tweaked the recipe using brown sugar and light corn syrup. This made a big difference and is the pecan pie I was looking for. I won't go back to my old recipe again.

I have made this pie a number of times and the taste is always outstanding.  I have learned a few tricks of the trade, though.  1) Don't over beat your eggs, or it will have something of a merengue effect (and be puffy when you take it out of the oven).  Do what the recipe said - just until frothy.  2) Go for two cups of pecans, and I personally add a mix of whole and half nuts.  3) In attempt to reduce sugar/calories (even if only slightly), replace the corn syrup with a sugar-free / regular maple syrup mix.  4) A tablespoon of cinnamon goes a long way. :)

Oh my, this pecan pie was outstanding!  I am not too big on pecan pie, but my husband and my mother are.  I mostly made it for my husband to accompany a very southern meal.  He was in love with it!  I too didn't have dark corn syrup on hand so I used light corn syrup and also I used 1/4 of a cup less sugar than it calls for because personally I am not too into very sweet Pecan Pie and it turned out VERY delicious.  Try it!

I searched all over for a good pecan pie to purchase, and for recipes.
I had all but given up until I came across this recipe. This is the one it's easy and exactly what a pecan pie  should be. The only thing I added was to top the pie off with pecans halved.

This is the first time I've made pecan pie and I, along with my husband, loved it!!!!
I only used 1 1/4 cup of sugar and instead of corn syrup I used maple syrup, which I think made it even better. And yes, you definitely have to wait till it cools in the fridge so it sets just right, or else it's pretty liquidy.

5 stars.  I don't even LIKE pecan pie but am now a fan after eating this pie. Our older son (38) was in for a visit, so I took a chance on this pie just for him since he loves pecan pie.  After his first bite he said "I could eat that entire pie!"  He loved it. My two concerns are that it is messy to make, and it took me longer than 10 minutes to prepare it--not  complaining but mentioning that for planning purposes.  When I was bringing the ingredients to a boil while stirring constantly, the sugar started sticking to the side of the pot, and I thought I was going to have a hot mess, but I persevered and I'm glad I did.  Today I used a different recipe as a test (comparison recipe uses white sugar and pancake syrup) and, while it was quick and easy, it was a totally different pie--no comparison.  The test pie tasted more like an old-fashioned chess pie with pecans added.  I will definitely throw out any other pecan pie recipes and replace with this one.  This pecan pie recipe will be the one that becomes a family tradition.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Linda!

This was a fantastic recipe!  My dad loves Pecan Pie, and I make one for him every year for Thanksgiving.  I've never been satisfied with with the results and decided to try something new this year.  Everyone raved!  I substituted light Karo for the dark, because that's all I had in the cupboard.  It was delicious!  I'll definitely make it again.

I am going to try making this pecan pie (never cooked one before). I have a question tho. What happens to the pecans once you put them in the mixture?  Do they rise to the top, or stay at the bottom of the pie? The pics show pecans all over the top, but no pic of the insides. If someone could just answer this for me, I'll be ready to go!
Thanks for this receipe!

This was a really great pecan pie.  In fact, I no longer make any other recipe.  This is a request from all who have tried it. It is not as syrupy and sweet as traditional pecan pie - I also put the pecans through the food processor, so I have them very fine - it makes a crunchy pecan top to a wonderful pie.  YUM!

IMPORTANT NOTE: the 2tbs water and the 2tsp corn starch should be made into a slurry and then added as a unit. Not separately. For those who cook often, this is kind of obvious, but for those who are on autopilot and just following the recipe word for word and not really thinking about it (like I was at 7am), it's an important distinction that will help avoid having to throw out 15 min of work and heat full of tiny corn starch pellets that refuse to dissolve properly.

I have been trying different Pecan Pie recipes for over a year now (had to learn after moving to the south!).  This one, by far, turned out the best!  I did what other's said & didn't beat the egg's too much.  I didn't have dark corn syrup so I used light.  I think next time I will use brown sugar instead.  The only alteration I did was I just dumped the pecans in the pie shell and then poured the egg/sugar mixture over them and cooked.  I also mixed the water with cornstarch first...maybe that made the difference!  VERY GOOD!  Will use this recipe again!

add flour to both sides of the pie crust so the hot syrup does not go thru and stick to the pie plate;  also stir water and corn syrup together before adding to other ingredients

My mother and I were looking for a good pecan pie recipe and this one did not disappoint.  Mom made two pies for her cousin and he loved them.  I made two for us and they turned out fantastic.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing, Ms Seay.

I just made this pecan pie for Christmas and I have to say it was the BEST pecan pie I've made to date!!  Wonderful texture--stayed together well and was not too sweet.  No modifications to this one!  I'm a Southern Alabama girl originally and let me tell you, I've had many great pecan pies in the South--but not one of them beat this one!!!  EXCELLENT!

I have to say, this pie made me really nervous when I first removed it from the oven. It was really jiggly and didn't look set up at all! But I let it cool for a good 30 minutes and it set up just fine after that. Very easy recipe, very yummy. I used the Pam's pie crust recipe from Pioneer Woman's site, it was perfect!

The people that like pecan pie and ate this one said it was very good and they ate every slice.  They did say it was very sweet, but apparently that's how it should be.  The crust needed to be tented in foil for the last part of baking as it got too brown.  This was very easy to make and looked very pretty.

I have been making pecan pie since I was 13. I have a GREAT recipe that I have always used and it always comes out perfect. I thought I'd try a different recipe just for the fun of it so I tried this one. I made it for Thanksgiving and followed the recipe word for word. I don't know what went wrong but the top crusted over and the middle never set. I threw the whole thing away. I would have been mortified to serve it. Lucky, I had made some outstanding pumpkin pies so we were okay (although hubby was disappointed- Pecan's his favorite). I will stick with my other recipe for sure.

My father actually was dissappointed when he thought that I didn't make one of these delectible pies on Christmas.  He told me on Thanksgiving, the first time I tried the recipe, that it was the best he had ever had, ate half of it, and kept complimenting me.  He's not one to say any dessert is 'Just right' although it usually doesn't stop him from eating anyway.

I have never tried the recipe exactly as the recipe calls for, because I like to make things my own I use brown sugar and light corn syrup because I think it makes it a little more carmel flavored.  Thank you so much for this recipe, it truly is the best.

On a side note, my fiance loves this pie too--and he hates pecan pie!

Delish. I did use brown sugar instead of white and light corn syrup instead of dark. Made my own crust. It was a hit by everyone.

This pie was very good, too sweet for my liking but as a tart it might get 5 stars (up the crust filling ratio) but for sweet lovers this is a must try.

I've tried many pecan pie recipes.  This is my favorite.  It seems richer yet not as sweet.  I had to cook it a little longer for high altitude, but used the same amount of ingredients.  My teeaged son asked for pecan pie for his birthday rather than cake, he commented on how good this pie was.

The only thing I changed was I mix the corn starch and cold water seperately before adding them to the mixture. Every time I bake this pie I get so many compliments and request to make more!!

So, my grandmother said she wanted a pecan pie this Thanksgiving.  I don't like pecan pie, but thought I would make her one.  I selected this recipe because it looked easy enough AND it did not contain maple syrup (blech!).  I did what one reviewer said and used light karo (instead of dark) and used brown sugar (instead of white sugar) only because that was what I had in the pantry.  It came out very tasty and was a HUGE hit!  I will be making it again for Thanksgiving day with the other side of the family.  I'm sure it will be as big a hit again!  And I have to say that now I like pecan pie!

Great and easy pie! My only drawback, ( and it's a small one), is that it is super sweet and rich. Definitally need coffee or Ice cream with this one. Also I took 1 c. of pecans and chopped them and added it to the filling them layered the pecans on top. It made it that much better!

I swap the syrup and sugar, using brown sugar and light karo syrup and this is the best pecan pie I've ever had. I'll never buy another bakery pecan pie. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first pie I ever made for my family and they absolutely loved it! My Mother helped by making the shell for me so I didn't have to buy one. It was superb. I followed the recipe exactly and we all really enjoyed it. We also had a scoop of french vanilla ice cream on the side. Yum!

Fantastic pie. I don't even like Pecan Pie, but I ate most of this one the first time I made it. I've made it several times, just as the recipe is written. Made my own crust this time, from the Old Fashioned Peach Cobbler recipe from this site..with the addition of a tsp of vanilla.

Easy to make & Yummy.  Don't worry if it puffs up on you while baking, it evens out as it cools.   A light brush of egg wash or corn syrup for those nice shinny edges.

I am a guy and I very seldom bake.  I had a craving for a Pecan Pie for Thanksgiving and decided to try to make one rather than buy one.  I tried this receipe.  It was very easy to make.  It tasted really good.  The only reason why I rated it a four star instead of a 5 star was because it turned our a little too sweet (but Pecan Pies are supposed to be sweet...right) and it the there was less filling (not as thick) than a store bought Pecan Pie.  Other than that it tasted just like a store bought Pecan Pie (which is a positive thing).  I am going to try and make it again for Christmas but do a little tweeking to the recipe, like 1 1/2 the recipe for the filling, and make try something that would not make it quite as sweet.  Any suggestions?

This pie is wonderful!  My dad loves pecan pie and said this is the best he has ever had..high compliments coming from my dad!!!  This pie is so rich and buttery.  I would recommend using expensive vanilla, because you can really taste the vanilla.  

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Excellent recipe, but I am adding tips below. In terms of classic pecan pie, best I ever had. But the author was a little lite on describing the process and it can be really frustrating to make.

My biggest issue is that the hot syrup hits the cold eggs and becomes almost candy-like and then cannot blend in. The tips below help with that. You need a really good hand mixer for this recipe.

1. Start with two things... Get the eggs cracked so they get to room temperature. I start a pot of boiling water to help with cleanup (basically I dump that into the pot the sugar mixture was in when I am done cooking and that melts it down for easy cleaning).

2. Cut the butter into 4-8 pieces - otherwise it takes too long to melt and the sugar starts cooking.

3. Don't add the cornstarch and water straightaway or the cornstarch can cook into gel-like sheets (gross). Mix the cornstarch and water in a cup and then as soon as the butter is melted turn the heat to medium and SLOWLY A LITTLE AT A TIME add some of the cornstarch mixture and stir quickly. Then a little more.  Then a little more. And so on. Do not take more than a minute doing this as the water, tiny amount that it is, is essential to not overcooking the sugar!

4. Once the cornstarch and water is in turn the heat up again. You really JUST WANT TO GET TO A BOIL. Remember, many pecan pie recipes don't have this pre-cooking (but cooking makes this one amazing!).  As soon as a few big bubbles come in the middle, you are done. It wil

This is a great, flexible recipe! A true keeper.

I used honey and brown sugar instead of sugar and corn syrup, and toasted my pecans with a little honey and salt, upped the total nuts, and chopped half of them finely and left half whole. This thing was gone in like ONE MINUTE. I don't usually like pecan pie because I don't like the "mystery goo" gelatinous stuff between the nuts, but this one was great. I think chopping half the nuts finely really made that goo impossible to form. We live in Texas, so there are some SERIOUS pecan pie fans in me and my husband's family-- everyone said it was the best they'd ever had. Literally, everyone. That's almost impossible to achieve in this group! Thanks SO much :)

This is my first pecan pie and my family loved it!  I am not a fan of this type of pie and prefer fruit pies, but I have to say, this was not nearly as sweet as I was afraid it would be!  I halved the white sugar and added 3/4 cup of brown sugar, giving it more of a carmel taste, which was much more palatable.  I also topped the pie with pecan halves, adding to the presentation.  Either vanilla bean ice cream or whipped cream tops this delicious dessert off well!  Must chill to set pie, so don't be daunted if it looks liquid-y out of the oven.  One last thing...... edit your recipe to combine the water and corn starch and add after the sugar/ butter mixture has boiled and been removed from heat. I used a deep dish pie plate, but believe me when I say a standard 9 inch plate is plenty big enough.

Perfection.  Didn't vary the recipe at all.  There wasn't a crumb left in the pie plate after dinner. I only wish I had used a homemade crust instead of store-bought- this pie deserves the best.

I had never made a pecan pie before, but this pie was easy to make and got RAVE reviews at Thanksgiving.  It was a bit runny, however, my Aunt and Mom who are life-long pecan pie lovers both said this was the best version they had ever had (even beat out Grandma's recipe!).  Because I know my family, I added an extra 1/2 cup pecans to the mix and another handful on top and it still worked great.

Although, it did turn out to be kind of a loose syruppy middle, the outside of the pie congealed.  I did use Maple Syrup from Cracker Barrel which is 55% maple Syrup and 45% Cane Syrup.  I bet another ten minutes and it would have been perfect for my oven.  I gave it 5 stars just on the flavor alone.  ( I did make my own crust )

I think I died and went to pecan pie heaven.....  this was AWESOME!!!  Just reduced the sugar to one cup and it was still plenty sweet.  I topped it with some whipped cream and acheived absolute perfection.  Thanks for a great receipe Linda.  I will be using it often.

Ok, i made this pie yesterday and i don't know what went wrong. I just followed the recipe letter by letter and the result is a very hard top, beside that it took soo much time to get the inside done. Maybe i overcooked it, i don't know.

I also used light corn syrup instead of dark, and everyone commented that it was much better (less sweet) than most p-pies. It took 65 minutes to cook, though.

Let me start off by saying this is the first pie I have ever made. This was recipe was easy. I did however use 2 cups of crushed and chopped pecans instead of the 1 1/4 cups from another review. It turned out very well. I also used Light corn syrup instead of dark just to base the sweetness. Later I baked it with dark corn syrup and it still turned out great just sweeter. All in all this was a great recipe. Thank you!

This is the recipe that I will be using from now on!  I have always used the recipe on the back of the Karo syrup bottle, but my pies never "set up".  This pie was perfect!  My husband didn't believe that I baked it.  I took it to work for reviews and got "two thumbs up" from each taste-tester.  One of my friends even asked for the recipe.  He said that it wasn't too sweet, and wasn't too syrupy - just perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have tried many recipes and this one is foolproof.  Boiling the first few ingredients really worked.  The taste was great.  Highly recommended.

This Thanksgiving, I tried two pecan pie recipes to see which of the two was liked the best.  This was one, and I tried another allrecipes.com recipe that used light corn syrup.  This one was heads and shoulders better than the other one.  It was absolutely delicious.  The other one was prettier than this one, but the taste of this one was far superior.  (The other recipe on its own would have been good, too, but in comparison to this one was paled.)  Thank you for this great recipe.  This will be a mainstay in our family for years to come.

I'm not a pecan pie fan, but my husband won't eat any kind of fruit pie. So when Thanksgiving comes around I always have to make an apple pie for me and a pumpkin or pecan pie for my husband. In the past years the pumpkin and pecan pies have always failed, but I tried this recipe this year, and my husband loved it. I was not very confident in making it, but it turned out great. I even had a few bites. My husband has already asked me to make another one.

This is a 5 star recipe!  Thank you Linda for cooking the mixture first.  It makes all the difference in the world.  Once you have tasted this pie, you will never go back to the non cooked ones!  My ingredients varied a little bit.  I use 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup corn syrup, 1/4 cup butter, 3 eggs, 1 cup pecans, 1 tsp vanilla.  Thank you Linda for a great posting!

it had a good taste to it but I needed a deeper pie crust like a deep dish.  the filling covered up my pecans and gave it a hard sugar crust.  You could not tell what kind of pie it was by looking at it when it came out of the oven.  And I followed the instructions to the letter.

When I made this it was, at first, not what I was expecting.  It didn't quite look right.  I proceded to make a different pecan pie, but then I came back to this one and it was absolutely beautiful!  I tasted it, and melted on the spot.  My husband (who is self reportedly not a big dessert guy) tasted it, and long story short, everyone who came to dinner that night got the lesser 2nd baked pecan pie because this one was all gone.  This is by far and away the MOST DELICIOUS pie I have ever tried.  I guess I learned that southern pecan pie is a bit different and infinitely better, than the type I was accustomed to.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Flavor was incredible.  But, I had the same problem with the filling that others had.  It was soupy and ran out of the pie when it was cut into. Everyone still ate it and said it had a good flavor but it would have been nice if it would have came out right.

I have never baked a pecan pie before and was slightly leary. This recipe is so easy and even with a purchased pie crust, it was so good! Definitely add a dollop of cool whip on top. YUM!

Very good!  My first time baking pecan pie (or much of anything for that matter)  I took it to work and everyone liked it alot.  I was VERY pleased, as I am a big pecan pie lover.  I just made two more to take to family Christmas dinners, and I'm sure they'll have a good turn out there too.  The only thing I would change would be the pie crust... I used the kind that you just unfold into the pan, and it is good enough, but does get a little overcooked, but doesn't taste bad.  I've heard others mention that they put foil over the edges, so I may try that next time.  Overall, a GREAT recipe.

I just made this recipe today.  I purchased the allrecipes Thanksgiving & Christmas cookbook and when it came yesterday, this recipe just sort of "jumped out" at me.  It is by far the BEST pecan pie recipe I've made - simple to prepare and delicious, and the VERY BEST pecan pie I've ever tasted.  I made two pies, and very glad I did, as I'm sure everyone will love them for our Thanksgiving Day dinner tomorrow as much as I did.

I only had light corn syrup, so I used almost 1/4 cup but added molasses to that, probably 1T, to make 1/4 cup in total.  It worked well.  The recipe was easy to follow, tasted fantastic, and could easily be used to make mini pies as well.

Helpful tips:  The syrup cooks quickly and needs stirred, so have all your ingredients ready beforehand.  The egg mixture needs tempered, so only add a tiny bit at a time to bring up the temp slowly to avoid scrambling the egg.  Lastly, for a more decorative pie, after you pour the mixture into your crust, you can arrange pecan halves on the top before baking.

I've made this pie several times, because when it's good, it's very good.  But even though I follow the recipe, the result can vary, and when it goes bad, this is the problem:  A hard shell forms on top as the pie bakes.  It's impossible to see what's going on underneath.  The first time this happened, the pie was salvageable.  But yesterday, for Thanksgiving no less, it wasn't.  Luckily I'd foreseen a disaster and baked a back-up using a different (non-cooked) basic recipe.  Good thing I did.  

Maybe the problem has to do with oven temperature, because even the successful back-up pie started forming a shell, which I scraped it off early in the baking and put it back in the oven.

Does anyone know why this happens???  I've searched online and can't find it.   It does happen to other people; there are reviewers right here for this pie who complained about it.  I'd love to know.  But after cutting through that hard top shell on Thanksgiving and watching the filling run, I will never bake this pie again, unless I get an answer.

This pie was delicious and easy to make.  I read the reviews before making it and noticed that several people recommended cutting the sugar a bit to reduce the sweetness.  I thought for sure that you couldn't have a "too sweet" pecan pie.  However, it was VERY sweet.  I think next time, I'm going to take their recommendations and reduce the sugar a bit.

I actually really loved this recipe. I made a few changes based on the suggestions of others as well as a few of my own.

First instead of buying an unbaked pie shell I bought frozen pastry dough that was slightly sweet and then cut the sugar down to 1 1/8 cups of which I did 5/8 brown sugar and a half cup of white. I also baked it in a tart pan so it was thin rather than the thick pecan pie you get with an unbaked pie shell and it was delicious. As it was thinner I only baked it for 40 minutes.

Like others suggested I mixed the cold and cornstarch before I added it. I also left half of the pecans whole and I chopped half. 

I think next time I will sprinkle some cinnamon sugar over the top before I bake it. I think it could be interesting.

This pie is so wonderful. More pecans than any other. I tend to cook it 5-10 minutes longer than asked for here. It comes out an almost carmel candy vs pie, but everyone seems to love it best that way.

Perfect pie. I made one off the Karo syrup label and it was so bad I threw it out and came to this recipe. I made it with walnuts instead. Everyone loved it. GREAT RECIPE! Oh I followed another reviewer's tip and used 1 cup sugar, 3/4 cup brown sugar, also added more nuts -- 2 cups. YUM!

My family loved this recipe.  I have never made a pie in my life and i surprised myself by how easy this was.  I substitued a 1/4 cup of whole/half pecans with the ground pecan (because we bought both at a pecan stand) and it turned out delicious.  Thanks!

This pecan pie is super easy and DELICIOUS!! I have made 3 already!  I slowly heated the sugar and corn syrup mix up to boiling as to not burn the sugar.  Make sure you put the pie in the oven as well because if you don't, it will be pretty liquidy.  I Wouldn't change a thing!

This is the best pecan pie I think I've ever made! My husband loves pecan pie, and he definitely approved of this one. The flavor is absolutely excellent. I didn't change it much, but I did use a 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1 1/4 of white, which I think gave it a slightly richer flavor. It seemed to have a hard crust on top once it had cooled, but when we cut into it, the filling was baked to exactly the right consistency. One tip: I don't like making pie crusts, and I found that this filling fits perfectly into one Marie Callendar deep dish crust.

I didn't try it, because it was eaten before I had the chance!  Everyone raved about it.  I changed the butter to margarine and the corn syrup to light because those are what I had on hand, and it still turned out great.

This turned out great! We don't have corn syrup in the UK which is why I chose this recipe.  I was very impressed with the flavour. I have a fan assisted oven which increases cooking times. It was ready in 30 minutes.  I think if I made it again due to my oven I would only put it in for 5 minutes at 400 and then turn it down to 350 for 25 minutes.

I made this for Easter and it came out pretty good.  It tasted a bit too sweet to me, but that's how pecan pie is supposed to be anyway.  I'll make it again.  Thanks for posting it!

This is the first pie that I have ever made and I am thrilled with the way it tastes-- I was actually reluctant to offer my guests remaining slices to take home, because I wanted to keep them for myself :)  It's great to have found such a wonderful, easy recipe that I know I will be using for years to come!  Thank you!

My first Pecan Pie was scruptious thanks to this great recipe! The filling set up nicely and this pie has just the right amount of sweetness and crunch. This pie is so good it doesn't even need ice cream. I will make this again and again. Thank you Linda for sharing this easy, delicious recipe.

I've never been a pie baker, and this was the first one I had tried in a while. Everyone in our study group liked pecans, so I chose this one. 

It got rave reviews and requests for repeats!  This recipe is not as sweet as most pecan pie recipes, so it made it better.
 Definitely worth any effort put forth on it!

Loved it! Used brown sugar instead of white, white corn syrup instead of dark, 2 cups of pecans. Will never buy a store bought pecan pie again.

I made a few tweaks based on others' reviews. Are used brown sugar instead of white, and used white syrup instead of dark. And I cut back on the sugar by 1/4 C.  Excellent.  To dress it up, after I poured it in the pie shell, I took extra whole pecans and placed them around the perimeter facing inward. Then I pushed them under the mixture to get the wetness on top of them.  One of my guests remarked how nice that looked. Sorry, I didn't think to take a photo of it before we dug in!

This was the first pecan pie I've ever made. I used some tips in the comments like mixing the water and the corn starch before adding. The pie turned out perfect! It was so good that my boyfriend ate almost the entire thing before morning. (Their heart really is through their stomach.) Thank you and I'm writing this one in the recipe book!

I accidentally bought light corn syrup instead of dark, but it was still a fantanstic recipe! All I did different was drizzle a bit of dark chocolate, caramel & sea salt on top just to see if I liked it or if it was too much, and it did add a rather nice touch. Very easy recipe and very good!

Very good, all flavor and texture. But I had a problem: just had clear corn syrup and no time to spare, so I used that one and golden sugar instead and came out just great. By the way, if somebody doesn't like super sweet stuff I would cut the sugar to 1 cup only. This is a great recipe, try it!

I made this for Thanksgiving, but never got the chance to try it - this 5-star review is based on all the ranting and raving of everyone who ate it.  It was fabulous, and I loved the attention that I got for making it!  Will definitely be making this again, no changes, just as is, and happy to do it!

Delicious! I don't know if I measured wrong and but too many nuts in, or I measured right and the recipe called for it, but my turnout was a little too dense for me. I like to let the gooey corn starch mix shine in my pecan pie, and the nuts over took it a bit. Regardless, it was a huge hit! Even my husband who doesn't like pecan pie much really enjoyed the pie this year.

This is my first attempt at a pecan pie. I made this recipe for my family and it was a hit! Everyone loved it and wanted more. I used light corn syrup and it gave it a sweeter taste, if that's what you want/like. One thing I would do differently is cook it slightly less. I prefer it ooey-gooey rather than more solid and jello like. I cooked the pie for only 40 minutes and still found it more solid than I would prefer. So if you like your pie to ooey-gooey than I would suggest baking it for about 30-35 minutes and letting it cool on your stove top or a cooling rack. If you prefer it more solid, I would bake it for 40-45minutes and let it cool in the fridge to set. Other than that, great recipe would definitely make it again

I have made this recipe twice now, and both times it was FANTASTIC, everyone loved it. I did only one thing different and that was with the sugar. I substituted 1/4 cup of the white sugar with light brown sugar.

I tried this recipe because it was a bit different than the one I normally make because it cooked the sugar mixture and I wanted to see if that made a difference. The pie is very good and firms up nicely so you can make clean cuts.

Made this for a church activity last night where everyone brought pie.  People were excited to see a pecan pie in the mix and everyone who had a slice said it was wonderful.  Pecan pie isn't one of my usual choices but I had a slice this morning for breakfast.  Very tasty!  I used half pecans and added about 1/2 cup more since they weren't chopped.  I also cooked for 5 minutes more than the max time. Once it cooled it was the perfect consistency, just a little runny.

Made this for Christmas dinner dessert and everyone raved about it! Added a little maple whiskey in one and it was marvelous! It's on the sweet side so I'll probably cut the sugar next time.

I've made this twice. The first time was perfect for me because the filling was not as thick. Maybe it was the eggs were well beaten. Don't put pecans than the recipe calls for. It will dry it out too much.

Although I didn't use the pie crust recipe here, due to time restraints (who doesn't run into that for holiday baking???), there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with this recipe. I have used it once before this time, but couldn't quite remember how it was - possibly because I baked it for another event and wasn't able to try a piece myself before it was gone! This is mmm-mmm good, honest pecan pie. No frills, just great pecan pie taste and simple to make. It's a keeper for sure!

I made this pecan pie recipe for Thanksgiving. After reading the reviews I decided to make it as a tart because it is such a sweet pie. The result was fabulous! It was delicious and very popular. This was my first pecan pie and I couldn't be more pleased with the result. The only thing I would add to the instructions would be to mix (not beat) the boiled sugar mixture into the egg. I beat mine and I feel it was a bit too fluffy as it consumed the pecans I placed on top and ruined my beautiful pecan design. However, it was still the best pecan pie I have ever tasted and I will be making it again noting this change.

This pie was fantastic!  My dad who is particular about his pecan pie absolutely raved over it.  I accidentally bought light corn syrup instead of dark.  I don't know if this made a difference in the way the pie turned out but I will use light corn syrup every time I make it.

Delicious! This pie was a big hit! I used a homemade buttermilk crust for the bottom and then sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top with the garnish pecans. I did have to cover the pie with foil about ten minutes before it was done, but other than that, this was the best, first pecan pie I've ever made!

I made this recipe for Christmas and it was perfect!  I made 3 small changes (1)used 1 and 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 3/4 of white sugar. (2)used light Karo Syrup instead of dark  (3) topped pie with Candied Pecans (yummy) I loved how easy this was to make.  Now, serve it warm with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream and you've got yourself a piece of heaven!

This pie was delicious!  I used pecans from my husband's grandmother's tree (they taste soooo much better if you have access to them) and even did a "fancy" design on top.  Thank you for the recipe!  We enjoyed it very much!

I didnt give it 5 stars because hubby complained that there wasnt enough filling so next time gonna make a little more filling.  It was an awesome pie but I used 1 cup chopped pecans for the filling and then a 1/2 cup whole pecans all over the top.  Everyone raved how good it was!!

I followed the recipe with three exceptions - 1/2 cup butter, 1-1/4 cups sugar, and light corn syrup.  This was excellent! I made the pie for my husband, who is very picky about his pecan pies.  I had been searching for a recipe that met his definition of a "good pecan pie" and this is it! I made it today - Thanksgiving - for the first time and it was a hit! I don't even like pecan pie and I thought it was very good.  I will certainly make thisin. one again.

I love pecan pie, but was a little nervous about the mixed reviews on this one.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was wonderful!  I think cooking the filling on the stove first was the difference.  It set up perfectly!  People who complained about it running over may have had too shallow a pie crust; I used a homeade crust in a standard deep dish pie plate and the amount of filling was perfect.  (And please learn to make your own piecrust ... it makes a world of difference!)

This is by far the very best pie. My family had requested that I make a pecan pie for Thanksgiving. Keep in mind that I don't have a first clue how to make pie, much less pecan pie. I followed the recipe, let it cool for about 6 hours, and off to do family stuff. My father is a HUGE pecan pie fan and prefers the sweeter stuff as opposed to the store bought brand. He is IN LOVE with this pie. Matter of fact, I am not allowed to show up for Christmas without one. Also, he has also made a request for one pie every month. Thank you, thank you...it's a hit with everyone I know now. Oh, I didn't have a to change a thing.  I will say that if you don't want to have to clean the bottom of your oven everytime you make one, put the pie on a large cookie sheet first.  Problem solved!!  Thanks again!

WOW!!! Now THIS is some Pecan Pie! The dark corn syrup gave this a rich molasses type flavor, and the filling was really dense. I added extra pecans and used halves instead of pieces. I love pecan pie and this is probably the best one I have ever tasted. I had trouble with the crust getting "carmelized" with all the sugars and it didn't cut very well, but the flavor was fabulous and it sure disappeared fast.

I thought this was the pie I made last year. But its not. I was unsure through the whole thing, the mixture in the sauce pan didn't look right. I went against my better judgement and wasted my pecans anyway. Good thing the only other stuff wasted was a lot of sugar. All the sugars in the pie had burned within 30 minutes, and bubbled all over the bottom of my stove. Maybe I did something wrong??? But I followed the recipe exactly. I even turned my oven down after 10 minutes. Now I have a huge mess in the bottom of my oven. I will find a different recipe.

I am currently five months pregnant but it seems that my husband is the one with all the cravings!  He requested a pecan pie the other day so I made this recipe for him while he was out.  First, I don't eat pecan pie, second I don't know what it is supposed to taste like and third, I've never made one before!  I followed the recipe exactly however I did combine the corn starch and water first as suggested by another reviewer.  It came out perfect.  In fact, after letting it rest for four hours or so, the pie held up in perfect slices despite some reviews that said to the contrary.  Oh, and my husband LOVED it!  I will definitely make this again.

This may not be the prettiest pie to serve but the taste and texture are wonderful.  Everyone loved it (even non-pecan pie eaters). As mentioned in another review mix the cornstarch and water together.

I was disappointed in this pie.  I followed the directions and my filling puffed up and became very crusty.  As it began to brown to quickly, I tried to cover it with foil.  It stuck to the foil and ended up very unattractive.  The taste, however, was good.  Maybe it would help to add the pecans on top of the filling.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

This is the first time that I made Pecan Pie and decided to try this recipe, I was always told that making Pecan Pie was difficult but this recipe was so easy and delicious that I will make from here on out. I made as is following ingredients and directions exactly and it came out perfect. I even posted a picture of how mine tured out.

I love pecan pie and I followed this recipe exactly. I was a little disappointed because this pie was ok at best. It's very sweet. I am from Quebec where sugar pie is very popular and this recipe reminded me more of a sugar pie with pecans in it. Again, way too sweet. Not a keeper for me... will keep on looking.  Cheers.

It was great, I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup , and also i used brown suger and splenda instead of white suger (half of each) . It was to die for , everyone loved it,it looked great and smelled wow.

I made this for my husband for Father's Day and he loved it.  I did add a little bit more pecans because he really likes nuts.  Thanks for the post.

OH MY GOODNESS! This was the first time I made pecan pie and it was DELICIOUS, although certainly decadent. The only change i would make would be to add about 1/2 cup extra of pecans because i personally really like pecans. Also when stiring in the syrup mixture, pour it slowly but don't stop, because if you do the egg wont heat up enough to melt it. Other than that is was GREAT!

Five stars does not do this justice.  This is the pecan pie recipe that you have been looking for.  The balance of sweetness and richness is just right.

This is a great pie!  More pecans & less sugary filling like most pies.  NOTE: If making this recipe at high altitude (I was at 8900') lower your oven to 325 and keep a close eye on it.  As soon as it looks set pull it.  I overcooked mine and it ran all over the oven- but it was still very good!

Well, I covered the bottom rack with aluminum foil in case the pies bubbled over. Big mistake! After 50 minutes of baking, the crust was not even golden and the filling was still liquid!
BUT, after removing the foil and baking an additional 30 minutes, the center finally set up and the crust browned. 
I won't give a bad rating because of my mistake.
Hubby loved the flavor, said it wasnt as sweet as a lot of them are. Will definitely make this one again.

I've made this 4 times. The first 2 times, it turned out perfectly. The second 2 times, it tasted great, but for some reason the pecans didn't float to the top and it was SLOPPY. Still can't figure out what I did wrong. But, it is delicious. ;-)

It turned out pretty good. Very doughy, sticky and spongy. I was concerned at first because I'm used to pie crust not doing that and rolling out better. I used cream wrap on both sides while rolling out the dough it made a big difference. The recipe was very easy to make and tasted great. Only thing I didn't have corn syrup so I substituted for molasses. Not sure if that made a difference in the cooking process before cutting because it did oozz out and not form but we didn't mind. Someone cut the pie to early. Will try it again and post picture.

I had to make a few changes to make it fit a 10 inch pie plate and to use less sugar, and it was fantastic!  I doubled most of the recipe:  I doubled the eggs (plus one more yolk), the water, the corn starch (plus one additional tsp of starch), the corn syrup, the salt, and the vanilla.  For the sugar, instead of doubling the 1 and 3/4 granulated sugar, I used 2 cups of Splenda, and 1 1/2 cups of granulated sugar to cut my sugar in half.  I kept the chopped pecans the same and added a ring of whole pecans on the top for decoration.  It worked great, tasted great, and looked beautiful! 

I baked it at 350 with the crust edges covered from the start because I had to increase my baking time from 45 mins to an hour and 5 minutes.  (I started checking the filling for set at 50 minutes and kept adding 5 more minutes till set.)  I WILL be using the exact same recipe again!  :)

This was a really good recipe. Made it for my daughter in law as a surprise for her graduation party. I couldn't find the dark so I used light. Only difference is that the pie came out a little lighter in color and it wasn't so sweet.  It was really good.

Quick and easy to prepare. May look intimidating and scary to figure out if you can get it to cook and set properly before its over done or scalds on the top but I ran it for about 55 minutes at 350F. It got me a slightly bouncy but set center that a toothpick ran clean-ish on, and further set as it cooled off. 

It was a Christmas Eve HIT!

PS: I added roughly a 0.5oz or so shot of Kraken spiced rum into the wet ingredients while on the stove. It provided the perfect little oomph.

I'm sure this recipe is just fine if you're familiar with making what essentially is a caramel sauce.  That said, for newbies like myself, it was a disaster and instructions could be clearer on the timing of the sequences.  By the time I poured the sauce into the beaten eggs, the caramel sauce started to recrystallize and was just a chunky mess.  I threw the mixture out, wasted the ingredients and now have rock hard caramel on the side of a pan that I will probably throw out as well.  I had to go buy a pie which was very discouraging for trying this the first time.  If there's room for error in the steps in a recipe, say what those are please!  More detailed instructions or a better video would be a great help!

Fabulous recipe.. followed some of the suggestions and reduced the amount of sugar to only 1 cup.. used light corn syrup instead of dark, and added 1/4 cup pure maple syrup.   Added an additional 1/4 cup pecans and it was so full of goodness!  Will definitely be making this again.    Remember to mix the cornstarch with cold water first before adding the rest of the ingredients you are boiling.

Rave reviews from all at Thanksgiving. De-throned my dear ol' Ma from her decades-long Pecan Pie supremacy. She even wanted me to make it again for Christmas! It's just not as super-sweet as most recipes and lets the pecans be the star, as they should be. I subbed light corn syrup and cane sugar; and fresh, lightly toasted pecans from nana's backyard. Perfection!

Great pie! I think I overcooked it just a touch because the top was more like candy near the edges but it was still so delicious none the less.
I didn’t change anything in the recipe but I think the cook time was a bit off because after 50 mins, my pie was still very jiggly so I covered and did an extra 15 (which in hindsight should have only done 8 mins or so).

This is definitely added to our family tradition on Thanksgiving now!

Absolutely delicious! I made this pie for Thanksgiving and was devoured. I went to get a slice and it was gone!  My fiance insists on me making another just for him. I will but he will have to share.

I definitely messed with the recipe, but I think the original recipe still merits full stars! I split the sugar half and half between white and light brown. I also added a hearty dash of: makers mark, molasses, maple syrup, and “gingerbread” spice. One of those (or the perfect combo of all) led several people to comment that this was the best pecan pie they had ever had. Who knows! But I thought it was pretty tasty. Enjoy!

I love that it’s not sickeningly sweet! I only made one small adjustment - I put about a half cup chopped pecans in the sugar mixture then placed halved pecans on top. My boyfriend, who normally does like Pecan Pie, LOVED it!

This was my first time baking a pie, let alone a pecan pie. The original ingredients were too sweet, so I decided to start over again. So, I changed the amt of sugar. I reduced it to 1 cup of sugar and added 3 Tbs of brown sugar. I made sure to mix the water and cornstarch together, which I did not do the first time, before adding it to the mixture.

THANK YOU to the reader who submitted the tip to mix the corn starch and water before combining. I did that. This pie was a massive hit. I also lined the pie crust with pecan halves for extra crunch. It’s a delicious pie. I made it to the exact recipe. For those who wish to cut some sweetness, you can use less sugar. It’s perfect as is, otherwise.

I made it just as written, although I mixed the corn starch into the water before adding to the rest. And I accidentally added about a half teaspoon extra of the vanilla extract. 
I've made a number of pecan pies over the years, and this is by far the best I've found. The dark karo was the flavor I've been looking for. My husband raved about this one!

I’ve made this pie for Thanksgiving for the last 5 years or so and have had great luck with it. It tastes exactly the way classic pecan pie should taste although I lay out pecan halves across the top before baking ( to make it look fancy, lol!)  Otherwise I follow the recipe to the letter. It looks like another person posted their pecan pie recipe in one of the reviews because they thought this one was too sweet... Isn’t pecan pie supposed to be sweet? I’m sticking with this one!

The only change I would make is baking it for q hour 10 min. I started with 55 min at 350 middle rack and that was still very soft. I put it in for another 5 min afraid it may be too long. After letting it cool 2 hours I can say it's very gooey. 40 to 50 is never going to cook it right.

This is the first pecan pie I've ever baked and I'm really happy with how it turned out! I substituted molasses for the corn syrup and think it lent a nice flavor.

I made this pecan pie and it turned out that I had to cook it a bit longer then it says to because the inside of the pie was still watery. In the end it turned out delicious :)

Excellent from start to finish. Only change I made was more pecans. Instead of 1 1/4 cups I used 2 cups. This pie is to die for! Despite the high sugar content a few of my guests said it wasnt overly sweet. I would agree with them.

It works. Beautifully. 
(It also "halves" nicely.  I used 1 and a half eggs - by taking 1 egg out of the shell, weighing it and fried the other half for myself.. in between toast with a little cheese.. quick breakfast while you work on pie!) Definitely a keeper.

I will make this again & again & again!
Make sure you mix cornstarch & water paste together before adding to mix.    I used a mix of brown sugar/ white sugar instead of all white.   
Increased nuts to 2 C & used 1/2C corn syrup.   
Cooked for 40 minutes.  45 would have been too long.

Sorry to say, this turned out terrible.  Couldn't cut it and even tried breaking it up, hoping it would be like candy.  Whole thing ended up in the garbage.  Don't know what went so wrong.

I gave it 4 stars as written. It was a little sweet for us. I’ve made it several times now using just 1 cup of sugar. Everything else we kept the same. We love it this way.

WOW!! very, very delicious.  I substituted brown sugar for corn syrup, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  For presentation sake, try not to over froth the mixture when stirring and let the mixture settle a few minutes before putting in the oven.  This prevents a frothy film on top  that obscures the beauty of the pie (you can see this greyish-tan film on several of the pictures posted). This happened to mine and I allowed it to cool and pealed off the frothy 1-2 mm layer that had separated from the body of the pie.  I then placed a few pecans on the top and it was beautiful and delicious!

This is fantastic recipe. Yes, I substituted a few items....brown sugar for white and a mix of pure maple syrup and light corn syrup for the dark corn syrup. The consistency of the filling was absolutely perfect and easy to put together. Not to sweet, hints of caramel and yummy pecan bits in every bite.  I can't wait to make another one and maybe this time I will get more than a sliver to eat as it disappeared mighty quick!

Delicious and easy to make, especially with a pre-made crust.

One of the things I don’t like about pecan pie is that it’s usually too sweet. I reduced the amount of sugar a little bit and the pie turned out perfect! This was a tasty, yet easy recipe.

Great pie and everyone loves it but each time I've made it I come up short just a tad on filling in a real pie pan. It makes plenty if you're using an aluminum pan with a shell.

So happy with this recipe. It turned out perfect. So good my husband went for seconds. I made it just like the recipe except I used maple syrup in place of the dark syrup. I prefer the lighter tasting filling so using the lighter syrup was perfect.

I've actually never made Pecan Pie before. But I think this one turned out great. I read through the reviews and used brown sugar and light corn syrup. I also like the note that you mix the water and cornstarch together before adding it to the recipe. Great tip! I'm not crazy about whole pecans (pieces in bites work for me), so I just chopped the pecans, put them in the crust, added the filling and it all worked out fine. I'm glad I tried this recipe!

Instead of dark corn syrup I used honey . I think it makes it tastes more organic.

I will totally make this again! My changes: swapped 1/4th of the dark corn syrup for real Canadian Maple Syrup, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and made my own short crust pasty (super simple in my own recipe list). It was "the best Pecan Pie" my friends and family have ever had. And they are serious fans ignore pecan pie.

This was the first time I made pecan pie and it was perfect and much easier than I thought.  I only had light corn syrup so I substituted 1/2 brown sugar for 1/2 cup granulated sugar.

Made it exactly as written, and it was perfect!! Will be making again and again and is my new go-to. Glad to get the tip on mixing the cornstarch and water together first before combining with the rest of the filling.

This was the first pecan pie I've ever made and second time I've actually eaten it. It was the favorite of the three different pies I made. It turned out perfect. I had to adjust based on ingredients I had on hand (1 1/2c  white sugar, 1/4c brown sugar, and 1/4c light corn syrup). I intentionally adjusted the pecans and mixed in only 1 cup of chopped pecans and then layered the top with about a cup or so of half pecans (as shown in the Irresistible Pecan Pie recipe). I thought the syrup texture was odd, as though the sugar would not melt, and that I did something wrong, but it really did turn out perfect. This is my husband's favorite pie and he says this was the best he's ever had. Thank you so much for this recipe!

My husband has been wanting me to make a pecan pie for Thanksgiving for years. This was this year. First pecan pie I ever made and it was perfect. I mixed the ingredients for boiling before boiling. Water and starch first then sugar and syrup on top. Melt butter and add the sugar mixture. It was perfect. ??

Sooo yummy! I doubled the recipe to make two pies. Th only thing I changed was the replace 1 cup of the doubled white sugar with brown sugar, just for a deeper flavor. My pies didn’t turn out pretty (I’m sure that was operator error), but my goodness  they are good!
Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe!  Using what I had on hand, I made a few substitutions and it was great!  I used 1 C. white sugar and 3/4 C. brown sugar.  I also substituted pancake syrup for the corn syrup.  I also had to cook it a bit longer than was suggested: 65 minutes.

Just about perfect especially using fresh Georgia pecans. I added an extra egg on one iteration and swapped out a quarter cup of the sugar for an extra quarter cup of the corn syrup and both versions turned out perfect

Been using this recipe for years and it’s great! I use 100% maple instead of corn syrup and cut down the sugar to just 1 cup, came out fantastic! Goes great with vanilla ice cream.

So the flavor was great but my filling was runny!  This was my first time attempting such a pie and I am chalking it up to inexperience. Does any one have some tips for making sure the filling comes to the correct consistency?  I appreciate any insight.

The center came out watery, like as in you have to drink it it was so runny, and the top got really burnt even though I only put it in 45 minutes.

It turned out very watery and not good at all. I am not an incredible baker, and so I didn’t know the corn starch should have been mixed with water before added into the sugar mixture. Very disappointing.

I don't know where I went wrong but my pie boiled over and by the time I realized what had happened half of the pecans weren't in the pie anymore. The other half was crusty but not cooked or set. I only make pecan pie for Christmas and I'm the only one who makes it. Very upset and will not ever use or suggest this recipe

Very easy to make!  Wonderful rich flavor.  I used a deep dish crust for this.  I'm not usually a pecan pie type of girl BUT I ate this pie over my pumpkin pie.  I'm making this again tonight so my husband can have more!  Found my pecan pie recipe for my Bible book!

I made it and it was pretty easy.  Everyone loved it!  I saw some of the comments to cook it a little longer so I let it cook about 30 min before putting the topping on and then another 20 min.  Only ingredient that I didn't use was lemon zest.  Thanks for the recipe!

I let the sugar cool worried it would cook the eggs, warmed back up to get it out of the pan. Finished pie was very runny. Tried again, followed instructions exactly and still very runny. Time for a different recipe.

It was delicious and I will be making it again for Christmas... The only thing I did not like is the cooking time, for my oven I think it was about 7 minutes too long..

I'm not a big fan of pecan pie myself because I find that they are always too sweet, but I volunteered to make one because my husband loves pecan pie. I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was a huge hit. The crust almost burned but that had more to do with the quality of the pie shell. The second time that I made this pie I used Texas Pie Company's Pie Dough Puck and the crust was delicious. I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups on the second pie since I don't like my pies too sweet. I also set aside a handful of pecans and then sprinkled them on top of the pie after I poured in the mixture. Those pecans ended up giving the second pie a slightly more crunchy texture which I love.

I decided to attempt my first pecan pie for Thanksgiving. I read the other reviews and used brown sugar and light corn. Got rave reviews from everyone! Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was SO delicious! I didn’t have dark corn syrup and had to use light. Other than that I made no other changes. My husband and I think it’s the best pecan pie we’ve ever had. One helpful hint - Trader Joe’s makes a bourbon vanilla extract that adds a hint of bourbon flavor and makes this pie out of this world!

I did substitute vanilla flavored bourbon for the water (maybe a little more than 2 Tablespoons!) - and I got a ton of compliments on this pie!! One more thing - I didn't have dark corn syrup, so I used light, and it was still very good.

I hadn't made pecan pie in years because mine always turned out like glue, but for my son, whose favorite is pecan, I decided to try this recipe. It turned out so great I was amazed. It was beautiful, too! No pictures because it went fast! I will definitely make this again, but I'll beat the egg before bringing the filling to a boil next time so less stays in the pan and out of the pie.

I might add less eggs, maybe 2 eggs!  It rose and went over the side of my very large pie plate!  Otherwise the flavor was fine.

Very traditional pecan pie.  First time making pecan pie.  Had trouble getting the crust covered so the crust was a bit too brown.  Pie turned out delicious.

This pecan pie was very good - my guests really enjoyed it as well.  I followed the recipe as written.  I thought it would be too sweet but it was delicious.  Make sure you place a pan either under the pie or on the bottom of the oven as it cooks as it will boil over the edges - this is OK as it makes the crust slightly crunchy and more flavorful.

Absolutely amazing recipe, it was a huge hit at Thanksgiving! The one change I made was premixing the water & cornstarch together before adding it to the mixture. I also added an additional 1/2 tsp of cornstarch after mixing because it seemed a little too runny. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I made it as is. Great pie. It reminded me of my mom's pie (flavor and texture but different ingredients). The second time I decided to tweek it a little. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 as well as using half brown sugar. Added 1/4 teaspoon rum extract. Extra pecans. Perfect for my taste. Awesome easy recipe that is good as is but since everyone has different taste, 1 or 3 small changes can satisfy everyone.  Keeper!!

So I made this recipe and I took the advice of mixing cornstarch and water before adding it to the sugar mixture, but I had to bake my pie for 60 mins until it was set.

I'm keeping this one as my go to pecan pie recipe.  I highly recommend using brown sugar for the sugar and maple syrup for the corn syrup,  the maple flavour really comes through.

Made this for my father-in-law's 80th bday, as pecan pie is his fav!  He RAVED about it for days...said it was the best pecan pie he has ever had!  I did follow one reviewers advice of toasting the pecans on the stove for 6 mins...and I honestly think that's what made the difference!

I am not a cook nor a baker, but I am trying to learn. My boyfriend said his favorite pie was pecan pie so I used this recipe to make one. I think I did a really good job. Him and his sister said the flavors were there and it was good, my presentation as well as my crust lacked but that was my fault not the recipe. I have made it 2 times now and although I am working on presentation and the crust, I will always use this recipe for my pecan pies!

Delicious recipe!  I also followed another reviewer who mixed the corn starch into the water before adding to the sugar mixture, but no measurements or ingredients were altered.  YUM!

Absolutely the best pecan pie recipe that I have ever made.  The only thing I did different was to add the cornstarch to the water before adding it to the pot.Try it . . . you will LOVE it!

I had not made a pecan pie in a long while and this was as close as the one that my mother-in-law use to bake. It turned out great. It took a little longer to cook but it lasted longer and tasted great for three days. It is a keeper.

It turned out way too syrupy and gross. Giving it 3 stars though, because I'm hoping it was just my own fault.

I read the reviews. I find that this is usually a good idea. I placed whole pecans completely over the top. Then I painted them over with a tiny bit of the filling. The pie was gorgeaous and sooooo yummy. Everybody couldn't believe that I had made it without corn syrup. Incredible. It will be made for family gatherings regularly.

So far, this is my fav pecan pie recipe because it's so delicious and very easy. I use brown sugar and white corn syrup, but otherwise follow the recipe. Once I used a mix of walnuts and pecans because I didn't have enough pecans, and that was great too!

I've made this twice now. The second time I mixed the cornstarch and water together before adding it to the other ingredients. It came out perfect - much less liquidy.

Very good recipe. I personally prefer it sweeter than it actually comes out  so it surprises me that some here say it was TOO sweet. I ended up topping the pie with real maple syrup to get that sweetness that I'm used to. Next time Ill try increasing the quantity of corn syrup and see if that helps.

I've never had pecan pie so I have nothing to compare it to. In fact, I hate nuts! My boyfriend's favorite is pecan pie, so I made this for him. We both really liked it. I didn't find it too sweet at all. Just the right amount of sweetness. It was easy to make.

This recipe is super easy to follow and turns out amazing! I made it for both family thanksgivings and was asked to make it again for Christmas with how much everyone loved it. I also made it for my husbands work party and his boss told him he needed  me to make another for him! If that's not a good recipe then I don't know what is!

I took other reviewers suggestions and substituted brown for white sugar and real maple syrup for corn syrup.  I also mixed the cornstarch with the water before adding.  OMG It was so good.  Making it again tonight for a potluck!

I love the filing.  Perfect for my tastes.  The only reason I docked a star was because of the pie crust.  The recipe ingredients aren't specific enough about what kind of crust. I prefer refrigerated dough vs the permade pie crusts in the  foil pans. Wish it would have been more specific.

This was by far the best pecan pie I've ever made. Everybody loved it! The recipe really does need to be edited to say that the cornstarch and water need to be mixed together. I added a little less sugar (1 and 1/2 cups) and it still turned out amazing.

This pie turned out great! I did make a few changes because I didn't have dark corn syrup. I used 1c. of white, granulated sugar and 3/4c. of brown sugar and I used light corn syrup in place of the dark.

I love pecan pie. This was my first time making it and this one is great and easy!  I did follow the advice of some other reviewers and used brown sugar and light corn syrup, used 2 cups pecans (the whole bag), and of course mixed the corn starch and cold water together first (glad I read some reviews with that advice because I don't think I would have done it on my own).  The pecans do float to the top of the mixture so it ends up with pecans on top, not mixed all through (which is a good thing).  The only thing I would change is have a better crust (I used Pillsbury) but then I'd have to make it and it would add a lot of time.

Easy to make and just absolutely delicious! I used a frozen butter pie crust. Substituted the corn syrup with brown sugar.  Very sweet, but the pecans offset it.

This is one of the best pies ever but keep this at a note to yourself have your pie shell and eggs frothed ready before you start the filling cause the first time i made it my whole filling almost hardened cause i had nothing ready but that was on me not the recipe. So anyways BEST PIE EVER

I've been making this recipe for several years now, and it has never failed me. It's amazing without changing a thing. No matter what function or holiday get-together I attend, I am always begged to bring this, and it is the star of the show. Perfect!

Delicious! I used Demerara brown sugar instead of white to add more flavour and maple syrup instead of corn one. Not too sweet, perfect combination of everything! Will definitely make it again.

The taste was quite good, though a bit too sweet for me. It was my first time making pecan pie, so I set my timer for 45 mins, as I didn't want to over bake it. With almost 6 mins left on the timer, I could smell it and knew it was over baked. I would definitely try it again, but with a bit less sugar and only bake it for 30-35 mins.

Came out great! I didn't have dark corn syrup, so substituted light corn syrup and molasses. I also mixed the water and corn starch before hand, as suggested by others. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

The pecan pie recipe my family has made for years never really set well for me. I was tired of eating pecan "syrup" pie but I wanted something that tasted just as good. This one set perfectly and the flavor was even better. It was a huge hit. Everyone at thanksgiving agreed that it was better than the old family standard. Its the NEW family recipe.

This is the third year I've made this pie and it's always a hit. So, there's no doubt that this year will be any different. Great flavor and always a hit (even when I accidentally used graham cracker crust.) I always add a little extra pecans but this truly is a delicious recipe.

We followed the recipe exactly, but it came out as a liquid like water. The outside was cooked but right underneath was like all liquid. I reviewed everything we did and it was alright, but it didn't work out.

This was the first time I made pecan pie. It was easy and absolutely delicious. I brought it to an early Thanksgiving dinner last night and everyone loved it :) I'll be making this one again.

Awesome recipe! I have never made pecan pie and was abit nervous but this was easy to make And tasted incredible. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar because that is what I had on hand and it was a hit in our house!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently was I ground about a 3rd of the nuts to an almost powder. the fresh pecan flavor was evident in every bite and the top of the pie had an interesting thin crust made up of mostly a sweet nut glaze as a result of the ground nuts. Getting ready to make this again and not gonna change a thing, love it!

I've always tried to make Pecan Pie. It never seem to turn out right. I saw this, tried it and my family loves it. My husband is not a big fan of sweets so I used less the sugar and he loved it.

The pecan pie was outstanding. Only part I would tweak is just a little less time in the oven as it seemed to be a little over done. Otherwise it tasted absolutely outstanding.

I went to the store for a pecan pie and they were out! I had to make one, I came across this recipe, and it's a keeper! I have one in the oven right now! The first one was great! I added a pinch of ground cloves and cinnamon I the second one, just for fun. Yummy! Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe introduces very basic methods for creating this pie. I was surprised on how easy pecan pie was to make. I read suggestions from other reviewers on this recipe and tweaked a few things.
 First, I used brown sugar as opposed to white. I actually lessened the amount of sugar used. Light corn syrup was used instead. I also made a slurry with cornstarch and water before adding with the other ingredients to boil. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon which made it to die for. A slightly larger amount of pecans were used in the modified recipe.

The amount of filling was only half of what it should be for a 9inch pie. It's in the oven now, but it looks really weird. I'm making this for my boyfriend who loves pecan pie. I hope it tastes better than it looks.

I made the mistake of buying the store-brand pie crust which turned out to be the world's teeniest pie crust!  It was so flat that I almost thought it was a pizza crust!  I knew from previous pecan pie experience that the ingredients would be too much for the crust so I had to alter the recipe a bit.  I only used 1 cup of white sugar, added 1/4 cup brown sugar, used only two eggs and one cup of pecans.  The amount was perfect for the teeny crust and it turned out better than the pecan pie I used to make (couldn't find the recipe)!  I will make this again for Christmas!  I took a great picture, but I guess it's too small to post (the website must have changed the requirements because I have posted photos before from the same camera).

Got Kudos for this pie! Read other reviewer posts.. 1/4 less sugar and combined some brown in the mix. I added more pecans and combined chopped with whole. Very rich.

Great Recipe! Our family loves it every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas. We always double the recipe because it doesn't fill our pie pan enough.. (: But it is still always the best!

My first attempt at pecan pie I used this recipe. I found it simple and delicious. I also made a couple changes, instead of dark cornsyrup I used a mix of molasses and light corn syrup. I also changed 1 3/4 cup sugar to 1c white sugar 3/4c brown sugar. I changed the baking a bit as well to 400 degrees for about 8 mins then turned down the heat to 350 degrees till the pie was set enough. With my home made crust this pie was crisp yet gooey and sweet and buttery. I will use this recipe again in the future :)

This was okay, but I just do not care for corn syrup. It creates a funny taste in desserts that I find unpleasant. If you would like a pecan pie recipe that does not require corn syrup, (I know, I was skeptical too) then try Pecan Pie V from this site. It is incredibly delicious without the odd, cloyingly sweet taste of corn syrup.

Not quite the texture I was aiming for. Extremely easy to make though. I will use this recipe until I can find that "just right" recipe.

Very easy to make, and it takes great!  Cooked perfectly.  I added chocolate chips on the bottom to add a slightly chocolate flair, which is a great addition but not necessary.

I followed this recipe to the letter- it came out watery, couldn't eat it. I'm very upset!  I read in another review about mixing the cornstarch with the water and then adding it, well, I will try it one more time and if that doesn't work, I'm going to scream!!! Not all recipes call for cornstarch, so how does it set?  I need answers  thank you

Several of us loved this recipe, but my husband only liked it.  I loved the flavor, but maybe I overcooked the sugars because the inside was not the gelled texture we associate with pecan pie.  I also used a very dark brown sugar from some island country from my stock of interesting sugars, and I used maple syrup. Next time I may change the sugar-syrup ratio.  I also used a very large deep dish pie plate and will have to make more of the filling to better fill the crust.

This is a great pecan pie recipe - everyone around the table rated it 5 stars. Didn't have dark corn syrup so used light and it turned out great - nice caramelly flavor without being sickly sweet.  
I used the following sweet pastry recipe for the crust - easy and went really nicely with the filling:  In food processor, process 1 cup flour with 1 Tbsp sugar.  Add 6 Tbsp cold butter. Turn processor on/off six times. With machine on add 2-2 1/2 Tbsp cold water through feed tube, just until dough forms a ball.  Press into bottom and sides of pie plate.

I really enjoyed this. The filling set up and caramelized nicely. Just be careful to let the filling cool down a bit before adding it to the eggs otherwise you'll get scrambled eggs.

This recipe truly yealds the best pecan pie I've ever tasted. My only recommendation is to reduce the sugar a bit and to use a combination of white and brown sugar. I made two pies so I used 2C white and 1C brown total.  My husband is something of a pecan pie connoisseur, LOL, and when HE hands out five stars, it's gotta be amazing!!

Great Pecan Pie!!! I have made many and this is the best recipe I have found.  Sweet, and delicious.  I acutally didn't have enough dard corn syrup so I ended up using half dark and half light and it turned out awesome!

This is absolutely the best Pecan Pie recipe I have ever used. Didn't change a thing. I doubled the recipes and made 2 , 9 inch pies { not deep dish}. My husband loved it Thanks so much for posting this wonderful recipe.

I used this recipe over Thanksgiving bc I was out of town & didn't have access to my regular recipe. It was pretty good but I think I cooked it a little too long. I've made pecan pie multiple times and this one was different with the cooking of the sugar mixture. But it still tasted really good.

This recipe is amazing! It's much more of a caramel pecan pie, and soooo much less sweet and sickly rich than a lot of other pecan pies. I absolutely love it. It's going into my recipe box as a favorite to use every year, that's for sure!  I did alter things a bit and use brown sugar and light corn syrup. It turned out perfect!

Easy and Delicious.  45 minutes was too long and it looked a little burned on the edges, but it still tasted great.  Next time, I'll check on it earlier and take it out before it gets too dark.

I had a few problems with this recipe - first, there was too much filling, and I feared making a mess in my oven, so I had a lot left over (if I did it again, I'd use a deep dish.) More importantly, it wouldn't set, so I overcooked it. The crust is a bit too dark, and some of the pecans are slightly burned. The thing is so heavy, and the filling is thick and sludgy like muck. When I took a bite I actually couldn't get it off my teeth. I'm going back to my Caro syrup bottle recipe using light syrup. This is a recipe only a dentist could love.

Haven't tried this recipe yet, but wondering if one could substitute maple syrup for the dark corn syrup in this recipe without too much problem?  I have homemade maple syrup and thought it would give the pie a nice flavor but worry about the pie setting up.

GREAT PIE.  A very chewy pie, not just gooey from corn syrup.  I over baked it a little and it was rather firm to cut, but still great.  Not the traditional gooey bottom pecan pie, much better.

This is the best recipe ever!! I have been making this since I found the recipe last year and I have had lots of people asking me to make the pie. I guess some of the people that don't like the recipe don't know the difference about stoves. They are like microwaves, they all don't heat the same. I prefer to cook my pies in a gas stove but I have an electric stove now and I have to adjust the temp. on that stove. But my pies always comes out right. Thanks a lot. :-)

This has become my go to recipe.  I've served it to pecan pie connoisseurs and some who claim not to be pecan pie peole alike and have always gotten great reviews.  I pretty much follow the instructions but I'm a bit more liberal with the vanilla.  Thanks so much!

I made this for my father-in-law, who loves pecan pie. Everybody loved it, even my mother-in-law who usually doesn't like pecan pie. It was rich without being sickly sweet. Definately my new standard.

I made 2 pies for Thanksgiving and I'm glad I did since 1 would not have been enough! Even my 10 year old son, who doesn't like any kind of nuts, had 2 pieces! Thank you so much for putting this recipe on here!!! I will definitely be using it again!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone seemed to like it. I call myself going right by the recipe, but when I first got it out of the oven I was nervous as it looked dry (it didn't have that shine), so I melted butter and brushed the top of the pie with a pastry brush. The pie set very well. I had no complaints, and the pie dish was empty.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and they ate it all up!  It was very easy and had a wonderful brown-sugary taste.  I had issues with my oven, though...at 350 and after only 38 minutes the top of the pie had burnt but the inside had not set. (pie was on middle rack)....so be sure to check pie throughout baking.  I put the pie in the fridge to facilitate setting, but it hadn't baked long enough and never did set. Nevertheless it was devoured, runny and burnt as it was.  I will most definetly use this recipe again, as the taste was magnificent.

This was just an average pecan pie; it wasn't spectacular or anything. I doubt I'll make it again, but if I do, I would decrease the cooking time because the top of the pie seemed to hard.

This was really good.  I am experimenting with pecan pie recipes because my husband loves them, I have not found the perfect one yet, but so far this one is the best I have made.  I wish I had reduced cooking time slightly.

Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! This pie flew off the Christmas dinner table! This was actually my first time making and tasting pecan pie and it was delicious warm with vanilla ice cream on top. Yum! Will definitely make this again.

I am from Alabama and this is definitely one of the best southern version of a pecan I've made. Definitely a keeper!

This was the first Thanksgiving I have cooked.  Everyone wanted pecan pie, but I didn't have a recipe.  So, I found this one.  It was an absolute hit!  Everyone told me it was the best pecan pie they have ever had.  Not too shabby, considering it is the first pecan pie I have ever made.  It was so good and so easy to make.

Awesome! Exactly what I was looking for. Will be making for the holidays. Sprinkled some chocolate chips on top for an extra kick. Yum.
