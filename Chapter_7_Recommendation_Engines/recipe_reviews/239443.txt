Yes this one does take some time to prepare, and has a very unusual ingredient for ice cream with the acorn squash! Very gentle flavour, with a very smooth and luxurious feel to the final product.  I made it as in the original recipe, but did add a dusting of cinnamon, not only for looks but it did complement the final taste.  None of your guests will guess the main ingredient, so interesting to serve to guests.  For me this one should be paired with some crisp spicy cookies or a slice of apple pie...
