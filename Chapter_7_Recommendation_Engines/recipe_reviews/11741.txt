My family loves this. I can not keep poppy seeds or spaghetti in my house. Everyone that has tried it likes the unique taste. I only sprinkle poppy seeds on pasta tossed in butter.

Simple and easy.  I added less butter just because I am trying to diet!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very delicious...I altered the recipe by using artichoke tortellini. I had some roasted in oil cherry tomatoes that I wanted to use up so I added those too. I also had diced cooked chicken to use up so I added those as well. I reduced the poppy seeds to 2 teaspoons as 1/3 of a cup sounded like a lot. I added 3 tablespoons of grated cheese at the very end along with some of the pasta water and some parsely. This was better than any pasta meal I ever had in a restaurant. The best part is you can empty your fridge at the same time!~

I thought this was a nice change from traditional spaghetti and tomato sauce.  I actually used bowtie pasta so the poppy seeds would stick a little better.  I think next time I'll try adding some white sauce to give it a little bit of extra flavor and maybe a dash of lemon juice...

Good but not amazing. Added some fresh tomatoes. Hubby was not a fan. I can see why it's popular though!
