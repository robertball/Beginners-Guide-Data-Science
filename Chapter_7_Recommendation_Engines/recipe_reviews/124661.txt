Yum-o!  I love this kind of baked rice pudding.  I followed the recipe exactly with exception to adding about 1.5 tsp of pure vanilla extract right at the end and I added the raisins right at the start of the cook time.  Everyone in my family really liked it served with fresh whipped cream!  Next time I make it, I don't think I will bother stirring it every 15 minutes though...it would be just as good and less bother.  The only point worth mentioning is that when I took the pudding out of the oven after 1 hour, it was still pretty soupy so I was worried that it wouldn't set...but as it cooled it set perfectly.

This is one of the best ones I've tried. The cooking times were perfect, and it actually looks like pudding. I added some cinnamon, and it is absolutely wonderful.

All I can say is "Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe with us all." The first time I made this rice pudding the rice was a little undercooked and was still crunchy when I bit into it. But I have now perfected it and can make it with my eyes closed. I first found this recipe about 2 months ago. Now when I make it, the first thing I do is put some water in a pot and boil the half cup of rice for about 10 minutes so that it will become a little softer before I start baking and won't have the undercooked problem again. Besides pre boiling the rice the only other change I made was cut the raisins down to about a third of a cup. And I added the raisins to the saucepan with everything else so they could plump up. I didn't stir the rice pudding every 15 minutes either. I baked it for about 40 minutes and stirred it after about 20 minutes.I have made this recipe every night for the past 3 weeks.As soon as I get home from work I start the process and by the time the rice pudding has cooled down I put the casserole dish on my lap and don't stop eating until it is finished. I do believe I am addicted to Rice Pudding now. Simply delish.  :-)

My niece was having a birthday party for her two daughters and decided on a Greek theme. I volunteered to make rice pudding. I looked through all the rice pudding recipes and saw this one sounded the best. I didn't know how it would thicken with all the milk and a small amount of rice, but as I kept baking and stirring every 15 minutes, it thickened up nicely. It was a big success. I topped it with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon. My niece said it tasted like the rice pudding in her favorite Greek restaurant. Everyone wanted the recipe.

This was sooooo good. The smell of it cooking brought me right back to my childhood. I added cinnamon and nutmeg and 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of white. I will definitly be making this again!

Made this as directed, but ended up only having to cook for 45 mins total, as it started to become dry. Next time I'll add only a pinch of salt, since it seemed salty to me.

I made this recipe this evening and it was good at best but not great. I was looking for a recipe that was like the rice pudding my grandmother always made. This was close but not quiet there. I doubled the recipe and cooked all of the ingredients in a sauce pan before putting it into the oven. I cooked it for 50 minutes at 350 and stirred once after 20 minutes. The rice is still a tiny bit tender but it's edible. Hopefully it will taste better after it sits a little.

Made this twice now, once with milk and once with soy milk - both were delicious.  Easy and delicious.  Recipe is a keeper.  Thanks.

I just finished a large bowl of this...yummmm!  It is creamy, delicious, warm and comforting.  Just like mom used to make.  I didn't change a thing, except to add a little cinnamon when I added the vanilla and then again when I served it. (I love cinnamon).  Cooking times were perfect for me.  I can't wait to start on the leftovers!

I was SO happy to find a recipe just like my Nana's!  Pull out your dutch oven for this and be sure to bring your milk to a boil slowly.  That will ensure that your rice softens and the milk begins to reduce properly.  I also used brown sugar and just a dash of salt- perfection!  :D

Very good I also precooked the rice for 10 min. Also I soaked the Raisins in Bourbon before I added them.

I have never made rice pudding before I tried this recipe. I thought it was very good. It needed a little more milk added tword the end of cooking, or maybe even 15 minutes less in the oven.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I love that you don't have to use eggs in it, and that it is also very flexible with dietary restrictions.  I am lactose intolerant, so I wanted to write a review to let others know that I substituted vanilla flavored ALMOND milk (the kind by Almond Breeze) and it was delicious.  Similarly, I used Splenda in place of the sugar and enjoyed the taste very much. Mine was ready in 45 minutes rather than 60, and perhaps this was due to the almond milk, but either way, this was a huge hit. I am going to make more again tomorrow as this batch is already gone! Thanks for a great recipe Sandra!

Was really tasty but it took forever to cook- I used a small saucepan but next time I will use a large one for more surface cooking. I just had some and it is quite tasty and I had to use a lot of milk to keep it nice and creamy. Forgot to add vanilla but still tasted great!

This was so good!! This was my first time making AND eating rice pudding, and I think I'm addicted now. I think I made a rookie mistake though: at the hour mark my pudding was still SO soupy, so I thought it wasn't done and left it in for another 20 minutes, but by that point it wasn't too moist anymore. I saw someone said that you have to let it set after baking, so I'll be sure to do that next time. Also, I found that the raisins were delicious but almost too sweet! I think I'd be happy without the raisins and just using lots of spices, like cinnamon. Thank you for the great recipe!!

Simply put: THE BEST. It tastes exactly like the rice pudding I used to buy at the store (Kozy Shack rice pudding). I changed some things, though: as another reviewer said, I boiled the rice in some water for about 10 minutes, then I proceeded with the recipe. I was afraid that the rice wouldn't be cooked enough, and it turned out really good. I added almost 2 tsp of vanilla, and that really did the trick. However, I didn't add the raisins as I thought it was unnecessary. Soooo good. My whole family loved it. Thanks so much!

FAN TAS TIC!!! I doubled the recipe, used a mixture of evaporated milk, half and half, and 1%. Only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt for a double recipe. I didn't add the raisins or cinnamon because my family doesn't like them. Baked covered with foil for 1 hour, no stirring. (I bake rice pudding specifically so that I don't have to fuss with it, so why would I open the oven to stir it every 10 minutes??) After 1 hour I stirred it well, added vanilla and 5 egg yolks, covered again and baked for 30 more minutes. Turned out perfectly creamy, tender rice, incredible. I've been looking for a rice pudding recipe that starts with raw rice and is baked instead of cooked on the stove top, and this is it!

Something terrible went wrong here!  I don't know what I did wrong but I WAS NOT happy with this at all!!  I wasted my precious half and half...that really makes me mad.  The flavor was good...but the rice was NOT done. I should have taken the advice of others and parboiled the rice. DH thought it was good..I said "the rice is still hard"...he goes...UMM.  Oh boy...anyway I can see where this could be good. Perhaps I might give it another try.... Nah, I probably won't.

Awesome recipe.  It's really hard to believe there are no eggs in it--it tastes so custardy!  However it was just a tad dry, even though I cut the last 15 min down to 10.  Next time I'll cut it down to 5 minutes (and there WILL be a next time!).

This was very good. I needed to add a little more sugar to suit my taste, but it's better to start low and add more. My younger kids didn't like it (4-7), but they don't know any better, and my oldest (11) thought it was great.

Awesome recipe! I made a few changes, though. I used a vanilla flavored non-dairy beverage similair to soy milk, and added 1/2 tsp almond extract. I also made it in a make-shift double boiler. I put a smaller pot into a larger pot, filled the larger 1/3 of the way up, and let it boil the entire hour or so that the rice pudding cooked in the smaller one. I still checked and stirred every 15 minutes, but this way i didn't have to bend down to grab the dish out of the oven. a bit more convenient with a three year old running a muck!!! Thanks again!!

Made this a for a potluck dinner as a dessert, as one of the guests is allergic to gluten and this was one of the few dessert recipes I could find that was gluten-free, and that I had all the ingredients for. It was good; I may have baked it for too long as it came out very thick. Also may decrease the amount of sugar as it was sweet for my tastes. The pudding was well received by the people at the potluck though.

This is the perfect rice pudding- everything it should be and the only way I know it. Came out thick (once out of the oven), creamy and not too sweet. Topped with cinnamon. :)

This was yummy, but a tad too sweet for my taste. The pudding didn't quite set up as much as I would have liked it to, but this is still a great recipe!

Excellent!  My only problem was that it boiled over into the oven and made a super mess. Make sure your baking dish is big enough!

I'm eating this right now (after making it for the first time), and it is delicious!!!  I made it as-written and it turned out wonderfully.  I used half skim milk and half 2%, and just under 1/2 cup of raisins (because that's all I had).  I wasn't sure what pan size to bake it in, but what I picked (a glass 8x8 pan) was perfect.  I chose to mix the cinnamon throughout rather than just sprinkle it on top.  It is wonderful!  I like that it uses ingredients I always have on-hand.  I'm eating it warm, but I'm sure it would also taste good cold.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is an easy, fantastic recipe. I had some leftover coconut milk and I mixed it with water and used it for the milk in the recipe. It was pure creamy goodness! One of the other reviewers mentioned making it with soymilk, I'm looking forward to trying that too. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This tasted like the rice pudding I remember.  It was a tad dry but maybe that was because I used pudding rice instead of long grain rice.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because my british husband wouldn't even taste it.  It's not a proper, english, traditional rice pudding according to him!

I wish I could give 10 stars! I follow this recipe exactly and it always turns out amazing! It really is reminiscent of the rice pudding that my Lebanese side used to make when i was a kid, which is what i've been searching for! Sometimes I add raisins, but I like it just plain! What a wonderful rice pudding, exactly as it should be! You will not be disappointed by trying this one. Thank you Sandra for the excellent recipe!! PS I usually use whole milk, but I've made it with 2% and it is just as good!

I recalculated the recipe to 8 servings but forgot to adjust the pan size.Turned out fine next time i'll remember to adjust pan size. So I won't have to clean up spilled milk.

This was great rice pudding!  My grandma baked her rice pudding so when in search of one I wanted one that was not just cooked on stove top and this is a great starting place!  As is it is great, I let it cool for 40 minutes and it was still warm when I ate some...sooo good.  I will try a shorter grain rice next time (for a creamier consistancy) but this is great!

I followed this recipe exactly as written. I liked the taste of it (that's the 3 stars). I liked the consistency when I took it out of the oven, but after being refridgerated it was very thick. I'm surprised so many people are saying this is creamy. It did have a nice flavor.

I just made this recipe this morning and it is so good.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I added some cinnamon on top at the end.  It is fantastic.  I highly recommend you try this.  It did bubble over a bit so next time I will put it in a bigger dish.  Very, very good.

Yum! Tastes very much like Kozy Shack except not quite as sweet and with a more authentic vanilla flavor. I don't know why some people boiled the rice before beginning the recipe as written. My rice was perfectly done in 45 minutes, so feel free to skip this superfluous suggestion. As others have stated, there's no need to stir every 15 minutes. I just stirred once halfway through baking time and it came out just fine. Next time, I might add a bit more sugar to make it a touch sweeter.

I thought this was very good. Will make again.  The only thing I did different because I had to was subbing dried sour cherries and almond extract for the raisins and vanilla. Came out even better tasting than the typical raisins/vanilla. Will make it that way from now on. Thanks. I am looking forward to enjoying this all on my own. No hubby.

FANTASTIC: NOTE: Increased oven time by 75 degrees due to elevation, I think. It came out brown and bubbly. Perfect. No raisens. Not a fan. Perfect with a dash of cinnamon. A must share on FB!

I made this last night and it is really good fresh out of the oven!  I didn't have to bake it for 45 minutes though because it would have been too dry so I only baked it for 30 minutes.  Its good the day after also but you need to heat it a bit and pour milk on it.

I omitted the salt and raisins, as I didn't feel it would need the salt and didn't have any raisins on hand.  Overall a good pudding, The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is b/c I've had better...but this is a pretty simple, easy, still tasty way to make it.

This was delicious. I used half vanilla soy milk and half 2% milk. My experience with the cooking time was that it was 15 minutes too long. It looked perfect at 45 minutes when I checked on it, but I wanted to follow the directions the first time making it. It was overdone at 1 hour, looked like a side of rice not rice pudding, I had to add some milk to revive it. After that, it was great. I won't be adding the full amount of raisins next time as the 1/2 cup plumped up and overwhelmed the pudding. I might skip them entirely or stick to a scant 1/4 cup. Otherwise, I loved it. Thanks.

I went exactly by the recipe and this came out like rice soup.  And the raisins, well there seemed to be almost just as many raisins and rice.  1/2 c. was way to much by the time they plumped back up.  I was wanting a thicker rice pudding.  Not a runny bowl of warm milk and tons of raisins.  I won't be making this recipe again.  It smells good though. lol

Loved, Loved Loved this!  I used evaporated milk, b/c my milk had gone bad, but it would be fine either way. I also simmered the rice mixture with the vanilla by accident.  Oh well, it was absolutely wonderful!

This is my favourite "go to" recipe for rice pudding. Creamy, smooth with a hint of sweetness.  Make it almost 1x/week.

I must have done something wrong. My pudding was watery and and the rice was hard. I live in Reno, which is about a 4,800 ft elevation. Maybe I should have altered the degree of my oven.

This was very GOOD!!! I used craisins because I was out raisins.  The next time I make this I will only use 1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract, it just seemed to be too much vanilla for my taste. Thanks.

Just like my Grammie makes!  I cooked the rice very slowly in an enameled cast iron pot; stirred constantly for over 20 minutes before it came to a boil.  Then put the whole pot right into the oven rather than using a casserole dish.  An hour later it came out delicious.

Delicious as is, but to make an even creamier/soft pudding, I use 1/4c rice with 4c milk.  It might take longer than an hour (I also cook at 275-300 degrees), but all the liquid does absorb and its less "ricey" and more pudding like.  To make it easier, I put everything in the microwave until its hot, instead of heating on the stovetop.  Overall my favorite comfort food on a cold day!

I did not care for this! Followed the recipe exactly and it was rice soup. I even waited a while to see if it would set but there was WAY too much milk for that. I ended up putting it back on the stove after it had cooled, and put a thickener in...it was still soupy. I also didn't even put the full amount of vanilla in, and it was far too much for my liking. Am going to stick to my stovetop recipe.

Very tasty, but my pudding seemed to get dry the longer it sat.  It didn't have the pudding consistency anymore by day 2 : (    I will keep the recipe, maybe just add some more liquid?

I've never even eaten rice pudding before making this recipe, so I'm not sure how it's "supposed" to be, but I'm loving the stuff this recipe made! Since I can't eat dairy I used rice milk in place of cow's milk, and jasmine rice. It came out creamy and delicious. I have also recently given up oatmeal and I think I may eat the leftovers for breakfast in its place!

This rice pudding has an excellent flavor, but still isn't quite what I am looking for. My mother's rice pudding was baked, but did not set up so solid, it had a creamy, pudding to go along with the rice. I was hoping this would also. It was perfect when I took it out of the oven, but as it cooled it set up into a stand alone mass. Guess I will keep looking. This was very tasty, though. Wish I could figure out how to make it creamier.

Regarding Brown Rice.. I followed the directions exactly, except I tried to use brown rice (which usually doesn't make a difference in other rice puddings)... I am guessing that was the problem. Do not use brown rice... it does not cook and only started to get soft after *3*, yes 3, hours in the oven. The milk kept drying up so I was adding water to it just to keep it somewhat moist. So sad because I really wanted to love it!

An excellent rice pudding, I don't remember Granny baking hers, but this one is delish. It is creamy and the perfect consistency. I don't care for raisins, so I left those out. I also used a can of evaporated milk, I think that's what gave it it's wonderful richness. Try it! It turns out to be about half evaporated and half regular. I doubled the vanilla, and used a high-quality vanilla. I did garnish with a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg. Next time I will try just baking it, and not stirring it every 15. Had a couple bites for breakfast, yum!

Excellent!!  I decided to use organic brown rice and since I had about 2/3 cup of evaporated 2% milk to use up, I subbed that amount in along with 1% milk.  I also added cinnamon since I love it so!!  I did find that it needed quite a bit longer to cook (a good 20 mins at least) since it was still quite runny after the suggestged cook time...although that may have been a result of the brown rice.  Regardless, great flavour - hubby and I both enjoyed!
