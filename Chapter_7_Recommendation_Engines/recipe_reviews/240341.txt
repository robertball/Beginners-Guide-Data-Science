These were good but didn't have much sweetness to them and they didn't turn out puffy/fluffy like I was looking for. Lemon flavor was nice though. I thought I had pine nuts but I didn't, so I used almonds and that worked out just fine. Not sure if I'll make these again; I'll have to eat more of then to decide ;)
