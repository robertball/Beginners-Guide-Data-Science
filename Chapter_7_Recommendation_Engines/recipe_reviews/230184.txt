Wonderful sandwich that's quick, easy and delicious! I didn't have pesto on hand so I brushed it with a little garlic infused olive oil. I did add some roasted red peppers, proscuitto and fresh spinach (after it was out of the oven). I served it with balsamic vinegar mixed with a little olive oil and red pepper flakes for dipping. Excellent without a ton of effort!

Just used sub sandwich-type rolls from the grocery store bakery. Put them under the broiler for a minute to crisp them up, then followed the directions. Delicious!

Easy tasty dinner idea. My boyfriend and I made this used regular hoagie rolls, put some basil infused olive oil on it, toasted it and followed the recipe from there. We also added a few slices of red onion as well and it was delicious! I would definitely make this again.

So good!  I used torta sandwich bread instead of mini baguettes and it came out AMAZING.  It tasted a lot like margherita pizza.

I used fresh French bread, but other than that followed the recipe. It was delicious! I'll definitely be making it again.

After having a similar sandwich at Starbuckâ€™s, my husband requested I find a recipe. This one was perfect! I used onion rolls from bakery (sliced then toasted) before following the recipe exactly. Served with tomato soup. Easy, quick and delicious.

Another way to use some of the excess basil from a small plant (that's thriving) that I recently purchased. I used French bread and garlic olive oil in place of the pesto. My tomatoes were not Roma,  so they didn't hold up great. Still, it was a good, light supper dish.

I made this according to the recipe. It was good, but a bit dry. I sprinkled some virgin olive oil on it and it was delicious! I'll be making this again!

Big hit at a recent BBQ. I made these on slider buns and threw then on the BBQ for 6 minutes.... Turned around and they were gone!!
