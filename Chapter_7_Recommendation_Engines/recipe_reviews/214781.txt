We LOVE this recipe. I don't even like turnips or parsnips but my husband does. So we decided to try it and the only thing we did different is used honey instead of sugar. Came out perfect and very tasty too! Yummy!

The liquid never really turned into a glaze. I took liberties with the veggies that I used... could it really be because I didn't use potatoes it didn't thicken due to the lack of starch? I don't know, but it wasn't a success.

yummy, I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg and used acorn squash instead of carrots.

This was fantastic. I didn't have most of the veggies, so I used turnips and yellow potatoes. I love the easy, fast, and healthy meal.

This was okay. The glaze was not thick enough and did not dd much flavor.
