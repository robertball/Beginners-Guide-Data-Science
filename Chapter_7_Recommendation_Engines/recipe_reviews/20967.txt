This is very similar to a recipe my family has been using since before I was born! Use a tsp instead of a tbsp of baking soda, omit the cream of tarter, and replace the shortening with butter, and you will have the most delicious and dreamy sugar cookie ever!

As a fan of soft cookies, I thought these were really good.  If you leave them in the oven too long, they will be hard -- pull them out too early and they fall apart.  You can tell the cookies are just done enough when the tops no longer glisten.

this recipe is excellent, these were the best sugar cookies i have ever made. i didn't have buttermilk, so i used 1 Tbsp vinegar and 1 cup milk instead, and they were still so very chewey and tasty! I recommend this to everyone.

These have been my favorite cookies since I was a little girl. So light and not too sweet. My recipe calls for 4 cups of flour and the batter is perfect. I also just use milk soured with 1 Tblsp or lemon juice instead of the buttermilk. We like to use red or green sugar for the sprinkles on top at Christmas, red for valentines day, green for St Patty's day, and orange for halloween. These are the cookies of choice for my three kids and husband. The absolute BEST coffee cookie!

These cookies are tasty but not wonderful. I would recommend halving the recipe. It was like the never ending bowl of batter. I must have already made 60 cookies and then just dumped the remainder of the batter into a brownie pan for pan cookies. The recipe said it made 30 cookies but they must have been the size of pie plates in that case. I was also worried about how runny the batter was but it did turn out fine, the batter doesn't spread much. Good but not great in my opinion.

This reminds me of my grandmother's soft sugar cookies but a little dfferent.  If you are expecting  sweet sugar cookie, this is NOT the one for you. But it is the kind that I like best!  I added a 1/2 c more flour and chilled for one hour.

These are awesome, they never last long even though the recipe makes about 3 dozen cookies. I make them about 3 times a month, I made the mistake of making them with butter one time and they flattened out like a pancake when they baked.

A really nice soft cake-like cookie. I really like my cookies this way. They are easy to make. And have a mild flavor and not overly sugary. If you are a dunker these are not for you! I have made these several time but didn't get around to review the recipe.

Sugar Cake Cookies were something my Great Grandmother use to make for us kids, growing up in Indiana. As with most folks born prior to 1900, they cooked with good ole shortening, real butter and natural ingredients. Food tasted better too.  
I had longed to enjoy the tastes of childhood memories, but had lost the recipe of this favorite sugar cookie. By chance I was browsing the cookie recipes here and found this Amish Sugar Cake recipe. Turns out, this was almost exactly her old recipe. Almost, being she use plain ole Crisco shortening. This was before flavored shortenings. She lived to be 103.

This recipe was AWESOME. I used parchment paper rather than greasing the baking sheet and extended the cooking time to 15 min, because the cookies are larger. I also sprinkled them with Natural Turbinado Sugar. Be prepared to make 2 batches, because they go fast.

These cookies are just ok.  But having been born and raised in Amish country I can assure you that they are NOT real Amish sugar cakes.  They came out way too flat and aren't dense like the authentic version.  I even tried putting the dough in the fridge for awhile but that didn't help at all.

These cookies were easy and delicious. The batter is more like cake batter and I did add more flour as sugggested by other reviewers. They turn out simple and not too sweet. As such, they are addictive!!

This recipe is fabulous! The result is a soft cookie that remind me of those I use to get at the amish market when I was a kid. The only step I added was to drop the scoops of batter into granulated sugar and give them a light toss before baking. This gives the cookie a light, sugary crust. This cookie will make a regular appearance in our home.

Not a fan.  First, DO NOT use a Silpat, use the greased cookie sheetand REGREASE every time (I even have no stick NEWer cookie sheets!).  Second don't make them too big because if you can't get your spatula under it it will stick to the pan.  These don't have much flavor and they are so light and airy that they fall apart way too easily. I was actually looking for a cookie without a lot of flavor (I have a plain kid) but these are disappointing, and I am kinda annoyed I wasted my cup of buttermilk and 2 cups of sugar on them.

I was so looking forward to trying this recipe, but was disappointed in the results. The cookies stuck on every baking service I tried. The recipe said to cook up to 13 minutes, but the cookies were still doughy. And, finally the taste, although satisfactory, was not good enough to warrant all the time and effort.

If you love SOFT cookies, you'll love these.  Easy recipe.  These are the closest I have ever been able to recreate the soft sugar cookies you buy at gas stations and grocery stores.  These are great.  No hard edges!

I was a little dissapointed.  I was looking for a sugar cookie recipie and this one had the best reviews.  These cookies are more cake like than anything.  They don't taste like cookies at all.  This would be a good recipie for just a plain cake.

This a really excellent cookie.  Easy, all the ingrediets are basic, you don't have to run to the store.  Excellent flavor.  They stay soft. If you under bake them a little they are chewy.

This recipe needs definite tweaking. As others have mentioned, it absolutely NEEDS more FLOUR. There is no way in the world that these cookies will have any kind of thickness whatsoever, or even fully cook, if you do not add more flour. 

I have made a lot of recipes on this site, and some have turned out no so great, but this is the first time that I ever reviewed one. This recipe has me so ticked off because I wasted so many ingredients. I tried it twice, and the second time i used all brand new ingredients in case the problem was freshness. 

The good thing that came out of this failure was that I could use it as a starter recipe and tweak it and mark down what I did and have my own recipe. 

No matter what though, you HAVE TO ADD MORE FLOUR. At least half a cup more to start. If the batter is not thick enough to retain its shape when you plop it on the cookie sheet, then it will not cook up properly. It shouldnt be stiff enough to be able to roll into a ball without your hands getting sticky,, but it should be able to hold its shape. 

I ended up adding about 3/4-1 cup more flour, 1/4tsp more baking powder. 2.5 tsp more vanilla, 1/4 tsp almond extract. You wont taste almond in the cookies - it just helps bring out the vanilla flavor and hide the flour taste. The reason for adding so much additional vanilla is that as the recipe is written, it barely has any flavor at all. I dont mind subtle or rather bland sugar cookies, but this was bad.

These are the real McCoy.  If you follow this recipe as given you can't fail.  My version is only 3 1/2 cups of flour.  One cup of salted butter instead of flavored shortening. Only two eggs.  Increase vanilla to a tablespoon.  Only a teaspoon of baking powder. Omit cream of tartar. Increase salt to a teaspoon. Other ingredients remain the same except I sprinkle with sugar in the raw and bake on parchment paper at 375 F  for 7 to 10 minutes.  This recipe or mine, you can't fail if you follow the instructions.  It is simple to make your own colored sugar, put 1/2 cup of sugar in the raw in a sandwich bag and add one or two drops of food coloring and shake.  Much cheaper then store bought.

made this many times. This is not usual cut out cookies. Butter is more runny, but wait till you bake them we can't stop eating them. very delicious, soft and puffy. and yes that butter recipe makes a lot of cookies... is that a bad thing :-)

These taste amazingly like my grandmother's sour cream cut-out cookies.  They were a huge hit as gifts at Christmas.

Worst sugar cookies/cakes ever. They baked out flat like pancakes. They fell apart. I followed the recipe exactly and this is awful. Was not worth the time, the expense and anticipation.

These cookies were very nice.  Stay soft. Cake like inside.  I put icing on them.   Brushed on while still warm.  Brown sugar, butter, milk, icing sugar.  Turned out nice, icing hardened gave the cookies a "nice touch"

Best sugar cake cookie that I've found thus far.  By the last batch in the oven, I made the cookies by 1st liberally sprinkling sugar on the cookie sheet, using about two large tablespoons of dough per cookie and smoothing the tops because they stayed the shaped they dropped as during cooking.

Best soft sugar cookie I have ever tasted!!  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written except I used my Pampered Chef cookie sheet and parchment paper. The dough is soft after it is made, but forms into a  somewhat cake like cookie after it is baked. Nice and puffy and not overly sweet...the perfect soft cookie. I also sprinkled colored sugar crystals  on top of them before baking. I cooked them for 11 minutes, just before the edges turned brown. This is going to be my new sugar cookie recipe for the holidays and year round.

This is the only baked good that my daughter will eat. We make some every year for Santa Claus. It almost reminds me of a vanilla version of a traditional whoopie pie cake.

Be careful not to grease baking sheets too much and do NOT use cooking spray. It makes the batter ooze out into brown-edged, thinner cookies instead of nice cake-y cookies.I followed another user's suggestion to use butter instead of butter-flavored Crisco and to reduce 1 T of baking powder to 1 tsp. I reduced the cream of tartar to 1/2 tsp. I also refrigerated the dough for a half-hour or so before baking. The flavor and consistency of these are just what I was looking for. Delicious!

These taste soooo good! Buttery, sweet and the consistency resembled corn muffins .  The recipe was easy to make.  Next time I will measure my dough, my scoops are inconsistent.

Wow, this is the same recipe that I got many years ago when I hosted a Tupperware Party.  The Rep back then always had a recipe or two to share.  Made this for my two teenage Daughters and their friends while they sat around the dining room table talking about everything under the sun!  These girls are now Grandmothers.  This makes fabulous caramel corn and it won't last long!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe, I will make several copies so as not to lose it again!  lol

The flavor was quite plain. Maybe more vanilla? The batter (which I always think is a good indication of how a cookie will turn out) had a soda-y flavor. Maybe less? Also, I thought that 1 cup of buttermilk was too much. It was very sticky at just 3/4 cup. I put chocolate shavings in the batter, but the cookie flavor was only so-so. I will not use this recipe again.

Ok...These were not so good. Maybe I did something wrong along the way somehow. The batter was SO good, so I expected really good cookies, the flavor however was lacking. Even with icing. Probably won't make again.

These are not the sugar cakes I remember as a child.  They came out flat like pancakes.  I didn't taste any yet. The kind I made before were just like in the store they were thick and soft and great to dip in coffee. Was this recipe ever tested?  OK I tasted one bite.  The flavor is the same. Something must be missing from the ingredients.
