Oh my gosh, this was soooooo good.  Just so everyone knows, I had an 7 lb. ham, put in in the crockpot with a can of coke on the bottom and finished the top with a can of crushe pineapple.  I set it on low before I went to bed and woke up to a yummy aroma.  When I tried to pick it up to slice it, the fork literally made the ham fall apart like nothing I had ever seen.  I called 3 people because it is amazing and so, so, easy.  Thank you Suzanne!!!

Excellent!  My first ham!  I took the advice of several reviewers and marinated the ham overnight in 1/2 liter of Pepsi in a turkey baking bag that was tightly sealed.  Sealing the bag air tight is tricky which is why I used so much Pepsi!  I did turn the bag several times during the process to get everyting covered.  I then drained the Pepsi and covered the ham in liberal amounts of brown sugar, re-tied up the bag, cut in a few slits and baked according to the directions for the turkey bag (it comes with ham directions and a cooking guide per pound of ham).  The ham was moist and delicous!  You could definitely tell there was a sweetness in the ham and the house smelled terrific during the cooking time.  Be sure to let your ham rest in the bag for at least 15 minutes to re-absorb some of those juices.  After carving, I saved the juices (skimed the fat) and the ham bone to re-use in the Allrecipes.com "Bean & Ham Soup II" later on.  It will keep nicely in the freezer until I'm ready to have ham again.  My 12 year old son was thrilled with the result.  Ham is his favorite meat and we've been eating my mother-in-laws ham every holiday for 10 years so I was very flattered - this being my first time and all.  ALSO - Remove the skin from your ham if you plan on using the brown sugar - very important!!!!!  Bon apitite!

I have been making this for years. I only make a few changes. I put the ham in the oven bag the night before and add the coca cola (put in the fridge). It gives it a chance to soak. then before placing it in the oven, I rub brown sugar on the ham, seal the bag, poke some holes and bake. If your ham is small enough, this is GREAT in a crock pot too!

I'v made this recipie 3 times and each time i'v added alittle something to it, but this past easter was the best. I trimed the fat, added the cola, rubbed with brown sugar, added pineapple slices and cherries, then tied the bag and held tight using tooth picks. The ham came out of the oven so juicy and tender i almost didn't need to cut it. Everyone loves this recipe!

My father-in-law said it was the best ham he's ever had.  Only made one minor change; mixed a cup(ish) of brown sugar with a little ground cloves and packed it on top of the ham.  Everyone was surprised by the addition of cola.  It's a keeper.

This was super easy. I started out with a 8 pound ham and by the time I got done trimming the fat it was a 6 pounder. So the time had to be adjusted to about 2 hours and 45 minutes. I did not use a pre cooked ham so for the last 30 minutes I just increased the temp to 300. As others suggested the ham was given a good rub down with a couple handfuls of brown sugar. I still used the 1/2 can of soda too. Just be sure to take out as much air from the oven bag as possible before sealing (the top of the bag was punctured a few times with a fork) so the soda is able to surround the ham, not sit at the bottom of the bag. This recipie was very easy and tasty. My family will be eating this again. Thanks Suzanne.

I give this recipe 4 stars because the gist of the recipe is PHENOMENAL! My mom has been cooking holiday ham like this since before I can remember. I would definitely rate her holiday ham 5 stars! There are some major differences in the two recipes, however. My mom always used spiral sliced ham, for one. Also, instead of putting it in a turkey bag, she just put it in a deep metal baking dish (the ones commonly found during the holidays) and covered it with aluminum foil. Here are the two biggest differences, though, that I feel change the outcome drastically: she uses 1 can (HAS to be a can) of coca cola (pours half of the can over the ham before baking, and pours the last half on an hour before taking out of the oven) and she never trims the fat!! She simply cooks the ham fat-side up. Makes the ham unbelievably tender! If you're worried about health, serve it with steamed veggies or only trim half of the fat. Trust me, it's worth it!
One more thing...She always cooked it for about 12 hours. Great for cooking overnight and waking up to that wonderful smell on Thanksgiving morning!
Hope someone found this helpful!

I was really disappointed with the way this ham turned out. Like another reviewer, the coke just sat at the bottom of the bag & since the recipe directed me to poke holes in the bag, there was no way to turn the ham over to ensure full coverage basting. I obviously did something wrong as other reviewers found this recipe superb. I am not sure where my error came in. I used a roasting bag & followed the directions to the T. It also might have been helpful for the poster of the recipe to mention what TYPE of ham to use. I am a novice cook (just trying to get some good meals together for myself & my boyfriend) & picked up a canned ham not a cut of shoulder, etc. YUCK! I was EMBARASSED to serve this. We ended up chucking it & having sandwiches for dinner. Anyway, regardless of the ham, the recipe did not work for me at all.

This was by far the WORST ham I have ever tasted. We followed the directions to a T, and it was sticky and mushy in texture. The cooking time is far too long for a pre-cooked ham.  DO NOT USE SPIRAL SLICED HAM WITH THIS RECIPE!!!

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars, only because it was easy! Tasted like any other ham, The coke sat in the bottom of the roasting bag, poked holes in it as said. Therefore you can't turn over. I even rubbed it down with brown sugar as others suggested in recipe. Basic hot ham is what this is. Looking for something in a hurry, this will do.

Like others, I have been fixing my hams this way for years. I usually just buy a boneless ham for the two of us. I think some had the impression that the Coke would change the flavor of the ham entirely.  It doesn't. It ensures a beautifully cooked, very moist ham, with maybe a little sweetness. For a little more zest, I place the ham in the bag, pour the Coke in the bottom of the bag, then rub yellow mustard all over the top and sides of ham, pack on  brown sugar, anchor some pineapple rings to the top, then pour some of the pineapple juice in with the Coke. You can also use 7-Up or Dr. Pepper instead of the Coke.

I have been using this recipe for years. I get requests for this at any holiday get-together. It's so simple and quick. I have been reading some of the reviews, and I have to say: Do not use a "canned" ham. Do not use an uncooked ham. Do not use a spiral cut ham. Do follow the directions, and you will get what's in the picture.  I will be using this recipe 3 more times this year. YUM

The only ingredients I had on hand were cola, brown sugar and pineapple. So here is my version. Marinate ham(8lbs) in cola overnite in oven bag but do not poke holes in bag until ready to bake. Turn bag a few times throughout the process to insure "even-ness". Drain cola(since it's used only to tenderize) and add pineapple with juice and rub brown sugar on ham. I only added 1/2 the sugar. Delicious!!! This was the best Easter ham ever....

This was my first attempt at ham that I made for my entire family for Easter. It was absolutely delicious and the best ham I have tasted. I added/changed a few things based upon other reviews. I used a 9.5lb shank that I marinated in coke for 6 hours. Put the ham in a roasting pan, poured coke over top to fill the bottom of the pan. Rubbed the ham with brown sugar and then poured a can of crushed pineapple on top. Covered tightly with foil and cooked at 325 for 4 hours, basting every 30 minutes or so. It was so tender and juicy. Will definitely do again and again. Using leftover ham for potato, ham, and egg bake....

I made this recipe in a crock pot like one of the other reviewers recommended, and it was INCREDIBLY easy and everyone RAVED that it was the most tender, delicious ham they ever had.  I do not even really like ham, but had to try some after everyone's comments, and I have to say I agree; it was awesome!  I poured 1 can of coke into the crock pot, added a boneless, fully cooked 8 lb Berks ham, and topped with a can of crushed pineapple.  I put it on low in the crock pot for 10 hours and that was it.  Easy & delicious!  Using coke with ham seemed odd, but a  relative that went to Chef School later told me that Coke is an excellent meat tenderizer.

BETTER THAN A HONEY BAKED HAM! BEST HAM I HAVE EVER TASTED! AND SO SIMPLE!

I didn't make this myself, but I just had this for Thanksgiving dinner at my sis-in-law's house. I couldn't believe my ears when she told me she made the ham with JUST ham and coca-cola? That's it?!

Let me say though, IT WAS DELECTIBLE!! DELICIOUS!! And JUICY with a nice light sweet glaze on the outside. She even ended up packing us up a medium sized container to take home with us. Trust me when I say, it didn't even make it to our house (less than 30 miles away). I am definately going to make this for Christmas this year, only because I'm craving it again already. I LOVE THIS RECIPE. Everyone should give it a try! You will love it for the flavor and simplicity!

This recipe made a 6 1/2 pound, partially cooked, bone-in ham turn out very moist and tender.  Cleanup is so easy with an oven bag!  For baked ham, I like to use a probe thermometer.  The internal temperature should be 140 degrees. I started the oven at 275 degrees but periodically lowered the temperature until it was below 200 degrees and baked the ham for 4 hours. If your ham is less than 10 pounds, 4-5 hours at 275 degrees is too long.  You will either need to reduce the oven temperature or the time.

In summary, remember that recipe scaling does not change baking time.  I highly recommend using a probe thermometer.

Although I love ham, this was the first time I had ever made one and I was quite nervous. ( a newlywed) I used a 7 lb Cured ham (Bone in), I put it in an oven bag and dumped a 2 litre bottle of coke over it, so that is was completely covered. I let it marinate in the bag  over night in the fridge. When I was ready to cook it, I drained off all of the coke, except for approx 1 can, which sat at the bottom of the oven bag. I covered the ham with a spicy dijon mustard and placed fresh pineapple slices and pieces over the top, secured with toothpicks. I then sealed the bag with the tie provided and cooked it in a 350 degree oven for approx. 2 and 1/2 hours. It didn't need basting at all. I had the meat thermometre stuck through the bag, so I could watch it closely. It was the most delicious ham ever (even with the dijon, which I normally don't like) My husband raved it was the best ham he ever had. Will make this my staple ham recipe. Thankyou so much.

I had my first family Thanksgiving with my in-laws this past weekend.  When I realized that more people were coming than expected, I decided to make a ham in addition to the turkey because I was worried the turkey was too small.  I've never cooked a ham before so I came here looking for a recipe.  This was awesome!  I used a 10 lb ham shank and it turned out really tender with good flavour.  I had a hard time keeping my husband away from it (I cooked it the night before the big day).  I followed the advice in previous reviews and let it marinate overnight in a full can of pop and then rubbed brown sugar all over it before baking.  Yum!  Will definately make again.  Thanks Suzanne.

Outstanding! I used Coke Zero and also let  it marinate overnight.  Then I patted on a cup of brown sugar.  I cooked an 8 lb. ham for 5 hours at 225. I took it out about half hour before I served it and let it rest in the bag.  It was moist and tender.  Before serving I ran the pieces through the juices in the bag.  I will use this as  my main ham recipe from now on!

We really liked this.  The cola only tenderizes and moisturizes, don't expect your ham to taste like cola.  It will, however, be tender and juicy and great for using leftovers in other recipes.  I did this in slowcooker and it was perfect.

I've made this recipe twice now and both times it was excellent.  I used a spiral sliced half ham and soaked it cut side down overnight with a full can of Coke (in a bag in the fridge of course).  Right before cooking I put some brown sugar on the outside (probably not needed at all) and put it in the oven for a little less than 1.5 hours at 325 degrees (it was an 8.5 lb ham).  The ham was so tasty and tender.  It just melted in my mouth.

I made this ham for my fiance's family during the holidays and it was a big hit!  I only made a couple minor changes (as noted in other comments).  I marinated the ham in coke overnight - rotating a few times to make sure all sides were covered.  When I was ready to cook the ham, I placed it in a new oven bag, poured a new can of coke over it, and then rubbed it with brown sugar.  Baked for 20 minutes per pound and it came out perfectly!  Everyone loved it!

This was my first ham and my husband was skeptical about the recipe because he loves ham and wanted it to be good. To his surprise the ham was the best. I did not use the bag to cook it in I just put the ham in a bowl with the coke overnight and put it all in a roasting pan covered. I basted the coke over it and then I turned the temperature up at the end to 400 degrees for about 15-20 minutes. This recipe is easy and delicious.

I liked the idea. Turns out very moist but I couldn't resist basting it with a honey/brown sugar/butter/ground cloves mixture after the first 2 hours of baking.

I loved this recipe! I had a 6lb ham, put it in the crock pot at noon, poured 1 diet coke in and rubbed on some brown sugar. I let it cook on high for 6 hours and when it was done, it was so tender it just fell apart. The ham was DELICIOUS!

We love this recipe. We don't like ham but had one in the freezer that needed to be eaten.  Tried this recipe and WOW!!!  We loved the flavor of this ham.  We ate it all! (Unusual behavior for us non-ham eaters. We have NEVER eaten all of a ham.) Easy and delicious.  We will definetly make this recipe again.

LOVED this recipe!!!!  Was an absolute hit!  Added brown sugar to bottom of crockpot and on ham itself.  Cooked 10lbs ham for 7 hours on low in crockpot and it was falling off the bone.  My dad asked me to make it for them again later that same week!!!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband found this recipe and made it for our family.  I was fantatic.  He used a whole can of cola and threw on some sliced pineapples. It was very moist and tastey.  This will be the way we make ham from now on.  Thanks.

This was very good idea.  I have never thought to use a baking bag and it made this super easy and moist without basting. I did add brown sugar to it.

Like most of the others, this was my first baked ham. It turned out great. I also marinated overnight in the Pepsi and put on a glaze before cooking. I would change the cooking time though. I used a guide of 20 minutes per pound. I think this was a little too long (for a partially cooked ham). I would use a meat thermometer at about 15 minutes per pound to see it was done. Otherwise, I will definetly make this again. I had a 13 lb ham and there were NO leftovers!!

This was really good.I trimmed alot of the fat off and scored it and studed it with cloves . I like the flavor. Then i packed brown sugar on the ham. I used enough pepsi to cover the ham when the air was squeezed out of the bag. I also put in a single size serving can of pineapple juice. Smelled great. I just didnt think it looked all that appealing but it tasted good. It may have been because I trimmed it. But it had a thick rind on it and i just wanted it gone. I will use this recipe again cause it was simple.

I make a ham every Thanksgiving and this was by far the best one and it was so easy to prepare!  I made this ham and a small turkey for Thanksgiving and there was very little ham left over.  I put it in a roaster oven at about 325 until it came to temperature and used a full can of cola.  It was tender and flavorful.  I plan on making it again for Christmas dinner and will also probably make it for New Years!  Thank you for this recipe!

this is my family's favourite way to have ham.  I have cooked my ham with the coke and bag several times and it always turns out perfect.  I always use just a "football" ham - no bone, cut off all the skin, pour 1/2 can of coke over top of it in the bag, seal, cut a couple holes and cook for 4 - 4.5 hrs.  it is so tender and delicious - by far the best ham my family has ever had!!

This was the best ham I've ever made.  I usually stay away from ham because I don't like the way it turns out, but this was juicy, melt in your mouth tender and couldn't have been easier!!!  I served it at a big Easter dinner party and everyone loved it!

Don't use this recipe for a spiral ham.  My ham was bone dry and I even marinated the ham in the Coke overnight.  I did as many other suggest figuring it could only make it more moist.  I also followed the idea of others to cover it in brown sugar before baking.  However, even at 275 degrees, 4 hours was WAY too long for this.  I can only assume it was because it was a spiral sliced ham and that is why I gave the recipe 3 stars.  Perhaps with a regular ham it would have been great.  Just want to let others out there know that it didn't work with a 10lb. spiral!

I have been using this recipe for many, many years.  I do use a can of clear soda.  I have used sprite, 7 up, & mountain dew.  I also add the brown sugar to the top.  Such an easy, no fuss meal!  Happy Holidays

This was my first ham and it turned out delicious!! The only thing I did different was rub brown sugar all over it and I don't put mine in a bag because I baste it often with the Coke or Pepsi. I prefer Pepsi. I will be making again for Christmas!! Also I just use a Smithfield half ham. Thanks :)

This was the easiet ham I have ever made.  I didn't have any oven bags on hand so I just poured the soda over the ham in the pan and covered with tin foil.  It was so quick and easy I couldn't believe it.  I covered it for the first hour and then left it uncovered for the second hour.  I also basted it every 30 minutes.  My husband doesn't like ham and pineapple (I know... weird), so this was the next best thing.  Next time I will try it with Diet Cherry Coke.  Yum!!

This was delicious! I took it to Thanksgiving with my inlaws (about 50 people, most of whom had been in the restaurant/catering business for year). It was the first time that I ever brought the main dish, and everyone raved about it! Since I could only get a pre-cooked spiral ham, I reduce the cooking time to about 2-3 hours for a 12 pound ham. I marinated it overnight in cola with brouwn sugar rubbed over both sides. Then, during cooking I basted it constantly to make sure that it didn't get dried out. It was super moist and full  of flavor.

I made this ham last Christmas and everyone raved over it!  I kept hearing "This is the best ham I have ever had!" Everyone wanted the recipe.  I also rubbed it in brown sugar and marinated it overnight.  I'm making it again this Christmas.  I don't think I will make ham any other way again.

As a mother of two who goes to college and holds down a full time job. I need recipes like this one. 
This is one of the easiest Hams to make. There is very little prep to do. which can be done the night before. And the long cook time allows me to do homework, or go back to classes or work. The Ham comes out tender as if you slaved over it, yet it is, a bag it, stick in the oven and forget it. 
I found I can bake potatoes at the same time. Using medium baking taters. Clean them poke with a fork all over 12 to 16 times and wrap in aluminum shinny side toward the tater. Bake along side with Ham on the rack. Taters come out with a moist tender center, and a lightly crisp skin.  This gives me time to cook carrots  and a good side pasta to make a great dinner. 
Left overs make great lunch sandwiches for the next couple of days and/or dinner the next night! 

Mom is the hero again!

WOW! This was the Best ham I have ever eaten. It got rave reviews at a recent party, my dad, the pickiest ham eater alive, LOVED it at Thanksgiving, and my husband, who hates ham, actually ate this! So simple yet the meat was fork tender, it tasted rich and smoky and was so juicy, and I used the cheapest ham I could find!

OMG! Happy Easter Ham!! This was the best. I did add some brown sugar and cloves. When I took it out of the bag it fell apart. Thank you.

I did not have a turkey bag--so I threw the ham into the slow cooker with the cola and some pineapple juice  and brown sugar as suggested by another member....it turned out delicious....I added pineapple chunks in the last ten minutes of cooking--my husband loved it!

this recipe is always a favorite of mine except I use approx. a 1/2 liter of coke and place 2 to 3 tbsp of brown sugar on top of the ham while baking.

This is my favorite way to make ham, but instead of pre cooked, I get a ham shank and cook it! May try to soak as some suggest and add brown sugar. The possibilities are endless!

This recipe is fantastic! Made it for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit. I followed other raters advice and smashed some brown sugar on the ham right before baking. It was perfect! The only thing is the drippings don't make very good gravy, but it was okay.

We have used this simple recipe for years.  The trick is to use reglur Vernors Ginger Ale.  If you cannot get Vernors, then use whatever Ginger Ale you can get but Vernors is the best one.

A little flavorless, but moist- cuts with a fork. Used a bone-in 8 pound shank ham, trimmed. Added a couple handfuls of brown sugar. BUT Follow other suggestions if you can and marinate overnight in coke (or rootbeer) and/or add a can of pineapple to the bag. Tasted similar to packaged lunchmeat ham in wetness and flavor. Didn't need to cook it as long as it said (took 2 hrs 20 min for 8lbs). Could be a 5 star recipe if there was more flavor!!

I used diet coke ( a whole can) on my 8lb ham, marinated overnight in the baking bag then added the brown sugar coating as others suggested before baking for 4 hrs. It was super tender- fall off the bone, even! It seemed to need one other flavor element...maybe pineapple? Well, it was easy and I will make it again & add that! Now I have a ham bone & leftover ham to make my lentil soup!

Very good. I marinated the ham in Cherry pepsi the night before. Before I cooked it I scored the ham, made the diamond cuts, coated it with brown sugar, cloves, pineapples and cherries. It was very good, tender and moist! My co-worker also tried the recipe and said this is the first time her ham went the first day! She used maple syrup in addition to the brown sugar, pineapples, and cherries.

This turned out great.  I used pepsi and added some dark brown sugar and a little bit of ground cloves.  I twisted the bag shut, but didn't poke holes in it.  I did have to let steam out once about 3/4 the way through and turned the ham at that time.  AWESOME.  I only wish I would have bought a bigger ham!

So tender and juicy!  And, isn't that all you really need out of a ham?  I scored the ham and added pineapple and brown sugar, but I don't think that any of the additions actually flavored the meat.  The method of cooking is what's the key to this - it makes the meat so juicy!  I cooked an 18 pound whole ham, and it only took 4 hours for the internal temp. to reach 140, the recommended temp.

Very delicious and easy to prepare.  I used a picnic ham.  The meat was so moist and tender that it fell off the bone as I was lifting it out of the pan.

I am not one for having alot on hand and when I feel like cooking running to the store is not always an option.  This was perfect for me!  I used diet cola, let sit overnight in the fridge and then did the rub down like other reviews - brown sugar and added cloves.  I still left the cola in the bag while baking - just sloshed the bag around during the cooking time.  I added pineapple rings and left the bag open during the last 20 mins or so.  What a great ham recipie!

This was super delicious!  I never knew something so simple could turn out so good.  We used a spiral sliced ham and about 16 ounces of Coca Cola,  I basted the ham several times with the Coke/ham juices during baking.  It was very moist and flavorful.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This was sssssooooo good! I bought a spiral honey ham w/spices included and mixed the spices in with the soda. Placed it in the crockpot with some stew veggies and it came out perfect! I did add more soda than the recipe called for, though.

If you like ham to taste like ham--this is the recipe for you!  Excellent flavor.  It was so moist and literally did fall off the bone.  I made it exactly like the recipe stated and it was PERFECT!

Suzanne, My mother, who died in 2001 at 88, cooked a ham like this for many, many years, only she put it in a heavy paper bag and poured in Coca-Cola!  How delightful to read your recipe.  I know it's a five star!  Joan

This was so tender, and had a fabulous taste.  I also used Diet Coke because it was all I had, but I rubbed a light coating of brown sugar on the outside of the ham before closing the oven bag.  Scrumptious!

I might have cooked mine too long (about 5 hours) because it turned out pretty dry.  The ham did have a really good flavor to it; kind of sweet tasting.  Next time I will try cooking the ham for 4 hours and see if that makes a difference.

This is an easy was to heat up a precooked ham. Mine came out juicy. I did not serve this as a sit down meal with all the fixens and I am glad I didn't. It was the ugliest ham since it all fell apart and was stained with cola. Didn't care about the looks of the ham since I was only using it to make ham salad and casseroles. As a plus this was super easy cleanup.

I'm sure I could spend $5 to $10 more on additional ingredients for a "better" ham . . . but this approach is about all I need to keep two growing boys happy.

This was simple and great! I trimmed the fat and skin then rubbed it with brown sugar minutes before baking. Marinaded overnight in Coke. Very good!

Deliciously juicy!  I used a smoked ham (because that was all the store had left when I did my last minute shopping) and it was wonderful!!!

I was disappointed after reading all the rave reviews.  Just ham nothing special, I would not make this again.  There are much better ham recipes on this site.

The best baked ham I have ever cooked.  Delicious, moist falling off the bone.  I used a 16 pound whole ham, did not change the recipe at all.  I will never cook a ham any other way again!!!

My ex used to say I was addicted to Coke so when I found this recipe, I HAD to try it. WONDERFUL! FANTASTIC! Moist. Tender. What great sandwiches!

But I didn't start with a pre-cooked, spiral ham as the recipe calls for. I got a half, uncooked ham from Wal-Mart (9 pounds) and roasted it for about 6 hours, after tossing in about a 1/8th c. of brown sugar. That was it.

I'm sold!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit with everyone. I used a 10 lb half butt ham and patted it with brown sugar. I also basted it every hour and it came out tender and delicious. Will definately use this recipe again and again.

We like to use root beer instead of cola.  The flavor is great when you add brown sugar to the top of the meat! Juicy and delicious.

We just had this ham for Thanksgiving. It was great. We marinated it in VANILLA coke over night, rubbed it with brown sugar and put some pineapple on top. Six hours later in the crock pot-- it was falling apart. Very juicy and great flavor-- THANKS!

This was wonderful! We could not quit eating it! Then later I took it out for my son and his fiance. They couldn't quit eating it either! Finally they begged me to put it away! It is so simple and it has a wonderful flavor!
We followed directions exactly! We have used a regular ham and a spiral cut ham and it turned out wonderful either way. 
We made it at Thanksgiving and we are making it again for Christmas! 
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Delish!! I made this on my family vacation last September and everyone loved it!! I used an entire can of Pepsi and it was so juicy. It was so easy, I put it in the oven and was able to enjoy the remainder of the afternoon sitting pool side. I complimented the ham with the Oven Roasted New Potatoes recipe that is also found on this site.  We warmed up both the leftover ham and potatoes the next morning and served with eggs.  We still had leftover ham and we enjoyed sandwiches at lunch the next day. YUMMY!!!

This was the BEST ham I've ever eaten! My family ate it up faster than the turkey even though they're huge turkey fans. My ham was frozen and I put it in the turkey bag with a can of coke a few days before to thaw it out (in the fridge). I followed the rest of the directions exactly and couldn't have asked for better results. I will definately be using the recipe whenever I cook ham. Everyone in my family said this would be the only way they will cook ham also!

I followed the advice of others and rubbed down the ham with brown sugar before cooking.  I will say that the ham was very tender and the taste was okay but not magnificent like I was expecting.  Personally I did not like the color that the coca-cola gave the ham and neither did my children.  It was very easy though and if it wasn't for the color I would give it more stars.

Although this was very tender and juicy, it just tasted like an ordinary ham, with barely a hint of a cola taste to it. I think it was because I didn't cook the ham long enough for the cola to work it's "magic"? I had a 2 1/2lb ham; since it was small, I didn't want to dry it out as it did to others. A precooked ham doesn't need to be cooked, it just tastes better if it is - so, as long you don't cook it for too long, or overcook it, you're going to get the same tender and juicy result (as it's already cooked). I'd like to try this again - I'm thinking of trying the crockpot or marinating it in the mixture (I used coke and brown sugar) next time around. Hopefully, the results yield to my expectations then.

I couldnt find any turkey bags, so I improvised.  I marinated the ham in a bottle of pepsi over night.  The next day i heated the soda up, added some honey and brown sugar, and then thickened it with cornstarch to a light jelly like state. I glazed the ham about every 20-30 mins or so and it turned out fantastic! Thanks!

I made this ham for Christmas and it was a hit!  I took the advice of some other reviews and mixed pineapple juice and brown sugar with the cola and marinated my 8lb. ham overnight. I didn't have a cooking bag, so I put the ham in a casserole dish, trimmed the fat, and pierced the ham all over to a depth of about 1/2 inch with a large meat fork to allow the liquid to get inside. I turned it periodically and also spooned the mixture over the ham, and allowed it to soak overnight.  Christmas day I patted on some extra sugar, wrapped it in foil, and baked it on a cookie sheet at 350F for 21/2 hours.  It was moist, juicy, almost ready to fall apart, and the ham had soaked up the sweet flavor of the marinade. Awesome!

I made this using a 6.5 pound "Cure 81" ham, a full can of coke, and a small size (up to 12 pound) roasting bag.  I don't know if it was the ham itself or the recipe, but it was the best ham we've ever had.  My wife insisted that I make it again the next week!

Best ham I've ever made. I put a 10 pound shank end in the crock pot (had to cover with foil as it was too big to put the lid on) and cooked it overnight while we slept. I just poured coke over the ham until the liquid came about 1/4 way up the side of the crock pot. The meat fell off the bone the next morning, and the juice that the ham/coke made is incredible! Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite way to make ham! Believe it or not, it works in a slow cooker too. Sometime in the summer I just get a ham sliced up, let it set in the slow cooker with a couple cans of cola for about 4-5 hours. Each slice gets caramelized and golden! They make the best pick-nick sandwiches with pickles and mayo and lettuce on big white fluffy buns! Try it sometime it will be a hit!

Was okay, just not spectacular.  I added some brown sugar, cloves, and dry mustard to the coke for extra flavor. Will probably try again because it was so easy..., maybe will try ginger ale next time.

I love this recipe!  It makes for a very tender ham.  I have experimented and used Sprite instead of cola and found it to be enjoyable as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good!  I marinated the ham overnight in the cola (a whole can) and rubbed liberally with brown sugar before cooking.  The drippings were a bit sweet for gravy this way though, which I love - not much is better than good ham gravy!  Overall, a wonderful way to make ham.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe at all.  I'm giving it three stars because it didn't taste bad.  It's just that it tasted like a plain old ham to me.  I couldn't tell that the cola even added any flavor at all.  I even marinated it over night as some others suggested.  I won't be making this again.  I usually just do a simple glaze of brown sugar, orange juice, and cloves which adds so much more flavor than following this recipe does.

I used a 3 lb. boneless ham and marinated it overnight in about a liter of Cherry Coke. The next day I put the ham in the slow cooker along with the liquid and cooked it on low for 4 hours to heat it through. The easiest, best tasting ham I've ever made. This is my ham recipe from now on.

made this with a spiral cut ham and it was too dry. I would cut back on the time when I make it again. Ham that was not pre-cut was very moist.

I shaved all the fat off, used Sprite and a baking bag with whole cloves.  This ham turned out very delicious and NOT salty or greasy at all.

We are not big fans of ham, but this turned out very good. The ham was very tender. I used diet vanilla coke, some brown sugar and ground cloves. Very easy. It smelled great while cooking.

I have used the cola with a few more ingredients.  Try rubbing down the ham with 1 cup brown sugar, then add pineapples from a small can and pour the juice over it.  I cook mine in the bag overnight at 250 degrees.  This has always turned out great. Note: I use a 20 lb Tavern Ham.

THIS IS FANTASTIC!  I made it a couple weeks ago for Mom, Dad, hubby and me.  Dad talked about it so much that the next day I had visits from other family members to taste the left overs!  From my 6 year old nephew to my 80 year old Dad...everyone agreed that it was the best ham they ever had.  We ate every single bite of that ham!  We'll be having it again day after tomorrow for Easter.  Sure hope it wasn't a "fluke". :~)

This recipe was awesome. Marinaded my 10 lb, precooked, smoked ham in bag with two cans of diet coke the night before rotating as much as possible then drained, rubbed ham with spicy brown mustard & horseradish sauce, packed with brown sugar then added new coke and baked. It turned out AWESOME! Received rave reviews!

So easy to prepare! I followed the ham package label and started my 8.75 lb shank ham at 325 deg.  It was cooking quickly so I turned the temp down a bit.  I only cooked it for 2 3/4 hrs, it was darkening and pulling away from the bone. It turned out to be the best ham I've ever cooked.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

What an easy way to bake ham, I've used this recipe twice, didn't have the cooking bags so just put the ham in a casserole dish and sealed with foil.  Excellent.  Going to try it next in the crockpot.  We raise our own pigs so I am always looking for good simple recipes.

I made 2 hams for my company on Easter Sunday, this one and "No More Salty Ham" also found on this site.  Well, both were good, but for all of the extra work No More Salty Ham took, I have to say that cola ham was better.  It was so tender and tasty that no one could stop eating it!  And it couldn't be easier.  My ham was a butt portion Cooks ham and only 7 pounds.  I baked it the recommended 4 hours.  So good.  I will make my hams this way from now on.

I used a precooked/presliced ham. This was not a good idea. I did let it marinade overnight, but the ham didn't taste like anything, and it was just darker colored on the bottom. I'm not quite sure what I did wrong, except maybe next time I'll try a regular ham.

My family has used this recipe for years and years.  I change it a little - I push whole cloves all around into the ham and then I add pineapple slices.  Then I pour the coke over it and bake.  I've done this with whole hams and spiral hams both.  I love the taste and so does my family.

This recipes was awesome. I added some brown sugar, cloves, and dry mustard to the coke for extra flavor. It got rave reviews from everyone. By far the best ham recipe I have used. Next time I'll cook a bigger ham. More for leftovers!

we thought this recipe was okay but probably won't make it again. i scored a 3+ lb. boneless amish ham, added the coke, did the oven bag trick & baked it for 2 hours. maybe using a bigger ham (& hence longer baking time) makes this ham good enough to get all those stars? thanks anyway suzanne!

Made this for Christmas. Didn't have coke so we used Holiday spice Pepsi.  I also did a brown sugar rub on it.  It came out perfect.  My husband said it was the best ham he's ever tasted. Everyone loved it.

FIRST TIME USING THE COKE THE HAM WAS SO MOIST YOU COULD CUT IT WITH YOUR FORK IT TASTED LIKE IT WAS ACTUALLY MELTING IN YOUR MOUTH.  ALSO POURED IN PINEAPPLE JUICE AND RUBBED HAM DOWN WITH BROWN SUGAR. FAMILY LOVED THE HAM.

Used a spiral cut ham.  Could have been the problem.  Cooked it for only 2 1/2 hours at 225 and our ham came out dry.

My ham turned out so dry.  I don't know what I did wrong.  I even marinated it for a few hours like prior reviews suggested.  May be the suggested cooking time was too long.  The ham was very brown on top.

I also took the recommendation of others and added brown sugar to the ham and used the cola in a bag, came out great! I think next time I'll take it a step further and go for the pineapple & juice also! thanks!

I put the ham in an oven bag added brown sugar and coke.  I have to admit I was a little worried about putting in coca cola because normally I would use orange soda.  No worries, ham was flavorful, juicy and delicious.

I knew this recipe would be easy but when I went to make it I didn't have regular coke but I did have vanilla coke.  I used a ready to cook ham, the whole can of soda, threw it in a cooking bag and boy is it nice and moist. To me, I thought it was great but I think I will have to pass some to a friend to see what they think too.

This turns out a nice tasting and moist ham. My husbands comment was that it was not better than my usual way of serving ham, but was equally as good. It is certainly much less work, so we will be using this recipe again. Thanks, Suzanne.

I thought this was ok.  The flavor did not penetrate the ham, as I had hoped.  Maybe a sauce on the side will go well.  Goes well with mashed potatoes, however.

This recipe was so simple and got such stellar reviews I thought there must be some magic to it so I tried it for Easter. Kind of disappointing. The cola just laid there in the bottom of the bag and didn't contribute much to the flavor that I could tell. Ended up with a hot ham that was nothing special.

This is my fail proof way to cook my hams! I use one 12-16 oz btl of ginger ale, cover with thinly sliced onions and sprinkle with Morton's Natures Seasoning! The soda cuts down the saltiness of the ham every time! I do cover mine with tin foil and bake at 325 for 1-2 hrs, depending upon size of ham.

I cooked it in the crock pot with a can of coke and crushed pineapple (had dreams of bacon all night :D)that evening which created a shredded ham. Then I used Deluxe Corned Beef Hash recipe and instead of corned beef I used the shredded ham and added about 6 eggs on top and poached them with the cover on for about 10 minutes....It was YUMMY!!!

Ham can be really dry after a couple of hours in the oven but when fixed with the oven bag and a can of cola, the ham was moist and very tasty.  The cola doesn't affect the flavor but it does keep the ham nice and juicy.  And.... clean-up is a snap!!!

Moist, delicious ham! We made this recipe today for Easter, along with the Yummy Sweet Potato Casserole recipe by Tina B. This was super easy, my ex marinated the ham in the soda the night before, added the brown sugar, and close the bag again. We cooked it low and slow, and it was wonderful. I bought a fairly inexpensive store-brand ham, and this recipe made it so tender. Thank you for sharing this simple, terrific recipe, Mary. We will definitely make this again!

Made this for dinner tonight for 2 guys in the house who don't like ham.  They both ate it up and said they really liked it!  Maybe because I've got a little cold, I do like ham, but didn't think this was all that special.  I made it in the crockpot with a can of diet coke.  It was incredibly easy and I'll make it again!

I'm giving this recipe five stars even though I made some changes, because the basic recipe is what started it all!  I used a 6-lb. boneless smoked ham; I don't like the fat and hassle of a bone-in ham.  Like others, I poured a can of chopped pineapple on top, and patted about 1/2 cup of brown sugar on the top. I turned it several times during the day, and it was so moist and delicious!!

I definitely didn't get the same colour that I expected.  I cooked in on low in the slow cookier. It was really good ham, nice and tasty and juicy, but it just didn't seem to be anything special. I guess I had higher expectations, but overall, was yummy :)

I wasn't too impressed with this. The ham just tasted like pork - no sweeter or no added flavour at all. I wouldn't make this again.

This was a terrific recipe. I only had a 5 lb uncooked smoked ham, but I followed the directions to a T and it came out juicy and falling off the bone. My family couldn't get enough. I will be making again.

I would not make this again. I did get a presliced spiral ham which may have contributed to the dryness.  It was just boring and I dont feel the flavor of the ham was enhanced in any way by this recipe; it needed some type of glaze or something to give it some flavor and pizazz.

I used this recipe to cook my Easter Ham and it was fabulous!  I could have just pulled the bone right out from the ham! The meat was so tender it just fell off the bone.  Great recipe!!!

Sorry Suzanne, but this one didn't do a thing for us.  I took some reviewers' advice and marinated my boneless ham overnight in the cola.  There was just nothing interesting about this.

Not only is this recipe easy, but it tastes great.  I substitute a can of beer for the cola.  It is great to make for left overs to put on salads, for sandwiches, or even in omlettes!

Made this last night as I had bought a ham on sale and wanted to try something new. This was amazing! Per other reviews I used a whole can of coke. Rubbed the ham down all over with brown sugar, poured the coke over it and dumped pineapple tidbits on top. tied up the bag and baked in a roaster with the lid on. 6.8 lb ham @ 275 for 3 - 3 1/2 hours and it was to die for. I'll be using this recipe for now on.

What a great recipe. Even my very picky husband and 7 yr old liked it. I used cherry crush instead of the cola and it gave it a great coloring. I changed the bag and applied brown sugar to the ham and put in some cherry crush and only baked it for 2 hours because it was only a 6 pound ham.  I will be making this again for Easter.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I was a little skeptical at first but since I was having a low-key Easter dinner, I figured I'd give it a shot.  VERY glad I did!  I had a 7.7lb fully cooked ham that I put in the crock pot with half a can of coke zero.  After reading other reviews, I cooked the ham on low for 8 hours, but I think it was too long.  It was still very moist, but I think it would have been done (140 temp) after about 6 hours.  So my recommendation is to just use a good meat thermometer and you should be good!  I'll keep using this recipe and cooking it in the crockpot because of the ease and tastiness.

This was great. I trimmed half the fat, put in a regular roasting pan, 1/2 can of coke, covered with foil and added the 2nd half of the coke 1/2 hr before completion. Great flavor!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and it turned out fantastic!  It was served at a family gathering and it received rave reviews.  I'm trying it again for Thanksgiving with a brown sugar and clove rub on top just to see if it comes out any better.  If not, I'm happy to keep the original recipe as it really is delicious the way it is.  To those worried about the cola sitting in the bottom of the bag, it's ok.  As long as the holes you poke are few and small, the steam will still build up in the bag and the result will be great!

The first time I made this I put the ham in a crock pot.  Big mistake, it was so dry.  This Easter I used a bone in ham that wasn't pre-sliced, I marinated the ham overnight in the bag with a whole 2 liter of pepsi and I cooked it as the recipe calls for in the oven.  This was the BEST ham ever!  I am so happy I can finally cook a great ham!

I made this yesterday for CHristmas Eve dinner.  It was my first attempt making a ham and it was very easy. I actually made two seperate bonelss half-hams because I was afraid it might not turn out.  Even though they were cut from the same ham, they tasted exactly the same (and the traditional was just as easy).  This one was, however, slightly more tender IMO but everyone else preferred the traditional ham.  I think I;ll stick with that one.

Very tender!  I cut my ham into 4 thick slices as didn't have the time to cook it per the recipe.  It was very tender and juicy.  It does darken the meat a lot as another reviewer mentioned, but the taste was excellent!

Delicious!  Used spiral cooked ham and marinated overnight in full can of cola.  Cooked ham for about 2 hours.  Very moist and tasty!  Next time I will take other reviewers advice and try adding pineapple juice and brown sugar to marinade.

Tried this recipe for Christmas.  My first ham.  It came out very dry!  Like another reviewer, I think it was because I used a spiral cut ham.  I can see, however, that if you use the right type, the flavor is good.

I love this recipe and have altered it slightly.  I add about 2-3 cans of cherry cola to oven bag to give it a juicier flavor!

I loved this recipe. I've told everyone about it and they think it sounds weird, but they stop saying that when they taste it.

This is so easy.  The ham wasn't dry.  It was moist and had a lot of flavor.  I did baste it with the packet that came with it at the end.

It was not as sweet as we like.  The family prefers the old fashioned way with brown sugar; however, I loved the easy clean up with the use of the bag.

This recipe is so easy & simple cleanup when using the bag.  Only cola product I had was cherry flavored Pepsi.  Gave it a good flavor.  Also added sliced pineapple with toothpicks.  It was a big hit at our Easter dinner.

Used Coke Zero & some added Bakers Sugar... think using regular Coke would have turned out better. However very tasty as I made it. Super easy to make & super easy clean up

Easiest baked ham I've ever made.  Next time, however, I would bake it less than the 4-5 hours recommended.  Maybe 3?  3.5?

Almost 10lb. ham turned out great. The only thing I did different was to glaze it, and bake it for 10 min. after 4 hours in the oven. FYI, the coke is not a marinade. It is just supposed to steam the ham in the bag.

this is , by far, the easiest, tastiest, tenderest ham I have ever made, tasted, bought, or enjoyed. It was tender, juicy and didn't have the sweetness most other ham/glazes do. My family does not do the sweet gooey glazed ham, but prefer a natural smoked ham flavor. If you are looking for a good ham baked to perfection, cutting the sweet and sugary ness, try it. even tho the coke has sugar, there is no overlaying taste , just pure smoky ham flavor. thanks so much for a ham diabetics can truly enjoy without guilt.

This is one of the best hams I've made. I used a hickory smoked spiral sliced ham. I didn't have a bag for it so I just covered with aluminum foil. Also one suggestion is to use a meat thermometer. The instructions stated to bake much longer than what was actually needed.

Mine turned out over cooked and dry in spite of following the exact directions. I may try it again but will be sure to keep a good eye on it.

Disclaimer: Make sure you baste it! (keep reading...)
My Grandmother got this recipe from a friend about 20 yrs ago. She made it simply the way it said. Put it in the bag, pour the diet coke over it, tie 'er up, and bake for a long time on low heat. And baste it with the juices about once every hour. I just poke a turkey baster through one of the holes on one side, suck up some of the juices, then squirt them all over the ham. Do that on both sides. Other than that, no maintenance needed. She usually cooked it about 6-8 hours. Sometimes overnight. By the time it was done, It was falling off the bone! I've been using that recipe for years and it is amazing!! Sometimes, like tonight, I use Dr. Pepper instead of Diet Coke. Great replacement because it has that kinda cherry flavor to it.  =)

Love this recipe!  I like using Root Beer a little more.  The sassafras flavor is so subtle.  Yum!
