J'Teena, nice twist on shepherds pie. I took other reviewers suggestions of doing only a top crust. I used garlic and cheddar cheese in the biscuit mix. For extra flavor I also added 1t garlic powder to the meat while it was cooking, and 1/4c parmesan cheese and 1t garlic powder to the mashed potatoes. My family gave it "two thumbs up". My hubby has asked me to make it for his fishing campout with his buds! Now that's a compliment! :-)PS I used all frozen veggies since we don't care for the canned version.

I've got a family of 5, three of which are young and very picky boys, so I'm always on the lookout for something that is both tasty and filling.  This fit both bills.  I cut out the bottom layer of biscuit mix and just used the mashed potatos instead, I also added a large can of mushrooms and increased the chili powder.  We'll definitely be making this again as it's a LOT of food and the boys all loved it!

Flawed yet filling!? I added blanched fresh vegetables insted of canned because the thought of canned peas makes me ****!  My wife suggested leaving off the top crust because the bottom layer was plenty. A little bland in the seasonings but I would make it again and spice it up a little more. Would be good on a cold winters night.

My bunch really enjoyed this recipe.  It really does make a lot, but you really can't have too much.  Tastes just as good warmed over later.  I added some sharp chedder cheese.  The one complaint I got was the WHOLE tomatoes, I will use the chopped can of tomatoes when I cook it for church Sunday.  I may get brave and add some sour cream with the potatoes to give it a perk!!  There was alot of crust, but I like that.  Made it really pretty, too.  I suggest to those who don't like much crust to just make less crust.  I like crust of the top and bottom.  Just grease your dish with butter or spray and it won't stick. I think this is so far the best recipe on this site I've come across so far... but I have plenty to try.

A lot of people are mentioning that this is underseasoned. I think the recipe is oddly worded, as 1/4 TABLEspoon is a weird measurement, I don't have any fractions of tablespoons on my measuring set. I suspect many of the home cooks inadvertently used 1/4 teaspoon instead.  Everywhere that it says 1/4 tablespoon, use 1 teaspoon instead.

It was good.  Did not have all of the ingredients, but was still good.  We used 8oz tomato sauce (no tomatoes), 2 cans of corn (no peas), and just topped with potatoes (no crust). I will make again when I have all of the stuff.  Makes a great shepperd's pie this way.

This is a recipe that my family loved! There was only one problem and that was too much crust and the bottom crust stuck to the bottom of the pan.  My only suggestion is leave out either the bottom or top crust!!

I thought that this recipe was excellent!  It was really good and cheesy.  I halved it and omitted the green beans and peas and only used corn.  It was an excellent dish that didn't need anything on the side!  I give it 5 stars!

My family loved this dish.  Only thing was I was not able to put top crust on.  It was overflowing.  I recommend at bigger pan or minus the top crust.  It was just as good.  Thanks for the wonderful dish.

I scaled this down to 6 servings and made the following revisions; I didn't add green beans or peas, instead just a half can of corn, a half can of black beans, and 1 sm can tomato sauce with 1 can water.  I simmered seasoned meat/veg mixture 10 min. then used about 1 T flour the thicken the remaining mixture.  I made only the top crust and it was plenty but I overbaked, forgetting my scaled down ingredients.  I should have taken it out maybe 5 minutes earlier since the crust was a little too done.  Still tastly though!..

I think this recipie is great! It is a wonderful way to use leftovers. It's a sort of mix between shepherd's pie and pot pie. I took other members advice and only made the top crust. I threw in frozen veggies and used fresh tomatoes. I also added a couple of bouillion cubes and some water. I didn't have any baking mix so I made my own crust. Delicious!Thanks for a great recipie J'Teena!

I'm glad I tried this recipe. I made a different shepards pie-type recipe before, and it didn't turn out well, so I was a little nervouse about this one. I used frozen vegetables and added a little ground red pepper and garlic salt to give it more flavor. I also used chedder cheese instead of american.
