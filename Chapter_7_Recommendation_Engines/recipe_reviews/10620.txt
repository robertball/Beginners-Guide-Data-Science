YUM!  These are very delicate in flavor.  Just a hint of spice and not too sweet.  I did use an extra egg in the batter by accident, but they were so light and puffy that I would do the same again.  I also rolled mine in powdered sugar instead of flour for just a touch more sweetness.  My children LOVE these and I didn't expect them to since they are not very sweet.  Hint: Bake just until edges are set for light, soft cookies; do not brown.

I wasn't familiar with this type of cookie, so I can't speak to its authenticity, but it was easy to prepare and had a good taste, although slightly dry texture (which is probably characteristic for this type of recipe).  My family enjoyed it slightly more than I did -- they very much enjoyed it.  Interestingly, the aftertaste is actually MORE appealing (to me). My family said they'd want me to make it again.
