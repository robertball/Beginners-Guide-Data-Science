It's like dessert, for breakfast! I love Nutella, and have a major sweet tooth, so this one was right up my alley! No need for syrup. Goes great with bananas and strawberries as well. Yummo!

Perfectly rich, gooey, & decadent!  I served with just a little powdered sugar and some clementines and it was a nice treat for brunch.

I make french toast often.  After reading through this recipe & watching the video I decided to offer it to my fussy eater.   It was simple and fast to make.  The taste was appealing to all senses!  My fussy eater had a second piece!

Awesome. Kid (and myself too) loved it very much. I stuffed in some banana pieces and sealed the edges by pressing with a fork. Then soaked in egg mixture and cooked per directions.

This was good. I dusted with powdered sugar, and I didn't need to add any syrup. I used the cinnamon bread as suggested by the submitter. I think I would just use regular wheat bread next time and add just a little more Nutella in the sandwich. Thanks for the yummy idea for breakfast!

This recipe turned out great! I added raspberry jam to the toast, but I would highly recommend any type of fresh fruit such as strawberries or bananas. Adding some freshly grated orange zest would add a nice flavor as well!?

So amazing! I made mine with wheat bread and added cinnamon since it was a icy snowy day we didn’t want to risk going out. We also added coconut homemade cool whip, strawberries, bananas, & coconut flakes.

Super easy!  Super yummy!  Really quick to make and was a huge hit with my family.  Didn't change a thing.  Added a side of fruit and a side of bacon, breakfast is done.

Toddler twins and husband loved it and it offered a unique spin on regular French toast! I use real butter instead of spray and it’s even more decadent.

This recipe is good. My family liked it. It was a little too sweet for me. I will make it again, but next time I think I’ll use less Nutella and regular bread (instead of cinnamon bread).

I really like Nutella. When making it, i added TOO much Nutella. It was too chocolaty for me. Other then that, everything came out good.

Pretty good. You could probably just make regular french toast and put the nutella on it after and it would still taste the same.

Decided to find out what the fuss was with Nutella.  I think I will pass on this, but then again, I'm not big into overly sweet things, so I should have left it alone.

This was easy and delicious. My daughter definitely will ask for it again. I added crushed walnuts and banana slices in mine, but she preferred hers with just the powdered sugar.

this meal turned out to be a big hit. I added sour cream at time of serving to kick it up a notch. I have two boys and a hubby who are rather picky, and I had no leftovers-which says a lot!

I regularly make this at the USO where I volunteer and put banana in.   The young marines love it.   One day we did not have sweet bread or eggs  in so I did it like a grilled cheese sandwich with regular white bread.   That went down great too.
