I've been making these for years and my recipe is called Barbecups.  I don't roll the biscuits out in flour from the refrigerated roll package. I just spray Pam into a cupcake muffin pan, plop the biscuit in and make a well in each biscuit. Add the beef mixture that I also add a couple tbsp's of brown sugar to, and less onion. I put a small chuck of med. cheddar cheese and bake at 400 degrees for about 15 to 18 minutes.

The concept was so neat I had to try them. The husband and kids liked.  Had to come up with side dishes.  Plan to use this idea for eggs with sausage and cheese. Thanks a lot!!

WOWWW!!! I Have a family 5... So we have to change up to keep every one happy... I doubled the recipe and used 2 pkgs of biscuits that had 10 in a pack.. All 3 children helped, even my son.. Very creative idea.. We all loved it..My husband only had a few to take to lunch the next day... Teach him to work late ( GIGGLE)I served with canned corn and mashed potatoes.. My youngest child put corn on top of these and said they were mini pot pies... If I could give this 6 stars I would.. Thanks so much for sharing...
Next time I will try not rolling them, just dropping in, and dipping a space in them... That is definately a time saving technique.

We were craving tacos, but were out of shells. The kids and I loved these with taco filling in them, shredded Mexican cheese mixture on top and salsa & sour cream on the side. The only reason I didn't rate them a 5 was because of the fat factor. I'll try reduced fat biscuits next time. Thanks for the great idea - it really saved our day!

I added some balsamic vinegar and dry mustard to generic barbeque sauce.  Also prefered using minced garlic rather than the powder.  Great dish.....good comfort food.

These were very "curious" little things, and the family loved them. They were easy to make and very tasty.  The left over ones were easy to freeze and reheat. We will be making these again.

I've been making these for years as other posters have stated.  Proper name is Barbecups, a Pillsbury bake off prize winner from the 60's. The amount of barbeque sauce needed is only 1/2 cup, not 1 1/2 cups. 1 1/2 cups is way too much sauce for 1 pound of ground beef. If 1 1/2 cups BBQ sauce is used, it will overpower the taste of the completed recipe.

Help!  I cook a lot and I'm not sure what I did wrong.  They're GREAT but I had a lot left over.  I purchased the dinner sized biscuits (8/pkg) and had half the filling and cheese left over.  Am I missing something?  This recipe is a keeper.

Good stuff.  The kids loved the name, and the meal.  Easy enough to make, and we figured one could add other ingredients or change the BBQ sauce to any number of things.

There are SO many things you can do with the biscuit/filling concept. When I first started making the Bacon Tomato Cups (from here), a few years ago I realized how many things I could actually cook using biscuit dough in a muffin tin. 
I've cooked hamburger, added green pepper, onion, some red pepper flakes and cheese - then topped with a little cheese as well.  I've done breakfast biscuits, dessert biscuits (w/apple pie filling and streusel topping), chicken salad, a veggie variety and many more kinds.
One thing I wanted to add. I use the flaky biscuits and separate (horizontally) into a few pieces. Do NOT worry about how perfect or thick they are in the muffin tin. I've stuck broken pieces together and it makes no difference at all. The biscuit will bake up around any filling you put in it. 

To make little appetizers, use a mini-muffin pan

Use your creativity and have fun! 
Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were good and easy to make.  I can see how another reviewer thought these were reminiscent of school cafeteria food.  It did taste like sloppy joes on top of biscuits....but that is what they are.  Will make again for kids, but don't really think it is the best for adults.  Thanks for the post.

I thought that it was fair. I think that if I make it next time I will try something other than BBQ sauce and use a lot less meat. And perhaps it is a generation thing, but it was stragely reminiscent of school cafeteria scents from years ago. But it was an okay recipe.

My mind is spinning!  What a great springboard recipe this is!  I can see doing the bbq, or use pizza fillings...nacho fillings...philly steak and cheese...how about some scrambled eggs, breakfast sausage and cheese, then keep them in a baggie in the fridge for family members to heat up real quick in the mornings, on their way out the door?  You could even fill them with hashbrowns and baked potato toppings!  
Oh yes, the ideas...!  Thank you FOOD SEEKER!!!

These were a great!  Fun, easy, fast, and cheap.  It isn't the healthiest dinner ever so we won't have them often but this recipe is a keeper.  Instead of leaving the tops 'open' I pulled the dough over the top to make sort of a stuffed biscuit.  Yum!

Very tasty and great idea.  I agree that 1 1/2 cups of BBQ sauce is too much for 1 lb of meat, 1/2 to 3/4 is enough.  I tried this for breakfast using the biscuits in the muffin tin, placed shredded cheese in the bottom of the dough cups, added whole egg to some, and scrambled eggs to the others, added bacon and more shredded cheese to the top and baked 400 degrees for about 15 min or until it is done to your liking.  For softer eggs, bake 1-2 min less.  Very yummy!!! & easy.

A recipe this versatile & easy that tastes good deserves the 5 stars it's got!  I made it three ways so far: as directed; as breakfast treat using sausage, egg and cheese; and my fave so far: cream cheese, sausage and jalapeño.  I used crumbled sausage for all three b/c I just like the flavor of it.  The breakfast version was just ok.  Not as good as I thought it'd be. If you want a real treat, cook the sausage then run a 1/4 jalapeño thru the food processor.  Add crumbled sausage so it makes a coarse crumble.  Then add that to some cream cheese and mix.  Drop that mixture into the pressed cups and sprinkle shredded cheddar on top.  It's out of this world and super simple!  If you make the breakfast version, I suggest putting cream cheese in with the sausage, egg and cheese or maybe Tabasco or something.  It tasted bland, but not bad.  The BBQ version is a lot like a sloppy joe, if you like those, you'll love this one!  Hope that helps!!!  :)

My family has been making these for a lot of years. But we use pizza sauce and call them Pizza Burgers. They are so great! I loved the bbq so we have a new and modern take on an old family classic. Thank you!

I took inspiration from this delicous sounding receipe, but since we try to go healthier where we can, I used lean beef, onion, hot peppers, a little taco seasoning and some Asian hot sauce.  Added a touch of shredded cheddar and light sour cream after removing from the heat.  I did roll out the (reduced fat) biscuits to make them a thin as I could.  I found I there was plenty of dough and filling to make 12 cups.  My husband said it was "Fan-tastic" and we froze half of them for another easy dinner!  Thanks for sharing a great receipe that is easy to adjust to anyone's liking.  We look forward to trying other versions of it in the future!

I make these with taco seasoned meat. I use the smaller biscuits (not the Grands) that come 4 tubes to a package.  These are always a hit with kids and adults alike.  I don't roll the biscuit dough, but rather stretch and mold them by hand to fit the muffin tin.

We liked these a lot and they were easy.  I used some leftover taco meat the second time and served with salsa, also very good.  Just remember to stuff them with meat or they can be a little dry.

Nothing real amazing about these but I give it four stars for the ease and the many variations you could come up with.  I made breakfast cups out of these.  scrambled egg, sausage and cheese.  I will Make them again...maybe tacos next time.

Everyone really liked these. I did change this to use up what I had on hand this evening. We had leftover bbq baby-back ribs that I had pulled the meat from the bone. Used that in place of the the ground beef and it worked out great. I heated the meat in a little bbq sauce, and followed the recipe from there.  Served these with a salad for a quick, easy dinner. Hubby and sons have requested them again during football season. Thanks for sharing!

These are good, but I am not a big BBQ fan.  Somebody suggested an italian version which was sooo delicious.
I browned the beef with garlic and onion.  Then, I stirred in 8oz. of tomato sauce and mixed in some crushed red pepper, italian seasonings, parmesan, and mozarella.  I spooned them in the biscuits then topped with more mozarella...they were delicious.

My family loves this recipe. I have made them as stated and also used left over sloppy joe meat instead of BBQ meat, either was a hit! Very quick and easy with minimal clean up. Thanks for a great week night recipe!! =)

Okay, I admit it, the name alone got me to look at this recipe and I was reeled in 8)  I also diced up some green pepper and jalapeno making it even more sloppy joe like.  Will keep this one for sure. Anything I can freeze and pull out one at a time is my kind of recipe.

Everyone loved dinner! I did not add the BBQ sauce, instead I cooked diced potatoes and an onion packet in the meat, let it simmer and then added seasoned canned tomatoes.
My husband and youngest dipped theirs in ketchup, while my oldest dipped his in ranch.
We called them cheeseburger and fries.
looking forward to trying this with breakfast goodies

These should be called Tasties instead of Uglies! I used Grands homestyle buttermilk biscuits and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and mine are delicious! Only change I made was to leave mine in about 17 min. just to be sure they weren't doughy and they came out perfect! Be sure and chop the onions finely- I wasn't thinking and left mine pretty big so they took up a lot of space in the biscuit well, but they are still yummy. Also, I didn't roll out the biscuits, just flattened with my hands.

My kids love these! I've been making these for a long time also. My family calls them BBQ Beef Cups. The only ingredients we use are the beef, the BBQ sauce and the cheese, which seems to be sufficient. The other difference is that we don't use biscuits, we use butter flavored crescent rolls. You don't need to grease the pans or anything, they usually just pop right out!

These are a staple on the dinner rotation at my house. I've made them many times, and they are always a hit with my kids and husband. Very easy and quick!  I do not use the roll out dough method...why spend the time and have the extra mess. I just spray the muffin pan and make a well pressing the dough up the sides.  I also like to add a little cheddar cheese to the meat mixture prior to spooning it in the dough cups.  These really are easy to adapt to your personal taste. I prefer the barbecue sauce but can see how other sauces or seasonings would be great as well.

We enjoyed these.  Made some with BBQ sauce, some with enchilada sauce, some with taco seasoning.  Next time I am going to try adding some veggies to make a take along meal for camping, fishing, etc.

Everyone loved these and they were great leftover too.  The whole idea inspires a lot of different options too.  You could do a pizza version, a mexican version and the one I'm trying next is a breakfast version with egg, cheese and sausage.  Can't wait!

AWESOME! BUT ANOTHER OPTION. I USED 1 LB. BEEF STEW CHUNKS. PUT THEM IN THE SLOW COOKER WITH THE BBQ SAUCE, ONION, GARLIC POWDER, AND COOK ON HIGH FOR 4 1/2 HOURS. CUT INTO SHREDS, STIR ALL TOGETHER AND LET COOK FOR ANOTHER 1/2 HOUR. THEN PUT INTO BISCUIT CUPS. MY KIDS(PICKY) LOVED THESE! SERVED WITH SWEET BAKED BEANS AND A FRUIT SALAD. YUM!

I agree-too much dough-I remade this and split each biscuit in half, with the same amount of filling made twice as many.  Much better!

This was a great base recipe! Used Pillsbury Grands Jr buttermilk flaky biscuits & they turned out pretty tasty! Not as good leftover though, but that is usually true for Pils' biscuits. Tried two fillings, 1: shepherd's pie, 2: ground beef & sweet potato. The sweet potato was the favorite! I browned 93% ground beef with onions, garlic powder, some basil & oregano, microwaved the sweet potato to cook & mashed with a pat of butter, then mixed with meat mixture & shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Topped with extra cheese, 15 minutes was perfect! Sooo good fresh out of the oven, and despite the name, they looked pretty appetizing. Thanks for the idea for a fun new way to use ground beef!

Mugliess!  Mini uglies.  I used a mini-muffin pan, quartered each biscuit and baked 10 min. Great for kids or as an appetizer. I have left over mix, probably could have used 3/4 lb beef, etc for 32 minis. You could make the meat mix a day or two ahead, or even freeze.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a GREAT quick night dinner!  I made as is, but instead of bbq sauce, I used Heinz brown gravy with onions in a jar.  It was a total hit!  Next time I'm going to put mushrooms into the meat.  Very simple to throw together and everyone loved it.

DH really liked em. I made with whole wheat biscuit mix instead of refrig dough, and I did cut back the amount of bbq substantially. I just kind of eyeballed it. Also added some red hot pepp flakes for kick. I didn't get the "cafeteria food" impression at all with ours.

The fiance loved these, but I had difficulty with the biscuit dough.  Didn't work rolling it out, or with flour.   It did work like pizza dough holding it up in the air and stretching it out.

This was pretty good. I used wheat biscuits and added mushrooms. I thought it was very unique and tasty!! We drained the bbq soaked meat and saved the sauce to drizzel over the uglies when they are through baking. If you bake the sauce with the meat, the bottom of the biscuits will not cook.

These came out great!  I added a whole onion and a few cloves of freshly chopped garlic.  I also added pepper to taste.  I ended up adding some of the cheese to the beef mixture to hold it together like a glue.  While I rolled the biscuit dough out, I didn't use any flour.  Also, I ended up making roughly 16 cups, not 8.  Only making 8, it seems like there would be tons of filling leftover.

Wicked good I get asked for them all the time but if you fill 'em as full as we do put a sheet pan under the muffin pan.  I have done the same thing with sloppy joe sauce instead of bbq sauce.

The first time I made this using BBQ sauce..... It was interesting. I changed it a bit using taco seasoning, breaking the bisquits in half covering with cheese. Then topping with shredded lettace, tomato, sour cream..... basically anything you would put on a taco..... OH MY GOD..... i have requests to do this every weekend now.

Well it's true..  These "Uglies" were very ugly.. In 2 different ways... 1st way: They were ugly in appearance. 2nd way: They tasted SUPER UGLY!!!  We did not care for these at all.  We still laugh and get kind of grossed-out when anyone mentions them.  Thanks.

We thought these were OK but not voted on to make again.  I did get a cute idea from this recipe though; going to turn my muffin tin upside down, mold the biscuits around the cups; bake until brown then fill with sausage gravy to serve with breakfast.

I make something very similar with leftover chili and refrigerated biscuit or crescent roll dough. Sooooooo good!

Tastes like BBQ sauce.  Save yourself some work and just pour a bottle of BBQ sauce down your throat.

These were big hits. I too had too much filling, so I used a 10 pk of flaky biscuts...and divided them to fill all 12 muffin cups, that worked perfectly.
Definatly will make again!

My 5 year old daughter sat down to dinner and was really excited for muffins, then when she realized it wasn't she got very sad. After I made her try a bite she asked me to put the recipe in her personal cookbook because she loved them.  My picky husband went back for seconds. Very good recipe as written! Thank you!

This is one of the few recipes that everyone in the family likes, and easy to make, to boot. I couldn't find any 10 oz. packages of biscuit dough; all the store had were the 16 oz. jumbo biscuits, which took up a lot more room in the muffin tin. I ended up with quite a bit of leftover meat because of that. I think next time, if I have to use the jumbo biscuits again, I'll try splitting each biscuit in half so I have a thinner layer of dough. 

One and a half cups of BBQ sauce was probably a bit much; it left the meat too liquidy. The Uglies are perfect for garnishing with a dollop of sour cream or some cilantro after baking. It's easy to tweak the meat sauce, too; I added some chopped bell pepper that I lightly sauteed with the beef for a bit of crunch. My youngest daughter suggested adding some bacon next time.

This is a pretty good, basic recipe with a fun concept. Personally, they were a little too sweet for my preference and a little lacking in other flavors. I am sure the BBQ sauce can make a huge difference in how these turn out though. I thought my husband would like them since he tends to like "child friendly" foods, but he was pretty indifferent. I will probably try this recipe again with some modifications to personalize it to our tastes.

These are great and we have had them a few times. Used only 1 cup of BBQ sauce and 1 cup of cheese to reduce calories and they were still overflowing and delicious!

These were really yummy. Made exactly as stated other then used less cheese as my dad isn't a big fans. They lived up to the name of uglies but were truly tasty. Have give me a good jumping off point for other similar ideas

Tasted just like what mom used to make when I was little (we called them Bar-B-Cups).  I think that next time I will make them more grown up by substituting chopped brisket for the ground beef, Monterrey or jalapeno jack for the cheddar and add chopped green onions.  Yummy

These were great! I used a small, mini biscuit set (about 1.5 inches across), and rolled them really thin, until they were similar to pie crusts. I also mixed the cheddar in with the meat mixture, then topped them with more cheddar and an italian cheese mix. They turned out wonderful! Made about 10 pieces.

Very Delicious; however, I will decrease the amount of bbq sauce next time.  I didn't roll out my biscuits.  I bought the seamless dough sheet! Came out perfect!  This was easy to make after work.  Will definately make it, again.

I made these exactly per directions.  I thought they were just okay.  Nothing great.  I also tried them again with homemade sloppy joe mix and they were much better.  I also tried thick home made chili and they were good also.

My kids loved them, but they eat anything!  I thought they were too BBQy.  I love the concept though!  Next time I will make with spaghetti sauce or taco seasoning!  I usually make an "adult" meal for dinner, so this kid friendly meal was something different and fun for the kids!

My family loved them cuz my girls had fun making them, and my husband had fun eating them!  He thought they were like inside-sloppy joes.  :)  Next time, I'm going to add more garlic powder and use real garlic with the onion.  BBQ sauce is too sweet for me, so I'm going to temper it with cream cheese and green chiles...mmmm!  :)

My son is home from college for a week and it's always a challenge to find him something 'good' to eat while I am at work (spoiled by just grabbing something at the cafeteria or cafe!) These were perfect! He thought they were great and wants to take some back with him!

LOVED this recipe! I ended up making a full dozen and still had meat left over.  I also didn't put as much bbq sauce in, only about 1/2 cup and it was very good.....kids loved it.  Will make again.

Not only good to eat, but fun to make. My 3 1/2 yr old son & I had a blast making the "ugly BBQ pies". It was a perfect solution to a boring, rainy day dinner together! Can't wait to try other ingredients in these yummy little pies.

I tried this because hubby loves bbq and it was simple.  Did not knock our socks off.  Could have been me, maybe I didn't roll the dough out thin enough but hubby said, too much bread not enough meat. I don't like sweet meats so I cannot be a fair judge--I was hoping the cheese would help though.  With that being said, we may try a modified version more along the lines of a casserole doing very thin crust and lots of meat.  A definite consideration because it was so simple and that was per him.  So will probably try my own version.  The other thing hubby said was we used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce....he thought with the bisquits maybe not using such a sweet sauce might help.  I don't know....I have problems judging sweet dishes.  Just an FYI.  If you don't like sweet meats, this isn't the recipe for you. BUT  I can see my grandkids loving this because they love bread and sweets.

My family LOVED these!!! Even my picky kids They were quick and easy and had a great flavor. I had the cheap canned bisquits (10 per can) and they were to small to close at the tops. So if you are wanting to close them I sugguest buying the bigger ones like the "grands" bisquits. I am going to the grocery tomorrow and getting some eggs sausage green peppers and more cans of bisquits and make a batch of breakfast style ones and freeze them for the kids in the morning before school. Am also contemplating a chilli or taco version and using ground turkey for a low cal twist. Also if I had a mini muffin pan these would be great appitizers for parites! this is going in my recipie book for sure!!!

These were okay. I'm not sure I would make again.  I ended up using canned sloppy job mix and a mixed style of shredded cheese.  I might try to make again with a different type of filling.

OMgosh! Haven't tried them yet but LOVE the concept! Will use SAUSAGE and GRAVY and take others advice and cover with dough also (at least for the sausage gravy ones). Love the idea of plopping the biscuit in pan and shaping with fingers and using mini muffin pan idea for bit sized uglies!  loved the reviews thanks all!

These were really fun to make! They were pretty easy (with the exception of folding the biscuit over on top- that part was kind of messy) and very flavorful.  Although they are not the most sophisticated flavors, they were tasty and also fun to eat :)  I would use this as a starter recipe for other flavors, too.  Next time I might try to use Italian sausage for the meat, with spaghetti sauce, topped to mozarella! I could also see them as little philly cheese steaks or mini shepherd's pies!

I have a soggy food hatred...lol...so I was VERY skeptical about this one.  But when I made these, at my childrens request, I rolled the biscuit dough very thin and folded the excess over the top of each cup thus making a really nice crispy crust on the top and the sides were thin enough that they held up but weren't thick enough to get soggy.  Made it not quite so ugly and you could easily brush it with some egg white to make it look even nicer.  All in all very surprised by the simplicity and taste on this one, kids devoured them, and relatively cheap to make, so that warrents the big three and a keeper recipe for this crew!

LOVE IT!  I did change it up a little though.  I went a little TEX MEX with it and added half a can of tomato sauce, cumin, corn, and pinto beans.  It was a hit!  I added a little dollop of sour cream to the top of each one and watched them disappear.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was a huge hit with my family.  I made a few changes though.  Instead of beef, I used shredded pork and one of the reviewers recommended using Sweet Baby Ray’s Brown BBQ sauce (I used the award winning sauce).   I used the handi-foil pot pie pans and got the big size biscuits.  My husband gave me a 10 for both presentation and taste!   I will definitely make these again.  They were not only easy, but fun to make!  Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe.    :):):)

I have made these several times and I  give them 5 stars!  These are always a big hit in our house.  My BF and son both loved them!  I even made them for football watch parties, and our company loved them.  They are named "Uglies" for a reason though!  Tasty though!  Some say these freeze well, but we never have any left over long enough to freeze!

I would have given it 4 stars, but the rest of the family didn't care for them. There was enough meat mixture to make double the amount. I would either decrease the ground beef to 1/2 lb. or use 2 packages of biscuit dough. If I try this recipe again, I will try using chicken.

i did rate this 4 stars, but I can't really say this particular recipes is good or not, because I didnt follow the recipe.  However, I did springboard off the idea of it.  I used:  barbequed pork (from in a bowl near the deli section in the grocery store), layered on top chopped onions, then some corn kernels, then shredded cheddar cheese.  for the biscuit dough, i smushed it flat with my palms instead of rolling it out, then sprinkled with garlic powder, salt and pepper.  after i pinched together the tops of the biscuits after filling them in the tins, I brushed with melted butter and more garlic powder.  hope all that makes sense.  my hubbie and i liked them.  my advice...have fun with the idea of it and put in it what you like. :)

instead of rolling out bisquits,I used pills. grands and made a indentation with a glass in the center and brushed it with egg yolk and then filled it with the meat ,bake it 12 min. @ 375.I didn`t need to clean any pans except cookie sheet.My husband had just said now he knows why he`s getting so fat.

As another person posted, just plop the biscuits into the muffin tins and form a well.  Very easy & very tasty.  The bbq sauce is what makes them--we love using Sweet Baby Rays.  YUM!!!  :)

My sister-in-law made these for our wedding brunch, we loved them! She felt bad for making something called "uglies" lol but I really wanted to try these. So I have never actually made these but they seem easy enough to make - but I know they're delicious :)

I didn't follow the recipe, but instead took advice from others reviewers. I used the biscuits as stated in a muffin pan, but browned the ground beef in taco seasoning and topped with cheddar jack cheese. They turned out pretty good with some sour cream on top. I would rate the taco version a 4 star recipe because of the ease and quickness. I just wanted to let others know about this as an option.

These were very easy to make, which is a plus for this recipe.  I modified this a little, using taco seasoning instead of bbq sauce (since that's what I had in the house).  My family loved them - I think they would be a great 'make ahead' meal, as the leftovers are splendid.

I had a hard time choosing if this was a 3 or 4 star recipe. It was easy and my kids loved it, but it wasn't amazing. It was pretty tasty too! Even cold te next day. I look forward to playing with this recipe! Italian? Taco? Chili? Fun!

I don't buy the refrigerator biscuits, so I tried this recipe with a regular baking powder biscuit recipe.  I simply placed unbaked biscuit on the bottom of the muffin pan, then added ground chuck with onion (we were out of BBQ, so I used a chili seasoning packet to flavor), then a layer of cheddar and monterey jack cheese.  YUM!

We also call these Barbecups! I make with the GRANDS (butter) biscuits, use Honey BBQ Sauce (we don't add onions or garlic); make sure the sauce/meat is 'wet' with sauce before putting into oven. Sometimes I add yellow corn. I don't rool out, just smash with fingers to fit into muffin tin, add the meat mixture and with shred. Mex. Cheese blend. This is a MUST have for Halloween Night, the kids can grab and run out the door for their trick-or-treating!

LOVE THESE!!!!! My family agreed that this was a wonderful, tasty recipe.....and the name fits perfectly. The only changes I made to the base recipe was using cresent rolls dough and making the "uglies" a little bigger/thicker. I didn't even need to use muffin cups and they held together in the muffin pan just fine. 
 The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is due to the fact they are very ugly. :)

These were very easy.  I used sweet baby rays bbq sauce. I ended up using two cans of biscuits and still had meat left over.  They tasted great and everyone in the family enjoyed them.  I will surely be making these again.

The bbq sauce i used was masterpiece, and I usually like it, but there was way too much. They were overbearing and not very exciting. However these would be great if  you add pizza sauce in place of the bbq sauce and mozzarella on top, like mini pizzas. Also you could add taco meat with cheddar then topped with sour cream. 
Or use eggs, bacon and cheese for breakfast. This is a good starter recipe and fun for kids.

So delicious!!!! I used French Onion soup mix instead of BBQ Sauce. I also made homemad biscuits, stuffd the meat in the center while it was was uncooked, then baked it all at once. The biscuits baked up and around the meat creating a neat little "tart" looking thing. SO YUMMY!!! And not so ugly this way ;-) This recipe has LOTS of potential with all kinds of creative and different additives. MMM-Good!

Way too much BBQ sauce, too overpowering, and i'm one that's known to love to put extra flavor on things, this just had too much, otherwise it was good, has potential once you fix it.

The refrigerator biscuits have a ton of saturated fat in them.  Not tasty enough for me to overlook the artery-clogging factor!

These were okay. Kind of messy to make, and not particularly  delicious. I would probably classify them as a snack or lunch, rather than dinner. Kind of awkward to eat.

Well, the name's accurate - they're not pretty - but the flavor was actually pretty good. We used a spicier BBQ sauce and it almost tasted like chili. Only problem was the need to use two biscuits per muffin cup - one each was just not working.

These uglies are so freaking delicious!!! My family absolutely love them. I made them for a party and they were a big hit. I cut the dough into about quarters for the party and it was just the right amount. I would definitely make these again and again.

I have to agree--these may not be a very pretty presentation, but they are wonderful!  When I lived somewhere else, I use to love the barbequed beef & cheese sandwiches from a local ice cream place.  They were a regular Friday treat for me.  These are very close to that taste, and I suspect the trick might be finding just the perfect barbeque sauce for these.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We've always called these Jackpots. We vary the sauce and fillings. I like a taco version with lettuce, salsa and sour cream.

I've done something like these before, but with chicken, etc. But these made with BBQ were quite tasty. Though I did have to add more BBQ. We like our sauce and flavors here. :) Thanks for the grand idea. Love it.

Very Yummy. I'm not a big fan of the BBQ sauce version but my husband enjoyed them. I took the advice of other reviewers & used taco seasoning with Mexican cheese for some of them. I tried it with the Pillsbury 7 1/2oz package of 10 biscuits. It was impossible to stretch each one out that big, so the next day I used 2 biscuits for each & it was much easier. I only used about a 1/4 of the meat for one package of biscuits. I also didn't need as much cheese as the recipe calls for. The 5 stars are because of the endless possibilities. Thank you for submitting this recipe and thank you to all of the reviewers!!!

I took the advice of the Taco comment and made this with 1lb ground beef, taco seasoning packet, 1/2 can black beans and Mexican shredded cheese. My husband put some sour cream on top of his. Delicious!  I rated this a four because it was too much bread.  Next time I will use half a biscuit for each one.  This was a hit at my house!

I love this idea, but when I made my Uglies I took a different breakfast route. I filled the biscuit cup with cooked hamburger, potatoes o'brian and then poured egg substitute over it and topped with cheese. It was really good and now I want to try this barbeque dinner version!

So easy but yummy!  I made 8 uglies out of 1/2 lb of hamburger.  My hubs liked them too.  Something about the flavor of the bbq beef in the biscuits.. baked up perfect in 15 minutes.  I'll make these again when I need a quick dinner.

I made this with some meat we had left over from philly cheesesteaks. I added onion, red bell peppers, and 2 garlic cloves. I also used Grands Biscuits from Pillsbury. My family LOVED them! I plan on working these in as a regular on my menu. Oh, and I have a convection oven and only needed to bake them for 9 min.

Sorry this one didn't pass the family taste test.  However, if I omitted the onions, it might have worked.  Love the ease of the recipe though.  Thanks!

they were pretty much just what i expected. very easy, fairly ugly and the kids liked them. I can't imagine this recipe feeding 8, because my sons wanted several...
Sort of like having a football snack for dinner, but if you add the salad as suggested I guess that makes it more complete. will probably make again, but will increase recipe depending on how many people are eating.

When I first saw this recipe I thought what kind of name is Uglies, I decided to make these and they were great, I followed the recipe as directed only one change, instead of using garlic powder I used minced garlic.  This is a keeper and this weekend I will buy some cherry pie filling to fill in the cups, I think that you can fill these cups with different ingredients and they freeze well. THANKS :)

Very easy, my kids absolutely love them. The sauce makes a difference, make sure you use one you like. The dough loses something when you reheat left-overs, but the insides are still very good.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe. it was really easy to make and the kids had fun helping to make them - plus they enjoyed the silly name. I plan to make again with different meat fillings like sloppy joe or taco.

I thought the bbq taste was overwheming. I don't dislike BBQ sauce, but using 1 1/2 cups was way too much. I guess if I make this again I will try the Mexican ingredients (seasoning in the meat, maybe some corn mixed in) and top with cheese, tomatos and sour cream. I think I would like that more. Oh, I made a change to this recipe. I used the round croissant dough instead of biscuts. Also, I used Sweet Baby Ray's Chipotle BBQ sauce.

If you like sloppy joes, you will like these. I personally am not a fan of BBQ sauce so I plan to try this with a condensed soup mixture or taco mix next time. My husband who loves BBQ said they were good. Its a very good idea for changing up the traditional ground beef dinner though! Can't wait to try some new ways to use this idea. Thanks!

These are awesome! My hubby and I love them. He loves to take them to work and even eat them cold. For those with issues of having too much filling leftover, I use the package of biscuit dough with 10 biscuits (instead of 8). The amount is perfect!

We really liked these! Very easy and quick since it doesn't have to bake long. I read the review where a person says they do not roll the biscuit out-they just put the biscuit in the muffin cup. I would not do this. Following this method I had a good bit of the filling leftover, I think if I had rolled it out like the recipe said I would have used it all. On the other hand, following the non-rolling out method one might be able to buy 2 tubes of biscuits and use all their meat mixture and have more yummy "uglies" to enjoy. Very good and will make again!

I made these for Fathers Day for my dad, husband, and 2 and 4 year old sons. I made this recipe and the one with taco seasoning instead of BBQ sauce. Everybody enjoyed them. We will absolutely make these again. Thanks for a fast, easy, and fun dinner idea!

These were good and so easy to make. I did fill them with something other than Bar-B-Que though. I actually used another recipe from this site for Loose Meat instead and added the cheddar to the filling. They were still very tasty and I've already thought of many other fillings to try with these little mini-pies. Thanks so much for this recipe.

These are DELICIOUS! Definitely craveable. I followed the recipe to a T. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce. They turned out soooo fantastic. Everyone loved them. Definitely making again! If I could give this 5 stars more than once I would! Even my picky 2 year old ate some! Thank you for sharing!!!

My 13 year old son loved these. I had never made anything quite like them.  I didn't have refrigerated biscuit dough on hand, so I used refrigerated croissant dough - it worked just as well.  Really good warmed up the next day, too.

These were so good even though I used homemade  bread dough instead of biscuit dough. I spiced  them up a bit and the son and I  each ate 4 more  than we should of. No leftovers.
Next time I'll make  variety of flavours.  Maybe mushroom soup in some, as well as Italian or oriental seasonings. 
Another bonus is they travel well for lunches. 35 -40 secs in the microwave and they are perfect homemade hot lunch. Better than pizza pockets!

I used a can of biscuits that came with 10 biscuits.  The meat was just the right amount to fill them all up.  I only used about 1 c. of the cheese, I think 2 c. would have been overload.  Loved this recipe.  The kids really liked it, and at my house, that counts for a lot!

This was very easy to make and will probably become a regular dish at our house!  The only thing I would change is to decrease the amount of bbq sauce - I think 1 cup would be plenty!

I am simply amazed at how good this was.  I saved it to my recipe box a while back while looking for ground beef recipes ...I came back to it and thought (why did I save this ...yuck) ... but reading the reviews I decided to make it ...made it last night and all 7 of us in my house LOVED them.  They are so tasty and this a great cheap and easy meal.  I did find that after rolling out the biscuits  15 minutes was a little long , my biscuits were a bit too brown and crisp ...so the next batch I did for 12 and they were perfect .  Will make this many more times!

Yummy! These were a big hit, my picky husband went back for seconds and then more the next day.
I followed the directions with one exception I used spaghetti sauce instead of bbq sauce. I am just not a fan of bbq sauce. I thought these were delicious and they were easy to make. Will defiantly be making again.

These are fun for the kids to help make.  My daughter doesn't like BBQ sauce so I used pizza sauce instead and also put a tator tot in the middle and then sprinkled with cheese.  The kids loved them!

I used a 10pc pkg of biscuits, and had twice as much (if not three times as much) beef leftover, but no biscuits to put it in. This makes more like 20 to 24 pcs, not 8.

Also, very gooey and hard to eat when hot. Also, it's just BBQ flavored beef in a biscuit cup... I don't understand the allure.  I just made them because it says they freeze well, and I love any recipe that freezes well, as I am a supporter of the "cook now, enjoy later" method of cooking.  

But if so many others enjoyed them, I guess the crowd speaks volumes. But it wasnt good, in my opinion, and even my hubby didn't like them, and he's a huge fan of BBQ flavor anything, so disappointed on this one. sorry, just being honest, and just my two cents.

I was pretty impressed, being a non-BBQ sauce fan. I made the following changes: used minced onion instead of regular, used 93% lean regular ground beef and used only 1 cup of BBQ sauce which was plenty. Same time I added the BBQ sauce I added about a 1/3 cup of brown sugar as well. Instead of rolling out the biscuit dough, I just flatted it in the palm of my Pam-sprayed hand. My biscuits came as a tin of 10, and I had plenty of meat to fill them. I also used block sharp cheddar just cut into smaller chunks and put one chunk in each cup. This is a definite keeper - especially since it is the ONLY thing I've ever made with ground beef that my 22 month will eat!

These are a fun 'kid-friendly' food. I made my filling a bit like taco meat instead, topped with sliced olives and cheese, and the family loved them. I am taking the recommendation of another reviewer and making sausage/egg ones for quick reheated breakfasts. Awesome idea!

For you weight watcher's folks, we altered this recipe as follows:  We used 2 lbs. of 93% lean ground beef, 1/2 medium onion, 1/2 diced tomato, 1/2 red bell pepper, and 3 oz. regular barbecue sauce.  Using Pillsbury Grands Golden Layers Buttermilk Biscuits (NOT low-fat) we added 3 oz of meat, and 1/4 oz cheese to each one.  Final tally:  7 points-plus points each!  Highly recommended!

pretty good flavor but not out of this world, but that's expected given the simple ingredients.  Also, the biscuits do not need to be rolled out to 6" diameter - too large.  4-5" round is plenty to reach up sides of cupcake tins

I laughed hysterically when I read this recipe.  I "created" this same thing when I was about ten years old.  Only mine was a giant, sloppy loaf that always fell apart in the oven.  My mom and sister used to love it, though.  I made this neater version for my hubby and son over the weekend.  They loved it too, and it was nowhere near as ugly as the one I used to make!

These were nothing special, sloppy joes in a biscuit.  The buscuit was too thick and after 15 mins in the oven mine were burnt!

These were delicious but with the bbq sauce I used, there were a bit sweet for my liking.  I think next time I will use spicy sausage, pasta sauce and mozzarella cheese instead.

Excellent! I would suggest cutting the beef and barbecue sauce in half - I only used half a lb. to fill the cups and ended up with a whole bunch of extra filling and nothing to do with it. I also added 1 TBS brown sugar, and several heaping shakes of ground chipotle pepper. Very good!

These were great! I used fresh garlic instead of powder, and made fresh biscuit dough (I didn't have the refrigerated stuff in the house) and they turned out perfect.  The whole family enjoyed them.

Made my own biscuits enough for 12 cup muffin tin.  Did it Mexican style with salsa and cilantro in beef topped with Pepper Jack, Manchego and Cheddar mix.  Very good.

Very tasty! EASY too. How about a cream of chicken filling(like a pot pie) or a spaghetti sauce filling with mozzarella cheese topping? Scrambled eggs with  bacon or sausage w/ a cheddar cheese topping would also be a great biscuit cup filling. A mini New England pot roast would be a good filling.....

These are actually called Hamburger Cupcakes. You can season the meat with BBQ, Taco or Red Pasta sauce.

Just saw this recipes this morning and made them for lunch.  My familly really liked them.  They are easy to make, and do not take much time.  I flatted the dough between my hands and made a pocket. I used hickory BBQ sauce and backed them for about 10 minutes.

Simple and easy, be aware that the BBQ you use will be the dominate flavor.  I used famous Dave's sweet and zesty.  Needless to say they turned out too sweet for my taste.  I love the Biscuit idea though, might try filling it with something more to my taste.

I like 'em! I didn't put as much bbq sauce because I ran out, so they did lack the flavor, but I love the different possibilities for fillings.  I want to try ground beef w/ mushrooms and cream cheese, and maybe ham and eggs. I was able to make 16 of them using the same amount of biscuits.

We didn't use the recipe.  We looked at it as a concept and then made it our own.  Using the whole wheat biscuit recipe found on this site, we made our dough (after tweaking it a bit!), and then used what we had on hand.  In our uglies we put carrots, beef, onion, green & red peppers, our homemade BBQ sauce and a bit of mozzarella on top.  These cooking times didn't work for us, but we think that is because we have a small convection oven and it can't run at a high heat.  Our power supply is kinda low (we're living in Japan).    BUT, we love this recipe.  It is super easy and amazingly modifiable!

I gave this recipe four stars because it was so simple to make and to alter.  However, my family didn't really care for the BBQ flavoring in the dish.  We are planning to make these again with pizza sauce and toppings.  We are also going to try a filling of chicken and veggies with cheese.

These taste great! I honestly didn't think they looked that bad. Some of the measurements were a little off. I used 10 biscuits because there was no package that only had 8. I also only used 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese. I would definitely make again. So easy and so good.

very tasty, kid approved, fun to make. we made our own dough and didnt bother flatening the dough to 6 inches. we just laid the dough circles in the muffin pan then pressed the sides up they came out very good and easy to make. next time we will try a breakfast ugly as another review suggested!

Yum! My kids ask for this meal at least once a week. I love it because its so easy to make and the required ingredients are usually on hand. The taste can be slightly changed too by using a different flavor of bbq sauce each time!

These were so yummy. I used only about 2/3 lbs of ground beef. I didn't measure the other ingredients, just guesstimated and the mixture turned out great. There was enough to fill the full muffin tin of 12, so I used 2 packs of biscuits and now I have to figure out what to do with my leftover 4. The kids really enjoyed them, even though it's a bit messy - they are 4 and 2.5 years old.

We tried these one night when I had to make dinner pretty quickly.  They were good.  I thought I might change it up next time I make it and use Sloppy Joes mix instead of BBQ sauce.

Kids & wifey loved it! I am thankful for it but I'll try some tweeking because the BBQ seemed to lack something. The fact that it is so easy to prepare makes this one a winner..

This was a great, easy recipe. My kids loved it! I used Sweet Baby Rays which added a wonderful flavor. I just flattened the biscuits by hand and they were fine. I also sprayed the muffin tin with Pam. I will make this again when I need something quick, easy and inexpensive for dinner.

These were delicious and so easy to make! I didn't roll the dough out, I only flattened the biscuits by hand and followed the procedure to make a cup within the pan. I used small biscuits as they were all I had on hand and it was a little difficult to spread out the dough since there wasn't much to work with. I recommend using Grand Biscuits or another larger biscuit as mine didn't seem to quite hold together as it could have. The barbecue sauce was definitely a different touch and I was a bit skeptic at first (only because I'm not much of a barbecue fan), but it really made the whole thing come together and added a kick to the flavor! Wonderful Recipe! Thank you!

These sure live up to their name!  They are UGLY! My only problem was I followed other reviewers' suggestions and sprayed the muffin pans with cooking spray. I had a terrible time getting the dough to stay put and hold its shape. It kept slipping around and shrinking back down into the tin, so I washed out the muffin tins and started over, lightly greasing them with shortening.  This worked perfectly.  Though not very pretty, they disappeared quickly. Folks were looking for more long after they were gone!

A tasty sloppy joe in a bread bowl with cheese!  Pretty easy and tasty.  Two of these with a side of veggies made for a good medium sized meal.    I tried this the first time with reduced fat wheat grands and they turned out great.  I was thinking of trying them with ground turkey or chicken next time too.

YUM!  This is a great recipe for a quick weeknight dinner.  It was great warmed for leftovers too.  I followed the recipe as printed, except I just pressed the biscuits into the pan (rolling seem like too much work).  Will definitely make again and again.

I liked the idea of these but I'll use different filling next time. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and that's all you could taste even though I didn't use the whole 1 1/2 cups.

Excellent recipe and really easy to make.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I think that the right BBQ sauce can make or break these.  I really liked the Kraft Hickory BBQ Sauce, if you are only eating one or maybe two of them...more than two and it gets a little tangy but later has a great after taste.  I would say that the recipe really needs to suggest the right BBQ Sauce...it will become 5 stars as soon as I figure out the best BBQ sauce...trying KC Masterpiece next time.

Really good, easy and normally have all items on hand for quick meal. I had to scramble last night to make dinner for DH when I found out I didn't have everything on hand for the planned meal, so I busted these out quickly and he really enjoyed them. He said "So these are like sloppy joes with biscuits and cheese?" and I was like NOO!! Wait... uhh yeah I guess! LOL! These will get thrown into the rotation for an easy dinner night. I added some mustard and worschteshire sauce to the BBQ for extra flavor.

They make a great lunch or fast dinner.  I make a version for camping Using chicken.  I dice up a couple of chicken breasts and some potatos and lightly fry then I add green chili enchilada sauce and let it simmer for about 5 minutes; after adding it to the bisquit I cover it on cheese.

What a great concept!!  I changed it up a bit, just to suit mine and my boyfriends taste.  I used a burrito meat mixture instead of the bbq, and I used the frozen pilsbury grands (thawed)instead of the canned (they taste sooo much better).  Thank you so much for the recipe!!

I had some refrigerator biscuits that I didn't know what to do with, and decided to try this recipe.  For being so simple, this tasted much better than expected.  I used a mixture of ground pork and venison for the meat, and subbed fresh minced garlic (1 1/2 tsp.) for the garlic powder.  Used Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy BBQ sauce and Pillsbury Grands.  I also only used about 1 c. of shredded cheddar, and that was plenty, and had a bit of the meat mixture left over.  My 19 month old, who has been a picky eater lately, even ate some!  I'm sure we'll make this again, since it was very kid-friendly.  I think it might be fun to cut the biscuits up and use a mini muffin tin for appetizers.

Excellent concept.  I can see many possibilities for variations.
I suggest not using a too sweet BBQ sauce, though.  I'm going to try the Italian version as someone posted below.

I'm reviewing the recipe, not the concept. 
As one reviewer stated, there is no reason to roll out the biscuits. Just pick your favorite brand and plop it into a greased muffin tin. My mom gave me this recipe when I moved out on my own. She called them bbq cups. I think she snipped it from a Good Housekeeping magazine in the early 70s. She let us "help" with dinner and during the prep of this meal our job was to press the biscuit dough against the edges of the cup, creating a well for the meat. 
Now grown, the meat is usually ground beef in our home, but occasionally I will jazz up the hamburger and throw in leftovers from the fridge. My husbands favorite combo is when when I chunk in some leftover bbq brisket in with the hamburger. 
The addition of onion in this recipe earned it another star. But 2 cups is really too much cheese. I'd go with 1 - 1 1/2 cups. Often times I will use a pepperjack or sharp cheddar to counter the sweetness of the bbq sauce.

I thought they were good - and my family loved the name of the little things, but I had a hard time getting the bisquits to roll out big enough.  I thought I had read a review that said not to buy the "grands", but I think it would work better with those.  Still tasty!  I only used about a cup of BBQ sauce.  I'll make them again!

My mom made these (BBQ cups) for me when I was little.  My family loves them.  I have also made them with Italian bulk sausage, pizza sauce and mozzarella.  We call them Pizza Cups then.

These are great...Very easy and quick to make...I added a bit of cheese to the meat mixture as well.  I have also made these "Italian style" with spaghetti sauce in stead of barbecue sauce and Italian blend cheese in place of cheddar.  They were fabulous!!

Fantastic! I made these with bacon, egg, jalpeno and cheese. It was so easy. Everyone loved them, the only problem was I didn't make enough.

This was very good.  I didn't add onions (only had onion powder) and it was still good.  I eyeballed the BBQ sauce so I am not sure how much i put in but would guess a cup - enough to moisten but not make it runny.  Finally, don't like processed food so made my own biscuits - was very easy - put two cups flour, 2 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp salt in food processor.  Mixed it up.  Added 6tbl cold butter mixed until butter was ground up and then added 3/4 cup buttermilk.  turned dough out and rolled into square.  Cut eight pieces out and voila - tasty tasty!!

As a novice cook, this was easy to make. (hint: use a spoon to remove after cooking and cooling). Love the concept but the taste/ingredients did not work for me. I will make again , but will use chili instead and perhaps top off with sourcream.

A GREAT TWIST ON WHAT TO DO WITH HAMBURGER.  EASY AND FLAVORFUL. WE MADE EXTRA FILLING AND USED IN A STORE PREPARED PIE CRUST.  BAKED WITH THE MUFFIN CUPS AND BOTH WERE JUST DELICIOSOUS.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE.

Absolutely wonderful! My husband said they should be called "preeties"  :)  they looked so cute! I made two changes though - added mushrooms to the ground beef and cut off on BBQ sauce. Other than that - same day fresh or next day reheated they were absolutely delicious! Thanks a lot for the recipe!

Sorry, for our family this was barely edible. I think myself and hubby were the only ones who finished it. NONE of the kids did. I did exactly as recipe said. Don't think I will make this again. Oh, and the BBQ sauce I used was Sweet baby Rays, which is my one sons favorite, adn he still didn't even eat half of it.

These are awesome, but we make them like pizzas with just ground beef and spaghetti sause, then cheese and top w/ pepperonis. We don't roll them out either, just put the biscits in the muffin pan and make a 'well' to put the meat in! Delicious! :)

this was hit with the whole family. I didn't have muffin tins so I made this by layering in a casserole dish and it worked great plus it was less work this way.  I will make this again.

This was okay when looking for something different to make.  I guess I used smaller biscuits, so it was much harder to roll it out enough to fill the muffin tin.  As suggested I used less BBQ sauce and just seasoned the beef well with garlic and onion powder, worchestershire sauce, ect.  It paired well with mashed potatoes.

WE made these for breakfast using eggs, onion and turkey sausage. My kids loved them.  But the rolling out was time consuming. My little chefs were frustrated. Next time I think we will just plop the bisciut in and fill.  Defintely a kid pleaser

I made a few changes to the recipe like adding a little less bbq sauce and added some tomato basil salad dressing to the meat and instead of using the bisquits i used crescent rolls. I unrolled them and on a pizza stone i arranged them in a circle. With the wide end in the middle overlapping the next a little bit then put the meat and onion mixture over and then put the cheese on top and then rolled the rest of the crescent roll over the meat and cheese and then baked it came out very good the only thing is that when they are done they dont really look like uglies! Much better looking if you would like to serve at a gathering.

Different, fun, especially for the kids, and pretty tasty.  I totally underestimated how long it would take to roll the dough out.  That really extends the preparation time.  This is nothing fancy--certainly--but definitely worthwhile if you are looking for a fun and unusual idea for lunch or a good snack.

These are really good. Great for kids learning to cook to fix. I used store brand buttermilk biscuits which come 10 to a can. I used onion powder about 1/2 tsp and was out of garlic powder so I used garlic salt instead, and a mix of Sweet Baby Rays and Head Country BBQ sauces that were open in the fridge.  They were really saucey, so maybe you could cut down the sauce by a quarter cup? The Hubster devoured two of these for lunch and raved over these!

This was a favorite of the men at a recent appetizer party. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ and added a little apple cider vinegar. I like Annie's organic biscuits from the refrigerator section. I didn't use as much cheese as called for.

Absolutely Wonderful! The flavor is very good, and cooking it filled my house with a delightful aroma. We had tons of extra beef left over-- maybe a third of the pound.

Delicious!  I used both biscuits and croissants; both worked brilliantly. I made my own bbq sauce and used carne asada instead of ground beef, which made them seem more main dish than side dish or snack.  These were very tasty.

Delicious and quick.  We substituted BBQ sauce with a batch of tomato sauce with mushrooms and kidney beans and did a second batch substituting with cream of mushroom soup.  It was a great meal!

Turned out great. Cheese a little too brown. One cup of BBQ sauce would be plenty. Next time will wait 10 minutes or so to put cheese on. Will make again

My wife and I made these and though they were wonderful.  Next time we make them we will probably do sloppy joe meat instead of BBQ because we feel that the flavors would go together better.

These were really good. But too sweet. I agree with one reviewer that said 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce is enough...1 1/2 cups is way too much. Otherwise good!

I make these as well, but faster and a bit healthier.  I include some small diced and sautéed onions and carrots for veg and just roll out the biscuit and make these into hand pies.  Fewer things to wash and they freeze flatter so easier to store in batches.
We also make pulled port often and this recipe translates to shredded port very well.

The family all gave it a thumbs up.   I used 1/2 c of BBQ sauce,  and I sauteed some mushrooms that I had on hand and some corn as someone had suggested.   I have to use innovative ways to get veggies in.   This was very good and easy.

I made these per the recipe, and found them pretty good. Quick, easy meal (with some veggie sides). I kept a close eye on them while cooking, (I was starving, and it's a well-known fact that staring at food makes it cook faster.) and did end up taking them out of the oven early as the biscuits started to burn. I had leftover filling, and used it the next day on a sandwich, and much preferred that to the biscuits. Personal preference :)

I ended up with WAY more stuffing than biscuit cups.  I could have bought twice as many  biscuits and filled them all up.  Tasted very good!

These weren't a hit at our house. Grandson liked the leftover meat with cheese on top but not so much baked in the bread.  The meat was kind of lost in the bread.  My husband wasn't thrilled either. Would have preferred an actual burger on a bun with BBQ sauce.

I have so much fun with this recipe. It's so simple that you really can mess around with it.  I made the original I call it the ugly Chuck. Then made the ugly Greek. Ground lamb, pine nut, spinach and feta. The ugly Italian (italian sausage meat and tomatoes). The ugly hunter (venison and mushrooms).  I think I'm going to try making a chicken or turkey one next. Call it the ugly duckling or something like that. The kids like the names and they eat things that they wouldn't normally eat because the word "ugly" is in front of it. I don't know how that makes mushrooms more appealing to them but I'm not going to question it.

10.26.16 ~ a good quick dinner to pull together for a weeknight meal. I had a package of cooked beef in the freezer that I used for this recipe. Make sure you use a bbq sauce that you really like in this recipe. This time I used Rib Rack® Campfire Cider BBQ Sauce and it was delicious. Served this with 'Dijonnaise Potatoes' from AR.

So we took the idea behind this recipe , the biscuit cups, and put our own spin on it. Instead of Hamburger and onions we used Chorizo and eggs, they were a bit greasy, but overall awesome.

These were appropriately named, fast and easy, and tasted good.  Very good for picky kids; mine was intrigued by the name (and it gave him the bravery to overlook the sight of these).  I also enjoyed the fast preparation, and definitely recommend these for a quick, kid-friendly weeknight dinner.

This recipe is a great base recipe. Took this recipe and switched up a few things. As these little cups of goodness are easy to freeze we made a lot.

We added mixed frozen veggies [peas, carrots, corn (approx 3 cups)] because it needed some veggies. Used an Alfredo sauce. You could try any of the following; Philadelphia cream sauce, can of mushroom soup, can of celery or can of chicken for saucing.
Loved that these were like chicken pot pie, but easier and in individual size portions. Delicious.

Super great weeknight meal. I add a can of corn to the filling, just so I can pretend it's a complete meal (protein, starch, and veggie).

I followed the recipe exactly (unfortunately didn't read reviews first).  Way too much BBQ sauce--too saucy for even my husband.  I'd cut it back to 1/2 or 3/4 cup instead.  The kids liked the "mini pot pies" so I think I'll keep the idea but try variations.  Seems like these would be great with veggies and gravy instead of BBQ sauce.

Made these tonight, they were pretty good. I didn't have biscuits on hand but I had crescent rolls, so I just used those. I also had filling left over, so for the last 4 I used a roll out pie crust I had, both worked fine and tasted great. I didn't measure the bbq sauce, just added enough to make the meat moist  Thank you

Delish & pretty easy! Used my own bisquet recipe and would probably use 3/4 to 1 cup of BBQ sauce next time, a little too much for me.

Love it. I changed the BBQ sauce to 1 1/2 cup brown gravy. Not a BBQ sauce fan.  Am trying again with Bisquick, my biscuits expired. Thanks for sharing!

These were good, but not great. They tasted a lot like sloppy Joes. We might do them again with a different sauce  - the BBQ  sauce made them too sweet.

My girls loved these. The only thing I did different was I could not find my cupcake pan so I baked the biscuits like normal and then just opened them up like a hot sandwich and sprinkeled cheese on it.

Made these last night and made a few changes. I only put 3/4c BBQ sauce. 1 1/2c seemed like too much. I was right because they were good with less. I also bought a four pack of refrigerated biscuits (10 in a pack) and ended up making 18 due to the meat mixture that was left over after making 10. I also did not have 2c of cheese so just sprinkled what I had on top. These were yummy!

The only way to make these better would have been if I hadn't forgotten to drain the grease. I planned on using a 10 count tube of jumbo buttermilk biscuits and had too much filling leftover so good thing I also had a 5 count tube of jumbo buttermilk biscuits and used them up too. Great for leftovers too.

Easy recipe that tastes amazing. One suggestion I would have is don't use a sweet BBQ sauce. I used a honey BBQ sauce and the sweetness became overbearing. I think a smoky hickory BBQ sauce would do much better. I also did not roll out the biscuits, just stretched them out by hand and they did just fine.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I liked the combination of the sweet meat, the light and fluffy crust, and the cheese just topped it off.  I only had one large cupcake pan so I made a few flat on a cookie sheet.  The ones in the cupcake pan were out of this world!  I took two to work the next day.  My secretary tried to eat one of them herself!

This was so-so. It reminded me of sloppy Joe's. I used half ground turkey and half ground sausage because I didn't have a full pound of ground turkey on hand. I also added chopped green pepper and only used a cup of bbq sauce. It was easy to prepare but I doubt I'll make it again. I would think it would taste better with some beef tips or flank steak pieces instead with a gravy type sauce.

Delicious!  Yes, they're ugly.  But very good!  I couldn't find a single can of the regular biscuits (only 4 packs & didn't want that many) so I used a can of Grands.  We like BBQ sauce, but I thought 1 1/2 cups seemed like way too much for us, so I ended up using about 1 cup.  Perfect.  I also went easy on the cheddar but the family actually wanted more of that.  Overall, it's a great, family-friendly, adjustable recipe.

Very good recipe!  We made it with ground turkey and the recipe was a hit!  I also sealed the the crust and topped it with extra cheese.  Next time I think we'll brush olive oil on the top.

Kid friendly recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I make these with leftover bbq pulled pork. I just flatten the bisquits some with my hand, no need to roll with flour. Very yummy and quick.

We love these. I did add a can of green chilis and tomato, and some brown sugar to the mixture. we also used homemade biscuit dough which I think helps.

Made these the other night and my kids said how gross they looked...that made me laugh because of the name.  Of course, they loved them.  I didn't use as much BBQ sauce as called for and did cut the biscuits in half. This made for fast, easy and delicious meal.  Will definitely be making these again.

These were good for something quick and different.  I made some with leftover shredded pork and some with chorizo sausage.  Used shredded mexican cheese blend on some and goat cheese on others.  Favorite was shredded pork with goat cheese.  I also divided the flaky biscuit dough in half (layers) and they were just right.

These are surely ugly but the kids and husband liked them. I wasn't too sure about the sweet ground beef mixture and biscuit dough combo. The taste and texture kind of threw me off. Used KC Masterpiece for the bbq sauce.

These were an easy and delicious weeknight meal. I wish I had two more biscuits though, I stuffed each of 8 full and had a little leftover meat and sauce mix that I just *had* to eat by spoon.

College son LOVES these, easy for him to make. I prefer using leftover taco meat (brown beef, add half a jar salsa and simmer til liquid absorbed) Don't use Grands, smaller biscuits are better, dont grate cheese,too messy, just lay a chunk on top,serve with sour cream.YUM!

These were okay.  Simple to make but I think I would've liked it better with a pie crust in each one.  The biscuits made them way to heavy.

I liked these, but I think the recipe was a bit flawed. There's no way you need an entire pound of meat, 1.5 cups of sauce, etc unless you're making 50 of these. I pretty much quartered the recipe and had more than enough for 2 people. 

I also added some veggies (peas, corn, carrots, string beans) and only had to bake for 12 minutes. I'd make these again. They made for a quick and tasty dinner.

Followed the recipe as written. My husband and I were not too crazy about it. The cheese just does not go with barbeque sause. I will try other suggestions and try a taco version of this.

Delicious!  I followed one person's suggestion of using taco seasoning, with some fresh chopped tomatoes, sour cream and taco sauce on top.  A hit!  Husband loved them (he had 4, but I'm cutting him slack since he was outside all afternoon moving hay bales) and so did our daughter!  Ugly...and a keeper!!

Absolutely great!! My husband loved these!! The only thing I did different was use onion powder instead of onion. 15 minutes was also a little bit too long. Can't wait to try again! We are gonna change it up and try it with taco seasoning next time. Loved it!

These were excellent. And yes, they are ugly lol but very tasty. I did not use as much BBQ sauce as the recipe called for though. I will definitely make them again!

This recipe was awesome!  My husband and toddler loved them.  I didn't roll the biscuits, but just flattened them between my palms.  Because of that, I didn't get as much filling in each cup, so I was able to make more (another entire roll of biscuits).  They freeze and reheat wonderfully.  My son thought they looked like cupcakes, so he decided he was getting a "special treat"!!  I will add these to the regular line-up.

Very tasty, but I wish I could find a way to make them less time consuming. Flattening out those biscuits takes a lot of time. If you sandwich them in seran wrap, it helps with them sticking to your rolling pin. One with a side salad is an excellent lunch!

Yep.  They're ugly, but OH MY they are yummy!  Tried them out on my hubby and sister, and they LOVED it!  We're trying them again in a few days with eggs and sausage....then maybe again with chicken!  Yum!

I made these last night for the first time, exactly to the recipe and they are GREAT. My only change is I would call them "messies" instead of uglies. :)

These were good!  I made some changes though. Used Sloppy Joe sauce instead of BBQ and I added 1/2 finely diced onion, two diced jalepenos, 2 cloves minced garlic and salt, pepper. Simmered all together for 10 minutes, then stuffed the "muffins" ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP then added just a little cheese on top.  They were pretty good!  Served with mashed potatoes and veggies.

Thank you for sharing the recipe...it is a great basis for so many other things.  I tried what another reviewer said with eggs and sausage...so good.  I also just made a well in the biscuit for the filling and turned out great.

Very good and easy to make. The reason for the 4 stars is because I find that I have way too much meat mixture left over. Had to use the extra meat mixture with regular buns.

Edible, but not that great, really.  Filling was good but if I make again I would use a different type of biscuit -- maybe a flaky one.  Maybe rolling in flour did it.   Biscuit was very dry and despite following temp and time, bottoms were burned.

These should be called YUMMIES!  Great recipe.  I had to modify on the spot:  I made a Mexi version of the bbq version here.  I used salsa instead of bbq sauce and crescent rolls instead of biscuits.  Topped with cilantro.  My family LOVED these.  I thought these were very attractive, not ugly at all.  Yum, can't wait to make these again - I can see this adapted in lots of neat ways -  with scrambled eggs & sausage, sloppy joe version, chili version, etc.  Thanks for a fun and yummy recipe.

Used the Trader Joe's refrigerated biscuit and bbq brisket...so easy!  The whole recipe took no time at all to put together; the 5 minutes to roll out the biscuit dough was the longest preparation step.  Topped each biscuit cup with already cooked brisket, sprinkled cheddar cheese, and popped them in the oven.  Easy, delicious, fast, my kind of dinner!  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this and loved it. I think it has a lot of room for additions and changes though. I tried it the way it calls int he recipe. I also tried it with ground sausage, egg, cheese. And just today I made used just sausage and topped them with sausage gravy. I'm going to be serving these at my wedding (which has a breakfast theme dinner)

These were great. Though my 5 y/o didn't eat hers, but that is not surprising with how she eats. The only thing we didn't like was i think the flavoring on our barbeque sauce I used was Honey flavored and the hubby didn't like it much. Will definatly try it again with different sauce.

Loved these and yes, they are ugly, but taste so good.  I used taco seasoning with onions also.  My family loved them...no leftovers.  Will make for our next ladies breakfast w/sausage & eggs.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I used minced onion and onion powder in place of the chopped onion.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and added a bit of extra garlic powder and onion powder as well as salt and pepper and Louisiana hot sauce to tone down the sweetness a bit.  I ran out of time making them and had to leave to take my daughter to her band concert so I ate one real quick straight out of the oven before leaving and it was very tasty but unfortunately when we can back home and reheated them they weren't very good.  I think they are best eaten straight out of the oven and not good reheated at all.  My daughter didn't care for them because of the meat being sweet so next time I think I will try them without the barbecue sauce.

My daughter and I made these for dinner last night. The whole family (all 6 of us) enjoyed them. My six year old said this was the best dinner EVER!

AWESOME! THESE ARE GREAT! I put on the orange/white shredded cheese on top. Plus my girls loves honey on biscuits so before i put them in the oven i drizzled just a little bit of honey on top. it was great! I did NOT roll them out to the 6 inches like it said too. I only did about 4 inches across. I also used just the standard size of muffin tins. I sprayed them really good.

Surprisingly simple and good. I made some with BBQ sauce and some plain because I have 2 kids that don't like BBQ. The name does fit the product though - quite ugly.

These were alright.  I guess they were not my taste.  My husband did like them and he is a picky eater.  Just a little bland for me. But, thanks for sharing!

I used pizza sauce instead of BBQ-mozzerella cheese, and threw in a handful of chopped onion and chopped red peppers to the hamburger mixture. I also used "grands" dough. These came out really good, very light and flaky, tasty, not at all what I expected. I am going to make them again this time using taco seasoning and toppings. The filling possibilities are endless!

Perfect serving size to keep things in moderation.  I made a taco version that was very tasty even in leftovers.  I didn't really think these were too ugly.

I followed the recipe exactly but used all 8 biscuits and the meat was still overflowing the cups!! Also I used the Sweet Baby Rays Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce which was yummy!! This was a hit with my teenagers. I will make this over and over again.

These were really good.  I had leftover beef and cheese, but that's ok.  I tried rolling out the dough, but I found I liked doing it with my hands better.  Per other reviewers I used the Sweet Baby Ray's Brown sugar sauce and thought it was a great choice.

These were good and very simple to make.  Hubby liked them more than I did.  Depending on your oven, 15 minutes is a little to long.  They didn't burn but they were more than golden brown!

Not the prettiest things but very tasty!!!! I liked the bbq sauce with the beef. I did add some chopped green pepper just to use it up. I made six like the recipe said and the other two buscuits I just left flattened and topped with the mixture and cheese. I would make these again.

I burnt the cheese the first time I made this but it still turned out great. Sweet Baby Ray's brown sugar BBQ sauce is the best sauce I've found to use with this.

The kids loved these and they loved that they were called Uglies.  The amount of hamburger was perfect to fill the biscuits in the muffin pan.  I did roll out the biscuits to about 1/8th to 1/16th of an inch.  GREAT recipe and a Great change of pace for dinner!

I had enough of the beef mixture to fill 18 small muffins.  My kids really enjoyed these, the husband thought they were so so.  I'll definetely make them again for the kids, but not the adults.  Thanks for sharing!

I had to make my own biscuits, but the family LOVED these.  Excellent and unique dinner recipe! Variations I might try with this as a base are: beef or chicken stew ( less sauce), a sloppy Joe version, a Mexican version with taco seasoning, or a veggie with cream cheese/ rocotta.  Wish there was a better name though, they really aren't that ugly :)

This was a great little treat.  Like many others I had more filling than room for, so I think next time I might cook up less meat and BBQ sauce.  And of course the type of sauce you use can make a difference, but all in all a great little meal.  It already has my brain working on many other things I can add into it for other ideas!  My husband and I called them bite size sloppy joes though..it seemed very appropriate!

I loved these! I only added 1 cup of barbeque sauce and I put some mashed potatoes on the meat then topped it off with a little cheese. YUM! I was worried that the potatoes would dry out but they stayed moist b/c of the BBQ sauce I guess. This one's a keeper!

I love this recipe and so does my family.  I also tweaked it and instead put a can of rotel (drained) in the meat and some cumin and made little mexi uglies... we loved that as well.  So easy to make!

I followed other reviewers advice and cut down on the BBQ sauce, but they ended up really dry.  Kids didn't like them at all, but the hubby ate like 6 of them (although he said he wasn't too impressed).  Very reminicsent of sloppy joes ( or in our case - not sloppy eanough!)

This is a wonderful recipe loved by all ages.  I made this for my family the day after Christmas and they devoured them.  I followed the recommendation from another rater and just dropped the biscuits in the muffin tins, rather than rolling out the dough. Easy and yummy!

I had four testers when I made these for the first time. Two are very picky, one not too picky, and the last on was pretty open.  My test panel are ages 11 to 9 years old.  It was 50/50 split with the little ladies and for me, I loved them.  Will make againg and not change a thing!!!!

These were GREAT! I have 4 boys - all of them with different taste buds and they all enjoyed them. I often have company at my house several times a week and when I do, I try to make a little something for people to eat. The adults loved it, the kids loved it and I even printed out the recipe for someone that evening.

I liked the concept of these a lot. I used Grands biscuits and a lot less cheese. I agree with a previous reviewer who said the type of bbq sauce makes a big difference. Next time I will use a more mild sauce as mine was too tangy for the kids. I may even follow the suggestion of just using sloppy joe mix since I know they like that. I served this with fries and it was a quick simple dinner.

I liked these, and so did my husband. For as easy as they are, they are very tasty. I cut down on the bbq sauce a little (about a cup- I used Sweet Baby Rays). And I just sprinkled with cheese, so it was nowhere near 2 cups. But they were tasty, easy, and I liked that they were single servings ready to go. Great idea- thanks for sharing! Will make again in our house!

My husband and I love this recipe!  My husband says that has all of his favorite things put into one meal!!  These were very easy to make.  Instead of using a muffin pan, I formed each biscuit into a cup-like shape on a cookie sheet, then filled them with the filling.

This is an interesting dish. It's easy to make and any leftovers freeze well. I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce. The barbeque flavor was a little strong so I will reduce the amount of barbeque sauce next time.

Delicious, quick and easy! What more can you ask for? I made my own bbq sauce and cupped the biscuits, instead of rolling them out. A hit with the whole family!

I am rating this a 4 for 'easy to prepare' - my 6 and 11 year old kids helped - and it had good flavor.  My 11 year old would prefer it with taco meat, or my recipe for Sloppy Joes.  My 6 year old would like taco meat, and preferrably not touching the biscuit!  It was a great dinner to have on Halloween, though.  Quick, easy, and very Ugly!

We do a similar recipe using leftover sloppy joe meat (made with manwich) and spread open face on stale hamburger buns. We lay a half slice of cheese on top and bake them until cheese is melted and meat is warmed.  We call them BEEF EATERS and they are well liked.

I wanted to try something different and since I had all the items on hand I gave it a shot. It wasn't bad, but nothing special. Tastes like sloppy joes and next time i think ill just make those instead.

I thought these were okay.  Maybe I will try them again but with shredded chicken and less barbecue sauce.  I don't know, they just didn't seem like a WOW food to me.  Easy to make and cheap but not one of my favorites I guess.  I used the regular sized biscuits, should have used the grands.  It didn't really affect the flavor but I have a ton of meat mixture leftover.  At least enough for one more batch.  Maybe I'll freeze them and use them as party appetizers or something.

I did not enjoy these very much.  The reason it even got two stars is because my 12 year old liked them, but no one else did.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe it would be better without the BBQ sauce, maybe another type of sauce.  I like the idea of the taco seasoning that another reviewer suggested.  I'll try that.

I have to agree, at some point this is just a slightly - graduated school lunch meal.  I was so excited to wake up and make these for my family, only to receive half eaten uglies back with a funny, "sorry love" kinda face.  Barbeque for breakfast?  Oh and there's onions?  It's a great idea, but I would substitute every one of the ingredients next time I make it.  I ended up eating these for lunch everyday for a week just so they wouldn't go to waste.

They weren't as good as i was expecting, but they were still good. I would try them again with sausage as people have reccommended i think the flavors would be much better than the ground beef.  They are very easy to make though, and are a great comfort food.

I loved these! However, I made a few changes.  I started by using Jimmy Dean Maple sausage and sauteed chopped mushroom with the sausage. I still used BBQ sauce, but I think this could be switched with any sauce you choose. I added lots of chopped onions in the mixture as well. The cheese topping could be  changed as well.  I once used a pie pan instead of cupcake pan, but the cupcake pan is better in my opinion.  Have fun with this recipe and play with a few ingrediants.

When I made these, they rose so much in the oven that everything fell out and kinda went all over the place.  Not the best meal I have ever had.

Loved it!  Used Tom's Farms bbq sauce - which may have been what gave it the great flavor.  Will definitely make again.

Loved it! Made them last night and they were a hit. Very easy to make. I used BBQ Sauce with A1 Steak Sauce in it. I think it added an extra kick that made it just right. Thanks a bunch, I will make this again.

These were really good. I didn't have quite enough barbecue sauce (like only 3/4 cup), but that was more than enough for us--the whole amount of KC Masterpiece would have been too much. I didn't have refrig biscuits, so I made a batch of the Bisquick basic recipe. I ended up with 12 instead of 8 and had the perfect amount of filling for all of them. Hubby said this would be a good base for all kinds of fillings, from sloppy joes to beans and franks to leftover taco meat and other leftovers. We might also use this for freeze-ahead meals.. This is a very good foundation for all sorts of yummy stuff.

I used my deep muffin pan, and it still made 10 of these.  My husband loved them.  My kids(5 and 2) enjoyed them too.  Made them up with some tots and we were good to go.  Very simple but tastey for a busy week night!!

I  made this recipe for company yesterday and everyone really liked them.  I used Grands bisquits and cut them in half and formed into mini cupcake tins.  I had made the hamburg mixture the day before and just filled the cups when I was ready to bake. Next time I will use regular bisquits because the Grands are to big and I think the cups will work better using less bisquit.  Will definitely make again

This is an excellent, kid-friendly recipe!  I started out making the recipe as-is, but when I read that I was supposed to add 1 1/2 c. of BBQ sauce, I knew that would be way too much for everyone's taste, so I only add 1/2 c., just enough to coat the meat and give it a nice flavor.  The uglies turned out fantastic, tasted great, and were gobbled up by the kids.  This is a keeper recipe!

Maybe it was the bbq sauce that I used, but these were not good. I think it is a great concept though. You can really use any seasoning for the beef...but I would definately reccommend finding a substitute for the bbq sauce.

I thought this was tasty! I made ten of them, but I could have made a lot more with the amount of beef that was left over. I think next time I will either buy more buscuits or just cut the beef in half. I like the bbq/cheddar combination.

Simple AND good!  My husband really liked these...I didn't tell him what they were named...I just called them BBQ cups or something!  This recipe is great for a quick meal.  It's easier to put the dough in each muffin tin, let it rest for a few minutes, and then shape it...this will save some time and not be so frustrating!

We loved these!  Kids and adults alike.  I altered it slightly by adding about 1/2 diced green bell pepper while cooking the meat and using less bbq sauce, about 1 cup.  It's quite tasty and I love the handheld aspect.

I have made this recipe twice.  I use custard cups instead of muffin tins to accomodate more filling.  I also think they need an extra five minutes in the oven, although you may need to cover with foil as brown turns to black pretty quick at 400 degrees.

This is a nice weekday supper dish and it's a nice way to use the barbecued pork in the plastic tubs at the grocery store.  That's what I did on my second try and I liked it.  When I used scrambled eggs, bacon and onion for a breakfast version I thought the biscuit dough was too sweet.

Excellent! I'm so glad I found this recipe. I made the meat as directed only lessening the amount of BBQ sauce to just moisten the meat. They were great, even my pickiest eater(my husband)liked them. I fried jimmy dean sausage in one pan and in another pan I cooked scrambled eggs, diced onion and diced green pepper seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. I filled one biscuit with this mixture. It was awesome I will make this instead of the frozen breakfast sandwiches. Thank you for this great recipe.

It's really cold outside right now (-20 with windchill) and I didn't want to take my 3 children under 7 out in the cold. My cupboards are bare so I did a recipe search for ground beef because I knew I had some. I stumbled across this recipe and thought, "those just sound weird..." about 10 minutes later I thought, "hey, I'll try it...." I only had flaky biscuits, which kind of worried me, but they turned out great. These are really easy to make and I didn't think they were ugly at all. Actually I thought they were cute. My kids asked what we were having and I told them, "ugly muffins" which they thought was funny. My 6 year old ate 2 of them and my 4 year old at 3! My fiance wasn't home so he didn't get to try them, but I thought they were really tasty for how simple they were. I didn't roll out the dough, I  just pressed it flat. I also just eyeballed the BBQ sauce, just enough to moisten. I look forward to making these again for my kids and trying the idea of making them with eggs and sausage! Definetly a very cool little recipe!

I too cut back and only used 1 cup of barbeque sauce.  2 of the kids loved them, the other did not, and my husband and I though "eh."  Not bad, but we aren't rushing to have these again.  I will say the meat filling is VERY tasty!

Very tasty, quick and convenient.  I used crescent rolls instead of biscuits because thats all that I had and I always substitute ground turkey for ground beef.

absolutley fantastic. A little messy, but that was to be expected. I used Famous Dave's sweet and zesty barbaque sauce and everyone loved them.  I had a lot of left over meat though. We used it the next day like sloppy joes and they were really good. What barbeque sauce you use makes all the difference. I highly recommend the sweet and zesty famous dave's sauce.

I made this just as the recipe and they were FANTASTIC! Great for football party. Also I made them using scrambled eggs and sausage for Christmas morning. I just sampled them and they were equally as good. I am going to try bacon and eggs too. Thanks for such a good idea!

The flavor of these was good but I think that it was a bit too saucy for my family.  This is not a recipe that will be made weekly but it was nice for a change.

First, I have to disagree with those that called these ugly- I think mine were pretty cute!  I loved this idea of using the biscuits to make cups, and wanted to make something with them for breakfast.  I didn't have any sausage, so I used about 1/4 pound ground beef, about 1/2 tablespoon taco seasoning, and cracked 4 eggs into the drained meat.  I scrambled that all together for a minute or so, then filled the cups.  I baked according to the biscuit directions (13 minutes at 400 degrees) and then topped with a mound of sharp cheddar and returned to the oven for about 30 seconds or so.  They were a big hit with my whole family, and were delicious!  After having them this way, I think the sausage might have been too strong anyway.  These were just right.

What a great recipe!  Thank you so much.  The first time I made them as you suggested and I think I might cut back on the bbq sauce a little.  Since then we have also made pizza ones and they were even better.  Make sure you use regular biscuits not the Grands.

Amazingly tasty and easy to make. Make sure you use a good barbeque sauce--this can make or break the dish. I also made some of these with a sloppy joe filling, and got great compliments!

Great for a basic recipe starter.  I added some cream of mushroom soup and that gave it a little something.  Without it, I thought it tasted too much like sloppy joes.  I've also used this concept to make little pizzas which make a quick and easy lunch for my toddler.  Husband liked it, too!

Pretty good for a basic, quick, kid friendly meal. I use fresh garlic cloves-about 2 cloves and reduced the barbecue sauce to about 1 one cup. I had a lot of meat left over so I just froze it for next time. They tasted even better the next day! Thanks for sharing!
**Update 8/10- I have made many variations of these including pizza uglies, taco uglies and greek uglies (ground turkey, basil, greek dressing and feta). Yummy!

This was such a fast and easy dinner, I couldn't believe it.  Also, my kids and my husband really liked it.  I added some diced red bell pepper and some celery to give it some consistency and color.  Next time I am going to do a pizza or taco version!

I can't really review these because I changed a major ingredient, substituting cream of mushroom soup for barbeque sauce.  However, my husband loved them and I will make again trying the real recipe.  Thanks!

My family really enjoyed these.  We made them with venison and Honey Brown Sugar KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.  I also added cloves of fresh garlic to the meat when it was cooking.  My youngest son likes to call these "meat cupcakes".  I will use this recipe again!  Thanks!
