Oh, how I LOVE this recipe! Following other reviews, I add minced fresh ginger & chopped cilantro, and I reduce the oil to 4 T. and sugar to 3 T. I use only 1 1/2 t. chili sauce because I'm wimpy that way! Thicken the sauce with 1 t. cornstarch mixed into 1 c. chicken broth, and stir in 1 T. toasted sesame oil at the end, off heat. Optional add-ins make it even better: shredded napa cabbage, red bell pepper strips, blanched & sliced snowpeas, and/or cooked & cubed chicken. Absolutely delicious!!

I made this today to go with Michelle's Roast Chicken. I needed something in the same taste-vein. I subbed vegetable oil for the safflower oil, because I didn't have it. I also didn't use chili sauce because my kids have to be able to eat it. They don't like spicy food. Very tasty. I served it as a cold side, as it's pretty warm here lately. Refreshing and light. My husband fell in love with it, and he can be a little picky. I had to restrain him from eating the whole bowl. I will make this again for sure. EDITED: Now that I'm cooking to reflect a low-sodium/low-fat/low-sugar lifestyle, I now make it like this.... I'll cut the noodles in half and used a little over 1/2 bag of shredded coleslaw mix in place of the missing noodles. I now use EVOO instead of safflower oil, honey or Splenda brown sugar blend instead of sugar, low sodium soy sauce and after I toss the sauce with the noodles and coleslaw, I chill it. Right before serving, I sprinkle the servings with a little chopped, roasted unsalted peanuts or cashews. I've made this for four years now and I've got to say that this is one of our most favorite recipes from AllRecipes.

Since the temperature is already hitting triple digits here in Las Vegas, I decided to serve this cold as a salad.  I made the sauce as written except I added a little crushed ginger from a jar from Trader Joe's.  I had 2 different kinds of chile garlic sauce; 1 Chinese and 1 Vietnamese, so I said what the heck and put in a tsp of each.  I used Chinese Yung Chung noodles instead of linguine; and to make it more like a salad, I added a chopped, seeded cucumber, some edamame and some cilantro.  This came out delicious!......Since I wrote this original review back in 2007, I've become more health conscious and now when I make this, I omit the vegetable oil completely, use Splenda instead of sugar, and not so much of it, bump up the dark sesame oil by a couple teaspoons, increase the chili garlic sauce and use whole wheat noodles.  The dish is still delicious, but as DH said, it tastes fresher and lighter.

This recipe is so good it should come with a warning: may be addictive!  It's sweet and spicy and what's great about it is you can adjust the amount of sweet or spice depending on your tastes. It can be a main dish or side dish depending on what you do with it.  You can add veggies, shrimp, beef, chicken; the possibilites are endless.  Like others, I cut the amount of oil in half and fresh pasta is best.  If you don't like things too hot, use hoisin sauce instead of chili sauce.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

This recipe is extremely good. To make this taste authentic use FRESH pasta (I use "Basic Pasta" from this site), if you don't care to make noodles, just buy a package of the fresh linguine if you can, that alone made this dish 50 times better.. I cut the oil in half (sometimes I use canola depending what I have on hand, but safflower has more health benefits) I also sometimes use Agave rather than sugar. I also replace 2 tablespoons of vinegar with mirin, and add some garlic chili sauce.  I served this dish tossed with fresh stir fried veggies and egg rolls on the side.. my family and friends said they would rather have me cook Asian any day, rather than eat at a greasy takeout.   To be honest it tastes very similar to PF Changs lo mien. Add all your favorite stir fry veggies to this!  This is going into the recipe collection for sure. thank you!

This was really good.  Instead of just tossing the noodles with the sauce, I let it all simmer/fry on fairly high heat so the noodles could really absorb the flavor and have more of a pan-fried noodle. I also replaced the safflower oil with peanut oil. They were delicious!  Next time I think I will lighten up on the amount of oil and use fresh noodles.

With adjustments this was very nice! I used canola instead of safflower oil & cut it back to 3 tbp., I used a bit more than a tsp. of chile paste instead of chile sauce, cut back on the vinegar & sugar a little & I used rice noodles instead of linguine. I thought it had just the right ratio of flavors going on...not too spicy, not too sweet, not too vinegary & not too oily. This worked perfectly w/ some leftover Mahogany Chicken Wings (I used legs though & for this meal, I removed the meat from the leg, chunked it up some & served it on top of these noodles.

These noodles were so good and so easy to make! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe; I'll definitely be making these again.  I followed the suggestions of earlier reviewers and cut the sugar by about 1/3 and used fresh noodles.  They turned out fantastic.  I halved the recipe because I was only cooking for two, but next time I'm making the whole batch so I have some yummy leftovers!!

I have tried many sesame noodle recipes, but after I made this recipe, I ripped up all the old ones!  The chili is a great addition. I used Hoboken Eddie's spicy thai chili sauce (it has extra garlic, hot peppers and herbs).  I make this every week now. Thanks so much!

Oh wow! Wonderfully delicious! Since there were only two of us I made half pound of linguine, however next time I will make it a point ot use fresh chinese noodles. After reading other reviews I cut the amount of sugar down to 3T, used all sesame oil , not exceeding more than 4T sesame oil. In place of chili sauce I used hoisin sauce, personal preference. After I boiled the noodles, I drained it, set it aside. In another pot I boiled the sauce. I added 2T cornstarch to thicken up the sauce then added the noodles to let it soak up the sauce. Meanwhile in a large pot I added a drizzle of sesame oil , threw in broccoli crowns (parboiled), bamboo shoots, red bell pepper, thinly sliced, and cooked it. I added the noodles with sauce to vegetables and then garnished it with toasted sesame seeds and handful of chopped cilantro and green onions. The sauce itself is the star of this dish. A perfect balance of flavors -nothing overpowering each other, not too salty, tangy or too sweet. You can serve this as a side dish or main meal and pretty much add any vegetables and/or meat to this dish and it will not fail you. This recipe is a definite keeper and is going into my box for good use again in the near future. I served this with, "Asian Beef Skewers," hot rice and "Chinese Almond Cookies," all from this website.

This was an OK recipe. It had a wonderful smell. Next time I will cut back on the vinegar and Safflower oil and add a little cornstarch/water to thicken it up a bit. The sauce pooled at the bottom of the pan not on the noodles. A good starting place for what I was looking for.

These noodles are absolutely amazing. I almost was taken in by the top rated review that totally changes this recipe. Instead I followed the recipe exactly as written. The sweet and spice are perfect and the green onions and sesame seeds give just the right amount of crunch needed. I am not a big sweet lover and have to disagree with reviews that state this is too sweet. Perhaps they altered the sweetness by adding vegetables to the noodles while cooking, or didn't boil the sauce long enough to completely dissolve the sugar. I boiled until I could no longer smell the vinegar, about ten minutes. These noodles can make a wonderful addition to vegetables and or meats, however I would strongly suggest you follow the noodle recipe and cook your vegetables or meat/shrimp separately then add the two together after each is cooked. I did add the noodle mixture to some shrimp and mushrooms, but the noodles kept their original flavor and enhanced the shrimp and mushrooms. This recipe is a keeper. I served it with the baked egg roll recipe on AR.

Really good noodles, and they couldn't be easier to make. I cut the sugar in half, used 4 T peanut oil instead of the safflower, used 5 T soy sauce, and a bit more of the chili sauce (I used garlic chili sauce). All else stayed the same. I just tried the noodles warm and they were really good, but I now have them in the fridge because I have a funny feeling they might taste even better chilled. (LATER ON...) Wow. These are awesome cold! I was going to give these four stars warm, but they deserve five after being chilled!

I loved this recipe.  I did add some cornstarch to thicken it up a bit, and I reduced the chili sauce a tad, too.  My son and husband enjoyed it.  We ate with chopsticks everyone got in their stockings at Christmas.

This was okay but not one of my favourites of this type of dish I've tried. It was very vinegary and the sesame flavour wasn't very noticeable to me. I added bean sprouts to the garnish as I had some to use up. I may use this recipe again to play with the ingredients/amounts, but I wouldn't make again as is.

Made this tonight, and it was wonderful!  I cut the amount of pasta in half, and doubled the sauce.  I put chopped green onions in the sauce mix while it was cooking.  I can see adding veggies or shrimp, chicken, etc.  Such a versatile recipe  Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe is AMAZING!  I cut down on the oil, but added a little peanut butter to the sauce and the some broccoli in for the last few minutes of the linguine.  Perfect balance of sweet and spice.  Thank you for adding!

Loved these, even with the omissions that I had to make.  I did not use the sesame oil or sesame seeds, but we all loved the noodles.  Considering how expensive those ingredients are, I need to find more than just one recipe that the family loves in order for me to buy them.  For now, I will just make them without them. We had these as a side dish to asian pork tenderloin, and they were the perfect compiment.

So good!  This was just what I was looking for and it tasted even better than I thought it would.  The only changes I made were using spaghetti noodles instead of linguine and using sesame oil (6 TBSP total) instead of safflower oil because that is what I had.  I also put way more than 1 TBSP of sesame seeds because I love them.  Thanks for the great recipe - it was perfect!

looking in your local grocery store or oriental market for "Lo Mein Noodles" makes this recipe 10 times better!!  I make this recipe at least twice a month, great lunch, snack or dinner.  Sometimes I add peanuts just before serving for added protein and crunch!

I have to say, I have had this cold a day old and hot right away - cold was definitely more tasty. I still liked the hot version but the flavours were more prominent in the cold version. Either way I loved it. I would increase the spice a bit next time and garlic...but I am crazy. hehe. Thanks!!

We loved these noodles, and we love spice, however I'm not sure if it was the brand of chilli sauce I used (from the Asian supermarket) but my noodles were SUPER spicy! I also served stir fried vegatables with our meal so we just mixed the two together on our plate to balance out the spiciness. We will make again, but I'll just use less chili sauce.

This recipe was delicious!  Per other reviews I ended up leaving the safflower oil out completely and adding an extra tablespoon of sesame oil.  The dish was perfect!  We served with the Asian Beef Skewers from this site.  I will be making this recipe again!

Followed recipe exactly and it had a strange flavor.  Like there was too much vinegar and too much sugar.  I will make again but change it a little.

This recipe is fantastic! The only change I made was that I used a spicy sesame-chili oil with some chili powder, rather than chili paste, that added good flavor and I didn't have to buy the extra ingredient. I made the recipe so that we had enough for leftovers - the noodles kept for a while, and when I used the leftovers, I added tofu and  vegetables. Definitely a keeper, and will make again!

I really love this recipe because it's provides a great base from which to add other ingredients.  I followed other reviewers' advice and used 4 T oil and 3 T sugar.  I dissolved 1 T cornstarch in 1 C chicken broth for extra thickening.  I prepped it in a wok as follows:  stir-fried sliced chicken breast in 2 T sesame oil until cooked.  Removed from wok then stir-fried thinly sliced red bell pepper and zucchini.  Removed from wok then prepared sauce as per instructions but added cornstarch/broth combo when sauce was boiling.  Re-added chicken strips and veggie mixture when sauce was thickened and stirred.  Finally added cooked pasta and mixed.  Yum!

I really liked these even though I found them to be a bit too sweet.  I served it with Beef Bulgogi (recipe from this site) which is on the salty side so the two paired together very well.  However, I will definitely reduce the amount of sugar next time.

What a great recipe! So easy and delicious. Didn't have safflower oil or linguine pasta in the pantry so substituted them with olive oil and angel hair. My vegetarian daughter is going to love this as! well. Thank you for sharing.

VERY EASY to make & DELICIOUS!  I used low sodium soy sauce & this came out perfectly.  My only complaint was that I wish the noodles had a little bit more heat.  Next time I will add red pepper flakes or Mongolian fire oil.  Side Note:  I served this with super spicy mongolian beef. That recipe also came from this site.  They went superbly to together.

This was great!  I kept the dressing measurements the same but made 8 oz pasta and added stir fried chicken, broccoli, and carrots.  Next time I think I would reduce the oil a bit. I also thickened the sauce with 2 T cornstarch in water.  Very tasty meal.  My 4 year old who loves "mall food court" chinese inhaled this meal!

I love these noodles! These make the house smell amazing, and my friends thought I got take-out! My only suggestion is to finish cooking the noodles in the sauce. This sauce would work for vegetables too!

A nice dish to serve with 'Sweet, Sticky & Spicy Chicken' from AR.  It is a very basic noodle recipe with lots of flavor.  The next time, I think steamed vegetables would really enhance the flavor of the noodles.

I made this recipe for dinner and I have to say at first glance of the ingredients I was skeptical. However, after tasting the end result it was very good. I would have to say the next time I make this I will cut the safflower oil in half because 6T of oil is actually 1/2 cup of oil and there is an additional 2t of sesame oil also, which is just way too much oil. The other ingredients are a good combination of flavors. I also added some grated fresh ginger (not too much, as these are sesame noodles), red peppers, and broccolli. I will definately make this again.

Really great. Kids loved it. I added sweet peppers and some bok choy. It was very versatile and I added tofu one day and then garbanzo beans the next day to the leftovers.

Very good. In fact, I agree with other reviewers and think it taste best once the flavors set in overnight and it is cold. Yum! I reduced the amount of ginger it called for. I didn't have safflower oil so I substitued asian garlic infused olive oil and regular cooking oil. I als oadded carrots and chicken and red pepper flakes. This was really flavorful and good.

I am sorry, but I did not care for these.  Most of the people that reviewed these changed something in the recipe, I changed nothing and they weren't good.  You can't rate these with 5 stars if you changed things.  Was really looking forward to having these, what a disappointment!!!

delicious!  the only mistake i made was not making more.  i didn't add vinegar because i don't like it and doubled the chili sauce because i love super spicy.  i agree with the others that it would still be good if you cut back a little on the oil and sugar.

I used less garlic, less oil (and none of it safflower), and less soy sauce. I used a LOT more sesame seeds. Really, if I'm going to toast sesame seeds, it's going to be more than 1 teaspoon! I added ginger & cilantro as per one review. I wasn't going to try and thicken it with cornstarch, but I wound up doing that to thicken the sauce a bit. It's so good! This recipe is not for those on a low salt diet!

Following others suggestions we cut the sugar in half. However, next time I would cut out a lot of the oil too as it was very oily. It makes a lot of sauce compared to noodles so can probably cut it down lots. MADE AGAIN - I tried this again but cut the recipe to a quarter. I used: 2 garlic cloves, small pinch of sugar, 1 tsp canola oil, 1 tbsp rice vinegar, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sesame oil, at least 1/2 tsp chili sauce (I like it spicy) and a couple of green onions. It was way less oily this time and didn't all gather on the bottom of the bowl but stayed on the noodles.

This is a great recipe for authentic asian noodles. I know some people said they didn't like the flavor combination, but this is the flavor combination Asian noodles SHOULD have! I do agree that the recipe could get away with less safflower oil - I would say 4 tlbs would be plenty...all it really needs to do is help coat the noodles. I served this on the side with the Asian Lettuce Wraps. Thanks!

This was way too oily and the flavors weren't strong enough. We would have been better off just adding a tablespoon of sesame oil to the pasta.

I have to say this is absolutely delicious.  While I don't like to make changes, I took other reviewers advice and cut down the sugar.  I also added shrimp, fresh ginger and cilantro. I also halved the recipe as I was only cooking for 2, didn't have safflower oil so I used canola.  Will make over and over again.

LOVE this recipe.  To cut down on sodium, I use Bragg's Liquid Amino Acid instead of soy sauce (you can find it in most grocery stores in the organic section).  Tastes the same and healthier.  I also add chicken and stir fry veggies.

Wow this was delicious. I ate the noodles hot for dinner with chicken and stir fried veggies and again the next day cold for lunch and it was just as good! I used less sugar following others suggestions and this was just perfect!

Excellent recipe.  I ran out of garlic, only had 4 cloves.  Also used peanut oil instead of safflower and will probably cut out 1-2 T. next time.  I also went easy on the chili sauce since I have little ones. And cut the sugar down to about 4 T. The whole family loved it.  We will use this recipe from now on!

This dish was SUPER easy and very yummy! I just happened to have all of the ingredients on hand! I made the recipe almost exactly as written. The only change I made was I only used 4 cloves of garlic, 4 T of EVOO and increased the sesame oil to 4-5 T. To make it into a meal I also added sauteed broccoli, matchstick carrots, and leftover diced chicken. I hesitated when it came to using the hot sauce but decided to give it a go and it wasn't overwhelming at all, gave it just a tiny kick! My little toddlers ate it up. Will definitely make again and next time going to add some fresh ginger...YUMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing!! The best ever sesame noodles. My husband is Hawaiian and said that this was better than anything he had growing up in Hawaii. At first when I mixed the sauce with the noodles, I thought wow, too much sauce. I let the noodles and sauce cool down for about an hour, giving it a good stir ever 10 minutes or so, knowing that eventually the noodles would continue to soak up the sauce, which they did. Refridgerated overnight and lo and behold! all the sauce had been sucked into those yummy noodles. Don't alter by trying to thicken with broth and cornstarch!  This is going to be my new favorate potluck, side-dish, snack!!! Thank you so much for giving this to the world!  We are two smart haoles! I did the exact same thing, let the noodles soak up the sauce. Perfection!

I have to say this recipe was a little disappointing. I don't know what is missing, but something was. I wanted a little more sesame flavor as well.

Delicious.  I cut the oil in 1/2 and used canola instead of safflower oil.  I added portabella mushrooms and served with the beef bulgogi from this site.

This was a big hit when I made it for company.  I used fresh linguine and because I added shrimp and broccoli, I decided to double the recipe.  I doubled every ingredient except the sugar, and it was sweet enough.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was good just not fantastic.  I was out of a few ingredients and will make again when I have green onions and sesame seeds.  Reduced sugar to 3T and used 4 T of oil.  Thickened up sauce with cornstarch but I'm not sure if I liked it that way.  Husband loved it tho.  I stir fried veggies before hand, added the cooked pasta, and poured the sauce on top of both.  My chili sauce was the sweet kind so I had to add red pepper flakes.  So in all honesty, I didn't follow the recipe that well.

I have to say, these were delicious! I wish that I had thickened them w/cornstarch as suggested by others. But, the flavor was right on! I used 3 Tbs of sugar and 3 Tbs of canola oil as suggested and loaed them up w/ sliced scallions, baby cukes and par-boiled broccoli. The sauce does tend to pool to the bottom of the dish but we jst turned them a few tims before serving and they were fine. I used the fresh linguine (as suggested but could only find it in 12 oz pkg.). Four of us pretty much ate the whole batch. Would double the linguine next time and probably would have enough liquid as is. Definitely worth trying!

I made this into a noodle salad, and it was amazing! I tripled all the ingredients for the sauce, other than the oils, I kept those the same, and I used honey instead of sugar. I thickened the sauce using cornstarch. I then added some shredded carrots and zucchini into the sauce, and let it cook a little before adding them to the noodles. I also doubled the amount of green onions. I didn't have sesame seeds, so I toasted some peanuts, crushed them and added it in. It tasted better the next day after the noodles really absorbed the sauce. The sauce really is amazing (and simple)! Thank you for sharing this recipe!! Oh and my bf added crumbled feta cheese to his bowl of noodle salad, and it actually tasted really good with feta cheese!

I didn't get this dish at all? I thought it was suppose to be like the noodle side dishes at the Asian lunch places. I thought the noodles seemed way too wide and they were. The other problem I had is the ingredients seemed to have very unhealthy portions of oil, soy sauce, etc. yet the finished noodles had absolutely no taste! The only change I made was subbing hoison sauce for the chili sauce and that should have helped. It just tasted like oily noodles with some soy sauce. I think some vegetables or something to make it more of a meal would have also been beneficial. I was quite dissapointed, as a whole large bowl of noodles got tossed, because no one would eat them. I didn't want to waste more ingredients trying to improve the noodles which were way too thick for this type of side dish anyhow.

This recipe is really fantastic. Two changes I made were very minor.

First I reduced the amount of chili sauce so my kids would eat it. Second I dissolved about 2 Tablespoons of flour in a tiny bit of water and added to the sauce as it was looking too thin for my preference. I let it simmer a bit longer and it thickened up very nicely. 

Thanks for a very tasty recipe!

Very good!  I did not have any safflower oil, so I added just 1 tbs of canola oil.  Next time I will only add half the amount of chili sauce because it was way too hot for my toddler.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is a very flexible side dish. I earned points with my special lady with this one. It's easy, and it's a winner. Update: I added the fresh ginger as suggested, and it absolutely takes this to the next level. If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting for? New Update: This turns out fabulous by substituting fine egg noodles in place of the linguine, and reduces cooking time.

5 stars with additions:
Per other reviewers I cut oil to 3 tbsp.; sugar to 3 tbsp.  I used 1 tsp. sweet chili sauce + 1 tsp. sriracha hot chili sauce, and added 1- 1 1/2 tsp fresh ginger, chopped green onions and cilantro.

By preference: I used KAME Stir Fry Thai Rice Noodles; added all sorts of vegetables and 1 lb. chicken tenders, chopped tamari almonds and now it's 5 starts for me.

best sesame noodles EVER!!! Made a double recipe for our NYE party and they were devoured with so many compliments that I was speechless. I did cut back on the oil with no troubles. Used gluten free rice noodles (Tinkyada) and gf tamari sauce. The best ever, seriously!

I used 4 T Brown sugar and would next time use just 4 or 5 T oil.  Added some fresh ginger too!  Added asparagus, sauteed mushrooms and seared Ahi Tuna.  My husband made fresh Bucatini Pasta.

EXCELLENT!!!!  SO much better than store bought or restaurant noodles!  Honestly, this is wonderful, and wonderfully easy!  I used stir-fry oil that I had on hand in place of the other oils, and I loved it.  I also chose to use rice pasta (purchased in the Asian section of our supermarket) rather than linguine noodles.  Simply excellent.  I will make this again and again and again!

ok...so I thought the 6 TBS was a little odd...just do 1/3 cup instead....the reason behind this is that there are 16 TBS in one 8oz cup...so split that in half and you have 8 TBS per 1/2 cup....1/3 cup is perfect.  This was very tasty...HOT but very tasty. I will for sure make this again...I served this with grilled Cod and a green salad with an asian dressing

I have made this recipe several times and it is just delicious.  I have begun to stir fry veggies, like carrots, peppers, mushrooms, or any type you wish.  Also, I've used shrimp, or chicken cubes, both precooked, and when the whole wheat pasta I used was cooked, I just folded all of the ingredients together and used probably 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds, and you must use the green onions, you have a perfect meal.  It's like take-out from your favorite, expensive restaurant.  Definitely worthwhile making, takes no time and now that I've read people use less sugar or even Agave, I will give that a shot, along with using less oil.  I do not ever buy chili sauce, so I used spicy Salsa, and worked like a charm.  You won't be sorry with this Noodle Recipe.  Thanks to Scoopnana for a really enjoyable meal!

This was light and delicious!  I reduced the safflower oil by 2 Tablespoons as suggested by others and forgot the green onions, which would have given it more zip.  The noodles were good all by themselves and would make a nice summer side dish.  I added sliced leftover sirloin steak, snow peas, shredded carrots and some steamed broccoli to make a cold salad out of it.  This is not a spicy sauce, so if you like your noodles spicy, you might want to add more chili sauce (or substitute chili paste) or some red pepper flakes -- and don't forget the green onions!

Oh my is this yummy.  I sauteed chicken and red  peppers and added it after I tossed the pasta in the sauce.  I used a spinach and chive pasta from trader joe's.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

One of my favorite meals!  I do add veggies to make it a little healthier - usually broccoli slaw - and I cut the oil in half to keep the fat and calories down.  We usually have these at least once a week - they are a a great alternative to takeout!  Excellent cold also.

Low fat healthy version. Only 3 TBL sugar, no safflower oil, 3 tsp chili sauce and about 1 inch fresh grated ginger. I/2 cup vegie broth and some cornstarch to thicken. I stir fried some bite size chicken pieces,  green pepper and carrot strips and  snow peas. My kids made me make it 3 days in a row!

This was delicious and very simple to throw together. I had it warm for dinner and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed it. I was a bit worried about adding the chili sauce but its the perfect amount to add flavor and not too much bite (I don't like spicy food). I look forward to having it tomorrow cold! Thanks for a great recipe.

Doesn't get better than this; it's my go-to sesame noodle recipe now. The only change I make is cutting the veggie oil altogether - with all of the other liquids, it doesn't need this greasiness. Also, I use whole wheat noodles. Make it ahead of time, keep the leftovers - you really can't go wrong!

I love these noodles! The only changes I make to the sauce are: I use 3T sugar, 3T canola oil instead of safflower, 5T soy sauce, and 1T hot chili garlic sauce (but we like spicy!). The base noodles are great as they are, but I always add chicken (thinly sliced, marinated, stir-fried), broccoli, water chestnuts, and more toasted sesame seeds (1T total). Sprinkle chopped cilantro on top before serving and it's perfect!

Good recipe to play with! Reduced oil to 2-3 Tbsp and would probably reduce even more next time. I ate the noodles hot with steamed veggies on top, but I think tomorrow, once the flavors have melded, they'll be even better - and of course I'm going to try them cold! As for eating them hot and fresh, I think the sauce could have benefited from some cornstarch as others recommended - otherwise, it doesn't stick to the noodles very well (though again, maybe tomorrow the flavors will have soaked in the noodles rather than just coating them). Also added an inch's worth of minced ginger to the sauce. I'll continue to use this as a base recipe in the future. Thanks, scoopnana! Update: made them a second time, and increased sesame oil considerably (almost omitting the canola). Eating them cold the next day with a side of steamed veggies is definitely the way to go. It's nice to have a dish whose leftovers don't require microwaving!

Made as written except halved and was not impressed at all.  The sauce really had no flavor, it was an oily mess.  Added some ground ginger and crushed red pepper so it was edible.  I followed some other's suggestions and refrigerated to see if there was an improvment...nope.

Way too oil-y in our opinion. It has a nice Asian flavor, but I totally prefer the similar " Chicken Lo Mein "'s (from this site)flavor MUCH more and it uses only 1 TBSP oil. I doubt I will make again. I will just leave out the chicken on the other recipe instead, when I want Asian noodles.

Lovely recipe as written, and so easy to tweak to fit your tastes or what you have on hand.  Minced fresh ginger is a nice addition to the sauce; throw some chicken teriyaki on top and it's a meal.  Leftovers are great cold.  Thanks!

I changed several things:

I used brown rice spaghetti, because I am Gluten Intolerant. I also used wheat free soy sauce which has a pretty concentrated flavour. I used 1 broccoli crown, chopped, 150g brown mushrooms chopped, 1/2 head cauliflower, chopped, and olive oil instead of safflower, tapioca starch to thicken it (the veggies made it a bit watery) 1 tbsp of almond butter, dash of chilli powder (I didn't have any chilli sauce) and grated fresh ginger, maybe half a tbsp...

I halved the oil (kept the same amount of sesame oil)halved the sugar and halved the rice vinegar.

My roommate loved it, so did I. I would make it again, but with some red chili flakes instead of the chili powder next time!

Very good but I still made a few adjustments to make this more of a full meal. I used 1 lb of fresh egg noodles and marinated thin slices of tofu in the sauce overnight. I followed the suggestions of others and cut down on the sugar (half) but increased the amount of chili sauce and made 1.5 times more sauce as I was adding veggies to the mix. I heated the canola (instead of safflower) oil in a wok; stir fried some nappa cabbage, shredded carrots, and bean sprouts for a few minutes; added the sauce with marinated tofu (including 2 tsp. cornstarch) to the wok and heated until sugar dissolved. Finally, I added in the cooked noodles and let simmer a few minutes. Added a little more sesame oil, the toasted sesame seeds, and green onions before serving.

If there was a 6 Star Rating...this would have gotten a 6..this was so yummy. I even used whole wheat spaghetti. I tossed in "sesame shrimp" that I found on this website...and WHAT A MEAL!!!! I've read some of the other reviews and I tend to agree with cutting back on on each of the liquid ingredients to 4-5 tablespoon ...and maybe 3 tablespoons of sugar...depending on your taste...Great recipe...def. a keeper...

liked the flavors quite a bit, though i agree it was a bit too oily and a bit too sweet.  reduced sugar to 5TBS, oil to 4TBS.  i have made this recipe 4-5 times now and i serve it room temp or cold.  i make it early in the am and refrigerate it all day.  the extra sauce is absorbed by the linguine as time passes.  i have served with steamed snow peas, and have also added chicken.  my kids and husband love it. this is a new summer staple at our home

I prepared this recipe as written. I found it to be the perfect balance between sweet and spicy. I prefer to let the al dente noodles soak up the sauce for a few hours at room temperature before serving. This yields flavorful noodles as opposed to noodles with a flavorful sauce. It also eliminates the temptation to thicken the sauce thus turning this dish into something other than sesame noodles. I do think the safflower oil could be reduced to 2-3 T. Each time I've made this there was quite a bit of oil left at the bottom of the bowl. I also like to gently simmer the sauce long enough to tame the garlic a little being very careful not to brown it. A couple of tasty substitutions: rice noodles in place of linguine and brown sugar in place of white. This one's a keeper.

We love this recipe with just a couple of subs. I do start with a couple Tbs of EVOO and in place of the chili sauce, I use Chinese Hot Oil (Please, only a smidgen!!).  I've often added cut up chicken tenders (stir fried)and it is easily a delicious meal!  Come to think of it...sounds like dinner!!

Wow this was good. Adults liked it but the kids didnt really care for it. I did change the recipe to what I had on hand. I didn't have Safflower oil, soy sauce or green onion but sub in teriyaki sauce & 2 yellow onions chopped. I through everything in a skillet & cooked on med untill my noodles was ready. Then I mixed it all together. I served it with avacado salad. It all turned out perfect & it was so EASY & FAST!
            Thanks!

Good stuff--I halved the amount of sugar (brown, it was all I had around), and I used about 3 T of sesame oil while omitting the safflower oil altogether (seriously, 8 T = 1/2 cup of oil total for this dish? No need for that.). As per other reviewers, I added about 2 T of minced fresh ginger, and I used about 2 T of toasted sesame seeds (though their flavor got a little lost). I used this as a bed for the Korean BBQ Chicken recipe on this site, and it was quite good. Definitely will keep this in the rotation.

To die for! I use fresh pasta and half the sugar. I make whenever I want a comforting, delicious food. They are best cold. I make a day ahead, refrigerate, and continue to toss every time I go past the kitchen. By the following day, the sauce has been well absorbed and distributed.

I followed advice and added ginger. I also cut down the sugar by half. Served with grilled chicken and sugar snap peas, this made for a satisfying, relatively quick dinner.

So GOOD! I loved this dish. Made it for dinner tonight but I used spaghetti noodles. I also cut the chili sauce in half and it was the perfect amount of heat. Per other reviews I added a small amount of chopped cilantro as well as some fresh grated ginger and it was a nice addition to the flavors. Don't skip the sesame oil! It really adds so much to the flavor of the dish.  My teens and hubby said it was very good but I loooved it. :-) Next time I will try fresh noodles (Asian). Definite keeper. Thank you!

I made substitutions out of necessity...we only had some of the ingredients.  This was AMAZING and we are eating the leftovers today as part of our lunch!  Thank you so much for sharing this easy but tremendously yummy recipe!
I used 8 cloves garlic crushed, 6 tbsp. sugar, 8 tbsp. olive oil, 6 tbsp. soy sauce, 2 tbsp. mustard, 2 tsp. ketchup, a little fresh grated ginger, and the green onions on top.  After cooking the sauce I stirred in some frozen broccoli and then my pre-cooked pasta.  YUMMY!

There was too much oil. We liked the basic ingredients but found the results a bit bland and amounts needed adjustment.   

Following other reviewers I made this again but I used only 3 tablespoons of oil and substituted 2 tablespoons of tahini for the sesame oil. I thickened the sauce with 1 teaspoon of cornstarch which really helped the sauce stick to the noodles.  
I added one sliced red pepper,  green pepper, 1/2 cup of bok choy  one grated carrot and I  1 1/2 tablespoons of grated ginger and tossed it all together.

I didn't have any grean onions but the recipe turned out great.  I made steamed brocoli to go with my meal, not in the noodles. Awesome with "Asian Salmon" from this site :)

These were so good. The only thing I wish I did was cut the sugar to 1/2. It was just a bit too sweet. I also served them cold and were a bit hit with the family. Thanks fof sharing!

Way too sweet, even using 4 tbsp sugar. I was hoping for a subtle sweetness that would enhance the saltiness. Next time I will use 1 tbsp of sugar, double all other ingredients, and cook down the sauce while the pasta drains so that it coats the noodles better.

This was good and fast to make!  I only had 12 oz of noodles so I had to reduce the sauce a little bit.  I skipped the sugar, used 3 tbs of olive oil, 4 tbs rice vinegar, 4 tbs soy sauce,  1 1/2 tbs sesame oil, 1 tbsp hoisin sauce, 2 tsps of chili sauce and green onions.  I also added half a frozen bag of chinese vegetables.  Served with pot stickers.

This tasted exactly like the Pad Thai at our local Thai restaurant which we love.  I used half the oil and half the chili sauce(I have kids!).  I highly recommend topping it all off with chopped peanuts.  It really adds to this already yummy dish!

I found the recipe to be too sweet. Also I would like to have a stronger sesame flavor. I also added some other vegetables -- green beans and peppers -- and that made it more meal like. I will make this again, but will adjust those two ingredients.

Really good! For the sauce, I cut the safflower oil in half and added a couple dashes of red pepper flakes for extra heat.  I also sauteed some julienned bell pepper and carrots and added them to the sauce before I mixed it with the linguine. They added a great colour and made the dish very visually appealing.

Very yummy.  I only had angel hair pasta and I doubled (or even tripled) the toasted sesame seeds and it was devine.  I love that subtle flavor of the green onion and the sesame oil.  I let it cool down and ate a bit for a test and it's just perfect with some grilled salmon.  I made a big batch for lunches next week, I think it will be a great change.  I think you could add shrimp or chicken to this and make it a main meal very easily.  Thank you for this great recipe!

MMMMmmmm... this is delicious. I love noodles, I love seasame, I love green onions!! Perfect all around. I did half the sugar but everything else stayed the same. This could become a new obsessions for me, especially since I have everything on hand now.

This is a quick and easy recipe that I would recommend with modifications.  In the sauce, only 3 T of sugar and 2 T of safflower (I used canola) oil are necessary.  While the sauce is simmering, I added slivered onions, 8 oz. shredded cabbage/carrot mix, and some raw shrimp to cook.  When the sauce is added to the pasta in the end, I added the 1-2 T of toasted sesame oil off heat.  I have made this with and without shrimp, and it is much better with the shrimp.  This recipe can be easily customized with add-ins to suit your tastes.

I dearly love this recipe!  Must make it once a week too.   I changed it a bit by adding tahini instead of sesame seeds, put only a little bit of sugar (wayyyyyy too much in original) and put in tons of scallions.

On my yumminess!  My husband after his first bite told me that I could make this one again!  I thought there was too much oil and overall, a bit too much sauce in these but the taste was amazing!  Next time I'll cut the safflower oil altogether and perhaps reduce the amounts of the other liquids as well.  I used chinese-style noodles instead of linguini and I think this really helped the sauce to stick to the noodles, as I did not have that issue that others had mentioned.  Also, if you put a little of the water from the boiled noodles into your sauce, that will help coat the noodles... something about the starches in the noodle water.  This is very good and we will be making it again - perhaps adding chicken that has been cooked in sesame oil with ginger and garlic?  Yumm!!!

very garlicky and tasty. i added sliced cucumbers in it and used a dash of olive oil instead of safflower since i didn't have that on hand. lovely base recipe for the noodles, could almost add just about anything to it that one wishes. might try it with chicken cubes and sliced red bell peppers next time! thanks!

Very good! Made this last night with Firecracker Salmon and Asian Avocado. I did make a few changes (don't you hate when people review a recipe that they've changed?? I think this would have been delicious as is but changed it to meet our tastes.) I only used 2 tablespoons of canola oil instead of the 6 of safflower. I thought that would be way too much oil. I sauteed the onions and garlic in the canola oil before adding the other ingredients. I also added a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger and 1/2 cup of homemade peanut sauce. I threw the pasta and some steamed vegetables (pea pods, baby corn and baby carrots) back into the sauce and tossed while heating. Garnished with toasted sesame seeds. Everyone loved it. I'm eating cold leftover salmon and noodles for lunch right now. Delicious cold, too!! Thank you, scoopnana, for sharing this recipe.

I wonder if 6 tbsp oil is a typo, because that makes it way too oily.  You can make this five stars by only using 1-2 tbsp or oil and adding some veggies (carrots, cucumber, zucchini, etc).  Thanks for sharing the recipe--it's a good starting out point!

These were so good.  I served them cold and 1/2ed the oil and sugar (used the recommended amount of semame oil though). Next time I will reduce the oil by another tablespoon and add another tsp. of chili sauce. We used this for an outdoor picnic side and it was great on a very hot day.

Great, easy recipe! I followed others suggestions and cut back a bit on the sugar, rice vinegar and oil.  I also used brown rice pasta and like many reviewers love these cold.

Excellent recipe.  My boyfriend and I make extra at dinner and take the rest as lunch, cold.  They are excellent as written but we do not like things too sweet or sour so I have started to use about 2/3 of the sugar and vinegar called for.

these are wonderful noodles, basic yes, but you should be able to see that from the recipe. These are great with chicken and veggies added also. The sauce is a bit watery, so add cornstarch, or just make less of it. 
Also, I don't have safflower oil, but regular olive oil worked fine(I used much less) I did sprinkle with sesame oil at the end too.

I liked this a lot although I felt it needed something else - some fresh ginger and maybe a little more heat.  I used regular chili sauce, as that's what I had on hand, but next time I'll use a Thai chili sauce or slightly more potent one to offset the sweetness of the sauce more.  My only other change was to reduce the sesame oil by half as I was using toasted sesame oil, and a little goes a long way.  I used whole grain linguini and tossed with some mixed Asian style vegetables (broccoli, carrots, pea pods, water chestnuts, baby corn...).  This was very fast, easy and tasted great.  Will definitely make again!

Very Good! I used only 2 tbsp. of all the ingredients - and I left out the safflower oil. I used a couple of small sprinkles of cayenne pepper for some heat. I added sliced water chestnuts and 1/2 a thinly sliced red pepper.

This recipe blew us all out of the water it was so fantastic! My husband made it and added his own "flavor" to recipe.  He used 1/2 the sugar, and omited the scallions (we were out)  Even our pickiest eaters fell in love.  Thanks Scoopnana! You rock!!

Fantastic flavor and could not be easier! I love this recipe as is but think the flavor is even better the next day as a cold pasta salad. I'll sometimes make an extra 1/2 batch of sauce then arrange shredded/chunks of de-boned rotisserie chicken from the deli in a mound on top of the noodles. Add 1/2 to 1 cup roughly chopped fresh tomatoes around the chicken, sprinkle 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley over all and then drizzle the extra half batch of sauce over everything. Somebody please get me a fork!

YUMMY!  This was delicious!  I used the fresh noodles as some others had suggested.  Wow - I will definitely be making this again.  I thought I might add some chicken, but after tasting it, decided it didn't need it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this and served it with Denise's Peanut Chicken that I also got from Allrecipes.com.  They tasted really good together.  The noodles tasted great by themselves too.  I was a bit worried at how much vinegar went in but it had a really great taste.  I will definitely make this again.

This is a fabulous recipe! We've lived in Japan, we adore Asian food of all kinds and the sauce here is as good as it gets.  I backed off on the garlic a little and served with Japanese soba noodles. My family went nuts - In a good way!!

We loved this recipe! We used all sesame oil and no other oils. We had a few modifications because the first time we made it, it was way too much oil. Also, only 2 t of oil was not spicy AT ALL. These were our changes:

5 T sesame oil
3-4 t chili sauce
8 T soy sauce

Made this last night and it was delicious. The only big change I made was to use spaghetti noodles in place of linguine due to that being what I had on hand. Followed the recipe to a "t" and it was delicious. I can see why some may say it was too "vinegary" but I found the combo of flavors balanced and addictive. If you don't use the full amount of sugar it is unfair to say it was too heavy on the vinegar. Definitely sprinkled a heavy amount of sesame seeds over each bowl and topped generously with green onions and cilantro. The only change I will make next time is to use a heavy dose of sriracha, as I like my Asian food sweet and spicy. This recipe is a winner. Highly addictive and being added to my collection of "goodies".

this was really yummy we added some diced veggies that we steamed first to the dish. the little small asian corn, some peas and some carrots.   You could easily add protein to this dish too.   It was so good that the kids all took the left overs to school and work the next day.

Kids love this!  I love this!  Hubby loves this!  I subbed canola oil for the safflower because I didn't have it.  Also threw into the sauce shredded carrots and chopped bok choy and steamed/cooked down for a few minutes and it is awesome!  Next time will add some chicken.  We like it room temperature or cold.

I just came back from a potluck and these were on the menu.  I searched out the person who brought them and asked for the recipe and I was not surprised when she told me that she got the recipe here.  These noodles are addictive!  I cannot wait to make them myself.  She made the recipe exactly as written, with the addition of some steamed broccoli and mushrooms sauted on the side.

This was excellent, with a tangy, sweet, spicy flavor. Based on previous reviews, I reduced the sugar to 3T, used more sesame oil (6T) and less regular oil (2T of grapeseed oil), and added small slivers of red pepper and minced garlic. I also put the cooked pasta into the sauce after it boiled, so it could soak up all the liquid. I sprinkled it with lots of toasted sesame seeds, green onion, and chopped cashews when serving. I think you could add many different small vegetables, and increase the sauce, and still maintain the great flavor.

I was SO impressed, I sent this to my chef son!!  I added the end of a stir-fry pkg of veggies (not having enough, I added slices of halved zucchini).  It is definitely a keeper and I thank you for it.

My family really liked these noodles! Made several times, served both hot and cold. Rating 4 stars because did reduce oil to 4tbsp and sugar to 4 tbsp (use brown sugar--tasted better). More sugar would have been too sweet. Added a bag of stir fry veges (fried up in some of the sauce). We preferred this dish served cold. Noodles soaked up sauce after awhile, more flavorful and no sauce on bottom of bowl after 1-2 hours.

Guys liked it- said it was a tad salty and we used low sodium soy sauce.  Added Broccoli for a meatless main dish.

Just the right balance between sweet and spicy for the average palate. Really easy and economical.  It also reheats well in the microwave, a plus for me since I made it ahead for meals during the week and froze half.

Wow, this dish turned out better than I thought. The layers of ingredients really mixed well in taste. I did not have safflower oil on hand nor did I have chili paste. Instead, I used one tablespoon of chili oil (I thought this would have made up for the two). I also used thin whole wheat spaghetti and it was just as good. Delish!

Good recipe which would be great with a few changes.  Made it as described, except I added almost of pound of broccoli slaw to the mix.   In the future I would cut the seasonings (soy sauce, sugar, etc.( in half,   Even though I used low salt soy sauce the sauce mix was still over=powering and way too salty.   However, I would make again (with less of the seasoning mix and still add the broccoli slaw.   My husband loved it but said please add more pasta to the mix before we eat leftovers.

I made these yesterday for a get together today and served cold.  I added a bag of shredded coleslaw mix, as well as some par-steamed broccoli for some added nutrients.  It was a nice change of pace from the usual party sides.  I can see this being made again at the LTH house.  THANKS, for the recipe!

This is a staple in my house. When you have bits of leftover veggies, just toss them in too. I usually stir-fry some eggplant, mushroom, bell pepper, zucchini, etc. and just toss it all up together. If you have any left over meat, toss that in too. Make a triple batch of the sauce and keep it in the fridge for those quick meals.

Very YUMMY! My children loved the flavor and simpleness. I added boneless prepackaged grilled chicken pieces that I sautéed after with garlic powder, salt, pepper and sunflower oil. But by itself it is fantastic!

My family loved this recipe! I added chopped chicken thighs and some other veggies that I steamed. Personally, I thought it was going to be a little on the oily side but it turned out great. Thanks for another good recipe to add to my box!

Used peanut oil instead of safflower, brown sugar instead of white, reduced total amount of oil. A few more tweaks and it will be just right for us.

I love these noodles! They were easy and delicous! I did leave out most of the chili sauce because my husband doesn't do well with spice, but I think they would have been even better with the chili. Great side dish for any Asian dish. Thanks for a keeper!

Great recipe.  I made them exactly as written except didn't use the chili sauce since I didn't have it, so I added a little tomato sauce, hot pepper sauce and some red pepper flakes, for an extra kick.  I also added a cornstarch/water mixture to thicken it up a bit. I highly recommend that tip (from another reviewer) because the sauce coats the noodles beautifully.

Tastes like restaurant noodles. I added shrimp and cabbage. Great taste. Kids really enjoyed it. The only change i made wad to use malt vinegar instead of rice vinegar bc that's what i had. Also i only used 1 spoon of the malt.

OMG!! super delishhh! I couldn't stop eating it once it was done! kept going back for more! 1st. I cut back on the oil and sugar, added fresh minced ginger, added baby spinach, didn't have sesame seeds, also did what a reviewer suggested to add 1/2 a bag of cole slaw, next time I'm adding the whole bag! I also only cooked half of the box of linguini, next time I'm cooking the whole box!! wil definitely make this over and over again!

Very tasty ... I followed the suggestion to cut both vinegar & sugar down to 4 Tbls & simmered fresh broccoli during the last 5 minutes with the pasta.  I also added a cup & a half of fresh baby spinach as the cooked pasta & sauce were combined.  The warmth of everything wilted the spinach to perfection!  This is definitely a recipe that I'll keep on hand.  Thank you!  :-)

My local gourmet deli makes a noodle dish like this, and I have been crazy to find a recipe to duplicate it.  This is IT! OMG... so good.  Like everyone else I made changes... lowered the amounts of sugar, oil and garlic.  Skipped the chili sauce... hubs is sensitive to spicy. Added 2 cans of Costco/Kirkland chicken breast, 2 cups frozen peas, 2 cups of julienned carrot, and 2T minced ginger. My linguine only came in a 13 oz pkg rather than 16 oz, but it still made a large bowlful.  Next time I think I'll break the linguine noodles in half prior to cooking so it's more "friendly" to eat. Thanks for this perfect, fantastic recipe.

This is the same recipe to a noodle dish I would always order as a kid. It was at a cute little Japanese restaurant and since the cook moved, I never thought I would eat this again. 
The only changes in the recipe that I made are:
- no garlic (had to go somewhere later)
- no onion (same reason)
- no chili sauce

This was awesome.  I had to make a few substitutes just because of items on hand, but basically the same recipe.  Did follow other reviews and lessen the sugar and add a little corn starch. Glad I did.  The only real change I made myself was to saute some small bits of broccoli, carrots, celery and zucchini.  I added it when I combined the noodles and sauce.  It was fantastic.  Thank goodness we have leftovers and will have that cold tonight. Thanks for the great recipe!

Let's just say I would never try this recipe again. It wasn't the recipe of me. In my opinion, the ingredients just didn't go well to together. It was way too sweet and had a weird after taste. 
One good thing about this recipe is its quick and easy to make. Other than that......

I have made this several times in the past month. So easy, fast and addictive. I use capellini noodles. Also, can't find sesame seeds without going the bulk barn so I sprinkle with cashew nuts. I also sprinkle with red pepper flakes, along with extra green onion. I love this recipe!

This was so delicious I couldn't get enough!  I added some sauteed broccoli and cabbage and it was a wonderful no meat meal.  Unfortunately my husband and son don't care for asian sauces, so I will have to find creative times to make this again.

I substituted olive oil for the safflower oil. I changed the 1 teaspoon sesame seeds to 2 Tablespoons. Easy recipe that is good alone but would also be tasty with shrimp or chicken for a one-dish meal.

These noodles are delicious!  I only made a couple of slight changes-I didn't have any safflower oil-I used a total of 4 Tablespoons of oil-3 TBSP of sesame and 1 TBSP of olive oil.  I also decreased the sugar to 5 TBSP and used a bit more chili sauce (we like it spicy here!).   The sauce was so yummy-the perfect balance of flavors.  I added some cooked chicken and red bell pepper after the noodles had a chance to marry with the sauce for about 10 minutes.  The whole family asked to have this again!

Great noodles!  I did scale the sugar back a bit and decided not to use the safflower oil - I don't like too much oil and we like the tang of vinegar and soy :)  The sesame oil is a must, obviously as these are called sesame noodles!!  I served these with Hot and Tangy Broccoli Beef also from AR.  Very yummy meal!

This is a great side dish.  I use olive oil instead of safflower oil.  I also use 1 teaspoon chili oil  instead of chili sauce.  I add diced cucumber  and cilantro for color and flavor.

This sauce was a wonderful addition to the spinach noodles I used.  When making the sauce I used half the sugar, half the oil, and added about a half teaspoon of cornstarch disolved in water to thicken it.  I cooked the sauce a lot longer than suggested as well.   A nice addition to the pasta and sesame seeds was some steamed brocoli and mushrooms!  This was served with teriyaki chicken, my own recipe.

Delicious.  You might want to add a little cornstarch at the end as the sauce is, as others have stated, really thin.  
I don't keep safflower oil around so I just used my regular olive oil.  And, I didn't have linguini so subbed spaghetti.

Really good.  I thought it had too much sugar in it so I cut it in half.  After tasting it, I realized that the added sugar would make it better.  I added chicken and Chinese vegetables.

My only regret is that there wasn't enough sauce for my taste! Aside from that, it was delicious. I used vegetable oil instead of safflower and wheat noodles. I will be making this again!

So good. Next time, I will double the green onion and sesame seeds. Would also be good with chicken or other veggies. Tried to thicken the sauce with reviewer suggestion of 1 cup chicke broth and 1 tsp of cornstarch but it didn't work. Want to try thickening again.

I have made this recipe several times and I get rave reviews each time it is served, especially at pot-lucks.   I have served it cold at cook outs.  I have also served it warm with some chicken for a family dinner.  Once I added some peanut sauce (maybe 2 Tbsps) and that was amazing.

Excellent and very easy to prepare.  Like many other users, I found that cutting down the oil to just 4 tablespoons sesame oil and cutting down sugar to just 3 tablespoons makes a healthier version that is absolutely deliciously.  I also cut down the soy sauce to 3 tablespoons because this sauce has a very overpowering flavor, particularly if you decide to make the above changes as well.  Sweet and spicy! Perfect.

I make this sauce and refrigerate it immediately upon it cooling. I then portion out 1/3 cup at a time and toss it with enough soba noodles to serve my husband and me. This makes so much, it easily lasts 5 or six meals. I serve the noodles with stir fried veggies and shrimp or chicken. Also, I buy teriaki flavored chicken meatballs at my local supermarket and serve with my soba noodles and some broccoli, it's sort of Asian spaghetti and meatballs.  Anyway, excellent tasting and not at all hot in my opinion.

Delicious! I cut down the amount of Chili Garlic Sauce, but I regretted it, next time I'll keep the whole amount in, I think it would have improved the flavor.  I used whole wheat spaghetti noodles, and added fresh chopped cilantro at the end.  I also added some stir-fried cubed tofu. Great recipe - I'll be using this one again and again.

I did alter the recipe: Used 250 g. egg noodles and basically cut the ingredients into 1/3 what this recipe states (but the full amount of chile sauce.)  Since I used a sweet chile sauce, I did NOT include any sugar.  I let the green onions cook in the sauce a few minutes, to soften them.   It was not spicy enough for me so sprinkled red pepper flakes on top.   It was good, but next time, I will not cut the ingredients down so much; I think 1/2 would be better.

I made this tonight and I will for sure make it again! I forgot the green onion so I just left it out. I added chicken and used Sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds. It was wonderful. I feel like I don't need to go out for Thai anymore! At home is the place to be! :) Thanks!

Too oily for our taste.  I can't fairly rate this because I used Canola instead of Safflower oil.  I also cut this down to 4 servings.  Even with me cutting down the Canola oil to 1.5 TBS it tasted too oily.  I cut the sugar down to 2 TBS.  The rest I followed for 4 serving calculations.  I took someones advice and added 1/2 cup chicken stock with cornstarch, it took over a tsp to thicken up.  I also added sauted shrimp. This meal had potential.

I made this sauce exactly as stated and it was fantastic.  I used fresh linguine and added sauteed chicken, red pepper, carrot, broccoli and water chestnuts.  This was delicious hot or cold.  I will definitely make this one again.

This turned out great without cooking the sauce. I made it three times before I came back here and noticed that I was supposed to boil the sauce!  I didn't have any problem with undissolved sugar. I suppose eating fresh garlic might be a problem for some people but everyone here loved it.

Looking at all the variations people have posted here, it seems like it's hard to go wrong with this recipe. I added more sesame oil in place of some of the safflower. I also added less sugar and more hot sauce.

Some people have advocated adding corn starch to thicken the sauce. I used capellini (which looks like thin spaghetti) instead of the linquini and there was absolutely no sauce left in the bottom of the bowl (so I didn't need any corn starch).

This stuff is addictive!

The noodles were very good. Next time I will reduce the amount of oil by a couple of tablespoons.  6 tablespoons was too much. But overall, my family enjoyed the sesame noodles.

This was delicious!  I scaled it down to make 2 servings because I wanted to try it first.  Used a little less sugar and oil than called for.  Next time i'll make a full batch.  Could easily customize this by adding chicken, veggies, etc.  Even better cold!

I absolutely love this recipe. It's great when it's served hot, and even better the next day when eaten cold as leftovers. It's become a potluck/picnic standard of mine, as it keeps really well and is perfect for gatherings where people have animal-product diet restrictions (it's vegan if you don't make it the way I usually like to make it, which involved adding grilled chicken to the sauce as it cooks).

Yummy - my changes were adding the sesame oil near the end instead of boiling with the rest of the sauce. Also, I threw the noodles into a hot skillet & then added the sauce, letting it all cook together for a few minutes. I added marinated chicken pieces to the noodles, which was yummy as well. Next time I plan to add a veggie like broccoli or squash & maybe a cornstarch / warm water mix to the sauce, just as a thickener. The taste was more sweet than spicy & went very well with the teriyaki chicken.

This is a great recipe that can be tweaked to fit any personal preference.  I added pork to mine, increased the garlic and decreased the suger and oil slightly.  I'd like to try this sauce with Soba noodles sometime!

delicious!! i used regular pasta and cooked it a little more so it would be softer. i follwoed rutgercat's instructions and put 4 tbs sugar. i didnt have green onions and i added chopped regular white onions. i held off putting 3 tbs of sesame oil until the end because my mom always said its not healthy to cook sesame oil - it certaintly enhanced the flavor of sesame oil -yummy! i only put about 5 tbs of rice vinegar and used regular hot sauce - 1tbs in place of chili sauce. thank you for the recipie! my dad loved it and usually's hes picky

I made this for a group of friends at a party and at the end there was not any left! It was not to runny and the noodles did soak up the flavor and there was some sauce on the bottom but the noodles have the perfect taste and amount on them. I added vegetables before i served it, tossed it and it came out very good. I am making it again. and I am new to cooking- Thanks!

This was a great change for dinner!  I made sauted chicken with it - and it was soooo good.  I did cut the oil in half but used all the same measurements for everything else.  I also add a little fresh cilantro at the end because I just love it!  It is quite watery once you dump it all together - but tastes great!!!

I will admit that I cut the recipe down to 1/4 because I just wanted enough for my dinner for one person. I also didn't use as much sugar, and had to sub olive oil for safflower oil, and use a different vinegar just because thats what I had on hand. I thought it was good, but I am sure it would be better with all the right ingredients. I will try it again, and probably add some more vegetables. I think broccoli and zucchini, or maybe even some sauteed cabbage would be really good. Thanks for a base recipe.

I think the key here is to put the noodles and the sauce in a big skillet and fry them for a few minutes.  If you just dump the sauce on top, it's very runny.  What I did was saute some mushrooms, broccoli, and cauliflower in a big skillet while the noodles cooked, salted the veggies, removed them to a plate, dumped in the noodles and sauce, and kind of stir fried them for about 5 minutes, then added the veggies back in.  Turned out quite well!  I altered the sauce ingredients by reducing the sugar and vinegar and adding a bit of mirin for some of the vinegar, and it turned out that the chili sauce I bought was sweet (rather than hot) so my noodles were sweeter than they were spicy.  Had to add some salt and I think white pepper and fish sauce would be good additions.  All in all, it was quite tasty and I recommend adding some veggies.

The flavor is great, but the recipe, as written, is a tad oily for me.  It's a sweet and spicy dish, which I love. Next time I'll be adding some veggies and some ginger, as other reviewers have suggested. Oh and if you don't have the safflower oil, canola works fine.  So yummy, thanks for the recipe!

My family absolutely loves this. I have kinda made my own version though. Instead of safflower oil, i use vegetable oil (just bc it was on hand) but i only use 4 tablespoons instead of 6. I also add mushrooms, onions, green peppers, and chicken. And I only use 4 tablespoons of sugar. It is a total hit!!!!

Very easy and cheap to make. I make this dish for my friends all the time and they love it! I add different veggies to it each time, such as bell peppers, broccoli, baby corn and pretty much anything I have on hand. It's great with tofu, too!

I LOVE this recipe.  I have been looking for a good sesame noodle recipe for a long time and when I first saw this recipe I thought it was too simple.  Low and behold it is the best I have tasted!    I use Asian noodles rather than liguine and I add more sesame seeds and green onions than called for.  All in all it is a 5 star dish.

I made this straight from the recipe, and it's very good!  I'm pregnant and craving this restaurant fav all the time.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because, compared to the restaurant versions I'm used to, it has no heat to go with the sweet.  I added crushed red pepper, which helped... but I'll add hot oil to it next time I make it.  And I WILL be making it again SOON!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

great recipe - left out the soy for my husband (allergic) and added 1 tlb fish sauce and two tlb natural peanut butter. Also stir fried thin strips of beef and added bag of Chinese veggies. Added soy tableside for the rest of us - yummy! edit - instead of beef, I have also added stir fried tofu which I like even better. NO sugar - 2 packets of splenda and it is perfect!

All I can say is that I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED these noodles!  I don't think I have ever had sesame noodles before, but I will be making them again for sure!  Used Udon noodles instead of linguine, and threw in some broccoli and snap peas for colour! YUMMY!

I just made this tonight, we all thought it was very good but my wife LOVED it. Very simple to make, the ingredients were easy to find in the asian food section at the grocery store. I followed the recipe as written, except I used canola oil in placed of the safflower oil. It took about 10 minutes to make, start to finish. I will definitely make this again soon.

So good! i made these for dinner last night and they were a huge hit! I wanted it to be a meal instead of a side dish so i added asparagus, brocolli, and red bell peppers(steamed them before tossing with the sauce) I also added ginger for flavor and grilled chicken for protien. The only thing i would do different next time would be to cut back on the oil... it really does not need that much.

Delicious!! This is the best sesame noodle recipe I've tried. I do adjust the amounts of ingredients, usually less oil, more sesame seeds and more chili sauce depending on how spicy I want it that day.

Great! I used instant oriental egg noodles which made this super quick on top of tasty. The only thing I changed was omitting the green onions as I didn't have any.

Delicious! I used vegetable instead of safflower, and added about half the amount of oil and sugar. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly, added some steamed broccoli, and got a ton of compliments. Everyone at the potluck loved it.

This is the best thing I have put in my mouth in I don't know how long! I made them for dinner and I'm not sure there will be any left to serve. I used soba noodles because I had some in my pantry but I will be making these soon with some whole wheat linguini. These noodles will be in my fridge all summer!!!! Thank you so much scoopnana!

Very tasty! Based on reviews I cut back to 3T oil, 3T sugar and slightly less than 2t chili sauce. Next time will try with homemade noodles and might add some meat and veggies- but it is great as is.

These were good with a reduced amount of oil & sugar.   Next time I make this I will stir fry some vegetables, add chicken and reduce the oil even more.  They seemed greasy and I only added 2 Tbsp. Safflower Oil and 2 Tbsp. Sesame Oil.  I added about 2 1/2 Tbsp. of sugar.

Simply good. I only had half a package of linguine so I decreased everything. Next time, I think I would double the sauce because it was just so good. Served with 2 types of Chicken Katsus ("Chicken Katsu" and "Ashley's Chicken Katsu with Tonkatsu Sauce") and "Cucumber Sunomo."

Fantastic!  I used whole wheat boxed linguine.  Used veg oil in place of safflower oil and used much less than it calls for.  I mixed in sugar snap peas at the very end.  Everyone loved it and it tasted even better leftover!

Most excellent!  I was glad I cut the sugar in half as some reviewers had suggested.  I also reduced the amount of oil to 4T and felt that was more than enough.  This came together very quickly - I had dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes. Wonderful flavor - I can't wait to try this cold!  Thank you for posting this recipe.

The rice vinegar was overpowering...not only in the taste but also the smell throughout the house as it was cooking.   I will try this recipe again without it.

This makes a good base for noodles dishes. I haven't given this 5 stars as I only used the recipe as a guide. I added freshly chopped ginger and chilli and used fresh egg noodles instead of pasta. Garnished the noodles with fresh coriander and eating it right now with some freshly steamed dumplings..... Delish!

OMG this is the best ever!! I have tried others and they were not very good. We couldn't stop eating it and my picky daughter loved it as well.I made the changes that everyone else had suggested. Cut the suger and oil by half, used peanut oil and added carrots, snow peas and chicken. I also thickened it with a cup of chicken broth and some corn starch. This will be a staple on our house from now on Thanks You!!

Truly delicious! I threw in three times the sesame seeds and some sauted broccoli rabe, insanely good. The greens helped cut the oily nature of the sauce.

Excellent!
I added extra soy sauce.
Next time I will cook the garlic a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients. 
Based on other reviews, I added the pasta in the pan with the sauce and it turned out great.
Thanks for sharing.

This is good after it sits for a while. However, the amount of soy sauce is a bit too much. I will add less next time. Also, how is 1 tsp. of sesame seeds supposed to do anything. I added 1/4 cup. Much better.

This was good, a bit too sweet for me though.  I used canola oil and cut the amt. in half, also halved the sesame oil.  I used chili paste and just one tsp and put in one tablespoon of sesame seeds.  I also added some shredded carrots.  I didn't have the patience to chill in the fridge and my sauce was soupy at the bottom of the bowl....maybe chilling would've reduced that somewhat, we'll see how the leftovers are.  Some chopped peanuts or cashews would be good sprinkled on top.

Amazing flavor.  I just loved this recipe.  I did cut down on the oil, as others suggested.  Doubled the chili sauce, cuz I like spicey!  We all thought it was wonderful, thanks for submitting!

Made this for dinner tonight and thought it was really good with asian sesame marinated grilled chicken.  Served it cold and cut back on the sugar by 1/2, added some chopped red & green peppers to the pasta water just so they par-boiled a little and used a Thai sweet chili sauce b/c that's what I had on hand.  Used WAY more sesame seeds too.  Thanks for posting!

I had to use vege oil instead of the safflower & did not have any green onions, but this turned out delish!  Next time I will make sure to have some green onions on hand & will probably use a thinner pasta, like spaghetti.  This went great with Maple Salmon (also from this site).

I think that this dish has the potential to be amazing but...as written, it is WAY too oily.  I would definitely recommend cutting the oil by at least half. Other than this I thought the dish was great.  I added some edamame and shredded carrots to the noodles for some extra flavor and texture and I thought they blended in very nicely.

I used Chinese Mie noodles instead of linguine and black sesame seeds for color. Very tasty!

This recipe was OK, but I expected more flavor.  The kids did love it, however. My 9 year old daughter and all her friends dug right in!  I took it to a swim meet.  It was great because it was chilled and ready to go on a hot night!

Having made it a second time, I don't know what I didn't like about this recipe!  I halved the recipe and served it with some leftover teriyaki grilled chicken. I cut the sugar back, using only 1 T in the half recipe I made. I might cut the oil back by about 1/3, as there was plenty of liquid in the sauce.  Oh yes, somehow when I read chili sauce, my brain read chili oil.  I actually loved it that way and thought the kick was perfect! Will definitely make again!

These were okay, but the flavour lacked depth. I wonder if the addition of more vegetables or chicken would be better.

I think this recipe is great.  I'm giving it a five because it has great potential.  I think given the nature of the spices it is important to add the ingredients according to your taste.  For some people the recipe was too oily, spicy, or sweet.  I think that this recipe gives any prospective sesame noodle maker the basic ingredients to make a sesame noodle salad.  I think people who use this recipe should use their best judgment and taste the marinade as they go along.  I personally only used 3 tbsps. of all of the recipes that went into the marinade and one teaspoon (not tbsp) of chili sauce (the lan-chi brand).  I also added 1/2 red bell pepper sliced and 1/2 small onion sliced (didn't have the green onions).Good work!

These were very good.   I used a Chinese-style thinner noodle instead of linguini.  Also, I would recommend putting some cornstarch in the sauce to thicken it up, since most of it stayed on the bottom of the pan and it was soupy.  Also, maybe more chili sauce for a zing.

These were good, I think a little too spicy for my taste. I added some shrimp that i had sauted in garlic, and some crushed roasted peanuts on top, i think that made it a four star.... But they were good, my husband liked them. I only added 4T of sugar to start with and ended up adding about 5 1/2 T by the end, afterall, sesame anything is usually supposed to be pretty sweet??? Thanks for the recipe.

TERRIBLE! I actually couldn't serve this it was so bad. I didn't add as much sugar, but ended up adding the rest to try and save it. I followed the rest to a t. All we could taste was oil. EWWWW!

This is my new staple.  I cut the oil and sugar down to 5 tbls each.  It was still a little too sweet.  I'll decrease it even more to 4 tbls next time.  My kids loved it. The texture is perfect - not too dry and sticky.

I did not have chili paste but I did have a little chili oil I added in and I used canola instead of safflower.  Thanks for a great dish!

We thought this sauce was easy to make and very tasty, although I did change it a little.  I used less sugar and no safflower oil, and cut the chili paste in half.  We put it on egg noodles, on couscous with chick peas...my husband really loves this stuff!

Nice flavor and practically no prep time, but uber-greasy, and I had to make a lot of adjustments.  In fact, I think only the ingredients stayed the same - quantities all changed.  I ended up using: 5 Tbsp sugar (and it was still too sweet), 3 Tbsp olive oil, 5 Tbsp rice vinegar, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, and 2 Tbsp sesame oil.  Plus, I didn't have chili sauce/paste, so I created my own using cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, 1 tsp tomato sauce, and cayenne.

Pretty good.  I used 5 TB of sugar instead of 6, but it was still a tad too sweet.  Still, it made a nice side dish that my girlfriend and I both enjoyed.

These noodles are delicious.  My husband thought they tasted better than a restaurant.  The only changes I made were I added peanut butter and instead of the oil listed I used a mixture of hot garlic oil and olive oil along with the chili oil.  I also used rice noodles and topped it with garlic chicken from this website.  It doesn't get much better than that!

These noodles were excellent & had a great sesame flavor but not over done. I think next time I will reduce the amount of oil. It really doesnt need as much safflower & I think it will coat just fine with only a couple tbsp.

Great tasting recipe!  I used canola for the safflower oil...otherwise, I followed the recipe to the T.  Could make half the sauce recipe, I think.  There was a ton of it in the bottom of the bowl.  Also, I used whole wheat linguine from a box.  Would be great as a cold pasta salad with some blanched broccoli, shredded carrot and pea pods!

This is a great easy recipe.  I served this instead of rice for a stir-fry dinner and everyone loved it!  This is great leftover too, and the flavor really does compare to what you get in an oriental restaurant.

YUM! I made it for the first time tonight. I made a couple changes..I used vegetable oil instead of safflower oil because I didn’t have any. I added 1/2 red bell pepper for color and flavor. I also added rotisserie chicken to it to make a well rounded meal. I added some crushed red pepper to add a little spice. My husband said it’s like we are at an asian restaurant and loved it. I loved it too.

I halved the sauce part but kept the pasta amount the same. I used brown sugar for the white and Sambal for the chili paste. I used this to clean out my fridge, I had two small chicken breasts and some vegies to use up. My family loved it! Very flexible and easy dinner.

This was really tasty. It had a kick of spice. It would be great served with chicken or shrimp. Definitely will make it again.

Excellent. Made it exactly as written. Next time I will only add meat and vegetables just to make it a main dish, but no changes to the base recipe.  It isn’t too oily or sweet as some reviews say.

no changes and made it many many times.  My grandchildren love it as do I.  Ive made it numerous times with the peanut butter and Chineses sesame paste and prefer this recipe to that one.  True I am allergic to peanuts which is why I switched and Im happy as can be with this recipe.

Wonderfully complex flavors. Added 3 tablespoons of dark soy sauce and 1/2 tsp oyster sauce. Also added 1 tablespoon of corn starch to thicken and coat noodles better. Threw in some shrimp and had a perfect dinner!

Added 1 de-seeded piri-piri (or thai chili), and a handful of uncooked greebeans cut into 3 on the diagonal.  There are any number of veggies and chili you could add to this. Just an FYI the Thai chili is about 10-15 times hotter that a jalapeño, about max for my kids. Anything hotter should be served alongside.  We like sweet roasted ghost chili sauce too. The kids just dip their chopsticks in it . 
Cheers

Oozing flavors, who knew spaghetti has chutzpah to act in an asian dish.  Here are my edits, based our taste and made it for NY eves pot luck.

Minus: 2 tbs of vinegar, 2 tbsp of oil, 2 tbs of sugar
Plus:  6 serrano chillies, 0.25 inch of ginger fine shreds, 2tbps of crunchy peanut butter
used whole wheat sphagetti as well.

This was delicious. I made the sauce exactly as written and loved it. We didn’t think it was spicy at all so next time we may add a little more kick. We added in vegetables to make it more hearty. There were no left overs.

As is, I felt like this was a bit too vinegary and garlicky. I added some honey to balance it out a bit and ended up blending the sauce so there weren’t any chunks of garlic and it was still heavy on the garlic. It was a tasty base for our stir fry, though.

The recipe as I made it was good, but the directions weren't complete. What am I supposed to do with the minced garlic? Should it be boiled? I used the garlic raw, but fewer than six cloves.
 Ok, I found the directions for the garlic. They were there the whole time. But I'm sticking to raw garlic and probably less sugar next time.

I would rate this recipe a 4 because it was a good meal but I found it a little lacking in flavor. Added some extra soy sauce when eating. I also made chicken and tempeh to go along with it and add some protein. Like some other reviews, I added 1 t cornstarch and veggie broth to thicken the sauce and added red peppers, cilantro, carrots, and edamame! Will be making this again... just with some changes to the sauce - maybe some honey instead of sugar...

LOVE this dish - make it with tennis shaped pasta and serve it at tennis matches.  Add thinly sliced red/yellow peppers as well as cilantro.  Always gets high reviews :)

I love this recipe. I make it every time I do Chinese. But in place of chili paste, I use siracha and it really makes a difference. So good.

Awesome base recipe! I substituted teriyaki sauce for soy sauce,reduced the sugar by half and added grilled chicken and mushrooms. I doubled the recipe because I made it for 6 and it all got gobbled up and everyone had seconds. This is a keeper!

Made this one night for my wife and I. We loved the taste and the ease of making it. Definitely on our list of easy meals. We added shrimp to this and the shrimp added that wonderful texture! Next time will add a Picture for you.

This recipe turned out better than I thought, mainly in part because I read some of the reviews first.  I gave it 3 stars because of the adjustments that I had to make.    I think that if I followed the original recipe, it might have been too oily and the vinegar would have been overpowering.  
*I used angel hair pasta because I thought the linguine noodles would have been too wide (and I didn’t want to buy another pasta to add to the three different types of noodles I have in my cupboard)  
*Since I am trying to cut down on the amount of sugar we consume in the house, I cut the sugar from 6 tablespoons to 4.  
*I used 3 tablespoons of safflower oil
*I used 5 tablespoons of rice vinegar and while I thought it was fine, my fiancé felt that it was too much.
*I let the noodles simmer in the sauce in hopes that it would flavor the noodles and thicken the sauce.  
I was a little disappointed, given that this recipe was rated so high and I had to make several modifications.  Everyones taste is different, so maybe the original recipe worked.
 
I will try this again, but next time, I will add shrimp and an extra tablespoon of sesame oil and reduce the number of tablespoons of rice vinegar to four.

Delicious warm or cold.  Reduced sugar to 5 tablespoons and reduced oil to 4 tbsp (3 tbsp veg and 1 tbsp sesame).  Added some grated ginger to the garlic.  Add red peppers, carrots strips and green onion for color.  Great for potlucks.

We love this recipe. Its definitely one of our go to recipes that I have memorized and can throw together in a pinch. It's really adjustable for your tastes so that makes it even better. This recipe is awesome! I do add a bit of cornstarch sometimes to make it a bit thicker but the key is to boil the all the sauce ingredients for a long time so they get thick on their own. It makes a great carmelized sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was just NOT very good.  Very vinegary, sweet, and oily, but not a lot of flavor.  I used canola instead of safflower oil, and I used Sriracha sauce where it called for chili sauce (not sure what kind of chili sauce was intended).

Im not a fan of chinese food, its tasteless to me. But i give this recipe a chance. Scale down the noodles for 2 but made the sauce for 4 person. So it will be more flavorful.  I use prawns and i love it. Will definitely will do this again

Flavor of this would be better if it were more spicy and less sweet. It was also too oily. If I could go back I'd remove the noodles once combined with the sauce, leaving behind the excess sauce and fry it in a pan for a little bit with a few teaspoons of water to prevent sticking.

I made this recipe after reading a number of reviews. So I made a few adjustments based on what I had on hand and my taste: used 900g of linguine, used a little less than 3 tbs of vegetable oil, increased sesame oil to 2 tbs, added fresh grated ginger, increased the amount of garlic, was more generous with the chopped green onion and sesame seeds for garnish.  The result was still a pretty bland, oily dish. I had family over and they ate it with fewer ooos and aaahhs than usual. Had lots of left overs and had some the next day. It tasted much better and that's why I'm giving this recipe 4****. Will have to remember that allowing the dressing to steep into the linguine overnight improves the taste. Perhaps this is why some reviewers have suggested using fresh or homemade linguine.

I made these for 2 chinese exchange students that were staying with us for a week.  They asked for " noodles" so this is what I found for them.  One gal said " This tastes like Chinese food".  She ate them for dinner and breakfast.   I added some chicken for breakfast one day.  I also added ginger to the recipe and used Trader Joe's everything bagel seasoning because I didnt have any white sesame seeds.

I omitted the chili sauce and followed one of the previous versions and used fresh ginger.  I then used the same sauce recipe, added 4 T peanut butter powder & 1/2 C chunky peanut butter and made peanut chicken.

This makes an EXCELLENT side dish without meat. I can't wait to make it again with stir-fried chicken as a main dish. The only thing I changed was that I used vegetable oil instead of safflower (it's what I had on hand) and I added just a couple more drops of sriracha to my own bowl. Absolutely loved it.

I thought there might have been just a little two much oil.  I might keep the sesame oil the same but cut back on the other oil next time.  But I still gave it five stars because I enjoyed it but my teenager raved about it and requested it more often.  I marinated some chicken I cubed then stir fried it for a little heartier meal.

I cut sugar by 1/3 and left out the chili sauce (left out the chili sauce by mistake). This was A-MA-ZING!!!

In the next round, I put the chili sauce in there, and it was still really good, but better without it.

My family loved this recipe. I ended up doubling the sauce and added broccoli, carrots, onions, and peppers. I also added some chicken to give it some protein. I will definitely be making this again. I didn't have safflower oil so I used regular vegetable oil and it came out just fine. I also added a lot more garlic than it called for since we're big into tons of garlic in our food. I also added about two teaspoons more sesame oil than the doubled sauce recipe called for to enhance the sesame flavor.

I had this at a friend's and loved it so had to make it myself. It was very flavorful but too much liquid at the bottom of serving bowl. Next time I will cut back on some of the liquid  as it was too much. I would definitely reduce the amount of oil, vinegar, and soy sauce - reduce to 1/4 each rather than 6 tablespoons.

Super tasty!!!  I love sesame flavoured dishes and this one does not disappoint. I made it as a side dish, but it would work really well as a main with some chicken chunks and veggies tossed in it. I made a couple of changes. I used 4 Tbsp of peanut oil in place of the safflower oil. I also cut back the sugar to 4 Tbsp. I reduced the chilli paste by half, and added 1 tsp of puréed ginger as well. The box of linguine I had was 14oz, but for the amount of sauce I had left over I could have easily coated two boxes, so next time I will reduce the amount of each ingredient by half for one full box of pasta. My husband loved it so much he had three helpings. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was looking for a way to jazz up noodles for a side dish and this was delish! I  used vegetable oil instead of the oil listed as that is all I had on hand. Two of the three kids loved it and so did I! It was simple to make and next time I might try some peanut butter in it as it kinda reminded me of pad thai which I love.

These were wonderful. Just a slight hint of flavour. Served this with some Asian meatballs and an Asian salad. Next time would halve recipe as this made a lot of noodles. Heated leftovers the following day and they were a little oily so I feel they are best eaten when they are made. Added a little fresh minced ginger, reduced sugar to 3tbs and oil to 4tbs as per other suggestions. Our store doesn't have safflower oil so used peanut oil instead. Will definitely make these again.

This is incredible. I'm glad I read reviews bc I used 4 tbsp olive oil (bc that's what I had) and 5Tbsp sugar. Could easily lower to 3 and 4 next time. Mixed in a little cornstarch to thicken and cooked the noodles in the sauce at the end for about 5-10 minutes so it absorbed all the sauce.  The taste is phenomenal and your house will smell amazing.

Delicious and a big hit for young and old alike.  I followed the recipe but did add some minced ginger.  This would make a quick one-dish meal with some added chicken or shrimp.

EXCELLIENT!!! Only change I made - I used 1 tsp of chilli paste instead of 2 tsps
Added chunks of cooked chicken breast.
Big hit!!! I will make this again & again!

It tastes great and will make again. I made half of the serving, and reduced the rice vinegar from 3 to 2 Tbs.  I added sweet soy sauce ( I bought that from Asian grocery store ).. delicious !

Great recipe. Everyone loved it. Only changes I made was using two tbs of honey in place of the sugar and grape seed oil instead of safflower oil.  Also used a lot more sesame seeds and at the end added crushed peanuts.

I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it and made adjustments, added ginger and tofu, veggies. Both my boyfriend and son loved it. I made it for a carb load for my son before a triathlon and seemed to do well. Thanks. Will definitely make again!

I made these noodles last night as a light summer dinner. The only change I made was to cut down on the sugar. I did 2T instead of 6. It was pretty good! I also added grilled chicken to make it more of a main dish. It was easy to make and very flavorful. Good recipe!

If anyone was wondering....fish sauce in place of soy sauce works beautifully. Didn't have the soy...thought I had the soy didn't have the soy, so in the fish sauce went and PHEW delish.

I will definitely make this again. I made it for the 4th of July and served it cold. I cut back on the liquids as a friend suggested. However, next time I will use the original amount. I like it to have some liquids to keep it flavorful. Also, next time I will use a spicy Asian chili sauce to compliment the sweetness. This time I used a regular chili sauce. I added more sesame seeds than it called for and I did use the sesame oil and safflower oil it called for., not substituting other oils.  I might add baby shrimp next time!

This recipe has been standard fare at all my pool parties and whenever a group of kids are around. I don't think I've met one kid who doesn't like it. However, I don't use the chili oil, just because I don't want to surprise anyone, especially a child. Also, I tone down the garlic a bit. I often make 4 lbs of noodles and quadruple the recipe for the sauce. Usually this leaves a bit of leftover sauce. My friends fight over this leftover -- they want to take it home!. Be sure to COOK THE SAUCE. I've had more than one friend claim their noodles didn't turn out as well as mine and they admit that they don't think they cooked the sauce. :)

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers to cut both the oil and sugar in half and also added the linguine to the sauce and let it cook down a bit. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe to the letter but did add a bag of partially cooked sugar snap peas, red bell pepper, ginger,  a Tablespoon or so of chopped fresh basil, and a package of diced teriyaki-flavored baked tofu. We loved it and I'll be making it again soon!

This was very good & even better the next day!  I didn't have fettuccine noodles so I used spaghetti.  I also added some cubed chicken, shredded carrots, chopped mushrooms, green onions & Ginger.  I think Bok Choy or kale would be good too.  A meal in a bowl!  Next time I will reduce the oil, but otherwise a great  recipe!

We liked this. I used Hoisin sauce but next time will use a chili sauce for more kick. Served garlic shrimp on the side. Surprise. Jake loved this and Riley did too. Stick with Hoisin sauce for the kids. For the two of us, I   Think I would combine this recipe with Pork lo Mein also from this site. Has added veggies and meat. 2 - 454g boxes filled large red casserole dish

I always like things a little spicy, so I used more garlic than called for, 2-3 extra cloves, and when adding the chili sauce, I threw in a little extra there too.  But other than that, I did as specified in the recipe.  Everyone I have made it for has loved it, and my husband and I have had it hot and cold, it's great either way (although I think we prefer hot).  I will be making it again, and again, and again!

EASY DELICIOUS. Loved the flavour. I used corn oil instead of safflower oil, hoisin instead of chili sauce. Could use chili paste next time. Very good as is. I wanted more of a meal so sauteed chicken tenders cubed small salt and pepper and ginger added to noodles with peas and a little shredded carrots. Very nice. Would make again.

This is by far my favorite. I did add micro grated ginger and extra sriracha to the sauce. About 2 teaspoon of ginger and I put 1 tablespoon of the chili sauce, sriracha. I added carrots snow peas red and orange sweet peppers green onion and finally basil. The vegetables are all thinly sliced lengthwise. I chill it and serve cold. It is to die for.

Really good flavor.  The only issue I ran into was that the sauce was much too runny.  I added the noodles to the sauce over high heat, stirring constantly, until it came to the right consistency.  I was surprised that 6 garlic cloves and 6 tablespoons of sugar wasn't overkill.

Wonderful flavor. I did make quite a few changes/additions, but the base is the same.  Used brown rice spaghetti noodles so gluten free.  Used 3 tbsp Truvia baking blend in place of 6 Tbsp sugar. Added 1 cup chicken broth thickened with glucomannon powder to make more sauce since adding veggies and meat.  Could have used cornstarch.  Added 4 cups red cabbage and a lb of chopped chicken. Left out the sesame seeds.I also subbed olive oil for safflower oil since that's what I had on hand.  2 of my kids ages 12 and 9 loved it as did I.

Absolutely delicious!  The only changes I made was using only 3 T. sugar and just used the sesame oil only.  Everything else as stated.  Added shrimp also.  Thanks for sharing.  Will most certaintly be putting this into my "to keep" folders.

I increased the garlic to a whole head and added some sliced jalapeño to give it a little kick. Added some shrimp about 2-3 minutes before tossing it with the pasta, then sprinkled a little chopped cilantro on top at the end.

I didn't realize I'd run out of a few ingredients and had to substitute canola oil for the safflower, and Apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar. I might cut back on sugar next time, maybe add some crushed red pepper for a bit of kick. But all and all this turned out well and I'll make again!

It tasted very good, however, I found it too greasy. I just cut out the saffron oil and it still tasted good and wasn't as oily.  Also, when I don't have green onions, I like to put in shredded carrots. It adds color and is tasty too.

It's ok as to flavor, but the sauce is too thin and it's very oily. It's very messy to make and eat. The sauce doesn't cling to the noodles; it's a watery puddle under it.  I tried cooking the sauce longer to reduce it but it becomes too acidic.

Fantastic recipe as is. The only thing I changed was adding some cornstarch to the liquids, just to help it thicken a bit. We eat it both hot and cold. Just depends on whether I make it in advance. For those with little ones like myself, just take some of the sauce out before you add the sriracha. No biggie :)

I love these noodles! Very quick and easy to make, and I can add veggies and meat to make them into a full meal. I make this recipe several times a month and pack the leftovers for lunch. The flavor is fantastic, but I recommend letting them sit in the fridge overnight because the noodles really absorb the flavor. I cut the  safflower oil down to 3 tbsp, because they are very oily with 6 tbsp.

I thought this recipe had a solid starting out recipe. I feel like its missing a little depth. I would definitely cut back on the vinegar. Its way to much and leaves a bitter after taste. The scallions and toasted seseame seeds are perfect with it. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and used sweet chili sauce.

I always start with the sauce in this recipe. Then I  use soba noodles instead of linguine. I also add a cooked vegetable like steamed broccoli or sauteed green beans.  It's very versatile. The noodles and sauce are the stars of the show. A family favorite!

This recipe is amazing. I've never received so many complements and recipe requests as I did when serving this dish! I did reduce the sugar to 2 tbs. and used brown sugar instead of white. I also added fresh ginger, chopped chicken breast, and veggies, which I sauteed with sesame oil before adding to the noodles. For nice presentation, I topped this dish with chopped cilantro and chopped peanuts.

Love these noodles! I've made them many times and this dish is my go to crowd pleaser. No matter how much I make it's always gone, usually before any other dish.
I do agree with other reviews about using about half the amount of oil and I use 4 tbl sugar.
 I also amp up the garlic and spice unless I'm going somewhere with lots of kids. And usually I'll toss in some grated carrott to make it more colorful.
 Easy and versatile. I've made it gluten free for a friend & it was great. Use whole wheat noodles sometimes and everyone still loved it, sometimes I'll add in chicken or steak. Right now I'm dying to try shrimp. I can guarantee it will be AMAZING!!!

I made this yesterday. I cut the recipe in half because I am single. Had a craving for noodles with a Asian sauce. I LOVED it. It was over a hundred degrees here in the desert, so I decided to serve it (cold). Yummy!!! I added a bag of Asian stir-fry veggies to it and only substituted canola oil for the safflower oil, as it was all I had, and added (1) more tsp. chile sauce because I like my food a bit more on the spicy side. It was absolutely delicious...This one stays in my favorite recipes and is great as a meal on a very hot day. Wish I had leftovers for today but it was soooo good that I ended up eating all of it! Thank-you for the recipe...Cindy

I loved this recipe. I made changes by using a green vegetable linguine noodle, hot sesame oil, green pepper and sprouts and onion (on hand) and cut back on the sauces by a half. I also cooked chicken breasts and added them with some smoked turkey. The family loved it and my  veggie free teen even liked it- Sssh!

Family loved it. Made this twice in one week. First time I used rice noodles and the second time made with spaghetti noodles. Both tasted amazing.

I thought this was very flavorful and tweaked according to my needs...the kids actually ate all the veggies in it, so that alone makes it a resounding success in my house.  Followed other recommendations and added a few of my own: 1) reduced pasta to 8 oz ( (I am trying to reduce carbs) 2) added bag of broccoli florets that I had steamed with a large handful of shredded carrots and a sliced onion 3) reduced oil to 3 TBSP 4) added 1 cup chicken broth with 1TBSP cornstarch blended in to thicken the sauce 5) added 1 TSP ground ginger to the mix before boiling 6) omitted sesame seeds.  This made a very flavorful, colorful, HEALTHY side dish that even my incredibly picky kids enjoyed. I can't wait to try it cold as well, because the reduced fat content should make it taste better chilled. Thx for the great recipe scoop nana!

This was good the first time, but way too oily, as others have commented so I couldn't give it 5 stars. The flavor though, was so intriguing, that I wanted to try it again, but with adjustments to the recipe, it was superb.   Since there is sesame oil in it, I left out the safflower oil and cut the vinegar by half.  Added 1 teaspoon grated ginger.  Oh my!  I also only used half the amount of pasta, since I didn't think there was enough sauce for a pound of pasta.  Another time I cut up a large chicken breast into bite size pieces, stir fried the meat, threw in sliced raw mushrooms and quartered sliced zucchini.  Added to the noodles, it was a complete meal.  Next time I am going to use shrimp.  Leftover pork or chicken would be great too.  Very flexible recipe.

This recipe was really easy to execute and came together in less than 30 minutes. Also, it is addicting and delicious. I added steamed broccoli and fake chicken for some vitamins and protein, and it worked great.

I really enjoy the versatility of this recipe. After trying it as written for the first time, I made these changes: Following other reviews, I reduce the oil and sugar by 1/3. I do sub chili oil for chili paste because it's what's in my pantry. Put a cup of edamame in it, along with some onion an orange pepper. For the initial serving, I heat the noodles in the sauce, per one recommendation and serve it warm. Put the rest in the fridge to serve as a cold salad. That way I have the best of both worlds. Thanks for posting.

Fabulous recipe - except I used Asian sweet chili sauce(1-2Tbls).  We absolutely love this - we have Japanese panko breaded pork thin cutlets with it.

This recipe is great, but like other reviewers, way too oily. I cut the amount of safflower oil in half (used olive oil instead) and kept all other measurements the same. Sweet and spicy, this was a win.

Oh wow!  This was delicioussss!  Everyone raved about it.  We cut the sugar in half, 4 tablespoons of safflower oil and rice wine vinegar instead of 6.  Cut the sesame oil in half because it's a very strong flavor. 1 tablespoon chili sauce and added 2 tablespoons mirin. We adjusted for our taste and it worked out great, but honestly even if we didn't adjust this recipe (other and the sugar) I'm sure it would be delicious. Oh and yea we used 9 ounces of FRESH pasta. Yum!

This pasta is  really good, the sugar gives it some sweetness, I think I  will add tofu next time. I didn't have rice vinegar so I added white wine vinegar which had the same effect.

We enjoyed this! I used brown sugar instead of white and chili garlic sauce. I did add some grated ginger as I was adding it to the marinade for my chicken. After I removed the pasta from the water, I boiled a large head of fresh broccoli flowerets for a few minutes until tender. I wish there had been leftovers because I wanted to try it cold, so I guess I will have to make it again! :)

This was an easy to make and flavorful noodle recipe. I did a couple of things differently from the original recipe. Fresh broccoli florets were added for that vegetable element. I added a little bit of minced ginger. This can be enjoyed warm or cold depending on your mood.

These noodles are delicious! Maybe I would use a bit less sugar and plain oil next time, though, and I think I would add more Sriracha (what I have on hand). I could see this being amazing with more veggies in it, too. I will definitely be making this again!

This was OK ... I cut down on the oil and sugar and it ended up being a little too vinegar-y. Will play around with the ratios. I made with cubed chicken and frozen stir fry vegetables and I think it would've been much better with fresh.

I served this warm and added some napa cabbage and broccoli.  I used whole wheat pasta as well.  It was a great mix of vinegar and sesame flavor!  I bet it would be great with some shrimps to add a bit of body to it.

I just tried this recipe tonight and I absolutely love it. It's so easy to prepare and it's good! You can pair this up with so many different things and I'm excited to try this again.  I added lobster chunks cooked with butter, garlic and shallots (just sauté for a few minutes until cooked - I would say about 3-4 minutes) and it turned out great.  I can see myself making this noodle and eating it cold also.

This was so delicious! Another winner from this wonderful website! A I was trying to keep costs down and had to purchase the rice vinegar, I substituted vegetable oil for the sesame oil and it still tasted wonderful! I was hesitant to use the full 6 TBSP soy so I stopped at 4 which turned out to be just right. The accompanying photo shows broccoli which wasn't in the recipe but I had planned on using. I think it's a must!I omitted the hot sauce and decreased the garlic due to family preferences. By the way toasting sesame seeds should've been part of the recipe but is easy and only takes a few minutes (3-5)dry pan, medium heat, shake occasionally. This one is super easy to make, goes together quickly and is the best Asian dish I have ever made! Definitely goes on the "have again" list!

Absolutely delicious! I'm not the type to review.  I've made this twice and used regular onion and threw in some frozen peas.  I LOVE noodles and I LOVE Asian dishes, so this was a match made in heaven.  As long as you have the ingredients it calls for (like rice vinegar, sesame oil) the flavor is perfect.  It won't be the same with white vinegar and other oils.

Really, really yummy. I was concerned by all the oil in here, but the end result is not oily. The nutrition on this is really helpful. You really have to be careful about portion size, so you don't kill your calorie allotment in one meal. Really good though.

Very good, I thought the sauce amount was fine, no doubling, although I did half the soy sauce. I used 1 tsp. dried ginger, and 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic.

I made according to recipe. It was much too sweet!  My daughters did not eat after a bite.  My husband thought it was good.  I think I would have liked it with a lot less sugar.

The sauce tasted just like lo mein. Here's the reason this is getting four stars: it was so runny. This was just like eating spaghetti or linguine with a bit of sauce. The lo mein you buy in restaurants is infused with that sauce. So, next time, (since I definitely, definitely want to keep experimenting with this), I'll cook the pasta for a while in the sauce to try to get it to infuse. Perfect flavor, though. Perfect!

This is definitely a different "take" on pasta!  I love it but plan to use less oil next time (and a tad of fresh grated ginger).

Delicious!  I used about 2/3 of many ingredients (everywhere it says "6", I went with "4".  Outstanding subtle flavors in a very tasty combination.  Superior complementary dish to your oriental meats.  Highly recommended!

Very good, though I will reduce the sugar slightly next time because it was a bit too sweet.  I sautéed some tofu and added it for some protein.

My family has decided to eat vegetarian at least 3x week so I've been trying all sorts of new recipes, including this one.  We thought it was pretty good with two very minor changes; we ate it hot for dinner and cold the next day leftover for lunch.  I  added steamed broccoli & cut baby corn to add texture, color and a serving of vegetables and substituted canola oil for the safflower oil because that's what I had.  My husband said it was 'too slippery' however to eat with chopsticks & there was quite a bit of leftover juice in the bowl. I may cut the liquid portion next time I make it.

Wow.  This is one of our favorites, because it's delicious and oh-so-easy to make.  We sub honey for sugar, but other than that no modifications are needed.  We love it so much that we simply add broccoli and call it a meal!  And I must say, making it with fresh linguine throws it over the top.

I tweaked a lot of things, but the result was fantastic. I used angel hair pasta because I don't like wide noodles (doesn't even really count as a change), used canola oil instead of safflower because that's what I had, added an extra garlic clove, halved the sugar, and added extra sesame oil and soy sauce. Next time I might use a little less vinegar too. I tossed it with sauteed broccoli, baby corn, water chestnuts, and bamboo shoots. YUM.

Best noodles EVER, is right!!!! I fried the sauce onto the noodles, which helps it to stick and carmelize. Served it with ginger chicken. The fam demolished it. Hubby requests I  make it again today. Thanks!

Very good. Hubby, 10 month old and 3 yr old loved it.  Made as suggested by recipe but added a bit of water and cornstarch at the end.  Also cooked veggies prior to making sauce and threw in cubed haddock at the end when the sauce was pretty much done.

This makes a wonderful light lunch. I've tried a few similar recipes and I like this dressing the best. I used thin whole wheat spaghetti, and I had some pea pods and cilantro on hand so I tossed that in too. I didn't have chili sauce on hand so I used 1 t chili oil and 1 t red pepper flakes. Next time I might add a few more veggies, like edamame and bean sprouts, to make it more nutritious and filling. I ate it hot but I think it would also be delicious as a cold salad.

I know people don't like to read reviews when people modify the recipe, but in this case, I had to do it. I would have rated the recipe probably a 3 star only if I would have made it as is. First, I did sub the safflower oil for canola oil because I didn't have any on hand. But I also reduced it to 3 T. I read reviews where people recommend 4 T but honestly, even with just 3 T, I thought it was pretty oily. Next time I make this recipe, I will bring it down to 2 T. Considering there's also an extra 2 T of sesame oil, we're not missing any oil by reducing it. I don't know how people can enjoy it with that much oil in it, especially when keeping the 6 T. Besides the oil, I also reduced the sugar to 3 T and that was perfect.  When cooking the sauce, I heated the canola oil and then added the garlic and cooked for about a minute to let the flavor come out. Then I added the rest of the ingredients (except for the sesame seeds and green onion). End result: yummy!!

This turned out really good. i used about two cloves of garlic instead of 6 and used canola oil instead of safflower oil because i didnt have any. im not sure if the type of oil made a difference but my noodles came out really greasy. maybe next time ill cut down on the oil. im sensitive to spicy foods so i had to use a lot less chili sauce. ill be making this again.

This recipe worked pretty well. I started out cutting the serving in half. I used fettucini noodles rather than linguine, which was a bad idea. Following other reviews, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 T and oil to 2 T. I also substituted in vegetable oil for the safflower oil. The sauce turned out well, just a bit too spicy for my girl. Next time, I'll add some chicken to make it seem more complete to me. Good and easy recipe!

I didn't think I would like these but they turned out great.   I made some changes based on other reviews such as cutting the oil, adding veggies, thickened with a tsp cornstarch dissovled in 3/4 c chicken broth, then mixed noodles and sauce together and cooked over high heat stirring frequently.  Yum!

SOOOO Yummy! Even my picky kids ate it!  I used vermicelli... For the sauce, I added a about a tsp of dijon mustard and about a tbs of creamy peanut butter (added in the last two minutes of cooking.)  The vermicelli sat cooked and in the strainer for about 5 minutes. I wanted every bit of water out. I added the sauce and let that sit to marry for another 5 minutes. Not only did this give me time to finish my other dinner foods, but gave some time for the noodles to soak up the sauce. then, I lightly "fried" the noodles a small batch at a time in sesame oil, to give the noodles a firm and crisp texture. I divided the noodles and added some stir fry veggies to one (my kids wouldnt eat water chesnuts and babycorn..) and left the other just as is. this dish is so complimentary and a nice change up from fried rice.   Will become a regular dish!

First thing I have ever reviewed because I LOVE it. Scaled it down a bit since I was cooking for only myself, but just perfect. I didn't have green onions, so I used some yellow onion and still delicious. Can't wait to make it with some chicken and extra veggies. Leftovers are heating up now! Time to eat!!!

This is really good if you change:
sugar: 3 tablespoons
safflower oil: 1-2 tablespoons (i did 3 and it was still oily. and vegetable is fine.)
soy sauce: 4 tablespoons (i found it a little salty and soy sauce tasting. i like soy sauce a lot less than most people though so your call. maybe do 5.)
chili sauce: i accidentally did 3 and it was fine. don't be scared. 

and of course i added chicken and sautéed veggies. yummmm....

was better cold but still plenty good hot.

Very tasty, I used vegetable oil instead. I cut it back to 4 T and went ahead with the 2 T of of sesame oil and still found it a tad to oily. I think 5T of rice vinegar and soy sauce each worked well. I also cut the sugar back to 3T. The next time I make this I will cut the vegetable oil back  further to 2T and add another t of chilli. Thank you, definitely a keeper! :)

This is amazing. I've tried in the past to make a sesame noodles recipe and it was just alright, but this is really good. I used stir fried chow mien noodles cooked in chicken stock, 2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce, 5 tablespoons sugar, 6 tablespoons vegetable oil, 4 tablespoons white vinegar, 1 tablespoons chicken stock, 6 tablespoons low sodium soya sauce, 3 overflowing tablespoons of sesame oil, and a ton of sliced green onions. I didn't have any toasted sesame seeds but I am sure that addition would only make it more amazing. Thank you so much for this recipe. If you are looking for something super quick, super easy and super tasty, then this is the recipe for you.

very good and easy.  I used what one reviewer suggested of the 1/3 cup instead of 6 tablespoons.  Worked like a charm.  I had to use white vinegar in place of the rice vinegar and it still came out good.  Next time I'll make sure to have the rice vinegar.  Added chicken and stir fry veggies for a complete meal!

Wonderful recipe! I too made some modifications. I used an 8 oz package of wide lo mein noodles and cut the sauce in half. Omitting the safflower oil and instead sauteed 3 medium carrots (julienned) in 1 tbsp canola oil in a large wok before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients. I also sauteed the noodles in the sauce after they had cooked and used a small amount of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Even my VERY picky boyfriend liked this recipe and I will definitely make again!

Wonderful, I cooked this with cabage, ground beef, onions, and made home-made pot stickers, it was delish and tasted like take out. Next time I think it would be good with even more sesame seeds but I only had about a tsp left, they taste great in there!

Fantastic base recipe! Really flavorful, sweet and spicy. I just made it for dinner with a few revisions...  Substitute agave syrup for sugar (it's a fantastic sweetner!) and added 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter.   For veggies, I added bok choy, red cabbage, shredded carrots, red onion, red pepper and bean sprouts.

I made this last night and we all loved it- it was a big hit with the kids, too. The only thing I would change is to reduce the amount of oil. I thought it was a tad too oily and half the oil would have sufficed. Thank you for the recipe, I'll definitely be making it again!

I have tried many sesame noodle recipes and this one is by far the best!  I did may a couple of changes.  I used fresh chinese noodles instead of linguine, less than 1/2 the (canola) oil, and for the chile sauce I didn't know if it was supposed to be the hot or sweet version so I added a tablespoon of each.  I also added fresh ginger to the sauce and sprinkled with cilantro at the end.  I loved this and will definitely make again with different additions such as cooked chicken or shrimp, different veggies or tofu...can't wait to try them all.  Even my 3 yr old loved it!

Very good.  Quick and easy.  Cut the recipe in 1/2, and added a couple of T of peanut butter to the sauce. Actually, I just realized I forgot the chili sauce and the sesame seeds.  Added a little hot sauce, and am calling it done.
NOTE:  I made the pasta in my Instant Pot this time.  Turned out great.  Check out this link for instructions about cooking pasta in an Instant Pot:  www.tidbits-marci.com and/or www.tidbits-cami.com.

These noodles were delicious! I used Thai Rice Noodles - which I highly recommend, used half the sugar, peanut oil instead of safflower since it's all I had, and thought the peanut was a nice flavor addition. Also added cubed chicken, red pepper strips, and mushrooms sauteed in a little sesame oil. Absolutely fabulous! I only used one tsp. of sriracha sauce because my boyfriend doesn't like spicy food, but I'll use two next time, it wasn't spicy at all. This will definitely become a favorite at our house - so many ways to make it your own!

Quick, so easy, and delicious!! I used splenda and whole wheat linguini. Didn't have the green onion or safflower oil..no biggie. Sprinkled it with dried parsley flakes for color and I added some crushed peanuts for garnish. Used vegetable oil in place of safflower. If I had safflower I would've deifnitely used it to make it healthier.

This was supurb! Made exactly as written. It makes a LOT, so will probably use half the recipe next time. Served with the Grilled Peanut Chicken and Asian Coleslaw from this website. All 3 were prepared and ready to serve within an hour or so. That's a winner in my book if I can make it as a weeknight meal resulting in very desirable leftovers.

These noodles are pretty spicy!  I set red pepper flakes on the table in case anyone wanted more heat but no one touched them.  Used 3 TBSP vegetable oil.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Served with fried spinach and stuffed mushrooms.

Amazingly delicious!! I can see why the author named it so, the toasted sesame is the soul of this dish!  Only that it's a little bit greasy, I'd reduce the safflower oil to half the amount.

This is a great basic recipe but it needed a couple of tweaks to get it how we like. I ended up doubling the chili sauce plus I added some red pepper flakes as well. I took another reviewer's advice, and let the noodles simmer in the pan along with the sauce for a few minutes - this really intensified the flavor. I agree this would be a great dish served cold with some crisp veggies mixed in. Thanks!

This is delicious!!  My husband said we will never order chinese takeout again!!  I  didn't have the safflower oil so I used vegetable oil and it tasted great.  I also browned some chicken, cubed it up and added it into the sauce and then added the pasta.  Very easy and so good!!

This recipe was fantastic! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I did differently was that I refrigerated the noodles overnight to let them absorb the sauce. I also served them cold. Delicious!!!

This really needs to be served cold which I am surprised is not mentioned in the recipe.  Good but I feel like it needs vegetables in it.  I will try with sugar snap peas or such next time.

My picky husband really liked these noodles. They were easy to make, (I substituted vegetable oil - what I had onhand - for the safflower oil) and everyone really enjoyed the dish. I will make these again for sure!

Delicious with or without veggies.  I'm not a big fan of whole grain pasta, but I even like it with this recipe.  My favorite meat to serve with these noodles is Basil Pork Chops from AR.

I really liked the flavor of this. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was way too oily. next time I think I will cut the saffron oil to about half. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a good recipe.  I did make a few minor changes though for my family's person tastes...I used vegetable oil instead of safflower, because I didn't have safflower on hand, but cut it back to 4 T. I cut the rice vinegar back to 4 T. as well.  I did use the 2 T.sesamee oil but added 1 T. of Thai Chili baste instead of the chili oil.  I did add 2 more T. of toasted seeds and but it over Chineese noodles.  I had just a little left over the next day so I added a little chicken to it and microwaved it for lunch!  It was good even re-heated!

Great recipe.  I use 6 tbsp toasted sesame oil and no safflower oil.  Makes a bit too much sauce for 16oz linguini, so sometimes I double the sauce and triple the linguini if I'm making for a crowd.

I don't know, I'm not a picky eater but these just seemed like plain and oily noodles with little taste. I really think there's just too much oil in this. I would say to reduce it, but it isn't worth trying again in my opinion, just wasn't my taste. Will probably look for something more flavorful.

This recipe was really good, however I did do some minor changes.  I decreased the oil by half because 6 tablespoons seemed like a lot.  I also tripled the sesame seeds to suit my own personal preference.

The first time I made this, it was a little less than 4 stars.  I added chicken, which needed more flavor,  and did not add any cilantro.  The second time, I just made the noodles and added fresh Cilantro.  Also a dash (1/2 tsp) of Chili Oil.  Next, the recipe calls for 6 TBS oil -- which makes it a bit greasy, so I reduced and used about 3 1/2 TBS.  This made it great.  Great with Broccoli Beef I here at the website...

Really good.  I was determined to try this recipe as it was written, but I ended up making a few (minor) changes.  I used angel hair pasta as it holds sauce better.  I added corn starch to thicken up the sauce (about 4 tablespoons) and I added edamame in with the onions.  I also only added on tablespoon of chili sauce as I'm not a fan of very hot stuff.  It was a tad oily, but so is the vegetable lo mein I get at the Chinese place.  Next time I make it I will add shredded carrots and maybe peas in with the onions.  Thank you for a great recipe.

this dish makes a great alternative to just plain white rice.  the first time i made it, i felt it didn't quite have enough sauce but i've since perfected it. it's one of those dishes that my husband will actually ask for again! thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe to the letter (with the exception of using multigrain spaghetti noodles), and thought it was fantastic!  I served it with Ina's asian grilled salmon, and a side of steamed edamame - yum!  My 3 picky children devoured these noodles, and my husband and I agreed they were the best part of the meal.  Such a great base for many, many meals to come - next time I plan to add some veggies as suggested by another reviewer, and will try with shrimp skewers.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I just made this. It's great, but I did modify the recipe. I reduced the amount of oil and sugar like others suggested to 4 Tbs. I love ginger, so I also added lots of minced fresh ginger to the dressing. I used angel hair pasta instead of linguine. I added chopped red onion and unsalted roasted peanuts to give it that crunch. I debated to substitude one Tbs of oil for chili oil, but I decided to be safe for the first time. Maybe next time. I also wish I had cilantro. I think next time I'd add that too.

This was delicious. I didn't toast the sesame seed but they were flavorful enough we didn't need to. This can be a great base. We used more as a side or a bed for some beef I tried to marinate with one of the marinades from the site. I thought the beef could use more flavor. Thinking of trying with other proteins and cooking them in this sauce. EXTREMELY easy.

This recipe was extremely simple and didn't have any idea what to serve this with but it sure could have used a salad to help lighten the flavors!!

I think this recipe was great. It had great flavor but i took the advice of others and lowerd the sugar, oil, and vinegar by a little. It was fast and easy.  I will definatly make this often. try it, you'll like it!

This recipe was ok, 3 stars because I am not a fan of sesame oil (and I reduced the amount of oil to 1 tablespoon). Maybe next time I will use a little less of it or not at all. I also used a tablespoon & a half of the garlic chili paste as I like things spicy. Might give it another try but will try & tweak it a bit.

this recipe is okay, but it lacks the flavor I was looking for. maybe some anise seeds or some honey-garlic sauce to sweeten it a bit. I also reduced the oil to 4 spoons.
