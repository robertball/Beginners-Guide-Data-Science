This is a wonderful recipe.  Even my daughter, who is very picky about food, enjoyed this. For an added taste I added quacamole to it and left out the dill.  This is one recipe that we will use again.  It is very simple to do, espceially if you don't have much time to cook.

Yummy! I omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have them, but these were really good.
