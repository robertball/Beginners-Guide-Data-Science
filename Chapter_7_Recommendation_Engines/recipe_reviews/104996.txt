This is a wonderful combination of flavors. I add chopped pecans and then wrapped one loaf in rum soaked cheese cloth and mailed it across country. They enjoyed it as much as I did.

I made mini loaves for office exchange gifts. They were a hit. I didn't have dried cherries on hand, so I used craisins, dried cranberries.

This was a great and easy recipe.  I loved it.  I've frozen the 2nd loaf to take to a Christmas brunch.  I know it will be a hit.  Very very moist and delicious.

I don't know what I did to this bread but it didn't work out for me this time.  I am not ruling it out and will give it a try again.  The flavors are good but it was coarse in texture.  I halfed the recipe and maybe that had something to do with it and maybe my loaf pan was too large.  Sorry

This is good recipe, I like the idea and it works well together. I will make it again. 

I find myself wanting a bit of a stronger flavour. I went with Rum flavouring, maybe using actual rum makes a difference?!

This only made two loaves, not three.  I subbed the 1/2c milk for 1/2c pineapple juice from the can for a more tropical flavor.  (I also do that trick with pineapple upside down cake.)  No cherries so I subbed raisins & let them soak in the half cup pineapple juice about half an hour.  'Didn't measure the pineapple.  Whatever was left after draining went in.  :)  Eventhough I'm "nutmeg-sensitive," I added the full t.  I couldn't tell it was there.  In the batter, in love with rum extract; wish the flavor was stronger in the bread.  'Think adding pineapple extract might help this.  It wasn't all that moist or pineapple-tasting; mostly coconut-feeling. :/  Bummer.  Three days later, only three slices gone.  No one likes it.  Sorry.

Moist and tasty. Unusual combo for a bread but very good.
