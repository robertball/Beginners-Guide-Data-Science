IF you have to drain and rinse the sauerkraut why not just use some chopped cabbage? once sauerkraut is rinsed it loses most of its original flavor and I might add most of its health benefits  also. You can drain 1/2 the liquid ad then add a little chicken broth  or water to temper the sourness if you wish  but never rinse

I followed the recipe exactly and I'm happy I did.  I'm not normally a fan of Caraway seeds, but they weren't overpowering in this dish.   My better half is using just so-so about sauerkraut (I love it) but with the apple and brown sugar, it had a bit of a sweetness to it that she enjoyed and I thought was good too.   The roast came out juicy and tender.   This was the very first time ever that my  lady didn't go for steak sauce with a pork roast, which is a huge success for both my  kitchen and for this recipe.   Thank you for a great one.

This dish has always been a favorite in my family. I cooked the roast pork with seasonings of salt, pepper and garlic salt, slow roasted for two hours with water in the bottom for the roasting pan. My saur kraut is made with four strips of bacon cut into small pieces, 1 onion cut into small pieces also, brown sugar to taste, cooked for at least one hour until the sauce in the pan thickens the juices of the saur kraut. The gravy is made from the pan juices  from the pork and served over Chateau bread dumplings found in the frozen food section of your store. Delish and a wonderful fall meal for those colder days.

Very good recipe. Used pork loin roast and cooked it for 8 hrs and the roast shredded nicely and my mennonite farmers sausage was so tender. I cooked the sausage from the beginning with the roast.

It was good. I added potatoes instead of making mashed potatoes.

The pork was tender and delicious, but if you like the flavor of sauerkraut this recipe takes it out.

Everything was delicious except the pork which was super dry.

OOPS!!!!!!!! Now that I'm reviewing the recipe I see that no chicken broth was used. Will try it again in a month or so.

I'm not fond of caraway seeds so I left those out. I put more brown sugar in mine and tripled the recipe for sauerkraut and used a 3 pound pork butt roast.
I also didn't want to waste my smoked bratwurst links so I used these instead of Kielbasi.

To be fair, I didn't use the bacon drippings because I didn't have any nor the keilbasa since I didn't want it in the meal but I wouldn't make again.  Not the flavor I was looking for.

My family has a similar New Year's tradition, except without the kielbasa.  The only other change I made to this was to drain but not rinse the sauerkraut - I like mine tart!  This was delicious, and so easy to do in the slow cooker.  Next time I'll add the kielbasa.
