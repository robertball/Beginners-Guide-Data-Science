I thought this dressing was great for a tropical themed dinner. I added macadamia nuts, and chopped pineapple to regular cole slaw mix (cabbage and carrot). The next day I added left over coconut shrimp and it was wonderful! I only added about an 1/8 of a teaspoon of red pepper and that was plenty of kick.

Excellent!  Perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  Next time I might cut the black pepper down to 1/2 teaspoon, but why mess with a good thing?!.  My kids would not touch it, so only my husband and I ate the slaw.  The dressing becomes watery when you let the slaw sit. Since just the two of us ate it we had left over.  Next time I will split the slaw mixture and add the dressing when we are ready to eat it the next day.  Very good recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

Not a hit in our house unfortunately. I'm glad others liked it, but the flavors just didn't work for us at all. Thanks anyway.

This a great slaw and not has heavey as the usuals.  Definitely toss just before serving though, as the slaw will get too soggy sitting too long.

We liked this slaw after the first couple of bites; by the end, we loved it. The unique flavor really grows on you: With the first few bites, you taste the sweetness and the vinegar; then, you get the vanilla, which, to me, tasted a little like key lime pie; finally, you taste the spices, which give the perfect amount of heat--just enough to let you know it's there, but not so much it burns your gums. I didn't have broccoli slaw, so I used red and green cabbage along with the napa. Plus, I used fresh ginger, and instead of sugar, I used 1/4 cup agave nectar (a natural sweetener), which is the equivalent of about 1/3 cup sugar. Even with less sweetener, this was pretty sweet, so I'd suggest starting with less and adding more to suit your tastes.

This was not a universal hit. Will try again with some additional ingredients. Felt a bit bland as is.
