This is so good that the whole dinner was gone that night. No left overs. I added some garlic powder, and seasoned salt to the mixture. It gave it some extra flavor. Also I used mozzerella cheese instead of the swiss and cheddar. The children loved it. It's a repeat in this family.

I used the beef option with red bell peppers and they were devoured by my family.  We loved it.

These peppers are wonderful, great flavor.  I substituted ground turkey and brown rice to up the healthy factor and I will definitely make them again!

This was good, though I found the prep time to be rather longer than listed.  I recommend covering the top of each with cheese, giving it a more gratin-type feel.

This was an nice change from just ground beef nice flavour.  I made extra filling and froze the leftovers and served them another night with potatoes and a veggie.

My husband and I thought this was just OK.  The mixture was good but it was missing the wow factor.  I will make it again but I think I will play around with some spices or replace the water with wine.

Very good & easy to make. I will definitely make again. I didn't pre-cook the peppers because I like them to still have some crunch. Also, I added diced carrots & celery with the onions & beef, and added extra tomatoes as well.

These peppers are great!  I made them with ground beef and my family loved them.  For a more Southwestern twist, I've also tried them  mixing in a can of Ro-Tel and adding whole kernel sweet corn.

Absolutely phenomenal! I used red bell peppers, and  I made a few changes...I used Sargento Brand Bistro Blends Cheddar & Monterey Jack cheese with Tomato and Jalapeno pepper, and I substituted Minute Rice brown rice. I also added a tablespoon of Bragg's Liquid Aminos to the beef mixture.

It tastes ever better the second day! YUM!
