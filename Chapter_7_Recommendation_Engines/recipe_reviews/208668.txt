The first time I served this without a sauce and none of us enjoyed it.  A 3 star recipe at most.  For the leftovers I made a bittersweet chocolate sauce and poured it over the top.  Outstanding, an absolutely delicious finish to a meal.  This dessert has a very pretty color and nice creamy texture from the avocado.  I used lime juice and that was the prominent flavor note in this barely sweet dish.  With the addition of the bittersweet chocolate sauce it is worthy of 5 stars. This was very easy to make using an immersion blender. I'm glad I gave this lower fat panna cotta a second try. I will be making it again.  Rating this at 4 stars as I think it needs the sauce to make it outstanding.

By itself, the this panna cotta was a 4 star recipe: good but not great. It's very delicate but good. With the other reviewers suggestion of adding a some dark chocolate and fruit (I added strawberries), this becomes a 5 star recipe. The chocolate and fruit make a nice contrast to the mild creaminess of the panna cotta.

Ok, but I wouldn't make this again. I used splenda, and it was ok, but nothing to rave about.

This creamy dessert tastes "rich"!  Instead of using sugar, I used 2 T honey and instead of milk, I used soy milk.  The mild flavor is a great way to end a meal!
