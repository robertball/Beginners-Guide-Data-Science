The recipe is a family favorite to make each year for Christmas because the cookies aren't too doughy, but are easy to handle for big and little fingers to decorate.  I find that it's easier to handle the longer I refrigerate it.

These turned out a bit dry for me. I like mine very moist and chewy. The dough seemed very sticky to roll out, I had to use lots of flour.

This is just what I was looking for, a tender butter cookie with mild sweetness.  This recipe will work out fine if you plan to frost them as it is not overly sweet.   I used vanilla paste and chilled the dough thoroughly before rolling it out.  The only problem I found is I can't stop eating them.
