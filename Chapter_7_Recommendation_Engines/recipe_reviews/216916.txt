This was really good!  My husband said "make sure to save this recipe!" which is a great compliment.  I did use homemade refried beans, that were seasoned very well, and I used homemade whole wheat pita bread, and it was great.  I wasn't sure before making this if it was a mexican or greek inspired dish, and I'm still not sure, but it tasted great!  I served it with fresh fruit for a fresh lunch

This was so easy and a great quick meal! I used black beans mixed in the refried beans and also added cheese and salsa to the mix for a bit more flavor. Great for a weeknight meal. I will be making this again soon.

I really enjoyed this.  It took me about 20 minutes to throw together after volleyball practice.  It also made more than 1 pita worth.  I'll be using the leftovers for lunch tomorrow :)

Thanks for sharing!

Delicious,fresh and EASY! Served this meal w/ Mexican rice and margaritas. I substituted the beans w/ diced chicken breast (used Plump Chef "Sunshine Shake" seasoning). The cilantro and fresh salsa added an excellent flavor. My dinner guests loved it!

very nice recipe, and super easy to make.  I prefer pepper jack or, if I can get it, queso fresco, in these types of recipes rather than feta. The hot sauce was not great in this, better to use a spicier salsa.  Next time maybe I'll use black beans for even more protein. Overall a really good, filling dish.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty.  I used tortillas, since I didn't have any pita bread, and used mexican fresco cheese instead of feta.  The only thing I could see making this better would be sauteed onions and peppers.

So good! I used jalepeno refried beans because I love them and I put a little of the salsa in the bean and avocado mixture while it was cooking. It totally fills you up and the avocado tastes so great and the feta cheese is the perfect compliment to the other flavors!

8-23-11:  Really good even though I made it with black instead of refried beans by mistake.
