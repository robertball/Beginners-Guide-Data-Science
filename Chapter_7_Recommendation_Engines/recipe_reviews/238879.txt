Very good recipe with solid elements...
I omitted the coconut oil, instead cooked the garlic, onions and red peppers in olive oil and then sautéed the red quinoa, cooking in accordance to the instructions. Once the Quinoa was ready,  on a separate pan, I added the Kale, added salt, pepper and mixed until just wilted, then incorporated the Quinoa and veggie mix for about 2 min at very low heat. Once all flavors were mixed, I added lemon juice and feta cheese...Yum!

Made this as a side and my husband raved about it.  He even ate seconds!  I think I will use a little less red pepper the next time although the flavors really meld well.  The lemon juice and zest are a fabulous add.  Goes well with ham.  Looking forward to trying it cold tomorrow!

We loved this recipe - even my husband who says he doesn’t like kale took two helpings. The only change I made was using two red peppers instead of three (they were pretty big).

I really enjoyed this! I can only rate it a 4 for now because I used Asiago cheese (the only saltier cheese we had on hand), I omitted the bell peppers, and I did feel that there was too much coconut oil. I would probably have halved the coconut oil. However, this was a combination of ingredients that I wouldn't have thought of, and my husband and I thought it was very yummy. Other than the notes above, I followed the recipe exactly.
