Truly a wonderful gourmet pizza. Every ingredient worked beautifully together and the fennel seeds give a special touch. I added a tiny bit of red chili flakes before eating which was a nice addition. Great way to get your kids to eat their brussel sprouts. :) My bake-time was a little longer than 10 minutes for my oven. I will cut down on the amount of oil  I use next time.

This was surprisingly delicious!  I actually stumbled upon this recipe looking for a pancetta/sprouts recipe for a side dish.  I made the sprouts part of this recipe, leaving out the cheese but adding the fennel seed, to have as a side dish one night, then the next night I mixed the leftovers with the cheese and topped a pizza with it.  Both were fabulous!  I love the addition of fennel seed in this.  This turned out to be one of my all-time favorite pizza toppings!  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty! I used veggie bacon and added a little diced onion and sun-dried tomato, then topped everything with goat cheese before baking.

So delicious! I add mushrooms, spinach, fresh rosemary and a bit of parmesan to give it some extra pizzazz.
