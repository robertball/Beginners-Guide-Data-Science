I submitted this recipe and tried to email to let them know it is supposed to be 2 T of mustard, not 2 jars.  You can also use any other pepper you'd like (red, orange, yellow or green) - I prefer red!

This is wonderful... I added a bay leaf and the longer it marinates the better it is (its hard not to eat right away though:)

Excellent!! I was out of ketchup so I used Heinz Chili Sauce which worked great. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I don't know about these I kind of agree with the comment about thousand island dressing. It kind of just tastes like store bought dressing poured over shrimp. The sauce is really overwhelming especially the ketchup. Kind of tastes like something you would find in one of those free Kraft recipe magazines. It's not bad but not worth the effort.

I have a very similar recipe but decided to try this one. It was very good but I think if I made it again I would leave out the mustard.
