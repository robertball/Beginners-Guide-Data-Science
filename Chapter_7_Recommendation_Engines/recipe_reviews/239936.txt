I love that this recipe uses ingredients that I usually have on-hand. It's quick, easy, and delicious. In the time it takes to boil the water and cook the pasta, you can have the sauce done! That means dinner on the table in less than half an hour, which is great for busy weeknights. Just be careful with the salt, as canned clams can be pretty salty on their own!

I made this recipe tonight, but used squid ink pasta in place of the linguine. My husband and I enjoy a little extra spice so I upped the garlic by 2 cloves and added an extra little pinch of red pepper flakes. Will definitely be making this again!
