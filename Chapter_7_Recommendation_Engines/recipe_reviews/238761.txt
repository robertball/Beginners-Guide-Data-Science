HEAVENLY!  I made these for a party and all the guests were impressed. These are a little time-consuming, but totally worth it. My cookies ended up rising way more than in the pic, so the final product was more rounded that flat, but still tasty. I do have to point out that the recipe makes WAY too much frosting. You could easily get away with cutting the frosting recipe in half. It also is really thick and hard to beat, so you'll likely need to add in additional milk. The icing is also very sweet, so you don't want to overdo it.   Using parchment paper really simplified the baking process. I followed the recipe exactly (well, except I used freshly grated nutmeg in a slightly reduced amount because of its potency) and I made sure I rolled each ball the same size (they were 30g each raw, and yes I'm crazy!). This ended up making 36 cookies, so 18 sandwiches.

The Recipe itself was great, I'm giving it 3 stars because of the buttercream: You CANNOT use a dairy milk in buttercream unless you advise people that the buttercream must then be refrigerated (so yes meaning your cookies must then be refrigerated). You can sub the milk for a non-dairy or swap the milk for water and it will be fine but your asking for bacteria unless all of the cookies are being consumed immediately.

Delicious cookies and the ease of using the Reynolds Parchment paper made it so very easy.  Didn't even have to wash the cookies sheets after.. just slid the paper off and it was clean!  I didn't make sandwiches but just frosted each cookie on top.  I did cut the cookie recipe in 1/2 and the frost recipe in 1/4 and there was still too much frosting for the 20 cookies.  Can't imagine how much frosting they think you need for sandwich cookies.  I'm glad I tried these!  #AllstarsReynolds

Loved these cookies!   I wasn't a fan of the cream filling.   But, my husband was.   We all loved these cookies!   They went fast in this house.  :).  Made them exactly as the recipe called for.   And , the Reynolds parchment paper made a huge difference.  For the better.

Worth the time it took to make. Great flavor! I'd like to make again using cream cheese as an ingredient in the filling instead next time. YUM

Cookies were really good but I wasn't crazy about the filling.  I'm gonna make them again and make a cream cheese filling,  I think we will like it better.  Definitely the Reynolds parchment paper made this the easiest batch of cookies ever!  I love it.

I love the Snickerdoodles but to be honest, the frosting was just a little too much. My whoopee pie loving daughter had trouble eating the whole thing. The Parchment Paper Cookie Sheets did make them a lot easier to make however.

These are wonderful! Nice flavor. Family enjoyed them. I only made 1/4 of the buttercream frosting because it makes a lot and it is sweet. I will definitely make them again.

Possibly THE BEST Snickerdoodle recipe I have ever made! These cookies are soft and tender. I grated fresh nutmeg so I believe that adds some to the amazing flavor...this will be a staple recipe in my kitchen.

These are easily the best snickerdoodles we've ever made! They are moist and chewy, and the nutmeg gives them another dimension (I think if you don't like nutmeg, you could leave it out and just use cinnamon and sugar for the coating and they would still be good). They were time consuming, but my kids had fun making them for Christmas. 

I do agree with the other reviewers about the icing part of the recipe being out of proportion. I halved it even though we doubled the cookie recipe. We still had way too much icing. 

In sum, this one is a keeper!

I loved the snicker doodles in general, but the texture of the frosting made into a sandwich was absolutely   delicious! I would highly recommend this recipe if you are trying to show off your cooking skills

This was really good recipe and my family and I really enjoyed it.  Instead of vanilla extract  I used used maple syrup,and it actually worked.  The only problem I had with this recipe was the icing was really sweet, and there was a-lot of it.  Luckily my family loves sweet but I don't recommend this for people who enjoy blander food.

The cookies themselves were really good, especially with the addition of toasted pecans and nutmeg.  However, even my kids agreed that the frosting was too sweet.  Also, I could barely taste the cinnamon.  I halved the frosting and used water instead of milk as per other reviewers' comments.
