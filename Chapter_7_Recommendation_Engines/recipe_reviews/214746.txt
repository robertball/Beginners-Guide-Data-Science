This was an amazing jam recipe. I couldn't believe it when I was canning it. This recipe was a food blog competition. Sort of like an Iron Chef from amother foodie website. The idea was to create a recipe with 2 star ingredients, then blog about it. Then others would vote on "would they make it" Well this was the result of a 2nd attempt. I was going for a spin on a citrus glaze for baked/grilled fish. The 2 ingredients were apricots and shallots. When I put it all together it had an amazing zing of flavors. And one that I couldn't believe was in comparasion to Sweet & Sour glaze from many of a fine chinese resturant I have ever eaten at....shocked and thrilled I couldn't wait to share with others. I have made nnumberous batches for friends and families in a small time frame since coming up with this recipe. Hope everyone else enjoys as much as we have. Note: 2 half pint jars can utilize 1 bag of frozen meatballs as well as 1 bag of popcorn chicken in the freezer section.

We love this recipe for an easy meal. We followed the recipe (x4). At the end of the afternoon,our home smells wounderful.  The 2 alteration: a)adding worcestershire sauce to taste for depth, before the pection/sugar.  b)Even though we (x4) the batch we only used a 1tbsp of minced jalepeno peppers. It turns out to be mild enough for our younger family members. In the end  we ended up with 3-1Liters & 9-500mls canning jars. Hint* to ratio: 1/2 pint = 1cup =250mls

Excellent recipe. We use it on chicken drumettes off the grill. Need to make more next time. Does anyone know if I can double the recipe and still get this to firm up?

Made exactly to recipe, (except no cilantro).  And made 1 1/2 batches w/ only 1 package pectin so it is more of a sauce and less of a jam.   Used it last night as a glaze for cut-up, pork chops; also served some on the side for cooked carrots/squash and for the rice.  Delicious.

I love this stuff!  I canned the jam a few weeks ago and finally used it this weekend.  My husband said it could use a little more heat, but I thought it was perfect!

I have "tons" of ripe Apriums and thought I would give this recipe a try.  We think it's fabulous, but could use a little more "heat" for our taste. Also, next batch I'll thinly slice the shallots and then quarter the slices.  I didn't like the way they appeared "stringy" when ladling the jam into the jars.  After filling all the jars I couldn't wait to lick the spoon, LOL. I can't wait to try this on either the chicken or meatballs.  Thanks for such a creative recipe!

This is soooo incredibly good! I didn't make it myself -- my best friend canned this (using peaches) and sent me a few jars. I served them with baked chicken nuggets. I did find I had to cut the jam with rice wine vinegar to get it a bit thinner and a touch less sweet, but I'm sure that just depends on what you're using it for. This is absolutely fantastic, the only thing that could possibly improve it would be some heat :) Thanks for the recipe, mis7up!

Will make this recipe over and over.  My kids loved it, and we even shared some jars with neighbours who now think I am the MASTER of canning! :-)  I did do one recipe with the addition of 1 Cup sweet cherries, cut and pitted, and upped the pineapple to 1Cup.  I felt safe doing that as both additions are acidic.  Please remember when canning, that acidity levels are crucial to safety, so it is dangerous to change recipes meant for canning.  In any event, the addition was perfect.  I have cut, measured and frozen Apricots and Cherries which are seasonal items here in S. Ontario, and put them in freezer bags to keep for off season preparation of the recipe.

I made it as the recipe states but for somehow losing the cumin coming home from the store and I did increase the lime juice to 1/3 cup, the original didn't sound like enough acid to compensate for all the shallots.  

With all the sugar it made loads of liquid and of course canned with the solids floating on the top.  I was able to twirl some down into the liquid after a 1 hour set.  One jar I left alone.  All I taste is sweet, garlic and cilantro.  I taste no sour at all.  After 4 days I blended a jar and tested the pH and got a 4.6, just barely safe and I had increased the lime juice.

If I were to make this again (and I'm not)  I'd cut the sugar total down to 4 cups, increase the lime juice to 2/3 or 3/4 cup, omit the cilantro.  Odds are for a real sweet and sour will need a recipe with vinegar. 

I'll probably use these jars with vinegar for meatballs

Came across this recipe looking for a mango, pineapple, habanero jam. Replaced the apricots in the recipe with frozen mango and my family loved it. Hubby needed more heat so the second batch I made I added another habanero. Definitely has the heat he wanted. Awesome over cream cheese with crackers also.

The perfect compliment to all sorts of meats, and great on a fruit salad, Samosas, egg rolls, and cheeze n crackers.  We've even had this on Goat - yes goat.
We like more heat so I've added 2 Jalapenos, 2 Habaneros, 1/2 C chopped cilantro.
My experiment with tripling the recipie was a very loose set.  
I've made this with peaches, in a pinch canned crushed pineapple (well drained) and I omit the brown sugar.  MMMmmmmmm  the house still smells great.

I loved this recipe.  So easy to make and delicious.  Trying it with peaches also.  Did not add all of the sugar only 4 cups and still turned out great.

Very good but little too sweet for my taste. Probably cut with a little rice vinegar as a previous poster had suggested and use for sweet and sour chicken. Mine didn't set and was syrupy but okay for a chicken glaze or over cream cheese with crackers.

Just finished canning a batch of this and it's amazing. I was determined to get it made this weekend, and of course I couldn't find fresh apricots, so I substituted pluots and the store had no habanero peppers, so I used jalapeno and a couple pinches of crushed red pepper. Have some in a bowl cooling in the fridge to put on cream cheese. Thanks for this recipe!!!

Love this recipe. I used it on breaded fish and chicken. It reminds me of sweet and sour Chinese. I liked it so much that I felt good enough to give out some to my new neighbors and my best friend. They love it too.

After reading a few reviews,  I made some changes. I doubled the recipe,  upped the lime juice by double,  added about 3/4 cup vinegar,  reduced sugar to 7cups white and 2 brown. I used the light certo and added bit more hot peppers - in my case serrano's as that's what was in the garden. Finally I doubled the cilantro.  This is yummy. Can't wait to try it on chicken. Although eating it with a spoon on it's own works too.

Not bad . I added more hot peppers and less sugar . Additional pectin was added because it did not thicken right . Overall it does have that sweet and sour satisfactory .

We first made this because we had so many apricots from our tree  we were looking for a new recipe.  We gave so many jars away as gifts we ran ourselves short so this year we made twice as many.  One of our favorite ways is to put it on a pork roast  in the crock pot.

I increased the cumin to 1-1/2 tsp and the cumin to 1 cup (about half a bunch) to increase the spice and heat.

I have made this recipe several times and share these special jars with friends and family. This recipe is fabulous blended with white rice and vegetables and meat - kind off like a tropical fried rice dish. I lessen the sugar and like a bit more heat. While I stick to the spirit of the recipe, I do adjust to use the veggies out of my garden meaning I don't use habanero but Serrano or jalapeño instead, or red onion instead of shallots. Every time I make it (which is like a dozen times) it's different but still very yummy!!!!  Thank you so much for this golden recipe!!!

This is outstanding.  I used gelitin instead of pectin.  Was able to cut sugar in half.It is still sweet but the sour/spicy come out very well.
