Make this another FIVE STAR review! I had to make a few subs because we don't like olives, so subbed mushrooms, chopped and cooked before adding to the stuffing spread. I used mostly feta, but also some Asiago and about 2 oz of Port du Salut cheese that needed to be used up immediately. Also used lemon juice in place of the balsamic vinegar, as lemon is almost synonymous with Greek cuisine. Used dry white wine and a splash of chicken stock, as well. The flavors meld and marry in the oven and the result is an explosion of taste. I spooned the cooking juices over the chicken and served with Greek pilaf on the side. The only change I would make the next time is to drop the temperature to 325 degrees - not that the chicken meat was dry, but I believe that this small change will result in a more moist texture still.  Thank you for an outstanding recipe that one can serve with pride. Get ready for all the praise when you make this one!

Thise was wonderful.  Made me look like I really know what I'm doing in the kitchen.  I had both feta and blue cheese, so I decided to use half of each.  The blue cheese was very strong and overpowered the taste of the chicken.  That is not necessarily a bad thing, but my husband is not a big blue cheese fan.  So next time I will make it with feta only since it's a little milder.  But the cheese lover that I am adored it. I cooked mine at 375 since my oven usually requires higher temperatures than directions call for, and it came out perfectly.  The sauce this made was absolutely delicious.  I steamed some extra fine frozen green beans, and tossed them in the sauce.  I served the chicken over the beans instead of rice or pasta.  These were literally the best green beans we had ever tasted.  Even my 2 year old son ate them (that was a first).  I am sure this sauce would go great with any vegetable, and is good for low carb diets if you do that instead of serving it with a starch.  SOOOOOOOO good.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely delicious - simple to make and the flavors were so good, we found ourselves craving it again the next day.  Definately a do-over!

exquisite!  I used chicken thighs instead, it's what I had.  I cooked it at 375, it wasn't cooking fast enough at 350..so that altered my bake time..I also basted about every 10 minutes...the juice it made in the pan was AWESOME! Serve over a noodle or rice!!

Excellent.  Made this tonight.  Followed the recipe with only a couple of slight modifications:

-in the feta mixture (in the food processor), I threw in 1 large clove of garlic).
- before covering the chicken, I sprinkled a little salt and pepper on top

We enjoyed the recipe immensely.  Company-worthy, but not that hard to make.

i wasn't pleased with the presentation when removing this from the oven so i placed it under the broiler for 5 minutes to brown slightly and that helped with the appearance. The filling is great and over all, it is quite flavorful. Will probably make again.

A 5 star recipe! The kids cleaned their plates, hubby was full of compliments and everyone enjoyed this tasty version of chicken. I only wish I knew an easy way to pound down chicken without making a complete mess of things, though. When I sliced through the chicken, however, I had beautiful pinwheels! I served with steamed green beans and rice. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for submitting.

Halved the recipe but left the sauce quantities the same. Used Kalamata olives (husband and I are both big fans) and feta cheese. Don't worry too much over the toothpicks---the feta doesn't melt like cheddar or mozzarella would and the filling stayed mostly within my not-too-well pounded and very erratically shaped chicken breasts. Absolutely delicious. A+.  Will try next time with blue cheese.

WOW! This chicken came out really well. I took the advice of some other reviews and cooked the chicken in a covered Pyrex pan at 350, basting every so often for about 20 minutes, then uncovered for the last 10 minutes. It was so moist and flavorful! The only thing I changed about the stuffing was subbing sauteed mushrooms for olives, some mushrooms blended and some just chopped & stirred in. I also added some marinated artichoke hearts chopped up after blending the stuffing, and a bit of chopped italian parsley. I served it with the "stuffed peppers my way" recipe from this site, and a simple salad, and it was a great combo! THANK YOU!

I'm sorry....I'm not trying to be mean, but truthful, as I'm a pretty good cook.... however, am always looking for new recipes.  I had higher expectations of this.  Thought it was absolutely medicore.  Nothing spectacular....will probably feed the leftovers to the dogs, as me and my boyfriend have no interest in eating it again.  Not sure how it won a recipe contest.....either the feta and/or the olives were over powering.

Sorry....this one was just not to our liking.  Even though I put less olives than called for, the olive flavor was overpowering.  It smelled great cooking, and the sauce was yummy, but no one really liked it.

This was good, but I think the pounded chicken breasts need to be marinated overnight before filling.  The feta mixture inside the rolls was very good, but the meat itself seemed a bit dry/bland.  I will probably make this again.

I followed the recipe to a T. I felt the chicken was quite dry and honestly the dish just did not wow me at all. The positive is that it was very quick and easy to make. Thank you for the recipe though!!

This was phenomenal! I used garlic and herb feta so omitted the oregano. Also added the sun-dried tomatoes to the stuffing mix. Because feta is salty I didn't add any other salt, but found that the meat does still need some light salt and pepper on the outside. So good. But, doesn't look very appetizing coming out of the oven, the meat doesn't brown. The second time I made these it was for company so I made some pretty grill marks on the tops with my cast iron grill pan before baking. Could also sear them in the pan. I also learned it is critical to get the chicken really thin, and it is easier to roll along the long side instead of the short side.

EASY PEEZY! You'll look like a gormet chef if you make this for company. It is so unique and delish. Your guests will no doubt beg you for the recipe. Use feta though it comes out better. MMMMM good!!! :)

This is SO good.  I used chicken thighs, which were very easy to flatten, and blue cheese with kalamata olives.  Also the chicken broth rather than the wine.  Rave reviews all around.  Highly recommend and like one other reviewer commented - it made me look like I knew what I was doing!

Made exact recipe, and it was full of flavor. The chicken breasts I bought were enormous so I wasn't able to pound them as thin as I would have liked, but that didn't effect the flavor at all. Will probably make again.

This was not bad, but it wasn't that good either. Just kinda bland. Made it exactly as recipe states. The sauce is good with green beans though, as another reviewer mentioned.

This recipe is so yummy.  I didn't change a single thing on this recipe and it came out perfect.  Hubby loves it so much.  I followed one reviewers suggestion to pair it with orzo greek salad - what a combination.  Our taste buds were dancing with joy.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Very tasty chicken recipe!  I used feta cheese instead of the blue cheese. Further, the 'stuffing' was excellent; I added bacon chunks from Costco as part of the 'stuffing' and it turned out great.  Since nothing was mentioned about coating the chicken, I added garlic seasoning on top of it prior to putting it in the oven.  I put the chicken in the oven covered at 400 degrees for 30 minutes before taking off the aluminum foil cover and cooking the chicken for an additional 15 minutes.  As this recipe is called Greek Chicken, I used white wine from Greece (Kouros) as part of the onion / garlic mixture instead of the chicken broth.  The juices from the mixture did not run clear at the end of the cooking; so, I added the onion / garlic mixture on top of the chicken before serving it.  Safe to say, I will definitely make this delicious recipe again!

I needed a quick meal so I only did step #1 of the directions to prep, I then browned each side of the rolled breasts in a frying pan on top of the stove, then put the whole pan into the oven at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.  They were great!

I'm sorry I have to agree with some above I love salty foods and consider myself a pretty good cook, but it was way to salty and the liquid ratio didn't work at all. I wouldn't make it again.

This recipe was amazing & I didn't change a thing.  My husband has already requested this one twice since I made it the first time!

This was delicious and easy. I made as is except I used all chicken broth since I had no white wine, left out the onion (didn't think it necessary here), used less olives and doubled the sause mixture. Baked for 40 mins (half covered half not) was perfect.

Off the charts good! I mixed cream cheese with blue cheese, pan fried diced portobello mushrooms with garlic and a lil salt, and swirled it in there... SUPER. I CRAVE this. Next time I'm going to try cutting a pocket into the chicken breast to see if it is easier than rolling the chicken breast.

very very good.  I found fat free feta and used to reduce the calories.  Instead of pounding the chicken, I sliced mine through the middle into 2 pieces and it didn't take any longer to cook, but maybe didn't hold the fabulous stuffing in quite as well.  GREAT Flavor and a winner with the kids!

WOW this was so delicious!  I didn't have white wine, so I subbed in some Newman's Own oil & vin, and used a kalamata olive medley and threw it in the blender to make a paste. I added one more garlic clove too.  I just put the sauce on top of the chicken as it simmered in a pan, rather than baked because I was roasting baby potatoes.  The chicken was amazing!  If you like Greek tastes, this one is a winner.

This was WONDERFUL!  I doubled the chicken broth but besides that I made as is and wouldn't change a thing.  I had to bake a little longer and at 375 because my oven always requires a longer cooking time.  Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch!

This was so good and easy to make!  I don't even like olives, but I loved this.  I accidentally got the olives with jalapenos, but it was a good mistake, I would use that again.  My two year old liked this too!

I used blue cheese and I really didn't like the blue cheese taste although I love blue cheese...disappointing.  The chicken was so moist and tender that I will make this again but I will use feta and kalamata olives for a 5 star dish.  This is a really easy recipe.  I also increased the temperature to 375.

My dad saw this dish sitting on my stove and said it looked like bland chicken. I told him it was Greek Chicken and he needed to try it, needless to say he was pleasantly surprised.  The juice/sauce was amazing and I put it over green beans and white rice. It's an easy dish and a nice change of pace.

I can see why it won you the cooking competition! Fantastic! Everyone at the table raved about how gourmet it tasted. I picked your recipe because I had some muffalata relish and expensive cheese that I needed to use up and I thought the recipe fit all my needs. Little did I know that I would be falling in love with this dish again and again. The sauce is so flavorful. I spooned it over the chicken before serving and used the remaining on green beans like someone else suggested. I could easily see this as an impressive dish to serve for guests. New family favorite!!
