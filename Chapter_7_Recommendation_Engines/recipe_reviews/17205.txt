I use a much easier recipe for hollandaisse at our restaurant.  We add the egg yolks, pepper (cayenne) and lemon juice in the blender.  Heat the butter in the microwave until bubbly, then add slowly to the yolk mix.  Very easy.  you can also use wine to stabilize your egg whites.

I wanted to share a time saving hint that I saw on a cooking show.  You can poach your eggs in advance then remove them from the boiling water and place them in a large bowl of ice water, make sure you have plenty of ice in your bowl of water.  You can let the eggs stay in the water while you prepare your other ingredients. 

When you are ready to assemble your eggs benedict simply remove the egg from the ice water and put it back into your boiling water for just a few seconds until it gets warm enough to serve.  You will be able to have a number of eggs ready on a moments notice using this method.

Just delicious. Toast your muffins just golden, not too crispy or it makes the Eggs Benedict hard to eat in my opinion. An easier way to make Hollandaise is in the blender. Place egg yolks in blender with the lemon juice (1 tablespoon is what I use) and other seasonings, turn blender on high speed for 5 seconds to blend. Melt butter in microwave until completely melted and hot. Turn blender back on high speed and gradually pour in butter. It will thicken into a beautiful yellow hollandaise in 20-40 seconds.

Excellent! And I tried all the various versions suggested by other reviewers. The blender method makes it easier and faster, but the double boiler method tastes less eggy and the heat blends all the flavors together very well. Another advantage to making the sauce on the double boiler is that you can keep it hot till you are ready to serve.

The key to using the double boiler is to make sure the water is only simmering (not boiling) and NOT touching the bottom of the sauce pan. (I used key limes instead of lemons, and added a couple of extra drops of Worcestershire sauce (to taste).)

Combine the eggs, lime/lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce in a separate bowl before pouring into the double boiler. Then KEEP WHISKING, DON'T STOP, even after the last drop of butter has been added, keep whisking till everything is smooth. 

Making this receipe is like conducting an orchestra. Prepping is key. I started with the bacon then popped it into a warm oven. I also put heat-safe  breakfast plates in the oven to warm them up. I made the sauce, then when that was done, I took it off the double boiler and set it aside. Then I popped the English muffins in a toaster oven (on light toast), then used the water in the boiler to poach the eggs. Stir up the sauce while the bread and eggs are cooking. The bread and eggs should be done simultanously. I garnished with a sprinkle of Hot Hungarian Paprika.

This recipe's hollandaise sauce was just way too lemony for our tastes. My kid's couldn't even eat it!!! Cut the lemon juice down to about 2 teaspoons and it will probably be fine.

My boyfriend considers himself an "eggs benedict connoisseur" - he always orders it when we eat out for breakfast and will send it back if it isn't to his liking (he always feels bad about it though!). I decided to try and make it for him since he likes it so much but was intimidated because I always thought it would be hard. I saw this recipe, reviewed it and decided it was something I could do - he LOVED it! And he wasn't just saying that because he loves me :) He suggested that we buy a double broiler since I had to improvise on the hollandaise sauce and he wants me to make it again! YUMMY! Thank you for such an EASY and DELICIOUS recipe!!

Perfect recipe.  Although I've made Eggs Benedict before, I'd never used a recipe for the Hollandaise sauce- I just used an old method my mom used.  This had just the perfect amount of lemon (we like it very lemony).  Poaching the eggs was a little tricky- I just broke each one into a small bowl before sliding it into the water... was a little easier that way.  Thank you!

One of my favorite yearly treats is eggs benedict which I reserve for our Sunday before Christmas brunch with our friends. This year I felt a little ripped off, being that for the first time, the eggs were overdone and the sauce was bland. So, I decided to try making this dish myself. I was a little intimidated at first, but the eggs really turned out delicious as well as the sauce. Be sure to add the vinegar to the water as it really helps hold the whites together. Thanks!

Hubby requested this for supper.  I came to this site and was not disappointed.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Unlike others, I did not find the sauce to "lemony".  This is a super recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Perfect hollandaise sauce! First time it did not turn out too runny nor too thick! I cut the english muffins in half instead of using them whole. REALLY good recipe!

Good recipe. I always use about 1 tbsp lemon juice to start and then season with more at the end if it needs it. Instead of Worcestershire, I like it better with a few drops of sriracha/hot sauce. And I make my own double boiler by using a steel mixing bowl set on top of a pan of water. The rounded bottom on the bowl is much better for whisking touchy sauces like this (no corners where the sauce can hide from your whisk).

I love eggs benedict but have never tried to make it at home before. This is an excellent recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and everything came out perfectly - everything tasted exactly as it should. I felt like I was presenting a perfect eggs benedict to Gordon Ramsay on Masterchef! Very easy and quick, a bit of prep work and organization is required, but you will have a delicious breakfast treat in no more than 30 minutes!

Good easy to follow recipe.  This sause was much too lemoney for me.  This was the first time we ever tried to prepare this dish.  It is a favorite of my wifes.  The first time I try something, I always follow the recipe and ingreadients list.  When I make this next, I plan to use much less lemon juice and over double the Worchestershire sauce.

"This is exquisite I can't remember when I've had such delic-gulp mmmmm!" says my mom. I'm fifteen and I couldn't sleep last night at all so I went down stairs around 6:00 and made a batch of cookies. I still wasn't tired so I decided to make a really hard recipe that would make me tired enough to fall asleep afterwards. I remembered eating amazing eggs benedict in NYC last summer and Iv'e heard both poaching eggs and making hollandaise sauce was difficult so I thought to myself, Why not? Anyways I made it later this morning for my mom and I. Overall it wasn't that hard I just had trouble figuring out the double boiler but afterwards it went pretty smoothly, so don't be intimidated. I am a vegetarian so I skipped The bacon and made an extra poached egg, and my mom put spinach under hers because she can't eat wheat. We both loved it! it was sooo delicious. Anyways I know it might intimadate some people, but It's not that hard, just make sure you know the recipe really well and keep the heat as low as possible because the eggs will get thick and if the heat is on too hot, and then they may start to separate. Mine did but by then my mom had gotten up so she said to take them off the heat and stir a lot. Because of this we left a little of the butter out but it didn't matter. Make this and you will not regret it, don't settle for the blender or mix type of hollandaise sauce: you are amazing and you deserve the best of the best. right? XOXOX Jade

Agreed with others that cutting back the lemon juice quite drastically is necessary for the sauce to turn out well. I also had trouble with the sauce separating when I left it to sit while I poached the eggs and toasted the English muffins. The sauce can be rescued by whisking another egg yolk into it but you have to serve immediately or it will separate again! I've since read online that putting your saucepan or double boiler bowl into cold water or putting an ice cube into the sauce can also rescue the emulsification so I might try that next time.   The key to getting this recipe right is to have everything prepped and ready ahead of time so that you can pull it all together at the last minute.

Way too much lemon juice. Cut the amount in half and it might actually taste like hollandaise sauce. I made the mistake of using this recipe for Valentine's Day breakfast and I really regret it.

Delicious and surprisingly easy.  When making a batch for guests, I toast the buttered english muffins in the oven with the canadian bacon right on top.

TONS of butter in here but, man is it good!  This fast tracked it's way to my husbands favorite breakfast list.  Because it is SO bad for us, I only make it occasionally.  I love to play with it too, adding spinach and smoked salmon or sliced tomatoes and smoked turkey - great fun!!

Really tasty, I love poached eggs & have never attempted to make benedict before.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers & cut way back on the lemon juice (used 1/2 tsp for a single serving).  Here's the trick, measure out all the ingredients for the sauce & set them aside, start the water for the double boiler to warm it up.  Cook the muffin, canadian bacon & poached eggs first.  Have them ready to serve, then start the sauce at the very end - it only takes a minute or two if you have everything ready.  Serve immediately!

This wasn't to our liking. Too much lemon. I added some sugar to counteract the lemon - it definitely helped, but I would recommend you significantly reduce the lemon in this recipe. You can always add more if needed. I would start with 1 tablespoon. You don't need to do this in a double broiler either - just do it on low and stir constantly.

Very good! Very easy!  One note of advice, however....prepare the hollandaise sauce in advance but do not cook until everything is almost done.  Well I had the water on a very low simmer the sauce started to solidify and I had to fix the consistency with extra water, which worked fine but lessened the favor a tad.  But yummy regardless!

My daughter is a new cook, she made this and the family enjoyed it. She watched a video on poaching eggs while she was making it which helped. She added Worcestershire sauce which added to the flavor.

My first attempt at Eggs Benedict was a nice success. Its one of those things where timing is a bit more strict. My eggs were just a little overcooked (half runny) due to some other distraction. Regardless, the recipe is perfect and proves that a swanky sounding egg dish can very easily be made.

This recipe was way too lemony for me and my husband.    I made it again using half the lemon juice and it was still a bit too lemony.  I would recommend using only half or less of the lemon juice this recipe calls for.

I really think that the 3 1/2 Tablespoons of lemon juice is a typo. That is way too much. But I read the reviews first and I only added 1 1/2 teaspoons to mine and it was perfect for me. Other than that this is amazing. I made it for breakfast on Saturday and the fixed it two more times that weekend! It is very easy to make. I just used a pot and a bowl for my double broiler and it worked perfect. No need to buy one.

I just made  this recipe...   It was pretty good..  I crushed a clove of garlic into juice from one lemon... and let it sit for a while....  I tried not to get most of the garlic in.  Juice from one lemon is a little too lemony.  I donno if this makes a difference but I was tought in chef school, that you should always whisk side to side, up and down... not in a circular motion. I also put the finished product under the broiler to toast the tops of of nice...  YUmmmmm

Great recipe...I made it for my mum on Mother's Day and she loved it. I would suggest using a store-bought packet of Hollandaise mix which will save you time and the worry of food poisoning + it tastes really great!

I've been searching for a great home-made Hollandaise Sauce for a long time, and this is the best I've found yet! Using a double boiler, and the tip to add a little hot water if the sauce starts to curdle worked great! For those who think the lemon juice is too powerful - I stayed in a great Bed & Breakfast where the hostess used orange juice instead of lemon juice, which makes for a much milder flavor.  Since I'm out of OJ, I decreased the lemon by half and added a dash of red hot sauce. Great Flavor! Also, for the Lactose Intolerant among us, I used Nukoa Lactose Free Margarine instead of butter, and amazingly the consistency was perfect.  I kept the water simmering in the double boiler and when everything else was almost ready I put the sauce back on to warm it, whisking for a minute.

This is the best Eggs Benedict recipe I've made
to date.  It was easy, but as with any recipe that 
calls for Hollandaise (or Bernaise) sauce, it takes
a bit of juggling to have everything come out at
the same time.  Aside from that, my husband and I
enjoyed every single bite of the delicious results.
While I won't make Eggs Benedict regularly, you
may be sure I'll make it for special occasions.

Came out great. I followed another user's recommendation to use less lemon juice; I used 1 table spoon and it was perfect. I just keep eating the hollandaise. I didn't butter the toast either. There's plenty of butter in the sauce.

Made this today for my partner and kids, and everybody loved it! I've always been a little hesitant about making hollandaise at home b'se everyone says it is so difficult! These instructions made it very simple for me. In the sauce, I used a little less butter than called for (didn't have enough at hand), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Delicious and will definitely make again. Thank you!

I make this every Sunday, with one small change.  In step 5 of the recipe, istead of putting butter on the english muffin, I place a tablespoon of the hollandaise on them.

We tried this recipe at our house and found that there was too much lemon juice.  I would recommend only using 2 tablespoons.  I also felt that there was too much butter in this recipe.  I would cut that in half as well if you're only using four egg yolks. And don't forget the cayenne! All in all, this was not our favorite eggs benedict recipe.

Very good. I'd never made eggs Benedict before, but it came out just fine. It was very helpful to make the eggs ahead of time, to be sure that everything was timed properly. Unlike what other reviewers said, I did not think that the sauce was too lemony. My SO said he'd never had it before, but he really liked it. Not one I will make often because of the prep, but I will make it again.

My son prepared this for his wife and me today.  It was absolutely the best eggs benedict I have ever eaten.   The sauce is fantastic -- wonderful flavor with just the perfect amount of lemon.   I can't wait to prepare this for a Sunday brunch.

Excellent!  Used the chef's tip and made the Hollandaise in the blender.  I have a terrible history of poaching eggs.  My wife bought me silicone cups at the kitchen store that were made for this and they work as described. Picture perfect poached eggs.

This was my first time making eggs benedict and it certainly wasn`t has hard as I expected. Next time I am going to make a few changes:

first make sure to let the sauce sit. The first time I tasted it I was quite concerned with how lemony it was, however after a couple of minutes it wasn`t nearly so overwhelming. 

second the lemon in the recipe definately needs to be cut back. I would say about 2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons is more than enough. (The exact amount would depend on personal preference. My boyfriend and I both enjoy lemon, so we would only reduce it a little.)

Other than that this recipe has cured my fear of making this recipe, and it will no longer be confined to christmas day meals.

this is great to make the day after you make something that takes a lot of egg whites. the prep on this is a pain, sure. why not just eggs and ham and biscuits? but the work is worth it. after a few times making it, i make the hollandaise the night before, and reheat in the morning (easier since im sleepy).

I also dont use english muffins, i use a recipe on here for "JP's Big Daddy biscuits". 

Fresh biscuits, fresh ham, the egg and hollandaise = best breakfast ever. its cheap, its filling, and its something your always in the mood for.

Good! I used a pinch of cayenne instead of white pepper and subbed a little bit of vinegar for the Worchestershire, but it was good both ways. Much easier than the last recipe I tried.

Because this is my favorite "eat out" breakfast, I was afraid to prepare it at home...but this Christmas morning with the help of my kids, we jumped into the unknown!  All I can say is, "FABULOUS!".

Preparing the eggs ahead of time and keeping them in ice water was a great suggestion and made what could have been a hectic preparation a simple one!

Don't resist!  Try this recipe!

I always thought hollidaise sauce was hard to make, until I found this recipe. I usually just make the sauce and my family LOVES it. And it really is simple. And the sauce is great over fish and asparagus. Thanks so much for sharing this.

As a first time holly sauce maker I thought it was fairly simple and straightforward. I found if you adjusted the amount of the butter and lemon juice you could adjust the richness of it. I really liked it! Thank you for the recipe, it's a keeper for sure:)

We loved this recipe! It was very time consuming (at least for a breakfast). I took other reviewer's suggestions and made the sauce last and not first. It was hard to time everything correctly to make sure that it all finished at around the same time, but if you plan ahead it is possible. I did as others suggested and pulled out all ingredients and measurements before I began. I did cut back on the lemon juice (to 2T) and it was just right. It was still very lemony, but we love lemon. Oh, and I added cayenne pepper to the sauce to give it a little kick. Overall, excellent recipe!

Excellent.  I used 1-1/2 stick of butter, tried the blender idea for creating the hollandaise (excellent) and only the juice of one lemon (about 1-1/2 tbsp).  I used lump crabmeat instead of the typical bacon.  So good.

I'm pretty sure you meant 3 1/2 "teaspoons" for the lemon juice... the sauce looked wonderful but didn't taste good. A little lemon goes a long way.

An excellent variation of this recipe is eggs florentine. Simply omit the bacon and put steamed and chopped spinach over the eggs before pouring on the hollandaise sauce. This recipe is quite simple, although it helps to have a second person (to pour the butter into the hollandaise). Plan to spend closer to an hour making this from start to finish. Overall, this is an excellent, very tasty, traditional benedict recipe that I would recommend highly.

I followed the recipe. The only negative is it was too lemony. With half the amount of lemon juice this would be 5 stars. It made enough hollandaise sauce for eight.

I am in LOVE with this recipe!! I add some paprika to it. Mostly just for colour. I also realized (about the 6th time I made it) to pop a funnel into the hole in the lid of my blender when adding the butter. I had egg yolk all over my kitchen trying to add the butter without it!! Mmm! Soooo good!!

Great instructions, I was afraid of poaching eggs before, but I feel I nailed it the first time. Unfortunately I think the sauce had a tad too much lemon. Next time I will adjust down to 2 Tbs. After making this I looked around and most recipes call for 1-2 Tbs. It didn't ruin the dish, but it wasn't as great as it potentially can be.

The ingredients are fine, but a long time ago I found an easier way to prepare the sauce.  Simply melt the butter and drizzle on top of other sauce ingredients while the blender is on.  Keep the lid on and only pour through the hole in the top.

I have never made eggs benedict before. This recipe was fantastic! 

I did used only 2TBS of lemon juice as some suggested and it was perfect. For a moment I thought I had ruined the sauce because it started to separate. I thought I had ruined it. But I just kept wisking hard and it smoothed right out. 

I agree with the person who said that timing is everything. I need to figure out a way to keep the ham and eggs warm while I make the sauce. I found that once I started to make the sauce, all of my attention had to be on that so everything else must be able to be left alone at that point. 

Thanks for this recipe and for the comments which improved it even more. I will definitely make this again.

omg this is SO good!  Didn't have any english muffins so used Orowheat thin sliced sandwich bread toasted.  The sauce is spot on, just be sure to watch it so it doesn't "split".  The taste is awesome!  Will definately make again.

I loved it... thought the Hollandaise was great, but hubby thought it was... well, in his words, "is it supposed to be sour" mind you he has never had hollandaise sauce before. I thought it was delicious! Thank you for the recipe... Hubby just has an unsophisticated palate...

These are great! I did completely mess up the hollandaise sauce :( It was my first time trying to make it so I ended up just doing a cheese sauce. Gasp! Will be making this again. Hopefully I'll do better with the sauce next time!

'''''   '' '' This was by far the best eggs Benedict I've eaten, and it was easy to make, too.  I actually skipped the Canadian bacon, since I was pressed for time and it was just me and the kids, and I used whole wheat English muffins.  I also reduced the butter by about 1/4 cup, mostly because I didn't realize until it was too late that this recipe was so big, and like I said, it was just me and the kids.  Oh, and i didn't have any white pepper on hand, either.  I actually substituted garlic powder.  Tasted great, though!  I decided to save the leftover sauce and poach some eggs again for tomorrow's lunch.  It would be a great thing to make ahead and take to work.  I used to have a microwaveable egg poacher I used at work that woul be perfect!

I agree with other reviewers, there is too much lemon in this recipe.  Otherwise, it is very good and has a true hollandaise sauce worth the effort.  I will make this again.

What am I missing? This recipe calls for a full cup of butter when everything else I've read requires only a half cup, that is one stick. The wife teases me for not trying out recipes verbatim at least the first time, and determined to go by the book the ideal consistency of thickness was reached after half the butter was applied and was irreparable after adding the rest. As an amateur I'm willing to accept if I made a mistake somewhere especially since I seem to be the only one who caught this. For now I will try the 5 minute recipe made easy by using a blender.

I followed the recipe exactly, only blending the sauce ingredients in a blender as one helpful reviewer stated. The texture and color of the sauce was wonderful, however, I did not care for this. Extremely sour/tangy. It tastes nothing like any hollindaise my boyfriend and I have ever had, and we've tried it nearly every breakfast place we've been. I would venture to guess if the lemon juice was reduced by a lot, it might taste wonderful. Also, the sauce is a little runny. I wonder if there is a way to thicken it up like they do in a restaurant?

I took and modified the suggestion of another review, and just used the "boat motor" hand mixer, mixed all but the butter, melted the butter and then mixed it in.  Came out very good.

The only reason I am giving four stars is because of the changes I made: bacon instead of Canadian bacon and whole-wheat toast instead of an English muffin.  Also, I blended the sauce ingredients instead of using a double-boiler.  The sauce was a great balance of lemony and savory (although next time I will add a touch more Worchestershire and a dash of Tabasco).  Delicious, and not at all good for you!  :)

This is a great recipe, however it's easy to crack the Hollandaise if you're not careful. Never be in a hurry to add the butter to the sauce too quickly!! Also, be careful to make sure you don't overcook your eggs.

The author clearly mixed up tablespoons with teaspoons in regards to lemon. Recipe also calls for salt but never uses it. There is also something of a skill to making the sauce and it's not really covered here.

Great recipe. I too, after reading the comments, changed the lemon juice to 3 1/2 Teaspoons. Then I followed the recipe and it was awesome. Do youself a favor. I bought an egg poacher at Wal Mart. Cooks 2 poached eggs to perfection in 1 minute, 30 seconds in the microwave.

Excellent. A little high on the lemon and salt, but great overall. Used a regular sauce pan for the hollandaise with medium low heat and just toasted the muffins and used ham. Worked great and was a little more practical. Delicious!

My only complaint on this was that there was way too much lemon juice. Take that with a grain of salt, however, because we did half the recipe. The aftertaste of the dish tasted like Eggs Benedict should, so I think when we try it again, we'll tone down the lemon juice a lot.

As a Chef in Europe cooking the American-Canadian cuisine, I prefer the double boiler method for the Sauce Hollandaise, as you can keep it hot for as long as you need it. The other tip when using wine or vinegar to your water stabilizing your eggs...try swirling the water and then dropping the egg in the middle of the swirl. Makes for a better presentation and better consistency of the egg white when it is poached. Only thing is you have to cook them one at a time. Cheers people and Happy Canada Day Eh!

Eggs Benedict is my husband's favorite, and he loves this recipe (with the lemon juice measured in TSP, not TBL).  And it takes me only about 10-15 minutes to make, not the 30 that the recipe says. I try to do as much simultaneously as I can, so all the pieces stay hot.

3 Tbl is a lot of lemon. Next time I think I will take the suggestion to only use 1. Also this makes A LOT of sauce, I will half it next time as well. I used the blender/microwave method suggested and that worked great. Serving suggestion: Put a dash of dill on top. It's fabulous!

This is a little too lemony for me.  I reduced the lemon to 3 tablespoons and it came out perfect.

Great with one exception.  I used freshly squeezed lemon juice and it was a little too lemony... but was delicious other than that!  With bottled lemon juice, this might be right.  BUT if you use fresh, cut back a bit..

Awesome eggs benedict!  I made for my wife and she loved them.  I followed the easier advice of using a blender instead of double broiler to make the hollandaise sauce, and it came out perfect!

I am NOT an eggs benedict expert and have only had them once in my life.  I'll have to admit that this recipe was NOTHING like my previous experience. I would cut the lemon juice down to no more than 1 - 1 1/2 tablespoons.  I hate runny eggs so I had to cook them twice as long.  I'll try it again with my revisions; less lemon juice, hotter water for eggs and longer cook time, and buttering the muffins b/c they were too hard to cut with a fork.

I knew I shouldn't have tried making my own EB because I love it so much and it's sooo bad for me.   This recipe was great and there's no need to look for anything else!  I actually used beef sausage for the meat and it worked great.

This was recipe was delicous.  However, there was way too much Hollandaise sauce made for the amount of food prepared.  We recommend cutting the sauce recipe in half.  The recipe was fairly easy to follow.  It does take just about an hour to prepare plus cleaning.

This was really good. I wish I would have read the time saver tips before, I'll try them next time. I also plan on halving the lemon juice in the sauce. It was a little overpowering. Other than that it was excellent!

I have never attempted to make eggs benedict before and was pretty happy with the final result.  I took a previous reviewer's recommendation of making the hollandaise sauce in the blender and it was so quick and easy.  Just make sure the butter is very hot.  Mine wasn't and made for a room-temp. sauce which cooled quickly.  That is my only complaint with the recipe.  It is necessary to make things quickly to keep everything warm and then serve it warm.  It cooled off quickly.  Not the fault of this recipe.  Next time, I would make the sauce hotter.

I might suggest garnishing with fresh dill, as an alternative to chives, as well. And I will second the replacing of pepper with cayenne pepper.

Everything turned out great but the sauce. Recipe says 3.5 TBS i used 2 and still had to add 2 eggs and another stick of butter to even out the lemon. Try starting with 1/2 TBS and go from there.

i tried this recipe out for the first time this weekend and it turned out pretty good!
but i did make a few adjustments and had a few minor problems
i only added 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice and still found it too lemony for my liking so next time i think i will add even less.
also, i tried making the hollandaise with the double boiler and i even started mixing everything while it was still cold to avoid cooking my eggs but it was inevitable and the eggs eventually cooked leaving my hollandaise looking chunky and gross, not smooth and creamy.  so i ended up making it with a blender just like another reviewer suggested and it turned out perfectly!
overall i am pretty happy with how it turned out.  i just need to work on my timing and i will definitely wait til the end next time to make the sauce instead of making it at the beginning like the recipe says.

This was just ok.  The hollandaise sauce was too lemony for my taste.  My poached eggs were difficult to make. --I think it would be wise to buy an egg poacher.  You can sub the bacon for thinly sliced ham, pancetta or procuitto.

This is awesome!!! I've made this recipe several times and will keep making it again and again. The hollandaise sauce is absolutely perfect...lemony, buttery, what more could you want? The whole thing from start to finish only takes me 20 minutes to make. For those who gave it bad reviews, I can only think that they must have done something wrong, because this is Eggs Benedict as good or better than you can get in any restaurant.

I really like this recipe. It is really hard to find a good eggs benedict recipe. It is my mom's favourite breakfast and she enjoyed it very much. I served it with homemade hashbrowns (fried potatoes) to make a delicious breakfast! It's exellent!

ECK!  This was so bad, no one would eat it!  Such a waste of eggs and butter, like someone else commented.  I agree with one other reviewer who said she thinks it was supposed to be 3 1/2 TSP, not TBSP!  I always look at the reviews before, and I didnt this time, (my fault) and oh, I wish I would have.  The only reason this even got 1 star because the recipie was easy to follow, and the eggs came out good, but the sauce was TERRIBLE!  I will NOT be making this particular recipe again.

I'm only seventeen and I didn't think this recipe was difficult at all. I don't think "Starlet" read the directions very carefully because she seemed to have tried to poach her eggs under the broiler instead of on top of the stove. The broiler was for toasting the english muffins. Anyway, I love lemon, so the amount was fine for me. I didn't use any salt in this recipe. Thank you very much Avery, this was really good.

I love this recipe!  I've made it several times for my family and twice for Christmas Brunch.  I don't bother poaching eggs and instead just top each English muffin with a fried egg.  I also save the sauce as the absolute LAST thing I have to do in the kitchen before breakfast is served ~ it's fragile and best served immediately after thickening.  Thank you for sharing a wonderful dish!

In spite my goofs, this Eggs Benedict recipe was terrific.  First, I added to much water to the hollandaise sauce and it ended up too thin.  Next, in poaching the eggs, I 1) forgot to add the vinegar, and 2) had the water temperature turned WAY too high - I devastated the eggs and had to start over.  I did keep the "bad" eggs, some of which I filled in on the recipe for a "fuller" taste and look.  Though it wasn't the prettiest recipe I've ever made and I won't get high marks for asthetics - the taste was incredible!  I can't wait to try this again.  I'll do better next time.  :-)

I would give everything else but the hollandaise sauce a 5*****.  I prepared this as a suprise for Mother's Day.  I scaled the recipe for 6, and it called for a whole 1/3 C of lemon Juice.  I used a fresh squeezed lemon.  The sauce formed extrordinarily well and that's the only good thing I could say about it.  The lemon flavor was simply overpowering.  I tried to cut it with a few more egg yolks and cayenne; but to no avail, the recipe simply called for too much lemon.  If I hadn't been ready to almost serve I would have seriously considered dumping it.

Pretty boss recipe and my first time making hollandaise as well. I used regular thick cut bacon instead cause Canadian bacon is gross to me and garlic spinach underneath.

Really good, reduced to 2 tbsp of Lemon Juice and still too lemony, will do 1 tbsp next time.  Overall great dish lemon juice aside

This would have been great if the hollandaise wasn't sooooo lemony! I really liked the double boiler method for hollandaise. It worked much better than the blender method from my experience. I just broiled the English muffins and bacon together. The poached eggs turned out PERFECT and super easy.  It was the most important part, the hollandaise sauce that kind of ruined it. Otherwise a great recipe.  I think 1/2 to 1 tsp would've done the trick.

I've been making this recipe for a while now because it's relatively fast and easy and my family loves it!  I make the sauce in my blender with butter that has been heated to simmering on the stove. As I pour it slowly into the running blender, it cooks the yolk. I do this toward the end of the process so the sauce is nice and hot when I pour it over the muffin. Sliced tomatoes over the ham makes a nice addition.

These were so good! I made my own English Muffins, and I took the advice from one of the other comments and made the Hollandaise in the blender. This was my first time making Eggs Benedict, and they came out near perfect. The Hollandaise could have been a bit thicker, and it was a tad too lemony, but all in all, complete success. To my surprise, even my two picky kids inhaled these. That is the greatest compliment a recipe can get around here. I will make these again and again.

I used this recipe but I changed the servings to 1.  In addition, I substituted the lemon juice with wine and added a splash if tabasco, and white pepper.  It was amazing.  I prepped a metal bowl for the hollandaise, melted (half butter recommended), started water and vinegar for boiling, set out a bowl of cold water, & prepped oven with muffins before I even started cooking. While muffins were toasting I poached the egg and put in the cold water.  Made hollandaise in a metal bowl over poaching egg pot!  Finished hollandaise and put egg back in boiling water while I set up muffin.  Everything came out perfect and hot.  To top it of I sautéed some veggies for the side.  Mmmm. Thank you for good directions!!!

I crashed and burned on this one the first time I made it. The lemon over powered the sauce.  I was determined, so I tried again this week and used a half of a lemon.  That was the trick. I am wondering if the different varieties of lemons are the reason there are mixed reviews on how much lemon works.  Half works great in my case.  I also recommend using an egg poacher rather than fighting a bunch of eggs together in a pot.

Great recipe! Make sure you add one TBSP of butter at a time, otherwise it won't thicken. Also, it's a bit too lemony (for my taste) so feel free to use less.

I make this exactly as written (maybe reduce the lemon a tad if you don't like your lemon too strong but my gang loves it as is)... my toaster has a warming button so I toast all my muffins then reheat as I go, I do not butter my muffins, plenty of butter in the sauce (I use spray butter for the gang)! The kids and the hubby literally lick their plates clean! I do wish I could make the sauce without so much butter without sacrificing the taste! This is definitely one of those "treat" brunches that could kill you if you make it too often! ;0)

I tried this recipe and thought the Hollandaise sauce was just too lemony.  I will definitely try this again, but with a pinch of lemon juice and half the butter this recipe calls for.

I made this to take to my husband for dinner at work one night... I followed the recipe and my sauce separated while sitting...so I started to make it over, but after putting another egg yolk in my pan, I decided to add the separated sauce to that egg yolk over low heat, a little at a time..and it came back together, couldn't even tell and the sauce was the perfect consistancy. Awesome with chive..or dill.  Yummy!!!

Just made this for my husband's birthday. It was the first time I have made hollandaise sauce or poached an egg!  He said it was the best breakfast he has ever tasted. It was a lot of fiddling about ( and panicking) at the end but well worth the effort. I used the blender for the sauce and just a squeeze of lemon. 

I will definitely make it again and anticipate it taking a lot less time now I have done it once. 

Thank you to the contributor!

the hubby liked it but the poached eggs came out funky so i ended up frying the eggs which he loved. Used a lot less lemon, added more worcestershire and tabasco and extra black pepper which was fantastic. 2 pieces of canadian bacon per egg benny, stuck it in the oven with the sauce scooped on top and then stuck the remaining sauce in the oven on broil and then spooned the excess on . Husband loved it! oh and mixed hollandaise with handheld mixer

Too lemony for us - next time I'll try cutting the amount of lemon in half.  My mom suggested using tarragon too.  Easy to make for a first timer like me!

Wow was this good! I followed the recipe just about exactly, except I made it for 2 servings instead of 4. I also cut the butter in half for the hollandaise sauce and substituted the other half with vegetable oil. I took the advice of the other reviewers and prepped adequately first! All the pots and pans were ready, makeshift doubleboiler heated up (sauce pan with stainless steel mixing bowl sitting in it but not touching the water), and used deli ham instead of canadian bacon. Also, toasted the muffins instead of using the boiler. The sauce thickened up nicely as I left it there warm and poached the eggs while cooking the ham. Had the water at just about a simmer and they poached amazingly! Had never poached an egg before, but wow I did it! This recipe rules. Thanks!

I liked this recipe. I have never made eggs benedict before however. I reduced the amount of lemon juice by half a tablespoon and still found it had to much of a lemon punch. I would recommend reducing the amount of lemon by a full tablespoon.

LOVED IT! The first time I ever had eggs benedict was in a 5 star hotel in chicago (dad and I used to take summer time father/daughter trips) anyway, I fell in love with the dish and have ever since been unable to recreate the taste I fell in love with. Although my hollandaise sauce probably didn't turn out the way this recipe does, since I didn't have lemon juice and used white wine/white wine vinegar instead, it was amazing!

A very simple and easy to follow sauce recipe that my family --that is full of self-proclaimed Eggs Benedict connoisseurs-- believes to be better than any they have had in restaurants.  Bravo on a great recipe!  It has become a staple in our house and was a special request by my dad this father's day.

This is one of my favorite recipes! It's super yummy and very easy to make. I leave out the bacon, use whole wheat english muffins and serve it with fresh fruit and veggies to make it seem a little healthier - that way I don't feel so guilty for loving this dish!

WAY too much lemon! Based on another review I cut the lemon the recipe called for in half, it was still a bit strong. With that said, I made this because my husband requested it. I've always disliked eggs benedict, but in spite of the lemon I wanted more than one bite :-D if I'd cooked it as directed I think it would have been unpalatable, but I think with just a bit less lemon it'd be fabulous. I already agreed to try again tomorrow.

I think this would have turned out fine except for the quantity of lemon the recipe called for.  I really wished I would have read all the reviews as it seems I am not the only one who found it to be much too strong.  Other than that all seemed good.  I think I will give it one more try and adjust the lemon juice dramatically...I am really glad I gave it a practice run before I served it to my Mom for Mothers Day!!!

I had never tried making eggs benedict before but I made this recipe for an Easter brunch and it was a hit.  It's my most requested breakfast item.

This was hard to make. I don't know what I did wrong as I followed the recipe exactly! I could have used a tip or two. Were my eggs too cold? Was my butter to hot? I don't know. I will try the blender reciped next time. I'm sure the recipe is great if it is prepared properely

I think this would have been perfect with much less lemon juice.  It was creamy and light, it looked great, it was the perfect consistency - but all I could taste was lemon.  I cut it down to 3 tbsp, but is was still too much.  Next time I'll only use 1 tbsp.

What a disappointment...It looked so good.  This was very easy to make and when it was done it looked delicious...until I tasted it!  Way too much lemon and salt...try as I could, it was inedible.  I ended up throwing the whole down the sink!  I'll try it again sometime, but with way less salt and lemon.  I wish had read the reviews first!

Way too lemony for our family's taste!  Adjust the lemon to your personal taste and you'll end up with a great Eggs Benedict.

i got rave reviews from my bf! we both love a quality eggs benedict which we all know isnt easy to find. This is a KEEPER :) i definately suggest to others to forget the blender idea for the sauce....the ingredients need the heat to come together properly for the flavor. I only used 2 tbsp lemon juice & it came out perfect. just the right amount of tang. Thanks!

Yummy but oh so rich!  This was the 1st time I attempted to do poached eggs or hollandaise.  I started early, had everything ready and took my time.  Everything came out perfect!  I'm no longer scared.  The whole family loved it.

This was wonderful!  Made just as written except I put sliced tomatoe on mine instead of candian bacon.  It was heaven.  My husband LOVED it too, he did candian bacon and tomatoe.  Great flavors and VERY easy!!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm wondering if that should be teaspoons of lemon juice and not tablespoons.  My first batch was far too lemony...I couldn't eat it.  I made the second batch with 3 1/2 tsp of lemon juice and it was much better.  Still with a nice lemon tang, but not overpowering.

This was good, but I'd suggest making the hollandaise sauce last so that it stays thick.  Also, it does tend to be a little salty, but other than that, its good.

Everything was positioned to come out perfectly. I made the sauce first and cut back on the lemon as others suggested (good thing). The sauce was perfect...until....it separated! In the 10 minutes it took to finish the other components, the sauce was ruined. The consistency of the sauce held up for only about 5-6 minutes, but that's it! Next time I will simmer the water in the double boiler, make the eggs, ham & toast english muffins....then lastly mix the ingredients for the sauce and serve immediately.

This was really good. This was my first time making Hollandaise sauce and it was very easy. I reduced the lemon juice to 2.5 TBSP, omitted the white pepper and increased the Worcestershire sauce to approx. 1/4 tsp. For the Benedict I used regular bacon (no Canadian on hand) and added a layer of tomato and avocado just to dress it up a little. It was yummy!

YUM!  My boyfriend claimed it is so hard to make this dish.  He challenged my mom and I by saying we couldn't reproduce his fav brunch item.  Well, he was shocked at how well we did.  He actually licked the sauce off his plate.  Ha, we showed him!  This was great and well worth the effort.

This was my first attempt at making eggs benedict and they turned out very well.  I also put less lemon than the recipe called for.  I made the sauce in a double boiler with no problem at all.  I brought the water to a boil without the top part on, and mixed the ingredients in the top before putting it on the bottom part.  The heat of the butter alone was enough to get the process started, then once I placed the top on the bottom, everything cooked very evenly.

The taste on this recipe is very good, but I had some problems with the cooking methods.  I made the sauce in a blender as suggested by others (excellent) and cut the lemon to 2 TBLs (this was plenty).  I poached the eggs as directed in a large saucepan for 3 minutes.  This did not produce a very good poached egg.  If you have an egg poaching pan, I would use that.  Three minutes was also a little long.  I will try 2.5 next time.  In the end, the product was still very good.

Very yummy! I did have to make the hollandaise sauce twice though, my pan was too hot the first time and the eggs cooked too quickly.  The second time I started with the pan cold and it came out perfect and lesson learned.  I did reduce the lemon, but that was mostly because my reconstituted lemon juice was old and I was unsure of it's quality. I'll try again sometime with fresh lemon juice and I bet it will be even better.

The sauce was too lemony! Also I feel the steps to make this recipe are not clear. After, wastings many eggs trying to cook these in the oven under the broiler, (which by the way I ended up with Egg Flower soup instead as the eggs white separated in multiple threads) I cooked them in the stovetop. I cracked the eggs on a bowl first and drop them in the slow simmering water by carefully touching the surface of the water with the bowl and letting the eggs slowly slide off the bowl. Will not make again.

What a waste of eggs and butter!!!! I have never been so frustated with a recipe. Update: You might need a cast iron saucepan to make this recipe. The handles of my saucepan smelled like these were going to start melting, I then tried a glass baking dish and it exploded in the oven!!!!

Excellent recipe; the hollandaise was really authentic and came together very easily. I used the left-over egg whites to make a pavlova dessert; the only addition I made to this was a garnish of parsley over the finished product before I served it. Rave reviews all around!

This is by far my absolute favorite breakfast.  I have read from Wine Cuisine Magazine that suggested beverage is Chablis, St-Veran, Sancerra, Brut Champagne, and Brut Rose.  I prefer Mimosa.

Recipe turned out pretty well.  I cut the amount of melted butter in half and the sauce was just fine without the extra fat.  I would also cut back a little on the lemon juice.  We really love lemon, but turned out a little too lemony.

Instead of fussing with the sauce, I used a package of Knorr Hollandaise sauce mix and followed the recipe from there......  It's just as good, and 10 times easier!  Is that cheating?

The lemon in the sauce was overpowering!  The eggs benedict that I have ordered at restaurants has never been too lemony.  The texture of the sauce was beautiful though, and the method of poaching the eggs worked perfectly, but I will definately be looking for a different sauce recipe.

Really good sauce.  Personally, we like the lemony flavor. I've poached the eggs the night before--slightly underdone.  Keep in cold water in refrig overnight.  When ready to serve, use a slotted spoon and dip each in a pan of heated water for a few seconds.  Next time I will try the blender method suggested for making the sauce.  Sounds really easy!

A dear friend was in town who loves eggs benedict, so since I had never made it before I came to this site and hit on this recipe. It was a big hit with everyone, even my husband who had never had it before and is a basic eggs & bacon guy. The best compliment came from our friend who said it was very good. Thank you!!

I followed the recipe with two exceptions.  Black pepper instead of white (no white pepper) and garden chives instead of parsley.  The whole meal came out perfect. I was surprised as I had never made Hollandaise .  Birthday breakfast for my Queen.

The hollandaise by itself was a bit too lemony for me but it blended well with the "meat", eggs and english muffin. I did a vegetarian version with meatless bacon! My family loved it!

Did this for Father's Day and my husband was impressed.  I found it a little too lemony so would add less lemon next time. I found this recipe a little out of my comfort zone so was VERY glad to have the associated video because it helped to fill in a few of my knowledge gaps.

Everything was great and family loved it. I topped it with some paprika and chives and added a tad more lemon juice then called for but I think that’s a family preference.

We love it! So we made a few mods. One I accidentally bought strawberry lemonade, but it’s really tasty. Two, we didn’t have rum or triple sec so I used a cup of vodka instead. Three, we agreed with the other reviews and only used half the fruit. Four, we had a little extra wine, so we just dumped that in too. Delish!

This is simple, effective, and delicious but only after I changed the lemon juice from tablespoons to teaspoons. The original recipe was just to sharp. I've made a half dozen times already and it has been right on for my version. My wife thinks it's such a treat and I don't mind looking like a genius to her!

Don’t get me wrong. It was good and easy to follow directions with the video, but the Hollandaise sauce was way too buttery for my taste (& I love butter). I almost couldn’t get the last bites down. It felt like I was eating pure fat or thickened oil. I am going to try to water it down next time with less butter or check out a different hollandaise sauce recipe. Great for left over Thanksgiving Ham.

Not the best I've ever had but it did turn out good and directions were easy to follow.  It is one of the those recipes that you can't walk away from though so male sure you're fully prepared when you begin.

I love this recipe!  Helpful tip:  Don't get in a hurry and add the butter too fast!  My sauce broke last time...lesson learned.  Worked great this time with a little more patience.  Another time I rednecked it up with breakfast sausage and added Cayenne to the Hollandaise and it was awesome as well!

The Hollandaise sauce in this has WAY too much lemon juice. Use about a third of what the recipe calls for.

This is a very good recipe. I added homemade pico de gallo to the plate and cheese on the muffin. I used medium sized eggs which I believe caused the lemon juice to be more pronounced in the sauce.

I made a batch for my Dad for Father's Day, and it was really great! I do recommend using less lemon juice- no more than two tablespoons or it gets really intense! However, the hollandaise was the right texture and the whole thing tasted delicious.

My wife like the eggs benedict (with farmer sausage for meat). I think she was just happy I made it upon her request.

I STRONGLY disliked this hollandaise recipe . It is about as sour as lemonade, and as runny as table cream would be. 3 1/2 tablespoons is A LOT of lemonjuice and I sort of wonder wether it shouldn't be 3 tsp. instead. It doesn't taste like any of the hollandaise I've had at restaurants. The lemon juice was all I could taste.

At least it was runny enough to get off the top of my meal.

I didn't have double boiler so I heated the butter in a microwave then poured it on the egg yoke mixture. Then I thought wait no raw eggs. so I put them in the microwave for a minute., bad move. The cooked eggs separated from the butter.
Now that I know I am eating raw eggs at a restaurant I won't be ordering them ever again.

I gave this 4 stars only because I made it exactly as the recipe said EXCEPT I cut the lemon juice in half and it was still WAY too lemony for us. It was the most beautiful sauce I ever made. I will make it again with even less lemon.  Other than that, and that is just our opinion, this is a fabulous recipe with easy to understand directions. I had never made Hollandaise before and this was picture perfect. I should have taken a pic. But, you know, we were to busy digging in.

I have never tried this before, this recipe was basically a few firsts for me. I have never poached eggs or made the sauce. I made this for breakfast the day after Thanksgiving and my family absolutely loved it. The recipe was very easy to follow and it made making this very quick and easy. And, with it being my first round with ever trying this dish, I was very very happy with the finished product. Thank you so much for sharing this!

Rarely do I have the opportunity to enjoy Eggs Benedict unless I’m on a cruise ship so I thought I’d give this a try.  I followed the instruction with no changes and it was great. I could almost smell the sea. Thanks for sharing.

Follow the recipe. It helps to have a second pair of hands.  You need to give  thought to timing, having English Muffins ready, keep poached eggs warm,  ham ready etc. The Hollandaise recipe is exquisite.!

There was way too much lemon on the hollandaise sauce. I would probably cut this by at least 50%.

Will definitely make again! My family and I love lemon, so we might be a little biased, but it wasn't too lemony for us. Even my picky sister who doesn't like eggs loved this dish.  Also, I forgot last minute to buy Worchestire sauce, and substituted soy sauce , and it was still delicious. 
My only suggestion is this: if you're making this for a big crowd like I was this past Mother's Day, and if you need a large batch of  bacon, bake it in the oven at 425 F. I don't remember for exactly how long, but check on it after 4-5 minutes, and check up on it until it's as done as you like. At the same time you're baking the bacon, you can roast some asparagus to go with the Eggs Benedict. I loosely followed the recipe on this website for Oven-Roasted Asparagus. SO GOOD! Also, last but not least, poaching 10 or more eggs is SUCH A HASSLE! For me anyway, I'm not a pro yet. Save yourself some trouble and get some SILICONE EGG POACHERS. They will save you soooo much time and heart ache. I got mine really cheap at TJ Maxx, but they're cheap on Amazon too. You can poach lots of eggs at the same time, and you don't have to deal with runny whites.

Turned out really well. I used this recipe for just the hollandaise sauce. I used American bacon and extra large English muffins. I used the extra egg whites to make coconut macroons.

I did this Philly style. A local restaurant here does it sort of like this. I added a little cayenne to the sauce and instead of ham I used thin sliced steak. Also I sautéed some red onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms in butter with salt and pepper. It turned out amazing considering it's the first time I've made eggs Benedict. The red onions gave it a nice touch of sweetness. I definitely recommend this if you want to try something slightly different.

I cook every day and have extensive food knowledge. After reading the reviews, I decided to follow the recipe. I'm sad I did and didn't follow my own knowledge. Way too much lemon in the sauce. I'll do half as much next time. Everything else was pretty close. Unfortunately, the lemon almost made the dish inedible.

The eggs benedict turned out  fantastic. My kids just lapped all of it up. A small change I made was added a spoonful of mustard in the hollandaise and reduced the amount of lemon juice, that gave it a sharp tinge with a slight tang. Also, I  went half and half with the butter - half salted and half unsalted. But this recepie is bang on and this is definately become a hot favourite with my family

DONT ADD ALL THE LEMON. So sour it ruined our breakfast. 3 1/2tbsp is way too much I'm just too trusting sometimes with popular recipes. Use 1tsp. I hope this recipe gets changed for the sake of all the Benny rookies out there.

I made it for my husband, he is a fan of this and I'm not so I'm going based off of another. He said it was ok, but was missing something compared to the local diner. He doesn't know what it was missing though. I did follow recipe for 1 serving.

Another rave review here. I can't even get hard boiled eggs right, but the directions for this were clear enough that I managed to make edible and even delicious eggs bennies. I will agree with the other reviewers that the sauce is too lemony. I've made this multiple times with different lemon juice types, and it's always too much. Next time, I'll try to cut it down to 2 tbs and see if that makes it juuuust right, and more like the hollandaise sauce I've had in the past.

Lemon was overpowering. Could have probably halved the sauce recipe for 4 servings. I used cayenne pepper in place of the white pepper, but that's just preference.

I recommend making HALF the hollandaise it recommends. 

I recommend adding a touch more salt, some pepper, and a dash more hollandaise.

 I only poach one egg at a time, scoop out whaI can, then change out the water every 2 eggs. I keep a kettle on with boiling water to move things along quickly.

Turned out great, I made the sauce in the blender instead of a double boiler, adding the hot melted butter in a slow stream at the end and it worked perfectly.

Loved this recipe!!!  First time poaching eggs...would recommend practicing first. Used black pepper instead of white and it was fine. Also I had to 1.5 times the recipe so the lemon juice was just a hair less, proportion wise, and it was still very tangy.

Loved it, but I agree with some other reviews... less lemon juice. Made it with bacon, yum!

For my first time this was an easy recipe to follow. Turned out great, but I definitely need more practice poaching eggs. I also feel like my sauce tasted a little too lemony so I'll probably use less lemon juice next time.

I cooked the eggs for 4-1/2 min. in 190 degree water then used an ice bath. When I was ready I heated them up in low boiling pan of water. I also used the homemade English muffin recipe from this site. So good thank you for sharing.

A hit when you have friends over for a weekend brunch.  I, too, found the Hollandaise a bit too lemony.  Fortunately, I found out making this for my wife and I.  I cut the lemon down and got raves from friends.

Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast of all time. I think this recipe has the basics down but all the lemon juice was too overpowering. I like lots of sauce & this one just took over. Next time I'll cut way back on the juice. Also I used everything bagels and added sautéed mushrooms and spinach to add a little pizzazz.

The amount of lemon juice in this recipe was RIDICULOUS. I wonder if you meant to type 3.5 teaspoons instead of 3.5 Tablespoons. I managed to scarf it down but the lemon juice ruined the recipe. DO NOT USE MORE THAN 1-2 TBSP PEOPLE! :)

Turned out well, except the hollendaise sauce tasted like it had too much lemon juice in it. I used fresh lemon, so maybe I got an unusually sour one? I would use about half as much next time. Also I used salted butter, so I probably shouldn't have added salt to it. Finally, I should have taken the skin off of the Canadian bacon before cooking /serving.

I have to agree with everyone that had a lemon problem... way way way too much lemon juice and this is coming from a person who loves everything lemon. Next time i make this (because it is still good) I will cut the lemon juice to 1 Table spoon MAX! Other than that I enjoyed the recipe

This is a great recipe, took the fear out of making Eggs Benedict.  The Hollandaise sauce was easy to make and came together very easily.  My advice is to read the recipe all the way through once or twice before starting.  Have all of the ingredients within easy reach and completely prepped, because timing is very important in this recipe. Overall a great recipe!

So delicious! Though, when I poach eggs I cheat. I put a ziploc bag or cling film into a ramekin, then crack the egg into it, seal the bag with a bread or twist tie then put it in simmering/softly boiling water for 3 minutes. Perfectly round poached egg!

Prior to cooking this recipe, I had never tried Eggs Benedict before, but my husband had, and he requested that I make them for breakfast.  Needless to say, this recipe gave clear instructions, and turned out great when I made it!  My husband said his breakfast was "outstanding," (and he's very brutally honest when it comes to my cooking), and I really enjoyed it as well. Thanks for the recipe!

At diners I'm pretty sure that I have been served hollandaise from a powdered mix.  I say that based on how incredibly delicious this recipe's hollandaise sauce is compared to any that I have eaten at a diner.  The preparation was also much easier than my husband and I expected.  We've never used a double boiler or poached eggs prior to this recipe.  I think we just went up a level in cooking!  Ding!

What an easy construct! I've been intimidated about making Eggs Benedict in the past due to my perceived notion of the difficulty in making good Hollandaise. This recipe is so easy to put together and the sauce comes out delicious. Just adjust the lemon and pepper to your own liking. Don't buy a double boiler, just use a metal bowl in a saucepan. As long as you keep the water low, simmer not boil, and whisk persistently, it comes out perfect! I may try it with good deli cut thinly sliced ham, as it is more tender. Bon appétit !

This is my first time making eggs Benedict (or poaching and double boiling in general) so I followed the recipe exactly. The hollandaise was a bit too lemony for us, so I'll be adjusting that next time, but otherwise it was a delicious introduction!

Used 3 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of 3 1/2.  Turned out perfect.  Served with lots of homemade hash browns to mop up any remaining sauce.

Waaay too lemony! Cut the lemon juice in half, if not less. I'd recommend adding to taste a little at a time. Too bad to ruin all that butter with too much lemon juice! :( Think it could be a winner, otherwise. (I later added another star because once the sauce was over the eggs, bacon, and muffin, it tasted better. Still, I cut the lemon juice in half the next time I made it. Delectable.)

I couldn't eat the hollandaise sauce because it was too lemony.  I used fresh lemons too. Maybe it will be eatable if you use less lemon.

I couldn't make the hollandaise sauce well. It's like broken emulsion where the butter oil above the egg yolk, especially after adding salt. Anyway, overall it tastes good :)

I have never tried eggs benedict before (at least not that I remember). I thought it was good, but kind of bland.  All I could really taste was the lemon in the sauce and I reduced it as recommended by others. It didn't taste much different than the egg sandwiches I make every morning, but more work and calories.  

My boyfriend is still asleep and he is the one I made it for.  Will post his opinion later.

We always have eggs benedict when we travel but never tried it at home. I must say that the video was excellent and helped a lot with the prepartion. However, the recipe itself calls for way too much lemon. I couldn't eat it after a couple of bites. I would recommend cutting down the lemon juice to 1/4 of what the recipe calls for.

I love eggs Benedict I order it every time I eat breakfast out.  When I made this recipe, just for myself because no one in the family is a fan.  It was the 3rd recipe that I was working on for the day and I guess because it was just for me it never comes out right!  Of course the Holland sauce curdled... It came out so bad that I did not even want to take a picture! but I know the next time it will come out right!!!

I made this using the NuWave cooktop. You can omit the double-boiler when making the Hollandaise sauce if you set the cooktop to low (175 degrees) and use a small saucepan. Also, if you have a modern toaster oven, you can prepare the ingredients from the bottom up and keep them warm in the toaster oven.

There is way too much lemon in this Hollandaise.  If you prefer a forward / strong lemon flavor then cut lemon in half.  I will not use more than one Tablespoon.  Good instructions on poaching though.

I DID IT!!! I am primarily rating this recipe 4 stars for the hollandaise METHOD not for the taste I would only give it a 1-2 for taste--(made as written) Waaay way to much lemon.  I have tried and failed catastrophically many times to make a good hollandaise- but this method with these proportions worked perfectly for me. I used a thin stainless steel bowl for the top of my double boiler and found that much easier to whisk/incorporate all in than a flat sided pot or "real" double boiler. I had the heat a bit too high initially and had to use the hot water trick- worked great- so have it standing by as you can't stop whisking to run and get it. I found it cumbersome to add butter from dipping the tablespoon- so just drizzled it in from the glass measuring cup I had  microwaved the butter in. This was my pre-Christmas practice run- so glad I have time to adjust for the over powering lemon! The rest of the recipe is easy except for timing and keeping things warm during assembly!

As other reviewers noted, we thought there was way too much lemon in the sauce.  Also, I think a pinch of cayenne pepper is better than using Worcestershire sauce.  I guess this recipe is just not for us.

I have had bad hollandaise and good hollandaise. A friends dad cooked it for my family years ago and he took the long way around. The catch was it was delicious! I just recently made this recipe only using about a fifth of the lemon and it turned out extremely close to the recipe that was difficult for my friends dad to make. All you need to do is find the amount of lemon that fits your taste.

Made this recipe for my dad on Father's Day. The English muffin, poached eggs, and all the mixing worked. Really great instructions. 
However when it got to the hollandaise it wasn't eatable and my dad couldn't even eat. I felt so bad. The flavor was extremely sour from the lemon. 
So I made it a second time and lowered the amount of lemon juice and he was able to finish it. However I wouldn't make this recipe ever again. At least not the sauce.
I would use their instructions for poaching though.

So I used the recipe and made these. I was not a fan but the recipe was good. I would suggest cutting back the lemon juice as it was way to lemony. Happy I can say I have made it but not my cup of tea

I also found the sauce was too lemony so much so that it completely took away from the butter flavour.  I also use my own method of poaching the eggs.  In a saute pan generously butter bottom, heat to medium-high break in your eggs, slowly cover eggs half way with water, put on a tight lid.  So much easier!

I have never made or had these, so I didn't know what to expect.  Only took me 2 tries to get the poached egg, so thanks for the good directions!  Too much lemon juice though and definitely puts a dimple on the buns!

I love eggs Benedict, but I only ever eat them in restaurants. Now I know why. This is a lot of work, and while it's tasty, in my opinion it's too much work for too little reward. If I were to make it again, I would use MUCH less lemon (I reduced as per other advice, but I think it could use even less) and a little less butter. The sauce wasn't hard to make (double-boiler worked fine for me), but between sauce, poaching, timing it all, etc. I am now ready for lunch.

Easy and delicious!  This is the first time I tried making Eggs Benedict.  I made this recipe and saved the left-overs.  My son, who is a cook for the premier chef in our area, thought they were from a restaurant!

I made this for easter brunch. It was my first attempt making eggs benedict. I read some of the reviews beforehand...i reduced the lemon juice to 3 teaspoons and it was perfect. Everyone raved about how it was restaurant quality. Thanks for this recipe!!

LOVED IT!!! My boyfriend and I were having important guests over for breakfast and this was the perfect dish and a wonderful recipe. The sauce so delish, I even had some left over to make eggs the next morning.....  I know I'm not great on lemon so I reduced the lemon by 1 1/4 TB and it worked out great. It did turn out a bit thick while making it so I ended up adding the 2 TB of hot water and then it was the perfect consistency.  After broiling and buttering the English Muffins I put the Canadian bacon on them and stuck the back in the turned off oven with the door open just to keep them warm until all the eggs are done. I also took one suggestion of topping off with a pinch of Paprika and it was wonderful. I highly recommend pairing this breakfast with Orange Julius!

Whipped these up in about a half-hour for my children and I, and they were great!  For the first time, I wanted to follow the recipe to the "T", but next time, I will make the English Muffins from scratch, and use cayenne pepper in the Hollandaise Sauce.

I am a guy who "can" cook (but I don't barbecue), but I'm not a chef.  The kids are typical of their age and do not usually like to "try new things", but they loved it.  They just thought of it, more or less, as an open-faced Egg McMuffin with some gravy.

My wife and I love eggs benedict and are always looking for new recipes. This one was simple, and fantastic. The sauce came out ridiculously good and everyone was commenting on how good it was. Can't wait to make this one again.

I like this recipe, but I did make a few changes to the sauce. I'm not a lemon lover, so I use a mixture of vinegar and wine. I also put Tarragon in my sauce. I find it really gives it a nice change of flavor..I guess this is more like a Bernaise sauce, but is the preferred sauce in my house.

Combined the blender method with double boiler by using a stick blender in a bowl nestled in a pot of simmering water since I don't own a double boiler.  Beautiful delicious sauce.  Didn't have Worchestershire so left it out.  Could have added hot sauce or red pepper but didn't consider it until later.

This turned out great.  I read reviews and followed recipe as written.  I did skim and discard the milk fat (white bubbles) from the melted butter.  I have an egg poaching insert (very inexpensive) which is the best way to make the eggs.  I had everything ready and measured.  The sauce only takes a couple of minutes so make it at the very end.  My husband loved it.

Good and easy to make, but the hollandaise was far too lemony.  I would use maybe 2 tablespoons of lemon juice instead.  I used fresh lemons, so I'm not sure if that made it too strong.   Also for me, I would recommend starting everything else while the sauce is thickening.  It took quite a while for me (I don't have a double boiler so I put it on low heat, worked great, but took longer probably).  Everything else was easy and fast!

I have tried the blender and the double boiler and found it is much better the original way.  No matter how fast life goes, some things just cannot be hurried.  This is excellent left alone.

The recipe was easy to make but the Hollandaise had a sour taste.  I am going to try to modify the rest of the recipe to fix the sourness.

This was my first time making eggs benedict. I thought it would be a nice treat for Christmas morning. It was a simple recipe to follow and turned out delicious. I might cut back the lemon juice a little next time, but just by a bit.

first time making and tasting eggs benedict. i read alot of reviews before hand b/c i didnt want to mess anything up. i was only making it for 2-3 ppl but wanted to follow the directions to a T even though i knew there would be some wasted leftovers (after making it successfully i figured i would change servings to 2 the next time) SUPER easy. read and re-read directions and reviews quite a bit. used alot less lemon like suggested in reviews (calls for 3.5 tb and i used 1tb). besides that i did everything else exactly as called for. cant say it if 'tasted' like it should have since ive never had this before but it was wonderful and tasty and will def be making again but just in a smaller batch. prob wont try another recipe since this seems like a winner for me and easy enough! timing everything out and keeping it hot is your best option to get it right for sure so keep that in mind. 4 hands could be useful for this one :D

Really REALLY good.  I followed the instructions to the letter - except that instead of Canadian Bacon I got ham-off-the-bone sliced wafer thin.  I actually like the texture of the thin sliced ham better for Eggs Benedict.   OH and I didn't do the double-boiler thing.  I just put the pan on very low heat and to keep the heat extra low, I would occasionally take the pan off the heat altogether.  It worked and the sauce came out great.

I added a bit more lemon juice, per other reviews, and the taste of the sauce was just right - until it fell apart on me.  Tried as I might, I couldn't get it to bind back together. I'm deducting a star because the recipe isn't well-worded.  Part of the failure was due to my not reading the recipe properly - part was due to steps 1 & 2 of the sauce being worded incorrectly.  I'll be making another attempt at this!

We thought this was great!  I didn't have a double boiler, so I just did the sauce on low in a regular pot, and it turned out wonderful! Definitely will make this again. (PS I also used canadian bacon instead of regular bacon).mmmmmmmm

I made the Hollandaise sauce in the blender, (it is a good basic recipe) and used regular ham.  This is a good eggs benedict recipe, although the details for perfect poached eggs and bringing all the elements together with perfect timing could be improved.

It could have been me...but I found the hollandaise sauce to be too tart. All I tasted was lemon, not the silky, buttery flavor I was expecting. I will definitely use less next time I try this recipe. Overall it was yummy, how can you go wrong with egss benedict for brekkie?!

The first time I made this recipe, well it was a disaster.  The double boiler method to make the sauce was a huge failure despite my best effort to follow the directions exactly.  I ended up with a lumpy, very unappealing hollandaise sauce. The 2nd time I attempted this recipe; I used the suggestion of other "raters" and mixed the hollandaise sauce in my blender.  Much, much easier and the results were perfect - a nicely incorporated sauce, not a clumpy mess.  I still haven't determined however what our preference is regarding the lemon juice.  3 1/2 T. of lemon juice seemed like too much however during the 2nd try, we reduced the lemon juice to 2 T. and that actually didn't seem to be enough.  I guess we'll just have to keep experimenting with the lemon juice.  Over all however, a really easy recipe.  The only down side is that this is a recipe that should be piping hot for the best results.  A real challenge when you are preparing this for 4 or 5 people (the eggs will get ahead of you, the muffins will start to brown too quickly, or the bacon or sauce will start to get too cool).  I'll definitely try this again.

My husband and I weren't very impressed.  I follwed the directions and they just didn't turn out.  The holiday sauce had a flavor that I did not care for.  For all the work it wasn't as  good as I wanted it to be.

I half the lemon juice because it's a bit overwhelming for me otherwise- plus I can always add more in. This is absolutely delicious, but so far the sauce hasn't saved well. It separates in the fridge as I imagine the acid from the lemon cooks the egg more, which makes it grainy in the morning.

We tried this a while back for our family Sunday morning breakfast. The sauce is incredible. I use an egg poacher for the eggs. It is a recipe asked for often, except by the teenagers who won't touch a poached egg. Thanks Avery for the posting.

A great recipe, I used orange juice instead of lemon in the sauce, and I added a bit less butter.  The sauce tended to separate but it wasn't anything a good stir couldn't fix.  I used Healthy Menu's vegetarian bacon instead... thanks for the great recipe!

This was the first time I made eggs benedict and I decided I wanted to make it while I was making bacon.  The sauce was super quick and easy but like the other posters said, there's too much lemon!  I always read the reviews b/4 I make a recipe but I didn't this time...oops!  Used regular bacon instead of canadian.   Quick, easy and good recipe!

I had a lot of problems with the hollandaise sauce.  The recipe calls for you to make it first and set it aside, but the sauce thinned and separated when it sat.  I made it again and served it immediatly, which was ok, but the leftover sauce quickly separated again.  I would not make this again.

My recipe for hollandaise sauce is MUCH easier, and you don't need a double boiler.

everything is perfect, except I found it much better to use MUCH less butter for a more consistent sauce. Also adding bits of parsley adds a slight touch to the meal as a whole.

Too much lemon!  I'd start with a couple of teaspoons and go from there.  Other than that, the sauce is easy to whip up and has a nice consistency.
