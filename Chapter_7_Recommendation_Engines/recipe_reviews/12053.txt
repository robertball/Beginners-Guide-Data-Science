My dinner guests really enjoyed this one.  Make sure you do burn off the vodka though, because I didn't at first and it was WAY too strong, like taking a bite out of a shot of vodka or something.  YUCK.  I had to boil the sauce for a little while to burn all the alcohol off of it.  Over all, great taste made it with farafelle pasta and served it with asparagus.

This is tasty. Be careful not to over salt, as the smoked salmon will add a lot of saltieness to the sauce. This recipe makes a pretty small amount of sauce, so if you're serving more than 2 or 3 people, I suggest doubling it.

I am from Scotland, the home of smoked salmon and it took this great American site to show me the best ever recipe for smoked salmon.  Everyone who tries it wants to know the recipe.

oh this is good!!!...i doubled the recipe to use up the ingreds i had...the only thing i changed was to use sweet red pepper (chopped) instead of fresh tomatoes coz i didnot have them and used 'alymers gourmet pasta sauce with shrooms' for the tom sauce otherwise...i simmered it quite awhile coz i think i used too much cream but it reduced nicely, no harsh vodka taste and well it was well worth making...will forsure recommend this recipe and i will make it again...thanks for sharing...

Made this last night for dinner with my boyfriend and it was fabulous!  Very easy and elegant.  Served it over farfalle with sauteed asparagus spears on the side.  I added two cloves of garlic and a chopped shallot to the sauce and a bit more onion (red) than called for.  To make it healthier (and because I do not like very rich sauces on my pasta) I used half-n-half in place of the heavy cream and Smart Balance Light margarine instead of butter.  I did not add any additional salt.  I was worried that it would be too salty, but after adding the tomatoes (on the advice of other reviewers, added in the last few minutes of making the sauce) and mixing with the pasta, the saltiness was fine.  Will definitely make again!  Also, I doubled the sauce except for the salmon (chopped up 4 oz, which was a lot) and it ended up being WAY more than just two of us needed.  If you are making it for 2-3 people and are eating normal-sized portions, I would not double the sauce.

I found this recipe to be wonderful with my home-made smoked salmon but, very, very rich.  I subsituted 1% milk with half & half instead of the heavy cream.  The cayene pepper gave it just the right bite and the more you simmer, the thicker the sauce.  No need to simmer the vodka down off of the burner however....just turn the burner down super low, it still works!

My husband and I really enjoyed this meal.  I started out with a pretty deep sauce pot and was able to burn the Vodka by removing the pot from the heat and lighting it with a match.  We'll definitely have this one again.

I made this with some salmon fillets that I baked in the oven. I really liked it (although I wish I had added some garlic) but Husband wasn't so keen on the vodka flavor. He also didn't much like the super pink appearance. I give it 5 stars, he gives it 3. I served it with buttered egg noodles and fresh green beans. Good stuff!

Yummy! I made a few changes. I didn't have any smoked salmon on hand so I used one can of pink salmon. I also switched the butter for garlic butter. It came out great! Very easy to prepare.

This was very tasty and my husband and a guest we had over the night I tried it thought it was really great. Just a note: it needs very little salt. I put in probably a quarter teaspoon and it was too salty.

I loved this recipe -- great for company dinners or any night as it almost tastes too good to be that easy! I followed the directions exactly and had no trouble getting the vodka to burn off, and the result was delish!  I served it over bow-tie pasta with steamed asparagus.

Not what I was expecting, and we won't make it again.  We used a high quality smoked salmon, but it tasted fishy to my husband and I.

Really good but needs a pinch of sugar I think.  Used a crappy jarred tomato sauce and it was fine. Halved the sauce since it makes so much and it was perfect. Topped it with a spoonful of Parmesan. Loved the heat from the cayenne. Made it two nights in a row and liked the smoked salmon much better when I tossed it in the sauce right before tossing its the pasta. It didn't overcook end maintained more of its smoked-salmony flavor that way. Though the whipping cream was a bit heavy, will use half and half next time.

This makes a quick, rich and elegant entree. After reading reviews I took some hints. For four servings, I doubled recipe and sauteed two cloves of garlic with the onions and salmon. Didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used drained, canned diced tomatoes. Be sure to use a good quality vodka in this recipe, it makes a big difference (per America's Test Kitchen), don't go cheap! After cooking onions to opaque I increased heat to light smoking and then added vodka (Three Olives). Simmered sauce while 2 cups, dry, of  Farfalle pasta was cooking. Forgot the cayenne pepper so I'll add it next time but 1 Tbsp. looks excessive to me. Will add a bit at a time to taste next time. My smoked salmon from Ward Cove, AK was not too salty so I added 1/4 tsp. salt. I served this dish with a pear/gorgonzola salad with sweet & sour dressing and toasted garlic bread. My husband and I both enjoyed the pasta very much.

This is a great recipe - I really enjoyed it. The first time I made this dish I added a little too much pepper so I decided to add only the cayenne pepper next time and there you go: really delicious, something different - in a good way - so this is going to make it in my own little cookbook :) Thanks for sharing this recipe...

This was very nice. My husband loved it. I love creamy tomato pasta sauces, and this one is definitely a keeper. I put it on top of whole wheat spaghetti and served with garlic bread.

Fabulous! DH inhaled his portion in 5 minutes flat. To cut down on fat, I subbed half & half for cream and increased the tomatoes. The canned tomato sauce was extremely salty -- the whole dish ended up slightly too salty, even though no extras were added.

Everyone loved this sauce. I followed others' advice and burned off the vodka (I tripled the recipe, so I really had to) and I also served it with asparagus over spinach wheat fettucine. TASTY!! Well done.

I quadrupled the recipe, though I added only about 4 oz of vodka (I was a little nervous about a whole cup) and this was AMAZING.  The absolute best vodka sauce recipe I've ever had.  Making it again tonight!

As suggested, double the sauce. I added garlic and more onions and sauted them until soft before adding the vodka. The cayenne pepper is essential. It adds the warmth the sauce needs. Be careful adding any salt because the salmon will likely impart enough salty flavor. I will make this again.

Perfect amount for 2 servings.  I used evaporated skim milk instead of the cream, worked great.  I felt it needed more kick so I added more cayenne and next time I think I'm going to used crushed tomatoes (with spices) in place of the chopped/sauce.  I didn't find it "rich and creamy", more tomatoey---just fyi.  Still yummy.

When I first saw this, I thought it was a really unique combination of vodka with smoked salmon and in creamy tomato sauce.  Nonetheless I decided to give it a try for a dinner with my husband.  I have to say that this dish is either a "you certainly love it" dish or "you absoulutely hate it" dish.  My husband loved the sauce so much that he ate my share (because I hated the taste of vodka in the sauce.)  I'm thinking if it would work better with white wine.  There is certainly no need to add more salt.

i made this for a spaghetti party and at first the guests were skeptical about the tomatoes in it, but once they tried it it was devoured.  Excellent sauce.  It was the only one completely fin ished by the end of the night

This is so good. Instead of the tomato sauce, I just pureed 5 small tomatoes, I added a clove of chopped garlic,chili powder and shrimps. Sauce was a nice pink colour. Usually I have a pasta vodka recipe with bacon in it, but will use only this recipe from now on.

I've used a variation of this sauce with different fish and seafood and its wonderful everytime. Try using clams instead of salmon and it makes a creamy soup/chowder. Throw some extra veggies in for color and added flavor.

I used fresh salmon and baked it first, broke it up and added it to the sauce rather than using smoked salmon and it worked just great.  My husband and I had salmon ravioli in a local restaurant and I used this recipe to make a very similar sauce - it is delicious with four cheese ravioli.

Great recipe! But after you add the vodka you might want to keep it on heat to help the alcohol burn off.

Tried this and loved it!  (Although I never did get the vodka to flame up...just cooked it off.)  Hubby thought there were too many tomatos, but I thought it was just right.  Will do this again!  Thank you for sharing.

This is a great recipe.  The Vodka flavor compliments the salmons very well.  When reduced to very creamy it is very flavorful.

This is one of my favorite pasta dishes as it comes together very quickly and it is so tasty.  I add a little clam juice, use tomato paste, and add a handful of frozen peas at the end.  Let it simmer for a few more minutes and it's ready.  I use whole wheat penne not because I like it but it is healthier.

Absolutely sensational, what a delicious and impressive dish.  And the best part of this recipe is it's 10 minutes from start to finish!  I used about 1/3 of a medium onion, and a 4oz block of black peppered salmon.  I also used Absolut Peppar Vodka, and an entire 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  Just added cream until the right blush appeared, about 1/3 cup.  A light sprinkle of cayenne, and viola!  Great recipe, fatima, sincere thanks for sharing with AR.

I make this on a regular basis and it's always good. I use milk as it can easily get too rich, and I never use salt, the fish is salty enough.

My husband brought a bunch (Cha-ching $$$) of smoked salmon back from a business trip in Fairbanks, AK and I thought this would be a clever way to incorporate it into our recipe repertoire . . . alas, NO!
. . . 

Long story short, this was not well received by my guests or myself.

This salmon sauce was the best I have tried.  I did make a few changes, more out of need then want.  I didn't have tomato sauce, so I added more tomatoes and some ketchup.  Now, I know you are cringing at the moment, but, it was actually very good.  I will try it next time with actual tomato sauce, to compare.  Also, I added more salmon and it was fantastic.  The other thing is, I didn't take the sauce off of the burner, but just lowered it.  My husband loved this.  It is a winner in my opinion.

This dish is a winner!

I made it for my husband on Valentine's Day and both of us really enjoyed it. It didn't taste overly fishy and the vodka and cayenne pepper made the sauce interesting without overwhelming the other flavours. I had no problem burning off the vodka. It was quick and easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this delicious dish for my husband's birthday. It was excellent. I added some extra onion and 2 cloves of garlic per a review.  I didn't have nutmeg so I added a pinch of allspice.  It was almost exactly the same recipe we had on our first date at a fancy Italian restaurant.  I didn't add any salt or pepper, the cayenne was just right! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Eh . . . not good.  Kinda seemed like a waste of perfectly good smoked salmon.  Used a good quality smoked salmon, substituted Red Wine for Vodka (didn't have any) - added Asparagus and then added some chicken breast to make meatier for the men in my family.  I will not be making this again.
