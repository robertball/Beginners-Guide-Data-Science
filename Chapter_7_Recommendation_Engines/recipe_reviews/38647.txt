This is an excellent recipe. I use lowfat buttermilk to reduce the fat , omit the sugar and use sugarfree jello to cut the calories. I add 2 cans of drained mandarin oranges and occasionally change the flavor of the gelatin. My family loves it made with lime, lemon or pineapple also. YUMMY! No one suspects it is buttermilk giving it the rich texture and flavor.

I make this often, only substituting two cans of drained mandarin oranges. I call it Creamsicle Salad. I always get requests for the recipe. My dad fell in love with it and started making it for friends and family gatherings and all the people who try it fight over the leftovers! EDITED LATER: Oh. And I forgot. I add a bag of mini marshmallows, too.

Just for fun I poured mixture into empty orange halfs and garnished each top with 2 manderine orange slices and mint leaf.Makes nice individual servings when you have a large gathering!

This is an unusual combination of ingredients but OMG is it delicious!  A great way to get kids to consume buttermilk - you can't taste it at all!  You gotta try this one!!!!!

This was ok. It was not the normal jello salad. I liked how the jello set up with the buttermilk in it, that was pretty. But it was ok, nobody raved about it.

Although this recipe takes several steps to prepare, it's well worth the time.  We loved it!  It's definitely a keeper.  Next time I might try another flavor jello just to experiment.

My grandmother used to make this with strawberry jello and you know, I have never thought of using a different flavor! I am so glad I saw this!
We do it a little easier though. No added sugar, just boil pineapple and juice and add jello, remove from heat, stir in whipped topping and buttermilk and let set in fridge. Just for those of you who are like me and need to do it all at once and forget about it!
Thanks for posting Diane!

Quite tasty!  Makes a big bowl.  Leave out the extra sugar - it doesn't need it.

We enjoyed this cool and refreshing salad on a warm day!  The only change I made was to use one cup of buttermilk versus two. I placed salad in an 8" x 8" dish, chilled and cut into squares.  Thanks Diane A. for sharing your easy and delicious recipe here on AR!

Very tasty. I modified it. One package of sugar-free orange dissolved in about 1/3 cup of boiling water, add in 1 cup buttermilk. Mix in 1 large and 1 small can of drained mandarin oranges and half of a large container of large-curd cottage cheese. Set up very nicely in a square casserole dish. I will try pinapple/lime next. (I didn't reveal the buttermilk in the recipe until after my husband said he loved it.)

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner as a side dish/desert.  It was a hit.  Everyone sat around trying to guess what was in it.  No one imagined that one of the ingredients was buttermilk.  So easy to make. The  family loved it and I will definitely make it again.   The combinations of Jello and fruit are endless. Thank you so much for sharing.

This is really easy to make. I was looking for something different for Thanksgiving, so I  used cranberry jello with the pineapple and added about 1/2 bag of marshmallows. It was really good! will definitely make again!

Good!  A different twist to a Jello salad.  Followed recipe, but next time will incorporate some suggestions made by others.  Next time will reduce buttermilk to 1-1/2 cups, add 2 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1/2 of a 10 oz. bag of mini-marshmallows.  Will also, after cooling mixture to room temperature, just mix in the rest of the ingredients and refrigerate to set.  Note:  Should cover with plastic wrap to store, as my dish got a little rubbery after 2 days without being covered.  Used an 8 X 8 inch glass dish, no cooking spray since did not unmold.  I'm not a buttermilk drinker, buy I do enjoy buttermilk recipes and the flavor it lends.  Will definitely try again with other flavors or fruits and Jello.

Awesome recipe -- so easy and good! I Always keep the ingredients on hand. I omit the extra sugar and add a tablespoon of real vanilla extract to nail the dream sickle flavor. We've made it with several different flavors of gelatin but always keep the pineapple. Love how the gelatin colors the pineapple and the fact that the pineapple juice is used. For NewYears, I am using peach!

Quick and easy Jell-o salad to put together.  It is very versatile in that you can change Jell-o flavors or use mandarin oranges in place of the pineapple.  This time I made it as written, but have also made with other flavors.  It is a great recipe to make if you have buttermilk to use up.  Thanks Diane for a delicious salad recipe.

I really liked this jello salad!  I had something just like it growing up at family functions and now I know how to make it myself.  It was really good with sugar-fre strawberry jello and low-fat buttermilk.  Yum!

Wonderful taste.  I halved the recipe without a hitch.  My pineapple had been drained for other purposes, so I replaced the liquid with Sprite, actually.  I also used vanilla soy milk for the buttermilk.  I added about a teaspoon of white vinegar to the mixture, which is a trick that works on regular milk. Hopefully the same is true for soy milk so this was perfectly authentic. Thanks so much!

I always like to make a recipe the first time with no adaptations. Next time, I will omit the sugar and use sugar free jello. Deelish as written, but too many carbs and sugar for a Type 2.  The second time I made this, I used sugar free jello and one packet of Stevia. It was perfect.

I used 1 tbsp Splenda and 1 tbsp sugar, sugar-free orange jello, low-fat buttermilk & whipped topping plus I added an 11 ounce can (drained) of mandarin oranges. Turned out pretty good. Tends to separate into 2 layers- the lower half is basically orange Jello and the top half that when partially frozen really is quite a bit like a creamsicle. Calculating by the total calories of everything that went into making it and dividing that by the 12 approximately 2"x2"x3" squares I cut it into came out to about 125 calories apiece.

We really enjoyed this!  I added a can of drained mandarins as suggested by reviewers and used Splenda instead of sugar.  After it was completely set, we put it in the freezer until it was really firm (but not completely frozen and hard)---it was sooo good that way. Will definitely make again and will continue to keep it in the freezer and take it out an hour or so ahead to let it thaw somewhat before serving.  Thanks so much for this tasty, low cal dessert.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes. I make it (without nuts) when someone in my family is sick. It's the perfect comfort food along with homemade chicken and dumplings.

I make a similar recipe with apricot jello and no added sugar and it's great. So leaving out the extra sugar should work fine.

This is attractive and tastes good, but it didn't wow me.  The buttermilk is an interesting addition and gives a nice tang, and the pineapple adds some texture.  I might make this again.

I served this with spicy ribs.  I needed something to cool down the spices a bit.  I used sugar free cool whip and sugar free jello.  I also added mandarin oranges.  It's kind of like a dreamsicle.  Good!

Great addition to our Thanksgiving dinner. Skipped the sugar doesn’t need it. This salad is like a dessert almost - sweet and creamy. Goes great on a Thanksgiving buffet line. - especially if you want a variety of choices. Easy to prepare the day before. Paired great with a baked ham, cabbage rolls, green salad, roasted beets and carrots, steamed potatoes! Etc - would definitely make this again for a large family dinner.

Delicious!  Made as is (other than making buttermilk out of whole milk & 3 T vinegar).  Very sweet, orangey flavor!  I put it on a bowl but it sets up so well, it’d be more impressive in a casserole and cut into pretty squares with mint leaf on top.

A co-worker brought this in for everyone. It's delicious! I really like orange Jell-O and with the Cool Whip mixed in with everything else it was like a Dreamsicle (y'know, the orange popsicles with the vanilla ice cream center?) with a bit of pineapple! It was creamy and the pineapple chunks were a great addition for flavor and texture.

I made this as written EXCEPT I didn't add any extra sugar and added some mandarin oranges. The kids in our small church group LOVED it and so did a few of the adults. So light and delicious! Our pastor's twelve year old son asked me for the recipe, so...yeah, it's THAT good! Thanks!

I made this without the sugar. I thought it had a great taste, sweet but had a little "bite" to it.  Didn't have a jello mold so I used an 8x8 pan. I didn't oil the pan.  A refreshing dessert. Will make again. Thank you.

This turned out great!  I used sugar free peach jello,  low fat buttermilk and left out the sugar.   This is a wonderful diabetic friendly dessert if you use the sugar free jello.

Far too sweet for my taste. I made it as per the instructions with no changes. I will likely try this again, but I plan to omit the sugar, replace some of the pineapple juice with water and add cream cheese to cut the sweetness. People with a seriously sweet tooth may love it as is.

Delicious!! Just like my grandmother makes it! You can also use pears instead of oranges for the bottom, and you can add cottage cheese to the mix for a bit of tangy texture

This one is a winner. I loved the taste of the buttermilk.  I made it with sugar free jello and couldn't even tell. it was still sweet.  I was asked by everyone how I made it and if I could give them the recipe. Needless to say there was NO LEFTOVERS!  Thank you for sharing.

Instead of pineapple, used a 15 ounce can of undrained mandarin oranges.  Used lite whipped cream and it set very well.  Will definitely make again.
