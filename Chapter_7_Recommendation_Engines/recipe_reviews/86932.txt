This sandwich did not turn out well for me, following as the recipe was written. Broiling eggplant for 5 minutes underneath several other vegetables does not allow the eggplant to cook at all. In the end, I took the sandwiches apart, broiled the eggplant on it's own, then reconstructed the sandwiches. If you like cooked eggplant vs raw, I would recommend either frying the eggplant in a little bit of oil on stovetop or placing, lightly salted, under the broiler prior to making sandwiches. Our sandwiches turned out okay after I cooked the eggplant. I didn't have any mushrooms or red pepper, but the sandwich turned out perfectly fine in the end.

Excellent sandwich that's easy to put together and tastes great! I grilled the veggies and the bread. I mixed some olive oil along with garlic, salt, oregano and basil and brushed that over everything and placed it on the grill.  I assembled the sandwich adding fresh mozzarella and a bit of balsmic vs. pesto.  Overall, very good!

I love this sandwich!  I made my own pesto sauce from the Vegan Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto recipe on here.  I sliced the eggplant with my mandoline slicer, sweated it for an hour, rinsed and dried, brushed with olive oil, then grilled it.  (I followed the method from finecooking.com How to Cook Eggplant).  I'm so glad I took the time to grill the eggplant--I'm sure it's great as is, but I need cooked eggplant for other recipes and it is delicious that way!  I left out the onion and used grilled globe squash instead of the mushrooms.  I also had to sub cheddar instead of mozzarella.  I made two sandwiches so I could have one for lunch tomorrow at work and I wanted to eat the second one as well!  My oven broils on high and low, and 5 minutes on low broil was perfect for this sandwich.  Thanks for the recipe!

soo good!  I sauted the onions and peppers and broiled the eggplant by itself first.  I don't like mushrooms so I left that out, assembled the sandwich and broiled for a few mins till the cheese was melted.  Very good!

I used olive tapenade instead of pesto and no goat cheese,sharp cheddar instead.I also used Ciabatta bread...fantastic!!! Be sure to add enough salt and pepper. Pepper totally makes this sandwich. Maybe next time a bit of Balsamic? It's a winner.

I lightly grilled the eggplant, onions, mushrooms and red peppers. I also used fresh mozzarella. My family loved it and we will certainly make again. I agree with others that a good quality bread should be used.

I accidentally forgot to add the spices (basil and oregano) and only had brick cheese but it still turned out excellent. VERY GOOD recipe. Thank you.

I grilled eggplant, red pepper and onions before assembling the sandwiches and then grilled the assembled sandwiches as well. I also lightly toasted the bread.  I pan fried the mushrooms in some light olive oil.  My husband, who doesn't like vegetarian meals, loved this and asked for seconds.

I substituted slices of summer squash for the mushrooms and spread crushed garlic on the bread instead of the pesto. Absolutely delicious and so fresh tasting!  A great summer meal!

I sauteed the mushrooms and eggplant before broiling, and this was delicious! I don't prefer peppers or onion so I omitted those. I sparingly used shredded cheese. I definitely recommend this!

This recipe was very good as listed. It was also very good on a tortilla, rather than bread or a roll.

Pretty good, though it turns out I'm not a fan of eggplant.  I will make it again without it.

I, like some of the other viewers, grilled the veggies first. But before grilling, I added the seasonings to some olive oil and mixed it with the veggies in a large bowl. Then grilled the veggies. Also, for my meat lovers, I had fried bacon on hand to add to their sandwiches. Everyone RAVED over this recipe! Thank you.

I made a few changes and loved the delicious results.  I substituted goat cheese for the mozzarella, grilled the eggplant, omitted the onion and grilled the sandwich.  Yummy.

I made this for the first time for my boyfriend his sister and her husband who all eat meat. Im a vegetarian, we left out the onions but it was a huge success!! Everyone loved it and kept complimenting me! I gave credit to all recipes. Love this site! You rally do need to broil the eggplant for atlas five to ten minutes. Wile I I'd that I sautéed the green peppers, added the mushrooms a few minutes later, with crushed garlic, when the eggplant was pretty much cooked I put the sour dough bread in the oven to toast for a few minutes. Then took it out put everything on it and put it back into the oven to warm everything up and melt the mozzarella. Will make this again!!

This was very good - I definitely agree with many of the other reviewers who grilled or sauteed their veggies first.  If you layer raw veggies I don't think they would all cook properly, even if sliced very thin.  I omitted the tomato, used fontina cheese instead of mozzarella and a multi-grain ciabatta bread.  I did think it needed a little drizzle of balsamic vinegar, but otherwise I really enjoyed this!

A delicious sandwich that is also pretty filling.  I left out the mushrooms b/c I don't like them and I broiled the eggplant by itself before putting it on the sandwich, but other than that I stuck with the recipe.  I enjoyed this with a bowl of soup for a healthy and light dinner; perfect for summertime.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very hearty veggie sandwich that makes for a nice dinner. Husband's only complaint was that he wanted a slice of bread on top. It was already tall so you'd need a big mouth to eat it that way! :P

When I told my husband I was cooking eggplant for dinner, he actually groaned in protest.  He is a meat and potatoes guy and eggplant is too "exotic".  He devoured two helpings and said he was pleasantly surprised and kept talking about how good it was.  I toasted Ezekial bread in the toaster first and used Classico pesto for the spread (it tastes amazing).  I cooked the eggplant on our grill along with the veges.  Brushed them all with an olive oil infused with meyer lemon.  Popped the sandwich in the center of the oven on broil as instructed.  Can't wait to cook this for my vegetarian son and his fiancé. This will be a standard in our family for a long time to come.  Thank you for the recipe!!

Sandwich was stacked too high and got too close to my broiler flame, resulting in some charring.  All in all, flavor not worth the effort on this one.

Soooo yummy! I cooked (sautéed) all veggies except for the tomato & mushrooms a bit beforehand. Everything else was as in the recipe. I can't wait to have this again!!! Super yummy & healthy!
