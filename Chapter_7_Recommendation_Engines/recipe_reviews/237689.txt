My family liked the salmon. I think the yogurt added a lot of flavor to the salmon as well as the lemon.

These were so delicious! I used shrimp instead of salmon and I added salt, pepper and a clove of crushed garlic to the yogurt sauce. Such a nice fresh, light, easy meal that was ready in less than 30 minutes. I'll be making this more often!

I liked everything about this recipe!  It came together simply using fresh, healthy igredients, and it tasted delicious!  And clean-up was a snap!
I grabbed flatbread by accident (instead of the called for pita bread), and we actually liked it this way!

My husband liked this. I don't eat fish so I'm going off his review. He said it had good seasoning and really liked the sauce. Easy cleanup and very easy to put together.

I'm not a big fish fan, and I don't like salmon, so we used cod for this recipe.  This recipe wasn't my favorite.  The fish was too bland.  I guess I was hoping for something with a Gyro flavor and that was totally lacking.  I think it would have been better if the red onion had been left un-grilled, like an Gyro is, but maybe that would have overpowered the fish too much.  I do LOVE the Reynolds Foil method of grilling the fish and use it ALL the time for my pescetarian daughter.  When the rest of us are having meat on the grill, she gets fish cooked in non-stick Reynolds Foil.  Thank you Reynolds for introducing us to this quick easy method for grilling fish!

Since my local small town market didn't have any pitas, I used small flour tortillas in their place.  So you can say we ended up with Grilled Salmon Greek Tacos.  We enjoyed the filling, but were'nt overly impressed.  I think there's something missing.  Maybe it could use more herbs and seasoning.

I made this tonight. I am not a seafood person of any kind but my son loves it. This was my first attempt at salmon. I tried a bite and I think I did pretty good. Thank you Reynolds for your cooking method. Clean up was such breeze!

We did both a salmon pita and shrimp pita and loved both. Easy weekday recipe with fresh ingredients.

Since I don't like salmon, I decided to use chicken for this dish.  It worked!  The sauce was very good with chicken.  It was a very good summer meal that was so easy to prepare with virtually no clean up.  A win-win.

It's a good take on a traditional gyro.  I wasn't sure if my family would like this, but they really did!  The preparation and cooking was easy and kept our house cool!

I wasn't sure what to expect from this recipe, but, I was pleasantly surprised!   It was light, flavorful, & so easy to prepare!  Cooking the salmon in the foil packets left me with no mess in the kitchen or on the grill and was nice on a 95 degree day not to heat up my kitchen!  I made exactly as the recipe stated, but, I did doctor up the yogurt sauce.  I left out the basil and added cucumber, lemon juice, & fresh garlic to taste more like a tzatziki sauce.

I really enjoyed these!  Even my picky 3 year old enjoyed the salmon!  It was SO easy to make and cook, along with an easy cleanup!  I followed the recipe, but I also added a bit of lemon juice to the greek yogurt for a tiny bit more tang.  I also didn't have any lettuce on hand, so we didn't use that, but they were still great!

I don’t care for salmon so I didn’t have any, but per my family it rated a 4.

We LOVED these!  We're a salmon family, and although our grill had died, we were able to create that slightly-smoky flavor but cooking them under the broiler.  Juicy and little-to-no-mess, and each person could help themselves to the portion they wanted.  We may just take Lillian's suggestion and try it again with shrimp!

I absolutely love cooking with Reynolds wrap especially on the grill! This recipe though was just ok for me I'm not a huge fan of dill, so without the yogurt dressing I liked it. It very summery I would make this again with a different dressing.

I love that this meal was fresh and easy to make. A bonus was no mess leftover on the grill to clean up afterwards. I don't eat salmon but I was able to substitute tofu in place of it. I prepared the tofu just like the salmon and it turned out great! I love that the  yogurt sauce is included with the recipe!

This was a great recipe, the salmon was nice and moist.  It had a great lemon flavor and was perfectly seasoned. I loved that the Reynold's wrap kept the mess off of the grill, as well!  I followed the recipe as posted and added feta cheese for some extra flavor!

These were tasty! The salmon grilled in the foil packet was cooked perfectly and had great flavor, and the yogurt sauce was a nice accompaniment. The family enjoyed these! Thanks for sharing. :)
