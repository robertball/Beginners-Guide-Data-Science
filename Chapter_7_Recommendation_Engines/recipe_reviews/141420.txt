If you're having trouble getting the RedHots to melt, just put them in the pot when you're boiling your water....that's what my recipe directions call for and it works perfectly.  Add the boiling water/candy liquid to the gelatin in a bowl and stir until it's disolved and you're ready to go!

I loved this one so did everyone else.Make sure that the jello is a soft set before adding fruit and nuts though.That way it is all the way through the salad not just bottom layer.I also had trouble with the red hots melting.I just took out what didn't and added a little cinnamin candy oil to it.WOW! It was just like a candy apple.

My family loved this super-simple recipe!  I didn't have any celery in the house, so I used cherry flavored Craisin's instead, and I think I'll stick with that instead of the celery in the future, because it really complimented the flavors of the apple and cherry jello nicely.  The red hots never totally dissolved, so I just fished out the bits that didn't melt.  I used sugar-free Jello and fat-free cool whip to garnish, making this a really yummy low-calorie snack.  Thanks!

This is wonderful, I've made this jello for years.  I leave out the nuts and celery though, and sometimes I use the jiggler recipe on the box for firmer jello.

My mom handed this recipe down to me, but we use lemon jello instead.  The cinnamon candies never melt all the way and never use a metal spoon for serving.  It liquifies the jello for some reason.

I couldn't resist giving this a try. Three of us loved it and 2 just thought it was okay.  I'll probably make again.

I made this to go with grilled teriyaki pork tenderloins one night when having company.  It was good, but did not compliment the pork as well as I thought it might.  It was a little too "spicy" along with the teriyaki flavor, and I think just the apple flavor such as in Sauteed Apples from this site might have been better.  Was pretty good, though.

More like dessert than salad - could make for an interesting pretzel "salad".

I've been making this for my children since they were old enough to walk.  They loved it then, and 40 years later still request it every Thanksgiving and Christmas. Just goes to show that not everyone grows up-especially when it comes to tradition.

I also omitted the celery and walnuts.  Here is what I did to solve the problem of undissolving candies: Modify recipe to 1 1/2 cups boiling water (divided), and 1/4 cup ice cubes (about 4)***Mix the jello, candies and 3/4 cup boiling water as instructed above. Transfer all but remaining candies to mold. Then, use the remaining 3/4 cup boiling water to completely dissolve the candies, whisking as needed.  Drop 4 ice cubes to aid in setting.

I've made this recipe for holiday meals for years. Only difference is I omit the celery and walnuts, and shred the apples rather than chop them. (I like the texture better that way.)

If I can't find red hot candies, I've used Fire Jolley Ranchers too. To melt, just put them in a pot with the hot water on low heat and wait until they've dissolved. (You can add more water if needed.) It makes the house smell wonderful!

I've tried different flavors of red gelatin. Cherry is by far the best. It adds just enough tartness to make it taste more like apple. Definitely a keeper.
