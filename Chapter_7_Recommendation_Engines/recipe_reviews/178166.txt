These were very good. I have an essential oil company. If you don't like the texture of the lavender buds, you can add a couple of drops of high quality lavender essential oil to the recipe.

I'm fortunate to live in an area where there is a lavender farm, so lavender is easily obtained. If you make this recipe, be sure to use only lavender that has been grown for use in cooking. It will be pesticide free and organic.
That is very important so that no poisons are ingested.
This is a nice, light recipe.

This is a nice change from the usual lemon bars. I used an 8 x 8 pan and had to cook both stages a little longer. But this helped make a denser bar, which I prefer. I also used egg substitute instead of whole eggs. The color wasn't that great so I added three drops of yellow food coloring. I did not really like the bigger pieces of lavender in the lemon base. In fact, mine kind of migrated toward the middle instead of being evenly distributed throughout the egg mixture. So I would suggest grinding them up with a mortar and pestle or a small food processor. I also added the zest of a lemon. Wasn't sure how the kids would like this, but they did. They are used to eating lavender though.

I too love lavender, and these bars were great! I know a lot of people don't consider lavender something used for food, but i LOVE it!

really interesting recipe. I didn't have coconut oil so I used all butter... I had a pack of dried lavender I had purchased at the grocery store some time ago and finally found a use for it. I like the flavor.. bonus.. when this was baking the house smelled wonderful!  I also added a zest of one lemon instead of the extract

Tasty, but I do prefer a higher filling to crust ratio. I left out the lemon extract as it was optional, skipped the additional half teaspoon of lavender buds and used sweet almond oil instead of coconut oil. I used freshly squeezed lemon juice (3 lemons) and the zest from all them too. I think the extra lavender would've been too much for these bars. Without it, they have a nice floral undertone that makes them taste very light and spring-y.

I loved the addition of lavender, it goes perfectly with lemon. I tend to like my lemon bars more on the tart side than the sweet. I added 2 additional teaspoons of lavender buds to the sugar, and used 1/2 cup less sugar than stated in the recipe in the lemon portion. And I did not add the powdered sugar on top. It was delicious!

I LOVED this recipe, it was so good the bottom part was perfect with the gooey lemon on the top I love the twist of lavender in it, and I would definitely do it again!

Delicious. I don’t think I heeded the “softened butter/coconut oil” well enough. I had to add more runny-soft oil to get the base from crumbs to dough. Otherwise/ fantastic!

Loved it. Next time I will grind the lavender buds in a mortar before adding them to the baking mix. The texture of the whole buds is not too appealing for me. Also, I miscalculated the amount of lavender sugar (my bad!) and ended up with more than what the recipe called for. I added the additional sugar to some lemon pancakes that I made later on... DELISH!!!

These are my go-to when asked to bring a dessert.  I grate 2 lemons and add the peel to the recipe.  Two lemons also conveniently yield 1/2 cup of lemon juice. :)

well. I made these yesterday and half the pan is gone already. I made some adjustments based on what I had: I used a 9x13 pan; I added the zest of one lemon to the filling because my lemons didn't yield a full 1/2 cup of juice; i used a few drops of lavender essential oil to the filling instead of the additional buds. My husband couldn't stop eating them yesterday and I can't stop eating them today. I used a metal pan so I tried to get the crust as even as possible but it's a bit thicker in some parts. They are great! I definitely recommend them.

Very good, I was running low on oil so I just used all coconut oil in the recipe. My blender wasn't powerful enough so I just left the lavender in the sugar whole, they still turned out fine. I also had to leave it in the over for another 15 minutes, but other than that they turned out delicious!

They were delicious if a bit sweet.  I would cut back on the sugar next time.
