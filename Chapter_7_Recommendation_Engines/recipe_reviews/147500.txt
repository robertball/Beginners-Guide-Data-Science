I took this recipe to a Sangria Party and there was a contest with 25 other Sangria Recipes... this one was the WINNER! It was excellent!

Only 3 stars, b/c to me, it needs some work.  I just tasted like peach nectar... and why ADD sugar to peach nectar, I'm not sure.  I am going to try again with different ratios.  Maybe two bottles of wine to 3 cups nectar, 1 cup basil, juice of two lemons, and maybe, just maybe 1/2 cup sugar. Thanks for the recipe though, I would not have thought of this combination. Just needs a little tweaking for my tastes. Take care!

Oh! My! Gawd Becky! This recipe is amazing and I'm always asked for it when I serve it. I do use Sprite zero to cut calories and probably add extra triple sec for a bigger buzz. Lol. So delicious and perfect for a hot summer day.

This recipe is awesome. It is so refreshing on a hot summer day.  The next time I make it, I am going to try a little less sugar, or just add a little more wine. Cheers!

Ps. I would have posted a photo, but we drank it too fast!

Yummy!  A great way to transform a cheap bottle of white into something delicious.  I used a 1.5L bottle of wine, 1/3 c. sugar, 2-12oz cans of peach nectar, and a 0.5 oz pkg fresh basil.

I was looking for a light/refreshing/fruity cocktail to serve at a party and I found this one. The basil is not overpowering, but a very nice complement to the fruit in this drink. Sometimes it is hard to find peach nectar, or somtimes it is bland or kind of metallic tasting when you buy it in a can, so we used half mango nectar and half peach. I served it with cheap magnum sized bottles of chardonnay (nothing too sweet) and it was great. Everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe. Nicest thing about it, was we had leftover syrup from this recipe, and I put it in a mason jar in the fridge and continued to make it a glass at a time after the party. So yummy!

I was really disappointed with this recipe. It was too sweet and "syrupy". I would not have used all the peach nectar or nearly that much sugar. I did however like the basil flavor.

This was really good - I only used 1/2 the sugar called for in the recipe and I used apricot nectar instead (all I had).

Suprisingly delicious combo. Had this at a friends party, loved it and have now made it twice myself. Everyone LOVES this. I used a little less sugar than the recipe calls for and a litle more wine :)

Very refreshing!!  I used 1/2 pear nectar and 1/2 peach nectar, as I was afraid it would be too peachy!  A big hit!

Great combination of flavors.  Cook down the fresh peaches and basil in the peach nectar for richer flavor.  Also added vodka/reduced sugar to cut sweetness.

This is super yummy!! First time I used peach/mango nectar, and didn't like it as well as just peach nectar. I like to put about 1/3 cup of triple sec in too.

yummy! made a double batch (thank goodness!) Used only a bit of raw sugar, and it was still very sweet.  Next time I will nix the sugar. I cut up a bunch of peaches to float on top. I used 1.5 liter pinot :) Thanks!

Very yummy! I threw a little infused vodka (peach & clove) in with the peach/basil nector and let some cut up peaches soak in it for awhile before I added the wine. (Since I only had sweeter white wine I cut down on the sugar a bit).

I really wanted to like this, but the peach taste was so overwhelming.  I left out the added sugar to start, and I still thought it was too sweet.  I wanted to taste basil, and it just wasn't there.  This sounds good, but the recipe is off.  I may try to work with it to get a taste I like.

If I could rate this Sangria 10 stars, I would.  This was absolutely amazing.  As per the other members I reduced the sugar to only 2 tablespoons for 4 servings (one bottle of wine).  This was a FANTASTIC recipe.  I will make this all summer long.  You could add a little vodka if you wanted a kick but this is amazing as is! Thank you so much for sharing!! :)

Very interesting taste! I would make this again, but differently.  For me, I pureed the peaches to get the netar, and I got a gritty texture that made it more of a smoothie than a sangria. My bad. Make sure you get rid of all but the juice from the peach through a cheesecloth.

I'd use about half as much sugar next time - and don't use a sweet white wine. Maybe use less peach nectar as well, or, as others have suggested, mix it with another kind of nectar. The basil adds a really interesting flavor, and this is pretty simple to make, so I'll likely try it again with those adjustments.

I took this to a sangria contest as well and won hands down.  I like to make people guess what is in it....people are shocked that it is basil!  You can also cook chicken in this....when it reduces down it's delicious!  This soooo amazingly good.  The amount of sugar could be cut in half.

Was ok. Was very sweet and I even cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup. Only added 1 can peach nectar - and even that seemed overpowering. Over all, it wasn't bad. Refreshing on a hot afternoon though. Think I'll hunt down a different recipe next time.

I reduced the peach nectar to 2 cups and omitted the sugar the second time I made this because it was too sweet for my taste.  The basil does seem odd, but it adds an interesting quality.  I used my lemon reamer to bash the basil around in the pot, which worked better than the back of a spoon.  I floated slices of lemon in the pitcher for a pretty presentation.  Overall, this recipe was a hit!

Delicious & perfect for summer!!  The basil cuts the sugary sweetness of the peach nectar.  Next time I will try adding vodka or champagne for a little extra kick.  If you don't serve over ice, make sure it's nice and chilled!

I've made this several times and it's always a hit.  When I can't find peach nectar, I substitute apricot necar and add a splash of peach tree schnapps.  For a more intense basil flavor, I usually make my basil syrup several hours ahead of time and let it sit before straining out the basil.  I serve over ice and garnish with a small sprig of fresh basil.

I have made this for a few parties and now it has become my reputation.  People remember it all year round and can't wait for my basil to grow so I can make it again!  I now grow twice the basil I used to just for this recipe.    I prefer using mango nectar and will usually add 1/2 the sugar of the recipe.  I've tried different types of white wine, may I suggest staying away from moscato!

Easy and very refreshing.  I used Splenda instead of sugar.  Since I was just testing the recipe, I decided to cut the recipe in fourth.  The single-serve cans of peach nectar and wine worked perfect for this purpose.

An unexpected combination but tastes amazing.  Make a virgin version using club soda.

This was AWESOME!  I am always looking for new sangria recipes, and this one really is fantastic.  The basil adds so much refreshing flavor.  I am not a chardonnay fan, so used an inexpensive (Rex Goliath) pinot grigio and it was perfect.  Everyone LOVED it!

Great find! Serving it at an early morning wedding outside. The couple wanted an alternative to mimosas and after they tried this recipe...they were sold. This drink is light and tasty. I did cut the sugar to 1/3 c and another batch had no sugar at all...only 3 T of honey. Delicious!

Absolutely scrumptious!  I doubled the recipe, but kept the peach nectar to only 5 cups, otherwise too peachy.

Very tasty although a little sweet. I doubled the recipe but only used 1 cup of sugar. Next time I would probably use even less sugar. I also used mango and peach nectar.

What a refreshing and yummy drink!  Easy to make and quick too!  I added 1/4 cup of sugar so it had a hint of sweetness instead of what the recipe called for. I left the Basil leaves in the Sangria for a nice visual effect and served it over a little ice.  Will make again soon!  :)

My initial reaction was, hmmm - peach and basil?!? But, oh what a wonderful marriage of flavors!! Since I had one last ripe mango on my tree, I sliced half of it into the nectar and basil mixture, bringing it to a simmer then cooling.  After straining, I blended it with pinot grigio - very refreshing flavor! 

I will definitely serve this at my annual bbq next summer!

I reduced the sugar and added more wine, but still a bit too sweet for most folks.  Also, it is a MUST to strain the basil after cooking, otherwise the leaves become a total pain.  I used mostly peach nectar the first time and mostly mango nectar the second time and preferred the mango.

I always use less sugar..most recipes are too sweet. Made this for my best friends wedding shower...the girls all loved it and so much more economical than having to serve many bottles of expensive wine...I did use a good quality "black box" wine..and some bottles of good pinot grigio...the basil (from my garden) makes it very interesting...used "Looza" Peach nectar

Everyone loved it, I had a party with the sangria as an option to drink, before you knew it it was all gone and I had made a double batch, but when I made it I used 1/2 cup sugar(for each batch),1/2 peach nectar (goya), 1/2 pear nectar, and I also threw in some peachtree schnapps I also added fresh ripe peaches, strawberries, grapes and let sit overnight. Delish!!!!!

Why have I never thought to put basil in Sangria??? It was AMAZING. I was asked for the recipe multiple times. I omitted the sugar because I don't like sweet drinks but I did add some fresh peaches since it was the season for them. I will be making this again and again!

I used 1/4 cup light brown sugar, 1 cup basil, juice from a lemon and lime, and 1/2 cup peach nectar in the saucepan. I poured 1 cup of peach nectar in the pitcher with ice. I used 2 bottles of white wine and poured it over the basil in the strainer.  I also added some fresh basil sprigs and big peach chucks in the pitcher. 
I thought it was sweet BUT very delicious!  It was a hit at my party and gone in less than 2 hours. 
I made a second batch the same way except  with 4 bottles of Moscato.  It was fantastic! I will definitely make this again.

After reading about how sweet it was I got nervous and used about an eighth cup of sugar and chardonnay. This made the drink very dry. If I try it again, I will use sauvignon and add 1/2 to 3/4 cup sugar.

I made this recipe for myself and a few friends, and it was a hit! Unfortunately, I couldn't get any basil at the grocery store, but I substituted mint for the basil and it was delicious (I'll definitely be trying it with basil next time)!!! I'm usually a red wine drinker, but the combination of peach nectar, pinot grigio and mint was delicious! It was especially refreshing outside on the patio.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but the basil just didn't seem to belong.  I only used 1/2 the amount the recipe called for, and it had a medicinal aftertaste.  I did try this recipe without the basil, and it was okay --
