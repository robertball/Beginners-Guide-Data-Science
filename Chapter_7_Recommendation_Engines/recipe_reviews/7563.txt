I just made this recipe for a friend's daughter's high school graduation.  It was very easy to make, but did require time.  It made a very lovely cake which I filled with raspberry all-fruit preserves and chocolate cream cheese filling.  I did use all of the egg yolks; adding them to the creamed butter and sugar.  It worked out great!

I thought this was a great cake.  I made it for a party, everyone raved.  I did use more yolks than the recipe called for.  That's the only change I made.

I want to make a cake with this recipe but I have questions.. will a double of this make enough for 2 12 inch, 3 9 inch, and 3 6 inch layers? all 2 inches high. and would it work to freeze it a week or two early? also, would Bavarian cream be to slick too layer a cake this big with?
