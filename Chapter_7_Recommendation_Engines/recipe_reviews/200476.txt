I would give this 5 stars with a lot more spices. Although it has molasses we still needed nutmeg and more cinnamon with some clove. YUM! Also we used Almond milk instead of heavy cream. Our new favorite french toast recipe for sure.

The flavoring of the molasses is subtle and is quite delicious.  I sprinkled in a lot more cinnamon than the recipe called for.

Even though I healthied this up by using whole wheat bread and milk in place of the cream I though this was fantastic.  I was a little heavier with my spices but it's the molasses that really makes this dish.  It adds such depth.  Great recipe.

I made several adjustments to the recipe and the result was what I call the perfect french toast.  I used 2 tbsp of molasses.  I whisked in about 3 tbsp of flour and 2 tbsp of sugar into the egg/milk mixture.  I did not have cream so I used milk and still got good results.  I also put in a small pinch of salt.  I read that putting flour into the milk mixture will help the bread to get crispier and it did!!   Also, use lots of butter in your pan which helps the bread to get a crispier coating.  The result is a french toast with a nice crispy brown outside and the inside had a nice combination of a bread / custard-like texture.  I do not like french toast that has a heavy custard texture on the inside!!  The flavor has a nice balance of sweet and somewhat savory with the ginger/salt combination.  Oh and I also added a dash of nutmeg as I do to most things that I bake.

This recipe is so good!  I made it at a family camp out with the boy scouts.  I whipped up the custard the night before at home and put it in the cooler.  All we had was Shop n Save white bread but it was oh so tasty and it had rave reviews from the scouts and leaders!  Will definitely be making this again!

Excellent!  I did choose to add extra ginger and cinnamon like other reviewers.  And I only had thick butt ends of cinnamon raisin bread, which I believe made it even better! Mmm. This recipe is definitely worth a bookmark!

HUGE hit with all of us. We absolutely loved this. I don't keep challah bread on hand so I used the whole wheat I had at home. Also, because I did not have heavy cream, I used fat free evaporated milk because it's good at mimicking the thickness and richness of cream. I doubled this recipe (we're big on french toast in this house--my husband and kids can eat almost a whole loaf in one sitting) and I was a little more liberal with the spices. I served this with my homemade maple-vanilla syrup and we all just loved this french toast. This might be my new go-to recipe to make french toast from now on. NOTE: I did not use the butter to cook the french toast. I used my huge countertop grill which is VERY non-stick, so the butter was unnecessary. We spread it on the hot french toast after. ;)

This was tasty for me (I love dark molasses). The bf added European butter and Maple Syrup. He is not a fan of molasses.

I did not use Challah bread (I do not keep that "in stock" and this was a whim). I used plain old white bread. 

I am lacto-intolerant and he drank all of his 2% milk other day so I subbed Silk Soy Milk. 

Next time I think I would use 2 tbls and 2 tsp of molasses. Will try this again but have to find a way to make the bf also happy.

Just made this recipe with "Cinnamon Cream Syrup" recipe from this site. It was DELICIOUS! Only thing I did differently was add a little salt to the egg mixture and I used French Bread (from "French Bread" recipe from this site, also an excellent recipe)

Ehhh...it's OK.  The molasses flavor was pretty strong.  I added a little extra ginger and cinnamon and also added some nutmeg, but none of that really came through over the molasses.  Not terrible, but I don't think I'll make this one again.

I used wheat bread and regular milk, so i was not thrilled about this recipe... although my changes probably have everything to do with it. Will definitely make again, next time when i have challah on hand

EXCELLENT.  Used approximately half a tsp of cinnamon + a pinch more, and added chopped pecans on top of each slice.  The flavor of the pecans intensified due to the cooking.  Incredibly good.

Have made this several times almost as written - used whole graim wheat bread and a few times forgot the cinnamon.  It is delicious anytime of day.... ive even had this for dessert.  I drizzled organic ginger syrup that I happened to have In my pantry on top with whipped cream over that.

We liked this rather subtle variation. I left out the sugar - no need when you are going to use syrup anyway. I didn't get much molasses flavor so may add more next time. We embellished with fresh raspberries. yum.

Yum...the texture in these is great! All caramelized and yummy. Don't be afraid to let these get really well done-that's how they're best.  I have discovered though that i am really not a fan of molasses, no matter how hard i try. :) I think i'll leave it out next time... Oh, and i only used 2 T of molasses and added a bit more than a pinch of cinnamon sugar.

This was wonderul, thank you for the recipe.  I didn't have any Challah bread and used sprouted bread (Ezekiel bread).  The batter only made enouh to cover 8 slices of bread so I will double it next time.

I followed the recipe and found it to be too sweet for us. I would suggest using less molasses - and ensure you use light not dark. 

Cheers, and thanks for sharing

I have used Brioche, Texas toast, and cinnamon swirl bread. I don't bother with heavy cream; I have used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, evaporated milk, skim milk,  and there is a little difference but not much. My favorite bread is the cinnamon swirl!

I followed the recipe exactly other then all I had was some white bread.  My wife loved it but I thought it was lacking a wow factor.  Will make it again since she like it.
