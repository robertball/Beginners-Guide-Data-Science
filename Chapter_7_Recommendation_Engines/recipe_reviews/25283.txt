I made a couple of changes in this recipe, and it was a hit at the holiday table.  In fact, my father-in-law whom barely eats anything, tore this up! I omited the chiles because there was going to be a child at the table, and I forgot to pick up the french fried onions, so they were left out as well.  As another reviewer did, I cut back on the amount of creamed corn, which made the texture less runny.

Our family and friends have all enjoyed this excellent dish.  I have made and served it numerous times.  To "jazz" it up a bit, I added a (for us) generous "dash" of ground red (cayenne) pepper.  Also, I use the full 8-oz pkg of cream cheese; to me, at least, it improves the texture and flavor.  Of all corn casserole recipes I've ever used, we like this one best; not only for flavor, but for presentation.

This recipe is wonderful, and is so easy to make! It has become a family favorite at Chrismas, and a great dish to take to potlucks. It still tastes great reheated the next day. One piece of advice- don't use fat free cream cheese, the texture didn't turn out right when I used it.  Also, I noticed that the people who were complaining about the dish being too runny were also the ones who omitted the french-fried onions.  These absorb a lot of liquid, so if you don't like onions, you will need to subsitute something in their place.

This is a delicious variation on a corn casserole.  Thank you!  I used some Oscar Meyer bacon bits, a few more chile peppers and one-third creamed corn to 2/3 whole kernel (thereby reducing the "soupiness" noted by some others) with good results.  The first servings resulted in seconds, a cleaned out casserole dish and a request for the recipe.

This was a great change to the normal buttered corn or creamed corn. I left the chillis out so my kids would eat it and next time I may have to reduce the onion a tad only because my children are very picky. The fact that this recipe can be adjusted to suit picky eaters and still maintain a wonderful flavor and texture makes it a true keeper. Thanks!

We make this recipe every year. It has become a family favorite at the holidays. Make sure you give it enough time to bake. It typically takes longer than the recipe calls for.

I used 2 cans of corn instead of the creamed corn, and 4 fresh whole roasted chili's instead of canned. It  turned out delicious. It got great compliments at the family BBQ!

I omitted the fried onions so my children would eat this and covered the top with bread crumbs. I thought that the taste was out of this world, as did all of the other Thanksgiving diners. The consistency was a bit runny to me, even after adding an extra can of kernal corn; but I would definitely make this again with a few modifications. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this recipe was alright though all of my guests enjoyed it and asked for the recipe.  I felt it was missing something in regards to flavor and I think next time I would cut back on the amount of green chiles used.

Made w/o chilies, used onion powder since family dislikes onion chunks, topped with breadcrumbs instead of onion...call it operator error, but I'm reviewing this for my own records later on...it just tasted like cream-cheese coated corn kernels. DS loved it but I guess I was looking for a more bread-y dish. Thx for the post, but I won't make again; sorry to upset the reviews with my own tweaks.

If you double the amount of french fried onions, this is delicious!  Otherwise, it's just meh.

Made this tonight for company. It was very easy! I used eight ounces of cream cheese, and omitted the green chiles since I wasn't sure if my guests liked spicy items. I'll include them next time. YUM!

This was only ok.  none of my family went back for seconds.  I won't make this again, even if I make changes.  The chilis gave it a funny taste, and it was a very loose concoction.

I just made this in the spur of the moment.  Family liked it because it was different and not heavy.  The consistency was not what I expected and it did not look like the given photo (above).  This made me glad I made it for family and not "company."  It was a bit runny, but according to other reviewers that may be because all I had on hand was reduced fat cream cheese.  I omitted the chopped onion and didn't miss it.  The fried onions add enough onion flavor.  I will make again and use regular cream cheese.  Maybe the creamy-ness will be there.  Flavor is good though.

Easy and filling! Only problem was it was a little too runny. I only used 1/2 a can of creamed corn but I will only use normal corn next time. I thought it would have more kick with the green chilies but next time I will add a tablespoon of hot sauce too. I forgot french fried onions so we used tortilla chips instead which was pretty yummy.

I made this casserole for a family dinner, I wanted something a little different , this one definitely fit that criteria. I doubled the recipe and it was all gone. Just had a request for the recipe last night. I have put this one in my favorite recipe file.

I made this recipe with a couple slight variations and it was a hit!!

I used a 12 oz tub of cream cheese. I added about a quarter cup of sour cream. I also added about 8 pieces of already cooked bacon chopped up while sauteeing the onion. I also added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar. I didn't want it spicy so I left out the peppers. I did season the mixture with a little salt and pepper as well cause every recipe needs a little S & P. I did not put the fried onion strings in mixture only on top.

This is my Hubby's favorite corn dish ever. He loves this stuff. It is good. Rich and Creamy and very flavorful. I left out the peppers and added bacon bits instead and dashed it up with some Hot Shot pepper and Everglades seasoning. I made this for Thanksgiving and for Christmas..and will make again very soon. It's easy to make and very delicious. Give it a try!!

Fast, easy and delicious!!  I think next time I'll use low fat cream cheese since there is already so much flavor in this recipe.  I'll see how it goes...it's just great as is.  Everyone had seconds.  Thanks, Amanda!

I made this meal because corn is my favorite vegetable. I fixed this exactly like the recipe stated with the exception of a little more chopped onion. I gave this five stars and will definately make againl.  The serving size suggests eight servings. I think this may be an overstatement . I think six would be closer because there will surely be calls for seconds.

GREAT!!  Everybody loved it - what a good base to just add things you like, like roasted peppers, string beans, etc.  I just had mild chiles - will get spicier next time.

V good. Lots of compliments. I didnt use canned green chilis tho  I added about 2 tsp chili pepper flakes (dry) and about 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. I also used one 8 oz package cream cheese instead of two 3 oz. this made the consistency just right.

I made this the first time for my in-laws! Yikes! But I was pleasantly surprised when my picky eater father-in-law took seconds, thirds, and then repeatedly complimented me on the dish! At first I was undecided whether I liked the recipe, but the more I ate it grew on me. It is very different than I had expected but I found it warm, comforting, and filling. Very enjoyable! I will make it again!

hard to rate something when you change it up - but it was the basis for my dish...used whole 8 oz block of cream cheese; used 2 cans mexicorn instead, half can cream corn - and left out the chilies; used crushed Ritz crackers instead of onions - so the kids would eat it; and added a good "shake" of crushed red pepper -- with these changes - it was very yummy !

This was a hit at my Thanksgiving Dinner this year.  I had 30 folks over and needed a lot of sides.  I followed the directions exactly and thought the green chiles added nice flavor without being too hot.  Definitely not lo-cal, but you shouldn't be counting those at the holidays anyway!  I will make it again.

I served this for Easter and it was a hit. I did up the creme cheese to an 8 oz block and cut the whole kernal corn to a small can. There are no leftovers. Will make this again.

This is so delicious!  I've made it with and without the green chiles (substituted with green onions) and it was great both ways. Recipe turns out perfect just as it is, doesn't need any adjustments.

My family and I absolutely loved this casserole!  I doubled the recipe and added a few chopped jalapenos for a little kick.  I used the Cheddar fried onions rather than the regular kind - tasty!  It was a huge success at Thanksgiving and I'll be making it often.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was very good, but I love corn just the way it is. I probably won't make it again because no one really ohhhed and ahhhed over it. But great for the family who wants corn jazzed up.

It was a really good recipe, although I omited the onions and peppers because I'm nursing - which just left the corns, butter and cream cheese.  I read others say that it was missing something, so I added about a Tablespoon of ground black pepper.  The consistency was kinda thin, but it tasted great.  My husband hates corn, but loved this dish.

This turned out to be more like a dip; not solid enough.  But nevertheless, the taste was great.  Also tastes good cold, with chips.

Really enjoyed this recipe. After tasting the casserole before baking , I decided to add the remaining 2 oz. of cream cheese (total 8 oz. ), shredded Mexican cheese blend, Morton’s Nature’s Seasoning & some red pepper to taste. My 2 grandkids devoured over half of this for dinner! Love the creaminess & gooey cheese as well as the touch of heat. This will definitely be on my menu for a holiday meal.

I made this with 8 oz. of cream cheese, two cans of sweet white corn (no creamed corn - bleah), half the can of chilies and some pimento for color.  I was told that I "hit it out of the park" for a church supper type casserole.  They loved it.  Just the right amount of time to assemble and make (1/2 hr approx.)   My kind of recipe.  Not runny, just yummy.

Made as written. Although the flavor was good, it was too rich with all the cream cheese and no other binder or filler to our taste. 
I may try it as combined with the recipes that call for a corn bread mix or other more traditional scalloped corn recipes.

A bit too oniony for our taste. Will make again with sauteed onions and see how that turns out. I used frozen corn (instead of a can of whole kernel), but kept the rest pretty much the same as the recipe. After mixing, put all in the slow cooker for a few hours because I was going to a potluck. May try the oven next time.

This casserole was a HIT at Thanksgiving dinner!! This was my first time bringing a dish to Thanksgiving dinner and this recipe was so easy to follow. I did make some changes though. I omitted the green chiles and also I added a little over half a pack of cheese biscuit muffin mix (to give it some texture) and 1 cup of shredded cheese. I used light butter and reduced fat cream cheese.. I also used onion powder instead of using an onion.  Turned out GREAT!!! My family has requested that I  make this again for Christmas dinner!!

I made this just as instructed and it was so greasy and salty tasting.  Not sure what happened.  So I scooped it back out and added breadcrumbs and baked again.  Hoping its eatable for Thanksgiving. Although, now it looks like a dressing. Lol

I followed this recipe exactly and didn't like the result at all. Although I'm a big fan of all of the ingredients, when combined the dish just tasted strange. A weird mixture of sweet corn, tang from the chilis (no heat, which would have been better maybe?), and just a ton of onion flavor. And the texture was also odd. Won't be making this again.

Great alternative to plain corn. The only modification I did was use 2 cans of whole corn instead of one and 8 oz of cream cheese. It makes the consisitency less runny. I use this recipe every Thanksgiving.

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  Always a hit at pot lucks or bbq's.  I am making some today, probably for the 10th time.  (Not sure why but I have not had good luck making this recipe in the crockpot.)

I just made this yesterday May 24, 2009, for a BBQ. There was none left and EVERYONE wanted the recipe. I skipped cooking the onion and just added dry minced onion. I will be making this again and again. It went very well with BBQ chicken and ribs! I highly recommend doubling the reicpe, which is what I did. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a decent, occasional side dish. I used the cheddar onions. It was a nice touch.

Good flavor. I hate to admit that I messed up by not draining the whole kernel corn. When I printed the recipe, it says to drain on another line so I missed that part. Therefore my dish was runny. Otherwise, I liked it.

The Best! I made this for two Thanksgiving dinners and for myself tonight. It is that good!!! If you leave out the chiles it is still good. A little more cream cheese does not hurt; use the whole package!!

I made this for my Thanksgiving gathering and everyone absolutely loved it!  The only thing I did different was that I sprinkled a little shredded cheddar cheese on top before adding the french fried onions.  I would highly recommend this recipe.  I passed the recipe on to several people.  I will be making this one again!

This is my new favorite casserole.  I am called on to bring this to any function we have and it is always empty when I leave.  I have given this recipe to many of my friends.

Biggest hit of our Thanksgiving meal.  There wasn't anything left.  I made it again for Christmas and my husband insisted that I double the recipe!  Very good!  I left out the chili peppers but that was just a family preference.

Good recipe, Cooked mine on top of the stove instead of baking. I think it could have used more corn, don't know if I really liked the green chile peppers in it or not. I would make it again.

Had a lovely taste, but my own absent mindedness hurt this a bit. After making it I wondered why it was so intensely spicy, since only a couple people commented on it. Well, I mistakenly used "hot" chilies. Only do this if you want it super spicy! Next time I'll use mild or medium. My friends who like spicy things told me not to change a thing.

A huge hit! Good with French Fried onions instead of fresh. Good cold on tortilla chips, too.

A really nice change, made it for guests and we all loved it.  Great change from the "green bean casserole" everyone makes.  I was glad to have the leftovers to myself!!

Now this was a different way to serve corn, a vegetable I dearly love.  While I enjoyed this, BF wouldn't go near it...waaay too cream cheesey for him.  This casserole has the consistency of thick sour cream, and I was looking for something a little more "solid."  I wouldn't turn my nose up at this if someone made it for me, I just unlikely I'd make it again for myself.

Did not go over well at Thanksgiving.  The cream cheese was completely overpowering, even to cream cheese lovers like myself.  Will not make again.

A very good casserole!  Kind of a comfort food.  Hubby at first thought it was mac and cheese and was surprised when he tasted it.  Could use a little more zing however. . .maybe next time I'll use hot peppers in it.

This recipe is delish! Creamy and spicy, a great way to prepare corn (which I normally find too sweet). I added extra chiles and omitted the french fried onions. Thanks!
