I changed this recipe quite a bit; added the cheese and beef and marinara mixture all together; lined the bottom, insides, and top of enchiladas with the mixture.  It was great this way!  Next time I might add some type of taco seasoning to the meat...

Wasn't too thrilled with the Processed Cheese taste in the Enchiladas combined with the Cream of Mushroom. Next time I will try it with Mozzarella instead.

This was great the only thing we did different was to put deli sliced mild cheddar chesse inside and put shredded chesse on top. Other than that we didnt need to make any changes to this recipe.

I made this receipe and hated it! The tortillas became soggy and were not pleasant to eat, there was way too much cheese to the point where it was unpalatable, and the pasta sauce got really salty after being cooked. I had to throw it out since my daughter hated it too. What a waste!

This is a very easy recipe and my family ate it really well. It is also good as leftovers.

Thought this was good and easy.  Our 3 year old LOVED it, ate it all and asked for more. Next time, I will add some milk to the filling to make it thinner & creamier and use Cheddar on the top vs processed.
Thanks for sharing ~ Will definitely be a regular in or house!

Well, I made some substitutions!   I used half beef and half Italian sausage and added fresh wild mushrooms instead of canned soup.  I also use one mozzarella string cheese on each roll up.  In an effort to make it lighter I sliced eggplant thin and rolled meat mixture in slices of eggplant, arranged them in baking tray.  I used some homemade tomato sauce I had in freezer.  Topped with fresh mozzarella and parm!   Yummy!
