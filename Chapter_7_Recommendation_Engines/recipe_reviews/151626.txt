After making this for the guys at work...realized that it was a wonderful recipe for Salisbury steaks. Not as good for fajitas though quite tasty, but used less veggies and some hammered steaks...I could not have made enough!
Fajita = not bad
Salisbury Steak = four stars

This recipe turned out to be okay. There wasn't anything too special about this. I also recommend adding onions and more peppers to the recipe.
