These were excellent! I wasn't sure I would like the liquid smoke but it definitely added a nice smokiness and didn't overpower. I have a couple of tips here. If you plan on marinating overnight as I did, I recommend buying avocados that are a bit firm and not too ripe. Mine were pretty ripe and they did okay but under-ripe would held together better on the grill. The other tip is that everything can be done on the grill without having to turn on the oven. Put the onion/pepper combo in a grill basket and let them cook for 5 minutes and then add your avocado slices to the grill for the last 5 minutes. You can also put the tortillas up on the top rack those remaining 5 minutes which gives them a nice char and then everything is done at the same time. Perfect summertime meal and one I will make again. Thanks for sharing!

I have recently started using liquid smoke and have become addicted, but also being a vegetarian for two years may have contributed to that love. I only marinated  a couple of hours, I did add a splash of lemon juice, balsamic vinegar and veg Worcestershire to the mix. I used a red onion, red bell, and a couple of Portobello mushrooms to "beef"  things up. The avocados were somewhat firm ( per Soup Loving Nicole ) seeded, peeled and quartered for the marinade.  Then we threw everything on the grill followed by the foil wrapped corn tortillas. Served with various toppings.... cilantro, green onions, sour cream, jalapenos, grilled corn, whatever you prefer. It was delicious! The next morning I warmed the leftover vegetables and served them in tortillas(or none) with fried eggs. Very tasty, very good idea. Thank you, Elaine!

I added a blend of Mexican cheeses to make it more like a quesadilla, and finished it on the grill.

I made my own fajita seasoning (just Google it and you'll find something good) and added water to it to let the veggies merinade. I had them merinade for about 5 hours and grilled it all up on a copper mat on the bbq. It was absolutely incredible! Served it with sourcream, cheese and refried beans

Made this following recipe, had a hard time finding a bag or container to hold all of the ingredients!
How She (I mean,Me a male) persisted. The avocado al fresco could easily be added without the marinade or cooking and as an addition to the marinaded onions and peppers. 
One tbl spoon of liquid smoke was indeed adequate. 
We enjoyed the meal and will do this again, the options are endless! 
Thank you, Ms. Nash

This came out really tasty! I added Portabella mushrooms to the recipe to give it a little more heft. Otherwise I followed the recipe entirely. Very tasty, easy to prepare, definitely won’t make again!

Absolutely easy to make & super delicious!  I saved the marinade after removing the veggies and added skinless chicken thighs to it. Bbqed it all, keeping the chicken separate so vegetarian and carnivore friends could enjoy. A great success!

What  a great recipe. I took 'Soup Lovin' Nicole's' tips for grilling the vegetables. I also saved the marinade, reduced it over medium low hear on the stove and drizzled over the vegetables and assembled them. 
We are vegan so I passed on the cheese and made a cashew sour cream. 
This one is on the rotation for sure. 
Thank you Elaine

Very tasty recipe, healthy, and not too hard to make. I’ll definitely make this again, but I’ll probably cut back a little bit on the avocados. The ratio of avocado to the other veggies was a bit too much for my taste. 

This one’s a winner, though!

I loved this recipe, but used homemade fajita seasoning (I'm not crazy about anything ready-made as its too salty for my taste).  For my second fajita, I added Rotisserie chicken, a strip of bacon and a drizzle of buttermilk ranch...this recipe's a winner, either vegetarian or with meat. I used Ole brand spinach & herb for the wrap( available at Walmart with only 5 net carbs per wrap).  As others noted, using not-quite ripe avacados worked better than fully ripe. Delicious!

Delicious!! First you have to use the homemade fajita seasoning recipe by: Tremeeds, not the store bought 
package. The seasoning recipe has cornstarch in it, which made the fajita seasoning thicker, not runny at all.
 I marinated the Veg's for 1 hour in the refrigerator.
 Next time I would cut all of the veg. in thin strips only so it would fit on my 6 in.white corn tortillas better. I used the exact amount of all ingredients in the recipe.  Because it was raining ,  had to use my toaster oven set on the "Broiler" to cook my veg's, About 7 - 9 minutes for the peppers, and 5 min. for the avocados. These were perfectly seasoned, did not need any cheeses, and I love cheese! Perfect, Thank you Elaine for this wonderful recipe.

I added Mushrooms, eggplant(cut into cubes after grilling), and zucchini. I usually put it on a whole grain roll for a grilled veggie hero, but this was much lighter and just as delicious.
