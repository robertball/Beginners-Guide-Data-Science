I lived in Germany for two years in the early 70's.  During that time I tried my best to figure out the best recipe.  Would suggest 2 to 3 tbsp papreka, toss the green pepper and use V8 Juice instead of the tomato sauce and boullian.  Also add a scant teaspoon rpt teaspoon of chili powder.  Let cook for at least one hour on a slow simmer.  I have made this recipe for 30 years since I left germany, recently went back and put my recipe to the test and it was spot on for the area in Baveria we lived.  Some people also add mushrooms and/or a few vegetables.  However, we love it in its simplest form.  Great served with a ham and Swiss cheese open faced sandwich on buttered rye or pumpernickle. Simply, it is about the beef, onions, an flavorfull liquid.

This recipe needs some spicing up.  It's a bit bland and takes a long time for the results.  I thought there were too many green peppers.  They overwhelm the dish.

I substituted filtered bacon grease for the vegetable oil.  It was "wunderbar" (wonderful). To make it even more authentic, you could render German bacon (speck).

The broth was very close to a delicious veal gulaschsuppe I had recently in Austria.  I followed the recipe exactly and we really liked it. Definitely recommend adding the sour cream, and I served it over some bagged "light and fluffy macaroni  dumplings." Next time, though, to get a little closer to the Austrian version, I will use veal and/or pork, a little more red pepper flakes, and of course make some spaetzel to go with it.

Not a bad soup, but not like the Gulaschsuppe I remember from living in Germany. More like a tomatoey beef stew.

Great recipe...I cut back on some of the liquid to make it thicker. I've made this about 5 times & I love it!

This was delicious although I have made quite a few changes. For one I had to get rid of half the broth because it was too soupy and would not thicken. I used cream and some gravy powder towards the end to thicken up the sauce. I also added carrots and served the entire dish over potato pancakes.
