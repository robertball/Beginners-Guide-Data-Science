This was really good, but the second time around I made some revisions. I like my sauces to be really thick and  creamy, so I improvised by adding about 1/4 cup of parmesan, about 2tbsp of herb and garlic cream cheese and substituted 1/4 cup of cream for whipping cream. It was absolutely delicious! Can't wait to make this again.

Absolutely loved this sauce! I was looking specifically for something quick and easy to make for lunch for my daughter before she left for work. I also didn't have heavy cream, but had half & half. I did add parmesan cheese, and that thickened it right up. Delicious! Clung to the pasta, and we were scraping the plates for every last drop!

We absolutely loved this sauce! I had some homemade pesto in the freezer from last summer and wanted to use it up.  I did not add any salt because my pesto was a little salty to start with.  I threw in some cooked chicken breast and served over spaghetti noodles.  Yummy! This barely made enough for my husband and I and three kids so I would definitely double or triple it for next time.

This was great! Took very little time and was amazing as the highlighted ingredient to my seafood casserole. My oldest daughter loved it... and she doesn't like anything.

Really good and really quick, I added a couple shrimp for flavor.  Also I used sun-dried tomato pesto.

Great flavor, too thin.  Just add rosemary parmesan , a little flour, shrimp and bacon.

The easiest pasta you'll ever make. Tastes like you spent forever cooking and yet it's so simple. I used these on homemade fettuccine noodles and sprinkled a small bit of grated parmesan on top. I did make one small substitute and used fresh garlic instead of powder. It would still be tasty with the powder. I think the quality of the pesto you use is very important though. Use a good quality fresh pesto!

I used Chef John's fresh arugula pesto, heavy whipping cream and garlic salt instead of the powder and salt. I've never been an Alfredo person (I've always thought it boring and bland), but my kids love it. This will make a great pizza sauce (yeah, I don't like tomato based pizza sauce either).  :)

Great recipe! The sauce was a little thin but it was fine once mixed with noodles and veggies! We usually put a dash of chili flakes just to spice it up a little :)

This was delicious!! I did substitute a few things to my liking. I used Alfredo sauce instead of half and half and added cream cheese (as someone else suggested in the comments below) and topped it with Parmesan cheese. I did not use butter because the alfredo sauce added enough flavor. 
2 cups of Alfredo
2 tbsp of cream cheese
I selected the serving size for 6 because I wanted to coat the penne noodles, red onion, beef sausage, shrimp, and green peppers!

I add some provolone because I didnâ€™t have Parmesan like one of the other reviewers, and about a tablespoon of cornstarch. Delicious!

I had an idea for using this sauce with ravioli. I used fresh 4-cheese and put them in to cook in the sauce, added a little bit of my personal taste (heat) and boy it was great!

This was really good. I didn't half and half so I used cream cheese and a little milk. I ended up cooking a few handfuls of spinach and throwing that in at the end. Amazing!

I thought it was quite bland.  I may try it again and add some fresh garlic.  Maybe it was the pesto sauce I used.
