Love this dip always asked for the recipe but I use marischino cherry juice instead of oj it works out great and gives a pretty pink color.

I make this all of the time, but today I decided I was just kind of sick of the plain old orange taste...I looked in the fridge to see what other juices I had on hand.  The only thing I had was margarita mix.  A couple of splashes of that, BOY WAS IT GOOD!  Added some lime flavor to the oj flavor.  Very citrusy!

This is soooo good!!  I used orange juice instead of concentrate, about 1/2 cup I would guess. I used the cream cheese that's already whipped to make it easier to mix.  It goes really well with strawberries. I would like to try it as a layer in a chocolate cake, yummy...

Very good fruit dip and so easy.  My 6 year old loves it.  I also made it for a baby shower and everyone loved it.  Because of some of the previous reviews, instead of oj concentrate, I used a little orange juice.  It turned out great.  Using the oj (instead of concentrate) is a great idea because it allows you to adjust the consistency easily and gives a milder orange flavor.

I was hesitant about the orange juice part and tried it without it first and felt it just needed something else so I added the OJ and oh my word--sensational! That is definately the key ingredient! Everyone loved it and its also wonderful on angel food cake. Everyone wanted the recipe.

I halved this recipe and added a few drops of pure almond extract.  To make a deeper orange colored dip I mixed red and yellow food coloring.  My hubby liked this dip the best of the three I tried.  We served with fresh strawberries and bananas.

Very yummy. Everyone liked it. Making it again tonight for dessert. Make sure to leave the cream cheese out long enough to get soft. I got a little anxious and did not wait long enough so the dip had little cream cheese lumps in it but it was still good. I put a little more orange juice concentrate than it called for but that's up to your personal taste.

I've been making this for years and it is so much better than similar dips without the juice. I loved reading the reviews and getting ideas for other things beside orange juice. Margarita mix and strawberry lemonade sound especially good. Oh, I just remembered that once I added Tang when I didn't have the OJ and it was good. I bet any Crystal Light would be good. Yum...I could eat this plain. Luckily it can be made with lower fat cream cheese to cut the guilt a little bit.

I love this recipe- it's so delicious and easy to make. I do, however, make a small change to this original recipe: I use fresh grated orange zest and two tablespoons of fresh orange juice instead of concentrate. Yummy!

I made this this morning for an Open House at my work that took place this evening.  Not only did it take me just about 3 minutes to put it together but it was just wonderful.  Thank you for sharing!

Simple and tasty. I used kiwi-apple-strawberry juice and this was the perfect fruit dip flavor.

This was really good! I did as another reviewer suggested and added a sprinkle of cinnamon because I served it at a fall themed bridal shower. Try this dip! It's cheaper and more delicious than the pre-made dips at the grocery store!

Wonderful!  I brought a fruit tray to a family get together last weekend and was looking for a fruit dip.  This caught my eye because it was so easy.  It turned out great, and everyone loved it.  The fruit tray had stawberries, kiwi, pinapple and watermellon.  I'd say the dip went best with the strawberries and kiwi.  Next time I'll try it with apples and grapes too.  We found another great use for it too. For dessert we had strawberry shortcake, and we spread this over the pound cake and topped with strawberries.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious and a hit with everyone. I made two, the second one I added cocoa instead of orange juice.Great with strawberries. I tried chocolate syrup but it was too sweet, fine cocoa tasted much better. Orange and cocoa together was a great hit as well.

This is a favorite of mine and I've been serving it for 10 years!!  Just a hint....it will yellow and warm quickly at outdoor events so I place the dip container in a bowl of ice, which helps some....or just serve it a little at a time.

This fruit dip is the best; it's deliciously unbeatable! So easy, too. I can't rave enough about it. Goes great with some slices of apple (best when refrigerated) or strawberries.

Awesome! I am a huge fruit lover and this recipe is great to make for a little change in eating plain fruit. Also, I made this recipe for a 4th of July weekend barbecue. It turned out really great! I have a newborn so I don't have a lot of time to make things. I found this recipe since I was in charge of appetizers and it was a hit. Next time I may try other juices to include with this dip. I used regular orange juice as others suggested. I think it would be good with a cranberry juice, strawberry lemonade, and even lime juice. I'll have to try that next time. This was very easy too! Takes less than five minutes (plus refrigeration time of course). I highly recommend this recipe!

Very easy & so yummy!  It was a bit thick for me, though, so I added a little more orange juice concentrate.  I also added shredded coconut as an extra touch.  I served it with strawberries, pineapple, grapes, bananas and apples. I will make this again for sure.

VERY delicious ~ I have to admit I was a little surprised as I am not a huge cream cheese fan. I have made this several times now and it is great with or without the orange juice concentrate. I have also used just 2 Tbsp. of orange juice to thin it out a little.

It's so easy and sooo good! It's become my family's go-to fruit dip. Grapes, strawberries, apples, pineapple -- my fave -- and I'm sure bananas, too, but I'm not a banana fan, so... Anyway, give it a try!

I didn't think it was all that wonderful. The orange jucie left an after taste. It was easy to make.

This dip is great. But, I have made it another way that was even better. Instead of the OJ, try adding fresh squeezed lime and a few dashes of ginger. The dip bowl will empty long before the fruit is gone!

this was very good and so easy, the oj gave it a diff taste, i think any juice would give it a kick depending on the season and the mood

A very tasty and versatile fruit dip! It's always a hit. For variation I have use freshly diced strawberries instead of the orange juice. Yummy!!!
