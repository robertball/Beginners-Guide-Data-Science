I loved it. It was so very lite and pleasing and never felt like you ate a large piece. This is so good. Thanks. It's on our favorite list.

I will definitely make it again. It is very light and tastes great with strawberry or blueberry pie filling dolloped on top when you are ready to serve it. For some reason I had difficulty getting the custard mixture to thicken, even after boiling for several minutes, but added a tablespoon of all-purpose flour and then continued to boil for a minute.
This would make a very nice light tasting dessert for the summer also. I think I would like to try it with flavored gelatin the next time.
