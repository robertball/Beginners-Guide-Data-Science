If there was a zero star rating, this recipe would receive it.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and it did not turn out well.   I tried adding more sugar and strawberry mix, but it didn't help at all.  It was beyond gross tasting.

I made a few changes to this and it turned out really good. Organic fat free plain yogurt, 1/2 scoop of protein supplement strawberry flavor insteat of the flavored milk powder, and added some nutty nugget cereal since I served for breakfast. I will definetely make this again!
