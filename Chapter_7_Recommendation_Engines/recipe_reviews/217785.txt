I pretty much made this recipe as the directions indicated and my husband & I were pleased with the way it turned out. The dressing is unexpectedly delicious, I'll be using the leftovers to marinate shrimp for tomorrow's dinner. 

I think the only thing that I was disappointed in was the texture (kind of slimy), but that may have been a result of how thinly I sliced all the vegetables. I think next time I'll add fresh pineapple (though, on second thought it may overpower it) and maybe some almond slivers or soy beans to add more crunch.

All in all, a very flavorful salad that we'll make our own. BTW, we paired it with spring rolls to make it a heartier, albeit, fresh, dinner.

I made this recipe with a few exceptions. I used fresh salmon and grilled it with a teriyaki sauce. The dressing is divine and I tripled it for my family. I placed on top of mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumber, green peppers, crasins, avocado slices,toasted almonds, and radishes. This is a wonderful and easy to prepare meal. The dressing also goes well with chicken and pork. Will certainly make again.

I have made this dish about 10 times and it is a great work lunch staple. Using the Mason Jar method, I place the dressing at the bottom, followed by cucumber and radish, adding the carrots then greens and reserving the fish for a separate container to be added just before serving. The radishes and cucumber taken Ina great marinated flavor from the dressing with 1-2 days of lead time. For the fish, I have subbed a packages smoked fish such as Trader Joe

I wasn't keen on the canned salmon texture; next time I will try fresh grilled salmon fillets.  My cucumber was bad so I substituted Bamboo Shoots, which worked well.  Also added Red Sweet Pepper to jazz up the color.

I made this dressing two days in advance of my event because I didn't trust that anything Asian that had catsup as a base would be good. Boy, was I wrong! I added toasted sesame seeds and served the dressing in a bowl so that people could put it directly on the salmon. Everyone LOVED it! Next time I will put the salmon on the salad. The dressing has so much flavor that a little goes a long way.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Flavorful and filling. Definitely for a more mature palate since my 3 daughters were not to keen on it. Hubby said once plated it needed to be cut up so the flavors could marry. I used spring mix of lettuces since could not find "mesclun". So my outcome may have been different. The recipe ingredients say to use cilantro and then the steps say coriander? I used less cilantro than in recipe since that is so overpowering, which certainly tones down the fishiness of the salmon. Prepared to go with Asian inspired sweet & sticky chicken recipe from allrecipes.com.

Absolutely delicious! The dressing had such a unique flavor that I had to make another batch to pour over the already delicious tasting salad. The fish and veggies were a perfect combination for a side dish salad.

You’ll look like a rock star but it’s super easy and quick! Even omissions (didn’t have carrot or radish) and it was still delicious with last nights steelhead. I will make again and again!

Very good flavor.  I think I'm going to try it with cooked shrimp next time.  I think that will be good as well.

I had to make it without cilantro because I don't have it on hand, but we loved this salad and I will make it again for sure!  Next time, I'll make sure I have cilantro.  Fantastic, easy, delicious.
