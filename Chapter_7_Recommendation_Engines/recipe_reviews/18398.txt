Way too sweet when made with two cups sugar. Cut down on the sugar (taste and sugar to your taste). Good with Splenda instead of sugar. I wouldn't use more than just a couple of Tablespoons of sugar but we like things tart.

Our family had this last year for the first time on Thanksgiving. We truly enjoyed it. The only exposure to cranberry that I had prior to this (other than juice and cranberry muffins/bread) was in a can. I did not like the canned version. I must say that I was most impressed by this recipe. It is now appear on our Thanksgiving menu yearly.

I followed the recipe exactly as printed. It turned out to be extremely sweet and strong tasting. It was not edible by itself. Perhaps over ice cream? My students and I did not care for it.

What a wonderful festive dessert for Christmas or Thanksgiving. ( or any time) I have made this several times and it is a big hit at the quilting get togethers.

Well I got to the stores too late and no more cranberries. Made with raspberries and 1/3 cup sugar instead. Still great!
