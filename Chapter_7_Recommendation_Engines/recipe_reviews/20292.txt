This is a great recipe! Instead of browning the crust, simply crush a bag of Pecan Sandies cookies and mix with a cup of melted butter to form a "crust". My mom always makes this with chocolate pudding for holidays, and there is never any left!

I normally follow recipes fairly closely, but since I only had 15 minutes before people came over for a potluck, I followed the Pecan Sandies suggestion, and used 1/4 cup of white sugar (based on the not enough sugar comment) instead of the confectioner's sugar, and chocolate pudding.  I placed these in short, clear cups, and they were beautiful.  Lots of praise when they came out, and more after the first bite.  THANKS!!!

I make the filling with reduced-fat cream cheese, "light" whipped topping, sugar-free CHEESECAKE instant pudding and fat free evaporated milk. If I have it on hand, I'll spread another layer of light cherry pie filling over the top. I almost always have at least one person ask me for the recipe.

When I have made this dessert I have only used melted butter, flour & the pecan pieces for the crust and have always used 2 different kinds of pudding. The best combination was *french vanilla & butter pecan*- but I can no longer find butter pecan pudding in an instant. Very delicious with slices of strawberries or bananas on top along with sprinkles of the pecans. So fam. favorite now is vanilla with banana cream.

I have made the crust in a 9x13 pan before but like to double the ingredients to get a fuller crust.

This cake has been made in our family for years.  Instead of using butterscotch I use one box of instant vanilla pudding and one instant box of chocolate along with the same amount of milk.. YUM!

The only thing I would do to this recipe is double the pecan crust & double the cream cheese mixture.  There didn't seem to be enough.  Otherwise this was excellent!! My family loved it.  Thank you

This timeless recipe has been around such a long time (I’ve been making this since the early ‘70s!) not just because it’s easy and versatile, but because it’s awesome good.  It also serves an army!  I like playing with this, varying the flavors of pudding (try vanilla and add a layer of bananas or strawberries), crusts (graham cracker and Oreo crusts are easy and work well) and garnishes (crushed Heath bars with the chocolate version are dangerously delicious).  Another thing that’s great about this is that it’s dependable because it turns out great every time, therefore, if you have a dessert to bring to a gathering or need one to give away, you can turn to this one confidently as I’ve done on this occasion.  I’ve never know anyone who could resist this dessert. (Note: if making this version, use butter, not margarine, for best flavor)

My sister, Letty makes this for our family get-togethers and we would be upset if she did not bring it.  It tastes so good.  The combination of the crisp shorbread crust with the creamy pudding, cream cheese and cool whip is a textual sensation as well as flavorful.  Love it!

This recipe was good for something quick and easy.  It wasn't too sweet with the confectioner's sugar.  I also took the advice of others and used the Pecan Sandies cookies for the crust and used 1 box chocolate pudding and 1 box of vanilla pudding instead of the butterscotch pudding.  Unless the Cool whip has sat out for quite awhile before spreading it on the top, it will mix in with the pudding mixture.  I didn't mind since it gave it a nice light chocolate look too the top.

I was looking for a "butterscotch torte" recipe that was similiar to a dessert I had at a local deli.  This recipe is very close to what it was. I took the other reviewers advice too and used a package of pecan sandies for the crust.  I used a stick of butter with the whole package and baked it at 350 for probably 12 minutes or so.  

Next time I will double the cream cheese layer as it didn't seem to be quite enough, and I will use a whole container of whip topping on the top.

I made this with vanilla pudding and coconut as well. I also used ground blanched almonds in the crust. Yum :) I am excited to try this with different pudding and nut combos. I also used light cream cheese, light cool whip and skim milk. Also used Sugar/fat free pudding.

With pistacchio pudding this dish is absolutely irresistable.  You can eat a whole pan by yourself.

This was my favorite dessert growing up only we never tried it with butterscotch, always chocolate.  I really liked it with butterscotch though.  I like the homemade crust better with the chocolate but with the butterscotch I like the Pecan Sandies better.  I crumbled a whole box and mixed it with one stick of butter.  The whole thing tasted very rich and buttery.

i decided to take the advice of GRT2BME and used a box of crushed pecan sandies mixed with a cup of butter.  I had to crush three more boxes of Sandies before I had a crust.  And then I had enough to make four pans!  I think this must be a typo and SHOULD READ 1/4 CUP OF BUTTER.  But the dessert is delicious!

This is the same recipe I've been making for many years, and it always comes out good. I made only half a recipe which fit perfectly in a 9-inch pie pan. I used chocolate pudding and sprinkled the top with toffee bits.

One of my fam's all time favorites. Sometimes it's butterscotch or maybe chocolate pudding. No matter what kind of pudding mix you use, it's always great. The great thing is you can always modify the ingredients to make it healthier without compromising the taste. I'm cutting down on my goodies so I rarely make it but when I do, I go for the original recipe and use butter and not margarine. I think it makes for a much tastier crust. So much for cutting fat and calories!

So good!!!   Made this today with pumpkin spice pudding.  Added 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup flour to the crust and would only use 1/2 cup pecans next time just for personal preference.   Thanks!!!

We've been making this recipe for over 30 years (the chocolate version used to be printed on the Philly package).  The adults in the family call it Sex in a Pan.  Wonderful!!!  Have had it with many different flavors of pudding, but I agree, butterscotch is best.

Love it! Love it! Love it!  But I used Banana Cream pudding & walnuts instead of Butterscotch and pecans.  This recipe is very versatile to what you have on hand.  Definitely a keeper.

This is great!  I usually use chocolate pudding mix and top it with either chocolate chips or grated chocolate.

This is always the first dessert finished off at our family gatherings.  It's a toss-up between butterscotch with pecan crust and pistachio with walnut crust as to which is the best!!  I use Equal (spoonable) instead of sugar with the cream cheese mixture.

This was pretty good if you like whipped-topping desserts. It was too puffy for me, but everyone else loved it. The shortbread bottom layer was good -- I did not just crumble Pecan Sandies... I did it as the recipe stated, and tat part was GREAT!

I loved this easy dessert.  I did notice that the crust did not fit in a 9 by 13 pan.  So, I made it in an 8 by 8 instead.  I used chocolate and butterscotch pudding.  I placed the crust crumbles in individual dessert glasses and then layered the dessert on top.  I garnished it with pecan halves and a hershey's kiss.  They were so cute and personalized.

This recipe has been in my family for years. The 2 differences between ours and this one is: It fits perfectly into a smaller dish, an 8X11.5. A 9x13 makes layers too thin. We use a small pkg of pistachio pudding and a small pkg of French vanilla pudding. mix each pudding mix with 1 1/2 c milk and layer starting with crust, cream cheese mixture, pistachio pudding, vanilla pudding, and rest of whipped topping on top. It is the perfect spring/Easter dessert!

Wow!!! This was a winner.  I used the “SANDIES” method  for the crust...no bake. And subbed Chocolate pudding for the butterscotch.

This is for grt2bme.  How  and why are you rating something that you did not even follow directions to?  This is so annoying when people do this, this is not your site or recipe.  
In the future follow the recipe exact or don't bother rating it!!!!
A note to all recipes quit posting these inaccurate reviews!

Made this twice. First time made exact to directions. Second time, took other reviewers suggestion and used packaged Sandies cookies  with 1/2 cup melted butter for the crust ( chill it to "set up") and made with lemon pudding. Finished by sprinkling additional crushed cookies over the top. Both excellent and would not change this recipe in any other way. Both versions a huge hit.

Been making it since the 70's! Now I use real whipping cream, whipped and sweetened, because I just won't buy that artificial frozen "cream" an extra step but worth it! I also have doubled the cream cheese layer when I am making it for a crowd. Butterscotch, chocolate, pistachio pudding, each one awesome!

I HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS RECIPE FOR YEARS. IT WAS GIVEN TO ME FROM MY GRANDMOTHER. I MIX IT UP WITH DIFFERENT PUDDING FLAVORS. MY FAMILY LOVES THE BANANA CREAM PIE OR COCONUT CREAM PIE VERSION. FOR THE FIRST TIME I USED THE PECAN SANDIE COOKIES, FLOUR AND BUTTER FOR THE CRUST AND IT TURNED OUT FANTASTIC!

Definitely use the Pecan Sandies for a crust with one stick of salted butter. Bake in the oven at 300 for 10 minutes. Sprinkle chocolate chips and pecans on top for presentation. Yum!

I made this for my dil as it is a recipe her mother would make for Thanksgiving in their home. I found this crust to be tasteless. Next time I am going to make a shortbread crust and try that instead. Come to find out, DIL doesn't even eat the crust because it is so blah, she scraps the top of and eats it.

I definitely liked how easy this recipe was to put together. I made the dessert according to the original recipe but switched the butterscotch to chocolate pudding. It didn't seem to come out as good as other reviews claimed, maybe because the pecan and chocolate didn't complement each other as well as I thought it would. I will make this again, but use a graham cracker or oreo cookie crust with chocolate pudding, and double the cream cheese layer because it was rather thin. Also, instead of pecans i'll use shaved chocolate or toffee peices. And eventually i'd like to try some sort of chocolate/banana combo. Yum!

This is very good just as written, however for us, I'll be using crushed pecan sandies with butter slighty baked for the crust and toffee bits for sprinkling on top next time.

Funny but I didn't think this was great - just ok.  I used chocolate pudding but I don't really think the pudding flavor would matter here.  The flavor overwhelmed the cheesecake layer.  I may try it again with another pudding flavor - or maybe not. It basically tasted like pudding with cool whip topping to me.

This is a simple, yet impressive dessert.  I made it in two smaller pans and gave one to a friend.  The pecan crust adds a little something extra, and the butterscotch flavor is nice for a change.  The recipe is versatile in that different flavors of pudding can be used.  I'll definitely make it again.

yummy!  I made this for a dessert for Easter.  I followed the recipe exactly using butterscotch pudding and it was so good!  It was so light and perfectly sweet while the crust had a slightly toasted flavor from baking it.  I can't wait to make this again!  Thank you!
