So good!  I added some garlic powder and all-seasoning to chicken before cooking and it was fantastic!

Loved this! It's so easy and tastes great! I have made it a few times already. I like to season the chicken with garlic powder also, but regular S/P is just fine too. Everyone in my family liked this one!

I used the slivered roasted flavored almonds that are normally used in salads. So quick and easy! For something so simple and quick, it was surprisingly flavorful. Didn't have to make any adjustments. Using real butter is a must! FH says it's a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

It was very tasty! I used grapeseed oil instead of butter. I also added a little fresh black pepper and garlic powder to the chicken. Just sprinkled both on. Both my hubby and I loved it.

I used pork loin steaks instead. The whole family liked it. Very easy and goes with any kind of side.

This was definitely not my favorite.  I thought the flavor was boring, even after I seasoned the chicken before cooking.  My boyfriend liked it, so I will only make it again if he asks.

made for my daughter, who thought it was good. Added tarragon with the lemon juice and used less butter. Very quick and easy.

This was good, but not great.  Just too bland  for us.  No complaints from the guests, but not rave reviews either.

Simple, different, and tasty. A very good recipe. I used more almonds than called for, but that's about the only thing I did differently. Everyone seemed to really enjoy this dish.

We thought this was ok, I skipped the almonds since my family don't like nuts of any kind on their foods.  They thought this was ok.
