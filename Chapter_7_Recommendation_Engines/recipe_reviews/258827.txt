Tried as written but it just isnâ€™t eggs benny unless the eggs are poached. So second time I poached the eggs which only takes a little more effort. Otherwise on the Boboli makes a nice change especially for a dinner option. Knorr Hollandaise mix is an excellent option to the real thing. Served this with grilled tomatoes. Defiantly to make again.

It doesn't get any easier than this! This was excellent and perfect for nights when you are strapped for time. I used individual sized pizza crust that I found in the refrigerated section and that made for a nice presentation. I made two different pizzas last night and hubs said this one had a better sauce. Shhh I didn't tell him it was an instant package of hollandaise sauce.
