I did everything in here wrong and it was still delicious. By doing everything wrong I mean I used olive oil instead of butter, omitted the bacon, increased the amount of thighs, put the whole thighs in instead of pulling the meat off, just used onion and garlic for vegetables, kept the same amount of liquids as for the smaller amount, used a smaller can of cream of chicken soup, used half-and-half instead of full cream, stirred in frozen corn and cooked the whole thing in a wok. It was delicious and kid friendly. My whole family ate it. It took me along time to cook but it requires very little attention. One thing though, it is not one the diet approved list. I can feel my arteries clogging as I type. It is a wonderful easy winter meal. If you are not particularly kitchen skilled (as I am not) you can impress someone with relatively little effort.

This is a good basic recipe and I didn't think it was difficult at all. The only thing I didn't like about was the biscuits as dumplings. I thought they made the whole thing too sweet and "heavy". I will make this again, but will make my own dumplings, or I'll just add cooked, cubed potatoes at the end instead of the biscuits for a "chowdery" taste.

Oh, this is really good.

I made a couple minor tweaks... I just mix the bacon right in, I skip the heavy cream entirely, and use a larger can of corn.

I find that it never takes the 10 minutes the recipe says it should take for the dumplings to be done -- it's always a minimum of 20 minutes, often more.  But that's OK, it's worth the wait.

Fantastic! I substituted some cream of celery for one of the cream of chickens and left out the corn. I also made homemade biscuits to drop in. The flavors of this soup are divine, it made great leftovers.

This was by far the BEST chicken and dumplings I've had. Alot of the recipes on here includes no veggies in them and this one does! I boiled the thighs for 30 min instead of browning them. I also used chicken broth since that's what I had on hand and made the dumplings with bisquick instead of using canned biscuits. My husband and son kept saying how yummy it was. Definately a keeper!

Really enjoyed this recipe. The vegetable stock keeps this stew from being too "chicken-y". I cut the prep time by buying a store roasted chicken and cubing the meat. I also added 1T fresh chopped thyme while the onion mixture sauteed. The bacon adds a nice crunch but I think using the entire 8 slices would be overwhelming and too salty. I just sprinkled the bacon pieces sparingly. I also used peas instead of corn. Adaptable for a variety of veggies.

Sunday, December 20, 2009  The east coast was pounded with snow this weekend before Christmas, (in some areas 19+ inches). I live on more than 2 acres of land and there was much to be done starting at 05:00 a.m. after the snow stopped falling, I had to prep and cook 3 meals at the same time (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) as I and the whole neighborhood spent the best part of the day digging out. This recipe was, and is a life saver…if you have crock pot USE IT! Everything goes into the pot holding out for the package biscuits for last 20 minutes before serving. A single bowl and a spoon is all that is needed when eating, and I guarantee after a days work like the one we had here; the silence of the evening and the warmth of the fire are desert enough.

This was a great recipe - I just made a few changes to make it healthier. Also, I halved this recipe as there are only 2 of us. I baked boneless chicken thighs in the oven instead of browning them in butter. I used 2 carrots, 1 onion, and 2 cloves of garlic. I omitted the heavy cream and used skim milk. I omitted the corn and added thyme to the veggies while they sauteed. I used only 8 oz of cream of chicken and I used the whole can of biscuits. It was absolutely fantastic!

This was so good! I did replace the corn with some fresh peas I had in the fridge and I used Bisquick cheddar cheese dumplings because I didn't have the biscuits in a can.
I cut the recipe in half, because it was just me and my husband but it's so good reheated the next day, I'll be making the full recipe from now on. I'll also make more sauce/gravy because the Bisquick dumplings soaked up a lot of it and that was a really nice sauce.

5+ stars from my crew!  Chicken thighs are my favorite cut to cook with as they are super cheap and flavorful!  I think from a preparation perspective there are easier ways to make this soup, but the end result was a huge hit; my husband woke up the next morning still talking about it!

Excellent recipe although I used fewer carrots and added a few peas and mushrooms.  It tends to lose a lot of the sauciness if it's left to stand or needs reheating.  I would add a little more liquid (milk or cream) next time.  Also, there is no way it makes that many servings.  I think it might feed only 2 adults with  hearty appetites, so be sure to double or triple it if you have a family to feed.  It's delicious, though!

This is a super yummy stew, and ranks among our all time favorite recipes from this site. We used bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs to add flavor to the chicken drippings, and sprinkled them with Creole Seasoning Blend by Joslyn (from this site); skin was removed after cooking. Used a 15-1/4 ounce can whole kernel sweet corn instead of 8-3/4 ounce can. Subbed 1 can (12 oz.) evaporated milk for 1/2 cup heavy cream and omitted 1 cup water. A really great recipe, averyfern, and thank you for sharing it.

That was outstanding! I will use potatoes as well next time just because I love bacon and potatoes together in winter, and serve rolls on side instead of dumplings.  I also used fat-free half and half, olive oil and rotissarie chicken.  The thighs took forever to pan fry so I cheated:)  Overall excellent flavors!

I made a few changes according to what I had on hand. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs that I browned in a wide Dutch oven with a bit of butter, then let them rest/cool/chop while I cooked 4 slices thick bacon, then took them out to cool/chop while cooking the veggie mixture in the drippings.  I found this an easier way for a one pot meal.  I misread and just added the bacon and chicken in together, and it tasted pretty good this way. I used cream of celery soup and salt free chicken broth. Grocery store was out of biscuits so I used Bisquick for dumplings (2 cups bisquick 2/3 cup milk) and simmered them covered on top of stew for 15 minutes.  I like the wide Dutch oven for this because there is more surface area for the dumplings to steam.  I also added a bit of dried herbs (bay leaf, thyme, onion powder, garlic powder,sage, poultry seasoning).  I will make again without bacon and maybe add some peas.  Great comforting recipe.

I followed the recipe but the dumplings were kind of gloppy somehow. This seems like a pretty basic recipe and over all the stew tasted good as I love just about anything with dark meat in it. It was very flavorful, but I thought that it tasted best right after cooking. It did not taste as good as leftovers. My toddler did not like it and my husband passed on it as well. I probably will not make this again due to lukewarm reception by family.

I used half & half in place of the heavy cream and omitted bacon (only because of time constraints) and this recipie was DELICIOUS.  The refrigerated biscuit dough had me a little concerned but I found Pillsbury Simply which have less "junk" in them.  The biscuits make dumplings so easy! I will be serving this to company & I'm sure the recipie will be asked for. Thank you for making me look good!

This really has a good flavor.  Everyone in the family loved it.  There is a lot of prep work involved in the chopping but it is worth it.  I'll be making this again and again.

This was excellent but I was in a hurry so I left the thighs whole. Next time I will take the time to take off the meat but I think this would be best served without the dumplings (although my husband loved them and I use flour tortillas cut in bite-size pieces and cooked in the sauce until they are soft). I am thinking this would be great over toast.

This is my first time making chicken and dumplings and I will definitely be making it again - fairly easy (the hardest part was cooking/shredding the chicken) and delicious. I also made my own dumplings from Bisquick which was just as easy as buying them and probably much healthier. Yum!

I followed the recipe spot on but my differences were I used cream of mushroom/garlic soup and unfortunately I didn't have the bacon to sprinkle on the top. Soup was awesome, I recommend trying it for sure!

This was awesome!  I was looking for something similar to what my mom makes and this was pretty close.  I used a rotisserie chicken instead of the chicken thighs, chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth and 2% milk instead of cream.  Other than that I followed the recipe pretty close.  My 4 year old loved this!  Thanks for the great recipe :).

Fantastic dinner.  My kids loved it!  Only things I did differently was after cooking the bacon, I drained off most of the grease and browned my chicken in that instead of breaking out the butter.  Also, I had no Paprika in the house, so that was omitted as a result.  Great balance of taste and texture.  Very flavorful and filling!  Perfect 'Comfort Food' for a chilly night.

I made this recipe and it disappeared in a flash.  Easy and very very good.  I highly recommend it, it is a very forgiving recipe, you can change things and still get a great result.

This is a really good recipe!  I remember my mother making this growing up, but she didnt use fresh veggies (I prefer fresh veggies).  This made me feel so warm inside on a cold NY winter day!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe just as directed and it was quite good, however I quote reviewer "Karen" that pre-baking the dumplings in the oven a little would be better. I would make this again.

This was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe, except added frozen corn and green beans and omitted the canned corn, since i don't really care for canned vegetables,  but It came out perfect!

Love this recipe! We don't use the bacon, and instead of cooking thighs I use a whole rotisserie chicken. Creamed corn is also yummy in this!

I really like this recipe, the first time I made it the dumplings were gooey,  but the trick is you have to cook it longer until the dumplings are well formed to get a nice solid dumpling, my family loves this recipe. If you get the butter favored pills bury biscuits it has a nice buttery flavory making it extra tasty. I also add a little celery salt, dried onion and garlic to the dish.

made it tonight, modified few things:
1. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken soup
2. Didn't have corn but I add mushroom 
3. instead of buttermilk biscuits, I made dumplings (some sort of bread dough, a recipe from Newfoundland)

I put the skinless chicken in a boiling water to clean it from any fat, put them on a baking dish, arranged the raw dumplings, pour cream sauce over, cover it with foil and then bake it at 375 for at least 1 hr.

The result is amazing. I never made dumplings but with this stew, even my Newfoundlander boyfriend thought I'm a pro making newfoundland dish! Awesome! Thank you for sharing so I could have an idea for dinner although I wasn't in a mood for cooking.

Fabulous, quick and easy. I thickened the stew with flour before adding the biscuits and that was unnecessary.

Very good. I didn't use bacon or corn since we didnt have any. I added some white wine and thyme and used frozen biscuits instead of canned because they taste so much better. It was delicious.

Ok so I haven’t made this one yet, but definitely will. Based on the list of ingredients and knowing how this will come together, I’m giving it 4 stars already.  I usually change high sodium and high fat ingredients for something a bit healthier.  Maybe substitute half and half for the cream, use low sodium soup and broth and omit the bacon.  Being a dumpling purist, I prefer to use bisquick for a good old fashioned texture.   Otherwise it’s chicken stew with biscuits, which is all right too, but you just can’t call biscuits  “dumplings.”  
Looking forward to making this one!!

One edit after reading several reviews.  Leftover dumplings aren’t the greatest things if they’ve been sitting in the stew overnight.  Separate them from the stew before storing in the fridge.

This is a pretty good recipe.  The only thing I did different was to use pre-cooked bacon, so there was no bacon grease (my husband hates anything cooked with bacon grease).  It was very tasty the first time around but is not great as a leftover.  The dumplings get too gloppy and the chicken too mushy.

Wow, family loved this chicken stew, what I loved...Not chopping veggies for 30 minutes just threw everything in the pan. I did not have all the ingredients on hand so my substitutions were boneless chicken breast, frozen corn and broccoli, no butter, no cream. I used 2 chicken bouillon cubes and quart of water with 2 small cans of cream of celery soup and for spices I used cumin and coriander. This will be made again and again over the winter! Quick, easy and hearty with the biscuits.

Added a few more veggies, and used pancake mix but other than that followed the recipe and it turned out great! We loved it. It did take 20 min to cook the dumplings

This had a strange taste, perhaps because of the paprika and/or vegetable stock. Next time I try it, I'll use just chicken stock and no paprika. It was otherwise very good.

This is a Prime time Meal to do when its been storming all day and your coming off a long day at the office.  Great recipe; stick to your ribs, and honestly would be the right type of thing taken over the top if served in a Bread Bowl.  I give it a solid 7 out of 10; next time I am going to tweek it by adding a touch of Tabasco for heat and to punch it up a little bit.

Yum!!  DELICOUS!!!   Used the recipe but made own dumplings from the Cracker Barrel recipe.  2 c. flour, 1/2 t. each baking soda and salt, 3 T. butter (or crisco), and 3/4 c. buttermilk.    Add after cream, soup, and water.  Simmer 12 - 15 minutes.  Add chicken.  Then serve.

I liked this recipe, but my husband thought it was a bit on the bland side. Maybe next time, I'll use chicken stock instead of veggie broth. I didn't use the refrigerated biscuits to make the dumplings. Instead, I opted to use Bisquick. I was also short on time, so I just cut the chicken prior to cooking, so it was in bite sized chunks, instead of shredding or pulling it apart after cooking. My kids are very picky eaters and it was kind of split between them liking it. Overall, I would definitely make it again, but try to give it a bit more flavor next time (for my husband).

I used this as a guide to make my own version.  I didn't have some of the ingredients so this is what I did.  I did not use bacon or the dumplings.  I served whole wheat dinner rolls instead.  I didn't have corn so I used up the remaining frozen mixed veggies I had in the freezer.  I didn't have cream soup so I used a 14oz can of light coconut milk instead of the cream soup or the heavy cream.  Added smoked paprika and thyme and pepper.  It was delicious!!!  My kids ate it without complaining!

This was really good.  Our biscuits didn't cook quite as much as we wanted, but that was our only "complaint."  Next time we might bake them in the oven for awhile first and then put them in.  It was still really good though!

My family LOVED this!  Very good.  I also threw the bacon right in (as others did) and I used the Bisquick Dumpling recipe (from the box) since I forgot to buy the biscuits.  Will definitely make this again.
Note: had the leftovers for lunch, adding a little water before putting in the microwave (the dumplings soak up a lot of the liquid). I think it tastes even better the next day!

Loved this recipe!! My husband loves the canned chicken corn chowder but when he tasted this he was even more in love with my cooking!! I also just added the bacon right in and I added a shredded chicken breast as well because I like my stews full of meat. Dumplings def take longer than 10 minutes. Thanks so much for this recipe!!

It was OK. Nothing special. It was way too many dumplings.

I loved all of the different flavors tethered into this dish!!  It was definitely delicious, unfortunately what I did not like, was that it was much more time consuming than the 25 min listed for this recipe.  (at least it was for me)  
I love Chicken n Dumplings and this recipe was a new n tasty twist on this meal, but I do have another recipe that is much easier, less time consuming (when you're starving)  that I'll continue to use, that I feel like me and my family like best. ( the one I have is more of a creamier white sauce )  that's made with PET Condensed Milk and some cream instead of the cream of chicken.  Don't get me wrong though, because I loved this as well, both recipes are wonderful with A different taste.  (had a pic. it wouldn't load, too big)  ;D  ( maybe it will, just never know)

Liked this.. it is rich / sweet.  Didn't like the biscuits from the tube dropped in.  If I were to do the biscuits like that again, I would put the pot in the oven and let the biscuits cook through more...

I greatly changed this recipe because I didn't half of the items the original recipe called to use.  I also don't eat bacon.  It was AHMAZING!.  I swapped out the heavy cream and used cream of corn instead.  I also used mushroom condensed soup instead of the chicken condensed soup.  I didn't add any water and I made my dumplings from scratch using whole wheat flour.  One of the tastiest meals I've made to date.  My very picky stepdaughter had 3 servings, so I know it was delicious.  I made it with basmati rice and black beans.

I liked it, but I didn't care for the fattening cream of chicken soup, that was the glue that held it all together.

This was such an amazing soup! This would've been fine left alone. The dumplings were perfect. I used Pillsbury Grands, so they were a little bigger and had to cook a little longer. Just something to take into consideration. Can also cut them into smaller pieces. I Used leftover turkey and chicken from Christmas dinner. Substituted bacon bits with beef bouillon. Added a  scotch bonnet for some heat. A+

I  made it as close to the recipe as I could but I didn't have paprika and used Cajun seasoning instead. We don't like corn in things so I left that out but it was dead on otherwise. Loved it!! Kept thinking it didn't have enough spices in it but was very wrong. I have a beef stew recipe that I make which uses canned biscuits for dumplings so I knew what to expect with that but the flavor was incredible. Cannot wait to make it again!

Delicious! I took advice from other reviews, used boneless, skinless thighs, smaller can of cream of celery soup, low sodium chicken broth, added frozen green beans  & cooked dumplings for 20 minutes. Definitely will be cooking this again for the family.

I did not have the butter mild biscuits so instead I used Bisquick dumplings.  But, in any case, it was delicious and creamy and unlike any chicken and dumplings I have ever had!

This is still cooking, but I can already tell it's going to be good! I made a few changes, mostly in cooking technique.

I love one pot meals, so I chopped and cooked the bacon in a large pot first and removed with a slotted spoon to drain on paper towels, then cooked the chicken thighs in the bacon grease (seasoned the chicken first with Adobo and paprika). Poured off some of the grease then added the celery, carrot, onion and garlic to saute for about 5 minutes. Added the broth (chicken instead of vegetable) and about a tablespoon of sherry and let it simmer while I shredded the chicken (reserved the crispy skin for garnish!).  Threw in the chicken and the rest of the liquids (half cream of chicken & half cream of celery) and added frozen corn and peas. I'm letting it cook on low til ready to eat and will then add the "dumplings" - I'm using refrigerated  Pillsbury Buttermilk biscuits - and will top that with some herbs. I cannot wait to eat!

I will definitely make this again. I used some poached turkey breast instead of thighs since I had no thighs.  I did not know how much meat the 2# of chicken thighs would have yielded so I used about 4 cups/one pound of the poached turkey.  My biscuits were the cheap store brand kind & I will use a better quality biscuit next time; but that’s on me.  Great recipe!!

Probably would prefer something different than the condensed Chicken Soup as an additive. Makes it a bit blah, or so I think. Needs to be kicked up a bit.

Fantastic. Like another cook, I also used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock and the water. I doubt it made much difference. Make it as is and you won’t be disappointed. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this recipe for years. Although, the heavy cream is not a must, since you get a creamy consistency after adding the biscuits. It is definitely a winner in my home.

So, so yummy! This is the best chicken and dumplings I have made yet! 
I did sub half the cream of chicken soup for cream of celery. I didn't buy enough but had the celery soup on hand. I also made homemade dumplings using a recipe on this app.

The family loved it. Only substitution made was chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and only because I did not have veg broth.  We will be making this again for dinner, and it might become a favorite pass around dish for potlucks. Oops almost forgot - the crumbled bacon. This I could eliminate if I didn't have bacon or didn't want the mess. The family didn't really care if there were bacon crumbles or not.

Very tasty indeed! I made my own base rather than use tinned soup. I also didn't use bacon because I don't eat pork. It was still super delicious and the tea biscuit dumplings had such a nice texture and are so easy to throw in at the end! I also added fresh thyme because I love it.

Delicious! I had to wing it on a few of the ingredients as this was a last minute thing. Bacon pieces (pre packaged) instead of the bacon, a couple table spoons of dried celery instead of the fresh stalks, chicken bullion instead of the vegetable broth and I made stove top stuffing dumplings ( in a separate pot and added in) instead of the biscuits. I've never made this so I was feeling pretty sceptic. But for all the changes I had to make it was still a hit!

This seemed like an okay idea when I decided to make it. I really didn't like the fact that when I tasted the biscuit I knew it was a biscuit. It's like biscuit soup really. It looks nice. The biscuits made a very pretty looking dumpling, but this was really bad.

Found it VERY thick and added 2 additional cups of my homemade fabulous chicken stock.  Added the bacon to the stewp.

Very different than the stock-base chicken and dumplings I was raised on but very good!

I changed most of it. Boneless skinless Chicken thighs, gnocchi, spinach and mushrooms. 15 oz can cream of chicken low sodium, about 3/4 C fat free half n half, about 3/4 jar of light Alfredo sauce. Minced onion, onion powder, garlic powder, salt pepper, and tarragon!! Tarragon the key! Crockpot on low for a few hours! Watch out to not use too many gnocchi because it will become too thick as they triple in size. Delicious and filling!! By Tide

I followed the recipe except I cooked the thighs in grease from three strips of bacon but did not add the bacon as I did not want it to compete with the rest of the flavors. I could leave the bacon grease out next time and probably not miss it. I sauteed the veggies in the same pot after removing most of the chicken/bacon grease. I use Better Than Bullion for most of my dishes calling for stock, bullion, etc. I think it is better than anything out there boxed, canned, or otherwise. I used chicken instead of vegetable bullion and thought it worked just fine. I tried herb dumplings found elsewhere on this site. They were fine except I did not heed the advice of  others to cut back on the herbs and salt and sure enough they were way too herb-y and salty.  Wish I got mom's recipe for dumplings before she went to the  great kitchen in the sky. I'll give it four stars overall, will make again.

I forgot the garlic and bacon but I basically threw everything into a pot and let it simmer while I took my dog to class. Came back and it was perfect. I wonder if I used too much butter or too buttery biscuits for the dumplings because the soup itself tastes slightly buttery - lots of flavour but I'm more used to bland stuff.  Love this recipe and would definitely make it again. There was a surprising amount of soup. It was dinner for me and the hubby, breakfast and lunch for me, one container for a friend, and a bigger container to freeze for future feasting. Would definitely recommend this!

I had never made chicken & dumplings before, so I was a bit nervous.  I skipped the bacon, since we were out.  I added a few carrots & peas to the corn & made homemade dumplings, rather than refrigerator biscuits.  This was wonderful!  Will definitely make this again!  Hubby even said it was as good as his mom used to make, & I don't hear that often!  Thanks for sharing!

The canned biscuits had an odd texture and just did not taste right to me at all. 

I also suggest using cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken. It could be just a personal preference, though,  as I don't care for the taste of canned chicken.

I made this for my family  today, and I have some picky eaters.  They loved it, and my mom even asked for the recipe.  Super delicious, and will become a regular meal in my house! Thanks for the delicious recipe! I used Grands Buttermilk biscuits and cut each one into eight pieces, perfect dumplings.

A++++++ this was soooo yummy! I baked the chicken in a 9X13 greased with butter for 45 minutes at 375 degrees. I poured all the drippings into my pot. I also only had one can go cream of chicken soup. other then that i did everything the same! oh i also skipped the celery (cause i don't like it) but did about a 1/2 teaspoon celery seed :) 2 year old loved!

Not sure what I did wrong but the dumplings called for somehow didn't survive/disintegrated  and the entire dish just turned to one very large pot of lumpy gooey mush. This worked- if you run into the same issue I did-add a liter of water, heat and stir vigorously, and voila! This actually makes an awesome soup.

delicious! the only thing I'd change is that I'd use leftovers. this recipe said 25 minutes prep time, we'll it took me much longer to cook the chicken and bacon and cut up the veggies. I always have leftover chicken, and it'd just make this recipe a bit faster.

This was delicious!! I made it w/ a few revisions to cut the heavy ingredients and accommodate more vegetables. I used 2 chicken breasts and 5 thighs for meat variety - cooked in olive oil instead of butter, added in 3/4 a package of frozen corn when I dropped in the chicken, added 12 extra oz of stock (and I used chicken stock), 1/2 cup of light cream, used 1 10.5 oz of condensed cream of chicken, 1 10.5 oz of condensed cream of celery. And instead of biscuits I diced up 3 medium-sized red potatoes, added to the stew and cooked for the full 10 minutes - then served!

I gave my son the task of finding something to do with the chicken thighs, since he was tired of my grilling them.  He found this so I made it.

Didn't have any canned biscuits, so made some from Bisquick; didn't have heavy cream, used milk in place of both it and the water; didn't feel like using corn, added peas instead.  Both sons and husband loved it!  Definitely will be making this again, but probably wait until the weather's cooler.

Made according to directions except used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and less onion.  Family loved it, but next time I would leave out the crumbled bacon as we didn't like the texture of it with the soup (and we love bacon!).  The bacon drippings were a nice element though.

Okay, okay I cheated - kind of alot.  I was in a rush. I cooked the chicken through as directed, did not use the bacon at all, used chicken broth in lieu of vegetable broth.  I had no carrots, red onions or celery which I'm sure would have made it even more phenomenal.  Instead, I used a half bag of frozen pearl onions.  Oh geez, I just looked forgot to add the corn too.  I told you I cheated, but I also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream too.  FINALLY, I used 3 1/2 pounds of chicken thighs and used chicken broth instead of the water too. Figured it would be more flavor. I didn't have time to run to store for biscuits, so I simply used 2 1/4 cups Bisquick and 2/3 cup half and half and dropped them just the same. 
SUCH A BIG HIT WITH FAMILY!  10 decent sized thighs and there's only one half of a thigh and one half of a biscuit left and that's for 4 of us!   I seriously wouldn't be surprised if my family asked for it again tomorrow.
Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Made it almost according to the recipe (used whole milk instead of cream, and used Bisquick to make the dumplings).  My husband LOVED it, has named it one of his all-time favourites.

Another wonderful stew. Except for baking the chicken I stuck to the script (although I always end up baking the whole dutch oven whenever there are dumplings to finish). Its just so amazingly addictive; this hearty stew will probably not even make it to the fridge for leftovers ; )

Not exactly like traditional chicken & dumplings I'm used to, but a VERY tasty stew. Everyone goes nuts over it and asks for the recipe. The recipe ingredients and instructions are perfect! I personally like more dumplings, so I put more in and added more liquid.

While I thought they were good, I think I prefer traditional style chicken and dumplings better. However, my husband had a fit over them! He said they were the best I've ever made, so go figure.  I did use a rotisserie chicken instead of the thighs, but that is the only substitution I made.  All in all, not bad.  It averages to a 4 star rating between me and my hubby.

Weird dish to make on a hot summer night, but I had leftover chicken, homemade stock and I was in the mood for some comfort food. This certainly hit the spot! I did leave out the corn and used Bisquick to make my dumplings. Added in a few more seasonings and some dill. Can't wait to have this for lunch today. Thank you Averyfern!
