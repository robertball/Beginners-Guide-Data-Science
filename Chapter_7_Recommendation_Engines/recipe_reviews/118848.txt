Made this yesterday for a brunch. Should have doubled the recipe. People were practically licking the bowl.    Just a few changes to the recipe: only 1 apple, only plain yogurt - no vanilla, no lemon juice, added 1 teaspoon salt, subbed cranberries for the raisins. People asked for the recipe. I will make it again for Easter Sunday. I Thanks, Kim!

This was a fantastic salad.  I made it for a crowd and had less than 1 serving left over which told me everyone liked it.  I even had several people ask for the recipe.  I used all plain yogurt (didn't have any vanilla on hand) & added 1 Tablespoon of sugar to take the place of the vanilla.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of salt & 1/4 teaspoon of celery seed to jazz it up (like others said, it was missing something) I also added chopped walnuts & omitted the coconut (personal preference).  Great base that's easy to personalize.  Oh & you can't even tell that its a "lightened up" version!  Yum!  Thanks Kim for a great salad!

This is a great salad! Since I only had plain low-fat yogurt and no coconut on hand, I added a packet of Sweet-N-Low to give it the final touch.

Okay...nothing special.  Probably if I made it again I would add walnuts.  It was missing something.

Good flavor and relatively easy to make, but be warned, it does not keep well.

Great!!  I loved it...good salad to take in my lunch when I am tired of lettuce.  I didn't have pineapple so omitted it and substituted craisens for the raisens.  I'm kinda glad I didn't have the pineapple, it may have made it to sweet and "dessert like".

This is really delicious! I also added some finely shredded beet from the garden, which made for a very colorful mix!  I used a bit more pineapple than called for, and craisins because I was out of raisins. Refreshing treat on a hot day and a bit hit with everyone.

This was so great! Renewed my memories of carrot salad and made me decide it would be a great lunch substitute once in a while! Highly recommend using both the pineapple and the coconut, it's a hit.

My family really likes this sweet-tart crunchy salad and its a quick side for potlucks.  I don't like coconut so I don't add it and I only use plain yogurt plus a dash of salt.  I also shred the apples along with the carrots for a more uniform texture.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and easy.  Used pineapple tibits instead of crushed.  Used a 6-oz container of low-carb (Kroger brand) vanilla yogurt instead of half vanilla and half plain. Used Fuji apples and didn't peel.  This is a keeper!

Sorry the pineapple and the coconut were just too odd for my taste in the carrot salad.  If I was a from the South and had grown up with it as most there have, I am sure it would be a hit.

First, I had greek yogurt so I used 2/3 cup, added a splash of vanilla extract and a big squeeze of honey to the dressing.
I was thinking of my mom's apple salad with mayonaise dressing and wanting something like it but a little healthier yet still delicious. Did I ever find it! It hasn't even chilled yet and I could sit and eat the whole bowl. When the flavors chill together it will be worth 6 stars. Serving it with pork chops tonight which I think is going to be a perfect pairing.

Very good. Fresh tasting and not too sweet. I used granny smith apples, and had to substitute because I didn't have all the ingredients: used only plain yogurt, orange instead of lemon juice, and no coconut. I made this for thanksgiving to use up the leftover carrots and apples in my fridge. Also made for a pretty presentation with all the different colors.

I love this salad!  So good and the leftovers are great for lunch the next day.  I follow the recipe as directed although I do add extra raisins because we love how plump they get!

I made some spicy jerk chicken and needed a cooling side dish.  I had most all of the ingredients on hand so I gave it a try.  My changes were minor.  Used fresh pineapple, 1 large apple, skipped the raisins (didn't have any) and added a bit of vanilla extract to plain yogurt (in lieu of two different yogurts).  Also used only 2 Tbsp of regular mayo instead of reduced fat.

It was good.  Not jaw dropping good but good!  I'll make it again and add some nuts as it needed a crunch element.  Not overly sweet but sweet enough.  It paired extremely well with the jerk chicken.  This is a keeper.  Thanks Kim!

This was the perfect recipe when our carrots were ready to harvest from the garden. The only change I made was using only vanilla yogurt instead of both vanilla and plain. The apples were a really nice touch to this.

I served this very pretty salad for Easter Brunch. Made it as written except substituted craisins for the raisins.  I can't give it a 5 because it's missing something that I can't put my finger on.  I see one reviewer added a little salt and another added sweet & low.  Maybe one of those would do the trick.  I will be making it again.

Delicious! I made it for Thanksgiving and told everyone at work about it on Monday. I took the advice and used Craisins. I like them better than raisins and the little red beauties made this colorful salad even more festive.

Very yummy, and for a change I didn't change too much. I just added a small handful of chopped walnuts for crunch. Was even better the next day.

Very good salad, thanks for the recipe!  I didn't measure out ingredients, just "eye-balled" them to the proportions that I wanted.  I also didn't have vanilla yogurt, so I used key lime pie yogurt which I had on hand, and it gave it a very interesting fresh flavor with a hint of lime.  I will make this again.

Truly excellent.  Didn't have time to refrigerate since we needed a "quick fix", but still very good and tasty.  Probably better cold.  Left out the mayo since we plainly don't like it.  Didn't miss it.  Didn't have lemon yoghurt just plain, added a little extra lemon juice.

For a quick fix I take a bag of shredded carrots, chop a Gala apple, a mini box of raisins and toss with OJ. It is better the next day, but delicious!

I blanched the carrots and apples for my 16 month old and she loved it.  

Thanks!
