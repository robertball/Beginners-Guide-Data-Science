First let me say that the picture is quite deceiving. In reality, they look as gross as they tasted. I ended up throwing almost half of the dough away, because the cookies were that nasty. DON'T MAKE THESE COOKIES!

I *really* wanted to like these cookies.

They came out horrible.  The butter was too much at 2 sticks, the cookies spread all over the place not to mention all I tasted was butter.  The cinnamon should also have been reduced by half, the entire batch was too fragrant of the spice.

Also, I should have added more coconut, you didn't taste it at all.
Waste of ingredients, they were mostly broken and flat.  I was really dissapointed.

Taste okay, but not worth the mess.  They stuck to the pan and many fell into pieces.

This recipe and I did not get along. The first run spread as wide as the pan! After finally raising the total flour to 3.25 cups, they stopped running (chilled everything on the first run through!). They were impossible to remove in one piece, no matter how long I waited, and if I waited until they were cool, they became polystyrene cement. This is such a nice idea, and I was so-o-o-o-o-o careful. Ah, well.

this recipe was good, but not great. cut the marshmellows and coconut for better results, in fact it also tasts better without the cin.
