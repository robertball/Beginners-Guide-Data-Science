Quick and easy for a light lunch! I used Hellman's light mayo and left out the yogurt. I used green onion finely chopped and added a bit of dijon mustard and cracked black pepper to the mix.  Overall, very good on toasted whole grain bread with crisp lettuce and tomatoes.

This was really yummy.  I made it exactly but doubled the recipe for five.  We had it for dinner with vegetable soup.  It was super easy!

I was pretty skeptical about the yogurt, but it was really quite good.  My other recipe calls for mayo and cream cheese, but I think I'll use this one at home from now on.  I boiled up a chicken breast instead of using canned.  I also added a dash of Beaumond seasoning and threw in a few cashews.

Didn't have celery or yogurt in the house so substituted with sweet relish and sour cream.  Turned out really well!

That was by and far the best chicken sandwich I've had in a long time.

I substituted the yogurt, for Greek Yogurt to make it a little healthier

This was really yummy. I used melded two recipes together. I used 1/4 cup mayo and 1/3 cup plain yogurt. I did about 1/4 cup cashews, 2 green onions, and one medium and one small chicken breast. I just boiled the chicken breast the night before. I had forgotten to boil the eggs the night before so I didn't include them. I didn't include the lemon juice. I added salt and pepper and we served it over whole wheat bread and pillsbury croissonts with romaine lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard.
