Like other reviewers, I was in search of a recipe to make breakfast sausage since I cannot have many of the additives (mostly MSG) in commercially-prepared sausage.  We moved and I could no longer find sausage without additives.

Even if you *can* eat commercial sausage, DON'T - make this and you'll never make anything else!!!  I used 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 fresh ground turkey (better texture than frozen).  This cuts the fat content, and it's still so great!  I made the recipe as stated, but next time I'll cut down on the sage and increase the red pepper to our own liking.  My family doesn't want to eat anything else now!  The first Sunday I cooked the sausage for breakfast, my husband said he just kept thinking about how good it was all during church service!

If you haven't tried Lee Fogle's Italian Sausage recipe - YOU MUST!  It's also fantastic!  THANK YOU!!!!

Have been fumbling around for the best sausage recipe.  Wow!  Just made this recipe and tried some left over scraps.  Substituted 1 1/2 tsp fennel seed for the clove (which I did not have).  Rolled the sausage out to about 3/8"  between two layers of waxed paper and plastic wrap (to protect my wooden roller).  Cut out rounds with a three inch biscuit cutter.  Reroll and cut out until only a few scraps are left.  It made 18 rounds with some scraps for tasting. Oh Yum!

This recipe was soo easy and tasted pretty good!  I didn't have marjoram or cloves and all I had was some ground sage and the Italian Spices (which contained a bit of rosemary, marjoram, sage etc) So I improved with 1 1/2 tsp of ground sage and 1 tsp of the Italian Spices.  I thought it was a bit too sweet (even though I like sweet sausages).  Although I think that the sausage tastes better after a few days in the freezer then cooked. I definitely recommend this recipe but I'd give it a 2-3 days in the freezer to set (just make sure to make it into patties before you freeze it, makes a better of a time than defrosing a hunk of meat.) But overall Great recipe Lee!  Thank you very much for sharing it ^_^

Very tasty recipe.  I substituted ground pork for 1 pound of ground turkey breast and 1 pound of ground turkey thigh for a lower fat version of breakfast sausage.  I also doubled the sage.  
When making patties wet, hands with water to prevent it from sticking to your hands. This recipe yielded 20 patties for me.

This recipe can't be beat.  It's so tasty and easy to make that I'll probably never buy store-bought sausage again--especially since you don't know what 'by-products' are in there.  This recipe is the real thing!  You won't be disappointed.

This is a great basic recipe. I usually mix 1/2 lean ground turkey and 1/2 ground pork. This helps to cut some calories while still giving the flavor we want. I've made several varieties of this sausage by adding different herbs, both fresh and dried to change it up a bit, sometimes cutting back or eliminating the sugar, depending on what I'm using it for. I find my family likes a sweeter sausage for breakfast but more savory for other dishes.   I've also used this basic recipe to make mild Italian sausage without fennel seeds. Most Italian sausage on the market is Sicilian style, heavy with fennel flavor and not what I like or use to, being from a Northern Italian family. I just add fresh basil, dried Italian seasoning, granulated garlic, onion powder, sage and marjoram, and eliminate the red pepper flakes, cloves and brown sugar for an Italian style sausage that is just delicious. You can also add some sun dried tomatoes for a fruitier flavor. Also, to the person who felt the seasoning wasn't blended thruout the meat, an easy fix for that is to spread the meat against and up the sides of the bowl with a fork, spreading it out as much as possible, almost forming a well in the center. Then sprinkle your seasoning mix evenly over the spread out meat. Then mix together and you will have a more even flavor.

This is the perfect blend of spices for breakfast sausage!  I just made my first batch and it is the best I ever had!  I ground my own pork, turkey and even threw in some beef scraps.  If you use turkey or chicken be sure your pork is fatty.  If you don't have enough fat in sausage it is dry & tastless.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars as is.  I made this today, and enjoyed it, prepared as is.  My family & I thought it was a bit bland.  I think I would basically double all spices besides salt & pepper.  I am going to try that next time, hopefully it will have more flavor.  This is a good basic breakfast sausage recipe, and can be adjusted to your own likings.  I did let the pork & spices blend in the fridge for about 18 hours, and would highly recommend doing that if you have time.

I loved this recipe although if you use lean ground pork then be careful not to burn the patties!  Even my husband liked it and he's harder to please!

This is the most delicious sausage I have ever tasted.  My husband loves spicy foods so I will be experimenting with other herbs, such as thai basil, lemon balm, dill seed, rosemary and tarragon all of which I grow.

Very good spicy sausage although a bit sweet for me.  I cut brown sugar to 1 teaspoon. Maybe too spicy for kids or those with sensitive palate.  I used this recipe for ground pork from a wild hog.  Yummy!!!

We are on a low fat diet and this is so good.  I get lean ground pork.  It does not taste like your traditional greasy sausage.  Use cooking spray every so often to get the patties to slip out easy.  It has a flavor of its own and is much better for us.  We missed our morning meat and this recipe is our favorite.  I take a wide mouth jar ring and lid to make patties and put them on a cookie sheet reusing the ring and lid for each patty.  When sheet is full I slip in the freezer until frozen and repackage them in a freezer bag.  When we want them they are ready.  I thaw in microwave before cooking so they will cook well in the center.  Also as others say let spices meld in the pork overnight in the refrig.

Wow, wow, wow!!  I halved the recipe just to make sure we liked it and now I wish I had made the whole thing!  I made this for my dad because he really likes sausage, but I worry about the fat, sodium, and preservatives he’s eating in store-bought sausage.  I used a 19.2 ounce package of extra lean ground pork and got 15 two-inch patties out of it.  I omitted the red pepper flakes because my dad doesn’t care for spicy sausage and, based on a few reviews, I cut the brown sugar in half.  The flavor was so good that my dad didn’t even add salt…something he applies in liberal quantities to store-bought sausage!!  This will be our breakfast sausage from now on.  I can’t wait to try it with turkey!  Thanks for an awesome recipe :-)  ****UPDATE**** I tried this with ground turkey this morning.  I cut the recipe in half because I only wanted to "waste" 1 pound of meat if it didn't turn out good, but it was awesome! I use the cheap ground turkey, so it was kind of gloppy after mixing it up. It wasn't possible to form patties with my hands, so I used a tablespoon sized measuring spoon and scooped small mounds into my skillet, then smoothed them into roughly round, flattened shapes. The first time I flipped them over was a little tricky, because they hadn't fully firmed up yet, but after that it was smooth sailing. I made eight patties and then crumble-fried the rest of it for gravy. We had sausage patties with biscuits and gravy for breakfast. YUMMY!!!

When making sausage of any kind being, Italian,Brats or Breakfast Patties. It is always best to let your seasoned meat rest in the fridge over night to flavor thru before putting it in casings or making patties.

I recently went 'Paleo' and have been looking for a good spice mix that doesn't include sugar. I couldn't find one. So, I took this recipe and replaced the brown sugar with about 1/2 cup shredded apple/apple sauce. It came out awesome. I make a batch every Sunday to eat for breakfast at work all week.

Incredible sausage recipe! I didn't add any sugar at all but otherwise made as written. The problem I was having again and again was that the spices wouldn't evenly distribute throughout the meat no matter how much I mixed with my hands. We were always getting inconsistently seasoned bites. I know it's going to sound strange, but I solved the problem with few seconds of mixing with my standard hand mixer. Using the mixer evenly distributes all the seasonings and spices. I let it sit about an hour before I cook the sausage to distribute flavors. The result is always amazing sausage that never fails to get rave reviews and tons of compliments!

This is a "staple" recipe in my kitchen. I mix it in ground turkey and freeze in patties on sheets, then bag in freezer ziplocs. I use allspice instead of cloves and have added other spices to various batches (thyme, minced onion, etc). Good basic recipe for sausage without all those nasty additives.

Impressive!  I honestly didn't expect it to be this good!  I bought a butt picnic roast and ground the whole thing for sausage; I ended up with 5 lbs.  I took off the large piece of fat on the top but left the rest--sausage has to have fat in order not to be dry.  Even so, when I cooked it there was NO grease in the pan.  Makes you wonder what the ratio of fat is in comercial sausage!!  Only thing I will change next time is more red pepper.  SUPER RECIPE!!

This was just what I was looking for! I halved the recipe and used 1lb of ground turkey instead of pork. I didn't have cloves, so I left that out, and was out of marjoram so I substituted that with oregano. This made delicious crumbled sausage for our breakfast enchiladas & it will be my go to recipe for sausage from now on, even for hot italian sausage (all it would need is more crushed red pepper and some fennel seeds), thanks!

I'm sorry but this had no taste at all. I had to triple all the spices(not the salt) to try to get some kind of flavor. I will keep looking.

I love this! I recently got a grinder for my KA and tried this when I found 'Pork Cushions' on sale for $1.37/lb.  Low fat (I trimmed), lower sodium than store bought, and delicious. I ran out of sage and used  1 tsp. sage and 1 tsp. poultry seasoning and substituted allspice for cloves because that is what I had.   I also made it with ground chicken thighs. Very good! Will definitely be making this on a regular basis. I have 35 little patties freezing in my freezer right now.

Great recipe.  I coated pan with Canola Oil first to prevent sticking because I used 1 pound lean ground pork with one pound of ground turkey breasts. I plan to use dark turkey meat next time. I omitted red pepper flakes and used 1/2 t. ground cayenne pepper so there would be some heat throughout the sausage but not located in just flakes.  Make patties and freeze them.  They freeze nicely if separate with wrapping paper.
Update: Using the dark turkey meat with the pork instead of the white turkey meat added more fat and flavor.  No need to oil pan before frying.  I used 3 tea. of ground sage (not rubbed) and 5/8 tea. of thyme and 1/2 tea. rosemary leaves to incrase the flavor.  These were good additions that we liked.

Bye bye Jimmy Dean, hello Lee Fogle!This is such wonderful sausage. Very mild flavor. I loved knowing what's in my sausage and that is isn't full of fillers and fat and by products. Next time I am going to add a bit more of all the spices as I do like hot sausage and sage sausage too...but just as written is def 5 stars!!! I made this last night, freezing half and then cooking half this morning. I am so glad I tried this recipe, it's just what I have been looking for. Thanks Lee, I can't wait to try your italian sausage recipe too. (it's in my fridge waiting for tonight's pizza dinner)

His is a very nice basic recipe. I have used ground turkey for this as well. On my 2nd batch I added a tsp of garlic  and onion powder as well. It rounded out the flavor. Thanks for sharing this simple recipe. I now use it frequently.

A little sweet for my taste. I'll cut back on the sugar a bit next time and add a bit more of a kick to it. So much cheaper and better for you than the store bought.

This sausage really is as good as the reviews indicate.  I have made it several times and find my favorite meat combination to be 1# ground pork and 1# ground turkey.  Key:  don't overcook.

Surprisingly good!  I halved the recipe and used ground turkey instead of the pork. This is a keeper!

First, let me say that I'm really picky about sausage (total Jimmy Dean fan).  What a pleasant surprise this recipe is.  I used "really lean" ground pork (it's what was in the freezer), so the texture was a bit different than a traditional sausage patty. The spices are spot on, and I wouldn't change a thing.  Lee Fogle, thanks for sharing your recipe.  This one's going into my Favorites folder.

I am on a very low sodium diet and have been missing bacon and sausages, decided to try this recipe. I had 2.75 lbs of ground pork so I adjusted the recipe to 8 servings. I used 1 tbsp poultry seasoning, 1.25 tsp black pepper, 4 tsps maple syrup sugar, 0.25 tsp red pepper flakes, 0.25 tsp parsley and 0.25 tsp thyme, I put them in my spice mill to grind finely. I used my #50 scoop which yielded 16 2.5 ounce raw weight patties. Sodium 44 mg Potassium 230 mg.

I get tired of all the, ahem, excuse my language, , in our food, especially sausage and breakfast meats...this is the most amazing recipe, SO SIMPLE, ridiculously easy, and when made with quality fresh ground, locally grown, organic pork....um...beyond amazing! Never going back....nope. This is it.
I put less salt in, because my husband doesn't like salty breakfast meat...and he loved it. Personally, I would probably use the called for amount.

This recipe is excellent!  I like it spicy so I increased the red pepper flakes and black pepper. I didn't have cloves and left out the brown sugar because my boyfriend is on a low-carb diet. It still turned out great. I didn't make patties. I just cooked the meat and made it into a breakfast skillet with scrambled eggs, broccoli and cheese melted on top.Will make again! Highly recommend!

A million stars! I LOVE that I can now know exactly what is in our breakfast sausage, and my husband is just happy that now I'll serve breakfast sausage!  These were unbelievable- better than any packaged or frozen than I've ever had.  **Update- I tried it with ground turkey, and it's good. The texture is a little different than the pork, of course, but still delicious!

Never tried making my own sausage. I had ground pork in the freezer and short of time to make dinner. This was easy and wonderful! I used the sausage to stuff sections of butternut squash and put bacon on top. This was baked at 350F for about an hour and a quarter. Rave reviews from all!

Thank you, Lee Fogle, for a top notch sausage recipe.  I've been searching for a recipe that reminded me of the sausage my father-in-law used to make on the farm and this is pretty close....regardless, it taste great!  I made exactly to recipe using a combo of dried and fresh sage.  I look forward to trying your Italian Style Sausage.

Had a hard time getting the seasonings evenly mixed in. I saw on diners drive-ins and dives a guy who mixed his seasonings in wine and water to help. I will try that way and see if it helps because I liked the taste!

Made as directed, except with 1/2 of salt.  Wish I had kept the original amount!  This was good, not what I was expecting, but good.  Ok, just doctored up my batch, I added one tsp ground thyme, about 1/4 tsp rosemary that I coarsly ground in my grinder, and the remaining salt I had omitted previously.  just for kicks, I added a squeeze of maple syrup to the batch.  Much better and more flavorful!  Will be eating this with pancakes tomorrow morning!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!!! I thought I would try it hoping it would be good enough that I could serve it for Mother's Day Brunch. I'm so glad I gave it a shot. I used boneless pork spare ribs, thinking that cut would have plenty of fat so I wouldn't have to worry about the meat being dry as other reviewers had mentioned. I just ground the meat myself using my Kitchenaid stand mixer and grinding attachment. I did cut back on the salt a little, using 1 1/2 tsp. and substituting cayenne for the red pepper flakes as other reviewers recommended. I thought the seasoning was perfect. Much like the taste of well-known brands. Another reviewer recommended rolling the meat out and using a biscuit cutter to make patties and this worked out very well for me. I can't wait for my family to try this!!!

This sausage is excellent!!  I like it hot so I doubled the red peppers and used a little extra black pepper. I also omitted the cloves because I don't care for that particular spice.  I tried it first with regular pork and then with a wild hog. Either way, it is wonderful!  I even had casings so I made it into sausage links.  I will never buy sausage from the store again!

My Grandparents buy a 4H cow and pig every year and no one ever knows what to do with all of the ground pork. But after I found this recipe my husband does not complain about eating it as breakfast sausage or if I just brown the pork with the spices and then use it in biscuits and gravy. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This was my first time making sausage patties and they were delicious. Tasted better than prepared sausage with none of the chemicals. The only thing I changed was I added slightly more brown sugar and less crushed red pepper.

I added 50% more spices so that the flavor is more like breakfast sausage should be.  I also added 1/8 cup water per pound to add moisture.  The one thing I would do next time is to use an 80/20 meat to fat mix as a lean grind does not lend either flavor or juiciness.

I will never buy breakfast sausage again! This recipe is so darn easy and so incredibly tasty, I don't know why anyone would buy breakfast sausage when they could just make it for themselves. 

Normally, I do not like breakfast sausage at all because it's full of gristle and fat and always has a weird, indescribable flavor component that reminds me that I'm probably eating leftover "parts," but I needed breakfast sausage for a recipe. I love this recipe because it gave me total control over what cuts we were eating and I was able to season to my family's tastes. In this case, I followed the recipes exactly except for the marjoram, which I didn't have. I did a quick internet search for substitutions and replaced the 1/4 teaspoon of marjoram with a pinch each of basil, thyme, and oregano. 

I'm already planning to make something with breakfast sausages for next weekend. I can't wait to have this sausage again!

This is a great recipe, however, I add ground fennel seed (grind your own with a spice grinder or coffee grinder) and that gives it a real great taste. I fry mine all at once then freeze the patties in pairs and my husband takes them to work and heats them up in the microwave oven for breakfast.

A great recipe for a very mild sausage.  Next time I make it I will increase the peppers and the other spices.  A good basic recipe for elaborating with as well.  You can use any ground meat and get personal with the herbs.

This was really good. It has a very nice mild flavor. I am going to double all spices next ime to give it more of a kick. Great, great recipe!

Oh my!  I made this with 1 lb 97/3 ground turkey and then 1 lb of the leanest loin I could find with all the visable fat removed.  I put the loin that I'd cut into pieces into my food processor and pulsed until chopped finely.  I then added the ground turkey to blend.  Dumped into a large bowl and added the spices (except marjoram, I didn't have any).  It was absolutely delicious and so very low in fat.  I don't have to feel guilty eating breakfast sausage any more.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  I never thought I could make it at home.

My family normally loves sausage-there is never any left. this time however we had 4 patties left. I thought there was far to much seasoning in it. It was easy to make but the flavor was just not my families style.

My family loves this sausage! We moved abroad several years ago and haven't been able to find store bought sausage that tasted like what we were use to having down home. This recipe is a God send. Thank you Lee Fogle!

When I gave this to Husband with his breakfast on Sunday, he said, "Oooo, this is great. Where'd you get it?" Great combination of flavors, and the amount of cloves is just right. Will definitely make again. Thanks so much, Lee!

Followed other review suggestions and decreased brown sugar from 1 T to 1 tsp and used 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning in place of marjoram.  Delicious sausage!  Thanks for helping me learn to make from scratch.

I can't believe how hard of a time I had trying to find a homemade sausage recipe! I am so glad you posted this one Lee :) It gave me a good base to create my own and tweak the seasonings. I left out the marjoram and cloves. I doubled up on red pepper flakes and added a grill steak spice blend. I also added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and reduced the brown sugar to 2 tsp(could've left it out all together and be just fine!). Also, I used one pound of ground venison and one pound of ground pork.  It came out great! :)

I was skeptical that this would satisfy my sausage craving, but it really came though for me and it was wonderfully tasty! I am a life long Weight Watcher, and I am always looking for ways to modify tasty, high fat,unhealthy recipes and make them more suitable for my healthier eating efforts. This really fit the bill for me! I don't want to sound like one of those reviewers who changes everything in a recipe and basically makes a completely different recipe, but I will tell you how I made a few small changes. I used 93% ground turkey instead of pork and I was worried about this because I'm not a big turkey fan, but I thought the seasonings would give it enough flavor for me to get away with it and they did! I didn't have marjoram so I used poultry seasoning and I used 1/2 tsp for half the recipe. I also added more red pepper flakes as I like spicy food.I also upped the sage by 1/2 tsp. The amount of salt was perfect, I wouldn't touch it. Do not leave out the brown sugar or cloves, I think they really balanced the flavors in this for me. Everything else was the same for me. I also patted the mixture out onto waxed paper and used a biscuit cutter to make uniformly sized patties. I fried in a non-stick skillet and I didn't need any oil or spray, the fat in the meat was enough. These were delicious. I got two patties per serving with one leftover. I halved the recipe with no problem. I will freeze the leftovers and heat 'n eat as desired. Thank you for a real winner Lee Fogel!

Absolutely wonderful flavor. I ground the pork myself and added this seasoning. Let it sit in refrigerator overnight. Made patties next morning and everyone loved them. Flavor was just what we were looking for. Earthy, just a touch of sweetness. They browned up beautifully. I will be making these, cooking, freezing so all I have to do is put in microwave for a wonderful breakfast addition.

We are officially done ever buying frozen sausage again!  Been buying it for years and i finally worked up the nerve to try my hand at this stuff.  Wow, it seriously was like "Bam" in my mouth.  It tasted just like breakfast sausage, only way more intense and better-tasting flavors.  I mean, the intensity and flavor was incredible.  My husband who is the pickiest eater in the world thought it was the best sausage he had ever had.  I made a full cylinder size pack of links.  i had like 3-4 links of it and my husband ate the rest of them, LOL!  Good stuff.  He suggested we even try it spicier, hotter, next time.  Great job!  We felt like Bill when Peggy on King of the Hill says, "I've got potato salad," and Bill replies by gaping his mouth open while saying, "And i've got a mouth!"

These are really good for homemade breakfast sausages!  Super easy too!  I will never buy the store bought ones again.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, is because I cooked up one, as the original recipe and found it a little bland.  So, I went back and added another 1tsp. sage, 1/8tsp. marjoram, and 1/2 Tbsp. brown sugar.  Did not add extra salt or cloves and I didn't use the red pepper flakes.  With the addition of some extra spice, they were perfect!  Yum!

As many others noted, I will not go back to the store-bought patties again! These taste and smell similar to the store-bought ones except without all the gristle, added salt and msg.   These are perfect the way they are.  I was searching for something different to do with ground pork and came across this recipe.  I'm so happy I did!

All 8 of my kids and my husband have refused to go back to store bought sausage since trying this! I get pork roasts on sale and grind my own meat so there is almost no grease at all and having a large family, this makes sausage WAYYYYYY cheaper for us!!!

My kids love breakfast sausage but so many of the commercial sausages are full of stuff I can't pronounce.  This is sausage like my grandma used to make, meat and spices.  I had no idea it was so easy to make.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!  Since the kids don't like too much spice I will omit the red pepper next time but they still liked it as is until they hit a red pepper flake.  This really is easy to make and tastier than store bought.

Just what I was looking for.  We don't get the bulk breakfast sausage here in NZ, plus I was wanting a good pizza topping sausage.  This works well.

I was looking for a copy-cat recipe for Jimmy Dean sausage (which I found) but wanted to try this one as it had such high reviews. It is a very tasty recipe but I think the next time I make it I  will add just a touch more sage. In case you are not aware: I went to my grocery store to purchase a pork shoulder to make this recipe. As I was looking, the meat manager came out to add more meat to the case and I asked him if by chance he could cut the shoulder in half (it was a 12 pounder!) and grind half. He smiled and said Of Course! I was so excited because I then did not have to mess with grinding my own. It was early in the morning so he did not have any pork fat leftover, so I bought a cheap piece of bacon that had mostly fat on it and he ground that into the pork. Easy - breezy! So if you do not have a grinder you may want to ask your local grocery store if they would grind up your meat.

This review is partially based upon my family's feedback and rating since they are the ones who ate these breakfast sausages. I just seasoned and cooked them this morning. I used a pound of ground turkey as it was what I had on hand at the time. I added fresh minced sage, hawaiian sea salt, black pepper, marjoram, brown sugar, 1 garlic clove, dash of red pepper and fennel seeds. I did not have any ground cloves. I seasoned the meat and rolled it between two layers of wax paper into a nice log. I wet my hands so the meat wouldn't stick. I sliced out each patties close to 1 inch thickness and into small round circles. The size of each sausage fit right in the palm of my hands. I had about 12 small round patties. I wrapped and placed the patties into the refrigerator and let it marry overnight. This morning I fried up the sausages on one side until I saw a nice brown sear and then I flipped it over to brown the other side. The wonderful smell of the sausages was enough to make my family peer into the kitchen to see what I was cooking on the stove. They gobbled the sausages up saying that it was delicious! In his exact words my hubby said, "The sausages are perfectly seasoned and tastes Ono (delicious)." He ate 6 patties all to himself! I served these breakfast sausages along with, "Fluffy Biscuits," also from this website. The biscuits, by the way, are FLUFFY and delicious! The sausages paired perfectly with the fluffy biscuits and eggs for breakfast!

This tastes great!  We have a lot of ground pork so this made a nice change ....I fried it as ground pork sausage, and used it in breakfast pizza, and it was gone in seconds!

Good but a bit bland. I used fresh herbs and doubled them up, but it is still lacking a bit of flavor.

I had a 2 pound boneless pork roast in the frig that I didn't have time to cook so I used my KitchenAid grinder attachment and coarse ground it this morning.  Divided the ground pork into two 1 pound portions, recalculated the recipe for 3 servings and followed it exactly. Formed patties and fried them for breakfast, they were very good.  We usually get ground sage sausage from our butcher and these were every bit as good.  I'm going to make Italian sausage with the remaining meat tomorrow night.

The flavor in these was very plain and didn't remind me of the sausage I get in the store at all. I didn't even make the whole batch...ended up tossing the leftovers. Sorry, this just wasn't for us.

I used all beef because it was what I had.  Everything else I followed to a 'T'.  Next time I will make these silver dollar size because they don't shrink up.  (Probably because I used beef)

This tastes exactly like breakfast links, but I can do it with freshly minced pork from the butcher and no additives.  Makes brilliant gravy to go with home made biscuits!

Amazing!! I made it with 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef. We live in Hong Kong and pay a fortune for sausages from the US and other Countries. I am thrilled to be able to make my own that have no MSG in them. Many, many thanks!

My new favorite sausage recipe!  I love the bit of sweetness this has -might try using maple sugar next time! I omitted the cloves (not a huge fan)   My salt crazed family asked for more salt but I thought it tasted perfect!

I used half ground pork and half ground turkey.  This recipe is perfect.  I made this for a family breakfast and everyone loved it from age 15 to 70.      I add a splash of water (just a splash) to help the herbs and spices incorporate easier.  This works well with most sausage recipes.

This is a very good recipe that adapted well to healthy cooking.  Substituted chicken for pork, added 1 tsp of olive oil, and 2 tbs ground flax seed.  All other spices stayed the same.  It was wonderful.  Quick to prepare, easy to cook, and delicious.

I was disappointed on the first attempt - the finished product seemed tough and dry. It may have been the fault of the ground pork I used - packaged, right from the meat case. It may have been too lean, and was ground fairly coarsely. I'm going to try it again, but ask the butcher for double ground pork that's not too lean. Spices were a flavorful combination, but I would probably use about one and a half times the spice mix per pound of meat than what's called for in the recipe (we like a bit more robust seasoning than many folks). First time a disappointment, but will definitely try again.

We just made a double batch of these based on all you people's rave reviews.  How nice to have doubled it!  Now we have patties made and in the freezer ready to toss in the pan for yummy breakfasts!  The only change we made was to use half ground turkey with the pork.  Yum Yum!

Awesome recipe. I used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 pork. Also added a little more red pepper to suit our tastes. Made about 2 dozen patties for us - freezes very well.   Fantastic!

Very good sausage I added a bit more sage (my preference). I used lean ground pork 16% fat whereas the store bought sausage I had on hand is 35% fat. In addition the protein content is 19% vs. only 10.5% for store bought.  This made for a very tasty sausage with little shrinkage when cooked and much healthier than regular store bought sausage.

Well, many reviewers said it before me but, I must reiterate......I'll never buy sausage from the store again.  This is just what I've been looking for.  I made this exactly as the recipe stated except I added a few fennel seeds for character. My wife(who usually refuses sausage)loved this.  It reminded her of a bed and breakfast we stayed at in Franklin, N.C. and she thought that sausage was great.

Thanks Lee for sharing this recipe.

Wonderful recipe, espcially with the unstable and usually high prices for good sausage.  When I make this, I use 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 ground pork and the results are great.

This is absolutely great.  Very versatile. I adjusted the heat down a bit, adding less cayenne.  I also made it w/brown sugar one time, and maple syrup the next.  I used half lean ground pork, and half ground turkey.  This frees me from the store bought sausage with it's questionable ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious. Simple to make but so flavourful. I happen to love sage so I went heavy on it(and the other spices too). I actually made these into little balls and fried them, and then made a cream sauce, added the sausage balls, sauteed carrots and onions and served it over whole wheat penne. So good!

I'm never buying frozen sausage patties again! These were great and very simple to throw together. You do have to be careful with the cloves though, or they'll overpower the entire sausage. Thanks Lee!

This sausage is really, really good.  Other people suggested there was too much salt so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons and I thought it was just right.  I used the cloves but will omit this next time.  Very good recipe, thank you!

Tasty and very simple to make - followed recipe exactly - I would cut back on the sugar a little and add more pepper flakes - but that is simply my preference. My only complaint was that they were a bit dry but it could be that my pork might have been too lean - I will try them again.  It was nice knowing what was actually in my sausage!!!!  Thanks submitter.

I used ground Italian sausage since we like a lot of flavor. I also used another reviewer's tip and froze the patties ahead of time. On Christmas morning, all I had to do was take them out of the freezer and put them on the griddle for a few minutes.

After reading the reviews I decided to make this exactly as written with the exception of omitting the red pepper due to personal preference.  I was a bit worried since I was cooking it right away as some said it was bland and recommended letting the flavors marry for several hours at least.  I needn't have worried though as it was absolutely delicious.  The rest of the mix is made into patties and setting up in the freezer.  I followed someone's suggestion (sorry I forget who!) to spread the meat in a thin layer up the sides of the bowl and then sprinkling  with the combined spices evenly before mixing well.   Thanks so much for this delicious and simple recipe!

2nd time making them: I used the higher fat content ground pork this time (30% fat). That definitely helped, but still these did not taste like the ground breakfast sausage meat you can get at the store. I know that they put MSG in that stuff, which is why I don't want to buy it any more. These sausages just don't get there. There was too much salt and not enough of something else. I will continue my quest of making the perfect breakfast sausage. Next time I will cut the salt in half and perhaps add cayenne pepper. 

1st time making them: The spice mixture needs to be worked out better. I'll have to work with the balance a little bit more. 

Some people wrote they were sweet. That wasn't the case for me. Others raved, but compared to the store bought Tenessee Brand sausage, these didn't compare. It may have been the ground pork I used. I'll go for a higher fat content pork next time. The ground pork I used was lean, and that may have been most of the problem. Either way, I'm not sold yet. I don't want to eat the store brand with all the added MSG and garbage, so I'll have to figure this out.

This is wonderful! It's become my absolute go to anytime we need or want breakfast sausage. I make it with ground chicken, which lowers the fat content significantly. You can't even tell. Just make sure you use a little spray oil in the skillet when cooking since very little fat will render from the meat. The only change I make is to increase the crushed red peppers to a full tsp. Also, after mixing everything w/ the meat I roll it up in saran wrap and drop it in the freezer for about 60-90 minutes. This freezes it just enough for me to make perfect slices. Thank you Lee Fogle!!

I really disliked the clove flavor in this sausage, but the rest of the spices were a pretty good mix. Next time, I'll leave the clove out entirely.

DOUBLE THE RECIPE AND FREEZE. I am a very fussy eater, so I usually buy homemade sausage from the butcher, which can be quite pricey (but worth it - I don't skimp on food quality!). I like this recipe because it gives me the quality that I insist on, and yet it is ridiculously inexpensive to make (especially compared to what I am used to paying for sausage). I have made this recipe at least a dozen times, and I like to double the recipe and freeze portions of it so that it is ready-made for a quick weekend breakfast. I also like to make thin meat patties from the mixture using a restaurant-style burger press. This is a recipe that I will keep for life.

I made this with what I had on hand--omitting the marjoram and cloves.  It was still delicious and made the perfect tasting breakfast sausage. Will make this over and over again. Hopefully next time I will have those two spices on hand to see how it enhances the flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!

EXCELLENT!!  Can't imagine how many calories saved by using a piece of pork we purchased on sale which had so little fat that I actually added a little bit of canola oil just to fry it.  They taste was awesome even though I didn't have any ground cloves.  Thanks so much for a healthier, cheaper alternative to purchased sausage.

I've always bought tubes of sausage from the store and it turns out that I can make it for much cheaper.  Boneless pork loin goes on sale regularly here and I can have my butcher grind it for me.  This recipe is great - I did sub 1 tsp italian seasoning for the marjoram since I didn't have any, but the sausage still came out great!  The spice combo is super yummy and lends itself to lots of recipes.  I like to mix a pound of this sausage with 1/4 C crushed ritz crackers, 1/3 C grated parmesan cheese and 1 whole egg to make to-die-for meatballs.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I'll never need to buy ready made sausage again.  Oh, I also made patties from the other pound of sausage and they were great on english muffins with some cheese.

We moved to Europe and I can't buy any healthy or even good tasting breakfast sausage here.  I made this recipe with good quality local raised pork and it was lean and delicious. It was a bit salty for my taste, but that's easy to fix!  So easy to make extra and freeze for future breakfasts.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

This is a great basic recipe for a well-seasoned, fairly mild breakfast sausage.  I've now made it twice.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly using pre-ground pork from my butcher.  It was good but a bit dry.

The second time, I ground my own pork using 2.5lbs pork shoulder and 1/2lb. added pork back fat.  I also added 1/4 ice water to the mix. I reduced the brown sugar to 2 teaspoons but made no other changes to the seasonings. The taste and texture were perfect for my taste.

The salt was fine for me and the red pepper gave it just a little kick without being too spicy for my family members who don't like spicy foods.  The small amounts of marjoram and cloves enhanced the flavor of the sausage but weren't noticeable on their own.

Of course, the beauty of making your own sausage is that it is so easy to adjust the seasonings to your personal taste.  I suggest trying the recipe as written the first time you make it, but reserve 20% of the seasoning mix.  Fry up a small sample piece and taste it then adjust the seasonings by adding the rest of the mix or adding individual seasonings as desired.

My husband loved these. It was my first attempt and I followed the recipe as written. Next time, I'll cut the recipe in 1/2 but this recipe is a keeper. It was very easy to put together. The only problem I had was it said to cook 5 minutes on each side. I almost burned them. I'll adjust the next time I make them.

A spectacular alternative to prepackaged sausage. I use 1.3 lbs Jenny-O Lean (93%) ground turkey and the same amount of spices, except only half the salt the recipe calls for. Also can be made with the addition of fennel and ground ginger. You won't miss the fat and additives from the store bought sausage. This is a much healthier and just as tasty option for breakfast sausage and any other recipes that call for sausage. I make it several times a week and its guilt free.

I like to make all my sausage with Turkey, because I don't eat pork.I have been on the look out for the perfect "breakfast sausage". Like a lot of people, I don't like "natural flavors, and added preservatives" in commercial turkey sausages. So after many a recipe;I stumbled across this one. Getting the taste just right is always a challenge when working with ground turkey. But this recipe is a total keeper!!!! I can't wait to serve it this weekend!!!

Very good sausage. The sugar works well with the sage. If you like your sausage spicy this is not the recipe for you.

Doesn't seem quite right to review this recipe, as I was unable to follow it exactly. Had neither dried sage, marjoram nor red pepper flakes. But I added lots of minced fresh sage and rosemary. The DH and I agree that it's far better than any sausage I can buy. The subtle flavor of brown sugar and the "hmmmmm. what is that?" touch of clove are perfect with ground pork. Used only half the salt, and it was still a bit over salty for my taste. Could it be because I used kosher salt? I'll never purchase sausage again!

Very good!  I used pork shoulder, but trimmed it pretty well.  I used the sugar, but after trying it, I would omit it next time.  I would also perfer it with more sage.  Letting it sit also makes a big difference.  Either way....much better than store bought! Thanks

Really good. We ground up some pork loin & it wasn't greasy at all. Next time we'll probably use the suggestion of cayenne pepper so the heat is blended better. Also, will mix spice in with smaller amounts of pork & keep adding so it is blended better.

We will NEVER buy store bought breakfast sausage again! This is so much better and not salty like prepackaged sausage (the part we didn't like about store bought). We will use this for everything that calls for sausage - it's THAT good! My husband raved about it and told others about it. That's the seal of excellence right there. :)

Made this tonight to add to my gravy for biscuits and gravy. I cooked ground beef, and then added all the spices and cooked it in some extra water until all the liquid cooked off. I didn't have red pepper flakes, so used a pinch of cayenne pepper. It was very good!

A great recipe that I have used again and again. I have used the recipe as is and I have changed it a bit and it's good every time. I have recently begun using 1 lb. ground pork and 1 lb. ground turkey and added 1/2 tsp of maple flavoring. We have pancakes or waffles EVERY weekend and this sausage stands up alongside my sweet potato pancakes / waffles with grits and brown sugar bacon. I can hardly wait for Saturday morning.

This had a good flavor, but I'm not sure it's worth it unless you have a problem with additives.  Mine were a light color, as compared to supermarket, and seemed to be a little dry.

WONDERFUL!!  I followed the directions exactly then ran into a problem when I discovered I had NO dried sage!  I did have fresh sage so I finely minced that up instead.  It came out fantastic and so full of flavor.  I will definitely make this again!!

I decided to follow the directions as written, and I'm glad that I did. My boyfriend and I LOVED them! We both thought that the recipe as written was great, I guess it just depends on your tastes. What I really loved is that it did not have any of the other...shall I say "stuff"....that is in the prepared breakfast sausage at the store. Thanks for the recipe Lee, we will definitely be making these in the future!

Very Nice!  Can play with seasonings... I didn't put all salt in as it seemed too much... same with the pepper. I added onion powder in place if some of the sage.

This recipe was great! It tastes fabulous, has less additives, and is less expensive than packaged sausage. What's not to love!?!?!

I've been making this for several months now, and we love it.  I use ground turkey and skip the red pepper flakes, we don't like anything spicy.  This recipe is even easier if you don't make the patties, but brown it crumbled.  We then use it in breakfast egg casseroles.  Delicious.

I'm on a strict diet that doesn't allow for any sugar whatsoever and there's sugar in breakfast sausage, so I bought 2.5 lbs of ground pork and added these ingredients minus the brown sugar. It was delicious! I increased the amount of each ingredient by 50-100% which resulted in a mild sausage. Next time I'll leave out the red peppers and increase the salt, sage and black pepper.

Excellent breakfast sausage! The whole family enjoyed this sausage.  I was skeptical at firsts when I read the ingredients list, but it is a perfect blend of spices.  I made this as written and will make it definitely make again!

It's good.  Taste like really fresh store brand sausage with out the fat.  I was looking for a different taste though.  I've had some homemade sausage that woule knock your socks off.  This didn't do that for me.  I use oregano in place of marjoram; I can't tell the difference in taste.

Thank you & halleluyur! I will never make pre-packaged sausage again.  This recipe gave me piece of mind because I could see the  the meat that was used and I sometimes feel that pre-made sausage is a mystery.  It was very tasty for us because we added extra crushed red peps for more spice.  I made extras and put them in the freezer to use another day.  One note when we made these is that these did not shrink much so the size we made in patties was prety much the size they were when they were complete.

For Father's Day brunch, I chose this recipe to go along with a baked egg strata (with cheese & zucchini), and fresh fruit. I'd never before bought plain pork sausage and mixed in my own spices, but I will never buy pre-seasoned bulk sausage again. EVER. I'd always wondered why sausage didn't taste as good as I remember when I was a kid, (I assumed it was becayse today's pork is leaner) but with every bite, this sausage brought me back to 1968. I am not really a sausage person, but I'm probably going to make another batch (in this case, a half recipe was plenty for 4 of us) next weekend. Excellent recipe, Lee, thank you for posting it!

Like other reviewers, I'm supposed to stay away from processed foods, so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  (Who wants to give up sausage?!!)  If I had known how easy it is to make great sausage, I would have made my own long ago.  I thought this recipe was fantastic, although I think next time I'll cut down on the salt.  After reading other reviews, I went a little light on the sage and brown sugar as well.  (I used low fat pork, so the amounts as written might be fine for pork with a higher fat content.)  I think next time I'll add a little fennel, as I love that in sausage, and maybe garlic.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe!

Adding pork to deer or moose meat makes a beautiful moist sausage. Also, fresh ground garlic and honey mixed in is good too. This was a fun, quick tasty recipe.

I live in africa and can't get breakfast sausage - this recipe has made me a VERY happy Peace Corps Volunteer!!  I will admit I change it up a bit, I don't have marjoram here, so I skip it.  I also use 3+ tsp of sage and liquid splenda instead of brown sugar.  I don't measure the pepper or red pepper but I bet I use about double of the red pepper.   So normally I hate to rate a recipe and then list the changes, but the point is that this recipe can be tweaked to your individual tastes with salt, sage, sweetness and heat.  Will make this even when I get back to America!!!

I make this every Sunday for our full breakfast spread.  It's always the first thing to go, even before the waffles!  Make it exactly as written and you shouldn't be disappointed.  *We add a bit more sage just because we love savoury meats*

I'm so happy I found this recipe!  We followed the recipe exactly. We used a pork shoulder, included all of the fat, and it was perfect.  We used the grinder attachment for the Kitchenaid mixer.  We coursely ground 8 pounds and formed it into 1 1/3 pound "logs" and rolled them up in wax paper and placed in a gallon freezer bag.  Now, we can take them out and just slice them into patties.  We will be making this sausage from now on!

We both liked this recipe.  Made as written, and altered for 2 servings, it is quite delicate in flavour and made enough for breakfast with leftovers.  I might be tempted to alter some of the spices next time to increase the flavour, perhaps a little more sage, a bit of nutmeg as another reviewer suggested and maybe a little bit of grated onion. Thank you for taking the time to submit this recipe Lee Fogle, we will certainly be making it again.

This is the BEST sausage I have ever had! My husband loved it, too! He told me to never buy packaged sausage again. I tried to keep it as close as I could to how it was written. Except I didn't have any sage so I subbed for half the amount of italian seasoning and doubled the marjoram. I like maple sausage so I put about a tablespoon of syrup in, too. Absolutely fantastic! I had been wondering what to do with the ground pork that was in my freezer from my uncle-in-law's farm and I'm really glad I used it to make this sausage! It's really annoying to waste really good meat in a really bad recipe! Thanks for posting this!  AWESOME!!! update: I made this with ground turkey this morning and it is just as good. great recipe!!

Lee…this is delicious, and I make my own sausage.  My breakfast sausage is good; this is better.  I used low fat ground pork and added all ingredients without changing.  I did add a couple tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil so that it would cook better in the pan.  The patties came out very moist and just full of flavor.  I am throwing my recipe and keeping yours.  Thank you.

This tasted wonderful and was very quick to prepare. My only complaint was that some patties were better seasoned then others...probably did not mix it well enough. I froze have the patties raw and will fry another time!

Absolutely *delicious*!  Didn't have cloves, so left that out, and substituted a little oregano for the marjoram.  Turned out amazing.  Frying took a long time, though, and obviously is not the healthiest -- I think next time I'll try broiling them, or using the George Foreman.

This recipe is easy and so much healthier than commercially made breakfast sausage (no preservatives or MSG). I mainly use in the "Bill's Sausage Gravy" recipe here at allrecipes (cooked loose instead of in patties). Served over the "JP's Big Daddy Biscuit" recipe and you won't be sorry. Yummy!

i used this recipe in conjunction with the alton brown recipe- used 3 t fresh sage, 3 t fresh thyme and 1 t fresh rosemary, plus more 1/4t red pepper flakes for kick.  let sit overnight to let the flavors meld- and at the end i used a dollop of maple syrup to give it some extra sweetness and moisture.

GREAT, it was fast to prepare and the taste is wonderful like the one you buy at the store but better since you can use lean pork. I serve for breakfast with eggs and also for dinner with steam vegetables.

This has to be the best sausage I've ever tasted.  I get cravings for it and have to make it about once a week on a weekend.  My whole family loves it and I've even passed it on to other relatives who like it just as much as we do.  The only thing I altered, were the amount of spices..I really like a good kick to mine!

This is fantastic! I just made it this morning and it was a hit! I can't believe how good it is. I left out the marjoram & clove (only because I didn't have any) and it still turned out great! Next time, I will add more red pepper flakes to give it some more zing! Some other reviewers changed the amount of spices listed but I followed the listed amounts and the patties turned out wonderful!

I just used this recipe to make the Ultimate Breakfast Casserole on this site.  Now that we live abroad and Jimmy Dean apparently has no passport, I had been wanting something like the breakfast sausage I am used to.  This is it.  Thank you for saving me from experimenting with another mystery-meat sausage/salami from the local stores!

Been looking for a pork sausage recipe for awhile ---tried this one the other day and it turned out great.   So much tastier than store bought pork sausage.  Will be making our own from now on.    Used pork shoulder (butt) roast that was on sale real cheap.

I can't believe how GOOD this is!  I used reduced fat ground pork, made it the night before, and put equally sized balls between two sheets of waxed paper and flattened them with a wide-bottomed glass.  I cut the recipe in half and had 12 regular sized pattys. 

I think it made a difference letting the spices meld overnight.  The kids LOVED it and I can't imagine ever buying a roll of sausage again - this as better flavor and is meatier.  As a matter of fact, if I ever come across a good sale on ground pork I'm stocking up!  I can't wait to try it in my other recipes calling for sauasge.  Thanks for for sharing this Lee.

This is an A+ copy of a very fameous Ohio based brand. Its a huge hit!!! They only changes I made were adding 2tbsp's of pure maple syrup and extra hot pepper flakes. Will make every weekend. Oh btw....I used ground turkey.

I'm in Australia and this is so easy to make. I can finally have my sausage gravy again and I don't have to worry that I don't have packaged sausage again. I like to add extra sage, pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes. It's ok with Brown sugar, but I'll cut that back or do away with it all together. This makes great breakfast sandwiches...put it in breakfast casseroles, and so yummy with Bill's Sausage gravy and J.P.s Biscuits from this site. Yummo!

This morning I prepared this breakfast sausage, but cut the recipe in half.  I already had ground pork sausage, (with grounded up onions and garlic in it) before adding the remaining ingredients your recipe called for.  I substituted ground cayenne red pepper for the crushed red pepper flakes.  I thought the 1 tsp. of sage to the 1lb.
of ground pork was too much.  The next time I will reduce it to 1/2 tsp.  Also, I probably will reduce the amount of marjoram as well.  I liked the brown sugar in the recipe.  Other than that, it was good.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm in Germany where they have an abundance of Schweinehackfleisch (ground pork) but no Bob Evans...My fiance loved a "sausage muffin" with a sausage pattie, egg, and cheese on english muffin for weekend breakfast.  I made this and his reaction was well worth it!!  Very, very yummy :)

I used 2 tsps.dried ground sage for 6 1/2 lbs of ground 95% lean pork.  All other spices I scaled to three times the base recipe.  Outstanding sausage.  I will never by prepared sausage again this was so easy.

Found them OK but lacking a certain flavor - not sure what spice was missing but I don't like sage much so perhaps didn't use enough.

Made this a couple times and it always comes out great.  Read a couple reviews where people did a half pork/half turkey blend so we might try that in the future just to see.  That's one of the things that makes this recipe great - it's easy to customize to your individual taste.

Had a hard time finding all the spices (live in Japan). Clove though is really important to the taste, but don't go over-board, can it can over flavor the sausage.  Its really important to thoroughly crush the spices too. I did not form into patties, Instead, I cooked it as crumbled and once cooked, moved on into making it Gravy for Biscuits and Gravy.

My family is doing the Whole30 diet, so I left out the sugar, but added about 2tsp smoked paprika. I had never made it with the sugar, so I didn't know the difference and it was wonderful. I also increased the sage measurement to 1Tbsp. I believe I added a tad more of the marjoram, as well. Also, I didn't have ground pork, so I used ground beef. This was really yummy and will definitely make this again! I will try this with ground pork, and another batch with ground turkey, but the ground beef was delicious.

I am going to give this 4 stars because you must modify it.   I made it exactly per the recipe and it was very bland.  I took other reviewer's advice and doubled the spices (except for salt) and added some crushed red pepper flakes and fennel.  It is perfect!  My boyfriend asks me to make it all the time and says it tastes better than Jimmy Dean.

One change. Rather than using ground pork, bought a 2 pound pork shoulder blade roast from the fresh meat counter and ground it myself. Low fat content and minimal shrinkage when fried.

Made it exactly as specified except cut the batch in half so I could make any adjustments to suit my personal taste in the second half.   I couldn't wait 24 hours for the spices to marinate into the meat so I fried up one test patty right away. It was fabulous.  I ground my own pork (boneless roast including fat cap), using my Kitchen Aid mixer with fine grinding attachment.  To solve the spice blending issue some reviewers mentioned, I rolled the chunks of pork in the spice blend before putting them in the grinder. This really helped evenly distribute the flavors. This is a definite winner!

I made this with 1/2 ground pork, 1/2 ground turkey and I added some maple syrup to it as well. It turned out real good.

This was really tasty. I made it per the recipe from pork butt that i ground myself. Any excuse to use my new kitchenaid lol! I did cut back the salt after reading some of the reviews.  Then I microwaved a bite-sized bit to try it.  Cutting back the salt was the right thing to do. Added some granulated garlic and onion powder just because my family likes those flavors.

Aside from frying some up with eggs for breakfast, I also ended up using this on a pizza with some sauted apples and onions. I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

Sausage comes in many different flavors for a reason,  some like it hot, some like it sweet, and some like it mild.  Using one recipe to please everyone is impossible, sometimes even in the same household.  For me, this one is pretty close to perfect.  I  adjusted the salt to my liking, but I think that is normal for any recipe.  I found the spices were pleasing and not overwhelming.  Next time I will try adding some fennel.  It's a great base to start from and adjust to your own personal taste.

made this a few times. kept thinking i was doing something wrong if 400 people loved it..

added the same amount of spice to one pound of pork... that is what needs to be done and a pinch of cloves for a lbs of pork for me was a 1/8th of a tea spoon

I really liked this recipe.  Easy to make and msg free.  However I found that the level of spices suggested was not nearly adequate to achieve good flavor for 2 pounds of ground pork.  On my second try I basically doubled the amount of suggested spice and it is now very good, It will need a little fine tuning (a little less than double salt...)but I will use the recipe for breakfast sausage from now on.

I was tired of frozen salty breakfast sausages, the taste is not altogether pleasant.  I tried this by halving the recipe, I did not want to potentially risk wasting two pounds of ground pork. My daughter and I love this recipe.  I  will pass it along to my friends and family.

Very good flavor in this sausage. My kids fought over the last patty! I made this with ground turkey and added a little dried thyme with the other seasonings. Didn't have any brown sugar, so I used agave nectar instead -- if you like maple-flavored sausage, you could easily substitute maple syrup as well. I found the patties difficult to flip, because they tried to break apart. Maybe due to the substitution of liquid sweetener or because I made the patties so thin to make them a larger diameter for breakfast sandwiches. Might try using a bit of egg or milk and oatmeal as a binder next time. Will definitely be making these again!

Great Elk sausage!

My dad and I decided to make elk sausage this year instead of having just stew meat. After endless attempts of finding an "elk specific" recipe that whet my palette, I decided to just go generic on the breakfast sausage. After reading all the reviews, I decided on this one... and wow! We weren't disappointed.

Obviously because we were using wild game, we had to adjust the recipe. 

Here's what we did:
Roughly 10 lbs of freshly trimmed elk meat, chilled
2 lbs pork shoulder
1 lbs pork back fat
2/3 cup sage
1/3 cup kosher salt (cut the ratio in half to the above recipe)
1/3 cup black pepper
1/12 of a cup marjoram
1 cup of sugar (cut the ratio in half to the above recipe)
1/6 cup of red pepper flakes
A good sized pinch (probably 2 teaspoons of cloves)

Ground the elk and the pork separately, then mixed all the seasonings and meat by hand in a large vat. We fried up a bit to make sure we weren't wrapping up 12+ pounds of unappetizing meat and were both very surprised! I think my dad liked it more than me... I would probably add a little more salt and a touch more red pepper flakes, but that's just may palette. Other than that, great recipe and I will definitely be using this recipe again!

P.S. I like the idea of substituting cloves with anise seed. If I do that in the future, I'll be sure to let you guys know!

Happy eating!

The absolute best sausage recipe I've found. I always seem to be missing an ingredient or two. So this batch is short on sage, so I added a little tyme. I didn't have red pepper flake so I subbed a similar amount of ground red pepper. I also threw in a teaspoon of extra brown sugar.

Like others who have commented, I was looking for a homemade breakfast sausage recipe and tried this one. The result was excellent. A great blend of spices, great texture, and taste. As I am only cooking for two of us, I froze the extra patties - they were easy to defrost and cook and tasted great. If you are looking for a delicious tasting, easy to make homemade breakfast sausage, I highly recommend this recipe.

We live where we can not buy breakfast sausage. We can't always get the pork either but the recipe works great for ground chicken too. We do like an extra kick so we add a little more spice too. It really is wonderful.

I have to say this is one of the best sausages I have had to date.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I adjusted the recipe up for a 7lb boston butt, and it really is savory, and the red pepper just adds flavor, not really much heat.  I love how the brown sugar compliments the subtle heat at the end.  Bravo, this is a keeper!

This is the second time I use this recipe and it is amazing! I recommend seasoning the meat the night before and add an extra tsp of sage and majoram for more flavor. I used ground turkey and it is delicious!

Being a Georgia girl transplanted to Northern Ontario, I have been in a 10 year search for good breakfast sausage like I could get back home.  I will search no more!  I left out the sugar and cloves, because I don`t like sweet sausage and this was perfect without it!

I made this recipe up last Saturday and tried it for Su nday brunch.  AWESOME!  The second batch I reduced the salt about 25%.  Double AWESOME!!  This recipe suits my taste perfectly.

Absolutely delicious.  Great flavor and made without all the garbage they put into store-bought sausage.  I definitely think you get better results if you let the raw sausage mixture sit in the fridge at least overnight to let the flavors integrate.  If I were to change anything, I would amp up the sage.  I'll use this recipe every time I make sausage.

I made this wonderful recipe exactly as is (using regular minced pork not the low fat pork) and no digestion issues!  These are without doubt the tastiest sausages I've ever had. It's so quick, cheap and easy too. I formed them into short fat fingers and wrapped half of the batch in streaky bacon then put them on the BBQ and brushed them with plum sauce...YUM - I'll never buy sausages again!

I've been buying bulk sausage links from a wholesaler thinking I would try to get my family to eat better.  Well, as my bacon loving daughter and husband would rather have bacon over sausage, my efforts to eat a tad bit healthier have avoided me.  I thought I would give this a try in hopes that they might jump on the band wagon.  I think it worked!  I wasn't sure how straight turkey would work, so after reading other reviews and seeing other people use straight turkey, I decided to give this a whirl.  I took 20 sausage links and removed them from the casings, (a little labor intensive, but I had some time to kill, I need to look into buying ground turkey in bulk without the casings) added all the seasonings to the turkey and mixed well.  I didn't have marjoram and saw that another viewer used Italian seasoning, so that is what I used.  I didn't add quite 1TBSP of brown sugar, but I think I will next time.  I did add the 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes and I think I might just throw in a pinch next time.  It was a little spicy, but it was still good (dipped in a little syrup from the French toast, and it was heaven on my fork).  I didn't let it sit overnight, but I will next time. Very good recipe, I will be making this from now on for my breakfast sausage.

This is a great recipe! I wanted to stop eating packaged sausage (even though it is delicious) because I felt like corn syrup, sugar, and MSG weren't really necessary. I used 95% lean ground pork so they were a little dry, but still very flavorful and I felt good about eating them. I didn't have marjoram so I used oregano and thyme. I also doubled the amount of red chili flakes because I like it hot!

I made these last night and loved them. I used chicken it was low in fat so I fried them in butter. very yummy! I also put in twice as much of all the spices because chicken has a lot less flavor than pork.

Made it per recipe.  I'm not a professional cook but this was easy. Bought 2.5lbs of lean pork for $5.00 and a couple other ingredients I didn't have.  Mix it up and in a few short minutes I had some very good sausage. Cooked some scrambled eggs and with toast. That was dinner. I love to BBQ and I make my own seasoning and when I saw this recipe I had to try it. You can't go wrong with this. Enjoy. Thanks for the recipe

I am and American living in Canada. The breakfast sausage up here is bland to me. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. I have also used ground chicken to make this recipe. It turned out OK. I mix my spices like it says but I throw my pork into my kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook attached and mix it on low.

Tried this - this morning.  I thought it was better than anything I could have purchased...and, without any add'l preservatives etc.  Easy, tasty, yep I'll be making this again.  Husband liked it too and I crumbled a few patties into my baked egg cups I prepare for the week.  5 stars!

Better than store bought. Added a little mapoline for a maple flavor and it was great. Will make again and again.

Made an adjusted version of this. No brown sugar since I'm trying to avoid added sugar. No cloves b/c I just don't like the taste & no red pepper b/c I want to give some to my baby girl.
Halved the recipe for 1lb of ground pork and AWESOME. Tastes so much better than store bought highly processed stuff. I'll never buy store bought prepared stuff again.

I make this using 2tbsp. of real maple syrup and a little honey instead of the 1tbsp.of brown sugar and me and the family love it. I also stuff the sausage into casings and freeze the links in food saver bags all portioned out for breakfast. It's delicious.

Really good recipe. I don't want the MSG in my sausage either, so I make my own. I like mine a little heavier on the sage and red pepper flakes. Tried it with ground turkey only and it was too bland. I have to get organic ground pork from Whole Foods, but that's ok. I will used this recipe again!

Great recipe. I am happy to find a recipe that I can now make my own breakfast sausage and no longer have to buy them. I used all the recipe measurements when it came to the seasonings but I did only use 1 lb of meat. I like flavor so this was perfect for me. I did add a pinch of garlic powder and cinnamon to the mixture as well. Other than that no changes.

I think this recipe was waaaaay too salty.  For my taste it had enough spices.  I added a little ground fennel so maybe that's what made mine tastier.  the heat from the red pepper was just right.  I'll make this again but with half the salt next time.

I was skeptical that the seasonings on this recipe would be either much too mild to make the grind taste like anything other than ground pork or too sweet but this is a fantastic balance.  I made it as is scaling up the recipe with my own ground pork grind (5lbs ground butt, 1 lb pork fat trimmings about 3/4 cups chopped fatty raw bacon.)   I gave the meat and fat a grind together, mixed these spices in, then gave it another grind all using my coursest filter.   The sausage is fantastic.  Slightly sweet and well spiced I would call it a mild breakfast sausage with great flavor.   If you wanted to up the heat I would increase the red pepper.

I tried this with 1/3 pork, 2/3 turkey. Really tasty. I respectfully suggest starting with half the recommended amount of salt and frying up a sample to taste before adding more.

This is a good combination of sweet and spicy. I had just a small amount of fresh ground turkey breast and didn't know what to do with it. I mixed all ingredients, adding a little extra crushed red  pepper flakes, and scrambled the sausage with eggs. Yum!

This recipe is delicious!  No more store bought breakfast sausage.  If you use fresh sage, do not add the salt to the recipe.  It becomes too salty.

This recipe is great for me since I am an American living overseas and unable to get REAL breakfast sausage! So now I make it, with a few adjustments for my family (we're not chili fans, we prefer maple sausage) and we get great sausage for breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, easy, and fast! Why buy sausage when you can brag about your own homemade? Everyone will be impressed that you made it, since most people think there is magic involved in the process of making sausage.

I love sausage, but i hate paying almost 4 bucks for 1 16oz roll...i had been looking at this recipe for sometime now because of all the great reviews. The only thing that kept me from making it is that i could never find majoram in the stores!!! I finally came across it at a store i don't shop at very often. Even after buying it, it still sat on the shelf with all my other spices for a few weeks! Well this morning i really was in the mood for sausage and i didn't have any of the store bought kind so i decided to give this recipe a try AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID! I loved this sausage, the perfect amount of spices, SO GOOD! I did not add the brown sugar at all because i don't like sweet sausage...the only thing that i can say that i hated was that i didn't try this recipe sooner! I will never pay for breakfast sausage again! Talking about it makes me want to go make more!!! Lol thank you so much for this recipe, there is no need to go look for any other...THIS IS MY FIRST TIME EVER MAKING IT AND I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS RECIPE AGAIN AND AGAIN! THANKS AGAIN!

Great recipe.  I am an American living in Denmark.  Although they are one of the biggest consumers and exporters of pork products, I find there are a couple types of sausages I miss that we just can't get here.  American breakfast sausage is among them.  All of my expat friends love this.  If I ever move back to the US, I would only make this.  Move over Jimmy Dean, you aren't even in the same league!  I often make this using chicken instead of pork.  The only thing I do differently is add a splash of maple syrup to make it perfect.  Thank you for this recipe.

Holy cow this was good!!!  I'll never buy breakfast sausage again.  I used ground turkey and didn't have any marjoram and the were still amazing.  We were saying they might be good with a little chopped up apple in them so I'll try that next time.  I would also like to add a little more sage (I really like sage).  Definitely a "make it again", as my daughter said.

This is a fantastic recipe exactly "as-is". Thank you for sharing it, Lee!

I made a few variations in subsequent batches, which were great, too.
~ Substitute clove for 1 1/2 tsp fennel seed
~ Substitute red pepper flakes for a pinch of ground red pepper.

Thank you, Thank you, we have been trying to find a breakfast sausage recipe and this one is great.  We ate it right away and the flavors were mild, believe the seasonings will be stronger in the morning.  We used beef as we do not eat pork, looking forward to trying turkey.

I didn't exactly follow this recipe, b/c I just don't. BUT I got a great understanding of which herbs to use & the reviews showed me that people can make their own sausage for real.

They came out really good, missing a little something, but I'm not sure what. Also I should have added more salt - but it's not the recipe's fault, I didn't measue.
Here's what I did..
I used about a pound of chicken thighs, I skinned and boned them and threw them into the food processor until they were pretty mushy. 
I added ABOUT a teaspoon of salt and pepper, some sage - fresh from the garden - I put about 6 leaves finely shopped, marjoram (dried - I'll have to grow this stuff next year - the dry seemed almost flavorless, but I bet fresh is powerful. I'll probably have to add less of it fresh...) I added what I thought was about 1/8 tsp of the peppers, and I went heavy on the cloves. I used 2tsp granulated brown sugar b/c that's what I had and about 2-3 tsp of honey. I mixed it all in the food processor. 
I fried some of the first run right away (no need to add oil to the pan, these babies were NOT dry like I worried they'd be.) Then I adjusted the mixture to add the honey and more cloves. If you fry up a tiny bit at a time, you can adjust the recipe to get it just the way you want. 

I can't thank the poster enough. I'm no longer handcuffed to those expensive chicke sausages that are SOMEtimes in the market!

Next time, I'll to add maple syrup, and shred edapples for another batch.

We like it, but it is missing something. I increased the spices slightly, adding a little fennel seed and liquid smoke (for a hickory flavour). Will read through the reviews for more input on how to improve these. I did use a lean pack of ground pork, and I think this too may have affected the flavour.

Great seasoning and so easy! I substituted 2 lbs. of ground chicken for the pork. I thought I could cut back on the salt, so I only used 1 1/2 teaspoons, but next time I will use the full 2 tsps. I also used 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes, next time I will use a full tsp because I like spicy sausage.

Have made this twice now. I use 80/20 ground pork as  we found the 85/15 a little too dry.  If you want to use it to make sausage and gravy, use 75/25 or 70/30 if you can find it.  Otherwise you will need to add oil to the pan to make gravy. The only changes I make is leaving out the brown sugar (we do not like sweet sausage)and putting in half as much salt as recommended.  To be sure that the spices are evenly mixed, I sprinlkle a small amount of the spice mix on the top of the pork, turn the pork over, sprinkle a little more, and then mix it with my hands.  I repeat this two or three times.  Comes out perfectly blended. I make it into sausage patties (6 per pound) and put them in the freezer for at least a day or two to let the flavors meld. Everyone likes this.  A good recipe for people with food allergies as you know exactly what is in it.

So good. I subbed the pork for turkey but it was made perfect when I doubled the sage and bumped up the marjoram to a rounded tsp. That makes it 5 stars. I am glad to finally not have to buy sausage anymore.

YUMM-MMMY!  This is some good sausage.  I have used this recipe with ground chicken and it amazed my family at how it could taste better than the sausage that we buy at the store.  And...there is no preservative or any of the other additives when you make it at home.
Since this recipe makes 2lbs, we are able to use this for more than just one meal.

This is perfect.  I can't believe I MADE SAUSAGE!  Hope it freezes well.  Went to Costco, bought bone-less pork sirloin roasts, and experimented with one.  Used 2 lbs pork, 1 lb turkey and decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 tablespoon.  DH never says "it's fine like it is" but he did this time.  (I made 2tiny patties, and fried them up to see if I need to make any changes.  Not one thing!  Used the Food Saver and now have 4 pks of sausage ready when I am.

Pretty darned good stuff!  Just don't overdo the cloves like i did the first time i made this.  Also, i added a tad bit of basil and some black pepper the second time around and it was very, very good!  I added the basil because i was short on sage and felt like i needed to make up for it.  Whether or not it made a big difference doesn't really matter as long as the taste came out alright in the end - and it certainly did.  Thanks, Lee...we won't be buying sausage from the store any more.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made it exactly as written the first time around.  The second time, I used 1 tablespoon of pure maple syrup in place of the brown sugar.  I liked this a bit better.  Thank you, Lee, for the great recipe!

Excellent! I was a little worried about strength of flavor, because until I started to cook it, there wasn't much of an aroma. While I was adding some fennel, a malfunction in the cap of the spice jar dumped much more than what I wanted (about 2 Tbsp), and it still turned out really tasty. I made this to put in chili, but out of curiosity I reserved about an ounce to try on its own - I was very pleased with it. Much better than buying sausage at the market. And I know exactly what's in it. I think I will try adding some maple syrup next time as another reviewer suggested, or maybe more sage, because I like that flavor.

I've made this a dozen times since Thanksgiving 2010 and my wife and kids love it. I like store bought sausages but this tastes better, and knowing what's in it will keep me making this recipe.  A little maple syrup adds a nice touch. I also like to add crushed rosemary. Also, bump up the quality by using fresh herbs (sage or rosemary), but you just need to add half as much again as the recipe calls for.

Made as directed.  Crumbled, browned and used as a topping for our homemade pizza.  The rest, I will make into patties.  Great recipe that you can adjust to your individual tastes.

There are no American-style breakfast sausages here in Ireland so I have saved this recipe for months and finally used it this past weekend to add to stuffing I was making for a 'belated' Thanksgiving.  The sausage came out SO delicious and will definitely be a new addition to my rotation.  Thank you so much for this.  (note - I didn't have cloves and they still came out great...) Thanks Lee!

This recipe was fabulous.  I had no sage, but did add a bit of garlic and onion powder and used a bit of maple syrup instead of brown sugar.  I will never buy commercially-made sausage again!  Thanks for the recipe, Lee!

Made this recipe as stated. Formed into patties and stored each patty between squares of freezer paper and then into a Ziplock bag for freezer storage. We transfer the patties individually into the fridge the night before cooking them. Exceptional flavor and texture, even with lean ground pork.

Yum! We had a pig butchered & had a ton of sausage. I didn't like the taste of it plain but this made it great, was looking for something like this. Great! I did use only a tsp of salt after I made it 1st time- it was too salty for us. Otherwise Fantastic!

A very good sausage recipe.  Being on a health kick, I used half ground turkey.  I am a big fan of Tim Horton's Sausage & Egger up here in Canada and I wanted to find a homemade version of the sausage.  I think next time I make it, I will add more hot spice as I would like a bit of a zing to it.  Thanks for the recipe.  Oh and I liked the rolling pin idea, except they shrunk to 3 inch diameter - they looked so cute.

I really liked it, but I wasn't a big fan of the cloves.  The smell overpowered the blended taste.

Excellent! I have made this several times. I refuse to purchase the pre-made sausage at the store with all the chemicals and msg in it. I follow the receipe exactly with the exception of using real maple syrup instead of brown sugar to make it even healthier. I try to eliminate all refined sugar from my diet.  Excellent taste! My son cannot get enough of this. I also like to add it to the sausage casserole from this site. Yumm!!

I was having a problem this morning because I didn't go to the store yesterday and was out of eggs, bacon, etc... I had some ground pork and decided to make sausage and homemade biscuits and used this recipe as my guide as it's been some time since I've made sausage.  It was excellent.  My daughter has never cared for sausage but she ate two patties as said it was wonderful.  My only addition was to add a tad of crushed fennel. I am in China and am experiencing culinary challenges due to the lack of ingredients that I am accustomed to and am finding that homemade "anything" is far superior.

As a Vermonter, I couldn't help but substitute maple syrup for the brown sugar. It's amazing. My family requests this every weekend & it's so easy to mix & cook that they get it!

Sausage as sausage should be!  Excellent blend of herbs and spices.  I used half ground turkey (93/7%) and half ground pork (which was nice and lean).  I used maybe a tad more of this or that seasoning, but I  followed the recipe pretty closely.  Good-bye Jimmie Dean!!

This sausage is delicious.  We made 60 pounds in 10 pound batches.  It tastes better than store bought.  Not over powering at all.  My whole family loves it. The only change we made was to substitute cayenne pepper for the crushed red pepper.

Seriously how good is this sausage!!?? Ever since we moved home from the States I've been on a mission to fill that culinary hole left by all that wonderful food (not redily available in Australia), but when you find a recipe like this you wonder why you bothered buying it even when it was available! It's so easy. Since there are only 2 in our household I make a big batch and freeze it in to smaller batches (more about watching our intake than not being able to eat it all). Defrosts really easily and voila! REAL breakfast sausage in an instant. Definitely worth a go if you're considering it. Now if I could just find an easy gravy recipe...:)

While this is incredibly tasty, both my husband and I agree this recipe is a great starting point for breakfast sausage. Which is why I gave it 4 stars. We'll definitely make it again, but make some changes. Like more heat....maybe some cayenne, and less sage. It was tasty though, and worth making!

These breakfast sausages are wonderful.  Served them to company and had to give them the recipe.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to mix the ingredients the day before, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This is really good.  I add a pinch more of everything except brown sugar and cloves to a 1 lb. pkg of pork.  Using lean pork will result in drier patties.  1 lb. made 9, 2 1/2 - 3" patties/4 servings for me.

I used to use Jimmy Dean sausage for everything because it added such a zesty flavor to everything from pasta to pizza. When I ran out of Jimmy Dean, I tried this recipe to spice up some diet lean ground beef. It was awesome! Just as good as Jimmy Dean! I'm making my own sausage from now on with this recipe - much healthier and cheaper.

Wow, this was so good!  So easy to do and such a nice flavor- just like sausage you buy, but so much better because you know what's in it.  Tastes fresher too.  I usually don't like sausage and I had 3 small patties at dinner (we had b-fast for dinner) and another one as a bedtime snack!  Lol.

Let me begin by saying I made half of this recipe just because I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about it.  Turns out my family was quite pleased with this one.  I did however make some changes to the recipe.  I added a 1/4 teaspoon of crushed fennel and a small Fuji apple diced finely to the pork mixture.  For the most part, we were very pleased.  The only spice change I will make the next time will be to add a 1/4 teaspoon more salt.  I made it the night before so that the flavors would have time to mingle with the meat.  This is a keeper and just as good as most sausage roll meat I have purchased!

I used rather lean pork for this so it was a little healthier. The flavor was kind of mild so next time I think I will increase the amount of spices otherwise it was excellent. Much better than store-bought.

These had the perfect amount of spices, and tasted very much like McDonald's breakfast sausage but in a great way. 
I think next time I would buy less sausage and make the patties smaller, because they were the size of hamburgers, and took a lot longer to cook than the recipe stated.  (possibly my own mistake, I doubled the recipe)
Everyone loved them.

I used ground turkey to save fat and upped the red pepper a bit. Hubby liked it, cooked it as bulk sausage with gravy over biscuits.

This came out pretty good, but not as tasty as the store bought that you have no idea what's in them... next time I would make the patties thinner than I thought was ideal this time.. I'll try this again and add more seasonings or something crafty.

We bought a 4H hog and had it butchered locally. This year I asked that they not freeze the ground pork, and I made my own sausage. I made 18 pounds of this recipe, not changing a thing. It is very very nice. Next time I might substitute cayenne papper for the red pepper flakes so that flavor is more evenly distributed.

This sausage has the savory flavor of sage, that's not overpowering. Wonderful combination of flavors and aroma.

This was very good although I did change it and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar because my family likes sweet sausage which caremelizes as it fries.

My husband loves to grind our sausage from a pork loin after trimming the fat. This recipe was wonderful. He may add some extra spices next time to kick it up a bit.

Have made this several times now.  First time, by recipe, turned out okay but not quite my taste desire for sausage.  Since then I am happier with it by doubling the sage,  leaving out the brown sugar, and added a tablespoon of canola oil to make it hold patty shape and cook more evenly.  Good point to start to make your sausage at home and avoid the preservatives in grocery offerings.

I love this recipe! I made mine into little meatballs and added them to soup with a chicken stock base & other veggies and frick it was good. Sausage soup...yum! Anyways, I've used this mix a lot now. it's very versatile. p.s. I've only tried it with ground turkey, not pork.

Wonderful flavor and lean made from loin. I have to use a tablespoon of lard to fry. I sprinkle additional sage to get that southern homemade country flavor. I also double grind for good texture.

If the recipe doubled all of its spices I would give this 5 stars but as is it is lacking flavor. I have never had cloves in a breakfast sausage before but it really added to the flavor . We ended up doubling all of the spices and made 30lbs. of sausage..Delicious!

I had pork roasts in my freezer from when we butchered a hog.  I ground up 8 pounds of pork, hoping I would like the recipe.  It is delicious!  I added a little extra of each spice, just because we like things spicy, but it was good!!

I made this last night with a pound of turkey as I’m on WW and wanted a healthier option. I grounded it up and put it into my breakfast hash. My husband said he couldn’t even tell the difference between the breakfast sausage I buy and this one! He thought mine was better! I added a little syrup after it was cooked before mixing it into my hash. Super delicious! I will definitely use again!

Excellent recipe. Definitely taste like a fresher version of the store bought patties. I didn't expect it to be so good from a few ingredients, and I don't think it needs more ingredients. Additions such as fennel or other Italian herbs, IMO, would ruin this. Sometimes simple is all it takes, otherwise you'd be making Italian sausage (which some people are actually using this recipe as a base for)

Some slight differences I made. I mixed 50/50 ground pork and ground turkey, which I don't think compromised the flavor at all. I questioned the use of red pepper flakes as that wouldn't disperse well in 2 pounds of meat, so I converted it to 1/8 tsp ground cayenne. I converted a "pinch" of ground cloves to 1/8 tsp because, seriously, a "pinch" is different to everyone. That's enough for them to serve their intended purpose as very subtle flavors.

Could it be better? I think being more generous with the measurements (instead of being exact like I did) or slightly decreasing the amount of meat by 1/4 pound would boost the flavor more, but the recipe as it stands is fantastic.

I followed the advice of others that said to double the spices and it was perfect. I also wanted to double the recipe - we took these camping -for easy breakfast as I precooked them. Then froze them! I only had ground chicken so I Used that with the ground pork. I felt that lightened them up a little and I’ll do that next time...there will def be a next time. My family and friends loved them. I also baked them. Perfect.

I loved the list of spices. I doubled the brown sugar and I didn't have crushed red pepper so I used 1/2 tsp of cayanne.  I also slightly increased the amount of sage. I tried the wax paper trick that someone mentioned but it didn't work for me; everything stuck to the wax paper. Maybe I need to find better wax paper...  There is no doubt that this recipe needs to include a "rest period", as all the flavors seem to show themselves after about 24 hours.   
I sooo live this recipe, especially since I live in Chile and breakfast sausage is 100% unheard of and unavailable. This is my second go and I will keep making it every time I run out.

I made a couple very very small changes that for me anyways made this recipe way way tastier!  I swap the black pepper out for white pepper, and add 1 tsp of fennel seed per 2lbs of pork.  The fennel was a huge upgrade in taste!

So nice to be able to make my own breakfast sausage. I made this recipe with 1/2 pork and 1/2 chicken thighs. My wife really likes the patties, nothing weird in them like store bought sausage.

Good strong flavor. I cooked scrambled eggs after pouring of some of the grease out of the pan. You just have to let the pan cool down a little bit first so they don't burn.

I'll never buy Jimmy Dean sausage again.  The ground pork we get is lean, making this a leaner sausage.  The flavor is excellent, and it is easy  to make.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My daughter has been craving breakfast sausage for about a week. Going through my deep freeze today I came across 5 packages of ground pork that just were not getting used. This seasoning recipe, is Hands down, the best breakfast sausage I’ve ever eaten! And sooo easy to make! The only change I made was substituting Oregano for the Marjoram as I did not have any marjoram. I will be making this recipe from now on instead of buying pre-seasoned breakfast sausage. Thanks for an outstanding recipe!!

Made it and messed it up, open the wrong end of the clove and it came pouring out, what I could save it was ok. Will be making it again soon.  Will update later.

Awesome! I chose to do 1/2 ground turkey and it turned out amazing. It did have a kick so tread lightly on red pepper flakes if you don't like too spicy (like my family). I may do a spicy batch separately. Froze some bulk and did pattys. Highly recommend!

I didn’t have any marjoram so I had to leave that out. This is a basic breakfast sausage recipe that was very easy to make. I used a small pork loin roast without a lot of fat and just ground that up and added the seasonings per the recipe. Theflavor was good but probably would have been even better if I had let the flavors meld overnight. I will make this again and do plan to give the seasonings some time to permeate the meat.

Loved this recipe but I did increase the spices by 50%. Very tasty with the sweetness of the brown sugar. Made this out of ground pork from our own pigs which is pretty lean. I used the grease to make gravy and it was awesome.
I gave it 4 stars because I had to increase the spices.

I substituted venison for the pork.  80% venison to 20% pork fat.   Doubled the amount of flaked red pepper for a bit more bite and it is excellent.  

Using a grinder I added the ground venison and pork fat to mix them well.  Then I hand mixed in the spices to the venison/fat mix.  Ran it through the grinder again for the final ground sausage and then made it into patties.

Thank you for another great way to enjoy and share my harvest.

The sample was a little bland and too salty.  I increased the sage and red pepper.  The rest of the batch was better.  Will use less salt on the next batch.  Thanks for the recipe.  We won't be buying ready made sausage anymore.

This is my go-to recipe for making breakfast sausage. I have made it many times, and each time I make a lot (like 30 pounds) and freeze it. Letting it sit in the freezer for a month or so only enhances the flavor. I make it as is, except for the addition of maple extract because my family likes the maple flavor. We love it plain made into sausage patties, made into biscuits and gravy, or in a breakfast casserole.

What can I say ...... just the right base recipe to kick off any meal with a bit of altering for whatever occasion meal! This last meal I added ground fennel made into patties for a bagel breakfast sandwich. Next round I'll spice it up for a shrimp boil as sausage mini rounds!

Great recipe for a quick and easy breakfast sausage. This one always gets compliments from guests, although I’d like it better with a tad more kick. Have made this a number of times now leaving the spice ratios as is and simply swapping out 1/2 of the ground pork for ground turkey.

I moved to Ecuador in 2011 and they do not know what breakfast sausage is.  I found a recipe similar to this and everyone said it is better than Jimmy Dean’s.  The recipe I use does not call for the cloves or the marjoram.  So if ya don’t have those ingredients, you will still get an awesome sausage!

Awesome! Spice is just right.  We made a ground turkey sausage gravy, it was perfect! Will use this spice combo again.

I made these as written, except I used half pork and half turkey. They are very good! Not dry at all. Next time I make them I plan to cut the salt and sage both by half. Both were too strong for me.

I tried this using the spice amounts per the recipe, but it turned out pretty bland. The next batch I doubled everything but the cloves and salt and it turned out great.

This was okay just a little bland.  I added 1/2 tsp. of ground fennel seeds to 1 pound ground pork along with half of the other ingredients.  I didn't use any red pepper flakes because I'm a wuss.  I have a better tasting (to me) recipe that I will continue to use.

I did modify a little by doing half turkey and half pork. Husband and I liked this recipe but agreed we wanted more spice the next time. I got 20 patties the first time making this. Can't  wait to make again

Recipe seems to be good, but my meat was a bit too fatty I guess. Next time I'll try leaner pork.
Another mistake for me was adding maple syrup - totally unnecessary here.

I made these with ground turkey and they were very good. I would like to know how many patties it makes, though. "6 servings", without saying what is a serving, doesn't tell me much.

Very nice mild seasoning blend that should appeal to a wide range of  folk.  I use many different spice blends depending on my intended use of the finished product and this is nice and safe if you are making sausage for a very large group.  
A couple of  additions I would add to the way this is written (it may have been noted in some review already)  No matter what sausage you are making, FRESH spice is really important. And after mixing is done, it makes a real difference to let the batch rest in refrigeration for 24 hours minimum before RE-MIX and use or package to freeze....

i made it as the recipe but i thought it lacked spices, overall a good base recipe but next time i'll be adding more spice. i was looking for a good homemade sausage, and i liked it just needs some more spice. i did let the meat and spices blend overnight as recommended.

The first time I made this I made it exactly as per the recipe and it was very good, but I thought I could've used a bit more flavor. Since I'm only cooking for two I usually use 1 pound of ground pork and use the same amount of spices that the recipe calls for with 2 pounds, this seems to do the trick for me.  One thing I love best about this recipe is how extremely quick & easy it is  to make. It is also very easy to play around with by varying spices for different flavors. I usually add about 1/4  teaspoon fennel seed per pound and about 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon thyme. If you like maple syrup I highly recommend you substitute that for the brown sugar called for in the recipe, yummy.   I can get 12 patties out of 1 lb. This  is so much better than buying the premade sausage at the supermarket. I highly recommend this recipe.

These were fantastic. The only reason I didn't give a full five stars was because I tweaked it a little based on my family's taste.  I didn't want a huge sage-y taste so I cut that in half. I think I also cut the sugar in half. Next time, I will also be cutting down on the salt a little. I also added a few extra red pepper flakes.

Good flavor! It tasted like a nice restaurant sausage but without all of the preservatives. I did make one change as I am trying to be sugar free. I used a little erthryitol/stevia blend (THM Super Sweet) instead of the brown sugar. I am sure it would be excellent with the brown sugar, but like I said, I am trying to go sugar-free.

I used 1 lb of ground pork so I halved the recipe and added about 1/2 to 1 (+/-)  tsp of garlic, about 1/2 tsp thyme, omitted the salt and used chili pepper instead of the red pepper flakes.  VERY good!

I've been making this spice blend for a while now. I quadruple the recipe (minus the salt, I add salt separate from the spices) and keep it in the refrigerator for anytime I want to add some spice to any meat. I use it as breakfast sausage; I season the meat for spaghetti, and  I spice the meat for biscuits and gravy among other things. I've used it with ground pork, ground hamburger and ground chicken/turkey. As others have mentioned, the recipe as it is is a bit mild. I double the recipe -- or use the amount in the recipe and halve the amount of meat -- and the taste is quite good.

I've been on a search for homemade breakfast sausage and this is the closest to the flavor I want. It's good, but something is still missing. I'll follow the most helpful critical review and double all spices except salt and cloves, not a fan of this spice but I think it's needed, and see how that works. Appreciate you giving me a great base to work from!

Love this recipe!  I have a person in the house that doesn't eat anything but chicken so was looking for something to turn ground chicken into breakfast sausage.  This was perfect.  I highly recommend it and it works well with chicken too!

Excellent results, and very flavorful. I cut the salt in half by using Kosher salt, and used 1 teaspoon Summer Savory + 1 teaspoon Sage, instead of 2 teaspoons Sage. Next time I would cut the salt in half again. These are personal preferences, and no negative reflection on the recipe as written. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made these but used 1 lb of ground pork and 1 lb of ground turkey and doubled the brown sugar.  They are awesome to freeze and have ready to make breakfast sandwiches on the go.

I cut the sage in half because we're not big fans and used half ground chicken and half ground park -- otherwise made exactly according to the recipe.  VERY good!

This is a great recipe! But you definitely want to DOUBLE all the seasonings. (I used just a tiny pinch of red pepper since I have a two-year-old that will be eating them). Other than that, it's delish. Even my mom and husband liked them and they "don't really like breakfast sausage".... because they are insane.

Locally, we have very few choices of ground pork. I used a name brand (F. J. Extra Lean) and it was too dry for the first patty. I added some oil and ended up with much more success in forming the patties and getting them to brown. I cooked half as patties to freeze and half as crumbled to use in a breakfast casserole. Terrific recipe and thanks for sharing.

I used 1/2 pork, 1/2 venison. I thought it a bit bland, I added more hot pepper, black pepper and sage, plus a bit of thyme. I read the back of the store bought, and following it added a bit of citric acid, which I had left over from making bath bombs. I also added some powdered milk to improve the texture. I don't know where they are getting 6 servings for 2 lbs of meat! I got 12. I made them 1.3 oz precooking, to make them similar in size to store bought.

I added twice as much crushed red peppers and twice as much brown sugar to my caribou brat's mix. It is really tasty and one of the best breakfast sausage I have ever had.

I think that this is a good recipe. However I would like to stress that one key factor should be included with the  ingredients. And that is, make sure when you buy your ground pork that it has a good amount of fat. Otherwise you sausage will be extremely dry. And ruin this Good Recipe.

I have been using this recipe for years and just found out it's amazingly delicious with ground chicken so my family prefers the ground chicken then ground beef. And it's a lot healthier.

I love this recipe! Tastes like the store bought breakfast sausage but I know it's a lot healthier and really good for my family.  I will never buy breakfast sausage from store anymore since this recipe is so easy to prepare and I will recommend it to anyone looking for a good breakfast sausage recipe.  It's part of my family's daily breakfast.

Happy to have found a way to use other ground meats and flavor them like sausage. I was actually looking for a sausage recipe (to use in spaghetti sauce) that didn't use fennel - jackpot! Since this was a for-dinner sausage, I substituted paprika and garlic powder (1 teaspoon each) for the sugar and cloves. I mixed all the spices and stirred then into the ground beef and fried it. Was very good! Thanks for the recipe.  Will have to try the breakfast version sometime too.

When I made this the first time 2 tsp of salt is way too much for me, and I had to throw them out. I reduced the salt to one tsp and added a pinch of garlic powder and they were really good.

It's a good sausage. I swapped a combination of honey and maple syrup for the brown sugar for dietary reasons. It worked great. My husbands a hunter so I used 1 part port to 2 parts venison. I'm going to try this again and put it in casings.

Delicious with hints of sweet and savory.  I left out the brown sugar and added 1-2 T orange zest.  One half  the recipe yields 6 patties.

Love this basic recipe, but I've never had all the ingredients on hand so I cheat, substituting where needed.  But it always turns out great even with a subbed ingredient here and there.

I made it as is without the brown sugar (hate sweet taste or I would add maple syrup) - cooked a bite sized piece and it was good but needed a tad more sage. Added and will refrigerate overnight. Very good starter recipe (if you have a Cuisinart and not the grinder, invest). We save a ton of money and control the freshness by buying whole meat and grinding everything we need.

added fennel, recommend puncturing center before cooking so won't curl.

Made this using grass-fed pork loin that I ground using Kitchen-Aid stand mixer with grinder attachment.  Following what at least one other reviewer suggested, I doubled the sage (sausage has got to have lots of sage!), brown sugar, salt and put more than a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I skipped the cloves because I don't like them.  This was a BIG hit with our family.  I also chilled the entire mixture in the refrigerator for about 18 hours to let the flavors develop.  Though I used the fattiest part of the pork loin, I found I needed to add just a bit of oil to the pan when browning.  I might try cutting it with a bit of uncured pork belly to increase the fat content.  otherwise, very good!

I halved the recipe.  I followed the recipe with maybe a little more sage and  crushed red pepper.   I didn't know the ground pork I was using from Walmart had additives.  It turned out a little .more salty than I would have liked, but it was still really very good.  I will definitely  use this recipe again and will share it with others.  The other  pound of meat I used to make a recipe of a company ...Penz...It was okay, but not as good.

This recipe is amazing.  I no longer buy sausage at all. I wait until pork shoulder butt goes on sale for .99 a pound and I buy 50 pounds. Since the pork is low on fat, I add a little more of the spice mixture than the amount specified. Everyone loves it!

Great recipe.  I used ground turkey and onion salt instead of simple salt.  I then formed them into individual rounds (60g each) using the egg-ring we use for making breakfast sausages.

Very good as is, but spectacular if you substitute demerara sugar (maybe a bit less) and 1/4 tsp freshly ground cumin for pepper flakes.

I made this recipe and at first I was skeptical about how much sage for 2 lbs of pork. The flavor is very nice but I left the clove out. If you like your sausage spicy I recommend tweaking the crushed red pepper and stepping it up. Before I make any other variations on this recipe I'm going to refrigerate the rest of the batch over night to let the flavors marry up.

This sausage is incredibly simple and was delicious. I formed the patties and froze them individually (didn't cook them straight away). Cooked them from frozen and threw them onto english muffins with fried eggs for breakfast.

I might try this again with different seasonings.  Way too much clove for my taste.  I also used a combination of ground beef/pork that they had on sale at the store but it was way too dry.

Very good, and it feels great to tell people you made the sausage from scratch!  I used mine to make sausage gravy, and because the pork I chose was lean, I ended up having to add olive oil to the pan, which worked perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My son and I both have gluten and other food allergies (EOE also) which makes me make a lot of our food from scratch.  We both enjoy spicy food as well.  We took this great starter recipe and added 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper to go along with the pepper flakes.  My son said that this recipe was a keeper with the additions made.  He also said that he enjoyed the sweet first bite and then the kick in the taste buds after the second bite with the added heat.

So easy and delicious! I used half ground turkey for a lower fat alternative. I am from Vermont so of course I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar. Great recipe, will make again!

I didn't have the cloves so I used a little nutmeg. Also, I fried them in basil infused oil.

They sausage was amazing. Really impressed and so simple.

Exactly the taste I was looking for. I make this every time I pick up ground pork. Usually freeze half the patties before I cook them so I can pull them out when I want. 
I use cayenne instead of red pepper flakes out of preference. Still great.

Tastes are so varied but the key to a great recipe is that the instructions are easy, the flavor makes you say "wow," and you have the framework to tweak it to whatever you need or want. This does it, hands down! Smell the marjoram - that to me, is a secret ingredient that's necessary for this. My tweak is reducing salt by 1/3 to half, adding more spice (almost double) mixing fresh crushed sage (because I enjoy a sagey flavor), removing all sugar (too much sugar in all foods) and maybe adding a little more cayenne for a bit more kick. 
My dad and I slaughtered and prepared hogs while I was younger, curing meats which harkened to a life of hands on prep from field to table. I plan on talking with him to learn some secrets to make this even better, because the weak link will ALWAYS be the meat itself, and this meat was a ground pork from Smithfield VA. The meats are watered down today and I suggest you find a local farm or market to move away from nationally grown and processed foods. But if you can't, make sure to add up to double the spices and try fresh versions of herbs to get all your recipes singing better.

I made this and it is a fantastic sausage.  It has a lot of flavor!  I added more salt and seasonings I think, but the combo is great.

Mix a small amount and then fry some and taste it to get the right ratio for you.

What a great simple staple to have up your sleeves! I made this as is the first time but have made it several more times using ground turkey instead of the pork. Another reviewer suggested applesauce instead of the brown sugar so I grated in some apple to the mixture when I was serving it to a diabetic person (as I wanted even less sugar than what the applesauce would give). It turned out great with a very "classic" sausage patty flavor with just the right amount of sweet vs. heat. If you're going to do turkey like me, I recommend using a greased ice cream scooper since the mixture gets sticky.  This is one I will make again and again!

I make a large batch of the spice mix an store it in a mason jar. For the sausage I usually use ground chicken. I cook some in patties an some crumbles to use throughout the week.

Made this a couple times now and find it very good and easy  - and without all the junk that is in bought sausages!  The only changes I make is to sub maple sugar for the brown sugar and double the pepper flakes.

I have very picky eaters in my household when it comes to spices so the only change I made was to not use the clove. I bought two whole pork loins and adjusted the amounts to match up to the amount of meat I had. This was automatically my family's new favorite sausage. I cut all the pork loin into chunks then added the spices and put it through my grinder. Vacuum sealed it and put it in the freezer. It cooks with barely any grease splatter and tastes out of this world.

Made as written, and it was pretty good! (Very mild.) We prefer a little more spice, so next time I will double the red pepper flakes. If it'll still a little bland, I'll take another reviewer's suggestion and double everything but the salt & black pepper. I love that there is no MSG or dairy (storebought always has something-or-other-lactylate in it, which a family member is allergic to) and I can make this for about $1.25/lb cheaper than Jimmy Dean. UPDATE: I've been at least doubling the recipe and freezing the extra as bulk sausage in 1/2 or 1-lb amounts in quart size bags. (I flatten the bags with a rolling pin before sealing--gets nearly all the air out, and the flat bags thaw in less than 10 minutes on the counter.) Thanks for the recipe!

I was out of sage so I substituted it with poultry seasoning and since the poultry seasoning also has marjoram in it I didn't add in more I just used more poultry seasoning. It came out great. Much better than all the stuff at the store with MSG

Needed to make breakfast burritos fast and only had a pound of ground pork on hand. This was FABULOUS!!! Made the whole recipe and used a little over half to season the pork. My family loved the burritos!! This is a keeper!

Favorite sausage at home. No longer buying commercial type. I make half the recipe and increase seasonings to our liking. I have tried the half turkey/half pork combo and it is tasty. If pork is reduced fat, I did use turkey with higher fat percentage. I do enjoy the meatiness of all pork and using regular pork.

This recipe was so good. I can't wait to make it again. I love sausage but you never know what's really in it. With this I know exactly what I'm eating. The only thing I might do differently next time is reduce the amount of salt. Other than that it was great!

Overall a nice recipe. It is too salty for my tastes so I will reduce the salt to 1 1/2 tsp if I make it again. Will also increase the herbs and spices a bit to compensate for the reduction in salt. It is so nice to be able to have sausage without nitrites or other unhealthy ingredients.

Have you checked the ingredient label on breakfast sausage lately? It is almost impossible to find breakfast sausage without msg. This recipe brought sausage I can be proud of into the house. I make a full 2 lb batch at a time and bag it separately to freeze  until we need it. I also will occasionally cook some patties lightly and freeze them in batches for "brown and serve". My family loves it and I love knowing everything that is in it.

This was my first attempt to make breakfast sausage. I followed the directions but left out the brown sugar. I have eaten commercially made brown sugar sausage and find it a bit too sweet.  I used a very fatty pork shoulder but left out some of the fat. That might have been a mistake. My sausages were a bit rubbery. I think more fat would be the answer. The taste was fine but a bit bland. I think when I make this again, and I will, I will increase the sage and red pepper flakes. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Made it exactly as written, except I was out of marjoram so I substituted oregano. It has a hint of spiciness because of the red pepper flakes but it's not too much as long as you mix it in evenly. I'll make this recipe again.

Made it just as written. Perfect. You can go ahead and try to make it better but you'll be wasting your time. The kiddos love it too. A dash of hot sauce if that's your thing too, side of buttermilk cornbread, big ol glass of whole milk, and you've got yourself a meal.

Been using this recipe for years and it's a favorite of our family.  I always sub ground turkey for the pork and sometimes I'll replace the brown sugar with maple syrup. Seasonings are right on for my kiddos but for my hubby and I, I usually up the red pepper.  Salty, sweet, spicy...delicious!

I find commercial sausage to be borderline nauseating, and have rarely found one I can eat more than two small servings of.  The grease makes my stomach roll, and the inclusion of gristle and other odd-textured substances sets off my gag reflex a little too often.  Consequently, hubby - who loves sausage - rarely gets sausage at home.  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I used what meat I had on hand in the freezer, which was boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I ran it through our little grinder twice, with the spices, and put in the refrigerator overnight.  Hubby came into the kitchen when I was cooking it up.  I gave him a small cooked piece that had broken off a patty.  His face lit up and he was fully prepared to get out the rest of the 6-pound bag of chicken thighs and make more sausage TODAY.  lol  I ate my full share, too, with no gagging or rolling stomach involved.  We will be making bulk batches of this for freezing and will have sausage frequently from now on.

This is a good recipe as is, but I used the second tome around ground chicken not pork and I doubled it and frozen it down to two patties in a bag. Just me here now. And this is a good way to keep sausage on hand for out of town visitor's that come by.

I took a fresh boneless shoulder and ground it (2 lbs), and made it to the recipe (doubling all qtys). Overall it came out very well balanced - a good place to start if you like your sausage more or less seasoned, EXCEPT for the salt. I recommend cutting the salt in 1/2 for the 1st try.

I followed the recipe exactly, and this came out pretty well. I wasn't sure about the cloves, but it tasted fine. I used some of it for turkey & pork burgers I made for dinner, and the family ate them up. I will use this recipe again.

Reduced sugar to 1 1/2 tsp based on previous reviews. Also omitted the red pepper flakes for the kiddos.  Entire family of 5 loves it! Thank you!

What caught my eye was the brown sugar and plenty of it. I like mine a little spicy and to add the pepper and the black pepper, look out. I use my own pepper seeds so I  am sure that this is a little spicy than store bought pepper flakes. Since I do not keep ground cloves on hand I broke out my mortar and pestle to ground up the whole cloves which I always have. I will keep this one just in case I purchase bulk sausage again.

First time I made this sausage, I followed the recipe (almost) to the letter, and matched Jimmy Dean's flavor! This recipe is easy, fast and predictably delicious. One change: I crumbled and froze the sausage, so I could toss a handful into a frying pan, followed by eggs with hot cherry peppers. Added a cherry tomato on the side and a small glass of heavy cream, and I was nearly in low carb heaven.

Second pass, I replaced brown sugar with "Sugar Twin Granulated Brown" (a zero carb, zero calorie saccharin mix). Now THAT's low carb heaven!

Great recipe.  I cut the recipe in half.  I did not have cloves so I added a touch of Chinese five spice seasoning.  My whole family loved it!  I'm thrilled for a healthier alternative to store bought pork sausage.

I was craving biscuits and gravy and unfortunately can't find this kind of sausage in the stores where I live. But there is plenty of ground pork, so I found this recipe! This is a good basic recipe, but it really depends where your tastes lie. I have made it several times, and found myself adding close to double the indicated seasonings. I also leave out marjoram (can't find it) and add garlic (everything is better with garlic). It's also good if you substitue maple syrup for the brown sugar (does change the texture a bit). A very good basic recipe!

Loved the herb balance in this, speedy to mix, too.
We halved the salt and doubled the spice and it was perfect for us.
We plan to make some slender patties ahead and freeze for cook-from-the-freezer breakfasts. Flavor is enhanced if you mix a few hours or a full day before cooking.

GREAT!  I can't get the marjoram where I live overseas, but I substituted italian seasoning instead for a more italian sausage flavor... I make a half batch about every week for breakfasts/pizza toppings!

Really flavorful, even with lean pork. I ground up pork tenderloin and cut the brown sugar by 1/3.  If you are watching calories, fats and sugars, a 2 ounce patty is about 65 calories.

Since pork isn't part of our diet, I used lean ground beef. Crumbled with scrambled eggs, onions and peppers, this is fantastic as a breakfast burrito! The fuller taste of the beef makes the burrito a hearty way to start the day. Slather with homemade salsa and you've got a winner! This would work great with ground turkey too, I just didn't have any on hand. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We made this, and it was amazing.  My very picky child took one bite and said, "This is so good I think I'm going to faint."  I added a teaspoon of maple extract, otherwise it was cooked as is.  I'd purchased coursely ground pork meat for tacos that I tossed in the food processer for a few seconds.  We will never buy store bought again!

We made this tonight and it was awesome! I didn't have marjoram and used fennel seeds instead of cloves. We bought a boston butt and ground it up. It looked like it would be fatty but it was a lot leaner when it cooked up than we expected. We wanted to get away from the preservatives and such that is in the store bought stuff. This was so easy and so good! Thanks for the recipe!

I really like this recipe.  I am giving it four stars because I needed to make some adjustments for my taste.  I do not use the marjoram basically because I do not care for that spice and do not keep it in my pantry.  I at least double the sage because we really like it better with more sage.  I also add at least one teaspoon of fennel and a little more sugar.  I use this recipe when I make sausage gravy and everyone says it's the best sausage gravy they have ever tasted.

I bought some pork and put it through my food processor.  Then added all the ingredients and let the machine blend it up.  THIS IS THE BEST SAUSAGE WE HAVE EVER EATEN!  Ever!!  Thank you.  No more sausage with all the chemicals in it.

Unreal how good this is. If you have a favorite store bought sausage in a plastic tube, this is truly a better experience while meeting all of your expectations on what a breakfast sausage should taste like.  I double ground some pork loin in my Kitchen Aid and only changed one or two things - more pepper, more pepper flakes and added a bit of fresh shaved cinnamon. It still wasn't "spicy" enough for my tastes, but I'm not sure using my Kitchen Aid mixing paddle got everything mixed properly.

This is a great recipe. I made this for breakfast and everyone loved it. I made two changes. First, I cut the salt in half. Second, I cut the sugar in half.  I used coarsely ground pork, which is what is usually available in my local grocery stores, but I will obtain finely ground pork and I expect that will improve the texture.

This was pretty good, but not quite what I was looking for.  I didn't have marjoram, so maybe that made a difference?  My husband thought it tasted "fruity."  I will keep looking!

We have been using Jones All Natural frozen sausage, which wasn't bad and seemed healthier than all other processed sausages, but these were amazing - so much better.  The only thing I cut back on was the brown sugar - only 2 tsp since we're trying to do the "no white flour / no sugar" diet.    NOW the test will be  - how will they do cooked and then frozen?  There's no time to cook them during the week, so I cooked all today and will freeze and try heating them up in the microwave.

I have made this many times. I have found that mixing the spicies in the meat (I use ground turkey) refrigerating for 5-8 hours then doing a taste peice to  cook. If need be "add to" before making into sausage patties then freeze. I have made brown sugar, spicy, and a sage sausage. All wonderful! This is a great recipe and NO you will not go back to store bought after making this. Thank you for a great recipe.

They were nowhere near as greasy as the store bought ones! I liked them but my 2.5 year old who I originally made them for didn’t seem to care for them. She gets sausage every Sunday because she loves it so much. My healthier idea didn’t trick her even though I shaped them into logs but I will make them again. I froze half uncooked.

This is an excellent recipe and so easy to make!  Only made a couple minor changes out of neccessity; had no ground cloves so I crushed fresh ones.  YUM!  I'll do that again next time and add about 1/2 the salt.  WOW!  I'll never buy another premade breakfast sausage again!

Having never made sausage before I was skeptical about this, but after making it, I was really pleasantly surprised.  The flavor was nice, just added more red pepper flakes for a bit more zing.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I currently live in England.  Having been raised in Wisconsin where there is wonderful sausages, I find British sausages not very tasteful.  Too many fillers!  Today I tried this recipe and both my husband & I enjoyed it.  It will be made often.  I'm a garlic lover so added some to the other ingredients.  YUMMY.

This was good, but not spicy enough for our tastes.  I'll be making it again though and experimenting with the seasonings until I get it right for us.  Great base recipe though.

Very nice and easy.  I was using it for another recipe that called for bulk sausage so I mixed it all up the day before and then fried and crumbled it.  Delicious!  Will definitely do it again any time I need bulk sausage.

This is one of the better recipes I have made on this site.  No alterations are needed, but it is fun to experiment with adding other ingredients, too.  I recommend maple syrup (real), cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Cut the pepper down if you do this.  Again, this recipe is great just as it is.

Very good sausage, easy and good flavor. I added a little ground cayenne and by mistake added too much brown sugar. I'm sure I will like it better with the right amount of brown sugar. Thanks for a good recipe

I have just (within the last year) gotten into Pork. Trying sausage was & is the latest craze. I thought this recipe was perfect & easy. I used 2 boston butts & ground them myself with the mix master. I did add 25% FAT, on the advice of my butcher. A bit too greasy for us. Next time a little less Mon. I will try to use other ingrediants like turkey etc. Thanks SOOOOO much.

Oh my gosh! this sausage is wonderful! I even took some to my neighbor and she thought it was awesome! I will definitely make this again. I had to add a little olive oil to cook it because it was so lean. This is a keeper. Can't wait to try the Italian sausage recipe.

We bought 1/2 hog from the butcher.  The ground pork he made for us was very lean, so I did not follow the recommendations of others to mix with ground turkey.    This sausage is wonderful!  It's just spicy enough to make you know you're eating sausage and mild enough that sensitive palates aren't offended.    I used my kitchen scale to make 2 oz patties, so my yield was 8 to the pound.  I use plastic gloves, because I have long nails - no problem with getting it mixed enough or sticking to my hands.

This was exceptionally good, though I'll admit I didn't have any Sage around so I had to improvise slightly (followed some others' recommendations of subbing in Italian spices & fennel seed).  In terms of seasoning this worked very well.  Why I give only 4 out of 5 is that I thought the sausage lacked a little "bite"... possibly some fresh chili pepper would help.  I will try this the next time I make these.

i made this for my boyfriend because he LOVES breakfast foods. he's not the biggest fan of sausage but i like it. i figured this would be a much healthier way of eating sausage since it's usually artery clogging when you eat at restaurants. anyway i made a ton of patties and gave some to my aunt and her family. my boyfriend and i loved it! and my aunt and my cousin raved about it and want more. thank you for sharing this recipe! it tastes great.

Wonderful. Can't believe so easy. I will not do storebought anymore. The taste was so different than storebought...these didn't taste as artificial. Like others I increased the sage, didn't have marjoram so used a bit of oregano. Added a bit of oil to mixture because I used chicken/turkey instead of pork. Used my cookie cutter and froze the extras uncooked but next time I think I will cook the extras before freezing them.

I used this recipe and substituted turkey for the pork.  I left out the red pepper and added the other ingredients to taste.  It turned out great and I will definately fix it again.

Great recipe.  I am on low salt diet so reduced salt to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp mace.  Turned out great.

I have been making this recipe for about 10 years+ now. I do like it to be a little more flavorful so I add a couple of things that I have tweaked over the years. And I have always added it to 2 lbs beef for beef sausage. add 1 tsp fennel seed , 2 tsp of Montreal Steak seasonings, increase sage by 1 tsp, and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flake.   When I have not put in the Montreal Steak seasonings and tried to increase (double) other ingredients, it always came out with too much seasonings., which is why I just do the Steak seasonings.

Because of this awesome recipe, I don't buy the commercial kind anymore!  I mixed it all together, and let it sit overnight, and the flavor was exactly right.  Not only is the recipe great as is, but it's a great jumping off point, to tinker, and customize.

I think this is a fabulous recipe.  I followed the directions completely, except for the marjoram.  Didn't have any.  Didn't miss it either.  Fabulous.  Will use again and again.  Thanks for posting it.  :)
