I am William C. Smith, and I'd like to reply to the ratings so far.  Thank you all for the very nice comments and I'm  happy to see that some of you have found alternative methods of preparation. I too have experimented a bit with the ingredients especially trying to find ways to make it less fattening.  Ground turkey and ground chicken are great substitutes for ground beef and I've even successfully used chicken meat chopped fresh and from a can. To my Cuban critics let me just say that originally, there were no cajun spices,(I use Tony Chachere's), no chipotle(which isn't necessary at all to the mix; and the chipotle I used is in a powder form), and orginally the olive used was green, stuffed with pimento.  I believe my friend used a 1/4 - 1/2 tsp chile powder and red pepper flakes, or some equilivant.  You could use any type of hot pepper sauce, but I like to add habanero sauce to mine now; but let me just say that if you do use habanero sauce, in respect to your family/friends that don't like the heat, use only one drop.  Habanero sauce is alot like garlic in a recipe, less is better just for flavor, and more is overpowering.  This is an easy recipe for sure and I'm glad those of you who've tried it have found as flavorful as I.  And yes to the reviewer concerning the name, it should be named Frijoles Cubanos; I was just so excited about listing it online that I got it backwards.

I thought this was an excellent dish!  My husband is from Puerto Rico so we have a bunch of rice dishes here.  This was flavorful enough for adults and not too overpowering for kids.  I did not use the black olives.  I also used a can of "Cuban Style" black beans.  Thanks for this keeper!  Also I wanted to add that this recipe is 7 points per serving (using lean ground beef) if you follow Weight Watchers! : )

This is a great recipe & it's fool proof, too!!!  I omitted the onions since my hubby can't stomach 'em.  Didn't affect the yumminess one bit.  Also, my rice turned out gummy - but this wasn't a problem either.  Just mixed it right in with the ground beef mixture & you couldn't tell I messed up at all.  We added a dollop of sour cream & a bit of cheese to top it off.  My husband said we could have it once a week - and he's SUPER picky!  I highly recommend this recipe.

It was a good recipe, but I was more impressed with the leftovers. I used the leftovers for filling in oven baked chimichangas (the recipe is from AllRecipes, too) and my family wolfed them down.

I nice easy recipe that's a winner.  I added some extra spices & it turned out perfect.  This also works well with green olives instead of black.

Very nice recipe for black beans & rice.  I prefer to use ground turkey rather than ground beef.  When I server this as a main dish, I will get fajita wraps and make a homemade tomato salsa and guacamole dips.    I make this every 2 weeks.  It's a very healthy meal or side-dish.  My biggest piece of advice here is don't buy the canned black beans.  Buy the unsoaked, uncooked black beans and prepare them a day before.  No canned beans can top that.

This was easy, tasty and pretty close to a lot of Cuban food I've had.  Didn't have any Chipotle powder, so I opened a small can of chipotles in adobo sauce, chopped up 4 of the peppers and added them along with the adobo sauce.  Yummy.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Looked like kitty litter, tasted really great! Even better w/ how I prepared the leftovers - boiled several bell peppers, drained and sprinkled them w/ salt. Put shredded cheddar in the bottom, then stuffed w/ the leftovers frijoles' cubanos, dribbled salsa on the tops, then added more cheese ... baked 325 for 30 min. Ohhhhhyum!

My husband raved on and on about this dish and said it was the best food he's ever had!  I did not have cilantro on hand so I left it out but I will add it next time.  It looks like I'm going to be making this one a lot since my husband is still talking about it days later.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe...it was really tasty!  The redwine vinegar and the cajun spices are terrific together.  I did discover that I don't care for the taste of cilantro, however, and next time will stick to fresh parsley.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream and the family went wild for it!

Sorry, but I find this recipe to be only okay.  But I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida.  My grandfather was Cuban.  Our family never ate  some of the ingredients you put in this recipe.  Please don't name a recipe with ingredients from a wholely different food culture -- like Puerto Rican and Mexican chipolte powder or "Cajun" powder into Cuban food! I think the dish would probably be fine if I hadn't been expecting something I knew I would be pleased to eat.

Super meal.  My family loved it and declared that it should be on the "once-a-week" menu for the summer.  I served it over a bed of Spanish Rice, topped with corn tortilla chips, then the bean/meat mixture.  Sour cream and guacomole on the sides, with a sprinkle of colby/cheddar cheese.  I also served it  with fresh sliced tomato.  For the beverage we had homemade strawberry smoothies.  Instead of the chipolte powder (I couldn't find it at the store) I used a small can of chipolte peppers in abado sauce.  Chop the chipolte peppers before adding to the beans and meat.  (I forgot the wine vinegar, but it still tasted great.  The three sprigs of cilantro were just right).  I will definitely serve this again.  Thank you, William!

This has a wonderful depth of flavor. Only things I did differently was used only 1 lb ground beef as that's all I had and cut back on the Cajun seasoning to 1 1/2 T (my husband does not like too much heat). I did choose the "mix it with the rice" suggestion from the submiter and mixed 3/4 of the rice with it.  This went very well served alongside Grilled Caribbean Chicken with Pineapple salad (from this site) and corn.

This is a very tasty dish! I have made it as written, with the exception of substituting ground turkey for the beef, and I thought it was fantastic.  I've also made it with ground chicken and have added chopped mild green chilies and almonds as well.  It's a great base recipe that works well with improvisations and additions.  I like to mix the meat/beans mixture and the rice all together and either eat it like that or serve it on whole wheat tortillas or pitas with greens, salsa, and sour cream.  The recipe makes a fairly large batch, but I’ve found that it keeps well in the fridge and reheats nicely.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow - I tasted this and I thought, "Man, I cook well!" This was an excellent balance of spice, tang, and savory.  Very very good.  This is an instant hit and will definitely be a repeat in our house.  
I substituted white rice and one can of red beans as that's what was on hand.  Also, as our Cajun seasoning was a bit on the spicy side (Emeril's recipe,) we added a bit of sour cream.
Thank you for sharing this recipe - Yum!

PERFECT!  My husband is Cuban, and he LOVED this dish!  My kids also gobbled it up (and they are picky 4 & 6 year olds).  SO EASY to make, wonderful left over- I didn't use chipotle powder, and used McCormick "kickin' chicken" spice mix (for grilling) instead of Cajun spices, since that what I had.  Great recipe to make substitutions as needed.  This is one of my favorite recipes from this site!!

This is one of my 'go-to' vegetarian recipies. Instead of ground meat I use Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo. It is already pretty spicy but I still use the Cajun seasoning ("Simple Cajun Seasoning" from this site). If I'm trying to be reeeally healthy I serve the beans over a large bed of slightly wilted spinach. A great combination.

I didn't *love* this recipe by itself. I felt like it was missing something. However, as a burrito filling with lettuce sour cream and salsa it was very yummy! I would use the recipe again for making burritos. Thanks.

This was easy to make.  I used the optional chipotle powder.  It was pretty good, although it seemed like it needed some tomatoes.  I added some salsa to my bowl and that helped.  I think I will make it again and add a can of drained diced tomatoes.

THis was a nice recipe, just wanted to add a little information to my fellow allrecipes.com users.  This dish should be renamed "Frijoles Cubanos" because in Spanish the adjective goes after the noun, and also I am almost 100% certain that this dish is actually Picadillo, or a variation of it since it differs from region to region.  Hope this helps add a little more background to this nice dish, a conversation topic maybe.

This was fabulous! I used 1 1/2 lbs. cubed chicken breast instead of ground beef. I sautéed the onions first in some olive oil, and then added the chicken with the spices (and yes I did add the chipotle powder). I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic vinegar instead.  We don't care for cilantro, so I didn't add it.
I used this recipe for the Cajun Seasoning - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cajun-spice-mix-2/.  Make this recipe! You won't regret it.

A very good and simple recipe! I added some chili powder and garlic powder along with the cajun spice. Drained the black beans then added half can of water to simmer, adding a bit more water to keep it saucy before serving. Served over white rice with some chopped fresh tomatoes on the edges and a bit of shredded cheddar on top. We added hot sauce at the table. Will make it again. Thanks!

This was good, I followed the recipe except I didn't have the chipotle powder so I added chili powder & red pepper flakes.  I served it with cheese, sour cream, hot sauce and tortilla chips.

This is a fantastic recipe! I used stuffed green olives instead of black olives. I certainly didn't need to simmer it for 20 minutes. I think I messed up because I drained the black beans. It was still great! My husband couldn't stop nibbling on it every time he walked through the kitchen.

Very nice flavor. Inexpensive real food that fills you up and makes you satisfied. Everyone loved it and it was requested to be made again. I exchanged a minced chipotle for the powder because I didn't have any. I left out the olives because I am not an olive fan.

I used ground turkey but, other than that, followed the recipe, including the chipotle powder.  My daughter and her friend really liked it.  I thought it was just okay, but found it greatly improved when I sprinkled some habenero hot sauce on it. Also, I felt it was better reheated the next day.  I would make this again, but would make it a day ahead and would make a little less rice.

I eliminated the olives (bc husband doesn't like them) and the chipotle powder.  At least doubled the cilantro, used ground turkey, and added a few dashes of chili powder and red pepper flakes.  Really good!  I made 4 servings for the 2 of us and we ate it all in one sitting!  Would love to try it with the olives.

We loved this dish.  I left out the olives because my husband doesn't like them.  Next time I might sneak in some green olives with pimientos chopped up really fine to make sure he doesn't see them.  I think the brininess of olives would make it even better.  It was a little salty to me, but that may be because I didn't have much of the rice with mine.  My husband thought it was perfect.  Will definitely make on a regular basis.  Also, I used ground turkey instead of beef.

Yum!! I made an account just so I could rate this.  It's insanely flavorful for how hassle-free it is (love that it's a one-pot dish too!) I think it must be the red wine vinegar that kicks up the flavor. I subbed a few things based on what I had on hand, but I'm sure it will be just as good with the ingredients it calls for. I used half black beans and half pinto beans, and lean ground turkey instead of ground beef to cut the calories a bit and did not miss the beef at all. I also didn't add the olives because I was feeling too lazy to chop them. I didn't have chipotle pepper but used a Mexican seasoning blend instead. This recipe is very forgiving and you can alter it as you see fit with great results  (as you can see).  I will make it forever! Thank you William!

I have made this several times and it is always a hit! Now that I'm comfortable with the recipe I use the following substitutions:
Kalamata olives 
Cider vinegar 
and less Cajun seasoning as the stuff I have has quite the kick to it!

Wow, delicious. I followed exactly but added minced garlic with the onions, and more cilantro. don't like overbearing heat, and I added spices perfectly (didn't measure like the recipe).

It was spicy in a pleasant way, which is good, but there was no sauce to speak of.  The rice and beans were kind of dry; if I make it again, I will add some tomato sauce or some of the liquid from the black beans, or some wine, or something.

This is so good!!  It is now in the meal rotation at my house.  I use 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb ground pork, skip the cilantro, olives and chipotle powder and use apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine.  It's awesome- everyone loves it and it is quick and easy other than making the beans (I use dry black beans, not canned).  Thanks so much!

We ate this last night for dinner.  First of all I thought it was really salty.  I think my cajun seasoning made it that way so next time I would cut that in half.  I did not have the chipotle powder, but subbed in cayenne instead (we like it spicy)  I actually mixed it all together with the rice- which I thought might cut the saltiness, but it didn't.  I'm going to try the leftovers today and see if some of the flavors meld better together.  I think there are some real possibilities with this dish- if it were not so salty.

Delicious! Forgot to add cilantro, but delicious none-the-less.  For extra texture, color, and health benefits, cooked some canned whole kernel corn and served mixed in right before serving. Great taste combination! Hubby  loved too, and he doesn't normally like Cuban/Mexican food. Thanks for submitting!

My family really loved this dish too!  I'm not a big fan of cilantro so I didn't add it, but we did serve this with cheese on top as well as a little salsa.  Incredibly good!  My kids all had seconds and asked that I make it again so this will definitely be a part of our regular dinner rotation.  Thanks for a really good quick and easy meal.

My husband loved it! I was trying to find something to make with what we had and ran across this.  I exchanged one can of black beans for dark red kidney beans and added fresh tomato and jalapenos and mexican cheese on top.  I didn't have chipotle seasoning so I just sprinkled some chili powder and paprika.  Was very good, easy and made Tons!  thanks!

Everybody liked this one, not too spicy at all. I did start early in the day and then let it sit all day. It did help blend the spices and soften the vinegar taste that was so prevalent in the dish in the beginning. Start it early! I skipped cilantro also, family can't stand it, other than that, followed recipe exactly.

I substituted Spanish Paprika for the Chipolte powder.  Also increased the spice amount. I drained the black beans and am wondering if I should have left the liquid in???  Any ideas?  GREAT DISH for a potluck at work!

This was fantastic :).  I did make a few changes, though - I used a combination of ground turkey and chopped up mushrooms (I didn't have 1.5 lbs of meat so usually when I come up short for recipes, I add chopped mushrooms because they're healthy and cheap).  I didn't have any onions so I used onion powder.  I also added garlic powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and a sprinkle of turmeric.  I didn't add turmeric for taste, it just has a lot of health benefits so I try to use it when I can get away with it.  The "cajun" seasoning that I used was Emeril's Bayou Blast.  When I ate it right after cooking it, I found that the red wine vinegar gave a bit of a sharpness to the dish that I wasn't too crazy about, but reheated the next day, the flavors melded together really nicely.  I topped with some shredded cheese and a bit of Cholula hot pepper sauce.  Overall, an amazing recipe.  Thanks!!

I changed up the recipe a bit. I didn't have the cajun seasoning, cilantro, or chipotle, so I used cumin and chili powder, added jalepeno juice for a little more kick, and used chipotle diced tomatoes. I used green stuffed olives rather than black. I served on white rice and topped with shredded cheese and sour cream. Sooooooo good! Like a Cuban chili.

This is a good recipe. I would give it 4.5 if I could. The only thing is I didn't add cilantro ('cause I hate it) and I served it with white rice.

Now this was TASTY.  Had to use white rice and just cooked it in with the beef/beans.  No cilantro or chipotle, but added some parsley, oregano, and chili powder.  Also added some corn.  Hearty and very generous.  Tastes good topped with sour cream.

I thought this was a little bland and I thought the cajun seasoning was a little out of place. If I make this again I will use different spices. I don't like cilantro and I didn't have any chipotle seasoning so went without both. When we have the leftovers I'm going to add some tomato, cheese, and sour cream on the side. It's filling and not bad, but I think it needs to be doctored up some.
