This recipe DOES have the correct amount of flour to make the donuts light & fluffy.  By placing the dough on a floured surface & sprinkling with flour, it removes the tackiness of the dough.  The dough does not stick to the rolling pin.  The only suggestion would be to let the donuts drain & cool somewhat before adding sugar/cinnamon coating.  If the sugar coating is added too soon, the donuts will retain too much sugar mixture and drown the taste of the donut & you will only be tasting the sugar.

We are first time doughnut makers, so take that for what its worth.  We made doughnuts and doughnut holes out of our center pieces we cut out.  By the time we got to our holes (we did them last) we had it down pat.  Our doughnuts came out very crunchy and greasy, and not very doughy in the centers at all.  I think our mistake was not letting the oil get to temp (It really needs to be 370 or even a tad higher) or else the doughnuts just float around soaking up oil for too long.  Use high heat, and don't over cook (golden does not mean brown!  It took us a few tries to see the difference)  Personally, I think the flour ratio is right on.  I can see how adding extra flour could dilute the taste as another poster mentioned.  Do use extra flour when rolling out.  We will be doing these again soon to iron out our wrinkles and I'll review again.  In our case, I think the failure was our fault, not the recipe!  Use high heat!  Don't overcook!

These were excellent, like the difference sliced grocery store bread and homemade. I've never made doughnuts before so I was really impressed. I read the other reviews before making these and have some hints for people who were finding the dough too sticky.  I made the recipe as stated with two notable exceptions. First I used Becel margarine because that was all I had on hand.  I don't buy butter unless I need it for shortbread.  I will buy butter for this recipe.  I think the butter would help the dough firm. After making the dough I divided it in half and added two tablespoons of dutch process cocoa in an attempt to try to make chocolate doughnuts for variety without making two different recipes - I lack willpower and my waistline doesn't need dozens of doughnuts in the house.  The cocoa didn't work and that half of the batch was compost. It did however roll out better than the plain batch  which was probably due to the extra dry ingredients.  I let the dough sit in the fridge uncovered overnight. Also I rolled these out on a board slightly more floured than I would use for pastry. After cutting the doughnuts out I let them air dry while the oil was heating and then fried them for 1 1/2 minutes per side.  We dusted only half of them with sugar/cinnamon mix and they were equally good without as they were with it. I've promised the family that next weekend will have a dougnut extravaganza and freeze the majority.

Where I come from in Upstate New York these are called Fried Cakes. They are often sold in the fall to accompany fresh apple cider. They are not meant to be like Krispy Kremes. Those are yeast based donuts. These are supposed to have a denser texture. It is also customary to coat them with cinnamon and sugar or eat them plain but they are never iced. Thanks for this old time recipe.

This recipe is fabulous!  I don't have a donut cutter so I dropped batter by spoonsful.  Just use very small spoons, though.  The first batch came out big as tennis balls.  Still delicious, but quite large.  I then tried dropping a scant teaspoon, and they came out about the size of golf balls.  The smaller ones are wonderfully crunchy and crispy while the larger ones are more cake-like.  Yummy.

Ihave been baking MANY years. Wanted sonething to do with my grandchildren so I thought I'd try this. WHAT A MESS!! The dough was SO sticky that it could't be handled. I thought I made a mistake in the recipe so I mixed up another batch of dough and the same thing. This recipe is just awful! It doesn't even deserve 1 star.

This recipe had a very great flavor;
however, the dough was too sticky.  I added 
 (about 1 c.more flour) till it was not so sticky.

This recepie is inacurate in the whole point of view, the time to refrigirate the ingridients is not enogh and need more flour , is very messy and with the actual ingridients like the flour amount is not enogh to make the consitency that the doughnuts need to be able to take them and fry them..my kids did not like them either

This recipe is great. I found that it does need to be refrigerated a little longer than an hour. Instead of adding milk I added apple cider. They turned out so delicious.

I believe I read all 122 reviews before trying this recipe. I decided to just cut back the milk by 1/4 cup, due to several warnings about dough being too sticky.  They came out FABULOUS! Made as directed except for decreasing the milk, refrigerated overnight, used plenty of flour to pat out the dough with my hands (rolling pin totally unnecessary), cut and fried as directed. OMG heavenly! My husband flipped over these! No problem with stickiness at all. We had eaten half a dozen before I could get cinnamon sugar on them.  Stored in Tupperware, they were still plenty good the next day. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I tried a very small batch of these just to see what they're like. I didn't care for them, because they're not 'cake' donuts.  Real cake donuts aren't rolled out. These are more like dense sweet bread in the shape of a donut. I realize most recipes for cake donuts on the web seem to be for rolled-out donuts, but donut cutters in the bakery are actually for the fried yeast donuts, not cake donuts. In the bakery, cake donuts are made with a batter and are dropped onto oil with a dispenser. The dispensers aren't very expensive. And you can find dispensers on the web that come with a traditional cake donut recipe such as that used in bakeries.  It's even possible to use boxed cake mixes by altering the amount of wet ingredients added to the batter to make other flavors of cake donuts.  But I would not call the donuts in this recipe here 'cake' donuts, because it's not made from a batter, but rather a dough.

The doughnuts taste really good and the recipe is simple to make.  I want to thank those of you who complained about the stickiness of the dough, you made my life easier.  One cup of milk is really too much for this recipe;  I used 2/3 cup of milk and the dough turned out perfect.

Omg!! This recipe is amazing. Although I am not a fan of cake doughnuts (hubby is) I made this one today. I was a little skeptical about the 2 tbsp. of vanilla but tried it anyway. I will be making this one again and probably be doubling it. I wouldn't change a thing and had no

These are good! They are just like I like them: crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I made holes without refrigerating the dough first becuase I was in a hurry. The dough was tacky but I was able to scoop out about a tablespoon and roll it in my hands to make a ball. I dropped it in the oil and fried for about 2-4 minutes. I didn't have vanilla extract or nutmed and they were still flavorful. I can't wair to try it with those ingredients!

Okay, so i have now made this recipe twice. I have made the typical doughnuts too and if that's what you are looking for, this isn't it. However, i loved the the flavor and density of this doughnut! The dough was a really sticky consistency like a lot of people said- but i turned it out straight onto some flour and carefully folded the dough a few times to make it pliable! Little Tip 1. Don't bother using a rolling pin- just use your hands to get it to the right level- it's not a tough dough at all so it's easy to shape and will prevent sticking. Tip 2.  if you are using a cutter, dip it into flour each time before cutting and it should slip right out. What i also LOVED was the fact that it was so much easier and quicker to make than the usual doughnut! THanks for the recipe!

I would not try this recipe again! It was a batter. But that's what you get when you have 1 cup of milk to 2 1/2 cups flour! I had plenty of flour on my work surface but it still wasn't enough. When I cut out the doughnuts they stuck to everything, including my fingers when I tried putting them in the oil. I kneaded more flour in but then they were too dense. I will look for another recipe next time.

Read all reviews and wanted them to turn out the 1st time.  My son wanted donuts for his birthday "cake", so I choose these.  I tripled the recipe to get enough and ended up with 43 donuts and holes.  So, I used 2/3 cup of milk and room temperature, soft butter and I did use some whole wheat flour.  Everything else as stated.  Had a nice stiff dough and refrigerated them overnight.  Rolled out great in the morning.  No problems.  For those new to donut making...it may be helpful for you to roll and cut all donuts out while oil is heating up to get that done and have enough ready to cook and also really slick to put freshly fried donuts on flat paper grocery bags spread out.  The trickiest part for me in frying is getting that oil to stay the right temp, lots of waiting, don't rush and use oil that's not at temp. (oily donuts) or too hot (burnt, dark donuts).  Good recipe with those adjustments, not frustrating as some have experienced.  Not too sweet, just right with cinn/sugar and glazes.  Thanks!

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Reading the ingredients, I decided there would be enough flavor to skip the cinnamon/sugar coating, and I was right.  Going off the advice of other commenters that it needed more time to chill, I made the dough the night before.  I still need to work with my oil temperature, but that's my issue, not the recipe.  I highly recommend this one!

These were fantastic!  The dough (if mixed as is) was not dough - it was a soupy batter.   I just added an unmeasured amount of flour to it and in the end they were like Dunkin Donuts cake donuts!!!  yum.  They did get a bit dry after a few days, so next time I'll be more careful about how much extra flour I add in.  Thanks for sharing!

My family thoroughly enjoyed this treat.  I refrigerated overnight which I think made it easier to roll out/cut out the donuts.  Very flavorful, very soft -- and they stayed soft during the week until they were gone.   I would highly recommend this recipe.

They are very good!  The recipe was very easy to make and calls for items you probably already have in your pantry!  They were the best warm!

Another Upstate New Yorker thinks these are about as close as you'll come to the real deal found at the cider presses in the fall...brought back memories of riding to the country to buy cider and fresh donuts. We called these Fried Cakes. These should not be pale in color but nice and toasty brown!! Nice and crunchy on the outside and soft inside.  Great with Cinnamon-sugar! Dunk them in cocoa or coffee too-YUM! Eveyone loved them!! Thanks a bunch!

I followed the reciepe to the T..cutting them out was a mess even on a slightly floured surface..when I would get one good one and fried it in the hot oil the outside got beyond golden brown before the insides leaving them a little doughy inside nor could I taste any of the flavors ....store bought tastes better than these....I have been making pretty much everything from scratch cakes, frostings etc in order to cut down our food bill still in dire need of finding a good doughnut reciepe...

I used a liberal amount of flour when rolling them out and they came out picture perfect, golden and crispy outside, moist and tender inside. We sold a gazillion at our bake sale!

WOW! These are sooooo good!!  Ten times better than any I have ever had - anywhere.  I used the icing from the Crispy and Creamy Doughnuts recipe on this site.  They stay warm for about 45 min, but even after they have cooled they are still amazing.

Great base recipe.  We were impatient refrigerate for 1 hour.  Meant the dough was a little hard to work with, gooey, but I added a little extra flour and didn’t roll out.  Just grabbed spoonfuls, coated in flour so I could touch it, poked a hole in the middle.  Left out the cinnamon/sugar/nutmeg in a small portion of dough and added cocoa powder instead to make chocolate ones.

This is a fantastic basic cake doughnut recipe. Instead of using melted butter I used a room temp butter. I also used my mixer w/ a dough hook to mix. I did find the dough a little sticky so I added 1/4 cup of flour which made it perfect.

Will be holding on to this recipe. I also used someone elses suggestion for 1 1/2 minutes per side while cooking... they came out perfectly cooked.

Yay.....an easy peasy recipe for doughnuts! These are just as yummy as raised doughnuts without the fussiness of yeast. My entire family and I enjoyed them on a snowy day together. Great with chocolate glaze, too! A definite 5 star recipe!!

I just made these for my children, used 1 cup finely milled soft wheat flour in place of 1 cup white flour, substituted margarine for butter & soy milk for milk (dairy allergy) AND baked these in my donut pans. They were AWESOME! Light, fluffy, and delicate. I baked them for 8 minutes at 400 degrees in regular sized donut pan & 6 minutes at 400 degrees in mini donut pan. Very tasty! Now I'm going to make up chocolate donuts replacing 1/2 cup flour for 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and minus the spices.

This recipe was great, the first time I made it I put in the nutmeg, the second time I left it out.  I enjoyed it more with the nutmeg left out just because it tasted more like the fair doughnuts.  It does take some getting used to if you have never made doughnuts before, but practice makes perfect!:)

I wanted something that didn't require yeast and was an alternative to the "biscuit" donuts we've been making.  I wanted to like this because honestly it smelled delicious and the idea of a cake doughnut is yummy, but even letting the dough sit overnight it was still unworkable.  I put a heap of flour onto my work area, it absorbed it and still stuck.  I couldn't even pick it up.  If someone can find a way to make these with the right consistency I'm sure they'd be delicious.

The dough is WAY too sticky to actually make any type of shape other than drop doughnuts.  I'm amazed that this recipe has gotten such good reviews.  Will not make again!

These were very tasty but the dough was impossible to roll. I made them into drop donuts instead. next time I will try chilling the dough a little longer.

These were delicious. Yes, the dough is very sticky but it fries up nice. I just dropped spoonfuls into the oil and made doughnut holes. I substituted wheat flour for the white and unsweetened applesauce for the butter and they still turned out great. My kids loved them too!

WOW!!!!!  These doughnuts were a HUGE hit with my kids.  I promised my son that we would make doughnuts and this was the first recipe we tried.  I did add a little bit more flour as the dough was way to sticky for me.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  Next time I've promised him Chocolate doughnuts, so I'll try modifying this one.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I am only fifteen and I have been able to make this recipe about 5 times in the past two months. I would have given it five stars but the first time I made it the dough was sticky. So when making this add a about another cup and a half of flour. It turns out great and everyone enjoys them.

I did not care for this recipe. No offense to the person who put this on here, but a word of advise for any one else that tries this, its perfect for funnel cake, but not for doughnuts, its toooooo sticky to roll and there doesnt seem to be anything you can do about it either.

They tasted good but it took me a while to figure out the size of each piece and temp of the oil. I have never cooked anything like this before and it was definitely not as easy as I thought it would be. Overall it tasted good but there was some "user error."

I just made these and they were outstanding.  I have been looking for a cake doughnut receipe for years.  This is a keeper. I agree, use extra flour when rolling out the dough.  It is a very light dough.

I found this recipe to be easier than i thought. I found that the oil temp need to be perfect, the hotter the better. We ate these up in a little over a day plain and with sugars, powdered and cinnamon sugar.

I had to double the recipe they turned out so good big fluffy and yummy. Hubby said they were the best I had made. I also kneaded some extra flour into the dough, made it very easy to roll out and cut with my doughnut cutter, just the right amount of flour after you knead it for few min.

I am a HUGE doughnut fan but only like cake donuts like these.  I made them about 32 yrs ago as a kid and still remember the experience and wanted to bring it to my kids. My sons (4 & 6) kept saying they wanted to go to Dunkin Donuts instead, until we tasted these!  Now they asked to make them every weekend!  Great texture and flavor and very easy to make.  The oil temp is critical and a slight golden color was the best result, although even my brownish ones still tasted good.  We bought choc cake frosting and dipped them in sprinkles, which were great.  I need to find a recipe for more frosting options, though.  Plain with a cup of coffee - I'm addicted!  THANK YOU!

I followed the recipe 100% and I found the batter to be to sticky When I put the dough on a floured surface it just spread!  I tried cutting them with a donut cutter and when I tried picking out the donut to put into the oil it reminded me of childs toy called Green Slime!  So I had to add about 1 cup of extra flour so I could at least roll it out and cut it.  I should have just scooped it and put it into the oil that way.  I might try it one more time...

I accidentally let the batter sit in the fridge for over two days, having intended to make them one morning and forgetting to do so once or twice. The dough was still very sticky and glossy, hard to work with but not impossible. I used an ice-cream scoop to dish out equal portions and then split those into small balls to make donut holes. (because they grew considerably as they fried.) the batter did stick to the bowl and to the plates I put the dough portions on. I didn't mind and I worked quickly with the batter, re-shaping the balls as I dropped them into the pan. I guess I'm just more patient than others with messy doughs. I fried them in the middle of the night using lard instead of regular cooking/frying oil because i wanted a more delicate texture and i find regular oils tend to make homemade donuts tough. I tossed them while they were still hot (thinking they were cooler than they were) in powdered sugar and cinnamon, which gave them a thick sort of glaze. I tried one while it was still considerably warm and I didn't like the taste at all, I found it too eggy and spice-heavy--but I let them sit out under a sheet of wax paper overnight. This morning they were absolutely wonderful. They were flaky and tender and they tasted just like (if not better than) most grocery or commercial donuts. I'll be using this recipe as my go-to cake donut recipe.

I was impressed with this recipe. I left out the cinnamon and nutmeg so I could use chocolate glaze and vanilla glaze on them. Got the recipe for both here on the site! and they are great!)You do need to add a little more flour because the dough is too sticky if you don't. Great doughnuts, will use this recipe from now on!

I bake on a regular basis, and I decided to do something different.  I attempted to make these for my family and they were a big disaster. Not enough flavor on the inside and the sugar topping was overkill, even after allowing the oil to drain away.  I will never make these again.

These are very good doughnuts made as is. They are not too sweet, which allows you to enjoy the glaze on them. Watch the oil so it doesn't get too hot, cook only until golden. Thanks for a new doughnut favorite.

I thought they were wonderfull for my first time trying.  I had a difficult time moldong the dough however, I had to resort to the donut holes.  I was halfway through the dough process when I realized I was out of vanilla so I used almond or some sort instead.

Although these doughnuts tasted delicious, the dough was so sticky that it was a complete mess while making them. I think the flour ratio is wrong in this recipe.The second time I made them I used 3 and a half cups of flour and the doughnuts turned out much better and the dough was easy to handle. My friends loved them!!

A bit sticky.  I added about 1/2 cup more flour when mixing and then kneaded in about 1/4 cup more when it was chilled. Other than that, great recipe!

This recipe is wonderful,I would give it 10 stars if I could! Crispy on the outside and moist and cakey on the inside. I don't like rolling them out so I just made drop "donut holes".  I prefer them without the sugar on top so I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough.  They are a hit with my family and I will use this recipe often.

I've never made doughnuts before and these were great!  Like the others, it did require a bit more flour than required in the recipe, but once I got into the doughnut groove, they turned out beautiful.  Will definitely make these again!

This hit the spot with my doughnut cravings. I used all wheat flour. I added vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon.I fried mine in a small pot on my stove with no problem. I flatted the dough in my hand until it was 1 inch. We could't wait for icing.

After reading the first couple of reviews I was a little worried about this recipe.  However when I made the recipe for myself I found it to be perfect.  The dough was perfect.  Just need to be sure to flour the board and the rolling pin.  These cakey doughnuts came out wonderful.

We love trying new doughnut recipes and were excited about this one. Much to our dissappointment, the dough had the consistency of cake batter. We thought it owuld firm up when chilled, but it didn't. We had to add more flour, approx 1.5-2 cups more, to get the right dough cosistency. When cooked, they had lost all flavor.

I made only doughnut balls with this one.  I followed the recipe and used the cinnamon sugar coating but I did not like the outcome.  This doughnut has no taste.  I offerred it to my 5-year olds and they ate one and were done.  I guess it wasn't a big hit with them either.  My husband, you ask?  No, he did not like it.
But...if you just coat it with confectioners sugar instead, it's not so bad.  I used a heart cookie cutter with half the recipe and was surprised to find out it kept the shape of the heart.

Most recipes I make are mainly to fill my husbands hungry belly. If it's one I'm making for the first time, his opinion is the only one that matters. If he takes more than one serving, I know it's a keeper. He could eat these doughnuts on his own, so I am sharing them with my coworkers. I will never buy store bought again, and will not change anything in this recipe, delicious!

I got out the old family recipe (at least 100 years old) and compared it to yours. In mine, the flour measurement was the same, but everything else was about doubled (2 eggs,  1/2 to 1 teaspoon nutmeg, scant teaspoon cinnamon, 1 tsp salt, 1 1/2 Tablespoons BP, 3/4 cup sugar) except for the milk which was less at 3/4 cup. We never heard of putting the dough in the refrigerator. The main thing to watch for in getting tender doughnuts with crispy crust is to handle the dough gently and don't add much flour in the rolling (or patting) out process or  the doughnuts will be like rocks. The cut out doughnuts should rest for 15 minutes before frying. And the temperature of the oil on this family recipe is 425 degrees F ! We dusted the fried doughnuts from our old recipe with powdered sugar while still warm. I have to tell you, they were the best!

Based on the ingredient amounts, this dough is unusable. I had to add in at least one more cup of flour, maybe two as I was looking for the correct consistency. You are looking for a dough that is sticky, but not like Elmer's glue. Because of the additional flour, the cinnamon and nutmeg amounts are off. Best to refrigerate overnight.

I followed the recipe exactly. I even added extra flour at the end to help the tackiness of the dough.  The donuts were so sticky and gooey that I couldn't even pick them up to put them over in the oil. I ended up having to spoon the dough into the oil and we had all different shapes of donut holes..they weren't even that good. They were at the very most tolerable but I will never make this recipe again.

I found it not workable for ring-shaped doughnuts because, even after refrigeration, it is still way too gooey/sticky to roll.

Just like Mom used make!! I liked the recipe very much, changed the milk to buttermilk, added 1/2 cup more of flour and left out the cinnamon. Didn't refrigerate dough, just rolled out and cut with doughnut cutter and deep fried. They came out like my Mom used to make. Her recipe was from the Rumford Cook Book, dated 1908. The doughnuts were perfect.

So easy and delicious! You absolutely don't need a fry cooker to make these at home. I used 3/4c milk as suggested by others, and forgot the vanilla, and I think these are PERFECT. I grabbed a handful of dough, rolled it out on a floured surface to about the same thickness that I would for sugar cookies. I used a mason jar lid to cut out the donuts, a children's Tylenol measuring cup for the centers (see how fancy I am?) and about 1-1.5" of oil in a small saucepan. The donuts took about 1 min or less per side. Cooked the centers also and they made perfect donut holes. Dusted with powdered sugar. These turned out just like the mini donuts that we love at the local coffee shop. We will make these again and again!

I followed this recipe with one substitution - I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  all other quantities of ingredients are correct.  This makes a very soft dough BUT it is important to chill it for the minimum, to have the oil hot enough AND to not crowd the fryer...

I was generous with the flour when handling the dough - after the dough chilled, I rolled the ball of dough in flour, then hand pressed the dough to the desired thickness, trying to not handle it too much.  I then made my shapes by hand just as I was ready to drop them in the oil.  I had a helper so the assembly line went smoothly.
These cake donuts are what I consider to be cake donuts - light enough and not too dense, but not as light as bread / yeast donuts.  And I agree with others, they are good too the next day but beyond that, you'll need a good cup of tea or coffee to go with it!

I liked this recipe though I changed a few things. First I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup white all purpose flour, and 1/2 cup soy flour. I also used 1 cup spenda instead of 1/2 cup white flour and I changed 1/2 tsp nutmeg to 1 tsp and it turned out splendid. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I really thought they came out well- especially as this was my first time making homemade doughnuts. Very easy. The only thing I will do differently next time is not put in the nutmeg. The doughnuts had a distinct "spice" taste to them, which while great for the fall season, I would rather avoid the rest of the year.

This was a good flavored cake.  It is very runny but put enough flour and it is good.  Also can make a good chocolate cake donut by putting in Hershey's unsweetened chocolate mixed into the dry products, about 11/2 oz and let it set after donuts are cut to raise a little before frying.

These are AMAZING with a few tweaks suggested by the other reviews. 1cup is a bit too much milk, I used a little less than a 4th cup less than that. And I rounded my scoops of flour while measuring.

This made a perfect consistency and I only chilled about 20 minuts.

I either did something wrong, or its the recipe. Mine came out more doughy then cakey. Plus as others mentioned it was very hard to work with. Had to keep adding flour to work with it. By the time I got the process down and got them all made, I was not impressed with the taste or consistency.  I gave it 3 for the ok taste, and easiness of the recipe.

This was my first time making donuts.  I took the dough out a little early and ended up needing to put it back in the fridge for a while.  I did use lots of flour when I was rolling it and didn't add any extra to the recipe.  I tried powered sugar as well as cinnamon and sugar for coating, but should have made sure the donuts were cooled all the way :) Very yummy!

This recipe was good!  The dough is sticky (frying and baking have very different requirements for doughs), but a heavily floured surface and rolling pin make it manageable.    I was expecting the end product to be a bit denser--like Krispy Kreme's cake doughnuts--while these were more airy through the center.  I also didn't mind my oil temperature as well as I should have (it got hotter than 370º) and a few of the doughnuts ended up doughy in the center.  All in all, it was a good recipe.  Quicker to prepare than yeast doughnuts because of the lack of rise-time, and just as doughnut-y for when that fried-pastry craving strikes!

This recipe gets five stars if you add more flour. Without the extra, they are too sticky to roll out.  Other than that, the recipe is great.

No good! I may have made an error somewhere, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. I thought I followed everything exactly, but the dough was beyond sticky. It was like mud and super glue mixed together. It really had lost all hope before hitting the oil.

My kids and I just made these and they turned out great.  I didn't refrigerate it (kids couldn't wait) and used the spoon drop drop method as well.  Not too sweet at all. I will definitely be making these again.

Just made this for the first time, followed the recipe but left it in the fridge for 2 hours, great results. Dough is a little sticky, but a light dusting of flour before rolling took care of that. thanks

Used this recipe as written in my old Hamilton Beach Donut Maker.  Thought it would make them a little healthier.  My husband wants them fried, so will try it that way next time.  These are easy and quick to make.

Made these yesterday, and also made my usual recipe.  They are excellent as my husband said. He prefers this recipe.  I added a fair amount of flour to my flouring board ( the dough was a bit soft & sticky).  Turned out great! Next time I will reduce the cinnamon slightly.  Now the grandkids will be the judges @ Thanksgiving!  They love doughnuts.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe twice since Sunday. The first time was with my 12 yrs. old niece, she had fun and the donuts tasted great. Didn't take long to get the hang of making the donuts. My teenage sons enjoyed this recipe. Will make this again and again.

Let me start by saying these doughnuts do taste great.  I passed out the doughnut holes to the neighbor kids only to find out that all the parents ate them them "shared" some w/the kids.  I had to take more over and everyone talked about them for the rest of the day.  I did have trouble w/the dough.  I didn't read the other reviews 1st.  It was so sticky that I couldn't even work with it.  I added much more flour until it was manageable.  I think that it may have turned out better if the dough was left in overnight.  I would suggest that if you're just making doughnuts for the kids to just use the pillsbury buttermilk biscuits and fry them.  It's much easier and the kids LOVE them.  They will certainly choose them over the homemade ones here.  I will make these for the adults though.

I think there was too much liquid for the amount of dry ingredients listed.  However, after kneading in enough flour to roll the dough out, they were easy enough to cut and fry.   After the doughnuts drained and cooled a bit, I shook them in a bag of cinnamon and sugar.  I haven't  tried one yet, but after making them yesterday, my family has put a huge dent in the eighteen doughnuts the recipe yielded.  They tell me the doughnuts are better than any cake doughnuts they've had from a store or bakery.  For my first time making homemade doughnuts, these turned out better than I expected!

Tried these today, as I have had a bad graving for a good cake doughnut.  Well it past the test.  Yes the dough was very sticky.  However, coming from a line of chefs & bakers, knew I needed to add more flour (a little at a time) to be able to handle the dough satisfactory.  My husband enjoyed them very much and they will be repeated when the urge hits.

fantastic!! the dough was easy to make and can be made overnight. I noticed that others complained the dough was to sticky .. this is true, the trick though is to flower surface well and pat your hands with flower ( lightly coating the dough). this makes the dough manageable and causes a lot less stress! :)

Excellent and simple recipe!  No problems with too little flour.  I use ample flour when rolling out the dough.  These doughnuts crisp up perfectly on the outside and have a wonderful "melt in your mouth" cake texture inside.  My husband and kids love this recipe!  Have made it twice so far.

My kids loved these.  I tried cooking them two different ways.  First I dropped small teaspoon sized amounts of batter into the deep fryer.  They didn't look that great but my son said "They taste better than they look!"  Then I tried them rolled out and they turned out great.  The key to these turning out is putting lots of flour on the counter and lots ontop of the dough when rolling it out.

Very good!  I didn't use the nutmeg and they still had wonderful flavor!  You do need quite a bit more flour when you are rolling out the dough as it will stick to your board/surface.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I had always wanted to try and make a cake doughnut and never knew it could be this easy!!

I dont know what I could have done wrong but these did not set well at all. I would have to add another cup of flour or more to even be able to attempt to roll them out. We tried to make donut holes instead, but it was still a mess. I will not make again.

To be fair, I am not an Iron Chef, but after following these instructions precisely, I ended up with a mush that was impossible to mold into any shape that remotely resembled a doughnut, I ended up with dough balls that were extreamly dense. I called them Iranian Christmas balls and fed them to my family; most of them have recovered.

I wouldn't recommend this recipe. I was so hopeful in turning out a wonderful doughnut but it lacked flavor above all. The dough was entirely too sticky. I had it sitting in the fridge over night and after taking it out the texture was no different than when it went in, ridiculously sticky. I had to have added about a half a cup more flour in an attempt to roll them out and they were still sticky. Besides that, I just thought that these doughtnuts lacked flavor. My husband and daughter were so disappointed!!

"Better than Krispy Kreme" is what my husband said about these doughnuts.  The dough did need more flour to roll out properly, not the end of the world. I made a glaze with 1 T. melted butter, dash each vanilla and maple flavor, 1 1/2-2 c pwd sugar and milk or coffee to thin.  *Coffee really enhances the maple flavor.

Well, I don't know how anyone would be able to make doughnuts out of this dough, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I couldn't even roll the dough into balls to make doughnut holes.  Instead, I just dropped dough by rounded tsps into hot oil, and ended up with interesting fried dough.  They didn't taste bad at all.  Just not what I was looking for.

Delicious! I followed the ingredients exactly as written. Since I didn't plan ahead, I put the dough in the freezer for 15min instead of an hour in the fridge. The dough was slightly tacky, but not extremely so.  I just patted the dough out instead of rolling since it was so soft.
My first few donuts came out with wonky shapes because my dough was too thin but by the end they looked donut shop perfect.

I made these and they turned out great.  As others have said the dough is sticky but liberal use of flour on your work surface and tools make short work of it.  I made a great maple icing for them.

Not a doughnut dough at all. It makes a fairly loose batter, which you will find many tother comments agree.
I checked a dozen or so other cake doughnut recipes, and you have two to two and a half the amount of milk for the sam mflour.
Of course you will not admit it, and probably won't print this.

I did not add nutmeg due to an allergy and just compensated an extra half tsp of cinnamon! I also had to fry in both canola and vegetable oils due to allergies! Both were received very well! This is definitely one of the best cake recipes I have tried! I especially liked that you actually roll and cut the dough rather then having to use a doughnut dropper!  I am definitely going to make it again!! For those who are complaining about the tackiness of the dough, that is why your refrigerate the dough! Perhaps you need to refrigerate it longer?

This was the fifth time I made this recipe.  I made them while camping with relatives - they were a hit!  My only changes are reducing the milk to 3/4 cup.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the success of this recipe is 1) using a thermometer to heat the oil to 370 degrees and keeping it at that temp; 2) have plenty of flour on your mat and rolling pin while rolling out the dough, and 3) make your dough and refrigerate the night before, especially if you are working in a warmer environment.  LOVE this recipe!

I have made this recipe five times. It is now a family favorite. Here are my suggestions. This is a sticky dough. It's supposed to be. I suggest refrigerating for at least two hours to make it easier to handle. Make sure the board and cutter are well-floured. But do not add more flour or knead more flour into the dough.  Make sure oil is at proper temperature (I use a candy thermometer). Cut each doughnut immediately before adding to the hot oil. Otherwise, they tend to spread out,  lose their shape, and stick to the board. Fry three or four at a time so you can ensure they don't over- or under- cook. Enjoy!

Making this again now.  First time, drops from a spoon were too big (golf ball).  When in oil, they get much bigger, and the center is raw.  So, smaller drops.  Clearly, I needed a rolling pin and a cutter.  Today, I have these luxuries!  They were excellent when the size was right (1/4 to 3/8 inch thick).  
A couple or a few hours in the fridge after minimum mixing, and using (the minimum amount of) flour on both sides to keep the dough from sticking is necessary.
The oil temp is hard to control on a stove top and slow to correct.  The heaviest cast frying pan you have makes it easier.  Just 4 or 5 at a time.  Keep fine tuning your stove control.  It will eventually stabilize.  A thermometer like the type used to deep fry turkeys is perfect.  Don't let it touch the bottom of the pan.
High protein flour is OK, but minimum mixing is a must.  If you put the dough leftovers together, those donuts are tougher.  The more you handle it, the tougher it gets.  (You don't want gluten development.)  Yes, cake flour is best, but doesn't anyone care about pants that fit???

These turned out great. I substituted out the dairy (almond milk for the milk and 1/4 cup apple sauce for the butter). The dough was very wet, so I turned it out onto a floured surface, floured the top, and gently patted it out. The holes were easy to fry, but the doughnuts were pretty fragile, so I used a spatula to transfer them to the oil. Cooled them on paper towels and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon.

After reading the reviews, I decided to just follow the recipe as written.  They turned out great.  I also made up the dough the night before and left them in the fridge over night.  I patted out the dough and cut out the donuts and let them warm slightly while the oil was heating.  After frying, I set them on a rack to drain for a couple minutes then put them in a bowl of cinnamon sugar and rolled to coat.  Easy. Tasty. Classic.

Comparing with other cake donut recipes I concluded that the amount of milk should be half of what the recipe calls for.I mixed up a double batch and I had to add another cup of flour . The dough was still a bit soft,but I can handle it since I used to be a baker for Dunkin Donuts for many years.Well,I now have the dough in the refrigerator and I will make the donuts tomorrow morning.Let's see what happens.
  Well,I made the donuts the next day early in the afternoon. The dough had became firmer than before and it was perfect to handle. I fried the donuts and the donut holes and they came out great. I had prepared a glaze with powdered sugar and a little bit warm water and added vanilla flavoring .dipped the donuts in the glaze ,let it drip and then rolled some in peanut meal and others in Dutch Crumb mix. Everyone devoured them

I've made them twice. The first time they were gooy and had to add mega flour to stiffen them up.  This time I added 1/2 cup more flour put the in the fridge for an hour and in the freezer for 15 min. came out perfect. It's the only two times I made donuts

Rather than using a cookie cutter, I used a greased melon baller and only made "donut holes." Note that they fluff up tremendously. They were fluffy and delicious.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe as I was after a simple recipe that didn't involve yeast etc. This was my first time making doughnuts aswell! After having a browse at other's comments beforehand I paid particular attention to not over cooking and added extra flour when rolling out as it is a rather wet/sticky dough. But it tested just like the real thing, makes heaps of doughnuts and my whole family was pleased, will definitely make again.

They were great with powdered sugar on them but were very bland by themselves. Thinking about re-making them with a bit more sugar. The dough was VERY sticky so I had to knead in some flour before I could roll it. They were VERY fluffy when they were done! My boyfriend loved them! Definitely going to make them again!

These were okay flavored but far too sticky. Melting the butter is a mistake and only half the milk is needed. The flavor is okay, I didnt add the cinnamon and sugar since I wanted actual cake donuts, not coated. They were pretty bland but edible with a coating.

I tried this recipe and the donuts turned out great. I will admit that the batter was scary at first because they were so sticky but after rolling out and using more floor it turned out fine. I read that others added more flour to their mixture but I was sceptical. By rolling the batter in extra flour it solved the problem very well.  Next time I may go ahead and add extra flour to batter itself. I also added more nutmeg and cinnamon for extra flavor and it turned out wonderful. Great recipe and great advice from you all with extra tips.

WE loved these! I didn't think it was possible to make really good, REAL, like from the donut shop donuts. But this recipe makes it possible! It was so simple and the donuts turned out just beautifully and yummy! I did find my batter a little sticky,  not much, but when I put the batter on the floured surface and rolled it around, that made the dough perfect. That being said, flour density varies from bag to bag, so I don't think there is a problem with the recipe, I believe it has more to do with the type and brand of flour being used. This is now a family favorite! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made the recipe two times as instructed, and even took anothers recommendation to cut the milk to 2/3 cup.The first batch required the full cup, while the second required less than a cup.I also warmed the milk to room temperature as other recipes noted. I didnt have a bit of trouble getting the dough to the right consistency, and they were light and fluffy when fried. If I had rolled them out, Id surely have needed more flour though. My problem is they really didnt have any flavor. Ive been trying various recipes Ive found online trying to get the distinct taste that my Grandmothers did, but to no avail.Im thinking she used more nutmeg than most recipes call for. My adult son, whom I live with, loves having fresh donuts weekly, and not a single complaint about these. I guess Ill have to tweak this recipe a bit. I didnt roll mine out, I dropped them by teaspoonfuls as this is his preference. Personally, I think a lot of people arent taking into consideration the extra flour theyd use when they have to form the dough to roll it out. Most fry cake recipes advise 3 cups flour, 2 1/2 cups to the mix, and the remainder mixed in as you try to handle it, and roll it out. Too much flour tends to make the donuts dry.

I followed the words of the folks who said this dough was too wet. Those folks omitted 1/4 to 1/3 of the milk. I eye balled it and omitted a little over a 1/4. It was still WAY too wet. I chilled it for over 3 hours. I resorted to flouring my hands LIBERALLY, rolling it into balls and flattening the balls to less than 1/4 inch thick before frying. Any thicker and the outside was a hair from burnt and the very center was raw. I tried cooking with oil at the recommended temp, then reduced it to 360 when it was leaving it raw in the middle. On the upside though, they did taste good, my wife and 2 year old liked them. I would try this again but with either 1/4 cup of milk, or leave out the milk altogether.

These were a hit, kids loved them. I used floured parchment paper to roll them out on, seemed to work really well. I had tried the counter before using the parchment and it created a huge mess.

The recipe didn't impress me. The dough was sticky and to me it wasn't worth the time it took to prepare and cook. I think you would've needed to subtract some of the milk from the recipe and maybe a little more refrigeration time. Overall, I wasn't impressed.

When i made these doughnuts i did not use 1 cup milk i used about 1/4-1/3 cup like some of the reviews suggested. The dough rolled out great; it wasn't too sticky or too dry. The doughnuts also cut out well from the dough once you've floured your cutters. The problem was that they weren't thoroughly cooked after frying. Perhaps the oil was to hot (did not have a thermometer to measure the temperature to 370 degrees) or i should have rolled the dough to a thinner thickness. but overall i'm sure if the oil was at the right temperature  and doughnuts at the right thickness that they would have turned out wonderful. (it probably has a little too much cinnamon for my liking)

These are AWESOME! I made these this morning for my family and I'm taking leftovers to work. The flavoring of the doughnut is perfect with nutmeg and cinnamon! I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar after cooling and they were delicious. Perfect for a fall morning. Don't forget to flour the surface and also sprinkle the top of the sticky dough ball with flour before rolling it. Yes, the dough is sticky but that's what makes them so dense and moist. We'll definitely make these again.... often!

Very good. I dropped teaspoon fulls of the dough instead of shaping it like a doughnut because it makes it a lot easier.

I sized this recipe to only 4 servings because I was the only one at home. It made a wonderful dough-I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  They also deep fried very well. But, I am only giving these 4 stars because they are still not the fluffy cake doughnut I am looking for. The texture is a bit grainy, but it also has a good flavor. Thanks!

These were just o.k. They didn't wow us at all. The dough was extremeley hard to work with, and I had to add so much extra flour. It was still sticky after that. I'm going to search for another recipe. I may try this one again, and work with it for improvement. Sorry!

I made the dough the night before and leave it overnight in the fridge and it did a little bit sticky but it will not be a problem to roll if you flour the board & pin and also you hand. It did turn out perfect & was served for breakfast.  Sure a keeper.

These turned out really well.  I add the zest of half a lemon and half an orange.  I drained them on paper towels for a few minutes before coating them in icing sugar or the granulated sugar cinnamon combo.  The boys in my house loved them!
