This is my husband's favorite! I always make this when having the Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken from this same website. We like to put the slaw on top of the sanwich...yummy!

Fantastic and so easy! I took this to a dinner party and everyone raved about it. I think the celery and lemon juice are what makes this so good as they add a crisp flavor different from most mayo based coleslaw, yet you can't taste the lemon. I will be making this often as I'm trying to add more cabbage into our diet.

This was soooo good! I liked eating it best right away better than leftover the next day.  I omitted the celery and didn't use a mix: instead I just used regular cabbage and a little red onion.  I was looking for a way to use up my blue cheese and this is the way to go! Thanks for the recipe, jodi! I will use this again and again -- great twist on ordinary coleslaw!

This was amazing!  I followed the recipe almost exactly (I used a bit less lemon and a bit more blue cheese) I also used packaged coleslaw, but with lots of extra julienned carrots and extra red cabbage.  This one is going in my favorites!

I really enjoyed this salad.  I didn't think that the coleslaw mix with cabbage would stand up to the dressing, so I used broccoli slaw and thought it was great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

YUM! One of my husband's favorite meals is Divinesolace21's buffalo chicken sandwiches. Although good, I've never liked them as much as he does. I enjoy the combo of buffalo wings and blue cheese together, so I thought this might be a good addition to our sandwiches. I'm SOOOOO glad I tried this!!! Not only did my confirmed blue cheese-hating hubs like this, I absolutely LOVED how it complemented Divine's sandwiches! :) The blue cheese and lemon dressing tamed the heat and paired BEAUTIFULLY together!!! NOTE: Only make as much of this as you will eat in one sitting (this does not keep well!). Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Jodi. You've cleverly found a way to turn a so-so meal into something that even I now enjoy! :-)

I don't like regular coleslaw, so I'm always looking for different ways to make it because the crunch is so nice especially in the summer!  This recipe is awesome and a great side dish for any buffalo chicken sandwich type meal.

I used this as a topping for Spicy Pulled Pork Sliders. The blue cheese balanced the spicy pork perfectly!  Based upon other reviews, i did use a bit less lemon and a little more cheese.

This was really different and pretty good.  I was disapointed the next day though, as coleslaws are usually better the next day - the blue cheese in the slaw was too over-powering!  Better to eat it all up the same day!

Was looking for something different to have with chicken wings. I forgot to buy blue cheese so I used blue cheese dressing and omitted the mayo. Yum. It is great on hotdogs too.

This is wonderful and my fianc√© loves it! I am not a blu cheese fan but this is just so delicious! When I make this I omit the onion and celery but add bacon! The bacon, blu cheese, mayo and lemon really combines well and adds great flavor!

I love this recipe!! My go to coleslaw and always gets rave reviews. Have made it probably 20 times now and can't believe it took me this long to review. Only thing i do differently is cut down on the lemons used - a little too tart otherwise. The green onions and celery give it a wonderful texture and kick

I enjoyed this coleslaw and was impressed by how easy and good it was. I was like, "wow did I make this?!" But my husband was not a fan. He said it should have been sweeter and he said he'd never heard of bleu cheese in cole slaw--but he has cuz one of our favorite restaurants prepares it as so! Next time I will try one of those vinegar based slaws they serve at our favorite BBQ restaurant...he loves that!

Good stuff!  didn't have any green onions so I sprinkled in some onion powder as well as a little garlic salt and fresh ground pepper.   Very freshing coleslaw.  I topped some buffalo chicken burgers with it and it was delicious.

I was very impressed with this recipe.  My boyfriend even ate it (plus seconds) and he's not a vegetable eater.  I paired it with homemade buffalo wings and it was a perfect meal!

I thought this was really good.  I had a super large lemon on hand so I just used one and I added one packet of splenda for a hint of sweet.  Also, I had radishes on hand so I used about 7 of them julienned.  very yummy!  (served it with the pulled pork recipe on this site)  This is my first review, it was THAT good!

Wow, I made a small change in that I don't like to add vinegar or lemon juice but loved the idea of bleu cheese!  I had just made some bleu cheese  dressing and so added some to the coleslaw (just a spoonful of coleslaw to a dab of bleu cheese dressing) it was amazing and I will never fail to make this.  I am a great lover of Roquefort cheese and this time only had some bleu cheese but it was truly delicious.  My husband doesn't care  for coleslaw and ate a double serving after he tasted it.

I am always asked for this recipe! I use less lemon juice and I like to add raisins or dried cranberries for a little sweetness. The last time I made it I used one bag of coleslaw mix and one bag of brocolli slaw and I liked the extra crunch.

This is a fabulous recipe and when I make it everyone wants the recipe.  I actually mix mayonnaise with plain greek yogurt to equal 1/3 cup.

This was excellent, especially when used on top of pulled pork.  I did replace the celery with water chestnuts, just because I am not a fan of celery.  It really gave the slaw a great nuttiness that went really well with the blue cheese

Great Recipe- a fun take on regular coleslaw. Had this for the first time at a baby shower and we al loved it! Making it tonight with the slow cooker pulled pork recipe from this site. 
Tip= I decrease the blue cheese from this recipe by a 1/3 of a cup b/c I find it to be very strong if I don't.

A really refreshing change from standard coleslaw dressing! Instead of using the crumbled blue cheese and mayonnaise I simply used my favorite Marie's Chunky Blue Cheese brand salad dressing in a jar (found in the produce section) to coat the shredded cabbage and then added the fresh lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. I love your idea of the addition of celery and green onions, too! Was going to give your recipe a five star but am giving it a four because of the error amount of 6 'stalks' of celery instead of 6 'ribs'. ;-)

Omitted green onions and celery. Used one lemon and added celery seed. Used 1/2 cup mayo and I/2 cup light sour cream. Great!

Delicious!  I made it for memorial weekend and it was fantastic!  I was a little concerned with the blue cheese and lemon combo, but it was great!  I'm even making it again this weekend, and Memorial weekend was last weekend.  I just have to have it again.  I didn't change anything except I used light Hellmen's Mayonaise.

This was very tasty - and easy!  We love blue cheese dressing, blue cheese with fruit and nuts for appetizer or desert, blue cheese on burgers and steaks, but I had never thought of using blue cheese with coleslaw.  It seems like the strong flavor of the cabbage would clash with the strong flavor of the blue cheese, but that is not the case - it was really nice!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used about half the lemon juice, and it was perfect for this family.  I served this with the Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches (from this site) and fresh fruit - the slaw was the best part of the meal, as we thought the chicken was extremely salty and this was a nice foil for all that salt. Thank you, jodi, for a nice addition to the recipe box!

This was wonderful.  The perfect companion to a buffalo chicken sandwich.
