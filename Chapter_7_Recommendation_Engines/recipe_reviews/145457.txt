Hi - I am the cook that entered this recipe and as I was reading through the reviews about the warm cream I realized that one important word had been left out of the instructions - "CHILL"! After you pour the cream mixture into the glasses put the glasses into the fridge until chilled- THEN add the berries. It will thicken a bit but won't set up into a really stiff mixture. Sorry for the omission on the original contribution.

This is a good recipe, with a few changes. After reading through it, it sounded like it would be a rather runny sauce that you topped with some sliced strawberries. I didn't really want that...so I made a couple changes. First of all, I whipped the cream instead of boiling it. I folded the sour cream mixture into the whipped cream, and really liked the results. It was smooth, creamy, rich, and lightly sweet. Also, because we are a non-alcohol family, I used 1/4 tsp. of orange extract instead of the orange liqueur. This gave it a pleasant and slight orange flavor which really complimented the strawberries. I used more like 4 cups of berries, and layered them in wine glasses along with the cream. The end results were beautiful and very tasty. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!!

I made this recipe for the recipe group... Here's my review: This recipe was AMAZING! We never have alcohol of any kind in our house, so we (my sister and I made this together) used orange extract in place of the Grand Marnier (I've heard that orange juice concentrate would also work...). Another change we made is that we whipped up the cream with the yogurt, sugar, vanilla, orange extract, and sour cream instead of heating it on the stove. Them we made a parfait (check out Larkspur's awesome photo) This was PHENOMENAL! Thanks so much! :)

I made this as my first participation in the Recipe Group and my entire family is soooo happy that I did! The thought of warm whipping cream mixed with the other ingredients didn't really sound like something we would enjoy. So, I whipped the cream and folded it into the yogurt/sour cream mixture. I also used Patron Citronge Orange Liqueur (perfect substitution!) then layered the strawberries and cream, added a couple of orange segments and chilled for a couple of hours before dinner. This turned out to be perfect for us. My husband has already started giving me other ideas to change this up with other fruits/flavors. He really loved this and thinks "The Recipe "Thingy"" I participated in is a great idea! Thank you Recipe Group and thank you to the submitter of this recipe for sharing!

Even though I messed up and got a tub of Whipped Cream versus getting Whipping Cream, it turned out very nice. I just folded in the whipping cream versus cooking the cream as the directions say. My mess up tasted fantastic. It was a very light desert. I layered the strawberries into a glass grated some chocolate on top. It looked great as well.

I really wish I had read the comments before making this. It was a huge mistake. I expected a light, fluffy dessert that was cold and yummy. Instead what I found was a very thin cream. Everyone who enjoyed this "fixed" the recipe and to me that means they created their own. When whipping cream is heated it loses the enzyme which allows it to whip. Thus you are left with a runny mess. I was not pleased and will not make this again. I wish people had registered stars that were associated with this recipe and not their own versions of it. I'm sure their versions are fine, however, that's not the recipe "as written".

I made this for Recipe Group. My first thought is, warm cream, gag me with a spoon. However, I was pleasantly surprised I must say. It was actually quite good. I used more sour cream in place of the yogurt as I don't use plain yogurt and didn't want to get a big tub that wouldn't get used. I subbed the Grand Marnier with orange juice and a little lemon extract. It still tasted a little like a creamsicle, but with the strawberries, gave a very nice flavor. I probably would not make this again unless I whipped the whipping cream and folded everything together and used it chilled. It does make for an elegant dessert that would finish off a meal with something not too sweet and not too tart. Thanks Hoonde for the recipe.

I made this in the morning so it could chill.  Then I used it as a sauce for a berry trifle with frozen pound cake and chilled it until dessert time.  It was fabulous and a huge hit with our guests

This is a fantastic recipe that I'll be making again! I cut the recipe in half as there were only 2 of us...I used Triple Sec instead of Grand Marnier, as that was what I had on hand. My husband gave it 4 out of 5 stars which is a super good rating from him! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this as the Recipe Exchange Group recipe for the week of April 19th. The cream mixture, when warm, tastes good, but I couldn't wrap my mind around it with cold strawberries (though I probably could have eaten it that way). So I made our dessert glasses and chilled them. When I served it my husband asked me if this was melted ice cream. Of course I told him no, it isn't, but in reality, that's pretty much what it is. So tomorrow the remaining 6 servings are going in my ice cream maker. As a note to anyone looking to sub orange extract for the Grand Marnier, I subbed 1/2 tsp. and personally I thought that wasn't enough. My husband could not taste the orange flavor at all, either. I'd use a full teaspoon next time. Thank you for the recipe, I think I'd actually have given this 5 stars if I'd made it the way some of the others did with whipping the cream beforehand! EDIT 4/22/10: I did put the remainder in my ice cream machine with another 1/2 tsp. orange extract & the sliced berries. The leftovers made a satisfying ice cream.

This was easy to make and pretty good. Although I made it exactly according to the recipe this time, next time I will whip the heavy cream first and add the other ingedients, as other reviewers have done. I just think the consistency would be nicer that way. Thanks for a delicious and different recipe.

Words truly can't describe this one. Made non-alcoholic (baby on board!) by substituting 1/2 tsp orange extract for the Grand Marnier. Increased sugar to 3/4c. Did not boil the cream - I whipped the whipped cream until stiff in one bowl, and beat the remaining ingredients in another. Then gently whisked the two together. Used a mix of fresh strawberries, and frozen mixed berries. DELISH!!!

As I'm British, I've copied the British measurements for this recipe below.

250ml soured cream
100g caster sugar
120ml natural yoghurt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons Grand Marnier
475ml double cream
1 punnet fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced

I was looking for something that was not only quick and easy to put together but that also looked impressive for my dinner party.  This recipe fitted the bill perfectly.  As Grand Marnier is so expensive, I used brandy mixed with orange oil to replace it for this recipe.  It worked perfectly well.  As strawberries are currently out of season, I topped with orange segments instead and then served with some home-made biscuits.  The only thing I think that I would add is that YOU MUST CHILL these for a couple of hours to allow them to set. For some reason, this appears to be omitted from the recipe.  A refreshingly good, sophisticated dessert that my guests loved.

Like others who have reviewed this recipe I replaced cool whip for heavy whipping cream (skipped the stove for this recipe), and orange extract in the place of flavored brandy. This was served chilled with Almond Shortbread I from this site.  Yummy!!

I followed other reviewers suggestions and whipped the cream cold instead of heating it.  I then folded it carefully with the remaining ingredients.  I also used light sour cream and that worked fine.  We enjoyed it, but I'm only giving it four stars because I wasn't a huge fan of the orange flavor.  Next time I might try something else--stick with only vanilla, or maybe add almond extract instead.

I made this for the Recipe Group.  I was kind of scared of this recipe. Warm cream/milk has never really appealed to me. But I will say this is really good and the kids really enjoyed it, hubby wouldn't try it warm so he chilled his. Not overpoweringly sweet which is nice. I did sub 2 T of orange juice for the liqueur since we aren't big drinkers and I would never use a whole bottle, and kids were eating this as well. It gave it a light citrus taste but was not over powering. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a bit thinner than I would have liked, but the flavor was good.  When I have had it before it had a custard consistency and the recipe included unflavored gelatin.  I made one dish with just strawberries and the rest I used a mixture of frozen blackberries, raspberries and strawberries.

I made this recipe for Recipe Group.  I subbed Splenda for the sugar and RF sour cream for the full fat version.  I tasted it while it was still warm and knew I would prefer it chilled.  I used Grand Marnier and did not taste a strong orange flavor as some of the others who subbed orange juice or orange extract.  I halved the recipe and still put it in 9 small serving dishes, plenty for a light dessert.

This was a very refreshing and simple dessert. As suggested by another reviewer, I served it cold and didn't cook the cream, I just layered with the strawberries and grated some chocolate on the top, which is a really nice complement to this dessert.

I used lowfat sour cream (on hand) and vanilla yogurt (on hand AND vanilla is called for in the recipe). I did halve the recipe, but followed the cooking instructions as written, heating the cream to almost boiling. This was served at room temperature and the leftovers were delicious cold with berries mixed throughout. I will make this again.

This was a lovely recipe, easy  to prepare and the results were very nice. Paired with the strawberries, the cream was delicious, on its own it tasted like a orange creamcicle, which I didn't care for. It was a hit with my husband and son. I will definitely make this to serve with shortcake and as a dip for fresh fruit. I used oj instead of the liqueur b/c I made this for my children. I also did not heat the cream, just as a matter of saving time. But I can imagine that serving this warm with a strawberry crisp would be nice too. Great pick Recipe Group!

I followed other users advice and did not heat the cream. I whipped the heavy cream and in another bowl mixed all ingredients except the liquor then added it to the whipped cream. I added lemon zest then refrigerated. I marinated raspberries and blueberries in Grand Marnier and placed berries on top. All of my guests raved about it!!!! They all asked for the recipe. Very light and refreshing on a hot summer day ??

I made this for snacking and dessert this week. It's so creamy, smooth and delicious! It's like a Romanoff sauce for strawberries but a 1000 times better. It's a new favorite in our home and will be made frequently.

I would give it 5 stars for taste but, as many others have pointed out, scalding the cream was a bit of a mystery. I tried it but it never thickened, even when cooled, so I chilled it, whipped it, & folded it into the sour cream/yogurt. Cut back on the sugar a little & used half grand marnier/half triple sec. The flavor was delightful. I layered it in parfaits with some leftover 
plum puree which worked out well. Will make it again.

The flavor was good but it never really"set" for me.  I think next time I may just use cool whip instead of the whipping cream as it came out more like thickened milk.  Or maybe I will whip the cream first and not heat it.  Definitly worth a second try.
