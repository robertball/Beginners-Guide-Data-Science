I loved these! 
I found that the texture is more like a quick bread than a bar cookie.

This is  - quite simply - gingerbread!  Sorry, but this should not be classified as a bar cookie. It is, however,  good, moist,  delicious gingerbread!  Will serve it cut in squares with a lemon or orange sauce.  I used 1 C brown sugar & 1 C Splenda and  subbed Canola oil for shortning.  Turned out perfect!

These are good - the texture is sort of between a bar cookie and cake.  They're a bit heavy on clove for my taste.  I think next time around I'd probably cut the clove in half and maybe add a vanilla/powdered sugar drizzle instead of the granulated sugar.  Possibly a thin cream cheese frosting.  But as they are I can see how they'd be a great one for gifting - they would travel well in a tin.

Delicious! Would describe it as more of a "spice cake" recipe rather than a bar recipe.

Oh my deliciousness! I love cloves, so had to give this a try. I substituted nutmeg for half of the cinnamon but other than that I kept to the recipe. Amazing! It does have a bit of a gingerbread quality, so the kitchen smelled like Christmas when I was baking. What a present- these bars were so good, I didn't even get around to rolling them in sugar, they were all eaten too quickly! :)
