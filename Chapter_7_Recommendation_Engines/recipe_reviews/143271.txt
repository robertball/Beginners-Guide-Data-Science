I like this recipe, especially when you live in a tropical place and have mangoes growing out your ears and need to find things to do with them.  The bread was decent but not quite worthy of five stars in my opinion.  I have only been able to make it one time so we will see what happens next time

I loved it. I ended up using Splenda sugar, and 6oz of fat free raspberry yogurt, and 1/3c olive oil, since it's what I had. It isn't a very sweet bread (a good thing) and a dab of olive oil butter makes it to die for. Thank you thank you and thank you again!

It was simply superb. I used a rice cooker and cooked it for 45 minutes. It came out absolutely soft and fluffy. It was a joy making it . Thanks for making my day.
