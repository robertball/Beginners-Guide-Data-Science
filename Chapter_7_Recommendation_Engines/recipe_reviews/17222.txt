Very good recipe with an East Indian flavor.  It is relatively quick to make, quicker than the recipe actually says, as some of the prep can go on while other things are cooking.  You can also save time by sauteing the carrots along with the potatoes after the potatoes are almost done.  The potatoes really make the recipe good, as they blend into the gravy mixture, making it thick and hearty.  I highly recommend (though I think that 1 tablespoon of turmeric is sufficient).

I was worried about so much tumeric in the recipe.  It does have an East Indian flavour but not too over powering.  Everyone enjoyed it even my fussy teenage son.  I left out the potatoes  and added a few more carrots.

this was very good!  I added sweet potatoes and green bell pepper.  Next time I will add more carrots.  I simmered it on the stove for about an hour to get all the flavors to meld together.  served over jasmine rice.  will definitly make it again and maybe add some heat.

Quite tasty. Made it exactly as the recipe instructed, and have no regrets.

I made this recipe after finding it with the "ingredient search" because it fit with what I had on hand.  My husband generally turns his nose up at new recipes, but he raved about this one!  Even my 3 1/2 year-old daughter loved it!  The carmelized carrots are worth the effort.  I also reduced the tumeric to 1 T.  The only change I may make next time is to increase the amount of potatoes and carrots that I use.

I have found many wonderful recipes on this site but this is not one of them.  The turmeric created a "bitter" taste that resembled garlic that had been burned. I would never make this again, it was not even worthy of one star.

Delicious! I made some adjustments: diced tomatoes instead of paste, no potatoes, and 1/2 chicken broth rather than water. The flavor was amazing, and it was fairly easy to make, with some organization.   My only complaint is that it needed a lot of salt as it simmered - but that may have been because I didn't use the tomato paste? No matter, I will definitely make this again!
