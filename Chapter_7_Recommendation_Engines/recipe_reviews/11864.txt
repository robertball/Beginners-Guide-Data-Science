I added several items because as written looks a little bland. I added a couple of cloves of garlic, 2 stalks of finely diced celery, and 1/2 of a small onion, also finely diced. I also added about 1/2 tsp. of thyme, and about 1/2 bag of frozen mixed vegetables. I increased the cooking time to about 45-50 minutes, so that the added vegetables would get cooked. The last thing I changed was I added about 3/4 can of milk to the soup mixture to give it a little moisture so it wouldn't dry out. Am giving it 5 stars based on these adjustments. Tasted great and will make many more times.

I used to write review's for a living. When writing a review you write it for the recipe "as is", not doctored up. without adding many extra flavor enhancers, this recipe is bland and boring. Tell it like it is people, you’re not rating "your" version, you should be rating the one as written.

This was incredible! I couldn't help but tweak it a little since there was such great opportunity for flavor enhancement. I sprinkled the chicken w/ kosher salt & fresh grnd pepper and spinach & herb seasoning that I get from Tastefully Simple...but you could use any herbs you like. Then I browned it over fairly high heat in butter and olive oil, removed the chicken and set aside. Added about 1/2 cup chicken broth to the pan and scraped up all those yummy bits, then added the chicken back to the pan and covered & cooked till done. Remove chicken and reduce broth by half (1/4 cup). I cooked the noodles in water and the remaining chicken broth from the can, drained & added the cut chicken to the noodles. Mixed cr. of chicken w/ herbs soup & mush soup w/ sour cream & added the reduction. Mixed that w/ a little more herb seasoning. Added chicken & noodles & combined well. Topped w/ shredded chedder and cracker crumb mixture. WOW! My husband ate 3/4 of the casserole and my children LOVED it! A definate add to the rotation! Thanks!

Ok, there are so many good reviews on this, but everyone is adding to it or changing the recipe.  I made it as is, thought it was kind of bland, so did the rest of my family. Also, 4 chicken breasts seems like a lot for a fairly small casserole? Sorry, just wasn't worth all the work to get it in the oven.  Everyone needs to make the recipes as is and rate them that way.

This casserole is wonderful!  The only thing different I did was add a little chopped broccoli.  Definately a keeper...

This is a new favorite for us! It is easy to throw together on a weeknight, and it's a hit with everyone in my family, including my picky pre-teen. I have made this both the "fattening" way, and using the lower-fat soups & sour cream, and either way it comes out delicious. (My husband actually preferred the flavor of the lower-fat version!) The only thing I usually add is a small can or two of mushrooms, or maybe some peas. I have also substituted regular bread-crumbs for the topping with good results.

Awesome Recipe!  A few alterations I made:  I addded 1/2 pkg Mixed Veggie (frozen) and 1/2 bag frozen broccoli and 1/2 bag of frozen Onions & Bell Peppers (seasoned Blend) that I cooked along with the pasta.  btw-I also put minced dry garlic, Italian Seanings,and Garlic-Salt-Pepper in the water when I boiled the chicken and then used that same water to cook the veggies and pasta.  I didn't measure it, just dumped some in the water to taste. It worked out very well!  BUT THE BEST ITEM--I had no ritz crackers, but I did have one package of the Parmesan Crusted Shake N Bake and a little over one cup of plain breadcrumbs that I mixed together and used instead of the crackers and butter.  It was incredible!!!  That Shake and Bake/Bread Crumb mixture gave it a little extra oomph...

Yummy! Even better the next day. I read the reviews here and made some modifications: sauteed diced carrots and celery with the onions, added a whole large can of mushrooms, cut the butter to 1/2 and increased the cracker crumbs to 1 1/2 cups. I cooked it in my pampered chef lasagna pan.

I have made this recipe twice.  I add some sauteed onions and garlic powder and use about 12oz of egg noodles.  This is a very flavorful casserole and the leftovers are yummy too!  This will be a terrific meal to take in frozen form for a new mom, etc. Great family food!

I made these modifications. Stewed some bone in chicken breasts with celery (with leaves) carrots, bay leaves, rosemary, thyme, sage, parsley. Used same broth for noodles. Did not add salt as cream soups already ahve a ton of salt. Seasoned the dish with rosemary, thyme. Used stewed carrots and celery, added peas, 1/2 c sharp cheddar cheese aND 2 cans c of mushroom soup as I had no chicken soup. Family devoured it. Much easier than making chicken and dumplings or other chicken and noodles, I prepared it 12 hours ahead and it was not soggy.

This was very creamy and good!  Because my BF doesn't like 'shrooms, I left out the mushroom soup and used 2 cans cream of chicken.  To save some fat and calories, I used FF sour cream and sprinkled seasoned bread crumbs on top instead of the crackers and butter.  But I think it would be fine without any sort of topping.  The casserole definitely needs a veg added though.  My BF said it tasted similar to chicken alfredo and suggested adding broccoli next time, which I think is a great idea!

People who moan that the recipe is too bland...all you need to do is look at the ingredients before you make it!  If you need food that has strong flavor why would you make this?  For those who are able to eat milder tasting food, this is perfect as is.  It's not fair to rate a recipe a low rating if you don't like the ingredients in it to start with!  It's like hating spicy food but giving a recipe a low rating because it has spice.

Good comfort food, but rather bland as written.  However, this appealed to my son, who loves noodles in any form.  The beauty of this recipe is it's a great base to personalize to your own family's tastes.  BONUS: It's a great dish for freezing.  Thank you Dawne for the submission.

Wow!  This is a delicious recipe! Big hit with the husband!  We ended up having it 3 weeks in a row! The only modifications I made; 3 chicken breasts instead of 4 (that's how many I had), extra noodles 7-8 oz. to make up for the chicken, some garlic powder, and I soaked some minced onion and added them along with some chopped carrots, and extra crackers.  The extra noodles and onions are great! You could add almost any veggies to this...can't mess it up! Yum!

How funny that people complain about reviewers noting the adjustments they made.  Very informative, that.  Useful!  Especially for novice cooks like me who don't want to figure out how to turn a supposedly bland recipe into something tastier.  Lighten up people.  There are no rules!  Delicious dish.  Thank you, all.

The calorie and fat content of this recipe was pretty high, and the nutritional value a bit low, so I made a few changes to make it more healthful: Substituted 98% fat free soups Used light sour cream instead of regular Substituted 6 oz Whole Wheat Penne pasta for the egg noodles Added 1/2 c steamed, chopped broccoli Reduced the butter for the topping to 1/3 c.  To add a little more flavor, I added 1/2 tsp celery seed and threw a fresh bay leaf in with the chicken while it was cooking (removed later).  Yummy.  Will make it again!

Yum!  I was happily surprised with this meal!  I made it as stated, but I added some broccoli  and mushrooms to the noodles while boiling for about 3 minutes.  Yummmmm!!   Also, my husband doesn't like crumb topping, so I threw some french-fried onions on top.  So good!

If you prepared the version and added NOTHING extra it would be xtremely BLAND.  I added my own touches and it was delicious.  This is a great GO 2 recipe for a casserole.  Then you can docter it to your own taste.  I added a small amount of fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms.  I used fat free sourcream.  Instead of cream of mushroom I used cream of CELERY.  I added Emerils chicken rub spice - 2 tablespoons, 1 teaspoon cayenne, 1/5 teaspoon garlic powder and a small amount of onion flakes. And i did NOT feel the need to pput melted butter on top (come on people, we want a full stomach, not a fat a**.)  And the crackers on top, topped with some sprinkled asiago/romano cheese mix.  Will make again.  MY version.

This is an excellent base meal which can be tweaked to your preferences, or is good as is.  I prefer my casseroles to have a bit more flavor intrigue so I tweaked in the following manner:

I rubbed the chicken breasts with paprika, dill and seasoned salt then browned over high heat before removing from pan and setting aside.  

I sauteed a large Vidalia onion, chopped fine in butter with 4 cloves of garlic, diced and 1 cup of red, yellow and orange sweet peppers.  I returned the chicken to the pan and added 1/3 cup chicken broth and 1/3 cup white wine and a can of sliced carrots, drained.   I poached the chicken and veggies until done.  After removing the chicken from the pan I reduced the remaining liquid by about half.

After mixing everything together I added 1/4 cup milk to the mixture as well as 1 cup shredded italian cheese (parm, romano, mozz) and doubled the noodles to make a full 9x13 casserole dish full.

My husband has never willingly eaten a casserole in 17 years of marriage and he not only had seconds of this dish, he has asked for it several times since.  This is definitely a keeper.

I made some changes and it was fantastic. Added extra sour cream, cream cheese, mixed frozen veggies and 1/2 cup milk along with extra herbs and spices. Topped with Italian seasoning bread crumbs and butter and cheddar cheese. Cooked for 45 min and it was perfect WOW!

Excellent! Boiled the chicken and noodles with chicken broth instead of just plain water. Added a quarter of an onion (chopped) and seasonings when boiling chicken. Added poultry seasoning and garlic powder (along with the pepper and salt) to cream of soup mix. Mixed in a bag of frozen mixed veggies (corn, green beans, chopped carrots), and a couple of garlic cloves to mixture, also put in a small can of sliced mushrooms & stems. In addition to the buttered Ritz crackers, I added some Parmesan cheese to the topping along with some extra shredded cheese blend that I had in the fridge. This gave it a wonderful cheesy flavor. The whole house loved it. I was surprised to see the kids wanting more. They said it is one of their favorites now and wants me to make it all the time now. With my additions to recipe, I'll give it 5 stars. perfect comfort food.

If you want to make this a little more healthy, because can condensed mushroom and cream of chicken is not good for you. You can add two cups of plain yogurt along with sautee some mushrooms...its very good and better for you.

Oh No - out of Cream of mushroom soup so I used Cream of Chicken and Cream of Broccoli (which stinks in the can - but smelled wonderful when it came out of the oven), a can of mushrooms and half a bag of frozen veggies.  Since I forgot to thaw out the chicken - duh... I used two cans of canned chicken breast from Costco!  Cooked the whole wheat penne in vegetable broth.  Wow!  Easy peasy - and fantabulous!  1/4 cup butter was enough for the crackers on top and I added 1 tbsp or so of Parmesan cheese to the butter mix.  Ohhhh laa laa - so good and I'm glad I found something to put that darn canned chicken in besides sandwiches!  Dawne - this was the best chicken noodle casserole I have ever made with or without any modifications!!!  Btw - the reason I love to read the reviews is because I get ideas to switch things up if I'm out of an ingredient!   LOVED YOUR RECIPE!!!  Loved the reviews!  Thanks to all of you for putting your modifications as a side note!

A little bland, but that can be easily doctored to make it more flavorful. I refuse to poach chicken...I don't care for it, so I cooked the chicken in foil in the oven, seasoned with lemon slices, lemon pepper, dill and garlic. I used reduced fat soups and fat free sour cream and omitted the butter, just adding crushed crackers on top. I also used no yolks egg noodles. This is for my mother-in-law, who is undergoing chemo, so it will be easy for her to heat up and not too spicy for her upset stomach. I think it's exactly right.

Made a few changes, and it turned out great!  Here's what I did: Used 1.5 lb chicken, 1 bag egg noodles, and a 1 lb bag frozen broccoli.  Cooked all 3, mixed together and seasoned it well with garlic salt, pepper, onion powder and a little red pepper flakes.  Used reduced fat soups and sour cream.  Topped it with Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Stuffing.  The end result was fantastic, and it was so easy.  This is a versatile recipe that could be changed with whatever you have on hand.  Definitely going into the dinner rotation, thanks for the recipe!

Not bad, but its missing something.  I did add alittle time & garlic, but it needs more seasonings.  I think next time I'll think down the sauce maybe 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 milk.  I also put broccoli in to get some veggies in the mix. Otherwise, not a bad start. I think I might try to work with it alittle more.

B+. A good recipe that needs some tweaks:
1. heat olive oil with garlic, pan fry slightly the chicken. Add some chicken or veg broth (a few tbs) to steam chicken till cooked. 2. Follow instructions of original recipe and combined ripped up pieces of cooked chicken to sauce. I used low fat chicken and low fat mushroom soup- worked and tasted fine 3. Add onion powder to mixture 4. Instead of ritz like crackers and butter- which adds just MORE calories than needed, top with panko (japanese) bread crumbs. Panko is now readily available in any grocery store. 5. Add salt/papper and some cayenne pepper- sprinkle lightly on to taste for a slight kick 6. cook at 375 degrees for 25 mins then turn broiler on a broil panko crumbs till brown and then enjoy! :)

This was very good and truly a comfort food.  I followed the directions to a "T".  My son and husband both scarfed this down with no complaints.  The cracker topping was what really made this special -I could have eaten all of the topping no problem.

I altered this some but it was delicious! It was just me and a little one, so I used leftover rotisserie chicken, one can cream of chicken, 1/2 cup sour cream, flavored it with pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder, and mixed in some frozen broccoli, with about half a bag of egg noodles. I really like the cracker topping and look forward to making this again.

I made this for my family and it was a big hit!  They were all begging me to make it again!  I am defiantly printing this recipe out to add  to my recipe book. We love garlic & seasonings, so I added 2 minced cloves and a little extra seasoning.

Good base but needed some work. I added some personal touches that made it a whole lot tastier. If I hadn't, I think it would have been quite bland. Other reviewers were right in that the recipe's sauce needed to be thinned out, it was too thick as is. The proportion of chicken to noodles was perfect. The crushed crackers on top was the best part. This made more than enough for dinner tonight and three "warm-up" lunches for tomorrow.

good, but as other reviews noted - sort of bland. Definitely needs some sort of vegetable added, I thought string beans would be good and perhaps topping it with French's french fried onions would be better!

This was a great base recipe and the beauty of it is that you can throw in whatever you want to add to it.  1) I cut the raw chicken into chunks and sauteed with onions and garlic 2) Added a bag of steamer veggies (carrots and peas) 3) Added shredded mont. jack cheese to the mixture 4) Added garlic, onion powder, and thyme - to taste 5) I also used an entire package of egg noodles 6) Added some milk for moisture. Although this tastes great fresh, it's even better left over!

This was great! But I did make some alterations reccomended by others. I added a can of mushroom pieces, 1/2 medium onion, 2 cloves of garlic, 1/4 tsp. of thyme and about 1/3 cup of milk. I used a small jar of home canned chicken (about 2 breasts) , 1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper and about 1 1/2 cups of ritz crackers (1 sleeve). I doubled the noodles (used a 12 ounce package) and baked it in a 9X13 pan and that worked great!

Easy & delicious.  I've made this a half a dozen times now and my family loves it.  I have used crackers, breadcrumbs & crushed potato chips as toppings and the crackers are our favorite still.  I also add a little onion powder & a handful of shredded cheese for a bit more flaver.

Very plain--I used cream of celery rather than creamof chicken, added fresh broccoli, and cooked chicken in lots of fresh herbs, but it was boring--did add 3/4 c milk--do that again, but add more seasoning and more ingredients.

Had some chicken in the freezer I intended to use to make some Indian food, but I needed something I could cook for my spice adverse parents, so I opted for this. They raved about it. I liked it. I made it as is, except I used three chicken breasts instead of four, because as I was mixing everything together, I decided three looked like enough, so I set the fourth aside for something else. I disagree with those who say the recipe is "bland" as is or that you don't need to add salt because the canned soup is salty enough. When you add bland to seasoned, you don't get seasoned, you get bland. The chicken needs seasoning besides what is in the soup. There are a ton of ways you could customize to your liking. I think if I make it again I might add some fresh mushrooms, but I found it to be quite tasty as written. It tasted like I expect this kind of casserole to taste. The chicken was moist and tender and the casserole was nice and creamy and the crackers added a nice texture and flavor.  If you are expecting something sophisticated, complex or healthy, I'd suggest you make some other recipe. If you want something easy, filling and tasty, this hits the spot. Also a good choice for people like my parents who are not adventurous eaters and tend to complain that most things I make are "too spicy."

Really good dish, with the original cooks recipe. I like to always prepare the dish with it's original ingredients to rate & review the recipe on it's own merits first. I think then & only then the readers get an honest idea if they'd like to give it a try. Very rich and creamy consistency, plenty moist with a great full body for plating. The egg noodles are a perfect fit when combining & blending both the sauce and pasta into the casserole, I liked the dish a lot and plan on making it again only to try a few different ideas ... thanks for sharing, sincerely Vinjovee

I just want to say that I disagree with the people who said you have to rate the recipe "as is" and not with the changes you made to it. I rely on and LIVE for the comments on how people changed the recipe to make it better. In fact, I have almost never made a meal from this site without using some of the tips in the reviews. So, please, all you reviewers stay creative and keep on reviewing! And thank you from someone who couldn't cook to save her life without this site.

Amazing recipe!  Made it for a friend in need of some comfort food.  He does not like mushrooms so I substituted the cream of mushroom with cream of broccoli and added a package of frozen broccoli as well.  I used reduced fat soups as well as sour cream and healthy choice noodles and the flavor was great!  The best part was the cracker topping!!!!  I am definately adding this to my specialties.

Made this for me and my husband. It is absolutely delicious. Some additions: 1 carrot (thinly sliced - so they get tender fast), 8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms, 1/4 cup of frozen peas (thawed), 1 clove of garlic (grated - I always grate my garlic so there are no big pieces of it which my husband hates), 1/2 onion (diced). Sautee all those in about 3 tbs. of olive oil just until they are a little tender. And I also added about 1/4 tsp. of thyme in the soup mixture. A splash of milk (about 1/4 cup. I only used 1 big piece of chicken breast. Will make it with tuna next time for a change. It's a keeper. Thank you Dawne!

Wow--easy peasy for this Sunday afternoon!  I had cream of celery and mushroom, and that worked fine. I  think it is basically 2 cans of cream of anything will work.  I would have put in mushrooms, but the kids don't like them.  Next time, I'll add peas, but it was fine just like it is!

I did use Amish egg noodles which have a heavier, thicker, heartier consistency.  I also added some chicken bouillon granules.  Excellent "starting point" recipe.  The options are endless!

It was very good- creamy. I added some frozen veggies and some white onion, I also added a little garlic powder and pepper. I didn't realize I didnt have enough sour cream- so I put some in, and put shredded montrey jack and chedder cheese to make up the difference. Next time Ill make sure I have enough sour cream tho! =)

I've made this recipe several times, and every time I make it I do it a little different.  I've made it exactly as written, and I've tried some of the suggestions from other reviews such as adding vegetables, onion, garlic, and various seasonings.  No matter what I do, it always turns out great!  I usually use low fat soups and sour cream, and it doesn't change the taste at all.  The last couple of times I've made it I've crumbled the crackers on top without the butter... it only cuts back on flavor a little bit and it cuts back on a lot of fat.

I only gave it 3 stars cause I thought it was very bland, my husband however is a very picky eater and he loved it. I think you need to use way more egg noodles. I would recommend using at least 10 ounces.

Two days before pay day and Mother Hubbard's cupboards were bare....except for two chicken breasts, a carton of chicken broth, 1/2 a bag of egg noodles, one can of cream of chix, one can of cream of celery, 1/2 a container of sour cream, a bag of frozen broccoli and a bag of grated cheddar. And it was yummy.  Husband raved and it made a ton.  I seasoned the chix and boiled in chix broth with a little onion and celery, when chix was done I boiled noodles in the same broth and when noodles were done I boiled the broccoli for a few minutes. (yes, I know...I should have done the last two together) Mixed it all together with lots of cheese, skipped the crackers and served with biscuits.  Very fast, easy, and filling.

I read other reviews and decided to add some garlic powder and pepper, but not salt as the condensed soups are high in sodium already.  I also added a 1/2 cup of milk to the soup/sour cream mixture and used a whole bag of cooked egg noodles.  One other addition was 1/2 of a red bell pepper sauted in a little oil (for color).  It was delicious!!  I am so happy to have another recipe to add to my rotation!  Will definitely make again (and again)!!

This is mmmmmmmmm good.  To make it a little bit more health friendly I used the reduced fat soups, added sauteed onion, carrot and celery, only used 1/4 cup of sour cream and did not put the topping on it.  It was fabulous.  My favorite food is Chicken Noodle Soup, but my husband doesn't like eating soups for dinner, so this is a great alternative - he loved it.

I am so tired of seeing a 4 or 5 star recipe only to find out that most everyone added spices and other ingredients and then rated the finished dish the way they fixed it up. Please only rate the recipe as written. There should be a special place to post the "altered" recipe. This was very bland and like a recipe off of a can of soup.

The reason I love allrecipes com is for all the different recipes I've been able to find here. The search function has been awesome. But above all the biggest plus to this site is the feedback.  This chicken noodle casserole is very basic but good but without the feedback and suggested improvements it would never be great. Even complicated more detailed recipes can be improved for individual tastes. So for those who insist on telling us to rate only the recipes as is, go write a cookbook. Thank you all for feedback that offer improvements and changes, it gives us all a chance to trial and error any and all recipes here on Allrecipes. Keep it up.

My family and I thought this was great. YES, I made very minor changes based on our tastes, other reviews, and what I had on hand. To me, that's the sign of a great recipe - customizable and still wonderful. I halved the recipe using 1 can of cream of chicken mushroom soup, added a little garlic pepper, no salt, used bow-tie pasta, subbed in plain greek yogurt for 1/2 of the sour cream, added a splash of skim milk and a couple of tblsp of chicken gravy to the sauce. Next time I would double the amount of crackers in the topping (but not the butter). I love to read BOTH types of reviews - those who made the recipe as written and those who tweaked. Then, I trust MY judgment to prepare. Thanks to everybody who takes the time to review and post their experiences - speaking for myself, it's very much appreciated.

Family enjoyed this.  I put my usual spin on things.  Adding onion, carrots, and celery finely diced and sauteed in butter and olive oil.  This recipe is a good base to build to your individual taste.

Wow!  This was delicious!  I added 3 stalks of celery & a touch of onion (finely diced) and some frozen peas.  To save time, I diced the chicken before poaching it.  It was wonderful and went great with a salad.  I'm glad I scaled it up, everyone took seconds!  Thanks Dawne!

I added a bit more pasta and to compensate, I included a can of cream of celery.  I also added a can of corn.  Sister loved it although I thought it was missing something (not that I know what that is). She has requested that I make it again.

Comfort food at it's best! I took this to a church potluck and received at least five compliments on it so I would consider it a success. I took other's advice and boiled celery leaves with the chicken for more flavor. I also added onion, celery and carrots to the noodles while boiling them to make this a one pot meal and to add more flavor. Because I added more filling, I mixed some milk with the soups to ensure it wouldn't be dry after cooking. I bet using the broth left over after boiling the noodles would be just as tasty. I didn't see any reason to add any more calories to this recipe so I crushed th Ritz crackers on top of the casserole then sprayed them with butter flavored cooking spray instead of mixing with a whole stick of butter! Great recipe, we will enjoy this one again.

Sorry, this was not something I would make again. It was too creamy, I felt like I was eating straight cream cheese. Although I added veggies and cheese, it was still bland. I wish this could have worked out for our family.

I tend to disagree with reviewers who give a recipe a lower rating because it is "bland". My thought is that the ingredient list pretty much makes that evident and if you like spicy food, don't pick a mild flavored recipe, or make allowance for your tastes when rating. In the case of this casserole, the flavor is fine but I think it needs some color. Sauteed mushroom, peas, red bell pepper, maybe broccoli, anything to relieve the whiteness. That would also make it a more complete meal in a dish. I stirred a little parmesan into the soup mixture since I had some on hand and put some shredded cheddar under the cracker crumbs. A comforting meal but DH didn't agree, he said it was too much like tuna noodle casserole.

This is a great recipe!  What I like about it is the ability to add ingredients to suit your own taste.  I made this for my Bunco group using cream of celery & cream of chicken soup with about teaspoon of thyme.  I added white wine and chicken broth to increase the liquid.  I also had heavy cream on hand and added a little of that.  Sauteed a medium diced onion, 2 diced celery stalks and about a cup+ of shredded carrot.  I also added cooked broccoli florets and baked it covered to prevent it from drying out.  Maybe next time I'll try it with mushroom for a different flavor.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Only changes made were to add poultry seasoning, onion & garlic powder to poaching water, then added canned peas to the casserole before baking. Because of this dish's mild, but yummy flavor, it's perfect for picky kids and potlucks. Will definitely make this again!

Good recipie.  4 stars rated without alterations to ingredients.  I seasoned the chicken with garlic powers, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.  I also added a cup of shredded cheese over the top of the butter and bread crumbs.  So glad I did, the cheese gave some extra flavor :)  Will make again

I combined recipes I & II. Cooked the chicken in the water, then cooked the noodles, added 1 can cream of mushroom soup, then 1 can French Onion soup and 1 Cup sour cream. Added 1 12oz pkg of frozen peas & carrots, topped with crushed garlic & herb whole wheat crackers, then sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top. To me a recipe is just a suggestion. I make changes according to what I have on hand, so I don't have to run to the store at the last minute for one or two things. The ability to improvise is the sign of a good cook.

Definitely a recipe that needs to be tweaked to fully enjoy. And if you regard this as a base recipe, it can actually lead to a pretty satisfying dish. I know some people really enjoyed it as-is, but this is your opportunity to experiment with different seasonings. I added garlic and onion powder, some garlic salt, mushrooms, broccoli, and even a packet of ranch dressing mix to the soup and sour cream mixture. I used less of the cream of chicken soup, though -it seemed to take away from the rest of the flavor. I cooked the noodles and broccoli in chicken broth, but made sure to bake (not boil) the chicken in a poultry seasoning. But on a side note, DO NOT skimp on the Ritz topping. Double (even triple) it if you can. 

I will definitely be making this again, but with a greater assortment of vegetables.

Prepared exactly as written, it's very good, it's simple and I will make it again! Although I made it to recipe this time, I do try to limit salt & butter when cooking. Next time I’m going to cut the 1/2c of butter, and just use Ritz crumbs to top…I’m sure we’ll never miss the extra butter (the topping was VERY buttery)! I’m also going to try the "healthy request" soups to reduce the fat and sodium, and use a lite sour cream. I have 2 young daughters, so this was a simple recipe that they could help with in preparing dinner for the family!  Thanks for sharing!

I knew this would be good because I have other recipes that use the combination of cream soups and sour cream. My main change to the recipe was using 8 ounce of whole wheat noodles instead of 6 of egg noodles. Iserved brocolli on the side, but you could mix it in with the noodles and chicken. I just wish the nutritional information listed Phospours content.

This was great, left overs are even better. I used precooked chicken bites instead of poaching the chicken. If you want the chicken flavor when you cook the noodles, add a boullion cube to the water. I also added some chopped onion and garlic powder for flavor.

What a wonderful comfort casserole! I had bought an extra Rotisserie Chicken from the night before so I used that meat, it was seasoned with herbs and garlic and worked fantastic! Also, you can use any type of cream soup (like celery), I added mushroom and peas.  Also, I didn't use ANY butter, crumble the crackers on a few minutes before taking out of oven and it's perfect!  Saves A LOT of calories and fat doing this and still takes just as great............ENJOY!

The taste was good after I added various seasonings but I think the measurments are off. I ended up using 12oz of noodles because of the amount of sauce. Also, I used about triple the crackers. I also added some finely chopped onion.

This is a regular dinner at our house.  I made it for company one time and now it's a regular at their house too.  I made it as written except I double it (we're big eaters and we like the leftovers). Sometimes I'll use boneless chicken breasts like the recipe calls for and sometimes I'll cook a whole chicken in the crock-pot and use the meat.  A great recipe.

Not a huge hit, no one ate the leftovers.  Kind of blah. Needs something to give it some texture.

This recipe was wonderful.  My kids loved it and are still talking about it days later!  I sprinkled cheddar cheese over the top for the last five minutes of cooking.

This recipe was good, though I did add peas and diced carrots. I also added onion powder and garlic powder. The end product was very creamy and tasty.

this chicken casserole would have been just ok if I hadn't made the modifications that I had.  I baked my chicken breasts in italian dressing instead of poaching them.  I mixed my whole grain rigatoni noodles with the sour cream, cream of chicken, cream of mushroom and added garlic salt and dried herbs such as thyme and rosemary to the casserole.  Then I layered my casserole.  Noodle mix, chicken, asiago and cheddar cheeses, then noodle mix, chicken, asiago and cheddar cheeses and then I crumbled Townhouse buttery crackers on top and drizzled the remainder of the cooked Italian dressing from the chicken on top of the crackers.  The italian dressing really made the casserole.  I won't make it without!

I made this last night for dinner. I followed the advise of some reviewers and added things. When I added peas and carrots, celery, and onions, I realized this is just like my tuna noodle casserole, except you use chicken instead of tuna. I never use cream of mushroom soup because I don't like it. I can almost always sub cream of chicken or cream of celery to a recipe that calls for cream of mushroom soup. I added garlic and onion powder, about 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary, and a splash of Worcestshire sauce. If it is too dry, I add more sour cream or another can of soup.  Katherine

I was feeling more crunchy and cheesy goodness when I started making this SO ... I added about 1/2 cup more crackers, 1/4 cup fried onions and 1 cup of whatever cheese we had on hand.  OH, and 1/4 cup diced onion that I sauteed.  Can't wait to make it again!

My husband gave this an A++!  Thanks for such a cozy recipe!  After reading the reviews I did add seasonings, sauteed onions, and a bag of frozen peas and/or carrots to give it a boost.  I added a bay leaf to the cooking water (not sure if this really does anything or not), and sprinkled poultry seasoning on the cooked chicken.  To the soup mixture I added onion powder and garlic powder.  Long story short, this is a new cold weather, tension-easing favorite for us.  =)

This recipe was very good.  I substituted fat free soups and fat free sour cream.  I used reduced fat club crackers and smart balance instead of butter.  It cut a lot of fat and didn't change the flavor.  My kids liked it too.  We will definitely make this again.

Drew gave this a four, but the kids gave it a five, so I'm letting them have their say. (I thought it was a five too) The only things I added was a head of stir fryed broccoli, my usual; onion and garlic powders AND about a heaping tablespoon of mayo along with a bit of skim milk only because it seemed a little dry. Overall Dawne, a super recipe that we all loved!!!!

Was going to make this casserole for my grown daughter and her family, but couldn't wait to try it - so made it for my husband and I.  He ate seconds (which is his way of saying "it is a Keeper"!!! And I had leftovers for lunch a couple of days through the following week.  It was GREAT!!!  Thought it would be dry when I used 8 ounces of noodles (instead of 6 oz.), but it was JUST Right.  The sour cream does give it an added flavor.  Will make it for the rest of my family soon.  P.S. This is a great dish to send to a family when help of food is needed, such as after a family funeral, sickness, etc.

I didn't have any fresh/frozen chicken breast but I had a few large cans of cooked chicken from BJs. I used two cans, drained and rinsed, of that chicken. I cooked the noodles in one can of chicken broth with water- enough to boil in. I also followed the suggestion of adding onion. I didn't measure, but also added onion and garlic powder, and a few sprinkles of paprika. This was a great dish that even my daughter (6 y/o picky eater) ate. Will make again for sure!

I tried this as-is and did not like it, I found it very bland but followed the recipe to the letter. Today I made this again using my homemade ingredients and changed the cream of mushroom soup to cream of asparagus, italian seasoned breadcrumbs, and no sour cream... every person has different tastes and different likes this was my take on it, a great base recipe for the one that like to experiment

This is a very rich and basic casserole comfort food. My kids loved it and I would make it again. I did make some adjustments though.  As a child of the 70's and daughter of a terrible cook, when I see canned cream soup as a recipe ingredient, I simply cannot go there. Instead I made the bechamel sauce from Chicken Pot Pie IX on this web site, reducing the butter by a few tablespoons since more butter comes in here for the topping.  I also added frozen peas and chopped carrots to the chicken cooking step. Finally, the recipe calls for 6 oz of noodles, and rather than store  2 oz of noodles I recklessly used the whole 8 oz package, and there was plenty of sauce. If you go the canned soup route that may not be the case. The next time I make this I'll add a little thyme and oregano. Very tasty!

This is a great basic recipe. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, added a little poultry seasoning, garlic and onion powder. I didn't have any crackers so I used bread crumbs instead. So yummy!

This is a great recipe that can be tailored to everyone's tastes, I love that! My husband has a smoker so I used smoked chicken, added some broccoli, left off the topping and when it was almost done I topped it with some shredded cheddar cheese. Thank you Dawne for great recipe that can be made a little different every time!

Great recipe!!  I added 1/2 of a chopped onion and a very heavy-handed sprinkling of garlic pepper as I folded the soup/sour cream mixture into the noodles, otherwise I prepared as written.  Amazing!  This recipe will be in my regular rotation!!

very good basic foundation recipe to build upon or make it how you like it.  omitted the sour cream and cracker crumbs, added sauteed celery, green pepper, and onion.  would have given it 5 stars, but since i didn't make it as written, couldn't really judge the recipe fairly. used cream of chicken soup and cream of broccoli soup. *****very important! if you have the time, bake chicken legs  and thighs (simply rinsed and unseasoned) with skin on at 425* 1 hour, on a grill or rack to drain all the fat off, turning the legs after 30 minutes to continue cooking on the other side. let the legs completely cool then take meat off the bone.  The skin crisps up so nicely it just flavors the juicy chicken  unbelievably, even without salt and seasonings, trust me!  It is better not to salt the meat because the soups are salty enough anyway. the skin comes off easily, too, when you are taking the meat off the bone.  This is Chef Alton Brown's method of crispy roasted chicken legs or wings, and he is famous for a reason! Overall, very happy with this recipe and will make it again, for sure!

Super yummy!  I used Cream of Chicken with Herbs and that gave it a lot of flavor.  Kids loved it and asked for the leftovers in the lunch the next day.

We liked this recipe very much. I sautes a 1/2 cup of onions, 1/4 cup of celery and 1.5 cups of sliced mushrooms in 1 tbsp of butter and 1 tbsp of oil and added into the mix. The Ritz crackers are great, but they are really soggy the next day. I think I will brown them seperately in the oven while the casserole bakes and sprinkle them on later.

This is an awesome recipe that the whole family loves.  I tweaked it a little with more seasonings and occasionally add veggies.  There are never leftovers of this dish!

This is definitely a staple in our house!  To add some flavor, we use rotisserie chicken and instead of crushed crackers, we use bread crumbs for the topping.  I also found that fried onions were a nice substitute for the bread crumbs.  LOVE this!

As written this recipe would be bland.  Though mine came out great--it's because I changed it as did many others.  I don't do the crackers on top, I add mozzarella cheese.  
I decrease the sour cream because it'll taste too sour otherwise.  What makes this tasty is making the chicken full of flavor.  Don't rely on the soups to do that for you.  
This is comfort food and I love it.

MY HUSBAND fell in love with this recipe!  Only thing I changed was use thighs instead of breasts (he doesn't like white meat)....the leftovers were out of this world.  This is a definite keeper!

This was an easy recipe to follow. I added a few different things otherwise I thought that it would be bland. 
When I poached the chicken I did it in two cups of chicken broth, 1 bay leaf, two tsp of onion power, 1 tsp on garlic salt, and 1 tsp of italian seasoning. 

When baking I added a half bag of frozen peas. and a little bit more noodles than the recipe calls for.

Next time I will add onions, and another can of soup and with all the chicken it was a little bit dry. 

I'll also leave off the buttery crackers, who really needs a half a of butter!

I have to say this reminded my husband of chicken pot pie. He really liked it.

Also, yummy with Old Bay seasoning... I'm from Maryland!

This was a really great base recipe for me. I had all the ingredients already on hand. I wound up using frozen chicken cubes because that was all I had but no big deal. I also added garlic salt & onion salt to the soup and sour cream mixture. I added diced onions, carrots, and celery as well, with a little bit of milk to loosen it up. I used spaghetti noodles in place of egg noodles. Instead of crackers on top I used a mixture of parmesan cheese and italian flavored bread crumbs. This is a really good recipe to add your own flare to, and its super super easy!

I sauteed 1/2 chopped onion, 2 stalks chopped celery, 1 tsp chopped garlic in butter, and sprinkled liberally (1/2-3/4 tsp?) poultry seasoning and 1/4 tsp celery salt.  Only other change was to add about 1/4 Cup milk to soup/sour cream mixture and used rotisserie chicken. Hubby loved it and so did I!

SOOOOO surprisingly GOOD!!!! I used 3 large chicken breasts, cut them up raw, and cooked in a skillet with some sweet onion. Before adding to the noodles I sprinkled with some salt, and generously with onion and garlic powder. I used Italian bread crumbs as opposed to crackers because that was all I had and I'm happy because it turned out perfect! So creamy, so full of flavor, we all loved it! Thanks so much!!

This was a good meal.  I added some zucchini to get some vegetables in it.  I think in the future I will add some broccoli, too.  I also used homemade egg noodles.  It took a while to make because of this, but definitely a special treat!

This is a dish i make over and over. But i do spice it up a notch. 
I always put in some Salt, Pepper and Onion powder and use Garlic flavored Cream of mushrooms instead of the plain.

I have made this a couple times, and it's been a hit each time.  The last time I made it was a few months ago, and I had to come look up the recipe again because I've gotten several requests from the family to make it again.  This one is tasty and easy to make.

Very good recipe that can be played with to suit anyone's taste.  I did add about a cup of sharp cheddar, a cup of milk and powdered garlic, onion, salt & pepper.  It was delicious and both me & the hubby went for seconds.  My only "complaint" would be that it was rather dry the next day, but since noodles were involved, that is to be expected.  They do suck the moisture out of any recipe.  We would definitely have this again.  Great comfort food!

This recipe turned out really good!  I didn't have butter crackers for the top so instead I used Cheese & Garlic croutons.  I wasn't sure how it would work with the croutons, but it turned out fantastic!

We loved this recipe! Used reduced fat soups and ff sour cream to lower fat intake. In addition, used Best Life buttery spread instead of real butter and reduced fat crackers. Still tasted fabulous!

From reading other reviews I made this tonight using about 2 1/2 tablespoons of Sour Cream and some milk. I also added a layer of mozzarella cheese before baking, and had some extra on the table and it seemed to add a little kick. Next time I will be adding garlic and peas for some more flavour.

Great make ahead casserole.  The first time I made it per the recipe, using the Low Sodium/Low fat versions of the soups.  It was good, but a bit bland.  2nd time I made it, I cut back a little on the chicken (used about 1.5#), added a small can of mushrooms, and a Tbs of Tastefully Simple's Garlic Garlic seasoning.  That was just right.

Incredible....I will NEVER make Chicken Casserole any other way!  I used only 1/2 the chicken as written in the recipe and threw in some sauteed mushrooms and cheddar cheese.  Even better the next day!  Would give 10 stars if I could!

You might be able to cut back a little on the butter used for the crust.

Very good, all my kids enjoyed this.  I followed some advice of other reviewers and sauteed some onion and celery.  I also added some milk and garlic powder to the soup mixture.  I also broiled the casserole for the last few minutes to get a nice browned top.  Will make again!

Amazing recipe thank you. I only used one chicken breast and seasoned with salt, pepper, thyme, and italian seasoning. Used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1/2 cup of sour cream. 2.5 cups of wide egg noodles and 2 Tbsp. of small cut broccoli. But the topping I made was the best - I used 10 Ritz crackers, 8 croutons, 1/8 cup of chicken Stoved Top stuffing, and about 5 french onions all crushed up finely. Truly fabulous recipe! Even better the next day!

So good. I make sure I season the chicken so that it's not too bland. I also add frozen veg but I cooked it first (sauteed it with chicken).

What a quick and wonderful recipe that the entire family loved. I added minced garlic, chopped carrots and celery, and thyme. I used reduced-fat cream of celery soup, reduced-fat sour cream, and 1/2 c 2% milk. I sprinkled the top with a Shake-N-Bake type mixture since my children do not like cracker crumbs. Excellent!!

This went over really well.  I used a low fat cream of broccoli & cheese instead of mushroom because I hate mushrooms.  This is a keeper, and lots of low fat substitute options.

My family really enjoyed this but I did make alterations.  First, I used homemade egg noodles.  I also sauteed the chicken (diced) with onion.  I added garlic powder, seasoned salt and a little bit of cayenne.  I also mixed in a bag of mixed veggies with it and added cheddar jack underneath the cracker crumbs.  But it was a hit.

Liked but I did several changes. OK first I steamed fresh mushrooms and broccoli. Added it to the mixture. I used fresh basil too. I also used 2 cups of egg noodles. I then added 4 crushed garlic cloves to to cracker topping. All with some grated cheese on top. Mmm I will do this one again.

I make this often with canned chicken or tuna. It's much faster and tastes just as good. I recommend using the cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup (campbell's) as it gives the casserole much more flavor. I always add mixed veg to it too.

Big hit with my family!  Following another reviewers suggestion I browned the chicken cutlets first in butter and olive oil (after seasoning them with Tastefully Simple Spinach Herb seasoning) and I'm glad I did as it gave the chicken a little more flavor once in the casserole.  I also used panko bread crumbs on top of the casserole in the oven (b/c I didn't have any buttery crackers) combined with some shredded sharp cheddar as another reviewer suggested.  It was very good.  The reason I give it four stars instead of five is because as written there is no way this feeds 6 hungry people for dinner unless you serve quite a few sides with it! (or have small servings)  We are only four people and finished it in one sitting.  Plus I hate not having leftovers when I cook something like this!  I think next time I will use the whole bag of egg noodles and add a couple more chicken cutlets and another can of soup.  Then I'd be sure to have leftovers!  But this one DEFINITELY is a repeat for my family...they were still talking about it a couple days later when I tried another new chicken recipe, saying they liked this one better.

Made this dish for my family tonight...they loved it! I saute'd a chicken breast, and frozen mixed veggies in butter. I added chopped garlic & fresh basil to the mix. I used homestyle noodles, which taste like homemade noodles, and switched out the cream of mushroom soup for condensed cheddar cheese soup. I was out crackers, so I topped with french fried onions( I added these at the very end). I served with whole wheat biscuits (from this site). Made for a great weeknight meal. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  Creamy and crunchy!  I made the following alterations:  In lieu of sour cream, I added 4 ounces of cream cheese and a cup of chicken broth.  I topped it with a bag of croutons mixed with a cup of chicken broth and 4 tbsps. of melted butter.

Great comfort food, easy to make. I do boil my chicken breasts for two hours to make some chicken stock (with onions, and all the seasonings), and so that chicken is really tender in the casserole.

MUST TRY !! I added 2 Chicken Bullion cubes and a clove of garlic to the water, then cooked the chicken in it and followed the rest of the recipe.  FYI.. the 1 cup of crackers is equal to a sleeve of Ritz crackers and really makes the dish.. We Loved it!

I thought it was so bland, I followed the blanching of the chicken and it tasted terrible, chewy and with a weird taste.  I'm SO glad they were out of organic chicken when I went to the store so I didn't waste more money on this recipe.  I even added spices and more salt than I normally would and it was still bland.  Now I have a giant pan of food no one wants and we're all still hungry :(

I thought I would give this recipe a try since it looked very easy. I was very disappointed. It was very bland and there was too much meat. I recommend doubling the amount of noodles and adding seasoning.

Awesome & comforting! My boyfriend & I were looking for a quick but delicious meal & found this. It was so easy to make plus cheap & turned out great!! We did however make a few changes. Added 1 can of peas & chopped carrots & added it to the soup mixture. I suggest that rather than frozen veggies. Also we used way more than a cup of crackers but I'm sure you can add more or less to your own liking. The only negative thing I have to say is I wish we would of added milk to the soup because I would of liked it to be more creamy. I'd say 1/2 cup to a cup. Lastly I had never poached chicken before & it was so easy & delicious!! The chicken was so moist & juicy!! I'll definetly poach chicken more often! All around great recipe!!

I'll give this five stars, but only with modifications, because as-is, it is bland, bland, bland.  I season (salt, pepper, thyme, a little chili pepper, and grilling seasoning for chicken) and broil the chicken instead of poaching it.  Then, to the noddle/soup mixture, I add a dollop of Miracle Whip, about 1T finely minced garlic; one medium chopped, sauteed yellow onion; about 3/4C of sliced button mushrooms; and about 3/4C of sliced artichoke hearts.  My husband LOVES this casserole--he actually requests it every couple of weeks or so and takes the leftovers to work for his lunch.

I made a healthy version of this recipe for the first try and I also added several different fresh and canned veggies (as some other people suggested) and it was delicious! The casserole was huge because I did double the recipe but we went through it in just 2 days. I will definitely be keeping this one on had to make again. Super filling!

This got rave reviews from a family gathering. Even our picky eater ate it. We added some sauteed onions and celery and I cut down on the amount of butter for the topping because it seemed like a lot. Besides that and adding a bit of oregano and garlic powder, I did just as the recipe said and it was great. This has already been made twice and will be a favorite! Thank you.

My family ate this so quickly that I never got to sit down and eat a helping myself!  I did get a forkful when I checked to see if it was hot!!  I used cream of broccoli instead of cream of mushroom (not big mushroom lovers in my house).   Plus I added garlic powder to the butter that used with the crackers.  Was very good!

Very good!!  My kids loved it heated up the next day too!  Instead of the crackers on top, I used cubed stuffing and drizzled that with melted butter.  A keeper.

Very good! I did the following as others suggested: I boiled the chicken in chicken broth. Then removed chicken and boiled noodles, diced onion & frozen peas and carrots in the broth. I made this recipe to yield 9 servings and it filled up a 9x13 dish to the brim. It fed 6 adults (all of which had more than one helping) with leftovers to spare. In the cream mixture I added some celery salt, garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper too. I also put in about 2 TBSP of minced garlic in the mixture. I served this with a salad & Texas toast. Everyone in my family loved this recipe. Caught my mom eating it cold that night! Its great cold too as of course I had to have a few nibbles!

The Perfect Comfort Food!!  My husband even loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly except I added about 1/3 a packet of Lipton Savory Herb and Garlic to the soup mixture - and 1 clove of garlic.  This added a hint of flavor to the background of an already delicious dish.  Next time, I would use 2 cups instead of 1 cup of the topping - only because I loved the flavor of it and would have liked to tasted it more.  All in all this dish is wonderful and will be a repeat in my house - forever!!

This was a very Yummy dish. I kept to the original ingredients but did use seasoned chicken breasts and tried to save on calores by using low fat soups and instead of butter for the crackers I used olive oil. I did add garlic powder to the soup mix and cracker crumbs. Will be making this again.

Honestly, I thought I'd gone beyond cooking cream of anything soup type casseroles. 
I thought I was too good a cook for this. 
I was wrong.
This was really good. If all the "cream of something" soup casseroles were like this, they'd have a better reputation. 

I did add dried basil & garlic powder because the comments about it being bland worried me and, I was glad I did. 
I also melted the butter for the cracker topping in the microwave. I see no reason to get a pot dirty when you can melt the butter in less than a minute by nuking it.

This recipe was delicious and comforting.  I too, like other reviewers made some changes.  When poaching the chicken, I added poultry seasoning, a bay leaf, some garlic powder, salt, pepper, and some minced onion.  This made for some very flavorful noodles. I also substituted two chicken thighs for two of the breast for a guest who likes dark meat.  I used fat-free soup and sour cream.  For the topping I put some seasoned croutons in the processor along with parsley, grated parmesan cheese and half the butter recommended.  I will definately make this again and maybe add some vegetables next time.

In my opinion, this recipe has several pros and cons. CONS: a little bland "as is," so I threw in some extra seasonings (garlic/onion powder, curry, lemon juice) as well as a few sliced almonds. I also used panko on top instead of crushed crackers. Not surprisingly, it also makes a LOT of food which is better for a family of 4 or 6 than just my boyfriend and me! Finally, this dish must be so fattening considering everything that goes in it!! PROS: very easy to make. I actually shredded the chicken, which took some time, but everything else is wham-bam-done. Leftovers were also delicious. I'm assuming the recipe is also very flexible in that you could throw in any ingredients you choose. I think it would have gone perfectly with some steamed broccoli or green beans on the side. Delicious, rich and filling!

This casserole was very good - even my picky toddler ate it!  I did tweak it a bit...added some garlic herb Mrs. Dash for a little bit of extra flavor, added the 1/2 cup of milk recommended in the reviews, added about 1/2 package of chopped broccoli, and added some shredded cheese to the top.  All of my additions were really good - but it would have been fine (and probably better) without the cheese.  VERY creamy and good!

Very, very good.  I added some carrots (in with the pasta while it was cooking) and about a cup of frozen peas.  I don't like mushrooms, so I used 2 cans of cream of chicken.  I will definitely make this again - my kids gobbled it up!

This was really delish but I didn't think it warrants FIVE stars... I save that for really special recipes.  I have always made a similar dish, which is basically the same thing minus the sour cream and crackers.  This is truly a comfort food and the crackers and sour cream do add a little punch to the dish.  The leftovers are good too and no doubt will get all eaten up.

My family really enjoyed this casserole.  It reminds me a lot of my mom's tuna-noodle casserole, but nobody else in my family now will eat tuna, so this made us all happy!  The flavor and texture are very good.  I used less sour cream, and it turned out fine.  Crushed potato chips are good on top.

I used Campbell's Cream of Chicken with Herbs and also took a frozen box of broccoli with cheese sauce, microwaved it for 1/2 the time on the box just so it wasn't completely frozen and stirred that in with the chicken and noodles... very tasty!

This was good - my boyfriend LOVED it, but I  thought that the sour cream kinda overpowered the sauce.  Maybe I'll use less next time.  I used only 1/4 cup butter and it turned out fine.  On the other hand, it was fantastic the day after!!  I guess that's because it had time to congeal  :)  Thanks!

This dish has been a favorite of mine and my hubby's since we've been married.  It's simple and so, sooooo delicious!  I always use reduced fat sour cream, reduced fat soups, and reduced fat crackers and butter.  It's much better for you, and just as tasty!  Here are a few pointers I have done to improve the recipe. I add a small can of drained mushrooms. It just gives a little something extra to the casserole.  I also put a layer of cheese between the casserole and the cracker topping.  Lastly, I use extra crackers with the same amount of butter.  It makes the topping even crunchier, which I LOVE!  
This dish is yummy with black eyed peas and greens...I had cheesy veggies with mine.  It's a great meal to fix for company!:-)  Good luck!

Just made this recipe. My boyfriend really liked it. I added an extra half can of cream of mushroom soup, extra half can of cream of chicken soup and half cup light sour cream. I also used a rotisserie chicken to save time and added some frozen peas. Next time I think I will add a few more ingredients for more flavor like onions and cheese. I also ended up baking it for almost an hour.

I only added more seasonings such as onion powder, garlic pepper, and poultry seasoning.  I could tell by the list of ingredient that it would be a milder flavor.  For me this is not a big deal because sometimes I don't want a lot seasoning or I want to keep the cost down so I am not going to throw everything and the kitchen sink into a dish.  I know I will make it again using a number of suggestions that I read in the comments.  Thanks for sharing Dawne great job!

DISCLAIMER: I'm rating this as a base recipe to which additional ingredients can be included. I try my best to rate recipes on this site as they are stated but now and again this type of recipe comes across my radar and I recognize it as a good basic idea that I can add to for my particular tastes. That said, I chose to use 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of celery. I included some sauteed chopped celery and onion, dried sage and thyme and frozen baby peas. I didn't thaw the peas first, just stirred them into the rest of the mixture before baking. Additionally, I used leftover rotisserie chicken that I chopped into bite-sized pieces -- very flavorful!  This casserole is definitely right up there in the top 10 list of comfort food dishes! I highly recommend this recipe as a jumping off point. Add your favorite veggies & seasonings and make it your own!

This is very, very good. One of the tastiest recipes from several that I've used. I changed it a little. I sliced an onion into the chicken when I was poaching it. Also, I added a little smoked paprika to the soups when I blended them, as well as a bag of frozen peas and carrots. Great comfort food for a chilly autumn night

As written, this was bland. It's a good start base. For those newer cooks that need a recipe go with the most helpful positive review ( needs the extra ingredients to be good/great tasting ).

I have made this recipe with many different variations for years.  I would guess if one has been cooking for a few years, one has a recipe similar to this one.  I usually like to include veggies in my adaptations, depending on what I have available at the time.  And I ALWAYS use garlic.

I found it bland. Now, what is nice is; it is a great starting point. So, it has a good base. 

I ended up turning it into a chicken cordon blue casserole with added ham and swiss cheese. Also added celery, onion, and herbs.

I loved it. I only added some broccoli & carrots. I don't think it tasted bland as others have mentioned. I do however, don't cook with too much salt so I'm not to fond of anything really salty. Definitely a good base recipe to up or down as you please. Thank you for the recipe. Happy Baking Everyone! :)

Bland, bland, bland...even with the doctored up suggestions; garlic, chicken broth in the water, thyme, vegetables, onions, cheese on top with the cracker mixture (which was the best part of the dish).

We love this recipe. I forgot the sour cream one day, but it tasted fantastic so I don't add it now. Sometimes I add peas or mushrooms to the mix. Good meal with items I keep on hand.

After reading so many reviews before making this I decided to doctor it up to our taste. This recipe was a fantastic foundation & I am grateful that I came across it! I sautéed minced garlic & onion in butter, browned the chicken a bit. I then added chicken stock, water, salt & pepper to par boil until cooked through. The stock really made the noodles flavorful. I did not have any sour cream, so I added milk & the chicken/noodle stock to one can of cream of chicken soup. I added broccoli, thyme, rosemary & omitted the butter with the crackers. I did add some sharp cheddar on top of mixture but under crackers to half of it (some like cheese, some don't!). I LOVED the cheese with it. This was the comfort food I was looking for on such a cold, cold day.

Love this!!! I added 2 chopped carrots, 2 chopped celery stalks to the chicken while I was boiling it. Drained that then added chopped onions and garlic (that I cooked for a few minuted in olive oil) sliced mushrooms and 1 cup of slivered almonds. mixed it all together and wish I could keep my hands off of it before it goes in the oven. Oh I also added some almond milk to the mix ...probably 1/2 cup.  I love recipes where you can add to it and it makes it your own.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I  made this recipe exactly as written and was pretty disappointed.  The casserole was too creamy, from the soup and sour cream, almost paste-like.  And, this was about as bland as bland gets.  The only seasonings are salt and pepper.  I should have known better and should have continued searching for a better recipe.

Great recipe.  The only thing I did different was to create a chicken stock while cooking my chicken and used the stock to add to sour cream and soup mixture to add moisture.  I also added some frozen mixed vegies.  Fast, easy - good for working moms on the go.

My family loved this, although one daughter thought adding peas would be a great addition.  Next time I make this, I need to pay closer attention to the amount of noodles.  I put in a whole package of egg noodles and it came out a little dry.  Delicious flavor!

Dawne what a simple and delicious recipe!!  Thank you so much for sharing!  As I was mixing the soups and chix/noodles together I sprinkled in some onion powder, salt & pepper.  Everyone ate every drop on their plates!!!  Next time I will spread the buttered Ritz better over the top, I'm not fond of crunchy noodles! lol Or I'll just put a lid on for the first little while, remove and let the topping toast up some.  What a nice change of pace for such a yummy and easy meal!!

Must saute garlic, celery, mushrooms & onions to give it flavor as the chicken is pretty bland.  I made a double batch as long as I was trashing the kitchen and used the Amish thicker egg noodles, tossed it all together and froze it, crackers and all on top.  It was excellent to pull out and bake on another hockey night at our house!  I would make this for new mom's too!

I made this cassarole for the crew of guys at my husbands work. Everyone loved it! Of course I took a sneek taste before sending it out the door. I did add a little bit of carrots, and peas for color, and I added a tiny bit of stock paste into the soup and sour cream mix- for extra flavor,also added a bit of bread crumb into the cracker and butter mixture. I left some larger crumbles in the butter crackers, and it gave it a great crisp topping!!I otherwise followed the recipie as is, and it earned raved reviews for such a simple- easy, and quick lunch. Thank You!!

Three of my grandkids spent the day with me yesterday doing Christmas crafts.  I made this casserole earlier in the day and put it in the oven in time for supper, along with fresh green beans and cookies for dessert.  OMG, the kids wolfed it down at the speed of light.  It was just the right mixture for kids.  I did add half a small-dice onion and about 1/2 tsp of thyme, but I wouldn't add the thyme next time.  I also used 12oz. of broad noodles and another can of soup and an extra 1/2 cup of sour cream.  All in all, this was a huge hit!

Just what I was looking for.  I halved the recipe, used some left over boneless, skinless thighs, 1 can of cream of celery soup, and subbed buttered seasoned bread crumbs for the crackers.  Very yummy on a cloudy day.  Pure comfort food.  I'll be making this often.

My family and I really enjoyed this. I have a 3yo and a 12yo and they couldn't get enough.  My husband said I needed to make this on a regular basis. I did add some fresh steamed broccoli and a layer of sharp cheddar cheese before putting on the cracker crumbs.  I love this recipe because there is so much you can do with it. For the chicken I pan seared it first then added water to cover. To that I added half an onion, some chopped celery, and three cloves of smashed garlic.  When the chicken was done I took it out of the broth to cool. While the chicken was cooling I strained the broth brought it back to a boil and cooked my pasta I used bowtie. I also used my dutch oven. This recipe is a winner and will be in regular rotation in our household.

This is an excellent casserole. I have made this one for years. My kids love when I make it. I use bread crumbs (loaf bread) broken into pieces and butter poured on top instead of cracker crumbs.

I've made this recipe in the past as is. It's a good comfort food. The only thing I do differently is use store bought rotisserie chicken, which I keep on hand in the freezer. I could add carrots or peas, I suppose, but it's good the way it is.

This was delicious! The only difference was that I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and browned them in a pan with some garlic, onion, basil and oregano... It added great flavor and my husband loved the cracker crust!

The second meal I've prepared for the summer! Very yummy - I love moist food. I added a bag of frozen broccoli to the meal both for the sake of getting in a veggie and for some color.

Very good recipe!  Marinated the chicken before boilling and was VERY good!  I sauteed 1 small onion,1 tsp. minced garlic, and 2 celery stocks in 1 tbsp. butter.  Added that to the soup mixture and used mozzerella cheese to the top of the casserole instead of the cracker crumbs.  Thank you so much for the recipe Dawne!

This was a hit at my house. I took other users suggestions & added about 8 oz (~1/2 of a 16 oz bag) of frozen vegggies (chopped broccoli) & about 1/2 a cup of milk to help moisten before baking. The left overs are great the next day - if there are any.

My husband made this and he along with my daughter and I, LOVED it.  There were just a few tweaks - he added frozen vegetables, and instead of crumbled buttery rounds he added French's french fried onions to the top.  He took it out of the oven about 5 minutes before it was done and topped it with cheddar and put it back in the oven to melt.  DELICIOUS!

So Good!  Cooking the noodles directly in the chicken water was a new tip for me.  I was very impressed.  And it'll last my family for days, which is perfect for me because I'm not able to cook every day.  Thanks so much!

The only change I made was to use a whole seasoned rotisserie chicken from the grocery store deli, instead of chicken breasts.  I think this made a huge difference, and it was not bland at all, as others stated.  It was much better than I expected, and possibly even better the following day.

Better than I thought it would be.  I dumped in the whole bag of noodles (12oz).  Couldnt see putting in a half of a bag into the pantry.  I baked the chicken per some people recommending that when I asked about poaching chicken.

A little bland but I'm still giving it a 4 because it is a great "starting" recipe.  Next time I will add a few additional spices to give it a little more flavor.

Made recipe as is except I used garlic mushroom soup because that was all I had.  Next time, I will season the chicken more and add french fried onions with the buttery crackers.

This was pretty tasty. I did read all the reviews first, and took some advice. I used a little more chicken and put it in my slow cooker w/chicken broth. I made homemade noodles instead of egg noodles. I also added a little milk to the soup mixture and onion and put some mixed veggies in it.Plus used a whole sleeve of ritz crackers. I also cooked it 45 mins.....My boyfriend loved it.......

Excellent recipie. I followed others advice and cooked the chicken in olive oil with my favorite seasonings with garlic & finely diced onion. I also added some cheese to the sauce. It turned out really good, even my picky kid ate it.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful! I did follow what others said by adding a couple things for flavor so it wouldn't be bland. I added a half of a sweet onion (diced), a few stalks of fresh celery (diced), and Cavander's Greek seasoning. Yum!!

I cannot understand all the 5-star reviews. Prepared "as is," this was rather bland. Hubby and children thought it was okay. Might be a keeper at some point with a bit of "tweaking."

Very delicious!! I added a little garlic, 1/2 cup of chicken broth, and a bag of frozen mixed vegetables. Cooked for 10-15 minutes longer to allow the veggies to cook. I also used cut up spaghetti noodles because that's what I had on hand. Turned out great!!

Fantastic! I made some changes based on what others have suggested. I sauteed in a little butter 2 chopped garlic cloves, 1/2 onion chopped fine and two celery stalks chopped fine, and added that to the mix along with 1/2 bag frozen mixed veggies. I also added 1/2 tsp thyme and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I cut up a rotisserie chicken since I have never poached chicken before and was afraid of the disaster that could ensue. I probably used a bit more than the recommended 6 oz of noodles. I kept everything else the same.

Really delicious-- I will definitely make again!

Made this with leftover roast chicken and added peas. I recommend using twice as much Ritz crackers and half as much butter for the topping.

The recipe as written is a solid 4 stars. With some minor alterations, it's a 5. Add chopped onions, and/or any veggies you have on hand. If you use the Ritz crackers, don't add any extra salt. Also, and this is just my taste, but as written this dried out on me so the next time I added about 1/2 cup milk.

Good comfort food.  I also added half an onion, a cup or so of broccoli florets, and chopped up a couple stalks of celery.  I shocked the broccoli and celery before adding to casserole to soften them a bit.  Also, I used rigatoni, because I didn't have the egg noodles.  Next time, I'd up the pasta just a bit, so the veggie ratio isn't too much, but it turned out deliciously!  Just what I was in the mood for.

When u add the seasonings garlic/onion/thyme/ fresh or dried & add the mixed veggies This is definately a 5-star recipe. Even without the veggies it's a 5 star dish.... we know this is not a chicken pot pie recipe :) but everyone likes to add their 2 cents, but it's still good as is

I used buttery crunched up cornflakes on top instead of Ritz crackers, and while I was sauteing the chicken, I also sauteed some fresh mushrooms and celery.  My husband had 3 helpings and took the rest for lunch the next day. Sooo yummy!

very good.  I used 1 can cream of celery in place of cream of mushrooms. I added broccoli crowns to the pasta during the last minute of boiling. I also added 1 tsp. each of seasoned salt, garlic powder, pepper and basil.  My husband and daughter loved it as well.

The recipe was ok.  I added some peas and carrots as well as some broccoli.  Seemed like it needed more for a taste.  No kick, but good otherwise.

I thought this had a great flavor and was quick and easy. I didn't have sour cream though, so I added a dollop of french onion chip dip and about half a cup of cottage cheese. It turned out great. Next time, I will add peas, too.

This is very good.  I made for my daughter and her very picky children and they love it.  The only thing I did different was I use saltine crackers instead of butter flavor crackers.  It was a hit at Grandma home.

I'm giving this 4 stars without even making it. I make my version almost the same way. Like another reviewer I dislike when people add more stuff to the given recipe and then don't like it. Yes this is rather bland. It's not meant to be spicy, garlicy, salty, peppery, or any other spicey. It's great for picky kids. The only thing I do different is toss it in the microwave for 12 mins on 50% in a microwave safe dish. I grew up on this dish and still love it at age 40.

Very Good.  I have not made a tuna casserole in years...as hubby doesn't like "cooked" tuna, so we enjoyed this while he was out of town.  I added some diced carrots and onions.  Was a smidge dry... but perhaps I had a bit more macroni than needed.  Thanks.

Great recipe!   I didn't have enough egg noodles so I added bow ties pasta to make up the six ounces which gave it a nice texture.  Canned mushrooms and a packet of onion soup mix went into the cream soup mixture.  Parmesan cheese was added to the topping.  This will be a regular in our house.

This is an excellent recipe. My husband doesn't like mushrooms, and I have found that cream of celery or cream of broccoli works just as well. You can also add in some spinach or broccoli to work in some healthy greens and make the recipe even more interesting and delicious.

This was very tasty - I made few changes, I boiled chicken with salt pepper & two garlic cloves. Also I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of celery, also some onion flakes and basil. And for the topping I used half cup bread crumbs and half cup saltiness crackers crushed, and parmesan cheese, and used broiler to brown the top. Will defiantly make again.

We loved this. I put some onions and mushrooms in saute pan with alittle butter, then added cooked chicken to mix all together. After noodles were done I mixed the all of it together then put in the dish to cook. I topped it with some grated cheese then added homemade sour dough bread crumbs mixed with butter on top of the cheese. It was Great, everyone loved it and we are looking forward to the left overs tonight.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was SO GOOD!  I had leftover cooked egg noodles from last night's pot roast, so I thought this would be a good way to use them up.  I used 3 large chicken breasts, and cooked them on my Foreman grill with salt and pepper.  I also added mushrooms, which I browned up with butter and minced garlic, and added them to the mixture.  I used the leftover butter and garlic in the pan for the cracker crumbs at the end.  The meal was really rich and buttery, so I will probably used reduced-fat ingredients and Country Crock instead of real butter next time.  Made lots of leftovers for me and my husband, and I can't wait to heat it up for lunch or dinner tomorrow.  Very yummy!  Thanks!

Didn't have crackers so I used panko bread crumbs & some parm for the topping.  I also added some thyme & garlic powder as well as some chopped red onion, just because it sounded a little bland.  Really rich & tasty.

I give it 5 stars as I made it -- added broccoli and cheddar cheese.  My boyfriend kept saying "mmmm" while he was eating it and said it was "warm in his tummy."  :-)  Thanks!

Very good!  I try to follow recipes as written the first time I prepare them- I only had a few crackers so I used them and added some seasoned breadcrumbs to top this off-everyone enjoyed this and there arn't any leftovers.

I gave this 5 stars, my family loved it and even myself and I normally hate tuna/chicken casseroles. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup but I did have 2 cans of cream of chicken so I used those and added sauteed mushrooms to make up for the loss of the soup and also added broccoli and a tiiiiny little bit of cayenne pepper to to give it a kick. Yum!

Really easy, really yummy--what more can you ask for?!  I made a low fat version, adding a tbsp of mustard, canned mushrooms, and a cup of cheese on top.  I'm probably going to add this to my hard copy recipe book.

Hubby says five stars. I followed the recipe with the exception of throwing in some frozen peas for color. I froze half and baked half. You can't beat this for a quick and hearty meal.

Just made this and it was good. The only thing I did different was leave out the salt because of salt in soup. I added mushrooms, and used 1 1/2 cup crackers and lightly sprinkled parmasean cheese across the top before the cracker crumbs. The cheese gave it a great flavor with out added in a lot of extras. It's a keeper.

This is a really good recipe just as is.  My husband is very picky and he really liked this.  I used Town House crackers and it really topped this perfectly.  Instead of using chicken breasts, I used a can of chicken breast meat.  Very quick and easy.

This recipie is so wonderful! I have always avoided casseroles because they remind me of being poor as a kid. I found myself in a bind with limited ingredients, time, and ideas and stumbled accross this.  My entire family is full of picky eaters, but everyone absolutely loved this dish!! Its incredibly quick and easy to make. Thank you so much for sharing!!

My kids who hate "mixed food" both exclaimed that they loved this!  Hubby went back for seconds at least once.  I took the advice of others and added some onions and garlic sauteed in butter, and also added a can of corn and some cheddar cheese.  I didn't have enough crackers on hand, so I used what I had, and added some italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  Great winter dinner!

Great recipe! I added two cans of cream of mushroom soup to make it more moist and creamy. I also added fresh mushrooms. I made this dish a few times now and both my husband and I love it. I also made it with ground turkey once instead of the chicken and it was absolutely delicious.

I added 1 medium chopped onion, 2 chopped cloves of garlic, and a tbsp basil. I saute those in a pad of butter once the onions are finished I add the chicken and add a bit of brown. Then I add the entire mixture to the soups and sour cream. MMM mmm! You will love it! My family's FAVORITE meal! My husband asks for it every night.

Very good.  Although I did make a few changes.  I sauteed about a half a stick of butter and added a small onion chopped finely to it along with some garlic powder (no fresh garlic in the frig).   Mixed in with the ingredients.  I added parsley, garlic powder, and a bit of paprika to the crumbs.

This is a great dish, a new family favorite. It is very easy to throw together, and we usually have most of the ingredients on hand. I add a bag of steamed (frozen) broccoli to get our veggies in. **I made it for the 3rd time tonight and accidentally added a can of cheddar cheese soup when I thought I added cream of chicken. I decided to leave it in along with all the other ingredients and it turned out better than ever! My husband couldn't stop getting more helpings!

This was one of the best casseroles I have ever prepared for my family.  We normally are not casserole lovers, but I decided to give this a try!  The only change I made was a lot of garlic and onion powder, pepper, shredded cheddar cheese through out and parmesan cheese on top of the cracker topping.  My son and his fiance about polished the leftovers off the next day, leaving a tiny bit for me to take in my lunch the next day!  This is a keeper!

This was a great dish that required little effort and few ingredients. My husband raved over this and took the leftovers to work to share with the guys. Basically this is just chicken and noodles but with the addition of sour cream and being baked. I was expecting this to be a bit dry after baking but it wasn't at all. I used a 12 oz. package of Kluski noodles and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. I used a 3 qt. dish for this as it was too much for the small 8x8 2 qt. dish. This made a big pan full of chicken and noodles. When I fix this again I am going to add in some garlic and onion and probably a pinch of poultry seasoning too. This is a dish that is easily expanded to feed a crowd or scaled down for just two. Thanks for the wonderful twist on old fashioned chicken and noodles! This was really great.

Great way to use leftover chicken.  I sauteed the chicken with some choppen onion in olive oil, cooked the noodles with half chicken broth and half water.  I also added a handful of parmesan cheese to the cracker crumbs. Added a level of richness.

We used stuffing instead of crackers. We put have in the mixture and half on top for crunch. This is a wonderful recipe either way.

I made this with leftover turkey breast and used a whole 12 oz package of egg noodles but didn't need to add any additional soup or sour cream. I also added some frozen veggies along with garlic and onion powder. The best part of this is the cracker topping.  We thought it was delish!

This is SOOO good!  I did add some frozen veggies that I had rinced under cold water before I threw everything together to bake.  Highly recommend this for a fast fix!

Creamy and so yummy!  Campbell's makes a cream of mushroom and chicken combined, so I used that.  I added Nature's Seasonings...lots actually...it was delicious!

Don't really know why this has such a high rating? It is pretty bland if you follow the recipe. I added carrots, peas, and diced onions. It was much better to taste and it had more appeal.

I only gave it 3 stars because the chicken being poached gave it a bland taste. The next time I made it I browned the chicken in a pan and added a couple chicken boullion cubes to the noodle water. I also added cheese to the top before the cracker crumbs and it was pretty good then.

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers,this recipe would have been very bland if I hadn't made several additions: about 6oz grated cheddar cheese,broccoli florets and ample salt and pepper that I mixed in the soups and sour cream mixture,which I added about 1/2 soup can of water to get the consistancy that I wanted. Also, I cant believe that the 6 oz's of egg noodles is not a typo. I added about 20 oz or so of dry egg noodles, (before boiling) and the casserole still came out very creamy after baking. I also added grated parmesan cheese to the cracker crumbs for the topping. After all that, the finished casserole was delicious. This is a good base recipe for personal additions,which is why I gave it only 4 stars.

I sauteed the chicken chunks, then added carrots and celery. Then, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. WOW! It was SO amazing and easy! This is going to be a regular dish around our house!

I substituted broccoli soup instead of the mushroom because I decided to add frozen broccoli and make it a one dish meal. Instead of cracker crumbs I sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Very creamy and delicious. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty recipe! I have made this several times and it always comes out perfect.  To add a little more to the recipe, I add a half of a bag of frozen mixed vegetables.  I cook the vegetables with the egg noodles and add to the mix.

My family loved this recipe, but I did change it up a bit to suit our tastes and make it easier to prepare.  First, I added cooked onion, peas & carrots and substituted cream of chicken soup for the mushroom soup.  I also used an entire bag of egg noodles and a full sleeve of crackers, which I crushed before opening.  Oh, and  I just threw in a couple cups of chicken that I pulled off a rotisserie chicken rather than boiling the breasts.

I made this for a co-worker who was in between chemo treatments and she LOVED this recipe. Her appetite decreased but she said she would stuff herself with this casserole then sleep like a baby. She recently passed away but I'm glad I was able to cook something for her that brought her such pleasure. Many thanks for sharing this comforting recipe.

An intriguing take on the basic "Chicken Casserole," Chicken Noodle Casserole 1 blew us away with tantalizing flavors in a reasonable easy to cook recipe. "wow this is great!" said Nicole B. And Dave W. responded, "Sure is!" definitely one for the books girls, this will knock your socks off! Make sure to use more than 6 oz of noodles and less than 4 full chicken breasts.

Great recipe. I made a few additions and my kids loved it. Sauted 2 green onions and a chopped clove of garlic. Then added the soup and sour cream mixture to the pan. 1/2 tsp thyme,salt and pepper and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Also 2 Tbs of cream sherry and heated through. I didn't have crackers so I used Italian bread crumbs. Make sure you leave noodles aldente so they don't over cook when baking.

Loved it! I added a little milk because I thought it might be dry and left it for only 20 minutes....didn't realize the sour cream would become more creamy after it warmed up. This is a keeper!

First I will start off saying that if I had not added additional ingredients this dish would have been very bland.  I am giving it five stars with the additions I made.  I added a bag of frozen mixed veggies, sauteed mushrooms, garlic and onion and added, and added oregano and basil to the sauce.  This dish came out very tasty.

Great recipe.  I added mushrooms and celery to the recipe as well.  Next time I will add 12 oz of noobles (instead of 6 oz), add peas and bake at 350 for 1 hour.  I found that 30 minutes wasn't quite long enough.

I did everything the same but, I boiled the chicken with some chopped onion, a couple cloves roughly chopped garlic, salt, pepper, and cumin.  And when I made the soup mixture, I used cream of celery instead of mushroom, added a can of green chilies (minced) and the juice from the can.  It was a nice little addition to a recipe we already like.   P.S. I just keep a can of bread crumbs (Progresso) on hand to sprinkle on top, I can"t handle all that butter :)

this was incredibly easy and delicious. i added a few more seasonings (garlic powder, italian seasoning and montreal chicken seasoning), increased the amount of noodles and decreased the amount of butter to 4 tablespoons, and it was just wonderful. my fiance and brother ate half the pan! very saucy and a hearty meal with rolls. i will definitely put this into our dinner routine!

Very good!  Per other review and my person taste I made a few changes:  Sauteed some mushrooms, onion and garlic and add to soup mix.  Also added some thyme, garlic powder and onion powder.  Threw some shredded Fontina cheese I had in there and put a little shredded colby on top before the crackers.  Turned out really well.  A keeper and great comfort food!!

My kids HATE casseroles and approached the table with VERY negative attitudes.  Well they all had to taste it and ended up eating thirds!!!!!  I browned the chicken in a skillet, added 2 cloves of garlic to the soup mixture, cooked the noodles w/ half chicken broth half water.  Used broth in the pan after browning the chicken and reduced that by half, added to the soup mixture as well.  I am NOT a cook and the kids are asking if we can have this dish tomorrow as well!  Best reception I've ever gotten at the dinner table!

I followed the recipe, except I sauteed chopped onion and garlic w/the chicken in a little olive oil, then poured the pan drippings into the boiling water for the noodles. Also, I sprinkled the dry crushed crackers on top and drizzled with only about 2 tablespoons of butter, which was plenty. (NOTE: 6 oz. of noodles is about 3 cups dry.) Good recipe!

I thought this recipe was really good, and easy to make. Cut ingredients in half, and actually added saute mushrooms, garlic, green peppers, and green onions. At last minute also threw in some artichoke hearts as I stirred in the chicken and noodles. Turned out great, and filled a 9 x 9 casserole dish.

I also changed this recipe around because poaching chicken is icky!  I cubed my chicken and seasoned it with garlic powder, cayenne, salt and pepper, browned it in olive oil and then added about 1/2 cup each finely diced celery, onion, green pepper, also added 1 cup cliced mushrooms and 2 finely minced garlic cloves, le that all brown and then hit it with a bit of chicken stock to get all of the flavor off of the bottom of the pan.  mixed all of the other ingrediants together and added 3 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley and a cup of fresh baby spinach, put in casserole dish, added 2 cips colby jack shredded cheese and then the cracker mixture, much flavor!

This is so far the best chicken noodle casserole!!  The only changes I made are: I boiled the chiken in chicken broth & also cooked the noodles in that same broth.  I added diced celery and diced onions.  I mixed a little more than a cup of the crushed butter crackers with the 1/2 cup butter and a cup of shredded cheese.  Turned out delicious! Will definitely make again!

D-E-L-I-C-O-U-S!! Based on some prior reviews, I made some minor adjustments. Without these adjustments, it would still be great though! I cooked the chicken in chicken broth and added some garlic pepper/salt.  Then I cooked the pasta in the broth when the chicken was done.  I ended up spending the time to shred the chicken, which was GREAT! Time consuming, but worth it! I cooked a 1/2 package of mixed veggies in with the same broth from the pasta and chicken.  I took one reviewer's advice, and used 1/3 c. of the Shake & Bake (Italian) crumbs, and 2/3 c. Ritz crackers, for the topping. DEFINITELY use the Shake & Bake!! Made the difference!! I put the Ritz crackers in a plastic baggie, and smushed them up, and used the side of the blade of a large butcher knife, to rub over the plastic bag. It turned out fabulous, and will definitely be making it again!!

Okay, this recipe was a real meal saver. With almost nothing in the way of groceries in the house and me not wanting to go to the store (shocking, right!?) this recipe sure came in handy. I did have to admit that I had to alter the recipe a bit just because of what I had or did not have on hand. I did add some garlic powder and onion powder to the chicken breasts as they cooked. I sauteed some onion, used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of celery and had to use 8 oz of cream cheese and 3/4 cup of milk. I also added some shredded cheddar cheese and some frozen peas.  I did top this casserole with the cracker crumbs and a few very small pats of butter. This was not exactly the healthiest, but it has to be better than fast food, and it tasted waay better too! Everyone really liked this, and had seconds and thirds. Served with a tossed salad, this was a good, thrown together, easy and yummy meal!

Good -- I used fat free sour cream and the low fat versions of the soup.  I also used whole wheat egg noodles.

This stuff was awesome.  I used my favorite dinner shortcut- rotisserie chicken from the local supermarket.  I cooked the noodles in plain salted water, and just shredded the chicken as I removed it from the bones.  I also thought that the butter this recipe called for was way too much for the cracker amount, so I just eliminated it altogether and bought seasoned bread crumbs.  They are cheaper than real butter and Ritz crackers, and it makes the dish a little healthier by eliminating the butter altogether.  My boyfriend went back for thirds, and between the two of us, we finished off an entire 9x13 pan of this within 24 hours.

This is a quick and easy casserole. I think I will add it to my list of comfort foods!  I sauteed some chopped onion and celery until tender and stirred in before baking.  I also added frozen peas & carrots before baking. I probably won't make it often but it was tasty.  I will try cutting way back on the butter next time I make it.

I live in India and sometimes have to make adjustments.  I used yogurt instead of sour cream and it turned out wonderful! (I am able to get canned soup at a cost, but sour cream is not something readily available.)  I also agree this is just as good if not better reheated the next day.  THANK YOU!!!!!

I normally steer clear of canned soup recipes because I find the flavor tinny, but I made this in a pinch and found it surprisingly good. Even my kids, who don't normally like their food mixed together casserole style, loved this, especially the topping. I used cream of celery & cream of mushroom because that was what I had, heated them together with the other ingredients on the stove before throwing in the oven, and it was easy and good.

I made this recipe this week and my family of 5 loved it!  I used minced garlic from a jar, added a small jar of mushrooms & frozen peas and carrots.  I did not have any Ritz-type crackers, but as I was enptying the cream of mushroom soup can, I saw the "green bean casserole" recipe on the label and realized I had the french fried onions they show on there and they would work for the topping!  I I crumbled the FF onions and spread them around.  My husband couldn't get enough of this dish and even had it for lunch the next day!!  Reated 4 stars because of the additions I made.

Great base.  I wanted more of a chicken & cheese casserole so I changed it a bit.  1 can of cheddar cheese soup, 16oz sour cream, 8 oz cooked noodles, 1/4-1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1-2 cups diced cooked chicken & 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese. Topped with cracker/butter mixture.  Baked covered 30 min, uncovered 15 min.

This is a wonderful base to expand upon and make a really good casserole.  I cooked frozen chicken breasts and the condensed soups (One of the cans was a Campbell's mushroom with garlic) together in a crock pot for a few hours on "high", then shredded the chicken.  I took bits and pieces of advice from other reviewers, adding sauteed mushrooms, onions, garlic, peas and some Parmesan cheese.  I also used a garlic/parsley flavored noodle.  Even with all the additions, the flavors were not overpowering at all, so be prepared to tinker if you want don't want a pretty bland product!

I started making it and realized I had no sour cream and it was pouring outside so I made it with what I had on hand. I put half a can of milk in the mixture and I pureed some califlower with a splash of milk in my magic bullet. I did this mainly because I have a SUPER picky toddler who wont eat vegetables so I hide them in her food when I can. I didnt saute the cracker crumbs in butter, Instead I used about a cup of cheese on top of the casserole and then crumbed some ritz crackers on top of that (my toddler helped with this part). smelled really good. I pulled it out of the over early as it started to dry out. next time i will add alittle more milk of make sure i have sour cream on hand. all in all a good easy meal. the ultimate test to me is if my daughter will eat it...and she did! so it get 5 stars just for that alone!!

very good, w/a few tweaks.  I added several shakes of tarragon and pepper. added extra chicken base(bouillion paste) to the water for the noodles as others did.  I skipped over the cracker top, as my family loves crunchy tops to noodle casseroles. this is going into fairly regular rotation at my house!

WOW! I was really suprised at how good this came out - so much flavor!! I did make a few changes. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken (i hate cream of mushroom), flavored the water to cook the chicken with a bay leaf and some mrs. dash, and added a little montreal chicken seasoning to the soup/sour cream mix. Topped it off with shredded cheddar and seasoned bread crumbs. Yummy! It makes a lot (hubby and I had large helpings and we will eat the leftover for at least two lunches.)

I made this exact BUT... with all low-fat/fat free ingredients and it came out soooo good! My boyfriend hates all fat free things and he actually loved this. He told me to make it as much as I want, he even had seconds and took the rest for lunch the next day!!! It was a big hit. I added some peas too... came out perfect! Thanks!

I liked this recipe for its "homeyness" and the ease in preparation.  I made a half recipe and added some diced carrot (cooked with the noodles) and some frozen peas, and I mixed a little bit of cheddar cheese in with the buttered crumbs.  I only used half the butter called for in the crumbs and it turned out crunchy and perfect.  This recipe maybe lacked a little bit of flavor for my grown-up taste, but would certainly be a great recipe for those with picky kids.  Next time, I will add some sauteed onion and maybe some spices like thyme or poultry seasoning to jazz up the cream sauce.  Also, I think it needs more noodles, maybe half again as much.  Overall, good but not outstanding.  This is just too simple to rate highly in my opinion.

This was absolutely splendid.  It satisfied my boyfriend (who insists upon conventional, familiar things) and myself (who favors unique combinations).  The topping was somewhat reminiscent of pot pie, but the saltiness of the crackers added a different dimension.  Also, the use of canned soups was fantastically simple.  I stored the leftovers (which heat up well, even without the cheese) and ate it for days.

I think it would be possible to add some vegetables to this recipe (especially peas and cauliflower) if you prefer, but it's excellent on its own.

GREAT - three chicken breasts halves are plenty - definately add 1/2 cup milk - used at least 8 oz noodles - used one can cream of chick and one cream of celery - 2 cups crushed crackers mixed with one stick melted butter (could use cornflakes also)- meant to sprinkle pepper jack cheese before topping, but forgot - hubby and kid loved it!

I loved it! The only thing I did differently was add about a tablespoon of poppy seeds in my Ritz crackers. It is also really good if you use 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup intead of 1 mushroom and 1 chicken.

I didn't eat any of this, as I wasn't feeling well the night I cooked it. It sounded so easy to make, and it really was as easy as it sounded-which saved the day! My husband, who is 5'10, 170 pounds-gobbled about 3/4 of the casserole up. He really enjoyed the 'taste of chicken noodle soup, but with the texture of a real meal.' I did add a bag of frozen veggies to it, a pea-carrot-lima bean mixture, as I have a 3 year old that is adament in avoiding all things healthy...he didn't detect it at all, so any moms out there with non-veggie kids, this is your meal! Anyway, as I said, my hubby ate 3/4 of the casserole, my toddler had a generous serving, and what was left was eaten for breakfast by hubby the next day. I didn't get a bite, but I will be making this again based on their reactions!

Great recipe.  Good "comfort food".  I use bread crumbs instead of crackers for the topping and comes out fine.

This is a great recipe - rich, and so delicious you probably end up eating more than you should!
I did not have cracker crumbs, so I used crushed corn flakes, and drizzled the butter on top of them.  I think you definitely need that crunch on the top.

Wow!  That was really good!  Very easy to make as well!  My husband said he thought their was too much chicken, and I only used 3 chicken breasts.  I thought it was just fine.  We decided the next time we make it, we will add mushrooms and peas or broccoli.  I also used the 98% fat free soups and reduced fat sour cream.  I can only imagine how rich it must be if regular ingredients are used.  Worth giving it a try!  Thanks Dawne!  : )

Delicious. The second time I made this, I used light sour cream and half the butter called for by the recipe to bring the fat down to a reasonable level. The taste wasn't noticeably affected.  Reheats well in the microwave - great for leftovers.

Awesome and famously yummy! I also made some variations. I poached the chicken in chicken stock with added spices, cayenne,cinnamon,nutmeg,etc. I also added a bag of frozen vegetables and l layered the mix with a mozzarella and cheddar cheese mix.

This was a hit with my fam of 8. 4 picky little girls ate it up. I poached the chicken breasts adding 1/2 onion, 2 carrots and 2 celery stalks cut up and added S&P to the liquid. I strained the broth after poaching chicken, and cooked the noodles in the broth. Also sautéed finely chopped onion, celery in mix of butter and olive oil. Added about 3/4 cup milk to the soups. Added 1 C frozen peas. Topped with grated cheddar before adding buttered crumbs on top. Creamy and very good.

My son (8 years old) is the pickiest eater I've ever met.  Like, he won't eat meat unless it's highly processed (he LOVES salami and pepperoni), won't touch cheese unless it's NOT fresh parmesan sprinkled on his pasta, and if it's green, don't even put it on his plate.  We've introduced him to so many different ways to eat the things he hates, and he wants nothing to do with it.  The kid would be perfectly content eating hot dogs and cheeseless pizza every day for the rest of his life.  Because of this, I've had to get creative to sneak meats into his diet.  This recipe made this so simple!  I'm able to throw the chicken into the food processor and grind it until he doesn't notice it in the sauce, and the best part of all, HE LOVES THIS RECIPE!!!  I make it absolutely as written, and he gobbles it up.  Even asks for seconds!  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!!!

I'm not normally a casserole fan but was looking for some easy weekday meals so thought I'd give this a shot because of the high reviews. It didn't disappoint! I wasn't expecting a culinary masterpiece from a quick weekday casserole and it was better than expected. 

I didn't adjust this recipe much. I just have a thing with texture of chicken so I browned them really well in a pan with a salt and pepper rub before poaching with garlic and chicken broth to finish them. I also mixed the cracker crumbs into the pan leftovers vs just using butter. They were delicious. 

I thought that the soup and sour cream mix was too much. I'll use less the next time I make this. My family thought it was a good amount though so clearly just opinion. 

Myself (casserole hater), husband (easy to please), 2 and 4 year olds (never both like the same things), and my mother (very picky) all liked this so I'll say it was a win.

I doubled this because we had 2 adults and 3 teenage boys. And there was not a lot left after my boyfriend took a huge scoop to work today. I used a little more chicken. I liked the idea of browning the chicken  that had thyme and oregano on it, on the cast iron skillet  with a chopped onion and fresh garlic and then adding in the chicken broth.  then I removed the chicken broth and onions and scraped the yummy bits.  I added that all to the cream mixture. Then I added the rest of the chicken broth and yummy bits to the boiling water for the noodles.  The biggest thing to remember is almost undercook the chicken just a tad because it cooks more in the oven. I baked it for just over 1/2 hour which was fine even though I doubled it. Oh yes, I also added some milk to the cream mixture.  Big success!!

I made bite-sized pieces out of some Tyson's frozen grilled and seasoned chicken breast strips; they're already seasoned, so I didn't worry about the "bland" part.  Was making this for two of us, so took  4 cups of dry egg noodles and boiled them in salted water, mixed the drained noodles with the chicken, one can of cream of mushroom/garlic soup and a half soup can of milk. (When doubling, I may use Crm of Chicken/Herbs for second can of soup.)  Added frozen peas/carrots/beans that I'd microwaved for 2-3 minutes to get them started,  Skipped the sour cream.  Put it all in an 8x8 casserole and baked it for 30 minutes, topping it with french fried onion rings for the last five minutes of the 30.  So good! So quick!  Great basic recipe with many possible variations.  Served it with crispy breadsticks and fruit.  Thank you, Dawne.

I added half a can of cream of celery, 1/2 cup of milk because I wanted it more creamy, and added a tablespoon of garlic salt. It turned out very good! I served it with a side of biscuits and fresh steamed carrots! This definitly hit the spot as far as comfort foods go. I would make it again!

This is a good foundation for a kid-friendly casserole that can easily be transformed to adult tastes by adding some additional ingredients.  I had to keep mine kid friendly this time around so I took some other reviewers suggestions and used only cream of chicken (kids don't like mushrooms yet), cut the butter in half but did add additional crackers (I used 3 of the mini sleeves of ritz) as well as italian seasoned bread crumbs (about 1/4 C), and I made sure to season the chicken with rosemary, sage and thyme in addition to salt, pepper and garlic.  In the future I look forward to adding in onions and other vegetables as my kids can tolerate.  I would also add some swiss or provolone slices ripped up and mixed in.  Could use cheddar if you wanted to.  I gave it 4 stars since it is bland to start but easily adaptable.  Glad I took reviewers suggestions.

I made this recipe as is and would give it four stars.  Easy and very good.  It didn't get 5 stars because it was too much sour cream for me.

After making as the recipe calls, the next time I did it, I used half the the sour cream and added garlic power- that kicked it up to 5 stars for me/my personal tastes.

I especially like to make this when I have left over meat from a whole roast chicken or turkey.

I made this last night and it's delicious!  I made a couple additions: added 2 - 3 cloves of crushed fresh garlic to the water poaching the chicken (we love garlic!) then remove the garlic and chopped it along with the chicken, (you can always add the chopped fresh garlic to the soups if you want more garlic flavor) added 1 regular package of frozen mixed vegetables in the last 3  minutes of cooking the pasta in the same water. (water will simmer down, but will return to boiling rather quickly) I always cook the pasta al dente anyway since it's going to bake in the oven. It was super easy and we loved it!

This recipe is a good base, but it needs a lot more flavor and texture for my taste.  I sautéed in butter onions, celery and added fresh diced carrots and frozen peas.  I added 3/4 can of milk as other reviewers mentioned to keep it from drying out.  After I mixed all of the ingredients together and put in a baking dish, I then added 2tlbs of melted butter to about a cup of Panko  crumbs, added a little salt and pepper and then sprinkled the Panko mixture on top.  I love the crispy topping this makes for the casserole.   I make this casserole dish often now for my family, sometimes doubling the recipe so we have leftovers for the week.

Been making this from 1964 it was called mom's chicken casserole.  It is great and you can change it up with cream of cheese soup and baked ham .  Has gotten many college children through a lot of late night cramming.It also in my opinion is better next day the only difference is the topping and there again it is a choice.  I use crushed potato chips, also now have used crushed pretzel sticks

I have tried this recipe a couple times and last night I did a few things differently and the family actually loved it! I used whole wheat no yolk noodles (12 ounces), added a little garlic.  Used 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of french onion dip. Gave it a great flavor I think! Usually the family complains about whole wheat anything...but they didn't this time!

This was delicious. Hubby and I ate the whole thing. Only difference was I used canned chunk chic breast.  Next time, Veggies mixed in instead of on the side, maybe some pimento or capers.  Great recipe to start with.  Definitely make it again!.

Yummerz! I've made this twice, the first time I followed the recipe exactly, the only change I made was to add some homemade chicken stock to the cooking water for the chicken breasts and noodles. It got rave reviews and I brought home an empty cassarole dish. The second time, I already had chicken from the night before, so I used that, and cooked the noodles in half water, half chicken stock. I also added some frozen mixed vegetables. It was super delicious. Even my picky sons loved it.

overall very tasty. It lacked in the crunch department though. A little garlic powder added just the right flavor to finish the dish.

Prepared this per recipe w/1 exception, added frozen peas which added flavor and color.  Next time I will add fresh/can mushrooms, peas, and additional seasoning. Served w/a salad. Enjoying leftovers for lunch.

AS IS (which is what reviews are supposed to be based on), this was very bland and just "meh". Basic starter recipe. With adjustments like more seasonings, added sauteed veggies (onions, garlic, and celery), I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.

As is, this recipe is mediocre with the potential to be great. As everyone who has read the reviews will notice, you are definitely going to want to spice this up with assorted veggies and spices. You really can use whatever suits your tastes as far as seasonings go in this recipe, but for the sake of reviewing I reccomend the classic CNS ingredients: carrots and celery. Onion would be great as well. I added poultry seasoning, garlic salt, onion powder and pepper. I would also reccomend using a different method of cooking the chicken- I personally don't prefer the poaching effect- I think this would be excellent grilled or baked. I also used regular breadcrumbs as I didn't have any crackers in the pantry. I'd like to try this with the buttery crackers or seasoned panko breadcrumbs next time. Overall, the recipe is a great base as it stands, but definitely hits it out of the park with the addition of vegetables and seasonings.

Hmm - I have mixed thoughts about this recipe. I followed the recipe almost as written with the exception of using 12 oz of noodles and omitting the topping.  I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes in a covered casserole dish. The grandsons enjoyed the meal very much and I will keep the recipe - but next time I will try adding some milk as a previous reviewer suggested. I think it may lighten the dish somewhat. Broccoli was served on the side - one of their favorite veggies.  Altogether, as I reflect on it, a rather nice meal - no leftovers at all! Thank you, Dawne.

I am gluten free so I made this exactly as recipe stated, only with GF noodles and GF soups and crackers and it was EXCELLENT! Great comfort food. The whole family loved it and went back for seconds. Suggestion: make sure all the noodles are covered completely. Those that were sticking out on top got a little crunchy after baking.

I used some rotisserie chicken from the grocery store & roast turkey I used some turkey gravy I also had in the freezer . That was an awesome addition .I halved the sour cream just personal preference . Added some onions flakes & about 1 tsp of Mrs Dash chicken seasoning , it added a nice flavor . To cut out a lot of calories I didn't use the butter just crushed some soda crackers on top , they are really good  add a nice crunch .

I added fresh peas and carrots for a vegetable twist. I also substituted two cans of Cream of Chicken soup for the Cream of Mushroom- I'm allergic to mushrooms, and it was a yummy Fall dinner with a side salad! (Especially since the six year old loved it!)

I made this but made some modifications based on others' reviews and it was great.  I disagree with writers who say to rate recipe as written. This is why I use AllRecipes, to get others feedback. Food is way too expensive to and time is too valuable to waste on a blah recipe.  Keep the comments coming, folks.  I love them.

The whole family loves this recipe - we make it about once a week and there are never leftovers. The only change we made was to use Costco's roasted chicken pieces instead of poaching our own. We do cook the egg noodles with some chicken broth or powdered bullion in the water and we usually do the mixing of everything right in the noodle pot after noodles are drained & water removed from the pot. We've talked about maybe adding some peas or corn in the mix, but haven't tried that yet - still enjoying it as-is. It's truly comfort food.

And if I had my way I'd add peas... But no one in my house likes peas, so I just heat up a side for me and mix them in on my own plate...  :0)
I would like to use something other than sour cream, so I could eat more... But I don't know what I could use...

This is a good starter casserole recipe. It's good basic comfort food on its own but leaves room for creating your own recipes from it. The possibilities are endless. Any of the health conscious reviewers should know how to tweak it. If you don't like canned soup it's easy to make your own cream of anything base and if it's that important to you you should learn how.

This was amazing! The only thing I did differently was to add about two ounces of shredded extra sharp cheese when I mixed things together . My family can't stop raving about it. This is now a favorite!

I think it's very good but adding veggie of your choice or mixed makes it a well rounded meal.  We did a half bag of frozen veggies and baked it a little longer so it would cook.  Also added more spices because we don't like things plain.  All around good easy meal with plenty left overs

this was yummy in my tummy just the way it was.  Just to let you know I see where you can change this recipe up and add stuff.  But I always try the recipe as is and find out about the basic tastes.  This was fine.  All who ate it, 2 teenage girls, my friend and her husband and I thought it was good just the way it was.

I know some people have complained about reviewing a recipe without making it as is. I did make a few slight changes so I can't say what it would have been like as written. The first time, I added finely chopped red bell pepper, green onions, and 1/2 C shredded cheese. I used about 2 tbsp butter for the crackers and crushed crackers (without butter) over the top to fill in any spaces I missed. I also used about 2 tbsp sour cream instead of a cup and it was absolutely perfect. The second time I decided I could stretch this recipe and make way more. So I used 16oz of egg noodles and about 1/2 cup of sour cream. Both variations were different from each other but both were very good!

LOVE the basics of this recipe!! I'm a big spice and veggie kind of girl so I added a bunch of extras to spice up this awesome recipe!
I doubled the amount of noodles -so 12 oz of noodles not just 6 oz. I added 4 cloves of chopped garlic, oregano, an onion, a chopped green pepper and 2 chopped up carrots. I also did the 1 1/2 cups each kind of soup instead of just 1 cup of each and a splash of milk. I also added an extra 1/2 cup or so of the crackers. With all the extras it needed about 10 more minutes to bake. It was a big hit and can't wait to make it again!

So good!  I used 3 chicken breasts, added some garlic, onion and chicken seasoning.  Next time I will use a little less sour cream and butter and more crackers!  We all loved it.

I can't rate this recipe  "as is" because I added a few extras as recommended by other reviewers. I feel is was a bit bland even after adding 1/2 of a small onion, 3/4 cup milk and about 1/2 tsp. of thyme.  I was concerned about the salt with the soups added so I didn't add any extra. It did need some on the finished dish. Honestly, the best part was the buttery crackers crumbled on top. I probably won't make it again unless I am in a slump with dinner ideas.

I have picky eaters. Two out of three cleared their plates. Odd child out has been eating weird for a few days now. I thought it was tasty enough for me to eat. Although I think it'd be better with the chicken shredded rather than cubed. Will reheat leftovers for lunch tomorrow with cheese as suggested.

Was feeling the need for some comfort food on a snowy day. Tried this recipe and the only change was to add a few cups of broccoli florets (frozen/thawed). 
Wonderful casserole!!!  Will be making this again and again!
Thanks!!!

this was a great start, but definitely needed additions for more flavor. i sauteed 1/2 onion and a few stalks of celery until soft, then added a clove of garlic, grated and dried thyme. finally, 1/2 bag of frozen peas.
just an extra step or 2 and we had a really satisfying and flavorful dinner to add to the rotation!

Very good!  I used penne noodles and I added onion powder.  I didn't use any butter - I just crushed Townhouse crackers over the top.  Next time I will try the french fried onions instead of the crackers.  My picky eaters liked the dish very much!

I made this twice. 3 Star rating is for the recipe as written. With these modifications, I would add another star. First off, I would use less chicken and more noodles. I also added some milk to the cream soups to make more sauce, and a  4 oz can of drained sliced mushrooms. But the #1 suggestion I have for this is to add slices of Swiss Cheese right before the cracker topping! The cheese really set this casserole off! If I had one suggestion, it would be that. Very good with a side of broccoli.

I have made this according to the recipe in stead of using a 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 can of cream of chicken soup I just used 1 hole can of Campbell's cream of chicken and mushroom soup and I also sprinkled some mozzarella cheese on top instead of cracker crumbs or breadcrumbs. I am going to make this again tonight and I'm going to add some  Broccoli and mushrooms in It tonight and for the topping I'm going to use some garlic butter Ritz crackers.

Great recipe!! As others have stated, it is better the next day! Very creamy, and a very satisfying comfort food, type recipe. I also added onion and frozen peas. The addition of any vegetable would only add to this. Just a wonderful base recipe that can be left as it is or added to. Was delicious!! Will make this many more times, that is for sure!

I did not care for this recipe. I read the top rated helpful and critical reviews before trying this. I added sauteed onion, celery, garlic and 1/2cup chicken broth. VERY thick texture, tastes like your eating straight cream of chicken/cream of mushroom soup. It is overpowering. I'm glad others were able to enjoy this but we will NOT be making this again.

Wow, this was great! What an easy meal to put together that tasted delicious! I did do a few things different, just because its a preference. I seasoned chicken, with onion and garlic powder, salt and pepper both sides, and baked it in the oven 325 for 35 minutes ( I have a convection oven, it cooks super fast. Then cubed it up. I added about 2/4 c of whole milk to the soup mixture, just to loosen it up a little, to make spreading easier. I baked it 325 for 30 minutes and it was so delicious! Thank you so much for this recipe!!

As presented it is bland. The second time around I omitted the crackers and butter, then add sharp cheddar cheese about a cup to mix in with noodles & chicken. It is a family favorite.

The whole family LOVED it. Even the VERY picky grandson. I basically followed the recipe as written using Rotini noodles, garlic salt and fresh ground pepper to taste and since I had a lot of leftover chicken I used that instead of poaching. I also added just a sprinkle of garlic and onion powder. Wow this was SO good. Leftovers? As if!

I make this often because the kids love it, but i find it to be bland as written. I would give it five stars with the changes i make....I use one can of brocolli, one of cream of chicken, a can of corn, or any vegetable really....gives it extra flavor!

I loved this recipe. Quick, easy, but oh sooo good.  I didn't have cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom and cream of celery soups.  Also, I didn't have sour cream so used alternative blend of cottage cheese and vinegar.  Also, I didn't have egg noodles so used fettucine noodles instead.  I added Mrs. Dash's green seasoning to the recipe.  Needless to say, it was great.  My whole family enjoyed it including my picky teenager.  Great recipe!!

I've tried it as is, And i've tweaked it a bit.

I cook the cut up chicken in a pan with a little olive oil, parsley, thyme, pepper, salt, adobo (intl isle), maybe a pinch of cayenne pepper (boosts metabolism) and minced garlic, and onions. After chicken is fully cooked, I add a can of mixed vegetables tot he pan along with the cream of mushroom and chicken soups and let cook for about 5 minutes. I cook a bag of RiceSides ($1) Mexican flavour.
After noodles, rice, and chicken are all cooked, I mix together in a baking dish, maybe add a little salt n pepper on top and some shredded cheddar cheese. and bake for 30 minutes to 45. It's fabulous! I completely recommend everyone trying it with a ricesides mixture!! I promise you wont regret it!

I'm eating this right now!  Yummy.  I substituted sour cream for ceasar dressing and I added the holy trinity - onion, celery, carrot - sauted - it's very good.  (And I used Panko instead of buttered crackers).  Lots of flavour.  Thanks.

Great and easy!  I like to use left over Rotisserie chicken and add 1 Tablespoon poppy seeds to chicken mixture (so it's a little more like the poppy seed chicken).  My kids prefer it topped with French's Fried Onions instead of cracker/butter topping.  If it's too bland - serve with Sriracha chili sauce on the side - gives it a great kick!

Fantastic! I must admit, I was a bit skeptical about trying this.... Many reviews warned that this was super bland and in need of many enhancements. Because I was craving a homey meal and had all of the ingredients handy, I dejected the negative comments and decided to give this a try. To my surprise, this was not bland at ALL! Admittedly, I did up the flavor factor by subbing Campbell's cream of chicken & mushroom and cream of chicken with herbs soups for plain 'ol mushroom and chicken soups (all I had). I really think this change made a HUGE difference (and adding a LOT of s&p to taste!). My only other change was using 3 chicken breasts instead of 4 and slightly increasing the amount of egg noodles to compensate. Even my picky casserole-hating husband liked this (wow!)!!! Thanks for sharing this easy, economical recipe with the AR community Dawne! This will be added to my "keeper" file for sure. :-)

I never cooked a casserole before this recipe and I must say that it is absolutely delicious. I read some of the other comments and took some suggestions like adding some onions, celery, and garlic for a little crunchy texture. I also added an extra cup of Ritz crackers to cover the casserole better. For taste, I added onion power, garlic salt, and poultry seasoning  to enhance the ingredients. Added a whole stick of butter to the crackers for a more even crust on top.

I made this exactly as the recipe suggested.  I thought it was a bit too creamy from the two soups.  I also would've maybe added some veggies like peas to it.

It was great! I don't cook often and concerned about it being bland as some said so like many others I added things like onion, garlic & celery, also switched soups from mushroom to celery, a little milk and cheddar, all very good.

This is a great recipe for left over chicken and is especially great to deliver to sick friends or moms with a newborn for dinner.  I do make a few changes...add about 1-1/2 tsp of powdered chicken stock, a TBSP of garlic, about 1/2 finely chopped onion-sautéed, 1 TBSP dried parsley and omit the salt and all the butter and instead mix 1/2 cup cheddar cheese with the crackers and sprinkle those on top.  Also, I use the fat free sour cream and soups, and reduced fat Ritz crackers.  Delish!  Everyone always wants the recipe!

Great base recipe. I read a few reviews and tweaked it as follows: I used leftover roasted chicken, sauteed 1 onion and 3 garlic cloves in butter, then sauteed some sliced mushrooms. Added 1/2 bag of frozen peas and carrots. We really liked this.

Our family doesn't like cream of mushroom - so I substituted with more Cream of Chicken Soup.  I also threw in a handful of French's French Onions.  Delicious!

I made this recipe after reading Mother Ann’s blog about how good this recipe is.  Right, she is!  I tripled this recipe so that I could freeze 2 smaller containers for my in-laws and a friend.  I baked up what I didn’t freeze and when it was done baking; I put it in a crock-pot on the warm setting.  I was taking this to a large Christmas potluck dinner, and this recipe did not disappoint.   It held up very nicely in the crock-pot without getting mushy.  My friend baked it from the frozen state and said it was “wonderful and baked up tasting like she had just made it, fresh”.  I think that is great information to know, as this will make a nice dish to share with someone who has a need for a meal.  To get some veggies in the meal, I steamed some carrots and broccoli and added it to the dish, right before baking.  This was great with the added veggies, but would be just as good without them.  I had an open package of croutons that I used up for the topping rather than the crackers - worked great.   I loved this recipe and know I will be making it again.  I love to have dishes made ahead for a quick meal or for someone in need.  This works fantastic for both occasions.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I was looking for a simple comfort food recipe and this fit the bill! The only change I made was using just a few tablespoons of butter for the topping instead of half a cup to cut calories. I will definitely make this again and possibly substitute tuna or ham for the chicken.

I've made this twice now. Even if you don't have peppers, it doesn't matter. It's amazing. Onions are a must though. Mmmm I put these in a muffin pan as someone else mentioned to portion them out and took them to work for lunch. Mmmm

Boy is this good. And better the next day. I followed the modifications of Pam, March 4 2008, the 2nd "most helpful postive review." I used Herbs de Provence, garlic powder and onion powder to season the chicken, browned it on high heat in butter and olive oil, added chicken stock, scraped up brown bits then cooked the chicken in the stock until cooked through. I think that the Cream of Chicken WITH HERBS makes all of the difference in the world. I decided to top the casserole with butter and stuffing mix. It was heavenly. I had a food hangover the next day and it was totally worth it. Loved it with the modifications. I think it would be a smidgen bland as written.

My Family really enjoyed this recipe.  I did kick up a couple of things.  1st I poached the chicken in chicken stock and seasoned the chicken prior to cooking.  When mixing the soups and sour cream together I added fresh garlic, onion powder, fresh cracked pepper, and season salt.  This added more complex flavor.  Finally I used the Garlic flavored Ritz crackers which really added another layer of flavor to the meal.  Overall, it was delicious and the left overs were just as good.  Enjoy!

After reading other reviews, I was afraid this would be bland, but it is really delicious!  I added some veggies that I had on hand (cauliflower, green beans and carrots), but other than that I followed the recipe as written.  Very creamy and flavorful.

My kids really loved this! It was a simple comfort meal that we will use from now on. The flavors are somewhat bland which is not a bad thing at all if you have kids, but just add extra spices and it will be awesome! Leftovers are good too.

Added sauteed mushrooms and onions to the mix to change it up a little bit.  I would think with just the chicken and noodles it would be a little bland.

Great recipe with some modifications as previous reviewers suggested.  Saute onion and chicken before substituting broth for water to finish the chicken.  Very tasty.

This was so yummy! Quick & Easy to make. The only thing I did to make it even easier was I used Perdue Short Cuts (oven roasted) and cut the strips into cubes instead of boiling boneless chicken. This recipe is a keeper!

The ultimate comfort food!  So simple, but so good!  I didn't even use a whole stick of margarine--just a half stick to mix with the cracker crumbs.  It still turned out fine.  Will be making this alot.

Very yummy! I improved the recipe to my own taste with the following changes: I skipped the sour cream. I added a can of cut green beans and shreddered sharp cheddar cheese on top of chicken mixture, then crumbled crakers with butter on top. My husband at it all in two days!

This was a creamy, delicious meal. I cut the 1/2 cup butter to 4 tablespoons and it was good (fewer calories). My hubby loved this new dish, which makes me happy because it was so easy!

This is a great recipe.....and easy!!!!!!!  The only thing I did differently was use only 3 pieces of boneless chicken and it came out fine.  I was worried about my husband and son not liking it....however, my husband said it was actually good and he will eat the rest for dinner tomorrow.  My 5year did like the noodles but not the chicken...but I didn't expect him to like it period.  Next time I make it I think I will make less since it's just me and my hubby enjoying it.  Other than that, this is a keeper and will definitely be used in the dinner rotation!

It is a very easy dish to make, but was just a little bland as written.  I added vegetables (broc, mushrooms, etc) and that helped.  I assemble over the weekend so it can be popped in the oven for a quick meal during the week.  Thanks for the recipe!

I only add minor things like seasoned my chicken, added chicken broth when I boiled my noodles. I added milk so it won't get dry and mushrooms and red bell pepper. I didn't put the crackers on it because it just sounded like I wouldn't like it. But over all great meal

I cannot give this dish enough stars. It is amazing! I've made it a couple times already for my fiance and I, as well as for a church potluck, and it always disappears quickly! So much yum! (Although I do modify it, but only by boiling the chicken in chicken stock---it sounds weird, but it makes the noodles so flavorful!---solely using canned peas and carrots for the veggies, and adding extra crackers in the topping mix.)

This was so very good! A real comfort food for a chilly day. Easy to make and I didn't change the recipe at all.

I made a few adjustments based on the other reviews here - browned the chicken in butter & olive oil, then cooked it in chicken broth. I added frozen broccoli and some cheddar cheese. This recipe was so delicious. I made it for a little get together, and everyone loved it. I have a feeling I'm going to be making this one a lot.

Loved this recipe.. although, I followed most of the changes (I was afraid of it being bland). I used 2 cans of Campbell's Cream of Chicken w/herbs, 1/2 cup fat free sour cream, a can of peas, a can or corn, 1/2 diced onion & a teaspoon of crushed garlic. I also boiled my noodles in half water & half chicken broth. I threw in a dash of salt & pepper and used a whole sleeve of crushed butter crackers. My kids LOVED it.. a comfort food for sure - perfect on a rainy night :)!

We love this recipe. But I read some of the reviews and added some things to add more flavor. I added 1 1/2 c pictsweet seasoning blend and 1/2 cup parmesan as well as a little garlic powder. It was a huge hit! Something even my pickiest eater ate.

This recipe as written is bland and I would not make it again.  With all of the recommended changes it is a completely different recipe and I like to see reviews that are based on the original recipe.  I did add thyme and frozen mixed veggies and it didn't make a difference.

this is a great meal when you have to feed in great numbers. this is not for those that like contrasting flavors, it is a bit bland. i add chili powder or hot sauce when i make it because it is very plain.

We tried recipes as it and it was a ok.  But next time I think I am going to add some vegetables that might help with the blandness.

This is a very forgiving recipe and a great jumping in place for a quick and easy meal.  I used 7.5 ounces of noodles (how much I had on hand), cream of chicken, cream of onion and the sour cream.  I had 3 large chicken breast halves & I also added a package of frozen chopped broccoli.  In addition to the buttered crackers, I topped this casserole with some French Fried Onions.  This is good comfort food, a great way to use left over chicken & sure to be a big hit with little ones as well!  Thank you for the recipe!

I read many of the reviews, both good & bad.  I also paid close attention to the changes that were made, my result was just "okay".  Not sure if I'll make this again or not.  I browned the chicken first and then added chicken broth to get the pan scraps.  Boiled the noodles in broth/water mix.  Added onion, garlic, salt, pepper, celery seed.  Used only cream of chicken soup (family hates mushrooms).  Used the suggested topping and found that also, just "okay".  I believe small children would love this.

Great Recipe!!  I too followed the advice of some of the other reviewers as I thought it was kind of plain.  I was really pressed for time so I used canned chicken breast since I didn't have any chicken thawed.  I also sauteed onion and garlic and frozen veggies in butter before adding to the sauce mixture.  I didn't have any celery, so I put 1/2 tsp of celery seed.  Added 3/4 cup milk and baked at 325 for about 45 min.  My husband and boys loved it and asked for seconds.  This is a great base recipe. Will definitely put this in the rotation.

First and for most, I am PICKY eater. So i am giving this recipe some slack. I love chicken and noodles! I am a college student, and I am slowly learning how to cook good meals. I loved everything about this recipe except the sour cream! I think I would have enjoyed it much more without it. It took away the traditional taste of chicken and noodles that I love. I am sure others may enjoy it though. I personally would prefer it without the flavor of sour cream. It was very easy to cook though...especially for novice cooks!

This was a great dish! I chose to saute my chicken breasts with 1/2 onion after seasoning with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I removed the chicken and deglazed the pan with a splash of sherry. I added the onion/pan mixture to the soup mix. I then added 1 cup each of carrots and broccoli. I also cut the butter to 1/4 cup. Was asked by everyone who had it for the recipe! Yum!

This was OK, a little on the dry side.  I subbed cream of broccoli for the mushroom soup.  Quick and easy, my toddler and preschooler thought it was OK.

This casserole was good but I made a few changes. I used more noodles than the recipe called for because the soup mixture seemed to drown the noodles and made it too rich. I also thought the cracker butter mixture had a strange taste so ill use bread crumbs next time!

Excellent. I added half a large onion chopped very fine, half a cup of peas, and substituted low fat sour cream and soups instead of the regular ones. I've made it twice, once with the low fat, and once with regular - great both times, but so much healthier the other way. Healthy, and filling. Perfect for a cool day.

I do not understand the rave reviews for this recipe.  Even with some "jazzy" modifications (peas, bell pepper, onion, garlic) it was so bland and boring, not to mention it takes way too long to prep.  With all the condensed soup it just feels so unhealthy also.  I wanted comfort food and I got filler food.  I probably will not make this again.

This casserole was very easy to make and so tasty. I changed it up a bit though. I used 2 cans of chicken breast and I substituted the cream of mushroom soup with cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic. I also added a little chopped sweet onion, some chopped garden tomato and shredded cheddar cheese. Everyone really enjoyed it.  :)

Great base recipe to be creative with. I added broccoli, rotini pasta (instead of egg noodles), mushrooms, garlic & other seasonings. I also used a rotisserie chicken. Can't wait to make it again with different veggies...maybe asparagus. YUM!

This was a hit! I used split chicken breast with bone and also seared the chicken prior to poaching. I added italian seasoning and one chicken bouillion cube to the poaching liquid before i put the pasta in. I will make this again!

This really is the ultimate comfort food!  After reading a few of the reviews that stated it was a bit bland I added some garlic, a can of mushrooms and topped it with parmesan cheese.  So yummy, will definitely make it again

Quick and easy to make, but a little bland. I followed the recipe as written and didn't want to review it after making alternations.

I made this chicken this weekend; it was a huge success! To be fair, I'm a pretty picky eater, so the can of mushroom soup was swapped out for cream of potato. I figured the small potato chunks would give it a little more body, and they definitely did. I also added garlic salt pepper and bouillon to the water when cooking the chicken and then the noodles. Everything was very flavorful and I highly recommend it. It's definitely added to the rotation!

This was a good recipe, although a little dry. I would suggest adding sour cream and any other creamy base that you can place in or on top of this recipe.

My family and I really enjoyed this casserole.  It is very simple to make, too!  The only thing I added was 1 tsp of lemon juice to the soup mixture for a little twist.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  This is definitely a keeper!

This is fantastic.  The only things I did differently was I fried up some onion, celery and garlic and added this to the soup mixture.  I also added a little cheese to the top as well.  This is soo yummy!

My mom made a version of this 25+ years ago when I was growing up. 1 bag no yolk egg noodles, cooked chicken cut up I use 3 large breasts and shred/chunk it (u decide how much, some people like more chicken than others). 2 cans whole mushrooms or saute some fresh ones, 4 cans cream of chicken soup and 2 cans milk. After you boil and drain the noodles return them to the pot. In separate bowl mix the soup and milk well. Add the soup mixture, mushrooms and chicken to the noodles. Pour into roaster or large 9x13. Cover and bake at 350 for 1 hour then uncovered for 15 min. Take out add shredded cheddar cheese and crushed potato chips to the top for and bake for 15 minutes. My friends always begged for more. My mom even created a vegetarian version for my best friend!

I don't eat meat but made this for my husband and daughter and they both really enjoyed it so I'll be using this again for sure. After reading several reviews, and based on my own personal cooking preferences, I made a few changes. I roasted the chicken with a mixture of EVO and herbs to give it flavor and moisture then shredded it instead of dicing. I also sauteed diced onions and peas to add to the noodle mixture. I added sauteed mushrooms at the end to my daughter's because she loves them but my husband does not. I also grated Parmesan cheese on the top before putting the cracker topping.

This recipe is super easy to make as it requires few ingredients.  We add a bit of fresh garlic and garlic salt to the mix.  Leftovers are delicious as well.  This recipe is a total crowd pleaser - I made it for my staff one day and everyone asked for the recipe and about five people made it on their own.  Always a hit!

Made this tonight for the first time.  I would say the prep time is actually longer than 30 minutes.  I saw all the reviews that mentioned it was too bland, but those that added too many other spices didn't seem to like it. Campbells has a Cream of Chicken with Herbs soup and chose to make it with that and I loved it!  I would prefer more noodles and double the crackers for more crunch, but there will definitely be a next time.   Yummy !!  Even my picky daughter ate it all.

Family raved about the recipe.  Because I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, I had to use cream of celery with the cream of chicken.  It still came out delicious.  It is now on the family hit list of favorites to make again real soon.

Easy.  We almost always have chicken breast baked and in the fridge, so this recipe was easy to throw together.  The chicken I had was baked with some Lawery's.  I diced that up.  I boiled my egg noodles in water with some chicken boullion.  I did not put my crushed Club crackers with melted butter, it turned out just fine.  Like I said easy, repeatable.

I also made some of my own changes.  First, instead of boiling the chicken, I pan fried it with olive oil and butter, poultry seasoning, thyme and garlic.  Then I deglazed the pan with a little bit of white wine.  Added the soup to the pan and a can of milk.  I didn't have the egg noodles so, I used thin spaghetti.  I chopped up a head of broccoli (very small pieces) and added that and frozen peas to the mix.  Then I topped with what I had, Cheese crackers and pats of butter.  Extrememly delicious:)

When I was making this I wasn't sure if my boyfriend would really like it, but he loved it and so did I.  Afterwards though we decided next time to add some vegetables to it.  Really good though and he even had the leftovers for lunch the next day and still enjoyed it.

this was delicious, but I could only give it 4 stars as written, because it needed some veggies added for three reasons:  nutrition, flavor and color.  I sauteed onion, celery and carrots and added along with a cup of thawed frozen peas.  Also, to make more healthly i used whole wheat noodles and fat free soup, and I added some reduced fat shredded cheese throughout the dish.  With all the changes, it was really good and the family liked it and the fact that I tried to make less fattening.  Was alot like tuna casserole, but with chicken.

This was amazing!, I changed it up a little bit as per other reviewers suggestions. I cooked the noodles with a little salt, pepper, oregano & thyme. Used chicken thighs cut up into bite sized pieces intead of chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand, and for the sauce I used 2 cans of mushroom soup because I had no chicken, I also added a little powdered chicken base to the sauce as well as some milk, baked it with the crackers and some grated up parmesan. Delicious!. I will definitely make this again!.

I gave this 5 stars with our changes.  I used a rotisserie chicken, added 1/2 bag of frozen veggies, 1/2 small onion sauted with 2 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon of thyme, and 3/4 can of milk per another reviewers recommendation.  Even people who don't care for casseroles will love this one!

Yummy! I ony had 2 chicken breasts dethawed so I used about 1/2 of a large bag of noodles to make up for the missing chicken. I also sauted the chicken in a little bit of butter and added a little bit of salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, onion powder and garlic powder. For the soup mixture I used cream of chicken and cream of broccoli instead of the mushroom. I added a lot of shredded cheddar cheese on top of the casserole and then used 1 1/2 cups of ritz crackers in 4 tbsp of butter. Pretty good base recipe that can be tweaked a million different ways!

Great recipe as is. If your looking for a quicker version with a bit more more flavor try using a already made rotisserie Chicken from a deli. They are juicy with lots of extra flavor. All you have to do is peel of the chicken rather than Poach the raw meat, it saves so much time!

Great recipe that's easy to play up! I added a few simple ingredients; sauted 1/4 cup onions in about 2 tbs butter with 1 tsp dried basil and added 2 c frozen vegetable mix until heated through before adding the cream of chicken. Will surely be making this again and again!

This was great! Only gave it 4 stars because as written, it's pretty bland.  I sauteed my chicken with minced garlic.  I added mozzarella and frozen peas prior to baking.  Garlic powder and parmesan added to the bread crumbs prior to baking made a real difference! As others, I served mine in individual ramekins which the kids loved. Delicious.

Just delicious!  My whole family gobbled it down!  I added 1 cup frozen peas and carrots, thawed to sneak some veggies in for my picky eaters!

I am giving this three stars because I think I must have done something wrong.  Mine was sooo dry that we did not eat very much of it.  I am going to study the other comments and try again.

I found this recipe to be awesome just the way it was written.  The crunchy crackers on top were my favorite.  I will certainly make again!

Nice, simple recipe.  Nothing over the top wonderful but a good comfort food.  I used homemade noodles but that is the only change I made.  I did feel it was too buttery and if I did it again would decrease the butter in the cracker crumble.

I'm a fairly new cook (I use the word "cook" very loosely) and this is the first recipe from here that I've tried. I LOVED it! I didn't change much except for adding some chicken broth to the pot of boiling water and I added celery and carrots for more of a chicken noodle soup vibe. I am definitely making this again!

I made this tonight and it deserves the 5 star rating.   It is an easy recipe put together.  I actually used two chicken breasts and one med sized can of canned chicken breast - I think the recipe would be great just using canned chicken too (and even quicker to prepare).   I took the advice of other raters and added some vegetables.  I sauted onion, carrots and celery until almost soft and added that to the soup mixture.  I used low fat soup and sour cream and skipped the step where you brown the cracker crumbs in butter (i figured the buttery crackers would already be buttery enough and they were).  It was great and although i made some modifcations, i think this would get 4 or 5 stars even if it were prepared just as is.

I cooked this last night per review/instructions of pam.  It was soooooo delicious!  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (we don't like mushrooms) and added more noodles (about 2 cups).  We also only used 3 chicken breasts.  I added chopped up spinach and frozen peas.  I also put the crumbs all over the top.  My husband (who ALWAYS says EVERYTHING is just good) said he really liked this and loved the topping.  Oh and I didn't have egg noddles so I used small shells!  Seriously soooo good.

This was very easy to prepare. My husband and I loved it as well as the kids. I substitued cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom and also added a little milk to moisten it. Very good though!

This was a really good dish. I used leftover baked chicken and bought a chicken broth to cook the noodles in. Because of this i did not have to add any extra salt or pepper because everything was seasoned enough. Very good!!!!

Yummy!!!  My changes:  I used low fat soups and sour cream, and added italian seasoning, used about 8 oz whole wheat noodles, 1 lb. of chicken breast, added 1/2 bag frozen peas and one 10 oz bag frozen mixed mushrooms.  Next time I'll add an additional whole bag of veggies, and cut back on the chicken to about 3/4 lb. Very good recipe!

This was great! After reading other reviews, I changed it up just a bit. I sauteed one white onion, chopped, with 2 cloves fresh garlic. I decided to throw the chicken in with it and cook it quickly since it was chopped up. I didn't have egg noodles but the Farfalle I had on hand was just perfect. I added some shredded cheddar cheese on top and bread crumbs. The whole family liked it, even my very picky kids who never BOTH like any food! Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I thought this was a great recipe. However, not having any chicken and having turkey from Thanksgiving, I used that instead. It was delicious and a good way to use up some of that turkey. Plus, I added a 12 oz bag of mixed veggies to it.

A good recipe, although I have to admit that I changed it quite a bit. First, I used only 2 chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand. I also used a light plain yogurt, because it's a bit healthier than the sour cram. Then I added some spices, oregano, basil, parsley, and black pepper. Vegetables make this dish healthier and SO much tastier: a bag of frozen veggies, and some gently cooked onions and celery make for a good texture and flavor. Lastly, I just used regular breadcrumbs that I made myself. The basic recipe is a clear slate for you to adjust!

This really wasn't that good I was suprised to see all the good reviews for it. I even added some things to it as some reviews suggested its very tasteless & no one in my family wanted it. I will never make this again!

This was really good, but I used 12 oz of noodles with an extra can of cream of chicken soup and about 1 1/2 cups sour cream.  I also added some minced onion and peas.  The cracker topping is especially tasty.  Not a low calorie meal by any means, but yummy!!!!!  :)

very good!  Definately a keeper.  Doubled  the recipe but only used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  Added mixed veggies and chopped onion.  Awesome, great comfort food!

Really good. Mixed in sauteed onions and red pepper. Italian seasoning. Topped with cheese, didn't have crackers. Very good dish:).

Pretty good, just a little bland. Next time, I would season the chicken and it really needs veggies. I will try with a peas/carrots mix.

This is a good "comfort food" dish.  I've made it as is and while good as originally written, I thought it could use a little help in the flavor deparment.  The 2nd time around, instead of Ritz crackers, I used Chicken flavored Stove Top stuffing for the topping.  I also added a large can of mushrooms.  This dish is very tasty for next day leftovers.

This was okay. VERY bland, like others have stated. I even seasoned the chicken. It tasted like a canned food dish. -One of those 'Chicken Helper' meals.

Great for a quick, filling meal! The only thing I changed was adding in some shredded cheese. This is also great topped with stuffing (I used boxed stuffing) in place of the crackers!

Very flavorful!  I made the recipe as written and it was a huge hit with the entire family. This was easy to make, and very filling.  I have a feeling this will become a regular in our house.  Would be so easy to throw in some veges also.

Bland like the others said.  It needs something, but I don't know what.  The boiled chicken has a bad texture in this dish as well.

Made it the same except that I did not add chicken and I used wheat germ for the topping. I boiled the noodles in water with two chicken bouillon cubes. I also used 98% fat free soup and lite sour cream. It's so good and easy!

Delicious! Some Nifty Ideas: You can use just 1 can of cream soup (add about 1/4 cup milk - found this out b/c I only had 1 can).  Add some shredded mozzarella to the goop (I dunno how much, I just tossed in a handful).  I also added fresh minced garlic, garlic salt, pepper, and *paprika*.  Toss in additions you like too - the base is fantastic & very versatile - I think any veggies would work!  No time for chicken? Try tossing in immitation crab meat or even hotdogs, the kids gobbled it up.  LAST TIP: Broil it, watching closely, for about 5 minutes after its done to get a lovely crisp topping

This was good and it used ingredients that I almost always have on hand.  The reason that I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because I think next time I will use seasoned breadcrumbs in place of the cracker crumbs- I thought it was a little bland and I will either use all cream of chicken soup or substitute cream of celery or cream of broccoli for the cream of mushroom- the flavor was a bit funny to me.  With this said, my husband and 3 year old cleaned their plates so no complaints from them!

Soooo good!!!  I followed the recipe except that i used cream of broccoli vs. mushroom.  The first bite threw me off, but only b/c its something different but it is really good!!  Its like a cross between ckn pot pie and ckn noodle soup.  Very good!! Will make more often for my family.

Very tasty. I didn't have Cream of Mushroom soup so I used Cream of Celery. I also added two green onions and I didn't have egg noodles so I used Mostaccioli. I also used wheat Townhouse crackers. It was great. My husband gobbled it up! Thanks for the recipe.

I used lower fat everything and whole wheat egg noodles and this still turned out quite good. Probably due to the reduced fat it was slightly bland even when I tried to spice it up with some garlic salt. I will definitely try again and probably add some sauteed onion and garlic. But it is a great comfort food recipe for a cold winter night. For weight watchers out there, even with the reduced fat, it's about 9-10 points per serving.

This was a very easy and delicious chicken casserole recipe.  There were a few modifications that I made based upon the reviews.    Added frozen veggies, added 1 cup milk.  Used 1/2 cup sour cream instead.  used 1 package of noodles (12 oz).  used 3 chicken breasts.  very hearty meal.  will make again.

One word came to mind with this ... BLAND! Wanted something quick and easy to do with chicken, would have been much better off just eating the poached chicken alone. Two stars because with additions it was atleast edible.

A good solid weeknight meal.  I used the lower fat creamed soups to make it a bit healthier and served steamed green beans on the side.  The kids liked it.

I used reduced sodium soups (as I try to always do).  Added a few more crackers on top, and a dash of garlic powder, omitted salt.    Super easy.  Wow.

Great recipe!!  My kids and husband gobble this up.  I took the advice of other reviews and added two cloves of garlic chopped finely to the soup mixture.  Also added some Thyme.  I cooked this with some biscuts and mash potatoes!!  Very good, thank you!

This was such a simple easy and delicious recipe!  I did modify it slightly to match what I had on hand.  I used 16 oz of egg noodles and did think that a third can of soup might have made it a bit creamier, but we still gobbled it right up.  I did add some sour cream and milk to it though.  We will definitely make this again.  I think it would be really good with some veggies added, but my DH won't eat veggies.

4 stars for the great base.  Needs lots of seasoning though. I used lots of French's onion rings instead of crackers and threw in some green beans and mushrooms.  Like green bean casserole on steroids.  It was excellent!!!

I really liked this casserole but by husband and children weren't big fans. We added about a cup of frozen vegetables which made a big difference.

It was so simple and yummy. I used cream of broccoli and cream of chicken, rotini multi colored noodles. I used what I had.  It was so creamy and good. I like the noodles in this with the cream of broccoli it was nice flavor.

I made it as it and it was delicious!  Reminds me of my mothers!  Next time I think I will add some parm cheese to it and make a white sauce instead of using canned soup.

This is so yummy.  It is such a comfort food.  You must make sure your crackers are buttery for that amazing taste.  Its lovely on a fall or winter night.  The whole family loves this one. Thanks!

This was ok.  I read the other reviews and instead boiling my chicken I cooked it in a skillet and seasoned it with salt and pepper and italian seasoning.  I also used 2 cans of chicken soup since we don't like mushrooms.  I added green beans to the mix for some color and to get my BF to eat some veggies!  ha ha  Next time I'll try and season the sauce a little more.  It just seemed bland.

This was very good and I make it often. I did make only small additions such as sauteed onion, some frozen peas in the noodles while they were at the last few minutes of cooking and skipped the crackers and butter as my kids think they are gross on other recipies.At the very end I sprinkled some shredded cheese and baked untill it melted. Overall a good staple to have on hand.

This is a great base for a chicken noodle casserole. Needs some peas or something green (added 1/2 cup of frozen peas). Browned the chicken with seasonings vs boiling it. Omitted cream of chicken and instead used half a can of cream of mushroom and half a can of cream of onion. Added a cup of shredded colby mix cheese with 1/2 a cup of half and half into the entire mixture. Topped with more shredded cheese and italian bread crumbs (too lazy to make the butter/cracker mixture although I'm sure it's worth it!)Came out SO yummy. And left enough for leftovers for me and the hubby. Thank you Dawne! :-)

Fantastic!  Just made the following mods: added garlic powder/garlic salt to chicken; added zucchini, peas, and fresh mushroom to noodles, which I boiled in the chicken broth; cut butter in half and mixed with Italian bread crumbs since that was all I had.  Served it with Italian bread.  The meal turned out really yummy and I can't wait to have the leftovers!

This turned out great! I boiled the chicken in chicken broth then cooked the noodles in that same broth. I added peas,carrots,celery and onions to the mixture. This made a ton! Delicious!

I had to divide the recipe in 1/2, it would have been to much for just hubby and I so I used only one can of soup.  This was very tasty and I will be making it again. Additions such as veggies and more seasonings will only enhance a very good basic recipe.

This was a great recipe for our family. I only had three chicken breasts, so that was lacking in my dish. Be sure to use amount of chicken called for. It is creamy and has a nice overall flavor. I wouldn't add any extra salt. I think this recipe is a great comfort food. Everyone liked it.

This definitely has potential ... I used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of onion and used crushed herb croutons mixed with melted margarine for the topping. I won't use them again, a bit too much herb seasoning for me. I'll definitely use more cheese next time (I just sprinkled some on top) and use less noodles. But a keeper for sure!

I very rarely make casseroles because it so hard to find one that everyone in my family will like.  I made this on Christmas Eve before church and EVERYONE loved it!  I only subsituted the mushroom soup for cream of celery because the kids don't like mushrooms.  I was so glad to hear them saying "You have got to make this again, Mom!".  It is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe! It was so simple and easy to make, I boiled my chicken and then cut into chunks. I did not have any crackers so i used another's suggestion and topped with a mixture of shake and bake and bread crumbs. DELICOUS!!! I also sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese on top of the bread crumbs. Even the leftovers on this were excellent reheated

If you are a busy parent and want to make a yummy meal for a fussy child, this is an easy recipe.  My son quickly picked up on the cream of mushroom soup.  The next time I made it I used two cans of cream of chicke, added celery salt, onion powder and poultry seasoning.  The buttered ritz crackers on top are a big hit.

Very Yummy and easy.  I added half a bag of thawed mixed veggies and some additional seasoning (thyme, onion, garlic).  Was a big hit with hubby. I may add more cracker topping next time.

I read several pages of reviews before I tried this recipe. Taking the advise of many, I added onion, celery, mushrooms and cheese. The recipe was a disappointment. Given the opportunity of taking left over chicken casserole in my husbands lunch or cold bologna..he chose the bologna. This is not a keeper at my house.

Excellent-this is a favorite recipe at our house for kids and adults. The only change I make is adding a little garlic and black pepper and a sprinkling of cheddar cheese before I add the cracker layer.

I made this tonight for my fiance, his mother, and his grandmother. It turned out really well and 2 out of the 3 of them went back for seconds! In the future I will probably shred the chicken rather than cubing it and will use A LOT less topping.

Very tasty.  But can also be very bland as originally written.  I suggest adding garlic and red pepper flakes, as well as introcing vegetables such as sauteed mushrooms and onions, red bell pepper and corn into recipe.  Overall, very tasty.

This was so good!! The only thing I did different was bake the chicken and then shred it. I also used frozed egg noodles because those are the only kind I like. I decided to make the healthier version by using low fat soups and fat free sour cream. As soon as my husband took a bite he said, "this is a keeper".

I've made this several times now and it always turns out great.  I don't even really make any changes to it, just cook it as is and never have had a failure.  Hubby loves it and always goes back for seconds, and it makes enough for us to have plenty of leftovers for lunches.  This one has made it into our regular rotation.

I made the lower fat version and it was delish! I used whole wheat egg noodles, reduced fat cream of mushroom and reduced fat sour cream. I did read the reviews and added salt and pepper to the chicken and I actually sauteed half of a chopped onion and threw in some garlic and spinach at the very end. I mixed it in with everything else and topped it off with about 1/2 of the ritz crackers and butter. This will feed my family x 2 days! Will be adding this to my recipes.

I decided to make this recipe exactly as is, then "tweak" it to my own taste when I made it again. That won't be necessary, though - it was perfect as is! I like the fact that it is very easy to make, and uses ingredients that are usually kept around my house. I will certainly be making this recipe again!

This is VERY similar to a recipe I already use, only mine calls for some cheese.  Use shredded, Velveeta, cheese soup, Cheeze Whiz, whatever you have.  I also throw in some veggies (carrots, celery, broccoli, mixed, whatever is in the fridge) and a bit of garlic and onion.  I actually forgot the cheese one time and I thought it was bland.

We absolutely LOVE this recipe!  Personally, I love chicken recipes.. so I had to give this a try.  I cooked my chicken a little different though.. in a skillet with a some butter.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Very good dish!

This recipe was good, what I did different was added a package of frozen peas and carrots, I sauteed half a diced onion and clove of garlic and I used bread crumbs instead of the crackers. I think next time I will add mushrooms and do carrots and celery like one of the reviews here suggested. I think that this recipe is good to add whatever you have on hand.

Super taste, really creamy.  I think next time I'll add some extra soup and some milk to make it more saucy.  Great comfort food.

This was a hit with my husband and 7 yr old. I made a few changes and it was yummy. I added peas and carrots, garlic powder and onion powder along with some thyme. I also added to give more flavor a can of chicken gravy along with an extra can of chicken cream soup. I didn't care for the cracker crumbs so may try bread crumbs later.

Although at first I thought this to be little plain, the family went back for seconds and I have eaten the leftovers for lunch. I did add 1Tbsp chicken bouillon granules to the cooking water which added some extra flavour - thank you other reviewers - and I topped first with a layer of sharp cheddar cheese then panko/butter for the top. Indeed a comfy comfort food.

Very good, but maybe a little bland as is.  I already had cooked noodles (thus the reason I tried this recipe) so I cooked three chicken breasts in the microwave with McCormick One-Step Chicken Seasoning (Garlic Herb Chicken Flavor) sprinkled on both sides.  I also sprinkled some of the seasoning, along with some onion powder in the soup mix.  I didn't have buttery crackers, so I used Seasoned Bread Crumbs on top along with some shredded cheddar cheese.  YUM!  My husband and two boys (8 and 3) loved it.  Definately a keeper!

This is a good recipe.  With the following changes I made, this recipe is five stars.  I used 3 chicken breasts instead of four, and I substituted cream of potato soup for the cream of mushroom soup.  I added garlic salt and 1/4 cup of milk to the mixture.  Before I put the cracker crumbs and butter on top, I put about 3/4 cup of shredded cheddar on top.  The whole family liked it; I will definitely make this again.

I'm giving this a 4 because it's good to start with and build on it.
My changes/substitutions: 3 c. of cooked diced chicken.  (I buy frozen bags of diced white meat to save time.)  10 oz. of no-yoke egg noodles.  Instead of the mushroom soup, an equal amount of leftover chicken gravy I had and a sm. can of sliced mushrooms drained.  Like many others, I add veggies - about 1/2 bag of a broccoli/carrot/cauliflower mix.  I added a small jar of pimento well-drained for even more color.  2 stalks of celery - I saved the widest part of each and just sliced the rest into not too skinny U's.  I added it for the color, flavor, and crunch. (Water chestnuts would have added the same crunch - but I was out.) I used fat-free sour cream, and the Healthy Request cream of chicken soup.  I also added about 3/4 c. of shredded, sharp, white cheddar cheese. In addition to the salt and pepper, I added 1 Tbsp. of minced onion.  
I had no "buttery crackers".  Instead, I used 3/4 c. seasoned bread crumbs, 1/4 c. dried parmesan cheese (ie. Kraft)with some paprika and parsley for color.  No BUTTER!  
I increased the baking time to 50 min.  
With all these changes it was a 10!  The colors were gorgeous.  The flavors and textures were good enough to upgrade this to a "company" dish.  This made a very generous 9X13 casserole.  
A good basic recipe that you change to suit your family's preferences and tastes.  For those reasons - it's a keeper.

This was very good and warming. Time saver – use the microwave to melt butter for the crackers.

This is great comfort food.  Whole family ate it!  I increased the amount of noodles.  To prevent dryness, I added some of the liquid that I had cooked the noodles in to soup mixture.  It was moist and tasty.  It's even better as leftovers the next day!

My entire family really likes this and they aren't really fond of casseroles.  It's quick and easy but tastes very rich. I usually add a few cloves of garlic to it as well and sometimes a bit of curry powder too. (I also use the "Healthy Request" soups with low sodium & less fat along with "light" sour cream and only 3 chicken breast halves.) Perfect comfort food!

I only used 3 chicken breasts and that was plenty for this casserole.  I guess is just depends on the size of the chicken.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt (about 3 dashes), added some garlic powder (probably 1-1 1/2 tsp) and also lightly sprinkled some seasoned salt on the cubed chicken before mixing it all together.  This was very yummy.  My husband and I both gave it a 5.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I added a little minced garlic (not the dry kind...the kind in the jar that is in a liquid).  I added this because of the earlier reviews saying it needed something.  This smelled really good cooking.  The kids kept leaning over the rail wanting to know what I was making.  I will definately make this again.  THANKS.

Thanks Dawne for this excellent recipe!  Altered a few things for flavor and nutrition.  Used reduced fat soups and sour cream.  Added cooked portobello mushrooms, sweet vidalia onion, a couple ribs of celery, a generous dash of cayenne, used half bread crumbs and half wheat germ for crumb topping, and cut the butter amount in half.  Both my husband and I loved it!!!  And the leftovers were just as good the next day.  Definitely will be part of my regular rotation.

I have used this recipe many times and it really takes me back to Mom's home cooking.  I chop up a rotissorie chicken from the grocery on Sunday when I do my shopping then this really comes together fast for a weeknight meal after a long day at work.  I leave the recipe as is and love it!

I agree with some earlier posts that this was bland.  Most of it got thrown out.  I cooked according to the recipe which is why I probably didn't like it as I don't care a lot for mushrooms.

This is a great base recipe.  Just add different ingredients to suit your family's taste.  I used this for my left over turkey. I doubled the recipe for my family. For my family I stirred in peas and cheddar chesse. Plus I but a layer of cheese under the cracker topping.

My take on this recipe is that it is a great start!  I, like many others, also added cheddar cheese (about 3 cups), broccoli, milk (about 1/2 cup), and I doubled the amount of noodles used to 12 oz.  I cannot imagine this recipe without the cheese!  My husband also suggested adding peas next time.  I will definately make this again - with the changes.  Also, it makes for great leftovers!

Excellent! I made a few changes.  I added pre-cut broccoli (3/4 cup), and to make it a little healthier I used low-fat sour cream and for the topping I only used 1/8 cup of butter and fewer crackers (a little under a cup.) It was so creamy and fulfilling.  I'd highly suggest it and will be making it again.

I made small adjustments to this to suit our family taste and I really loved it. My hubby was so-so at first, but the next day when he had the leftovers for lunch, he couldn't stop raving and wished he had more, haha! I did add a 1/2 cup to 1 cup of milk and slightly lowered the sour cream, I added in my Victorian Epicure chili garlic sea salt for flavor, I did add the sharp cheddar shredded cheese layer under the topping, yum! I used 1 1/2 cups crushed ritz crackers to 1/2 cup butter for the topping, it was my favorite part! This is rather 'rich' and not low fat, of course! But it's nice to have some 'comfort' food like this once in awhile, after having fish and asparagus all the time! Enjoy! I think this would appeal to children quite a bit...my little guy seemed to enjoy it, my older son did not like the topping (not sure what's wrong with him, lol!)  but enjoyed the rest.

I'm not a big casserole fan but decided to try this anyway.  I was most pleasantly surprised!  Yum!  My husband even liked it enough to take the leftovers to work for lunch.  I did make some changes per reviewer suggestions.  I used 3 chicken breast halves, 8 oz. noodles, 1/2 c. sour cream, 1 1/2 c. crackers, and 1/4 c. butter.  I also added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese under the cracker layer.  I think the cheese makes all the difference.   It turned out great.  Also makes great leftovers.  Thanks!

I have to say I was disappointed with this recipe.  It sounded so good when I read it but after making it;it just wasn't all that I had hoped.  The casserole was bland even though I had put in some seasoning blend and added mushrooms and celery.  The sour cream seemed to somehow overwhelm everything else.  My husband and I ate this without really enjoying it and my kids just picked at their plates and left most of the casserole on them.

Delicious!  Great for dinner and as leftovers.  When poaching the chicken, I used my soup pot and added 4 stalks of sliced celery and 4 sliced carrots, plus about a T of chicken boullion granules.  I boiled an entire 16 oz bag of Amish noodles in this broth after I skimmed out the chicken and veggies.  I also used two cans of cream of mush (healthy request) because that's what I had.  Used light sour cream and mixed in 2 c of reduced fat cheddar to the soup/sour cream combo.  Used garlic salt in place of reg salt.  Used 1/2 c butter and an entire sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers for topping.  This casserole cooked up perfectly--nice and gooey, tasty, and crispy on top.  We all thought it was perfect for a cool, rainy fall evening.  Will certainly make again!

Updated- For even better chicken, cut the breasts into 2 or 3 chunks each and place in a crockpot with seasoning and the two cans of soup. Cook on low for 3-4 hours, then shred and proceed as directed. 

VERY good! The whole family loved it, including our 3 young children. We were curious about the buttered crackers, but after having this dish I wouldn't top a casserole any other way.

We found this recipe very easy to make and I liked not having to precook the egg noodles.  It was very flavourful... maybe a little too flavourful.  I think next time I will reduce the amount of sour cream I use.

This sounded like a great "comfort food" recipe -and it was.  To make it taste more like chicken noodle soup I added about 3/4 c. of carrots and 2 celery stalks which I blanched with the leftover noodle water.  I added about 2 tsp. of salt and some pepper.  Just great!

I planned on following the recipe pretty close to how it was written but failed and it was for the best.  I ended up cooking the chicken breasts and noodles in water that had garlic and herb seasoning (salt less)and onion and herb seasoning (salt less also) added to it.  I think that I had read in the reviews that someone had added sauted carrot and celery which I did too.  It was finley chopped in the food processor, sauted until softened but not mushy and it surprisingly added great flavor.  Also planned on adding a little bit of Velveeta but couldn't find it so I ended up putting way too much Cheddar (about 1 1/2c.) but it made it SOO creamy!  As someone else had mentioned I added about a soup can of milk too.  I did forget the salt and pepper, but it definatly didn't need the salt.  I have a feeling like some had said that leftovers would have been better that then first day, but we had NONE!

Pretty decent BASE for a casserole.  I added more flavor with mushrooms and cheddar cheese and it still could use some work.

We loved this! I left out the salt since I was feeding it to my toddler, then added it to my own after it was finished baking.  I will definitely make it again but will cut down the amount of butter used in the crumb topping. DELICIOUS!

As suggested in other reviews, I tried this one with only the chicken soup.  I don't know what buttery crackers are available in NZ so I used a mixture of fresh bread crumbles and cheese for the topping.  I think that's the bit I liked the best! I found the main noodle mixture a bit bland and lacking just a little something.  Perhaps it's only good when made the original way with the mushroom soup.

This was SO awesome!  We fought over the leftovers!!!

I make this dish when I need to cook a meal for someone just home from the hospital or a new mother...  It's mild and so comforting!

I made this with tuna instead of chicken and it turned out very well...I also added some cheese and replaced the sour cream with a big spoonful of ranch veggie dip since that is what I had!!  I like to experiment...Better than you might expect! I also made it a little healthier by using no-yolks noodles, and 98% fat-free soup. Next time I make it I will crush Doritos on top. I tried it on my leftovers and it is good!

Wow! What a great easy recipe! I was able to use things I already had around the kitchen and it was simple to prepare. I cooked the chicken in the microwave (to save time)and it still turned out great. I also forgot to add the salt and pepper, but I couldn't tell the difference and I added frozen sliced carrots to the pot of noodles as they were cooking. The combination was really good and I'll definately make this again. My husband went on and on about how much he liked it! Thanks for a great dinner!

Talk about great comfort food!  This was so easy to make, and it's fantastic.  I used light sour cream and 98% fat free soups so I wouldn't feel quite so guilty.  It was delicious.  I'll probably use a different method to cook the chicken next time, but I still loved it the first time and will make it again very soon!

This recipe was OK.  I felt it was somewhat tasty but that the cracker topping was too salty and buttery.  I may make this recipe again but, I probably won't.

This was a wonderful dish!  The whole family loved it.  Easy to make and very satisfying.  I used 8 oz. of the noodles and added extra cracker crumbs and made it in a 13 X 9 pan.  Thanks Dawne! I know this will become a family favorite.

This recipe was a little bland for my taste, but my husband loved it! Instead of poaching the chicken, I slow cooked chicken breasts all day. Then I removed the bones and skin, and chopped up the chicken (it was soo moist and nearly fell apart anyway). He raved about how tender it was. Made A LOT of servings- nearly 4 days for the two of us. It's a lot like tuna noodle casserole.

This was great, Dawne.  The whole clan loved it.  I used about 3/4 of a bag of egg noodles which proved to be a bit much.  Less egg noodles would have made the dish creamier.  Next time I'll use half a bag of egg noodles and make some dinner rolls on the side for mopping up the sauce.  Very flavourful and filling!  Thanks!

My family didn't like this very much.  I thought it was fine - very easy to make and simple tasting.  The kids thought it was too creamy and didn't care for the extra buttery crackers on top.  Not bad, but I'll probably not make it again.

My girls really liked this recipe. I used leftover chicken. Boiled the noodles with a chicken broth cube. I added some chopped onions. After this baked, I went ahead and added the cheese on top. It is very creamy. Don't add any salt if you use a chicken cube to boil in with the noodles. This even tasted great for lunch the next day. Next time I make it, I will double it and freeze one without the cracker topping.

To jazz this up a little, try adding a bit of curry powder. I also added a bit of minced onion. The added flavors were subtle but gave it the oomph I think it needed. A keeper recipe for sure. I made a double batch and took one to a friend.

Great recipe for using left-over chicken from the crock-pot or rotisserie. My finicky kids loved it. We used 16 oz of noodles and doubled the remaining ingredients, then baked it in a 9x13 pan. We also added one jar of sliced mushrooms. It was great. The recipe didn't indicate to do so, but I cooked the noodles first. Not sure if that was necessary, but it certainly didn't seem to negatively affect the end result! A keeper for our family.

Substitued breadcrumbs for the crackers & butter, and used low-fat soups & fat-free sour cream. Tasted like a chicken stroganoff; good comfort food.

I enjoyed the recipe and mixed in some cheese, asparagus and extra topping which was a nice touch. However, my boyfriend and I thought something was missing from the sauce. I added salt & pepper and it was still a little bland. Any suggestions on how to give this recipe a bit more umf?

I thought this was excellent, thought the kids would love it, too but they weren't crazy about it(wish I knew why!)  I started by cooking the boneless chicken breasts in the pressure cooker, made it really tender, also I used the store bought frozen egg noodles(just like you find in restaurants)and mixed cheez-its and ritz crackers for the top, awesome!!!(p.s. you can add a little milk to make it creamier)

Quick, creamy, tasty and easy!  I substituted half a cup of breadcrumbs for the crackers and it came out great.  Also, I used 5 cups of egg noodles and wasn't sure how many ounces that equaled and it came out great.  I bet it would be good with broccoli or asparagus.

I loved this recipe!  Kids loved it-the buttery cracker topping makes it delicious, I didn't add cheese but i think i might next time. I used the Ramen frozen egg noodles, these noodles taste more like dumplings-turned out great!

Very good!  I used the egg dumpling type noodles and it worked out very well.  The sour cream gives it a rich flavor. My husband, my mother and I all gave this recipe 5 cards!

For my first attempt at making this I doubles the recipe, and pretty much stuck to the ingredients list based on scale.  I did add mushrooms, and I did not add any crumb mixture on top because we like  those browned tips of noodle goodness.  I also added celery.  For me next attempt, I will add a little white wine for liquid, and lessen the amount of chicken a bit while increasing the amount of egg noodles.

This is a great base recipe for those who don't want extra seasonings or spice. It is perfect to make when my little grandbabies are visiting. That being said, when it's just me and hubby I used 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of poblano soup, added 1/2 a bag of mixed veggies (carrots, corn and peas) and seasoned it to our liking heavy handed with thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper. I topped it with shredded jalapeno and monterrey jack cheese and seasoned fried onions. Super yummy! Thank you for a great recipe.

Needed a little more creaminess. I added frozen peas which made it colorful, added texture and extra yumminess.

I used 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup (no mushroon soup), 1 cup of Hellmans instead of sour cream, and I added sauted mushrooms, onions, celery and frozen peas, way better this way. I use this same formula forTuna Casserole also.

I'm not the type of person to be going willy nilly on a recipe and deviating. 99.9% of the time it ends up horrible. This recipe turned out amazing and I plan to use this BASE recipe for SO many other casserole options! 

 After reading other reviews I made this last night and turned it into a broccoli and cheese chicken noodle casserole. 

 I cooked my chicken in the instapot because I'm too lazy to thaw chicken and it leaves a nice broth to add to the noodle water.  I used cream of broccoli and cheese soup/ cream of chicken, added milk, frozen broccoli florets, cheddar, and parmesan cheeses, celery, onion, garlic powder, a TINY HINT of cayenne. DELICIOUS!!!

I made this when my daughter had some friends over. Here are the reviews of 11 year olds. 1- rated it a 4, 1- rated it a 5, my daughter gave it a 2 said it was very bland added more salt and liked it a little better, 16 year old son said it smelled like dog feces and rated it a 2 but said it wasn’t bad. I rate it a 4. I really liked it other than it was really bland. Once you add more salt and pepper it did get better.

Kids gave it a 9 out of 10.  Already had cooked chicken, so I cooked egg noodles (more than 6 oz....approx 8-10oz) in chicken/beef broth.  Stirred all together and added powdered onion and garlic.  Easy and delicious.

I’ve made this recipe for my husband and I and loved it. I thought I’d try it for our family get together. My son-in-law, my 15 year old grandson and my 9 yr old granddaughter are fairly picky with what they eat. Everyone went up for seconds. I added a small can of drained mushrooms, a can of peas and a can of sweet corn when I made it  for my husband and I, but my grandkids they just wanted mushrooms. It’s great with chicken or left-over turkey. Best I’ve had...

It's the perfect warm fuzzy meal!  Brings me back to my childhood.

The recipe may look bland to more sophisticated palates, it's a good basic meal and will satisfy children as well as adults.

I would say this is between "Ok" and "I liked it." It is bland but a good starter and you can add to it. I made it as-is except 4 chicken breasts was too much. I used about 3 (could have just used 2). That was all I changed. Could do without the sour cream but it does add a little kick. Very similar to a recipe I and my mother have used over the years, with the same name, just never used sour cream and the topping was either potato chips or just bread crumbs.

This may become my very favorite.
I added roasted red peppers and used grilled chicken.

This was what I had been looking for. No way it could be bland as some said for you taste the creamy soup and sour cream. Thus nothing needed to change it but because I cook for a very old mom I added frozen carrots and peas, fresh celrary and added half a can of milk to make sure what I added did not keep it from being juicy. I had no mushroom soup so used two cans of cream of chicken. We all loved it. Thank you so much for the recipe. Five stars as it did not need my changes.

My wife made this for dinner last night and we loved it. 
We may try adding mixed vegetables next time. Possibly fried onions on top. 
It's definitely going in the to make again file.

I made this recipe for work, so I tripled the recipe. I used between 5 to 6lbs of tenderloins.  I had no complaints about it being bland.  It was extremely flavorful and everyone at home and work liked it.

This was delicious, but I like many others added to it. I added broccoli, cheese and milk to the cream of soup mixture. Also I didn't see the need to add melted  butter to the cracker crumbs, I tried it and  it seemed to just make them a big soggy mess. I just ended up putting them on top dry and it was prefect, will def be making this again!

This went over really well at our house. Next time I think I’ll throw in some frozen peas just to get a veggie in there. I read a lot of comments on here saying it was bland, which was fine with me, because my kids (4 &6) are super picky eaters, but it honestly was nicely flavored in my opinion. Not too bland for our house.

As written the recipe is very bland.  The sauce is way too thick and there is very little flavor.  I tweaked it and luckily it came out pretty tasty!  After cooking the chicken breasts I cooked 16 ounces of medium egg noodles (one package).  I had to add about one cup of skim milk and one cup of water to the soups and the light sour cream to thin the sauce.  As far as the spices go, I added about one teaspoon of thyme, one teaspoon of diced garlic, one tablespoon of dried parsley flakes, 1-2 teaspoons garlic salt, salt and pepper to taste.  I diced about 4 stalks of celery and 1/2 red pepper and then I sautéed the celery and red pepper together before adding to the mixture.  I also added a can of drained mushrooms.  As far as the topping goes I crumbled twice as many crackers (2 cups) and mixed it with 1/2 cup butter.  This made one 9 x 13 pan and another smaller pan.

I added parmesan to the cracker mixture before putting in the casserole. Also used half the butter for the cracker mixture. 
Did not have a 2nd can of cream soup, used half the liquid from chicken noodle soup for some extra flavor. I used rotisserie chicken to save time.
Very, yum and pretty quick for a night with kids activities

This recipe was great!  I did alter it some. I have read a few reviewers that are unhappy with changing up a recipe but I always revise recipes to my liking.

I was making for just my husband and myself so I only used two chicken breasts.  I sautéed the chicken with fresh mushrooms, celery and onion.  I added garlic powder, fresh ground pepper and seasoned salt. I wanted more veggies so I added a small bag of mixed frozen vegetables to it as well.

I only added about 1/2 c sour cream and didn't have the butter crackers so I used 1/2 c of plain bread crumbs with a few tablespoons of butter.  I wanted to cut back on calories so didn't want to use all that sour cream and melted butter.

Thanks for sharing this recipe, Dawn!

Comfort food! This is very yummy as is and is also great as a base to add veggies. Was afraid it would be too thick so I added some of the chicken broth. I’m can see getting up in the middle of night to snack on. Definitely not health food but yummy!

Obviously this recipe is so versatile that you can add almost anything you want to it.  

Thank you Dawn for such a great tasting recipe.  I added onion to it, only b/c I LOVE onions.  Besides that, very tasty, wonderful for leftovers and I froze it into portions that I thaw and take to work to heat up and it tastes just like it did when I first made it!!!  AMAZING - Thank you again, Dawn!

This basic dinner casserole is great!  Sorry to the review purists but this is exactly the kind of recipe I enjoy... one that offers a foundation on which to build.  I enjoyed reading what others had done to tweak the ingredients to their liking.  I did the same, using rotisserie chicken and adding chopped broccoli and some milk.   I think the beauty of a casserole such as this is its versatility.

Hubby came in the door tired and hungry.  He was soon raving about how good this casserole was and to be sure to make it again (I will!).  He had seconds and took leftovers to work for lunch.

Many thanks to the original poster for providing some much needed inspiration for a satisfying weeknight supper!

Made it just as the recipe listed.  It was ok, not very tasty and rather thick and dried out.  Will only make this again if I  change it up quite a bit:  mushrooms,  peas, Worcestershire,  a little milk, etc.  Otherwise it's  not worth making again.

I have used an almost identical recipe for several years. My recipe calls for 1 T. of poppy seeds and it's called Poppy Seed Chicken. I also use 2 tubes of Ritz crackers with melted butter and serve it over noodles. It's a famly favorite!

I made it just like the recipe said and it turned out OK. It was good but not great. I feel like it was missing something to give it a little  more flavor.

I added chopped  onion, and served with green beans. Recipe needs to have onion added.  It turned out great! I think I've made something like this before. Hubby home, so it's time to EAT! It's  kind of like beef stroganoff, but with chicken...

I used 4 cups cut up rotisserie chicken & 12 oz cooked noodles. Instead of the sour cream, I used plain yogurt which I had on hand. I also added perhaps just over a cup of chicken broth to the mixture before putting it into the oven. Oh my, this is good! A real keeper.

This will be a staple recipe in my home now. So good =)

I baked the chicken with some simple spices, and then cut the chicken into bite sized pieces. I used extra crackers for my kids and it was so good.

I loved this dish because it was not only tasty, but simplistic as well as economical. Since cheese was one of the suggestions at the end, I just topped shredded cheddar cheese over the buttered crumbled crackers prior to baking. Great served with string beans & dinner rolls.

So yummy, hubby who is not a fan of casseroles, loved it. I decreased recipe to 4 servings and used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 2/3 sour cream (didn't have any cream of mushroom), only used one chicken breast,  substituted panko bread crumbs for crackers, and added a cup or so of fresh baby spinach for veggie. Next time, (my husband's suggestion) will add fresh mushrooms.  Definitely will make again.

I am not here to bash the cook, the recipe nor the people who love it. I have not made this, but I have had a form of this if not the exact from my mom as a child. I am sure it is yummy & I probably will make it someday if I am in a hurry and use canned soups.

I just want help in finding a recipe that does not use canned soup. I want to go back to before all the companies began making easy food which usually contained garbage ingredients. By garbage, I mean chemicals to preserve the foods so they can last forever. 

I am not good at throwing things together and making a delicious meal. I need recipes to follow. So if anyone has their grandma's old recipes before canned soups...please let me know. My grandma has passed sadly, so has my mom. So I have no one to go too! Thanks all.

Some of the amounts in this recipe are wrong for me. I used a 12 ounce bag of noodles and a whole sleeve of crushed crackers for that amount of butter for topping. Also, I added some sautéed onion and celery, and a can of VegAll, liquid drained. It's a good recipe in that you can add whatever vegetables, mushrooms, water chestnuts, seasonings, as you like. You can change up the soups as well, I use a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of  chicken. All that being said, I guess I'm saying this is more of a base recipe to create as you desire. One more thing: Why wouldn't you mix the chicken and noodles to the soups/sour cream mixture BEFORE you pour it into the casserole, as the recipe says. The video mixes it all in the baking dish, that makes no sense.

This dish was a hit! Easy enough to make and a nice warm meal for that chilly night. Leftovers were even a hit.

I'm not sure how the others thought this was so good, but to me it was so bland, it was like "hospital" food.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it wasn't at all tasty - nothing at all.  It might be better if you added fresh celery and onions, but as it is, I wouldn't make it again.

I add 1-2 cups mixed veggies or corn to this casserole to make it a one dish complete meal. You should also try the veggie flavored crackers for extra flavorin topping. My family loves this recipe!!

A little bland as it is, yes.  Just remember some people must have theirs virtually salt-free based on health concerns.  So if your sodium is lower than 1500 for the day make it with added veggies like peas that id canned are in a brine or add garlic and celery or milk.  Otherwise, add salt at the table.

My family loved this recipe.  The only change I made was that I added 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan cheese to the soup mixture (I saw this in  another recipe when I was searching).  I would definitely recommend this.  Delicious!

Made the recipe as is but... * Added 50% more egg noodles* Cooked it in a 9x11 casserole dish* Threw some broccoli into egg noodles for the last three minutes of boiling*Added extra cracker topping (same amount of butter, though)*Extended cooking time.  Yes, it’s a basic recipe but family loved it!  Would add more broccoli next time!

We used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup -  no mushroom soup. We bought a rotisserie chicken and used that. We topped it with bread crumbs. It was great!

We enjoyed this and we'll have the leftovers tonight. It could have used some milk added to it to make it more creamy, so I'll do that tonight. After reading the reviews, I added a bunch of extra seasoning to the soup mix. We used 3 chicken breasts, which may have been  too much. I can't imagine what 4 breasts would be like? And we shredded our chicken. Also, we used a 9x13 as there is  no way this would have fit into an 8x8.

I incorporated a few of the suggestions made by other reviewers (garlic, onion, frozen vegetables, browning the chicken rather than poaching, adding cheddar cheese to the cracker topping). It was fantastic. And I am giving it 5 stars with these changes because, frankly, if the recipe had only had 3 stars, I probably wouldn't have tried it in the first place.

Good "left over" recipe from roasting a whole chicken in my instant pot. You can mix the light and dark left over meat and add ingredients as suggested in the comments. (Peas, celery, carrots, onions, bread crumbs and spices like garlic and paprika). Great comfort food on a cold evening.

I made this for my husband per the recipe. (I am gluten-free so can't judge.) He  says it's good, but it could use some tweaking next time. I don't change a recipe until I make as the recipe is written. I will add some celery  and milk next time as suggested, and maybe some  veggies. Good basic recipe though.

The recipe as written is bland. I cut the chicken into bite sized cubes and sautéed it with butter, onions, garlic and mixed veggies. I also added some milk because it looked too dry. The way I made it was pretty good, the way it’s written seems bland as heck.

This is a very quick and easy recipe, but like many others wrote, it lacks flavor as written. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning and cooked them in an oven-safe skillet. After they had cooked, I deglazed the pan with chicken broth and then added chopped garlic and shallots. After the garlic and shallots had cooked and the broth reduced, I added the soups and sour cream to the pan. I then mixed in the noodles and chicken. I used French fried onions for topping instead of the crackers and baked the casserole it in the skillet. We liked the flavor the garlic, shallots and onion topping added, but the cream of mushroom soup seemed too detract from it. Next time I think I’ll try cream of onion or cream of celery in its place.

This was exceptional.. I followed the recipe like I would any others with soup condensed but i make my own homeade condensed soup with chicken broth either homeade or organic in a carton like Imagine chicken stock and i add my herbs like I would for soup  onion powder, salt pepper , in the chicken broth heat it up poultry seasoning sage, garlic salt, and garlic and pepper dried herbs a couple shakes of each and  bring it to a boil and then add cornstarch mixed up with water til it thickens  ltake it off burner let it cool and i make enough for 2 condensed cans of soup Which I made3 cups of chicken broth to add up to those oz. Then I did the casserole as described except I addede sharp shreeded cheddar on topof the chicken and noodes and also added 1 cup to the chicken and soup and sour cream misture then I put the cracker crumbs and melted butter on top then shook some bread crumbs on top of that   iTs a definite keeper Not bland at all Actually very tasty I will make again and play around with colby jack cheese or white sharp cheddar see how they go But this way was simply fabulous. Thankyou for a top of the line easy recipe

I had some left over turkey so I decided to try this and made it with macaroni pasta.  Since others said it was bland as is, I did add maybe a 1/2 to 1 tsp of cumin and oregano, although I didn't measure either, just sprinkled them in.  I also added some fresh mushrooms that I had sauteed in olive oil, butter and garlic salt and pepper.  After  putting it into a glass cake pan, I topped it with shredded colby/monterey jack cheese and then the crackers/butter topping.  It was very good and my husband said this is a keeper!

It’s a good base recipe.  I did modify it a bit.  I didn’t poach the chicken as called for.  Instead, I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and sautéed them in butter and vegetable oil (about a tablespoon each) along with 1 diced onion and 2 cloves minced garlic.  I browned them slightly.  

I also added about 3 c broccoli florets.  I added them to the boiling egg noodles for the last 2 min to blanch them and soften them a bit.  I increased the egg noodles to 9 oz, and added 3 chicken bouillon cubes to the water I boiled them in.

And finally I cut the butter for the cracker crumbs by one Tbs, it was just a bit too much using a 1/2c.

Loved it, as is.  Hubby really liked the buttery crackers on top.  When I make it again, I'll probably cook the chicken and noodles at the same time to save some time.

Yum.  Very good recipe.  The only thing I did different is add some carrots and celery to the water when poaching the chicken.  The buttery cracker topping is awesome!  Will definitely be making this again.

Rating this as written- but, including the modifications I made. And, as written, this is extremely BLAND. The size of chicken breasts should be included- four, 1lb breasts is WAY too much! But, using four 1/2 lb  breasts is perfect. I think the noodle quantity should also be about 8 oz, instead of 6. Plus, there is 0 flavor only seasoning with salt & pepper to taste. This is a good base- but lacks a LOT. I ended up using two 1lb chicken breasts. Cut them into small, bite-size pieces prior to boiling so as not having to handle hot chicken cubing after cooking. Added another 2oz of noodles for 8oz, total. Then, also used 1 can cream of chicken soup & 1 can cream of celery (not a mushroom fan). I then mixed in 1 package of frozen, mixed vegetables (about 16 oz) and also 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Along with salt & pepper- I added in minced onion, garlic & a generous shake of Adobo seasoning. Instead of topping with crushed crackers, I used crushed cornflakes with a light spritz of vegetable oil for a much lighter & crispy topping. The consistency came out near perfect, and it was a flavorful, well-rounded dish with the modifications! 
I would not suggest making this as-written. It may be a "comfort" food with the simple, basic ingredients- but is extremely lacking & completely bland in flavor. I am surprised this has such a high rating & agree with other reviews there needs to be some significant modifications, such as the ones mentioned I adapted from prior reviews.

GREAT   EASY   DELICIOUS   Chicken dish!
Doubled chicken
I did  ADD:  Green beans & Mushrooms (diced onion next time)
Didn't add the crunchy topping, used cheese instead.
Finding Organic Creamed soups has changed my life... No headaches & sleep loss!!!

One of my family's new favorites.  The second time I made it, I made a few changes.  I doubled the noodles, doubled the crackers, used Healthy Request condensed soup, used lowfat sour cream, and added garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne.  My husband is very picky, but he loved it.

Best I csn say about this is that it might have potential. Lots of other reviewers thought it "had potential too, as seen by the multi tweeks to EACH review.. Some Tips. If you choose to add dried thyme, use thyme LEAVES, not GROUND thyme. Thyme is great, but just 1 pinch too much and the dish is ruined. 2) IF you want to poach the chicken( I personally would not) then at least  make a quick poaching liquid. Recipes for poaching  broth abound.  3) Season and roast or saute the chicken is far better! 
Soups: 2 cans of cream of chicken is much better, than 1 of each mushroom & chicken. Add some seasoning  to the soups; such as pinch or 2 garlic powder, thyme  etc. A splash of milk, if you like..but just enough to rinse out cans. Fresh veggies like sauted onion, carrot and celery sauteed.  Basically, almost rewrite the recipe. Or check other versions here .
One parting idea, If you thought that multiple tweeks were needed to make this good, then why rate it as a 5 star recipe?  I do like to see variations..this recipe needs an overhaul.

It came out great, did some changes!  I fried the chicken filet and I added a bag of Mozzarella cheese and also a cup of Parmesan and garlic sauce.  It gave it an extra flavor to it!!!!

Easy to make. I cooked the chicken in the soup mix in a slow cooker first. Combined the other ingredients with the addition of an a sweet onion. (A Southern boy has to have a granex onion!) Good recipe. 5 stars all the way!

I used canned chicken and added the water from the canned chicken to the water I used to cook the noodles. I also didn't have any Ritz crackers so I used the same amount of crushed cornflakes as the recipe called for. Delicious.

I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of chili pepper powder to it and it tasted great. I'll also be shredding the chicken next time around for texture purposes. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was it a hit with my husband. He isn't a fan of mushrooms but he didn't seem seem to care. I did add some peas to this along with adjusting the butter for the cracker crumb topping to using only a 1/4 cup. I covered with aluminum foil for 20 minutes and then removed the foil for the last 10 minutes. Turned out so well my husband said he didn't even need to add cheese.

I think you should at least slice some carrots and onions and add those and frozen peas to up the nutrition in this.

I made it but I made it for 4.  I had to use 1 soup so I used mushroom/garlic, and the sour cream adding some of the chicken & noodle broth.  I added frozen mixed veggies too.  I love the recipe and being able to adjust it easily!  Thanks for putting it together.

After adjusting to make it more flavorful it turned out great. I can consider this a good basic recipe, but as is, it just didn't have any flavor.
I added some of the pasta/chicken water and 1/4+ heavy cream to thin soup mixture out a little.
I added sauteed celery and some broccoli and Lawry's seasoned salt and garlic powder. Again, as a basic recipe to tweek to your family's tastes, this is really good.

Very flavorful!  I used a boned and skinned rotisserie chicken (used about 1/2 of meat), added 1/2 cup chopped kale, 1/2 cup chopped carrots, 1/2 cup chopped celery and 1/2 cup chopped onion...sauteed all this first, added cooked noodles, sauce and chicken. Baked with buttered cracker crumbs--family loved it!

Very good. I cooked the chicken in the crockpot (for about 3hours on high) with poultry seasoning, salt, pepper, and covered in chicken broth. Then shredded it and put it back in the juices to soak up more flavor. Also added more seasoning to the soup/sour cream mix (garlic powder, onion power, more salt/Pepper). Turned out delicious.

This is a phenomenal base recipe.  Add to your taste desires... Garlic and onion (added while the chicken cooking) is a given for this household.  I  only added that plus a 1/2 cup mozzarella, but I can see where you can go in so many other ways with this recipe.  Add cheese? Mozzerrella, cheddar, or..... ??    Veggies? Broccolli would be a nice addition. Or how about the traditional noodle casserole veggie: Celery.  Don't forget the other seasonings.  The list goes on and on.  Add your own "go to" ingredients.  You cannot go wrong with this base.

I disagree with those that just want the recipe to be rated as written without any additional suggestions or extra add-ons.  I find the reviews that add things to zip it up to be extremely helpful.   I mean several posters said that the recipe is bland so why wouldn't you like some helpful suggestions to improve on the recipe?

I halved the recipe for two and used cream of chicken soup.
It is very creamy and satisfying.
Usually I prefer not to use canned soups, but it was good.

Had this for the first time years ago when a friend made it for us after our oldest child was born. It immediately entered our regular rotation. I've messed with the recipe from time to time (sometimes on purpose, sometimes not). But really, the basic recipe is awesome. Just do it. One of our family's favorite casseroles ever. Maybe actual favorite.

It was kind of bland and too much sauce(soup and sour cream). Next time I would cut way back on the soup and sour cream.

This was a bland dish. I even added shredded cheese to it and it wasn't enough to help. My favorite part was the buttery cracker topping, I would use that again! I might try this dish one more time but change chicken soup to cheese soup and mushroom soup to celery soup and add a chopped up onion. I would also not boil the noodles so much, it left them very al dentate but they still where too soft in the casserole. It might be better with a lot of tweaking. Think potato casserole!

This is delicious. Basically a tuna noodle casserole, with chicken. I made double the egg noodles (because I didn't want an open bag in my pantry), and there seemed to be enough condensed soup to go around. My husband and I also fake healthy for our kiddo (don't worry, we  eat cake when she goes to sleep) - so I added about 1/2 cup frozen peas and 1/2 cup chopped mushrooms - they were great additions. This will definitely get added to the normal rotation.

I really enjoyed this recipe and how easy it was to make- great comfort food!  The only thing I found I needed more of was some spicing as it is very bland.  I used a moderate amount of black pepper and then I placed bullion grains in the soup mixture.  Easy to do if you want more taste but a good recipe in and of itself.

This recipe gave me the start but after reading the other reviews I did add ingredients.  I sautéed a small onion, diced, three ribs of celery, diced and one garlic clove.  I will definitely make it again.

I made it using all of Steve Whiting's recommendations and it was delicious.  Everyone loved it.  I didn't have thyme so replaced it with poultry seasoning and used 12 oz of egg noodles.  Also did 1 1/2  amount of cracker topping which was a more appropriate amount for the size of the casserole (bit more crackers than butter ratio since it was a bit too greasy at current measurements).

Giving 4 stars for recipe as is, but after adding just 2 ingredients I would rate it 5 stars and will definitely make again. The only changes I made were to add about 1 1/2C chopped broccoli and about 1/2 C shredded cheddar cheese. In the future, I think instead of using chicken breasts, I will just use the meat from a fully cooked, roasted chicken for cost and time saving measures.

As written, I liked it EVEN though it was bland.....SO.....I doctored it and my recipe made it a 5 star recipe!!! I had to add spices like poultry seasoning, garlic, 17 herb seasoning and 2 shakes of thyme. I also had to add a can of chicken broth (my chicken was a rotisserie chicken) because the mixture was hard to stir so I knew it would be dry! Then I took a box of Stove Top stuffing mix and mixed in with the butter..........waaay better! My amount of chicken and noodles (I used a whole bag not 6 oz) filled 2 9x9 glass pans. And I did not cook as long since everything really was already cooked....maybe 20 minutes!!!

I made this recipe as is,  except I doubled it for the size of my family.  Everyone loved it.  However,  the kids would like a different topping. I think I would really like to add the broccoli to it.  You really have to make it as is in odd to figure out how you would personalize it.

Wonderful comfort food. I use Panko breadcrumbs on top instead of crackers and sprayed with butter flavored cooking oil to reduce fat. I did use 2 tablespoons of butter to  sauté 1/2 cup of onions and 1 cup of fresh mushrooms.  Also added 1 cup of frozen baby peas  for color and flavor. We loved this!

This is delicious and not complicated. I used 8 oz. of medium egg noodles. I also added 8 oz. of sliced fresh mushrooms to the soup mixture before adding the chicken and noodles. I seasoned with a little garlic powder and paprika in addition to salt and pepper.

If you use rotisserie chicken it adds flavor. I use them for all chicken recipes.

This comes out nice and creamy. It makes excellent leftovers. It is a little salty though.

This was another great starter recipe. I added a few vegetables and sauteed my chicken breasts instead of boiling them. For the crackers, I used ritz and crushed the "row" in the casing.  Came out to the perfect amount to use as a topping with the butter. . Now, I don't have to measure again. one row..perfect.  :0) thank you for this post. I will be using this basic recipe again for sure.

Simply the best comfort food!  Perfect if you need to leave a casserole for someone who is  too busy to worry about cooking. I make it for large casual gatherings with a salad. It disappears COMPLETELY!

Tried this recipe last night using some leftover roasted chicken, and it was great! It's a great "make-it-your-own" kind of recipe, particularly for the holidays when you have lots of leftovers and extra people to feed. Will most definitely be making this again!

I made this several years ago exactly as directed, and it was a flop.  I decided to revisit it by making a few alterations of my own and it turned out orders of magnitude better, and I think I know how I'll improve my results even further next time.  Changes to the recipe included cutting down on the amount of chicken by half.   To cut down on cooking time, I sliced the small to medium sized breasts into thin 1/4" thick by 1" wide pieces and simmered the slices for 1 and a 1/2 minutes, and they came out perfectly tender.  I increased the amount of pasta to 8 ounces and I boiled it along with a small bag of frozen carrots, peas, green beans and corn until the pasta was al dente.   For the cream sauce component, I followed directions but then added a conservative dusting of garlic powder (maybe 1/3 teaspoon?  just add enough until you can tell that it's there, but it's not pronounced), extra pepper, 4 ounces of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and a full cup of 2% milk.   I wasn't interested in adding a full stick of butter to this already rich dish, so we bought kettle cooked potato chips and crushed those, sprinkling them on top and baked the casserole in a 9x13" dish at 350F for 40 minutes.  You'll know when it's ready to come out of the oven when the center of the casserole is steaming hot.  The next time I make this, I plan on adding two stalks of celery diced and 1/2 of a medium onion minced in two tablespoons of butter until tender to the mixture.  I think those would be g

I made a few modest changes. I used leftover rotisserie chicken (2 cups) and added about 1/2 cup each of chopped onions and celery which I sautéed with the leftover chicken. Easy and very good.

I am appreciating the original recipe, I made  it  my own, knowing those I love, by adding Italian style herbs, frozen peas and fresh sliced cremini/crimini mushrooms and, of course, a big load of garlic, served with garlic cheddar biscuits.  Enough for three and made an extra mini casserole for my dad and mom.
THANKS so much for such a versatile and wonderful recipe!!!

I have to admit, I'm rating this based on how I made it...
I used cream of chicken and broccoli soups,  8 oz of softened cream cheese instead of sour cream and I added fresh broccoli, 1/2 an onion, a LOT of garlic powder instead of salt, and frozen corn. Using the four chicken breasts and the whole 12 oz package of noodles, there was enough for about 12 people! So we ate half and I put half in the freezer for another meal. This was very rich and creamy  and I will definitely make it again. I like that I got two meals for the effort of one!

My family, including my 3 year old grandson loved this dish.   My only substitute was Triscuits crackers instead of a buttery cracker (Ritz). It gave the topping a nice slight crunch.  Will definitely make again.

LOVED it! Even my pickiest, texture-challenged child loved it and asked me to make it again very soon. It has great, blended flavors. No changes necessary!

After reading several reviews, I made the recipe with the following changes:  I added a 10 ounce bag of cooked vegetables, added a small onion,  3/4 can of milk, and a teaspoon of garlic.  I did not have the buttery crackers, so I substituted finely ground garlic butter croutons.  While  I will not make this on a regular basis,  will make it again.

I love this recipe!!! It's quick and easy but tastes like you spent a lot of time preparing it. My two year old asks for it all the time and he can even help prepare it. I'm not a very good cook but this recipe makes me feel like I could be a chef. ;) well at least in a daydream.

I had to add a lot to it! It's otherwise quite bland. 

I bake the chicken in lieu of poaching it, then pull it apart. I boil water with two cubes of chicken bullion, the chicken drippings, 2 cups of diced carrots, 2 cups of diced celery, 1 small sweet onion; chopped, and 1 tablespoon of poultry seasoning, then  use that water to boil the noodles thereafter. I  add 1 tsp rosemary to the mixture and double the salt as well. I also double the Ritz crackers as well, yet keep the butter allotment the same (too greasy!). This makes it absolutely de-LISH and my hubby's favorite chicken dish. On top of that, I couple this with a very basic drop biscuit, and he's in Heaven. The little bit of extra effort is definitely worthwhile.

To make the casserole a little healthier I substituted low fat soups and sour cream.  Also instead of the crackers I used whole wheat panko bread crumbs.  It was delicious

I'm rating off my version, since I made modifications. I boil the chicken breast in chicken broth. I substituted cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom. I added garlic powder, onion powder and celery seed to the sauce. Very delicious and a huge hit with everyone who ate it.

This was a little thick.  I had to use what was on hand, I used breadcrumbs instead of crackers and I did add parmesan cheese even though the recipe didn't call for it.  The chicken I used went in frozen into the water and I think I may have cooked it too long.  I do think without these factors, this would have still been a 4.  It wasn't super.  ALTHOUGH...my daughter and her friend said, "We don't like it, we LOVE it!"  It is a good comfort food for sure.  So a 5 according to the kids, but so-so for me.

This recipe alone is bland, so I added mixed frozen veggies, garlic, and a little salt. I also put cheese on the top and cooked for extra 5 min so it would melt. It was yummy and my children loved it. It was also good for my husband who is battling cancer and is sick a lot. Hope this helps! I give 4 stars to the original recipe...with add-ins, I give it 5! (extra tip: If you like the cracker topping, try crushing saltines or regular Ritz and the Ritz sour cream and onion cracker chips together. It gives it a little extra kick and was really good).

Yummy! I used rotini pasta because I didn't have egg noodles. I used a full 16 oz of rotini instead of the recommended 6 oz--might scale it back to about 12 oz next time. I added two stalks of celery and one medium sized onion, as well as some Italian seasoning. I also didn't have sour cream, so I made a substitute by whipping up heavy cream with some lemon juice and a touch of salt. With these changes, it was delicious.

I will definitely make this again.  It was so easy and totally delicious.  The only change I made was that I added some veggies straight out of the freezer, peas and carrots, right before I put the dish in the oven.  My husband loves this.  Also, it froze and reheated great.

Yeah I'm rating my own version of this dinner. Get over it.  I knew by reading the ingredient list that this would be watered down version of what it could be. To begin, I chopped up three celery stalks, three carrots, and one medium onion. ( I doubled the recipe for a family dinner). I sauteed this trinity in EVOO and butter and S&P. I combined both soups with sour cream and added a teaspoon and a half Chicken Bouillon. Once the veggies were sauteed to my liking, I added it to the soup mix, with shredded chicken breast from Costco roasted chicken. From there, I followed the recipe. I served it with Worcestershire on the side if anyone would like to add it. It was really delicous. I rate it 4 stars because my dish could have used more flavour depth. I'll add garlic next time, and cook down the veggies till they're softer. Try this and let me know! Bon appetit!

The first recipe from this site I made, and the first time cooking for a large group, but didn't have buttery round crackers so crunched up regular crackers and whipped it through some lightly salted melted butter, then broiled on high a little at the end to crisp the top up!

We added garlic, can of sweet summer corn, used cream of herb chicken soup and cream of cheddar soup (I hate mushrooms, especially cream of mushroom soup), and diced ham. Instead of sour cream, I added cubed creamy Havarti cheese. 

It came out delicious. The boys put it down quickly and didn't complain (9 and 10 year old). 

You could easily add cubed swiss cheese and cubed ham with some frozen peas. Broccoli florets would be delicious as well. You really can't mess it up, and don't be afraid to have fun with it.

Delicious!  I'm sure it would be fine "as is" ;  however, I made a few minor additions. I added carrots, celery, and a chicken bullion cube. to the chicken water.  I also used Kluski home style noodle instead of egg noodles.  The dish reminds me of tuna casserole but  better. The buttered crackers really take the dish from just good to delicious.

I'm going to make this for dinner tonight. I am going to use a rotisserie chicken shredded  and I'm going to add butter and parsley to the noddles and I'm also going to use cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom and I'm going to add a little  bit of diced onion, diced carrots and peas and top it off with cheddar cheese. I'll update this and let you know how it turns out. This was great we all loved it next time im going to use an extra can of cream of celery and chicken and a good splash of milk  do to the fact i used a whole bag of noodles. I also used garlic pepper and i layered the dish with half of the shredded chicken and the other half was mixed with the noodle mix. I also cooked the veggies while the noodels were cooking and i added chicken bullion to the water. I added about a  cup cheese to the cracker mix used two packes of cracker and more butter and will make this again.

Like most others, I tweaked the original to suit my family's tastes.  I gave it 5 stars because the original is a good base recipe to build on.

Great base recipe.  Made it my own and easier the 2nd time. Sautéed onion and garlic in butter, added in large can of chicken breast meat.  Boiled 4-6 ounces of egg noodles, drained. Stirred in chicken mixture, added can of cream of chicken soup, 1/4 c. Sour cream, splash of milk, salt, pepper, garlic & herb seasoning and 1/4 c shredded mozzarella and 1/4 c. baby peas. Poured into 8x8  casserole dish, topped with French fried onions. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  Yum!  I have also used cream of celery, no cheese, chopped baby spinach, etc and it is great every time

This was so good! I doubled the recipe and added mixed veggies because I normally do that with chicken casserole anyway. The sour cream makes all the difference. And since I'm a mom and don't give reviews as a "job", I based my review on my adjustments. I think they are helpful and enjoy everyone's input on recipes they've made. Thanks!

It turned out really good. It is something I would love to make over and over again. I did use 12 oz. of noodles instead of what the recipe called for because it just wasn't enough to go with the other ingredients.

First time I made this according to recipe. Very good! The second time  added frozen peas for a vegetable and color. This is a rich, filling casserole and almost better as a leftover the next day.  My friends agree, it's delicous!

It was flavorful and turned out ok, a very bland recipe with too much chicken. Don't think I'll make it again.

I liked this recipe.  I made it for my boyfriend and myself tonight.  My complaint with this recipe as written was that it's a little monotone in terms of color (lots of beige) and I wish there had been more vegetables in it (celery, onion, fresh mushrooms).  That said, my boyfriend said that he would like to have it again as is, so my critiques might be unwarranted.

It was good but a bit bland and could be more saucy. If i was to make it again id probably add an extra can of soup and id add some onion and celery to liven it up a bit so it doesn't taste as bland.

I was hoping for more flavor but it was quite bland. It's an OK base to start from and add more herbs, spices or veggies but this recipe as is, is definitely not how I would serve it a next time.

Not very good.  Made this for my husband, 9 yr old daughter, and 5 yr old son.  They said it was "ok".  No one went back for seconds.  Probably won't make this one again.  Chicken lacks flavor. Need some kind of seasoning.

I've made this several times, both the original way and a modified way.  I think the original way is very good but a bit too creamy for us with the addition of sour cream.  I substituted a half can of Campbells Chicken Stock and it was great.

Very, very good! My family loved it as did I! Don't be afraid to make it your own either. My family adores onions so fried some up and in they went. I always use garlic with every meal so fried some up and in they went! I also have to feed a couple of very hearty eaters so I put some broccoli in there too. Added an extra can of cream of chicken to compensate, went ahead and sparingly sprinkled with cheese,  and baked as instructed! Yum!

Amazing and obsessed. I poach the chicken with a packet of Lipton's veg. soup to add some additional flavor. I bet it would be great with more veggies too. Next time I am going to cook the chicken in the crockpot the night before. That makes shredding much easier.

I liked this very much at first but after a few preparations the condensed soup base begins to seem a bit cloying.  I will try thinning it with a bit of milk if I make this again.

Used onion dip for sour cream. Wonderful flavor. Will keep for multiple uses, already prepared three times, and used boneless skinless thighs in place of breasts. Better chicken meat flavor.

I made the recipe as is. However, I used only two chicken breasts which is sufficient for me and my husband. In reading the reviews after I made this tasty dish, I agree for eye appeal color needs to be added to the dish, i.e., red bell pepper, celery, carrots.

Great recipe!  I was looking for a way to use some leftover chicken and this recipe was perfect. I did add some frozen peas and carrots and we loved it!

This is just the best chicken casserole and great to freeze and take to work.  I used penne because it is what I had and I like a little more substantial pasta.  Wish this would let me upload a pic.... Delish!

Super yummy. I use only 1 can of condensed chicken soup and a whole 16 oz container of sour cream. Also, I top it with potato chip crumbs instead of crackers.

Added 1/2 cup chicken broth as soup mixture seemed rather "tight". Baked in 9x13 pan with DOUBLE topping. Hubby absolutely loves it.

have made it almost every week since I found it. I use a bit more noodles, and only three chicken breasts, and add in 16 oz of white mushrooms that I have sautéed in butter. We love mushrooms in my house. and we are pleased with the result.

Since I didn't have any buttery round crackers, my only choices were round whole grain, or Townhouse Fociacca Tuscan Four Cheese. I opted for the latter because it had way more flavor. Plus they were going stale, so it was a good save. Everything else stayed the same. Good comfort food.

This is the fourth time I made this dish. I really like it and makes a great lunch for work. I have seen many people say it is bland but the soups give it lots of flavor.  The only thing I did differently this time is add some more mushrooms. My preference since I just like them.

This meal was a hit, but I must admit I made a few changes to the recipe...the chicken breasts I buy are so huge that I used only 3 instead of the 4 it calls for.  Six ounces of noodles was simply not going to be enough so I used one 16 oz. package.  The mushroom soup was "cream of mushroom soup w/garlic" and I used two 10.75 oz. cans of cream of chicken soup because of the increased noodles.  Also increased sour cream to 1.5 cup and added 1/2 c. chopped onions.

This casserole is a keeper. I did have to make some changes though as I was making this dish for only my husband and I. I used two chicken breasts, and cut back on the amount of egg noodles too. Next, I only used one can of soup, cream of mushroom. Next time I'll try cream of chicken to see which way we like better. I omitted the sour cream , as we're watching our calories. I made the cracker/butter topping, baked 350 for 40 minutes. My husband and I both loved this dish. We're finishing whats left for lunch today.

I made this the 1st time with all of the ingredients, but added onions and finely chopped fresh broccoli. Each time I made it I have added additional items such as fresh garlic, and finely chopped carrots. I like this recipe because you can throw in different veggies according to what you have in the fridge.

I thought this was so good!  A great cold weather, comfort food dish.  I made it just like the recipe.  Next time, I might add peas or carrots too it, and perhaps sub out plain yogurt for the sour cream to make it a little healthier.

This is a great starter recipe. It is very simple, added 2 onions, a bell pepper, corn, and a packet of ranch dressing mix. Amazing. Doubled the chicken, and noodles and baked for 40min, it was perfect. Will be making again.

My family loved this.  It was an excellent recipe to build upon.  I made numerous changes as most people did because of the reviews about it being bland.  I made stock with chicken base,  celery, onions, and seasonings to boil the chicken in and used that stock to also cook the noodles.  I seasoned my chicken with Cavendar's rubbed it in and let it set while I was preparing the stock. Also used cream of mushroom, cream of celery, half an 8 oz block of cream cheese,  half cup sour cream, half can evaporated milk, combined this in a large bowl and seasoned with Cavendar's,  Mrs. Dash table blend, bacon salt,  poultry seasoning,  Paprika,  onion powder, garlic powder.  To the soup mixture I added a cup of frozen cooked peas and carrots, cooked chicken that I cut into small pieces, and the noodles, mixed well and topped with the cracker/butter topping.
Many changes but it was yummy..even the picky eater ate it!

No flavor but soup and chicken. I added some leftover peas, the heart of a celery stalk, and changed cracker crumbs to stuffing crumbs.

This was yummy! I doubled the recipe and used about 2/3 a bag of the frozen chicken breast tenderloins.  My sons family loved it, even asked for the recipe.  WIll keep this one on my list for a hardy Winter meal!

It tasted great! I added some frozen peas and carrots and some fresh mushrooms - I'll make this one again and again.

This is very bland and boring. Sorry, owner of this recipe. The idea is good and I see myself making it again with a few changes to add some life into it: veggies, maybe some sliced up jalapeños, crushed garlic for a bit of zing. I felt the taste of the two soups was a bit strong compared to the taste of anything else so I would probably add 3\4 of each can instead of all of each can. And spices/herbs. Oh, and the ritz cracker thing is quite strong too. I would use panko crumbs with butter instead for that lovely crunch.

I love this recipe and I have tried it with some of the others viewers suggestions but I like it as is.  Sometimes I will sprinkle cheese on top if I am in the mood for cheese but I love it both ways. Its the perfect comfort food casserole. My husband even loves it and he is the pickiest eater I know.

This recipe was a big hit and disappeared quickly! I added a few chicken boullion cubes to the poaching water, which in turn flavored the noodles, which added a depth of flavor.  I added about 3/4 C of the pasta water to the sauce. I substituted celery salt and garlic powder for the salt and pepper. I used almost 2C cracker crumbs rather that 1 to absorb more of the butter. This recipe will be added to our collection of family favorites.

I boiled the chicken with a few spices first (bay leaves, basil, and oregano) to add flavor to the chicken. Also, I added paprika and chili powder to the cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups to give it a little extra zing. It turned out fantastic!

Excellent base recipe that allows other cooks to add their own taste preference to it! You can fatten it up or slim it down...adding green veggies are great, particularly broccoli or chopped spinach...lots of good options to pick from when cooking for yourself or your family! Also a great "pot luck" style covered dish...I shredded my chicken after baking it, vs. poaching and cutting it...

This was delicious, creamy, homey & oh so satisfying. I made some changes, but  I'm thankful for this blueprint. I poached my chicken with salt, onion powder & thyme. I also added about a cup of milk to the soups & sour cream because I undercooked my noodles & I didn't want the casserole to be dry.  I usually cook noodles to mush, so this was good. I also threw in a handful of broccoli florets to the noodles because I had some that needed to be used. I used buttery crackers & dabbed butter on the top. It's a great casserole I'm sure I'll make often. PS I don't review recipes for a living, but if I did, I don't think I'd need to be a bitch about it. It's a casserole, get over yourself.

I  had left over pork roast that I cut up into pieces instead of the chicken.  It was a hit.  I also used spiral noodles instead of egg noodles.  Only thing I'll try next time is to mix the crushed crackers with shredded cheese.

Not so tasty, needed more herbs and crunch, possibly needed some celery, onions and Italian herbs. Would not make it again.

I used cream of celery soup (did not have cream of chicken soup) along with the cream of mushroom soup, & rather than the butter & crackers for a topping, I simply sprinkled the top well with Old Bay (we love Old Bay seasoning).  I think this recipes could use more noodles--I used only 3 chicken breast halves & this was a LOT of meat for only 6 oz. cooked noodles. Next time I will add broccoli or peas--the only green foods other family members will eat! Thank you.

I absolutely love this recipe. It is super easy and delicious. Any leftovers become my husbands lunch for the next work day. For any of you mothers needing to save a bit of time, about the 3rd time that I made this casserole I used canned chicken from Sam's club and it tasted just as delicious.

I made it exactly to recipe, only using rotisserie chicken instead of cooking it myself so as to save time on a weeknight.  Loved it.  My family loved it.  Great comfort food.  No, it isn't very spicy or lively but if you just want nice warm filling food with creamy texture, this will hit the spot just as it is.

it is a good base recipe for me to use up stuff I have on had that needs to get eaten. I didn't use any sour cream and the soups I used were cream of onion and cheddar broccoli for the chicken I used a rotisserie one I got from Walmart the seasoning I used 1/4 tsp of poultry seasoning, 1/4 tsp of celery seeds then I topped with panko crumbs and some shredded cheese. It was kinda bland so next time I am going to use more cheese and add some peppers I like the taste of the egg noodles.

We loved addition of frozen veggies. I used regular cream instead of sour cream since I didn't have any and it turned out fab. Also used another can of cream of chicken soup since didn't have and don't like mushroom soup. Seasoned with added garlic and thyme as others suggested. Kids and adults loved!

So, I used to get really annoyed when people would review based on their doctored-up recipe, but now that I've started cooking more and more, I really appreciate those reviews.
I've made this casserole several times, and my husband and I absolutely love it. I made it last night and I am thinking about making another one to have on hand for him to take to work for lunch. I use a rotisserie chicken instead of poaching the chicken breasts. I just shred it up and have it ready in a separate bowl. It's much easier, and I think it tastes better. I also chop up half an onion, a couple stalks of celery, a carrot, and 2 or 3 cloves of garlic. I put the veggies in a small pot and let them simmer in a can of chicken broth while I cook the noodles and get the soup mixture ready. In the soup mixture, I add in about a cup of milk. It's way too thick without the extra liquid. I also use more like 10 ounces of egg noodles, as opposed to 6. When the veggies are cooked to my liking, I drain out some of the broth, but most of it is absorbed by the time I'm ready to mix them in. All of these ingredients mixed together will fit nicely in a 3-qt baking dish. Not even the original recipe would fit into a 2-qt. Make sure you have a 3-qt on hand! I top it with the buttery Ritz crackers and bake it like the recipe says. It's SO GOOD! I tried it as written the first time and it was definitely bland. Now I know exactly how to make it so it tastes amazing and it's one of me and my husband's favorites!

Delicious! My family loves it and it is great to freeze.  It's just as good taken from the freezer than it is out of the oven.

This is a great base for any casserole, change it to however you feel! When I made mine I just used left over chicken instead of poaching them. I only used one can of cream of chicken with some sour cream and it was the perfect amount. Added some thyme and garlic powder just to give it some extra needed flavor. I added a can of mushrooms and it was a great meal. It took no time at all! I would definitely make this again.

I added some frozen mixed veggies, little Italian spice and 1/2 small onion.  Nice recipe, but I think the next time I'll use 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup milk...I could really taste the sour cream.  I did add 1/2  milk as well, with the 1/2 cup sour cream - at first it seemed a little too soupy, but it was fine and will me more moist for re-warming.

A bit much with chicken and cream of mushroom soup.  I use one or the other and add 1.5 cans of milk for moisture. Add I can of chopped chili peppers for a bit of hot.  Rewarms well.

Added all the changes Bobobearzoe suggested with two mods. First, we used breadcrumbs instead of butter crackers and second we cooked it in a stone at 365 degrees.

My picky 5yo and I both loved it.  My modifications were that I halved the recipe and used homemade cream of chicken soup (Pinch of Yum's recipe) using homemade chicken stock, so it was plenty flavorful without any additions.  Definitely will add this one to the rotation!

I followed this recipe. I only made 2 changes. I  used cream of celery, instead of cream of mushroom. And I also added half cup of frozen carrots, and peas. It turned out great and I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe!  I read reviews before making this dish for the first time and one of the reviewers wasn't a fan of poaching the chicken.  I did poach the chicken.  I added chicken broth to the water for added flavour.  The one thing I did not do, was cook the egg noodles in the poached chicken water.  There was too much chicken fat, etc., in the water when I removed the chicken.  I opted to use fresh water to boil the egg noodles.  Other than adding additional seasoning, ie., poultry seasoning, garlic powder and seasoned salt, my family really enjoyed this dish.   Thanks Dawne!

Very good, very easy.  I cooked my chicken in chicken broth and added some sage and celery salt.  After removing the chicken, I cooked my noodles in the rest of broth and enough water to cook noodles.  I topped the  casserole with french fried onion rings.

I made this as is and fed my hubby, my neighbour and self. I received rave reviews. I think that's the first time I've been told that a meal was "phenomenal". I'll definitely make it again but might add some sautéed onion and celery along with some mixed veggies.

This recipe was a hit with my family.  I did make some changes as I did not have all the ingredients. Because I only had a large can of cream of chicken soup and not the mushroom soup, nor sour cream, I substituted a container of cream cheese with chives mixed with about a cup of milk and followed the rest of the recipe.  It was delicious, my son dropped by the had a plate and said mum you have to give this recipe to his wife which I promptly did.  It is so easy and my husband said you have to make this again.  P.S.  I used extra crackers

Real comfort food!  Added some parmesan on top before cooking.  Used chicken thighs instead of breasts and made extra.   Will repeat soon!

First, I made the recipe EXACTLY as directed. Second, when a recipe says "salt and pepper to taste", please do so. This recipe was not bland at all. I think we sometimes forget that one little sprinkle of salt and pepper is enough. Shake away….it makes this dish fabulous. And the buttered crackers…MMMMmmmm. All of my teenage kids loved it. Hubby was out in the fields working, so he had to eat later while I was gone. He sent me a text saying, "OMG that's good!!!" So, remember….salt and pepper to taste. :)

My family loves this.  This recipe is a very good base but needs ingredients added to it.  I seasoned boneless chicken tenderloins with poultry seasoning then browned them in oil.  I pulled the chicken apart and set aside once browned.  Then I added a mirepoix and sauteed until translucent.  I had the sauce ready in a bowl and the noodles ready in a bowl.  Now I did add 1/2 soup can of milk to the sauce to be creamier.  Once the mirepoix is sauteed...just add the chicken the sauce and the noodles.  I covered the top with a stuffing mix (which you can just add cooked or uncooked) It is crunchier uncooked...we like it both ways.  cover and put in the oven until hot and bubbly.  This is soooooo good.  Lots of leftovers that don't last long. Which in my house is a sign of a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Tried the recipe. It's a little bland and very high in sodium with the two soups. As a single person cooking for myself, I look for recipes I can scale down. This does work. I used one of the soups and added frozen broccoli.  The rest was the same.

We loved it, I didn't have noodles, so used penne pasta, added a cup of mushrooms and a cup of peas, it was great.  Also used chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water.

This is a great recipe.  I added 1 cup of frozen baby peas, cooked for three minutes in the microwave using 3 tablespoons of water, and 1 & 1/2 teaspoons of thyme.  I also increased the amount of crackers so the whole top was covered.  Everyone loves it.

I love the coppery sweet finish of this easy to bake oven meal. I have made this recipe 39 times, and have tried several variations on the basic ingredients over that period of time. I would say this recipe is almost perfect as is, and with an additional 4 cups of water and cubed watermellon it is pure perfection. Delectable.

My mother in law used to make this with ground beef, she called it Ground Beef Casserole, she also added 1 can sweet corn. I switch up the noodles I use, we like spag. noodles in it too, I never have any leftovers and I have shared it with sooo many over the years.

After the reviews, I decided to make this twice. The first time was "as is", and the second with modifications. I agree this is "bland" in the original form, but it is a great foundation to create something special if you are an experimental cook. In my second version I doctored it up quite a bit. It is much better with adaptations...I have to thank Dawne for giving as a great foundation to broaden our cooking horizons!!!

Definitely needs more flavor and more ingredients like veggies or something to add some color. Pretty bland on its own.

Wow and yummy are 2 words that come to mind.  Very easy to make and my whole family kept coming up for more.  Next time I will be sure to add some frozen vegetable in there to at least make me feel a little better about it but  I didn't have any on hand.  I had left over chicken from another dish so this was incredibly easy to make and much tastier than tuna noodle casserole that I remember as a kid.

Loved this one!  The flavor was delicious and I loved the consistency.  It is great for when you are having company because you can prepare ahead.  It is also very versatile.  You can add anything to this.  I chose to add carrots, mushrooms and onion.  If you want to pre cook whatever you choose to add you could add it to the pot in the last couple minutes while cooking the chicken.  I didn't do this as I don't like my veggies too soft. You could also swap the noodles for potatoes.

This was an excellent dish that everyone loved.  I added sauteed celery and onions, along with some frozen baby peas and white/yellow corn.  I also used Mueller's Hearty Homestyle Egg Noodles.  They are 1"x1", dried, and were much easir to eat than the longer noodles.  Everyone loved the crumbled Ritz Crackers mixed with butter that topped it.

I made this just as it is written and my family of four (including 2 young boys, one which is really picky) loved it.  The only thing that may have added some flavor is the crackers that I used came in various flavors and the one I had on hand was vegetable flavored, so the "crust" had more seasoning than if I had used a plain cracker I guess.
Will most definitely make this one again!

At my house, we really liked it with the additions I made.  I put some sliced green onion in the chicken soup mixture and instead of salt and pepper, I used Nature's Seasoning which also has garlic. I will definitely make this again and look forward to the leftovers.

I loved this recipe but made changes to make it my own.. Sautéed the chicken in garlic and onions, added peas and carrots and thyme. This is a keeper.

We loved it! When I put it all together, it seemed a little lacking in appearance so I added some frozen peas and carrots. It also looked like it would bake a bit dry so I added some milk. With these additions, it was yummy! I realized before I baked it that it would be way too much for me and hubby so I split the casserole into two dishes. I baked one and put one in the fridge for the following night's dinner. On the second go 'round, I decreased the amount of butter added to the cracker crumbs because the first casserole came out a bit greasy on the top. It was much better that way. This recipe is definitely a keeper and will become part of our regular rotation.

Reviewed as written, this is a three star recipe. BUT... add just a few extra ingredients and this goes easily to a five star dish! Just add any of your favorite veggies (I like broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, carrots - not always all at the same time, but go with what you love!) Sometimes I skip the veggies and add some pimiento and mushrooms - delicious! I also often stir in some shredded cheese - either swiss or colby/jack, but any cheese you love will work (my hubby loves pepperjack for a little extra zing!).

This was ok, I baked the chicken instead of poaching and added broccoli when putting the casserole together. I'll try it again.

This was wonderful and so easy! The only noodles I had on hand were penne (my husbands favorite) and it still turned out wonderful. I know that egg noodles would be so much better, so when I went to the store, I bought some for my next casserole. I did add broccoli and some spices in mine, so for those that say to rate it as is, I have NEVER made a dish without adding my own ingredients that we love. If you love to cook, and cook a lot, you will always add your own things for your particular taste. Any kind of veggie(s)  would be great with this. I was going to put mixed ones in there, but I had just made homemade soup with mixed ones in it and didn't want to repeat that. My husband went crazy over this and he is pretty picky and will always tell me if he wants it again. Very nummy! And it makes a big batch for just the two of us so I will half the recipe next time. It is in my recipe box for the next batch.

As I was putting this together it tasted pretty blah, so I read the reviews and found out most people agreed. I quick added a cup od shredded cheddar cheese to it. Tasted better than I expected! The proportions seem off here too between the amount of noodles and the amount of chicken.

This is a great starter recipe. I did add some garlic to give it a little zip along with some herbs. The nice thing about it is that you can add different ingredients to keep it interesting. I found that the two cans of "cream of" soup were just a little too much for my liking. I suggest using only one can of cream of mushroom and adding one of those liquid chicken flavorings to it. Also, I found it wasn't as good the next day heated up as a leftover so I recommend that you scale it down in size to finish at your first meal. Other than that, it's a winner!

This was Amazing and super easy!! I don't particularly like sour cream so I used 2% milk and celery salt for flavor. Other than that the only thing I changed was, I had to use canned white chicken do to I was short on time. This is the 1st casserole I've ever made and I'll be making it again soon! The way the recipe is set up you could even use tuna.

I make this with canned tuna as well, though I haven't added sour cream to it and its delicious. I also layer the noodles and tuna (or in this case the chicken) and top the chicken with more noodles.
The topping I use is crumpled potato chips! Very tasty!

Delicious! I did add stuff to it just for my own personal taste.  Added a little 1/2 and 1/2, extra noodles, minced garlic, curry, cayenne and a tastefully simple rustic herb blend.  Also added some french fried onions to the buttery cracker topping. Oh, almost forgot to add, that for simplicity's sake, I used a large can of boned chicken...quick and easy! So, so good and my family loved it!

I noticed other than salt and pepper there arent any seasonings..we are a family that likes big flavour..I rubbed the chicken with olive oil salt and pepper and roasted it on 400 f for 17 min. I also added 1 tsp poultry seasoning 1/2cup dry white wine and 1 tblsp of chili powder to the combined soups.
The first time I made it my family wasnt impressed but thats my fault for being so big on huge flavours in my cooking all their lives. I also never poach chicken as it takes so much flavour out.. I pretty much roast everything in olive oil because it adds flavour..I cut up a variety of fresh mixed veggies (broccoli, onions, mushrooms, red bell pepper) drizzle with olive oil salt and pepper with fresh sliced garlic. Toss it to coat veggies then roast in the oven on 425 for 15 min. We love it and I change the veggie mix each time.

this is a fantastic recipe!!  substituted  low-fat  and non fat versions of the condensed soups and sour cream.  with evening baked together,  you cannot tell the difference. I also added  frozen press and carrots for  nutrition  and color. omitted  the butter on top and just added the crackers.  you can't tell the difference.  have also used this recipe for leftover  frozen turkey from Thanksgiving!!!  great versatile recipe for any weeknight  meal!!  my family loves it!!

A nice, quick dinner. I used 2 cans of chicken breast in order to save time. I also used a 9x13 casserole dish and altered as follows: boil 12 oz egg noodles for 4 minutes, add 1 12 oz bag frozen mixed vegetables. When water begins to boil drain the eggs/veggies. Put back in pot, add 2 cans chicken and mix. Combine 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 cup sour cream, onion powder and garlic powder in separate bowl. Pour over noodle mixture and combine well. Add 1/2 cup milk if mixture seems dry. Pour into ungreased 9x13 pan, and top with crushed butter round crackers. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Leftovers were great. I will be making this again!

Came out quite delicious!

Like a mix between poppyseed chicken and chicken & noodles only better! I like it just like the recipe calls for but unfortunately my calorie counter does not so next time it's low fat sour cream or plain Greek yogurt and I don't know what I'll do about the topping!!! It was the best part!!!

I melted a half of a stick of butter along with fresh mushrooms and sautéed them and added them to this recipe.  I also added (more) sour cream instead of the water to this recipe and it was excellent!

This was fabulous! I used 8 oz egg noodles, added some broccoli (microwaved in the bag before adding) and some diced onions that I sautéed. I also melted half of a stick of butter in the bottom of the dish before ingredients were added to be cooked. As I always do, I buy a deli cooked rotisserie chicken and pull it apart with my fingers.

It was okay for one meal but probably won't make again.  Warms up very well.

It's easy and good. I cooked the chicken as directed. I've never cooked it this way before it comes out very tender. I didn't boil the noodles in the chicken water. In a seperate pot I boiled the noodles adding a can of clear chicken broth for flavor. For spices I added a little garlic & onion powder. I added a small can of peas & carrot mix also. Didn't do the bread crumbs my family is not a fan of it. My 20 year old son doesn't like poultry but ate this up. I told him what he was eatting. He looked at me and said Mom it's good. I was shocked. I expected him not to eat it. Happy he did...thanks Dawne for the recipe.

After watching the video I decided that I would give this recipe a go but knew that I would have to make some adjustments.  Added an extra can of Cream of Chicken Soup, some garlic powder, onion powder, and a little milk (sauce was a little thick).

Cut up two stalks of celery and added to the casserole (did not heat up with initial sauce just added while mixing pre-oven).  Provided some additional crunch.

Everything else stayed the same.

I made this using leftovers from a rotisserie chicken we made on the grill and only substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. It was delicious, but I think the next time I will add some frozen peas. This recipe seems very versatile and could easily be flavored with whatever spices strike your fancy that day, spicy or savory.

This is John B. Tried it 3-17-13. Very good. A keeper. Added celery, onion, frozen vegs. Maybe should use less sour cream. By the time I added the extras, I realized full cans of the cream of mushroom and chicken was needed. This revised recipe made about 6 servings.

I made two tiny changes - I only used 1 carton of cream of chicken soup and then splashed in some milk. Then, I threw in a 1/2 a bag of frozen peas. The entire family loved it, even the picky eater. Simple and quick.

Made it twice as is and really enjoyed it.  My only suggestion would be to double the crackers and butter but that's just a personal preference.  If you don't have any sour cream then a cup of plan yogurt works just as well.

Yes I changed it a little too, but I love the recipe foundation, and I really didn't change it much. I just added a half tablespoon of lemon juice and used mayo instead of sour cream, about a heaping half cup. And I used rectangular crackers (Club crackers :) ) instead of round since that's what I usually have in the pantry. And I added some frozen green beans. All that said, it was so easy and so delicious! My son wants me to serve it for his family birthday party. :) Thanks!

this was just delicious, ultimate comfort food!
i did listen to other reviews and cooked both the chicken and egg noodles in chicken broth, also added a bag of frozen broccoli i steamed up first. also i did add a little bit of water with the sour cream soup mixture so it would not be dry.
it makes a lot, but it's so good, it's real easy to finish up!
definitely give it a shot, this is one of the best casseroles i've tried on here!

Great recipe! You can make this casserole different each time.  This will be my second time and I am adding some yellow summer squash I put up from my garden and some other veges I picked up from Sprouts. Thanks for a good base receipe.

The first time I made this according to directions.  It was bland.  So I'm only giving it 3 stars for that.  I added a bit more salt and pepper as well as some corn for texture and it just made it that much better.  Thanks for a good starting point, my mom used to make this with tuna!

This is a great recipe, but, like many others, I changed a few minor things.  First, if you are in a huge hurry and want something fast, use drained canned chicken.  It's not quite as good, but in a pinch, it's fine.  Second, instead of plain sour cream, I use Top the Tater or an equivalent, which is sour cream with onions and chives added.  Third, when I do poach the chicken, I only use 2 chicken breasts instead of 4.  I have added a bag of frozen veggies, the kind you can steam in the bag in the microwave (broccoli/cauliflower mix).  Microwave the veggies before adding to the mix. Maybe add a little more Top the Tater to compensate.  I make this recipe all the time, and I love it.

Pretty good! I took out the sour cream because im not a fan. Insted I used 1.5 cans of cream of chicken with herb with the cream of muchroom to add a little more flavor and also a little bit of garlic powder. I think next time I will add some frozen peas! I will be making it again soon

I thought this recipe was very bland. My husband and 20 month old daughter really liked it though. I think it needs the addition of some onions and other vegetables to give it a kick.

The second time I made it, I substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream (make it a little healthier).  No one noticed :)

I had to sub penne pasta for the egg noodles because I didn't have any.  I also added broccoli and cauliflower that I had in the fridge.  Didn't add butter to the crackers, just crushed them on top.  Fed my kids and the neighbor kids and everyone loved it!

I made this last nite and the only thing I did different was use the cream of chicken with herbs, which I can't see making that much of a difference. I have to say I didn't care for this- tasted too sour-creamy to me. I'm going to try some leftovers for tonite's dinner, based on reviews saying it tasted better the next day..... Let's hope so, considering I doubled it.......

I made it as is, and was disapointed at how dry it was. After reading the other reviews I will make it again but I will be adding to it. 4 breasts is just too much meat for this size a casserole. I like my casseroles a little more juicy and tasty than this one was.

I browned the chicken stove top with onion and garlic and then shredded the chicken. Added the soups to the onion garlic oil mixture still in the pan. I forgot to buy the sour cream and used milk for moisture instead. It came out tasting like tuna casserole which is exactly what I wanted without the fishy flavor. Sprinkled some cheese on top of the bread crumb mixture and pulled out the oven when it was browned. The kids loved it in their own ramekins and I will be adding to the rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

As written this would probably only be 3 stars.  To add some flavor, I poached my chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper.  It adds a lot more flavor to the casserole.  I think boiled the noodles in the same water.  I also used two cream of mushrooms, leaving out the cream of chicken soup.

I really liked it, I added some cheddar cheese to it. I think it could use a little garlic and broccoli next time, but still really good!

Very simple and yummy comfort food! I used the cream of chicken with herbs to help any blandness, cooked noodles in the leftover chicken juices, and added a bag of some mixed veggies. This is definitely a keeper!

Fantastic!  A huge hit at my house.  Used a pre-roasted chicken from the grocery store and got the reduced fat soups.  I added a bunch of veggies (broccoli, zucchini, squash, bell peppers).  Seasoned my veggies with garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt, and black pepper.  Oh...and i omitted the butter from the topping.  Thanks for posting Dawne!

Very creamy and good casserole. I too added some cooked broccoli to the mixture for a more complete meal. I also added shredded cheese when I served it but I think it could have been added prior to baking in the oven as well.

I made this for our soup kitchen last night (adjusted recipe to 30).  It was vey good.  

Added broccoli and mushrooms.  When I poach chicken, I add celery, onions, parsley and chicken bouillon to the cooking water.  Also, used this to cook the rotini pasta.  The casserole seemed dry and I added some of this cooking water to the casserole.

I've made this several times over the last couple of months.  I followed suggestions from other reviews and added either mixed veggies or just broccoli - it is delicious!  My husband gobbled it up and even my extremely picky 2 year old eats this :)  I layer 1/2 c of cheddar cheese and 1/2 c of italian blend, then I use bread crumbs instead of the crackers, since that is usually what I have on hand.  Very yummy on a chilly night!

This recipe is quick, easy and kid friendly.  I found it a bit bland and think some additional spices or herbs could easily make this a 5 star family casserole.

Delicious!! Even better on the second day. I made minor tweaks--added a T of thyme and raw garlic to the water for poaching the chicken/cooking the noodles. I also used half the butter and increased the crackers to 1 1//2 cups as someone else suggested. I used chicken and herbs condensed soup, healthy cream of mushroom and light sour cream (slightly less than one cup.) I also added a small can of drained mushrooms. I will definitely make this one again. Thanks for the great recipe.

I used leftover chicken off the bone after cooking a whole chicken over the weekend. Also, I was out of cream of mushroom and subsituted cream of celery. It was so good, I can't imagine how it could have been better with the original recipe. Also, I would decrease the amount of butter to cracker crumbs as mine came out a little soggy. Great recipe, definitely a keeper. Could also use other "cream of" soups or even add veggies.

Hands down the easiest meal to make! And best of all, the man of the house loves it (and so do his kids). 
I poach my chicken in chicken broth and add my own herbs. Tastes super!

This recipe is so good. I just tweaked it alittle. I panned fried some onions, added the soups with some garlic then added boiled chicken to pan to marry all the ingredients. I dumped it all in a pan and baked it as recipe calls. yummy!

Not a bad recipe.  But it lacks in flavor.  I would suggest adding more spices than just salt and pepper

I'm vegetarian and I made this with Gardein vegetarian chicken style strips.  Instead of a can of cream of chicken I used a can of cream of asparagus.  I added thyme and onion powder, half a bag of frozen peas and carrots, and I topped it with bread crumbs.  It turned out delicious!

Very good!  Easy to make and tastes great.  I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom and chicken soups, plus fat free sour cream and it still tasted fantastic.  I agree with some of the others:  Next time I will add chopped broccoli or maybe peas and carrots.

My family loves this recipe!  I add some petite sweet peas to get some green in there.  Reheated left overs aren't that great - but that's ok 'cause there's usually not much left! It's just so YUMMY!

Followed a previous review and browned the chicken in a skillet with olive oil before boiling. I used a bunch of seasonings (whaterver sounded tasty) in the skillet and added more to the water. I also scraped all the seasoningd from the skillet and put in the water. Also added chicken boulian to the water. Turned out amazing! The first time I followed recipie and it was very blan. Next time I will try adding some veggies!

I'm a vegetarian but I made this for my family and they went nuts! Especially my mom who doesn't like anything. Made a few changes. Added celery, garlic, cream, and tyme. And topped with a little mozzarella.

great recipe, I added garlic, onions, celery, carrots and a small can of corn and some of the broth after cooking the noodles.  It was a big hit and not much left for left overs, the stuffed themselves. Thanks for all the tips and ideas, the casserole was a hit.

This was only OK - I only changed it by adding half a bag of frozen mixed veggies to get some veggies in there.  It was convenient in that I made it early in the day and just put it in the oven when I got home later that night.  But it was pretty bland, so overall, meh.  Won't make again.

This casserole is delicious.  I cut back on the soups and the sour cream by 1/4 of each and it was fine.  I also cut the butter in half.  I think doing this made it a little more healthy, yet still awesome and everyone loved it!  I also added a small can of mushrooms, which made it more interesting.

I made this for dinner last night and it was delicious.  The only thing that I added was a can of broccoli and cheddar soup.  Even with the three cans of soup, it was perfect.  My husband said it was the best casserole I had ever made.  Thank you.

The whole family loved this one!  Based on other recommendations I made a few changes.  I used cream of chicken with herbs instead of the plain cream of chicken, I added about a 1/2 cup of milk to the soup mixture to make sure it stayed creamy and I added some shredded cheddar cheese to the top when there was about 5 minutes baking time left.  The biggest change I made was using a can of chunk chicken breast to speed up the prep time - turned out great!

Since I cook for one, I made this with left over chicken, the cream of chicken soup only and half a cup of sour cream.  I didn't have crackers so I put French's onion rings on top.  Very tasty easy recipe.

This was an ok recipe to start from but not as wonderful as I had hoped. We found it to be dry and sticky rather than creamy - I think adding some milk to the soup mixture will help. I also feel you could cut back on the sour cream.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and sauted celery and onion to provide some flavor and texture.  [glad I did] I cut back the butter to 1/4 cup melted with the cracker crumbs and that was plenty.   Last thought - I did not add salt for seasoning (only pepper) and next time I will try low sodium soups to help keep the salt down.

I thought this was pretty good. I was hoping though the sauce would be a little thicker. It reminder me of a chicken version of tuna casserole. I lightened it up by using an 8oz container of reduced fat sour cream and whipped butter, which has half the fat and calories. I left out the salt and pepper. I figured the canned soup had enough salt and I don't care for pepper. However, it was still kind of salty, but that is normal with using canned soup in any casserole. I might still make again though, because it does make a rather quick weekday meal.

I made this last night for my two hungry teens, and they loved it!  I added some sauteed mushrooms and onion along with some frozen peas, and a lil parsley s I read the reviews (wish i love to see how people share that)I realized it would be better adding stuff.  Will make again and will add more stuff as well.

I did add more egg noodles to this dish with all
the creamy additions to it and I love noodles
in a dish like this.

I have searched for years looking for that perfect casserole. I am pleased to say that this is it!! All I did differently is brown my chicken in a good cast iron skillet instead of boiling it. (NOTHING worse than boiled chicken) and I added some shredded cheese. Voila!! Wonderful. Sooooo many add in options here. You can dress this up any way you want!! Thanks for this awesome casserole!

Excellent & easy.  I used 2 cans of fat free cream of chicken soup because that is what I had on hand. I also used light sour cream.  Didn't taste a difference at all! I sprinkled in some thyme, garlic, salt, & pepper when cooking chicken & used the same water for boiling pasta.  Sprinkled chicken and pasta with parmesan cheese too.  It was super yummy, and I definitely plan to make again.

This is an awesome and easy recipe that your whole family will enjoy. The ONLY thing I did differently was to just use a whole sleeve of crackers instead of measuring out one cup of cracker crumbs. This recipe turns out the same every time and is always delicious as is. You dont need to change a thing!

Awesome comfort food. I made the casserole exactly to directions, but for the topping I added a can of french fried onions. It added extra flavor and crunch!

Everyone really liked this.  The only change I made was to add some peas and carrots and reduced the butter to about 3 tablespoons.  That amount made for a perfect crumbly crust without the extra fat.  I baked these in individual dished for my kids (which they think is fun), and so they baked even faster.  Great weeknight dinner.

Good basic recipe.  I added chopped carrots, celery, and onions to it and used Club crackers on top.  Turned out really well and the left overs heated up (in the oven) just as tasty.

Absolutely delicious and easy.  I didn't have crackers for the topping so I left them out and topped with cheddar cheese instead.  This will definitely be added to the dinner time rotation.

This was delicous.  The only thing I did different, was that I used spaetzel instead of regular noodles, and it was a 17 oz. bag.  There were NOT too many noodles though.  I thought 6 oz. was a little low for as much liquid as was called for.  My family couldn't quit raving about it.

Oh YUM! Its very simple but very good! My picky baby ate it right up! I followed the recipe but I did add more crackers. The recipe is great on its own but would love it with a bit more nutrition so next time Im going to add some vegitables. Also I boiled the chicken a bit longer than needed 'just in case' which only made the chicken slightly dry and was not needed. It tasted its best the day after when the flavors had been sitting over night! Will make again for sure!

This is delicious! I used bone-in chicken thighs instead of the boneless breasts because we prefer dark meat. The topping was crisp and buttery tasting. Will definitely make this again!

So I added to this recipe :) I felt it would have been a bit bland if I hadn't. I added mushrooms and minced garlic to the soup and chicken mixture, crunchy fried onions (packaged) and Parmesan cheese to the cracker topping. This is a really good recipe base for those who like to experiment! I know I did :)

This was a hit with my family. I didn't have any of the crackers suggested for the topping so I used equal amounts of mozzerela cheese, greated parmesean, and bread crumbs. I also added sauted mushrooms and peas.

Great recipe!!  Due to a picky eater I made a white sauce to substitute in place of the Cream of Mushroom Soup.  Also added 2 cups of shredded cheese.  This will become a regular!!

Absolutely wonderful just how it is. The only thing I've ever added is a bag of frozen peas to get a little veggie in! Also, I use the low sodium soups and fat-free sourcream to make it a little more heart-healthy. Lovely!

This recipe was very good!  I made some modifications based on some of the ideas I read.  I used low fat sour cream and two cans of low fat condensed cream of chicken soup (because I don't like mushrooms).  I added some garlic powder and onion powder to the sour cream mix.  I also used Keebler's butter garlic crackers for the topping.  They were so good!

Very easy, good comfort food. I used rotisserie chicken, no yolks noodles and low fat cream of chicken soup. Added a bag of vegetables and this was a wonderful one pot meal!

Everyone enjoyed this dish, even my pickiest eater!  (He's 1).  I, too, adjusted this recipe to include diced onions, carrots, garlic, and celery and added the Rosemary & Thyme.  I substituted cheese for the breaded topping - hubby doesn't like breaded topping.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe is WONDERFUL! Very fast ans easy to put together and yet tastes SO very good. I followed the recipe to a Tee except sprinkling a few dried onion flakes. The whole family & company had seconds and thirds. They are still talking about how good it was. Thank You!
UPDATE: I can't say how many times I have made this recipe now. My family is constantly requesting it for dinner. My kids have friends that ask if I'll make it when they come over because they all loved it SO much. It's a MUST TRY recipe!
Thanks again!

This is total comfort, fall fare.  Everyone likes this dish and it's super easy to make.  I actually just buy a chicken at Costco and cut it up, the flavor of the chicken is great in the casserole.

This was delicious! Hearty and rich, and very easy to make! I used 3 chicken breasts because that's how many I had, and I doubled the noodles because we like them. It had a great flavor as written, did not need to add anything else! Hubby rated it as "a very good choice": high praise. :)

This is a no fuse, prepare in advance meal. I prepared this Sunday night. I added fresh mushrooms and some frozen veggies and cooked for about 45 - 50 minutes Monday after work. I actually split the original in half, and froze part for another week. The family enjoyed.   The 3 stars may not be a fair rating however that is only due to the fact that I prefer "from scratch" and cassaroles in general do not appeal to me. It makes an enjoyable yet simple meal.

Excellent comfort food!  I doubled the egg noodles, and added sliced carrots and broccoli florets.  Next time will increase soup by 1 can to accommodate increase in noodles and other additions.  But it still came out great.

3 stars only because I added some extras as per the suggestions.   if I did make changes it would have tasted only like cream soup. I shredded the chicken instead of cubing it. I used cream of broccoli and cream of chicken soup, 12 oz wheat egg noodles, 1 small can of peas, some leftover steamed carrots, 3/4 cup milk shredded cheddar as the topping and about 2 cloves of garlic.   It had a nice creamy body and the topping was yummy!

I'm so happy I found this recipe!!  I poached 3 frozen chicken breasts from Sams, used 2 cans of cream of chicken (no cream of mushroom), sliced an 8oz package of mushrooms in thick slices and added a big handful of frozen peas. Salt and pepper generously.  We really enjoyed this and it's sure to become a favorite in our house!

I added broccoli and used canned chicken instead of the real stuff - maybe those were mistakes because I was not impressed.

I don't understand why this recipe received such a high rating because it's very bland as it is currently stands and the reviews discuss everything that they added to make it decent.  Even with some milk, peas and minced garlic added, it was a pretty boring dish.

I like to use the roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup sometimes.  I also always use those pepperidge farm colored goldfish on top(my three year old loves that!).  I often add broccoli or another veggie to make it a one dish meal.

Loved this recipe!! The only changes I made were using 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of the 1 can of mushroom and chicken. I also used 1 packet of Panko Parmesean and herb crumbs for the topping which I highly recommend. My boyfriend who is an extremely picky eater absolutely loved this. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this last night, delicious! I did change it up a bit by using low fat sour cream and fat free soups, but still came out awesome and creamy. My fiance and I agreed it was one of the best. I also added a little onion and garlic that I sauteed in olive oil, and some sprinkles of thyme and dried parsley. Next time I'm using some broccoli too. Oh yeah, the easiest part was using rotisserie chicken breasts. Very easy!

This was a good recipe for a busy night.  I added about three cups of shredded zucchini and opted to use bread crumbs instead of crackers to top it off.  Thanks for the recipe Dawne.

I think this ok, but a little sauce heavy.  I used only 2 chicken breasts and shredded them with forks.  It was plenty of chick in the dish.  I also added a 4 oz can of mushrooms and used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom.  Oh, and I used fat free sour cream - just to lighten it up.   What I would give 5 stars is the crumb topping.  Very good and gives the dish a little something extra.    This dish tastes a bit like a tetrazinni- not a bad thing but I'm not sure I'd make it again.

This was very very good!! Even better the next day I think. I made it with cream of mushroom and roasted garlic soup bc thats what I had instead of plain. I also added thyme, garlic powder, and onion powder to it. Instead of cutting up the chicken i shredded it using two forks so there was more chicken in every bite. We loved this recipe and it is so quick to make!! Thanks for sharing!!

Very good.  I tweaked it just a little though, I poached the chicken with 3 chopped cloves of garlic a tablespoon of salt and some fresh ground pepper.  Fished out most of the garlic before boiling the noodles, and rather than crackers just some bread crumbs.  My oh so picky sister in law even enjoyed it.  Go Me!  Will most def be making again.

As written, this is a four star recipe, with definite five star potential.  Following the advice of others, I boiled my egg noodles with a bit of chicken broth added with the water.  I sauteed some fresh chopped up carrots and celery and cooked those while cutting up the chicken. I also used 98% fat free soups and light sour cream.  I made it in the morning, covered and refrigerated till I got home (added a half cup of 2% milk to add a bit of liquid, mixing it in well) and baked at 350 for 35 minutes.  Fantastic

this was really good....even better the 2nd night. The only changes I made were adding a bag of frozen broccoli and adding a little onion, garlic,and salt free all-purpose seasoning to the mixture before I added it to the casserole dish. I bet this would be good too if you substitute the chicken with fresh tuna steak. I'll try that next. Thanks for sharing Dawne. This is a keeper!
This is now my second review for this recipe. It is a dish I make every couple of weeks. It is so versatile that you can add any frozen veggie or chicken or fish. On it's own it needs seasoning, but it's easy to add whatever flavor you desire. Also, you can use all reduced fat/f.f. soups & sour cream and you still get a good, creamy dish. Love it!

I used low-fat soups and my family loved it.  They actually thought it would have been better with less chicken.

2nd go we decided it could use something extra, maybe pimientos or something.  I used whole wheat egg noodles, too.

This was very good (and very easy)  I boiled chicken breasts in water seasoned with some onion powder and stalk of celery sliced thin.  I added some extra seasonings to the soup mixture and also added the celery slices to the mixture.  I do think next time I will use more cracker crumbs, like maybe 1 1/2 cups total and leave the butter amount the same.  Topping was a little wet and sparse with only one cup.   Great recipe, I will make again!

I didn't have any cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup, so I added southwest pepperjack soup and cream of potato soup instead. Was very good, next time might replace potato with celery tho. The pepperjack added a little zip that gave the casserole a better flavor.

Great casserole (but not for a dieter).  A good base for experimenting too.  I added some mixed veggies, mushrooms, sauteed onion and garlic.  And mushroom soup with garlic, chicken soup with herbs

This was super easy and very fast to make.  I made it the night before and just popped it in the oven when I got home.  I took other recommendations and added 1 small diced onion, 1 tsp minced garlic and 1/2 tsp of thyme.  I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out delicious.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this one last week and the whole family ate it plus leftovers. I added Brocolli, as other reviews suggested. I added cheese on top instead of into the mix. I just wasn't thinking. But even still, it tasted great and plan to make again.

This was really good! I made a few changes to make it more flavorful though. I sauteed onion and garlic to mix with the "sauce" and added some chopped cooked bacon and some peas. Although I did boil the chicken and cook the noodles in the chicken water like the recipe calls for, I don't think it's terribly necessary, and will probably just sautee up some diced chicken separately from the cooking pasta. Oh, and one other change I made was to use panko crumbs instead of butter crackers for the topping. It was great!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made my own additions:  used 10 chicken tenders (still think it could use more), 1/2 chopped onion, 3 chopped garlic cloves, mushroom soups only, 2/3 cup frozen mixed vegetables, a full stick of butter and wheat club crackers.  My husband raved and was glad when I told him there was plenty more, and he's not a big casserole guy.  This would be a good "comfort" casserole for taking to new parents or after a funeral...quick, easy, & tastes great.

This is a great starter recipe. Like other reviewers, I made a few changes. It needed some more flavor so added dried onions, minced garlic, & a pinch of dried rosemary & dried basil. I also pan-cooked my chicken breasts & left them on top of the recipe instead of mixed in. Lastly, to make a little healthier, I used sprays of olive oil instead of melted butter for the topping. It was a big hit!

Didn't think I'd like a canned soup casserole for fear would be bland or too salty, but lo and behold was great (admittedly w/couple changes)! Used 4 chicken leg quarters, boiled, shredded, then added to soup mixture w/ 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of celery soup, garlic powder, sour cream listed in recipe, ital seasoning, and finish w/ 1 can of peas. Came out as amazing baked pasta dish (used penne). Lots of flavor and ital seasoning really brightened dish. Definite repeat for all at the table tonight!

This is great comfort food.  I sometimes add garlic powder, onion powder, and red pepper flakes for added flavor.  I also incorporate broccoli for color & nutrition (I typically throw it in with the noodles while they boil).  The kids & husband love it.  I might start doubling the recipe so I can actually have leftovers for once.

This may have been just okay if I hadn't added the butter cracker topping. It had such a wierd rich taste, I just wanted to throw up.  I threw the whole thing out.

This turned out nice.  I halved the recipe for just me and my husband. I also litened it by using fat free cream of mushroom soup (didn't need the second can due to reduced servings - might try the fat free cream of chicken next time for flavor change). I also used lite sour cream as well as 1/4 C Italian breadcrumbs instead of the buttery flavored crackers, and therefore only 2 Tbsp butter. I WOULD suggest diluting the soup with perhaps 1/4 C milk or even chicken broth as the mixture seemed a bit on the thick side and I would like it thinner by just a tad.  Otherwise, excellent recipe which I will be making again as I keep all these things on hand!

this is my first review!!    my mom would make this casserole without a recipe...just threw whatever she had in the dish!   -i cooked a diced onion in some baconfat over low heat (to carmalize them).  -i added some minced garlic, chopped mushrooms, and fresh spinach to the onions to sweat them a bit, and added it to my noodle/chicken mixture -i also used buttermilk instead of cream or skim milk (along w/ the soup and sour cream) this one will be a winner! :)

Delicious!  I substituted the cream of mushroom with plain cream and I poached the chicken in a half/half mixture of water and chicken broth and the chicken just exploded with flavor. This is really a great recipe!

This recipe was so good and easy! I did make a couple small changes... I added a package of frozen mixed peas and carrots to the noodles while they cooked, and sprinkled some grated swiss cheese to the top before putting the cracker topping on. It turned out amazing!! My husband loves it as do I. Its even good cold. :)

This recipe was a big hit and definitely one that I'll make again.  I made the following changes to make it a little healthier: I used yogurt instead of sour cream and also mixed in some cheddar cheese with the rest.  I also put in a bag of cooked broccoli, and topped it all off with more cheese and bread crumbs. (I omitted the butter.)

This recipe is easy and as tasty as *you* want it to be. Meaning you can add whatever veggies you like. It's a great comfort food. I just added a little milk, not measuring, so it would be creamy and not dry or too runny. I also only baked it for 20 min which was sufficient. My husband however didn't like it but he's very picky to begin with.

I made this yesterday and my husband could not stop raving about it. I omitted teh sour cream, and cracker topping. I sauteed chicken breast in EVOO and seasoned the entire dish with garlic pepper and onion powder and cayenne pepper. I put the whole thing in the oven and baked until it looked done and it came out pretty good. Thanks!

this was really good. I added some grated swiss cheese that I had on hand to the casserole. I also tossed in some peas. I added leftover parmesan cheese to the topping as well as a little garlic powder and parsley. This was also good the next day.

I ate so much of this i feel sick now! I pretty much followed the recipe as is except for a few minor things. I added a onion, carrots, celery, bay leaves, and some peppercorns to the water i boiled the chicken in. I also added broccoli and Paula Deen's house seasoning to the casserole. I didn't have any ritz so i used seasoned bread crumbs. This was really good! It didn't taste like i expected it to though. after tasting it I think instead of the broccoli, peas would be a better choice. I will definitely make this again, but most likely when i already have leftover chicken. I buy my chicken breasts frozen so it was a little time consuming.

It was pretty good, I would definitely make again! I didn't change anything, but next time I will just crumble butter crackers on top as I'm serving so that the rest can be free of mushy crackers when they become leftovers.

I should probably not even review this b/c I made so many changes - but with the changes it was so good! I added: 2 cloves minced fresh garlic, used 2 cans cream of mushroom (no cream of chicken), 1 cup of skim milk, 1/3 cup mayo, 2 tbsp dry minced onion, 1 large can sweet peas, 1 8oz. block of cheddar cheese (shredded and mixed in), of course the sour cream and 2 tsp of dry onion soup mix. BF loved it, and so did I.

This was excellent! I was hesitant to use the canned soup, but after it was baked you couldn't even tell. I also added frozen mixed veggies and only 3 chicken breasts. Will make again.

So far, I have made this recipe twice. The first time was exactly as written. Yummy. Very yummy. Creamy and delicious. The cracker crumb topping makes this dish. So good. The second time, I made a few changes. First, I used rotisserie chicken from the supermarket. Secondly, I cooked some finely chopped carrot, onion, and celery in some chicken broth. When it was ready, I added some water and tossed in the noodles to cook. I also added some leftover cooked broccoli. The last addition was to put some cubed Velveeta on top of the dish before I added the topping. Delish. This is a five-star casserole however you make it.

I made this for dinner last night.  It was excellent.  I used a whole can of cream of mushroom soup instead of a half, and added carrots, celery, and peas.  I also put a little bit of velveeta under the cracker crumbs. My hubby ate this up!!  Very yummy!

Great recipe, Dawne, thank you!! I did a few things different (sauteed chicken with 1/2 cup diced onions, and a jar of mushrooms). I cooked the egg noodles in chicken broth - and kept everything else the same! This is wonderful comfort food...I am eating it for breakfast right now, and my twin 4 year olds (who are very picky) really enjoyed this! This one is a must...and a keeper!

I usually sprinkle a little garlic powder into it and use a large package of cream cheese instead of sour cream.  We also use Club crackers instead of Ritz.  My kids love this!

In addition to my previous comments, I used the Campell's Cream of Mushroom with roasted garlic.  I believe this my be a new product which gave the casserole a little extra kick.

Good way to use up leftover rotisserie chicken.  Tastes just like chicken with pasta but nothing super spectacular.  Real quick preparation.

Used leftover chicken from a roaster I did the night before- probably good with leftover turkey as well...I used more like 10 oz whole wheat noodles, and it was plenty moist. I also added a tablespoon of dried minced onion, and about 1.5 teaspoons of cajun seasoning. We are not cracker fans, so I sprinkled with seasoned bread crumbs and a bit of parmesan cheese (next time I will leave out the cheese- it just wasn't quite right- maybe cheddar?)- all-in-all, a solid recipe liked by my whole family, will do again.

This recipe is so easy and it tastes sooooo good. I add about 1/2 tablespoon of Mrs. Dash to the water when poaching the chicken and I leave it in for the egg noodles and it just adds that something something to it. This one has been a hit with the hubby (a man who knows what he likes) since day one.

Was a great opportunity to use leftover chicken for me. Chopped up a cup or two. I also used less butter to save a couple calories. Next time I will try adding some veggies as others have suggested.

Very Creamy and a true comfort food.  I put cream of celery instead of chicken and it tasted great.  I took the other reviewers advice and added garlic powder and onion powder it gave it a good flavor.

I'm not a fan of chicken so for me it was only ok. The 4 star rating is because my husband liked it.
I used a left over rotisary chicken rather than plan breasts. I think it would have been a little too bland otherwise. I also added some peas and carrots. I'm sure it will be a repeat recipe.
Thanks

This Casserole was pretty good. I used double the egg noodles (whole wheat) and I cut up the chicken and cooked it in a skillet with 8oz of sliced mushrooms and an onion. I also added a can of cream of celery soup and 2 cups of defrosted frozen broccoli. I seasoned the whole thing with Emeril's essence (as common as s&p in our house. Before puting it in the casserole dish I added a bag of shredded cheddar to the mix. We chose not to do the crackers on top since we don't care for them much. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Overall I thought it was pretty good and very easy. My husband loved it.

This is a simple tasty weeknight dinner. Basically the same as the tuna casserole my mom used to make, but it's a nice change with chicken. I added a few splashes of white wine and used panko bread crumbs instead of crackers. I think it would be great with some cheese and brocoli added in too.

It is a good base to add onto with other stuff such as veggies and spices. In my opinion it tastes better with tuna.

The only things I did differently were to cook the chicken in the skillet with Lawry's and garlic powder.  I also added a little bit of French's onions to my chopper when I was crunching up the crackers.  I sprinkled a little bit of cheese on top of the chicken mixture before topping with the buttery cracker mix.  My husband and daughters absolutely loved it!  It was a big hit at our house and I am sure we will keep this one around! Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe!!!

This was really good.  The only change I made was to season the chicken with onion powder and garlic salt and then brown it in a skillet with butter.  The kids had seconds and thirds! However,  not for those of us watching our weight!!!

I read the review others had written and I ended up adding one can of mushrooms, a small onion finely chopped, and half a package of shredded mild cheddar.  It was delicious.  My husband wasn't thrilled with it, but he is the pickiest eater in the world.  All three of my kids loved it - ages 10 yrs and twins 16 mos.  Serve with fresh fruit for a yummy, easy meal.

I really expected this to be better than it was.  I think IF I ever made this again, I wouldn't use both Cream of chicken & cream of mushroom.  I would definately leave the sour cream out.  I think that may have been the problem.  We have lots of left overs which I plan on having my parents try to see if they like it.  Thank you.

This is a pretty good base recipe, I made a few minor changes.  Instead of poaching the chicken, I baked it with some garlic salt and poultry seasoning.  I chopped it into bite sized pieces as the pasta cooked, and added some pepper and herbes de provence to the soup mixture.  I only used 3 tablespoons of light butter to saute the cracker crumbs, and they came out wonderful.  Thanks for a lovely recipe!

Very good recipe and super easy to make.  I actually put my chicken to cook that a.m. in my crock pot....so when I got home I had plenty(for other uses also).  Very easy to throw togther and yummy!  The only thing I changed was using the Healthy Choice line of the creamed soups instead of the full fat ones and it was great.

Very tasty, and was well received by my family.  I do think it could benefit by some fresh herbs, but that is probably just me.  

Update: In making this a second time I added some garlic powder and some onion powder and my family went ga-ga.

The only changes I made in this recipe was adding Peas and Carrots, and my husband and I found it to be pretty bland. It definantly needs more spices, It was okay but not worth the time it took to prepare, I will not make it again.

I didn't have any crackers for the topping so instead I put it into a 13x9 dish, poured the melted butter on top, and spooned 12 biscuits on top. I also added a little garlic to the soups. It turned out to be a very good dish. Even my picky 1 1/2 year old devoured it!!! Very good. Thanks a bunch!

This was really easy to make and my picky kids loved it! The only thing I did differently was added some cheese before I put on the crackers. It was yummy, thank you for sharing!

Oh my goodness! Thanks for sharing this recipe. It was a hit at my house. My family don't do casseroles but they ramped and raved about this one. This is a real keeper!!

I made this as written and it was very good.  It's a great starter recipe.  You could add just about any veggie to this and it would go fine.  Thanks for a classic

I didn't love this, but my hubby gave it rave reviews, that's why I gave it 5 stars.  He's pretty picky.  I added some garlic salt and onion powder to it before I baked it (in a 9X9) pan, and I still found it to be lacking something.  I'm not a huge fan of poached chicken, so maybe I'll brown the chicken next time and see if it works out to be a little tastier to me.

I made this meal for a new idea for my household with two full grown men and a little girl whom are picky eaters. It turned out to be one of the best dinners they couldn't get enough and neither could I. I definitely give this meal 5 stars or even better.!!!!

This recipe was very good.  I used no yoke noodles, light sour cream and 99% fat free soups and it was still delicious.  I did take the advice of other users by adding a bay leave and chicken boullion to the water.  I also added parmesan cheese, a little milk and garlic to the soup mixture.  I topped it with cheddar cheese and seasoned breadcrumbs.  Total keeper!

Nice meal on a cold day. I used 2 can of cream of chicken and it turned out just like a recipe called chicken crunch but plus the noodles. Adding the noodles made it go a lot further. My family liked it with the noodles but I think next time I may just put them on the side.

I didn't think this was all that bad but my husband was hazing me the entire dinner!  My 5 year old liked it, my 3 year old hated it, and my 10 month old ate it (compared to unsalted, blended green beans he thought it was the bomb).  I added frozen peas and steamed broccoli.  It was just missing something.  I think it has potential but I'm not a great cook so I can't figure out what that is.  Thanks anyway.

Recipe turned out very, very good.  It was a tad bland, but I must say this was a change up from usual chicken casserole, and there was none left.  Would fix again!!!!

I want to say in the beginning that I read the first five pages of reviews on all the changes people made to liven up this meal.  That being said, it was just eh. The chicken was flavorful but I guess my problem is my family does not eat food like this.  No one liked it and we had a ton of leftovers. It was very heavy and not very good.

One of the very first recipes I learned to cook while I was still in college, and I still make it even though my cooking abilities have greatly increased.  I like to add some broccoli and onion.

I made this last night for my husband and 2 friends, and they all loved it!  I used plain bread crumbs instead of crackers (because that's what I had), and I think I'll continue to do, except I'll season the bread crumbs next time.  Other than that, I really wouldn't change much at all.  This was a perfect size meal for 4 very hungry people!

As other reviewers suggested I doubled noodles and added some peas and corn. However, in doing so, it made the dish a little dry. I don’t know why I didn’t think to double the soups!  I also agree with the other reviewers who said that something was missing. This dish was a little too bland. If do make this again, (depending on how the leftovers turn out) I might try adding some garlic. One last thing: The Ritz crackers on top were definitely the best part of the dish!

This was good. Followed the recipe and just added pea's and carrots. It was pretty bland, needs more seasoning. But, its pretty good. Next time i'll add something else, as it seemed like it was missing a few things.

After I started making this, I realized I did not have any sour cream, so I just added about 1/2 cup of milk to the soup mixture instead because that's all I had.  I thought it turned out good anyway.  I will make it again with sour cream and see if there is a difference, but this is a really yummy recipe!  Thanks!

Very good meal.  I added broccoli and a little bit of milk to thin out the soup mixture, but followed the rest of the recipe as directed.  Everyone thought it was very good.  My husband wants me to add some cheese to it next time -- but I'll will make this again.

Thank you! This recipe took me back to my younger days when Mom was making dinner with leftover chicken, noodles, and soup from the pantry.  I added a cup of peas, as many suggested.  I also used bread cubes with dabs of butter instead of the crackers.  I found I didn't need nearly the amount of butter used with the crackers, and it turned out perfectly!  Thanks, Dawne!

My very picky family enjoyed this okay, but I thought it was a little boring.  Most certainly a weeknight meal when you are only cooking for your own family.  I even took the other reviewer's suggestions adding peas, paremesan cheese, and my own idea of lots of fresh ground black pepper.

Absolutely wonderful!  My whole family loved it.  I couldn't decide if I should add the 1/2 cup of milk that the others mentioned for not.  So my hubby said to split the difference and a 1/4 cup.  I did and it was perfect, very creamy.

Pretty good stuff...the only change I made was cream of potato soup instead of mushroom and I added some milk.  Even my VERY picky toddler ate this up. Worth making and I will make again.

Very good.  It was a little bland.  Instead of using cream of chicken, I used cream of onion.  Next time, I will add fresh broccoli.

This was a very good dish.  I used a whole "farm-fresh" chicken and 24 oz of egg noodles, followed the rest of the recipe.  The recipe needed something else, possibly peas would be good.  Thanks for a yummy dinner! :)

My whole family loved this...as well as a friend who stopped by for dinner!  I used 2 cans cream of chicken soup and no mushroom soup.  Added a few more crumbled crackers, but they were soda crackers.  I used 8 ounces of egg noodles.  Will definitely be making again and again!

I made this recipe with fat-free sour cream, 98% fat-free cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup, light butter, and whole wheat egg noodles to cut a lot of the fat content out and it turned out great!  I used more than one cup of crackers on the top to give it a little more flavor too.  I will definitely make this again!

Oh my goodness! This is comfort food at its best.  I just stumbled across this recipe and I am so glad I did.  I accidently purchased creamy chicken noodle soup instead of cream of chicken soup but I used it anyway and it come out great.  Also, to save time, I cooked the chicken in the crockpot while I was at work and then boiled the noodles in chicken broth.  I loved this recipe - can't wait to make it again.

Added 1/3 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the sauce, only used 3 tablespoons sour cream, didn't have cream of chicken soup so I added 1 cup of milk instead, used saltine crackers instead of butter crackers.  Turned out very tasty, but a little bit dry.

This is absolutely delicious!  I used a store-cooked chicken, and sauted fresh mushrooms and added them to the dish.  Also put a layer of shredded swiss cheese under the crumb topping.  It was a perfect dish for a very chilly spring evening!

Most of my family enjoyed it, including me.  I did make a few changes to it.  I only used 1 can of soup and to the cracker mixture I added a little garlic powder and some oregano for flavor.  Also I mixed in about a cup of cheese to the noodle and chicken mixture.  It had a great flavor and was not too soupy.

This was a quick and easy recipe...I doubled the amount of noodles, cut the amount of butter in half and added a layer of cheese before the cracker topping.  I may follow other reviewers advice and add a can of milk to make it a little creamier.  Thanks for the recipe

mmmmm.  I loved this recipe!  Tastes very similar to a casserole my great great aunt used to make for me when I was a child.  I have never been able to find anything close to her recipe till this one!  I know she used bread crumbs instead of crackers, I'll tweak it until I can duplicate her taste.  
Definately a keeper!!!

My family really liked this recipe.  I cooked my chicken in butter & garlic.  I also added a little milk to make creamier & I put fresh mushrooms in it.  I love the cracker topping, it gives a good texture & flavor.  Definately will make this again.

Ok, I read all the other reviews on this recipe and really thought about not making it for dinner. I am so glad that I did. My husband and I both loved this! I did not think it was bland at all. It is so simple and so easy to make, I am sure this will be made often. In fact, I am going to give the recipe to my father in law so he can make it!

Extremely easy...I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of potatoe instead.  Totally interchangeable. And I used regular saltine crackers instead.  The bf had no complaints.

this was just ok, but needs some work. i added some mushrooms and peas to this for something other than just chicken and noodles. if i make it again i will definitely add some sauted onion and garlic as well because it just needed that certain *something*, otherwise it is a little bland, even with as much pepper as i put in it (but then again, i love things to have more flavor, not mild flavored). i also might add the tiniest bit of milk to it (and i do mean a tiny amount, probably less than 1/4 cup) because even though it came out creamy, the leftovers are a little too thick.

This was just okay.  My kids didn't care for it at all.  It was very thick and I added a little milk before putting it in the oven.  I used whole wheat egg noodles and reduced fat/sodium soups.  I don't think that could have made the difference between an okay meal and a great meal.

Awesome recipe. I used fat free soup, 'no yolk' egg noodles, & fat free sour cream and it tasted great, you'd never know it was semi-healthy.  I also topped the casserole with Pilsbury dinner rolls instead of crackers. 
This will definitely be a recipe I will make often.

We thought this was very good.  The only change I made was I added garlic and onion powder to the chicken after it was cooked and cut up.  I also probably had 1 1/2 cups of cracker crumbs to the 1/2 cup butter.  Next time I'll probably add a few more noodles, but definately a keeper.  Wonderful for a chilly fall day.  Cracker crumbs made the dish.

wonderful,with a few changes. Poached the chicken with bay leaf and smashed garlic, then shredded after it cooled.  Used 16oz sour cream and omitted mush. soup. Once used bow tie pasta and it camr out great. Add some dried minced onion. Everyone raves over this comforting casserole!

My family really loves this casserole. When I get 
"This is delish mom" out of all three of my boys I have a winner. The only thing I did different was used spagetti noodles. This is a big keeper in my book. Thanks Dawne.

This recipe was terrible, sorry. There was nothing that I could do to make it better. I think that the sour cream should be omitted and celery soup should be added. I would never make this again.

Another easy version of your basic chicken-cream of chicken-pasta recipes.  Very easy to make but a little plain.  I used low fat soups, more noodles than suggested and a 9x13 pan and had plenty for leftovers.  I will make again and use mushrooms like other reviewers suggested.

This is the best noodle casserole I have ever made or eaten.  My family loved it!  I added a layer of sliced Velveta cheese (more calories, but the children loved it).  I will definitely make it again.

Excellent on the "Toots" scale. I added diced onions.  Will also add diced celery and possibly carrots next time.  This was a hit with everyone, including the fussy eaters :)

Very easy to make, little time needed. However, I found it took a very long time to cook the chicken to the point where the middle is no longer pink. I find if you microwave it for about 5-10 minutes prior to poaching, it will cook more thoroughly, faster.

I am not a great cook at all and my husband will agree! However, this was the easist meal to prepare and it did not take very long. It's only me and my husband and lets just say the whole dish is gone already because we ate half last night for dinner and packed the other half for lunch! Thanks Dawne, my husband and I really enjoyed this dish!

My husband and I thouht this recipe was pretty good, however, my kids didn't care for it much.  I tossed a couple of chicken boullion cubes into the cooking water, as well as a little onion powder, garlic salt and dried parsley.  To cut back, I used reduced fat soups and sour cream and no yolk egg noodles.  I thinned the sauce a bit with a little skim milk and omitted the salt since I cooked the chicken and noodles with the boullion cubes.  Finally, I added baby peas to the mixture.  Topped with a layer of cheddar cheese and then a layer of Ritz cracker crumbs (doubled the amount).  Not bad.

Tried this last night - my whole family loved it!  I substituted low sodium/low fat soups, reduced fat sour cream and no-yolk egg noodles, and it was still great. Definitely a keeper.  At my husband's request, I may substitute boiled pierogies for the egg noodles next time...

I made this last night.  It was good, but it needed something else.  Something to make it a little more savory. Maybe some milk in place of half the sour cream would have been helpful.
