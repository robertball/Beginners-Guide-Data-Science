This was an easy-to-follow recipe that turned out very good!  I followed it as written, though I did give it a few minutes under the broiler at the end.  I will certainly add whatever other veggies I have on hand in the future.

I left out the bread crumbs and garlic. Roasted at 425 for 30 minutes and they were perfect. Also I added mushrooms and asparagus. Great!
