This recipe is PERFECT!! My only changes were to add a dash of vanilla and used what I had on hand for ingredients i kept the measurements the same! While baking it I also didnt stir it at all! I just simply let it bake took it out let it cool and broke it up! Delicious! It had nice and chunky clusters!

Excellent recipe - a few tweaks - used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, added a splash of vanilla, and mixed in my almonds and coconut at the 10 minute mark.  This recipe is a keeper!
