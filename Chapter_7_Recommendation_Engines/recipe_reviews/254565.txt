Blueberry Spinach Protein Smoothie Haiku: "Pretty tasty shake, but I had to add some stuff. Dude, I love spinach!" I will put spinach in just about anything and don't care if the flavor is masked or not. If I had to have bedding made of a food, I would sleep under a blanket of spinach. And it's summertime and me and my girlies just picked a ton of blueberries. This smoothie was an easy-gotta-try this a.m., and while I made it exactly as written, after pouring the first glass, we didn't like the texture, so back in the blender twas dumped. Added a few slices of frozen banana and that helped, but it still felt like the consistency of Pepto Bismal (far from the color though phew) so I added more banana, some ice cubes, splash of almond milk and another handful of blueberries. YES, now we have smoothie success. But as written with the ratio of berry>spinach>protein powder, it just didn't jive.

It did not make sense to me not to add liquid so I made up the protein powder as directed with water and soy milk.  I also added a banana because I was worried I would taste the spinach and it was AMAZING!

I made this and wasn't crazy about the texture when made as directed.  I just didn't like the texture of the blueberries peelings in this shake, even after blending it well in my Ninja.  However, I swapped in a cup of vanilla and strawberry go-gurt and it was much better.  My seven-year old loved it with yogurt.  I can't believe she drank something green!
