Incredible! I did make a few changes: used 2 bananas white SPLENDA blend cream instead of evaporated milk 1/2 & 1/2 instead of low fat milk & sugar-free White Chocolate instant pudding mix. OK so it's no longer "light " but WOW.

Used real brown sugar and banana pudding mix. Threw on some marshmallows to garnish and it was pretty good!
