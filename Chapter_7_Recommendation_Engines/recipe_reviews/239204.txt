This is a very simple dish using food you would most likely have available in your pantry. I was curious about what the balsamic vinegar would do. It seemed like a lot of seasonings so I just sprinkled them lightly over the chops after coating them with the vinegar. My pieces were not really thick so that's why I adjusted the amount. These turned out tender, not dry, and very tasty. I will probably make these again.

I tried it as in the recipe tonight, but found the basil too strong.  I also didn't care for the tomatoes - but then I don't care for baked tomatoes.  I will probably make this again because I like balsamic vinegar and pork and it is super easy to make, but maybe use a mixed Italian herb seasoning instead of basil.  Be warned, this is pretty salty, although this was fine for my husband!

So easy and soooo good!!! I substituted organic basil and oregano instead of the dried bottled seasoning.

This was so tasty! My kids loved it too... I just cooked one with no tomato for the child who doesn't like tomatoes. Very easy to make. Definitely will be making this again!

I liked the hot spicy taste, but it may not be for everyone. The pork chops had an "Italian" taste to them though. This recipe is a great alternative to serving pork chops using either BBQ sauce or mushroom soup.  The young grandkids found it too spicy, so next time I will go much lighter, or even leave off, the spice mix on a few of the chops destined for them.

I prepared half the recipe for just the two of us.  It was easy, but I've tasted many pork chop recipes I liked better.  I probably won't be making the recipe again.

This was a wonderful change from our typical rotation of BBQ and breaded pork chops. Presentation, aroma, texture, and taste are all very appetizing. Because of another review I hesitated to use all of the herb mix on the chops, but I used at least half of it.  I did not have tomatoes so I placed 2 slices Italian Stewed Tomatoes on each chop (no extra liquid.)

These pork chops were easy and delicious. My husband raved about them.  I used small steaks with the recipe too and they were just as good.
