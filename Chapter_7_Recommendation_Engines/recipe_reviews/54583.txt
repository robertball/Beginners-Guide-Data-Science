Though I found this to be somewhat bland, my kids looooved it.  I doubled (or more) the paprika, and I used half a tablespoon of minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  The recipe doesn't specify how much oil to use, and I felt I needed quite a liberal amount to keep it from sticking.  I served it with wild rice, but I think I will try it with white rice next time.

I used a frozen veggie medley instead of the separate carrots, peas, corn and beans. Swapped brown (a little healthier) for long-grain rice and added a medium potabella mushroom. Ole!  We really enjoyed this recipe.

to add more flavor you MUST use saffron. since saffron is sometimes hard to get, just substitute saffrn flavored rice ! its way good!

Three stars. This was ok as written. It’s not really a paella seeing that the vegetables are sitting on top of the rice. It’s quite bland, too. I ended up adding a jalapeno and nutritional yeast and tossed it with the rice. With some adjustments, it could be a five star recipe easily.
