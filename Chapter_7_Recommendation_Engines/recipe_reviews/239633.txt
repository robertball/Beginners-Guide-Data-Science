This soup is "souper" easy and quick to get on the table. It seemed lacking in flavor though. After I cooked it for 20 minutes and did a taste test, I ended up adding onion flakes, onion powder, and just a little sweetener to balance the acidity.

I added a lot more garlic and red pepper flakes, a potato cut up really small and some kale. I also just boiled and shredded some frozen chick beasts I had. I think it made all the difference. Really easy!
