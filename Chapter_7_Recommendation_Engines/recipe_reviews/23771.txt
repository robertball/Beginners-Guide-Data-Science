This recipe is great EXCEPT for one huge mistake: The amount of pumpkin in the original recipe is TWICE what it should be.  Other reviewers say to double the spices; the fact is, to make one pie, jut halve the amount of pumpkin and you'll be fine.  Two cups of pumpkin works out to the contents of a single sugar pie pumpkin.

This recipe is OK, except that you need to double all the spices, except the salt.  Plus, I don't know how deep the author's pie plate is, but I made two 9" deep dish pies from this recipe.  If you include the time needed to bake the pumpkins, this is not quick or easy.  However, getting the kids in on doing the mashing is fun.  I like the texture of this filling a lot, it is firmer than most others, less custard-like.  For that reason alone, it is worth taking the time to use fresh pumpkins and make this.

This recipe is fast and easy.  I ended up using canned pumpkin for this one, and it turned out fine.  Make sure you use a deep-dish pan, it makes a lot!  Needless to say, I am a beginner at cooking, but this recipe still made a great pie.

If you want to use FRESH pumpkin instead of filling from a can, THIS RECIPE is the BEST!!  We baked the pumpkin, scaped into a food processor, blended, then put in freezer ziplock.  Once that is done, the recipe is a breeze.  And OH SO DELICIOUS!  My husband could've eaten the whole pie himself!

Thanks for sharing, Paula!  What a wonderful taste this pie had.  Nothing like the store-bought pumpkin.  My grandmother made it the same way, but she separated the egg whites and folded them into the pumpkin after whipping them into a froth.  She always got a very light texture.  Guaranteed to be a hit during the holidays.  We've already polished off two of them.

I'd never cooked with fresh pumpkin before, so I was very nervous about this recipe.  I used a few shortcuts, including store-bought crusts (I used graham-cracker crust instead of regular pie crust).  I used what I thought was a medium-sized pumpkin, but I ended up with WAY more pumpkin flesh than I needed.  I also had more success processing the whole mixture in a blender than with a potato masher.  Halfway through cooking, the cookie sheet holding my 2 pies slid off the shelf when I opened the oven.  I scooped the pie filling back in (no way was I wasting it after all that effort), and continued baking.  They were kind of ugly in the end, but they tasted heavenly.  My husband (who didn't prep the pumpkin) has asked that I make it this way from now on, instead of using canned pumpkin!

I too doubled the spices (specially the cinammon) and also added vanilla paste (1/2 tsp) and an extra egg.  The sweetend condensed milk comes in a smaller size in Canada (300ml) but that provided ample moisture and a great pie.  I used my Braun hand electric chpper to puree and whip the filling which was a snap.  Yummy.  Was a great hit at our Cdn. Thanksgiving dinner.

Fabulous pumpkin pie!  I made 4 of these pies for Thanksgiving... 2 of the pies with canned pumpkin and 2 with fresh pumpkins; the fresh pumpkin won hands down. This recipe if out of this world. I will be using fresh pumpkin for my pies from now on. I used 2 cups pumpkin instead of the 4 cups the recipe calls for this was the perfect amount. I added a pinch of extra spices and I would also recommend baking the pie crust by itself for about 5-7 minutes before adding the filling. I bake and cook a lot and I am very picky when it comes to giving high ratings. However, this recipe gets 5 stars from me and my family. Thanks for a fantastic pie.     Happy Thanksgiving!

Wonderfully creamy, a sweet taste of pumkin and spices. But I use a larger dish since mine is not deep (and cooking time is around 15 minutes longer).

This recipe was excellent, real quick and easy, the only thing that is time consuming, is the pumpkin cooking and mashing. Worth the effort though, the results were great, be sure to serve it with a generous dollop of whipped cream, definitely a crowd pleaser. Thanks for the recipe!

I read most of the reviews before I made this pie. (Had some pumpikns left over from halloween) I followed the directions EXACTLY. I don't know what anyone was complaining about. I used the 4 cups and it made 1 deep dish pie. Let me repeat ONE deep dish pie. This was the first pumpkin pie I ever made and let me tell you if I could kiss you I would it was that darn good. I have added it to my list of holiday pies. I don't think I can live without it now that I have tasted it.

Based on other reviews, I cut the pumpkin back to two full cups. I made no other changes. I baked it for 15 minutes at 425*, then another 30 minutes at 350* covered halfway through with foil to keep the crust from burning. Pumpkin pie perfection. Very simple.

I have been making this pie all through the thanksgiving and christmas seasons, I got awesome reviews from my "tasters"  I do feel though that the cinnamon needs to be doubled and possibly could add a dash of cloves.  But even without the cloves it is one fantastic pie and I will continue to make this recipe til I am an old woman!

I always use fresh pumpkin to make pie, and this pie was just so-so.  My family wasn't real excited about it, and asked that I use my standard recipe instead from now on.  I did double the spices though, I couldn't imagine how bland it would have been without doing that.  I didn't care for the sweetened condensed milk either.   I'm glad that more people are using their pumpkins though, instead of throwing them out.  Fresh pumpkin is always better than canned, and its better for you as well.  Remember though, that without the preservatives, the pumpkin will get moldy faster, so make sure you use it or freeze it  after you bake the pumpkin.  I freeze mine in 2 cup increments.

Double the spices and this is an amazing pie.  I made it with the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipes and it turned out fantastic! It's definitely enough to make a full pie and a half (easily two if you adjust the amount in the first).

Very creamy. Loved it and so did everyone else who ate it.  My husband does not normally like pumpkin pie but ate this pie with cool whip, of course.  Not at all runny like other recipes I've used.  Did not have to seive out extra juice from pumkin.  All that extra work was cut out.  Thank you!

Excellent pie that is healthy enough to eat every day!  I subbed acorn squash for the pumpkin and, although I will cut the nutmeg a bit next time, it was great!  Nobody knew it wasn't real pumpkin and it's a good way to get rid of squash picky eaters won't touch.

I added an extra egg and doubled my spices like everyone said to and it did fill 2 store bought 9" deep dish pie crusts.  This was the best pumpkin pie I have ever had.  Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this recipe!! My only criticism is that there we we weren't  enough spices. i added cloves but the measurements aren't strong enough for me. In most cases I am not a huge pie fan, I always find them too sweet and almost sickening but this was just sweet enough!!!! came out soooooo tasty!!!  a huge hit with everyone! we also used a white pumpkin for this. I don't think that makes much of a difference but I thought I would add it.

Good pie.  I only used 2 and a half cups pumpkin puree, and substituted 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice for the spices (but added an extra shake of cinnamon), I also added 1 tablespoon flour to the filling.  I find that the blender works best to puree fresh pumpkin; it's really pretty quick & easy that way.

Ah, so delish! To my family, pumpkin pie has always been mediocre at best: the dessert that is only present at Thanksgiving because of its indelible status as a fall staple. A devout lover of all things pumpkin, I set out to change their minds about the power of this delightful orange fruit... and succeeded with the help of this recipe! It was my first attempt to make a pie from fresh pumpkin, and this recipe turned out beautifully... it has such a different texture than canned pumpkin pie. It is lighter and fluffier, less dense, more natural tasting and a different kind of sweet - the kind not achieved by syrups from a can. I used  Nilla Wafer pre-made pie crust, but this was only a practice run for Thanksgiving and I plan on making my own pie crust next time. This was a smashing success - recommend to anyone! Baking the pumpkin seems like a lot of work,  but it actually doesn't consume that much time and it's kindof fun. Only thing I would change - I think it needs more spice. If you like a milder pie, stick with the amount in the recipe, for a more traditional, cinnamony, gingery pie I would increase it a bit.

I've never had a fresh pumpkin pie recipe until I tried this one.. WOW is that good! I won't go back to canned pumpkin pie! I did alter the spices to my taste, so before you bake it you may want to taste it. You can't go back once you bake it! I also pureed the pumpkin and froze it. It was a nice treat again this spring when pumpkins were out of season! Thank you for putting the recipe out there!

This recipe is great! I had to bake mine for 20 minutes longer.  I steamed my fresh pumpkin then pureed it in the food processor.  I used a 9" deep dish glass pie plate and it was Full!  The taste was great and the spice was perfect quite an easy recipe.

I found this recipe b/c I was looking for a way to make pumpkin pie w/o pumpkin spice.  Such things are challenging to find while living abroad!  But I think this is the best pumpkin pie I've ever eaten.  It simply dazzled my taste buds!

I'm not a big pumpkin pie fan (nor is my fam) But since i had bought some sugar pumpkins for decorative purposes almost 2 months ago, I decided not to waste them & WOW I'm glad I didn't throw them into the woods!!!! My whole fam r huge fans now, the spices really nailed it (after adjusting to 2 1/2 cups pumpkin since others said 4 cups was too much) This will be a new tradition in our home!  Thanks!

My grandfather told me this was one of the best pumpkin pies he has had in a while. I used fresh frozen pumpkin in this and it does make a difference no more of the canned stuff for us =) Thx for the simple and yummy recipe.

This has become one of my family's favorite recipes during the holidays.  I bake the pumpkin and then use this recipe to the exact measurement.  PERFECT!  HOWEVER - I do make TWO pies instead of just one.

I followed the recommendations of some of the other reviewers....and doubled all the spices and then used two pie shells, which were actually Marie Callendar frozen crusts.  All I can say is that the pies were delicious.  They had a fresh wonderful texture and I recommend the recipe to anyone using fresh pumpkin.  My family loved it.

This is a great recipe for fresh pumpkin. I pureed my baked pumpkin in the food processor, then let it sit overnight to drain some of the liquid out.  The full recipe of filling fit perfectly in a 9.5" glass pyrex pie pan.  It's got a really nice texture, although I like my pies a little sweeter and may add a touch of sugar the next time.

Hello All!

I thought this was an excellent basic pumpkin pie to start from.  Changes I made are as follows:

- double the spices (at least :)
- added All Spice
- used Maple Syrup and Whipping cream instead of Condensed Milk

Everthing turned out great!!  I think the reason I like this recipe though (especially in October) is that it advocates starting from real pumpkins.  Yea for fresh food!

Ciao

Freddy

This was the first time I've ever made any kind of pie let alone a pie from scratch.. it was amazing.. I will never buy store bought pie again! I'm not even interested in trying the canned pumpkin to make pie.. I am freezing pumpkin puree so I can keep trying this.. I would maybe double the spices next time but I like a little more spice... so thats just me... its awesome!

I wasn't sure that it would work with just two eggs, but I guess that's why the title says "creamy"; the texture turned out less dense than your normal, store-bought pie. I forgot the ginger and I used whole milk and powdered sugar instead of the condensed milk. My husband claims it is the best pie I have ever made.

This is an amazing recipe! Definitely heed the warnings of the other users and use only two cups of pumpkin for one pie.

My husband was raised by his grandmother and grandfather on the farm. There is no pie like granny's except this one... yahoo.. I added a cup of sugar only because I started another recipe before I found this one.. and it turned  out fantastic. I used the four cups of pumpkin and dumped the cinnamon in as we like it with extra spice. It was a real hit on the Canadian Thanksgiving table.. thanks a million for bringing granny back to us...

I made this for Thanksgiving this year & it was a hit.  I followed the previous review to use half the pumpking & that was the perfect ratio.  Defenitely need to use a DEEP dish crust with this recipe.

I was in a rush and didn't read the reviews. I baked it for over an hour! Lol  If you use 4 cups of fresh pumpkin (much higher water content than canned pumpkin), you need to double the spices. You'll have enough for two pies at the recommended baking time.

a pumpkin plant mysteriously appeared in my garden this year and yielded one small pumpkin.  I baked and pureed that pumpkin today and using two cups of pumpkin, made this recipe.  I followed it exactly and OMG...it tastes just like restaurant quality.  Just the right amount of spices and sweetness.  Thank you so much for sharing this (and others for their tips).

I made this recipe as directed with the exception of using 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (I was out of ginger) which provided great flavor, and cooking the pumpkin in the microwave (scooped side down with water).    I used all 4 cups of fresh pumpkin and it was wonderful ........... maybe the food processing fluffed it so that it wasn't dry or heavy.    I also baked the pie for stated amount of time: crust wasn't burnt and filling was perfect.  My kids loved it so much that my 5 year old has been requesting it in her lunch.    Great Recipe!  I am making it again tonight for my work party AND my husband's work party tomorrow.    I highly recommend it.

Loved it!  I planted "Valenciano" a white pumpkin, in the spring, and it gave us the pumpkins we used for our Jack-O-Lanterns.  Instead of just throwing out the flesh, I baked it and then whizzed it up in the blender to get the puree to make this pie.  I only used 2 cups of pumpkin puree and it filled the 9" pie pan perfectly.  My 1st attempt at a pie with from-scratch pumpkin and it was awesome.

Loved it! You just need to cut the pumpkin down to 2 cups and leave the rest as the recipe says.
My neice wanted me to make a 'new' pumpkin pie for the holidays and this was a BIG hit on both Thanksgiving and Xmas. Never thought a skinny 10 year old girl could eat a whole pie in a day, but with this one they can!

The best pumpkin pie recipe ever! I made it with 2 cup of fresh pumpkin and froze the other 2 cups for Thanksgiving.  I don't know if it's the fresh pumpkin that makes this pie so good or if it's the recipe, but it is now my favorite pumpkin pie recipe. Thanks!!!

I am no beginner to baking but when I went to see if I could find another recipe seeing as mine got lost in a fire I decided to try this one out and even with the pumkin being double what you need and the spices being for a single pie it came out very good. I think I may try doubling the spices the next time and see how it is.

I hate using fresh pumpkin and I vowed to never do it again!  When I served this pie to the inlaws they were so impressed.  I even heard from my father in-law that this was possibly the best pumpkin pie he has ever had!  Now that's a compliment.  I shot myself in the foot and have to make this pie from fresh pumpkin every year.  I didn't have any nutmeg so i used ground cloves in place of it.

This was really good following the recommendations here. I baked the halved pie pumpkins at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes and the outside peeled right off.  Then I took the pumpkin and  used a hand mixer to make it into baby food consistency.  I did double the spices which was perfect and poured into two regular crusts rather than 1 deep dish.  My husband is a huge fan of pumpkin pie and he loved this very much.  A huge hit!

I Loved it,and so did my whole family! I bended all the ingredients in the blender, it worked great for me. Since I cooked a lot pumpkin I experimented and realized 4 cups of pumpkin will fill 1 9inch pie pan that you crust yourself, or 4 cups will fill 2 9inch precrusted pie pans,

This pie was delicious!  My first attempt at making pumpkin pie went amazingly well and turned out great.  For the crust, I used the recipe "Easy to Remember Pie Crust" which is also very easy and tasty.

Awesome!!  I used to have a cookbook that had this recipe and I loaned it and lost it.  Finally found this one and my daughter wants it every year for her birthday-instead of a cake (her birthday is Christmas Day, so I usually have to make 3 or 4 and this year, everyone wanted this recipe!!! Thank You!!

Thanks so much for this recipe!  I always love to carve pumpkins for Halloween and then use the pumpkins for pies for Thanksgiving and this is the best recipe I have found.  It's easy too!  The only thing I change is that I double the spices, and it adds just the right amount of flavor.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks Paula!

My pie crust shrank when I prebaked it, so I halved the recipe for the filling. Really really good recipe and I got rave reviews from family. This recipe is a keeper!

This pie was such a hit for Thanksgiving that I am making another for Christmas. I did not need to change a thing! As it clearly states this recipe makes a DEEP DISH pie. Also, the quality of the fresh pumpkin will really make a huge difference, so make sure that you use a good quality sugar pumpkin or pie pumpkin. Make sure your pumpkin is well drained and i like to pulse the pumpkin in the blender or a food processor before adding-- this heightens the creaminess!

I took a small pumpkin that came from my father-in-law's farm and baked it, let it cool and removed the skin.  Not wanting to push it through a colander, I used the grinder tool attachment on my Kitchen Aid.  I put the pumpkin through the grinder and then put it in my food processor. It was perfectly smooth.  After that I followed the recipe with two additions: 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 cup sugar. I tasted the mix and felt it was not sweet enough.  Perhaps it was my pumpkin?  So, I added the sugar.  It filled a Pyrex deep dish pie container.  I cooked per directions and had to cook about 10 minutes more.  Other than that, it came out perfect.  My husband said it was the best he ever tasted.  The kids loved it!  This is definitely a do again.

Perfect! It was perfectly sweet- not too sweet even w/ the cool whip! YUUUUM! 

After reading some of the comments I knew to double the spices, but I also doubled the eggs and milk (I used one can evaporated milk and 1 can sweetened condensed milk.)...MISTAKE! It was too much liquid! So I added the rest of the pureed pumpkin almost another 4 cups and then not quite double the spices again and 1 more egg. 

I filled 2 pies and poured the rest into 2 quart-size freezer bags to freeze/thaw and bake at my leisure.

The bake time was very long for me...my oven does not have a thermostat so I kind of eye-balled it. It took about 1hr and 15 minutes total, but the result was Great!

Thanks for sharing!

We really loved this pie! It is very yummy and easy to make with fresh organic pumpkins. I added ground cloves, pumpkin pie spice and was generous with my teaspoon measurings. Each time I made it, it turned out very well. We ate it at thanksgiving and again at Christmas. Top with cool whip or whip cream.  Definately worth trying! Thanks for sharing!

Very nice pie! I used a tip from "Cindy's Pumpkin Pie" and used melted vanilla ice cream instead of the condensed milk, as it's hard to get where I live. It made too much for my only shallow pie dish, so I'm trying to find a way to make mini pies with the left overs. Served it for Thanksgiving dinner, and it got rave reviews from all - some said it was way better than any store-bought pie they'd tried! :-)

This is a good basic pumpkin pie recipe.  I also cut down the amount of pumpkin to two cups because I wasn't using my big glass pie pan.  If I were, I might leave it at 4 and see what happens!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good.  I too only used 2 cups of pumpkin puree and the flavors turned out just right.  I made my own pie crust and baked it for about 10 minutes before adding the pumpkin mix.

THE BEST that I've tried so far. Using fresh pumpkin makes a huge difference, I find. 

As per other recommendations, I used 2 cups of pumpkin rather than 4. It still made a lot, so I also made a walnut/butter/brown sugar topping for one of the pies, adding it before lowering the oven temperature. 

I've had several people look at me with their eyes wide with amazement upon tasting the pies, several of them having first told me "oh, I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie..." Thanks so much for this! It's a keeper!

I was expecting this to be more of a chiffon-type texture b/c of the word "Creamy" in the title, but it seemed more like standard pumpkin pie.  I didn't have the time to roast my own pumpkins, but this turned out well with canned.  People are writing about making two pies out of it-- the 4 cups of pumpkin (or 2 cans) will fill one DEEP DISH pie crust, or presumably two regular (shallow) pie crusts.  Good classic pumpkin pie!
UPDATE: I used a fresh pumpkin this time (a "pie pumpkin" from the grocery store).  I cut it in half, and roasted it cut-side down on a baking sheet for about 30 min at 400.  The skin peeled right off!  It made about 3 c. pumpkin, so I used 1 c. canned. It was better than canned pie!  I had to mash the pumpkin with a spatula through a colander, though, to get out any stringy lumps, but it was worth the effort.

This is a great recipe for a traditional pumpkin pie. A FEW CHANGES:  I went with 2 cups of fresh pumpkin since 4 would have been WAY too much for 1 deep dish pie, and also had to put only 1/2 the amount of condensed milk (1/2 a can) or it would have gone runny.  Make sure to get SWEETENED condensed milk - i missed that detail and as a result I am adding sugar to every slice of pie.  Delicious though!

This was very good... I followed the advice of other reviewers and added only 2 cups of pumpkin... it filled a 9" deep dish perfectly. Also, since I don't really care for regular pie crust, I used a graham cracker crust instead. It was delicious!

This pie is awesome!  I only used 2 cups of pumpkin, as suggested by a previous reviewer.  It filled my 9" pie crust perfectly, and came out with a lot of flavor and very good texture.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This pie was hands down the best pumpkin pie i  ever tasted.
Be warned thought=, others are correct the amount of pumpkin called for in recipe is too much for just one pie.  I used fresh pumpkin but the exact amount of canned pumpkin (15 oz) and in came out perfectly.

I just 2 cups fresh pumpkin like she calls for and a can of Libbyâ€™s pumpkin. I did the rest of the recipe the way she said except I put all ingredients in a blender. It made enough for 2 pies.

We used fresh ginger - but the only alteration! This recipe worked great for us as is.  Itâ€™s super creamy and better than most pumpkin pies.  It was easy enough for my seven-year-old to do on her own.  It did seem to take closer to an hour at 350 in our oven.

Iâ€™ve been making this pie (with a few tweaks for years, & Iâ€™m mystified about the comments saying itâ€™s too much filling & not enough spices. I do add a cup of brown sugar, 2 t of vanilla, and an extra T of cinnamon, along with 1 t of cloves.

Excellent recipe for fresh pumpkin pie. It makes quite a bit- it filled my 10" pie plate to the brim and took 1 hr 30 min to bake. We like the spices and sweetness to be subtle so this recipe was perfect for us. Also, I did substitute heavy cream + solid raw honey (7 oz of each warmed on lowest flame 'til blended and thick) for the sweetened condensed milk, due to a chronic kidney condition that responds very badly to refined sugar in anything.  For whatever reason honey doesn't distress my kidneys, but I still miss all my sugary sweet stuff and dislike having to leave the crust behind!  In any case the family enjoyed the creamy texture and fresh pumpkin taste so I guess this is the new go to.

Creamy and Delicious! Baked it this weekend with my nephew. We made eight 5" mini pies. The only change, in addition to spices called for - we added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. Will do again.

This recipe it wonderful just as it is. The secret is fresh pumpkin! When you use fresh pumpkin you don't have to use more spices. The flavor is delicious. And yes, you have to have a deep dish! Wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing!

When I write that "I made it," I actually mean that my caregiver made it, that I sat and watched and participated in the cooking and that we both enjoyed (or not) the final product.

Ms. Holmes made it, only to double the cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, as others had advised. I came here to find a traditional, creamy pumpkin pie and was extraordinarily pleased with this recipe with the doubled spices. Yes, you could (happily) taste the cinnamon and there was a lingering aftertaste of nutmeg.

Pumpkin pie must have a certain smell to be enjoyed on the tongue. I don't like the (Southern?) tradition of slamming a fresh pie into the fridge and eating it cold - too many people do that and get a quizzical "is this sweet potato or pumpkin pie?" That's an insult to both pies - I think that pumpkin (and sweet potato) pies should be served slightly warmed - or at least at room temperature - and, for goodness sake, please don't adorn either with whipped cream!

This pie will, forever more, be one of our favorite treats for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Far short of a mousse but with a 'just right' creaminess. I will have to ask Ms. Holmes about the size of our pie plates - we did use the entirety of the pumpkin.

I seriously wonder if some of these reviewers actually MAKE the recipe before they review...I used 4 cups of pumpkin pureed in my food processor.  It fit well within a standard Pyrex glass pie dish. I took advice and doubled spices,  but this is merely a matter of taste. 
Maybe if you are using one of the more shallow store bought graham cracker crusts, then 2 cups may work. But follow the recipe as is, and you will create a wonderful pumpkin pie. 
Also,  making the pumpkin is as easy as cutting it in half,  de-seeding and then roasting it face down for an hour.  Once it cools the skin should slide right off.

I have looked for years for a good recipe that works well with fresh homemade processed pumpkin. This is it. Beware, it makes a huge pie. Use on old, deep dish pie pan from grandma (or buy it at the thrift store).

Instead of using the individual spices, I used two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, which  is basically the same.  Was a big hit for Thanksgiving.

My go-to pumpkin pie recipe! I halve a pumpkin, place the halves, cut side down, in a shallow roasting pan. I add water to just cover any gap between the pumpkin edge and bottom of pan. I roast at 400 degrees for 50 minutes.  Carefully drain the pan, upright the halves, and make your crust while they cool. I use "Boiling water crust II" found on this site! Awesome pie!

My 10 year old son requested a "real" pumpkin pie. I'm not much of a cook and this still came out perfect! He was a happy boy! Thank you

I did change the recipe (even though I hate it when people do that), but I used about 2/3 can sweetened cond. milk because it was just tasting too sweet, added an extra yolk because my eggs were small and I heard yolks prevent cracking, and doubled the spices and it was incredible!! Mostly I needed this recipe to figure out how to make the pie from fresh pumpkin because in Italy they don't have canned pumpkin. Simple now I know, before I was super confused.

Everyone loved it despite never tasting a pumpkin pie before (and I consider myself an expert because I love them so much and I thought it was spot on, best I have ever had), one person even said "I see why Americans are crazy about their pie."

Thank you for helping me bake some home away from home.

I gave this 4 stars because it used fresh pumpkin, however I agree with other reviews...double the spices. It did set well, and made a nice sized pie. I used the French Pastry Pie Crust recipe from this site, which was perfect for this...a nice slightly sweet crust.

We grow pie pumpkins every year and freeze for use throughout the winter. Most recipes call for store bought canned pumpkin, which is much drier. This recipe is perfect for fresh. I didn't have any sweetened condensed milk so first found a recipe and made that too.

Great recipe. My only change. The amount of pumpkin is twice what you need, which is fine since all premade crusts come in pairs so I just doubled the spice and made two pies.

Easy and delicious.  I put everything in the blender, poured it in the crust, and popped it in the oven.  The sweetened condensed milk makes the custard a bit sweeter than I am used to for a pumpkin filling, but it is rich and flavorful.  I will make this again because it's so easy and tasty.

This was sooo good! The amount of pumpkin called for does indeed make enough for two pies, so I doubled the spices. I took one to work, and people just LOVED it! This is going to be the recipe I use for pumpkin pie from now on!

This was a hit for thanksgiving in my family.Only complaint is that i think that it would always be good with more cinnamon so I didn't add any salt and I only added cinnamon instead of any other spices.

Was okay.  Seemed like it was missing something.  I did double the spices and baked 2 pies, but even my hubby said that it needed butter or sugar.  Wasn't sure which.  Maybe next time, i'll add it and update my comment.

This was my first pumpkin pie.  I used the 2 cups of pumpkin as a couple of people suggested and 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed.  My husband, who grew up eating pumpkin pie, loved it.  This will be the recipe that I use from now on.  Thanks for a super easy and delicious recipe.

We used a deep dish pie shell and it was way to light on the spices. This is even after we doubled the spices. The texture is great,kind of light and fluffy, but lacked flavor. We would use 4times the spices indicated. I know that sounds like a lot...but it really had a weak flavor.

Great use for the pumpkin from our jack o lanterns!  I added a 1/2 cup brown sugar, and since I didn't have nutmeg, I used a little all spice, I also doubled the cinnamon.  Great recipe!

This pie is worth the extra effort!!! Every year I bake every pumpkin we get in the fall ,then I purÃ©e all of the pumpkins in my blender and store it in freezer bags with 4 cups in each bag so I can make pies whenever I want. I double the spices and make two pies out of the mixture. This recipe makes the best pumpkin pies I have ever tasted!!! Goes great with graham cracker pie crust.

Somewhat time consuming recipe, especially if you are making your own pumpkin puree and pie crust,  but totally worth it for the flavor and texture.  My only changes would be to add a bit more spice. Also, using a deep dish pie crust is advisable!

My daughter and I make this for Thankgiving.  The recipe could not have been easier. We followed it exactly but added 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and canned pumkin.  The pie was light and fluffy and delicious.  We will use this pumpkin pie recipe from now on.

This was the first time I had attempted pumpkin pie. I used fresh pumpkin baked whole and pureed. I did use suggestion of double spices and found filling just right for one pie.  My family loved it including a VERY picky 3 year old.  I will definatley be using this receipe again.

Similar to another recipe I used a couple weeks ago. I used 3 to 4 teaspoons of PUMPKIN PIE SPICE to replace all the other spices and I ended up using about 2 1/2 cups of mashed pumpkin. Last time I felt like it could have been a bit sweeter so I added a bit of honey to the mix. YUM YUM

This recipe is so easy to make and the taste turns out to be excellent. However, I must say that the reviews speak for itself. I followed the recipe religiously and I found out that the pie was dry, the 4 cups is way too much for the 9-in crust and it will be probably make a difference if more of the spices will be added. I have another 4 cups left and I am planning to put butter on it the next time. I found another recipe from a popular chef and I want to make the adjustment myself but overall this recipe is so easy for me.

I followed the instructions for "Pumpkin Puree" found on this site for a 1 kg pumpkin.  Then I used the "Butter Flaky Pie Crust" (I can't find pre-made crusts here in Germany) and followed the recipe of this recipe with the addition of 1 cup of brown sugar.  The only problem I had was that the bottom of the crust was not baked all the way through so I had to return it to the oven at a high temperature to finish cooking the bottom.  I covered the pie with aluminum foil so it wouldn't burn.

I did initially cut the recipe by 1/2, due to the other reviews.  I use a 10" pie pan, I then made the other 1/2.  If you're using an 8" cutting it is fine, any large pie pan and you have to use the full recipe and double the spices.  This has to be the easiest pie recipe I've ever seen, bar none! This is a true totally homemade Pumpkin Pie that I will use over and over.  Thanks so much for sharing!

When I made this I halved everything, spices included, and it still turned out great. Maybe next time I'll try just halving the pumpkin, and see if it's even better!
