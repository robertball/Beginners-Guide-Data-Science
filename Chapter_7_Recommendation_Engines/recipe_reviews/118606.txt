After reading the previous review about not being able to taste the Ranch, I modified as follows:  Cook pasta according to directions.  Melt 3 T of butter in large pan.  Add a minced onion along with the chicken.  Cook until browned.  Add a can of drained corn.  Cook until all the water evaporates - if the corn browns it tastes a bit nuttier and sweeter, as if roasted.  Add 1 tsp of thyme and 1 T parsely.  Stir in 1 C. of Ranch dressing.  Add a pkg. feta cheese. -- Next time I'll change the cheese, perhaps to parmesan.  The feta was a little too strong for the kids.

I added mushrooms, red pepper and onion to the chicken mixture. I mixed the chiken mixture in with the pasta and sauce. I used parmesan rather than feta and it was good!  Will make again.

I thought this recipe was really good. DD said it was ok but ate everything on her plate. I didnâ€™t find the feta to be too strong in this recipe. I ended up doubling the recipe to feed 8 and added more ranch on top of that. I also added an onion to the cooking chicken and mixed the pasta and chicken together before putting in the pan. Topped with bread crumbs and more feta than baked. This is a keeper!

I was looking for something to do with some left-over chicken and this recipe looked quick and easy. I had all the ingredients so I rolled the dice. Maybe with Parm and not with Feta, but, oh boy, I will not make this again.

I was surprised at how this tasted. I started combining the ingredients and thinking you must be crazy, ranch and pasta sauce. It was pretty good. I don't think I'll make it again because it took  a while to prepare and bake, but it wasn't bad for something new. I followed the modifications posted by the last reviewer. 1 cup ranch with chicken, 1/4 c ranch and 1 cup pasta sauce with noodles.

I sauted an onion in the chicken pan as well and added a cup and a half of mozza when I took it off heat in addition to using 1/2 cup of parm with the cracker crust. I used about two cups of four cheese ranch between what was mixed in with the pasta and what was drizzled on top. We liked this dish more than I was expecting, it's very tasty. I'll be adding it to my pantry dinner list. Thanks for sharing!

This was good - but i really didn't get much of a taste of the ranch.  I did change it a bit and added some parmesean cheese instead of feta.  It will be good for once in while as something different.
