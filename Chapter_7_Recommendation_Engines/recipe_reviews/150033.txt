this was great!  we made a few changes:  fresh chanterelles (1 cup), no cream, and double the gorgonzola. We used black truffle oil instead of white. Served with cabernet sauvignon, crusty bread and a salad, this was a gourmet meal. For the lazy cooks out there like me, 12 oz. of arborio rice is 1.5 cups, and one quart of stock is 4 cups.  Next time I will add a bit more garlic.

This was tasty, but I think that next time I will use all fresh mushrooms - the dried chantarelles overwhelmed the dish for me.

Fantastic flavor--the gorgonzola (I used blue cheese since I had it around) adds a subtle delicacy to it. Very fancy tasting. Any sorts of mushrooms could work with it. I used locally grown oyster, crimini and shiitakes, fresh. Added a bit of fresh rosemary with the cheese and skipped the cream.  Would probably use the cream in colder months, but in summer it seems too heavy. Definitely making this again!

Great recipe. I used what I had around the house so I will share my changes. No truffle oil (wish I would have) and no dried chanterelles. Instead I used portabellas. No gorgonzola cheese or cream but instead goat cheese. I also had some basil I had to use up, which added great flavor. It sounds like a lot of changes but really they are just near substitutions. Oh yeah, if you use homemade chicken stock like I did, make sure you have added enough salt.

I loved this recipe.  I followed it exactly.  It is time consuming, but so worth it.  I chose this one because it didn't require any white wine.  Thanks for sharing.  This tasted almost exact to some risotto I had at a Napa restaurant.

This is truly delicious! The combination of flavors is amazing!!! Five Star!! I did not have truffle oil, so instead I used a little bit of olive oil and more butter.

This was very good. i subbed in .5 oz of dried Chanterelles and .5 oz of dried porcinis. and instead of fresh white buttons i used fresh brown mushrooms i think they were Crimini mushrooms.   I agree with the other reviewer that fresh mushrooms would improve the taste. But it was delicious and got great reviews from my family!!!

I love making risotto and do it rather regularly.  I found the combination of flavors here to be exquisite. I was expecting the cheese to pack a more powerful punch but it balanced very nicely with the mushrooms. Well done!

Great recipe.  To lighten it up with all the great flavor, you can use fat free evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.

This was great.  I made it as directed except I didn't have any shallots and the package of dried chanterelles was 3/4 ounce...2 ounces would have been way too much for the amount of rice (and expensive, the 3/4 ounce package was almost $5.00!)  I found that 1 quart of broth wasn't enough and I ended up using about 2 more cups than called for. After tasting, I added another tablespoon of gorgonzola and cream. Perfect! If I make it again, I think I'll use mixed wild mushrooms or porcinis for a stronger mushroom taste and a little more truffle oil added after cooking.

what a delicious recipe! we used all fresh chestnut mushrooms, and used extra truffle oil at the end to enhance the truffle flavour even more (we're big truffle fans).  completely forgot to season it, and never noticed! yum. :)

I could not find the dried mushrooms or truffle oil,so I made it with portabello mushrooms instead.  It was still delicious!  I can't wait to try it again with all of the correct ingredients.

This was decadent and wonderful I would serve this as a small appetizer as it is much too rich to eat a bunch of it. This is going to be a new favorite for sure I didn't have the truffle oil but it was still wonderful.

This Recipe was wonderful.  We subbed goat cheese for the gorgonzola and doubled the truffle oil.  We had it on Valentines day as a side with Lobster and asparagus, best Valentine's meal ever.

I made this for dinner tonight along with some steamed broccoli.  The broccoli was a nice contrast.  I omitted the white wine since I didn't have any on hand, and used a mix of wild rice and 5 other types with some homemade dark brown chicken stock.  Mushrooms used were portabellas, morels, and some dried mushrooms (bought in bulk and I no longer remember the type).  Took longer to cook because of the brown and wild rice, but we enjoyed it!  I'd like to try this again with a nice venison roast...

I bought a tray of wild mushrooms from BJs, cremini, oyster and shitake, and I wanted a recipe that would highlight them. This did the job. I gave the recipe 5 stars because I think its a good one, but I think that I just don't enjoy risotto as much as I thought I did. For my own personal taste, I would give it about 3.5 - 4 stars -- don't think I will make again because I am too lazy! Also, the leftovers were kind of gloppy and not so appetizing. Again, not the fault of the recipe, just maybe I am not a risotto girl...I bought "Truffle and porcini infused oil" which was the closest thing I could find to "truffle oil" and I did not taste anything unique.

This dish was delightful! For those of you that NEED meat to feel like your having a real meal, here is the exception- it was delicious. A few notes though- I used more than a quart of stock for my risotto- I recommend keeping more handy just in case you do as well. I used fresh mushrooms (portobello and white) and they were perfect. The only real thing of note is that I don't think the recipe calls for enough truffle oil (I added some at the end as well) or enough Gorgonzola. I doubled the amount of cheese and my guests still topped off their risotto w more. All in all an amazing dish that I was glad was shared!

Served this at an Easter brunch and everyone raved about it - I added oyster mushrooms and a pack of dried/reconstituted wild mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes in oil and fresh chopped rosemary.  I didn't put in the cream, but it wasn't needed as it was creamy with the gorgonzola.   Delicious and I'll definitely make it again (and again).

Oh heck yeah -LoL!  Used brown rice which on it's own takes 45 minutes to cook, but with these additional Ingredients, mine took maybe an hour or more and required constant babysitting...So, I followed the ingredient list and instructions pretty closely, except did about 3/4 to 1 oz. Of the dried mushrooms as opposed to 2, and it was fine - also, no truffle oil...As we were making multiple dishes at once I was constantly checking on this, tasting and adjusting the heat.  Wasn't necessary to seperate the broth into thirds - added it all at once, and used the same amount as suggested for arborio...ended up with some Intentionally browned bits at the bottom that added a nice depth of flavor.  Added the cream, and sprinkled gorgonzola on top when served - when you bite into those little bits of melted cheese it is Heaven!!  This dish was reaaaally time consuming with all of the chopping and constant stirring and checking to get the right consistency, but I had company in the kitchen, and It turned out great. Served with sauteed vegetables on the side and Chef Johns Spanish Mustard Steak for a wonderful meal!

Excellent recipe with very slight changes.  I added dried and soaked porcini mushrooms (chopped finely) for the broth and I used a wide assortment of locally grown wild mushrooms instead of the chanterelles.  I also toast my arborio in a wok with a bit of butter before making risotto.

the dried mushrooms make the entire dish disgusting.  If you make a mushroom risotto do not use the dried mushrooms it ruins the whole dish.

Oh my,  I am in Heaven! I used baby bellas only as I couldn't find chanterelles. I couldn't find truffle oil, but I WILL find it next time! I omitted the cream (to save on calories), and doubled the Gorgonzola. Served with a simple spinach and strawberry salad. What a delightful meal. I can't wait to have this again!

I enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have any shallots or truffle oil (nor could I find on short notice), so omitted those. I also used beef stock instead of chicken and fresh chanterelles instead of dried. This took longer to make than I expected. I probably wouldn't change any of the proportions or instructions, thought it came out well.

I doubled the gorgonzola, as others did, and I also use orzo instead of arborio rice.  Very nice!

I used all fresh mushrooms, skipped the cream, and added double the Gorgonzola. It was a winner.

This recipe was mediocre at best. I definitely agree with other reviewers to stick to fresh mushrooms only.  It wasn't terrible, but it was nothing special.
