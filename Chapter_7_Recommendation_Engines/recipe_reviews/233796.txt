I made no changes. This is a gourmet meal. We had guests and they could not stop talking about the fantastic flavored. They wanted the recipe. If this is pot roast we don't need T-Bone steak.

Very tasty. It does take a little bit of time, but for my husband to take seconds on vegetables, it was worth it. Definitely will make again. I did take some of the au jus and thickened it to have more of a gravy.

Was amazing! I recommend Chateau Ste Michelle, Cabernet Sauvignon. I couldnâ€™t find Yukon Golden Potatoes, so I found the next best thing. Idaho Baby Dutch Potatoes. Was easy to make, just prep most of it before hand.

We adored this recipe. It'll go into the rotation from now on. The only modification I had to make (owing to the fact that I forgot to get the V8) was that I substituted beef broth for the veggie-drink. We loved it as was and wondered whether the V8 might make it too  salty. In any event, a real keeper.

I was stoked to try this recipe because I find regular pot roasts to be bland and boring, and I don't enjoy them, and the reviews made this sound awesome.  I followed the recipe to a T, and I found it to be just another bland and boring pot roast, with a bit more basil and oregano and a bit more work.  I won't be making this again.

If you're looking for a little variation from the traditional pot roast, this is a good one.  I kept right with the recipe, except by mistake I opened a can of crushed tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  Hence, I'm still giving a 5 instead of 4, since it was my mistake.  Tasty and tender but would have been better with with the right kind of tomatoes.

Event though the recipe states it can be done in a crock-pot, I would not.  It did not turn out well despite following the recipe.  I'm sure the normal prep method results in a better product.

At first glance it looks complicated, but, it is easy to make and really fantastic.  I did not have V8 so I substituted Tabasco Bloody Mary mix.  My family said they would like this "weekly".  Kudos for a great dish!
