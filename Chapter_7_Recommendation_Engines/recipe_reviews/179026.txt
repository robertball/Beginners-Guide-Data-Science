I added some of my homemade taco seasoning to the "sauce" for the chicken. I made little bowls of chopped tomatoes, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, sliced olives, chopped onion and reduced fat sour cream to top the tacos. I did not eat mine in a tortilla, I ate mine over lettuce as a taco salad. We loved this meal. Quick and very tasty!

Very simple and very good for a quick and easy weeknight meal!  My husband loves picante sauce so I had to give this a try and it turned out to be a hit. I lightly seasoned some chicken breasts with a bit of "Traci's Adobo Seasoning" from this site then grilled them. I didn't bother tossing the chicken in the picante sauce mixed with lime juice and chili powder, just added it and layered everything into the tortilla while the chicken was still warm. I used larger tortillas and Mexican blend cheese along with sliced black olives. Perfect with a dollup of sour cream!

Wow, this is very good. IL just changed the cihili seasoning. I used a partial package of taco seasoning because I was out of chili powder. The whole family really enjoyed them. Yes most certainly we will have these again. I served also salsa and cour cream for those who wished.  I also upped the amount of tomatoes, added sliced green onions and sliced black olives. Wow!!

This was wonderful!  Did the recipie to the T and it came out great.  The only thing I added to the table was sour cream and hot sauce, and that's just b/c I like it hot, and my lady likes sour cream.  I was worried that it wouldn't be enough food for us so I added a side dish of Pinto beans mixed with sauted green peppers/onions/garlic.  Wound up being a lot of leftovers, even after we feasted!

This was pretty good. I have also made a modified version with less liquid and canned chicken as an alternative to boring chicken salad.

I made this for dinner for my family of 4 (me, the hubby, and 2 girls aged 5 and 3).  It went over rather well, even my picky 2 year old ate it!  I really liked the lime juice - it was the key ingredient.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except I chopped up the chicken strips in the mini-chopper, so it was more like chicken salad.

Well...we are back to counting carbs again....good Lord...anyway...I made my own salsa (tomatoes, red onion, fresh garlic, jalapenos and cilantro) put the lime and chili powder in it, grilled the chicken, seasoned with salt/pepper, garlic and onion powder. I've been buying the mission low carb tortillas (they are wonderful!) and then just assembled them..TO DIE FOR!!!  Made us feel as tho we were CHEATING!!  I told the "old man" I will be making these everyday!!  Wonderful recipe....thank you...thank you!!!!

These were pretty good. I used taco seasoned chicken breasts, southwest salsa, and I added cilantro. Next time I would double the amount of salsa.
