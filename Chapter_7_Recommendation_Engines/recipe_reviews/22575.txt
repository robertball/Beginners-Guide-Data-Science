There were a few problems with the recipe.  The cake was lackluster and without baking soda or baking powder, it never got fluffy or stayed moist.  There cherry filling was also very uninteresting and could have had better flavor if you follow the recipe for cherry filling in betty crocker's cook book for black forest cake.  I'll submit my own revised cake recipe soon.

This was pretty good.  The almond whipped cream was the best part.  the only semi-complaint I had was about the intensity of the chocolate.  I like extreme chocolate flavor and this has a much mellower taste.  Just a personal preference, otherwise excellent!
