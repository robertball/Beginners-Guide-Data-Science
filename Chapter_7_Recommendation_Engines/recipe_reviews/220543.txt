My family loved these! We had them with Easy After Work Chicken and sour cream, these were really good.  I used fresh potatoes but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  YUMMY

I tried this recipe on a whim, as I am always looking for something new. I did not have to squeeze out any excess water and after a few patties I got the hang of it. They were delicious! My family loved them and I will cook these again and share this recipe with my friends. Thanks...
