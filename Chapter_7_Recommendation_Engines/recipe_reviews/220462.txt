The only changes I made were that I used currants instead  of raisins and I used 1/2 Tbsp of orange extract instead of orange peel.  It was a great tea bread!

Really liked this one, and I have made a lot of different  ones.  The whiskey butter, in my opinion, just takes it up a notch.

I used half the amount of whiskey, changed the flour to spelt flour, used soy milk instead of buttermilk, and honey instead of sugar.  All of the changes were for family preferences.  The bread is disappearing fast!  The whiskey gives a dimension of taste that makes this good!

This was delicious. I did NOT soak the raisins overnight. I wanted to make the bread that day. So I put the raisins in a microwavable glass bowl, added the Jack Daniels. covered and let it go for two minutes. Then let it sit covered for 15 minutes. I tried the  Whisky Butter, but didnt care for it.

Such a wonderful recipe. Best Irish soda bread that I’ve found. I made this just as the recipe stated with no changes. So moist and flavorful. The whiskey butter is a must. Love it!

This timed out perfectly ! Moist and delicious. I used grated lemon peel instead of orange and this gave the bread a pleasant citrusy note . Don’t like caraway seeds so left them out too . All agreed; best ever !

This bread seems more moist than your standard Irish bread. I hope that it keeps that way for a while, too. I baked it in a 9" round pan, sprayed with cooking spray, and it just slipped right out with no problem. I like the additional sweetness and it doesn't include eggs. I used the dry buttermilk, and it worked great here. My oven runs warm, so I checked it at 40 min, and it was already done (probably would have to toss it I went by the time specified). The butter compliments the bread nicely. I ended up using the full amount of whiskey in it; every time I added a tsp, I didn't notice much difference.  Happy St Patrick's Day!

Made this in a 2 qt round casserole.  It was delicious.  The family loved it and enjoyed every crumb. I buttered the corning dish and had trouble getting it out in one nice loaf.  Today I'll make again and use Baker's Joy.  That should take care of the sticking problem.  I plumped the raisins with bourbon in the microwave...didn't plan ahead to plump them overnight.  Used low setting.  Yummmm.

This was fast, easy and flavorful. If you have a round casserole dish, it makes a more traditional presentation. I also like to soak the raisins in whiskey and sugar before adding them to the dough for about an hour.
