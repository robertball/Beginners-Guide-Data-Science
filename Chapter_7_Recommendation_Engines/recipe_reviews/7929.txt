I followed the recipe EXACTLY!  The recipe states "No messy clean-up with this one. Just mix and bake in the same pan." This was NOT the case for me.  After combining the flour & cocoa mixture with milk in the pan it was extremely thick and did not spread well in the pan.  Added remainder of ingredients including hot water.  Recipe does *not* state to stir.  Chocolate mixture does not look cohesive in the pan.  Carefully placed in oven for 35 minutes.  After 10 minutes of baking filling overflowed out of the pan. (Yes, it smelled bad).  Decided to continue to bake until done.  There was *no* sauce to drizzle when I cut pieces.

This one is a keeper in our house.  It's so easy to make, I mixed it all in one pan as the recipe suggests.  This is a must have to wow unexpected dinner guests.  I didn't find it too sweet at all.  The ice cream melded with the ooey gooey richness perfectly.  Admittedly I let it sit about five-ten mins longer than the recipe said after it came out of the oven, but the amount of "fudge sauce" on the bottom was just right.  Thanks for this easy recipe to address those urgent chocolate cravings.

I have made this recipe for years - since I was in grade school!  It is a favorite of my family.  To the reviewer who felt it was really messy-you mix the cake then sprinkle the brown sugar/cocoa mixture on top and pour the hot water over and DO NOT STIR!  If it looks like it will overflow-just put a pan or a piece of foil underneath.  It is absolutely delicious with sweetened whipping cream or ice cream!

I used soy milk and almonds with good results.  However, I was surprised by how much fudge sauce there was at the bottom! The cake itself was pretty good, chocolate-y and without being too sweet, but with the fudge sauce on top of it? It became overpoweringly sweet for my tastes.  Ice-cream or sorbet on top of that? No way! 

I can see where kids would like it, but I don't think I'd make it again for adults without cutting back on the sugar. If you like super sweet cakes, you will like this one as is, but if your tastes run to the less sweet and more "tea bread" style, you aren't going to like it.

This is a VERY good cake! I just baked it according to the recipe and it turned out perfectly. You might want to add a pinch of cinnamon for a little extra zip. It was easy enough to make with my 5 year old daughter and my family GOBBLED it right up almost immediately out of the oven! I recommend.

Very good! My family recipe differs a bit. With only 3/4 cup flour, 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1 and 1/4 cup of hot water, and adding 1/4 cup of semisweet or dark chocolate chips to the topping!

Easy and simple recipe to put together and execute.  I didn't give it five stars because the cake had a bit of a baking powder after taste.  Defintitely serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream to cut the seetness.

Turned out well, I didn't have brown sugar, so tried it with white, it is NOT a change I recommend.  I didn't give it 5stars because I needed to add more milk to make the cake batter, but definitely a recipe worth repeating!

This recipe is similar to a recipe my mom used to make from an old Spry cookbook. It was called Easy Cocoa Pudding. The main difference is that the batter is mixed in a bowl and spread into the pan . The brown sugar and cocoa powder are mixed with boiling water and poured over the top. In my younger day before I was married with kids I ate a whole one by my self! It still remains one of my favorite desserts except that now I have to share!

yummy! you MUST try it with a scoop of ice cream!! it makes a huge difference. i have to admit i thought it was missing something when i first tasted it, but i think its meant to be that way so it can go nicely with ice cream. it will look uncook with the bubbles of sauce poking through here and there, but dont worry its suppose to be that way! enjoy!!

The cake tasted very good and chocolate-y, but I cut down on the sugar, 1/2 cup white and 3/4 cup brown sugar (not packed into cup just scooped). I recommend mixing the cocoa powder and brown sugar with the hot water first, then add to top of batter. The cocoa layer on top did not dissolve into the cake during baking, so it left many clumps on top. It was not visually appealing for a b-day party.

This recipe is very easy, i like the concept of it, and it's not bad. However, it's not good either. The main problem is that it's very bland, the taste is very...one dimensional. It's just...sweet. It seems to be missing something very important taste-wise, that i just can't put my finger on. Not bad, but not good enough to make again. Sorry!

Have made this for years, but called it Fudge Pudding Cake. Regardless of what you call it, it must be called delicious. The only thing I do differently is add a tsp of espresso powder to the batter. It really brings out the chocolate flavor. If you can find it, dark cocoa really adds an extra special kick for those who like dark chocolate.

If an option, I would rate this No stars. I made this tonight right after I read the recipe. Sadly, my family and I were disappointed. The "sauce" was ALL pudding and the only thing even resembling "cake" was the topping. Sorry, but I won't make this again.

This was interesting.  My daughter and I made it because we were craving chocolate.  It turned out okay, we ate some of it, but truthfully, 1/2 of it got thrown out after being in the fridge for several days.  I doubt we will make it again, it just wasn't our 'cup of tea'.

The name is a little deceiving, I think it's more a like a Brownie Pudding Cake.  It did taste great, I thought it might be super-sweet but it was enjoyable.  We served it with vanilla ice cream and I will make it again.  The 9X9 pan I used had to soak overnight, but today it was a simple clean up.

I was really hoping to give this a 5 star... I read it at work and it sounded delish!  I should have read a few more reviews and I would have seen that this recipe is clearly one of those you either love it or leave it recipes.  Our family found that the cake portion really lacked flavor while the hot fudge portion was really more pudding than fudge.  I'd still recommend trying to find out what your family says.  It's easy enough and doesn't waste a lot of expensive ingredients.

So happy to finally find this recipe. Made it many times, years ago. This has the sweetness and cocoa flavor I crave. I used a 8"x8" glass baking dish and it never overflows and comes out perfect every time for me.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Good base recipe, the sauce is lacking a lot of flavor, will try again with some adjustments instead of adding all water, going to try 1/2 water 1/2 milk (maybe some coffee too)and some vanilla and cinnamon on top. I baked in an 8x8 and it didn't overflow :)

Hot fudge sundae cake is pretty good. It reminds me of brownie pudding cake; a Better Homes and Gardens recipe that is very similar It definitly needs to be served with ice cream for the sundae effect. Its not fall-on-the-floor amazing but it works well when you need to make dessert for alot of people.

This recipe is perfect as is. I make it often. Here are some fun variations: to make it for a 9 x 13" pan, change the number of servings to 18. Works beautifully with self-rising flour, just omit baking powder and salt. My favorite variation - omit the cocoa altogether, makes a terrific caramel(ish) cake. When I go that route, I serve it with ice cream I have softened and added cinnamon and nutmeg to before re-freezing.

If you have never had this before, I would take a look at the reviews before you make it, just to get an idea of what you're getting. It is meant to go with ice cream...it's like getting a brownie hot fudge sundae when you serve it all together! I made this incorrectly the first time and it still came out well (I thought I burned it, but I think it just overflowed.) I did do some substitutions: I used all whole wheat flour, less white sugar in the batter, didn't pack the brown sugar, and didn't add nuts. I baked it in a smaller casserole dish, but I probably should have halved the recipe first. I would love to try it with some coffee mixed in like a few reviewers recommended. Very easy recipe for a dessert fix!

Love this, ive made a few times and I can honestly say it is my favorite cake recipe! It's so simple and quick, I can't ever imagine anyone mucking this up. I usually cut the recipe in half  so my fiancé and I don't go overboard into a chocolate coma, cause once made, we can't stop eating it! And I also use strong coffee in place of the hot water, so gooood! Like a mocha fudge cake. Thank-you for this. :)

The flavor of the cake was good, but it had a texture like quiche or bread pudding. If you like those kinds of food textures and chocolate flavor you will probably love this cake.

I made these with dark chocolate cocoa powder & omitted the walnuts. I baked these as cupcakes & ate with a spoon, They came out perfectly! I will have to use thicker cupcake holders though. Delicious! I love how the fudge goes to the bottom & the brownie cooks a layer over the top, interesting & yummy. The original recipe fits 12 cupcakes exactly. I call these Lava Brownies.

We loved it!  I used unsweetened coconut milk instead of regular milk since we have issues with dairy.  I also eliminated the nuts because of allergies.  It's perfect.

This recipe is great - however, I leave out the walnuts and call it "Upside Down Cake."

Just wondering why the recipe says at the top that it will produce 12 servings when the Directions clearly say that it makes 9 servings.   This is a keeper - quick, easy, yummy!

We call this recipe "Brownie Pudding" It is one of my absolute favorites! I make it when I have company or when I take a dessert to a friend's house and everyone who has ever had it LOVES it! (that is if they are chocolate lovers like me) :)
