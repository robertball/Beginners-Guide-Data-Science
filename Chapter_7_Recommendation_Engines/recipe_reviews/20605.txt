This was delicious!  It's an incredibly easy recipe.  I cooked this for my friends at college in a dorm kitchen, so you know it's easy!  I increased the ammount of cheese and I followed one reviewer's suggestion to only use 2/3 c. of mayo.  The only problem was that there was not enough of the garlic mixture.  We are garlic fiends!  I would advise doubling that section of the recipe for more garlic deliciousness.  I also added some oregano and pepper.  For those of you wondering about the mayo, this recipe does not produce mayo-flavored garlic bread.  You can only taste the mozzarella and garlic.  Once again, a fantabulous recipe and this will be going in my recipe book.  15 college kids give this recipe a 4.0.

Wonderful recipe! Although a tad greasy tasting for me,my family enjoyed t. The second time I made it, I cut the mayo to 2/3cup, and used finely shredded cheddar cheese (3/4c) in place of mozzarella.Thanks Holly.

I had to attend a party at my sisters and she put me in charge of garlic bread. 
She said, "I am impressed, you pulled it off, this is excellent."  There was not 
one piece of this Cheese Onion Garlic Bread left.  Everybody had three and four
pieces, they loved it so much.   Try it you will love it.  And it is easy,  ask my 
husband and son they made it.   :~)

I am updating my rating and review to 5 stars.  I just got back from a potluck.  I brought the bread over all assembled except not broiled or cut.  I used my neighbors over to broil and cut up the pieces of bread.  I doubled the recipe and there was not a SINGLE piece of bread left!  All our friends were raving about this bread.  

The only change I made was that I caramelized the onions, cooked for about 45 minutes and then I added the garlic for 4-5 minutes at the end.  Let the mixture cool and then spread it on the bread and topped with the cheese/mayo mixture.  Perfect!

This bread is very good but has too much of a mayo taste for us. I will try this again for sure but cut the mayo in half, because the overall taste, again, to us was mainly mayo. The onion/garlic mix that's spread on before the cheese mix is great. I chopped the onion very fine and added crushed garlic  to the butter mix and simmered about 5 minutes at medium low heat. Do not brown the onion mixture. The onion and garlic almost dissolved and became a part of the butter once cooled and it really is a wonderful spread. I will use this recipe again , but as written the mayo is very prominent. Thanks for sharing :)

This was excellent!  I used Italian bread and it worked very well.  I was out of mayo (which is a sin in this house), but it still tasted very good.  It was easy to make, but watch it under the broiler.  5 minutes was too much in my oven and it was slightly black, but still yummy - thanks!

This is a terrific garlic bread recipe!  I've been making garlic bread for years with our pasta dinners for my husband and I, but left the bread plain for the children.  They do not usually enjoy garlic bread but LOVED this one. Just a few changes: Used half the amount of butter, added olive oil for the remainder, eliminated onion (not a favorite of the kids), crushed whole cloves of garlic and sauteed them until golden, then removed them. Oil/butter flavored nicely. (I put the garlic on my bread later, yuuummmm! Just don't stand too close!) Had Monterey Jack in the fridge instead of Mozzarella, worked very well. The cheese/mayo topping really makes this bread extra special.  Way to go, Holly!   - - - Virginia

I'v emade this several times, and it's always been a big hit.  I modify the recipe this way:
I make it without the onion;
I decrease the mayonnaise to 2/3 cup.
I increase the parmesan chees to 2/3 cup (and sometimes I use a romano/parmesan blend).

Not a bad recipe but if you are not a big fan of grilled onions you probably won't like this one too much.  The grilled onion flavor really dominates this.  Plus it is very fattening, a whole cup of mayo and a cube of butter, yikes!  So I guess I'm still on the hunt for that really delicious cheesy bread recipe!

Good and different garlic bread. I used "garlic butter" also found from this site instead but still followed the mayo/cheese mixture. Very good. Went will with our dinner and everyone thought they were a delicious side worth repeating again! Thanks Holly!

Man, this is good!!  Very easy to make and so yummy. I baked it in the oven for a few minutes before switching to broil. I wanted the bread to get a little crispy and warm inside. It was so delicious. I cant see making this an everyday thing because it is pretty bad for you, but--it is excellent!! A keeper.

Okay, this is recipe is restaurant worthy, just spectacular. I used a loaf of Italian bread, which was great. I do not want to know how many calories are in each slice, but if calories are not an issue with you, if you really want to cut loose and try something different than standard garlic bread, this is the one!

Took this to a large dinner party last night and it was met with fabulous reviews.  I would say this recipe serves 16-18 easily.  That is how many we had at dinner and there were still a few slices left.  Very good!  Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this recipe, although after reading the reviews I only used 2/3 cup mayo.  Also, the onion & garlic mixture made the cheese mixture hard to spread, so I think next time I will mix them in with the cheese and only spread one layer.

I made just two servings of this using an asiago cheese baguette I had on hand and green onions for a little more color.  I also cut the mayonnaise back as suggested by a number of other reviewers.  Rather than spreading the onion/garlic mixture on the bread, I just mixed it together with the cheese mixture.  I first lightly toasted one side of the bread under the broiler, then spread the other side with the cheese mixture and broiled again.  Next time I will toast both sides of the bread before spreading the cheese mixture on, in the hopes of making this a little crisper.  A good recipe I will make again!  Thank you!

This wasn't bad.  It had a nice flavor, but my husband said it was too "slimy."  The large amount of butter and mayo were just too much.  I liked it well enough to go back for more, but probably won't make it again since my husband didn't like it at all.  I'll try other recipes.

This is the best Garlic Cheese Bread ever!!!!!  It was so easy to make, and it reminds me of my favorite pizza place's Garlic Cheese Bread.  I had everything on hand to make this except for the French baguettes, so I used hamburger buns and it was delicious!!!!  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.  I will be making this from now on instead of buying it at the store to have with our Italian dinner nights.

This was a really good cheesy garlic bread recipe!  I made an error and flipped the amounts of mozarella and parmesan cheese, but it was still really yummy.  Might just have been my oven, but 5 minutes was too long to broil.  Would cut back on the mayo amount just a bit next time, but it was really good the way its written!

I made this for a dinner party last night and everyone raved about it! I made only 2 small changes, I cooked the onions for 15 minutes in the butter, then added the garlic for only 3 minute. You don't want your garlic to stay in the butter too long, as it will turn bitter. I prepared this 2 hours ahead, covered till time to bake it. It was fast and easy and very, very good! This will be my go to recipe in the future! It's the best we have ever had and great heated up the next day too!

Very good. I always use red onions and they were delicious in this recipe! I might bake the bread for 10-15 minutes to crisp it up a little before I broil it next time since it was very soft. There is also a distinct mayo flavor which was fine since I like mayo but cooks beware. :o) This will be a regular pasta accompaniment in our house.

This sounds good, havent tried it. I just read the directions and some reviews and want to leave some advise. I make something similar but different :) And healthier too. I mix together shredded mozzarella, fresh finely chopped onion and a raw egg, this holds it together and is healthier than the mayo, i add a little salt and pepper to taste. I then spread the mixture onto the bread slices. Heat butter or oil in skillet and when hot, add the slices, topping side down and cook till golden on bottom, then carefully turn and brown other side. They taste great and the onion stays a bit crunchy and flavorful, also the egg adds a good flavor. I will try the recipe as written and please try mine, its really good. I havent made it in a while and completely forgot about it but this reminded me to make it again. Please leave feedback if you try it my way!

This was very flavorful, I would say to not put TOO much mayo and parmesan cheese or it'll get too salty ..I think I overloaded on that a bit but the 2nd time around I didnt put as much of the mayo/parm/cheese topping on it and I added some sauteed tomatoes along with the onions...My boyfriend and I loved it :)

THANK YOU HOLLY.  TOO DELICIOUS FOR WORDS. I misread the recipe and combined the onions and garlic with all the other ingredients before spreading on the bread. I also cut the bread horizontally into two pieces before spreading with this wonderful mixture. At that point I cut the bread into two inch pieces and then proceeded to broil.  I added a bit of Italian seasoning (for flavor) and a bit of parsley and chives (for color as well as flavor).  The only problem that I've encountered is that no matter how much I make, it never seems to be enough.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Oh my gosh, this stuff is awesome! I'll never make any other kind of garlic bread.

Per the suggestion of other users, I cut the mayo way down to about 1/4 to 1/2 C, and it came out perfectly. Rave reviews from the family.  :-)

There were only two of us so I used half a loaf of french bread. Then I cut it in half lengthwise and topped it with garlic/onion/butter mixture and parmesan/mozzarella/mayo mixtures as directed. It was AWESOME! The only change I will make for next time is use less mayo (I would've liked the cheese to be a little 'tighter', it was very creamy, yummy though!) maybe 3/4 cup instead of a full cup.

This was a different kind of garlic bread. It's really tasty. My picky kids didn't mind onions or mayonnaise. I did reduce the amount of mayonnaise though, because it seemed like too much. Oh, and I used ciabatta loaf sliced legthwise. Thank you!

This was awesome!  I had to stop myself from devouring more than 2 pieces.  I didn't change any of the measurements.  You can definitely taste the mayo, but we're big mayo fans so it didn't bother us.  I did use an Italian blend of cheeses instead of just the mozzarella.  Broiled for about 5 minutes and it was perfect!

This was delicious! I changed the recipe a bit- only used enough mayo to be able to spread the cheese and cut the baguette in half length-wise. Also for any people that may be put off on this recipe because of the mayo- I hate mayo but couldn't taste it at all in this when I cut it back. We will definitely be using this recipe again!

I made this last night for a dinner party with friends and it went quick! Everyone agreed this was the best garlic bread they had tasted. I followed the advise of the other reviews and cut the mayo to 2/3 cup. The only thing is next time I will add more garlic as we LOVE garlic!! I will definitely continue to use this recipe!!!

This was amazing! I scaled down the recipe for a sourdough English muffin. The only mozzarella I had on hand was a string cheese stick, and I didn't have any Parmesan (a surprise to me) so I improvised with a slice of provolone cheese and a pinch of salt. I added a smidge more garlic then called for, I can never get enough of it, and only enough mayo to make the cheese into a paste. I also added a bit of paprika and just a dash of chili powder. I spread it out like in the recipe and then dashed a little paprika on top. I popped them in the broiler and they were delicious! My only complaint was that they were really flimsy, so next time I'll toast in in the toaster first. :) Absolutely fantastic recipe though, very adaptable.

Very good! I used vidalia onions and really liked the slight sweetness it gave to this bread. I mixed the onion/garlic mixture (once it cooled) in with the rest of the ingredients and just slathered it on the slices of bread and broiled. I was a tad short on the mozzarella, so I added the rest in cheddar. I also reduced the mayo to about 1/2 cup and I thought it was perfect. I will be making this bread again for sure! Thanks for posting. :)

I was only making two big pieces - I used 1/2 cup mozza cheddar cheese, 2 T parm (the Kraft kind), 1/4 cup Mayo, about a teaspoon of minced garlic, mixed it all together and put it on the bread which I brushed with oil. Great :)

Delicious..not too greasy or mushy at all..   followed recipe exactly and it turned out great.  Agree 1 C of mayo is too much and I will decrease it to 1/2 C next time.   I added sliced mild jalapenos on half of them before broiling - yummmmmmmm!!

My husband called this "the best thing that's ever come out of our kitchen."  I think that's a compliment to the recipe, and not a comment on my cooking...

Incidentally, I HATE mayo and won't eat anything with even a hint of it, and I couldn't taste it at all in this recipe.

Almost the ultimate grilled cheese bread except I prefer 1/2 old cheese for the mozzarella.   This is just a taste preference.   Also used a little less mayonnaise to combat any greasiness.  Thanks - makes great appetizers cut up small.

I made a couple without the onion and garlic mixture, and they seemed to turn out better.   The onions and garlic made the bread and cheese too slimey.  Overall these were very good though, and I will make again.

A cup of mayo is an awful lot, so as others, I cut it way back. I did add more garlic, but overall, this is a very delicious garlic bread that went nicely with our soup tonight. Thanks Holly!

It was alright but it was missing something I think it needed more garlic. And with others reviews I used only half of the mayo.

I didn't use mozzarella, only parmisan regiano and used only the least amount of mayo to form a heavy cheese paste. It came out delicious and it didn't overpower the garlic and onions. I used Italian bread and only sliced it 1/2" thick, since 3/4" thick bread PLUS toppings made it hard for small mouths to eat. I'll make this again for certain. Thank you!

This was really good!  I did what a lot of others suggested and only used enough mayo to make the mix spreadable.  I also cut the baguettes lengthwise and sliced them after broiling to save time.  The only thing I would do differently next time, and the reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars, is that I would cut down on the toppings.  I felt it was a little too much, and kind of overpowering and greasy.  I would make less of both the toppings because the amount called for results in an EXTREMELY greasy garlic cheese bread.  And this is coming from someone who likes her food greasy and cheesy!  It was just too much.  I think I would half both the toppings next time.

I wish I would've read the reviews before making this as I always do but I was stressed for time and totally forgot. If it wasn't for my Hubby and Aunt actually liking this I would only rated this MAYBE 2 stars. The mayo is OVERWHELMING!! All I tasted was mayo! Me and my kids wouldn't touch it...I personally thought it was terrible. HAVE TO CUT THE MAYO DOWN ALOT!! I will try this again using only enough mayo to make it spreadable as other reviewers have suggested.

I had really high hopes for this recipes.  I was skeptical when I saw how much mayo went into it, but I still tried it.  It was truly inedible.  No one in my family would eat more than one bite.  The mayo flavor was so overwhelming that it just ruined this for us.

I wish I could have had a better experience.  Thanks for sharing anyway!

this did not turn out as expected based on the rave reviews. The only change I made was reducing the mayonnaise to 1/2 called for but I could still taste the mayo over the cheese and garlic. Yuck!

My family really enjoyed this, but I felt that the mayo overpowered the flavor. I did not use the onion as we were having this with French onion soup, and I felt that there would be too much onion in our meal. I will try making this again, but I will leave out the mayo.

I made this for my now-wife on one of our first dates, and it won her over. We've made this so many time since then, we don't bother getting out the measuring cups and just eyeball everything. It may not be the healthiest recipe out there but boy, is it tasty!

The family LOVED this. We eliminated the onions. The garlic/butter mixture didn't make enough to get all the way through the entire baguette. So we had more cheese mixture left over. That said, not one piece was left!

I make it without the mayo and it still turns out great. You can use whatever cheese you prefer without much of a difference. I also sometimes use Italian bread without much variation in flavor.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!   I  didn't have any onion,  so I subbed dried minced onion and just eyeballed the quantity. It turned out so good and everyone just loved it at dinner tonight.  I served it with vegetable beef soup. Thanks for sharing your recipe,  Marbalet!

I used one large french loaf, rather than bagettes, so I imagine  I ended up with more topping per piece than stated in the recipe. I also carmalized the onions, added the garlic at the very end and used 2/3 cups of mayo. The recipe was delicious!

LOVED it. Easy and kids said it was the best bread ever. Still talking about it the next day. I didn't used the onion because my youngest doesn't  like onion. GREAT

To say that my boys liked this would be an understatement. I halved the recipe, and half of the amount (which would have been a quarter cup, so I halved the recipe then halved the mayonnaise again, if that makes sense) used olive oil mayonnaise. Every piece of this was inhaled. I didn't even get to try it. NOTE: I used Kraft parmesan cheese but I think this would be insane with a good fresh grated parmesan. I'm glad I cut the mayonnaise in half, I think had I used the whole amount it would have been overkill.

I made this for my fiance, little sister and a few of her friends. It was amazing! I did end up adding a handful of swiss cheese to the mixture and when i took them out i brushed melted butter around the sides. All i have to say is yummy!

I had been looking for a good cheese bread recipe for a long time and this fits the bill perfectly. The mayonnaise is a surprising ingredient that pulls everything together nicely.  Thank you for sharing.

I thought that this recipe was really good...however watch the calories of this. Its definitely a lot! After a few bites it seemed to be a too much and I could tell that this was really heavy. So I ended up scraping off the top and just eating the bread with the butter mixture on it which was really good. Anyway I liked this but could not rate it very high due to the high calories...

I changed this recipe a little, mainly because I was serving it with a chicken meal and not a pasta meal. I omitted the butter, and substituted with 1 TBSP of olive oil.  Instead of the mozzarella and Parm cheeses, I used cheddar cheese. I also added salt & pepper to taste. GREAT base recipe that I will experiment with other cheeses as well. Also tastes great on those little small sourdough & rye breads. (Usually sold by the deli).

These are absolutely wonderful!  I made them for a group of friends at a dinner party and they were all gone, and everyone wanted more!  I did make a few changes, I'm not a fan of onions so I didn't add them.  I also skipped the step about sauteing the garlic and just added it into the mayo/cheese mixture.  They turned out delicious!

All that I could taste was the mayo.  I made it with the hopes that my husband and daughter would like it, we love garlic cheese bread and no one would eat it.

This was very good. I used the suggestion to split the entire loaf into two pieces and then cut after baking--much faster. Make sure to mince the onion very fine or you it will overpower the bread. I used 1/2 cup Mayo as suggested by many reviewers--just right!

So yummy! Luckily my boyfriend and I both love garlic and onions. I didn't add as much mayo as the recipe called for, only enough to make it creamy and spreadable. I added a couple grinds of pepper because I think most dips and spreads taste better with pepper. I cooked the onions in butter and olive oil as another reviewer suggested. The one major change that I made to the recipe was to use roasted garlic instead of sauteeing the garlic with the onion. It was a deceptively simple recipe and so delicious. My bf has insisted that I bring it to the next lunch or dinner we go to.

The three people I cooked this for loved it, I didn't care for it, something about the mayonaise flavor on garlic bread kind of made me gag. I thought a "3" but everyone else said "5" so I went in between.

My fiance loved this, but I didn't care for it. I think it is because I used Miracle Whip instead of real Mayo to cut down on the fat. If I make these again, I will use regular Mayo. I followed the recipe exactly but only used one mini french loaf since I have no idea what baguettes are.

Yuummy!  This cheesy gooey melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness combines some of my favorite tastes all in one~  The slightly browned, bubbly cheese was awesome and, since I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo, I got an extra tangyness that I really liked.  A definite keeper!

This was very good, although I did tweak the recipe a bit. I had some Philly style sandwich rolls that I needed to use, so they became my base. Instead of the garlic mixture, I sprayed the bread with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray and sprinkled on some garlic powder. Then I used a combo of mozarella and cheddar, with only used enough lite mayo to make a spread. You really do not taste the mayo; it just helps spread the cheese. I served it with a hearty cold salad, and my family loved it.

Made this last night with the Slow Cooker Chicken Caccitore.  It was great!  I cut the servings to two but it needed more garlic and onion maybe onions.  The mayo was a little much also...I will cut it back next time.

I was disappointed with this. We weren't impressed at all. It was almost like it needed some tomato or bacon or something to make it more of a cheese/onion/whatever sandwich. Thanks anyway.

This was a great bread to go with some homemade clam chowder.  I followed other's advise on only use half the mayo.  I think next time I make this I will use green onions instead and broil the mixture on some french rolls, then slice.

NOTE: Be sure to make it all crispy and bubbley. I had it with a Veggie Fresh Chicken soup. Just a suggestion!!:) Thanks for the recipe...A KEEPER!!

This was a success...however, I would recommend less mayo...like another user I only added enough mayo for spreading consistency. Otherwise, this was a good recipe :)

Superb----it disappeared off the plate.  I used one large loaf of french bread and cut in half lengthwise, spread it with the onion/garlic and then cheese mixture and broiled it.  After broiling, I cut it into 2" pieces---a lot less work than spreading individual slices.  Thanks this one will be on my table often.

Following the other reviews, I cut back on the mayo.  I had one loaf and only needed 1/4 cup of mayo.  Sent this to a wine club meeting and it was a hit!

AWESOME!  I did not have enough mozzarella on hand so I added some chedder.  Since other reviews recommended less mayo, I only added enough to get the consistancy needed to spread it on the bread.  I made this as a last minute replacement for a bread gone awry to take to my supper club, it was a hit!!!

If you are on a diet - keep away!  It is delicious - will cut back on mayo next time as other reviewers suggested and I doubled the amount of onion, garlic, butter spread which was also suggested - but it is a keeper.

Wonderful!  Best garlic bread ever - Cut back in mayo just a tad and added a couple more cloves of garlic.  I will be serving this often with pasta and soups this winter.  Thank you Holly!

This recipe tasted fabulous and was very easy to make.  I didn't use as much butter, mayo or cheese as the recipe calls for, in order to reduce the very outrageous amount of fat.  It was sinfully delicious.  My husband said it was the best garlic bread he has ever had.  Thank you holly.

This is the best cheesey garlic bread that I have ever had.  This tops any bread you can get at any restaraunt.

My husband and I loved this garlic bread!! It was definitely worth the effort (of having to sautee the onions and garlic in butter) I froze the leftovers and can't wait to have it again...
