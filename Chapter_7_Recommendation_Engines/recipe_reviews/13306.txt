Very good soup!!! I didn't have any frozen corn so I used 1 can of corn (drained) and I used 1 (4oz) can of green chiles instead of 1/2c. I also added a little more carrots and added a green bell pepper (chopped). ALSO, I grilled some chicken seasoned with cajun seasonings, cubed it and added that too! VERY GOOD! Not too spicy but a nice "warm."  Instead of salsa, I sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese overall. Would make again! Thanks Corwynn for another great recipe!

This was good but it lacked something and I couldn't put my finger on what it was. I did run short on wild rice and threw in some brown but the rice wasn't the problem. I think next time I would lose the carrots and add rinsed black beans in the end instead? Anyway, I am giving it a 4 because it was was very flavorable and easy to make and my hubby enjoyed it but it just lacked a little something to me.

I used less celery and onion and probably a little more rice.  EXCELLENT for a cold night.  Thick and yummy with crusty bread and butter on the side.  Kids didn't complain too much either and it was nice to have a meat-less meal.

I made it creamy by sauteing the onions and adding flour and cooking that for a minute.  Then at the end I added milk/cream.  It was pretty amazing!  Thanks for the idea

easy ... great flavor. if you want fully vegetarian it's almost as good with veg-stock instead of chicken.

Great weeknight dinner.  I just use a box of the Uncle Ben's Wild Rice, and I added celery and garlic.  I haven't tried it yet, but I bet this wold be good with some shredded chicken!

I loved how quick and simple this recipe was. I only made one change--I sauteed the onion, carrots and a little fresh minced garlic in a little EVOO before adding the other ingredients. The spices are spot on. Everything in this soup worked together very well. Though we liked this soup, both my husband and I were trying to figure out what it was missing. It's almost there......it just needs a little "oomph". As is, NO leftovers.

This was okay, but not to our taste.  We had great hopes for this.  Thanks for the recipe.

A very easy dish to prepare.  I used only one green chile pepper and added one can of rinsed black beans.  Next time I make this I will pick up a bag of tortilla chips to crumble over the top to add a nice salty crunch.

We loved this!  I used roasted, chopped, NM green chilies - hot — not canned.  We used green chile powder, not red.  I added 1/3 C celery and some minced garlic.  Oh my goodness!  We’ll be making this again and again. Thanks to the chef!

This soup is delicious, I have made it several times. We like to add chicken breasts (cook them separately and add to the final mixture while it simmers at the end). I also tend to use a bit less cumin and more cayenne. This is also great served with cornbread muffins. Yummy.

This was okay. I used leftover chicken breast which was already cooked so added that at the end to just heat through. Added celery and garlic to the carrots and onions. I added in the seasoning at the beginning aswell to really let the dried herbs bloom.. Added coriander as well. Used 1 carton of low sodium chicken Broth and only 1 cup of rice as that was enough. 
I really wish I had Cilantro but it didn't look good at the store. Squeezed Lime juice over my bowl..this helped. Not sure what I'd add to it next time, maybe a cam of fire roasted tomatoes.

this was fantastic! i made it with a chicken breast and about a half red bell pepper chopped. i cut up the chicken and then put all the spices in a bowl with the chicken. sauteed the chicken and spices with a little olive oil before adding to soup. i also added 2 cloves of garlic. oh, also made with homemade chicken stock and water (about half and half) rather than store bought chicken broth (so much sodium!) Anyway, it came out delicious! Will definitely recommend and make again!

Family LOVED this soup. (*I did add a can of black beans and a diced chicken breast to the pot. I forgot to add oregano and put in pressed garlic by accident!) I didn't top it with salsa but added a big spoonful of very hot salsa to the pot, which gave it a touch of heat that my boys loved. They  asked me to keep this recipe and make it again.

Very good soup!  I used 1-(4oz) can of green chiles instead of chopped. Also add 1-tsp. minced garlic, 1/3 cup celery and chopped green pepper.  Add one box of uncle bens quick cook rice with seasoning pack instead of cooked wild rice. Served with corn chips and shredded cheese. My husband loved it. Next time I will reduce chicken broth.

Loved the spices.  I used more carrots and onions than this recipe specified.   Next time, I will add shredded chicken, kidney beans and celery.   There are lots of possibilities with this recipe.  Thanks for posting this.
