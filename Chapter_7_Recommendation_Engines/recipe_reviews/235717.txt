Very good. I had some large cubes and this was a great way to use them.

Very good! I cut the recipe back and used a seedless cucumber so I didn't need to de-seed it. Nice side dish that is definitely different from the usual. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing.:)

I didn't skin or seed cucumbers - It was still good! Kids not crazy about it but I liked it.

It was so simple and different but yummy. Will definitely make it again. Next time I may try fresh tarragon. Thank you for sharing the recipe!
