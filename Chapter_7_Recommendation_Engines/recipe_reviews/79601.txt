This was really good. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup or any other cream soups so I made cream of celery and replaced the can of soup and milk with it. The family ate it up, no leftovers!

This was really good.  I baked it for the minimum time (11 min) and thought it had a pretty golden crust.  When I cut into it I saw that the crescent dough was still somewhat gooey underneath, so definitely add a few more minutes.  I threw it back in the oven for a bit and now I think it's fine.  Very easy!!  :)

I don't give many 5 stars but this one definitely deserves it. Too bad there is not a picture because the end result presentation looks fabulous.  Easy, delicious, and looks unbelievable when it comes out of the oven. Next time I'm going to try this with some cooked chicken.

Everyone in my family loves this and it really is perfect for a busy weeknight.  I did make a few changes - added noodles (because my guys eat ALOT), more cheese, about a 1/8 tsp of garlic powder and used only peas instead of the mixed veggies.  My filling was a bit dry - possibly due to addition of the noodles - so I added some milk and it was perfect.  The crescent rolls did overlap a lot, so much so that I couldn't use them all.  Next time I will drape them over the edge of the pie plate with the points outside, then add the filling, then cover the top with the points.

This is five stars, not because it is the most wonderful tuna pot pie in the world, but because it's pretty tasty and literally the quickest thing in the world to cook.  I added some spices and a bit of milk and didn't cook the frozen veggies/tuna for as long as they said.  From start to finish dinner on the table in less than a half hour... terrific!

I was looking for a simple, fast recipe for dinner. I followed this recipe to a T and it came out great (and I even forgot to put the cheese on at first, so I had to unpeal the dough, put the cheese on, and re-put the dough on)! I cooked it for 11 minutes, it was still a little doughy, so I put it in for another 4 minutes and it was perfectly done after that! I was going to take a picture to post, but this was gobbled up the second I turned around!

My family enjoyed this. I added some shredded rotisserie chicken as it didn't seem to have enough "meat" and will probably make it with just that next time. I laid the crescents over the edge of my 9" square pan and then folded them up. Yummy!

This recipe really surprised me, it was wonderful!!  I was honestly not expecting anything gourmet, and it isn't, but for simple ingredients that I normally always have on hand this is a wonderful dish.  Hubby loved it...he went back for seconds and thirds!!  I will be using this recipe for a quick and delicious dinner.  Thank you!

This was excellent and I will be making it again for sure! I did add one additional can of tuna because the crowd I was feeding likes their meats over their veggies! What a great, easy supper!

I did make my own "cream of mushroom soup", with just a cup of milk, some vegetable stock, and corn starch, which I poured into a pan of sauteed mushrooms and whisked until thickened. Also, I'd like to mention that gently FOLDING the tuna in is important so it doesn't all go to mush. I also used a pre-baked pie shell, and substituted Parm for the Cheddar. I guess to that end I didn't completely follow the directions, but rather used them as a guide. I've never made a savory pie before, so I was delighted this was quite a hit.

I Hate tuna...but I have a family who likes it so I'm forced to eat in once in a while.  I made this and ate it, it was good!  I  did make a few changes, I used cream of onion soup a dash of pepper and a little milk.

My hubby loved this.  He loved the addition of the onion flavor.  I cooked the onion in the butter, but took them out before I put the rest of the stuff in.  Shame on me, I did add noodles too, but they were whole wheat. It's how we love it, so I had to. I only used frozen peas, too, that is how my mom always made them.

I wanted to love this recipe. I was excited to finally have a tuna casserole without noodles. But this fell far short. Extremely bland and the ratio of crescent roll topping to filling is WAY off. I would've had to at least triple the filling amount in order for the topping to be balanced with it. Made as directed, tasted filling prior to baking, no taste really. Added garlic powder, kosher salt, cracked black pepper, parsley. Helped some but it would have had to have been put in the mix originally, not as an afterthought. Might make again with many tweaks but sorry, this did not work for us. :(

I did note that many of the 4-5 star ratings were only after people amended the original recipe and instructions. That's not really fair. You need to rate based on the original, then you should offer your modifications and what the rating "could" have been. Just my 2 cents.

This tuna pot pie was a family pleaser and a great way to get more vegetables into our diet. I used the sovory wheat crescents recipe from this site as the topping instead of store bought and baked according to crescent recipe and it turned out great! Will be making this again and again.

I'm putting this one in the regular menu rotation! I was searching for a recipe to use the hoards of tuna packets I've gotten on sale...and this was perfect. Everything I needed was on hand; inexpensive, quick, very easy and came out delicious!

Definatly a quick good meal.  I used 9X 13 pan, put crescent rolls flat on bottom instead of on top.  Poured mixture of soup, tuna, onions, peas (I had to use a few splashes of milk to thin it out) on top of crescent rolls.  I topped with a bag of shredded cheese and baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  Worked out well.

We added fresh mushrooms and garlic. Also added 1 cup of cheese instead of half cup. I would love to learn a homemade dough topping so I don't have to buy the processed crescent rolls.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was quick and tasty. The only thing I did different was I added a thin layer of shredded velveeta cheese between the rolls and the tuna mixture. Great recipe!

This was SO GOOD and SO EASY! I forgot the cheese under the crust (even after reading another reviewer saying she did it and thinking "Oh, I wouldn't forget to do that"), but it was still fantastic without it. I bought some canned chicken this week to use to make a batch for me and a batch for a friend with a new baby. :) This will be a new staple around here!

I make this one a lot when I'm getting low on groceries.  I also use a pie crust instead of crescent rolls and just bake it until the top of the crust is light brown.  I also use 5 ounces of peas and 5 ounces of corn instead of mixed only because I never have mixed on hand.  It's a good hearty pie and love to have this recipe to resort to when I'm low on groceries.  Thanks for sharing!

I only used 1 can of tuna and a small fist full of frozen vegetables. This recipe was delicious! I made it for a house full of five toddlers and they all loved it! It was filling and had great flavor!

Not bad.  Couldn't really taste the cheese, and the filling could be a little less soupy.  But the flavor was good.

Another recipe my husband called me crazy for making and asked me where I get all my crazy recipes from.  But yet he went and ate left overs of it the next day.  My kids both wanted seconds of this...it will be a definite keeper...very easy and quick.  Something for a busy mom to make.  I love it.  I did add some black pepper to the veggies to taste.  But I like pepper on my food.

What a simple and fast recipe!  It was very good.  It did take me about 15 minutes to get the top to be golden brown.  It also wasn't easy to serve.  This recipe will definately be something that I will make a lot of because I always have the ingredients in the cupboard!

I'd give this a solid "meh."  Not as good as I was hoping given the other reviews and high rating.  I made it exactly as written.  I really liked the crescent roll as the top crust.  But, honestly, I wouldn't classify it as "easy" mostly because it was more time consuming that I would have cared for.  I won't be making this again - just not worth the effort.

Very good, we all enjoyed it, including husband and 3 daughters! I only gave it 4 stars because I had to make some substitutions based on what was on hand and what my family likes. 

I swapped the butter for an equal amount of olive oil. I replaced onions with onion powder because hubby won't eat them, and added a little bit of garlic powder, black pepper, and parsley. I only had frozen broccoli so I used that, and it definitely could have taken more veggies.

I only had a 4 oz can of crescent rolls and that was PLENTY. I flattened three of the rolls with my fingers and laid them evenly over the top, then tore up the last one to cover the gaps, and that was enough to cover the top entirely. With the dough pressed thin, 11 minutes was exactly right.

This turned out really good for us. Very easy and inexpensive to make, which is always nice. This recipe is very versatile so you can change out ingredients to make it how you like. I think it would be really good with chicken instead of tuna, or if you don't like certain vegetables then leave something out and add a different one in. My husband and I both really liked it, my two year old had two helpings, and my five year old was the hard one to please tonight, but he ate it. I'm sure I will be making this one again soon. Thank you for the recipe, MISWOODS!

It was okay...not nearly as good as I thought it would be. The crescents didn't cook all the way through with the suggested time so I baked the recipe for 10 extra minutes. I think canned chicken or fresh cooked chicken breast would be better in this recipe.

As others have said, it is a quick and easy recipe, with pantry staples you usually have on hand. I used 1/4 tsp garlic powder, and sauteed 1/2 red bell pepper along with the onion. As another reviewer suggested, I layered the crescent dough on the bottom of the pie plate with points sticking out of the plate. Mixture over the dough, cheese on top, then folded the left-out dough over the mixture. Worked very well; no soggy dough at all.

Almost a cross between chicken pot pie and tuna casserole. If you're in the mood for comfort food, but don't have much time? This one's for you!

I added some minced garlic, seafood seasoning and a full cup of cheddar. baked a little longer than stated to get a golden crust. Nice quick meal for a weeknight that uses on-hand ingredients.

Although the rest of my family didn't care for it too much, I sure liked this. I'm surprised because I generally do not like tuna or vegetables. However, this combination of flavors really worked well for me.  I made meal to the letter of the recipe. I loved the taste, the nutirional value, and the time it took to make. Plus, the leftovers were easy to store and re-heat throughout the week for lunches.

I used all of the ingredients listed with the exception of the tuna.  All I had on hand was sole fillets, so I steamed those in with the onions and celery, then flaked them prior to adding veggies and soup.  The crescent rolls, I laid opposite to the directions.  The wide part was laid inside the dish with the points laying over the edge.  Added the filling and then wrapped the points into the middle.  Everyone  from 13m up really enjoyed this dish!!

This was so easy and the whole family really liked it. The only problem I had was that it stayed kind of doughy, especially where the crescent rolls overlapped, so next time I will arrange the dough to cover the top with out any overlap. This is a great and simple weeknight dinner and I will definately make it again.

The inside was great, but i couldn't get the crescent top to bake properly.  My pot pie overlapped quite a bit, so maybe I would suggest trying to not overlap because mine came out kind of gooey.  Will try again, but with caution.

MISWOODS has a winner in this recipe.  Quick, easy and delicious.  There were no leftovers at this house. I didn't have Chedder on hand, so substituted shredded Swiss.  My bag of frozen vegetables was 12 ounces but it all fit into the 9 inch pie plate.  When my garden gets into production, I'll try fresh veggies.

I made a few changes, but only because of the limited ingredients I had on hand.  I used 1 can of drained lima beans and 1 can of drained kernel corn instead of the mixed vegetables.  I also used a couple slices of pepper jack cheese torn into pieces and a little shredded Mexican cheese blend. I used a Pillsbury pie crust for the top which means I had to bake it a bit longer for the crust to brown.  My hubby loved it so I may not try the original recipe and just keep making it with my changes.  However, I wouldn't have made it at all without the original recipe to use as a base.  Thanks for a keeper.

We loved the recipe.  I used cream of chicken soup and added about 3/4 cup of milk to the recipe.  You could probably use any cream of soups.  You could use a variety of seasonings to, such a Italian seasoning or dried parsley too.  Will make it again.

I was surprised at how good this came out! I didn’t have any onions so I threw in some of those fried crunchy onions and I had an extra Pillsbury pie crust that I used in place of crescents. Super fast, easy, and delicious!

Great! I used 4 biscuit rounds and stretched them out. Added thyme and Mrs. Dash. We both loved it.

Wanted to surprise a pescatarian family member with something special (and easy) so I decided to make this. It was perfect! I couldn't find any crescent rolls in the supermarket so I just used the good ol' pie crust, and it still tasted fantastic. Thank you for the recipe!

Absolutely fabulous!!!  I did add minced garlic and fresh ground pepper - my family basically wants garlic in everything.  All I know is the kids are already asking me when I will make it again, and we just had it last night!

Okay, this is SUPER quick and tastes DELICIOUS. I recommend a few things though:
Add a little splash of milk while heating all the ingredients. It makes it liquidy but will keep the pie from drying out when baking. Cook the onions lightly too keep a bit of crunch.  Use two and a half cans of tuna, AND add two handfuls of cooked egg noodles! It gives it a great texture. Don't forget your staple spices like pepper and salt to give it flavor. ^_^

My recipe is a bit different.  Instead of cream of mushroom soup and cheddar cheese, I use low fat, large curd cottage cheese and add shredded basil.  Lower fat and less gloopy.

Put aluminum foil around the edge for the first half of baking time to keep the top layer from getting too browned.

I added a cup of celery and used the pie crust I had in the fridge. Will do again with the crescent rolls as that sounds great

I didn't have onion so I used celery instead. It gave it a nice flavour and my family really enjoyed it. I just wish I hadn't overloaded the crust because it ended up getting a little soggy.

I did not have an onion so I diced a potato and sprinkled on onion powder and sautéed it like I would have the onion. Everything else was the same. So easy and yummy!

We really enjoyed this quick and easy meal. I needed a good meal but was short on time and since I had everything in the house this fit the bill perfectly.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe.  I added 2 medium potatoes, diced, when cooking the onions because we had a couple potatoes to use up and it tasted great!

This was ok. I need to remember next time not to put veggies in it. Better to make them separately. Everyone eats them better that way.
