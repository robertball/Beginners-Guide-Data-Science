This is such a simple recipe but it yields a very tasty result.  I only had hot Italian sausage, so that was what I used (I'd like to try it with sage breakfast sausage too) and since I can't eat green peppers I used red.  I also added about 2 tbs fresh basil, chiffonaded and sprinkled freshly grated Parmesan over the top.  My family were all but kicking their plates.  Thanks, Cliff, this is a keeper.

Quick to throw together with a minimum of fuss. I forgot to add the bacon but it was still good. Leftovers were good also.

I changed this recipe a bit by using homemade spicy breakfast sage sausage and homemade cream of mushroom soup instead of tomato sauce.  I left out the bacon only because I forgot it. I topped it off with cheddar cheese during the last 15 minutes of baking.  Outstanding.  Will make again.

This was very good I used basmatti rice and added mozzarella cheese for the last few minutes of baking.  Would definately make this again.

This dish was EXCELLENT! My teenage son gobbled it up! It's perfect just the way it's written. I didn't have a baking dish with a lid so I used 4 Tablespoons of water and doubled the foil to seal tight in a 2 quart casserole dish. Will definitely be making this regularly!

Simple, tasty and easy on the budget. This reminded me of something my mother used to make but better. I left out the bacon because we don't care for it. Everyone in the family enjoyed this dish. However, I don't see why you wouldn't saute the onions and peppers and then add in the sausage to cook all at once. I did this, and it saved steps and time. Also, I used 16 oz of tomato sauce instead of 15, and it was a perfect consistency. So for those who thought it was dry, maybe just a little more sauce is all you need. Thanks for a new addition to our "Family Favorites" folder!

Very nice and easy dish to put together. I did make a couple of changes(1) i make my own tomatoe sauce so that is what i used.(2)I used Italian rice cause that is what i had. The rest remained the same. We loved this, a one pot meal that will be made  on a regular basis here. Thank you Cliff G for sharing your recipe!

This is sensational!  I made two small changes regarding the ingredients: First, I had some hot sausage and hamburger mix that was leftover from some chili I made, so I used that instead of straight sausage.  Second, I had some fresh sage for a soup recipe I am going to make, so I used that instead of the dried- I just added it in at the end of cooking the onion/pepper mix.  Other than that, I followed the ingredients exactly.  Regarding the directions- I had some bacon already cooked from a previous recipe, so I didn't have the reserved bacon fat to brown the meat in.  Otherwise, I followed the directions.  This was quick and easy to make (especially so, since the bacon part was done ahead!), and the whole family loved it!  It probably could have been cooked slightly less than a hour, as it was just a tad dry, but really not enough to be noticeable.  I can't wait to give a copy of this recipe to my mom- my dad will LOVE this!  Thanks Cliff G- this will be going into my regular rotation.  Perfect comfort food for the chilly winter months  :)

The photo for this meal made my mouth water. I was out of some the ingredients it called for so I used smoked sausage and some sautéed onions and yellow peppers I don't know why I add butter to everything but to sum it up, it was delish... Thank you, Cliff =)

This dinner came together very nicely and it fit my plan of “using what I have on-hand”.   DH & DS are big fans of rice dishes.  The fact that this dish uses bacon, sausage, onion and peppers, I knew it would be a huge hit in my house.  Cliff G. – it was, they loved it.  They both called “dibs” on the leftovers for their lunch the following day.  I prepared a salad, bread and fresh fruit to go along with this meal.  Thanks Cliff for sharing your recipe, it will be repeated often as I usually have all the ingredients on-hand.

Omitted the green pepper and bacon because I didn't have either.  instead, I added in some leftover roasted peppers and a dash of cayenne.  Delicious and easy! I took this out of the oven at 50 minutes. (Everything is better with bacon so I can't wait to make it again with it!)

Delicious!  So easy and love that I had most ingredients on hand.  Subbed chicken and apple sausage links, sliced.  Wonderful flavor.  Thank you for the recipe!
