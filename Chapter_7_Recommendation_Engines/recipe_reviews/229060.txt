I made a couple tweaks that took this to a 5 star for me.  I sliced the zucchini into thin round slices.  I put the slices in a large ziplock and added about 2 tbs of olive oil shaking vigorously to coat.  I combined 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs, about 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp dried basil, and about 1/4 tsp black pepper and added this mixture to the bag, shaking to coat all the slices.  Then I baked for about 25 minutes, sprinkled Parmesan cheese over the top and set on a low broil to crisp them up.    Yum!

Used the advice MrsHess said, including broiling for a few minutes.  They were good, but there's nothing like lightly breaded fried zucchini:) dipped in Ranch dressing.

These were good! Mine came out pretty soggy/mushy, but I can't really fault the recipe b/c I did cut the pieces bigger than stated, so maybe if the pieces were smaller they would have been a bit crispier. I tossed the zucchini in a bowl w/ the olive oil (I used evoo), salt and pepper, and threw in a little garlic powder too. After they were coated, I rolled them into the breadcrumbs, and put them on the baking sheet. The flavor was nice, and I plan to try them again, cutting them the right way, lol. Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe! Nice & healthy. Our guests loved them.
I made them in a New Wave oven and baked for 8 minutes,  and used a mix of olive oil & egg instead of margarine. TASTY and fun hors d'oeuvres. I also used a home made bread crumb mix of panko, Italian seasoning & parmasean cheese, and a lot of black pepper.

My family loves this.  The sticks were a little mushy but that might have been due to having a really large zucchini.
