Very nice pretty healthy recipe.  I used all the same ingredients but changed up the prep order to make it easier for me to put together on a busy day.  I diced up the onion, carrots (used a lot more carrots) celery.  Cooked the beef, added the onions, carrots and celery and cooked that a bit, added the broth & bouillon cube, tomato sauce - brought to a low simmer - added the potatoes and turned the heat down to low and let simmer - just before serving I added the cabbage and let simmer while the rolls baked.  No added salt was needed. Perfectly easy weeknight meal.  This can all be done using the crockpot - start of the stove and finish the simmer and cabbage in the crockpot.

Exactly what I was looking for! It tasted exactly like what I grew up on at my Grandma's house. Excellent flavor - definitely a comfort food for me!

I absolutely loved this recipe but I did make some changes.  Instead of the tomato sauce I used 1 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with the juice and a small can of tomato paste.  I also added a can of drained corn and a gutted and diced jalapeno to add a little kick.  I added these along with the rest of the veggies and let it simmer for 70 minutes.    Both myself and my partner absolutely loved it!

Excellent stew!  I make this in the crock pot.  Just brown the meat, put it in the crock pot and cover with the rest of the ingredients.  Cook on low all day and it comes out great!  Another great excuse to eat cabbage.  Great as-is, but I've also added corn, peas, cauliflower, etc.

My wife can make a great stew and i have been trying to make a recipe to beat hers and have great flavor with tender meat and done vegies that didnt taste like some chemical, well this recipe beat hers by far.  I didn't change anything, the beef was real tender, the broth had great flavor and the cabbage made this stew even better.  You have to try this recipe, you will make this again.  My wife really liked this stew and admitted it that it taste better then hers.

I made this recipe in my pressure cooker and it cut the cooking time down to about 35 minutes.  It turned out perfectly.  I browned the beef in a little oil for about 12 minutes, pressure cooked the meat, broth, onion, and spices for 15 minutes, added the veggies and pressure cooked for 7 minutes, added the tomato sauce and pressure cooked for 1 minute.  Fabulous!

Prepared this recipe exactly like the original with no changes.  It turned out perfect!  Very tasty the first day and the leftovers were even better the second day.  You will not be disappointed.  Great recipe, and I'll definitely make this one again.

ok, is it fair to give this 5 stars when I didn't follow the recipe? I just had to because this soup is so delicious and soooooo good for us!!! I used 1 pound of beef, 15 oz tomato sauce, 6 cups of beef broth, 4 large handful of coleslaw mix (Sam's club), 2 large carrots, 1 onion, 1 c each of frozen green beans and corn and salt and pepper...and one tsp of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes. OH WOW! simple, delicious, hearty, healthy goodness in a bowl. Exactly what I want my family to eat to nourish themselves!!! the twenty minutes of simmering are almost up and the troops are starting to circle!!! I've taste-tested a little bowl already and I can hardly wait for more!!!!

First let me say I am a beginner when it comes to making actual hearty home cooked meals with fresh meat and veges. and this meal was GREAT! Growng up my mom alaways made meals from scrath and this remided me of coming home from school as a child and smelling her yummy stew before I even hit the side walk.

How good can beef and cabbage taste? Honestly? Well let me tell ya, this recipe made a believer out of me! Obviously I was skeptical but I followed the directions to a tee and had some faith-it's rated 5 stars after all. Now I know why. Won't make any changes when I make this again. Great recipe. Thanks Paul

Fantastic flavor. The only changes I made was I did not measure the cabbage I just added the whole head, why measure if you love cabbage. I also added roasted garlic. I always have some in my refrigerator and it makes a great addition to any dish.

As someone who doesn't eat enough vegetables, I was looking for a recipe to get more veggies into my diet. This really did the trick! My boyfriend loves it. We follow the directions mostly as listed (sometimes leaving out the onion, because I don't like them), and it always turns out great. The cabbage is the star of the dish. We love to add TONS of cabbage to this recipe, especially because the cabbage shrinks as it cooks.

I took away one star though because the tomato sauce flavor is very overpowering. Although my boyfriend loves the tomato flavor, I do not, and we have started using half a can to reduce the strong tomato flavor a bit. It's still delicious, but with the full can of tomato sauce, all I could taste was tomato, and I really wanted to enjoy the other flavors in the dish. Half a can works for us. It keeps the tomato flavor in the dish without overpowering the other flavors at work.

Overall, great recipe! Really enjoyed it, and it is now one of our "regulars"! :)

I have made beef stew and it is good ,but this recipe was even better, more nutritious, and lower in calories. I put everything into a pressure cooker and cooked it about an hour. It was delicious.

I've never made a successful stew before but this one turned out great.... The key was to cook the stew meat long and slow to get it tender and to throw your vegetables in during the last cooking hour which for me was at the one and half hour mark. I did make some adjustments but nothing extreme. I used 2 and half pounds stew meat. I used meat tenderizer on the stew while I browned the meat. I added 8 red potatoes since they were already on hand. Added corn. 4 cups of beef unsalted broth. A browning agent. And also added a half cup of sugar to eliminate the acids from the red sauce since I'm not a fan of mixing red and brown gravys in the first place. My picture of finished product is in the gallery...

I included a 1/2c of marsala wine and a few pinches of herbs and it came out with a nice flavor and very rich sauce. Very good!

Very disappointed with this recipe.  Our old standby swiss steak in the crockpot is much better than this.  I won't be making this again.

Simple and hearty recipe. We initially made the soup exactly as instructed but ended up doubling up on the broth halfway through.  We will definitely make again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

First off, I followed the recipe exactly except for draining the grease because there seemed to be very little.  It was just mostly moisture from the meat.   Now I will tell you that I was very doubtful of this recipe most of the time while it was cooking, through all phases.   I'm a sampler and I kept dipping my spoon in and thinking that I was going to have to help it a lot to make it edible.   I now have the tomato sauce in and still it's just blah.   However, after about 20 minutes, the flavor came together and it was fantastic.   However, it did require a fair bit of salt.    I'm very happy that I didn't drain the juice at the beginning because the gravy ratio was just perfect as it was and I think it may have been too dry without it.   Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent stew! I coated the meat with flour before browning it. That was the only change I made and everyone enjoyed their meal. I will definitely adopt this recipe!

Great start Recipe I used Beef stock for added flavor and put more veggies in then it called for.
It did take longer for the veggies to tenderize but I did allow time for that.  
It had great flavor and the extra cooking time just tenderized the meat more.

I dont know what I did wrong? After 1 hour there was virtually no liquid in the pot cooking the meat. I had the temp on 4, but I was using my wider 3" pot with a lid. That is typically a simer with it. After 1 hour, I ended up having to add five cups of water. The meat was plenty tender, so I just added the vegetables at that point. I simmered it about 45 more minutes, adding the tomato sauce at some point. My only change was adding an extra carrot and using a 10oz bag of shredded cabbacabbage, which equaled 4 cups approximately.  A bit of my potatoes did disolve, along with the cabbage, but it thickened the soup anyhow. I like all the vegetables in this, but for me that is a long time sitting over a pot. I near halved all the cooking times and it was still plenty. I rated this a 4 for flavor. Its actually pretty good and much less salty tasting than other stews. Just a little too time consuming for a week night meal for me.

Made it in pressure cooker. Cooked meat first.  Then added veggies at end. Whole thing done in 30 mins. Kiddos and Dad loved it.

I was afraid it'd be bland so added a healthy tablespoon of diced garlic (from a jar) during the meat/onion stage.  Also added a dash of cayenne pepper for a little kick.  I needed 2-3 extra cups of broth after adding the vegetables to give it a nice consistency.  We like our stew thick and hearty but need enough liquid to dip slices of crusty baguette.  Instead of shredding the cabbage, I sliced it thin about 1/4 inch thick and kept the pieces 1 inch long.  GREAT recipe!  
Other additions/swaps that might not make a difference but you might like, added a can of corn, used 3 oz of tomato paste, diced tomato's instead of sauce.  We didn't have celery.  I like it but didn't miss it.  I added 2 tablespoons of flour mixed with 1/2 cup water at the very end to give it the stew consistency I'm used to my Grandma making.

This recipe is very good.  I am not a celery person, so I left the celery out completely!  I prepared it exactly as written minus celery and it is very yummy.  It took longer than 45 minutes for my potatoes and carrots to get tender but that only helped my stew meat to get even softer!  It was yummy!

This was super easy to make and the meat was tender and perfect, however it was a little too sweet for our tastes.  I doubled the broth and bouillon, added soy sauce and more pepper and it was perfect! I will definitely make this again and maybe add some peas next time.

No changes on the first shot. The next time I will do some changes in the spices. I prefer things a bit spicier.

This recipe it is excellent. I made it for my family one day and I turned around had to double the recipe because it seem like it’s just wasn’t enough. The only slight change I made is when I browned the beef I added a touch of basil and a pinch of salt. I definitely will make this again and again.

Great recipe.  I incorporated a few changes but tried to limit them to keep true to the original recipe.  I dusted the beef cubes with seasoned flour before browning them to help thicken the broth.  I substituted brussel sprouts that I quartered instead of shredded cabbage and added mushrooms.  Very hearty and delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

It was a delicious, easy and a nice upgrade to my usual beef stew.  I loved the addition of the cabbage .  
I did toss my stew meat  in a small amount of cornstarch before browning. The consistency was perfect to lie liking.

So good! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the added salt at the end. As at least one other reviewer noted, I was concerned I didn’t have nearly enough liquid after adding the cabbage and veggies and cooking for 30 mins. More time and even more time with the tomato paste saved things without me adding more liquid.

I loved this recipe.  I omitted the potatoes because my husband is going low carb. Wanted to make it more of a soup then  a stew so added extra beef broth, carrots and celery.  
I threw in a package of beefy onion soup mix to give it extra flavor and sprinkled in some garlic salt. The end result was exactly as I wanted.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and was very disappointed with the results. There is not enough liquid in the recipe, and after you cook each step as long as it says the beef turns into mush. While I appreciate the health benefits of cabbage, if I ever made this again I would leave it out completely add more stock, and eat a salad on the side. The cabbage makes the stew akin to the old vegetable soup diet.

It was delicious!! The only additions that I made was a sprinkle of red pepper, 2 tablespoons of tiger sauce, 16 oz total of tomato sauce and a little extra beef broth in the beginning. It was so flavorable and delish!!! I would also like to add that the time can be condensed a bit by putting the celery, potatoes and carrots in earlier so that the beef can tenderize at the same time that the celery, potatoes and carrots tenderize. There is no need to do each separately.

I made this stew and loved it.  I just didn't add tomato paste because it normally does have an overpowering taste.  I just diced up 2 tomatoes and included it.  Overall it was good and what I felt like eating on this rainy Saturday evening.

I agree its a little time consuming BUT well worth it. Only changes were one extra carrot and used almost 4 cups bone broth due to it simmering and cooking down. Excellent!!!

Absolutely the BEST stew recipe that I have made. It was a hit. I added more vegetable, therefore adjusted the broth and bouillon. Otherwise made as stated.

I actually made a lot of modifications. I had to add extra water and broth. I added corn starch to thicken it. I added peas. And I also added parsley, onion powder, garlic powder and celery salt. And I did not add the tomato sauce. I like it.

It is soooo yummy !   I seared the meat, and when the last batch was done, I scraped up the brown bits with some of the stock - cooked it low & slow till the meat was tender - I doubled the potatoes & carrots - left out the celery ( not a fan of the flavor of cooked celery )  I did S & P for each step   No slurry needed, the starchy potatoes did the job

I made a combination between this recipe and another one. It was delicious! I took the advice from someone else who altered the recipe and added 1 TBSP of A-1 and Worcestershire sauce. From my go to seasonings I added Oregano, Turmeric ,Kosher salt and Creole seasoning to give it a kick! Results one happy family, even my pickiest eater ate it all. A great way to get my children to eat cabbage which I love but they do not.

It was a hit with the whole family! Even my 3 year old who's a very picky eater ate every bit I put in his bowl and wanted more! The only change I made was added in 1 cup of veggie broth mixed with 1 tbsp. of cornstarch (just to thicken it up a bit). But all in all this will be a dish I will be making again!

My husband said this was a keeper.  I added one additional potato and a couple extra carrots.  No added salt. I used “Better Than Bouillon”.   I will make again.

This is probably the best beef stew I've made in a long time. My other half rave d about it and wished it made more.  We were a bit Leary of the cabbage, but I followed the recipe to the T and we were pleasantly surprised. It's a keeper!

I made it as directed. It was easy and delicious. Except I did use 3 carrots instead of 1, and 1.5 lbs baby gold potatoes cubed. I had to add a little more liquid when I added the veggies.  I liked that I could get the meat and onions in and cooking then take my time getting veggies prepped. Meat was tender and flavor was excellent. I was happy with the dish. It was as good or better the next day. Thank you for submission!

I did it all in a crockpot using ground celery seed and dried onion flakes in place of fresh. Left out the tomato sauce (personal preference).Thickened broth with Wondra Flour when done. Simple, easy and delicious.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly - but added a little red wine as it needed a bit more liquid when incorporating the veggies, and a dash of cayenne pepper for a little zip. Excellent!

Did not use as much tomato sauce as directed and added a punch of sugar to it. Worked out very well...used this recipe to use up cabbage in the fridge. Was tasty enough that I had no leftovers!

I cut back on the meat and only put one potato (to cut down on the starch), then put in more cabbage and a little more beef broth. Simmered it for at least 1/2 hour longer for nice tender beef. It was really good. Next time I think I'll cut out the bouillon cube to cut back on the salt.

This was delicious!  Made as directed except I added 3 cloves of garlic with the onion.   I only had red cabbage.  So, I used that and it was still yummmmy!  I did have to thicken it so we could put it in mashed potato bowls.  The whole family and 2 guests ate it up!

Exactly what I needed while I was sick. Browned the meat, carmalized the onions, scraped the brown bits off the pan then put it all in the crockpot for the day.

My husband, who HATES stews, asked if I could make this again.

I made it in our Instapot.  Pressed the "meat" option after each addition and pressure cooked it multiple times.  Melt-in-your-mouth tastiness.

Followed the recipe and added garlic when browing the beef, a couple tablespoons of steak sauce when simmering and a can of cut green beans at the end.  Made it for company and they all wanted the recipe, good indication of how delicious this was.  Definitely a "go to" recipe.

Love this stew! The only things I changed, because of personal preferences, were I exchanged celery seed for the chopped celery, added peas and more carrots, cooked it in a crockpot all day, and added a thickener just before serving. I doubled the recipe because I know my husband was going to love it as well. It's a keeper!

DH says this was the best stew I have made.  Of course, I changed some things.  For those of you who think it is wrong to rate when you've changed a recipe, I ask you - is this a contest with a grading system?  Or, are we helping others with our tried and true changes -take em or leave them? Anyway-Used, 3 bouillon cubes with 2 cups of water in place of broth and bouillon, more than 2 potatoes, hands full of baby carrots, 15 oz can tomato sauce, a splash of Worcestershire sauce, can of cream of chicken soup, and sprinkled a packet of beef gravy powder on beef before browning.  Also, added portabellas, ground, to the mix!  Yummy stuff - thanks for sharing

I loved the cabbage in this and it had good flavor. As per the directions our stew meat came out a little overcooked and our vegetables a little undercooked. So cooking times may need to be adjusted. 

I'm not really a fan of stew meat, so I may use a different cut next time like sirloin. I seasoned and floured it before browning. Some meat was overcooked some seemed ok. Again I think it's the cut of meat and cooking times do need adjusting.  I did a small dice on the veg and they were still firm after the 45 minutes. I don't mind my veg cooked like that, but my husband and kids complained.  They prefer mush. I wasn't sure if I added a full 8oz of sauce as I just dumped some leftover I had in a container in the fridge. I added a little tomato paste to be sure it had enough acid and tomato flavor. 

Overall it was yummy. Just watch your cooking times.

I made this last weekend and it was excellent, except I had leftover vegetables (I used my small crock pot instead of the large one). So, I am looking for another recipe to use them on this weekend.

Very good stew!  Added slightly more cabbage and tomato sauce than what it calls for and it was really good.  I'll make this many more times.

Turned out great, I used twice the carrots and twice the potatoes. Also, I served over a bed of wild rice. The cabbage took longer than stated to fully cook.

When I made it I found that the the time it took to allow the meat to become moist there was not enough liquid called for in the recipe. I found that by adding extra beef stock it turned out very well.

Very flavorful and hearty.  Prepared in pressure cooker on high.  Saute beef and onion, add all ingredients except potatoes and cook for 20 minutes.  Release pressure, add potatoes and cook another 20 minutes.  Used beef gravy instead of beef stock and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce to amp it up!  Served with warm homemade ciabatta bread....Fantastic flavor.

Wow! This recipe was easy and delicious. A bit time consuming but definitely worth it to get the full flavor blended and the meat extra tender. I needed to add more beef broth to cover my meat and then a bit more when I added the potatoes. I also added one clove of garlic and some rosemary. I plan to make this again and add even more cabbage next time.

Great stew.  Ran across this looking for a way to use up a head of cabbage in the frig.  Had the flavor I was looking for. A lot of beef stew recipes have a heavy tomato taste and I didn't want that. The tomato sauce in this finishes the stew nicely without an overbearing tomato taste.  Great way to get lots of veggies into non-veggie eaters.  No one knew they were eating cabbage (including my picky 75-yr-old mother--she's worse than the kids).   I normally don't rate unless I follow the recipe EXACTLY , but this one deserved it, and the tomato sauce was the only thing I adjusted (was out, so used tomato paste thinned with water).   Not only will I make again, but have already passed this along to friends and family.

This was delicious. The one substitution I made was using sweet potatoes instead of regular Idaho potatoes. Rave reviews all around - it will definitely be made again soon. Great food for fall/winter!

Pretty good stew, although I had to make a few small additions. The stew itself is quite simple, however I had to add a bit of flour in order to thicken it up. I also only added 1/2 a can of the tomato paste, and used a small can of diced tomatoes instead of just the full can of tomato paste. The end result was pretty good! Oh, I also added a tiny bit more beef flavor as well!

Excellent, the only change I made is to add turnip to it.  It comes out almost like a beef borscht. It is particularly good with a dollop of sour cream in it.

I make it just like the recipe but add a little extra water. I double it and freeze it. I add the potatoes later so they don't turn to mush after I freeze it. I also use new potatoes with the skin on. I've made this several times.

This was absolutely delicious - the beef stew recipe i have been looking for for years! The only changes I made was omitting the bouillon cube, didn't have any, increasing the beef stock to 4 cups because I like the liquid & adding 2 tablespoons of flour because my husband likes it thick. I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow. Thanks for a great recipe!

Really great flavor, only modification I made was 4 cups of beef broth and 2 cubes of beef bouillon so it would go further to feed my boys. This made it more like soup than stew.

It was really good, I did slightly change it but only for the better. I used venison steak instead of beef becaus that's what's in the freezer. Also I used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce. I doubt that makes any difference. And I added probably double the broth because it seemed extremely dry, but the end product was really good this way.

I didn't have a bay leaf or cabbage which must be what is needed for the flavor.  Mine was not flavorful.  All the reviews were outstanding, so I'll definitely try again!

Delicious. I have never cared for traditional stew, but loved this. I only made a couple of minor changes. I used turnips instead of potatoes since my husband is diabetic. I think the turnips made it better than potatoes would have. I also used organic "better that boullion" for boullion and broth since I was using grass fed organic beef.

I followed the recipe and added some extra broth with the vegetables. At the end I used a little beef broth and cornstarch to thicken it up but it still lacked something. I think it gets better the longer it sets but if you only wait 20 minutes it seems very bland. It was good enough that I will try again but maybe add some corn and peas.

The perfect stew!  We do make changes according to some of the reviews but I think it would be great without them.  We add some red wine, use beef stock and no water.  Add 2 cloves of pressed garlic while browning the onions, before we add the meat back in.  Will be a regular dinner during fall and winter.

OMG! I just finished a huge bowl of this and would have had more if I wasn't so stuffed! I've been cooking for the last four and a half decades and have made more than my share of stews. I would have to say that this is the best darned pot of stew that I've ever made! Now, I can't stand folks who rate a recipe 5 stars and then go on to tell you the myriad changes they made to the original. Submit your own recipe if your version is so terrific. That being said, LOL, here are the minimal changes that I made. For health reasons I used reduced sodium broth and salt free tomato sauce. I also found a salt free onion soup mix and used a tablespoon of that instead of the cube of salt-laden bullion. I also left out the celery as I didn't have any and caramelized the onions to add a bit more depth of flavor. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Oh, I added a bit of flour towards the end as I am not partial to thin stew. Even with the salt reduced to almost nothing, the taste was wonderful. All the flavors melded together without any one ingredient outshining the others. All in all, a very easy, flavorful stew for a chilly or raw fall or winter night. Thank you Paul for submitting.

Let me join the ranks of the raving reviewers. I am usually not a stew lover but I had some top round steak I needed to use and found this recipe. I made it exactly as written (with the exception of not peeling the potatoes) and it was delicious. Just the right consistency and the cabbage flavor is very subtle. I'll definitely be making it again.

Great recipe!  I followed the directions, but did add extra veges and more broth- brussel sprouts, extra potato (golden), and 1 more carrot and celery stalk.  I also seasoned at each step (tasting with each season).  Finally, I also thickened with pureed cooked beans instead of tomato sauce. Because of the additional veges, I had to let it simmer about 20 minutes longer. This one went into my recipe box.  My husband loved it and we have enough for several nights!

I made this recipe with a few changes. The biggest change I made was substituting lamb stew meat for the beef. It's actually cheaper at our local butcher shop and tastes wonderful in the tomato broth. Like patreeseeya I too increased the amounts of tomato (crushed is my favorite) and broth and I also doubled the seasoning. My husband isn't a big fan of soup/stew but he really likes this and so do I!

It was my first time making this and it turned out great with a few minor changes. First, I used  6oz tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. Next, I added my own spices and used bell peppers & mushrooms (I didn't have any celery). Lastly, I through in the tomato paste in the pot along with the potatoes, carrots, and everything else and cook it on medium/low temperature. Overall it took me about 2 and a half hours :~)

Amazing!  This is the best stew I have ever had.  The only thing I did differently was double the broth amount like a few others had stated halfway through I realized it wasn't going to be enough liquid.  My husband and 3 year old loved it.  I will be making a double batch again very soon to freeze some, thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious! I doubled the broth and added garlic while the meat was simmering. Otherwise I kept everything else the same.

Very good, but made as is, broth is a little short.  Need to double broth recipe to get the right amount.  Healthy recipe, but would have preferred some addition of a little spice for more flavor.  Was a bit bland without any seasonings.

Based on past reviews I stayed with the original recipe, but doubled up to make sure we had left overs and glad I did!  My son was going crazy with all the great smells while cooking and it is time consuming, but pretty easy to make.   I will definitely make it again, but next time will add a bit more broth.

Oh my goodness, this turned out delicious! I only added extra carrots and followed the recipe.. I made 2 pots at once (one for the freezer) and it cost me around $10. My kids keep coming in and saying dinner smells great : ) im going to serve with rice and a sweet cornbread!

This is wonderful as is, or as a base to start from. I usually double the broth and load it down with veggies. Since I prefer the carrots and celery to be soft I add them when I put in the onions. And I found out that the tomato sauce is optional when I forgot to add it and the stew still turned out excellent.

Good start, but triple or quadruple -- I usually make enough soup to freeze at least 8 quarts for future use and to give some to my kids.  I also boil finely shredded onions and cabbage (almost a whole head) -- they just about dissolve and give the soup body.  This is the base for my vegetable beef soup -- add lots of veggies - try rutabega, acorn squash, turnips.  I eat vegetables in my soup that I'd never eat on their own.  I leave out the potatoes as they don't freeze well, but you can put 1/2 cup barley or tiny macaroni instead.

It is our favorite!  Perfect without any changes.  My husband has never liked stew because the vegetables are usually overcooked.  He raved and raved about how perfect they came out, just by following the preparation instructions.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Excellent recipe! made this last night and followed the recipe exactly except added extra vegetables. Both my husband and i loved it, and i can't wait to have leftovers for lunch. Make this on a cold night and serve with a glass of red and some crusty bread.
