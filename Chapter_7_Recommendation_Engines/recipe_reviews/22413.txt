I have had this recipe for years and they are great.  The only thing is if you over bake the cookies they will get really crunchy.  But they are yummy and a real kid pleaser.

A classic!! These are so much fun for kids to make and it's such a crowd pleaser.  I usually bake the cookies half way through and then place the chocolate kiss in the center.  I place the cookies back in the oven for the last 2-3 minutes and the "kiss" stays in place.  These are great ideas for get toghether and school/office functions.

I took this to a holiday cookie exchange: big hit!  This was easy and even fun to make, and they look great too.  I would recommend the Reese's brand peanut butter: it actually seemed to have less fat & sugar than most of the other brands.

Wonderful, classic cookie.  Great for gift-giving at the holidays.  I like a slightly sweeter cookie, so I increased the white and brown sugar just a bit.

I made them just like the recipe said and they were delicious.  I would underbake them a little bit, no more than 8 minutes; they harden up after sitting.  Also, I wonder if people were having trouble with the cookies breaking because of the sugar.  I rolled a tray of balls and then dipped them all in the sugar so the sugar didn't get inside of the balls.

Turned out great - wonderful flavor! I followed JBAILEY's advice and cooked them for 7 1/2 minutes -- added the kiss and cooked a 1 1/2 minutes longer!  I also added a bit more peanut butter.  Perfection!  As far as others commented about breakage - make the cookies small.  I ended up with 49 cookies and none broke.

If you like the taste of peanut butter and chocolate, these are probably some of the best cookies you will ever taste.  This recipe has it down to a science.  I usually only end up with about 36 though because I roll them too big despite my best efforts.  Try and get as close to 48 as you can though.  The smaller cookies tend not to break as easily.  What worked best for me was baking them for 7.5 minutes, then adding the chocolate, and baking them for an additional minute to a minute-and-a-half.  That left them nice a soft.  To help prevent them from breaking too easily, I let them cool on the pan for three or four minutes.

These cookies were a Christmas favorite while I was growing up. Now that I am married, I am working on perfecting the recipe myself. In the meantime, my mom sends a few batches around Christmas time. My husband is hard-pressed to get me to share them with him!

Just the recipe I was looking for. These sold out even before the bake sale officially started. We opted for the longer baking time for a more desirable crunch.

The cookies are delicious! I baked them longer until the edges turned light brown. Since I like chocolates slightly melted and cookies a bit warm, before the next day consumption, I put them in the microwave for approx. 15 secs- depending on the numbers of cookies. Yummy yummy yummy, and I didn't even like peanut butter.

I used butter flavored crisco. In response to the lady who said these were awful, can't figure out what you did wrong. These 
quite possibly, are the EASIEST cookie in the world to make. Worst part is unwrapping the kisses, but if my 3 yr old can
 figure it out, well, the rest of you will be fine. My only problem......getting them out of my sight, so some will be left for the holidays.

These are the best peanut blossoms I've ever tried!  The cookie stays moist and chewy. All others I've tried turn hard and crunchy when they cool.  I used the medium scoop from Pampered Chef, but filled it only 3/4 full.  The small scoop would be perfect.

This is a family tradition.  I just love this cookie.  If you find that the cookies are breaking apart (as some here have noted) just cook them for 8 minutes instead of 10 and don't push the chocolates in too hard.

I just adore this cookie.

This is a great tasting and very easy recipe! I only had crunchy peanut butter, and it still came out great. I didn't bother using a mixer, and I don't think it made much difference. The dough was pretty easy to mix by hand.

I changed this recipe up a bit by using "special" kisses... caramel, peanut butter, etc.  I also did this with bite size/ fun size candy bars.  Some worked better than others :)

What a great cookie.  I used real butter, made them a little on the small side, and only cooked them 7 1/2 minutes.  Once I pressed the kiss into the middle, I put it back in the oven for 1 minute.  I usually use a pampered chef stone for baking cookies, but found they cracked less on a regualr cookie sheet.  I got 48 cookies from this recipe.  BTW, this cookie does not freeze well.  The kiss gets rock hard.

These are awesome and are always a favorite, especially at Christmas time.  You will need to let them cool completely on a rack before putting them away, as the chocolate kiss tends to melt a bit initially when put into the center of the cookie and it needs time to harden again.

Mmmm...I searched a long time to find this recipe after losing it when I moved. Mine were too big and therefore fell apart easily. I had one small cookie that held together nicely. So make them smaller than a 1" ball or you'll be eating them over the sink. But they still taste like 5 stars no matter what the size :)

Great recipe!! I made these little kiss treats to give to coworkers as a pre-Valentine's day goodie. I ended up with about 25 cookies. The kisses are a bit soft even after letting them cool for four hours.

Just like my mom's Christmas cookies.  I used crunchy peanut butter because that was what I add, and it actually added a nice texture to the cookies.  Just make sure you get those kisses in before the cookies harden!

Great family favorite.  They never last very long in our house.
The only change I have made is to use 3 mini kisses instead of one big kiss.  Give you three bites of chocolate and is highly recommended by my 2 year old, much easier for him to eat!

This is an easy cookie to make for any occasion and they are always a huge hit!  I made these to fill baked goods boxes for my co-workers for the holidays.  These cookies taste better if they are crispier and not so chewy because of all of the oil in the cookie.  So, I recommend cooking them until the edges are browned.

This is a great recipe, very easy to make.  The hershey kisses put a nice spin on regular peanut butter cookies.  I had a few cookies fall apart but the cook didn't mind, I got to sample. I will definitely make these again.

Mine didn't crack when I put the kiss on top, but were yummy just the same. I also put an upside down Reese's pieces (smaller one) and those were yummy also. They do melt more, so you may want to cool the cookies slightly before adding those. Very good though, these get gobbled up!

These were ok. I found them really dry and crumbly and thought the extra sugar sprinkled on top was really unnecessary. Probably won't make again.

These cookies were just ok... the dough was very sticky, i had to add more flour just to get it to not stick to my hands.  Like other reviewers, i baked mine for only about 7.5 minutes, and they turned out good.  After they were cooled, they were very crumbly and kept falling apart.... wouldnt hold onto the kiss very well.  Might make again....

Followed recipe exactly. Not sweet enough. I suggest increasing ammount of white sugar, and possibly decreasing brown sugar because it was too molassesy for me.

These are wonderful.  If you want to freeze them, don't completely bake the cookies and DON'T put the hershey kisses in them.  Freeze.  When you want to serve them, thaw them out...bake for a few minutes (until done) and add the hershey kisses.  Yummy!

Delicious. A little crumbly, but I've never tried a recipe for this type of cookie that wasn't. This is the best recipe I've found for Peanut Butter Kiss cookies, as my siblings and I used to call them.

These taste great and i make them every year.  However, with this recipe the cookie is not as soft and chewy as I prefer for a peanut butter cookie.  I think I will have to start experimenting with similar recipes.

No matter how many different cookies I make (and that's a lot!) these remain my favorite. The combination of peanut butter and chocolate is great, and they taste so good a bit warm so the kiss is still soft!

One of the best cookies on the planet. I make these but my cousin makes them even better (she must have a magic touch). She made these for my sister's bridal shower and they were gone in minutes! I wonder who ate too many....hehehe!!

These cookies turned out great!  The taste was wonderful, and they seemed very light.  I've made Peanut Blossoms before, but I think I like these best.

Oh yea...! Delicious! I especially like eating them about 5 minutes after placing the kiss on the cookie. What memories! I remember making these with my mom and then with my children. Oh, how I remember my little son's face full of concentration as he placed the kiss just perfectly on the cookie! Now, the teenager gobbles them down as fast as I can make them! These are a standard on our Christmas cookie tray and at in our home at the holidays.

These were GREAT. I took these to a christmas eve party at my boyfriends house and literally had people walking by me with a cookie in their mouth giving me a thumbs up. This cookie plate was the only plate that was licked clean. They had a strong peanut butter flavor which was great-- and the cookies turned out cooked perfectly by baking them only 8 minutes... taking them out and inserting the hershey kiss, and putting them back in the oven for 1 minute.  They hardened up after cooling and not one cookie crumbled apart. GREAT!

Very tasty cookies but they are bit too crumbly.  They fall apart easily.  They have a great peanut butter flavor though.

This is a very good recipe. I don't think I've ever made these before, but I've always loved it when other people have made them. Mine turned out good, but (my fault), I added a little too much salt.  Very good though. I baked them for ten minutes.  I got about 40 cookies out of it.

These cookies were a HUGE hit at the party I brought them to. They are very delicious and somehow the kiss, still in it's original shape, was soft. Nice! I did make minor changes to the recipe - I used crunchy PB. I didn't change anything else about the recipe, so I am not sure why I only was able to make 20 cookies out of the batch. Other than that, I will DEFINTELY be making these again and again!
Thanks for sharing.

This cookie is a great combination of peanut butter and chocolate. My husband and I love these!! Try to keep the balls the size recommended in the recipe - they hold together better. And I think they're better when they're slightly undercooked. And make sure you let the cookies cool completely before storing them - the chocolate kiss needs to harden back up. Enjoy!!

Not a bad recipe, although they were a little dry and crumbled too easy after baking.  Had many broken cookies... tasted good though.

I like how the cookie stays nice and puffy.  They taste great and the kids love helping by putting on the kiss at the end.

I love this recipie. Sometimes, instead of the kisses, I use Dove milk chocolate Promises (you can get a bag in the candy aisle, the ones in the blue and silver wrapper)Yum!!!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE.. my mom has been making this as long as i can remember.. well im 19 so only 19 years. We used to use an old peanut butter cookie recipe and she had another one but they were both lost over moving, but this recipe looked the same and DEFINATLY tastes the same. I know some people that don't use peanut butter.. but there is NO other kind of cookie for the holidays except this one. I strongly recomend it for kids to learn to make and it should be our NATIONAL cookie (hehehe)

A holiday "must have" at my house.  I used to help my grandmother make these when I was little (my job was to unwrap the candies).  Now, I make them every Christmas and Valentine's Day.

Peanut Blossoms are great to make with children, and quick n' easy.  This is a wonderful cookie to make and give to show your love for someone by the Hershey kiss pressed in the middle.  Above all, THEY TASTE GREAT!

My mother made these cookies when I was a little girl and they have always been my favorite.  When I could not find the recipe, I used this one.  Yummy!  Just as I remember!!!  =)
