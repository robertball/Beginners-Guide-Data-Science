Preheat oven to 200 degrees. When oven reaches that temp turn oven off- then put biscuits in for one hour to rise. Perfect!  ** Update: We did the same as previous suggestions- only use 1/2 the amount of shortening and use butter for teh other 1/2 remaining amount. Definitely makes these much more flavorful. WOW! We just made these today for breakfast. We followed recipe exactly. My one recommendation - you MUST have the biscuits touching the other biscuits on the cookie sheet as they bake. We have made 2 other recipes and didn't put them to each other and they didn't rise. We put these together and they were perfect! I am beyond thankful for this recipe! No more Grands biscuits for us- they don't even compare to these. Thank you so much Karin! ** Also- this allrecipes.com site is the best **

I LOVE these biscuits. These are exactly what I've been looking for!I have always been disappointed with any other biscuit I've made from scratch (hard, dry) and I can't stand canned biscuits (sodium galore!).  Yummy! I make the whole batch, freeze them, and reheat them a few at a time in the oven.

I've been looking for a recipe like this.  Sooo good.  They taste just like our favorite biscuits at Cracker Barrel.  My husband loves them.

Delicious!  I had to use powdered buttermilk, but they came out wonderfully.  My family ate heaps of them and my son said I need to make these from now on.  A keeper!

Delicious!  These biscuits have the texture of a tender buttermilk biscuit and the rich flavor of a yeast roll.  Love 'em!  A tip for lazy bakers... I usually pat biscuits into a rectangle and then cut them with a pizza cutter instead of cutting with a biscuit cutter and re-rolling scraps.  Square biscuits taste just as good as round ones!

I used this recipe in one of my culinary classes, as a biscuit to use for our bread baskets. i was disappointed with the end result... the dough was stiff, the biscuits never rose, and the flavor was lacking.

These biscuits turned out great!  They really are a cross between a biscuit and a roll.  I made enough to freeze and pull a few out at a time.  A keeper!

Instead of making biscuits, I wrapped 1 lb of 
pre-cooked cocktail sausages with the dough and then baked according to the directions.  This recipe is definitely part of my permanent collection.  The next time I used margarine instead of shortening and we couldn't tell the difference.

These were very good and easy to make. Mine did not rise that much but I think that was do to my yeast. We enjoyed them and will make them again.

these are the best biscuits i've ever made!  everyone says so.  they take a little more effort and time but it's well worth it!  i made them late at night so i was going to cut the recipe in 1/2 but decided not to at the last minute.  i'm glad i didnt because my toddler son ate 3!  mine didnt brown on top and i used lemon/milk instead of buttermilk and they were fab!

I live in Canada and haven't heard of angel biscuits.  They are wonderful with a light texture and a mild yeasty taste.  I used all butter and brushed the tops with milk.  They are similar to the baking powder biscuits I have been making for 40 years but the yeast is a really nice change in flavour.  These biscuits stay fresh longer than regular baking powder biscuits.

P.S.  I tried this recipe again, adding grated cheddar and finely chopped green onion tops.  They were fabulous!  I will post again when I try a different flavour.  As I don't drink buttermilk, I keep on hand buttermilk powder bought in bulk.  It was a good substitute because I was able to reconstitute it using warm water.  I found it best to spread out the biscuits so that the ones in the center would brown.  I use shiny pans with parchment paper so that may make a difference to the browning.

These really are a cross between a biscuit and a roll. They turned out as described but they do not rise much, although they rise more during baking. Very good texture (heavy)... but to me the yeast taste clashes a bit with the buttermilk flavor. If you want a biscuit with a yeast flavor, you will love these. I will probably make either rolls or biscuits in the future. Thanks for sharing though, I always have fun experimenting with new recipes :-)

Got rave reviews with these at Christmas. A trick my grandma taught me to help breads raise: heat oven to 200 degrees for 5-10 mins with a cake pan filled with inch or 2 of water inside. turn oven off and wait about 5 mins then add dough to raise. works great.

I was given this recipe 40 years ago by my husband's granny, Nellie Long, who lived in Poteet, Texas.  The biscuits were always wonderful when she made them.  She did use lard instead of shortening.  Would we dare?  I have had mixed results making them.  However, when the angels are smiling, the biscuits are as wonderful as when Granny Long made them.  I had forgotten about the recipe until I saw it on this site.  Granny Long's recipe was for about 60 biscuits, so I was glad to see it had been scaled down.

These biscuits are the best I have made so far!  
My husband and three children really enjoyed them.  
My husband said they reminded him of the famous "Popeye's" biscuits.  
I brushed melted butter on them before I put them in the oven.  
They came out a nice golden brown.  
To top it off they were very simple to make.

These are truly delicious. Great texture, good keepers if frozen and rewarmed well wrapped.  Mine rose beautifully, my suggestion to others who have had difficulty is to make sure your yeast and other leavenings are absolutely fresh, and don't kill the yeast.  Also, warm the buttermilk slightly.  Thanks.

I had never heard of an angel biscuit and was eager to try these..the disciption of a *roll-like biscuit* is an apt one.  The recipe wasn't difficult, although I had to let them rise longer than the stated time and they never raised as much as I expected.  I find the flavor of these a bit *strange* but that is probably just me.  I think I will stick to biscuits when I want biscuits and rolls when I want rolls.

Made these late yesterday afternoon for a dinner party at a friends house. Was a bit worried since I so rarely use yeast. Per the suggestions, I added 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter and preheated the oven to 200.   Unlike some of the other reviews, my biscuits did almost double in size and baked beautifully. I certainly got more than 24 biscuits, however. Everyone raved about them!

I had never heard of "Angel Biscuits" before finding this recipe on AR; then just the other night my neighbor was telling me how much she likes  angel biscuits. I knew then I would have to try these.  So, I made then tonight, making 1/2 the recipe....only problem was, I failed to use only half the water and ended up using the entire 1/4 cup. As you can imagine, this made the dough very wet and goopy! I didn't want to throw it all away so decided to try to salvage by adding flour until I could cut out w/a biscuit cutter. I didn't attempt to roll out with a rolling pin, just patted into a nice thick circle and cut out. I baked four for my husband and I, and froze the rest before rising.  I did bake them a few minutes longer than stated since they were so wet, but I was very pleasantly surprised when they came out really tasty! I can't wait to try again -- this time using the correct measurements!  I have a hunch they're going to be even better when made properly.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Yum!  I used butter instead of shortening, and made sure they touched (just barely) when rising.  They were light and delicious.  Thanks, Karin!

This is by far my favorite biscuit recipe, and I've tried others without the success I have with this one. Last night I added crumbled cheddar cheese to the dough and brushed the biscuits with a mixture of garlic powder, butter, and parsley flakes before and after baking. This recipe will make "to die for" Cheddar Bay Biscuits! Try it.

These look like canned biscuits out of the oven, but have the texture of a sourdough bicuit.  I made the whole recipe, but only baked a few on the first day.  The rest I froze on a cookie sheet till firm, then stored in the deep freeze in a freezer bag.  Later in the week, I took them out and let them rise, it took about an hour and a half.  They were fine, just like the first day, and a lot less work.  I may make this a regular.

Absolutely a wonderful recipe. These bisuits are so light, soft and fluffy. I made these for breakfast and were such a hit that I made more for dinner! Give it a try-you will not be sorry.

Oh my, now these are my kind of biscuits.  I halved the recipe and made 12 nice size biscuits.  Just patted the dough out and cut out 12 squares, that way there is no wasted dough.  I used all butter for the shortening, and that gave it that awesome buttery flavor.  These are so tender yet hold up to creamy sausage gravy.  I will be making these from now on, so easy yet soooo delicious.  These certainly remind me of the Hardy's biscuits.

These were beautiful and very delicious. My husband loved them, which is always a good thing. I did not leave them out for an hour to rise, only ten minutes as I was in a hurry. They were still very light, fluffy and they rose beautifully. Almost like a cross between a biscuit and a dinner roll.

These really are the bomb. I was setting out to make a savory hamburger bun, thinking these would achieve that size. Nope, pretty much stayed at the 2 1/2" cutter size but , they're good. So it's sliders tonight!

These turned out pretty good, but I thought they were a little on the dry side, and could have been more flavorful. They were really pretty though, and not too difficult.  I used half shortening and half butter.  They did not rise much, but then I set them on top of my stove while my oven was on (the oven is older and gets hot to the touch on the outside when in use) and they rose quite well- seems they need to be in a VERY warm, almost hot spot to rise. I had to add a bit more flour than was called for because the dough was incredibly sticky and impossible to knead when I turned it out of the bowl. Still they got demolished when I served them for Easter. Everyone was impressed.

Although these tasted yummy, it was a bit of an effort to knead the dough.  Of course, the result was worth the time and mess.

Excellent recipe.  The first batch are not as good as those made later in the week.  The yeast helps the later batches to rise higher than the first batch.  We love it because we can make one batch early in the week and enjoy "freshly made" biscuits the rest of the week!

I never rate recipes, but I had to with this one. I have been looking for a perfect biscuit recipe for ten years. Every one I try comes out like a hockey puck. These were amazing! My search is over! I used 6 Tbs. Butter and 6 Tbs. Cisco. 2 c. Bread flour and 3 c. All - purpose.  Make sure they are lightly touching, and don't handle the dough too much. Light and fluffy, and I didn't notice the yeast taste that others commented on.

Just made these to see if they would be good enough to use as ham biscuits for a gathering.  They are wonderful!  I didn't have butter so I used 1/4 cup crisco and 1/2 cup butter crisco (what I had on hand).  I sampled them with my son and he couldn't stop "mmmm"ing!!  I did use the 200 degree warm oven rising method.  Will make again!

Maybe they would have risen higher if I'd warmed the milk as the other reviewer suggested. Good flavor and color but not the rise I like from my biscuits. A cross between a bread and a biscuit as far as texture. I'll stick with either a regular biscuit recipe or a roll recipe. When I make biscuits, I want them to come out like biscuits!

These are good.  Despite not rising very much, they turned out light. I halved the recipe, but not the amount of yeast. They did not taste too "yeasty" to me. I made the whole thing in the food processor.  I would make these again.

This recipe is sooooo good!  Follow the advice of previous reviewers and place your biscuits close together on the pan to rise.  My husband has been requesting these often. He can hardly wait for them to rise and bake.  My kids have used a whole bottle of honey eating them with butter and honey. Ummmmm!  Thanks you for the excellent recipe!

These were really good.  I let my bread machine do the mixing and I ended up adding about 2 1/2 extra cups of flour to get the right consistency.  I don't know if using the bread machine made the difference or not but I needed more than the 5 cups listed.

My mother told me about this recipe.  I made them and now I never want to make a regular biscuit again.  They are so good!  The third time I made them, we didn't have any buttermilk so I used regular milk and I also used half shortening and half butter.  Big mistake!  The original recipe is perfect as it is and I won't try to change it again!  Thank you for this great recipe!

These were very good. I took the advice of another reviewer and preheated the oven to 200 degrees, turned it off and let the biscuits rise for one hour. I also cut the shorting to 1/2 cup total and used 1/4 cup of Crisco and 1/4 cup of butter. The problem was that I put all 24 on one baking sheet and they all ran together and the round biscuits took on the shape of the baking sheet and  became square. It certainly didn't hurt the taste and could still be separated. However, you might want to space them out a tiny bit more. A very good recipe and I will make again

I LOVE this recipe!  I have used one like it for years which my Aunt Jean gave me.  It makes wonderful biscuits, but I also use it to make cinnamon bread, cinnamon rolls, and Christmas tree bread, with the candied fruit and nuts in it.  It is wonderful, makes a lot and everyone loves anything I make from it. Plus, it is FAST to work with!  Thank you, Karin for this recipe!

I have never made biscuits before but I have had angel biscuits and these were not the same as I have had.  I don't know what I did wrong but these were not light and airy as I have read but they were not bad or not great...just ok for the most part tasted like a can biscuit without the height...

I've made other variations of angel biscuits before, but this is by far the best recipe I've come across!  There isn't a "yeasty" aftertaste, and they rose mile high.  In fact, within fifteen minutes of the rising time, they were doubled!  They "poofed" even higher while baking.  Moist, tender, flaky, delicious...can't wait for hubby to get home to try these!  Excellent, excellent recipe...it is a keeper, and my new angel biscuit recipe for sure!

excellent biscuit recipe!!  I love that they are not a dry biscuit.  They do not rise a whole lot, but they are still great tasting.Using a rapid rise yeast, rather than regular yeast, gives them a little extra lift.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and did 1/2 shortening, 1/2 margerine (or butter)...for taste purposes.

I have searched for years for a receipe that was like my grandmothers. I finally found this one and it was great. My whole family was amazed at how much they tasted like the ones we had grown up with. I suggest anyone try this biscuit receipe.

These were pretty easy to make. My kid loves biscuits and thought it was cool he could make his own. My mom loves angel biscuits and thought this recipe was great! I thought it was pretty good. Definitely worth the little effort they take to make and makes a large quantity for pennies!

Warning: If you have a hard time eating "just one" then don't make this recipe! If my family wasn't here to gobble these things up, I'd have eaten the whole batch myself. They are THAT good! I didn't have shortening so used butter instead. Not sure if that made them better or worse…but I will be doing it that way from now on because of the great results. My aunt gave me an old recipe from a 90 yr old lady from her church. It's almost exact to this one, except you can refrigerate the dough for up to 2 weeks, punching down daily & use as needed. Then form by hand, put in cold oven, set it at 400, then when it reaches full heat, turn to 425.  I'm going to try it with this one since the ingredients are alike.

Wow! I managed to completely mess up the construction of the biscuit (why I added the milk/yeast before cutting in the butter, I have no idea. Not enough coffee)yet they still turned out wonderfully. The only other change I mad was using almond milk. I highly recommend giving this recipe a try.

These biscuits were amazing! I am SO Glad I gave them a try. I was worried about finding a "warm" non-drafty place to put them & preheated the oven on warm" & turned it off & it worked out great. These were light & fluffy. I will make these again for sure! Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loved these biscuits. I am know for my hockey puc biscuits and am a seasoned cook...but still am never able to make good fluffy biscuits, no matter what recipe I try. My son said "I hope u saved the recipe, because these are the best biscuits you have ever made...pleae don't make any other kind" With a compliment like that, you know I will never make any others. I did use 3 cups of white whole wheat flour and 2 cups of AP flour instead of all white flour. I also used butter instead of shortening. It worked great.

I have made these biscuits for years and have found the dough very versitle.  We love them as biscuits, and also use the dough for pockets filled with chicken & cream cheese topped with gravy.  We also use them when camping and roast the dough over the fire on a hotdog stick, then drizzle with butter and honey.  They also make great pigs in a blanket over a fire.  Just roast a hotdog, then wrap the dough around the hotdog and roast again until the dough is cooked.  Our kids look forward to this every time we have a camp fire.  (When using at the campfire, I roll the dough out on a cookie sheet and cut into serving sized pieces so that the person taking the dough only touches the piece that they use).

We made a whole wheat version of this and loved it. We use whole wheat for every bread we make and it worked great in this recipe too. We always add 1 T vital gluten to each cup of  whole wheat to give it better texture - reduce the flour by the same amount.

These are pretty good as rolls. Maybe I messed up the recipe, but mine turned out as pillowy rolls, and nothing at all like good old American-style biscuits.  I'll still serve them at brunch tomorrow.

These turned out pretty good.  They made a ton, I halved the recipe and still got over 25 small biscuits.  Next time I won't roll the dough out as thin, maybe they will rise a bit higher that way.

Excellent recipe!  I moved from Cali to Texas and have never heard of angel biscuits, however I'm glad I stumbled across them!  I didn't let them rise (I hate reading directions), but I still got a good oven-spring and my excessively picky 3 year old loves them!  Definitely better than Grands any time!  I used butter instead of shortening (limited to what I had on hand) and I added extra salt and one more tbsp of sugar.  Perfection!  Thanks for posting!  I think I will try to add cheddar and garlic to them to make some cheddar bay biscuits as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks!!!

Although these were not what I was specifically looking for, these turned out fluffy and tender. Not heavy at all.  The dough will be a bit soft and sticky to work with, but not terrible to work with by any means.  I omitted 1/2 cup flour  and used that plus about 1/4 cup extra on my surface for kneading so I would not get a dough that was too stiff.  (I did not knead all of it into the dough though, just enough to make it easy to handle.)  I opted for half salted butter and half shortening in the recipe.  I rolled the dough out and squared it up and then used a pizza cutter to cut into squares.  (I think squares taste the same as circles but are much faster, lol) I brushed the tops with melted butter and then let them rise per the directions. I baked them on parchment on a brownie sheet.  The timing was just right for my oven and elevation. I really enjoyed these and so did my family.  For some reason the guests were not finishing them? Are biscuit people like brownie and chocolate chip cookie people?  Just one particular one is what they want? Our kids really enjoy exploring new flavors and foods so maybe I am just lucky for that. Definitely worth trying. The four stars is because they were not received well by the guests.  A five star recipe is when the guests leave the table with the plates cleaned and wanting more.  Thanks for the recipe, will keep it in my recipe box for when I want this type of fluffy biscuit.

OKay, so my only complain with these is they didn't rise once in the oven. I let them set and rise for an hr... they doubled in size. I brushed butter on the tops before popping them in the oven. This seemed to flatten them down and bit. I figured they would puff up once baked but NOPE! They ended up being pretty thin. Although, they tasted good... not great....I wasn't thrilled with this one but good none the less. It made a ton so I put a bunch in the freezer.

Even with the substitutions I made these were amazing. I substituted 1c buttermilk with sour cream and half the shortening with butter, just due to what I had on hand. They were light and flaky and gone in a flash. The kids begged and finished their chicken just to have another!

Eating these biscuits piping hot is really heavenly.  In fact, I filled up on biscuits and didn't eat the rest of my meal.  The downside: long prep time and they don't reheat well.  The recipe makes a lot.  Even when I baked these in Bogota, Colombia (elevation 8,661 feet compared to Denver's mere 5380 feet) and they didn't raise properly, they still tasted good.

I have never been a fan of baking powder biscuits but my husband loves them. These are just wonderful, I can now make biscuits that I can also enjoy. I took another reviewers advice and warmed the milk but other than that, Just Perfect.

I've made various recipes for angel biscuits over the last 30+ years and my family has always enjoyed them.  However,for some reason this recipe is even better than the version I usually use.  I don't know why. Maybe it's the rising time or the fact there's less sugar in these, but they're just extra fluffy and tasty. My very picky 6-year old  granddaughter said I had to go on Allrecipes and tell everyone they're the best!  She obviously thinks so, because she ate 9 of them! Yes, that's right - a third of the recipe! I encourage everyone who likes biscuits to make these.

These were very yummy! I made about 24 biscuits. They were really flaky and tasted good with anything. I don't think that they rose to nearly double, but they tasted fine and I was kind of in a hurry. I didn't make any changes to the recipe itself, and I know I'll  make these again! (My mom is downstairs as I write this, sneaking some from the bag.)Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I used this recipee the other night when I wanted a quick buscuit recipee with dinner. The yeast gets them started and the Baking soda/powder makes them even fluffier while baking.
My guests raved and an hour after they are in the pan, You can pop them in the oven.   Whats not to love

I really liked this recipe.  The yeast really makes a difference in creating a light and fluffy biscuit.  After seeing some of the reviews complaining of lack of flavor, I opted to use half shortening and half unsalted butter...a suggestion I highly recommend.  I also chilled the dough overnight.  This may also help those who had difficulty with a too soft/wet dough.

Really excellent.  I had no baking soda, but it was not a problem.  Though they don't rise much while resting (despite the yeast), they came out perfectly from the oven.  So don't get stressed if they still look flat.  I followed the advice to make sure they touch - I don't know if it helped, but they are great!

Also, this is mega-versitile.  With some of the dough, I rolled it out and sprinkled cinn & sugar in there, and it was a fine cinnamon roll.  Thanks!

These are just great!  My husband made these for dinner last night along with some beef stew, and they are so good.  He followed the directions exactly....this has become our new favourite biscuit recipe. Next time, we might try making these with butter instead of shortening.

These were great!  I couldn't believe how many of these my family ate.  I only had one problem and I don't think it was the recipe, I think it was my yeast.  They didn't rise very well so I'm going to buy new yeast and try again.  It didn't matter though, the flavor was wonderful.  I served them with honey and butter as well as strawberry preserves.

Met all my expectations, very good. May bake at 375 next time as bottoms started to burn at 425. Top didn't brown much, but who cares I smothered them with creamed turkey, or butter and jelly.This now will replace Betty Crocker's biscuit recipe.

The flavor of these biscuits is wonderful. Making them is quite easy too. I think I should have added a touch more shortening. I also should have brushed the tops with butter as the biscuits didn't brown like they should. Mine also didn't rise like I thought they would. More b.p. next time perhaps. I still think this is a wonderful recipe and I will keep it and fiddle with it. One big question though...at whose house did this recipe make 24 bicuits? At mine it only made 14! :0) We like BIG biscuits.

Nice light biscuits, stayed fresh longer than regular baking powder ones.  Didn't brown much, might try brushing them with milk next time.  Didn't raise double before baking, but raised nicely in the oven.  These were a hit with company, according to my hubby, it's a "keeper" recipe.

I also had problems with rising...though they did rise some and they still tasted good. I also used wheat flour for 1/5 of the flour which may have added to the problem.

Delicious. I made this twice in one day. Each time w/a different yeast option and one worked much better for me. Either way, the family loved this tender flaky biscuit.

Not sure why but Biscuits came out flat and crumbly and tasted like baking powder.   I buy my yeast in bulk online and just used it to make  yeast rolls that turned out beautifully.

A local restaurant serves biscuits (with or without gravy) that seem like a cross between a yeast roll and a baking powder biscuit.  I had hoped that this recipe would come close to them.  Wrong.  They hardly rose at all so were more dense than they should have been.  Tasted OK, but only that.  Would not make again.

I always make buttermilk biscuits, but these are far better! This is going to be my new go-to biscuit recipe. They were light and moist, with a lovely crust. Everyone agreed they were the best biscuits I've ever made! I highly recommend serving them right out of the oven.

I made these biscuits for my New Years dinner and they had a great taste. This would be a five star,except that I think the baking temperature is too high and my biscuits came out too brown and crunchy after just 10 minutes. Next time I'll decrease the oven temp to 375 and see if that would make a better difference.

I had read another recipe using lemon but couldn't find again so I used this one and used lemon juice to make the "buttermilk" --3 lemons juice and zest.  Plus 2 tsp finely minced fresh rosemary.  The aroma, the taste...other worldly!!!

I love this recipe. I had no problems rolling out the dough or getting the biscuits to rise, but I did follow another reviewer's advice and turn my oven to 200 degrees to give the biscuits a warm place to rise. I also followed another reviewer's tip to substitute half of the 3/4 C of cisco for butter. And I loved it so much I am now wondering if anyone has had success freezing the dough? And if so, is that before or after the 1 hr yeast rising?

Perfection.  These are incredibly tasty.  I make them every Sunday and put the leftovers in the refrigerator for my son.  He eats them for breakfast and after school snacks.

Great recipe... Makes a ton of biscuits, ~40.  Our second batch came out better, we think allowing the prep'd dough to rest ~ 10 min before rolling out and cutting the biscuits... Also, use flour liberally during prep.  Last, keep the biscuits separated by 1/8" allowing them to grow and be more rounded vs square.

Well, I must agree with another rater, these biscuits didn't rise. Tried putting them in a warm oven but it didn't really help.  However,they were tasty.

This was my first biscuit making adventure, and it got quite messy! But it was, I'm happy to say, a success. I made it to go along with gravy, that my poor boyfriend has been waiting a year for me to make, because biscuits and gravy are his favorite breakfast. I had to compete with his grandma's! I'm very happy to say that not only was he thrilled to finally get his breakfast of choice, but that he said they were just like his grandmas and he thought I was an angel after making these, so this recipe really earned its name! :-) However, I've since found a drop bisuit recipe that is MUCH easier and just as heavenly!!

These were good, but a little odd. They tasted more biscuit than roll, but with a consistency of rolls that had rose-then fell. VERY easy to make, came out just like the picture. Okay with butter and honey, but I don't think I'll make them again.

These were okay, I added a little more sugar than the recipe called for because I wanted them a little sweeter.  They were easy to make and turned out nice, it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for.

I don't know what I did wrong, but I believe I went exactly by the recipe.  My biscuits were too "crumbly"; it was difficult to pick them up without their breaking apart.  The taste was good; however, I will make again and use butter instead of shortening.

Absolutely perfect foundation biscuit. If you want to make it a cheesy garlic biscuit, add garlic powder and finely shredded cheddar. This is also excellent for the freezer--just wrap well in foil...it should keep for up to a month just fine.

After reading all these reviews, I guess you will either love these or not care. Unfortunately, I fell into the latter. The  ratio of wet to dry made a very wet batter that I could not knead nor roll out. I ended up making drop biscuits as I was out of flour after the five cups called for in the recipe. On the plus side, these made a lot. On the negative, mine never rose, they burned on the bottom and were somewhat undercooked in the middle.

Nice recipe.  These were easier to make than I thought they would be and my family enjoyed them.  The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the overall flavor wasn't great.  Next time I will try butter flavor crisco instead of plain shortening and that should improve the taste.

Easy to make, but not exactly the tender, light angel biscuit my mom used to make.    They did not rise, nor did they brown on the top. The flavor was lacking something.    I will probably keep looking for another angel biscuit recipe.

My husband thought these were the best biscuits he has ever tasted! Very easy to make. I love to bake, so these were absolutely simple for me! Thank you for sharing!

These did not rise for me much at all.  They were pretty good, a very heavy biscuit.  I used them for biscuits and gravy and my husband loved them.

Not too bad, but they didn't rise much (and I even warmed up the buttermilk a little bit so as not to shock the yeast)...I may go back to quicker biscuit recipes that just use lots of baking powder.
