WOW, from the first time I tried this have gotten rave reviews from Family and Friends. Was so impressed after making first time, shared it with everyone I know! Have improvised with it a little at times, adding a little more Cabbage, as we love Cabbage, little more Salsa and garlic, also increased Celery to 3 or 4 stalks at times. Some recipes aren't open to improvising, but feel free with this one to add extra or something new of what your Family likes. Very "user friendly" recipe or great just like it is!

I cooked mine in the crock pot while I was at work, so it cooked for 9 hours which was a little too long, my cabbage basically disappeared.  We still enjoyed it but next time will make when it won't have to cook as long.

It's in my recipe box!  I only keep the ones I know I will fix again.  What a great warmer upper on these cool Chicago evenings.  Help me with one thing tho.  What is the closest bean to "ranch style"? I've looked everywhere but no luck in my area.  What would you suggest I substitute?

We love this recipe.  Have made it numerous times since finding it last year. It always turns out well even with substitutions. Great way to use up cabbage. I like this recipe so much better than a regular beef soup as it has a lot of flavor. We've also substituted sausage for the beef and that was great too.

I have made this several times, and it has become one of our family favorites! Thank you for the great recipe. The only change I make is that I use a can of Rotel instead of picante - we like the taste of Rotel better.  Everyone in my family, from my baby all the way up to my father, requests this dish.  And so easy if you throw it all into the crockpot in the morning.

Ranch-style is a brand of pinto bean.  It has a spicy and thick sauce.  I don't know a good sub. for it but hope that helps.

Sooooo good!  Cabbage came out sweet!  I did it on the stovetop because I don't have a crockpot, used diced tomatoes with chilis and mixed it with rice.  Was very spicy.

I made this for my husband and he loved it.  He said when I first told him what was in this stew he didn't think it sounded to good.  He later told me he sure was glad he didn't go with his inital thoughts of this stew.  He loved it and has already put in as request for it again this weekend.

I added a can of cream style corn and a beef bouillon cube for flavoring as this came out fairly bland.  On the whole, it was well-liked.  Prepared the chopped vegetables the evening before.

My mom used to make this growing up, but with leftover chili.  It was chili one night and cabbage patch stew the next...but we started just making the stew because we liked it BETTER than chili!

If you don't crock this recipe, the preparation and cooking time is about 40 minutes. I substituted soy-based Italian sausage for the ground beef. I also substituted about 8 ounces of mushrooms for the celery and a can of vegetarian broth for the water and stewed tomatoes liquid. I used about 5 fresh round tomatoes rather than stewed. The recipe came out quite well. My changes made this recipe into a vegetarian version. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I even managed to find ranch-style beans in Iowa--they were hiding at Wal-Mart all along.  I also used a bag of angel hair cabbage in lieu of buying a head of cabbage and chopping it myself.  Same price, less work.  =)

This stew only ended up being good after alot of doctoring, which made it awesome, but by itself it was too blan. It needs way more seasoning. I put in alot more cumin, added lawry's seasoning salt, salt and pepper, and for a little heat I added cayenne and red pepper flakes. My sister in law said " I could eat this every day". I did all the seasonings to taste and did not measure andy of them.
I made this a second time and added chili powder, paprika and a bay leaf and 2 beef boullion cubes and used 1/4 cup of jacks special garden fresh gourmet salsa. I also added 3 cans of corn and 2 cans of green beans and a whole chopped tomato. Oh yeah and a little extra onion powder. It was AWESOME!

This was a lovely stew/soup...or as Rachal Ray would call it, a Stoup.  The only changes I made were to substitute beef broth for the water (I added about 2 cups because it was a bit light on liquid) then added about 1 1/2 tsp. chili powder and about 1 Tblsp. of chopped, pickled jalapenos, just to give it a big 'bam'.  I also had one 6 inch chorizo sausage leftover from breakfast that I added...chopped it into small pieces similar to the ground beef.   I had the Ranch Style beans on hand (visited Texas this winter) which have a strong chili flavor in the sauce...(love those beans!) and they really added to the overall flavor of the Stoup.   This was really what I would call a vegetable chili with gr. beef.  My husband was skeptical until he walked into the kitchen and the aromas overcame him...he gave it a 2 thumbs up...and he's pretty picky when it comes to new recipes.  Will make this again when I have cabbage that I have to use.

My family just loves this stew. Instead of Picante sauce, I use Rotell tomatoes & chile's in the original flavor and a can of diced tomatoes, and I use the coleslaw cabbage in a bag for quick fixing. I also add 1 can of diced green chile's.

The recipe is extremely hardy and flavorful.  I must admit at first I wasn't sure how all the ingredients would blend together, boy did they come together fantastic.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Yummy and forgiving! It's not really a cabbage stew, because of all the meat and beans, but that means it's an easy way to get veggies in without noticing! I doubled the cabbage and still didn't notice it (which I think is a good thing, cabbage is not my favorite).

Very good. It needed extra seasoning for my taste, I added 1/2 bunch of fresh cilantro and 1/2 bunch fresh parsley which I think really made the dish! I needed to add extra salt, pepper, cumin, garlic powder, and onion powder to taste. I didn't have a problem finding the Ranch Style Beans but I think chili beans would be a good replacement in this dish if you can't find Ranch Style Beans. This dish is very versatile and you could almost add any veggi or spice you have on hand. Husband loved it and recommended we add chorizo next time..will make again!

My Mom used to make this and always added a can of Hormel Chili with Beans to give it a little more substance and heat.  I added the can of chili but left out the bell pepper (I just don't care for the taste of green pepper.)   Instead of Ranch Beans (couldn't find them in local grocery store) I used  canned seasoned chili beans and instead of picante I used my favorite medium salsa.  That's what's great about this recipe. Anything goes!  Like Mom I serve this over a square of cornbread but I also top it off with a dollop of sour cream!  Yum!

Good, I have no idea what "ranch style" beans are as they do not sell them here as far as I know but the internet equated them to pinto beans so that is what I used. (in tomato sauce).  Good way to utilize veggies and not too spicy, will definitely make again.

We don't eat meat, so I substitute soy crumble or tofu in this recipe.  I also add tomato sauce.  This recipe is great because you can add additional veggies if you like and the end result is wonderful.  It also freezes well.  If the slow cooker time is just too long, this recipes can easily be made in a soup pot on the stove in about an hour.

I really improvised with this recipe.  I don't have a crock pot, so I did it on the stove. It  cooked in about 30 min.  I added some red pepper for color and when I served it I put cheese on top  for the kids.  They love anything  with cheese.  It was  really  good!!  I will be making this  recipe  again.

Great recipe which I use as a base.  I make it using 2 lbs fried sausage, 2 cans black beans, 1 head of cabbage, 2 green peppers, 1 large red onion, 2 cans stewed tomatoes, 1 jar of medium picante, and I add the cumin, garlic, salt and pepper as required.  I omit the celery.  I put all this in the crockpot for 6 hours on low.  My crockpot will go to warm after the required time.  This is a very hearty stew.  Perfect for a cold day.  Serve with bread or corn chips on top.  This is a family favorite at our house.

The first time I made this, it was without meat, my husband actually liked it and requested it again but with me. So I've made this recipe about 5 times now and my husband loves it.  My changes: No water, 2 cans of tomatoes with liquid (one diced), I soak my own red beans instead of ranch style (it doesnt make a difference), and I use ground turkey for a leaner meal.

This is one of my family's favorites.  Even my kids don't notice the cabbage, because it's well cooked within the stew.  Flavor is great.  I make this a lot in the fall.

I'm giving this one 5 stars.  Hubby and I really liked it a lot.  I did use diced tomatoes w/chilies because that's what I had.  It was nicely spicy and really great for lunch the following day.  I think next time I might put a little more cabbage in it though.  Excellent and sure to be a favorite again and again.

Pretty good.  It felt like it was missing something, though.  I would still make it again.  It may be one of those soups that tastes better after it sits a while.  I used a bag of cole slaw cabbage mix and it worked well.

Almost 5 stars, but it lacks flavor.  It needs some more spice, maybe onion or garlic powder.  I did use a bold and spicy baked bean and it worked perfect.  This is a GREAT way to use up some cabbage.

I made this on the stove top because I broke my crockpot.  This soup has a great taste and is very filling.  I will try it in a crockpot next time.

This is a good soup recipe.  I cooked it on the stove top since I didn't get time to put it in the crockpot earlier in the day.  I added quite a bit more cumin to give it more flavor (and we love cumin!), but other than that followed the recipe as written.  Will try in the crockpot next time!

I let this go 8 hours, a little to long....
It was very low on liquid so I added 2 cups of water and a cube of beef base, it was very good.

This was really good.  I left out the celery and picante sauce (served it with hot sauce).  It only takes six hours on low.  Yum!

This was delicious!!  I made one addition.  I threw in some small diced potatoes.  I also used a Texas style Medium salsa.  This added a little spice.  We loved it.  And it was even better the next day as left overs.

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly. Next time, I will add more cabbage because it kind of gets lost in the mix. I don't think it would hurt to add more. This is also a great soup to freeze!

LOVED IT!! My husband, who can  be stingy with compliments raved about it. So much that some of his co-workers have paid me to make it for them a couple of times. I did make a couple of changes...not much. I did use Rotel instead of Picante, as per other reviews and I used stew meat once and also meaty beef neck bones another time to make this a crock pot recipe. A dash or so more cumin, per our liking, and it is a fantastic easy meal. Thanks.

I loved this recipe!  What a great way to use up the cabbage.  My mom and son loved it, too.  I am going to try making it with ground venison, too.  I'll let you know how it comes out.

Came out great!  Yum with ground venison!
Also, I cooked some brown rice and mixed it with some of the cabbage patch stew and stuffed some peppers with it!

Wonderful!  This was so easy and the whole family enjoyed it--even my picky toddler!  I made according to recipe except I used light red kidney beans instead of the ranch-style beans and served it over rice!  So good!  Can't wait to make it again!

I love this recipe and have made it many times now!  I used black beans instead of ranch and added a 1/2 lb of spicy ground pork with my ground beef; simmered the onion and celery into my meat.  Substited carrot for the bell pepper.  IMO You really don't need to simmer this all day!...  I simmer about an hour until veggies are done. Taste even better the next day!

OMG I can't believe I found this recipe here! This was a favorite that my grandmother used to make for us whenever we came to visit. She always topped it off with Bisquick dumplings when she made it, which was our favorite part for sopping up the sauce. I can't wait to make this for my son one day soon.

I liked this a lot. It was my first Allrecipe recipe and I liked it so much I kept searching for more recipes. :)  I'll definitely make it again, probably adding more cabbage to thicken it up a bit. It's yummy with cornbread muffins!

Sorry, but I tried this recipe exactly as written, with all the ingredients and no changes.  Horribly disappointed... was craving a nice hearty cabbage dish, but this was totally and completely bland and flavorless.  Took a ton of doctoring up to make it edible. I found a recipe for cabbage rolls which gave me the necessary ingredients to help bring this up to something I could salvage.  Don't recommend as written, and I hate giving one-star reviews.

Great recipe!  Perfect to throw in the slow cooker and come home to a cooked meal.  Beans were a little different in this recipe, but they add more protein.  Not sure I'll include them next time.  I cooked it on high for 3 1/2 hours and it was delicious!

Fantastic!  To reduce calories I use 99% lean ground turkey.  For extra flavor, I use Rotel tomatoes (which means I can skip the pepper and onion) vs. stewed, double the cumin and picante sauce, substitute fat free broth for water and add a can of chopped green chilies.

Made this today for dinner and it was D-lish!  Used ground buffalo instead of beef (much leaner), fresh tomatoes instead of stewed (on-hand). and canned black beans (on-hand).  A good hearty winter stew ...

Fantastic! I have made this for years - and it is wonderful.  You can use any meat you like - I've made it with shredded chicken, sausage even pork ribs.  I've changed the beans to whatever I've had on hand - used different salsas from mild to "set fire". I've even added cauliflower - and it was wonderful! this is one of the most delicious stews ever... thanks for writing it out Caleighsmom! :)

I made some revisions to this dish, but it was really good.  I used ground turkey and a can of rotel tomatoes instead of the picante sauce called for in the recipe.  I also used more like a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and i also added a couple of chicken broth bouillon cubes and I have to tell you - this was an incredibly delicious, low fat meal.  I had no complaints!  If you're a weight watchers person, this works out to about 1 point per ladle full.  Delicious!

This was great...I made it exact except for adding a large can of crushed tomotoes and a lot more cabbage because I love it.  I made it on the stove top and let it simmer away.  Good healthy soup.

I make this with vegetarian crumbles instead of ground beef, and I love it.  One of our new staples for dinner.

I made this today.  I used diced tomatoes rather than stewed for dietary reasons and added two cans instead of one.  I also added a can of black beans and some roasted canned chiles.  I used Salsa instead of Picante Sauce since all I found when I googled Picante sauce was salsa so I am guessing that they are the same thing?  Anyhow, I used 3/4 of a cup instead of 1/4.  I was also careful to use a high quality brand of salsa and the hot version.  I am more of a medium person myself but the hot gave a nice medium kick to the stew when it was mixed with the other ingredients.  I also added 1 1/2 tablespoons of fresh cilantro at the end.  It came out very flavorful and delicious.  I will definitely be making it again.

I did make a few slight changes....no stewed tomatoes, just used crushed, no picante, just shook in a litte chili powder.  I also didn't have ranch style beans, just used pink beans.  I do like it quite a bit.  Good comfort food, and easy to make.  Thanks for the post Betsy!

This is one of our all time favorite soup recipes. If you don't care for cabbage you probably won't care for this soup though. It does have a pretty strong cabbage taste. It does freeze well also.

Very Good, and my husband thought so too!  I added extra picante sauce, and then about an hour before it was done, stirred in one can of regular corn and served over brown rice.  I used the extra cabbage to make cole slaw.  I found that with the hotter cooking temperatures of the newer crockpots, 5 hours on "Low" was more than sufficient cooking time.

My husband loves this stew.  I made it for the first time tonight and   I like it but wasn't sure I'd make it again until he gave it rave reviews. I did this on high in the slow cooker for about 90 minutes. I tasted it several times as it was cooking and added another 1/4 cup of hot picante sauce and a beef bouillon cube.  Instead of water I used some chicken stock because it was already opened in the frig. Still, I wanted a bit more zip to it.

I like to make a bisquick dumpling with cheese to cook on top for the last 20 minutes.  (how my Mom made it when I was growing up) 10 minutes covered after dropping dumplings and 10 minutes with out cover.  Wonderful.

This is good, made as directed with a heavy hand measuring the picante as well as cumin. Tasted like Mexican cabbage soup, which was good, just not anything we went too crazy for.  Good way to use cabbage up, simple ingredients, would make again for the above mentioned reasons but not likely something we will have a craving for.

Cabbage Patch Stew Haiku: "Wow, this was awesome! This recipe surprised me. Easy and tasty!" Followed the recipe exactly as written, although my stewed tomatoes turned out to be a "Mexican-seasoned" type, which probably added an additional flavor bump. Ranch style beans are a must as well. i thought the cabbage would disappear to mush after being the crockpot that long, but it was great, and frankly, we thought it a yummy, healthy alternative to having pasta in a soup/stew. Looking forward to making this again!

Awesome stew.  I LOVE cabbage.  I used a whole head of cabbage and also tossed in a few russet potatoes and a can of beef broth and it turned out AMAZING!  Very hearty and delicious.

After finishing the first batch off I went out and bought ingredients for the next batch which I am currently cooking!  YUM!

Yum.  My boyfriend eats a lot, so I tripled the recipe.  I added more cabbage, more picante sauce, and a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce.  Since I couldn't fit all ingredients in my 6-quart crockpot, I simmered on the stove for a few hours and it was cooked through by then.  I'm not sure if you can freeze this kind of soup or not...I think the cabbage might disintegrate.  We'll probably eat it all up soon anyway.  Thanks for recipe.

The only two things I changed were instead of 1 cup of water I used 2 cups of chicken broth ff, as I do with all soup/stews I make that call for water.  Also, for some reason there were no green bell peppers at the store, so that was omitted.  I also added extra cabbage and celery.  The whole family really loved this stew!

I didn't think I would like this inittially, but I needed to use up some of my cabbage. So very very glad that I did.  I didn't have any ranch style beans or cumin, so i substituted it with pinto beans and about 1Tbsp of taco seasoning. Still came out delicious.

I was fully  expecting my family to not like this (I wasn't even sure I would after smelling the cabbage throughout my house as it cooked) but much to my surprise, the stew was enjoyed by all but our youngest who I think was just in a cranky mood. I made mine with medium chunky salsa, kidney beans and without celery since I didn't have any on hand. My husband asked for seconds for maybe only the second time since I've started cooking in earnest. I will definitely be making this again and again. Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

YUM!  Used meatloaf mix as that was on hand and replaced the water with beef broth followed the rest of the ingredients on the recipe.  I served it with Yukon Gold Mashed and it was awesome.  Real comfort food.  I browned the meat and onions, added the rest of the ingredients and cooked it in a tight lidded cast iron dutch oven for about 4 hours at 325 degrees.  Flavors were melded well and the cabbage was very wilted but still flavorful.  This would work for any family night dinner.  COMFORT FOOD at it's best.

This was excellent stew/soup (we like more broth so I added more liquid).  I started off with a big batch of leftover Pork Chalupa (recipe from this site) so that was my meat/bean base, then I added all the other veggies/seasonings. called for in this recipe.  I didn't have time to slow cook it so I did it on the stove and it was very good!  Thanks for a very good way of using up a leftover!

Excellent!  I used left over, cut up beef roast and left over taco seasoned hamburger.  Also added some chopped carrots and substituted 2 cans beef broth instead of water.  I also added a McCormick beef stew flavor packet and a couple healthy shakes chili powder.  I gave 4 stars because I made changes and substitutions.  Thanks for sharing!

For not liking Cabbage a whole lot, this is a very tasty dish. It just kept getting better day by day. I made this in my crock pot and let it cook on low for 9 or 10 hours before eating. Very good.

I thought this was a great idea to use cabbage so that it wouldn't be as noticed by the kids. Came out very much like a chili with cabbage in it, but my chili kid ate it up. Overall, I found the flavors to be a little bland. I would definitely make this again, but would add some chili powder and more cumin next time.

I didn't have ranch style beans, green pepper or celery, so I used white kidney beans and yellow pepper. The only thing is that it was quite spicy, I'm not sure if the picante I used was different but a 1/4 seems like a lot. I still liked it but my dad couldn't eat it.

I always add more cabbage and also use Bush's chili beans (with sauce) instead of the Ranch-Style beans.  They add more of the flavors I like.  Other times, when I feel like wanting it spicier, I use Bush's Cocina Latina  Pintos a la Diabla (30 oz can with sauce).  This recipe can be adjusted to mild or spicy depending on your taste.  Sometimes will also add a drained can of shoe peg corn.

This was a good recipe. I replaced the ranch style beans with 1 15oz can of blk beans and 1 15oz can of pinto beans.  I used mexican style stewed tomatoes & added 1 T of chili powder. My husband and his friends loved it. I placed it in the crockpot and forgot about it.

Definitely not the most attractive looking dish but very easy to make, and good for a rainy Autumn day. I added quite a bit more cumin and also some chili powder. It looked a little bit watery towards the end of the cooking time, so I just took the lid off for the last hour, and it turned out fine. Thanks, Betsy!

I make this dish quite often, however I use light & dark kidney beans instead and I add sliced carrots, use diced tomatoes, beef bouillon cubes and add little "stars" noodles in mine. My kids seems to like the little noodles in it, so they don't mind eating all the vegtables since they are thinking about the cute lil noodles! I also add vegtable juice. Plus just half the green pepper, so it doesn't overpower the stew.

Before I altered this recipe, it was bland, and tasteless.  I added jalapenos, another can of beans, more picante, and lots of different spices to make this have any flavor to it.  In the end with sharp cheddar on top it was good.  I won't be making this again, even when tweaked, it wasn't an outstanding favorite.  If you like food that is very mild, bland, and unflavorful this would be a good choice.  I don't mean that in a bad way, people have different tastes.

This was very bland but the green pepper was overwhelming.  Next time I would put in 2 Tablespoons Green pepper if at all.  I ended up adding another can of beans, more picante sauce and a can of corn.  
Served  it over brown rice and sprinkled on shredded cheese.  Of course this made way too much for the two of us so we'll have it for dinner another night this week.

I've made this recipe a few times without the beans to lower the carb count since two members of my family are doing the Atkins diet.  I've added other vegetables such as mushrooms to take the place of beans but without the high carbs.  Both love this dish and I cook it 3 to 4 times a month.  Very economical too.

This was edible. However, we all found the cabbage a little crispy and the cabbage flavor overwhelmed the flavor of the stew.

Very good!  A pleasant change.  Was a bit disappointed, as I love Cabbage, and I couldn’t really taste it in the stew.  After serving, we topped it off with some shredded cheddar cheese.  Was really satisfying, and a good belly warmer on cold days.

A "decent" dinner. It was SOOO thick that I ended up adding 1 can of tomato sauce - which worked much better and brought this dish from being practically a casserole in my crockpot to a stew/chili consistency. I was expecting some spice and pizzaz but found it lacking. We liked it but I have found some other similar recipes that I prefer over this. Thanks anyways!

Smelled so good I barely made it through the cooking time. I cheated and had a bowl half-way through when the cabbage and bell pepper was still crunchy. =) Mmm serve it with bread.

This is a hearty "stick to your ribs" dish.
I use salsa instead of picante sauce, and vary the type of salsa to the taste of the people eating it.  I also recommend Ancho Chiles instead of green bell pepper if you like it spicy.

I think it's a very good recipe and it's open to alterations to suit your own tastes, i.e., using beef bouillon in place of the water.   I used regular chili beans (in a sauce) because I couldn't find the special ones listed.   Perhaps the ranch-style added a different flavor.    I used ground venison, by the way.   I will definitely make this again.

Wow. This was great tasting soup and the cabbage added just the right amount of texture to be a satisfying meal. I added the cabbage ~2 hours before serving to avoid overcooking  it.  13.8 cal/ oz (wt) or 131.4 cal/cup (see end). Didn't have ranch style beans (Southwestern seasoned) so since I was making a double batch I used one can of pinto beans and one can of Tex-Mex red beans. I used 2 # of 93/7 ground beef which yielded 21.9 oz cooked and drained. 

FYI:  I weighed each ingredient to calculate calories and then divided the total by the actual weight and also by the measured volume of the final soup prior to serving. My double batch had 2103 calories, weighed 152.1 oz (8 lbs, 14.1 oz) and yielded 4.0 quarts. After 3 adults and a child ate, I had 1.5 quarts left to freeze.

This is one of my favorite recipes,  but I make a couple of adjustments which, in my opinion, take the dish from good to great. First, I use beef broth in lieu of water. Second, I add a good 1/4 cup or more of Worcestershire sauce. That's an approximation since I never really measure and always make a huge batch. It gives great added flavor. Lastly,  I go heavy on the meat.

this was just ok.  the taste of the cabbage seemed to be lost by the Mexican flair of the ranch beans.  There is quite a bit of cumin in the ranch style beans, so I didn't add the dried cumin to the recipe.  Kept everything else the same.

Easy to make in the crock pot and it makes a lot. I only used half a cabbage. Not the strongest flavor but it was warm and savory so it did the trick for me. Its a very cozy and mellow dish great if you are not feeling up to spicy. It is also a very freezer friendly dish so if you are a college student like me you can separate it into little Tupperware servings and take it out for an easy meal. This fed me for a long time and I didn't get tiered of it. It's nothing flashy but if your looking for a good hardy meal this will do the trick.

We make this all year long and it makes a great freezer meal too. I like to use half Italian sausage and half ground beef for some added flavor.

Yum! Had for dinner over mashed potatoes, everyone enjoyed.  Used more cabbage and picante sauce.  Was not sure what ranch style beans were, used vegetarian baked beans.  Wanted to use kidney beans but didn't have any.  Will make this again.  Thanks

Excellent!  I followed the recipe except I didn't add the Picante for my spice-sensitive 5-year old who loved the stew!   It's delicious but I will definitely add more cabbage next time.  Thank you!

The only thing I did different was thicken it up in the end (too soupy). Me and my husband really liked the flaver; it tastes like chili, except better. Next time I will add less meat and more cabbage. I will be making this again.

Great recipie. Yet what I did was instead of ground beef I used Italian sausage. I didn't use beans because I didn't have any, nor picant sauce since the sausage was spicy.

Didn't have enough time for the crock pot method so I made this on the stove and tripled the water to make up for it. I ended up tripling the cumin also. I browned the meat and veggies (reserving the cabbage) first, then added the liquids and brought to a boil, reduced to low and simmered 30 mins, added the cabbage and simmered another 20 mins or so. I think this would have been better with some additional spices. Great w/homemade cheddar and onion bread.

Great way to use cabbage! I just used half of a head and eliminated the celery. Very tasty and easy to make.

Good enough to eat again if all the ingredients are handy but not something I will plan to make.  Needs tomato sauce or soup next time. Served with white rice and dinner rolls.

I thought it might be bland with no broth, so I added some beef broth in place of the water, and left out the cumin and the beans. Added a pinch of marjoram and also added some rice to it. It turned out okay.

I thought this was pretty good!  I cooked a couple of tablespoons of minced garlic with the beef and onion and then seasoned the meat with Creole Seasoning.  I left out the celery and green pepper (because I don't like them) and added a can of corn.  I also doubled the cabbage and it definitely looks like I'll get more than four servings.

I made this stew last night and it was just ok.  There was nothing particularly good or bad about it.  We had to heavily salt it to eat it though because it did seem quite bland.  It smelled great, so we assumed it would be really flavorful, but it wasn't.  I would make again if I had all ingredients on hand, but nothing I'd rush out to buy up so we could have again.  Thanks anyway.

very good - a cross between chili, stew and soup!  i used the diced tomato with jalapeno and used a few more spices -  other than that, followed this to the "t" -- will definitely make again! A perfect cold weather supper.

Very good dish - Easy and tasty.  I used 2 cans of the Ranch beans with jalapenos, and followed the recipe exactly.  We ate this "chili" with grated cheese and flour tortillas.  Adding it to my regulars-Thanks Betsy!

Very good and very easy to make. Tastes just like chili! The kids loved it and didn't even notice the cabbage.

This was ok!  I cooked it on the stove for a few hours instead of the crock pot.  Husband didn't like it too much either.  This is way too much food for 2 people.  We'll never eat all the leftovers!

This looked like an interesting combination of flavours. Boy, were we disappointed! It tastes like a mix of leftovers.. nothing interesting about it. Won't ever make this again
