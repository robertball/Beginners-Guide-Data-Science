Well, I wish I still knew a moose hunter that would give me some as it's illegal to sell up here, I substituted farmed but clean bison meat, no anti-biotics or corn finishing, all grass fed. The recipe turned out great as is, even with the cocoa mole twist which I wasn't too sure about.

I'm sure one can also use other game meat in here like venison and keep the nutritional profile basically the same.

Thanks, I'll keep this one in my recipe box.

Great recipe-very tasty. If you are having a hard time finding moose, as some have stated, use any lean burger. Moose, venison and buffalo have a wonderful flavour but plain lean beef would work too.  I used cottage cheese because I had no ricotta, will make again -thanks

I used an “Alaskan” moose.  Hope that’s o.k.!  Great recipe.   I especially liked the addition of the spinach & mushrooms and may just incorporate that into my regular lasagna recipe.  I left out the cocoa and brown sugar.  It just sounded like an odd combination of flavors and I’ve never had a problem with moose tasting gamey.  If I ever run into a strong game meat, I will try that little trick and see if it reduces the gaminess.

Moose, deer, raccoon, bear.  It's all good! This sounds really good, but hard to find in L.A.!  Has anyone tried this with Bison? Going to the Farmers Market this weekend (rain pending) and would like to know.  And to be a COMPLETE bore, how about the dreaded hamburger?

I used some tasty moose from Sceena and I have to say this was fantastic. I made it exactly as the  recipe called for and it was really really good. I used this recipe to try to get my wife into moose and she loved it too. Well done!!

We love this recipe, as we always have a supply of moose! If you have moose sausage as well, and you like your lasagna meaty, it makes a nice flavourful addition... Honey garlic and Hot Italian are both really good!
