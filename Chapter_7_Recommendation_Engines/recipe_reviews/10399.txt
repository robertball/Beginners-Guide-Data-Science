My husband grew up eating "Jumbo cookies" and asked me to make them for him.  He loved this recipe.  The butter cream frosting was really good on the cookies.  The dough seemed very thin and runny, so I added extra flour to some of them.  However, the cookies that didn't have the extra flour were better.

I was so thrilled to find this recipe. My grandmother used to make this moist, slightly spicey cookies and we all loved them! And this is darn close to hers! Thanks so much!

This is an unusual cookie. I followed the recipe as written. The batter is the consistency of brownie batter. The cookies bake up very soft, cakelike, not normal cookie texture. I think they need more salt as well. The people I served these to either loved it or didn't care for them, split about 50-50 so I'm giving it 3 stars.

It was really good, but the only problem was that it wasn't really all that moist.

A soft cookie and although I prefer a firmer texture the flavor is top rate.  I did not bother with the frosting and walnut.

AMAZING! They disappeared so fast. Just used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon ginger instead of spices I didn't have. For frosting/glaze: whip 3 tablespoons milk and 1 cup confectioners sugar with 1 teaspoon orange juice. Add confectioners sugar until thick and drips from spoon. Then spoon over cookies. YUM.

The one cup of molasses completely overwhelms the cocoa, so if you are expecting a chocolate cookie, you may want to look for another recipe.  I knew this but I wanted to try this recipe because I love the flavor of molasses, therefore most spice cookies and cakes.  This recipe just misses the mark however.  My daughter liked it, but my husband and I were disappointed.   We just felt the addition of cocoa just gave it an odd flavor.
