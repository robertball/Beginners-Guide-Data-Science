I used shallots rather than onions and loved them caramelized. As recommended by another reviewer, I used apple cider vinegar rather than the red wine vinegar and preferred that exchange. The small amount of sugar and vinegar was not enough to produce the sweet-sour tang I sort of expected and I was glad it didn't.  It was, however, enough to contribute great flavor.  As for the bacon, it's hard to go wrong adding it to just about anything.

This dish is wonderful Frank and certainly no secret as it's a very typical side that German and Austrian families have been making for years. So glad you discovered it tho because it really is amazing. I went for the big guns and used a whole pound of bacon and apple cider vinegar instead of the red. Family "yummed" their way all thru dinner and told me that it tasted just like my German potato salad except with green beans! Thank so much Frank!

This is a delightful twist to boring ole' green beans. I used turkey bacon and sliced sweet Maui onions and actually love these carmelized! Another reviewer, Linda Mclean, suggested apple cider vinegar in place of red wine vinegar and so I used that instead. Loved the subtle sweet-n-sour tang, and it's not overpowering, which is good for all of us! Everyone here loves bacon so you can't go wrong with that in this or any other dish! Thank you for sharing Frank!

Wonderful! I nailed it the second time around.  Vinegar had just a little bite and beans were perfect! Amazing complement to my grilled bacon-wrapped Elk Backstrap Filet Mignon!  

I urge people to follow the instructions, as I was too busy with my grilled salmon the first time I made this and it was not as good as last night's batch. When the bacon STARTS to brown, add the onions. I had hard, unappealing bacon the first time because I let it finish like I would for breakfast, then had all the extra cooking time on top of that. To those who have seen fit to complain about the vinegar taste, please pay attention to the name of the dish, then note the word vinegar a second time in the ingredients.  Then, don't make this dish and that should save you much heartburn about the flavor you will achieve with this side.

this was ok, but I didn't care for the extra tangy tastew with the vinegar. I would cut back on that. However, I can tell you I did cut back on the bacon grease and that might have affected it.

I just wasn't that impressed with this dish. I love the combination of ingredients and followed the recipe exactly but something was missing for me, not enough flavor. Sorry. I drained off the bacon grease, was I supposed to do that? Maybe that is why it just lacked flavor for me. I will try this again as I have had all of these ingredients in the past but for some reason this just wasn't flavorful enough for me.

Great recipe!  I've made green beans with bacon before, but the red wine vinegar adds a lot.  I steamed the green beans and skipped the parsley.

I used bacon bits and rice wine vinegar.  It was great, even better the next day.

I made this recipe twice, once with red wine vinegar and once with apple cider vinegar since many reviewers were mixed on which was better. Both were excellent.

Definitely a fan.  The beans tasted very fresh since they were just quick cooked.  Being in the south, we typically eat bacon and onion in our cooked to a pulp green beans (nearly an hour).  This was great for me and had what I would call a West Coast taste.  I gave four instead of five as I do love my overcooked green beans a little more; however, this was a great switch up and delish!  Score for me.

My family loved it, instead of cooking it I had the beans in the steamer for 3 minutes
