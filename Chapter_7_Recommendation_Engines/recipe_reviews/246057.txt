I prepared this just as instructed. It was the easiest Hollandaise I  ever prepared...and the best. Excellent recipe.

Easy and elegant recipe for a simple week night entree.  I didn't have white wine,and a family member who doesn't like any wine,I had to substitute 1/4 cup of lemon juice with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and marinaded for 1 hr. I made a quick microwave recipe on this site for the hollandaise, ( probably better then packaged anyway!). I coated the chicken with almond flour,and browned it on the skillet first,then placed in a baking dish and topped with frozen asparagus spears. I poured the hollandaise sauce on top and baked in the oven for 25 minutes at 350. Delicious!

It’s OK. It sure was quick and easy. Mine came out kind of watery. Kind of heavy on the buttery flavor side. It got me through tonight’s dinner, but I will probably not make it again.

Added a little more water to it to get it creamy and a nice light yellow color. If it seems to thicken up on you added some hot water a tablespoon at a time and whisk it up good. We will be making again.

Great flavor, very tasty - I did use 1/8 tsp dried dill as I was out of fresh! I love the addition of the dill, but the sauce was a little thinner than I like. I'll make it again, but will try it in a double boiler instead.
