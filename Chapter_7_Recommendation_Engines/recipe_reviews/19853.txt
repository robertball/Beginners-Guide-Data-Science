I used half this recipe for a 32 ounce steak and had more than enough marinade. I cooked it on my George Foreman grill for 2 and 1/2 minutes and it came out medium rare,and was tender and juicy. We enjoyed the flavor but all we could really taste was the vinegar. I think I might play around with it to tone down the vinegar taste just a bit.

I expected more flavor with all the different ingredients.  Too vinegar-y, and it didn't tenderize the meat at all (and I used good steaks!).  This recipe may be better with chicken or pork?

I decreased the balsamic vinegar (b/c I didn't have enough).  this is excellent.  It's a delicious flavor that came through nicely on chicken.  *I'd reserve some to baste on the chicken while it's grilling next time.  I actually only made half the recipe and it was plenty.

I have tried this marinade a couple of different times with different cuts and cooking variations. Always turns out great! I recently put it in a crock pot with a beef roast and found the meat was tender and the potatoes were loaded with flavor!

Next time I make this I will only use 1/2 of the vinegar.  Otherwise it gave meat a good flavor.  Would also be good with a little more spice.

made exactly as written and it might have been the beer but it was overly beer flavored. ( if that makes sense) ill make this again and decrease the beer seeing as i had some extra marinade left over so it wouldnt effect the amount. this was also good on the mushrooms that i made to go with the uber cheap steaks we had for dinner. this is a solid marinade recipe and its very simple using what i always have on hand. impressed.

When I made this, I wasn't thrilled with the taste but something about it screamed BOLOGNA! So I tossed a slice of fat free bologna in a container with the sauce (I quartered the recipe) and let it sit overnight. I grilled up the slice of bologna for lunch today and it was REALLY great. The vinegar gives it a tang, and for some reason this really pairs great with bologna. Yes, I grilled bologa!

We first thought the beer was an odd ingredient, but it must have worked because the steak was SO TENDER...never thought beer, maybe wine!  We love to grill and this is now on the summer grilling menu.  We used Jack Daniel's Regular BBQ Sauce and A-1 Steak Sauce.  The aged balsamic brought out a sweetness, too.

Pretty good. Was a tad to vinegary for my kids but I thought it had a decent flavor. I used this on chicken legs and baked them.
