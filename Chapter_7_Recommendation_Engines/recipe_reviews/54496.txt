Yummy! So simple and delicious to make. On a side note, for those who have families not into tuna, I suggest substituting cream of chicken for the mushroom soup and already baked chicken chunks for tuna.

good recipe,but i added a little twist to it that my german grandmother always used with her tuna recipes..i added all the ingrediants together but i peeled and cored one large apple(i use golden)and diced it,adding it to the casserole.apples and tuna go wonderful together,can also use in your tuna salad.

I love this recipe! My husband was very skeptical because he only likes his best friend's moms tuna casserole and he thought this was just a quick fix kind of dinner. When he tried it he was very amazed. I make it atleast once every two weeks and everytime he always raves about it. I love it my self. I get home at 6 and need to give my daughter a bath and do some laundry and the dishes and blah blah blah and this recipe is super great to fix on those busy nights (which is every night for me)! Love it, Love it, Love it!

My fiancee watched in horror as I cooked this up, thinking it would be too artificial.  He took a bite, then wolfed it all down.  Now he's the one making it all the time- he memorized the recipe instantly.  Add capers to zest it up.  mmmm

I was pleasantly surprised. I think next time I'll cut the cream of mush in half but overall it was a good recipe. My fiance' was skeptical but once he tried it he was a believer. I didn't have French fried onions (not a fan of them) so I used panko and put in the oven just instill the top started getting golden.

As another reviewer remarked, why didn't I think of this? On a college budget, I have plenty of tuna, mac n' cheese, soup, and canned veggies. I followed the recipe (including the fried onions) and - wow! Cheap, easy, and best of all, delicious!

This recipe surprised me. I wasn't expecting much out of it but made it because I had all of the ingredients in my cupboard...and it was actually really good! My husband didn't care much for it, but I thought it was fantastic and was even happier because it has less fat and calories than most tuna and noodle casserole. This is going in my recipe box

This is the perfect working Mom's dinner - it's fast, easy, not too many ingredients, and really yummy. Even my very picky four year old liked it (only had one serving, but she cleaned her plate!). I just made it all on the stove in one big pot, and added some fried onions to the top of mine and my husband's - really good. Will definitely make again :)

This is the quick and easy "comfort" casserole to prepare when time is short.  I served it a meeting of our quilt circle and it was a hit!  Used Kraft Deluxe Macaroni and Cheese.  Added canned sliced mushrooms, and chopped onion and celery, to the macaroni in the last three minutes of boiling.  After mixing in the cheese sauce, I added the mushroom soup and tuna.  Then added a little diced red bell pepper for color, some pepper and Lowry's Seasoned salt.  Topped with Italian style bread crumbs.  I think this would be good with chicken.  It's a keeper!

This recipe was great! I used frozen petite peas and added the fried onions on top in a casserole as suggested. So easy and everyone loves it!

I've made this for years - and my mother made it before me.  It's always a favorite with the family.  I have always added some dried onion flakes or some chopped fresh onion (you can add it to the pasta water to 'pre-cook' it) and some garlic powder.  I sometimes add a quarter cup of sour cream and perhaps a bit of extra shredded cheese on top. It's comfort food!

I was surprised at how good this was for such a quick and easy idea.  The only thing I changed was add (frozen) green beans instead of peas.

This was really quick and easy! My kids didn't eat it, but they won't eat anything at all, lol, so they don't count. My dh actually said he liked it, and he's super picky! We try to make things a bit healthier when we can, so I omitted the butter (when making the mac & cheese) and just mixed the cheese powder with the soup. Also, we have a mushroom allergy in our family, so we used crm. of chicken and canned chicken breast instead of crm. of mushroom and tuna. It was surprisingly good, considering how simple it is -- next time, we might try a topping on it, but it was good even without it. =)

I've been making this for over 30 years.  The recipe was on back of the box of Kraft Mac & Cheese. The instructions say to put the mixed ingredients into a greased casserole dish and bake in 350 oven until warm (30 minutes) and then top with shredded cheddar cheese and bake until cheese is melted. The added cheese makes a good dish great.

Don't steer away from this recipe because it uses convenience foods.  I tell you what, I used to make "gourmet" tuna casserole from Joy of Cooking with homemade white cheese sauce.  I thought it was special, but I think this was even BETTER.  It also took a fraction of the time and was practically free.  I also think this is probably lower in fat, since it doesn't use nearly as much milk.  I love the Joy of Cooking but have found a new recipe for this one.  Thanks!

Best go to recipe ever. Sometimes I top with just a sprinkling of bread crumbs, sometimes I don't. Either way, it's amazing.

Sooooooo Easy and yummy! I made a mistake and bought the wrong sized mac and cheese box (5.5 oz.) but I made it anyway and it turned out fantastic. I'll probably make it again that way because we really liked that it had alot of peas and the tuna was still just nice and subtle. I doubled the recipe, too, and I'm glad I did. I look forward to the left-overs. Thank you so very much!

Excellent and simple....my only  question, why do reviewers always inform us whether their (a) wife (b) husband or (c) significant other liked or disliked it. What do YOU think.  And stop rewriting a recipe. Review the one posted. If u change it, post your own.

Great basis for a quick, easy, tasty dish. First, I doubled everything except the cream of mushroom soup, since we have a large family with teenagers! Second, I added about a 1tbsp of Old Bay, 1/8-1/2 tsp of minced garlic and, salt and pepper to taste. Then, put it all in a casserole dish, top with shredded cheddar and pop it in the oven at 400 till the cheese is melted and the dish is heated through (maybe 5-10 minutes). You can top it with the French fried onions as well (we did), or not. Just as tasty either way!

This was my go-to staple in college! It's a fast, cheaper version of tuna casserole, but nothing beats the original, scratch recipe. I have an immense dislike of peas, so I used pre-steamed broccoli.

Used coconut oil instead of butter, added about 3 tbsp fennel sprigs, 1 king apple. Sprinkled 6 whole grain crackers on top and baked at 350 degrees for 40 min.

I have made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe to a T and it was good but too many peas.  The second time I reduced the amount of peas and added a can of mushrooms.  I made it as a casserole and added crushed Ritz crackers as a topping.

I was skeptical when I saw the recipe, but I knew I had to throw something together for a quick dinner yesterday.  Everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe for a family of 4 for dinner and leftovers for the next day (today).

As a working mom on a tight budget, this recipe helped stretch our food dollars for a family of 5.  Whenever possible, I would top it with cheddar cheese, not as healthy, but yummy!

It doesn't get much better than this! Super easy and super delicious. I followed the recipe exactly other than using diced fresh steamed asparagus as I had no peas. Wonderful, thanks Tresa.

I loved this. So quick and easy. I added fried onions to the top. I had to make my husband stop eating so we would have leftovers for the next night.

This is one of the recipes that reminds me of my childhood. I have never used the cream of mushroom soup for this because it doesn't really need it. Kids love it as I did when I was a kid.

When I think of a typical American home-made dish I think of a tuna casserole -don't ask me why! This one is very good(almost addicting!) and really easy, although not particularly healthy -especially with how my husband and I top it with extra cheese and jalapeno potato chips :) I also add pepper and a grating of nutmeg to taste, and sometimes fresh herbs like parsley.

This is the ONLY tuna and noodles that my kids will eat, they just love it.  I have had to use cream of celery soup and it came out just as good.  Its fast and simple, which is a requirement as a single mom with 3 hungry kids!

I've been making this exact recipe for years: it's foolproof. I do kick it up with Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes, and frozen peas vs canned, but otherwise exactly the same. It's particularly yummy with the white cheddar mac and cheese.

Wow, as others have said, easy and delicious. My husband is not a big fan of tuna casserole but he actually loved this! I made a couple of changes. Instead of adding the powdered cheese in mac n' cheese mix I shredded my own cheddar cheese. I also ran out of frozen peas (I only buy frozen or fresh) so I used frozen corn. Great recipe!

Thought I would try this b/c of the reviews, unfortunately can't get the thought of how much I disliked it out of my head. After all the ingredients were mixed, it looked like slop and had a bland taste. Added an extra can of tuna and some diced onions for flavor which made it edible. Personally, a tuna sandwhich and bowl of mushroom soup would have been more appetizing. Definitely not worth the time spent making this dish.

Skipped the butter. Added the French onion rings as recommended by others.  Used frozen peas. DH approved. Will be a regular in our repertoire.

This was wonderful... Took me no time at all to prepare. My 11yo daughter had seconds and then ate the left-overs the next day. The only thing I did differently is added Frenches baked onion strings on top. Yummy

Whoa, no way! My mom used to make this for me when I was little. I think she added a little shredded cheese to jazz it up. I hate mushrooms but you can't substitute other soups so I am stuck picking the tiny mushroom bits out of mine.

I only added a leftover chopped green onion and some cayenne pepper and topped the casserole with breadcrumbs mixed with melted butter.  This dish came out great!!  It was quick and easy - I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing!

I was skeptical of this at first, but it is DELICIOUS! I did use frozen peas since I didn't have canned, but I think it would be even better with canned. Definitely not a "healthy" meal, but between the ease, the speed, and the taste, SO worth it! I will definitely make this again! :)

My husband absolutely loved this! I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try it, but his co-workers saw it and asked for the recipe. He said he'd eat it every week. The only changes I made were using frozen peas instead of canned, and I put it in a casserole dish with bread crumbs and shredded cheese on top and put it in the oven for a few minutes. It's not the healthiest meal since a lot of the ingredients are processed, but it's great for something classic and quick.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is so fast, so easy, and tastes great.  It's also great for those trying to watch their calorie/fat intake and craving cheesy comfort food.  I ended up using 2 cans of tuna and about half a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  I also spiced it up with onion and garlic powder, black pepper and a dash or two of hot sauce.  I feel it would have been bland without it.  Transferred to casserole dish, topped with breadcrumbs and a little cheese and broiled to give a nice crunchy topping.  Still took only about half an hour from start to finish.  Love it!

this is good!  i used mixed frozen veggies instead of the peas.  makes it look nice too.  the second time i made it i was in a pinch b/c i didn't have the soup, but it is fine with the soup.  although then it's more like "mac & cheese w/tuna and veggies."  ;)  thanks for the great recipe!

My mom always mixed mac n cheese, tuna, and chopped green onions - simple, but awesome!  After eating that my whole life, I've never been a fan of "real" tuna casserole, so I didn't expect to like this as much as I did.  I used frozen peas and carrots, cream of chicken soup, and topped each serving with French Fried Onions (a must!).  I think I'll probably make my mom's simpler version most of the time, but I'll break this out when I'm in the mood for something different, like I was tonight.

This is really very good!  Especially for working moms or anyone who needs a quick and easy meal.  I used cream of chicken soup because my picky eaters don't do mushrooms, and they gobbled it up.  It's one of those "why didn't I think of that?" recipes!

I gave it my own spin and added 1 1/2 cups french fried onions and instead of the mushroom soup I made it with 1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup (both ingredients from another recipe) and "WOW" it was DELICIOSO!

This is cheap, fast, easy and quite good.  It also doesn't make a gigantic amount like typical casseroles do- making it a good alternative since I cook for only myself. I add garlic and onion powders, and sprinkle shredded cheddar and crushed Ritz crackers on top.

I loved this quick and healthy recipe. Followed it to the tee, only thing I added was breadcrumbs and broiled it for 15mins. Made the top crunchy and inside melted and hot!

My finance and I enjoyed this meal! I made it exactly as it says only I doubled the recipe! I didn't have any french onions which would have given it a better texture. I am positive that we'll be eating this casserole again in the near future!! Thanks for posting this meal!

Very good quick and easy tuna casserole.  The only thing I changed was using frozen peas instead of canned.  We thought it was very tasty and will make again.

I needed a change from Clean Eating, and this was a good bet.  I used a 6 ounce box of Annie's Mac & Cheese, a can of Campbell's Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom Soup, two cans of Wild Planet Pole Caught, light tuna-drained, and a 10 oz bag of frozen peas.  Canned peas are just nasty and discolored.  

I cooked the pasta according to directions,setting the timer to 10 minutes. With 7 minutes remaining, I tossed in the peas and with 4 minutes remaining, I turned off the heat, covered the pot and moved it from the burner to finish cooking.  Then I drained the pasta / peas and finished the cheese sauce according to the package.  Added back the pasta & peas, stirred and then forked the tuna apart and stirred it in.  Then finally, I added in the cream of mushroom soup and Viola!  

Four servings at 334 cal. 45 grams carbs, 4.4 grams fat, 25 grams protein and 5.1 grams of calcium.  And bit healthier than using the alternative lower cost items.

This was really quick and easy.  I added some vegetables to the mix (mushrooms, spinach and red sweet peppers) to make it a bit more healthy.... Sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on the top and let it broil for 8 mins!  Definitely will make again. ??

When I told my boyfriend what I was making for dinner, he was pretty much convinced he wasn't going to like it. When he tasted it, however, he went back for seconds! It was so creamy and tasty! This is a great cheap meal for two broke college students like us ^_^ Thanks!

I do like peas, but a whole can was really too much so I'll use less next time. My husband isn't a pea fan, but he really liked this casserole. The best part is that it's so easy and uses few ingredients, but it's obviously a quick family meal and not something to serve to company.

So easy and so delicious!  The first time I made it my boyfriend was BEGGING for more!  The second time I added more tuna (2 cans) to give it a little protein and it was still delicious and cheesy.  I will definitely be making this again!

i enjoyed this recipe because it used things i already had in the cupboard.  it is quite bland though, i found that adding lots of black pepper and parmesan cheese helps. as well as putting it in the oven on broil for a bit to brown the top.

Affordable, easy, and good exactly as written! CERTAINLY tastier than the effort it requires! IF you have it on hand, I like adding a 4 oz can of mushrooms, a bit of fresh chopped or dried minced onion, and using frozen peas instead of canned, but that's just personal preference. Also, you can substitute browned ground beef (1/2 lb is fine) instead of tuna if you like!

This is a great concept...but I thought the original recipe we bland. I added a cup of bread crumbs and extra cheese (1 1/2 cups shreaded cheddar jack) and that gave it an awesome taste.

Very good recipe!  I had to "tweak" it somewhat out of necessity.  I didn't have a 9 oz. can of tuna on hand, so I used 2- 5oz. can of Bumblebee sensations tuna.  I also used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup.  A very economical and hearty comfort food!

I made the recipe as is and, although it was eaten without grumbling, no one in my family really had much to say about it.  We have never had tuna casserole before so weren't really sure what to expect, it was not the most appealing food we've tried.  I usually give recipes a couple tries before I give them up so we'll try this again and see if its something to keep in our dinner rotation.  I loved that it was fast and I had all the ingredients on hand.

Very simple dish!  I did add the french fried onions & broiled it for a couple minutes--and I'm glad I did.  It needed a little something extra.  I also used frozen peas b/c I don't like canned peas.  All in all, it was a quick, easy dish that I will make again.

This is a perfect quick dinner fix!!  It is great just the way it is, or I've also modified it a few times.  Add 2 tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce, this just gives it a slightly richer home-cooked taste. I have also made it with cream of celery instead of mushroom. To make more just add egg noodles. This is a must try dish!  Serve with salad, whole wheat rolls and honey butter. Mmmm.

All three of my kids (ages 10, 5, & 3) loved this. Two of them asked for seconds. I was out of regular mac & cheese, so we had Scooby Doo and Pokemon shaped tuna noodle casserole. :) Will definitely make again and love that it can be made quickly from pantry staples.

Very good! I pre-heated my oven to 350. I prepped as per instructions, then once the casserole was done, placed it in a greased 13X9. Covered with a can on French's Onions and baked for 30 mins! Family loved it!

Brilliant!  I always though traditional tuna casserole was too bland with just cream of mushroom, but the addition of the mac and cheese is BRILLIANT!  So quick to make, in about 12 minutes the first bite is already in your mouth.  Awesome.

Not bad for being so quick.  Was a bit bland, maybe add more cheese or salt & pepper or something.  I crumbled tortilla chips on top to give it some crunch.  Maybe the canned peas were what made it so bland? :)  Trying frozen next time.

Yum! I used albacore tuna, and because I didn't have peas, I used frozen mixed veggies (corn, peas, green beans, carrots). I also mixed in 1 cup of sharp cheddar, because tuna casserole needs melted cheese! :) This is great comfort food. I have always loved tuna casserole, and never thought of making it with boxed mac 'n cheese. What a great idea! Thanks!

I've been making this since I was 12, so almost 30 years.  It's super easy, and I've even learned to speed it up by mixing the drained tuna and cream of mushroom soup with the cheese packet from the mac and cheese, along with a handful (1/2 cup to a cup) of grated cheese (colby, cheddar, something along those lines or even a processed American cheese slice or two broken up a bit) in a microwavable casserole dish and heating for a minute while the noodles are boiling.  I don't add any milk--doesn't really need it in my opinion with the cheese helping with the creaminess.  But I do add a couple of shakes of black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder in (not salt--there's plenty of that already).  I also omit the peas--not my thing, but do add a can of (drained) sliced mushrooms to add a little extra texture.  Once the noodles are ready, drain and combine with the microwaved mixture and it's ready to serve.  But it's not as pretty--go with the breadcrumbs suggestion and pop it in the oven if you're going for presentation.  This is the "who cares how it looks, just need to get dinner on the table" version.  This is a super easy recipe for the beginner cook.  I don't think you could mess it up unless you didn't cook the noodles correctly, so if you're a novice--just watch those and don't let them get too mushy.

I had half a box of Deluxe Mac  leftover that *someone* didn't eat.  I used cream of chicken cuz it's what I had, would usually use cr of celery for this.  I added a diced  rib of celery and some celery seed and a few pinches of tarragon.  Nuked that with half a can of soup then added that to my leftover mac.  Added the onions on top and baked and  it was way better than the original mac alone.

YUM!!  I am not a cook, so I decided to try this, it seeming so easy and all.  It turned out great!  Instead of peas, I used green beans, and also added potato chips and parmesean on top for a nice crust.  I will use this recipe again, maybe with chicken or baby shrimp next time!

This is a great quick recipe. I used frozen mixed vegetables, frozen peas, and a can of bamboo shoots. Also, I added some more milk and sprinkled bread crumbs on top.

This was surprising good considering how simple it is to make! This has become a quick & easy family favorite that even the kids can put together with little help. I didn't have chips to add to the top the first time I made it, so we added Bugles corn snacks... WOW, I keep Bugles on hand just for this easy dinner!

So easy to prepare, economical and my family really likes this.  My family won't eat anything prepared with soup.  They eat this. lol  I've made it twice now and do find that adding about 1/2 cup of milk makes it a little creamier.  I also add frozen mixed peas and carrots instead of canned peas.  I just throw the frozen veggies into the boiling water with the pasta about 5 minutes before the pasta is done.  Oh & I have added bread crumbs to the topping before baking too.  My husband agrees with the writer of this recipe that the canned fried onions would be good on top.  Haven't tried that yet though.  Thanks for the recipe.

My family LOVED it. It's hard to find something all 4 of us like. My son hates vegetables and he even ate the peas. My daughter would have eaten them too but they are "green". I doubled the recipe because I knew this wouldn't be enough for my family of 4 and I added the fried onions. I also used cream of chicken soup because my family doesn't like mushrooms. I baked it at 350 degrees  for about 15 min. Thank you for this easy, delicious  recipe!

We were in the mood for this and found it very easy to make. I added some pepper, chopped mushrooms and used 3/4 can mush soup rather than all of it. Then put in casserole bowl and added crushed potato chips on top and baked 30 min at 350 degrees.

I didn’t have canned peas so I used 10 oz. of frozen peas. Delicious!  Will do it again.

I did not change anything and I loved it.  I was concerned about “ Mr. Picky”.   He liked it so much, when I got up the next morning, he had warmed some up for breakfast, of all things.  I have already shared this “so easy” recipe with six other people.  I’m ready for it again...maybe tomorrow!?!?
This is my first review and I’ve been with Allrecipes for many years.   Thank you.

Surprisingly yummy. Husband said it could use less pees. I liked it just the way it is. I did not replace the mushroom soup with chicken cream soup like I’m usually tempted to do. Did seem like a College Dorm delight!

This is the way my mother made tuna casserole. The only difference is she added finely chopped red onions, ( about 1/4 cup) and topped the casserole with shredded cheddar cheese and baked it until hot and bubbly. It’s a comfort food quick and easy dinner at its best!

Turned out  great! I substituted cream of broccoli soup, added shredded string cheese on top as well as bread crumbs, and broiled it for a few minutes. VERY easy and tasty!

I love this, reminds me of my teenage years. Awesome for those nights at home alone, or having no patience to cook. I still make it when time is restricted or on a budget. Easy for my teenager to make. And we all enjoy it. To the person who calls this lazy, no it's not gourmet, but who needs gourmet all the time??

I just made this basically as written, except I had to add a little more milk to my Mac and cheese, but that was probably the brand. I added some additional smothered mushrooms (from this site), just because I had to use them. It does taste exactly like what I remember from growing up in the 80's, but it's not especially mind blowing. I think when I reheat it for dinner, I'll try the fried onion trick to jazz it up. Regardless, it gets five stars for the use of basic pantry ingredients and speed of prep (like 15 minutes, tops). Plus, it made a TON.  It's just my hubby and me, so we're going to be eating it for a week and/or feeding our neighbors. I'll likely keep this one in the box for crummy winter days like today, cause it's most def. comfort food, and it's so quick to make with stuff I usually have on hand.

This is by far the best tuna casserole I've ever made, and it was sooooo easy! I added extra sharp cheddar and French onions to the top. I'll definitely be making this again. This would also be a great addition to anyone's food storage, these ingredients are easy to keep around.

the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because as a casserole, I felt this version is missing the best part... cheese on top as well as Lays regular potato chips crumbled on top of the cheese. Best you'll ever have!

It tastes as lazy as it is, it reminded me of when you put ketchup on noodles and call it spaghetti. It is definitely quick and easy to make but I can't say I enjoyed it and it won't be back a second time.

I made the mac and cheese as directed (spiral noodles) then threw everything into a casserole dish (instead of mixing everything in the pot) and added a light layer of cheddar and about 6 or 7 buttery crackers crushed on top.. WONDERFUL! the crackers did it so much justice, thank you for this easy peasy recipe.

This is one of my favorite quick fixes. I love tuna casserole but I've never had one made in my own home. This is now a staple in my home. This casserole is just as tasty as any dinner gathering tuna casserole. I just need to make my honey something else so I can eat all the casserole :P

Really surprised how good this is. Needed seasonings. Per reviewer suggestions I added garlic salt, onion & herb, a big dollop of sour crm (about 1/4 cup), and pepper. Also doubled the mac & chz so the tuna wouldn't be overpowering.  Next time I'll cook the macaroni less than directed so it's not too soft. Picky 2 yo & Hubby devoured this :-)

I love the ingredients in this dish, so I decided to give it a try.  It was very bland and the soup flavor was very overpowering to the dish.  I had to add a bunch of spices and some extra cheddar cheese to have any taste in this dish.  I would not make this dish again.

My husband liked it he actually said instead of peas try asparagus and top with sweet potato chips. It is quick and easy to make, for me it was ok but I am not a tuna fan. Still it deserves a five and yet again another recipe to do so much with and change to your tastes.

I happened to have a lot of left overs from the "Old Fashioned Mac and Cheese" recipe from here and decided to couple it with this recipe. Although I did not add peas, it was phenomenal! Combined everything in a pot on the stove top with no problems. I know my boyfriend will absolutely love it and cannot wait to try this with peas next time.

I mixed everything together on the stove using a bag of steamer peas instead of canned, then I put it in a casserole dish, added shredded cheddar cheese and Panko bread crumbs to the top, Baked at 350 for 30 minutes and it was fantastic. Everybody had seconds and even thirds. Quick, Easy, and Delicious. I'll be making it again for sure.

so simple and so quick. definitely a life saver when you are short on ingredients and/or time. also, adding mustard and a little cream cheese makes it super creamy and gives it a little extra kick of flavor.

Quick and easy to prepare! Tried it with half can of condensed cream of chicken, and half cup of milk for a creamy texture. I didn't have peas, so used zucchini instead in small cube pieces, cooked in the same water with the pasta during the last couple of minutes only. I will cook it again for sure.

Easy, tasty, quick! I made this and then put it in the oven to stay warm until the hubs got home @ about 275 degrees with some grated cheddar on top, which made it that much yummier (about 30 mins). I made extra, to freeze but we ended up eating it all later that night. 
Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was pretty good, but my husband and 2 yr old daughter LOVED it.  One of the easiest things to make which is always a plus!  I couln't bring myself to use tuna (bad memories of tuna casserole as a child) and used chicken but I think I will try tuna next time around.

This is an excellent easy recipe that everyone will love.  Additionally, I added some fresh grated Parmesan cheese to the recipe and once combined I put it in a casserole dish and topped it with panko bread crumbs and the baked it for 30 minutes.  So tasty.

Pretty good, I followed the recipe and tasted, felt it needed a little more flavor.  Added some of the fried onions into the mixture and few tablespoons of chives.  Better, but still not very exciting, just ok to me.  Thought it just tasted like mac and cheese with tuna added.  Don't feel it's worth the high calories

Super easy! I was trying to find a way to trick my picky 3yr old into eating tuna and after staring/picking at it for 10 minutes he finally ate it (ok, half of what I served him but it's still an accomplishment)! My husband even went back for seconds. I didn't add the peas because I didn't want to press my luck with Mr. Picky but i did add grated cheese to make it cheesier and a couple of drops of BBQ sauce on my serving because I was feeling adventurous. Thank you so much fo this recipe!

What a nice surprise! I've been making my old  tuna casserole recipe for forty years, and it didn't occur to me that there was a better--and quicker alternative.  This is one of those "comfort foods". It is not meant to be a flavor-intensive, multi-ingredient meal. It is flavorful and soothing. My family declared it a "winner", and everyone had seconds.  For preparation, I used "Healthy Request" cream of mushroom soup, and two 5-oz. cans of water-packed tuna, drained, with the other ingredients. I also added about half a cup of canned fried onions to the mixture, poured it into an 8x12-inch glass baking dish with a light coating of cooking spray, and baked it at 350F for about 15 minutes. I then sprinkled more fried onions on top of the casserole and baked it for another 4 minutes. This casserole is also quite economical.  Thanks, Tresa!

This is a great dinner when you are short on time. My picky children and husband enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe using two boxes of extra creamy mack n cheese, two cans of tuna, one can of mushroom soup, half a can of milk and one can of peas. The cheese powder was mixed with the soup and milk in a bowl then added to the macaroni, tuna and peas mix.  I also added lots of pepper and topped with Italian bread crumbs.

I didn't know what this would come out as, but it was great, quick and easy. I made this for my oldest son, just so he could see how easy it was to make a dish. He loved it so much he took the leftovers home with him to eat the next day. He told me weeks later that he made it for some friends and it was a hit!!!!! Thanks

This has become a family fav for my young boys. I normally can't get them to eat fish especially tuna. Even my husband loves it. I have changed it to suit my own tastes however. Instead of using cheddar mac and cheese I use white cheddar mac and cheese, leave out the butter, and bake in the oven with mozza or marble cheese ontop. Sometimes I fry some onions and add it with the peas depending on how much time I have. A wonderful quick meal for few pennies. :D

This was super fast and pretty tasty.  I put crushed potato chips on top and it really needed the salt.  Will make again, but will add some seasonings.

Definitely creamy but strangely enough, I really enjoy box mac'n'cheese.  So the addition of the tuna just ruined it for me.  I wanted to like it but sadly, didn't.

this was pretty good and simple if you are looking for a quick easy dinner, I did do a few things different, I mixed everything together and also added shredded cheddar cheese put into a baking dish added more cheese on top (did not have potato chips or crackers) and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. My husband went back for 2nds so I will make this again.

Sooo fast and easy, as well as delicious.  I made this in about 10 min!  Instead of peas, I used about a cup of frozen mixed veggies, rinced them in the colender, then drained the noodles over them, meanwhile i added cream of chicken (didn't have mushroom) the milk, cheese sauce & butter (per mac box) in the pan and mixed well, added the tuna, then added the noodles and veggies, mixed well, placed in oven safe casserole dish threw some fried onions on top and placed under broiler for 2 min.  Was sooo good, and the easiest I have made in a long time!  Kids and husband both enjoyed!

I modified the recipe by substituting a box of pre-sliced dried pototoes with sour cream and onion dried seasoning instead of the cream of mushroom soup. And I used a bag of frozen mixed garden veggies instead of peas. I put the goods in a casserole dish and baked at 450 for 15 minutes per the potato box instructions, then broiled for another 5 minutes. I also added in 1/4 cup of chopped red peppers, which I think went really well with the tuna flavor. It was great and I would definitely make it again. I think almost any creamy, starchy household food could substitute in for the soup and the dish will still turn out, it just takes an extra 15-20 mins. Very good. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe idea.

This was super quick and easy.  I loved the fact that I made the whole thing in one pot on the stove top.  I made a few minor adjustments based on what I had on hand.  I made the mac & cheese using only almond milk (I prefer it to regular milk); no butter or margarine.  I also used a cup of frozen peas (cooked in micro first) and a 6 oz pouch of tuna.  It was a tad on the salty side for me, which I expected, so I plan on using lower sodium soup next time.  I didn't have any french fried onions, but I didn't miss them at all.  It was soooo good!

Pretty good.. the soup added a nice creamy taste to it.  Didn't really make enough for 2 adults and 3 kids.. next time will probably make a double batch.  I also added some garlic powder and some italian seasoning to give it a little flavor. also avoided the peas..  All in all everyone ate it and was pretty satisifed with it.  A keeper - probably could also do alot of variations with this and be either just at yummy or even more.

Super easy recipe and tastes great too! My husband hates tuna and he even said it wasn't bad...which means he liked it! I put shredded cheddar on mine before I put it in the oven. Adds a little something. And I sprinkle in a little dill to the mixture. Yummy! Thanks for such a great recipe!!

Very easy!  I used whole wheat pasta and it worked well.  I had trouble seasoning it though...it came out very bland for me.  But then again, I'm reluctant to put any salt or pepper on anything.

I do a slight variation of the recipe in that I don't add the mac & cheese.  That also allows me to just throw the rest of the ingredients together, toss in the microwave for about 5 minutes (or until heated through) and voila.  From start to finish you've maybe invested 10 minutes, if that.

Very quick, pretty tasty.  I added a little bit more milk to smooth it out a bit and topped it toasted breadcrumbs.  Will likely make it again.

My mom made this recipe all the time when I was growing up.  Its not the fanciest or most flavorful, but its good and quick and simple.  And you can doctor it up any way you want.  I actually made this a lot when I was in college-its got all your food groups in it, and that's pretty good for a college student in the dorms!

This is a great, easy recipe that is quick for those nights when you just don't have a lot of time. It's not really anything special but it tastes pretty good and it gets extra points for being fast. I added sauteed onions and mushrooms, though I am not sure it really changed much, maybe next time I'll just keep those on the side.

This was really good.  I had never had a tuna casserole before, but they always sound good when I come across the recipes.  Anyway, I didn't use any butter in preparing the mac & cheese, and I used a can of green beans, can of tuna, and a can of Campbell's Healthy Request Cream of Chicken soup.  When it was all mixed, I put it in a buttered casserole dish and topped with bread crumbs and baked until crunchy (used the broiler for 2 minutes).  By the way, be sure not to cook the macaroni all the way through if you plan on putting it all in the oven.  That way, it won't turn to mush and the pasta will still absorb the sauce as it cooks and will be slightly al dente.  I would definitely make this again with more veggies added.

For what it is (a quick, easy meal), this dish was great.  Minimal ingredients, minimal effort and the reward is a good hearty meal after working late.  Definitely has room to experiment but also stands well alone.

This was amazing.  I did as others suggested and used one can of broth and one can of cream of chicken.  I also sprinkled chedder on top and baked in until the cheese was melted.  My boyfriend had some friends over, so I had to come up with something to feed five hungry men.  They loved it so much they were still talking about it the next day!

I was desperate for something quick with minimal ingredients.  I found this, but wasn't hopeful.  It was fantastic for the amount of work it took!  I used Healthy Choice mac & cheese (frozen), and added peas and carrots.  VERY good, and a great recipe for those nights you need a last minute meal!

It was ok, but not the greatest.  I added a little milk to make it creamy.  I found it very salty and did not think the macaroni dinner mixed well at all with the soup.

nice! my mom made it for me to eat at the hospital and it was delicious! i think to add a bit more texture, we could sprinkle some crushed potato chips on top for some crunchy taste.

this is SOOO QUICK to prepare!! tastes really really good too. the husband likes it too because it's not too rich so it doesn't leave u feeling sick when u've had too much to eat. i didnt have mushroom soup so i used chicken-mushroom instead. but seriously, so UNBELIEVABLY quick to prepare and suprisingly yummy..

Not bad for how fast you can put it together. I have to admit that I prefer to make my tuna casserole a different way, but this is good when you got to get dinner on the table fast.

Kids ate real well. Didn't have peas so we used frozen mixed veggies.

This is an excellent QUICK recipe. Perfect for those nights when you are in a hurry but want a good meal. I topped it with the fried onions and it was very good. A definite keeper in my family!
