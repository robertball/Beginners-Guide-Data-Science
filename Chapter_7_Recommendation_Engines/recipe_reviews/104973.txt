This was fabulous. I didn't have sea salt so I just used regular salt. I also used dried rosemary. I poached the salmon on the stove top with the marinade and a bit of water since I don't have a grill. The flavour of the marinade really came through, but it didn't overpower the salmon.

Made this recipe as is, but doubled the recipe and put all ingredients in a blender to save time on mincing garlic and chopping rosemary.  Marinated salmon in a ziplock bag for about 2-1/2 hours and then grilled it.  It was perfect!  Taste was wonderful.  Everyone loved it. No leftovers!!!

Delicious! I made this for my boyfriend on Valentines and he couldn't stop talking about it. I don't have a grill so I cooked it in a pan with a little olive oil on medium heat, making sure to cook it mainly on the non-skin side so it kept it really moist.

The flavor was light and the addition of the sea salt really boosted the complexity without overpowering the taste of the salmon. I'll certainly make this one again!

I eat salmon b/c it is healthy.  I don't like the flavor of fish.  BUT this was awesome! Even my kids liked it (and they don't like fish either). We will definately make this again.  TRY IT! Delicious!!!!

This marinade is so easy and flavorful! I added more balsamic vinegar and some basil just to mix it up, turned out very well. My boyfriend absolutely loved it. Pairs will with any rice dish.

I marinated for the minimum of 30 minutes and it wasn't very flavorful.  I'll marinate the salmon longer next time and hopefully that helps.  It was still pretty tasty though.

I'm not particularly fond of seafood but this was an excellent dish and a big hit at my dinner party. Very flavorful without overpowering the delicate flavor of the salmon.  I marinated for at least 2 hours before grilling.

This was very simple and extremely tasty!  I used minced garlic from a jar and fresh rosemary out of the garden. My 5 year old daughter liked this as well as the grown ups!  Will make again!

To clarify, use DIRECT (not INDIRECT) grilling method - e.g. directly over the flame. Temp of 400 - 450 degrees works well. If cooking with the skin on, cook that side second. Would consider 6 minutes on the first side and then 2-3 minutes on the skin-down side.

PLEASE NOTE THAT FRESH FISH IS NOT SUPPOSED TO TASTE OR SMELL FISHY.  IT'S NOT GOOD FISH IF IT DOES.

This is a great recipe!

This recipe is amazing! I made it last night for me and my boyfriend and we both loved it. I didn't have regular olive oil, so I used my lemon infused olive oil and it turned out great! And because I live in an apartment, I was unable to cook the salmon on a grill so I pan seared it in a non-stick skillet with some white cooking wine and more olive oil. My boyfriend came back for seconds to finish it off. My lemon garlic asparagus paired well with the salmon.

I loved this marinade! I tried it twice, both letting the fish sit for almost half a day (or maybe more). I cooked the first one on my electric grill, the result was not that good, and I could not understand if it was the marinade or my cooking. Next time I tried broiling the salmon in my oven, and the result was awesome! So it wasn't the marinade but my grill. This is definitely one of my favourites!

I didn't have lemon juice, but that omission wasn't a problem. This was the first time I used sea salt (coarse) and I think it added awesome flavor to the dish. I was also cooking swordfish along with the salmon, and marinated both together for about 20 min and baked for 25 min at 350. Superb!!!

I only had two salmon fillets and made the same amount of marinade, let it marinade in the fridge for about two hours.  It tasted good, but just a very faint subtle taste.  I prefer more of a punch.  Overall good recipe though, I might tweak it if I make it again, not a huge fan of the flavor the rosemary added.

I am not a big fan of rosemary, but the flavors in this were a wonderful combination. I actually baked this in the oven with the marinade and it turned out fabulous. I drizzled some marinade over the salmon as I served it - delish!

This was a Hit for Fathers Day! I used salmon steaks and I did use a blender to mix all of the ingredients.  What I did different was adding some fresh ginger, garlic and scallions to the mixture as well.  Deelish on the grill.

What an awesome recipe!!! Used lime juice instead of lemon--probably cuz I read the lime-marinated recipe first and was thinking of margaritas--and it was very yummy!!!! my new favorite marinade.... thanx for sharing

I don't like fish but I've been wanting to try to at least find a recipe where I can eat it for the health benefits.  I marinated the fish for an hour and my salmon did not pick up much of this flavor at all.

This is fantastic. Ive had salmon in so many ways, and was looking for a new way to cook it. The flavor was beautiful and not too strong, but worked well with the salmon flavor. I added more garlic,olive oil and vinegar as my fiancee and i are both garlic and balsamic lovers, but it was still good.. too bad he's sick and clogged up to he couldnt get the full flavor of it! I'll def make this again.

I haven't had much experience cooking fish.  I'm always afraid I won't get it done, and so end up drying it out, and stinking up the house while I'm at it!  But I was determined to try this.  The only thing I did differently was to use dill in place of the rosemary.  I realize that is changing a key ingredient, but I know I like dill, and I have negative memories of rosemary, so I made the switch.  Four or five minutes on the George Foreman grill, and I had a delicious dish!

This just did not work for us which is disappointing because it smelled fantastic prior to grilling.  Did not taste the marinate at all and I followed the recipe exactly (something I normally don't do), using fresh ingredients.  I used a very good balsamic vinegar too.  Definitely needs a lot longer marinate time or something.  Will probably not make again but thanks for the idea.  It was interesting to try.

Excellent marinade! I was tired of the typical lemon and garlic salmon recipe I always use, so I tried this one. What a great change! I used this marinade on steak and it worked really well, too.

Rosemary is one of my favorite spices and this recipe made a delicious and delicately flavored salmon!  I BBQ'd the fillet on a piece of foil sprayed with Pam and it was delicious!

Very subtle, melt-in-your-mouth that doesn't cover too much of the salmon's unique flavors!

This was an exceptional salmon dish.  Absolutely delicious and easy and quick to prepare.  My entire family loved this and asked me to make it again very soon.  A good dish for company as well.  I served this with fresh green beans and a simple salad.  Wonderful!

My whole family loved this recipe. I made it for Passover with just a couple alterations. I didn't add any salt. I added lemon zest and I cooked the fish on cedar planks. Fantastic!

This is a very good recipe - as other reviewers have suggested, I doubled the marinade and left the salmon in it for longer than the recipe indicated; for three hours. There are other excellent salmon recipes on this site that are also well worth making  including, Asian Salmon, Salmon with Chive Mayonnaise and Maple Salmon. Thanks for adding to the collection.

Very easy, I added about a 1/4 cup of white wine(vigonier)the second time I made this and that also added another note of flavor.

Delicious!  I doubled the garlic and added black pepper.  Broiled ~8 minutes.  Served with spinach salad and homemade herb bread.  I love the simple, clean flavors of this recipe.  Yum!

Simple, but very good.  I really liked the rosemary on the salmon.  I use balsamic vinegar  lot, but the rosemary really added more depth to the flavor.  I served the fish with sauteed asparagus and red potatoes.

This was okay, and the guests all raved, but I personally like other recipes better.  I marinated this for about 3 hours and it still seemed pretty bland.  It just wasn't a "WOW!" recipe I don't think.

I would definitely recommend marinating for more than 30 minutes to really bring the flavors out.  I marinated for a little under 2 hours and I still think it could have stood a little more time.  I'll definitely try this again and marinate for at least 4 hours.  Goes great over a bed of spinach.

The salmon remained firm and moist. A tad over powering with all the ingredients, masking the salmon flavor a bit much.

Absolutely wonderful! And this is coming from someone who isn't a big salmon fan.  My husband and I both thought this was very tasty and light. The the prep work is a piece of cake.  Great for an evening meal. We will most definitely be making this again.  I have a feeling it will becoame a family favorite.

Salmon is such a good tasting fish anyway, this is just not a flavorful enough marinade to put on this fish.  I am not the greatest cook, so I will chalk it up to that.  Otherwise, cooking it for 4 minutes per side was pretty accurate.

Seriously good. It made a nice crunchy crust on the outside and flakey within. I didn't have lemon juice but it still came out really good. I also roasted some potatoes and had a nice arugula salad with tomatoes with it. Hubby and I both enjoyed it. Plus it was very easy!

First time cooking salmon on the new grill...used this recipe and it was excellent. I'm not a huge salmon fan, but try to eat it some since it's so good for you. Will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks!

This recipe was good, but I think will be better with a longer marinade time (perhaps 1-2 hours). I don't think fish is supposed to be marinaded for longer than 30 minutes, so maybe doubling the amount of the marinade would be beneficial. I subbed the fresh rosemary with 1 tsp dried rosemary, but otherwise made the recipe as written. The flavor of the fish was good, but it was just a subtle hint of the marinade. I will try this recipe again with either double marinade or a longer marinade time. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Such a quick and easy recipe for a busy wife!  The marinade took no time at all to assemble.  Marinading the fish took only  twenty minutes.  The barbecue time was also short.  THIS SALMON IS GREAT!  Hubby likes it....I do as well!  Thanks for posting.

The only reason I gave the recipe 4 stars is because I didn't give the marinade enough time. I was in a rush so the salmon only marinaded for 15 minutes, but it was good nonetheless. Next time I will have to let it sit for at least 30 minutes.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

An awesome recipe. I do recommend marinating the salmon for a longer period of time (45+ minutes) for a rich flavour :)

Quick and easy as stated. The fish was good but seemed to lack some flavor. I marinated the fish for 1.5 hours without the lemon juice and then 30 minutes with the lemon to save time at my BBQ. Next time, when I have more time,I'm going to try making a balsamic sauce for the salmon as mentioned by the writer of the recipe.

think I will try marinating much longer than the 45 mins that I did. Otherwise, good recipe! (Also added just a touch of basil - felt  needed something else.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I used tangerine balsamic vinegar instead of regular balsamic. I had leftover Rosemary twigs, so I laid those on top and marinated for 2 hours.

My husband and  I and our friends absolutely loved this dish tonight!!!  Took advice from previous reviews, doubled ingredients,    blended marinade in blender and marinated salmon 2 hours, grilled on BBQ.  Served with apple-craisin-celery-walnut salad with a cinnamon/nutmeg sour cream dressing, fresh grilled corn on the cob, and 3 cheese garlic sourdough bread. Dessert...homemade blackberry ice cream!!!

Both my husband and I are not big salmon eaters and I am trying to find recipes to increase my appetite for this healthy food.  Well.....this one did the trick and I'm sure I'll make it much more.  Thanks for the tasty and delightful recipe.  I made it almost exactly as indicated.  The salmon pieces were thin like your picture so the 4 min. was fine.  It does want to flare up and burn a bit, but I did not mind the outside a bit crisp on the ends as the inside was very moist and DEElicious !!

this was excellent.  spices did not overpower the taste of the salmon but enhanced it. Used a little more rosemary and garlic.  will definitely make again.

I personally don't like most of the salmon out there, but I made this for my wife and she loved it! I substituted halibut for my portion and over cooked my fish, but the salmon came out tender, juicy and delicious! Quick and easy, great for a busy household!

I was looking for an alternative to the usual sweet Asian-themed marinades in most of the other salmon recipies.  This one was turned out great!  Definitely a keeper as it's tasty, and easy to prepare.

Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  I marinated for 30-40 minutes and felt the flavor was good but too light, maybe it needed to sit longer.

Easy and delicious.  I did not shake off the excess marinade as suggested; why would you, it is so good?  Next time, I won't mince the Rosemary.  I will just pull it off the stem and leave it as is.

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL all the way around. I was in a hurry for supper and this made a wonderfully juicy, tasteful and quick dinner. I added all ingredients and a little bit of butter on the top before putting it in the oven. DEFINATELY one I will do over and over again.

My husband and I enjoyed this salmon.  I broiled instead f grilling, and I think it would be even better if I had been able to grill it.  The marinade gave it a very nice flavor, especially if you are a rosemary fan.  I will make this again.

I baked a large fillet at 350 for about 25 minutes, and it came out very juicy. We enjoyed it, but I probably won't make it again--I didn't love the rosemary with the salmon.

This was sooooooooo good!  I made it for an extended family BBQ, the kids and adults loved it.  There was not a flake to be found after dinner.  Thanks for the great recipe..I will use it again for sure.

This is a great recipe. When I saw it in the newsletter I knew I had to put it in the recipe box. It was simple and worked well on an indoor electric grill. The salmon was very moist. I had a little mariande left over (used a dinner plate to marinate the fish and all of the marinade wouldn't fit) so I drizzled the leftover on top of the fish when it was plated. This was one of my favorite dishes using salmon...this is definately a keeper.

Wow!! This was fantastic -- the best salmon I've ever tasted. I marinated it in the refrigerator for 6 hours. I broiled it 4 mins. on each side because I ran out of propane for my gas grill. It came out very juicy, tender and flaky.

My hubby is not a fan of fish.  But with this marinade he has changed his mind.  The marinade is simple to make and is not overpowering to the over all flavor of the dish.

Very good! The ingredients lent a delicate flavor that didn't overpower the taste of the salmon. Thanks for the recipe.
