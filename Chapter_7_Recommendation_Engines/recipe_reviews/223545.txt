Had to find sangria that you you could put together quickly . Thought I would give it a try even though it only had 1 review . Made this with Pinot Grigio as I'm not fond of Riesling. Made for a large crowd so I tripled recipie. It was a huge hit.

Very tasty. Served with mixed frozen fruit(strawberry, mango, peach, pineapple) and topped with club soda. Be careful, though, goes down easy and it is strong!

Made this recipe exactly and it was great! I am sure you could do a lot to add to flavors, etc, but you don't need to! I love that I could make this really quickly at a party or right before I leave. Not much prep time there! Thanks!

Refreshing!  Made it for Easter weekend, everyone loved it!  Added a bit of orange juice, used quality pineapple juice and instead of frozen peaches did sliced up oranges, lemons and limes.
