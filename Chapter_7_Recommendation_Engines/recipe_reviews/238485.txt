My new comfort food. Since I had only 6 mangos I cut the sugar in the batter to 1 1/2 cups. 10 minutes before it was done I dusted some sugar in the raw on top for added crunch. It tasted good warm and cold. Will make it again.

This is a good recipe which won the admiration of my guests... I would say heating mango with the sugar and water is a step that could be skipped to avoid the cobbler being too liquidy and taking longer to bake. A recommendation is add some more mango after the cobbler is out. Mangoes lose their flavor when baked so adding some fresh mangoes would enhance the taste

Very tasty. I added a tsp each of cinnamon cardamom and nutmeg to the batter to give it flavor. I used peaches and mangos because that s what I had and it was a perfect combo. I just subbed 1 peach for 1 mango. I would not put the entire 2 cups of syrup on top. The batter is very wet already I added only 1/2 a cup extra.

Had unexpected guests and wanted to serve something special without having to go out shopping. A bag of frozen mango led me to try out this recipe and it was a great success. Only thing I did different was to use frozen mango and since the bag was only 1 lb. I cut the batter recipe in half and used a smaller pan. I also let the mango and sugar water simmer quite a bit longer since the fruit needed to thaw anyway.

This recipe was too sweet and lacked flavor. I would add cinnamon and nutmeg if I made it again and cut down on the amout of sugar.

I bought a 26 oz can of mangoes in syrup but no one liked them. So I used it in this recipe and it turned out DELICIOUS! I omitted the step of making syrup and simply used the syrupy juice from the can instead. I estimated that this size can was 3-4 mangoes worth so I cut the entire recipe in half. The amounts of the ingredients were just right!

The final product was a runny mess with batter that never set up even after cooking additional time.

This cobbler was amazing! I did substitute self rising for the all purpose salt and baking powder... and left out the water. I also used a bit less sugar than called for and it still turned out plenty sweet. I will definitely make this again. I believe using any fruit you have on hand would also work lyk:)

This was a delicious recipe. I had to substitute the milk for a nut milk because I don’t eat or drink dairy products and it was still super delicious!
