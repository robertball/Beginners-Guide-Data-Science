Very tasty.  I sauted my tofu with olive oil, curry powder, and honey instead of boiling.  I used non-fat plain yogurt and added honey to the mixture.  This is an excellent alternative to egg salad or chicken salad.  Mine was served with whole wheat pitas! yum!

My Personal Note
I tried to keep the preparation for the tofu simple and I agree that it can be bland if just boiled. I usually saute the tofu in oil with cumin or a mixture of spices (like curry as suggested in the reviews) and let it sit in casserole dish in the oven at a low temp. I also interchange raisins and cranberries or use both.

I left out the rice and used rasins in place of cranberries. I used a pre-marinated tofu block as the base. It was fantastic with wheat pita!!!

This is an excellent introduction to tofu and I have served it for many people, sometimes incognito.  I highly recommend cooking the tofu in a pan, high heat, olive or sesame oil, with some cumin seeds, garam masala, curry powder, etc, beforehand.  Also, be sparing with the yogurt and the flavours of the nuts and cranberries will come through.

Very yummy.  I am withholding the full 5 stars, though, since I reserve those for recipes I consider "outstanding".  I brought this for a potluck to work and received many compliments.  As mentioned in previous reviews, I would recommend you saute the tofu in olive oil with a few middle eastern spices for added flavor (I used garam masala, cumin seeds, and curry powder).  I also decreased the amount of yogurt by about 25% and added a drizzle of honey.  Served plain (not with pitas) and it was very good.

I made this a while ago and never since.  LOL.  Just getting around to posting.  I must say that I really enjoy curried chicken salad, but also really like tofu.  This recipe had nice aspects - grapes, nuts, zing from yogurt, & yummy curry flavor- but I found I had to pan sear the tofu first with garlic and curry powder to get any flavor into it & then with the addition of celery (YUCK) I just couldn't wrap my tastebuds around this one.  After the addition of additional dried fruit, I was able to swallow down a bit of it (mostly felt bad abt wasting the food).  Too many textures and it almost had a curried cardboard aftertaste. LOL. Just my opinion.  Give it a go!  You may like it.

This is a very versatile recipe! It can be made sweet or savory.
I planned to make this as written, but for some reason as I was preparing it, I wasn't in the mood for   the curry. So I left it out. I figured I'd take it to work for lunch the next day,but I brought the shaker tin of curry with me in case I wanted to add it in then.

I also had some for a snack, and added a little honey
and cinnamon... Was great considering the cranberries and walnuts . I discovered it's a great breakfast / snack .... So Ive also made this and added a container of a premix blend of nuts, seeds and dried fruits that I got at my healthfood store 
 along with the other ingredients. So much better than just yogurt and granola.... And the protein packed tofu makes it a great breakfast that will hold you over until after lunch time!!!!! I'd like to try it with mint, apples, maybe pears and ginger. You really can add anything to it. I know I'll make this every week.

Excellent mix of sweet, spicy and tangy.  For crispy tofu, shake the tofu cubes in a bag of corn meal and a little cumin before pan frying in olive oil.  We served the salad in pitas on lettuce.  Delicious!  Next time I'd go for a flatbread instead.

I really liked this one. I used lite tofu and fat free greek-style yogurt (Fage). I think it needs a little more spice, or toss in a few more cranberries or grapes. I ate mine in whole wheat tortillas, on lettuce, and in a pita. It was yummy.

This recipe is very similar to a salad I found at whole foods. It's a bit spicy for me but not too bad. Great summer salad and very easy to make!

Even though this is a vegetarian recipe, I made it with canned chicken. I also omitted the grapes, walnuts, cranberries and celery (out of lack of groceries in the house) and used raisins, greek yogurt and cashews. I loved the flavor and texture! It is as good as my favorite coffeeshop's Chicken Curry Salad Sandwich, and I'm so happy I can make it at home now.

This is one of those use whatever you have that works recipes, I love it! I saut√©ed my tofu cubes after freezing for about an hour to firm up with a TB each of honey, olive oil, and curry powder. I ended up adding extra ts of curry and honey. I added freshly grated ginger while the tofu was sauteeing and now I feel like an idiot for not adding orange zest. I used nonfat yogurt, raisins in place of cranberries, cashews and almonds in place of walnuts, and used a apple and a peach, instead of grapes. I drizzled berry balsamic vinaigrette and mustard on top and mixed it in and that just made all the flavors pop. Way too strange for my family, but no matter. Fav ways to eat--with flavored Triscuits( the saltiness of the cracker and the sweetness of the tofu) and with a whole wheat tortilla, in a wrap with papaya and pineapple chunks folded in as well. whatever you do, you gotta love it!

I should have followed the advice of other raters and sauteed the tofu.  Boiling it didn't make it too tasty.  Otherwise a pretty decent recipe.
