Good idea, but the additions to the beans are all overkill in proportion.  I used half of the sesame seeds and my beans were swimming in them.  Same with the soy sauce and the amount of oil was totally unnecessary.

I didn't use nearly as much oil as the recipe called for and I used a mixture of part sesame and vegetable.  I used just a sprinkling of sesame seeds rather than what the recipe stated.  Just a couple of changes and this recipe is great.

Made this recipe with fresh green beans.  It was good- felt it was missing something though.  Perhaps a bit of garlic...

These didn't look very good and they didn't taste very good either.  The one posted picture of this recipe is extremely misleading - with all that soy sauce in this recipe, trust me, those green beans do not look like THIS recipe - unless the submitter forgot the soy sauce or chose not to use it.  These beans are an unattractive shade of greeny-brown.  And they basically taste like... green beans and soy sauce.  One of the rare occasions Hubs and I not only agreed on a review of a recipe, but we did so immediately, without hesitation.  The other issue is that there is no way you'd want to use the overload of sesame seeds called for.  I used fresh green beans which theoretically should have made these even better, but unfortunately this was a real miss for us.

Needs less oil, soy sauce and especially sesame seeds or more green beens and it will be great.  Good flavor.  Try mixing part sesame oil and part vegetable oil.

I had had something similar to this several years ago and have wanted to try it. The toasted sesame seeds at the end really are needed (not necessarily that much, but 2-3 tbsp). I also added sesame oil per some of the other suggestions, but it didn't have the sesame taste I wanted until I added the toasted seeds. 
Agree with previous comments, the soy causes the beans to brown a bit. I served it with Chinese Pork Chops and they paired nicely. 
Would make again.

I added a little sesame oil to finish along with a few tablespoons of broth.

These were very tasty and SO easy.  I just eyeballed all the proportions - used a little oil (1/2 vegetable and 1/2 sesame), a liberal amount of soy sauce, cooked as directed, and then sprinkled liberally with sesame seeds.  They were very popular and I will make them again with asian dishes.

Wow!!  This is a great recipe!  I added a clove of garlic finely chopped to the bread crumbs and Parmesan and I was delicious!  Will definitely make this again.

Excellent and really easy! I used fresh green beans and only used a few tablespoons of seeds and also added a little brown sugar to the soy sauce. Loved it!

This is the only way I can eat green beans. But love them like this.  I do use my wok so very little oil and add some garlic powder at the end.  YUM!
