hello. i'm the submitter of this recipe. i forgot to add an important side note to this recipe. if i have apple juice on hand, i'll use it in place of the water. i find that it adds another layer of flavour and sweetness to the apples.

REALLY awesome! I only had honeycrisp apples on hand and those worked beautifully. It IS a bit labor intensive, pressing the crust into all those little tins, but so worth it in the end.   Tip on making the crust easier - cube your cold butter up and put it in the freezer. Put all of the crust mixture except the oats into your food processor, then add the frozen butter. Pulse until resembles coarse crumbs. Transfer to a big bowl and then mix in the oats. MUCH faster than cutting it in and distributes beautifully.   I made these exactly as described but did add a little vanilla to the apples. Very delicious. Took longer than stated to cook, about 30 minutes. Ultimately I put the broiler on to brown the tops better. I will make these often in the fall. Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious! I have become a HUGE fan of these little treats. They are the perfect little dessert! I have made these many times since I discovered this recipe. The thing that makes it so perfect is that you can make the crisp part and the filling part ahead of time and refrigerate it.  Put together the cups and filling just before you need them. Bake them as directed. However, the *best* thing is that you can actually make them, bake them and then freeze them. They are actually *perfect* this way and taste exactly the same as freshly baked and cooled.  Pop them out on the counter just a little while before a party or guests coming. I keep them in the freezer now because you can actually defrost them in the microwave, too, in just a few seconds. They are great to have on hand. I do cut down on the butter by about 1/3, but other than that these are the absolutely perfect little treat.  Thanks, Weeble!

Excellent, Weeble; thanks!  Used apple cider in place of water.  Sliced butter and put in freezer for 20 minutes; placed all dough ingredients in food processor, zapped twice to distribute evenly, then added frozen butter and used one-minute pulses until pea sized.  Quartered dough, left 3 portions in fridge while working first batch.  GOOD IDEA:  I used pestle (from mortar and pestle set) to press dough neatly to fit mini tin muffin pan.  Am using leftover crust for toppings on any baked apples, pears, or other fruit.

This is a wonderful crisp recipe and a clever idea!  The recipe, followed as written, did give me some trouble though. I just could not get the crust to the proper consistency for pressing in the pans by hand, so I put it through my food processor and pulsed until it started to clump. If you don't have a processor, then I would recommend softening your butter to at least room temperature before cutting in. I might even try that next time, as it was a fiddle trying to get that much volume of crust through my processor (I did it in two batches ~ I also might reduce the crust mixture next time as I had one cup left over after the final topping). I ended up short of apple filling by one whole pan, so it might be helpful to know how many cups are needed for the recipe instead of number of apples. Chopped pecans would be a wonderful addition to the topping. Thank you for sharing the recipe with us.

I made these before they got published, so I thought I would transfer my review over : These are awesome Weeble! Let me start by saying I didn't quite follow the recipe. I halved it, thinking, I don't have that many pans. Not realizing it was mini muffins. So I made big ones! I am trying to use apples out of the freezer, so I had already cooked them in the microwave. I just add butter, sugar, brown sugar, apple pie spice, and cinnamon after draining some of the water off. That was when I remembered your recipe, so I used the crust part. I realized they were supposed to be mini's when I tried to take them out of the pan, LOL! That would work much better holding together, but I got them cooled enough, put a cookie sheet over the pan, flipped them out and they held together. Tastes so good!I'll do the mini crisps next time, I still have more apples! Thanks.

Sorry, the entire time I'm following the recipe I did't agree with two things. 1. the amount of butter is waaay to much. I didn't like the greasy feeling when eating them. 2. Cooking the apples prior to putting them in the oven, only makes the apples mushy. Even thought I disagreed with these steps, I made it as directed and disliked the outcome. If I remake these I will cut the butter in half and not cook the apples prior to putting them in the oven. Not my favorite

TASTY! I used a mix of granny smith,  honey crisp, and Jonathan apples. Just because I had them on hand. I found cutting in the butter was easier using two butter knives. I think I'll try a food processor next time to save time. I ran out of the apple mix after filling about 40. I filled the rest with some canned peaches and they were also very tasty. My 13yo daughter liked the ones filled with peaches better then the apple. So if you run out of the apple mix try the peaches or what ever else you might have in the cabinets. The cooking time was right on for me, about 18 min.

These are just the cutest, tastiest little things!  Keeping a mental note about having extra crust, I reduced the flour and oats to 1 1/2 cups, brown sugar to 1 cup and butter to 1 cup.  As it turned out, I only had enough apple mixture from 3 apples to fill 2 dozen mini-muffin tins and still had crust leftover (no worries - I'll keep it in the fridge and use to fill baked apples at some point).  These are adorable and delicious and easy - I was afraid they would stick to the pan, but no! No trouble at all removing them! They're wonderful - thanks weeble!

This is delicious. My amounts didn't quite add up to four dozen, just two, so I'm not sure what happened there. I topped this with a simple confection sugar glaze and it was perfect.

I used to work in the local apple orchard each summer and can't wait to try these. Just as a tip for others, I will use a shot glass to make quick work of the crusts. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were delicious!!! I used 6 apples macs and honey crisps. Macs by themselves cook down too much. I added about 1- 2 Tablespoons of flour to the apple mix as it was cooking so it would thicken and I had no problems with the mix being runny. Was too much like applesauce without the flour. I put them in a non stick mini muffin pan. Sprayed with pam. Which I had my doubts about doing since there is so much butter in the crust. I built up the edges of the cups. Don't do that. Keep edges and filling even to rim. Had no problems with the crust, did use a food processor to bring it all together. Some reviews said to flip out immediately, don't do that, I ended up with a terrible mess. So the next batch I didn't regrease the pan and when they came out I just slightly ran a knife along the edge and let them cool and they came out perfect!! Popped out easy. Very buttery and yummy. I think people had problems with them sticking because without the flour it was very runny and that juice probably leaked out. They have a wonderful crispy crust but after you freeze them the crust looses it crispiness but they are still delicious! I had no problems with sogginess either. These are a must try but remember to thicken your filling. Oh, I think I will try adding some lemon juice the next time and there will be a next time for sure!!!

Oh, yum!  Yes, they are a pain in the neck to form into the mini muffin tin, but SOOOO worth it!  I realized after I'd made them that I used 1/4 cup too little butter (I bought butter in bulk).  They worked out just fine once I got the hang of it.  I pressed 4 teaspoons of crust mixture into the bottom and then worked it up along the sides.  I found that the apple mixture was just right, but I only made about 40 of them.  On the second batch I thought I'd try drizzling a dab of Trader Joe's caramel sauce over the apple mixture, and that was very tasty, too.  I'll see what the consensus around here will be--with or without the caramel sauce.  To make a long story short, these are DELICIOUS!  Thanks, weeble!

These are really good but very time consuming even after I discovered a method for forming the crusts of the cups (I filled each muffin cup full of crumbs and pressed down in each cup with half of a metal tea ball and then patched the top edges as needed).  I've just made them for the second time and my back is sore from bending over the counter top for so long.  The first time I made them with apples as written and today made 4 types - peach, raspberry jam, nutella and peanut butter.  All were very good.  For the crust I used the food processor method, once using frozen butter, once using warm.  There was no difference in the texture of the crusts but the frozen butter ones came out of my pans easily.  Both times I sprayed the pans with Pam but with the soft butter more stuck and broke.  None broke today using frozen butter.  I did allow the pans to sit for 10 minutes after coming out of the oven before I tried to remove the cups from the pans.

I read through most of the reviews, did 1.5 of flour and oats and 1 cup butter, 5 med/lg granny smith apples. Juice not water, added a t. each vanilla and lemon juice. Made 1 dz mini and 1 dz cupcake size. Used the pestle method  for the mini, worked great.  I think I liked the bigger size better, more apple to crust ratio.

Oh my goodness...these are extremely yummy! Like others, I had a couple problems with the quantity of apples, however. I had one HUGE gala apple, and one large golden delicious apple; together, they were about the same amount as 3 large McIntosh apples would be. I ended up running out of apples, however...some of my last cups were really low on apple. As I only had one 24-cup mini muffin tin, I divided the oat dough up into 48 1" balls, and then used the rest for the topping. Because the leftover crumbs were so doughy, I added a tbs. or so of flour to the mixture to make it more crumbly. I was worried that the crisps wouldn't come out of the pan, and found that they come out really easily if they are still quite warm. Once the cups cooled almost to room temperature, they were quite difficult to get out. In spite of this, the finished cups were very well received...everyone who tried these cups loved them! Thanks for sharing this super creative and delicious recipe!

I used silicon mini cupcake molds and had to cook a bit longer - also used margarine instead of butter and they came out too doughy.

I needed a one-bite type dessert for a group function so I thought this recipe would be a good bet. I just found these to be much too labor intensive. While they were nice tasting overall, I thought the crust and topping overpowered the apple filling so that the filling could hardly be tasted. I will stay with my traditional way of making apple crisp and find a simpler one-bite treat next time.

I had some sticking with these and they were a little fussy to make but had great flavor.  I will grease my tins lightly next time.  They are dangerous little bites, you can eat 6 or 8 of them without realizing how much you've just eaten ;).

My 4 year old asked me to make these again yesterday which reminded me to review them.  These were great!  Easy to make too.  I had to use brown sugar with the apples instead of white because I was out of white and they were just fine.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I only made a half recipe and they were gone by the next afternoon.  One thing to mention is don't store them in a tupperware type container covered or they become soggy.  Great recipe and such a cute idea!

The Bunco ladies LOVED these.  I did mix the crust mixture in my food processor, adding the oatmeal last and only pulsing 2 times after adding the oatmeal.  These were kinds of putsy shaping the tartlets - but well worth it after all of the compliments.  I added a drizzle of caramel on top - which was a nice added touch.  Two people asked me to print out the recipe before leaving.  Will make again.  Thanks.

These are tasty and look impressive, too. It takes a bit of time to form the crusts so plan accordingly but they are worth the effort. Thanks, Weeble, these will be on my holiday "mini-pie and tassie plate".

although the idea of this recipe sounded delicious, when it was done, i was wishing i made a real apple crisp pie instead. there was just too much crisp on the bottom (my fault, i know) and not enough apples. plus, i didnt really like the taste of the crisp either. not really a fan of using oats in a crisp. gives it too much of an oatmeal taste to me.

These were fun to make with my girls.  We had an abundance of apples that needed using up so this was perfect.  They made the house smell so wonderful!  We made 4 batches.  The only addition was we added a bit of vanilla extract, or Amaretto or some Bourbon  to portions of each batch so we would have a variety.  We  surprised several of our neighbors with a tray.  Thanks for the recipe!  It made LOTS of people happy! Will make again!

Great recipe ~ perfect little bite size treats.  It is a little time consuming to make the cups, but well worth it in the end!

took these to an office party and they were a big hit..And few people ask for the recipe.one friend knew exactly where to look and how to get recipe lol because I told her they were apple crisp cups. And they all know I only make recipes from here and sure enough she came on here and found it. I told her I would have printed the the recipe for her :) I did go with another reviewer and make less of the crust. and I did add an extra apple. and still could have used a little more. It is labor intensive ,and what a mess I made trying to figure out how to neatly press that crust into the mini cups.I finally used the back of my TBSP measuring cup spoons and press dough down hard with that and it was rounded enough to work.Or if I had a pestle I would have used that.I will make these again.They are perfect for partys and grab and go treats .

A little bite of heaven! The texture is wonderful: crisp oatmeal cookie on the outside, soft apple pie on the inside! I used 4 smallish JonaMac apples and had just enough filling. My first batch into the oven, I skimped on the filling, and they were a little sunken-in when they came out of the oven. My 2nd batch, I patted the filling down and mounded the topping, and it came out level. Making the crusts is time consuming, so it's a good thing this makes 48 servings!  I am taking these for an after-game soccer team snack.  I foresee making these many times again: for potlucks, bake sales, cookie exchanges, yeah!  Thanks again, Weeble! P.S. Everyone loved these, and several moms asked for the recipe!

Enjoyed by all!  Used whole wheat pastry flour, and all brown sugar.  My kids took charge of patting the crust into the tin, and  heaped in the apple mixture for each one. We'll definitely make this again, as it's so easy for the kids to do.  Grease your tin well- the ones that did stick crumbled!

Why, oh why did I wait so long to try these?!?!   I've seen them bouncing around on the Exchange/Buzz for a couple months now, but never got around to giving them a try until this morning.  I wanted a special little treat to share with the few of my co-workers who decided not to take a four-day weekend (yesterday was a holiday for us) and decided to make these. Holy cow, are they ever good!!  I cut the recipe in half and used two medium-sized Gala apples, which was the perfect amount of apple for 24 mini-cups.  The best part about these little gems is that I always have all of the ingredients on hand, so I can whip out a batch of them whenever I want.  The assembly is a little time consuming, but not too bad.  I was able to get these prepped, assembled, and baked in less than an hour total.  I removed them from the mini muffin tin by putting my cutting board over top of it and then flipping the whole thing over.  They popped right out and held their shape nicely, even though I had to take them out of the pan before they were really cool enough.  My co-workers are enjoying them immensely and have already asked if I'll bring these for our Thanksgiving potluck next week!  Thanks for a great, simple treat, weeble!

Love these tiny apple crisp cups - they smelled heavenly while baking and that yummy, buttery flavor is divine. I chopped my apples, added the spices; but instead of water, I used apple juice. I sprinkled about a teaspoon of corn starch into this mixture, stirred and microwaved for about two minutes. Before making the crust in my food processor, I sprayed my mini-muffin tins with canola oil because they are not non-stick. Using my smallest cookie scoop, I placed one scoop into each muffin cup and formed the crust. I added about a teaspoonful of the cooled apple filling to each crust and added a small caramel bit on the top before baking for 25 minutes. After allowing the muffin tins to cool to the touch, I took a small sharp blade, inserted along the edge and the cups popped right out.  First time, I have ever made a recipe and actually WANTED one to tear up so I could eat it :) I added a small piece of cheddar cheese to the top of each before serving.  Yummy 5 star recipe. Thank you Weeble for sharing your recipe with us. It is a definite keeper for me.

I did not like these. There was too much crust and topping compared to the ratio of apples. I was very disapointed by this recipe.

Not too shabby!  The ratios seemed a bit heavy on the "crisp" and low on the apples, but they turned out tasty.  Next time I might increase the amount of apples.

Very good! Only used 2 sticks butter. Added a few tablespoons apple sauce to apple mixture after warming apples. Also added 4 Kraft caramel bits to each muffin tin. Made some mini, made some regular muffin size.  Perfect!!!

I made these to take to a potluck at the offices. I brought them in on two trays, one at a time. By the time I got back with the second tray they were waiting for me at the elevator door.  I made enough for everyone to have two, half the office didn't get any and the other half got more than there fair share.  My boss ask me to bring more in on Monday, but to bring therm to his office so his can keep track of who got what. He didn't get any the first time.  I gave out 19 copies of this recipe.

Made these for an autumn-themed ladies meeting at my church.  Very tasty!  The spices and apples mix well together.  After they cooled a bit, I flicked them with a glaze from the Glazed Apple Cream Pie recipe (also found on AR).  I actually had some apple filling left over when I ran out of the oatmeal mixture (after making 32 servings).  My only regret is that I did not double the recipe to freeze some for future use.  They were perfect for a fall evening.

I cannot really review these accuratly as I didn't follow the recipe and they didn't come out so good. Tatested amazing but the consistancy was all off (my fault for not following the recipe). I decided to melt the butter to make it easier to mix, DO NOT do this! I also cut my apples too big, if you are using the mini muffin tins cut them pretty small. My tins overflowed (again my fault) and burned all over the bottom of the oven. Very delish and I'll try again but will do it right!

These were good, but since I didn't have enough muffin pans to follow the directions I ended up putting the rest of the batter in a small dish. It tasted good but was very crumbly.

Great little apple pies. I made these gluten free by substituting the all-purpose flour with Bob's Red Mill all-purpose GF flour and they turned out delicious.

These are sooo cute and sooo delish!  I used the food processor method for the crust.

I have to say I ended up with more crust than needed.  The cups came out beautifully, and it was a hit when I brought it to our party.  

Thank you weeble!

I made these with a few minor adjustments. I don't have a mini muffin pan so I used a regular size muffin pan. It made about 14 muffins. I also cheated and used canned apple pie filling. They were very good and my family loved them. I just thought 3 stks of butter is a bit much. I don't think the taste out weighed the calories.

It was almost impossible to form a bottom crust in the mini muffin cups though I gave up after one tray. Quite a mess -  The flavor was good, but concept wast not. Three apples was not enough filling and if any of the apple filling cooked out, it made them difficult to remove from the muffin cups.  I'll be making regular fruit crisp with the remainder.

I enjoyed these - I used only 1 cup of butter, subbed honey for sugar with the apples, used whole wheat pastry flour and cut the sugar back in the crisp part to 1 1/3.  Next time I'll cut the sugar WAY back and try some honey.  I will also use the food processor to cut in the butter as some others have recommended - I had already added the oats before I realized what a hassle that was going to be.  I was a little worried about how these were going to come out of the pan, but they popped out easily and stayed in one piece - and I just greased with a little olive oil.

These were pretty labor intensive for a "just okay" dessert.  They are definitely better warm.  Once they cool they aren't so great.  I had a lot of crust mixture leftover, even after making a second batch of the filling.

First of all, I cheated this recipe because i had a can of apple pie filling (chopped) i needed to clean out of the cabinet.  I used the big can (about 17oz) for 2 dozen of these.  I took some of the suggestions, and used softened butter in the flour/oat shell.  This was great, except that I ended up needing to make another 1/4 recipe of the topping to have any to cover the filling.  I used exactly 1 T of crust per tart, 1 tsp of chopped up apple pie filling, and then about 1 tsp of filling on top of that.  I cooked mine for about 18 min, but they really needed a few extra min because they weren't quite as crispy as I'd hoped.  These were cute, great reheated or not, and my mom at a bunch topped with vanilla ice cream.  This is a cute and delicious recipe!

My husband liked them, but I thought they were kind of boring.  Might be better with some glaze drizzled on top.

These little treats are quite tasty, but a little time consuming as other have stated.  Cutting the butter into the dry ingredients was the most difficult part for me.  I also only had enough apples to make about 24, so next time I will increase the amount of apples I use from 3 to 5 or 6.  A great little dessert, but not for those who want something quick and easy.

I followed the instructions, but the apple filling made the bottom of the cups completely soggy, and they fell apart as I removed them from the muffin tins. Not sure what I could have done differently. The taste was pretty good, but there is no way I could have served them to anyone.

I don`t know,maybe i`ll be the only one given this a bad review but for all the hard work it takes to make these,their not worth it.I`ve done other desserts that didn`t take as long and came out waaaaay betterI`m glad it didn`t ask for expensive ingredients or I would be upset.One more thing, I`m not a novice baker I know about baking and cooking, this won`t stay in my recipe box.

This had to be the best apple crisp I have ever had!  I love the idea of making them bite size, because you get all the crunchy goodness of the crisp topping.  The only thing is it was very time consuming, but oh so worth it.  I made them in mini and regular size muffin pans and both were equally good.  I did have to chop up and cook more apples, but I'm sure it's because of the varying sizes of apples.  Thanks weeble for sharing this recipe that is a definite keeper.

These little gems are delicious!…I used apple juice in place of the water which was a valuable suggestion from the recipe submitter…thank you weeble!  Knowing that my family likes a stronger flavour of cinnamon and nutmeg I added extra… I really wish I had made more because I think they would be great to have on hand in the freezer…they don't last long if left in sight…

Loved this! Here are the changes I made based on personal preference: I don't like really sweet desserts so I added a little less sugar. I also followed other reviewers advice and reduced the amount of crust, using only 1.5 cups of flower & oats, etc., and 1/2 the amount of butter. I found I didn't have quite enough crust so I'll adjust next time. I loved the suggestion about cutting the butter in pieces, freezing it, and then "cutting it" in a blender (before oats). Worked like a charm and saved lots of time and arm work.

For posters who said their apples were too mushy when they cooked them beforehand, keep in mind this all depends on the type of apple you use. I used firm apples meant for baking.

Delicious!  I can't wait to try this with fresh peaches or blueberries.  I made larger mini-pies, using standard muffin tins.  Took about 22-24 minutes to bake.  Let them cool completely before removing them from the tin, or they could  break.

Sweet, delicious, crumbly topping as the vessel for sweet apple filling? Mmmm Easy to eat as they are pop-able or a two biter. It's all crisp and apples with no crust. Used my pestle, floured, to help make the holes in the crust mixture. Worked beautifully. I have a non-stick mini muffin pan so getting them out of the pan was easy with the careful help of my paring knife. They freeze well, if you have any leftover. Great for church fellowship.

These are so time consuming and about the same in flavor as any other apple crisp.  I like the idea of tiny finger type treats like this but the crust part was so hard to form in the pan I'm not so sure it's worth it.  I did as others suggested and used a food processer to mix the flour, sugar, cinn, nutmeg and butter together before adding the oats- much easier!  They were good- probably better with a little powdered sugar drizzle over the top.  Maybe my family is just too into chocolate to really love these.  I suppose I will only make them again if we have guests that LOVE apple crisp and then I will probably try to make them in regular size muffin pans to save time.

I started making them cupcake size and using a shot glass to hollow out the middle. It definitely makes them a bit less labor intensive.

We love apple crisp at our house so when I saw this recipe I was excited to try it.  I only ended up with 3 dozen cups and quite a bit of apples left over but I did use 4 medium apples (guess I only needed 4).  I only have 2 mini muffin pans so on the last batch I put a tiny bit of caramel (the ice cream topping kind that comes in a squeezable bottle) over the apples underneath the topping.  Very yummy but very good just as the recipe is as well.

One reviewer used peaches. I haven't tried that yet but I think you could also use the chunky style applesauce for filling or maybe canned pears with cinnamon or nutmeg added to give more flavor.

***Update***

My original post was written right after I made these but, now a few days later let me just say that these are DELICIOUS! Rewarmed in the microwave, these little crisps are like heaven! They are beyond addicting, especially at just over 100 calories per cup :) Highly recommended!!

*Original post***
This is delicious! Just like little apple pies. The next time, I would leave the oats out as they didnt add anything to the recipe. I only used 1 cup of butter and mixed the crumbs by hand. I actually softened the butter in the microwave, this helped the crumbs to form better (or so I thought.) These are a great low calorie filling dessert!

I made this for first time today! My husband LOVED this! His friend always made it for him for his birthday before we got married and even after that. It is bit different compare to the other one but it was still GOOD!  I didn't put whip cream in between cream cheese filling and chocolate pudding. But it turned out fine. My layer was like: Walnuts crust, cream cheese filling, chocolate pudding, vanilla pudding, and whip cream. It was just fine. I also made it in 9×9 pan as others were suggesting. I am going to make this again, that's for sure!!!

These were great. I used 6 medium/small apples, 2 granny smith, 2 gala and 1 golden delicious. I think the variety added to the flavor. I cooked the apples with brown sugar instead of white and added some nutmeg and ginger to them. Pressing the crust into the muffin cups took a lot of time so I will probably only make these on special occasions. Also they are very buttery so I might try reducing the butter a little next time.

Loved the concept.  I used my own apple crisp recipe.  No need to grease the cups- very labor intensive though.  They were a big hit but it sure is easier to just make one big one!

don't use water use apple juice
cut the butter in half and not cook the apples prior to putting them in the oven.

This recipe needed four to five apples to fill the cups full.

These were delicious! I used Granny Smith apples and topped them with a caramel drizzle to jazz them up a bit.  I did substitute apple juice for the water and the apples turned out great!

These were fabulous! Will be high on my list for pot-lucks and for impressing guests. I used Winesap apples since I had them on hand.

Easy to make, too. I did use my food processor to mix the dough, but mostly because of the oats. I also used the little tamping tool from Pampered Chef to fill & shape the cups, and the Pampered Chef apple peeler/corer/slicer to cut the apples. Everything went super-fast that way. It's all about having the right tools, whether PC or not.

I agree that measurements (i.e., 2 cups vs 3 large apples) would be helpful. I had so much dough left that I cooked up another half batch of filling. (I made the last batch is full-size muffin pans, just going up about half way, they are fabulous too.)

Learn from my mistake... it says 'grease the pans'... do it! I figured with all that butter it probably wasn't necessary. Decided to grease one of them as an experiment. Made a big difference in being able to get my treats out of the cups easily. (I chilled them and got all but a few out perfectly, just carefully.)

Oh, and in response to the negative reviewer who said there was too much butter... nope, not at all (perhaps operator error or she cheaped-out and used margarine). That is the same ratio of fat-to-flour as a traditional pie crust.

Tastes amazing. I would not grease the pan like the recipe states. Next time I will use less butter, it was a little too greasy. I used honey crisp apples and one cortland.

I just made these for a fall fundraiser and I'm in love!  I didn't have mini muffin tins so this made 24 using regular muffin tins.  I used Cortland apples and used the optional nutmeg with a bit more of the "to taste" of cinnamon in the apple mixture.  Make sure you cool before removing from the tin with a knife, but they are absolutely amazing while still warm.  SCRUMPTIOUS!

I made these tasty little treats to send to a tennis end of season potluck supper. I also sent a plate of store bought mini coffee cakes. There were mini coffee cakes leftovers but no apple crisp cups . This year the apple crop in the area where I live was badly damaged by a very early unusual warm spell followed by frost. Macintosh apples are in short supply so I used Granny Smith apples. I halved the recipe to 24. This recipe is best made when you are not in a hurry as forming the cups is time consuming but so worth the effort. I did use my pestle to aid in forming the cups as was suggested by another reviewer. After baking, I cooled them in the pans on a rack for 10 minutes then removed them easily. I taste tested one to see how they turned out. MMMMM!  Just what the title says, a bite sized apple crisp.They are perfect for a bake sale, potluck or part of a dessert tray.

This was really good! I made 12 cups, but ran out of time and threw the rest in a cake pan. The kids loved the cups to bring to school for snack, and we ate the "big" one for dessert. Not super sweet. whole family loved it!

These taste amazing.  I was asked to make these for a wedding and they were the first to go.  I suggest using more apples for the filling part so you don't feel like you're being skimpy with the filling.  They are very easy to make but do take some patience as you have to smash the crisp part into the pan.  Make sure they are pretty solid but not too solid or they won't come out easy.  If you are having problems getting them out of the  pan, freezing them and taking a knife once they're frozen helped a lot.

These are delicious! I squeezed some fresh lemon juice over the apples as I peeled and sliced them so they wouldn't turn brown. I used my Niece's organic juice instead of water. I was out of Nutmeg so I used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead.

These were good, but not worth the effort of stuffing the filling into the muffin tins. Its easier to just make an apple crisp. I thought these would be good for a bake sale, but they take a long time to make.

We liked these.  They come out crispy but then the crust gets soft and mushy.  I kept them in the frig.

Very good idea the kids loved the single serving apple crisp.  I might play with some flavors a bit next time and add a little more apple to each cup next time.  But a very good concept and basic recipe!

Great, but it really needs to say "MINI MUFFINS" or "MINI MUFFIN TRAY" somewhere in big letters.  I know I should have skimmed the reviews, but I didn't this time.  They did hold together but were a bit bizarre at the size of normal muffins.

Tasty, but the crumb to filling ratio needs to be adjusted. Apple crisp is supposed to be about the soft, but crisp apples underneath. No worries though, these were cobbled up quite quick. Instead of just cinnamon and nutmeg, I used a personal recipe for pumpkin pie spice for the amounts listed. I made these in a regular muffin tin (12 cups) and baked 30-40 minutes.

This was a truly wonderful recipe! I had everything on hand and the little cups came out perfect. I'm not a very advanced baker but the finished product made me feel like this is something I could bring to any public event and be proud of! The only thing I changed was a little lemon juice in with the apples and I doubled the amound of apples. I can see myself making this over and over again for friends and family.

This dessert turned out pretty good!  I did double the filling as per previous reviewers and ended up making 5 dozen of these apple crisp cups!  I used a mixture of Jonagold and granny smith.  My taste testers really enjoyed trying it!

Awesomw little things and easy. I suggest making more filling. I felt like I was measuring it out too much and actually made about half more of it. They turned out great and I guess that kept me from putting in too much filling. Everyone loved them.

Great flavor and presentation. These were perfect for a Halloween gathering with friends. I had some difficulty getting them out of the muffin pan, despite spraying it well with Pam and letting them cool/set for 5-7 minutes in the pan. Some of them broke halfway down. Stomach didn't mind though!

This was a great petite dessert!  I used 3 golden delicious apples, and followed the directions as written.   They were a hit at the coffee I served them at, and I was asked for recipe.  Don't let others use of the word "time consuming" stop you from making these; they are worth the little bit of extra time it takes to make them.

Very tasty but also very time consuming.  I made them for a party and it worked out great.  My only issue was that the crust fell apart as I tried to get them out of the cups.  They still tasted great.  I used 3 large mcintosh apples and got exactly 48 servings.  For those people who said they didn't have enough filling, maybe your apples were a bit smaller?  I would definitely make them again.

Great recipe - absolutely delicious.  I used Weeble's advice and used apple juice in place of water; I used 2 Granny Smith and 1 Honeycrisp; remember to chop apples fairly small.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!! A bit of work but well worth the effort. I've read that some people have had an issue with the crust not sticking to the muffin tin. I let the butter come to room temperature, made it easier to mix. Then I used the bottom of a shot glass to press the crust into the tin. Also...I won $50.00 at work for having the best recipe at our Halloween potluck!!

This was the perfect use of fresh apples from apple picking. I made them into regular sized muffins, doubling the ingredients and added some apple cider in place of the water. They were a REAL Fall treat. I also had to lightly broil the tops to a crisp brown, but otherwise a great recipe!

This is such a great idea!  It also was a huge success at our church's fall bazaar.  I made 6 batches, 3 of the minis and 3 using full size muffin pans.  We sold the minis for $1 ea and the muffins for $3 each. Wonderful Weeble, thanks for sharing.

These are great!  I subsituted 1Tbsp Splenda for the sugar in the apples.  And I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend for the brown sugar in the crust.  Mine didn't crisp up but maybe they needed to be baked a little longer.  I think next time I will just press the oatmeal mixture into a pan.  I've been looking for an apple crisp recipe that I could adapt for us  Bariatric patients, and I think I found it!  Thanks!

I followed other suggestions and used 1 1/2 cups flour and oats. 1 cup butter and brown sugar as well as about a tbsp of flour in the apple mixture to thicken the sauce. I chopped approx. 4 cups of apple and found the recipe made 48 mini muffin sized tarts. Awesome recipe, just the right sweetness.

This was a great recipe especially for sharing.  Next time I'd reduce the sugar a little.  I added a little flour to the apples so they were not runny, as per reviewer suggestion.  I thought these were delicious.  They are a bit of work but really worth it.  I'd make sure you use tart apples for the best flavour contrast.  This is a hit.
I also tried it in a regular muffin pan. It takes 10 minutes longer and I liked the extra amount of apples. Either way it is great.

I used 4 honeycrisp apples, spritzed them with lemon juice and cut back on brown sugar by approx 1/4 c. I made these tarts using gluten free all purpose flour but forgot to add the xantham gum that is necessary when using gf flour,the first batch of 24 were difficult to remove(crumbly) so I froze them and that sure helped. To the remaining crumble mix I added approx 2-3 tsps of egg white and the resulting tarts were easily popped out without crumbling.I look forward to serving these gluten free goodies at my Easter dinner this coming weekend :)

I made a half batch using a gluten free brown rice flour blend and gluten free oats. I think these came out great! I did not find them to be very difficult to make or labor intensive. The first few fell apart when I took them out but that is because I am impatient and they were too hot. Spray the pan well, let them cool a bit and they come out of the pan easily. Also, I used a wooden tamper which fits just inside the mini cups. This allows you to press the crust firmly. Very nice treat!

Absolutely amazing! Time consuming and a tad tedious. I made the crust and filling first day and assembled the next. I used 4 large macintosh apples to be sure I had enough, my tablespoon is totally round so filled muffin tins via that and my melon baller to fill them. I used up all the ingredients to make 48.
Apparently they didn't stand a chance once container was open. Thanks!

These are so good! Took them to the office for Halloween today. 
I thought they were a little difficult to "cut in the butter". I do not have a pastry cutter (never heard of it) nor a food processor. So pressing the crust into the tin was difficult, powdery. I was going to give up, but when the first batch came out, it was scrumptious! So I was determined to make it work. What I did was melt about 1/4c of butter and poured it in the crusty mix, that made it more moldable. 
These are fantastic and I will make them again.

I made them using a normal size muffin tin, baked for 30 minutes. They were deliciously cinnamony and crunchy! I added a little caramel on top, that gave a really nice finishing touch to the flavors.

I was looking for a "one bite" recipe that would use up some of my apples.  This recipe was a lot of work for an average desert.  The cups also got soggy after a day or two.

This recipe is great!  Everyone who has had them has absolutely loved them.  We ended up using all the required apples for only 24, so we had to make another batch of the apple filling, but it was good.  Definitely time consuming cutting in the butter and filling the mini muffin tins, but totally love it.  Will make this recipe again!!

Labor intensive? Yes. I didn't have mini-muffin cups, so I used 3 apples, and the topping for 36 mini-apple cups. I ran out of apples, and just made 12 regular cupcake-sized treats. I am thankful for the person who said to use cold butter in the food processor, as without that, I'd still be in the kitchen. I have a mini-processor, and used it in batches, but it WORKED! When it came out of the oven, I have to actually take my muffin tin and refrigerate it, to allow the cups to be removed. But they are YUMMY! Wow, if you have someone to impress, do these. Just keep them cold, or they'll fall apart (or maybe my crust wasn't thick enough, I do have extra leftover that I'll use in a crisp the next time I make fix apples. Would be a great treat to make with kids, so they can help with the work!!

These were time consuming and exhausting and worth every second once I tasted them.

There is a little tool you can buy from pampered chef to form the little crusts - I RECOMMEND THAT!

Also - LEAVE THE SKIN ON THE APPLE!!! BEST PART!!

These were really good but thought it had too much oatmeal.  Halved the recipe (dozen of mini's, 6 regular size muffins, crust filled half way) and added vanilla extract.  I wished I had read the reviews about using the food processor first because i had a difficult time pressing it together even when using my tart tamper.  Served it with whip cream...yum!

I was really craving sweets and didnt have much on hand. I found a can of apple pie filling and used this crust recipe to make the cups! It worked out great. the first half of the batch I did normal and the second half I actually added some peanut butter to the crust mixture because I wasnt sure how it would turn out. It was actually amazing and definitely worth a try!! :)

They came out well enough, but packing the crust mix into the little cups is extremely time consuming.  Also, I think I prefer there to be more filling than crust in my apple crisp, which doesn't lend itself well to finger food.

I made these for a funeral potluck.  They are great individual servings.  They taste pretty good.  I would suggest serving them warm.  The only thing is they are a tiny bit dry and could be a little sweeter.  Otherwise, a great recipe.

Although this recipe looks delicious (and it truly is!), you had best make sure you thoroughly grease your muffin pan. And I mean, coat it until it drips. Otherwise, there's no chance of the cups coming out of the tin easily.  I made them in regular muffin size tins, and as per a previous comment, flipped the pan upside down as soon as it came out of the oven. I beat on the bottom of each tin to encourage the cups to fall, then let them sit to cool. 10 minutes later, I raised the pan. 5 were out of the tin, and the other half either remained in the pan, or broke in the middle.  I believe next time I will coat the pan in oil, and not invert the pan as I found that a spoon would easily pop them out when they were cool. These two complaints aside, the cups had an excellent flavor and texture. I will definately attempt them again.

Very tasty.  I cut the butter down to 1 1/4 c.  The next time I'll probably cut it all the way down to 1 c.  Even with the decreased amount, they still held together very well but were almost a little greasy.  I increased the apple mixture since there were complaints about the crust to apple ratio.  I used two large granny smiths and three small gala.  I would definitley make these again, but would allow more time for preparation.  The process of forming the crust into the cups was surprisingly tedious.

These are great! Rave reviews and recipe requests when I took them to a potluck at work. They are a little time consuming but worth it. I went online the next day to buy a "mini tart shaper" from The Pampered Chef. Can't wait to get it so I can try this again.

This was awesome!  My husband said it might even be his most favorite dessert I have made so far! Would make an excellent dessert to pass.  Its perfect portions and wow... just awesome.  I didnt change anything. (my apples were a little on the small side so I didnt end up with enough apple mixture to fill all 4 dozen, but I had plenty of crust mixture to refrigerated and make more later!)

Great recipe! I used regular tins and it works fine. I also substituted whole wheat flour and baked for 30 mins. Top with chocolate ice cream or fruit puree...so good!

Very cute idea and delicious!  I baked mine for 20 minutes and they actually came out of the pan very easily!  Takes a long time to make, but totally worth it for a special occasion.

Very good recipe - a little labor intensive but pretty worthwhile.  I wish they had stayed 'crisp' after being stored overnight. Everyone at work loved them.

3,5 stars. I use Xylitol, a natural sugar substitute made out of birch or corn,  in all my baking.  It's a little expensive, but bakes really well and has 0 aftertaste (or any weird taste, for that matter). The only thing that might make this recipe not very suitable for it, Xylitol needs a little extra liquid usually, and this dough doesn't have any.  It still came out pretty good, but the dough was very hard to press into tins evenly, so I feel like there's way too much dough on the buttom of the cup, when I taste it, and not enough apples.  In fact, I just ate my second one, and had to leave some of the crisp uneaten.  You think I can add some sour cream or an egg, to make the dough less "sandy" and easier to work with?  I think I would have liked it a lot more if the crisp part was much thinner.  I only had regular muffin tins, so I lined them with paper cupcake liners, sprayed with oil.  Was enough for exactly 18 regular size cups.  Again, the taste is good, but it's a little too dry for me, and the proportions of dough to apples were a little off, IMHO.  It's also fairly labor intensive.  I would appreciate any suggestions, as I'd like to give it another shot.

Great, but are a lot of work and need a lot more spice and vanilla to really make them tasty. I also only added about 1-1 1/4 cups butter to make a good crust.

I seem to be the only one, so clearly I did something wrong, but most of mine stuck to the pan.  The ones that did come out were pretty good, but all in all it was a lot of work and I lost most of them to the pan.

Wow, these are great.  Just took them out of the oven.  Only made one mini pan full. Had a little crust left so I patted it down in a 8 x 8 pan, saving a small amount for the topping.  Then put the left over apples on top and crumbled the last bit of topping on top.  Baked it about 25 minutes.  The ONLY thing that could possibly make these better would be chopped pecans.

I followed the recipe using apple juice in place of water per the original posters suggestion & using 4 honey crisp apples. While the process was a bit labor intensive, the results were rewarding. I made these for a group and they flew off the platters with folks “sneaking” back for a second & third treat.

After baking and cooling, I stored them in a zip lock container only to find that they turned to mush.  The flavor is really good but the crust turned soggy, necessitating a fork to eat them.

Way too much butter. Followed Recipe to a “T” aside from putting them in liners, and they turned out wayyy too buttery. I had a feeling when making the “crumble” that it was too mushy rather than crumbly like other recipes I’ve used.. should have followed that instinct. I have butter pooled in my in my tins (that seeped through the liners LOL) and on my counter from just setting them on it.  Apples were delicious though. A little more spice might be nice

I use real butter for cooking & baking. But 1 cup of butter  ruins it for less it upsets my stomach. I will make it again sometime but use some coconut oil instead.  I made these also larger with a grande muffin tin instead of the mini. Worked out, but as I said I will modify recipe mix and let you know how that worked out.

What a pain in the behind.  I tried to form the cups and simply gave up.  There just is not enough substance to the crumb mixture to actually work up the sides...it would not hold together.  And even when I was able to cobble a couple together, the bottoms looked either so thick that there was not much room for the filing, or so thin that I was afraid they might leak.  I ended up using the filling and the crumb mixture to make a standard apple crisp in a Pyrex dish...it's in the oven right now.  And I want to know where those pics of the finished product came from.  Those must have been the best few out of the entire batch.  If I tried to make these again, I might set up a test row of muffin cups with different measured quantities of the crumb mixture, and then nest another muffin pan into them to see which quantity would best form cups that way.   Then I might be able to batch-create the cups...maybe.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written.  I was disappointed that the cup did not crisp up. In the future I would pre bake the cup then add the filling and bake for additional time. The bottom of the cup wasn't cooked and was gooey like oatmeal. The taste was great though so that's why I'm giving it the three stars.

Too much work and they became soggy after putting them in a covered dish, then fell apart when you tried to eat them. They're cute but apple crisp would have been just as good and much easier to make

I’m torn about this recipe. I like the concept. But I think the ratios are off. What you’re essentially making if you measure out the ingredients as is, is a crumb coating. One that you would typically use on the crisp or coffee cake. Using it as a base makes for a very soft bottom and less you overbake it so that you can force it to become hard. I made a double batch and did half of it in many cups as stated then decided it was not worth it for the effort and the taste so just turned it in to a crisp.

These are awesome!  These are easy to make, the temperature and time stated in the recipe was accurate and worked well for me.  After reading some other reviews I doubled the amount of apples I used.  I was careful not to overcook the apples and turn it into applesauce.  Other than that I kept everything the same and they turned out fantastic.  I will definitely make these again, in fact I am going to use up some pears that are hanging around.  I wasn't sure if I should grease the pans ultimately I didn't as the recipe didn't say to do so.  I had no problems nothing stuck .  While they were warm I topped a couple with a dollop of fresh whipped cream-yum!

While I mostly followed this recipe, I used regular size muffin cups (silicone worked great!) because it was just too putsy to do the mini size.  Our whole family really liked these (we each ate 2), but I did use only 1 cup of butter.  I would like to make them again, but considering the time it took, I'm not sure this will be something I will make often.  Perhaps once a year in the fall as a special breakfast treat!

The levels are way off on this recipe. There was enough filling for 1/4 the number of cups it claimed to make.

Delicious! Like a chewy crispy oatmeal cookie with apple pie filling. Added a little pinch of cloves.

I wanted a little bit sweeter after the first two batches, I added a 1/4 cup extra brown sugar, a tps of lemon zest for brightness, and doubled the cinnamon,and added a 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt, to adjust to my personal taste, I thought it was an improvement although it was great before

It fell apart often and the ratio of the "filling to the oats and flour mix was wrong. I had to make extra apple mixture in order to get the ratio right. However, afterwards, it tasted very good.

These are so good.  Being lazy, I use pie filling instead of fresh apples, but it works.  I've made them with apple pie filling, cherry pie filling, and today, with a frozen triple berry blend that I just sprinkled with some sugar a few hours in advance of filling the shells.  It is a challenge to get them out of the pan without destroying them, but I've found that cooling them a bit then using a plastic spoon is the answer.

These were a big hit at a party I brought them to.  Having an apple crisp where you don't need a fork to eat it is awesome.  But, they are very greasy and gave me a bit of oil belly.  I suggest cutting the amount of fat by half.  If making again, I will use just over 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup coconut oil.  I also used whatever apples were on sale since once you cook them, they all taste about the same.

This is a great little treat except for a couple things! Oat mixture was double what was needed, half of that will get you about 32 treats. Second, use room temp butter or slightly melted,  I had the hardest time forming the cups with the dry oat crust mix, I ended up warming it up in a small bowl as I needed it, it was MUCH easier to form the cups inside the muffin tins this way, the oat mix doesn't go quite as far once the butter has melted but wow was it easy to form. I used the end of an ice cream scoop. Other than that, great little recipe.

I used previous advice and used 1.5 c flour and 1.5 c. oats and 1 c butter.  For the water, I used 2T melted apple juice and 2T brandy.   The baked bottoms were still a bit oily.   I added 1 t vanilla and 1 T flour to the apples.   Took a bit longer baking to brown.  Good flavor.  Like that the leftovers can be frozen.  Was disappointed they got a bit soft overnight in plastic ware (should I have used something else?) but still tasted good.  Will try adding pecans next time.

I made these in regular muffin tins for a potluck - what an incredible feat!! The base was really hard to work with in the bigger tin, and once they were baked I was worried they wouldn't hold their shape - but once they cooled they were fine. Definitely not the last time I'll be making these!

I like the recipe and the taste a lot, but it is really hard to keep these together.  I might be doing something wrong, but the  picture makes them look like they are typical muffins and they are not.  Could be too much apple filling in the middle, but a lot of mine fell apart even after they were cooled!

My new go-to dessert contribution. Have brought it to two events, and both times guests raved about them. I suggest less or no nutmeg -- too strong. Otherwise, fantastic!

These are great. I don't change anything except I use whatever apples I have on hand. My only complaint is that it is not a quick and easy dessert. This recipe does take a long time to prep and make. But my family's only complaint is that there is never enough and they wish I would make more!

loved this recipe! Everyone love them! I will make them again every holiday (everyone asked me to). They might become a staple in my house. Their is way too much extra crust, though. I next time I will double the filling. Now we're going to make cookies out of the extra curst.

I used the frozen butter method but I think cold butter would have been OK also. Half way through making the cups I discovered that if I put a tablespoon of the mix in my hand (warmed the butter) and made balls. I placed them in the pan and put a pestle in the center and rotated to make the shells. This made it go faster. They need 25-30 min to brown and released from the pan without breaking. The shorter timed ones broke. Also I tried with and without Pam. With all the butter I felt Pam was not needed.

This was a huge hit! I doubled the recipe and made some adjustments to make it GF and dairy free. I used 1 cup tapioca starch, 3  1/3 c gluten free oat flour, and 2/3 of a generic Gluten free flour mix.  I replaced the butter 2 1/2c with coconut oil, and used soft baking apples a friend had given me from her tree.  I also took the recipe originators advice and used apple juice in place of water. It was a massive success.  Only crumbs left!

I started out using a shot glass, as suggested by another reviewer, but found that it was easier to use my hands to press the crust into the mini cups.   I needed to double the apple filling recipe in order to have enough for all the crust.   Made the crust in the food processor, adding the oatmeal at the end.   I did spray the muffin tins with no stick spray and they were very easy to remove and held their shape well.   Very tasty little bites and I always have all the ingredients for these on hand.

I made these but used big muffin pans! Made 12 big cups.  Used up all of the crust recipe so had to make a little extra for the top. Also used apple juice instead of water and had to double the baking time! Yum!

I omitted the white sugar because I didn't see the point in using apples, apple juice, and sugar. I also cut the brown sugar back by 1/2 cup. I am glad I did. I want to taste the sweetness of the apples, not sugar. One mistake I made was to leave the skins on for color. It wasn't horrible, but I will peel them next time. Great recipe!

Made these today for the first time. Love this recipe, thank you!! 

I didn't have rolled oats on hand, but had Better Oats cinnamon roll oatmeal. I removed the sugar chunks/sifted and used that instead. 

Cooked 30-35 minutes. 

So good!!! Thanks for posting

Made these for a fall dessert and served with frozen yogurt. They were good, but a little too sweet for our tastes. I prefer the ratio of apples to crust that you get in a more traditional crisp, but would make these again as part of a selection for a fall dessert tray. Thanks!

These were delish! Everyone loved them, they just take a LONG time pressing the crust down into each muffin mold.

I thought these were a pretty cute and nifty idea, but I modified a lot of it. First off, I used only 1/2 cup of butter because I thought that 1 1/2 was a little excessive. I also added a sprinkle of clove to my apples which turned out really great. Then I added vanilla into my crust and right before I put them into the tins I mixed in about an eighth of a cup of honey. I also used about half as much sugar as called and they seemed perfectly sweet. Really nice portable version of apple crisp.
