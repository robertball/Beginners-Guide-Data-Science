This recipe was absolutely delish!!  I made it for Valentine's supper tonight and it went over fabulously well with my significant other. :-)  I made the recipe exactly as written like I aways do the first time and even though we both enjoyed this creole, I would do a couple of things different in the future.  Firstly, the amount of hot pepper sauce was just a little bit too much heat for me...so would go down to a quarter teaspoon and put the tabasco bottle of the table for others who may need more.  Then I would add at least another times as much peeled and chopped tomato, as I didn't really think there was enough.  And finally, the sauce would have been better thickened up at the end with a bit of cornstarch and water.  But honestly...it really was great just the way it turned out tonight even all of that said.  I recommend trying it!!

Grat flavor!  Following some of the other suggestions, I made 1/2 recipe for most of the ingredients, but didn't half the tomato or spices.  We like spicy, and would rate this spice 2/5 (doubling the spices). I did not use a thickener (forgot) but was fine without.  Just cook the sauce down a little more to thicken and concentrate the flavors!  Served with jalape√±o cheese cornbread and green salad.  Yum!

Loved this recipe!  Added a serrano pepper, as we like things quite spicy and left out the fish.  Served over a little bit of white rice.  This will be a repeat in our house!

Absolutely wonderful!  I didn't have any celery on hand, so I simply substituted celery salt for the table salt, and I added some sausage that needed to be used up.  I served with just with garlic bread.

Excellent recipe but I improved it by adding a bottle of clam juice. Fresh herbs are nice too! Tried it once with Andouille sausage and that was a nice substitution for the scallops.

Didn't have tomato sauce, just put in a little extra chopped tomatoes and a little more stock.  Also added 2 tsp bottled Cajun seasoning.  Excellent served over rice.

Wow -- this is good stuff! I used the amount of cayenne as stated, but I tripled the oregano, thyme, and basil. I used olive oil, rather than butter.

Absolutely wonderful recipe. Due to kitchen cupboard supplies, I used 16 oz of my home canned tomatoes to replace sauce and tomatoes and did not use the chicken stock due to liquid. Just about perfect 'heat'!

I've made this recipe at least 10 times over the past 2 years.  I really like trying different meats with my favourite being chicken, spicy sausage, and shrimp.  Although not complicated, this recipe takes me much MUCH longer to prepare than the specified time.  My best advise is to substitute the chicken stock with an equivalent of chicken bullion otherwise I find the end product too "liquidy".  I had to add tomato paste to thicken on my first attempt.  Lastly, I prefer crushed tomatoes over tomato sauce for a less-processed taste.

Made this and it was very good.  Used a seafood melody bought at Trader Joe's and the variation of shrimp, squid, scallops and fish with the creole was perfect.  Did not have celery and used cabbage instead and it turned out great.  Had to add tomato paste with it to give a stronger taste.  Also added mushrooms to it too.  Easy and fun to make and look forward to make again.  Great recipe that will please those that like seafood and spices.

I only joined the website to say how great this recipe is!  I could eat it every day (and I would too, if only Himself would be happy to do the same).  It is also absolutely simple to make--even Himself can do it.  The only thing that would make it better (and it's pretty near perfect as it is) would be to use a smidge less stock unless you are planning to make a soup.  I found it a bit on the soupy rather than stewy side.  Still absolutely yummy, though.

Tried this one last night...very good with very little "adjusting". I used all fresh seafood but had to use cod instead of haddock as my grocery store was out of it. Personally I like it pretty spicy, but I heeded the warnings of others and cut the hot sauce in half opting to allow others to add it to taste when served. Upon trying the final product, I would have wanted the full amount of hot sauce but others raved. I added little bit of corn starch near the end to thicken the broth a bit. Served it with a small amount of brown rice placed in the bottom deep bowls then ladled the creole over it. A sprinkle of shredded Parmesan, garlic bread for dipping the flavorful sauce and a "company-worthy" dinner is served!

Made this last night and loved it. I didn't have seafood so I replaced it with chicken instead (dark meat).  I didn't use the butter as suggested.  I just used olive oil to saut√©ed the onions, peppers and celery - don't think it needs any butter.  Also I used diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. I threw in the juices from the diced tomatoes.  Because I didn't have chicken broth, I added water and a teaspoon of chicken bouillon (probably didn't even need to add the bouillon) but did have too add little more salt.  Took only 25 minutes to cook since I threw the chicken in along with the seasoning and tomato sauce right after the veggies were saut√©ed.  Didn't need to simmer another 20 minutes after that...veggies were soft and tender.

This is delicious! I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it. I cleaned out my freezer and used 1 lb each of shrimp, crawfish tails and andouille sausage. Personally I think the best thing about a recipe like this is that you can use almost any combination of chicken, sausage and/or seafood and it always turns out great! Also threw in some okra because that's what the husband likes and served with rice. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Bob!

I've been craving the Creole flavor lately and this recipe really hit the spot! I made it exactly as instructed, only I left out the scallops, because they are rather expensive, and the haddock. I used raw shrimp (not the little pink ones!) and some andouille sausage instead, and it's just amazing! Even though I changed out the scallops and haddock portion of the recipe, I can still tell that the base recipe is fantastic, so I'm giving it the full five stars! I couldn't find sweet basil, so I used regular basil instead. I also used a 14 oz can of petite diced tomatoes, which didn't seem to be too much at all!

One of best recipes I have tried in a long time. Will not hesitate to make again.  As my husband likes super hot I added extra heat which  was a mistake on my part. As written would have been perfect.  For fish I used 12 xl large shrimp, 6 scallops, 4 lobster tails, just 1 king crab leg (Costco had a seafood deal this weekend) and 1/2 lb calamari. 2 full meals and 1 very large left over lunch.  Only thing I would change is that all the fish only need 10-12 minutes.  Overcooked at 20

OK, I followed this recipe minus the red pepper because I didnt have any, I thought 3 lbs of seafood and fish would be to much, and this did not disappoint.  This is an AMAZING recipe and a keeper!

Love this recipe!  I use shrimp, chicken and beef  sausage and 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce.  The rest is the same.  I let it simmer for up to 4 hours and serve over rice with Garlic Bread.  It's a winner!

Following some of the suggestions by others, I used diced tomatoes, less spice and hot sauce on the table, and put in some cornstarch at the end. Excellent recipe.

I made this with 2 lbs of shrimp and 1 lb of scallops. It was excellent. I omitted the sugar and it is definitely not needed. The shrimp and scallops were done after 10 minutes. There is no need to cook them the full 20 minutes.

Enjoyed this dish tremendously. Added more seasonings than the receipt called for, but I always do...didn't hurt. Will add black olives next time mainly because my wife I love them. should suit the receipt fine too. Good dish.

My husband and I loved this one. I didn't have scallops but substituted oysters  and I had tilapia instead of halibut. It turned out awesome. I will be making it again.

I followed the recipe exactly using 2 lbs of rock fish (because that's what they had at Costco) and 1 lb of shrimp. It is delicious! Even my 8 year old who doesn't like fish ate this all up!

Delicious! This turned out better than I anticipated - it was so flavorful! I improvised with what I had: vegetable stock, scallops, flounder. (I didn't have chicken stock, celery or green pepper on hand) but otherwise I included everything else (lots of garlic, onions, fresh tomatoes, tomato sauce, all the spices listed).  I read some of other reviews and added a bit of corn starch to thicken it up a bit. We ate it as a stew and added some croutons. Yummy!  Definitely looking forward to making this again and I would highly recommend this recipe. Next time, I'll add the missing ingredients that I didn't have this time around.

I didn't have a couple of the ingredients, but exchanged them for similar things. eg I used cod, jumbo prawns and crabmeat (unfortunately, artificial). Thankfully, I mixed the spices together but didn't just dump them in, just added a spoon at a time and didn't use them all. We are not heavy spicy eaters, so I left out the hot sauce and just added a pinch of crushed chilli peppers. I too, didn't use the chicken broth, but added a tad extra of the diced tomatoes with juice and a small scoop of low sodium chicken powder. It was absolutely delicious....definitely a keeper!!! Can't wait to make it for my 'old grown children" and grandchildren. I'm quite sure they will all love it.

OMG this was so good! Had to do a little substituting on the seafood since my local store doesn't have a great selection but it still turned out amazing. I used flounder, really small scallops and cooked shrimp that I threw in at the last minute. The only other things I changed were to use veggie broth since I don't eat chicken and not add the hot sauce until after I scooped out portions for the kids. My husband who is not a huge seafood fan gives this 4 out of 5 stars!

Delicious!! It was an instant hit. The first time I made it I served it as a soup with bread. Making it again this week and serving it over rice to make it last a little longer. Everyone loved it! Just enough spice without overwhelming you.

This soup was superb! I did make a few changes. I used fish stock instead of chicken stock, cut the cayenne pepper in half and skipped the tabasco. The result was the perfect amount of "heat" for us, but of course, this is just a personal preference. Would definitely make this again (and again!!).

This is absolutely the best recipe I have made yet from this site. I made it as directed, but used red peppers and sauteed them with the onions first. I also cut the butter down to two tbsp. and added a couple of teaspoons of olive oil instead. It's easy to make and tastes like you ordered it from a restaurant. Excellent. Making it again tomorrow.

This recipe was absolutely amazingly DELICIOUS!  It had the right amount of spices, heat and seafood!  My only change was as someone else added, add a can of chopped tomatoes.  I'm so looking forward to making this again soon!

it was AMAZING, the whole house smelled of New Orleans...I didn't add the sugar or butter, I saut√©ed in a bit of olive oil and it turned out amazing...I added Hot Double Smoked Hungarian Sausage and the flavour just spread throughout the dish. With the hotness of the sausage, I did not add hot sauce because it was perfect with the sausage. Can't wait to make this again!!

Frozen scallops and shrimp were on sale this week, used cod instead of haddock. I followed the recipe as is.  FANTASTIC at every mouthful. I can't wait to make it with fresh-caught mexican seafood! A definite repeat.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly using 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoes.  I ate it over tri-color pasta with a side of white bread.  It may have been even better over rice.

We used chicken, sausage and shrimp in place of the haddock and scallops. We also put it over spaghetti and ate it as a pastalaya. It was very flavorful and not too hot, but I like spicy food!

Had to make a few changes due to what I had on hand- cut out the butter and used Pam and olive oil, chicken broth instead of stcck (cut down by 1/2 cup), shrimp and kielbasa, can of tomatoes, red peppers.  Watch the thyme- calls for dried leaves not ground- which is what I had so I cut it in half.  Very good and very spicy!

Really delicious and fun to make!  I had a one pound bag of frozen mixed seafood from Trader Joe's in the freezer and so, searched for a recipe to use it up and voila!  Came up with this lovely Creole. Hubby is not one for heat, so next time will turn that down a notch, leaving out the splash of hot sauce and although it goes against my nature, will half the cayenne.  Cooking only for two, we were fine with the one pound of seafood, and it worked well keeping all the other ingredients as are in the recipe.  Next time will use three pounds of seafood as recommended as I noticed that it reheats well the next day and I will also try to freeze leftovers.
Served with a side of quinoa (extra yummy) and a watermelon salad which helped to curb the heat, even for hubby.  This is definitely a keeper!

Loved this.  Simple and delicious.  I made a few small changes, only out of necessity--I used what I had on hand:  red pepper instead of green, no white pepper, no sugar, no Tabasco (used red pepper flakes instead), didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a can of Rotele, and no fish (only had shrimp & scallops on hand).  I cut down on the liquids a bit because I omitted the fish and didn't want an excess of liquid. I served it with brown rice.  You can omit the butter as well; though I used it, you can seriously cut down on the fat by leaving it out & either using the oil spray to saute, or just put them in the liquids w/o sauteing.  This is very healthy and tasty.

Had to add a little more Tabasco to bring it up to our taste. Did not need the salt or the sugar.

We loved this!!!  It did take a while to make, but it was well worth it.  I used all frozen seafood, thawed, since I can't get much fresh in my area, and per another suggestion, I added a large can of diced tomatoes (Basil, Oregono, and Garlic flavored).  I did add 2 tbsp cornstarch+2 tbsp water to thicken it up at the end, and served with rice.

Awesome! Left out the fish but not the shrimp, added chicken and a smoked ham hock. Finished it off with a nice mahogony colored rue which thickened the dish and gaveit that beautiful rich etouffee like flavor. Mmm

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed it using most ingredients, all shrimp and scallops, no fish.  didn't have any.  probably used more tomato than called for, but was still very tasty.  I used the exact measurement of the peppers (black, white and cayenne) and i did not think it was too spicy.  there is a nice build up of spice after a couple of mouth fulls!

I'm giving this 5 stars from word of mouth as I don't actually like seafood so I had soup. Those that ate it were very impressed. It was a bit too spicy for my stepdaughter, but since she ate everything I gave her, she still loved it. I made a heck of a lot and there was a lot left over...for about an hour, then the Mr had three big bowls of it and it was gone! I tried to make the recipe as is, but had to substitute cod for haddock and lamb stock instead of chicken (it was what I had) also I added a bit of tomato paste as it was a litle runny. I've been told to make it again 'Or Else' :)

This recipe was the Bomb !!  The flavors just exploded in my mouth.  I substituted the oregano w/ parsley and just added a small squeeze of lime juice!  If you like "hotness", this is the dish for you!  Ok, time to dish out some more :)

Absolutely delicious!  Because my husband is allergic to shellfish we used Andouille sausage, talapia fillets and bay scallops. It was great for a cold winter evening served over white rice with warm french bread. Very filling.  Then only thing we will do differently is to double the sauce, there was not enough for our taste.  I didn't spice it up because my husband and mother don't like it that way but spiced mine up and it was even better! Will make this a regular recipe in our family's "Favorites" cookbook. Thank you!

Awesome.  I knocked back to 1/4 tsp cayennee, used cod intsead of haddock, and forgot to add the bay leaves.  It was great while watching the NO Saints take on the Broncos.

I tried this recipe and it was great.  I don't like spicy, so I left out the cayenne pepper and tabasco sauce.  Will definitely be a keeper.

Holy buckets, this stuff is SOOO GOOD!!!  I am from the landlocked Midwest and really only get seafood occasionally at Red Lobster-so tragic I know! This was only my second attempt at cooking with seafood but somehow I stumbled across this recipe...oh that's right my Joe's Crabshack closed and I really wanted crawfish etouffee...anyways, once I read the ingredient list and the reviews I was craving this dish. I was so excited and unsure and hungry...LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! To think that I bought frozen uncooked medium shrimp, uncooked baby scallops and frozen tilapia fillets and it tastes phenomenal!!! FROM WALMART!!! I also used a can of mild rotel diced tomatoes in place of fresh tomatoes and cut the heat in half. I simmered without a lid for 25 minutes to reduce the liquid and added the thawed seafood for 10 minutes. I just threw in the whole fish fillets and after ten minutes they fell apart. Hubby exclaimed that the shrimp were cooked to perfection and he wished he had a whole bowl of just shrimp...I told him we can work it out. In the end I used about a pound and a half of seafood and we had something in every lovin' spoonful! Hubby has requested that we add the whole 3 pounds next time. He is not a tomato-y, brothy, soupy, rice kind of guy but he's already informed me that he's taking the leftovers to work tomorrow...good thing I already have a lunch date or we woulda had to wrestle for it ;)!!!! This will be on our regular menu rotation from here on out!!!

Wow, this was amazing!  My husband said he has never had anything even close at a restaurant!  I used large scallops and shrimp and left out the fish, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Thanks for this, it's wonderful!  We don't have haddock here in Australia, so I used Blue Eye (Trvevalla) and everyone enjoyed it.

This is special. I simply add in whatever I have fresh such as scallops, prawns, rockfish, halibut and coho and whatever I have in the freezer from last season that simply isn't as fresh as it once was. The spices and tomato blend turn it all into magic. The second day is even better.
