I am the deviled egg specialist in our family.  I tried this recipe for a change from my regular eggs that our family loves.  These ones disappear just as fast and were a great hit.  I will definitely make them again. Rather than cook a small amount of bacon I used Hormel Real Bacon

These were all the rave at a recent party!  In reading another review from Kris, she had trouble with the pastry bag.  I use a quart size Ziploc or equivalent to pipe my eggs. (In my experience the sandwich size are too weak).  That way you can make the hole big enough for the bacon bits.

Other than using reduced fat mayonnaise and sharp WHITE cheddar cheese, I followed the recipe exact. My husband and kids loved these deviled eggs--they must because they've inhaled almost the whole platter!

Excellent!  I cut the recipe in half. I followed the recipe, but I took short cuts. I used imitation bacon bits and a pack of McDonald's honey mustard sauce. They are great! My teenagers loved them. I plan to make them for our big dinner at Grandma's house on Sunday.

This is hands-down my favorite deviled egg recipe of all time. I've been making it for years now and there are never any leftovers. The honey mustard seems like a strange touch, but the sweetness really brings out the smokiness of the bacon and the saltiness of the cheddar. Excellent recipe.

These were very tasty. I made them for a potluck, and they were gone in a flash. I added an extra slice of bacon and an extra bit of cheese. I will make these again, but may add some extra mustard and/or onion powder for a little more flavor. Thanks for a great recipe.

The honey mustard was imperceptible in this - reduce the mayo somewhat and add more honey mustard if you want that flavor to come through.

This is the absolute BEST deviled egg recipe I have ever made! Sooo lucky to of come across it and I am always looking for any excuse to make them! Any chance I get, I'm whipping them right up! They have become one of my favorite foods to indulge in, with that being said...I am making them tonight for a family get together tomorrow afternoon...I just hope I don't munch them all down before we get there...hehe ;)

This was a HUGE hit with the family. My mom has made deviled eggs for years and most of us love them. This was just a twist to the "standard" that we're used to.  I was even able to win over a few that never liked deviled eggs with this one! Thanks for sharing.

Very good and a perfectly fine recipe, but nothing about them that really distinguishes them from others.  Bacon nearly always seems to improve everything!  Had to add more mayonnaise.

I made these eggs to serve at an outdoor wedding (along with horseradish deviled eggs) and they were a big hit. They are a good combination of sweet and savory.  They were very easy to make.  I cut my bacon into bits ahead of time and then fried them in a pan.  I might try microwaving the bacon the next time.  I also added a little more cheese.  I will definitely be making this often for parties.

This is the best receipe.  I'm not a fan of miracle whip for sweet relish. This receipe is perfect and the bacon adds the salt so there is not need to add salt.  I make this all the time now.

This was pretty good. I don't LOVE bacon so it wasn't my thing (four strips may be a little much). However some other people at our fourth of July get together thought they were great, so if you love the ingredients I say it's worth a shot. I used spicy mustard instead of honey, based on what I had, and added green onions because I had some leftover from another recipe. Overall just okay. Too bacon-y for me.

I've made these twice for potlucks now, and they haven't lasted long! It's an extremely popular item and they disappear before everyone arrives. I personally have never been a fan of deviled eggs, but I love these! My change was to add less mayo; I didn't really measure, but only added until the yolk was sticking together but not runny. I then added a small splash of milk to thin it slightly. This was probably what made the biggest difference, since I'm not a fan of the runny texture in most deviled eggs. Will definitely keep making this again and again!

It's good. A nice change up from the same hum-drum eggs I usually make. Made for a football party so OF COURSE guys are going to LOVE the BACON!! (lol) I doubled up on the cheese and bacon but still felt it was missing something. I added a little onion but still....just can't put my finger on it. Needs something though.

These were pretty good eggs, but nothing spectacular. I substituted fat free miracle whip for mayo and turkey bacon for regular. I added some grated onion and paprika to the mix for more flavor. The bacon and cheese didn't really add much flavor and the mix was dry, so I also had to add more miracle whip and mustard.  I will make these again, but with my additions and I will probably play around with it more.

These are AWESOME!!  FYI for the calorie counters out there, these come in at about 100 calories per serving of one-half egg.  Of course, there will be variation depending upon your brand of ingredients, but probably not a TON of variation.  Even so, these are worth every calorie.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I also took a shortcut and used bacon bits instead.  Next time I make these I will use less mayo and more honey mustard.  But, overall, it was delicious!

I've never really liked deviled eggs, but I made these for a get together this past weekend and everyone loved them.  I think these are the best deviled eggs I've ever tasted.  I think the bacon had a lot to do with it.  People are still asking me for the recipe.

This was the first time that I've ever made the deviled eggs--usually it's mom.  These tasted great and the kids loved 'em.  I don't know that deviled eggs are really worth the trouble, but what else are you gonna do with Easter eggs?? Anyway, I used ranch dressing and colby/jack cheese with honey mustard, garlic, onion & chili powders. They really were yummy!

Very good and easy.  Only trouble I had was thought I'd get fancy and use a pastry tube to put the filling into the eggs - the darn bacon bits kept getting stuck in the tube!!  Would definitely make again!

Awesome! I made these for new years this year and they were gone in 15 minutes! The only change I made was I added some minced garlic and some finly chopped onion. Best eggs I ever made.

Hubby protested that I was not making the usual but he loved these just as much. Very tasty. Will make again.

These were pretty good. I used turkey bacon, increased the honey mustard and added a bit of salt.  Oh, added a bit more cheese too.

These are delicious!  And easy to make.  I did add a little garlic salt...just a little.  They were perfect for a summer side dish.  I will definitely be making them again soon.
