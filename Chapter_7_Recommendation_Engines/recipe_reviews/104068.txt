AWESOME DESSERT maded with Splenda. I served this as my dessert at a dinner party I had and not one person thought it had Splenda in it. Fresh fruit is the perfect compliment. This is the BEST SUGARFREE cheesecake I've every had. It's moist and really easy to make in your food processor. The second time I made it, I added 2 cups of Splenda instead of the 1-2/3rds called for in the recipe. This just adds a little more sweetness to the cheesecake. Enjoy it!

I tried this recipe for my best friend who is diabetic. There were other diabetics at the party, this was a smash hit! Everyone loved it! Easy to make and great taste! Don't forget the vanilla, it was missing from the preparation instructions. Highly recommend this recipe!

Fantastic treat!  Cheesecake has always been my weakness, so 4 months into my low carb diet I was definitely experiencing some major cravings.  This recipe was perfect.  It was surprisingly easy to mix together, since I had always thought cheesecakes were complicated.  It was dense and creamy just like a "real" one would be.  With a chocolate graham cracker crust and strawberries in splenda syrup on top it was just as yummy as one you'd get at a restaurant.  Now my only problem is not eating the rest of it!  Thank goodness most people at the party asked to take some home.

This was the best cheescake I
have ever had. It was a huge cheesecake.  I used 6 whole eggs-which will add a little more cholesterol.  You could substitute low-fat cream cheese for all or part of the 5 boxes.

This was an excellent recipie.  I made it over Thanksgiving and was asked to make it again for Christmas.  You can't even tell it's sugar free.  It's also an easy recipie to follow.

This was a huge hit at our family's Thanksgiving this year! (we celebrated it ahead of time) Everyone who tried it loved it, even though only 2 of us are diabetic! You have to try this! :)

My daughter and I made several cheesecakes using Splenda last year and they were such a success, we had requests to make more this Christmas.
Glad to have found this site (again) Absolutely THE best cheesecake and sugar-free for diabetic family and friends!!!

Excellent!!! My husband still doesn't know it was made with Splenda.  I served it with fresh strawberries and it was a hit.

This was one of the best sugar free desserts that I have had and my guests were amazed at how good it was too.  I also made it wheat free by leaving out the flour and replacing the crust with the following recipe: 1 cup almond meal or finely chopped almonds and 2 tbls melted butter.  I also only used 1 cup of the Splenda.  I would suggest doubling the vanilla.

Absolutely delicious!  You can't tell it's sugar free.  It was the dessert at our Christmas dinner today.  Everyone loved it, even those not used to eating sugar-free.

This was really good. Very light and fluffy texture.  It tasted very much like regular cheesecake. It's already on my list to make again!

I originally made this cheesecake because my husband and I are watching carbs.  We both loved the cheesecake!! Today I served it for my diabetic mother as well as my sister and two aunts. Everyone loved the flavor and fullness without being too heavy.  I really don't think someone would know it was Splenda if you didn't tell them.

When there have been leftovers, it's been hard for me not to have it on the counter and keep snacking!

AWESOME!!!
