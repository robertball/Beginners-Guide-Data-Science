Instead of the top crust I made a crumb topping.  Voted best pie overall by family and friends.  Nice spicy taste!

That's a LOT of sugar even for tart apples -- I added another 2c of apples and ditched half the sugar for a deep dish pie.  Turned out well.

This was only an ok recipe. I thought the two cups of sugar was too much and I added it dubiously...and I was right. I didn't use especially tart apples, but even had I done that, this would have been too sweet. Next time, if I make this again (because I loved the mix of spices...the flavor was excellent there)I will cut the sugar back to no more than 1 1/4 cups. I thought the addition of coriander was interesting; it added a hint of a lemony note to the flavor. But there again, it was nearly overpowered by the sweetness. If you wanted to keep the sugar the same, this would probably be the kind of pie that is good cut with a slice of fresh cheddar cheese.

LOVED the spicing, but WOW is this thing too sweet!  I cut the sugar back to 1 1/4 c and it was STILL too sweet.  Unless you are using REALLY tart apples the sugar needs to be not more than 1 cup total in my opinion.  We found it almost too sweet to eat.

Great taste, but way too sweet. I'll make it again, but cut the sugars down.

This is a great recipe; however, I cut the sugar and brown sugar in half.

Outstanding pie! Make it and watch it disappear. I've used Marie Callendar's frozen deep dish pie crust and had great results.

One caveat: make sure to put the pie on a foil covered pan when you bake it - the juice has a tendency to seep out and carmelise.

This turned out to be quite a delicious apple pie! I didn't have corriander, so I added some tasty cardamom spice instead and I didn't have enough pie dough for a top so I whipped up some streusel topping and added that to it before baking. The flavors of all of the spices were fantastic! I see some people were concerned about the amount of sugar in this recipe and I was too. I added it all in and I love this sweet spicy apple pie. This is a keeper!

So heavenly! I read the reviews before I made this, so I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup of white and 1/4 cup of brown and it was just right. But the best thing about this pie is all those spices, while putting it together it smelled so good I could have eaten it right then. And when it came out of the oven, the aroma had my mouth watering.
I made this with 2 crusts, using a crust with butter and shortening and it was heavenly. I will be sending this recipe to several people

I did like this!  Since my apples were sweet (what I Had) I only used 3/4 c. sugar (brown sugar) and that was plenty sweet.  It actually made a nice, thick coating on the apples.  I did not have allspice or coriander, so I Just did heaping measures of the other spices but think it would have benefitted from the spices called for.  Will make it again as I thought the flavor was nice and loved how it did not make a runny pie.
