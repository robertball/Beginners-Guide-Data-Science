THIS is the Millionaire Pie I fell in love with from Furr's Cafeteria. It is so wonderful and my entire family loves it! I have substituted whipped topping for the heavy cream which makes it a little faster to prepare.

I've been looking for years for this! This version is the closest to my memory of it - it includes the cream cheese! Absolutely incredible whether using pineapple or strawberries instead. Thank you Rachel!

This is a great and easy recipe I don't know why more people haven' tried this yet. I made it without the pecans and still turned out very yummy!!

not exactly like furs maybe if 1/2 the nuts & pineapple were omitted it would be. overall very nice I made it exactly as the recipe stated. Next time I will try to tweek on it but it's a big calorie pie so won't make it often but not due to flavor.

this is the greatest recipe ever! I've looked for it for years. Not to be eaten often if you have a weight problem.

This is the best pie ever! You can also sub a graham cracker crust. Great summer time pie and fairly simple to make. Enjoy!!
