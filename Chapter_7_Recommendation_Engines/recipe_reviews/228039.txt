Delicious! Make this and make it often. I served this with a balsamic glaze. It vanished in a hot second.

VERY NICE SIDE DISH.  I put a single layer, but could use more,
tomato slices in a foil pie plate and BBQ. Used all ingredients.
Sugar is important. It is what changes the recipe flavour from other baked tomatoes. Less is fine. I also used a balsamic glaze. Will definitely make again on BBQ.

SPECTACULAR RECIPE!  I had tomatoes on-the-vine on hand, so I used those, halved horizontally, and took a sliver off that removed the stem base and allowed them to sit level on the baking sheet.  Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  Next time I’ll reduce the balsamic to a syrup for the finish, as suggested by others, rather than splash it on.  Thanks, Jackie, for a wonderful recipe.

Don’t need to roast tomatoes for two hours. Or cut tomatoes thicker. Needed a better vinegar.

Except for the final addition of 1 1/2 tablespoon of balsamic dressing, this recipe originated with professional chef Ina Garten , "The Barefoot Contessa" .  I would hope you would have given her the credit she deserved.

Yummy!  This was super good!  I made it exactly as written.  My husband and I gobbled it up!  We had it with focaccia bread.  Will make again for sure!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an awesome recipe. I’ve made it at least 10 times since June. It was a huge hit with everyone I made it for.
