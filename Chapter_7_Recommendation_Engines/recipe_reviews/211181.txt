One thing I discovered while making this: the recipe fits great in either 4 1 cup small ramekins/soufflé dishes.... or between two standard ceramic coffee cups for something more casual.

Very, very light, not to mention easy. It would actually make a fun breakfast. I'd add more ginger b/c I couldn't taste it in my souffle.

This was a great recipe to try if you are looking for something gluten free and "almost" sugar free. It was really light - almost a little too spongy for my texture liking - but my friend absolutely loved it. I also inprovised and made a blueberry topping by simmering some blueberries with vanilla, honey and a little cinnammon - then added a splash of soya milk and let it thicken a bit... I spooned it over the dessert and it was very tasty... I'll make it again for sure!

Be prepared to serve quickly because like any soufflé, it deflates quickly.  Very nice presentation, light and airy, but not a whole lot of flavor, even after doubling the grated ginger.  Couldn't taste the banana, but it was still enjoyed by all. Pretty healthy dessert, too.

Nothing special. Looked great. Not sure what I expected but it was not this mushy egg dish. Probably will not make it again.

hmmm, not sure what to think about this.  It taste ok, but nothing special. I somehow got the taste for honey, cocoa powder and bananas and this is a recipe that came up in the search for which I had all the other ingredients.  But I probably won't make again.

It was a nice way to use up old bananas, but it wasn't great.  It was eggy, mess that deflated quickly.  The flavor was ok. I also used powdered ginger. I did not top with cocoa, as I don't think that would have helped it.

Our Souffle would've turned out great if we followed the directions on the egg whites and salt.

Extremely easy to make, doesn't fall even when it's cooled a bit. I would recommend adding a bit more sugar, mine just tastes extremely like banana. But hey, if you really like banana.

Made this for dessert tonight for my husband, me and our two kids.  We all loved it (except for my son who said it was "just ok").  It's not super sweet although I suppose you could make it as sweet as you want, just add sugar.  Very light and yummy.  I used a very ripe banana and a regular one because it's what I had and I substituted honey for agave because I didn't realize I was out of honey, but I don't think that made a difference.  It was really good and probably something I would make again!

Pretty good. I've never had soufflé before, and I liked it. It was sweet enough without adding any extra sugar, which was great, and is so easy! I'll probably make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I really wanted to like this recipe because I often end up with ripe bananas and the only thing I can find to do with them is make banana bread/muffins.  This recipe makes a dish that looks good, but tastes quite bad.  The bananas overpower the dish, and the taste is not pleasing.

Great recipe! Super easy to follow directions. Make sure your bananas are super ripe, it will give the souffle more flavour.
