I love it! I have tried this recipe many times and if you convert everything to tablespoons (1/4 cup= 4 tablespoons) it only uses three dishes(Mug,  Tablespoon, Whisk). Also, it doesn't mention it in the description, but if you use sugar that isn't white, this recipe is vegan! I have made this before and I will make it again. I rate FABULOUS out of ten!!! :D

Looks good, just came out. Added a pinch of baking powder and it took 2 mins to cook. It has a cake like consistency. I used an extra large mug too. Pretty good!

This recipe is the best mug based recipe I've tried. While the result isn't like an oven baked brownie, it sure does the job in a pinch. That's great. Tastes good. I microwaved mine for 3 minutes.

Easy, quick chocolate fix.  Not as great as brownies out of the oven but the recipe has a place in the box.

I love this recipe. It’s great when I need a quick chocolate fix and is super easy and fast. I added some chocolate chips because I wanted even more chocolate and it makes it a little less bitter. I wouldn’t microwave for more than 2 minutes because it starts to smell burnt. 70 seconds was perfect for me. A little gooey still but yummy!

This is a great recipe to build on.  I substituted chocolate almond milk for the water, half the amount of canola oil and added in peanut butter and maple syrup.  Topped with salted chocolate caramel sauce. Yum!

Really good.  Made 3, one for each of my brothers and then one for me.  Turned out really well.  I would definitely make it again, maybe add chocolate chips.

I used a sugar alternative and it was so yummy! And  with normal sugar  it is probably double yummy!! Love it ! Everyone 
should try it. Most are to bitter from the cocoa powder but this one was perfect!

Horrible! I microwaved the batter for 1.5 minutes and it burned to a crisp. Now my house smells horribly of burnt sugar?

I made it and will try again. It looked awful but tasted pretty good. It looked to me like it separated. There were parts of it that looked like wallpaper glue and parts that were properly cakey, though very dry. I definitely will keep trying until I master this one.

Easy recipe to follow but after  one minute and 40 seconds the batter looked like the Sahara Desert! I added 1 egg and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder.  The brownie in a mug looked and smelt like a full size cake!

Turned out very well, very sweet but did not taste much like chocolate (maybe not enough coco powder) made it taste more like a sugar cake than a brownie but overall very good

If you're a diehard chocolate junkie, and you can't wait to have a real brownie, then I guess this could be the hit you need for your fix.  It tastes a little weird, not rich and wonderful like a real brownie.  There is no leavening of any kind, like eggs, so  the texture is like anything else you try and "bake" in a microwave:  leathery and chewy.  I'll stick to real brownies.....
