This is a very good biscotti recipe. I made it with olive oil instead of butter, as I've been doing in all my biscotti lately. I just really like the taste better than butter, and I highly recommend trying it out. I also used dried figs instead of raisins, which were a nice change of pace.

This is consistently one of the best biscotti recipes I have-I substitute dried cranberries & pecans and add a little orange rind (eliminate the cinnamon); you can use other substitutions as well. It's one of my favorite 5 biscotti recipes.  Everyone loves it.

Great recipe.  I use my food processor to coarsely grind the raisins and nuts.  I also cooked them a little bit longer so they would be dry and crispy.  I had no trouble cutting them with the nuts and raisins chopped fine and always use a serrated knife or an electric knife works well also.

Very easy to make.  Good flavor and easy to tweak recipe.  I flatten mine a little more to make longer biscotti (but not too flat usually about 3/4").  I usually use chopped nuts but have used whole almonds and it came out good too.
I love cinnamon so usually double (or even triple) the cinnamon. I have used walnuts, pecans and almonds successfully.  I have also made them plain and they are quite good too. This recipe doesn't mind a little variation.

After eating phenomenal biscotti in Port Townsend, WA, I wanted to try to make something similar at home.  I modified this recipe by adding 2 tsp of orange zest and substituting chocolate chips for the raisins.  They turned out perfect, and were a huge hit with friends and family.  Thank you!

I've made this recipe several times and it has always worked well. I agree the chunks make it hard to slice so I chop walnuts extra fine and use currants instead of raisins and they have a much finer texture.

Cinnimon lovers get your fix here. For an added cinnimon boost I drizzled cinnimon sugar over the top before baking. I also added mini chocolate chips.
Certainly one of my top five biscotti recipes.

Very good.  I substituted almond extract for the vanilla, and it added a really nice flavor.

This recipe makes a great cookie everytime.  I made 2 batches exactly as written.  The 3rd batch- I deleted the raisins, and only used 1/2 cup of walnuts - in place of the raisins I used 1 cup of mini chocolate chips. They are wonderful. After reading the other reviews, I let the loafs cool until I could handle and then cut immediately.  I found this kept me from getting alot of crumbling.  I also used a "sawing" motion.  I had great success.  I made these for Christmas goodies and dipped the ends in melted white chocolate and sprinkled with red and green sugar. The batch with chocolate chips, I also dipped and sprinkled with chocolate sprinkles.

Delicious and very easy to make.  For my oven, it took a little longer than 20 minutes for the first baking, maybe closer to 25 minutes but that wasn't a big issue.

This recipe is excellent! I found it necessary, though, to soak the raisins for about 10 minutes before adding them to the mixture. This is now in my permanent recipe collection!

this was a easy recipe and very yummy!  I have used this recipe as a base without putting the raisins, walnuts in and put in chocolate chips, white chips, almonds, coconut, dates....pretty much anything!

I loved this bread especially since I melted a few chocolate bars and coated the biscotti in them. :) I prefer it fresh over the later form since it's really hard.   I didn't use raisins but I knew I had to use walnuts; only downfall is that I discovered I'm actually allergic to walnuts. :( Oops.

They were a hit. I tried to replace the raisins with mini chocolate chips, per my husbands request, but they didn't come as crunchy or tasty. Stick to the recipe on this one.

Interesting cookie as I added grated chocolate, white chocolate chips and dried blueberries.  A very adult cookie ~ and almost like a half and half eating experience between biscotti and scone.  Definitely not a hard crunchy cookie with my substitutions ~ though the outside of the cookie was an amazing golden color that had crunch right out of the oven ~ but got softer within hours even stored air-tight.

We found these boring I soaked my raisins in rum but it was not enough to give this biscotti flavor. I would suggest adding more spice if you choose to make these. For me, I will be moving on.

Great recipe, although mine didn't turn out very eye-appealing!!  I added dried cranberries and pecans, and they were difficult to slice, they fell apart.  I pushed them back together and baked another few minutes and they turned out fine, but not appealing enough to give away as gifts.  They tasted great and will try again using finely chopped cranberries and nuts.

This recipe turned out perfect on my first try at biscotti.  I do suggest a pinch of salt to bring out the favors.  I will use as a base to try different favors, using different nuts and dried fruits as well as different extracts.  If you take your time in cooking, cutting and re-baking the second phase, I guarantee good results.

This is a fabulous recipe. I am not a fan of raisins, so I substituted dried cranberries for those and added chopped almonds instead of walnuts and allspice for the cinnamon. The end result was amazing!!! I ended up cooking them longer after slicing because I like a crispy biscotti. Will definitely make this again and again!!!!!

Cut sugar to 1/2 cup otherwise followed recipe exactly for remaining ingredients.  the biscotto looked very cake like  and crumbly so I increased the cooking time 5-10 minutes for both baking sessions.  Tasty and very easy  but still more cake like than other recipes.
