I'm glad we tried this, I forgot to review it. It was very good, also nice and thick, how I prefer. I had whole tomatoes instead of diced so I gave them a few rounds with the immersion blender before adding and left it a little chunky at the end. We ate this on meatball subs and I wish I had made extra.Edit 7/17/15: I didn't really afford enough time the first attempt, and had to use dried rosemary. I made it again with the full simmer time and the fresh rosemary and it is different but still very good. I used home canned tomatoes, blended smooth and it was still nice and thick and coated linguine very well.
