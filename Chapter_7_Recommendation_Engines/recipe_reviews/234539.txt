This was tasty. I served it with homemade high fiber chips and had it for dinner. Very hearty dip. The only part that I changed was the taco seasoning. The taco seasoning I use comes in a packet and 1/2 cup of that stuff would be multiple packs and pretty strong, so I used part of a packet... came out fine
