I've been making cha gio for 45 years and I'm always looking for a healthier version. The ground chicken resulted in a drier texture than what I'm normally use to. This recipe has the foundation for one of my favorite meals of all time. If you are going to use chicken instead of an authentic pork version I highly recommend using all dark meat otherwise sub pork for the chicken and you have a winner. I also use 'Menlo' brand wrappers because true rice paper can be difficult to work with. As for a healthier version -  I'll just shorten my life and stick with the pork and deep fry them because they are that good.

These are fantastic and taste almost exactly like my Vietnemese mother in law makes them.  I messed up and bought the wrong wrapping,  but they were still awesome.  Thanks for posting this!

Great. I did use ground pork, but otherwise used the recipe exactly as printed. Brilliant. Best ever.

This was the recipe I’ve been looking for! This is my first time to ever write a review and I get all of my recipes from AR! That is how good it is! You can substitute any veggies, I added some chilli sauce to the concoction to give it more flavour, and then to dip it in. I am gluten free and this is the closest to an egg roll that I haven’t been able to have in over 10 years. I didn’t add meat so it was also vegetarian. But the basics of the whole recipe are spot on. Without the tip to wet a towel to transfer the disc to I would have given up. The only tip I have is to fry it in a non stick pan, I used a regular pan and ruined the first batch because it stuck to the bottom of the pan and then fell apart. Also keep them from not touching or they will also stick together and if you try to separate they will fall apart. Thank you so much!!!!

I had so much fun making these, especially rolling  up the rice paper wrappers! And they were so delish. I'll definitely be making these again very soon. Thank you for the recipe. :-)

I added 1/2 a teaspoon of ginger to make it better fit our tastes but all in all it is soooo good!

Made some adjustments as I don’t eat seafood. Used Italian ground sausage and didn’t use mushrooms. Turned out delicious!! Will make again!!

this was so easy and delish!  I couldn't find the wood mushrooms so I just used button, and I added crab meat to the shrimp instead of chicken.  everyone loved them, of course I  had none left over! thanks for this wonderful recipe
