I got 6 large burgers out of this and they were so delicious! I find that oftentimes when I make turkey burgers they come out too dry but I think that adding the beans gave them some much-needed moisture. I used 1.3 lbs turkey, a whole can of black beans (drained and rinsed), a bit more than a half cup of the Panko breadcrumbs, skipped the Parmesan cheese and the soup mix and used some onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper instead. Yum!!! I can't wait to make these again!

The first time I made per recipe (and heart-shaped ha!)- delicious! This time I added quinoa instead of panko just to double pack some protein ;) Top with avocado

YUmyumyum. I left out the parm to cut calories and topped with laughing cow queso fresco. Great way to get  flavor and stretch a pound of meat

Let me start by saying I'm not a good cook, and I've never made any kind of burger/patty. I gave these a try and I'm glad I did. They are fantastic and so easy to make!!! No one could believe I made them lol. I didn't add the Parm cheese and they still came out awesome!!

Love this recipe!  So quick and easy, fail-proof!  Typically turkey burgers get dry easily in my kitchen, not with this quick recipe.  Reheat great and no need for cheese or any other calorie adding toppings.  I have made this a few times and subbed low-cal shredded mozzarella and shredded 1/2 cup smoked cheddar.  Great on the stove top, as my bbq'r is on the fritz!

The kids and I loved these.  I did modify just a bit to meet my dietary needs.  I added a handful of spinach to the food processor when I processed the black beans.  I did not use bread crumbs, used a 1/2 cup of mexican shredded cheese instead.  I also seasoned with Montreal steak seasoning and a tbs of onion powder.  Cooked them on the George Forman and OMG they were GOOD!!!!!

We loved these burgers! The first time I made them I "slightly crushed" the black beans, but the next time I used my hand chopper and chopped them up pretty good.  That made the burgers even better!  My husband, the red-meat-eater, said that these were possibly the best burgers he had ever eaten! Thank you for posting this recipe!

These burgers were really good. I did not do the bread crumbs or soup mix. I did about 1 1/2 TBSP onion powder, and baked it on 375 for 25 minutes.

My wife and I made these burgers last night and they were tasty. I like the consistency the beans add to the turkey mixture. 
We cooked them on the stove, topped them with mushrooms, onions and a spicy mustard. They snuggled up in a bed of spinach.

Try this recipe if you are looking to jazz up your turkey burger.

HOLY COW, these are amazing!!!!  I made some additions to the seasoning that I'd highly recommend:
*Added cumin, cayenne and sriracha. Oh, and smoked paprika!!! Yummm.
*I substituted Mexican shredded cheese for parmesan because that's what I had. (I know, totally not the same thing, but I'm job hunting at the moment, sooo...)
*Instead of grilling them, I put them in the oven on a wavy griddle rack thingy at 375 for about 35 minutes. I had some mixture left over, so I did a couple in the frying pan and was able to compare them. They were both good, but the oven ones were incredibly crispy on the outside. Seriously, seriously delicious. Oh, and I flipped them about 10 minutes before taking them out.  I froze some too, and they reheated like a champ.

Seriously, try these.  How many recipes do you know that are a) cheap, b) low fat, c) pretty quick to make, and d) brain-meltingly delicious?

I left out the Parmesan, used an entire can of black beans and used plain bread crumbs instead of Pablo, but they were GREAT!  Even approved by my very picky 9 y/o daughter. Will definitely be making again as our family makes better food choices!  (I topped with mozzarella and avocado.. yum!)

I thought these were pretty good. I would have liked a little more flavor. They were slightly boring to me. My husband thought they were perfect. The texture was good, and it was a nice way to get my bean hating son to eat some beans!

I just made these for lunch and they were delicious. I used shredded mozzarella, Italian breadcrumbs and egg whites. I skipped the onion mix and just seasoned with garlic, pepper, cayenne and cumin. I'm freezing the leftovers for next week. Yum!! I cooked the burgers in a non-stick pan on low-med heat and covered for a few mins, flipped only once.

I used pinto beans instead of black beans (they're less noticeable!)  When I asked my kids if they liked the "bean burgers" they were shocked to find out the burgers had beans!!  I thought they were GREAT!  Oh, and I used ground venison but using beef would give them even more flavor.

We make these frequently - so tasty and simple. My adult son has a particular taste for them and will eat cold leftover patties straight from the fridge! We usually use about 1.25 lbs turkey and a full can of black beans, sometimes substituting feta cheese and I've always made them on my indoor grill. Planning to add chopped mushrooms today!

This is a very forgiving recipe and is very easy to modify to your family's taste. I was a little short on the beans (only had 3/4 cup left from another recipe), added about half of a small onion grated (we hate the onion soup mix), and used about half a cup of light shredded Mexican cheese blend (then added thin slice of cheese when grilling).  I made this up a couple of hours before grilling, I find this helps the burgers not fall apart on the grill.  We enjoyed the combination and texture of the black beans with the turkey.  They were a nice change of pace from our normal turkey burger recipes and we'll have again.

I loved it! I tweaked the recipe a little. I added a half of cup of fresh onions instead of the dry onion soup mix, added 2 cloves of garlic, fresh chopped cilantro, fresh chopped cherry tomatoes, and topped it off with salsa, sour cream, avacado and red onions!! Deliciously amazing!

Loved it! I accidentally used a whole can of black beans but still tasted great! I baked these instead of grill (30 min at 350) and they were amazing. Sprinkled some garlic salt on top too.

My grocery store was out of black bean burgers and I had a craving so...I used a lb. of ground turkey, a full can of beans, rinsed and drained and mashed, onion soup mix, regular breadcrumbs and an egg.  Skipped the parm.  The burgers stayed together well on the grill, were very tasty, healthy and FILLING!  Will make again trying different seasonings, maybe a packet of taco seasoning next time!

Substituted regular dried whole wheat bread crumbs, pinto beans instead of black beans and chopped onions to replace the onion soup mix. The best part was I could use 2 and then freeze the rest. Just used The frozen 4 tonight and they were delicious and didn't crumble on the grill. Will definitely use again.

Let me start off by saying that I usually hate turkey burgers, but my husband loves them, so I keep looking for recipes. These are absolutely fantastic, so much so that I crave them and have made them three times in as many weeks. What makes the difference for me is the use of panko and black beans. The burgers are juicy, flavorful, and not mushy at all. I also have taken to using very high quality turkey. This is a keeper for sure!

Followed recipe exactly except made on indoor grill pan not outdoor grill. Good flavor, good way to get a lot of servings out of a pound of ground turkey. However, I found the patties a bit dry. It only calls for one egg for moisture. I might try making them again but using a little bit of chicken broth or something else to give it more moisture. It was extremely dry.

This was excellent! I followed the recipe, except for using some spices instead of the onion soup mix I didn't have. Very moist and great flavor! I sauteed some onion to have on top. I grilled them on top of some foil for the first side, since the mixture was so soft and moist, then I took them off the foil for the 2nd side.

Very good!  My family loved them, even though I flipped the first batch and noticed the measuring cup of breadcrumbs sitting on the counter.  I added some to the second batch and they turned out fine.  I think next time I would put in 1/2 the package of onion soup mix, but it was tasty as written.

I made this recioe exactly as is and the burgers are delicious. The only thing I changed, was not the actual burgers, but the toppings. They are delicious with either salsa or guacamole.

My twin toddlers and I all loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except I changed the cooking method; I divided the mixture into muffin tins and baked them in the oven at 350 for 18 min.  This made 9 sliders.  I will certainly be making this again and again.

Excellent!  My wife and I are trying new healthier recipes.  I made this last night.  It was awesome.  I coupled  it with some french fries cooked in my air fryer.  I ate it without the buns but added sauteed onions and bellpeppers, reduced fat sharp cheese.

I am always looking for a great turkey burger. This is by far the best we have made. My son absolutely loved it. The beans make the dish. I highly recommend this one. I had mine with a homemade corn salsa. I didn’t even use any other condiments on the burger. Yummy!!

Wow. I made it almost true to the recipe. But I didn’t have onion soup mix. No worries, added a hefty tablespoon on my chili seasoning blend. The picky daughter liked it. Hubby asked me to make this again. Was so flavorful I didn’t even need a bun or additional cheese on top.    Oh, and like another reviewer mentioned, I cooked them in our Foreman grill.

Followed the recipe minus the hot sauce, which I just didn’t have, and added a slice of cheese. It came out great and I will make again. I added some chipotle ranch dressing on top of the lettuce and tomatoes.

I made this because I’m trying to get more plant proteins in my family’s diet and this recipe had great reviews. I must add my five stars because this is absolutely delicious! I put some bbq sauce on it but it doesn’t even need the sauce to be really tasty. It’s moist and flavorful. I may try a different seasoning next time, but this is definitely going into my recipe book!

Wow! To date,  the best tasting turkey burger I've made.  My husband travels a lot for work and said it was a very moist and flavorful. . I don't feel as full like I would if I had a burger.  It's just the 2 of us, so I'm excited to freeze and taste later. 
Bravo to the receive guru! These will def be made again!

I didn't have dry onion soup mix so I made my own, and threw the beans in the processor. These were some of the best burgers we've ever had! So so good, thank you!

Saw this recipe and just got done making it for lunch. Came out good the only thing I will change the next time is add more spices to it for more flavor.

I do not have an outdoor grill, so I used a skillet heated to medium-medium high. My only variations were whole wheat Panko bread crumbs (not sure if that made a difference in flavor) and soft goat cheese instead of grated Parmesan. I love the tenderness of the burger, and the melted goat cheese mixed in. I'll make again, but add more goat cheese - I only had half a cup instead of three-quarters.

I will definitely make these turkey burgers again. They are very flavorful and moist. I like to make meals ahead of time and freeze them, so I made a triple batch of these.

I only gave it 4 stars because I excluded the egg and breadcrumbs.  They were AMAZING!  I made it with a large salad and put a burger patty on top.

They were Great! I don't know what people did, who said that they were dry.  I followed the recipe except for one switch out, which was just by mistake. I opened to pour in soup mix and it seems it was vegetable soup mix instead of onion soup mix. I didn't realize what I had.  Anyway, I don't think made much difference. Flavorful, juicy and I love the texture with the beans.   I will make again and that time I'm going to make sure I have the onion soup mix, I want to taste that onion flavor too.***Made these again and again kept to the recipe...amazing.  This time I also made a garlic mayo to use with them.

Good flavor, but the texture was really mushy (which was so disgusting to me). I did use a whole can of black beans (an extra half cup) and Italian breadcrumbs instead of planko - perhaps following the recipe exactly would have changed the texture for the better.

I omitted the parmesan and from someone who dreads cooking, these were super easy and so seriously delicious! Added to my favorites for nights I need quick and tasty.

omygoodness. SO good! I used Italian style breadcrumbs because that's what I had. And cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, and salt and pepper  - no onion mix. Amazing. Moist, flavorful. Had one for dinner on a sesame hamburger bun with feta cheese, mayo, and onion. Having another for lunch right now on top of baby spinach, feta, and a cilantro/avocado yogurt dressing I had on hand. Can't get it in my mouth fast enough!

I've been making and remaking this recipe since I found it a couple of years ago. I love it every time, and my boyfriend does too. The only substitution I make is to replace the dried soup mix with half a package of store-bought taco or chili spice mix. Also, I prefer crushing the beans into a paste.

Serve with salsa, cheddar and thinly sliced avocado. They're so good I eat them without buns...

Excellent!  I made up 3 lbs of burgers and froze some.  I find that they are easier to cook on the BBQ when frozen.  The taste was great!  Had some sliced avocado on top.

So delicious! When cooking there wasn't much juice and they appeared like they would be dry but that was not the case at all! I didn't have the French onion soup mix so replaced it with onion and garlic powders. Super tasty, will definitely make again!!!

I liked it; my family didn't. I have made a number of different turkey burgers, but I had never tried them with black beans. I liked how the black beans HELPED to keep the burgers together better, but I don't know if they needed smashed more or what, but they were not a hit with the family. :/ Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe with very lean beef, as it was what I had on hand, it was very flavorful, however a bit too salty for my liking...I doubled the recipe so as to use up the black beans, but I think one packet of the onion soup mix would have been sufficient...all in all, my husband and I enjoyed this recipe and will make it again...

I've made various delicious turkey burgers from scratch. Sadly, this one wasn't enjoyed by either myself or hubby. It tasted completely bland and was overall unappetizing. If I were to make this recipe again, it would have to involve the addition of herbs and spices. The onion soup mix sure didn't do it.

Tastes great and out of the ordinary.  I used some beef boullion granules instead of the onion soup mix, since I'm not a fan.  Still really good.
