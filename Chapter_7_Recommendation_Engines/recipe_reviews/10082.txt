The flavor of this icing was quite good - the orange really adds a nice zip. However, it's quite thin. It's not the consistency I was hoping for when I think of cream cheese frosting. I added some more cream cheese, and that helped. Just keep in mind that this is very sugary - not butter or cheese based like many. 
It would definitely be great for icing cinnamon rolls or drizzing over a bundt cake..but the texture just didn't work well for frosting an entire cake.

This turned out good in the end, but needed a little tweaking. I followed the recipe, but stopped at 2 cups of sugar and 1 tbsp of orange juice. At that point, it was plenty sweet enough and adding the rest of the juice would have made it too runny. It still needed more flavoring though, so I added another 1/2 teaspoon of zest. The yield was substantially shy of 3 cups, and I can't see leaving out the 1/2 cup of sugar affecting that outcome. Good to know if you are expecting or needing the full yield. I would make this again, but may try increasing the cream cheese and using orange juice concentrate instead of juice.

Simply perfect for Carolyn's Orange Rolls, from this website, and the orange zest was wonderful! I left out the nuts and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla; other than that, the recipe was perfect for me. I will use this on other desserts and will try it with nuts too.

Great recipe! I gave it 4 stars because I had to change a lot, but with my changes I'd give it 5 stars!  I doubled the cream cheese and the orange zest, halved the orange juice and also added an extra cup of confectionery sugar because it was too runny (probably because of the extra cream cheese).  We will definitely make this again! Very yummy!

Very good.  Didn't have orange zest so I added some orange marmalade.  Everyone loved it.  Put it on Carrot Bread from this site.

This icing is simple to make and tastes great on Carrot cookies or Carrot cake. The grated orange really comes through, so you may want to use less orange rind if you prefer. Good icing all round!

Great tasting just hard to make look "pretty".  I had to put it in the fridge right away.  Everyone loved it on a gluten free spice cake with orange marmalade filling.

I omitted 1 tbsp of orange juice to avoid it being too runny. Since I was making frosting for cupcakes, I wanted it a bit firm for piping. If I were to use this for cinnamon buns, I'd probably follow the recipe exactly. Great flavor!

I loved this frosting! The hubby loves orange.  I used it on the chocolate cupcakes with surprise cream cheese filling.  Easy and will definitely make again.
Thank You OP!

Who needs cake when the frosting is this good?! I put this on a pumpkin cake, but it's so good it could really go on anything. Would it be bad to put this on my toast in the morning?!

Delicious frosting! I found the texture to be perfect for the citrus cake I made recently. I think if it is turning out too runny for you, the most likely culprit is butter and/or cream cheese that you either a) melted or softened too much in the microwave, or b) you allowed it to get too warm on the counter and it went from soft to almost melted. Next time, try letting it sit out until JUST slightly softened. I think you will be much happier with the results. Loved this frosting!! I have made it several times now, and my favorite tweak is to add 1 tablespoon orange juice concentrate in place of the 2 tbls. orange juice. Really adds a punch when you want a stronger orange flavor. I also add a bit more zest and usually leave out the walnuts - just personal preference.

I could eat this with a spoon it is so good.  I did take CC's advice and cut the OJ to only 1 tablespoon and upped the zest.  The specks of orange throughout the frosting look very pretty when done.  I did use the full amount of sugar.  It turned out the perfect piping consistency, and tasted amazing on the orange cupcakes I made.  My orange loving daughter loved these for her birthday.  Just awesome frosting.

Uber easy!  I used lemon extract and dried orange peel in mine, plus a little less confectioners sugar (2 cups), a little more cream cheese (4 oz) and it is very nice.  Used it atop pumpkin bread.  Very easy to make a and tweak to your taste.  Thanks!

Based on other reviews, I must have done something wrong because mine didn't come out runny at all.  In fact I was afraid it was too thick for my Orange Sugar cookies.  But it stiffened up nicely and tastes wonderful.  This is a great recipe!

Made a yellow cake with orange essence oil, and topped with this amazing orange cream cheese frosting! I didn't use the walnuts. Was the hit of the party- usually the chocolate cake goes 1st- but everyone came back for seconds on this one!

Great frosting, I used it this morning on a batch of Dad's Orange Cardamom Breakfast Rolls off this site.  Did not use the zest (I am not a big fan of zest)m wonderful orange taste.  I only needed 1/2 the amount made to cover a batch of breakfast rolls.

This frosting is perfect! I put it on vanilla cupcakes, but first I put vanilla cream in the center of the cupcake then I put the orange cream cheese frosting. They were a hit with the family. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I used 1Tableapoon  of orange marmalade instead of orange juice since some of the other reviews said the icing was too thin or runny. I omitted the walnuts too. I frosted the flourless orange cake with this recipe.

This frosting  was really watery for a frosting but not thin enough to pass as a glaze .  I have to say the "frosting" is super sweet and I feel lacking the orange flavor I was hoping for . Overall the recipe I feel was poor

I followed the advice of others. I upped the cream cheese to 4 0z. and reduced the orange juice to 1 Tbsp. I added a drop of wild orange essential oil to the mix for added flavour. I only used 1 cup of icing sugar. It was the right consistency but far to sweet for my palate. Does anyone have any ideas on how to reduce the sweetness? I'm thinking of trying to use honey as the sweetener.

I excluded the sugar and nuts and put in 1 ts of vanilla extract and 1 more ts of orange zest instead.  Texture was great. I spread it ontop of a almond and orange gluton and sugar free cake I made and topped the frosting with sliced almonds.

I used this frosting with the Extreme Chocolate Cake recipe from this site and it was an amazing combination!  Everyone raved about it.  The only change I made was to use just 1 tablespoon of OJ as one reviewer suggested for the texture.  Perfect!  Thanks

Icing was thin but a nice idea. I had to fiddle with the sugar/zest/juice ratio to get it CLOSE to the consistency I wanted (I think the cream cheese is what threw it off) but it still recieved rave reviews by everyone that had a cupcake. As another reviewer suggested, I added a very small dash of vanilla. Unfortunately, a little goes a long way and I felt it overpowered the orange so next time I'll leave that out. Overall, wonderful icing to play with.

This was just what I was looking for to put on my ginger spice mini cupcakes. I only needed two cups of the powdered sugar. Also, I did have to let the icing sit but a few minutes. No problems with running or setting. Very tasty.

This is definitely more like an icing. I tried cutting back the orange juice in 1/2 and added extra cream cheese, butter, and powdered sugar, and its still running. The taste is good, just not ideal for cupcakes.

I have a theory of why some of the reviews said it came out runny:  I just moved to a tropical island and I am used to putting my cream cheese and butter out to soften but I'm not used to it being this warm and I think I let it get too soft so it came out thin. I added food coloring and ended up with a nice bright orange frosting on my orange cake.  Yummy :)

very good on its own but a mod by increasing zest to 1/4 cup and oj to same as well as 2 tbs of grand marnier Orange liqueur and 500 grams (1 lb)icing sugar did the trick. Beat very well and the orange flavour was outstading on a  betty Crocker pre-mix carrot cake

Okay concept: the orange flavor and nuts would've tasted good in a good base frosting, but this one was runny from the orange juice, and used way too much sugar. I had to add more cream cheese and butter to tone down the sweetness, but it's still runny.  I won't be making this one again.
