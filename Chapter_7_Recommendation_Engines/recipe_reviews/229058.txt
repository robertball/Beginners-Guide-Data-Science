I was a bit confused and did not know if the rice should be cooked before adding to the casserole. So I made this on the stove top, and made the rice in another pot. I added some celery and I also had to season it since it was somewhat bland.

I absolutely love this recipe!  It's quick and easy and everyone enjoys it.  I double it to make a 9x13 and otherwise follow it to a T.  It serves great as leftovers, too!

I first had this at a family reunion with my husband's side of the family - it was such a big hit that I asked my mother-in-law for the recipe.  I've made it twice since then and shared the recipe with my side of the family as well.  This is a good one, because it's easy to make it a day in advance of a big event, then pull out  and pop in the oven.  Will definitely be making this one again.

I didn't have cream of shrimp soup, so I substituted cream of mushroom...was easy and yummy.  Not too spicy.  A nice, quick, mild jambalaya!
