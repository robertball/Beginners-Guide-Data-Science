Very simple marinade with great flavor on skirt steak. After removing the steak from the marinade I poured the remainder into a small sauce pan, added a small amount of sugar, and reduced it a bit. When the steak was plated I poured a small amount over the top. Delicious!

Prepared as per recipe except I did not add salt, and it was delicious! I needed something for skirt steak that didn't require hours and hours of marinating, and this was perfect. I marinated it for two hours; came out tender and flavorful.

Good flavor but the meat was tough.
