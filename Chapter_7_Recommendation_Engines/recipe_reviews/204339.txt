I thought this was great, as did my oldest boy. Husband was indifferent. A different way to eat broccoli, which I'd make again for just the oldest and I. This was a welcomed change-up from your basic broccoli recipe. NOTE: Husband thought this was a little better with a little butter drizzled over the top, I thought it was good as is.

Very nice change from regular 'ol broccoli!  I wasn't sure about the flavor combinaton, but the orange did add a nice citrus flavor that did "brighten" it up a bit.  To simply things, I used a steam in bag of broccoli and added the rest of the ingredients, tossing to coat.  Overall, different but good.

It took me a long time to get around to making this because the orange juice scared me off.  Now I know why.  Neither of us cared for this, even though I played it on the safe side and used far less than the 2-1/4 tsp. of zest directed for a half head of broccoli! Had to leave out the red pepper flakes in consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards, but I'm not so sure I would have cared for it here anyway.  I sprinkled the zest over the broccoli at the end, along with the orange juice.  It just wasn't a flavor combination that appealed to us.

This is our favorite cooked vegetable.  I made the recipe as written and it was wonderful.  We liked the zip of the red pepper flakes and the bite of orange zest and juice.  Great way to cook fresh broccoli.  Thanks Mrs.Fugrim for sharing.

Delicious!  NEVER would have thought of orange with broccoli.  But then I came across this recipe and figured I give it a go!  So glad I did!  The orange flavor is not at all overpowering like I thought it would have been.  Perfect balance with the heat from the red pepper flakes!  Nice recipe!!!

Extremely easy preparation and not bad flavor initially, but it had a strong bitter aftertaste; I may have gotten a little pith with the zest, or it wasn't a good idea to heat the zest and red pepper longer than the broccoli, or the orange I used wasn't very good, or some combination of all of that. Either way, nobody wanted to finish it. I'll try it again another time and update this review if I have better results. The same cooking method with just 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1/4 tsp each salt and granulated garlic, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper (I also add a few tablespoons of water to the hot pan to help steam the broccoli) is delicious.

Surprisingly delicious! Made it exactly as written. I thought that amount of red pepper flakes might made it too spicy for me, but not so. Definately a repeat.

I really wanted to like this as it is an easy and quick way to give a twist to regular ol' broccoli. But my family did not care for it. It had a bitter taste (maybe from cooking the orange zest?) and was too spicy (we are "mild heat" type of folks).

Needs a little water to help the broccoli cook through, but all in all, quite tasty.

Quick, easy and very good. I will wait and and the  orange zest with the broccoli next time so it's not quite so charred.

I didn't add orange zest because I didn't have any. I just steamed the broccoli and then added (without measuring) the orange juice, olive oil, pepper flakes and salt. I'm not a big broccoli person so I wouldn't give it a five, but I would make it again.

I did this recipe with tangerine instead of orange and it had a light and bright flavor. The red pepper flakes counterbalance the sweetness of the tangerine nicely.
