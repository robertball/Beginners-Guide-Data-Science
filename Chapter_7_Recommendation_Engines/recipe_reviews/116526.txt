I made these yesterday for a party and, everyone enjoyed them very much : )  It's amazing how much water there are in cucumbers.  Prior to cutting the cucumbers I lined a cookie sheet with acouple of layers of paper towels.  As I cut the cucumbers I placed them on the paper towels, then added two more layers of top.  It took out alot of the water and the topping stayed on great.

It was a great recipe and I WILL make them again.  They were very refreshing and different.

I honestly don't think these deserved more than 3 12/ stars but my guests thought they were OK & I can't give 3 & 1/2 so I'm giving four. I thought they were very bland & needed to be jazzed up some. I did sprinkle them w/ seasoning salt but didn't have time to tinker. In hindsight, I think a bit of curry powder might be an asset to the recipe. Thanks anyway Phyllis Pollock!

This is not very good.
It was very bland, however once i added mustard it tasted a lot better.

These were a hit at my New Years Eve party.  I was looking for something light to counter balance all of the heavy traditional appetizers served when it's cold outside.  I was concerned that the mixture would be too runny so I substituted softened cream cheese for the sour cream and it worked beautifully.  If you allow the cucmbers to "dry out" a bit after slicing its easier to keep the mixture on the top with no trouble.  One of my friends suggested slicing the cuke a bit thicker and then scooping out a sight divit from the center with a melon baller.  Personally, that sounds like too much work when you're preparing mulitple appetizers for a party. :)

My friends and I loved it! I used regular sour cream and pineapples. I left out the salt...but ate it with chips.

I thought it could have a thicker texture to keep it on the cucumber, but good taste.

These were a great springtime treat.  I took them to a dinner party that we go to once a month and they were a big hit.  One person even said that they don't like cucumbers, but they couldn't stop eating them.
