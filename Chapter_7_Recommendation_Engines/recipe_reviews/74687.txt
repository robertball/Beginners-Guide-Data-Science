The flavors in this salad are 10-star. A little heavy on the dressing and blue cheese - I used a lighter hand. Also used walnuts because I didn't have pecans. Excellent salad - my guys all raved. Thanks!

Simple to make. Used real bacon bits instead of frying the bacon. Toast the pecans for added flavor. Used Trader Joe's balsamic vinegarette. Will make this for company again in a few days.

So good. In the interest of time, used bottle dressing and did not marinate the apples, just peeled, chopped, put in the bowl with other ingredients.  Used baby spinach instead of lettuce because I had on hand.  Didn't  measure the salad dressing, just added and tossed as normal.  The bowl was wiped clean!

this is (basically) a salad I've made for years,everyone loves it! haven't used bacon, but why not! I use toasted pecans because I like them. 4 servings. 1/4 C walnut pieces, toasted 1 medium head Romaine, torn,  1/2 bunch watercress 1 large Granny Smith apple,cored & sliced thinly & brushed lightly with lemon juice  to prevent discolouration 4 ozs. Stilton, crumbled. Dressing: whisk 6  TBLspns. olive oil, 3 TBLspns. raspberry or Balsamic vinegar, salt & pepper to taste,  in small bowl. when ready to serve, toss greens with dressing, arrange on plate. arrange apple slices around the edges, (pointy ends to centre)  sprinkle with cheese, top centre with nuts. This presentation is most attractive.  (I feel the photo is a bit of a mish mash!) serve immediately. D.

Really good.  Nice combination of flavors and textures.  Next time use less dressing (1 cup was too much; made everything soggy; pool on the bottom of the bowl).

Made my own balsamic vinaigrette.  Made it with a HUGE bowl of romaine lettuce.  We were having an "Italian night" so the seasoning on the BBQ pork chops was Italian, and I served it with lightly buttered fusili.  Family raved over it!

This was very good! Great flavors. I used pre-cooked bacon which made it a snap. I used Ken's Balsalmic vinaigrette on the apple and didn't have the time to marinate for a full hour. It was more like 20 minutes and it was still awesome! Thanks for a great salad!

I like this salad for lunch.  It's not too heavy, and hits most of the food groups so nutrition is good.  I use a reduced fat blue cheese to make it even more healthy.

Amazing!  The only thing I will do different next time I make this is add more bacon, but that is only my personal preference.  Great recipe, great flavor!

I like to add finely sliced red onion - or even caramelized red onion to this recipe, it really adds yet another unique flavor.   With balsamic, you never need this much dressing, but that is all according to each person's taste.  :-)

I've made a variation of this salad for years.  I don't mix the apply and dressing first, I just pour the dressing on right before serving.  I also add some dried cranberries and use leftover roast chicken rather than bacon.  if you want a lighter salad, just leave out the chicken.

The bacon was the saving grace but I will not make this again.  The balsamic vinaigrette was over powering taking away from the flavors.  I threw a lot of this away.  In addition, it is ugly.

This is one of the best salads for when you want a meal but not a heavy one...the only thing I do different is I poach a chicken breast in apple juice then slice it and arrange it on the top of the salad.

I thought this was really good and received several compliments.  The only thing that I had a problem with was the blue cheese which seemed really strong especially when you consider the intensity of the balsamic dressing and the bacon.  I added a big handful of dried cranberries which seemed to help.  This salad does not keep well so don't mix more than you need.  Overall, it was great and I will definitely make again, but with a little less cheese.

this was amazing... just like at a restaurant. I also used walnuts instead of pecans. For a salad this is very filling and super yummy. . . i have to go out today to get more blue cheese to have it again tonight.

Very good, but could have used less balsamic vinaigrette - maybe don't put all the dressing in when adding the apples.

I can't get enough of this salad. I didn't really care for the apples but my boyfriend did. I used the candied pecans instead of the regular ones. This is my favorite salad by far.

Love this salad!  I have made is numerous times for parties and every time I have gotten rave reviews.  I also add dried cranberries to the mix - delicious!!  Definitely marinate the green apples ahead of time.  They give the salad such great flavor.  I sometimes use regular bacon instead of turkey bacon.  Regular bacon is so much easier to cook without burning it.  Super easy to make!  You have to try this salad!!

This salad is great for a light lunch! I love it! Not to mention, it's simple and doesn't take many ingredients. I might place a sweeter dressing on it next time.  Fabulous!

I Loved this.  I took it to a pot luck and the bowl was wiped CLEAN!  I used a balsamic vingarette recipe from this site and left it on the side for people to add more if they wanted.  I've been waiting to get to the store so I can make this again!

I enjoyed this salad - it was a sweet change from my usual salad fixin's - but my husband isn't a big fan of blue cheese.  Perhaps I'll try feta cheese for a little lighter flavor next time.

Pretty good.  I think I'll leave the bacon out next time though, it kind of made it "heavy".  Used "Mamas Bal. Vin" recipe from this site.

I made this as a side for my women’s club Christmas luncheon. It was a huge hit. I prepared the apples the day before marinating in Ken’s balsamic vinaigrette.  I used spring mix since Romaine lettuce was unavailable and added candied pecans and craisins. It made a pretty presentation on a large platter. Lettuce scattered  with the nuts and craisins, apples placed on top, and marinade poured over all. Additional salad dressing was not needed but I did offer it to add as my guests desired. 
Yummy, pretty, and oh, so easy. For a main dish, I’d add grilled chicken.

Halved this recipe for my wife and myself. Big hit. A more conservative amount of dressing could be okay too. My inclination was to dice the apple but julianne was the right way, IMHO. Don’t skimp on the blue cheese.  Feta might make a reasonable sub.

I was so surprised how much I loved this salad!  I made two very minor changes.  I made my own balsamic vinaigrette and I used toasted walnuts instead of pecans, because I love walnuts with blue cheese.

Made it for my work potluck and it was a huge hit.  A large bowl was devoured.  I made the recipe as listed except used spring mix and pecans.  I used high quality balsamic and the sweetness was just right.

I loved the recipe, but I made one small change (which some of you might consider "big change"). I replaced the bacon with baked pepper (one red bell pepper put in the oven for about 20 minutes, then seeded and peeled, which is really easy once it's baked). I am not a vegetarian, and I love meat, but I think this combination is amazing. Enjoy!
