My tips, which are a summary from different readers' ratings below (thank you readers for your tips!!):  
Peel eggplant before slicing, and slice to 1/4 inch.
Add garlic to the egg/water mix.
Add red pepper flakes & parm cheese to the breadcrumbs.
Cook the eggplant for 10 minutes, flip, then top with what the recipe calls for, along with some lemon juice and fresh basil leaves.
ENJOY!  My husband would never eat eggplant until now!

I love eggplant, but had no recipes that weren't heavy and full of fat. 
As others suggested I baked the eggplant before adding the rest of the ingredients. While the it was baking I marinated slices of tomatoes in fat-free italian dressing and place them on top of each piece of eggplant along with the cheese and some fresh basil, then baked another few minutes. I left out the oil completely. What a wonderfully  flavored low fat side that will go with anything. I served it with grilled salmon and fresh spinach. Will definately make again!!

Outstanding recipe!!!!! I made some both with the mozzeralla and some without. My husband and I both liked the ones without the mozzarella cheese. Kept the tomatoes as slices instead of chopping; also added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning (just sprinkled on). Baked the eggplant before putting on the other toppings; also flipped them over so they would be the same texture on both sides. Used Italian breadcrumbs. Very filling recipe -- we didn't have room in our tummies for the main course after eating these.

My husband did the grocery shopping this week, and he came home with an eggplant...?!!  I was up to the challenge (never cooked one before), and allrecipes didn't fail me.  This was delicious!  I used Pam and aluminum foil instead of the olive oil.  Also, I baked them on each side about 7 minutes before adding the tomatoes, etc.  Some slices were 1/4 inch and some were 1/2 inch -- we prefered the thicker ones.

excellent! quick and easy, though I made some adjustments. I used less cheese and added some mozzarella.  I also mixed the tomatoes with the dressing, zested it up with some garlic powder and italian seasoning.  Used the mixture to spread over the eggplant.

fantastic.  easy, qucik & good.  make sure to cut the eggplant at least 1/'4".would suggest it to anyone who likes eggplant! thanks for posting.

for the people that like a hit of spice i mixed crushed  red pepper into the crumb mix along with other spices to give the breading its own flavor.

i also decided to put a thick slice of tomatoe on top of each cut eggplant and put a fresh basil leaf (1-2 depending on size of eggplant slice) and topped with parm, accompaning a light summer cream sauce pasta.

I thought this was delicious. I've never made eggplant before and for some reason thought it was so hard. I used canned petite diced tomatoes instead of sliced and I mixed them with half a jar of marinated artichoke hearts chopped very small. I baked for 7 minutes, flipped them and added the toppings and baked for another 9 minutes. My husband loved them and I'll for sure be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe as did everybody else.  My husband said it was just about the best eggplant he had ever tasted!  A friend fixed eggplant in a similar manner one time and I've wanted to find a recipe similar to it since then.  Like another person who reviewed this recipe I baked the eggplant first and then put the tomatoes on top finishing with the cheese.  Instead of plain bread crumbs I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  This is a wonderful recipe and I would recommend it for anyone!

My husband and I love this recipe. I like the fact that you don't have to fry the eggplant.  My only suggestion is to flip the slices over half way thru baking so they are golden brown on both sides.

Devine! This was my first time trying eggplant.  I added a bunch of minced garlic to the tomatos & let them marinade a bit in the Italian dressing before adding to the tops of the eggplant, and I substituted Parmesan out of a shaker.  As recommended, I baked the eggplant first and added toppings near the end.  As my 4 year old son ate it, he kept exclaiming, "I love eggplant!"

I liked it better when I fried them using a little bit more olive oil on the stovetop.  In the oven they were mushy and the breadcrumbs were slimy.  Put some of the same batch in a small pan with oil and it was crispy and good.  Took tomato mixture and put on top of eggplant once I turned them so they got a little heated up.  It was really good.

This was a very good recipe. Even my 3 year old son ate it. He's a picky little guy. I added pepper and oregano to the egg. I used Italian bread crumbs and added some Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs. I added some salt too, and I think that was a mistake. They were a bit salty. Next time, i won't add any salt. Very good. Thanks!!

My husband hates eggplant, so I rarely ever cook it. I made this recipe and he loved it!!!!  I'm so excited. We had it with filet and I prefered the eggplant over the steak, it's that good.  I didn't have Italian dressing so I used someone elses idea and substituted ranch. I'd give this one 10 stars if I could.

This is great, great, great!  We cook our eggplant a little longer then directed to get the texture we like.  It makes a great light dinner on those nights I work late.

Yum! I used canned diced tomatoes with olive oil & garlic and italian bread crumbs with some garlic salt to coat the egg plant. Baked for approx 10 minutes and then flipped and baked for an additional 10. Added the topping and warmed thru. Delicious!

Delicioso! I changed up the recipe a bit by mixing up the Parmesan with the breadcrumbs during the coating process to save time.  After the eggplant baked on both sides (10 minutes each side), I added sliced tomatoes (instead of chopped), shredded mozzarella, dressing and Italian herbs on top for an extra 5 minutes.  I haven't had eggplant since I was a kid and I don't remember it being so good!

Yummy! This is an easy way to cook up something tasty with the eggplant that's been in the fridge for a week! I used a can of stewed tomatos, would also recommend a longer cooking time, maybe 10 more minutes.

I loved this recipe. I am always looking for something new to do with Eggplant. I also had some zuccini and squash which I dipped in the egg and bread crumbs and piled on the eggplant and baked. I am sure a slice of Mozzerela on top would add to the yummy taste !!!! Kavitha Vasanth

This was to die for!  I used the entire eggplant, so I doubled the egg, water, and bread crumbs.  I lined the baking sheet with foil, so no oil was needed.  I didn't trim the skin (that's where the vitamins and fiber are!), and would definitely do that again!  (The skin was very tender after baking.)  Thanks for the recipe!

What a yummy change for eggplant! I sprayed the baking sheet with Pam olive oil spray. Kept some skin on by peeling stripes to keep the shape together. You don't really need to measure the ingredients, I did add garlic powder after breading. Could use some more spices too. My husband doesn't eat cheese so I added it to mine and we were both happy.

I used panko that was thorougly seasoned.  The coating adhered well.  I used vegetable oil and my only complaint was that the rounds were pretty greasy.  Next time I might try to just spray them with Pam.

This is a great recipe! I made a couple of modifications.

1) I'm trying to eliminate starch from my diet currently, so I replaced the breadcrumbs with almond meal.
2) Instead of oiling the cookie sheet, I used a silicone baking liner (less fat!).
3) I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used some tomato sauce we had left over in the fridge.

Very yummy and I will be making it again! :-)

I was leery about this but it was very good. I ground dried herbs on the top and it added so much flavor. Really good! Thanks for the recipe.

This is the ONLY eggplant DH likes.  He calls them Eggplant Pizzas.  I peel my eggplant FIRST to make it simpler, rather than after like the recipe calls for, and cut the slices a little thinner than 1/4 inch.  It makes the slices extra crispy.  I've even made them like this and then layered them in a pan with tomato sauce and mozzarella and made it like eggplant parmesan.

These were very tasty. I took the advice of other people and put them in the oven for ten minutes, flipped them, and then added the topping. I also mixed the tomatos and dressing before adding it to the eggplant. I think that with a longer cooking time they would be even better- I like it when the eggplant is super soft. 
Thanks!

This is very good, I had to cook mine for a little longer at the lower setting to get them soft enough...they came out great!  Terrific to accompany any meal.

Delicious!! I marinated the tomatoes in the italian dressing about an hour before I made this. Also, I suggest using a farm grown eggplant that you grow yourself or get from the farmer's market; you just can't beat it. Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!!

Not too hard to make and quite good... could add a little fresh basil to the mix.

So tasty and easy! I wanted to cut down the fat content so I used canola spray to grease the baking sheet. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and I put crushed red pepper flakes and parm cheese in the breadcrumbs. I also added a salt and next time I'll add garlic powder. I baked each side for 10 minutes and then  I put a mixture of italian dressing marinated tomatoes, parm cheese and a sprinkle of salt, basil and italian seasoning on top. broiled it for 5 minutes. really good. next time I'll add more topping.

This was so good and my first time cooking with eggplant.  The only changes I made were to slice the tomato instead of chopping, and, as per other reviewers, I baked 10 mins on one side, flipped and baked for 10 mins more.  I added tomato (which had soaked in italian dresing for 10 mins) to the top of each slice on the second flip.  Sprinkled that with parmesan cheese and a little chopped fresh basil.  Yummy.

This was very enjoyable with just (for me) the right hint of flavor.  The only thing that would have been over the top for me was if the eggplant came out crispy.  I will have to see if I can make that happen.  Will make again...and again..and again.

I planted eggplant in the garden this year, not even quite certain whether I liked the vegetable to begin with.  This was the first recipe I tried.  I used one young eggplant instead of part of a large eggplant.  I did add a few sprinkles of mozzarella in addition to the listed ingredients.  The results were absolutely delicious: I ate the entire eggplant!!

This was a very easy recipe but it is definitely missing something.  I made it as a side dish and was very disappointed as to how bland it was.  Eggplant is very bland as it is and to just add breadcrumbs, tomotoes and cheese did nothing to give it any more flavor.  I will probably make it again but will add some italian spices and slice the eggplant very thin so the flavors can all come thru.

My husband I both agreed that it would have been bland if we didn't add Zesty Italian Dressing, which gives this dish its flavor.  I cooked 8 minutes and flipped the breaded eggplant and then added all the toppings before finishing with another 8 minutes followed by a 4-minute broil.  I used two eggs and the whole eggplant and I still felt it wasn’t enough to cover the eggplant thoroughly.  Leftovers were great in the microwave, took 2-3 minutes covered and I thought it tasted better because the eggplant was more cooked (not tough). Peeled or unpeeled, didn’t make a difference.

i have been looking for new things to do with eggplant this time of year.  the italian dressing definitely was a change in flavor from the usual.  i used a whole eggplant and upped the amount of parmesan...but otherwise pretty much stuck to the recipe as written.  i liked it a lot, but my husband wasn't wowwed.  it is definitely easy enough to make, and i will probably make again.  thanks for the recipe.

YUMMM I tried both sliced tomatoes and diced, I liked the diced better easier to cut thru w/ a fork.  I also flipped mine half way through and even cooked em toppingless afterwards for a bout 4 mins, then added the rest of the ingredients. Also I did not have all shred. parm. on hand so I subbed some w/ Mozz and a few i sprinkled with Feta. To the Feta version I added sliced olives and those were great as well, oh and all had a bit of fresh basil, super easy and quick.

These were fantastic. I followed the comment summary that pump0701 provided (thank you). I didn't use any cheese to lower the cal and fat - still tasted wonderful alongside mesquite pork chops.

Mine came out still a bit hard even though I followed what some people said here. I baked for 10 minutes on one side and flipped it and baked another 10 minutes with my ingredients on the other side and the broiled for 5 minutes. 

Just wasn't very flavorful and wasn't really a hit with my guy.

I LOVED THIS.   I followed the recipe exactly and LOVED it.   My husband claims he will NEVER eat eggplant but i sliced the egg plant as suggested and covered a few slices with havarti cheese after it was almost done (because we happened to have some) and he was begging me to make it again (he didn't know it was eggplant though, until days later...haha)

wonderful.  I used the long thin eggplant (fresh from friends garden) and fresh small tomatoes.  Also only had Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  They were finger food I would not hesitate to take to a party.  I would not make these with store bought tomatoes.

As is, this recipe is really good! I made a few changes for a little extra flavor. I added paremsan to the bread crumb mixture, as well as garlic and onion powders, paprika, and ground red pepper. While the (peeled) eggplant was baking in the oven, I made a nice tomato sauce with lots of garlic. I had a bit of bread crumb left over, so I threw it in the sauce. Instead of broiling, I turned the heat in the oven to 425 for about 7 extra minutes. These were fabulous with pasta and sauce and WONDERFUL as a "burger" on a bun, with a slice of provolone and a ladle of tomato sauce. I made up extra, wrapped them (2 in each package) in plastic and froze them for delicious healthy meals in a hurry.  This is my favorite eggplant recipe...kudos to the submitter! We love it!

very good recipe. had to change it a bit due to lack of ingredients. used panko bread crumbs mixed with a little oregano. this made it a very good texture. also i used swiss cheese because i didnt have parmesan. it was very goood
i did however bake the eggplants dipped in panko for 20 minutes, then added the tomato baked for 7 minutes then added the cheese baked for another 7-10 minutes. i hate it when the eggplant is hard. this way it was soft with a crunchy outside from the panko bread crumbs :)

I made this recipe with a lot of compliments from my whole family. I didn't save it in my recipe box and I had to find it again. All I remembered was that you said something about your girlfriend liking it in your introduction. This is such a good recipe that I will make again and again. Thank you so much!!

This ended up tasting delicious!  I took note of the other reveiws on cooking the eggplant longer.  I did 11 minutes on one side, flipped them over, put on the topping and cooked another 11 minutes.  I broiled for seven minutes to get the tomatoes and cheese a little browned.  To compensate for the dryness mentioned in other reviews I added a tsp of olive oil to the egg mixture and used really ripe halved cherry tomatoes. Instead of Italian I used Amy's Goddess Dressing.  I also had a zucchini lying around and used it too.  I liked the zucchini even better than the eggplant!

This was easy and my family loved it, even the kids. I soaked the eggplant slices in salt water prior to breading.  I used milk instead of egg, and dried Italian herbs instead of the salad dressing. BAKE LONGER for BEST RESULTS. I would reccommend serving this with something a little more saucy. I made pasta and Alfredo sauce and put the eggplant on top.  It is very dry and needs another dish to compliment it. Definitely, worth a try.

I always enjoy this recipe, and I make the whole eggplant - not sure what one third of an eggplant is all about!  Of course that requires an extra egg and crumbs.

DE-LI-CIOUS!!! My husband and daughter (22 months old) just loved it!!!, it was so easy to make and so delicious at the end, a friend gave me the eggplant and didn't know what to do with them, now, I'll make this recipe every week!. I mixed the tomatoes with the dressing and the cheese, and put some basil leafs on each slice.

Surprisingly good!  It was a comedy of errors the night we made this.  I didn’t have breadcrumbs so I used crushed saltines.  I ran out of Italian dressing so I substituted the rest with balsamic.   And somehow, O was also out of egg so used milk to dip instead.  Despite my poor planning we all loved the recipe.

These where amazing!!! my son got to pick some things to add to our garden this year, and eggplant was one of them.  We made these with only one small change and that was to add mozzarella cheese to the top.  We both agreed they were like healthy pizzas.  We will be making these again and again.  This recipe made it into my all time favorite folder!  (Not and easy thing to do)  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Just like the name says.  I made it very fast.  My husband and I loved the flavor and texture.  What a healthy snack.  I suggest peeling the eggplant before slicing to save time.

This recipe is awesome!  My first time ever cooking eggplant, and it turned out just fabulous.  Simple, quick, and delicious dinner.  My boyfriend ate 5 slices and said, "Are there more of these things somewhere?"  Even my three-year-old son asked for more.  

Note: I did follow the suggestions to mix garlic in with the egg mixture and to flip the eggplant over 10 minutes through the baking cycle.  Easy cheesy.

I love this recipe!!  We just added some salt and pepper to the topping!  EASY!!  I even got my 4 year old to help (The eggplant's skin that you trim away makes a great bracelet).  The thinner the slices the crispier the pieces. Serve hot because once these cool down, they are still good but not AMAZING good!!

Amazing! I chopped the tomatoes and added some dried basil (I would have used fresh if I had had it, but , no...) and otherwise followed the directions. Huge hit at home! Can't wait to try this one w/ friends.

I'm giving it 5 stars because I made some changes and would give it 4 - but I made changes so that isn't fair.  Anyway - I didn't have any tomatoes in the house - so instead I used an oregano, basil canned diced tomatoes mix.  I skipped the dressing.  I skinned the eggplant first, then sliced into 1/4" pieces.  I did the egg/water and then italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I baked for about 8 minutes per side.  (i did flip them) - then after 8 minutes on side 2 I topped with canned tomatoes and shredded parm.  It was good - but a little boring so I added some crushed red pepper flakes to ours.  Couple of things I want to do for next time....maybe try mozzerella.  Maybe try some extra spices.  Slice the pieces a little thinner - and if making as an app - try to find a thin long eggplant.  Although - I liked the larger rounds because folding it around the tomatoes was really yummy.  Maybe I just needed more tomatoes - which leads me to the fact that next time...I want to do the tomato slice as others mentioned.  That sounds good!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it. I've given it 4 stars as the breading and tomato (I used canned Italian and no dressing) was tasty... just can't say that I will ever try eggplant again :(

I picked a fresh organic eggplant and tomatoes from my garden. My hubby refused to eat it (meat and tatters man) but i convinced him to just try one bite and he really liked it.  I didn't have any bread to make crumbs so I used wheat crackers and it was fine. I left the skin on because when I was in Italy this summer that's the way they served their eggplant.  I went with someone's suggestion of putting garlic in the egg and parmesan cheese in the crumbs. I will make this again.  Thank you Lotting123 for the recipe and Wanda for the lovely picture!

I thought it was tasty not my favorite though. But I served as one of the appetizers for an italian dinner party and everyone raved and loved them.  I used italian breadcrumbs and added fresh basil and thyme from my garden. Needed to be cooked 10min longer than recipe called for. Thanks

DELICIOUS! Used one small eggplant and Olive Oil cooking spray instead of oil.  Baked on one side 10 minutes and then turned and sprinkled with garlic powder and drizzled with Italian dressing.  Baked 10 minutes, then topped with cheese and tomatoes. Next broiled for about 2 minutes. Parmesan cheese got a little hard. Will try again with Mozarella. Yummy either way.

Excellent! I did sweat my eggplant for about a half an hour because I was worried they would be soggy. Two very minor tweaks... I used seasoned breadcrumbs and shredded parmesan instead of grated. Great flavor, crunchy coating. Yum! Thanks :)

Very good and low calorie too! Followed the reviews to add garlic to the egg mixture and cook the eggplant without the topping for ten minutes. After flipping them, I added the topping and cooked for another 5 minutes then broiled for 4 minutes to melt the Parm cheese. Also used cooking spray on the pan instead of oil and used italian bread crumbs for the eggplant. The only other change I made was marinating the tomatoes in the Italian dressing while the eggplant roasted and adding some chopped fresh basil to compliment the tomatoes.

Very good!  Next time, I'll salt the eggplant first (mine was bitter).  This requires you to slice the eggplant and then generously coat with salt.  You let it sit for half an hour in order to give the salt time to draw out the "bitter waters".  You rinse and cook however you like.

This review isn't going to be very deep.  I just wanted to say that this is the best eggplant recipe I have tried.  The entire family absolutely loves it!  Some of the other suggestions for subtle changes in the recipe are helpful also.

Just made this for dinner...and LOVED it!  Very simple and tasty!  I added balsamic vinegar to the eggs instead of water, used diced cherry tomatoes mixed with balsamic vinegarette salad dressing and grated romano cheese as the topping.  I cut my eggplant rounds about 1/2 inch thick and baked for 20 mins.  Came out perfect.  These were a hit and would also make a great appetizer! YUM!

Nice.. We loved this recipe.  I did make some changes as suggested by others.  The drudging in flour before putting in the egg mixture (to which I added garlic powder).  And instead of baking, I actually fried it with some olive oil (due to time constraints).  I took this to lunch with the inlaws and they loved it (even my sister in law liked it until we told her it was eggplant - she is stupid like that).  We will definately make this one again!

I thought this was very good.  I added some spices (garlic salt, pepper, oreagano, basil) to the bread crumbs to make it tastier.  Everyone loved it even my 4 year old.  I thought it was a little bland.  I also cooked it a little longer and turned them halfway before adding the tomatoes etc. as others had suggested.

Wonderful!  I didn't take the skin off the eggplant and it was just as tasty.  I cooked it a bit longer and it was delicious!

Instead of fresh tomatos I used a can of Rotel and it was very good and gave it a spicy kick!

Thank you!

The flavor in this dish was so-so. I wish I would of read the reviews before I made this dish and cooked LONGER. I followed the recipe exactly and the eggplant slices were too hard.

Very good and easy!  My MIL even asked for the recipe, which is quite a compliment b/c she is the ultimate cook. The Italian dressing was a little too concentrated in spots.  Next time I'll either use a thinner dressing or mix the dressing with the tomatoes to get a more uniformed taste.

We thought this was pretty good, but I didn't have any Italian salad dressing and used herb & garlic marinade instead, which made it pretty overpowering.  But my husband said it was good.  Please PLEASE peel the skins, as the directions state!  I followed someone else's suggestion and didn't peel.  Maybe theirs had more tender skin, but mine was TOUGH and there was no way you could chew it.

I disliked eggplant until now.  I enjoyed it very much.  I started to skin the eggplant and felt it was time consuming so I did 1/2 skinned and 1/2 with skin (didn't tell the difference so I will leave skin on next time.

I'm not fond of eggplant so I made it for someone. Of course, I had to taste it and it was delicious. Others who tasted it also said it was delicious. The dressing I used was homemade...balsamic vinaigrette with italian seasoning. It was an Eggplant Bruscetta (however its spelled)!

Made as stated - except used Italian bread crumbs (all I had) and  I sprayed with a little bit of organic canola oil pam spray right before broiling - looked like it might have been to dry to brown on top and sides.  DELICIOUS!!!!!

This was super easy and really yummy. I made a few adjustments for what I had on had. I left out the Italian dressing and sprayed with olive oil, used Italian bread crumbs to coat with a few extra seasonings, and put chopped green onions on top with the tomatoes. No parmesan in the fridge so I used provolone.

I added some mozzarella for the final broil step. A dab of pesto at the end was really good (I used it instead of Italian dressing).

This is a great dish. First time ever to try egg plant but it won't be the last. I did as others suggested; bake plain for 10 minutes, then dip in wet mixture (egg, water, some garlic powder), then dry mixture (bread crumbs, cheese, red pepper flakes). Baked for  another 8 minutes, then put sliced tomatoes on top and a little more cheese. Broiled for about 3 minutes until cheese was melted. Delicious. Did not use any dressing.

My first eggplant! I followed the directions until I realized that I did not have any Italian dressing. AND I did not have enough breadcrumbs. I did use Panko. I just love the crunch. Some of mine were breaded with regular Panko crumbs and some with Italian crumbs. I sprayed them with olive oil and sprinkled garlic salt on them. When they were done, we tried one and thought they were good but that they needed more cheese. We added a slice of Mozzarella to each one and then put them back under the broiler. This made them even better. I kept saying I thought I should put more tomato on top of them, but my daughter insisted that I didn't need to. But then she got some spaghetti sauce and started dipping her bites into it. That was good too, but I still think more tomatoes would have done the trick. I can't wait to try this again when I have the Italian dressing. I know it will be even better.

This was a huge hit!!!  Baked it for 10 minutes first like someone suggested.  It was wonderful!  Will be a great summertime staple when the eggplant is plentiful in Georgia.

This was my first time making eggplant at home. I used Panko breadcrumbs and left out the Italian dressing, and it was amazing! I put them under the broiler for 2 minutes on each side after baking for 15 minutes. The outside was so crunchy. This is a keeper!

This is a keeper. I made it tonight and doubled the recipe. I followed with suggestions from others (Peeled eggplant before slicing, and sliced to 1/4 inch. Cooked the eggplant for 10 minutes with nothing on it in the oven, then Added garlic to the egg/water mix. Added red pepper flakes & parm cheese to the breadcrumbs)Then dipped in egg mixture & bread crumbs and from there followed the recipe as it said. Everyone loved it.

We loved this recipe! We used Italian eggplants which are smaller.  Also, we didn't have any Parmesan so we used Gruyere.  It was an absolute hit!

It was good.  I went ahead and followed the advice of some people:  Bake for 10 min, flip the slices, add the tomato mixture, bake for 10 min, broil for 2 min.  I added some chopped artichoke hearts to the tomatoes because i needed to use them.  I also marinated the tomatoes/artichokes in the italian dressing with a dash of balsamic vinegar and some fresh basil while the eggplant was cooking.  I used italian style breadcrumbs because that is what i had and added some garlic powder and parm cheese to them.  I also sprinkled sundried tomato feta cheese on top along with the parm cheese.  Overall very good and will make again.

I love eggplant, and I was looking for a really good recipe that would highlight the taste while not covering it. Unfortunately this recipe, while it sounded promising, did not really deliver that for me. I thought it tasted like "eggplant paremesan light" which is probably great for some people, but just not my taste. The good thing was that my husband, who really dislikes eggplant was able to eat this and enjoy it!

I put a little too much dressing-a dab goes a long way! I followed suggestions of other viewers and baked the breaded eggplant for 10 minutes before I added the parm, tomato and dressing. Then I put them back in the oven for another 10-15 min and skipped the broil step altogether. Soo tasty--my husband and brother ate them up.

This recipe - as is - is 5 star all the way.  I added parm to the seasoned bread crumbs.  I cut my eggplant 1/4 in. thickness.  Next time I would marinate the diced fresh tomato in a italian dressing sauce.  Make sure the ital. dressing is top quality.

really good.  omitted oil and used cooking spray to grease pans.  used fat free italian dressing.  baked eggplant on both sides to allow for crispness before adding topping for additional 3-4 minutes.  so easy and always a hit.

This was absolutely delicious! My husband and both of my sons (even the picky one) enjoyed it.  I didn't have tomotoes so I used some sundried tomato pesto instead.  My family said it was like having little pizzas! I'll will definitely make this again.

I really didn't like this at all.  I thought it was really bland and pretty dry.  Maybe I'm not a huge fan of eggplant but I think I'll try to find another recipe.  I won't make this again.

This turned out delicious.  After breading, I sprinkled freshly grated parmesan cheese on each piece.  I poured a little balsamic dressing over some of them to try, and it was tasty.  I used Italian style Panko bread crumbs.  I chose not to use the tomatoes.  I'd make again!

Very good.  Our family loved this.  The only thing we preferred was not having the italian dressing on them (all of us) and not having the tomatoes on them (hubby) and we are all tomato lovers.  I personally will make these again but next time we'll just leave off the tomatoes and dressing.  I did use italian breadcrumbs and also topped with a little mozzerella cheese and parmesean.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It was my first time making eggplant :)

I was looking for a light recipe for eggplant and I made this into one and it was really good.  I sprayed the pan with olive oil, prepared the eggplant as directed except...instead of the salad dressing I used "Italian Dressing Mix" from allrecipes.com, in the dry form, and just sprinkled it on lightly, then baked as directed.  We loved it!

This was very tasty and easy.  I used Panko bread crumbs and cooked for 5 minutes longer.  I served it with angel hair pasta and red sauce.

I loved this recipe! So easy to make and nice and crunchy without the added oil. I'll make this again.

In the "do ahead" preparation, I found that setting the oven to 275F and cooking for about 25 minutes is best.[grill for 1 or 2 min just before serving]
Also, use a good quality balsamic vinegar, instead of water, in the egg coating and skip additional dressing.
Additionally, I used some left-over garlic bread crumbs which gave it extra zip.
Finally, DO trim the skin before baking!  The outer casing of aubergine is tough and bitter.

This lived up to its name! I used a very light breading and topped with a little extra cheese. Next time I will add a bit more tomato.

I changed the recipe a little.  I added garlic oil to the egg mixture and added parmesean cheese to the bread crumb mixture.  I also used italian breadcrumbs and left the tomatoes in slices rather than diced.  I placed a basil leaf on top of the tomato.  Overall the eggplant was delicious, but remember to eat them right away, as they will get soggy in about 1 hour.

this was a nice change from the original bruschetta.  i made a few changes.  i peeled and seeded the tomatoes (i used ugly/heirloom, not plum). i added pressed garlic, the juice of half a lemon, and salt, and pepper to the tomatoes. i let them sit as long as possible to let the flavors meld.  i did not use italian dressing at all.  i floured the eggpant before egging.  i added parm cheese and italian seasonings to the breadcrumb mixture.  i baked the eggplant first before topping with tomatoes and then baked again.  i topped it with fresh basil and parm cheese.  finally, i made a balsamic glaze by adding equal amounts of sugar and balsamic vinegar to a pot on  the stovetop, heating until the sugar is disoved, then putting in the freezer until cool.  for a less sweet glaze, use half the sugar.  i am still playing with the oven temp and time, but i have enjoyed this veyr much, thank you!

I think this has potential.  Perhaps I needed to leave it in the oven a bit longer before broiling it.  It wasn't quite as soft as I anticipated.

Very good, thanks! I took the advice of some other posters and cooked a bit longer on each side. Needed a little something, maybe add some of your fav. spices? Even my 7 year old would eat it!

I made the recipe almost as instructed.  To lower the calories and fat I sprayed the pan with pam instead of oiling it, and I used fat-free Italian Dressing.  I also used canned chopped tomatoes to save prep time.  I followed the cooking instructions and they were perfect - crisp on the outside - great topping!  I was pleased!  Thank you!

This is one of those dishes where people fight for the last piece.  So simple to make and such a hit with the family.  Definately something that I will be making for the next get-together.

These were good!
I baked them about 8 minutes longer than the recipe says, and I added Italian spices and crushed red pepper to the bread crumbs.  I also placed a portabella mushroom slice on each one when they were half done and then added feta cheese and some parmesan. My kids even liked them, until I told them they were eating eggplant.  :)

Very nice.  I added feta cheese and chopped garlic for some extra pizazz.  I found the thicker sliced eggplant a bit soggier than the thinner ones.
