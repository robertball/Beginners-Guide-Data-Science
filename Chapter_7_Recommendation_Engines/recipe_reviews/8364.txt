We all loved this. I used 1/2 c rum in the cake because of the other reviews that said you could not taste it with the 1/3. We enjoyed it. I thought the glaze was going to be too strong when I first made it but it mellowed nicely overnight.

We all loved this.  I also used 1/2 cup rum in the batter, but only 1 tbsp and the rest water in the icing. The whole thing was eaten including the crumbs.  It is a very rich and dense cake.  Delicious!

The zucchini does make this a very moist cake.  It is very tasty as chocolate cakes go.  The rum in the cake itself is pretty much undetectible, but in the glaze it is overpowering.  Next time I would skip the glaze and just dust with powdered sugar.

Really, really good!  This cake came out very moist.  Nobody would believe there was zucchini in it.  This could be a new favorite of mine!

I made this for a big family gathering yesterday and never told them it had zucchini until after they ate it. Everyone was so suprised. They loved the cake.

Moist, but not too moist. Perfect chocolate flavour. Added additional 3/4 cup of flour and used 1/2 cup of rum for high altitude baking. Cake is tastier the following day. Thank you for recipe!

Super good and moist.  I didn't have any white rum so I used Captain Morgan instead and I used a different Butter/sugar/rum glaze.

Followed recipe exactly.  Cake was raw in the middle.  I had to keep putting it back in the oven for about 30 minutes extra...total of 1.5 hrs.  What a mess.

I added only the confectioners' sugar on top instead of the rum/glaze and I put Quik instead of cocoa powder. It was good, I would fix it again.

FABULOUS recipe. I will hang onto this one! Loved the undetectable, moist addition of the zucchini; the subtle rum flavor; the chocolate...    I added a tablespoon of cocoa powder to the glaze to make it an all-chocolate cake, and I included 1/2 cup of rum in the batter. Other than that, no changes necessary. :)

I'm not sure what went wrong, but my cake turned out a little on the dry side. However, it was very yummy and everyone loved the extra chocolate the chips added. I served it warm with ice cream to cover up the dryness. It was a big hit!

This is my favourite way of eating zucchini! I have made it several times already. Instead of rum I have tried Grand Marnier - I prefer the rum! Great recipe.

Great recipe.  I forgot the milk the 1st time I made this and it was just a little drier.  The 2nd time,  with milk, it was moister and required an extra 15 minutes of baking.  I used Captain Morgan's spiced rum for the cake and 4-5T coconut flavored rum in the icing.  I'll try the 1T cocoa powder added in the icing the next one.  Very yummy.

I made this yesterday for a family gathering, and it was very moist and tasty; however, the picture shows a chocolate glaze, and the recipe just calls for confectioners sugar and rum, so it is a white glaze. Did get lots of compliments on it though, so I would make again.

I used a cake mix and just added the extra bits of flavor.
Forgot the cinnamon in the cake so put it in the glaze.
It was a hit.

I made this based on the great reviews and the reviews were very accurate!!  Great cake!  When I make a new recipe for the first time I always make it as given.  I was not disappointed with this one.  I don't care for rum so did not make the rum glaze but did use it  in the batter (wasn't noticeable).

This cake is very good and can really be a blank slate for whatever inclusions you wish to add. It is very moist and keeps well for a few days. I used the suggestions to add the 1/2 cup rum and was glad I did. I didn't have chocolate chips so added dried cherries and toasted almonds in the same proportions as the chocolate chips and walnuts, which worked really well with the chocolate and rum flavors. Will definitely make again

Made it this weekend for a dinner i hosted. Everybody loved it. I did add 1/2 cup of rum to it. I did not use the glaze. Sprinkled powdered sugar. Bundt was sweet enough without glaze. Couple minutes after eating it everybody was getting cheerie. I wonder why?

I have made this cake twice now altering the amount of rum slightly.  I would definitley go with 1/2 cup from now on (and there will definitely be a "now on!") I also changed the ratio of water to rum in the glaze (3 to 1) as others recommended.  Other than those slight alterations, this cake is outstanding. Both times I served it for guests and both times it got rave reviews. I can't say much more that what's already been said here except, try it.  This is a clear winner.
