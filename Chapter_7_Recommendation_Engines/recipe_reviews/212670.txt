I increased the servings to 8 first.  I simmered the rice in chicken stock instead of water.  I sauted 2.5 oz of slivered almonds in the butter until golden.  I added one pkg of chopped  white mushrooms and a cup of chopped onion to the almonds.   I added that  to the cooked rice.  
Those additions made what was probably a great rice recipe into one of the best wild rice recipes I have ever tasted!

I made this for Christmas for my extended family... first Christmas in charge of the bird/ first Christmas married!  Everyone was raving about this recipe!  The bird looks so good, and it tastes wonderful.  A couple of adjustments I made:  I added 1 can of cream of mushroom because other reviewers said the recipe was sometimes dry.  Also, I added in the rest of my stuffing from stuffed mushrooms I had made the night before.  Combined with a oil, vinegar, and rosemary marinade = perfection!

This is a great simple recipe. The wild rice has a unique flavor and when paired with the hen it's wonderful. When you are in the mood for something different this is a great recipe to turn to. I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful this dish was. It certainly was not dry as the other reviewer suggested. If you think that's going to be an issue roast it breast side down. Thanks for a great recipe!

If you want a more flavorful rice, sautee onions and mushrooms with 3-4 minced garlic cloves.  Instead of cooking rice in plain flat water, use half chicken broth and half amber beer.  When mixing rice with sauteed mushrooms mixture, add also some dry cranberries and/or slivered almonds.  Stuff the hen(s).  To avoid that meat/rice dries out, baste hen(s) often with a mixture 1 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup dry white wine, juice of one lemon and 3 tbsp of melted butter.  You won't regret it!

I used this recipe on 2 hens (b/c that is how they were packaged) also used brown rice and used beef stock instead of water and added 1 tsp of both tarragon and sage to mushrooms as they cooked... my husband was IN LOVE!!  I'd even use the same seasoning on Chicken Thighs and roast them on finished mushroom rice!!

Very tastey and easy to make. I would make this again. The only disappointment I had was that the rice around the opening became dry and had a texture as if it wasn't cooked. Next time in addition to tying the legs together I'm going to do something better to keep the rice around the opening from being exposed while cooking to keep all of it moist and tender as it is delicious and worth eating. I cooked the rice in chicken broth instead of water and seasoned it lightly. I also dribbled the pan drippings over the finished hen too for a finishing touch.

Hen was great and moist.  I baked it in a glass covered dish and put a pan of water underneath it on lower shelf to help ensure moisture.  Didnt love the rice though.  Next time I plan to make some mushroom rice in a separate pot and put stuffing inside the hen.

Temp too high..reduce to 350.  Also, cover the stuffing with tin foil while baking..reduces drying out.  If the legs and wings look too brown during cooking..cover them with tin foil. Baste every 20 min.  I made a compound butter of herbs d'provance and basted the tiny lovelies leaving out lemon juice (my husband doesn't like savory and citrus)and wine..wine tends to dry out things (as another reviewer commented as adding). Check the internal temp of Stuffing not bird. Juices should run clear. It should read 165 F. Put the birds on a wire rack..setting on base of pan will cause inadequate roasting.  If you roast always use a roasting pan or wire rack. I also used a lot of the other comments made and checked online as well.

The hen itself was very good, although I made sure to check it early to ensure it wouldn't dry out.  The rice was a little bland and dry....I will try more seasonings with that next time.  It was a good Sunday afternoon meal...one you can surely take a nap after!

I was craving wild rice and had Cornish Hens in the freezer, but I didn't just want to make wild rice so I tried this out.  For anyone who says the bird was dry, you cooked it too long or failed to baste it with anything, it has nothing to do with the oven temp.  Modifications:  I sauteed diced onions, carrots, garlic and the mushrooms, splashed with a bit of white wine before adding the rice, which I did a half & half mix of brown & wild rice, cooked in 3/4 water to 1/4 chicken stock and a small pat of butter (your measurements will vary depending on how much you make).I left the rice a little watery on purpose- that cooks out in the bird.  I do not like poultry seasoning or rosemary, so I just hit the bird with salt & pepper.  I set it breast side DOWN on top of some rough cut onions, garlic & carrots, with a few of the mushroom slices thrown in.  Roasted for 20 minutes then poured on a mix of white wine, chicken stock, lemon juice & melted butter and let it go about 20 more minutes before I started testing the temp.  Once it was where I wanted it, I took it out, set it aside and made some gravy with the pan juices.  Again, for anyone saying this was bland, you aren't very creative.  The only downfall (if you can even call it that) was that I had too much rice mix.  I just put it into an oven-proof ramekin, covered with foil and baked right along side the bird.  Served it with roasted carrots and called it dinner :-)

I have never really liked wild rice but my husband does so I tried this recipe and loved it! I added sautéed onions, garlic, mushrooms, as well as walnuts and dried cranberries to the rice, salted to taste. Will make this again!

This is a fabulous romantic dinner for 2. We roasted Brussels sprouts with the rice stuffed chicken. I substituted the dried seasoning with fresh bunched together on top of the stuffing. Prepped the bird with EVOO, salt, pepper and herbs de Provence which made it very flavorful, tender and juicy.

I used the crockpot and added green beans and cream of chicken & mushroom to top them off.  3 hours on high,  2 hours on low and dinner was served.  Everyone loved the creamy base with rice and green beans and the herbs added to the flavor.  I used 4 hens and generously rubbed them down inside and out with rosemary and thyme.  Instant favorite!

This was absolutely delicious! The wild rice paired perfectly with the bird. I added a little feta to the wild rice at the end and my family loved it. Saving this one for the books.

This is a great meal to visually impress your guests without taking you away from entertaining your guests.

As I am primarily interested in the taste of the main focus, the hen, I omitted the thyme and rosemary. And I added a tablespoon of minced garlic as I sautéed a pound of mushrooms added to the cooked rice, before stuffing the hens.

My brother and I really enjoyed the meal and will be having it again soon.

This recipe was good. Added the cranberries like another person suggested. Also added chicken broth and seasonings to  taste to the rice and the cornish hens.

I did increase the seasoning in the rice mixture as well as on top the hens. As I cooked 6 hens they took much longer to cook at least 30-40 minutes more ( all hens in 1 pan) 
We enjoyed it and guests were impressed
