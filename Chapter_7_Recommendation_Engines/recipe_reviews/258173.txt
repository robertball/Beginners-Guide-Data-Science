This recipe is handy for those times when you find butternut squash on sale. Mine only needed 30 minutes in the oven. Also, add the broth little-by-little. I only needed one cup. After using broth though, this will be good as a side dish instead of mashed potatoes or as an addition to savory recipes. It freezes well. Thank you for the recipe.
