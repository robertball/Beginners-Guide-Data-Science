Ok I have been amking this for years. Not at evey event but when i remember i make it. I make it a little different, I only use dill on one side of the cream cheese and i don't use horseradish. i butter the top of the pastry before cooking it as well. we slice up green apples to dip into it and it is yummy! 20 minutes is a bit to short i do 30.

It was kind of easy to prepare, but the cream cheese was still cool when it came out of the oven.  The outside was brown, but the inside of the pastry was still doughy. The directions are not clear on how to serve it.
