This was such a great recipe! I nixed the dried onion and added a dash of red pepper flakes for a little heat. After browning the chicken a bit on the stove I threw everything together in my slow cooker and put it on high for about 3-4 hours. The chicken shredded up nicely which I thought made it easier to serve and eat! Great recipe that is super easy and makes for a quick, unique supper! Thanks!

Very good. I just added crushed pineapple, no red bell pepper or onion. Husband really enjoyed it.
