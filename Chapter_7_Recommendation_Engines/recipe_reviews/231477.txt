I found these muffins not lemony enough, I used 3 medium lemons.  Also there were too many poppy seeds and the muffins were a little dry. I also found the recipe made 18 medium sized muffins.

Awesome lemon flavor!! I only had one lg lemon which I juiced and got 1/3c lemon juice. I grated the rind into the wet ingredients-maybe a tsp or so. I added bottled lemon juice to make 1/2 c total (I had read that the avg lemon has about 1/4c juice) I think fresh lemon made all the difference. Next time I will use 2 fresh lemons. I ended up with a ton of batter so I made 18 muffins, which turned out somewhat small so next time I'll make 12. The taste of these is amazing- moist and lemony!! I'll never use a mix again!!

Delicious! We have made this recipe three times now. We used fat free greek yogurt and an addition of 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract is tasty. Thanks so much.

I made a double batch of these, and they are delicious! I only had 2 1/2 lemons on hand so I only ended up with 1/2 cup of lemon juice, and I used 2 TB of lemon zest. I will definitely use this recipe again, but I will probably do at least 3/4 c. of lemon juice for a double batch next time. I also had vanilla greek yogurt on hand and they were still fluffy and delicious. I baked my muffins for 2 minutes less than the suggested time to prevent them turning too brown or dry. Thanks for an excellent recipe!

Wonderful, yet they weren't exactly what I expected.  The consistency was light and they aren't too sweet.  The lemon flavor was not over whelming but pleasant.  I had enough batter to make 12 plus 4 mini muffins.  The regular sized muffins were full of batter when I put them in the oven and rose to just the right level.  I will make these again.

Delicious! My husband loves lemon poppyseed muffins, so it decided to make him happy and bake some for breakfast this morning. I used nonfat Greek yogurt because it's what I had. I thought the thick consistency of the batter would make for dense muffins, but they were very light, moist and delicious. I only had several small lemons, which I used, but next time I'm sure the two large lemons will yield the right amount of lemony-ness. Thanks for sharing!

What a waste of my time. I used to large lemons and had 1/2 cup lemon juice plus 2-3 TBS zest. They were too lemony. They stuck to the muffin liners and the batter was too light. Don't waste your time with these.

Too many poppy seeds gave the muffins an odd texture. No one enjoyed these & the remaining muffins were wasted. I used 4 small lemons, as that was what was in the store; equated to 1/2c lemon juice + zest of all. Lemon flavour was good. I will not be making these again and have removed from favorites.

I made them how the recipe says. They’re okay but they don’t taste like how you think they would. Kinda bland.

These were good. The recipe made 14 muffins. I put in ground flaxseed in place of a few spoonfuls of the flour, used 3 Tbsp. of bottled lemon juice, and skipped the lemon zest since I didn't have any. (Next time I'll definitely include it.) I only used 2 Tbsp. of poppy seeds, as others recommended, and that was plenty. I also followed someone's suggestion and added 1/2 tsp. almond extract, which was tasty. It would also be nice to make a glaze for the tops of the muffins with a little lemon juice and powdered sugar. I'll be making this again, for sure!

So good. Decreased poppy seeds to 2 tbl. 
My 2 lemons didn't quite give me 1/2 cup, so I zested until I got to 2 tbl. Otherwise,, followed recipe exactly. They were great!

I used oranges instead of lemons because it was what I had around. They turned out delicious!

Made as written. Measurements are off. Batter makes more like 18 regular muffins. Muffins were flat and lacking in flavor. Skip this recipe.

It wasn't necessary to oil the cupcake pan.  As a matter of fact, it made my hands oily as I was eating the muffin.  I changed the amount of oil to 1/4 c of oil and put in 1/4 c of organic applesauce. Then I added a lemon glaze when the muffins were cool... 3/4 c confectionary sugar and fresh lemon juice-- a little at a time to desired taste.  I baked the muffins @ 400 degrees for 15 min and @ 450 for 5 min.

I will make these muffins again with these adjustments before I try another recipe.

Delish! First time I've ever made lemon poppy muffins. My only change was subbing Greek yogurt cuz that's what I had and I only use 2Tbs of poppy seeds. I got 12 regular and 12 mini out of the batter- it is really fluffy. Nice lemony flavor but not tart. Bake time was 15 min for reg, 9 for minis. My 4 yr old keeps coming in the kitchen and running off with the minis lol.

The muffins turned out quite nice. I cut out some of the sugar (I always do because most things are too sweet for my taste) but in this case I should have just used the amount of sugar it called for. They would have turned out great! I think I will use a bit more lemon juice next time.

Excellent recipe, I double this recipe and only had 2 1/2 lemons. Had a nice lemon flavour but would use the recommended amount next time.  Also thought I had lots of poppy seeds but couldn't find them so I used 1/2 poppy seeds and 1/2 chia seeds.  Also used whole wheat flour and 1 c of oatmeal to replace the white flour.  They turned out great soft and moist on the inside and a nice crispy layer on the outside.  I made mini muffins so the kids could bring them to school for snacks.  They were a great hit.
