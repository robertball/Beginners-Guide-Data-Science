Absolutely fantastic! I did use only about 3/4 cup onion, as we aren't huge onion lovers in this house. I also used vegetable stock instead of chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe. The flavors are absolutely exquisite and I will be making this recipe again and again. Thank you! :)

Such a great recipe and it's so easy to make!! Just chop everything and throw them together and let them cook. Love it in a chilly fall day! I didn't have broth so I used water and added salt and pepper. It turned out right. So I assume salt and pepper should not be necessary if one uses the broth. Thanks for the recipe!

this soup is excellent.  Ive been on a squash kick and really enjoy the spiciness the curry gives- definatly add the yogurt, maybe a bit less curry if you are less into spicy.  delicious for this time of year, wouldnt change a thing and so simple and inexpensive to make.

Absolutely a delightful soup! Salt and pepper were unnecessary as the cinnamon and curry gave it a special zing. Definite recommend.

This is the soup I've been looking for! The simple flavors complement each other perfectly. No kidding, I could eat this for dessert, it's that good!

This is a perfectly delicious fall soup!  I made it with fat-free yogurt and it was absolutely wonderful.  Healthy, nutritious and yummy, I will be making this again and again!

Yikes all that chopping...this was a ton of prep work for something decent tasting.  I followed the recipe verbatim and wasn't happy with the end results.  I was excited before making it because the ingredients looked awesome... oh well :(

What a lovely soup- aesthetically pleasing, completely delicious, and delightfully nutritious.  I served it as a first course to a fall meal including apple cider chops, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin cake for dessert (Pumpkin Cake 1 from this site).  It was a big hit and was just perfect for this time of year!

I'm giving this 4 stars because my husband enjoyed this soup, but for some reason I did not like it at all. We had it as a first course to our dinner, and my husband  said it was good - but only in small doses because it was so sweet. I won't be making this again. (I followed the recipe exactly).

I love squash soup, but for some reason, I could not enjoy this one.  I used only one cup of yogurt because two seemed like a lot but it still was a little too "yogurty" for my tastes- that sort of sour taste that yogurt has really affects the dish.  Also, I used a squash puree I'd made previously for something else so I thought I wouldn't have to puree the soup later but the chunks of apple don't really work- definitely follow the directions and puree the soup!  Last thing, I thought the sunflower seeds didn't work with the other flavors, and I wished I had used pecans or something else instead.  BUT, my guests loved it, so I won't be rating this too poorly- maybe there's just something wrong with me!

I made this 10/18/09...I omitted the cinnamon, and added 6 finely chopped fresh bay leaves. I also only added 1 1/2 cups of yogurt vs. the 2/cups the recipe called out for. The bay leaves definately added more flavor.  The soup was very rich and creamy.  I would make again!

This soup looked pretty, the colors were amazing. But I couldn't eat more than a spoonful of it. The flavor was simply not good. Maybe without the onions & curry, this could be a nice sweet puree.

So easy to make and the chopping was nothing.  I used Greek yogourt - coconut flavoured and it was awesome.  I did not add any salt as I rarely add salt when I cook.

Delicious!  Next time, I will use a little less broth, the taste of the broth overpowered the soup just a little bit.  I also recommend a little nutmeg, and more apple.  Soooo tasty ... the tanginess of the yogurt makes it perfect.

I improvised a half batch of this soup using 900ml chicken broth, about 4 cups of butternut squash, 2 medium empire apples (all I had), and only 1/2 tsp. of curry powder. I didn't add the yogurt until I served the soup and I used a big fat dollop of greek yogurt.....soooooooo tasty, and very low-fat and nutritious!

Really good!  I had some leftover squash and this worked great as a half batch.  I couldn't get the kids to eat it though. I'll still make it again!

I made and took this to an autumn recipe exchange, and it was well -loved! It took much longer to prepare than mentioned - but I might be a slow cutter.  Otherwise it was great just as it's written.
