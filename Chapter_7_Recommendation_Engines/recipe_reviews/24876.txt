I have baked a lot of Cornish hens in my lifetime, but have only stuffed them with a rice mixture.  This was very good and a nice change.  For the reviewer that had a problem with it being dry, I just cooked it like I always do.  I oil the hens, season them, then make a basting sauce of 1/4 cup of oil, 1/4 cup of sherry, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, garlic powder and other favorite seasonings, and cook the bird uncovered, basting every 15 - 20 minutes.  I usually cook the hen at 350F for 1 hour and 20 minutes, then turn off the oven and let them sit in the oven to 'rest' about 10 minutes, basting one last time after the oven is turned off.  Thanks Janet for a new variation!

Very nice little recipe. Easy, even for someone who has never cooked hens before. I omitted the green pepper, and doubled the garlic since we have a small garlic addiction issue. Also, I added raisins and even my anti fruit husband loved it. Will make this again.

This was only my second attempt at cooking. I just followed the directions word-for-word, and it turned out just as promised. An excellent dish! And my wife liked it too.

Prepared this as Thanksgiving for Two.  I also made extra stuffing since I had wheat allergen Vegans coming to visit (used olive oil instead of butter).  I'd never roasted any kind of whole bird before trying this recipe.  Roasted them breast side down in one of those plastic oven bags, and they came out VERY moist!  Maybe a little too moist though, next time (if there is one... Cornish Hens are kinda expensive) I'll take them out of the bag toward the end to crisp up the skin - which was actually soggy, gross, and thrown away... but that was my fault, for not following the directions.  Aside from my skin mistake, the flavors and meat were hit the spot delicious.

This jam-packed little bird was delicious. I threw in some extra veggies, and also used a small box of quick-cooking wild rice to liven up the flavor. This works quite well, as there is no necessity to make any side dishes with this meal-it's all inclusive! I would definitely make this again, but perhaps, next time I would very slightly cook the rice before creating stuffing the bird with it. It seemed to take longer to cook than the bird did!

Delicious!  I made these this afternoon.  An hour and a half was the perfect cooking time.  I did mess around with some of the ingredients to use what I had on hand (I needed to clean out the fridge).  I substituted carrots for the bell pepper, Trader Joe's pesto sauce for some of the butter, and I rubbed some more pesto under the skin.  I also sweated the vegetables in some oil before stuffing to soften the carrots a bit.

This is a lovely recipe...If you had a problem with them turning out dry, next time you might try searing them until golden brown in a very hot, lightly oiled pan before putting them in the oven. Searing them will seal in the natural juices and help you get that nice golden brown, crisp skin.

I liked this a lot; I used another reviewer's suggestion and basted it throughout the roasting period, but didn't have any wine...I used beer and too little oil because I was running short and it could have been better, but still was very fine and flavorful.

I sauteed the onion, celery, green pepper and mushrooms in half the amount of butter called for. The amount of stuffing was perfect for the cornish hens. We found the basil taste came out too strong in the stuffing so would cut that back. They cooked in the amount of time called for and were a beautiful golden brown. Meat was moist and flavorful. I also found the 1/4 cup melted butter drizzled over the birds was a bit much so next time will just do half of that.

This was delicious. I tweeked a few things by replacing the green pepper with red for color used another reviewers suggestion of sauteing the vegis, then I put them in the food processer. Season the mix well with salt and pepper. My guests appreciated that I gave them small bowls to put the bones and gristle in while they ate.

This recipe is delicious. It was my first time cooking any kind of whole bird, and I was a little nervous. But the Cornish game hens turned out beautifully, and made a fantastic main course for our Thanksgiving for two.

Very popular with our dinner guests. So moist and tasty. Recipe doesn't say how long to brown the hens at 500. We tried 10 minutes but they still weren't quite brown. So we switched to broiler for a couple minutes more. Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly. Next time I might try some corn bread stuffing including ingredients in recipe. We will definitely use this again.

Very good flavor!  The only thing that I changed is I used fresh mushrooms and sauted the stuffing mixture in the butter before stuffing. Easy and Tasty!!

Only gave it 4 stars because the hens were very good and moist, but the stuffing, to us, was over-seasoned.  Will definitely make again, but will cut back on the spices.

This is a great recipe, my husband loved it!  I left out the mushrooms and added some additional spices to the stuffing mixture.  At the end of cooking time, I broiled the hen to crisp the skin (instead of baking at 500).  Overall a great recipe!

Awesome recipe.  My daughter loved it.  My modifications:
I cut up more veggies, so they spilled out of the cavity.  I basted it every 15 or 20 minutes.  It came out so tender. Not dry at all.  Delicious.  And this was my first time ever making cornish hens!  Thanks a million for this recipes!!!!

Stuffing needed salt.  I stuffed 3 birds, so increased the stuffing recipe to accomodate.  Had some left over, so sauteed it, and made a delicious gravy.  Gave the birds about 5 min. under the broiler after bake time, and got a delicious golden brown.  Would make this again!

It was pretty good! My husband LOVEDDDDDDDDDD it. I had never cooked any cornish hens before so, this was a total experiment. I love to cook and I love customizing these recipes.

I HATED the prep, I will say, so many prep dishes for me to wash, lol.

I mixed onions, green pepper, garlic, white salt, black pepper, garlic powder and crushed red pepper in the food processor for the seasoning. I then soaked the meat in that.

I stuffed the hens w/ carrots and celery w/ the butter from the original recipe. 

I mixed then put them in the pan, w/ the seasoning I made and sprayed some butter on top. I baked covered for the 1st hr and uncovered for the final 30 minutes. I then left it in the oven.

I wasn't too sure what to cook w/ it so I made stuffing and corn... it worked out but im sure i should have cooked a green veggie.

Absolutely delicious! I've tried this twice, and my famiy can't get enough. I am a beginner "chef", but I found this recipe to be easy to follow, and the results have been excellent both times. Even my mother-in-law loves my cornish hens, so you know they're good!

Just tried this last night.  I'm on a low carb diet, so this was perfect.  Used lots of fresh mushrooms instead of canned and only 1/4 cup butter in the stuffing, no butter on the bird. Used olive oil on the bird.  Would like to experiment with some stronger spices, but overall fantastic-even my picky teen daughter loved it. Had extra stuffing in the pan which was gobbled up immediately.  Oh, and I used larger game hens than normal, so my cooking time was a bit longer.

Great recipe, the hens were super moist.  We loved the veggie stuffing, and made a little extra so it would spill out of the hens.  This is by far the best stuffed hen recipe we have tasted, and will be using this recipe from now on.

I have made this recipe numerous times- each time it comes out great. A few minor changes: Smart Balance instead of butter and I double the amount of stuffing so I can place some under the skin and on top.

I love anything involving chicken. The kids liked this recipe, too, since they get their own game hen.  I didn't care for the mushrooms, but the rest of the stuffing was excellent.

LOVE this recipe!  The only thing we changed was instead of a baking dish we used a Dutch Oven.  OH SO JUICY and flavorful!  The meat was falling off the bone.  Quickly will become one of my favorites!  Can't wait for better weather when we can try over coals.

I rate this recipe at least 4 stars. Made this dish today for Sunday's dinner. The hens were well flavored, succulent and tasty! Tweaked the recipe somewhat, included fresh carrots & fresh mushrooms
estimated about equal amounts of all veggies. Only did between
1/4-1/3 amount of butter total, which was used for both hens and vegetables. Sprinkled paprika, pepper & a lil parsley with basil on meat. Cooked at 350 covered for one hour and about 45 minutes uncovered (the last 15 min or so turned temp down to 325) meat turned out perfectly browned & juicy, veggies moist with a lil crunch. Served with oven brown rice and lima beans on the side. Almost forgot to mention, used natural minced garlic in the jar and the butter was unsalted.
 Stuck a few celery & carrot sticks underneath the wings & legs of the birds for extra flavor basting periodically. Absolutely delish!!

This was AWESOME! ONce a month we meet with friends to learn about wine and food pairings.  They buy the wine, we make the food.  I googled the type of wine and asked for food pairings - cornish game hens was one choice!  Allrecipes NEVER lets me down!  THANKS!

This is a *very* easy way to make a meat dish with a beautiful presentation!  It's a good recipe, but there was some zip missing. Perhaps I just needed to season the cornish hen skins with a bit of garlic powder?

Just tried the recipe and did not change a thing.  The hens turned out fantastic and having the veggies inside made a complete meal.  I added a salad and beverage and dinner was great.  Very easy to prepare and baking time was just right.

This was delicious. I also made stuffing as a side dish. I used the ample drippings from the baking pan and using milk and flour made a delicious gravy to serve on the side. This recipe was a fantastic alternative to "stuffed hens".

It was okay for my first time making it. I will be mindful though to add more salts like seasoning salt and sea salt.

I made this and even messed up (forgot to cover it) and it still came out good! Moist and tasty. I will make this again. Also, one hen fed 2 adults, 4 kids, and a toddler. All I added was potatoes on the side!

I love this recipe, the only two things I changed was to use yellow peppers instead of green because I like the sweeter taste and not use the parsley. Other than that this recipe was a life saver. My family loved it! I also made dressing as a side dish since it's the holidays. I will definitely use it again!

Wow! Nice recipe but way too much butter! The veggies already make it moist inside, so you can cook uncovered on 425 for about 1 hour, basting with a small amount of butter every 10 minutes after the first 30 minutes of cooking time. If you mix rice in with the veggies, you have the entire meal ready in one pan!

I don't know what I did wrong, I followed this recipe exactly except that I left the hens in the oven for 2 hours instead of 1 and a half. They were still raw in the middle after I had already made the side dishes. So i ended up eating side dishes and cooking the hens for another hour and 15 minutes and it was good, but why the hell did it take so long?

It think this would have been perfect if the onions would have been sauteed a bit before being mixed in. It just had a bit of a raw flavor. i also added bread crumbs to the stuffing.

This was good, it had a nice flavor and texture. The only thing I would change is adding a bit more celery than what was called for because as is the stuffing is a nice accent but light fair.

I was a little skeptical at first becuase I don't usually have good luck with cornish game hens, but this recipe was great, even my husband who is very picky loved it. The chicken was moist and had a great flavor. I will definately do this one again.

I made this dish for my dish on valentine's day and it was great. I would recommend this recipe fully.
