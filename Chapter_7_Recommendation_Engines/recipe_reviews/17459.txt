Campbells' makes a cream of shrimp soup and that's the brand I use...they usually stock it around the holidays, and I suspect this recipe is one of the reason's why ;-)

This is one of the best dips we've made - very easy to put together and great tasting!  We used extra shrimp and less cream cheese.

This was very good - I tasted it warm and liked it but made it early so I served it cold and it was just as good.  I used herbed pita chips to dip it with and the spices on them took it up a notch too.

Good flavors and the soup was easy to find. Next time I will use cooked shrimp (not canned) and add a little more. Just as good at room temperature or cold.

I add green onions for a little more color and flavor.
