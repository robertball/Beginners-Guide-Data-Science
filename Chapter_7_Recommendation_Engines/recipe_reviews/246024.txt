My family loves anything spicy, so, this seemed right up our alley!  I will say when I first made the milk mixture it did not thicken like macaroni and cheese I have made in the past and seemed very soupy.   Even when I poured the mixture into my baking dish it was extremely watery and I thought there was no way it would set-up.  Surprisingly it did set-up like typical macaroni & cheese.  I let it rest about 10 minutes after I took it out of the oven and it was just fine.  Don't be discouraged if your if mixture is very thin when you put it in the oven.  It will be fine!  That being said, we weren't fans of the flavor.  The jalapeno taste was there which we liked, but, it wasn't spicy.  It seemed a little bland to us though and had more of a milky taste instead of a cheesy taste.   I also didn't like the texture.  I am not sure if that is from the type of cheese used or from the use of the egg yolks, but, it seemed almost grainy.

I was so excited about this recipe, but it definitely is lacking something. We added some sriracha to give it some heat, but I think some sharp cheddar mixed in with some additional seasoning like onion or garlic powder would have made this far better. :/ this might be a recipe to tinker with.

I made this for dinner and it was. fabulous. I used candy jalapeño in mine also I only used 2 eggs. If you didn’t want it being made you would not know it’s gluten free.

My husband and I LOVED this mac and cheese!  I was really surprised by how much the gluten free pasta tastes like regular pasta.  The sauce didn't thicken too much for me prior to adding in the cheese.  But once I added in the cheese, it was wonderfully thick and delicious looking.  It baked really nicely and it made a wonderful side for our dinner!  It was a little too spicy for my kids, who are younger, but I'll definitely be making this again!
