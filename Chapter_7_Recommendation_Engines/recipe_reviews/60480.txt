Just a note to mention that the recipe for some reason includes draining the asparagus and tomato mixture after it is cooked until tender....but you are NOT supposed to drain it, otherwise you will have some VERY dry pasta ;)  Not sure why the error is there, but that is not how I originally wrote it :)

This is by far the best meal I have made. I did do some variations. I boiled my pasta in chicken broth. I fryed the asparagus and tomatoes with some white wine also. I did add more chicken broth with the veggies. The avacado with lime was excellent!!!A must try meal everyone loves.

This recipe came through yesterday as the recipe of the day. I read it and immediately decided to try it. I prepared it exactly as the recipe called for and found it delicious. It was not watery and I brought it to work today and even reheated in the microwave with no problem..this will be a "keeper" as my husband says.

This is a great summertime dish. My husband & I loved it! I did make a few changes...added a little extra garlic powder to avacado mixture as well as some salt for a boost. Also, instead of using the cheese as a topping, I put it in with the pasta while it was warm so it was melted throughout the dish...delicious! Thanx for this recipe Brendajst!

While the flavour of this was nice, it was way to watery. I tried to add cornstarch for thickening, but while boiling it down, my asparagus ended up over cooked. I suppose you could remove the veggies before thickening. I won't make it again.

Wonderful and easy recipe, sure to impress everyone.  I used half chicken broth, half white wine (Sauvignon Blanc).  Additionally, I threw in about a half pound of shimp...perfect main course dinner!

Recipe quick and easy but bland, so I added bacon bits to it and it really made a delicious difference.  I also added some basil and sundried tomato.  Next time I'll add some onion while cooking the garlic.  And I skipped the avocado mix altogether and topped it with shredded parmesean cheese.  A healthy dinner!

This was to die for!  My only suggestion would be to cut down on the time you boil the pasta.  It tends to soak up some of the water the asparagus is cooked in and it got a little soggy.  This is a keeper!

This recipe looked interesting.  We are not fond of the avocado taste so I omitted it.  I found the finished taste bland so I added some basil, oregano and a touch of sugar, Oh I added a half can of tomato paste.  Cooked down to a thicker version and it was great

Yes I am modifying this a bit but I am not going to pay for a membership so that I can "customize recipe".  My family loves this but I basically follow the recipe up until the dill weed.  I don't use any of the ingredients starting with the dill weed and below.  I used at least 3 or 4 cloves of garlic.  After draining the pasta and when the asparagus mixture is ready in my deep skillet, I put the pasta right back into the skillet with the asparagus and tomatoes and chicken broth.  Since there is no real source of protein here I serve it with something, like fish or chicken.  We love it.

I tried this and absolutely loved it!  I make it all the time now because its so easy and the leftovers taste good too.  I skipped the avocado because I didn't have any, but I doubled the garlic.  Delicious!  I drained a little bit of the soup because it was a little too runny, but other than that, its perfect.  Can't wait to make it again!

I found this to be a little bland, but the flavor was good and interesting.  I think I'll make it again with a few modifications -- maybe garlic and onion canned diced tomatoes instead of the plum ones.

I whipped this up for brunch but with a few variations like using brown rice pasta and adding ocean salt and at the last minute I stirred in the avocado mix just to warm it up and coast more evenly throughout the dish....EXCELLENT and quick to whip up if you have left over pasta, just toss the pasta into the pan at about 5 minutes into the ten.

This took me longer than the prep time listed.  I added chicken to mine.  I felt like the product was a little bland, but good overall.  I couldn't find the white Mexican Cheese, so I used cheddar.  I wouldn't recommend that.

When making this, it started to look like it was going to have way too much liquid, however the pasta absorbed almost all of it which was impressive.  The avacado mixture went well with the rest of the pasta which I also thought wouldn't work out well.  However I thought the pasta was rather bland, even after adding spices.  It was good enough for once, but I probably won't make this one again.

I did NOT care for this recipe.  It was rather bland, the flavors did not blend well.  It didn't go over well with my boyfriend either.  The grape tomatoes really ruined it, in my opinion.

I found this recipe to be on the dry side and somewhat bland when the sauce was mixed with the pasta.  Although I used a 16 oz. box of angel hair, it seemed as though there was too much pasta for the other ingredients.  While I like the avocado idea, I think it should have been mixed with the sauce before the pasta was added because it is not easy to mix it in once it is just put on top.  I haven't completely given up on this recipe, but I think I would use half the pasta and mix the avocado mixture with the sauce first and try it again.  The dill gives a nice flavor also.

Very good! Not a big fan of cooked tomatoes so we added fresh grape tomatoes to avocado mix. Otherwise made as is

This is a good recipe but it needs something to give it a little more flavor. I'll make it again and add some sort of spice to it. Not sure what. Suggestions?

I like all of these ingredients, but the overall taste was fairly bland and most definitely not worth the effort.  Will not make again.

I've never had a pasta like this before and was kind of reserved on trying it because of the ingredients. But, boy am I glad I did! Very good, and the avocado added a very nice twist!

Quick and easy to fix.  I've never had avocado with pasta before, but it was absolutely delicious.  I originally cooked this several years ago, but it has become a family favorite.  It's elegant enough to serve to company, and I've never had anyone who didn't love it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  

I always cook with shrimp, and always cook as described.  Even though it seems counterintuitive to add so much chicken broth, it doesn't come out watery to me as some have mentioned.  I cook in a big dutch oven, then use a pasta spoon to grab out pasta for first servings.  If there are any leftovers, the pasta soaks up the remaining broth, but because I cook al dente to begin with, even the leftovers don't seem overcooked.

Yummy! Even my two-year-old kids loved it. I didn't have angel hair, so I used rotini instead. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it turned out great!

I've made this recipe twice now, and it's been great both times. Definately a keeper! I might add that it's so yummy, you probably won't get 8 servings from this recipe (unless you serve it as a side).

I really liked this.  It was very pretty and tasted good.  I may have put too much dill in.  I usually love the taste of dill, but I didn't like it as well in this.  I will make it again.

Along with the other reviewers, I was pretty skeptical of how something with such odd ingredients would taste together, but it was GREAT! I added shrimp to the tomato/asparagus/broth and let it simmer before tossing with the pasta, and substituted half wine for chicken broth to make a bit richer. The shrimp taste really gave the recipe an added richness that was delectible. If in doubt on this one, give it a try.

Wow this is a great pasta dish!  After only a couple of bites, my husband told me we need to find more recipes that use avocados.  I had to use lemon juice because we were out of lime.  Just delicious.

This is a very tasty and interesting combination of flavors.  Family loved it.  I boiled the pasta in water with chicken boulion instead of salt.  It boosts the flavor & has salt in it.  I am confused by other reviews that said it was dry.  I dumped all the asparagus mixture with the broth into the pasta.  Mine was almost too wet.  Next time I'll be more careful when combining to make sure I add only the amt of broth/sauce we like.

Great--I also squeezed some lime juice into the asparagus sauce, which gave the pasta a little more tang.  Grilled chicken would be a wonderful addition for those "must have meat" men!

This was good but there were two problems with it. First, I didn't like the cheese. Next time, I will use a different type. It's just as well, it was very expensive cheese. Which brings me to my second issue. This recipe was pretty pricey. The next time I make this, it will be when asparagus and avacados are on sale.

This dish is so light and versatile!  I made a batch exactly as directed, which yielded a LOT of pasta.  For dinner, I added pre-cooked chicken strips (just heat them in the micro for a few minutes, then toss with the pasta); for lunch the next day, I ate it plain; for dinner tonight, I'm going to add cooked shrimp.  The flavor is very light and some might call it plain - so adding in a few extra ingredients might be called for.  Extra ground black pepper would be great, as well as using Parmesan cheese instead of the Mexican queso specified in the recipe.  Extra garlic would also kick up the taste a bit.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

When my husband first pitched this recipe to me, I turned it down because it just sounded weird. But we made it anyway and it is VERY good! I didn't use dill (because I didn't have any). Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and we both really enjoyed it.

This was absolutely great!!  It is easy to do alot of the prep work ahead of time so you can still be with your guests.  Adding the tomatoes at the last minute is definetely a good idea to avoid them being mushy.

I finally psyched myself up to making this, and the whole time I kept thinking "I don't know about this..." It is a strange combination, but the end result had good flavor. I'd diced the avocado and tossed it in, and used mozzeralla instead. I'd make this again for myself, but my husband didn't like it so much.

If it could be 4.5 stars that's what I would've chosen. This was a great recipe which I agree with others, has many unusual ingredients! The only thing I changed was I used a shredded Mexican cheese that had the queso asedero in it but also a blend of other cheeses. I also omitted the dill since my husband does not care for it and I substituted it for basil. It needed some extra salt and next time I may try to make the base with a cream of chicken soup and mily to make it more creamy. But this was great! Nice and light! A great way to get in a healthy dose of veggies. Oh and I also added shrimp. Next time I will up the amount of veggies and shrimp!

This was amazing!!  This was only serving three people and I made the servings for 8 and we had this as leftovers twice and ate it all!!  It was just wonderful!!  I love trying new things and have to admit that this seemed a little strange to me at first, but I love asparagus, pasta, and tomatoes, so I knew it was worth a try!!  DELICIOUS!!!

Delicious.  I added onions in with the fresh garlic as well as salt and pepper and added a bit more chicken broth as it cooked down. Also added sundried tomatoes to the mix. Saved fresh tomatoes until the end so they were not overcooked.  Substituted basil for dill. Used white cheddar cheese. Discovered at last minute that I had no avocados so I just sprinkled lime juice over served pasta and it turned out really well to my surprise.

Fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly and added some shrimp, it was perfect! The shrimp is a must! Next time I might remove the tomatoes from the skillet before adding the chicken broth because the tomatoes got too mushy. The dish needed a good amount of salt as well, but once tweaked, the flavor was wonderful. Definitely try this recipe!

Yummy and healthy too! I served it with grilled salmon.  A few things I did different: I used jarred minced garlic instead of fresh, and I used frozen asparagus spears instead of fresh.  They snap as easily into pieces while  frozen as does fresh asparagus, without the waste.  My husband doesn't like tomatoes or avocado, so I didn't add them.  I think if I made this for companay I would serve them on the side. I omitted the cheese, but I think shredded parmesan would be good too. Oh, I also added cooked shrimp.  I added a bit of butter to my husband's serving (not as healthy) to make it a bit creamier.  Very good dish! There are so many possible variations that it's a good recipe to have the main ingredients on hand in case of unexpected company.

This was a very light, easy dish to make.  The avacado added a nice touch and I loved the cheese with it!

I love avocados, so this recipe immediately caught my eye.  After trying it, though, I was REALLY impressed.  All four of my kids loved it, too.  Whoever thought of mashing avocado and having it on pasta!?  WOW, it is EXCELLENT.

We really liked this dish.  I was intrigued by the addition of (basically) guacamole but the flavor combination was excellent!  Like other reviewers, I think next time I'll replace some of the chicken broth with white wine.  Thanks for the great recipe BRENDAJST!

My husband and I were both surprised by how wonderful this dish was.  I wasn't too sure about the different ingredients, but they worked well together.  We did feel that it was a bit heavy on the pasta.  I will cut that amount in half the next time I make it.
