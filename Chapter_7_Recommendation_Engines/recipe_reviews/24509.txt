This is an excellent basic recipe and I have made it several times, but may I suggest a couple of things:  First, instead of using flour, try crushed corn flake cereal - use your own judgement as to the correct amount, but enough to thicken the mixture. You will have a crisp patty. Second, my grandmother advised me a long time ago that when using canned fish, to always add a pinch or two of white sugar - some how does away with the tin can taste.  It works too!

I'm a huge salmon fan and I thought this recipe was so easy and very tasty.  I made one change...instead of frying in oil, I sprayed a baking pan heavily with Pam, placed the patties, which I rolled in a bit of bread crumbs, onto the baking pan, then sprayed each patty with Pam.  I baked in a 375 degree oven for about 20 minutes, turning once.  they were golden brown, but tender on the inside and not one bit greasy.  they were out of this world!

I just wanted to make a quick comment---I'm familiar with this recipe; it's identical in every way to my mother's EXCEPT my mom and I always add about a quarter cup of flour to the mixture to help it stick together.  It works much better this way and you don't lose any flavor.

I'm on the Atkins Diet and this is a perfect meal for anyone who is doing the low-carb, high-protein thing.  Therefore, adding flour is not an option, and in my opinion totally unnecessary.  The mixture may seem a little loose at first but if the salmon is drained well and the mixture well-blended, they should come out perfectly (as mine did on the first try).  The only additions I made were garlic powder and chopped green onion. Very tasty!

This recipe provided an excellent framework. I did tweak the directions though. Instead of using 2 eggs, I just used 1. I then used 2 tablespoons of miracle whip, 1 cup of plain bread crumbs, and 1Â½ teas of Old Bay, the last two being what many others suggested. My husband tasted it and was immediately impressed. Since I've tried to make other recipes or bought store kits before, he said this is the recipe I should use from now on. But, since I like my cakes a little spicy, I think I'll use more Old Bay, or try a little dill the next time.

When using canned salmon there is no need to remove the bones.  They have a high nutritional value.  Just crush them up with you fingers and they are undetectable in the finished product.  Also,  I shape them like fish sticks and bake them.  The kids love them this way.

I like this recipe much better than salmon cakes with bread crumbs.  Tastes better and is low carb!!  I minced the onion and used a medium sized onion.  The patties held together very well. It may have helped that I put the mixture in the frig for about 30 minutes before I formed the patties.  I also added a little seasoned salt.

I love most fish or seafood cakes and the simplicity of this recipe has made this one of my quick backup meals.  I have not found that one needs to modify the recipe except for one step: refrigerate the cakes once shaped for 20-30 minutes.  It will prevent the cakes from breaking up during cooking.

These are really good...especially if you like canned fish.  I like to mince my onions rather than chop because I don't like "chunks" of onions in anything.  The amount of ingredients are right on...they mold the salmon mixture together perfectly.  I like to sprinkle garlic powder on mine...I do that with almost everything I prepare.  These are great pan fried...wonder how they would taste baked??  Thanks Jessica.

I adjusted to the recipe to make six servings instead of four, and everything turned out just fine.  As per another reviewers suggestion, I also baked these on 375 for about 20-25 minutes...flipping once halfway through.  Much healthier than frying, and my mom actually commented about how she liked them better this way.  I spruced these up a bit adding garlic powder, onion powder, salt, bread crumbs, and parsley.  I also chilled the salmon mixture in the fridge for about 20 minutes before molding them into patties.  This is a good base recipe, but use your imagination and your own taste preferences in order to adjust them to how you want them to be.

This is an absolutely perfect recipe. I used sockeye salmon simply because although I'm in no way a fish lover, I do love sockeye salmon. I drained the salmon for quite some time to make sure it was dry, left the bones and skin on, then followed the recipe, adding a very small amount of minced red pepper. I love red peppers and I thought a touch of colour was a good thing. I may as well not have added it. Not much flavour came though.   I fried the patties (8 of them, four at a time) in the oil on medium for close to 5 minutes on the first side, then a little less on the other. I love that this recipe doesn't have any starch of any kind. Who needs starch? It kept it's shape beautifully when cooking and browned up nice and crunchy on the outside.  One tip: allow it to get nice and brown, not just golden, before you attempt to turn it. Also, don't let the soft texture fool you before you fry. Just place it gently in the pan and you'll be fine. If it kind of threatens to fall apart... no worries, just pat it back into shape with the spatula.  I'm going to make this at least once a week. Finally I can have fish in my diet and actually enjoy it.  Thank you Jess for sharing this.

After adding green pepper and a tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce.I then rolled in flour as suggested by another reviewer, they came out great. My family loved it.

I followed this recipe to the letter today.  These were delicious.  I'm following a high protein/ low carb diet and these fit the rules exactly. If the salmon is well drained there's no need for adding flour which is not on my diet.  The cakes were easy to form... much like hamburger or ground turkey.  Ok, there 's one thing, I didn't remove the bones.  They are soft and a great source of calcium.  You cannot even taste them or feel a different texture.  I made a sauce to go with them out of mayo, Louisianna hot sauce, Bragg vinegar, black pepper and garlic powder. No measuring, whipped it together to taste. Just stirred sauce ingredients....no cooking.  Yummo!  Had a green salad on the side.  Your grandma's recipe should be famous....it was so good.  I'm thinking of trying it with crab instead of salmon sometimes.  Thanks for sharing!!!!  :)

I was looking for a salmon cake recipe that did not use a dry filler . . . and this one was delicious.  I did add a couple of tablespoons of dry mustard and some granulated garlic to this before I cooked it, but I think the recipe would have been good without those additions.

Also, I baked these on a baking stone at 425 degrees for 20 minutes, flipped them over and baked them for another 5 minutes to make sure they were crispy.  I would probably like them fried, but I hate babysitting anything sitting on my stove top, so I will slam almost anything I can into my oven.  This recipe is going into my regular dinner rotation!

These turned out really well. The only change I made was to coat them in plain bread crumbs with a bit of old bay mixed in, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Good stuff!

This is a great recipe.  I made the following additions/changes per my mother's advice: green onion vs. white/yellow onion, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, salt, hot sauce, old bay seasoning, and miracle whip.  I also used extra virgin olive oil to fry the patties. These go great with grits.  My entire family is from Charleston SC so dishes like these are a household staple.  My granny will sometimes fry butts meat, break it into pieces, and then mix in the aforementioned ingredients without making them into patties.  EMJOY!!!!

This is the same recipe my Mom and I always use with one exception, we add about 1/4 cup of cornmeal to give it a more southern taste.  I don't remove the bones either as it adds calcium to the meal if you just crush all the bones into the mixture.

These were awesome! Finally, something to make with canned salmon that I actually like! I made these exactly as the recipe is written. It's true that the mixture is very soft but all you have to do is get the little patties from the bowl to the frying pan in once piece and then they fry up nice and crisp. These will be a regular high protein lunch for me. Thanks!

Great! My mom used to make these all the time. All I add is garlic salt (no oil) and when we want to spice them up, I add a can of drained hot green chilies. Perfection!  3 things: You do not need to remove the bones, just crumple with your fingers; they are tasteless and a high source of nutrition.   If your mixture falls apart or you feel you need to firm it up with flour...then you did not drain the salmon totally. There is a lot of juice in a can of salmon!  And only 1 egg per can of salmon or you will create the "runny" issue again.

It was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly; I made sure oil was nice & hot. Loved that the great salmon taste was not diffused with flour or bread crumbs. Thanks so much for sharing your grandmas recipe. For my next batch, I'll add cayenne pepper.

This is a good basic recipe, identical to the one I've made for years except that I put just enough crushed crackers or soft bread crumbs (whatever is on hand) to hold together. Otherwise, it just falls apart and is difficult to work with. Tried it this way, though, just to see and it didn't work for me.

I changed this one around a bit. I used a 10 oz can of salmon (because that what I had) and 1 egg. Added fresh chopped green pepper, old bay seasoning and sprinkled some corn meal then mixed and sprinkled some more until batter stuck together. Baked @ 425 until light brown. It browned on both sides too.

This was awesome. After reading the reviews I tweaked it as well. I added green peppers and bread crubs and actually baked it instead of frying. 375 degrees for 20 mintues, flipping one time.  I also add some mrs. dash for extra flavor and lemon dill sauce for dipping!

Read the reviews and many people added bread crumbs etc.... however, this is the BEST recipe for a very low-carb salmon cake for we "low-carbers".  I've added some green pepper and spices but good the way it is.

So amazingly easy, so amazingly healthy. An easy last minute weeknight meal that seems elegant.
I like to top these with a simple cucumber/dill/yogurt sauce to make them a little more fancy.

I had this canned salmon in the cupboard & had no idea what to do with it! I am a novice when cooking pretty much anything btw. I thought for sure this wasn't going to be too good b/c it seemed to easy... Well, it's delicious (i followed the recipe exactly for the first time) and I will be making it again!

The name rings true! My Dad asked for salmon cakes at Christmas dinner because his Grandma used to make them every Christmas. I used this recipe, only I used about half as much onion and substituted the other half for potato. Sure enough, he said they were just like his Grandma's!!

Simple but elegant recipe. Very tasty. I was surprised that I did not have to use flour to bind the ingredients; the extra egg holds everything together.

These were a pretty good basic salmon cake. I thought they would need a little more flavor so I did add to them.  I added some seasones bread crumbs a little Lemon Pepper Mrs. Dash and 2 big cloves of finely minced garlic.  With these changes they were great.

So simple, and so delicious. This is great comfort food. I usually throw in a little bit of Old Bay seasoning.

This is a very basic, boring and bland recipBut its definitely good to use as a base to build on. I chopped green onions, fresh basil and parsley, red and green peppers and fresh garlic. I took these and sauteed them in a tiny bit of olive oil before adding them to the salmon mixture. The canned salmon is pre cooked and doesnt take long to get crispy in a pan so by cooking the ingredients before adding them it released an amazing amount of flavor that otherwise wouldn't have been possible. I also added some red pepper flakes because I like everything a bit spicy. Definitely try this recipe but add your own flavors.

I just found my new favorite salmon cake recipe. I added a little Old Bay seasoning and decreased the pepper a tiny bit. These are much better than other salmon cakes made with flour, potatoes, or crumbs. Thanks Jessica!

Thumbs up in this house. It was incredibly easy to make. I did a half recipe adding 1 shredded carrot per someone's suggestion and chopped green onions as I don't like other onions. I added Italian bread crumbs to firm things up and it formed a perfect patties that cooked in about 3 minutes per side in olive oil. Maybe I should have cooked them a bit slower. Wonderful. Thank you!

Awesome! Very quick and easy, my kids loved and they never like anything! My modifications: , I used 5 Hawaiian roles, shredded. It thickened and added sweet flavor. I sauted onions and sweet corn in pan with olive oil while cooking the patties and I added 1/4 sweet curry and old bay seasoning. Awesome flavor.

A great, quick meal! I added green pepper & a few white bread crumbs like my Grandmother used to do as well as a pinch of salt. This was a hit with the family for a really quick fix. We ate them as salmon patty sandwiches & they were delicious.

Easy to make but very bland as is. After tasting the mix, I felt the need to add cumin, garlic powder, and a little italian seasoning. The mixture was also very wet, so I added a very small amount of italian flavoured bread crumbs. I then baked them at 350Â° for 8 minutes on each side instead of frying. All in all, a simple healthy meal, but nothing earth-shattering. Oh! And you will definitely need some sort of sauce as they are a little dry.  One more note...Instead of picking out the bones, I simply broke them up while I was breaking up the meat. It only took a little extra effort to break it all up to make the bones undetectable and they are an excellent source of calcium.

I added breadcrumbs as I felt they needed some "body."  'Served them with wasabi sauce (1/4 cup mayonnaise mixed with 1 teaspoon wasabi paste).  My husband loved them!  This is a keeper.

Tweaked these to suit our tastes by using a bit less onion, and adding some celery, some Old Bay Seasoning, lemon and a bit of dill.  Did not remove the bones.  They are a good source of calcium.

Went with the suggestion of using 1 egg...Formed into 5 patties...Chilled in refrigerator 30 minutes before frying.  Used enough oil to cover bottom of pan...Let pan get hot before frying patties.  They came out crispy and golden brown.  Served the patties topped with a yogurt-dill sauce.

This was also my grandmothers recipe and although it is simple, it's all you need to have a great cake. You can add all the seasonings you want but I feel like it just takes away from the salmon flavor. Good. Basic. Tasty!

I didn't add any onions. And I added a half of a handful of seasoned bread crumbs to hold it. Delicious. Oh yeah I also added two pinches of white sugar to take a away that can fish taste.

These salmon cakes were so good! I followed the recipe -however, I used two 6 ounce cans of boneless and skinless salmon from Costco, their Kirkland brand instead of one 13 ounce can, and added a tablespoon full of cornstarch to the mixture.
The salmon cakes were mild and had a very delicate flavor.  
I followed the advice of others who rated this recipe and was patient and didn't turn them until they were well browned giving the eggs the chance to do their binding job.  The cakes stayed together, they were crispy and yummy!  This recipe has made a salmon cake lover out of my very reluctant husband.  He even ate the left over ones in a sandwich the next day!

The salmon cake recipe I usually use has flour in it.  I specifically chose this recipe because of the dredded low carb diet. I actually, to my surprise prefer the taste of this recipe. They are a little fragile to work with, but they didn't taste so cakey like the ones with flour do.   I always use the pouches that are deboned, skinned, and drained.  Who wants to pick through bones! I also added some spices, then topped with a little mayo and horseradish

I added a couple of dashes of dried dill weed, a squeeze of lemon juice and 1 cup of dried breadcrumbs.  Also, using coarse ground pepper added to the flavor!  However, the original is excellent as is.

YUCK! Picking through the salmon bones was gross. Maybe fresh salmon would have been the key but even after addong "salmon seasoning" and bread crumbs, this recipe was just blah. I won't be making it again, I was disappointed. No one in the house has touched even one.

Delicious! I used fresh salmon rather than canned (I just baked it at 350 for 25 minutes before hand) and I think it made all the difference. I also added a bit of flour like one of the reviewers suggested. These are really great! 3/22 I made these with canned salmon tonight. I added some Old Bay and garlic, then rolled the patties (more like balls) in seasoned bread crumbs. My boyfriend gave these 6 stars out of 5. He LOVED them this way! Served with steamed soy beans, delicious.

I had some leftover salmon (Costco) and wanted to try making salmon cakes for the first time.  This recipe really appealed to me because it required few ingredients and seemed very straightforward. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to add about a tsp of Old Bay Seasoning and to coat the salmon cakes in Japanese panko bread crumbs before frying about 3-4 minutes on each side, which made them light and crispy   I made a quick tartar sauce with mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish, and lemon juice.  Absolutely delicious and so easy.  Thanks for the great recipe!  It's definitely a keeper.

First time using canned salmon - after I got past the cleaning and deboning of the fish, it was smooth sailing!  I was amazed that we couldn't even notice the smaller bones!  I only used one egg, added a tbsp of mayo and the Old Bay, per other reviewers, and rolled my patties in bread crumbs and baked.  This receipe was a hit!  Would also be easy to make the night before and just bake when ready.  Will try other salmon cake recipes on this site but give this one 5 stars!

I used this recipe as a guideline for my Salmon Cakes, they turned out great.  I added some additional seasoning mixing in some Parmesan cheese into the patty, and coating the outside of the patties with Italian breadcrumbs to give it a nice golden, crisp coating on each side.  Then I fried them up on a griddle.  Thanks for posting this!

Very nice flavour made just as is.  Next time I will add a little lemon jce and maybe some hot sauce and Worcestershire just to add a little zing.  The nice part is it needs no fillers!  When you are tempted to flip them, wait another minute or two until they are nice and brown; they will not fall apart!  Served with tangy coleslaw is very nice, in fact my son put a cake on a bun, and topped with coleslaw.  Just a side note, this will not feed four hungry people!

Grandma's Famous Salmon Cakes' Haiku: "These cakes surprised me! I was wary, but loved them. A tad bit soggy." I've never made a salmon patty w/o crushed crackers, breadcrumb, flour, or some sort of additional dry binder, so I was nervous of following the recipe as written. The only thing that I did differently was to add some garlic powder, but really, these turned out great, albeit, a little soggy and difficult to shape and flip. So while they didn't hold up that well, and I did fry mine for longer than 5 min. per side to acheive maximum crispy goodness, the taste was awesome, and better yet, dipped into ketchup mixed w/ sriracha. Had a leftover patty which I patty-melted in a sandwich w/ tomato, pickles and provolone - now THAT I will thank Grandma for. Yum.

I made this recipe as stated, but used Egg Beaters in place of the egg and added some chopped bell pepper. The salmon cakes were delicious, but I thought used much more oil than was necessary. I think next time I will try baking them like another reviewer did.

I never drain the salmon and I leave in the bones. I add 1 egg, a torn slice of bread (whole wheat, if you have it) and about 15 crushed soda crackers. Mix together, form into patties and fry in oil or a mix of oil and butter. YUMMMM. A great quick dinner and the leftovers are great hot or cold.

i used 1/2 tbps onion powder and lightly coated my cakes in plain breadcrumbs.  I also baked mine for 20 min @375.  They came out DELISIOUS! But they do need a sauce of some kind.

With some modifications, it turned out GREAT! I followed some tips on the salmon can and added a small amount of crushed croutons, fresh garlic, about 2 tbsp lemon juice, and a heaping tbsp of fat-free mayo... Rolled in crush croutons and fried in EVOO made these the BEST salmon cakes Ive ever tasted!! Even my bf who never had these b4 and hates fish (he only likes basic foods--weirdo lol) LOVED these! I tried this recipe as is, and it was ok, but with my modifications... OMG!!!!

I first picked this recipe because I was looking for something simple to make with ingredients I had on hand.  For such a simple recipe, these salmon cakes have great flavor.  Great as is...but I have also tried adding the juice of one lemon and some dried dill which adds even more flavor.

Good recipe, but I've always added about 25-30 saltine crackers (crushed) to the mixture before frying.  Makes them crispier and a better flavor.

I was not all that impressed with this recipe.  It did not stick together well and it was runny, I would only use one egg instead of two.  I also spiced it up with Creole Seasoning and Old Bay, but it still wasn't all that great.

My husband insisted on buying canned salmon at Costco so I had a lot of salmon and not a lot of ideas on what to do with it. These salmon cakes were very moist and full of salmon flavor. I did add some garlic powder and a dried herb blend to spice them up a bit. You could really add anything to them (fresh veggies or different herbs and spices) and they would taste great. The cakes were good with lots of fresh lemon juice. They were good the next day too. Great recipe!

This is an easy recipe to make. I used minced onion instead of a fresh onion.And I added about 1 cup of flour to keep the mix together. My family really enjoyed this recipe instead of the original one I have been using for years.

This is just like my mom makes, too.  I added red and green peppers for flavor.  The garlic powder was a nice touch, as well.  I had planned to add flour because mine always falls apart, but I forgot and they stayed together pretty well.  I think the 2nd egg made it stick together.

Good basic recipe. The 2nd time I made these, they came out even better by rolling the formed salmon cakes in panko and dusting with Old Bay seasoning.  I also used fresh cooked salmon because I live in the Pacific Northwest and I'm super picky about my salmon.

Like the other reviews stated, I liked the cakes well enough to try them again and expand upon the recipe more than I already did. I added bacon bits, like you would put on a salad, and twice the black pepper because they appeared to be bland; I also added enough Bob's Red Mill all purpose gluten-free flour to soak up a little of the egg which gave them a delightful little crunch. Next time I will include additional seasonings such as Tarragon as they were a little bland despite the flavor I added.

I have made these a few times now with various modifications and as is.  Turn out great every time and my husband, who is from Denmark, says they taste just like mom's when he was little. Just like some other raters, I mince the onion, sometimes add a little bit of flour, sometimes a little bit of Old Bay spice. Fabulous and simple.

These were very good! I changed it up a little though. I left out the onion and just used minced onion. I also seasoned the salmon with garlic powder and old bay. After forming them into patties, I put flours on the outside and then refrigerated them for about 20 minutes. This kept them from falling apart when frying.

Very easy and very tasty.  I love the simplicity.  I halved the recipe and got two larger cakes from a 6 oz can of salmon.  I did add cajun seasoning.  Served over rice with a runny egg over the top.  At the start it looks like it will never hold together.  Resist the urge to touch the cake and watch as the eggs firm up to hold it all together.  Don't flip until the bottom is browned and firm.

This was my 2nd time making salmon cakes.  The first time with another recipe.  But this time it came out much better.  The only thing I did change was adding a little all purpose flour to hold it all together.  I did that from reading some of the other reviews.  It turned out great.  My family loved it with grits.  I will be making this again.  Thanks

A very simple to follow recipe with good results. A good base to add different kinds of herbs to your liking. The only thing I might suggest is to add a squeeze of lemon/lime to tone down the fishy taste.

It was the end of the month and I couldn't afford any new ingredients. I was looking for a simple salmon cake recipe. This recipe really hit the spot. It was outstanding!  I did add about 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs which seemed to keep it together better.  I used sweet red onions which made it really tasty. You must try this recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I did add a little flour for substance, cornmeal for crunch and a dash of ground cayenne red pepper for  little kick.  My children (ages 2 & 8) loved it!  Served as a breakfast dish (for dinner) with ground cheese grits and scrambled eggs and cheese for some southern charm.  Will definitely add this receipe to my receipe box! Delish!

The kids love it... it's a easy way to get fish in their diet.  I took the other review advise and added the  I also took alittle extra time to remove as many bones as possible.

Simple, but kind of boring - not very flavorful and didn't stick together well.  I will be trying a different recipe next time I make salmon cakes.

Excellent recipe. A whole onion even a small one was a bit much so I only use half. Other than that no changes were made and it was delicious. Thanks!

These are incredible.  I did add a jalepeno pepper, cored,de-seeded and chopped, a 1/4 cup bread crumbs and celery seed.  My mom always served salmon patties and chicken crocettes with cream peas over the top so I did this too.  Could not have been better.

My husband and I loved this! I did roll the patties in seasoned breadcrumbs before putting them in the pan. This recipe is very easy and lends itself easily to a little experimentation. I will make again.

We really enjoyed the salmon cakes.  We added garlic powder to our seasoning and used soy sauce for some extra flavoring.

This recipe turned out wonderful. This was just like me mother would make on Saturday mornings w/butter and sugared rice. I also added a touch of flour to the mix. Will keep this recipe on hand for later.

very very good! i'm munching on it right now! i'm having it with salad with balsamic vinegar dressing adn it's delicious! mind you, i have never eaten a salmon cake before, so this is my first. things i did differently? i didn't have a medium onino, so added green onion instead. also, i added 4 tablespoons of seasoned bread crumbs, one of which i sprinkled on top of the cakes to get a nice color once cooked. also, i added a good amount of 'old bay' seasoning (love that stuff). lastly, i used olive oil insread of veggie oil...tastes good and i'll def be making these again! thanks so much!

I enjoyed this recipe. I have hed some cans of salmon in my cupboard for some time & being a "quasi-purist" I had not thought of any thing clever to make with them. Until now! Easy to customise & make them your own. Thanks Jessica, or rather thank Gradma for me. D.K.C. Sacramento

I used fresh salmon, one egg and added the 1/4 cup of flour as suggested by another user.  I also added some chopped garlic and dried parsley.  I mixed in my food processor.  I was not able to shape individual patties and ended up cooking one big one.  I don't think I'll use the food processor next time.  Very tasty.

Love your grandmother's recipe. So simple with the least amount of ingredients. Tonight's dinner turned out so yummy. My dad loved them too. He loves pepper on or in nearly everything, but it was too much pepper for me, but that's ok. Everyone's tastes are going to vary. We really enjoyed your grandmother's salmon patties. Thank you for sharing it. We miss my grandmother's salmon patties. Her's were so consistent, but I never thought to ask what all she put in her's. My dad said he's pretty certain he remembers she putting saltine crumbs in her's. I am still looking for my grandmother's recipe, but so far, I have not found it since she passed away about 10 years ago. Because she made it so often, she may not have had it written down anywhere or may have gotten rid of it since she knew how to make it so well. So pretty much I'm having to try several variations to figure out what's closest to how she made hers.

I made this using the recipe as listed. It's just like the recipe my mother always made. Simple and delicious. I'm diabetic and always looking for ways to include more protein in my diet.
 I especially like to fix these ahead to use for a healthier breakfast alternative to sausage or bacon. Serve it with a side of scrambled eggs and a slice of whole grain toast. for a really filling meal.

this is a wonderful basic salmon patti recipe..you can't loose with this..i did want to share three things i've discovered over the years..one is pranko bread crumbs, about a half cup, two is lemon pepper, about two teaspoons..or more..and three is, you can mix the entire can and ingredients with your cleanly washed hands..if you feel the bones, just crush them..they are super fine and so easy to blend. No need to fuss over those bones..i will take a guess and think they have added nutrients as well..not sure...anyway, it is a great recipe as is, i did it this way for years..i did discover the smash the bones, add lemon pepper and pranko years later..now i won't have them any other way..oh..and find a good lemon sauce recipe to top them...you will feel like a new chef...thank you for sharing your recipe..

My Mom always added cornmeal but I am on a low carb diet so was excited when I found this recipe. Followed the recipe and chilled the patties for 30 min. They didn't fall apart and cooked-up just as crunchy as my Mom's. They were pretty darn good. Liked the onion. Will spice it up a bit next time. Yep...a keeper!

Next time I would use the suggestions about adding a quarter cup of flour to the mixture to help it stick together. But it was fabulous! Here is what I DID do:
Added thyme, dill & Worcestershire sauce. I sprayed a baking pan heavily with Pam, placed the patties, which I rolled in a bit of flour, onto the baking pan, then sprayed each patty with Pam. I baked in a 375 degree oven for about 20 minutes, turning once. 

Even my picky eater ate all of what was on his plate!

I love salmon patties, and you can use 1 sleeve of saltine crackers if you don't want to guess how much corn flakes to measure out.

I made this tonight basically using this recipe as my base. But instead of using flour or corn flakes like some of you suggested,  I used Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs (3 little handfuls of each) and I chopped up 1 canned jalapeÃ±o.  Talk about yum! I made a double batch and have lunch to take to work tomorrow! Thanks everyone!

Want to try something amazing? I had leftover fish after making 'Firecrackerr Grilled Alaska Salmon' recipe from this site, and used that in making these salmon cakes. Just a little greek plain yogurt on the side for light dipping and you're in heaven......  (disclosure: I did add the tiniest amt of panko crumbs, just because I love them)

This was a hit! I had to sub EVOO as that's what I had on hand, and pink Alaskan wild caught canned salmon. Nice and crispy. My 13 year old wants this as a 'regular'.

OMG!!! I tried these tonight and they came out great. I added some garlic powder, red pepper seasoning, dill, little bit of unflavored bread crumbs and lemon pepper , had some jasmine rice on the side and this was a great dinner in a little bit of time. This made me think Iam actually learning to cook at 44:) Almost forgot I put the cakes in the oven for 30 minutes instead of frying.

Added 1/4 cup of flour then baked at 375 for 20-30 min turning once. Would have been better with potato flakes. Quick and good but I've had better.

Good, but not very exciting.  Held together well, fried up nicely, tasted good, but not something I would serve company.  I love a simple recipe, but this could use a little bit of seasoning.

I was skeptical about this recipe because there are so few ingredients, but decided to try it based on all of the reviews.  The only addition I made was about 1/4 cup of light Bisquick mix.  My husband, who rarely raves about anything made with canned salmon, thought it was amazing!

Very delicious, delicate flavor !  I tried baking them like other readers suggested, they came out moist and stayed firmed up without adding the extra oil.  Perfect for low-carb, gluten free, or low sugar diets!  I served mine over brown rice with some hot sauce, and some spicy slaw.  YUM.  Dinner in under an hour and cheap too!

This recipe needs a couple additions and a little change, first you need to add two slices of bread to the mixture, a 1/4 teaspoon of salt or substitute you make into 4 large patties and after patties are made you need to dip them in flour to coat and fry in Crisco Vegetable oil, fry them and add salt and pepper after they are in the frying pan along with MSG, fry until golden brown on each side, I only need two, so after they are cooked I freeze the other two and just heat up in oven when you need an extra fish dinner. Spray tin foil with Pam put frozen cakes in oven, spray with Pam on top and cook at 350 for 30 minutes,

these are excellent!  I added come almond flour and some coconut flour to thicken up the batter and pan fried them in ghee/clarified butter.  They were very tasty, topped with a lemon/mayonnaise dip and some grilled onions.  highly recommended!

I have never tried salmon cakes before, but my husband loves them so I decided to give it a try. These turned out very good! Very easy to prepare and cook. A couple of the patties started to all apart a little bit, but I just smooshed them back together again and they were fine. If you like salmon I would give them a try for something a little bit different. Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely tasty -- my husband gave it the thumbs up for cooking again.  I used a can of red salmon for the extra flavor punch, but otherwise prepared the recipe exactly as is.  I also made sure to really press drain the salmon first, to help it hold together.

Quite disappointed.  Hardly any flavor, despite adding some cayenne.  Ending up using the patties as fishburgers, but they really needed to be accompanied by tartar sauce.  Might taste a lot better if using fresh salmon.

This is the recipe I've been using for years.  It's quick, easy, and something my family looks forward to eating for dinner.  I've also used the new boneless salmon in the foil packets and it works very well.  I usually use 2 packets and I like not picking out the bones and skin.  While the bones may be undetectable if you crush them up I cannot eat them and would be afraid someone would choke if it wasn't crushed up enough. A sweet onion really makes this recipe.

Loved this recipe exactly as is... I am not allowed any starches or sugars, and it's been hard to find a salmon cake recipe that didn't insist on flour, breadcrumbs, corn meal or whatever. And that there was no sugar in there was ideal as well. I've tried this recipe twice, once with canned salmon, once with salmon fillets I'd cooked up. Both were amazing!

These were okay, but not great.  I found them too dry and the taste of the salmon didn't come through enough for me.  I took another reviewers advise and added 1/4 cup of flour as the recipe looked too wet without it.

It tastes great! I used raw salmon instead and put those in the food processor. Still it is the best!

This recipe was great! Very easy. I did add about 8 crushed Fat Free saltine crackers.  And instead of using an onion, I used Onion, Onion by Tastefully Simple.

this recipie is delicious and since we are on a low carb, high protien diet it is right up our alley!  Even our picky son who gets tired of the "diet" food love it.  For "Rosie", try adding a tsp. or so of Old Bay to add that spice you are looking for.  If you like things hot, try the Old Bay blackening spice instead!  Hope this helps!

These turned out to be a runny mess when I followed the recipe exactly.  I added some bread crumbs and they turned out pretty good but they were still kind of peppery.

I think there were one too many eggs in the recipe because of the way the cakes cooked.  I've made salmon cakes several times, but I thought I would try a different recipe.  I could not get the cakes to cook to the right consistancy.

All my kids ate it!!! I only took out the onion and used onion powder instead because my kids won't eat visible onions :) And, I didn't deep fry, I only sprayed with PAM. AWESOME RECIPE!

My four year old after eating an entire "burger" was upset when he found out that that was the salmon that I made for dinner :)

Easy, quick.
Added a bit more salmon and a bit more pepper. Sauteed onions before adding. 
Great served with roasted asparagus. 
Good even without any tartar, or sauce. Not at all dry. 
I made foil pockets of salmon, veggies separate and froze them to warm in oven another day.

Made it tonight for dinner.  Omitted the onion (husband can't eat it) and added some breadcrumbs as recommended by other reviewers to keep it together.  Fried it in a pan with vegetable oil.  We liked it!  I will make these again.

Great recipe! At the suggestion of others, I made a few adjustments. Added homemade bread crumbs, mayo, old bay, a little garlic pepper seasoning (my own addition) and a little lemon juice. They came out great!

I have cooked this dish often. It is very good any time you prepare it. With a side of grits, rice and gravy, as a snack with a salad and ice tea or lemonade, the salmon  cakes are just delicious. Easy to make and fun.

The flavor was delicious - I followed the lead of those who baked instead of fried. While I did refrigerate the mix prior to making patties, it was liquidy when I spooned them onto the cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil. Perhaps I didn't adequately  drain the salmon. I removed the skin but left the bones. I prepared a sauce using mayo and seasoning. We think the recipe is a keeper.
Thanks Jess!

Just as tasty and easy as my Mom made it and I have been making it for over 38 years. One thing different, add enough flour or unflavored bread crumbs to bind the mixture together.  I never drain what little juice is in the can for the flavor.  This recipe can be used for tuna and some people can't tell the difference.

I added a few more ingredients, old bay spice, worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, diced serrano peppers, bread crumbs and some seasoned flour.  In the end, it came out better than I imagined.  Thanks for adding this recipe, I'll definitely make it again!

Made as written, and while not "bad", they were pretty bland.  I took one reviewers advice to "trust the process" in not adding any binders like bread crumbs or flour and to just let them cook until crispy because the mix is pretty loose.  It did work, and that was great, but...next time, I'll definitely add spices like cayenne pepper, double the minced onion, and add a dash of Worcestershire sauce.

This is an extremely basic recipe, which greatly enhanced by adding half a package of crushed saltine crackers or cracker meal, some finely chopped celery , some chopped parsley/parsley flakes and lemon pepper.  Also, dredging in seasoned flour before browning gives it a nice crispiness.  These are one of my favorites!

I agree that there is no need to remove the bones.  They smash up easily with your fingers or a fork,  and they add protein.  Also, I do add some bread crumbs because my Mom did and she also told me to never buy any salmon unless it is red sockeye.  She said the other stuff is a lot cheaper but it is probably mackerel.

Excellent recipe.  The only change I made was to fry the onions before adding them into the salmon mixture. and putting the salmon cakes in the fridge for about 20 to 30 minutes.

I added 1/4 cup of flour per Miss Deniseâs review, it made it firmer easier to work with. Canât go wrong with two generations recipe tips

These were delicious and easy.  I made the recipe exactly.  I don't understand why people review recipes and change the entire recipe - what's the point.

I had a smaller can of salmon.  I added 4 tablespoons of almond meal flour.  I cooked it in a mixture of olive oil and grass fed butter.  Fantastic!!!  Loved it.

I used leftovers from salmon dinner instead of canned salmon. The mixture seemed too wet so I added Panko, maybe a 1/2 cup. I added panko until the mixture was firm enough to shape patties. I also coated the patties lightly with panko. Delicious!

Oh no. It was perfect just as it was. So so grateful to find this specific recipe. I was so hungry for some salmon patties even half as wonderful as my grandmother's, and to my delight, they were almost nostalgic tasting.** Hey, you're not the one in our family whom she actually trusted enough to give her well-gaurded recipe file to, are ya. Lol!

They are quite messy this way.  Won't hold together very well either.  By adding 1/2 to 3/4 cup bread crumbs really helps make better patties and I like the taste better to.

Made it per the recipe except added some Old Bay seasoning as other reviewers recommended.  And no, you donât need flour or bread crumbs.  I made sure to squeeze out all moisture from the salmon as much as possible and it stayed together just fine.  I also refrigerated the patties for 30 minutes after I formed them just to make sure they didnât fall apart.  Not sure if that was necessary to refrigerate them but others recommended it.  They fried up just great! Will definitely make this again, just a few simple ingredients and very little time to throw it together.

This is the same  recipe  My Mother made...  EXCEPT she always used  Ritz crackers to bind  the recipe...  She always told me one egg to each can of Salmon. We always used two cans, so two eggs and 14 crushed  Ritz crackers ...DELICIOUS...

Great concept but where does one purchase "canned" salmon?  Not sold where I live.  I used fresh wild caught poached salmon and made one batch as written.  My crew was unimpressed.  Not even the cats wanted to eat them.  Back to the drawing board.  Once I stated doctoring with herbs and spices, now we have a recipe.  My group is not a fan of fried food so I baked, broiled, grilled or smoked them.  Use your skills to modify, dill, parsley, thyme all are good choices.  If you prefer a bolder flavor, fresh minced rosemary is quite tasty.  Definitely needs fresh garlic or fresh horseradish or make a horseradish cream to serve on the side.  Serve with a fresh crisp mixed green salad, fresh fruit or grilled vegetables for a beautiful meal.

This is a recipe I grew up eating.  I add about 1/2 c. Dry oatmeal to the salmon, egg mixture and mix well. Adds some fiber and makes the salmon go farther.  I like the idea of chilling in the refrigerator for awhile before frying.  Makes the flavors blend.  We always eat this with fried potatoes.  Yum.

This is ok but I like mine better, I have had it this way but I have done some things different. If you are using canned one (in my opinion) should not only debone it but also remove skin. I no longer use eggs but lightly add Panko or Italian Style Bread Crumbs, onions, and red pepper. I sometimes lightly fry in a little oil or bake the patties they don't fall apart and " My family loves them".

It's a good and simple recipe.  I would have added bread crumbs if I had them just to help with holding them together, but browning them really well before flipping them helped.  I do like that there was no bread fillers in this recipe.

Easy. Haven't made any in years and this recipe was excellent. 

Added finely chopped celery and onion, Italian breadcrumbs and Mrs Dash.

However: I just read the nutrition content. I had four of them for dinner. OOPS. They were small though.  I got 10 out of a 14.5 oz can.

These were so much like my mom's, but she'd laugh if she thought it needed a recipe!  Still I'd forgotten about these until I saw the recipe.  I omitted chopped onion as my husband doesn't like it, however I did add some onion powder and garlic powder.  He said these were really good.  Refrigerating the patties really makes a big differing helping them hold together.  I really dislike the splatters from frying so I loved another reviewers suggestion to bake on a stone.  I think 20 min at 425 would be too long in my oven, but the stone gave it a night crisp texture.  They did brown though not as dark as if fried.  We were fine with that exchange!

Very easy to make.  Baked it at 375 for 25 minutes on parchment paper and did not turn them.  They were good, but we found they needed some kind of sauce, and we used General Tso's Asian Sauce.  We followed the recipe, and really like that there was no flour or bread crumbs in it.  Thank you!

We will make our version again. We only use SUNFLOWER oil in our recipes. We added a little Panko, chopped green onion, 3 cloves of garlic chopped and Cajun spice to the mix, to your taste. 

We served beautiful baked sweet potatoes and fresh green peas as side dishes, both with fresh real butter.

For desert, we had Homemade Key Lime Pie !!!! All was Awesome!!!! ENJOY

I loved the simplicity of the recipe, but I found that the flavor of pepper was overbearing. If I were to make this again, I would significantly reduce the amount of pepper used, and  include some other spices instead.

I made this last week.  My hubby and I are on Weight Watchers and this seemed a great simple entree.  I did add 1/2 cup of seasoned bread crumbs only because I used to use bread crumbs in a salmon loaf recipe.  Also, 1 tsp. dried dill weed and 1 Tbsp of dried parsley. Believe it would have been delish without, but I like dill with fish. I also used 1/2 cup of dill sauce from the All Recipes site, offered by Lisa.  I used lite sour cream.  It made 6 yummy patties. NOTE: I did not remove the bones from the canned salmon, as todayâs thoughts on that are they are soft and can be crushed with your finger, plus they are high in calcium. Thanks JESS4UANDME for this tasty and simple recipe.  Will definitely make it again!   by LOVEMY BIRDS!

This turned out pretty good and tasted like I remembered as a kid.  I wasnât sure at first how it would turn out being my first time making salmon patties.

Great recipe!!!  I used fresh salmon in place of can and fried in olive oil.  The cakes came out very moist.  Will definitely make again and add shrimp.

Delicious! First of all, I forgot how good these are! I completely forgot the eggs! And I was trying to keep it healthy so I only added diced peppers and onions, seasonings to taste. I put just a little flour to hold them together and I broiled them as I didnât want to fry them. They fell apart when I put them on the plate. So, I didnât get a great photo. But they were delicious! I will make them again and again!

This is a good basic recipe. However, true southern style salmon patties require milk gravy. In order to make the true milk gravy you must use Crisco instead of oil. The Crisco makes much better gravy than oil. Also, fry the patties at medium high temp for a shorter time to sear them and they will be moist instead of dry. Use flour, salt, pepper and milk for the gravy just like for breakfast. Be sure to make buttermilk biscuits too. Use veggies of choice for dinner, or eggs grits for breakfast.

Very delish!  Reminded me of the salmon patties my mom made.  I did add a few dry seasonings as a personal preference.  My family loves a little spice so dill and crushed red pepper were included.

                                   P.S I have been writing recipes for 2 weeks and I could never figure out what a cooking pan was called! THANK YOU for reminding me that it is called a skillet XD.

I made this and it was a hit!!! Minor changes: 1) I used 6-8 pieces of pork rinds, crushed, to help bind the mixture. 2) Adjusted the ground black pepper to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp each of ground white pepper, parsley, and mustard. 3) Substituted Grapeseed Oil for the vegetable oil.

I've made this recipe several times a day decided to add some ingredients. they are okay as is, but delicious with the additions.

I only use one egg per can of salmon for starters. I also find that adding seasoned bread crumbs makes a huge difference (omit extra salt if you do this).

other additions:
-dijon mustard
-vegenaise (or mayo)
-worschestire sauce

I don't measure anything but if it's too wet add more breadcrumbs. if it's too dry add more vegenaise.

Mix all of the ingredients except the breadcrumbs and salmon in a bowl. then add the salmon. Lastly, add the breadcrumbs.

Rather than cooking in vegetable oil, I used earth balance (butter could also be used). Heat the earth balance over medium heat and then cook the cakes (4 minutes per side, reducing the time slightly for each batch). I find these additions to be absolutely necessary.

All three of our kids loved these salmon patties.  I added a pinch of dried dill and some crushed up crackers to the mix.  They were nice and crispy on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside.  We will be making this recipe again :)

I love salmon cakes but, have always added crackers or panko bread crumbs to help with binding. I did not think these would stay together but, they did! Nice high-protein,  low-carb recipe. Thank you!

the only extra thing I did was add Italian bread crumbs and let it sit in the refrigerator after I had made the patties until I was ready to fry them. I will make this again for sure.

Ok am a novice cook and really want more fish in my diet.  Couldn't find crab in my local supermarket so decided to tried this.  First of all, if you've never opened a can of salmon before (I hadn't), it's kind of GROSS with the skin all mixed in.  Skin is high in omega-3 fatty acids, and that dissolves completely during cooking.  Added two teaspoons (perhaps a tad too much) of OLD Bay and also some garlic powder to mixture.  Only ONE egg and say 1/4-1/2 bread crumbs.  Refrigerated overnight, and just now had with dill recipe provided here.  It was tasty and maybe a bit of an acquired taste.  Not sure my boyfriend will eat this.  Am going to try crab next time.

Good basic recipe. Easy. Few ingredients. I added a couple of tablespoons of gluten free flour to give the cakes great form. Also baked in the oven on a greased cookie pan and they turned out great.

This was simple and easy.  You may want to adjust the amount of onion to taste but this was very good and easy to make!

This is very similar to the recipe I use to make my salmon patties, but I use a little oats to help bind everything together and also use 1 egg and minced onion, plus a squirt of lemon juice. Another way to help keep the patties together is let it chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. Very yummy!

These were absolutely delicious!  I added additional seasonings to my taste.  I did follow other reviewers recommendations to place the formed salmon patties in the fridge before cooking.  Excellent recipe for low carb dieters!!

I have made this for years now. This recipe makes everyone in my family happy.  It's one of the few that everyone in the family likes.     I was looking for salmon patties that don't have bread or crackers in it and this is it. I will double everything except the pepper(for the kiddies) and  I add garlic salt to make up for the extra pepper.  I don't pick out the bones I just smash them up so no one knows.  That way you get the nutrients.

I made as is with just the following little tweak: I added some onion powder, and garnished with a bit of parsley. You do NOT need to coat these in flour. If your mixture is too wet, you either a) did not drain the salmon well enough or b) did not mix the ingredients well enough. I didn't even bother to form them into patties, I simply spoon-scooped a portion into the hot oil. Turned out fine!

I opted to use just one egg  and added salt to taste; made four patties that fit well into my daily macros. Refrigerating did help to keep it together better. If you are on keto or paleo, you will want to use almond flour, not regular. And of course use a healthier cooking fat (I used coconut oil), not vegetable oil.

I tried this recipe with the crushed cornflakes. It like it needed a little more.  I remember one person mentioned putting sugar  in to take out the tin can taste. I looked in the  fridge and saw some buttermilk pancake mix, the kind you just add water to. So I sprinkled some into the mix, about two or three tablespoons and a shot of water. This would cover the sugar and bind it up a bit more. I baked them, spraying everything with Pam. Excellent. Tasted so yummy. Will make again.

So, here are the modifications I made to the recipe this time: 
added 1/4C flour/4 servings
Added 1.5t Old Bay/4 servings
Baked at 375 for 20 min on greased sheet. 

Here's what I would change for next time: 
Halve the eggs from 2 to 1. The batter was still too runny, even with the added flour. 
Try using cornmeal instead of flour to give it some crunch. 
Possibly season differently.

Similar to what I remember my Mom used to make when I was younger.  I only used 1 egg and I added additional seasonings like garlic powder and onion powder.  I also added about a tablespoon of flour too. I made it with steamed white rice and green beans. Tastes great!

Delicious! I added about a half cup of bread crumbs and baked them at 375 for twenty minutes, per the instructions of another reviewer-- they turned out perfectly. 

I am sure that this recipe would react well to different spice combinations, but it is FANTASTIC as written.

I felt like I needed a bit amount of binding agent so for a healthier version I put raw oats in my food process to make a bread crumb flour of sorts and it worked great. I also sautÃ©ed my onion before adding which gave them a smokey flavor.

Great base recipe. I added 4tbs flour like other users suggested and a pinch of old bay. Next time I will add salt and use less black pepper.

Thanks for the delicious recipe, perfect for low carb eating!  I  have subbed mayo for one of the eggs  and used minced dried onion.  I refrigerate the 6 patties for a short time after forming and fought the urge to add filler.  They cook up beautifully brown and crispy and moist inside.  I sometimes eat these with a dill pickle as I had them growing up and like the different spices I have tried - curry, lemon pepper, dill and garlic.  I even like them as cold leftovers.

i think its a good basis for salmon cake but I had problems without adding breadcrumbs maybe because my salmon was just cooked and warm. It is great quick way to get my kid to eat fish. Thanks!

Pretty darned good. I usually add cornbread as a filler to my salmon patties, but I'm trying to cut gluten out of my diet so I tried this recipe. It was a little too watery so I added about 1/4 cup ground oatmeal (just put oatmeal in my food processor for a few seconds). The taste was great so even without the oatmeal I'm sure it would have been just as tasty, but It seemed a little too watery without a filler of some sort.

This was great! I had to add a can of  tuna as it was way too wet, maybe only needed one egg. Also big tip...TURN YOUR EXHAUST FAN ON!  I forgot & my house smells of fish! YUCK.. Super recipe ~ browned up beautifully. Next time might add green pepper. Served salsa on the side.
