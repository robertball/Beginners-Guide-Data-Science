I cooked it in a Dutch oven on a wood cookstove for hours and substituted Merlot for for the cooking sherry and skipped the orange juice. I also altered the quantities and used fresh spices.  After the meat was falling apart tender I added potatoes to the pot. Then 30 minutes before serving added carrots.   Excellent one pot meal.
