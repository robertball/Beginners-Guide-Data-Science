I used organic chicken broth, organic tomato sauce, my own homemade taco seasoning mix, long-grain rice and I omitted the olives, only because my kids aren't really fans. I used 2% sharp cheddar and about half called for. That was plenty, to be honest without upping the calories too much.

I adjusted this recipe to use in my rice cooker.  I use the chicken broth, 8oz tomato sauce, taco seasoning, and rice (not instant).  I add 14.5 oz of water, put it all in the rice cooker to cook.  Add the chesse after it's done.  This is a favorite of mine, and sometimes make just this for dinner.

OOhhh boy, this was not my favorite, BUT, I didn't hate it either.  My lil' guy LOVES taco's and LOVES rice, so I thought that this would fit the bill.  He liked it O.k, but I thought it to be odd.  I added extra water to it, because as DREGINEK mentioned, it was a bit potent, and instead of adding black olives, I added black beans (which was a nice addition).  I think that it could have used a can of mexican diced tomatoes.  That would have done it.  An O.K. recipe, thanks Kristine.

I didn't have any store-bought taco seasonings, so I used "taco seasoning II" from this site. I think this would be really good IN soft shell tacos (chicken or beef) but we were only so-so on this recipe as a sidedish. The taco seasoning - although good-was just too dominant tasting when served as a side by itself. Also, I used 2c rice and this thickened to the perfect consistency. I might make this again for either a taco filling or reduce the amt of taco seasonings when served as a side.

This was very good.  I didn't use the black olives (we don't like them), but I think it was great without them.  We also used Colby Jack blend cheese instead.  It turned out great.  Thanks for the post.

probably the closest to authentic spanish rice i've made.  instead of the chicken broth, i used a goya sazon.  i also added black beans.  this would also taste good w/ corn added in.

If you've rated this recipe lower than a 5 I'm going to guess it's b/c you changed the recipe.  If this is the case I suggest you re-make the recipe and actually follow it and THEN rate it.  I made it as suggested and I find it to be amazing, delicious and I will make it again!  It went perfectly w/ the Poblano Chile Enchiladas from Allrecipes!

Made this to compliment a mexican lasagna dish, added corn & it was a hit.  Very little leftovers & those were gone in a flash the very next day.  Will be making it again because it was so easy & very yummy!

I sauteed some chopped onion and green pepper and added that to the rice leaving out the black olives. I liked the method of boiling the broth(I actually used water seasoned with chicken boiulon - and no I don't know how to spell that!!) and tomato sauce together then "steaming" the rice in that. This turned out nicely and I will use this recipe again. I still haven't used bagged rice yet to scared it won't turn out.

I cooked everything in my rice cooker.  I used stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, long cooking rice, no olives, added corn instead.  After reading most reviews, I only used half a packet of taco seasoning, next time I will use the whole packet (and there will be a next time!!!).  One last thing I added - cooked ground beef.  Everyone loved it, thanks for such an easy recipe!

This was pretty good, but I had to substitute boullion for the broth, and diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce (this was what I had on hand).  My sweet daughter in law bought handmade tamales, and we needed a side dish in a hurry.  This fit the bill with my substitutions.  The family liked it.  I would probably make again, following the directions to try it as written.  All in all, a great recipe!

I have made this recipe a few times now...it's awsome...we omit the black olives and use tomato sauce as well as a can of rotel style tomatoes (w/ green chiles).  I cook it as a side to burritoes, enchiladas, quesadillas, and fajitas....thanks for a great recipe

This recipe is AWESOME! We LOVED it! Black olives is one of our favorite foods so this is perfect. I had no idea how to put rice in tacos and have it taste good. Now I know how to make is taste amazing. Thanks so much! And I can't believe I had all the ingredients already. Although I didn't have "instant rice", I just made some in 15 min. and added the rest of ingredients. I fried corn tortillas, made some taco-seasoned shredded chicken with diced tomatoes, put that on first and then the rice mixture. It held all the chicken in place and no need to top with cheese since it's already mixed into the rice, just some sour cream. YUMMY!

I thought at first that 6 oz. of black olives was too much, but I was wrong.  It didn't take long to prepare and was done as soon as my taco meat was done.

I made some changes based on other reviews, and was very happy with the result!

I used long grain rice (not instant) because it was all I had, and simply adjusted the cooking time accordingly.

I used only half the packet of taco seasoning.

I omitted the olives and added refried beans instead (was going to do black beans but didn't have 'em).

The end result was very tasty.  It still had enough spice to be good, and was a little more substantial than rice alone wouldn't been. I will definitely make this again!

Well now! Easy and tasty. I added a little hot sauce and a pinch of sugar. The sour cream is what made it. We liked it and we'll have it again.

I have made this recipe in the past and its also good reheated. To add to it , I have cooked skinless chicken breast in a skillet and red pepper and have added that to it for something diffrent. Also try using the mexican cheese instead of cheeder for more authentic flavor

I use long grain brown rice in all my rice dishes. I cook the rice before hand and then add all the ingredients. Also I use only 4 oz can of diced olives (small can of Lindsay olives) My husband loves it and has asked for me to make it several times in a row. And it is easy too!

I added onions and salsa and it was a big hit.  The cheese really helps to thicken the recipe.

Great recipe.  I added salsa as suggested and it's great.  Not nearly as dry as mexican rice.

It was okay. I was kinda disappointed and so was my fiance. He said it just tasted like taco seasoning and that's it. I would add salsa next time to see how it would turn out.

This was a good recipe, but mine turned out a little soupy. I will cut back on the liquid next time. Overall, it was good. I topped my rice with chopped tomato and refried beans and served with tortilla chips and scoopers. Yummy!!!!

I really liked this. I changed it very slightly by leaving out the black olives and cutting the taco seasoning in half. I was thinking it would probably be too strong with the whole packet of seasoning. When I went to add the rice it seemed like it was not nearly enough rice for all the liquid so I added maybe half a cup more. With these small changes it turned out awesome. This was quick and you could really change it up by added different ingredients. I will make this again for sure. Thanks so much!

Just what I was looking for. Great flavor. Will definitely be a favorite. Very easy and everything is on hand. Thanks for the great recipe. Was even great the next day for leftovers. Thought it would dry out but it didn't. Thanks again for a great recipe.

This is a great side dish.  I doubled the recipe, using 2 cans of broth, 1 - 15 oz can of tomato sauce and 2 cups of long grain rice.   Mixed the broth, tomato sauce, taco seasoning and rice together, let it come to a boil, then let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes.  It came out perfect!  I also stirred the sour cream directly into the rice mixture.  So good!

I normally only cook the recipes that have 5 stars.  Last night I was making chicken enchiladas and I needed a side dish and I needed it fast.  I clicked on Allrecipes for a recipe and this was the only one that I had all of the ingredients in my pantry.  My husband LOVED it!  MUCHO GRACIES!

this was great!  i was making chicken quesadillas and wanted to throw some extra oomph in since i didn't have much chicken on hand and this was perfect.  i added enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce, as i didn't have any on hand.  i'm sure it would be good w/ tomato sauce, but the flavor of the enchilada sauce so tasty!!  will definately keep this recipe in my arsenal!  in fact, using the leftovers tonight as a filler for beef burritos!

Wow! What a great side dish! Served this tonight with salsa chicken and beer margaritas (both from this site). Followed the directions to a T except for substituting taco seasoned shredded cheddar cheese for mild cheddar called for. Opened a 1.25 oz. pkg. of taco seasoning and used 1 T for salsa chicken and rest for this (probably very close to the 1 oz. called for). I was worried at first b\c my rice seemed "soupy", but by the time my bf and I helped ourselves to a second serving, it was just right! Thanks for a great recipe to add to my collection. : )

This recipe is yum! Hubby loves it just the way it's written. Only thing I did different was followed the directions on the rice box...add rice, simmer for 5 min then let sit covered for 5 min. I've also added different things from time to time....brown instant rice, corn instead of black olives, a little onion. Really whatever you like in your Mexican rice. But the basic recipe is very good

I followed the recipe only omitting the olives.  It was so good that I took a chance and added 1lb of browned minced turkey. Served with warmed taco shells, chopped tomatoes, chopped cucumber, shredded lettuce, shredded cheese and sour cream.  It passed the 11 yr. old very picky eater test!

I made it vegetarian by using veggie broth. I also don't like olives, so I omitted those. Overall, the flavor was strong, so that was good. I mixed in a little vegan sour cream and cheese and it was tasty. It was so easy to make. I will probably make it again in a pinch, since I pretty much always have those ingredients in the pantry, but it's not my favorite.

Made it according to recipie. It was good. The spices I used were too salty. I will try and make this again from my own home made from scratch taco seasoning. I think that will make it better.

This was really good and so easy.  Terry liked it too.  Be great with any enchiladas, etc.  Forgot the sour cream when serving, but will add it when we have the leftovers.

Absolutely loved this! Flavors were great. I added kidney beans and small amount of frozen veggies that were left over. Will continue to make this often.

I used Manchego cheese instead of cheddar.  that's what i had in the house.  It is absolutely delicious.  We had this with fish taco's and slaw.  I will most definitely make again.  we really enjoyed it.

Much better than Mexican rice in any restaurant. I served it with a Veracruz-Style Snapper (a Chef John recipe on Allrecipes.com) and a simple spinach salad.

For a last minute rice, this was pretty good!  I used instant brown rice and did not add in any of the olives or cheese just to keep it on the 'healthier' side. This went great with our taco dinner and the family seemed to like it. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe was pretty good, and my whole family ate this one! I did make this in the rice cooker, and it turned out perfectly done. I was afraid at first that there would be too much liquid for the rice cooker, but I worried for nothing. The flavor with the tomato sauce and the taco seasoning was great too. I did use a packaged taco seasoning mix, but next time I think I might mix up my own spices for this because I did think it was a little salty. No big deal though, and it still tasted great! Very easy side dish to make along side any Mexican/Southwestern dish. Thank you for the recipe, MOTOR MOUTH!

Great basic starter rice recipe. I wanted to use what I had in the house for beans and rice and this was it. I used homemade taco seasoning and tomato sauce and added pink, pinto and kidney beans plus diced up kielbasa. Huge hit with lots of compliments at wrestling tournament fundraiser.

1) We use black beans instead of black olives. I think the beans add a great, complimentary texture. (Get rid of the extra juice if using a can of beans.)
2) We add nearly half a chicken (precooked) to the recipe.
3) Sometimes, I think it needs extra seasoning, so we'll add an additional 1/2 packet of taco seasoning.
Finally, we like to serve this deliciousness up with tortilla chips, guacamole, sour cream and salsa, all on top! Although, the recipe stands well all on it's own. SO GOOD!

Just OK.  I think it depends on the brand of taco seasoning you use.  I'll try it again with a different brand because of the easy preparation.

The was so good and so yummy!  I did make some alterations as I did not have have the exact ingredients.  I only had regular long grain rice, so I used 2 cups of chicken broth (I only had bouillon on hand, so 2 cups water, tsp chicken bouillon), a little over half a 15oz can of tomato sauce, and the taco seasoning.  I brought that to a boil and cooked the rice per the instructions (2 cups rice in boiling water (ie liquid) for 15 min covered, mix, let sit for 5 min covered off of heat.  I then added the cheese (I used co-jack) and added the rest of the tomato sauce, and the olives.  I made chicken tacos out of it.  So good!!!!

Tasty Spanish rice! I did not use the instant rice, so  it did need extra time to cook. I probably should have boiled the mixture longer before turning on low. He gave it a 3/5, this isn't really his preferred flavor of rice, but he agreed it would be good rice for a burrito or tacos. While I give this a 4/5 - the cheese and sour cream gave it a creamy texture and topped of the delicious flavor. Good recipe! Would make again.

This was a hit in our house!  Like the others, I used 1 cup long grain rice, 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes, ground beef, 14.5 oz can of corn and omitted the olives.  I was adventurous and used beef broth instead of the chicken broth and whole pack of Taco Bell taco seasoning!  I added the shredded cheese to each serving, but no sour cream!

i just got done making this recipe, and i think i have a new fave with a couple changes (hence the 4 stars). i used 2C instant brown rice to make it thicker. added one can of black beans, drained and rinsed, and a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes after the rice was done cooking and returned it to low heat to warm through. i omitted the olives because i'm not a fan.  also, instead of using a packet of taco seasoning i used 2T of "taco seasoning I" from this site. i didn't think it even needed the sour cream or cheese so why add the fat and calories.  i guess you could put a dollop of sour cream on top and a sprinkling of cheese to serve. really good base recipe though.

This was good and very simple. I made it with quinoa, fresh tomatoes pureed with tomato paste, and my own taco seasoning (green and red chili powder, cumin, garlic). Instead of cheese and sour cream, I mixed in fresh guac, and I added a splash of red wine vinegar and some roasted green chiles, which gave it a nice kick. This would be great in a burrito.

This was fine - nice and quick.  The flavors tasted a little strange together but was easy to put together at the last minute.  Honestly I'd rather just fix a Lipton rice side.  But thank you for the recipe!

Easy taco rice.  I used Bill Echol's taco seasoning recipe for this.  In addition, I omitted the olives.

I made this just as written and really liked it. We eat mexican food at least 2x per week and this was a nice addition. We will definately have this again.

This was a hit. I actually used the microwave long grain rice. Put 2 bags in for 90 seconds and then added after broth, sauce and seasoning boiled. Didn't use olive however, did add salsa as others had suggested and came out very nice Thanks

This dish was a hit. I couldn't believe that my boys as well as my husband liked it so much.  I served it with beef and cheese enchiladas and there was a little bit left. I'm sure when I serve leftovers it will be eaten quickly.

I had to keep adding water to this to soften the rice. Rice came out chalky tasting--not good!

I'm not usually one to say bad things about a recipe, most that I've tried here are very good, but this was not one of them.  Very tomato tasting for taco, Rice mixes from a box are much better.
