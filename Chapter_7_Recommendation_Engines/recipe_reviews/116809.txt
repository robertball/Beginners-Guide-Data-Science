It was so odd because I was originally going to make just a classic italian pasta salad for my friend's baby shower. I for some reason though, decided to pick up creamy italian dressing instead of the regular not knowing if it would be good. I then came across this recipe, and am I glad I got the creamy! This was amazing! I made a 32 cup bowl full of it this afternoon and its almost gone, and there were not THAT many people here! I used all of the veggies, except for the peas (accidentally) I can't wait to try it next time with them in it!

Very good! I, too, left out the veggies I didn't care for. I used two cans of mixed vegetables to make up for what I didn't use. I think a tangier dressing like a creamy caesar would be better. I used Campanelle pasta because I think it's prettier than spirals.

Edible, but not our favorite pasta dish. You will need to half the recipe, it made so much that we had to throw half of it out.

I didnt think it would need all the dressing but it did. I only picked the vegetables I liked, not all of them. Pretty good.
