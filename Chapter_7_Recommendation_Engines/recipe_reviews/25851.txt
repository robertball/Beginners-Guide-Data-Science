Yummy, and beautiful color.  I have prepared this drink many times now.  Very enjoyable, everyone who tastes it enjoys it.  I could not find superfine sugar so used regular sugar and turned out fine.  Also used pink grapefruit juice for best color.

Wondeful drink!  It's the best drink I've made for myself at home, ever.  I didn't use any sugar as I didn't have the superfine sugar and didn't think it needed it anyway!

This was very good - actually drinking it now.  I used fresh squeezed grapefruits and regular sugar.  I added a splash of maraschino cherry juice and one cherry.  It was beautiful with the grapefruit pulp and the cherry.  Very tasty.

MMMMMMMMMM....so, so good, even without the sugar. Perfect drink to sip while sitting on the porch and enjoying those ocean breezes. I think I'll rename it "Wildwood Crest Breeze"! Thanks so much Chris!

This is good, but I agree with another reviewer that it was missing something. I added just a little grenadine and a bit of Rose's lime juice. I also used fresh squeezed grapefruit juice (good sale on fresh grapefruits this week!). I'd make this again. Would be perfect for a Girls Night In. This did the trick today with me, sitting here wishing for summer.

I really like it - I'm drinking it now. However it needs something, lime maybe? I'll try it. But otherwise it is very interesting. Not a combination I would have thought of.
