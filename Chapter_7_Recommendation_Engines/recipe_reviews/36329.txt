This is a very good coleslaw recipe. I replaced half the mayo with the reduced fat type and it still tasted great. I would recommend using less salt unless you are a salt lover. It was a bit too salty for our taste.

This was good.  I left out the 1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt because of the previous review and replaced it with 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder.

My hubby loved this! I have been trying for 3 years to find a coleslaw recipe and this is it. I added a 1/2 tsp more vinegar (hubby likes a kick) and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder and used only 1 tsp seasoned salt. Also, I used Vegenaise instead of mayo. This is going in the family cookbook!!  Thanks...

Everywhere that I have taken this coleslaw it has been a hit!  In fact, now I just print off recipes to give to people because I know that someone will ask!

A very easy recipe to make and it's very tasty.  Instead of all the seasonings I just used 2tsp of Herbamare sea salt (you can but this at a health food store) and it adds just the right zest for the salad.

The key to this slaw really is letting it "marinate" for a couple of hours.  It brings the flavors together really well.  If you don't like salt I suggest cutting it in half and if you like your slaw more sweet than tangy then you'll need to add some sugar but we found that for our tastes it was great as is.  Went perfectly with some pulled pork barbeque and southern baked beans!

It's a good recipe. My husband likes it; it's a bit too vinegary to me though. I dont have the seasoned Salt, so, i just added a pinch of salt and pepper. Also, I add a little milk to the coleslaw, because I feel that the mayo mixture was a little too thick. The cerely seed is a must for the colesalw! It actually tastes much better after you mix them and refrigerate for a while.  
For next time, I think I will start with just 1 Tbp of vinegar, and work from there.

This is a really good recipe, but it makes an awful lot-- consider halving it if you are making it for less than 6 people.  I don't know how much the recipe considers a serving size but this makes a giant bowl of slaw.  Also, make this with white vinegar--please DON'T do what I did another time and use apple cider vinegar.  It was absolutely awful and I had to throw it away.  Stick to white vinegar, halve the recipe and it is awesome.  One other thing-- I've made this with both regular mayonaisse and Miracle Whip Salad Dressing.  My husband and I prefer the dressing because it makes the slaw much sweeter, but you may like it with regular mayo as it calls for.  Also, I usually eliminate the season salt altogether if I make this for myself and my husband, but use it for company.  A more healthy alternative to season salt is premixed Salad seasoning, or Accent.

Very good slaw dressing!  Not quite sweet enough for us so added 2 pkts Splenda.  Used red wine vinegar and light mayo.  Also added a dash of garlic powder and onion powder and omitted celery seed because we don't care for it.  Will definitely make again!

Not bad not the best.  Maybe could use some onion.  I'll stick with "Restaurant Style Coleslaw I" from this site.

This was so easy it was silly. Easy and delicious. The only change I'd make is that next time I'll cut back on the celery seed a little.

This is the best coleslaw recipe I have ever tried! I only had about 8 cups of cabbage and it still came out so wonderful! The celery seed makes this taste soo good! Try it!

I think this is one of my favorite coleslaw recipes I've ever tasted.  It's nicely tangy and the celery seeds add just the right kick to the cabbage!  I used red wine vinegar, and it was fabulous.

I like this recipe because it is not drenched in mayo. It has good flavors that do not overpower the veggies.

I do not consider myself to be a coleslaw person but enjoy this recipe. Friends also like when I make this recipe. (Edit: to this day this is the only coleslaw I can truly say I like)

Great Recipe and used the helpful hints from the other reviews by reducing salt to 3/4 tsp., added a Small Onion Shredded, a touch more Vinegar and Onion & Garlic Powder for more Zing.  Excellent :-)

My family came over for a fish fry and I made this coleslaw, it actually came out tasting better than I expected. Everyone LOVED it, The only thing I did differently, was used bagged coleslaw to save time and red wine vinegar.

Thank you for the great recipe. This recipe has my hubby eating cabbage.
