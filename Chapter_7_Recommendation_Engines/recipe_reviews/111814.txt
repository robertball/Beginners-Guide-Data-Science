This is a good base. I did make a couple changes. I doubled the beef, used frozen shredded hash browns instead of patties, and added onion to the beef while it was cooking. I omitted the green beans and jalapeno. I cooked 4 slices of bacon and crumbled that into the beef/hash brown mix as well as garlic and chili powder and half a can of cheese soup. I halved the peppers and prepared them as noted in the directions. Once the peppers were stuffed I topped each one with the remaining cheese soup and some shredded cheddar. When done I topped the peppers with sour cream and served. It was delicious! A good alternative to the traditional stuffed peppers.

My family all enjoyed this. I found the mixed ingredients looked a bit dry and uninviting, so added the better part of a can of Heinz tomato soup to moisten and flavou - I think this was an important addition as it held it all together. I also added about a tsp of cumin instead of just a pinch. My kids usually only like peppers raw on a veggie plate or in Greek Salad, so this was a victory. The 10 min. soak in boiling water nicely prepared the peppers for a quick baking, but they were still firm enough to stuff. I will try stuffing them with Spanish 
Rice on another occasion. Thanks for the inspiration!

This was a great recipe. We didn't use the greenbeans and we doubled the beef. We added a red onion to the beef as it was cooking. Another thing we did was to salt and pepper to taste. Overall the cooking directions were great.

I browned meat in skillet, removed to colander to drain, cooked frozen shredded hashbrowns in same skillet to almost done, returned meat to hashbrowns, added a can of Rotel and shredded cheese, then stuffed peppers- omitted green beans, also, mine kept falling over when I was placing in baking dish, so I put peppers in my cupcake pan to cook!  Worked out really well.

This was a very tasty recipe but I modifies it a bit, I made homemade hashbrowns instead of using frozen, I nixed the beans and replaced them with onion and peppers. I flavored meat and potatoes with garlic,black pepper,paprika,cumin,worceshire sauce and a touch of hot sauce.

I used fresh potatoes shredded & cooked them with chopped portabella mushrooms & onion. I also added homemade salsa to the beef mixture. This was EXCELLENT! My husband absolutely loved this. I will definitly be making this again.

It is a great base recipe.  I did what it called for but added sour cream too.  I'm thinking that if the green pepper was chopped up it would make an excellent skillet or potluck dish.  I'm also thinking about adding corn next time.

Some variations: I like to add a little sweet potato when I can, in addition to the other potatoes/ hash browns. It makes the flavor more complex. I usually have more filling left over than will fit inside the bell peppers, so we eat the leftovers with corn tortillas. Sometimes I add a little chopped bell pepper, and then dispense with stuffing the filling into whole chopped peppers, and we eat it ALL with the tortillas. 

I found that this recipe is best with mild anaheim peppers - Anaheims are slightly spicy, just enough to add some warmth but not enough to burn your mouth. Green bell peppers are pretty good, too. I didn't like it with sweet red peppers, however.

This recipe was great I put a little more cumin than it called for. I liked these better than regular stuffed peppers.  Great idea for those who can't have tomatoes.

Okay, so I substituted corn for the green beans, and added a jar of roasted tomato & chipotle salsa for liquid, but this dish was AWESOME. My son actually ate a whole serving of green pepper!!

Hashbrowns made a nice change for a stuffed pepper dinner.  I added a little tomato sauce, a little worcestershire sauce and dash of A1 sauce so that the inside was not dry.  Keep the pepper in the boiling water over heat for five minutes so that it will be more tender when the peppers are done baking.

I too like this recipe but modified it.  I added a can of Cheddar Cheese Soup to the cooked beef and also browned l/2 lb. sage sausage to add to the meat mix.  Once mixed together, added crispy onions, topped stuffed peppers with shredded cheddar and a dash of parmesan. Much better.

Good base recipie...made adjustments.
Cooked beef with onions,pinch of chopped garlic. Added beans, cheese, and can of cream of mushroom soup when meat is no longer pink. 
I used shredded hashbrowns and added half to the mix. Put the mix into a casserole dish and topped the mix with the other half of the hashbrowns for the topping.

I personally don't care for bell peppers so I'm basing this review off of what my husband said and how quickly he ate this and requested it again! :)

I changed this up somewhat due to what I had and didn't have.  I used frozen hash browns, deer sausage instead of hamburger meat and I didn't have any green beans.  I used red, yellow and green bell peppers.  This turned out very tasty and it was super easy.

You guys did a great job!  Made something simple and delicious!  The stuffed peppers are still in the oven, but I can tell they are going to be delicious.  How can they not?  The beef mixture was delicious and the peppers are too.  Woops, forgot to say I left out the green beens, but that was a personal preference.

I didn't stuff this wonderful mixture into peppers as suggested (Being out of season they are quite expensive, but I will try this mixture again when the price comes down during the summer). So I did an adaptation by placing baked tater tots on the bottom of a casserole dish, then topped them with the beef mixture and finally spread a cheese sauce on top. I substituted a can of diced green chilies for the jalapeno, as that would have been a little too much heat for me. And the sauce recipe that I used instead of just straight Cheddar also came from this site as well...Real Welsh Rarebit. Together the two recipes were spectacular, not dry at all! It was thoroughly enjoyed by all who joined us for dinner & a movie that cold winter evening. Thank you Beckerkorn for sharing your recipe!

We are not a big greenbean family so instead of greenbeans i added diced fresh mushrooms and a can of rotel (do not drain) I put mine in a small baking dish and added a tiny bit of water to the bottom for easier clean up.
They are suprisingly filling , hubby liked them and they were fast. Will make them again when kids come to visit.

Modified a bit.  One pound beef, half can roi tel (no juice), cumin, frozen hash browns, one can of golden mushroom soup, onion, and green beans.  Stuffed and covered with shredded cheese.  Served with long grain wild rice and some grape tomatoes.
