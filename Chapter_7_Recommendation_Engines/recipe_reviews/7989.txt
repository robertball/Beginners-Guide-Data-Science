WOW!! This cake is so great, you just have to try it!  I did make one change...I didn't have ground cloves, so I added an extra tsp of cinnamon. This HUGE cake bakes to a very dark color and has a very moist texture. I made a simple glaze using milk and powdered suger which I drizzled over the top. PERFECT PERFECT...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! This one is definitely going into my permanent recipe box! Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake is wonderful! Just the thing for a breakfast cake in place of muffins.  I added cinnamon to the apples, used all brown sugar in the cake batter, switched the proportions of wheat to white flour.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 glass cake dish, topped with oatmeal streusel, for 20 mins at 400 and turned the heat down to 325 for 55 mins.

This recipe is now a holiday favorite with my family and friends.  I bake it in an angel food cake pan and it works great!  In my opinion, it serves more than 14.  We eat it for breakfast as well as dessert.  Very good!!

I made some alterations, it still tasted GREAT!  (At first I thought, 'This looks like a lot of work.' And, 'What's a tube pan?'  I didn't want to wait an hour and a half to be able to eat it so I made muffins with it & THAT only took about 26 minutes wait.  ;)  It really wasn't THAT much work & SURE WAS WORTH IT!  (After consulting with my mother, we suspect a "tube pan" is like a bundt cake pan.)  OH!  PS 3/8 CUP = 6 TABLESPOONS . . . right?

This was very good. I put cream cheese icing on the cake. I did use less butter and added some of my homemade apple sauce. A good recipe to use up some apples off of my tree.

I added an extra 1/2 tsp of the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves and I added a 1/2 tsp of allspice.  I was afraid it would be too dry, but it turned out really good.  It wasn't a moist cake, but it wasn't too dry either.  The flavor is very good.

yum!  and yes, you do use MARGARINE IF: you are eating this dessert with a meat dish... KOSHER meals do  not mix meat and dairy!!! and if you are vegan, or lactose intolerant or you do not want to be 40 pounds overweight..  =)  FYI, i used palm oil shortening found at whole foods and my local co-op. no saturated trans fat nor animal fat from butter. it was delicious.

A really nice cake.. rises well, and is very dense..would be great as a muffin for the morning as well. As with all the recipes I find on here...I always customize to my liking, with this one I upped the nutmeg to a full tsp for the batter. When I cooked the apples I added another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the mixture and included a Tbsp of orange zest as well. It went over great, but since I am not a huge fan of raisins..next time I will leave them out, and add 5 or 6 cups of apples. This will add moisture to the cake, which is a tad heavy ..not necessarily dry, and it will give you more apple in every bite..YUM.

Great cake.  Very "old-fashioned" taste and texture.  It does make a large cake, though; the batter was going to overflow my 10-inch bundt pan, so I carefully poured the batter into a deeper tube pan (hard to do with a very full silicon bundt pan...) and the finished cake rose high over the rim of the tube pan!  I used four Granny Smith apples, switched the proportions of white vs. whole-wheat flour (probably making a denser cake), and used brown sugar to "stew" the apples.  Didn't need any frosting.  I'm giving a quarter of the cake to the guys who shoveled my walk today!  Thanks, Carol!

This was so-so.  The cake was just a little bland, maybe adding more spice to the mix would help.  It was also pretty heavy, and tended to dry out quickly when served.

I love spice cake like none other and after moving I just didn't have enough room for all my apples I canned last year, so this sounded great to me. I didn't have any wheat flour so I just used all purpose instead and I did my spices more like I would for an apple pie.  I also used some of my canned spiced apple cider instead of water - AMAZING FLAVOR!!!  I also followed someone elses tip about baking it in a 9x13 pan (20 min @ 400 followed by 55 min @ 325). Turned out so delicious!  Moist yet dense. A little milk/powered sugar glaze on top and it's so worth the effort. Wonderful for dessert or as a breakfast cake. Thanks for sharing!

I listened to the other reviews and doubled the spices on the recipes which made it very tasty.  I also used cream cheese frosting to melt on the top and allow to drizzle down (right after removing from pan).  The cake itself is good with or without the frosted top but is rather dense and BIG.  A small piece was rather filling for me!

I thought this cake was very good. The cake is very dense, almost like bread, so it tasted great with a little butter on it and a cup of tea.
