My boyfriend loved these. I made it as an omelette instead of scrambled eggs, and made a couple of changes. First, I sauteed the onions until they were tender. Then, I added the bacon bits to the onions and mixed them until they were combined. Then, I poured the egg mixture (which was only the eggs and the milk) over the onions and bacon. I mixed the eggs around a bit until curds started to form, and then reduced the flame to low, and covered the pan. I let the eggs cook for about 5 minutes. Then I sprinkled the cheese over the eggs, covered the pan again, and let them cook for another 3 minutes. When the omelette was finished, I slid it onto a large plate, folding it in half. My boyfriend could not get over how delicious these were. Try it my way... you won't be disappointed ;)

We used mayo instead of milk.  I read somewhere were this made eggs yummy.  We were out of onions so we omitted them.  Next time I will make with the onions maybe even caramelized onions.  A++ Recipe!

This is a Sunday morning tradition! My husband just loves bacon (so I add a little more) this goes great with Herbie's Home Fries from this site and so I don't feel too guilty I serve it with whole wheat toast and some fresh fruit.

This recipe was just not right for me.  I followed it exactly but ended up with a soupy mess.  Because the cheese was added before cooking, the oil in the cheese separated and I ended up having to drain the eggs before serving. The bacon lost its crispness as well because it was cooked with the eggs. The flavor however was very good.  I will make this again but just cook the eggs with milk and onion first until they are done.  Then I will stir in the cheese and bacon until the cheese melts.  This was the bacon will stay crisp and the oil will not have time to separate from the cheese.

While I didn't stray from the ingredients (except omitting the milk, never did like milk in my eggs) I did change how I cooked it.  I pre-cut the bacon and cooked the onion with the bacon then drained that but reserved a small amount of grease in the pan.  I added the eggs, bacon, and onions back to the pan at once, didn't bother mixing in a bowl.  Once the eggs were done I added the cheese.  I took a tortilla and warmed it on the flame of my gas burner and used the butter on the tortilla.  Filled it with the egg mixture.  Yum!

Perfect for my low-carb diet.  I didn't use any butter for the eggs, I just drained the majority of the bacon grease and cooked the eggs in that.  I didn't add salt due to the salt content in the cheese and bacon.  I even made these the night before and they were yummy this morning.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make this recipe a little different.  I sauteed the onions ahead of time with some celery just untill they're tender.  Intead of bacon i cut up pieces of ham and put them in.   Wait untill the eggs are almost cooked before adding the cheese.   The sauteed onions and celery give it the best flavor.

Add your cheese when the eggs are nearly done, the taste gets lost when mixed with everything else.

This is my favorite way to cook eggs. I cook mine in some of the leftover bacon fat instead of butter and add a lot of Frank's. I keep everything else the same. It's a breakfast that sticks with me all morning. Want to trash it up even more? Serve 'em with stuffed, covered and smothered hashbrowns. You'll drop down to your knees and thank God for such food.

I usually don't need a recipe for scrambled eggs, but wanted to use my camera.  So, I made this recipe as written, but cooked the minced onion with the bacon. Also used seasoning salt instead of the salt and pepper.  These are really, really good.  DH said I had out done myself this time. A keeper in his books.

If you want fluffy eggs, beat the egg whites with the milk until frothy and then add the yolks and beat. Do not cook on high heat. Patience is all it takes.

Wonderful recipe!
My only suggestion would be to cook the bacon less during the first step because it will continue to cook with the eggs the second time around. Also I like my bacon to be a little softer so that is another reason I cooked it less the first time.
5 *'s, defanitley will make again.

I love scrambled eggs, I stayed with the ingredients but felt this was Too much onion for 2 eggs. I used a Tablespoon of finely sliced fresh green onions and added the cheese just as the eggs all began to set. I don't stir my eggs when cooking, I use a rubber spatula and push the cooked egg to the center allowing the liquid egg to flow thru and begin to cook. Much more tender and fluffy.

I have made this for years.  Any thing can be added to the scrambles eggs.
I love to add celery.  I top it with chopped tomato when I get it on the plate.  For her measurements, she has the amounts about right on!
I have also used cooked sausage and left over taco meat.
This is a very filling recipe and wonderful to make!

I always try to do things ahead of time, "just in case.....".  I cook my bacon when I get it, drain & put it in a Zippy bag in the freezer,  30 sec. in the nuker makes it hot & ready to use(perfect for BLT's).  We use water instead of milk(fluffier)  Fantastic & quick.

Thanks for sharing this with everyone. I have been having eggs like this for years and it is the ONLY way I like eggs!!! Cheese HAS to be scrambled in with the eggs or I don't like it. So many people don't get this......even restaurants. I will ask them to just mix in the cheese when they scramble the eggs and 9 times out of 10 it is melted on top. I don't know why that one person said they had a soupy mess.......they must have done something very wrong. Sometimes I use bacon grease instead of butter in the pan and sometimes I use ham, leftover steak or sausage instead of bacon..........just depends what I have.

Very tasty!  I thought a quarter cup of minced onions sounded a bit much so I reduced the amount of onions to a little more than an eighth of a cup.  That still gave the eggs plenty of onion flavor.

It was good but nothing that "blew me away."  The bacon was a little over-powering but that could have just been the kind of bacon I used.  Would definitely add less bacon next time.  
Thanks for a great recipe though.

My toddler is a very picky eater and being pregnant, I have to find a way to get protein in. My son loved it! A nice smokey flavor from the bacon and maybe next time won't use as much onion. Highly recommended.

I switched the bacon with finely diced ham and the milk with sour cream (didn't have bacon or milk on hand), sauteed onion (sweet red) before adding the egg, sour cream and ham mixture to the skillet and wrapped (burrito style) in a warmed corn tortilla for serving. Yum!

An easy brunch recipe.  Make sure you don't overcook the eggs, especially if you'll be keeping on a warmer for a larger group.

This was a good dish, I served it over buttered toast and topped with shredded cheddar.  My fiance thought it would also be good to saute the onions first and then add them to the eggs but either way it was very good!

Delicious! The only alteration that I made was instead of cooking it i butter, I used some of the bacon grease instead. I feel like it made the eggs more liquid-y, however, this was still a very enjoyable breakfast.

This was great! I read the other reviews and omitted the milk and used low fat mayo, it was really good. I also fried the onion first and then added the mixture of egg, bacon, cheese and mayo. It is a fabulous recipe! My husband loves it too!

i'm only giving it a 4 because i altered it. it was still good, but probably would have been better if i had just followed the recipe. i used onion powder and i didn't have bacon. my kids aren't fans of cheesy eggs so i left theirs alone and just cheesed mine. i didn't like the texture of the eggs with the shredded cheese. i will use american singles next time. i loved it, but my kids were suspicious of the onion flavor.

These scrambled eggs were very good, however, they were kind of plain. Red meat is an issue at my house, so I used Turkey in stead. No extra salt was needed, because of the turkey. Onions are also a problem, so instead I used 2tsp. of Onion powder. This was fun to make and I'll definitley make it again.

When you cook eggs and cheese together liked this you end up with eggs my family should throw at you. So, I'm gonna share a restaurateur's secret to perfect cheese eggs. First, adding a liquid to eggs when you scrambled/cook them will help the texture, appearance(known as a popcorn look) and moisture. Any liquid will do. Milk is my favorite but my lactose intolerant grandchild can't have it. So, for her I use plain water. I've used white wine, champagne, vinegar, and coke/rootbeer. It depends on what you're mixing/combining with the eggs. Finally, the secret to perfect cheesy eggs is adding the cheese after the eggs are cooked. I scramble, with a spoon, the eggs until they are approximately 90% cooked and then add the cheese. . Try it both ways, and I'll bet you like the creamy way my eggs turn out the best.

Pretty much an omelette.   Never, ever add milk to scrambled eggs, totally wrong.  Add the cheese last also.

I think two slices bacon is quite a lot of bacon for a mere two eggs. I chopped up about half the amount of bacon called for,  cooked it until nearly done, drained off much of the grease, then added the onion and cooked it just until the bacon was now good and browned and the onion soft.  Add the beaten eggs and, over a low to medium heat,  draw into large curds with a spoon or rubber spatula as it cooks.   Do not overcook and do NOT "stir constantly," unless you want dried up,  over-cooked egg crumbs. For the cheese, add it toward the end of cooking time - it doesn't take long for it to melt - or simply top the eggs with it upon serving.  One star, not for the ingredients, because if prepared properly these would be good scrambled eggs.

Pretty much my old recipe. But now, I skip the milk, break the eggs into the pan and whisk up with a fork while the butter is melting, add chopped chives instead of onion for a more distinct taste. Occasionally, as a final luxury, I add shredded cold-smoked salmon in place of the bacon/ham (not too much as it really dominates). I also keep some of the cheese and chives back to sprinkle on the dish before serving. Hangover? What hangover?

I make the breakfast in my house every Sunday Morning.  I would never cook bacon and not use the drippings for cooking onion and eggs.
One serving; 6" Cast Iron Skillet, Mince Bacon (or sausage) and Onion, put in cold skillet, heat pan (Med) cook until onions done bacon crisp 5-7 min, add whipped eggs and whatever else going into scramble, stir and cook until eggs are starting to set.  Remove from heat, sprinkle with cheese and cover for 2-3 minutes.  Use the butter on your toast.

I do this all the time with my scrambled eggs.  Plain scrambled eggs are just boring.  I usually add a bit of chopped garlic and green pepper, too, if I have it on hand.  Instead of bacon, I just chop a thin slice of lean deli ham into small pieces and add it.  Feel free to add a few spices, too, like a dash of cayenne pepper.  This is great for people who are trying to avoid carbs.

Pretty good dish-- i went with someone else's suggestion and cooked it omelette style- i used egg whites with 1% milk and poured it over turkey bacon bits, minced garlic and sauteed onions. i should have started sauteeing the turkey bacon first as it takes longer to crisp up oh well- i need a non stick pan too!! otherwise it turned out tasty thanks

This was ok, but for our personal taste there was way too much onion and the onion was really crunchy since they weren't sauteed first. I like the idea of adding onion for some different flavor, but if I made this again I would definitely sautee them before adding the rest of the ingredients to the pan. I also agree that the cheese flavor melds in and gets lost, and would suggest either adding it all closer to the end or reserving half to sprinkle on top to melt when the eggs are done cooking. We used half real eggs and half egg-stirs to make it a little healthier. For me this was just 'ok' because of how much the onion just overpowered everything else, and I even added less than called for.

Yum! I am lazy, so I used pre-cooked bacon and chopped it, then sauteed it with the onions for a few minutes. Drained all of it on a paper towel while I cooked the eggs just until they started to bubble, then added back in. Waited until eggs were almost fully cooked before adding cheese. Definitely found my new way to make scrambled eggs!

This is a very good basic recipe. However, it could use some sprucing up. I used diced garlic instead of onion (my family is crazy for garlic. No vampires here!) and I only had turkey Polish sausage on hand (diced). For a little bite I diced up some Thai hot pepper. Added some bell pepper and place all the garlic,Thai hot, sausage, and bell pepper into an olive oil sprayed fry pan. I sautéed them for about 2 min. Then I added the egg/milk mix. Put everything into a whole wheat tortilla and presto. Breakfast fit for a king!

I recommend holding off on the grated cheese until it's almost cooked in the skillet.  When you add grated cheese to a beaten egg mixture, then try to "scramble" it, the cheese melts while cooking and prevents the eggs from "scrambling" nicely.  I added chunks of  compari tomatoes (Costco has these) and liked this combination.  Also, the picture for this recipe is somewhat misleading.  The picture looks like a layered "egg lasagne."  The cooking process used in this recipe won't give you a layered "egg lasagne."

We liked the recipe alot. I put my own twist on it though. I added some old bay seaseoning, and I used some salt and black pepper as well. I also used bacon bits and frozen onions (which I sauteed in butter first). It was pretty good! I will make it again!

My husband has been making a version of this for the past 25+ years.  Here we call them "really bad eggs."
They are really good taste-wise.  They were and are a part of my weight challenge (hence the bad part!!)  We have had these for breakfast, late brunch, lunch and dinner (not on the same day) but this is our "go to" meal when we can't decide what we want to eat.  We usually use american cheese, onions and bacon (or ham, or sausage) but no milk.  The trick he has taught me is definitely don't overcook them as they get rubbery.  Take them out while they are still creamy.

My brother “invented” this recipe years ago.  We thought he was a gourmet cook.  Thanks for bringing back some good memories.  

This is quick and easy and can be adapted to individual tastes.

Very good.  I use ham or bacon.  When I want a creamier dish I use 2 tsp sour cream , light  50% lower fat and it is delish. I love gruyere cheese, but it is expensive.

I like how people completely change recipes around here and then rate the original recipe based on their own changes. At any rate it's just eggs with cheese etc... Nothing new. Nothing great. This is nothing more than a mixed-up omelet. If you use some nasty cheap kind of cheese like someone else did yes, it will be oily and gross.

I make these all the time.  I throw in a handful of fresh spinach and use scallions and diced tomato in mine.  I don't see how one can come up with a soupy mess when all that is necessary is to continue cooking the eggs until they are set.  Some people think it foolish to have a recipe for scrambled eggs, but it is clear some people can't make them even with a recipe.

I have been making eggs like these for over forty years.
The only thing I do different consistently is more milk and beat the  out of the eggs with either a fork or a whisk
When camping these were Sunday morning breakfast, made with anything left over from the weekend mixed in.
I called them my Garbage Omelet..

One flaw in the recipe, states you should stir constantly. This is wrong,  you will have a soupy watery mess, don't over stir. Also onions should be cooked first.

I have been making my version of this for many years and have never been dissatisfied with the way it turns out. However, I do use 2 more tablespoons of milk because it makes the eggs fluffier. I also stir only with a wooden spoon and remove from heat, cover and let the eggs finish off to keep the beautiful color and moisture in.

I sauteed some small diced peppers with the onions in butter, scrambled the eggs with just a little tad of milk, whipped them up nice and fluffy and poured them over the onions and pepper, added my crumbled cooked bacon, just a sprinkle of Mrs. Dash (Garlic and Herb) and when they were just about set I added the cheese...Yummy

We makes eggs at our house 3-4 times a week. No, I am not afraid of the cholesterol-eggs are loaded with nutrients!  So I fry up my bacon first-now it's not just any bacon,  this bacon is from one of the best meat lockers around! Then pour off most of the grease and sauté your onion on medium low heat in the bacon grease. To this you can add bell peppers, jalapeños, spinach, or mushrooms, and definitely some garlic. Pour in your eggs that have been seasoned with salt and pepper-no milk, and definitely more than 2 eggs! Stir your eggs around till mostly set and throw your cheese on top. Turn heat way down and cover for about a minute till your cheese is melted. Serve immediately with whole wheat toast, fruit, coffee and that bacon on the side!

This recipe is pretty basic and like most, I add my own taste. Try mincing fresh soft petal Rosemary to this.  It exudes a most delicious flavor.

Try pancetta instead of bacon, use chives instead of onion, white cheddar seems less oily than yellow or cubed provolone. I also often add diced roasted red peppers (from a jar-dry off before using) and/or sauteed fresh. chopped mushrooms. Yummy.

That touch of milk can be non-dairy milk (nut or coconut) also if you want that dash of milk.  I usually just add some water just before beating the eggs to get them fluffy. Basically I made like Nicole did as an omelet , sautéed the onions with the bacon grease putting the cheese on just as I turn off the stove heat.

Will make again, and often. I tripled the recipe, subbed Monterey Jack for Cheddar cheese, and sprinkled Greek seasoning in lieu of salt and pepper. BF and I cleaned house on this. Every time I cook, I brainstorm on future improvements to the dish, but this the first time I've tried something on AllRecipes that was a perfect 10 from the start!

I have been making this for years with different combinations.  I call it a scrambled omlet.  I always sauté the onions first then add the eggs to them.  I mix the cheese in when the eggs are almost done.  Yum!

I've been making it this way for years but recently have started adding about a tablespoon of finely chopped spinach to the mixture before cooking. Not only does it add a bit of healthy green but it also looks colorful and appealing.

I make this a-lot in our home. My fiance and daughter do not like scrambled eggs, but they love omelets. I on the other hand love scrambled eggs. So after years of making different eggs for all of us, I started making this wonderful recipe that give me the fluffiness of scrambled eggs and gives them the variety of the omelet. This is a definite winner and is a wonderful combo to serve my family picky eating ways. Thanks :-)

Good recipe. Added fried mushrooms instead of onions and a bit of mozzarella cheese on top to finish.

Great all the way except the onions. The eggs take on too much of a onion flavor.

Very good, but I didn't use onions, because of other's reviews saying it was too overpowering. I also used less cheese, which didnt do much because I still could smell the cheese. The bacon was not crispy, but not soggy like I expected. Good, very good.

Yup this is how I make my eggs. A little milk, season with salt and black pepper, sometimes I might put a little curry in it. Some cheese and you can chop up some vegatables in it like onions and bell peppers and you're good to go. The best eggs ever. 

I never had eggs that beat this recipe.

The title of the recipe rang true for me.  They were Number 1!  You'd think that scrambled eggs are scrambled eggs no matter how they are cooked but this recipe makes them super yummy.

Very good weekend breakfast. I sauteed the onion in a little of the bacon drippings then added the eggs to the pan.  I waited until the eggs were firming up to add the cheese and bacon.  The idea of adding them to the uncooked eggs was just gross to me.  The kids wouldn't eat it because of all the onion but my husband and I enjoyed it with plenty of hot sauce.

This was a very good recipe. I cooked the egg mixture in a seperate pan because I did not want to use bacon grease. I also added a bit of chili powder to give it some heat.

I hate eggs but I made this for my boyfriend and he went crazy over them.  It's really easy to cook so I'll definitely make them again sometime.

Super easy to make and tasty.  For one serving, I microwaved 2 slices bacon for 2 min. One less pan to clean that way.  My onions were cut kinda big so I think next time I will make them smaller as to not overwhelm the flavor.  Will definitely add this to my file.  Thanks
