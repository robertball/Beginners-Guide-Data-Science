I found this recipe by doing an ingredient search to use up some odds and ends ingredients.  It was so easy to throw together and was pretty tasty, especially with some good salsa on the side.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Old El Paso!

Great beginner recipe. Very easy to follow and comes out awesome. I added some rice and red beans (pre-made mixture) and some creole seasoning.

Great basic recipe but needs a little zip. I added perhaps 1/4 tsp chili powder to the beans. Folding the tortillas over and cooking two at a time is a great time saver.

Excellent flavor combination but I would also add roasted Anaheim peppers for a little kick.
