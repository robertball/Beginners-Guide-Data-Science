Excellent! I added 1 clove of garlic and a few tsp. of lime juice. I used Hellman't light mayo and it was oh so good! This recipe is a definite keeper!

This is, no doubt, the best condiment.  I make it with fat free mayo and I credit it with helping me lose over 20 pounds this year!  I put it on everything, you don't need a lot of it since its so spicy, and with the ff mayo it is has virtually no calories!

Gotta love how people review a recipe, call it excellent, and give it only 3 or 4 stars. Does it have to cook itself to qualify for 5 stars?? Also, most of the people that give less that 5 stars vary the ingredients greatly. What's up with that?

Wow, what a good idea! I will continue making this to put on anything I can think of! Yes, it's got some heat (which I loved!) so beware. I did add the lime juice and garlic per other reviewers' suggestions, but I'm not sure I think it was necessary. Ended up adding a pinch of sugar too. Served it on Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers from this site and had the most amazing southwestern-flavored meal! I wish I could give this more stars it's so good! I'll figure out a way to make this the next time I have company (maybe mixed with sour cream instead of mayo as one layer of a 7-layer dip??).

Excellent dressing!  This was delicious on jazzed up BLT's made with pepper bacon, avocado, and swiss.  I used the leftovers the next night for dipping Old Bay Steamed Spiced Shrimp.  Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe, and I use it all the time, on all kinds of things. As a spread on my sandwich, on chicken and steaks, pork chops... yum yum. bet it would even taste good as a dip.

Very easy and tastes great. I doubled it but didn't add the extra tablespoons of chipotle, as it was spicy enough. Thanks for the great condiment.

I love this recipe as is & I also love to make more of a sauce using this recipe as a base.  I serve the original recipe on sandwiches, but I do usually add fresh garlic to it.  When I turn this recipe into a dipping sauce, I add ranch dressing, double the chilies, & add lots of fresh garlic.  Its just heavenly when paired with Connie's Zucchini 'Crab' Cakes from this site!

We loved this. Mine was too hot (I picked out 2 big peppers) so I had to add more mayo. I also added some lime to tone it down. We had it with oven fried potatoes tonight, really good stuff. Thanks for the recipe!

I usually add dill pickle relish, drained capers, and a bit of lime juice.  Excellent on turkey burgers!

Very nice.   Added fresh garlic, lime juice and cilantro.  Can't imagine a lot of sandwiches that wouldn't taste good with this on them.

The chipotle was completely overpowering for me, in terms of spice and just a dominating flavor. I kept adding more and more mayo to the mix, hoping to dilute the chipotle to a tolerable level, until I used the entire jar. I put the resulting mix on one sandwich before throwing the whole thing out.

Fantastic. I am trying to lose wight so I bought a container of light mayonnaise instead. Still tastes great! I've already been through two whole jars of this stuff. Although each time I make it, I add more chipotle than the recipe calls for and my mouth ends up regretting it. I guess it could be a good thing since now I use much less mayo per sandwich which saves me calories! This completely transforms a BLT to a whole other level!

An excellent start! Like others, I added lime juice, cilantro, garlic and instead of mayo, I used Greek yogurt. Next time I'll add some sea salt as well. DELISH!!!

Fabulous! Like all the other reviewers, I added garlic and lime.  I also added an extra pepper and some extra adobe sauce because I like it super extra hot.  But this recipe is super flexible, super basic, and super delicious!

We LOVE this stuff!  You can make it as spicy or at little spice as you'd like.  Adds a nice smoky flavor for sandwiches, burgers, sweet potato fries and etc.

This is really good. It's also very hot! I added garlic and lime juice as others suggested and also put in a whole cup of mayo and it's still very hot. It's good and hope to use it on my new diet as it is low in calories when using light mayo.

Perfection!  I used fat free mayo and a little more peppers than listed. Great on sandwiches, french fries and even brushed over chicken breasts like a white BBQ sauce.

made this to go with some crab cakes.  I loved it.  hubie said it was good but was lacking "something"  I think it was the squeeze of lemon juice I put on my that he did not put on his.  making some veggie burgers later this week and excited to try this on those as well.

Ay muy caliente! Just added a squirt of lime and dashes of salt. We had it with our turkey burgers and also topped it with "Christopholofigus's Infamous Jalapeno Relish" (w/out tequila & dill)...hmm I wonder if I can mix those 2 and call it chipotle mayo relish.

Until you've tasted the Chipotle Mayo you don't know what you're missing.  Taste it and enjoy it and ask for more!

Just made a double batch for our burgers tonight and it's amazing!  I already had to make myself a half a sandwich and some baby carrots to enjoy it with.  I had something similar to this, with more of a ranch flavor, served with mozzerella sticks at a pub and it was awesome.  I think I'll try to add some ranch and cream cheese and make a dipping sauce next time!

Excellent with lime juice and a clove of garlic as others have recommended.  Served it with sweet potato fries and it was great. We've been using the left overs on sandwiches too. Very versatile and perfectly spicy :)

Excellent- I was trying to duplicate something I had on a slider at Red Robin. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is that I did add some garlic powder and lime juice, as others have suggested. It turned out very good. I served it with sliced filet mignon, provolone and crispy fried onions on a roll. I can't wait to try it on a turkey sandwich!

I thought it was great.  We used it as a dip for our french fries!  I followed other peoples suggestions of using lime juice.  I used the juice of one fresh lime.  I also added a clove of garlic!  Yum, yum.

This is a good base, but it really does need two cloves of garlic, about a tablespoon of lemon or lime juice, and a tablespoon of tomato paste. I know that sounds weird, but it's in a chipotle mayo that I bought somewhere and it works.  Also, 3-4 drops of liquid smoke.  Then, use the mayonaisse to make deviled eggs and everyone will love you!

Amazing!  Since I always need to tweak recipes, I followed others suggestions and added garlic and cilantro.  I think I added too much adobo sauce because it was a bit runny, so I had to skip the suggested lime juice.  Next time, I will add the lime juice and then add adobo sauce until it reaches my desired thickness.  

I can't wait to try this on MANY items!

This recipe is simple, but great!  I actually bought a can of "chipotle salsa" where the peppers are already blended with the adobe instead of whole.  I mixed a few tablespoons with my mayo and it was amazing.   Thanks!

Awesome mayo. Much cheaper to make it than to buy it pre-prepared. Be ready to dilute with additional mayo, unless of course you like it really hot.  This recipe is so incredibly easy and fast.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and was very please with the results.  The second time, I used light mayo, and added garlic powder.  It was wonderful.  Big flavor and easier on the calories than regular mayo.  This is a keeper......

Delicious and my new favorite condiment!  I love the reviews on this site; they have the best tips for tweaking a recipe to perfection.  I added three cloves of minced garlic and a generous squeeze of fresh lime juice. I just slathered it all over a spicy grilled chicken sandwich, using the "Spicy Chicken Breasts" recipe from this site.

Very good! I used only 1 chipotle and it was way spicy enough for us. I also added a clove of garlic. We really loved the flavor of this mayo and I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

WOW!!!!!!!!!!! I took this to a cookout last night and they put it on everything: raw veggies, chicken, hamburgers, corn chips. I did take the advice of others and add lime juice and garlic. I did add an additional 1/4 C of mayo and 1/4 C plain yogurt and this was enough heat for us!!

The flavor of this was excellent, but it was more spicy than I was thinking it would be, so my wife had a hard time eating it.  Next time I'll make half as written and half without the extra adobe sauce to tone down the spice some for her.  The garlic and the lime juice were great additions.

I love chipotle mayo but I don't have a very high tolerance for spicy foods. I put in half a chile and realized that it was too spicy for me so I added a little extra mayo. I would say start small with the chilies and add more if you think it needs more. Other than that tastes great!

I have used chipotle mayo for a while on crab cakes along with panko bread crumbs.  Just made black bean burgers with the chipotle mayo and it is excellent along with avacado and cheddar cheese n turkey bacon on the black bean burger.  Chipotle is a bit spicy, but excellent just the same...  Its used often in my home...

This stuff turned out great. I use it on burgers, hot dogs, it's even good on chips. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper and about a tsp of liquid smoke flavoring. It's really smooth and creamy with a mild spicy Smokey flavor. Ill be making more for sure.

Terrific recipe. Like others, I add a bit of lime juice and cilantro but it would be great without them if you prefer.

Added fresh lime juice, a dash of salt, and some garlic powder. Love this! It's got a lingering heat, so it doesn't make it impossible to eat whatever you put it on. Great flavor, great consistency, and makes just enough for wraps and sandwiches

Since my DH can't eat things that are too spicy, I added 1/4 cup sour cream, which help cut the spice & helped thicken it a bit, and added 2 TBSP lime juice.  Very yummy.  I used this on sliders.  Next time I'll drizzle it on tacos.

As written, 4 stars.  I've used a version of this recipe (which came from an old Betty Crocker Southwestern cookbook) for years.  It consists of half mayo, half sour cream or Greek Yogurt, chipotle to taste and a pinch of Mexican oregano.  I generally add a splash of lime juice as well.  A chipotle tip:  every recipe that includes chipotle calls for having it minced.  Whenever I buy a can of chipotles, I put it in my mini chopper or blender and puree it.  Then pour in into a shallow storage container.  When almost frozen solid, take a knife and score the block into 8 or 10 squares.  That way, it's easy to take out as much as you need. :)

Delicious!! Made some of this to put on our burgers. We also followed the suggestions of others to add a bit of garlic and lime juice. Had to add a small amount of sugar to balance it out.

Like other reviewers, I added a clove of garlic.  I also added few extra chili peppers for an extra kick.  Great on turkey or roast beef sandwich....

Used a small 15oz jar of mayo and 1 whole 7oz can of Goya's chipotles in adobo (approximately 7-8 chilies) and added 5 cloves of garlic. Think this basically just doubled the recipe, but with an extra kick. Came out super delicious. Poured it back into the jar and will use on lots of stuff (bunless burgers, grilled chicken, shrimp etc). I did try it mixed in with canned tuna, and that just wasn't a good combo. I'm trying to do Atkins again, and with the full fat mayo, this this will be a good recipe to have.

I just made this, adding some garlic, citrus juice and cilantro per others' reviews. I used olive oil mayo because it's a little lighter. I keep a container of blended chipotle in adobo in the fridge, since every recipe seems to call for some chopped and some sauce from the can, so I can just use the equivalent amount of the purée instead of having to chop the peppers every time I need a little. My husband's not super keen on really hot foods, so I probably used about a teaspoon of the adobo for just a hint of the smoky spice. It's very good now, but I think it will be even better after chilling.

I used 1 cup of Hellmann's Light Mayonnaise to reduce the spiciness. If I made this again, I'd use 1 pepper and less adobo sauce for each 1/2 cup of mayonnaise.

Very good.  I used both peppers but scraped the seeds out so it wouldn't be too spicy.  Didn't have a food processor, so used my blender.

Use about half of this recipe and add 3 cups of shredded mild or sharp cheddar cheese and you have a Chipotle Cheese Spread that beats Pimiento Cheese hands down!

My teenager is obsessed with chipotle mayo.  This was so easy!  Added a little lime juice.  Extra chillies are in freezer for next time.

After reading the other reviews, I cut back to only one pepper.  The second time I made it, I also added some dill relish to the mixture.  Either way is good.  I love the way this recipe spices up a sandwich!

It was good, but very spicy. My boyfriend wasn't really a fan but I thought it had good flavor.

I used this recipe when attempting my rendition to Quizno's sonoma turkey sammie.  I have to say that it fit the bill pretty nicely!  I didn't add anything other then what was listed in the ingredients, but I did use reduced fat mayo.  Yum!  I can't wait to try this on other food items!

This is what I do when I have extra chipotle peppers from the can.  I always reach for this mayo first!  Very good basic recipe... you can tweak it to your liking.

2 medium chipotles from the can makes it plenty spicy!  I may do a little more mayo, or a little less chipotle next time.  Such a nice kick!  I used this on the chipotle turkey burgers.  Yum.  I bet this would be a nice dipping sauce for sweet potato fries.

I only gave 4 stars because I felt it needed a little more something so I added garlic and it was great.

I, too, have made this for years.  I often add a little orange zest and a few tablespoons of fresh orange juice to it.  The sweetness goes well with the heat.

I made this the other night with yam fries. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I found it needed a little bit extra - I followed the recommendation of others and added 2 cloves of garlic and a teaspoon of lime juice. It was quite flavourful. I made extra so now I have sandwich spread on hand in the fridge in the small mayonnaise jar that I used for the recipe.

Whoa this was spicy! My boyfriend loved the heat, but it was too much for his daughter and myself. For a way less spicy version I recommend using 1/2 a chipotle pepper and 1 tbs of the abodo sauce. Still very yummy on the fish tacos we made!

This was awesome.  A fun twist on a sandwich - better than regular mayo.  Spread it thin if you don't like it too hot!

Hot, hot, hot! Next time I well only add one pepper. I added more mayo to tone it down some.  Can't wait to try it on burgers or wraps.

Very good.  I took BN61079's advice and added garlic and lime juice.  It was delicious on a sandwich with some sliced avocado!
