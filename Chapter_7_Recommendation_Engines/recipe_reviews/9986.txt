My family begs for these cookies!  I combined all of the wonderful advice of the cooks before me: use 1/2 butter and 1/2 Crisco for softness, use 1/2 dark and 1/2 light brown sugar for the best flavor, use less cocoa powder to keep more of a peanut butter flavor, and bake them for 6-8 minutes so they don't dry out. And the best advice of all was to use mini peanut butter cups, cut them in half, and freeze them before you put them in the cookie to bake.  This helps to maintain part of the candy shape and when you get to that center bite--well, you will see!!!  Thank you all for making me a cookie-making legend in my family!

I used the recommendations of halfbutter/half butter Crisco; WAY underbake. I use 38 - 40 mini Reese's peanut butter cups that I freeze, cut in half and then pop back into the freezer while preparing batter.  I cut them big because they look fabulous with that big gash of peanut butter.  Be careful when folding in the frozen cups and I try to keep those frozen pieces as large as possible - THAT is what makes these cookies so darn attractive and yummy.  I drop them out of a tablespoon - large - lumpy - I get 55 cookies to a batch.  Use parchment paper - keep them on the  sheet for 10 minutes or longer then off to the drying racks. (Again, they will kind of look raw, but keeping them on the pan, outside of the oven, for another 10 minutes or so continues the baking.)  These are KILLER; figuratively and, let's be honest, a bit literally!!!

LATE ADDITION:  I NOW add the Trader Joe's teeny, tiny mini peanut butter cups to the recipe and use chocolate CHUNKS, instead of reg. chips. So, instead of the one cup chocolate chips and one cup peanut butter chips, I use a total of two cups chips, but split three ways with chocolate chunks, peanut butter and Trader Joe's chips.  ALSO, to make them look like they came out of the best bakery in the universe,  I gently position a couple of choclate chunks and Trader Joe's mini PB cups on top of the cookies before baking.  Makes them look gorgeous.  Have renamed them..."Better Than Sex"!

I made these for my Dad who LOVES PBC's --they came out REALLY too sweet and rich.  I think they would be better with less sugar and not so many chips.  I'm an avid cookie baker so I'm really picky --check my reviews for my favorites!

These cookies are delicious, but it can be a bit tricky to figure out when they are done.  Once you figure out how long they will take in your oven, they will not disappoint you!  I usually bake until small cracks appear in the surface.  They also freeze well.

These cookies really are fantastic!  I'm known for my culinary skills, so I'm always cautious when trying other recipes.  This one helped me keep that reputation!  One comment was, "They taste like the cookies you pay a few dollars (each) for in the mall!"  They do have a "mild" peanut butter taste so it's great when you bite into one of the peanut butter cup pieces.  I did adapt it a little by omitting the cocoa and I used MILK chocolate CHUNKS instead of semi-sweet chocolate CHIPS.  Thanks!  :o)

I must say that these cookies are SOOOOOO delicious!!!!!! I couldn't even imagine that a cookie could taste this good. I'm suprised Mrs. Fields hasn't been groveling to buy this recipe. I just wanna suggest 2 things. If you take the requested amount of brown sugar and use half of both light and dark brown sugar, they are even better! also, if you freeze the penut butter cups before you cut them, they stay whole rather then melting in the oven. A little harder to cut, but worth every second!!!!!

These are very good if you like rich cookies. I made the mistake of using a health nut peanut butter (which I never really liked) which only had peanuts and oil listed as ingredients. So I suggest you use a good quality, sweet peanut butter like Jif or Skippy. And also, when you take the cookies out of the oven, you may not think that they are done, but they really are! Do not cook them for longer than it says to because they will harden up later, trust me!

Without a doubt, these are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever produced, hands down!  Like some other reviewers mentioned, you can't really taste the peanut butter cups, but the cookie is still fantastic.  A suggestion if you still want to add the peanut butter cups-cut them and THEN freeze them while preparing the batter so that they retain some of their shape.  These cookies were moist and delicious, even a few days later, although there weren't many left!  They got rave reviews from everyone at work, too!

I thought these tasted very good, however there was too much chocolate compared to the peanut butter. Next time I will try it without the added cocoa. I was hoping for chunks of reese's pieces but only ended up with little dots. I guess these were just not the cookies I was expecting. Also I noticed that the cookies might not look done when you take them out but they are, so be careful not to over bake them.

Not the greatest cookie in the world like I was expecting based on the reviews!  Mine turned out looking nothing like the main pic.  Did not flatten at all as they baked.  If I was to make these again (not sure I would though), I'd flatten then on the cookie sheet before baking.  They were good, just not these life changing cookies I was expecting based on the comments.

Mmmmmmm!!!  I left out the cocoa powder, added a pinch of salt and chocolate peanut butter chips......fantastic!  So thankful the kids didn't eat them all because I couldn't wait to have one.

These were delicious. I froze the quartered pb cups so they would hold their shape better, omitted the cocoa powder from the cookie. Make sure you don't overcook them. Nine minutes is plenty

I omitted the cocoa because I wanted more of a PB flavor.  I only had PB cups in stock, so that's all I used.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour to make them a bit healthier and the flavor was addictive!  Note:  these are very sweet, so plan to give some away (that's what I had to do to stop eating them!)

When they show a picture of the recipe it should be THE EXACT RECIPE not an altered recipe. I should have not added the cocoa powder but it was too late. So i made it following the recipe bit i thought it would be too much chocolate chips with the cocoa. So i only did half cup chocolate chips and half cup peanut butter and 1 cup of p. b. cups. They are good but not what i wanted.

I made these following the recipe exactly.  These cookies have a shortbread-like texture, not chewy or crispy.  I made large ones (2 tablespoons of dough) and small ones (1 tablespoon of dough) and the small ones are better, because they are very sweet.  These cookies don't spread much on the cookie sheet, so I flattened them out before cooking.  I used dark brown sugar.  Next time I will use half the amount of both chips, and freeze the PB cups before I cut them up, they kind of melted into the cookies.  Mine look nothing like the photo - mine are chocolate colored, the reese's pieces aren't as obvious as in the photo, and they didn't spread like it seems the cookie in the photo did.  They are very peanut buttery, which is good!  A bit too sweet for me, but I think cutting the chips in half would help.  This recipe also made a LOT of cookies.  I got 2 dozen of the big ones, and 4 dozen of the small ones.  Lots to give away!

Wow...that was a really good way to use up that month-old leftover Halloween candy! I used organic crunchy peanut butter in my version, and I thought it was a perfect balance of PB and chocolate taste. And I didn't even have the peanut butter chips! These are very rich cookies, so I would stick to leaving out half of the chips.

Talk about cookie overload. Wow, one cookie filled me up! I did omit the cocoa (don't like) and had to adjust for high elevation (I live at 8200 ft). Freezing the peanut butter cups before and after cutting helps keep the shape when being baked. If you want a rich peanut butter/chocolate chip cookie this is it!

these cookies are good but I'm a huge peanut butter fan and the chocolate overpowered it so I think with a few changes it will be a 5 star.

Although I used all white sugar and didn't use peanut butter chips, these cookies still turned out AMAZING. They are seriously the best cookies I've ever tasted. The chunks of peanut butter cups are heavenly and each bite is a chocolate fantasy. SO GOOD!

As is - only 3 stars.  I am a picky cookie eater.  Love chocolate and peanut butter, but this cookie was too chocolatey.  I think I will try omitting the cocoa next time.

If you are a peanut butter lover, these cookies are for you! My husband absolutely loves peanut butter, but for some reason has always hated peanut butter cookies ... until I made these! They are a hit every time and have made me a cookie legend at work. I have tried both the given recipe and some of the modifications. I now use the combo of half light/half dark brown sugar for best flavor. I find the cookies to be plenty soft so I don't see a need for substituting half crisco for the butter. I also have found there to be plenty of peanut butter flavor without adjusting the cocoa powder. They can end up with borderline too much peanut butter taste if you skimp on the cocoa powder. Freezing the peanut butter cups is a must, and I prefer to use the full size as the original recipe calls for. Using the smaller cups adds more chocolate to the mix and changes the flavor combination. As another reviewer said I also think these would be best with less chips, but haven't tried it that way yet. There are so many chips that it can make the dough difficult to hold together when trying to form the lumps of dough for the cookies. Plus, it's hard to get a real bite of the good cookie flavor when all you taste are chips.

This recipe is a KEEPER! I did not change anything in the recipe. I have a family of picky cookie eaters - and they loved 'em. Only one warning - my cookies did not look like the photo - mine where chocolate colored.

These are very good cookies! I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco, I also omitted the cocoa powder.  Next time I make these, I will also use only half of the chocolate and peanut chips, way too sweet for my taste.  I baked these in my oven for 9-10 minutes and they were perfect. This recipe is a keeper!

These cookies are the best cookies I've ever made/eaten in my life!!!! like others suggested I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening, the cookies came out very moist and a little crispy around the edges. I also froze the peanut butter cups before cutting them and adding them to the batter, once the cookies were baked the peanut butter cup pieces were still intact and looked delicious. I couldnt find any peanut butter chips, so I just used chocolate chunks/chips, I found it balanced out well with the other peanut butter flavors. I brought these to my nephews birthday party, and he ate so many he barely touched his ice cream cake. These are great and I'll be making them again soon!

These are the best cookies! I have had this recipe for several years and my family gushes over how good they are every time I make them. They are our favorite cookies! i never have peanut butter chips in the house so I just add more chocolate chips. I also have never added cocoa powder. They are perfect with out it.    One other thing that I do is whip the butter, peanut butter, and sugars for 3 minutes. It says to do that on my recipe and I think that it gives these cookies an amazing texture. It is part of the amazingness of these cookies. I would definitely recommend everyone do that!   As for the baking time, which everyone seems to be changing, I find that the time stated works perfectly if you use a #40 scoop, which I believe is 2 T. This makes a 3-4 inch cookie.

This cookie is a must for chocolate and peanut butter lovers!  I used insulated (Air-bake) cookie sheets, baked them for 11 minutes and let them cool about five minutes on the sheet.  They slid off the sheet easily and were moist for days.  I will definitely make them again!

Warm out of the oven, they tasted delicious!  (I was eating them with a fork!)  8 minutes was perfect for rounded tablespoon scoops to cook.  They don't spread much so it's okay to put them closer together than other cookies.
Used a more peanut butter and less cocoa powder than the recipe and it tastes like a great peanut butter cookie.  Next time I'll follow the recipe amounts to see if I like it with more chocolate.
Thanks for all the previous reviewers' tips -- followed them with great success.  Only other tip to add is to use a GOOD NATURAL peanut butter like Laura Scudder's natural or Trader Joe's or Knott's Berry Farm.  This will give you the Peanut Butter taste in the cookie.
Hubby's co-workers loved it the next day.

very very good!!!!!! I used half butter flavored crisco and half butter as suggested. I cut miniature reese cups in half and froze them before using. I started out just sticking the half pb cup in the middle of each dough ball but some of the cookies did not look pretty the dough fell away from the candy. So, the last ones I made I just rolled the dough around the cup for a surprise center!! Also I doubled the recipe and used 1 bag of milk chocolate chips and 1 bag of pb chips for the double recipe. very easy and wonderful rich taste!!!!!!!

WOW WOW WOW!  These cookies are fabulous!  I was looking for a cookie to bring to a get-together I was going to yesterday...found this recipe, made it, and YUMMY!  They are so good, almost like candy.  I did read the reviews on this cookie, and I did 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, to make sure that they were very moist and soft.  It definately paid off!!! I also only put 1/4 c. cocoa. Everyone, and I really mean Everyone there thought these cookies were fantastic.  They all had more than one.  One more thing, they are very very rich...make sure you have some milk!  Thanks!

There are just better, MOISTER, choco/peanut butter cookies out there.  These turned out on the dry side even with subbing half shortening.  I don't see that it is a baking time issue, as had I pulled mine out of the oven any sooner, they would have been raw.  Plus, it's obvious at the dough stage that this is dry cookie.

These were good. I didn't add the peanut butter cups into the batter. I put the cookies on the cookie sheet, then put the chunks of pb cups on top of the cookies. That way they don't fall apart.

These are fantastic!  My results were big, thick, soft cookies, with the perfect blend of chocolate and peanut butter. My husband, who's not a fan of the peanut butter chips, thought they were going to have too much peanut butter flavor, but he loved them, as did my kids AND the neighbor kids. 

I didn't change a thing, except I used whole wheat pastry flour in place of the all-purpose flour.  As others commented, the dough is very thick, so you have to be patient when mixing as it takes a while to blend until it's workable.  I added the flour very gradually, about 1/2 cup at a time or less, and then stirred it in thoroughly before adding more.  I even worked the dough by hand at the end to make sure the consistency was moist enough. I also froze the peanut butter cups before chopping as another review suggested, which worked great. 

Joanna, thank you so much for the recipe - this one's going in the 'family favorites' file!

These were good but from all the rave reviews I was expecting more. When I cooked them on a baking sheet they were totally black on the bottom but they turned out fine on stone bakeware. If you don't have stoneware I would use parchment paper on the baking sheet to prevent burning.

These are a huge hit each time I make them--I always have to make sure I have copies of the recipe printed to share.  My husband, who really doesn't eat a lot of baked goods, asks me to make these all the time.  I used other reviewers' tips and used the miniature peanut butter cups and also put them in the freezer before baking--great idea! Tip: following the cooking time suggested, cookies won't look completely done when you pull them out, but let them set up a bit and they'll be perfect, chewy cookies.  Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly and they turn out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies were absolutely wonderful!  The texture was perfect.  I didn't have peanut butter cups, so I simply left them out.  I brought these to work with me and everyone loved them.  This recipe is a keeper.

Let me quote my "cookie loving" husband...
These are the best cookies ever!!!
Update: I have been making these cookies for a couple of years now, and have made them many, many times. Never once have they been anything other than perfection!  I even use reduced fat peanut butter and reduced fat butter and margarine (half a cup of each), and it doesn't take away from the quality of the cookie.  I have found that freezing the reeces does help.  And rather than mixing it in with the dough, I form the cookie, and put a couple of pieces of Reeces cups on top of each cookie (kind of stick the pieces into the dough a bit).  This helps it keep its shape rather than not being able to see or taste the PB cups themselves. Lastly, the key to a perfect cookie no matter what the recipe is to use parchment paper on the cookie sheet. No worries about whether to grease or not to grease the pan. :) This is everyone's favorite cookie.  Enjoy!

These turned out great. I didn't realize that I didn't have any cocoa powder until I had this cookie dough almost all done. I used 1/3 c. of flour in it's place. No peanut butter cups, so I used two large Butterfinger candy bars all crushed. Small subs, cookie was still off the hook. MAKES A TON. Ten minutes was perfection for this cookie.

Amazing! I've made these twice so far (and both this week alone!). The only modifications I made were to use half light/half dark brown sugar, and I cut and froze the peanut butter cup pieces. On the second batch, I used the half light/half dark brown sugar again, but instead of mixing the peanut butter cup pieces into the cookie dough, I cut them into fourths, froze them, then poked one piece into the middle of each cookie when they came out of the oven. The first batch had some cookies with more than one peanut butter cup piece and others didn't have any, so this was my solution and it worked great. I baked each batch for 8 minutes and they came out perfect both times. I kept them in a tupperware container and they stayed perfectly soft and moist for the whole week. This recipe has already made it into my favorites book and I'm sure I'll be making them again and again.

These are seriously yummy and rich cookies! I doubled the recipe and found the bag of peanut butter chips was the perfect 2 cups. I used Droste dutch process cocoa and Skippy reduced fat - which worked great.  My only advise is that these take a bit longer to cool than most cookies since the peanut butter is extra melty.  If you will be making these along with other kinds of cookies(for holidays etc), I'd recommend making these last since they tend to leave peanut butter behind on your racks, spatulas and such. But I think these will be a big hit, since they are so yummy!

These cookies were really good, and REALLY addicting. I halved the recipe and made them small, and still ended up eating a ton of them. They don't spread out very much on the cookie sheet, so if you want to bake them faster (because you're in a rush or are impatient like me:)) you can pack them in fairly close.

Ok - I apologize for ever even tweeking with this recipe before even trying it just as directed.  I read reviews and tried others "tips" first and they all RUINED it!  If you follow this recipe to the T it will be perfect!  I made this recipe for a friend as a birthday treat, and after taking a "sample" cookie, I didn't want to part with them!

This is the best chocolate/PB cookie recipe you will find. I loved them and will make them again. They didn't even last a day in my house. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. However, I made mine HUGE and that was a big mistake. Next time I'll make them smaller.

These cookies are incredible. So good that I have been blamed for introducing them at certain gatherings, as said gatherings are now ruined if the cookies aren't there.  I have adjusted the recipe by using Reese's Peanut butter Bites instead of the cups.  These are very good in the cookies.

These cookies were awesome! I omitted the cocoa powder & used a little extra flour, and instead of using the chips, I used 25 peanut butter cups cut into sixths - they came out great! You may need to cook them longer than 8-10 minutes, though. Thanks!

Best cookies EVER!!!
I make cookies all the time, and these are my FAVORITE ones to make! I usually add more chocolate chips and fewer peanut butter chips, because the Reese Cups provide a lot of peanut butter flavor. Or I sometimes don't even add Reese Cups and just put in a bunch more chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. Yummy!!!

YUMMY- i am always wanting to impress my hubby with my baking abilities and i think i totoally did it with this one- i didn't add cocoa as one other reviewer suggested- and these were a huge hit- my hubby is in a band and they came over and devoured these- they named them "the best cookie ever" this was a huge compliment- if you like peanut butter cookies TRY THESE ---- mine made 4 dozen huge cookies- but be carefull i found myself eating theM for breakfast- YUMMY

A hit with everyone!  I used 1/2 light and 1/2 dark brown sugar, but used all butter and thought it was perfect!  The trick is to use baking pans that the cookies won't burn on (like lining them with that special rubber mat or using pans with air pockets to prevent burning).  They turned out nice and moist, but definitely rich.  I woudln't get rid of the cocoa, though; I thought it added a nice touch and wans't too overwhelming.

"Wow!" That's what I said aloud when I took the first bite of one of these cookies. Rich chocolat /peanut butter fusion without being too heavy. I used cut-up Hershey bars instead of peanut butter cups (since folks said they couldn't taste the cups in the cookie). I also used all butter, and while I had to handle cookies gingerly when moving them to the cooling rack, once they had cooled, they were pretty firm.

Delicious!  Loved these.  I followed the recipe exactly and the first sheet I made, they did fall apart a bit even after cool.  For the next sheet, instead of dropping the batter by the tablespoon, I rolled it into a ball and flattened slightly on the cookie sheet and this definitely helped the falling apart situation.  Thank you!

Great for peanut butter cup lovers, which we have in this family.  I followed the recipe, except omitted the peanut butter chips because I didn't have any.  These weren't the best looking cookies, but the taste made up for what they were lacking in appearance.  I made these into quite large cookies and loved biting into that chunk of peanut butter cup.  My kids loved these, shared them with some friends, and pretty much polished off one batch in one weekend.  Great recipe!

Wow are these GOOD!!  These were a big hit with everyone.  The only changes I made were 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c crisco.  Everything else was the same for the ingredients.  I did bake for 9 minutes and cooled on sheets for 10 minutes.  Excellent!!  Will make again.  These are a very rich cookie; have a glass of milk on hand!!

A big thumbs up!!!  Followed the recipe except the store didn't have peanut butter chips so I used a full bag of chocolate/peanut butter swirl chips.  Wow!!  These cookies are so light and moist and flavorful!  I usually hate using cocoa powder because it makes the dough sticky, but I'll keep a container on the shelf just for these!

I used the half crisco, half butter, half light brown sugar, half brown sugar, mexican vanilla, no cocoa powder and baked them just until the cracks formed.  I basically used the advice of several of the most helpful reviews for this recipe.  I froze the mini pb cups too.  This is excellent.  5 stars and beyond.  I believe I may have just found my favoritest cookie ever.

These cookies are excellent!  The only changes I made were to double the vanilla (I do this with every cookie recipe), cut back on the amount of chips and use the baking size Reeces Peanut Butter Cups.  The first time I made these I used the entire chip amount and had "leftover" chips in the bottom of the bowl so I cut back a bit when I made them the second time.  These were a big hit with my kids as well as the entire staff at the school where I teach!  No leftovers!  Almost forgot ~ I used Hershey's dark cocoa, my new fav!

AWESOME cookie! I bought the swirl chips (pb and choc) and instead of chopping up a reeses, pressed a mini-reeses in the middle of each hot cookie! These FLEW off the plates at a Christmas party; everyone talks about this one a week later! :)

This recipe is so, so good! The only changes I made were that I added almost double the cocoa powder and I used mini peanut butter cups. (very coarsly chopped) I love how you can see the flavors bursting out of this cookie! They look amazing! (I took a picture that I will be uploading soon!) Thanks so much for this great recipe!

There is way too much flour in this recipe. I should've known because the dough was so thick I could hardly stir it! However, I will give it another try perhaps with only 1 1/2 - 2 cups of flour.

These cookies were just fabulous!!!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!!  I used all 12 ounces of the choc. chips and all 11 ounces of the peanut butter chips.  I did not want to save such a small amount of chips so I thought what the heck!
They turned out even better with the extra chips!
Put the peanut butter cups in the refrigerator before you chop them to avoid fast melting. ENJOY!

I made several modifications per previous suggestions which ultimately made this a great cookie.  I used half butter flavored shortening and half butter.  I used half light brown sugar and half brown sugar.  I also cut the cocoa in half the first couple of times I made this, but I am going to try the full amount the next time.  Also, cut the peanut butter cups up in advance and stick them in the freezer, this helps keep them looking like peanut butter cups instead of melting out.  I also used dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet the last time and I loved the rich flavor it added.  Be careful not to over cook these cookies.  Because the chips don't necessarily melt out and the cookies don't brown or spread very much they can look like they're not cooked when they really are.  The recipe can make up to twice as many cookies than noted.  Don't do any more than double the recipe or it is just too difficult to handle.

The whole family voted: 4 stars! I left out the peanut butter cup pieces. After eating them, we all pretty much agreed that they would probably be better without the cocoa powder and the peanut butter chips. I will try it that way next time. Yummy though. My husband is taking the rest to work tomorrow.

This cookie recipe is AWESOME.  I'm not really a fan of peanut butter cookies, but these are great.  I bumped up the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup the second time, because I thought they could stand to be a little more chocolatey, and added a chunk of peanut butter cup to the top of each.  

They come out perfectly, and stay chewy. This is a keeper.

I am a major chocoholic and these cookies were absolutely decadent.  I used mini Reese's peanut butter cups, cut into quarters and put in the freezer while I mixed the rest of dough, then added as last ingredient.

These were very good warm and a little cakey when cooled.  I'm going to experiment with ingredients to make it a little less puffy.  Overall very good taste.  I put in a little more peanut butter than it called for because I only had chocolate chips on hand.

tasty. wasn't overly chocolatey though it would seem. you'll definitely need a glass of milk or some sort of refreshing beverage to quench ye thirst since it leaves you a bit dry in the grill piece.

Absolutely delicious, I made them without the cocoa powder, and they are definitely like a peanutbutter cup in cookie form.

If I could give this cookie more than 5 stars I would.  Baking cookies is my favorite type of cooking and I do it every week.  I literally ate the entire recipe myself.  I loved the texture of the cookies and they kept well in the refrigerator for several days.  I used 3/4 of a bag of Reese's miniatures since those were the size I had.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used half shortening and half butter, half light and half dark brown sugar.  I also reduced the cocoa, but IF I were to make these again, I would take out the cocoa altogether. They were way too sweet for me and my family. However, I made them for a peanut butter and chocolate fan, who seemed to like them, though he also said it was a bit rich. Overall, I was a bit disappointed, but maybe it just has to be made for the right audience.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but my first batch turned out really dry.  I had to add some cream and butter to make it actually spread on the cookie sheet when baking.
Overall, I was not impressed with the taste - it was too sweet, and I couldn't taste the peanut butter cups when the cookies were baked.

These cookies are fantastic!  They are one of my absolute favorites!  I have made them several times and always get rave reviews.  I do, however, get 5-6 dozen cookies out of the recipe.  Also, I like to use those Reese's Bites instead of the chopped Reese's (about 1 1/2 cups).  I also use milk chocolate chips sometimes.  Delicious!

Making these cookies was a last minute decision, so I used what I had on hand. They are absolutely delicious! I didn't have peanut butter chips, but I did have mini peanut butter cups. They still had just the right amount of peanut butter taste. I used Ghirardelli miniature semi-sweet chips. Other than leaving out the pb chips, I followed the recipe exactly. They did not take longer than 9 minutes to bake. We will definitely be making these again!

I really liked these but I find them way too sweet.  I did cut down on the amount of chips and PB cups.  As a note to others who like me thought that 2 cups of chips AND ten PB cups was too much, the dough can handle the full amounts.  I find that in the cookies I made the chip/PB cup ratio per cookie is low.  Plus the PB cups totally melted into the cookie and are not discernable (sp?).  If I make again I will press a few whole PB cup pieces into the top mid baking.

OMGosh. So good.  I used the 1/2 butter 1/2 crisco. Also added  1/4 c light brown sugar and 2/4 dark.  Otherwise used whole wheat flour, all the cocoa, and added a bunch of chopped up Easter candy.  Cooked 8 min only. Love them!

These are absolutely fantastic!  I only made the following small notes:  half butter and half shortening to give more shape, left out the cocoa powder since I didn't have any and I didn't want the cookies to turn brown, baked 9 minutes then let sit on cookie sheet for 10 minutes outside the oven.  I thought this recipe looked delicious and it definitely did not disappoint!

Decently good cookies. Having both peanut butter and chocolate chips as well as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups seemed a little unnecessary. Also, not sure how the cookies in the picture aren't chocolate colored since the recipe uses cocoa . . .

These are a very delicious- I highly recommend using stoneware pans if they're 'seasoned' to get the right amount of doneness.  I opted to use Reeses Pieces for a little more fall color, but they were definitely a hit with my Peanut Butter cookie connoisseurs!

These cookies alwaysgo fast when I make them.  I do not add the cocoa poweder and I took the suggestion of freezing mini pb cups instead of cutting whole ones.  They keep their shape so you bite into chunks of pb cup.  Rich but delicious!

These are amazing cookies!  My husband and I loved them.  They do take a bit of experimenting, but at 6500 feet elevation, this is what worked for me... I froze the miniature peanut butter cups before I baked the cookies.  I cut about 23 in quarters and then about 8 in half.  I used half a cup of butter and half a cup of butter flavored Crisco.  I also used half golden brown sugar and half dark brown sugar.  I dropped these by heaping tablespoonfulls and cooked them at 350...I tried both 7 and 8 minutes, and BY FAR, the 7 minute cookies were the best.  They look undone, but let them sit (as others have suggested) on the cookie tray for another 7 minutes or so, and they will be great.  After the first batch, I kept the dough in the fridge so that the peanut butter cups would stay in tact.  Amazing cookies!

This is a wonderful recipe. However, I noticed a few reviews that stated they used half butter half crisco for softness. I don't like crisco so I used all butter and as long as you don't over bake them they will be soft.

these are very good especially for pb lovers. i would recommend to keep a good eye on the oven you really want these to be as moist and chewy of a cookie as possible. (in my opinion thats when they taste best or else you are eating dry dirt)

My husband LOVES peanut butter cups and LOVES chocolate, but he just said these cookies were "interesting..." The flavor was alright, but there were too many chips in them and the consistency was kind of weird. My 5-year-old, however, loved them!

Made these today, though modified it based on others reviews. I kept the cocoa powder. Can't tell if it is the vanilla or that which leaves a funny aftertaste. I used half crisco/half butter. Half dark and half light brown sugar. mini reeses cut in half and frozen. mini kisses (they had no chunks), peanut butter chips, inadvertently bought chunky Jiff, so I used that. Baked 7 minutes on parchment. Then realized I forgot baking soda. But they came out beautiful anyway. After tasting, I was surprised to see that the PB flavor was so mild, like others have said. I realized that there is no salt. Next time I will throw in a tsp of salt or more to bring out the PB flavor. I like my PB salty. Either way, these were a hit. But the first time my children didn't ask for a second cookie! VErY rich.

YUM YUM.  I'm still baking but have already eaten a couple cookies from the first batch.  I used chunky PB since that's what I wanted to use up and I also happened to have a bag of mixed choc and PB chips so that was perfect.  They're delish!

I made them with both reg and smaller pb cups.  I used less cocoa powder, so there was just a hint of the cocoa and omitted the choc. chips.  I formed into balls and then used the fork like you would on PB cookies normally and they didn't flatten out much bigger.  My boyfriend and I love this recipe, possibly the best I've made since I made cookies for Christmas last year.

Very good.  I did use 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening.  I only used about 1/8 c. cocoa powder because I didn't want a dark cookie.  I didn't have buttercups so I omitted those.  Still a very good cookie.  It will satisfy your pb/choc cravings.  Just be sure to have a glass of milk nearby.

My husband wanted peanut butter cookies, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. Wow, these cookies are so delicious -- soft, peanut-buttery, and chocolatey!  I used an entire cup of all-natural peanut butter and chopped up some mini Snickers bars to use in place of chocolate chips since I didn't have any in the pantry.  (I can envision using mini Reese's Pieces or white chocolate chips in this recipe, too).  Instead of doing these as drop cookies, I rolled the dough into balls and pressed them gently with a fork to create the traditional peanut butter cookie appearance.

This is one of the best cookies ever!  I make these all the time and they are gone before you know it.  Be prepared - everyone will ask you for this recipe.  The only thing I do differently from the recipe so that I don't have to buy 2 bags of chips is to buy one bag of the Reese's milk chocolate and peanut butter chips combined.  These are wonderful!!!

Delicious, but I will omit the cocoa powder next time...it didn't add much to the flavor but gave the cookies a powdery taste.  I used mini-Reeces chips.

I couldn't believe how soft they stayed even after a few days.  I made them Thursday night and by Sunday night took them to a family dinner and they were still so chewy!  Used my stoneware pans so it took much longer to bake them.

This was another recipe I made first a couple of years ago and then forgot about...  And I am so glad I remembered.  These were made yesterday as gifts to send out, and I am having to hide them from my cookie monster husband!  Very good, but I agree that the peanut butter flavor is pretty subtle.  Got the mini peanut butter cups (a little larger than chocolate chips) at Trader Joe's and they work very well in this recipe as long as you freeze them before stirring them in.  Great cookie that goes wonderfully with hot cocoa or coffee!

Excellent cookie!  I did double the cocoa powder because we like a deeper chocolate flavor.  Used a full bag (about 35 or so) miniature peanut butter cups chopped, no peanut butter chips, still used the chocolate chips. Used a cookie scoop and baked 10 minutes.  Perfect textured cookie, great salty/sweet combo, we loved them!

These are some of the most amazing cookies EVER. Of all the cookie recipes out there, it's just hard to find one that's worthy of making over and over again - this is one of them! The texture is moist and soft and the choco/peanut butter flavors mix just right. I didn't have pb cups, so i used mini reese's pieces. Like i said, this one's a keeper!

Based on the reviews for this recipe, I expected a spectacular cookie, but these were only okay.  I listened to the other reviewers that suggested cutting down the sugar so I used 1/2 c. each of the brown and white sugars.  However, they were definitely lacking flavor, and the peanut butter was too overpowering.  I suggest using 3/4 cup of the brown sugar along with the 1/2 cup white sugar and maybe a little extra vanilla.  I also used a cookie scoop to drop the cookies but I guess they don't really spread so I  had to flatten the cookies half way through baking.  I used a whole bag of mini peanut butter cups, chopped them up and stuck them in the freezer for about 15 minutes.  The texture of the cookie is nice, and the batter was really moist... just needs the given amount of sugar.

Really outstanding. Really rich. I had to make a couple of adjustments since I didn't have peanut butter chips. I increased the Reese's from 10 to 15 and also used crunchy peanut butter since that's what I had on hand. A definite keeper!

I made these cookies without deviating from the recipe (ok, so I did use the small peanut butter cups cut in half, froze, and then inserted into the middle) and they are delicious with a great consistency and texture. Will make again!

I used bittersweet chips and extra peanut butter cups in place of the chips. The bittersweet chips kept this from being too sweet. The extra pb cups gave the cookie lots of flavor. I loved how they taste frozen.

These were really good, my family loved them.  Took the advice and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup crisco, and froze the peanut butter cups and used 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  I forgot the baking soda, but they still turned out great.  I think these would even be great without the peanut butter cups.  Great recipe, will surely be making again!

These cookies are DECADENT! I'd say the peanut butter cups don't add much to the cookies though; you hardly even know they're there. But that doesn't matter because the peanut butter and chocolate chips do the job nicely! I didn't put all the cocoa powder in, and the peanut butter taste held very nicely. Just watch the cook time, it's tough to tell when they're done as they don't brown much on top and feel mushy to the touch at first because of all the chocolate chips. Just make sure the bottom is a nice golden brown and that the top of the cookies begin to crack and separate.

Great recipe!!

Although I had a lot of substitutions (no peanut butter cups and peanut butter chips, and used more chocolate chips and walnuts), this was absolutely excellent made with the Ghiradelli sweet ground chocolate.  If you decide to use it, use 2/3 c Ghiradelli sweet ground chocolate and 1/3 c white sugar as substitutions.

I followed the advice of previous posts and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 Crisco and 1/2 dark and 1/2 light brown sugar.
The results were great!

These cookies take a little effort to make, but it's well worth it.  I made the mistake of making these for a church get-together and now people in my church try to come up with excuses for a get-together just so they can request me to bring these cookies.  I'm not a big fan of chocolate, but it's just the right balance between the chocolate and peanut butter.  This is the new favorite cookie of all my friends.

This recipe was GREAT even though I eliminated the coco powder, completely forgot about the peanut butter chips and used the mini peanut butter cups instead (which, to the advice to another reviewer, I froze at first).  What I did that that made it a hit was insert the pb cups in the middle of the cookie before smushing it with a fork.  It gave it a wonderful surprise when you bit into the middle!

I don't know if perhaps I did something wrong when I made these but they were awful!! I am shocked, due to the raving reviews..They were dry and the only part that had flavor was the actual peanutbutter cups and the chips. I just ended up picking those pieces out and discarding the rest of this. Seriously, it reminded me of stale bread.

These are some of the best cookies I've ever made.  Even at high altitude, they turned out soft and chewy.  I didn't change a thing, although I did add about a tablespoon of water to the dough before adding all the candy because it was such thick dough!  I also highly recommend baking on parchment paper... I've never tried that but it kept the bottoms from getting burnt.  Delicious!!!

These are as easy and as good as all the other reviews have mentioned.  This is my first year baking loads of X-mas cookie and this recipe was a hit.  I actually took the basic ingrediants (Butter, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, flour, baking soda) and changed some of the other ingrediants to make some amazing alternatives...such as: Extra vanilla extract, vanilla soy protein instead of cocoa powder, vanilla chips, peanut butter chips, white chocolate chips. OR I used peppermint extract with cocoa powder, extra butter, peppermint chips, chocolate chips, pieces of candy canes & peppermint bark.  Or Almond extract with vanilla soy protein, almond butter, dried cherries, almonds, and vanilla chips.  All variations I tried turned out great...I am NOT a baker and making alternatives was fun and easy...I can't way to try nutella or other butters like pumpkin or apple...I bet the possiblities are endless...

I thought that these cookies were great but there were so many chocolate chips and peanut butter chips and reeces that there was almost no dough. and my family loved them and we each had to pick a recipe for christmas that we had never had before and my brother, and stepdad liked these more then their cookie recipe... my mom was to whimpy to admit defeat though!

If you like peanut butter cups, this recipe is for you. Excellent. Instead of using 1 cup of choc. chips and 1 cup of peanut butter chips, Nestle sells a combination of both. I used the whole 12 oz package. They are absolutely delicious.

These cookies are out of this world.  Every year I host family and friends for hot chocolate and cookies at the Santa Claus parade.  I was looking for something other than the regular chocolate chip cookie and found this one.  DON'T change the recipe.  It is absolutely perfect the way it is.  I made the cookies a week ahead and froze them without problems.  All my guests raved about them and my husband is hooked!!  One recipe made 5 dozen good sized cookies!  These will be a staple at my annual Santa Claus Parade "Party"!

Delicious!  I've made these with and without the cocoa powder, either way they're a hit.  I use a bag of miniature peanut butter cups, cut into fourths.  Definitely a crowd pleaser.

I'm not a big chocolate fan, but I do like PB cookies.  I made these and it had the perfect blend of PB and Chocolate so it wasn't to rich or overbearing.  THESE ARE THE BEST.

TIP: 
I freeze the PB cups and then let them thaw for about a minute before cutting them into pieces.  I also put my batter in the fridge inbetween cooking times to keep it colder.  It keeps the cookies super moist and the cook better.

These are GOOD cookies! I love to bake cookies and am always looking for another recipe. I read the reviews and made the following changes:  1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening, 2 tsps. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. salt, 10 oz. bag of peanut butter chips, and 1 cup of peanut butter. The cookies were puffy, moist and oh-so-flavorful! Thank you, Joanna.

I am not sure what constitutes a great recipe. After reading all of the reviews I expected something great. Instead, I got just okay, overly sweet peanut butter cookies with a lot of chocolate. These cookies are not worth the expense or the time unless you like sugar bombs!

Yummy!  One of the best cookies I have ever had!  I left out the Reeses Peanut Butter Cups altogether and they tasted awesome! They are very rich and very sweet...sometime I may try the cups too but they were perfect without!

Very good!  I tried a trick my mom taught me years ago...I used half butter and half crisco for a cookie that's not too hard or too soft.  I took them to an office dinner and everyone wanted the recipe!  They went fast at a family gathering, too.

I, too, used 1/2 shortening 1/2 butter and had wonderfully soft cookies.  I used frozen Reese's bites, and they were great.  Sent them on hubby's camping/hunting trip, and all the guys said they were the best cookies they'd ever had.  Definitely a keeper!

They were good (of course anything with those ingredients would be!)  but I think that it could stand to tone down on the candies, and you couldn't really taste much peanut butter, it was mostly chocolate.

Taste just like Reese Peanut Butter Cups.  I'm excited to try it with Snickers, caramel chips and peanuts the next time.  Made exactly like recipe. No substituting with this one!

Delicious!  I didn't have the peanut butter chips or cups on hand so I just threw in a bag of chocolate chips.

I'm not sure if my expectation was little too high after reading a lot of great reviews or these cookies weren't just what I was looking for....  Cookies didn't flatten at all and they were VERY soft cookies.  They didn't taste bad at all but just weren't what I expected....

This is probably the best cookie I have ever had!  I followed directions exactly and they were wonderful!!!  I had the mini Reese Cups and just cut them in half and I likely used about 25 of them.  AMAZING!!!!

This is a good recipe and I followed the suggestions of others. But my warning is that these cookies are RICH!  And I have a sweet tooth, but these are sweet for even me.  Other than that, they're great!

Pretty good, but if I were to make them again I'd probably skip the cocoa powder.  And they were a little too cake-like for me.

I am just now baking these and so far all 3 trays are terrible. I wish I would not have added the cocoa, but they are all gummy and have way too much chocolate (even though I love chocolate).  I have tried cooking them longer, leaving them on the tray longer and they still taste terrible.  I wish I would learn and try a small batch first.

Very good (and rich!) cookie, if you are looking for a peanut butter cookie with chocolate highlights. I myself am more of a chocolate person and wished there was more of a chocolatey flavor and less of a peanut butter focus - I'll probably use 2 C chocolate chips and skip the PB chips next time and see how that goes for me!

These cookies are great.  Perfect texture.  I made them on my BBQ with a pizza stone and parchment paper.  I kept the BBQ at 350 degrees and watched closely to the first batch to make sure I pulled them in time.  My construction workers loved them too as we have been in a huge remodel and have no kitchen!

Everyone fell in love with these cookies when I made them!  I have been getting nothing but requests since I made these cookies!  I would definitely recommend.  As other reviewers suggested, I reduced the cocoa powder to about 1/8 cup and this was perfect.

The two chips and candy pieces were delicious. I actually accidentally used self-rising flour, which has baking powder, soda, and salt in it. I left out the soda and made the recipe anyways: they did not spread at all, but still taste great. So while I can't accurately rate the recipe, don't worry if you use the wrong flour. I probably won't make quite as written again just because all the PB cups are kind of expensive for cookies, but I enjoyed making these - thanks for sharing.

I thought these were very good but my husband and kids loved them.  In all fairness I didn't follow the recipe exactly...omitted cocoa powder, decreased white sugar to 1/4 cup, and added a 3.4 oz box of vanilla pudding mix (keeps the cookies soft without having to use shortening).  My biggest problem was that even after 10 minutes in the oven and 10 minutes left on the hot pan they were still quite soft.  I prefer a cookie that's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Will try again and play with the cooking times.

I wanted to make something different, so I made these cookies.  I absolutely love making cookies, and I have several really good recipes, and I just added this one to the collection.  I made these cookies as stated, no alterations, and they were marvelous!  My husband and two kids also loved them.  I did add a few chunks of Reese's cups to each cookie about a minute before they finished cooking, which gave it a very appealing look.  Enjoy!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

These cookies are awesome!  I did use some of the suggestions of others....1/2 light and 1/2 dark brown sugar, 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco, frozen pb cups, large chunk chocolate.  Thank you Joanna for a delish recipe and one that is open to all kinds of variations!  Perfect!

Followed advice of others and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup crisco.  I didn't have peanut butter chips, so obviously didn't add those.  Froze my quarter pb cups as others suggested.  Also let my cookies sit on the tray for 10 minutes after coming out of the oven.  Now, for my details:  I will not add cocoa next time - not necessary at all.  Will try adding a half cup or so of chopped pecans - think that might help to cut the sweetness a bit.  I might even cut back on the white sugar a bit - maybe to 1/2 cup.  Otherwise, a yummy cookie - made these for my favorite son-in-law who is coming to visit with our daughter, because he LOVES Reese's peanut butter cups....don't be concerned I'm playing favorites, as he's our ONLY son-in-law!  Thanks Joanna for a great recipe!

They taste good, but if you follow the recipe like I did, they're difficult to put together. The dough is very dry, so all those "chip's don't blend well at all. Also, they do not flatten out like a chcocolate chip ccokie (or the photo) I froze the Reeses bits,but that didn't help much. Sorry, but I would NOT make these again.Way too much work.

As per other reviews I used 1/2 shortening & 1/2 butter. I also only used 1/4 cup white sugar (I ran out)  with 3/4 dark brown sugar and these were plenty sweet enough. I also cut back the cocoa power to about 1.5 TBL because I wanted to taste the PB. These cookies came out thick with a crispy outside and moist middle. I only cooked them for 9 mins and let them rest on the sheet for 9 mins before transferring to wire rack. This recipe is a keeper.

We love cookies and this is a new favorite! I added chopped reese cups and reese pieces instead of chocolate and peanut butter chips. Next time the only thing I would change is leaving out the cocoa. I would have liked it be more of a peanut butter cookie.

Read many of the reviews before I made them.  Decided to do as many others did and cut way back on the cocoa powder, maybe used a tablespoon or two.  I pressed the frozen cut up reese's into the cookies before I baked. Everything else I did as written. Love, love, love these!  My boyfriend ate them about 3 of them before I even had them on the cooling rack.

These cookies were delicious!  My husband and kids loved them and kept wanting more!  I didn't have the peanut butter chips, but added more peanut butter cups and they turned out fantastic!

Amazing cookies! I didn't add the cocoa powder and I am very thankful for it, because these are insanely rich cookies.

I thought these were GREAT.  I went with others' suggestions (half shortening, less cocoa, freezing the pb cup pieces (I went with minis cut into quarters)).  Note that for me, the cookies didn't really "melt" much -- they kept the form that I put them on the cookie sheet (pretty much like a drop cookie).  [EDIT - I realized why -- I actually only used 1/2 STICK of butter, rather than half CUP (i.e., a full stick) -- I thought they looked dry when mixing and left out the extra 1/4 cup of flour -- they still turned out great, anyway!]  This was great -- I didn't have to space them out much.  I also made them a little too big at first, which also worked out fine, but required a little extra cooking time (i.e., what's in the recipe instead of shorter like some recommended).  Also -- I used all natural peanut butter.  Worked out (and tasted!) great, even with no further adjustments to the recipe (i.e., didn't add extra sugar that you might find in most peanut butters). Next time, I might leave out the cocoa altogether, didn't seem to add too much.  Enjoy them!

It don't get better than this cookie.  I have a small baking business and I have one customer that has order these 4 times in the past 5 months.  He orders 4 dozen at a time.  Like other reviews it helps to freeze the peanut butter cups before adding to the batter.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

These are wonderful! All of my favorite things in one cookie. They're very sweet, so a glass of milk is a must, but I'll be making these often.

Excellent recipe - I limited the cocoa to 1/4 cup o bring out the PB flavor. Be sure to freeze the mini pb cups, they will hold their shape better. Only cook 6-7 minutes, any longer and they won't taste nearly as good. They freeze well, too...

These are wonderful! Everyone loved how soft they were. I combined all of the ingredients the night before and refridgerated it overnight then added the cut up peanut butter cups the day I baked them(put in freezer till right before I started actually baking). I didn't put the entire amount of cocoa powder in. I only baked for 8 mins. or slightly over and they were perfect. My favorite new cookie this season!

This really is a great recipe. I just tried a similar recipe out of the Death By Chocolate cookbook (that has this most amazing white chocolate cheesecake...) but I was so disappointed with the cookies from DBC. This recipes is BY FAR much yummier! Everyone who tries them when I make them raves and asks for the recipe.

Not bad! I was initially somewhat disappointed after baking and cooling them, but the next day after sitting overnight they were much better. Based on prior reviews, I too used the half butter, half crisco option. I used a scooper to portion them and after the first round baked, decided to squish them down a bit before baking so they didn't look like mini-ice cream scoops, and this worked well. A lot of reviewers said to underbake these - I found 10 minutes to be perfect. The reason I didn't give this recipe four stars is that they taste a little too commercial for me (very similar to the Grandma's brand), but I've had nothing but good reviews from others, such as my boyfriend who now considers them a good breakfast alternative :)

Without a doubt the best cookies I've ever had. Read other reviews and made some modifications. Left out the cocoa, added some walnuts, used half butter half butter flavored Crisco, half light and half dark brown sugar. Easy to make and it yields sveral dozen cookies. Fabulous!

Made these last night.  One of the best cookies I've ever made and I make a LOT of cookies. Great taste and texture. It helps to freeze the peanut butter cups before adding to the dough to keep them together.  Or you can just top each cookie with the peanut butter cup wedge.

These are THE most requested cookie at my house. Every year on Valentine's day I bake these in a heart shape mold cookie pan and give to my kids teachers...creating envy among other teachers! They are very chocolaty, chewy, yummy and oh so decadent!

These cookies were pretty good. I am a real Reeses fan, but between the peanut butter and the peanut butter chips, the taste was a little too peanut buttery. I would have like to taste the chocolate a bit more. Also, my cookies came out a little dry. It was probably something I did, but next time I think I would not leave them sitting on the sheet after they came out of the oven.

These cookies are incredible.  I get rave reviews from everyone who tries them.  I have yet to make them with the peanut butter chips, but substituting white chocolate chips is delicious!  Like many before, I cut the cocoa to about 1/4 cup for more peanut butter flavor.  Watching for cracks in the cookies is the key to determining when they are done.  And freezing the PB cups before hand is a must!  Thanks for the awesome recipe:)

Perfect! I used Reeses pieces instead of the peanut butter cups. I also used crisco instead of butter and added a bit of baking powder because I didn't want them to spread too much. My co-workers loved them.

Yuck. These cookies were way too sweet. My family loves all types of sweets, the sweeter and more chocolate the better. They found these cookies disgusting and way to sweet. 
Plus, baking them was a nightmare. I had to set them outwside when pulled from the oven to cool for about 10 mins or they would crumble. Even after letting them cool for about 30 mins they still fell apart. I followed the direction exactly. Takes too long and not worth it.

Very good cookies. My sister and daughter loved them. Didn't have peanutbutter chips so I used a bag of mik chocolate chips and mini Reeses Peanutbutter Cups. Saved some chopped up for when they came out of the oven and stuck some chunks in the top for an added treat. Yummy!

These cookies came out soft and delicious! The only change I made to the recipe was to use a half cup butter and a half cup shortening instead of the full cup of butter called for. I find I usually only like cookies when they are warm from the oven, but these cookies stayed so soft and moist as they cooled that they were even better cold! Great Recipe!

I love this recipe!! I've been making it for awhile now. The only thing different I do is that I cut the peanut butter cups in half and press them on top of the cookie once I've put the dough on the cookie sheet. I love to bite into the peanut butter cup!! So if you do it this way, you'll need more peanut butter cups!! This is my favorite cookie!!!

I'd followed everything in this receipe except for the amount of chips and peanut butter cups. I'd used maybe just a little over a cup of chips; half peanut butter and half chocolate chips. I'd added 6 Reese's Peanut Butter Cups instead. They turned out awesome, though I did have to bake them longer than the time specified, probably because mine were pretty big and thick.

This recipe is sooooo good!  I used minature Reeses peanut butter cups, and added a cup of semi-sweet chips.  I also used Chucky Peanut butter,and mixed the cocoas from regular to supreme.
This recipe is easily adaptable and a wonderful combo!

These are the best!  Even if you tone them down a bit- I cut out the cocoa and the peanut butter cups and these cookies are still delicious!!  I've never gone wrong when serving these.  Enjoy.

These are really good!  In place of all the chips, and the big pb cups, I used a 12 oz. package of Trader Joe's mini pb cups.  They're so cute and just the right size- about the size of a larger chocolate chip.  If I had them, I would have added about 1/2 cup pb chips, but it was fine without them.  8 minutes was a perfect baking time.  They have a great texture- chewy and soft.  I used 1 cup unbleached flour and for the rest, I used whole wheat pastry flour.  I also used Adam's natural pb.  I reduced the white sugar by 1/4 cup.  I've been wanting to try this recipe for a long time and I'm glad I finally did!

This is by far the most delightfully sinful cookie I have ever tried!!! The only thing I can say to those who have failed at this recipe is to just make sure they follow the instructions and watch their baking times!!!! Will make this one over and over again for years to come :)

I made the cookies as written except used only 2 cups flour.  The cookies were quite cakey and after the first batch, I flattened them with my fingers.  They were a bit better, if not better looking. Nothing is better than a good cookie with a glass of cold milk!

These cookies turned out really good! Living in Australia, i couldn't find any peanut butter chips so i added some extra chocolate chips instead.  I scaled the recipe down to 18, just so i didnt make too many unwanted cookies if they turned put horrible. The mixture was waay too thick and i had to add another egg and 3 tblspns of water just to be able to stir it!
And after i first baked them they were VERY soft, and so i left them to cool and baked them for another 5 mins to harden them.I then left them to cool for another 15 mins. But in the end the cookies turned out great!

Good cookies, but I can't say they are the best I've ever had. The dough is super thick. Whoever wrote to add a tbls of water, very smart. It helped.

Doubled the recipe and sent them to my husband's fire academy - they happily ate them all! A bit too sweet for me, though (but I'm wierd, that way!). I cut back on the peanut butter cups - it seemed a bit much.  Baked for 8 minutes - nice and soft! I used natural creamy peanut butter - which worried me at first, since it can be a pain to mix it well - but it worked great!

Very good, nice and moist! They are much better once they've cooled. I substituted 1/4 c. of shortening for 1/4 c. of butter and left out the choc. chips. I used about 20 mini pb cups cut in 1/4's and 1 1/2 c. of pb chips.

These cookies were good, but we were a little overloaded by all the goodies inside, so we put in the choc. chips and pb cups, but omitted the pb chips, and that was just about right for our family.  To us, they were too dry the first day, but the next day they were moist and delicious.  I will definitely try these again.

I made these cookies yesterday... at first I thought they were going to have too many fillers - I left out 3 of the peanut butter cups for this reason - but they were AMAZING.  Moist and delicious!  My boyfriend LOVED them.  They are rich but heck, you only need one cookie anyway.  ;-)

Very good but VERY rich. I ate so much of the batter when I was making the cookies I got sick, and wasn't able to touch a single cookie afterwards...but I did get lots of compliments on them. Don't change the recipe...its perfect the way it is.

These are the BEST cookies ever!  I was looking for something new to add to my holiday cookie lot this year, and these will be made every year now!  If you're a peanut butter & chocolate lover, these will be your favorite cookie!  They were great warm out of the oven, but as another reviewer mentioned, they're even better when they're completely cooled.  I substituted 30 mini PB cups for the full-size ones and substituted a whole bag of the PB/chocolate swirl chips for the PB & chocolate chips called for.  I also let the cookies cool on the sheets for a good 5-6 minutes before moving them to cooling racks.  These cookies are pretty fragile right out of the oven because of all the PB cups & chips in them.  What a great recipe, I'll make these again and again!  Thanks Joanna!!!

These cookies are AWESOME! You better be a peanut buttery, chocolate eaten kind of person because this IS THE COOKIE. I used white chocolate peanut butter cups, left out the peanut butter chips, and put chocolate chunks and chips in. It was so good!! This is a very rich cookie however.  Make sure you let sit for those couple of minutes because they will fall apart due to it is a moist cookie. Good Eats everyone!!!

I just finished making a batch of these cookies and they were just awesome.  The only thing I did different than the recipe is I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet since that's all I had.  I will definitely be making these again.

All I have to say is DO NOT LEAVE OUT THE PEANUT BUTTER CUPS!!!  I followed this recipie to a T and loved it, but I can definately see how some people would want to leave out some of the chips, I think the cups are what makes the cookie though.

DEADLY,
I cut the sugar, using only 3/4 cups brown sugar. I also used crunchy PB. Instead of milk chocolate I used pure dark chocolate mini chips & 9 PB cups instead of 10. DEADLY!!

These are truly the best!  They taste like a really soft peanut butter cookie loaded with chocolate and more peanut butter!  Yummers!  I baked for 12 minutes and left on the cookie sheet for an hour before removing to ensure they didn't fall apart as easily because they are so soft!

YUMMY!!!!  These are the best cookies...they are moist, not hard at all.  I baked for 9 minutes & then let them sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes to let them set up.  Everyone should have this in their recipe box.  My husband saw the recipe out & actually helped me make them after the kids went to bed!!!

didn't really like these, they were a little too cake like and dry for my taste.  I loved all the ingredients in them, that's why I tried it, but they were VERY think and dense, not chewy and not moist, maybe I did something wrong?

This recipe tastes so good. It's easy to follow and after reading the other reviews, I made so changes so the cookie doesn't fall apart. I used 2 cups of flour and 18 mini chocolate peanut butter cups cut into forths. I put the dough back into the refrigerator to avoid the dough going too soft between baking. I had a total of 4 1/2 dozen and every cookie came out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe.

These cookies are amazing!  I was a little skeptical due to some really bad reviews but I absolutely agree with everyone who rated  them 5 stars.  I only used 1 cup of choc/peanut butter chips and I quarted 20 small peanut butter cups (some fell apart but I threw them in too).   This is a perfect cookie recipe.

I wish there were more stars to award, because this is one of the best cookies I've ever had. The cookies are tender and chewy, with wonderful bites of chocolate chip, peanut butter chips, and peanut butter cups. I used parchment paper on my cookie sheets and made sure the cookies cooled for 2-3 minutes before removing (per instructions), and they were perfect.  Instead of Reese's peanut butter cups, I used Sam's Choice (from Walmart) and cut them into quarters.  I doubled the recipe and found that one bag of Sam's Choice peanut butter cups was perfect.  I put the peanut butter cups in the refrigerator for a while before I cut them up, which made them a snap to cut.  I will make this cookie over and over again.

I never measure anything well, and so whether my fault or not, it was a bit dry so added about 1/4 cup liquid coffee which just happened to be near.  I didn't have any peanut butter cups, so just added more chips.  The results were wonderful, and passed the kids and dads test with flying colors.

I should start by saying that I used a lot of the suggestions of previous reviewers. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco, and omitted the cocoa for more of a peanut butter cookie with chunks/chips flavor. I also used mini PB cups that I cut in half and froze before adding to the batter. The "pros" of this cookie are that it looked absolutely fantastic and had a very delicate crumbly texture.  My PB cups remained as yummy chunks and really looked/tasted great in the cookie. The "cons" were that it was relatively time consuming to prepare with the unwrapping, cutting, and freezing of the PB cups, the actual "cookie" part did not have much flavor despite the 3/4 c. PB in the batter, and worst of all the cookie looked much better than it tasted IMO (it looked fantastic but tasted OK). 

All in all, it's not a BAD recipe overall IMO, it's just not that great, and considering the amount of special ingredients that I had to buy because I don't usually keep them around the house (PB cups and chips) and the time it took to prep the recipe, I don't think I'd be especially inclined to make them again.

5*'s  I took the advise and used the MILK chocolate chips.(personal preference) Wow, what a cookie.  Some have mentioned the baking time is a problem at first.  I recommend placing the oven rack in the -middle- of the oven.  These are "fat" not flat cookies and need the heat to surround them evenly.  That may be the answer. Another hint is to use a pizza cutter to cut the COLD PBcups. Just lay them upside down and cut away.  Very fast!  Can't wait to share them on my Christmas platters.

These cookies are really, really rich.  They are good and moist, but they are the only cookies in months to stay in the jar longer than 3 days.(We really like cookies!)  Also, I was hoping for more of a resemblance to REECE peanut butter cups - which they're not.

If you're like me and you LOVE sugary, gooey, sweet treats than this is THE recipe! I went off my diet for these babies and it was worth it. If you follow this recipe exactly then you'll get moist, rich, peanut butter and chocolate cookies that will put you into a sugar-induced coma. Don't leave out any of the chocolate chips, cocoa, peanut butter chips or peanut butter cups because that's for weaklings! My only suggestion is to make them bigger than a tablespoon, these killer cookies don't expand very much during the baking process. 
If you want a cookie that will knock the socks off of everyone and make you shakey with sugar, than this is the right recipe. If not, I'm sure there's a safe ol' oatmeal cookie recipe hanging around here somewhere. Cheers!

These are fantastic...I took them to work this week, and people absolutely raved. Got several requests for the recipe. I found that they actually make about four dozen instead of three (still good sized cookies, too). I didn't have regular Reese's, but had a bag of the new "Inside Out" Reese's where the chocolate is on the inside and the peanut butter is on the outside, and needless to say they were still delicious.

This is an excellent recipe!  My husband, daughter and I enjoyed them, especially warm.  We did add the cocoa and thought they tasted great.  Thank you for a such a great "keeper"!

Very good, but I would take out the cocoa if I make them again.  I put 1 1/2 cups of chips and only 6 Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, so it wasn't too sweet.  The candy didn't overwhelm the cookie.

A nice blend of chocolate and peanut butter, although the peanut butter cups are not that noticeable.  I wish I would have read the previous reviews for using 1/2 Crisco.  I will do that next time.  The cookies are quite soft.  I was able to get 4 dozen good sized cookies out of this batch.

This recipe didn't turn out how I expected it to, but the cookies were still delicious.  I was expecting more of a peanut butter explosion than I got.  My husband also commented that you couldn't really taste the peanut butter cups in the cookies.  Maybe next time I'll try wrapping the dough around the peanut butter cups...

I used to work in a bakery and consider cookie-baking one of my best talents. These cookies are fabulous! I am not even a big peanut butter fan, but these things are irresistable. I used chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips and left out the peanut butter chips- and they still tasted great.

This cookie was awesome.  I have never had so many people tell me how wonderful my cookies were.  I made these for a cookie exchange party as well as a Christmas potluck at my work.  Everybody raved about them and they gone lickity split.  I followed some advice from the others, I used half Crisco and half butter, half light brown sugar and half dark brown sugar, and I used Reeses bites, whoch worked out great.  I also used one entire bag of peanut butter and chocolate chips (all mixed in the same bag) and they worked out great!  Thank you!

Just made these tonight!!  Turned out great!  I love the fact that there is peanut butter IN the cookie and not just the peanut butter chips.  I didn't put the peanut butter cups in though...too many chunks!!  Thanks so much for the recipe, Joanna!!  I will be making these ALOT!!

I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco.  I also used 1/4 a cup of cocoa instead of 1/2 a cup.  It baked for 8 minutes and as good and gooey.  However, they are a bit rich.

All I can say is "WOW"! Every chocolate/peanut butter fan will adore these! Two changes I made were to use MILK chocolate chips & to use mini peanut butter cups, cut in half, & one half pressed into the top of each cookie before baking.

I got 4 dozen from this recipe. Overall a delicious twist on a favorite candy combination. My batch stayed soft for days but did turn out a bit dry and crumbled easily. Still enjoyed the flavor. Maybe using half the called for butter and the other half butter Crisco would help the dryness.

These cookies are delicious and a big hit.  They make more than the recipe says.  I got around 4 dozen.  They are very soft, but the dough turns out a bit dry and they crumble easily.  Overall, a good cookie.

These are good but not great, not really worth the effort required. I've never heard of so many chips in a recipe and I didn't even notice the peanut butter cups! Very hard to tell when they are done cooking as they finish VERY soft.  They harden later.

I really liked this recipe.  It's simple and straight forward.  I don't like to sweet cookies so the only change I did was to use only 1/2 cup sugars (both kind).  I did have light and brown sugar mix and did like the taste of that.  Also, I had chocolate peanut butter chips which worked great.  The batter was easy to spoon out and after it's done baking.  So light and fluffy.  Perfect taste for me.  Feels like you could eat 20 of these and not get that heavy feeling.  Can't say it enough.  Super light and fluffy batter.  Just yummy.  Oh, and another reason.  The batter doesn't spread everywhere when baking.  It's great!

I thought these cookies were really chocolatey!  I used mini peanut butter cups as suggested and baked for 11 mins. at 350.  My husband thought they were to sweet and to much chocolate.

Awesome... These were a hit at a dinner party. thanx. Keeping this recipe for sure.I followed the recipe almost to the "T". The only thing i did different was i added mini chocolate chips and reese pieces on top and inside . Bake only 10 minutes .. they came out perfect. Soft and chewy. The recipe is great to make ahead.I made it the night before and refrigerated till i baked them. Great to make ahead and keep in the fridge when u need them . Freezable too. I keep already patted down balls in the freezer and bake from frozen. They taste awesome.Kids will luv them too.The recipe made 48 large cookies for me. 1  hour to prepare and bake ...gone in half.:) hey, all i got was "these are delicous and will u give me the recipe". Thanks again.

these are incredibly good and addictive; if you like peanut butter and chocolate, these are for you.  I only used 2T. of cocoa powder (I was afraid it would be too strong as other reviewers said); I might use more next time.  for the additions I used 1c. mixed pb and milk chocolate chips, 1c. frozen mini Trader Joe's pb cups, and 1c. mini reese's pieces.  the recipe made 4.5 dozen for me.  soooo good, I had one for breakfast this morning.  I baked them for 7-8 minutes and they were underbaked when I took them out but slightly golden on top.  3 days later, they're still fresh and chewy (I keep them in the fridge).  my family liked them too!  thanks for sharing!

Delicious!! I did things a little differently though. I did the half Crisco, half butter thing, added 1/2 t. salt, and 2 t. vanilla instead of just one. And since my husband loves honey I added about five tablespoons for a hint of flavor. I also left out the cocoa powder. They turned out perfect!

I followed the advice of the top reviewer and these were hands down the best cookies I've ever made.  I using 1/2 shortening really keeps them soft the next day.

I had read the ingredient list wrong and had bought mini peanut butter cups rather than the big ones.  I cut 30 of them into thirds.  

The batter was a bit crumbly and I found it hard to work with.  

The taste of the cookies was fantastic.  Perhaps the best chocolate peanut butter cookies that I have ever made.

These cookies were absolutely the best chocolate peanut butter cookies I've ever made.  I also used mini peanut butter cups and cut them in half instead of using large ones and cutting them smaller.  This recipe is PERFECT!!

Followed Looders popular review by using 1/2 butter, 1/2 crisco, 1/2 lt. and 1/2 dk. brown sugars, less cocoa powder and mini peanut butter cups.  I was taking this to a potluck and made them as bars instead (put them in a glass 13x9 pan and baked for 20 minutes).  Were full of flavor and very chewy and moist...everyone raved.  I give them 5 stars for that (I thought they were a little on the sweet side and would've given them 4).  Great party dish.

These. Are. Awesome.  We actually omit the peanut butter cups altogether because the last thing my fat gut needs is peanut butter cups on top of the chocolate & peanut butter chips.  This does not detract from the yummy goodness whatsoever.

Oh.  My.  GOSH.  These are indeed the best cookies ever.  I made them last night and did like everyone suggested - froze some mini peanut butter cups, cut them in half, and pushed them into the center of the dough before baking.  Also, because peanut butter chips, chocolate chips, and peanut butter cups weren't decadent enough, I also tossed in a cup of Reese's Pieces.  My co-workers think these cookies should be renamed The Most Delicious Cookies Ever.

Very good cookies and easy to make.  I didn't have any peanut butter cups, so I didn't use them.  I scooped them out with a mini cookie scoop and they didn't flatten much at all during baking.  I only put them in the oven for 7 minutes and they are melt in your mouth yummy!!

These cookies are great.  I tried making them to replicate a new cookie that they introduced at Dunkin Donuts which was good, but too hard.  These are nice and soft.  I agree with the reviewer who suggested cutting then freezing the peanut butter cups.  These turn out great every time.  Oh, I also omit the cocoa in the batter, it's not necessary.

I think I might have overbaked them (10 minutes).  After they cooled they crumbled apart.  Taste is GREAT, but fell apart very easily.  Take the other reviews into consideration and UNDERBAKE.

These are the type of cookie that look obscenely fattening and taste as good. Very rich and sweet.  I found that the peanut butter cups got buried in the batter so I cut up some and pressed one or two into the cookies when they just came out of the oven.  It gives them that packed with candy look.

very good- kinda tastes like a chocolate peanut butter brownie.  I left out the peanut butter chips because I didn't have any and they were still great.  Not chewy- very dense.  I think next time I might omit just a little flour.

I made these cookies for my friend for her bday as she loves chocolate and peanut butter cups.  I thought they were way too sweet and a little too rich.  I think I would make a few changes before making them again like cutting down a lot on the sugar.  If you have a strong sweet tooth though than these are defintley the cookie for you.

I liked this recipe, it was really easy to make. Wasn't as sweet as I would've liked, but it was good. I don't like chocolate, but they were still tasty.

These are by far the BEST cookies!  If you love chocolate and pnb....these are for you! Don't change this recipe, make it as is and make sure you have plenty of milk in the house!  I made these for my office during the holidays and got rave reviews.  Thank you so much for sharing this delicious cookie!!!

These are fantastic cookies.  They are moist inside, crisp outside and have a great appearance.  I'm thrilled with them and will definitely make them again.

I made these cookies for a bake sale at work and they sold out in the first 15mins.  Very heavy cookies but very delicious.

I agree completely that these are the best cookies ever! I usually have problems with my cookies coming out, but these are perfect. I also skipped the cocoa and had to cook them around 16 minutes per batch but they are delicious!

While these cookies were good next time Im going to take the advice of another reviewer and not add the cocoa powder. We arent huge fans of chocolate cookies although we love chocolate chip cookies.I should have done this the first time I made them.

These cookies are brilliant! I didnt have any of the choc chips etc so instead i added two small bananas. They turned out wonderfully. They spread quite a bit on the try...probably due to the banana.
They taste best when left to cool and crisp up.

these cookies were out of this world!
i've been searching for a new cookie recipe - something different, and this is just what i wanted!
they almost had a rich cocoa/bitterness to them.
i don't know what peanut cups are so i didn't put them in. i used white chocolate chips and dark chocolate chips in place of the p. b cups and chips.

wonderful beautiful!!!

thankyou very much

this will be a new favourite indeed.

The cookies are a tad too sweet for me eventhough I didn't add any peanut butter chips in them. I would suggest cutting down the sugar by 1/2 C. I froze the batter before baking them so they would be less spread out and more puffy (I tried frozen and unfrozen). Definitely worth a shot :)

I have been on a very successfull role with 5 star cookies.  These are just what everyone says...very, very good.  One would think with all the chocolate it would be to chocolate but not indeed.  Will cook again.

These cookies were pretty good overall, i expected them to be more moist since everyone was saying that, they were better when i ate them the second day because they practically crumbled  once you took a bite on the first day. but this is definately a sweet tooth cookie! eat them with a glass of milk - you'll need it! :)

I was curious to try these...I used all name brand ingredients for these...they were ok, presentation nice, baked nicely, but I think I would have added a little more hershey's cocoa powder...mine were much lighter in color than those pictured here.  I used the correct amt of cocoa.  A slice of bread added to the container has kept these soft; otherwise I think they would have gotten a little on the hard side.  They are presentable for my christmas platter but probably won't make again.

These cookies are fabulous! I am a huge fan of anything that combines chocolate and peanut butter!  I will say that these are extremely rich cookies, and a small batch (I made a half batch) will go a long way.  These are officially one of my staple Christmas cookies!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  I love peanut butter cups and this was perfect!  Just make sure there is enough batter in the cookies around the chips to bake.  Otherwise, they fall apart!  The stoneware is also the key to softer cookies!

I made these cookies because I love peanut butter and chocolate together and they were fantastic. The only change I made was using peanut butter and milk chocolate swirl chips and mini peanut butter cups.  These cookies were so moist and stayed moist for over a week.  I will definately make these again. Thanks for the recipe.

These were so good and soft!  The changes I made were subtle.  I used chunky peanut butter, peanut butter and chocolate swirl chips and a cup of peanut butter/chocolate ships mixed.  These were a huge hit.

Wow!!!!!!!!!  These cookies are amazing!  I followed the recipe to a T except I didn't have the PB chips.  The cookies don't stick to the pan and are so soft and  delicious.  I will make these again for sure, but not too often because they're so tasty and we eat too many!

My family really liked these, but they were a little soft and goopy for me.  It could be that I undercooked them, but I think there was just not enough flour in them.  I like crunchier cookies, though.  My grandma asked for the recipe.

IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRUE....These are the best... I did however cut back on the sugar by 1/4 and increased the peanut butter by 1/4 cup. I made them without the peanut butter cup pieces AND THEY WERE STILL FANTASTIC... I baked em a few minutes longer the first time so they were crisp... this time i went for the 10 min. and prefer this texture over crispy.  M MMM GOOD!

I was interested to try these cookies for my pb and chocolate loving husband, but I was just unable to add chocolate chips, pb chips AND peanut butter cups to the same recipe.  Instead, I found a bag of Reese's bites at the store and threw those in.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup of each.  I think they're yummy!  I'm sure the original would be, too, but it just seemed like too much to me.

These are great!  I made a double recipe, using an entire 22oz. bag of mini pb cups.  I also omitted the cocoa powder and added just about 1/2 tsp maple flavoring because it really enhances the peanut butter flavor.  Everyone loved them!  Oh, and I also froze the pb cups after I cut each one in half, so that they would stay together better - and they did.  Great recipe!

These cookies are pretty good.  I left out the cocoa because I did not have any, and I added 6 extra p.b. cups because they are my favorite candy bar ever.  Next time I'll try making them with cocoa and see which ones I like better.  They are very sweet and rich.  My kids and hubby liked them a lot.

these are incredible! they simply melt in your mouth (i used crisco). i gave some to a restaurant owner/chef friend of mine. he declared them "excellent". i brought these into work...they disappeared in about an hour. even better the next day (make them the night before you need them). definitely on my christmas cookie list!

These turned out really well. However, after reading the other reviews I made some adjustments. I used 1 cup of smooth peanut butter, only 2/3 cup dark brown sugar, only 3/4 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and only 6 peanut butter cups. I dropped the dough from a level 30ml (1/8 cup) measure and baked them for 12 minutes at 375 instead of 350. Next time I think I will add just a little more peanut butter cup. They turned out perfect though. Crewy, moist and not too sweet.

These made a nice cake like cookie, I didn't have any butter so I used butter flavored crisco instead but it didn't seem to matter.  As one other reviewer suggested be sure to watch the baking time or they get too hard.

I didn't have peanut butter chips or Reese's, so I omitted those. I used 3/4 c. canola oil in place of butter. Any fat that is solid at room temperature (butter or margarine) can clog your arteries, so oil is always a better option & canola oil is lowest in saturated fat (apart from olive oil). When substituting oil for butter/margarine, you need to cut back on the oil because they aren't equal in volume. I put in 3/4 c. oil in place of 1 c. of butter, but next time I will cut back more & put in a 1/2 c, as they were still too oily. They were delicious, but WAY too sweet (maybe also because I used sweeted PB) & I can't imagine how they would have come out w/ the PB chips & Reese's cups as well. So next time I'm cutting the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 c! They are too sweet to eat w/o a glass of milk! That's the only reason I'm giving 4 stars.

How could anyone not like these?  I think they're brilliant and if you're a chocolate and peanut butter lover, you will too!! You must be aware that they don't spread out like most cookies, so it can be hard to tell when they're done. I cooked them for 11 minutes and they were perfect. Will definitely make again!

These cookies were good but the pb does make them mighty crunchy. I over cooked mine, if you want to try this one stick to the baking time recommended; although they're gooey in the oven they'll sure harden up.

I have made these cookies many times.  They are awesome.  Two suggestions though, add a little milk to give the recipe some moisture, second *carefully* mix in the peanut butter cups, otherwise they just get smashed in the dough.

These truly are the best, I over baked the first few batches, but everyone still loved them.  And even my husband, who is totally against eating cookie dough had to walk by me in the kitchen a dozen times to sneak the dough!  He also requested we give away the remaining cookies since he kept snacking on them repeatedly.  These are fabulous!

AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!  I just made these for some cookie bouquets I'm making for Christmas.  Very delicious.  I wasn't sure about the cocoa in the recipe but it turned out fantastic.  They are chewy and gooey and oh so peanut buttery.  Thank you for a great recipe, wouldn't change a thing.

This sounds really delicious, but I am not sure what size peanut butter cups you are suggesting be cut into eighths.

I thought they were very rich, which may have kept me from eating them all in one sitting.  Good cookie to eat in moderation.  Easy recipie to follow, but a lot of ingredients for the end result.

These we so good! Like half chocolate chip, half peanut butter. Everyone loved them.  Even those people in my family that don't care for peanut butter cookies. A keeper. I think I may try them with chunky peanut butter next time though, just to give them a little texture.

Although the cookies are good, I was a little disappointed. They are too cake-like for my taste. Maybe next time I will only add 1 egg? My husband really liked them and said the texture was like a Soft Batch cookie. Definitely worth making!

My cookie eaters are about 75 guys and these have been their favorites out of all the ones I've made.  I only added the peanut butter cups to one batch, I think that they're too much, like everyone else.  But overall, a DEFINITE HIT!!!!

Absolutely, positively the best chocolate/pb cookie in the world!  I've made this recipe about 10 times since I found it.  I've never needed to put in the peanut butter cups... I think they would be ALMOST too sweet.  We just use the chips only.  I make a batch and freeze/refrigerate what I don't want. Just fine out of the freezer.  Never again will I make a plain ole chocolate chip cookie again!!!!  10 stars!

The best!  So peanut buttery and yet still chocolately.  Yum. Yum.  I substituted vegetable shorting for half of the butter.  In addition, I only added 2 cups of flour.

I used Splenda instead of sugar and half soy flour & half regular flour in order to lower the carbs. The cookie dough had a distinct flavor (due to the soy flour, I'm sure) so I increased the Splenda by 1/4 cup.  I should have omitted the cocoa powder to improve peanut butter flavor. I tend to prefer a "blonde" colored cookie, anyway. Also, these cookies came out with a cake-like consistency that I wasn't expecting, maybe because of the change in flour? I would make these again.

These cookies are definitely for the chocolate peanut butter lover. My husband thought they were really good. I didn't use any chips, just broken up mini Reese's peanut butter cups. I think the chips would have been overkill. The batter is really sweet, so I would suggest to use chips or candy, not both.

I liked this recipe because it was so easy.  I took others suggestions: ½ cup butter and ½ cup butter flavored Crisco; 1/4 cup cocoa powder and frozen my regular sized PB cups while preparing.  I didn't like the miniature PB cups....it's too chunky for the dough.  The reg. size chopped up in eighths are perfect.

These are absolutely the best. I made them for a work potluck and they were a huge hit. 
I took the other suggestions and didn't add the cocoa powder and added a little extra peanut butter. They turned out great.

Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These cookies are so good they are pratically eaten as soon as they come out of the oven. A must for the peanut butter lover.

These cookies were ok.  They tasted exactly like Reese's peanut butter cups, so if you like peanut butter cups this recipe is great for you.  This is just not my favorite taste, that's all.

These cookies were SO good!  I made them last night and they were very easy.  I follwed everyone's advice and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, and they are so soft.  I also used my food processor to finely chop the peanut butter cups, so there were no chunks, just even PBC flavor throughout the cookie.  I also used milk chocolate chips...divine!!!!

These cookies were definitely some of the best cookies I've ever had.  I'm 17 and it was the first time I've baked cookies on my own and they turned out great.  The next time I make them, I'm going to cut back on the peanut butter chips or cups because they were very peanut-buttery.  Or I'll add more chocolate chips.  Definitely great cookies though!

from all reports, these cookies are delicious. however, i'm horribly lactose intolerant and can't eat them! but everyone who has tasted them loves them. i might try to vegan-ize this at some point, although it won't be the same.

The peanut butter cups sort of disappear. Also, easy to overbake. However, still a good cookie. Not the best though.

My husband found this recipe and went by my guidelines to only use 5 star recipes.  He was making cookies for the football team my son coaches and needed something quick and easy.  They are delicious.  He made enough for 45 hungry high school boys in a few hours.

I thought these would be alot better from all the good reviews.  I will definetely not make these again.  Something just didn't taste right.  Too much flour maybe?  I did make them into bar cookies (9x13), but that shouldn't make them taste any different.  I'll stick with the recipe on the back of the Reese's peanut butter chip package!

I made these cookies for a non-chocolate liking peanut butter lover and even she loved them! I do cut the cooking time down to 6 minutes as to keep the soft, chewiness of the cookies. A level tablespoon of dough makes the perfect size for these and it makes about 7 doz that way.

I found these cookies to be pretty good. My husband loved them. 
The only thing that I found was that the semi-sweet chips made them a 
little bitter. With my sweet tooth, I found that milk chocolate chips did the trick.

This was a good recipe. I rolled the dough out into balls and then baked them...it was a bit easier and less messier that way.

These cookies taste just like you are eating a Reese's peanut butter cup itself!  They are soft, moist, and wonderful!
