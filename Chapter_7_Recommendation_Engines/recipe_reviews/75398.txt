The way this is written I would give it three and 1/2 stars, but could go four with my version.  I had pre-cooked shredded chicken that I mixed some honey mustard into, making it a little saucy. I put a little salt and pepper on top of the broccoli.  I think the way it is written it would be very bland.  I will make this again, experimenting with different cheeses as well.

This recipe actually was a bit bland for our taste. We didnt' have the correct bread though. Does that make the difference? Any suggestions?

It was a tad bland but we just added a bit of garlic salt on top and it was good.  Not the most fantastic dish in the world, but it is quick and easy.  Will make again.

The recipe was a tad bland with the foccacia bread. I think adding a little more sauce and doing with out the foccacia would make it excellent. Maybe pita bread instead?

I am not commenting on the original recipe, rather the way I made it after reading reviews.  This is what I did and it was really delicious!  
Make pulled ck in crockpot – season w salt, pepper, oregano, mustard, garlic powder – put in chk broth to cover bottom or so

-          When done and cool, add stone ground brown mustard and mayo to taste

Rosemary thyme baguette – bottom side brush w olive oil and pepper

Put on chicken, cooked broc, cheese – bake until melted

Spread mayo on top sides, top sandwiches, broil

I didn't have that type of bread, so I made it on French bread.  I also put mayo on the bread before and used left over rotisserie chicken as the chicken. Yum.

based on the reviews mentioning blandness I opted to pan fry the chicken with the mustard.  I added a good does of salt and pepper.  I made homemade focaccia- garlic Rosemary.  And assembled as stated but added a bit too f Dijon to the bottom slice. The sandwich was so dry and still bland.
