Very tasty and easy recipe to build on. Personally I like a lot of flavor so the first time I made this as written (using chipotle powder in the filling since it wasn't very clear on the ingredients list) and thought it was good, but could be better. The next time I added a half can of rinsed and drained black beans, a chipotle pepper in adobo (diced) that I had left over from something else and about a cup of shredded "Mexican blend" cheese into the filling.  It was to die for! I also got a few more flautas out of it that way, lol. Served it up with some yellow rice that I added a bit of diced red pepper, onion and jalape√±o to and a guacamole salad as well.  Don't get me wrong, the original recipe was tasty! It just needed a bit more pizzazz for me. Try it once by the book and then see what you think would make it suit you even better. Also, if you're not a fan of chipotle use regular chili powder instead.

These were really good!  I used at least 3 cups of shredded chicken (1.4 lbs) and added about 3 Tablespoons of shredded cheese in each flauta.  The chipotle seasoning on top added an interesting flavor.  Glad I found the recipe!

I made this recipe toddler friendly by shredding the chicken instead of leaving it in larger diced pieces, adding only 1/3-1/2 can of the cream of chicken soup, and substituting mild salsa for the canned green chilis. I didn't brush the flautas with oil before baking and they still came out crispy on the edges and soft in the middle- perfection.

This was good for putting in the fridge and having dinner on the go. I cooked chicken in a skillet with ground coriander, cumin and garlic. I put the cream of chicken soup, chicken, seasonings (eyeballed everything) and added cheese in a bowl and mixed it all together. I had larger flour tortillas so I eyeballed it and put enough mix to go down the length of the tortillas about an inch wide. The tortillas we used were pliable enough we didn't need to warm them to work with them. We placed them seam side down without using a toothpick, generously sprayed them with cooking spray and sprinkled with chipotle pepper. We baked it accordingly and then saved the remaining flautas for heated them up during the week for on the go food.

This is an awesome recipe - my only tweaks: All Organic!
I made flour tortillas from scratch, so I didn't need tooth pics. Didn't have coriander, but for the oil brush I used olive oil and tabasco chipotle - came out amazing!


P.S. DO NOT USE CANOLA OIL - IT'S AN INDUSTRIAL OIL

The recipe as written is very good.  It's easy to put together, and flavorful.  I made some minor changes to suit my and my family's taste, and for us, it became five stars.
