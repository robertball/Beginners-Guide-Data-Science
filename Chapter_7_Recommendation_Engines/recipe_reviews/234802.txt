Awesome beans!! Next time, I wanna try letting them simmer for a bit with a ham hock and add bacon, get that smokey goodness in there, too. But my family and I completely enjoyed them as the recipe was written. Nummy goodness!!

Yum! A favorite at the frenzy football game. All the flavors worked well together. All my guest thought the use of smoked sausage(turkey) was so much better then hot dogs.

Everyone loved this at our Memorial Day BBQ. It was a refreshing change from our other baked bean recipes. I did leave out the pork and used vegetarian beans, offering a completely meat-free side. Will definitely make this again!

Pretty good. I only had 8 oz of pineapple and that was enough for me.  The meat is a nice addition

This is delicious!  I used 1 can of chunk pineapple, put in my mini food chopper to make it finer---and added a dash of Chipotle Chili Powder---everyone loved it!
