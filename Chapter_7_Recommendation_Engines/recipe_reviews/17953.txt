I loved this recipe.  I have made it twice for my work and everybody raves at it.  They think I spent hours making it - but I didn't.  It's so easy.  I store it in the fridge and it tastes better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe.  I love it.  It's definitely one I will make again and again and again.

Versatile and quick. I used what I had on hand--cheesecake flavored pudding mix, fresh pineapple with a little brown sugar mixed in, and french vanilla cake mix using pineapple juice, Meyers dark rum, and a little coconut flavoring for the liquid. This is the kind of dessert that you will keep trying to "even up the edges" because you want to eat more ;-)

This is a great recipe that I've been making for several years.  Its a very refreshing summer dessert.  The only thing I do different is replace the water that the cake mix calls for with the pineapple juice that has been drained from the crushed pinapple.

I made this in a 9x13 pan.  It turned out good.  It was easy to make.  But I'll probably move on to trying other recipes and not make this again.

We enjoyed this cake tonight.  I didn't have a jelly roll pan so I used a 13x9.  After it cooled I cut it lengthwise and put the pudding/cream cheese mixture in the middle.  Then I put the pineapple on the pudding.  I replaced the top of the cake and frosted it with cool whip.  I added crushed pecans on top.  If it's better tomorrow as one reviewer said, I can't wait!

I've been making this cake for years. It is the perfect summer dessert with the pineapple and cool whip! Instead of the chopped nuts as a topping, I'll use coconut or chopped up cherries (which gives it that pineapple upside down cake feel).

I made this easy dessert for a dinner with my parents and inlaws. It was a big hit! The recipe is so easy (I usually "bake it from scratch"). I was a bit embarassed when my mom-in-law asked for the recipe (ha,ha). I used dream whip instead of cool whip, only because it was what I had on hand.

I used banana pudding instead of vanilla, and chopped walnuts sprinkled on top.  It was a hit!

I have made this cake with low fat ingredients and sugar free pudding using skim milk and it still comes out the same.. the only difference i have added are 1/8 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg to the pudding and cream chesse mixture. It gives it  a great flavor .

This really wasn't anything special. It just tasted like a yellow cake with a bunch of cool whip. The cake itself really needed something... maybe pineapple in the batter? I used pineapple juice instead of the water called for in the cake recipes, but it was still bland. I'd make again, but definitely with changes.
