Surprised by all the 5 star reviews.  This was ok...both my husband and I agree...good, but by no means great.  I won't make it again, but it was nice to try something this different.  My fav part was the cooked crescent rolls...the inside was fair.

Really good! I made a few changes though: my fiance doesn't like mushrooms so I nixed those, and Dillon's ran out of pecans so I used toasted almonds.

This recipe made it's way back to AZ! My family loved it. I used diced cooked chicken instead of canned. Hubby doesn't like pecans, so just rolled them in the bread crumbs. Also I used peas instead of the mushrooms, we'll use them next time! Added a tablespoon of milk to the mixture. Great and very filling recipe, thank you for sharing it!! It will be fun to try different veggies and spices in them next.

Yum! Kind of like a warm chicken salad. I doubled the recipe and used canned mushrooms instead of fresh, oh and also a splash of milk to the filling. Served with soup. It would be good with a salad too. I loved it, my husband just thought it was okay.

These were great, very flavorful and easy. This is a fabulous idea for making homemade hot pockets with any filling.

These are great! I got the same recipe from a woman at work and thought i'd give it a try...I don't like canned chicken so i just threw some chicken breasts in the crock pot and shredded them. I added a few tablespoons of milk to the mixture to make them a little creamier (the mix drys out a little once its baked inside). I also used reduced fat spread cream cheese and added a little garlic powder and onion powder because that what i had on hand, but next will try the chive and cream cheese! these are great, even my 3 year old loved them!

So good & they look great! I didn't have mushrooms or pecans - my family is not a huge fan. Instead of brushing on the butter & dipping the rolls in the bread crumbs I just mixed the butter & bread crumbs and put it on the rolls by hand. I was nervous how this would turn out. I really don't care for cream cheese, but I'm finding that I really like it paired up with other ingredients. Also, I added garlic powder to the cream mixture. We LOVE garlic.

These were VERY good, and my boyfriend loved them, too.  I doubled the recipe so that we would have leftovers, and used a little more chicken than the recipe called for.  Also, since the cream cheese came in 8 oz. tubs (and I needed 6 when doubling the recipe), I just dumped the whole tub in.  Unfortnuately, I didn't have pecans, but I just rolled them in the breadcrumbs and they were still quite tasty!

Looking for lunchbox ideas for the kids and this will be in rotation this school year. I left out the mushrooms since I didn't have them, but I think they'd add to the flavor of the sandwich. Pecans add a nice crunch. Very tasty!!

Fantastic! 
I'm surprised more people don't LOVE this! My hubby wants me to make up a bunch to keep in the freezer for when we need a quick lunch on the go, for this I would make my own bread of course... Loved the recipe and we will be having this quite often! :)

A nice, basic, customizable recipe. I sauteed the mushrooms with a little onion and garlic in some butter and a splash of white wine before adding them to the mixture. Really gave it a punch of flavor. I made a double batch and had them for lunch 4 days straight. Very handy if you're busy!

I made this and thought it was really good. I did not put pecans or mushrooms in it, but next time I think i will add a whole lot more vegetables in it.
