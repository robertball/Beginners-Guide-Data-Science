This is the best pancake recipe I have ever tried!  I think I have tried most of them on the internet in search of my mom and grandmother's recipes to no avail.  My fiancé and I agreed that, at best, the other's were good, but nothing special.  The oatmeal really adds something special to the recipe.  We didn't have raisins so I omitted them and topped them with apples sautéed in a pat of butter and just a bit of cinnamon (which I have done with other pancakes).  I halved the recipe and the two of us ate them all! YUM!  Don't wait until Christmas to try these easy delicious pancakes!  Will make again and again...they are definitely worth the wait!  Thanks so much for sharing! (:

My family loves oatmeal pancakes and this is a great recipe.  I use whole wheat flour and oil with good results.  These are more fragile than ordinary pancakes so oil your pan well and be careful when handling.

This was delicious!  I only let the oatmeal sit an hour, had no baking powder so I doubled the baking soda, and it was still yummy!  I'm sure it's even better following the recipe.

My husband and I both loved these great pancakes!  They tasted incredible and were perfect even without syrup. We made them on the weekend and froze the leftovers in between waxed paper to heat up in the toaster oven on busy weekday mornings.  This will be one of our "tried and true" breakfast treats.  J & L

MMMMM!!!! Good, I don't know how you could improve these, just a little more cinnamon is the only thing I did, yummy! Melt the butter before you add it, the recipe is supposed to say that, but it doesn't.

These were excellent, tasty pancakes. A bit heavy, but very filling. I used 2 T. vinegar with 2 c. of milk instead of buttermilk. Flatten them with a spatula when you put them in the frying pan or the center will be gooey.

I love making pancakes with "stuff" in 'em.  These were so yummy that the next day we ate them plain.  They taste like muffins.  

I doubled the batch, because when I make pancakes, I really make pancakes.  I used half buttermilk and half milk, increased the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon and the sugar to 5 tablespoons for the double batch (based on recommendations from other reviewers), used canola oil instead of butter, and added an extra slosh of milk to thin out the batter a bit after it had sat all night.  

Also, I didn't just soak the milk and the oatmeal overnight, I made up the entire recipe and put the the whole thing in the refrigerator.  It made the morning easier and also allowed not only the oatmeal to absorb the liquid and flavors, but also the raisins.  

I topped the pancakes with a little bit of agave sweetener.  Others in the family used syrup or yogurt.

These are wonderful!  The texture is so good -- they're somehow poofy, even though they are incredibly healthy.  (At least, compared to other pancakes...)  They're perfect for my one-year-old son, too.  We've had these two weekends in a row, both times skipping the raisins and adding different fruit (mixed berries, then banana slices + blueberries) to the batter on the skillet.  PERFECT.  Thanks for the great recipe.
UPDATE: I've made these almost every weekend for the last 7 months.  This recipe is a treasure.  I call them "magic pancakes," because a bunch of healthy ingredients magically turns into the most delicious pancakes we've tried!  I use either white-wheat flour or bread flour in place of the all-purpose, and it's terrific.  I also use ginger in place of cinnamon - with chopped bananas, surprisingly delicious.  Pancakes were a tradition for my husband when he was growing up, and I'm so glad to have a way to keep that tradition alive in our family without giving my toddler food I don't feel good about.  Seriously, if you use wheat flour, this isn't all that different from oatmeal with a pinch of sugar.  Yet, somehow, it tastes a million times better and more special.  What an ideal weekend treat.  Thanks again!

I made it more fat-friendly and substituted apple butter for the oil- subbed real maple syrup for added sugar, also had no baking powder or baking salt on hand and it came out fine!  Great served with sliced bananas and real maple syrup on top.

I doubled the raisins and would recommend that. I found I needed to add more butter milk to thin the mixture just prior to grilling. One could use whole wheat floor I expect to make them even more filling!

For those that love pancakes, this is a great recipe.  I tried them recently, and have prepared them several times since there.  I adjusted the recipe to my family's taste by doubling the amount of cinnamon and raisins in the original recipe.  It's also a great way to get children to eat oatmeal!

Loved them!! I'll be keeping this recipe close at hand! Instead of leaving the oatmeal mixture overnight, I mixed it and let it sit in the fridge for 20mins as suggested by another reviewer. Also, I substituted raisins for cranberries, and added walnuts. I doubled the cinnamon and made buttermilk with 2tbs lemon juice with 2cups milk. For an added touch, I sliced an apple and cooked it in a saucepan with some butter, and a few shakes of nutmeg and cinnamon, until it softened. This made a nice topping for the pancakes. I was happy my boyfriend loved it; he didn't like the texture when I chopped up Empire apples and incorporated it into the batter, but he liked it better as a topping. Very happy with this recipe. It'll be fun changing it up with bananas, coconut, and cherries!

So delicious! I did add some chia seeds, ground flax seeds, doubled the cinnamon, substituted honey for the sugar, and soaked at room temperature for over 12 hours. I look forward to using this recipe many times in the future.

These were amazing and quite unique!  I made them exactly as the recipe was written and they might be the best pancakes I've ever had.  My whole family loved them, which is saying a lot because my two children NEVER like the same things. We are keeping the leftovers in the fridge for tomorrow's breakfast and/or snacks.

Fairy good-- will try these again.  Next time I'll use oil instead of butter (it hardens when combined with refrigerated oatmeal  mixture).  Melting the butter might work too.  We tried it with Craisins.  Yummy!

GREAT!  Kids and hubby ate them up (so did I).  Only changes I made were not to soak the oatmeal overnight (20 min in the morning) and I used pancake mix instead of the flour and baking soda and baking powder.  Will make again soon!

These were rather different, and I agree with the person who said that it's more oatmeal than pancake.  You have to be ready for that.  They smell great while you cook them, but the actual flavor didn't live up to my expectations.  They were good, but there were leftovers--which means the kids didn't take to them.

Very filling! Used whole wheat flour and since I couldn't find any raisins I topped it with "sauteed apples" from this site. Delicious!

This recipe lives up to the reviews. I'm not a huge fan of oatmeal normally prepared, but I love oatmeal cookies and that's what it reminded me of. I added a tad more cinnamon and raisins. Great Christmas breakfast with corned beef hash!!

Delicious.  Wish my family loved these *sigh*. Made up the batter the night before: all but the baking powder & baking soda. Used sour milk, had no WW flour on hand. Left out the raisins, only dropping them into some of the pancakes, since a couple of the members of my family don't care much for raisins. MUST MAKE ON PREHEATED GRIDDLE to avoid sticking (so my husband learned). This whole approach worked very well, though I'm not sure if, when I doubled the recipe, that I doubled the flour (sorry, I'll try to watch more closely next time)? I would definitely say that these were *pancakes* and not biscuits or scones or anything). I decided to try putting in the baking powder and soda overnight next time, but not the first time. I doubled the batch for a family of five and had three pancakes left over. There are few recipes which result in my family not only leaving the table full, but *staying* full for a good long time.  However, my husband, who hates oatmeal, actually got a couple down, and that's saying something, but there's no way he'll ever even like this recipe.  My sons think that these are okay, but they prefer baked oatmeal (of course, it is so incredibly rich).  I'm keeping this recipe to make when my children need a 'staying power' breakfast (maybe in time they'd even come to love these pancakes that way), but also to make in small batches for myself and/or to make for any house guests we might have who happen to dearly love oatmeal as much as I myself do.

These were great! I added one small shredded granny smith apple and used apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon.
These cooked up nice and fluffy and went really well with maple sausage. There were no leftovers!

OUTSTANDING! BUT I added more buttermilk, a cup of Craisins and 1 1/2 t. cinnamon and agave nectar instead of sugar. Because of the oatmeal I think they are more like scones than pancakes but whatever they are called they are super! 5 stars with the changes.

A hearty pancake.  Very good and different.  I used rolled oats (that's what I had on hand).  Will definitely make again.  May add more cinnamon next time.

These are wonderful! I made them for my vegetarian boyfriend this morning and he loved them--so did I! Since I'm a diet-freak, I made a few changes though: used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, used fat free half & half instead of buttermilk (could probably try fat free milk, too), used Splenda instead of sugar, just the egg whites, used Promise fat free margerine instead of butter, increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp., and increased the raisins to 1 cup. They turned out incredible!! I will definitely be making this one again. I  had to add two more tablespoons of half & half, and made each pancake with 1/2 c. of batter. The bigger the better! Made about 8 pancakes that way. One should definitely give this recipe a shot.

AMAZING!  I made the 5 serving version and it made 8 pancakes.  I did soak overnight, but didn't have time for the final 20 minute rest.......it was still great.  I have made other oatmeal pancake recipes that are dry.....this is so moist.  Worth the efforts.

Very good healthy recipe.  Instead of buttermilk, I had 4 cups sour milk that I needed to use.  So, I doubled the recipe.  I used whole wheat flour and also first boiled the raisins in about a 1/3 cup water to pre-plumb.  I reserved the liquid in case I needed something to thin the batter (I didn't).  Instead, I heated up some fresh strawberries in the raisin "broth" for a yummy topping.   I'll freeze the rest for a healthy and quick toaster-breakfast for busy mornings.

My boyfriend asked me to make oatmeal pancakes i found this one made them and he loved them!!! Better than expected!!! I did add a little more cinnamon than called for and also 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I did exchange the raisins for dried cranberries. Turned out awesome! He asked for more after he ate half the batch.

So good!  Definitely double the raisins.  Dried cranberries or cherries are also an excellent subsititute for the raisins.

Good pancakes! I used whole wheat flour in place of the AP flour, clabbered soymilk (4t. of distilled white vinegar with soymilk added to 2 cup line) for the buttermilk, omitted the salt and pulsed 2c. of rolled oats in the food processor a couple of times since I had no quick cooking oats. Everyone liked them however one family member does prefer the Oatmeal and Wheat Flour Blueberry pancakes which despite having fewer oats in it has a better oat taste and texture since not soaked overnight. Made 15 (1/4c.) pancakes.

My kids LOVED these pancakes. I'm not a pancake person, but I really liked these. As suggested I doubled the cinnamon and added some vanilla. To make them really special I carmelized some sliced bananas, put them between two pancakes, drizzeled with caramel syrup and topped with a little whipcream. Definitely a keeper.

Have made this recipe many times and love it. Only difference is, I make waffles instead of pancakes. Don't usually add raisins but I am sure they would work for waffles too.........Sue

Really good pancakes. DH and I made them for overnight company and they went over really well. I'm giving it only four stars because I used regular milk and omitted the raisins (I don't like them). I also used 3/4 tsp cinnamon and about a 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg. With these changes, for us, its definitley five stars :o) We're thinking of using dried cranberries in the raisins' stead and adding pecans or walnuts. We were also thinking of using chopped dried apples and letting them soak with the oatmeal.

Awesome!  Chilled the quick oats/buttermilk overnight, but skipped the 20 minute soak.  Added buttermilk cuz the batter looked thick, but then had to add flour cuz they fell apart in the pan (watch that you don't add too much buttermilk!).  After I got the batter right, they were absolutely delectable, tender, and delicious (wish author could have been more specific about the ingredient amounts). I doubled the sugar (used brown) and added some vanilla.  Used veg oil instead of butter and seemed to work fine.  You'll love these!

THE BEST OATMEAL PANCAKES I EVER TASTED. THE ONLY THINGS I DID DIFFERENT WAS NOT ADD RAISINS OR SUGAR. I ALSO HALVED THE RECIPE BUT FORGOT TO HALVE THE BAKING POWDER AND BAKING SODA. THE PANCAKES WERE NICE AND FLUFFY AND GREAT ON THEIR OWN. NEEDED NO SYRUP OR ANYTHING. I EVEN ATE ONE WITH A VEGETABLE SALAD.

I have been making this recipe for a year now.  My son and his hockey, baseball, football (depending on the season) team mates request them at least once a month on game day.  These are hungry 17 & 18 year old boys and they rave about them.  In fact they have taken to calling them "deb cakes" (sorry Cindy).  
I love this recipe.  
As with any recipe it is up to each individual to enhance to their own needs.  Extra buttermilk is the only change I have made to this recipe.
I serve with homemade syrup.

Well, I cannot stand raisens so I left them out, besides that I followed the recipe and they were super-duper tasty. I think that diced apples would be a great addition next time i make them. they were fluffy, delectable and filling. Will become a regular meal in my house for sure.

Loved the taste. Used almond milk rather than buttermilk & whole wheat pastry flour rather than all-purpose. Left out the white sugar, cinnamon, & raisins, and made both berry pancakes & toasted coconut/banana pancakes. Y.u.m.m.m.m.

I loved these! I did double the cinnamon and raisins. Even a little more cinnamon would have made them even better. My children tend to like just plain pancakes and liked these, but didn't ask for seconds or ask me to make these again. I even enjoyed these cold with a little peanut butter on the next morning.

I make this recipe every Saturday morning.  I found buttermilk to be too thick so I use 2 cups milk and 2 tablespoons lemon juice.  I let the oats soak for approx. 20 minutes while I mix the remaining ingredients.  I use brown sugar for added flavor and I melt the butter.  I chop 1/3 cup cranberry raisans and 1/2 cup walnuts instead of the raisans.  Perfect every time.  Thank you Cindy for a wonderful recipe!

Yum!  These pancakes were very good and healthy too with only a half cup of flour and just a touch of sugar.  I used whole wheat flour, organic sugar and regular oats (just what I had on hand).  I also separated the eggs and beat the egg whites and folded them gently back in at the end before the 20 minute wait to make them extra fluffy.  My two and four year old boys and hubby gobbled them up with applesauce and cinnamon on top, I liked them plain with a little maple syrup.  Thanks for this recipe, we will definetly be making these again, as my boys love their pancakes!

Great way to use up buttermilk. I used reg old fashioned oats, no problems. Adding a tiny bit of water to thin out the batter helps. So good & much more filling than box mix pancakes.

I've been using this recipe -minus raisins- for at least 20 years and it is the only pancake that I like. I originally found it in The American Country Inns Bed and Breakfast cookbook. Obviously it's a keeper.

SOOO Great! I subbed whole wheat pastry flour in and doubled the cinnamon and these were just fab. Not too heavy, but hearty and delish! Will be making again!

These pancakes are very delicious even though I did not refrigerate overnight.  I let the oatmeal and buttermilk sit in the fridge about 30 min then went on to step 2.  I did every thing else according to directions.  I will make these again for sure.  Next time I will definitely increase the amount of raisins and/or add some mashed bananas.

Ridiculously delicious!! The only "change" was to add lots more cinnamon. I did do some substitutions because I didn't have some ingredients on hand- regular milk with lemon juice (for buttermilk), oil (for butter) and crasins (for raisins). As some other reviewers mentioned, I only put the oats and milk in the fridge for about 20 minutes.  I also did half a batch.
These are so light and fluffy!! My toddler also loved them! I plan to make a full batch next time and freeze them for a quick, healthy weekday breakfast. I'm also thinking of some flavor variations...

My family loves these.  I discovered (totally by accident) that they are just as good without the butter.  My son puts the leftovers in the toaster.  Great with cooked apples on top.

Great pancakes, I used milk and lemon juice for butter milk, only half of the butter, and five raisins per pancake. Definitely needed more raisins!

Surprisingly good, very healthy. I halved the recipe. Next time I will adjust the taste and add a few other healthy ingredients like flax meal, currants, etc... It's a keeper. Reason for 4 stars, recipe is a little off in taste and could be made differently.

Delicious, I would make this recipe again.  The pancakes have an unexpected nutty flavor and a nice texture.
I did use old fashioned oats because it is what I had in the pantry.

Some tricky one out there pulled this recipe out of hibernation, judging by the dates of the most recent reviews, but boy, I am glad they did!  I have had a gnawing craving for pancakes for a few months, but in the mornings,they're just too heavy for me.  No one in my house (besides me!) ever wanted "breakfast for dinner," so my craving lurked.  This morning, I stumbled upon this recipe and my daughter agreed that they sounded great.  I halved the recipe and made it just like the recipe says and they were soooooo delicioso.  I appreciate the ideas people had.  I just warmed the maple syrup and threw some cut up peach, cherries, and blueberries over them...I could've eaten them all; really, I had to stop myself.  My daughter hasn't had hers yet because she is working out, and they are in the oven at 175 staying nice and warm.  Will definitely make over and mover.

This recipe was a hit. 
I changed the serving size and used whole wheat flour. They were filling without being heavy.
We added our family maple syrup with a side of turkey sausage and  they were killer!  Will definitely be making these again.

We have been making Oatmeal Pancakes for years. Almost the same recipe. We only soak the oatmeal in the buttermilk for 5 - 10 minutes. We do not add any butter or oil to the batter, only one teaspoon of sugar, no baking powder and also no raisins. Less fat and less sugar. Diabetic friendly recipe. Sometimes we will add blueberries or cinnamon to the mix. When our girls were little they would ask for chocolate chips. Everyone we have ever made these for love them and our grandkid's call them Bumpa's Pancakes.

My family loved these tasty pancakes. We didn't think they tasted like cooked oatmeal at all. They were so much better. I added chocolate chips to them, but wished that I hadn't. They would have been perfect without them!

Great recipe!  I used 1/2 and 1/2 with a little vinegar in it in place of the buttermilk, and the pancakes turned out great.  The leftover pancakes were so good put in the toaster the next morning!

I thought these were really good, although a little too rich & heavy to have on a regular basis.  My husband and kids were less than enthused about them, so I likely won't be making them again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Very tasty pancakes.  I used egg substitute, light butter, and it turned out great.  Had to add a smidge of skim milk to get the desired consistency of batter.  These went over really well.

These didn't really taste much like pancakes. They were more like a cooked form of oatmeal, but they were still good...just not what I expected. I had some major difficulties flipping them which usually isn't a problem for me. I found that I did need to add more buttermilk than the recipe called for in order to get the right consistancy. I think that I would acc more cinnamon if I made these again, and maybe more flour and less oatmeal...
