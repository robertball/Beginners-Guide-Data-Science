Since I am a native Japanese person, I would like to add some points to this recipe. 

Some chicken - diced and cooked.
Eggs - need to be 3/4 done - has to have some running juice.  When you cover it, please try to cover the runny side facing to the rice.  
Green Pepper - nice addition

My kids love this dish!!  I think this is one of Japanese kids favorite dishes in decades.

Having lived in Japan for a year with Japanese families, I was subjected to eat Ohm Rice at least once a week. After all it is a quick easy meal for Japanese parents, and kids love the mix of rice, eggs, and ketchup. Unfortunatly I lost the recipe when I returned to the US of A, so I was quite excited to find this recipe. I followed this recipe exactly as it is given, and was pleased to taste the same Japanese dish I had remembered. It really is a pleasant mix of tastes, incredibly simple, and perfectly portioned. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

It was ok but 1 cup of ketchup was waaaay to much ketchup for this family! If I try it again I would cut the ketchup in half.

When I lived in China I would hunt for restaurants that carried this type of "rice omelet."  The first time I ordered it and it arrived covered in ketchup, I was shocked; however, after eating it, I was a believer.  I didn't have fresh carrots on hand so I thawed a package of frozen mixed vegetables (I put a serving in a colander and ran warm water over them before adding them to the skillet) and it tasted just fine.  I will definitely make this again.

I didn't expect to like this but I did!! You have to like ketchup to enjoy this recipe because it is the main flavor. I can't wait for my oldest son to try this because he loves Japanese cooking and culture. The only thing I did differently is to fry the vegetables in a mix of smart balance vegetable oil and butter instead of just butter.

A little too much ketchup, even for my "must have ketchup with everything" kids.  If I make it again, I will use half the amount of ketchup.

I wasn't expecting to find an omuraisu recipe here.  I've never been to Japan, but I decided to try my hand at making this after observing this dish several times in anime and an webisode of cooking with dog.  How I've read it is that it is one of those western dishes that morphed into a more Japanese favorite, kind of like how Ramune was actually inspired from Lemonade in the beginning.  Omuraisu supposedly stands for omulet rice.  I don't usually use specific measurements, but this recipe couldn't hurt.  I've always cooked the rice with oil, but it should be good with butter.

It only has two stars because of the amount of ketchup used. If you look up other omurice recipes, they don't use that much ketchup, just enough for some color in the rice and with that "zigzag" garnish on top.

Omu rice needs approx. 2 tablespoons ketchup.  1 cup ketchup is overkill.

It's actually called Omu Rice, short for "Omuleto" rice (the Japanese way of saying Omelet) It's basically egg omelet with fried rice and one of my fave japanese dishes. I used cooked rice left overnight in the fridge instead of freshly cooked rice because the rice wouldn't be soggy and will have more texture. (basically the secret to good fried rice, use overnight leftovers!) I'm personally not a fan of carrots, so i substituted that for some ham and didn't add butter a second time.

A good basic recipe.  I have made Ome Rice several times, and had it served in a few restaurants in Japan.  It is really a leftover type dish.  Some ideas to try: Use grated carrot and onion for quicker fry time; add small amount soy sauce with ketchup; use cold rice, warm up in pan with vegetables; try other vegies such as frozen peas, snow peas, cut green beans, green pepper diced. Add other cooked meats such as ground beef, chicken bits, pork roast bits, cooked shrimp.

We are a host family for young Japanese students. When I found this recipe, I thought I would surprise them & make it for them. They LOVED it! Kept "yummmmm, yummmmm..." all through dinner. They said it tasted just like the Ohm Rice their mothers make at home.  However, no one in my family liked it at all! My 6-yr old grandson (who usually loves ketchup!) said it tasted "Yucky!" & that he didn't like ketchup on his rice. My husband dutifully ate a few bites, then made himself a sandwich after dinner was over. I didn't like it, either. I normally like ketchup, but it was just too much for me. Our students enthusiastically packed up some to take for lunch & share with their friends.  Not really sure how to rate this recipe. It was a toss up at our house.

I first had omelet rice in Sasabo Japan in 1965 during a visit with the US Navy. A chef from Hong Kong prepared it for me. Much simpler than this recipe. Plain white rice was used. The omelet was two simply whipped eggs, fried on a flat top grill. The rice was put on top o the egg as a log. The egg was then wrapped around the rice. A line of ketchup was put on top of the roll and served on a small plate. I still make this for myself several times a year and love the simple creation while enjoying the complex flavors brought together.

This was so bad it was funny. My husband said (while fixing the kids something else) it was the worst thing I have cooked in five years of marriage. My kids would only eat the egg. I guess the simplicity of the recipe drew me in but thinking back...ketchup with rice.... I should have seen this coming. Going to stick with recipes with hundreds of good reviews for next time.

I used half the ketchup per other user’s suggestions, and it was plenty. I added a little seasoning salt to the rice mixture, but it was still a little bland. It wasn’t a bad dish, but I probably won’t make it again.

I ended up having to change the recipe simply based on what I had in my kitchen (no regular onion, and not a full cup of ketchup). I subbed a small handful of green onions instead and just used what ketchup I had (maybe 1/2 a cup). It turned out pretty great, and I think more ketchup would have been way too much, especially for someone who isn't that big a fan of ketchup). I also ended up topping the omelette with spicy mayo instead of more ketchup (I tend to out spicy mayo on everything), and some more green onions. Even my very picky boyfriend enjoyed it, so this will be a repeat.

Following the recipe exactly yields a delicious breakfast treat. I will admit to being a somewhat of a ketchup addict since my youth, but I didn't feel there was too much ketchup at all. In fact, it adds a subtle fruity flavor throughout the dish.

I actually make this recipe quite often now. I really love all the flavors, and it is simple to make. I make it when I have leftover rice from the night before. I don't go by exact measurments, so I make it perfectly to my liking when it comes to the ketchup and butter. Yummmm...

Loved it. I have sought this recipe for years after eating it in Okinawa. They included what I suspect was tripe in a small amount. It was delicious

I followed the suggestions made about cutting the ketchup amount. I used half a cup of ketchup instead of a whole cup, because that seemed a bit much, I subbed peas for the carrots and scallions for the regular onion, I used 1 1/2 cups of rice to 2 cups of water becausel I followed the instructions on the brand of Asian rice I had. The final result was excellent. My family and I really enjoyed this breakfast. It was a fun change to our usual breakfasts.

To really kick up this meal, or any rice dish, use Jasmin Rice. The aroma while cooking and the taste are 9 levels above any basic rice.

Served this to a very picky husband, who loves it...even asked if I would freeze some for snacks.  I grated the carrots and onions which turned out really well. This is definitely a 'keeper' :)

Made this as written except for the amount of ketchup...just put the bottle on the table and we added to taste. It was a quick, tasty breakfast! I can see that by adding chicken it could be a nice, quick dinner also! Thanks for sharing.
