The chicken in this recipe was sooo tender and delicious. I substituted the parm with cheddar cheese, and the cream of broccoli with cream of mushroom. I also didn't use mushrooms because I didn't have any. It was aaaammmmaazzzinnng though. The directions were a little funky so I put the breading on top of the chicken, the sauce of top of that and then grated some cheese on top. Perfecto with some rice and a side veggie!

Really great. Par boiled a small head of fresh broccoli and added that to cream of mushroom soup instead of using the soup and mushrooms that were listed.  Then used the water from the  broccoli to cook rice in which was served with the chicken.  The chicken was so tender it could be cut with a fork. This was so easy, plan on serving it for a group of 40.

Instead of using cream of broccoli soup I used broccoli cheddar condensed soup and it was AMAZINGGG. Great recipe, and with all the review it looks as if you can use just about any campbell's cream of ____ soup.

I was running out of groceries, and I had almost everything I needed to make this, so I thought I'd give it a try. I didn't have any mushrooms or the condensed soup it called for, so I substituted an can of cream of mushroom. I also heavily seasoned the soup mixture before I poured it in the pan.  It turned out great, the chicken was cooked perfectly. I've already had requests to make it again!

I took the advice of a few other reviews and tried it with cream of mushroom and cheddar.  I substituted garlic powder with garlic salt and split this recipe in half for 2.

delicious!!  very easy and the chicken comes out tender with the sauce adding flavor.  i doubled the sauce, using two cans of cream of mushroom.  i also boiled a head of fresh broccoli and added that to the bake.  i also added fresh thyme from the garden! i'm sure just about any herb would be great.  i served with steamed green beans and rice.  i will definitely make this again!!

Was an excellent recipe!  The first time I tried it, the middle chicken breast didn't quite cook all the way through, so the next time I cooked them, I still baked at 400 degrees but cooked for an hour instead of 30 minutes.  The chicken breasts I used were slightly thick, so this could be why.  If it would have been thinner, it probably would have been fine.  Excellent choice though for a fairly quick meal with lots of flavor.

This recipe was great,the chicken turned out very tender. I did not use the broccoli soup,instead I used cream of mushroom and added fresh broccoli-I was pleased :) I had some homemade salad croutons and I crumbled them on top in place of the plain bread crumbs. I did use the parm cheese, but I had a small hunk of gruyere cheese left over from another recipe and I used that as well. This was a very rich and hearty meal!

So good but did change a little just for my family's taste. Used cream of chicken soup and added a scoop of sour cream to the sauce.  Also seasoned the chicken before putting in the dish.  Really good-served over egg noodles-may add another can of soup next time just for more sauce.

This was wonderfully easy. I used a can of Condensed Cheddar Cheese instead of broccoli and I didn't have any bread crumbs so I smashed up some cruttons and used those (basically the same thing right). I grated my parm cheese in big peices and used more than a half a cup. I served the chicken with rice and drissled the creamy sauce over the rice.

Tasty and easy recipe.  Only used two chicken breasts and smaller cooking dish.  Seasoned the soup for my personal tastes, omitted mushrooms and used 1 cup of frozen broccoli to mix with the soup.  Used panko bread crumbs.  Turned out great, and looking forward to leftovers tomorrow (single gal).  Next time will increase broccoli used for all that tasty sauce.  Will be awesome with a baked potato....

This chicken was so simple and quick to prepare! I used Campbell's Broccoli Cheese Soup because it's what I had. The only changes I made were to add more garlic (personal preference) and I used fresh mushrooms instead of jarred. Served with green beans. I'll make it again.

This was fairly easy to fix for a beginner cook.  It didn't turn out at all like the picture though and cleanup was a bit messy.  But I will make this again because it is a great basic way to fix chicken and can fit into our meal rotation.

I used cream of chicken soup and then just chopped up some fresh broccoli to put in the soup mix. I did mistakenly use garlic salt instead of garlic powder which put the dish on the salty side, but my fiance still loved it.

My husband loved the way I made this recipe.  As noted by previous reviewers, I breaded and cooked the chicken separately.  For the sauce, I added a can of condensed cheese soup to the brocoli and cheese soup.  Additionally, I added a cooked bag of frozen brocoli.  It was great and a quick meal (Bonus Points)!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is great! One of the few easy recipes that's great as-is, though I had to modify slightly since I didn't have everything. I made it with cream of mushroom and didn't add mushrooms since I had none. The crumbs were really delicious and next time I might make slightly  more.

I made this recipe and OMG!What a delicious meal.I used garlic cloves instead of powder.The extra few minutes it took to dice up the garlic was worth it.I also used mozzarella cheese.I cooked it in a smaller casserole dish.This will be one of my regular dishes.

I never have broccoli soup on hand, and my husband hates mushrooms. BUT...the recipe sounded really good to me, so I skipped the mushrooms and substitued a can of mushroom soup....both problems solved. Served it with biscuits and veggies, (we put the sauce over the biscuits!) Making it for the second time tonight. :)

Very tasty recipe! My husband and daughter really enjoyed it and ate it all up. I did as some other reviewers said and used cheddar broccoli soup instead of the regular cream of broccoli soup. I also used fresh mushrooms instead of jarred ones, and I used about a teaspoon of fresh minced garlic in place of garlic powder in the seasoning. I pre-seasoned my meat to give it more flavor and it came out VERY nicely! My only complaint is that it should utilize a bit more of the soup base. It wasn't easy to get much soup on the chicken. All else was excellent however and I will be making this recipe again!

I made this exactly as the recipe states EXCEPT I didn't have cream of broccoli. Used mushroom instead. The whole family loved it! Nice twist to plain canned soup over chicken.
