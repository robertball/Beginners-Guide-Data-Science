I made this as directed, egg yolk and all, and it is just a beautiful frosting! I, of course, had to adjust the measurements of the juices a bit to get the frosting to the perfect consistency (no recipe for frosting can be precise, so should not be criticized if more or less powdered sugar or liquid needs to be added). This is a light, fluffy, citrus frosting that was the perfect choice to frost Rainbow Citrus Cake, also from this site.

This was easy and tasty.  As I do with all frosting recipes, I doubled it.  I omitted the egg yolk and added in addition to the juice some orange flavored liquor.  This has a nice subtle flavor.  I will definately make this again.

Awesome!!!  Since I was not making this for my family, I did not use the egg yolk.  I am not sure of the purpose of the yolk - I have never made a frosting that called for one.  I also only used 3 cups of sugar and with the lack of the the moisture from the yolk, I ended up adding in more lemon and orange juice.  It was perfect for piping on my mini cupcakes.

This frosting tasted great, hardened on the outside, and kept soft on the inside.  However... it was EXTREMELY unpleasant to make and work with.  It was very stiff and we had to add a lot of liquid to make it workable.

Like most I had to double the recipe. I added more orange zest and juice too to give it more flavor. Also, this was WAY too sweet for my taste. I used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar instead of 4.

Quite tasty, although I recommend doubling the recipe.  I did and needed it all to frost a 2-layer 9" cake.  Use fresh zest because it really adds great flavour.  I also added it splash of orange extract.

Very nice recipe with a lovely flavor. I had to add just a touch of milk as it was just a little too thick to spread. Otherwise, a great icing recipe.

I used all orange juice and orange oil and left out the egg yolk.  Not wanting to use it.  This tastes heavenly on spice cake.

Nice frosting!  This is very much what you make of it.  Do you want something really stiff?  Put in lots of sugar and less juice.  Do you want something more liquidy?  More juice, less sugar. 

To do this, I got the butter/zest/salt base down (omitted the yolk, like other reviewers said), then took turns adding a cup of sugar and a few teaspoons of juice.  This let me bulk up in volume while keeping a good consistency, and when it came time to spread it on the cake, I got it as stiff/liquidy as I wanted.  I loved being able to control it like that.

I pretty much doubled the recipe.  That got me more than enough icing for a three-layer 9-inch round cake.

This frosting was so easy to spread! Great consistency and filled in all the gaps on the cake. I think the yolk made the difference in texture.

This was a great very sweet icing. It did take much more orange juice to get the consistency I was looking for. I also opted out of the lemon as i was worried it would make it too sour. -CW

This frosting, made as directed, turned out great, but only after I made changes to it. With that much powdered sugar with how little liquid went into it, it was far too thick. I had to add more juice and a splash of milk for it to turn out right.
