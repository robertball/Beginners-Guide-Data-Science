I didn't have all the veg the recipe listed so I just used up what I had and made the sauce. I spiced it up with dried chilli pepper flakes - not bad for a thursday night!

Submitter offers wide latitude with his recipe, so I took it.  I used a variety of vegetables to use what I had in the fridge - bell peppers, yellow squash, bok choy, green beans, broccoli, mushrooms and onions.  Skipped the optional serrano peppers, ginger and cilantro.  I used the oyster sauce but not the fish sauce, only because I didn't have it to use.  The toasted sesame seeds and sliced green onions were a nice finish.  Wok not necessary - a skillet will do! This vegetable dish is delicious of course - but I do kind of question all the ingredients listed as optional.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but it was useful as a basic guide. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powdered.  I used the fish sauce, but not the oyster sauce. I used up other veggies in the fridge including broccoli and green beans.  I served it with Tempeh that I marinated in soy sauce and fried in olive oil. I love that this is filling and delicious without the serving rice or noodles.

The fish sauce and oyster sauce are not necessary for the success of the dish. I am vegetarian and never use either. soy sauce is a good substitute. or if you like the taste sweet chili sauce.

Excellent recipe.  We added a bit more spice because we like it hot, and it was very flavorful.  Thanks for sharing!

I was being adventurous trying fish sauce and oyster sauce for the first time...I must not have the palate for it. The vegetable combination was great prior to adding the sauces...I will have to try again with a different brand of fish sauce and oyster sauce...maybe I got a bad batch...I had never had bok choy before either...it is great! :)

To me the oyster sauce gave it too much of an earthy or fishy taste. Didn’t use fish sauce since I couldn’t find around here. Used stir fry sauce instead. Generally very good. Will try again without oyster sauce.

I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powdered as one of the other reviewers suggested. Also used what I had on hand for vegetables. Turned out really good but I think the fresh ginger will make it even better.
