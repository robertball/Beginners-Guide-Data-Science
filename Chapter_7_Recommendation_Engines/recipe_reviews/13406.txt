This was very nice and very similar to the chilled strawberry soup in taste. I used dark sweet cherries (only kind that the store had) and added a bit more sugar during the boiling stage. Also instead of folding in the whole cherries after the sour cream, I poured everything into a food processor and pureed it all. Added a little heavy whipping cream to make it a bit smoother. Would make it again.

I have a recipe that is similar to this one - it is a hungarian soup.  In ours there is no lemon juice and less sugar and we bundle whole cloves in and let it simmer as the cherries cook.  Yum!

The recipie is ok with a couple of small changes. My German Grandmother used to make Cold Cherry Soup, but we ate it with Farina/Semolina pudding or vanilla sauce not sour cream. This recipie can also be made with fresh cherries instead of canned. Just omit the cornstarch add more water up to the level of the cherries in the pot, more sugar to taste and zest from the lemon as well as juice from one lemon.

I would make this again, but watch out for too much lemon juice.  Doubled the recipe, but found that 1/4 cup made the soup way too tart! Also added a cinnamon stick to the boiling mixture.

The soup turned out pretty good, though it's much more like a yogurt. I took some of the other reviewer's advice and used twice the sugar and half the sour cream and also put the cherries through the food processor. Would be good alongside crepes for a 'fancy' breakfast.

The sour cream is just enough zing to keep the sweet in check

As another reviewer said, this recipe tastes way to much like sour cream.  I also added about another tablespoon and a half of sugar.  I followed the recipe exact except I put my cherries through the food processor for a couple pulses since they were quite large.  I went to a B&B a couple years ago that served a cold cherry soup for breakfst and I've never tried to make it myself.  I was hoping this would be something similar. I know the soup I had the B&B owner used fresh sweet cherries.  I'll chalk this one up and try again.

I have never tried a cold fruit soup before, but now I am glad I did.  The taste was excellent, but next time I think I will chop the cherries in halves or quarters because mine were rather big.  Will keep this on hand for company.

My boyfirend is Hungarian and wanted something like his mother used to make-- it's almost right.  I used cherry pie filling, I think it should just be canned cherries in juice.  I'll try it again.

i followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted wayyyyy too much like sour cream... adding more sugar helped some, but it still was not as good as other fruit soup recipes on here. i will not make this again.

My husband had a cold cherry soup on a cruise we went on and loved it. He's been begging me to make it for him so I tried this recipe today. I used fresh sweet cherries (they are in season and we don't like tart cherries) I ended up using about 2 cups of pitted cherries and cooked them with just enough water to cover them with no cornstarch like amy suggested. I also added a stick of cinnamon when I was boiling and a dash of chopped cloves. Cooked it for about 15 minutes on the stove (took out the cinnamon stick) and then pureed it with 1/2 a cup of sour cream 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1 1/2 tbls sugar. Its not a thick soup this way but it tastes fantastic! Next time I try it I might add the cornstarch just to thicken it up a bit but I think my husband is going to love it too!

Disappointing. Tasted like cherry yogourt. Will not make it again.
