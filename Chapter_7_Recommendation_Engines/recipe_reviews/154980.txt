The taste of the blue cheese in the meat tastes very good.  However it was difficult to put the cheese in the center without the patty falling apart. I changed the recipe a bit in hopes of improving the taste.  I added an egg to make the meat stick together better, also finely chopped half a medium onion, minced 4 cloves of garlic, some oregano, garlic powder, smoked paprika, pinch of sugar, chili powder, sage, and ground basil.  I reduced the amount of salt since the blue cheese (I thought) was enough flavor. I think the more blue cheese you can get in it the better, just a problem of trying to keep the patty together, I had really squeeze it tightly.  I am considering in just mixing the cheese in next time instead of trying to put it in the center.

I just made my first buffalo burger. I read the review that warned about the burger falling apart. I stuffed about 2 Tbs. of blue cheese crumbles into a fairly large ball of meat, pushing the meat around the cheese. I wanted my burger to be fairly large. To avoid the burger falling apart, I didn't turn it over until the first side was nicely browned and somewhat stiffened. I was careful not to press the top of the burger while it was cooking, as I wanted to keep it juicy, and not  dried out.  Once I cooked the second side until it was well-done on the outside and felt firm around the edges, I was able to flip it over one more time to finish cooking. The burger remained in one piece.  I sprinkled Mesquite flavoring, garlic powder, and freshly ground pepper onto the burger while it was cooking. The cheese was salty, so the burger did not require any additional salt. I served it on a toasted bun with mustard and ketchup, and topped it with sauteed onion rings.  It was the best burger I have ever made! It was totally cooked, but was very moist and flavorful.

This was very yummy. Made some modifications to suit my taste; I used one package of ground bison  and about a half cup of blue cheese (we're cheese lovers),  added Montreal steak seasoning (about a Tbsp), and mixed in 1 egg to help it all stick together. I mixed the cheese in with everything instead of stuffing it in the middle, mostly just for convenience. 

I made small pattys, bar burger size, and pan cooked them. Took about 5 minutes on each side to cook med-well. They came out delicious! Didn't have any trouble with them falling apart. We didn't have buns and ate them without any toppings. These were so flavorful and juicy that we didn't really need them. Even my 15 month old son gobbled one up. We will definitely be making these again!

Pretty good burgers. I just mixed the blue cheese in rather than stuffing it into the middle, purely because I didn't read the recipe carefully enough. It worked quite well, though I didn't taste the cheese very strongly; perhaps it *would* be better to have it all gathered in the middle together, for greater flavor impact. Otherwise, this was a very simple and quick way to fix burgers, so though I've had burgers with more interesting flavor, I appreciated the ease of preparation! Thanks for the recipe, Jenn!

Excellent!  We love the blue cheese. It kind of "softens" the macho flavor of the buffalo.  Personally, I could add even more blue cheese.  The grilled red onions were a nice touch.

What a great way to add some moisture to the sometimes dry ground bison!  Yum!

We loved the burger's. I did something different as usual... I ground the meat myself and added un-cooked baccon during the grinding process. Also we picked our own cheeses for the burger's. They were awesome.
