I changed the recipe quite bit. I sauteed the vegetables and whisked the eggs in bowl separately. Put a layer of egg, vegetables and cheese and then repeated the layer for a second time. Had the oven preheated at 350 and once heated cooked frittata for 30 minutes. Turned out perfectly!

It's sort off tough to know when it's done because of the veggie content but otherwise it's pretty simple.

Delicious! I modified by adding fresh dill and cilantro.  Also just salt,pepper and some shredded spicy cheese.  Made in a cast iron skillet on stove and baked in oven at 375 for 5 mins then 2 mins under broiler to brown. Turned out perfect!

Really easy.  First frittata ever, so easy is good.  Used red onions & red peppers as that's what I had. Added frozen breakfast sausage too as I like that extra bit of salty flavor (and meat). Mostly cooked stove top then did 5min in the oven at 375 (had been on already and don't like broiling so just used to get more fully cooked and not burn the bottom).
