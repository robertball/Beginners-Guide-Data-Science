This was the first time I created a Glaze for a cake. The taste was okay, but I found it difficult to manage on my cake, as a beginer. I definetly would try it out again but not for an occasion (or at least not until I master how to correctly use the glaze). My cake looked very "homemade" with my sugar glaze.

This recipe is ... alright.  I found it, and was so excited.  I found for like a light dusting on a cake, or even apple fritters, or something like that, it was awesome!  But when you use it as an actual "glaze" ... splenda is really good at mimicing sugar, but in this case it has an aftertaste.  You can TELL it's not sugar, and that disapointed me.  I have found though if you use half this, and half real icing sugar, you don't really notice.  It would be nice not to use any icing sugar, but using only half is better then ONLY icing sugar.  Just my opinion ...

I haven't tried the glaze yet, my rating is purely based on making your own "powerdered sugar"...from Splenda.

I used this in the cream cheese frosting for the pumpkin cake..and I gotta tell you, I was delighted and amazed!
 
It's perfect!

I found this recipe all right.  I used it to ice some holiday cookies.  I found that the glaze hardenes and keeps a very high shine (which I liked).  The taste, left a bit to be desired.  I would recommend using almond extract rather than vanilla.
