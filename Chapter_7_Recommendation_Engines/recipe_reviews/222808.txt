This was very tasty, but I have to admit that I don't like frying foods if I can avoid it and I opted to oven roast the potatoes instead.  I combined the spices  with about 1/3 cup of olive oil and tossed the cubed potatoes in the mixture.  I spread them on a baking sheet with sides and baked them for 40 minutes in a 400 degree oven. Stir the potatoes halfway through roasting and add the cilantro during the last 10 minutes.  They taste great and use a lot less oil plus no messy stovetop!

WOW what a wonderful dish.  Full of great flavour.  As a suggestion when cooking this wonderful dish make sure the fan on the stove is turned on as the smell of the spices will permeate through the whole house.  And make sure that the tatters are evenly diced as well as some may take longer to cook.  Thank you Patricia for this wonderful dish will be making again.

Nice recipe, but , as another reviewer suggested, I chose to oven-roast them instead of deep-frying them.  I simply tossed the bite-sized potatoes in a bowl with some olive oil, then tossed in the other ingredients, then pan-roasted them in the oven at 400 F for 40 minutes.  I did not include the cilantro, only because it's not a taste my wife and I particularly like.

Very tasty! I used unpeeled golden potatoes which worked just fine. I used curry powder instead of paste as that is what I had. A bit of tumeric. Really good side dish to a coconut fish recipe. I will make this again.

I love this recipe. It's tasty and a perfect addition to an Indian meal. I added an extra tsp of the curry paste, which made the fries very tasty. I think 1tsp isn't enough. Will make this again many times.
