These were a total flop!  Waste of time and ingredients. Seemed like they needed some flour added.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I've never had a cookie recipe flop like this one did.  Sorry!

GOOD WITH REVISIONS!  Despite reviews, I tried these, keeping in mind that they turned out runny for others.  I made 1st batch as directed with same results.  I added 1/2 cup flour  to rest of batter, refrigerated batter before putting them on cookie sheet and baked for 15 minutes.  Turned out to be a nice, soft, tasty cookie.

I followed this recipe "step by step" and it was a disaster!  The cookies were gooey and FLAT!  The mixture is more like a brownie batter, which is how I finished out the batch....put it in a cake pan and baked it all at once!

This cookie recipe is just like the ones my best friend's mother would make at the beginning of the school year. Those were so delicious and these are too. They take me down memory lane, oh what fun!

"Total flop" doesn't even begin to describe this giant, gooey mess. I wish I had read the comments. I followed the recipe exactly also. I tried "drop by rounded spoonfuls", then tried larger spoonfuls, thinking it just wasn't even batter. Then tried even larger spoonfuls. Nothing worked.
