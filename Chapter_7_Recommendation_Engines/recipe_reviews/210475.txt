I really didn't know to expect when I made this and I was wonderfully suprised. I didn't have cashews, I only had hazelnuts, so I improvised with those, other than that, I cut the recipe in half as there were only 2 of us. This is the perfect dessert after a spicy Indian meal. Thanks for the recipe!

Mine turned out very oily. I could taste the ghee. Very greasy!  I also found it too sweet.  I would look for another recipe.
