This was easy. Personally I did not like the taste at all, although I like all the ingredients.

I really liked this recipe.  I made it with evap. milk instead of cream; omitted mushroom and used 1/4 c. low fat marg.; and used 1 tsp. almond extract.  My husband on the other hand hated it.  After touching his tongue to the chicken he promptly scraped off the cheese wrapped it in foil and threw it away.  And I had to give him a separate plate of rice because the sauce had spread to the rice on his plate.  So unfortunately I won't be making this again.

It has a very unique taste. Definitely is top 5 in my list. However, anyone who doesnt like amaretto taste should not expect too much.

I just made this dish per the recipe and it was wonderful. As with other reviewers, I felt the sauce was a bit thin, but my company said she preferred thin sauces to thick.

I made this as a second course for 8 on Christmas dinner 2004, never tried it before. Used Amaretto for liquor, and it turned out marvellous. The Amaretto really didn't dominate. I served it together with lamb's lettuce, roasted breadcrumbs, some sun dried tomatoes (for colour). I actually wanted to add a slice of orange, but I forgot.

Really delicious!

An excellent recipe, the flavours go together extremely well.  I only recommend this for people who like strong flavours - all of the ingredients in this recipe are quite bold.
I made a small roux first to thicken the sauce up, and if you actually cook it for 40 minutes nobody will like it because the chicken will be dried out - try 20 minutes, but better yet - learn your oven and how long it should take.  Chop the capers too.

I made this dish for a dinner party, and it was a great success, everyone loved it. But I did not use amaretto, I used half and half rum and gin. It was delicious!

Not a big fan. I like all the ingredients in this dish except the Amaretto, too sweet. I think a red wine would have been better.

i combine this recipe with the almond sauce chicken breast recipe also found on this site.  i follow the first three steps of the almond chicken recipe.  i dredge the chicken in an egg and almond mixture.  then i saute in butter over the stove top.  then i start at step three on this recipe and put the sauce over the chicken and heat in the oven.  i serve it with linguine.  not the most healthy, but very yummy and tasty.

this is really good, I've made it twice. THe first time I made it with kalmatta olives because that's all I had.  The second time I used both capers and kalmatta olives.  My kids and whole family loved it.

This was ok. It was moderately tasty. I thought it had way to much butter floating on the top of the sauce. I served it over angel hair pasta. I might try it again with less butter and sherry instead of amaretto.

I was expecting more out of this dish based on the reviews and the ingredients.  It tasted WAY too much like amaretto - - I would cut back on the liquor that you add to this dish.  The sauce was thin, too.  And I only cooked the chicken for 25 minutes, 40 would have been too much.  I've had better chicken recipes from this site.  Sorry!

This recipe is very tasty.  I would dice up the capers next time to spread the flavour more evenly, otherwise perfect as is.  It freezes wonderfully too. Very yummy and pretty simple.

Quite good -- I used only 1/4 cup of amaretto, and next time I'd use less butter.  And be sure to rinse the capers before adding them!  The sauce wasn't as thick as I'd thought it would be, but it still went nicely with pasta.

I thought this was great but my husband kept commenting on the sweet almound taste - duh Amaretto!  He didn't like it though, so probably won't make it just for myself.

I had high hopes for this recipe and was sorely disappointed. The flavors are strange together (In fact it tasted so odd I triple checked the recipe to make sure I didn't make any mistakes) and the sauce was thin and overly sweet. I could only eat half my portion and the rest of the family barely managed to choke their servings down. My husband even made the comment that he thought the recipe was submitted as a prank.

Very delicious.Made this for company his evening and it was a huge success. The gravy was a little thin but still thick enough. Will adjust the liquids next time I make it. This went very well over pasta. Serve with a good wine and some garlic bread and you can have a great dinner.
Thanks Rebecca

My husband and I LOVE amaretto, so we were expecting to love this dish.  Unfortunately, our hopes were a little too high.  The sauce was thin and we could barely taste the Amaretto.  40 minutes is definitely too long for the chicken...I'd check it by about 25 minutes or so!
I will not be making this again.

My wife loved it, I liked it; sauce was soupy so added some flour at the end to thicken it and that helped. Wonder if rinsing capers will change taste as some suggest?

Pretty good! I loved how the amaretto blended in with the other flavors. My sauce was a little thin, so I added a bit of cornstarch while I was whisking to help thicken it up...I think that helped. This dish went great over a bed of angel hair tossed with a little  ground pepper. Thanks!

This dish was amazing. Flavor was certainly not lacking! Instead of just cream, I used half and half; instead of Gruyere cheese, I used Sargento Artisan blends of cheddar and parmasean; I used 1/4 cup of amaretto; I used dried marjoram instead of tarragon, and left the capers out; I also made a little roux to go in with the onion mix. I paired this dish with homemade cheese biscuits and candied yams. Great meal!!

The only change I made to this recipe was to use dried tarragon in place of fresh.  I also halved it and served it over sticky rice.  We love this type of dinner!  I served this with a garden salad full of veggies, and that's all we needed!  The sauce was great.  If I didn't have Amaretto on hand, I'd think sherry, brandy, or white wine would go well with this.  If you leave out the capers (or the Kalamata olives as some have subbed), then you would have a sweeter sauce----that's the purpose of the capers.  Thanks for a wonderful meal last night!

I am a huge fan of Amaretto, and all the ingredients in this recipe, but the flavor wasn't worth the effort. It's not a difficult recipe by any means, just not tasty enough to warrant making it again.

I was amazed at how easy it was to make and surprised that my 6 year old asked for seconds.

The dish was a little rich but very good. 
For an inexperienced cook like my self, it was a nice surprise for my fiancé.

My first attempt in making this dish went well.  Everything had a nice flavor, except the amaretto cream sauce on top.  I think I used too much.  Another issue was the type of amaretto I had.  I bought a cheap, knock-off brand (Hiram Walker).  It should NOT be used for cooking, only for mixing drinks haha!  I think if I had bought the Disaronno, I would have been a lot happier. I will let y'all know next time I make it.

Also, I made this dish with Basil instead of Tarragon, and Romano instead of Gruyere, and it turned out great!

I really like this recipe BUT I can understand some of the other reviews. It has bold flavors but my family likes it. I have made this many times and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the sauce requires a lot of tweaking. Made as stated in the recipe, it sometimes separates and is way less appetizing.

Wow.  Not for those with constricted arteries but very very tasty, and while i'm an inexperienced cook it worked the first time.

This was very good - I did cut back a little on the amaretto and did not add more butter.  I would use a meat thermometer as the chicken was overcooked

I really wanted to like this recipe. I followed it exactly. It was way to watery. You need to make a roux or something. Sorry, but I won't make this again

I did make some changes, left out mushrooms, garlic, capers and onions my husband doesn't like those,  we added 1 c of amaretto and 1 1/4 c of cream, and 1c of Romano cheese didn't have the cheese called for, only added 1/4 c of butter to brown the chicken in because some reviews said it was greasy used flour,paprika,salt and freshly ground pepper to coat the chicken and then browned it and 3 T cornstarch to thicken the sauce up just mixed it in with the amaretto based on the reviews some said the sauce was thin...only baked it for 20 min based on one review said 40 min was too long and we cut  the chicken in half because the breast was too thick.....this turned out perfect my husband said how good it was and it was very tasty. Served it over egg noodles....  Will be making it again....

The Amaretto made this recipe too sweet.  I would experiment with substituting the Amaretto with another nutty flavor that's not so sweet.

My boyfriend and I thought this was wonderful!  I made half with chicken and a separate 
half with protien patties because I am vegetarian and it worked well.  I will also cut 
down the amount of butter next time - a little too much, other wise I enjoyed it a lot
and will make it again!

The flavors in this dish are mouth-watering!  My husband and I, both loved it!  Next time, I will use less butter than the recipe called for, as I thought it was a little too rich for my taste.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this recipe.
