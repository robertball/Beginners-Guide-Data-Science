As the aroma of this wafted through the house I just knew we were in for something good and boy, were we! I doubled the amount of spices but left out the cinnamon, and used 4 big cloves of minced, fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I cut the roast into large chunks so the spices could penetrate the meat better and it worked like a charm. Finally, to make these more authentic, after shredding the meat into smaller chunks I spread it out in a thin layer on a cookie sheet and baked it in a 400 degree oven about 20 minutes, just long enough to crisp the exterior of the meat. Great on it's own, but in a tortilla with a little of the "Avocado Salad with Bacon and Sour Cream" this was just over the top good. The meat was tender and perfectly seasoned, keeping in mind, however, that I doubled up on the spices. We are looking forward to having the leftovers again tomorrow night!

GREAT!! The recipe is very similar to the one that one was given to me. I add several sprigs of fresh cilantro to the broth in which the pork is simmering. Also at the end, break apart the pork into large chunks and place in a pan with some of the broth and bake at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated. This step gets the edges crispy and resembles the authentic style carnitas which is usually fried in lard.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS! After reading some of the reviews, I tripled the spice mix and added chilli powder for heat- I also had a bigger pork roast than was specified. It is virtually no work whatsoever and the pork literally fell apart as I was taking it out of the slow cooker.

I let the whole thing cook for 10 hours on a Saturday and then shredded the pork, skimmed the fat off the broth and boiled the broth down. I then added 1/4 cup of chili sauce and 2 tbsp sugar and poured the sauce over the pork.

Served the whole thing as part of a make-your-own taco bar for my boyfriend's birthday and not a bit was leftover!

Amazing! my husband likes these better than chipotle. Since some reviewers said the seasoning didn't permeate the entire roast, I cut it into quarters or sometimes a little smaller and then apply the rub. I use a two pound roast with one 14oz can of chicken broth and the stated amt of seasoning. So if I were using a 4 lb roast I would probably double the rub.

mmmm, these were so good and the house smelled great, as well.  when my daughter came home, the first words out of her mouth were, ''what smells so good?!''  the meat falls apart and has the most interesting flavor, i think created by the addition of the cinnamon. i tripled all the spices, with the exception of the cinnamon, which i only doubled, and i thought that was the perfect amount--def. present without being over-powering. i also subbed Mexican oregano from my garden for the reg. variety. Last, i sliced half an onion and threw that in as well. !ole! p.s.  i didn't bother with turning the meat. there's really no need to.

I made this recipe with the suggestion to double up on the spices except for the cinnamon, but the cinnamon really ruined this recipe and it was too salty for my taste.  I liked the other spices and will make again using water and absolutely no cinnamon.

I usually make carnitas in a pot on the stove and it always comes out great.  However, since I just bought a slow cooker I thought it would be so nice to try it this way since I wouldn't have to be home in order for it to cook.  It came out awesome!  I took another reviewer's advice and cooked it for 6 hours instead of 10.  (I've got one of those crock pots that gives you the option of 4-6-8 or 10 hours, and it automatically adjusts the temp based on how many hours you put in.)  The seasoning was great although once I shredded the meat I did add some salt for some extra flavor.  The leftovers were still nice and tender too.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Followed advice as given by "naples34102".  Liked it so much, I'm making it again for company.  Super moist.***Review Update:  I've made this 5 times now and it's been consistently fantastic until this last time.  It was a little bit drier and slightly more chewy.  I cooked this batch from a previously FROZEN rump roast and will NEVER FREEZE the meat again!  Why spoil perfection!

I quickly ran out of rub the first time I made these, so I have learned to triple the amount of rub the recipe calls for.  So tender and flavorful.  Very economical and can eat on this for days.  Served with tortillas, tomatillo salsa, mexican crumbly queso, chopped tomatoes & onions, and sour cream.  Got rave reviews from everyone.

This was excellent....easy and extremely flavorful. I followed my mom's (Naples 34102) recommendations in that I doubled the spices, left the cinnamon out, and put the meat in the oven afterwards for a bit to crisp it up.

I prepared this meal "Burrito Bowl" style for those who are familiar with Chipoltle and Qdoba restaurants. I made a cilantro lime rice with butter, and then layered it with seasoned pinto beans, the carnitas, fresh homemade salsa, fresh chopped lettuce, shredded Jack cheese, and sour cream. Both my husband and I thought this was every bit as good as a restaurant's "Carnitas Burrito Bowl", only MUCH fresher tasting! We are looking forward to eating the leftovers tonight!

This recipe is wonderful and found a new place in my rotation.  As it drives me crazy to see reviews that do not resemble the original recipe at all, I followed this recipe exactly the first time -- To Live For!!. The second time, I used pork loin instead, because I had it, but was concerned it would not be as good due to the leaness.  If you are like me and are trying to cut some fat from your diet, don't be afraid of this substitute.  The pork was great, tender and you don't miss the fat.

Fantastic! I was looking for a comparable carnitas recipe to the carnitas from Rubios, and these hit the spot!
I tripled the spices as recommended by other reviewers, with the case of the exceptions below.
I ran out of chicken boullion, so the stock was 3 parts chicken/1 part beef boullion. Because I used the boullion instead of homemade stock (I used it up last week for soup) I also cut the tripled salt in half.

All in all, it was bloody fantastic and nothing was left when we were done eating.

I have made this many times and it's very good!  I do the following with my left over meat. I heated my corn tortillas in a non stick pan with no oil until hot and soft. I just put the carnita meat and some cheese and rolled. Once rolled I brushed olive oil on each one and placed on cookies sheet sprayed with Pam and baked at 350 for 15-20 min. They were really good and crunchy...NOT greasy or bad for you.

Authentic or not, this is pretty tasty. I did double the spices like others had, used fresh minced garlic and sea salt. I didn't read the directions clearly before I started cooking, which stated that you were to rub in the spices to the meat before adding the meat to the crockpot. (I can be a bit scatterbrained.) I didn't see that until after I braised the meat. I waited until the meat was braised, set it on a platter to cool a bit, then rubbed the spices into the meat. I took naples advice and shredded the meat onto a baking pan I'd covered with aluminum foil and baked it for about 20 minutes. The cinnamon wasn't a deal breaker for me, it's a subtle flavor that I felt was unique and made the usual dinner better. I served this meat as soft tacos to the fam, but I had it on a bed of sauteed peppers and onions, with a small amount of lowfat pepperjack cheese and FF sour cream. I served it with Mexican Rice 2 and D's Famous Salsa, which are also from this site. My roast was HUGE, almost seven and a half pounds. Make sure when you make this you have a big family/healthy eaters or you don't mind eating leftovers for a couple days. NOTE: This has to be my new favorite way to cook roast. This makes excellent "salad" sandwiches.

This is a great recipe!  As many others stated, I doubled the spices and then after they were done in the crock pot, I removed all the fat, broke it down into bite-sized pieces and baked it at 400 F for 20 minutes to brown the edges.  I also utilized the juices to make Spanish Rice II from this website.  Pour the juices into a bowl, let it rest so that it separates, skim the fat from the top (reserve 2 TBSP for rice) and then strain out all solids.  I was left with about 3 cups of juices which I used to replace the water called for in the rice.  Very, very good!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Excellent! And I agree with the others, the house smells WONDERFUL as this is cooking.  For those who commented on the lack of flavor, here is what I did. I rubbed the spice mixture on the night before and let sit in the fridge overnight.  This is essential in letting the flavors soak into the meat. My roast was 3.5 pounds and it was perfectly done after 8.5 hours when I checked it. It came out super moist. I pulled the meat, then put it in a foil pan with some of the liquid. I tossed it around a few times then put it under the broiler for 5 minutes. Some nice crispy edges, and moist, savory meat. YUM! The only ingredient change I made was to add the juice of half an orange. Everything was perfect and I wouldn't change a thing.  The cinnamon flavor is there, but not overpowering at all. It gives the recipe a unique flavor that make people ask what it is.  I did find a light sprinkle of salt over the pulled meat brought out even more flavor. This rivals my favorite carnitas that I usually get in my burrito bowl at that famous fast-food restaurant. I will be making this again and again.

This is so good!  It makes sooo much meat, but left overs are a breeze!  I place the meat in muffin tins in the freezer until they harden, and then pull them out, wrap them in parchment, and stick them back in the freezer.  All you have to do is pop one in the microwave to defrost on a busy weeknight.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, I have been making my own similar version of this for years. I like to add a handful of chopped cilantro and about 1/2 cup chopped onion right on top of the pork when I first put it in the slow cooker. I have also used a can of El Pato(mexican hot tomato sauce) poured over the top and this kicks up the flavor and heat a bit (I love spicy food). If you like your carnitas a little crispy, just throw in the oven on a cookie sheet for about ten minutes. Either way, this recipe produces great carnitas everytime, GUARANTEED!

Made this the other night and it was a HUGE hit. We opted to eat ours rolled in flour tortillas and sprinkled with monty jack cheese. AWESOME !! Will definitely make it again. My son says it's also very tasty on a bun with some Franks Hot Sauce.

As written this is a 4 1/2-star.  As made, it is a 6 star.  I will be making this again, and again.  I did as most folks said and doubled the spices, all but the salt, which I only did 1.5 as much.  I also substituted fresh garlic (3 heads), pureed with a mortar and pestle, substituted allspice for the cinnamon (allspice is a common Mexican spice), and added a bit of lime juice to it all to make it more of a paste rather than a dry rub.  It smelled amazing and tasted even better.  I found I didn't need all 10 hours - my roast (4 lb) was done in 8.

I haven't given 5 stars in a while ... but this recipe is fantastic.  The minor changes I made did not alter the recipe so much that it is an actual new recipe, which I see so often in the comments.  I doubled the spices except for the salt and the cinnamon.  I cut the roast up into quarters.  I added whole cloves of garlic to the broth.  Last, I browned the meat after I shredded it ... took only about 20 minutes at 400F.  My family all raved and asked if I would please make it again.  At the end of dinner they were already arguing over who would get the leftovers to eat the next day.  The cinnamon adds a little something special to the flavor, but I would not add more than the recipe calls for.  I might reduce it a bit next time, but I like the uniqueness it gives to the pork.

My, oh my, was this ever so good.  Took a tip from another reviewer and cut up the meat into 4 large chunks so that more surface would be covered by the spices which I doubled and was very glad that I did.  The smell alone while this was cooking was phenomenal and it definitely lived up to it's promise.  I GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed by this recipe.  Thank you Erin Parker - you have alleviated me to stardom in my family and friends eyes!

Excellent!  I followed others advice and doubled all the spices except for the cinnamon (1/4 tsp).  I cut the meat into large chunks and trimmed off as much fat as I could.  Once cooked, the meat fell apart and shredded with ease.  I put the shredded meat on a cookie sheet to crisp it up a bit.  I stirred a bit of the broth back into the crisped meat before serving.  Moist and delicious!  It also makes enough to feed a crowd with little work so we served to friends during playoffs.  Everyone loved it - very authentic tasting!

made as written, it kills me when people don't follow the recipe and rate it lower. The seasonings were great. I had a two pound roast so I halved the seasonings, I wish I had doubled them. In the crock pot for about 7 hours. I stuck it in the oven for 20 minutes, that was a mistake... it came out dry, not crisp. I will do this recipe again with double the seasonings.
Cinnamon is widely used in Mexican cooking, I wouldn't delete it from the recipe based on the reviews here from people who didn't like it. Try it first.

This was delicious, but I did a little tweaking of the recipe. I recommend salt and peppering the meat first and browning in olive oil on all sides to caramelize it before putting it in the crock pot. I also omitted the cinnamon and added fresh garlic, chopped cilantro and sliced yellow onion. Halfway thru I added the juice of one lime, which really brightened the sauce/flavor of the meat, and some garlic salt. Served it soft taco style on corn tortillas with shredded green cabbage, jack cheese, salsa verde from Trader Joes, chopped scallions, cilantro, a little sour cream and a squeeze of lime juice. Muy delicioso!!!!

I made this as written although after reading the reviews most suggested doubling the spices except for the cinammon.  I didn't add the cinammon per the reviews. It needed more salt for sure. The taste was good, but not enough spices. Also to give it an authentic outer crispiness after it was done, I cut it in chunks and put them in the broiler for about 8 minutes and added salt. They were delicious. Next time I will double the spices, leave out the cinammon (again) and broil at the end. This will be 5 stars next time. Thanks. It's a keeper.

So tender and juicy!  Yum! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added adobo and I doubled the other spices except for the salt.  I liked the cinnamon in the seasoning mixture.  I used about 1 1/2 T. adobo.  I also reduced my chicken broth to 1 cup for a 5 lb pork butt, because I didn't want the meat to taste boiled.  It took exactly the 10 hours listed in the recipe.  I have been trying to find a good carnitas recipe and this is it!   Will definitely use this one again.

I followed the recipe, but I also took a large orange, and rolled it until it was nice and juicy, cut it in half squeezed the juice all over the raw pork in my slow cooker, and then put the orange halves in with everything else

This recipe was amazing!  It worked well with pork loin AND pork shoulder.  Tossing the shredded pork in the oven greatly enhanced the texture & flavor. This recipe is a real keeper.

I'm sorry to buck the trend here, but I really didn't like this flavor.  I made it as directed and I think the cinnamon ruined it for me.  I'm no world traveler so I probably wouldn't know "authentic" Mexican cuisine if it bit me, but this tasted more like a dish that I ordered at a Middle Eastern restaurant than anything I ever had in Mexico.  I know many reviewers recommended leaving out the cinnamon, but I think it's important to rate the recipes as written.  The meat was almost mushy, so I didn't like the texture much either.  I LOVE carnitas at Mexican restaurants and I was really hoping to get the same vibe at home, but I think I will have to keep looking.  I even tried to salvage the leftovers with diced green chilis and taco seasoning, but the cinnamon still came through.

This is a pretty good recipe although I didn't follow it exactly. I left out the cinnamon. And to get the great carnitas taste you must have chipotles and adobo sauce. I seeded and minced 2 chipotles and added 3 tbs. adobo sauce. I also used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Ground that with a pestle and mortar with other spices. I used more than 2 cups of chicken broth to cover the meat completely and after I shredded it, I spread in over a foiled baking sheet with a few ladle-fulls of the broth and baked it for 15 min. @ 400, halfway through, stirring meat around.  I bought 2-2 lb. cuts of pork shoulder, bone-in and served in on corn tortillas with lime juice and Tapatio sauce.

This recipe was easy to make and amazing! I had a smaller pork shoulder (about 2.5 pounds), so I doubled the spices except for the cinnamon, and it came out great. I put the rub on the night before and wrapped it in saran wrap. Put it in the slow cooker on low and it was ready in 6 hours. Did as others suggested and put the meat in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes (with some of the cooking liquid), then moistened it with a bit more liquid when it was done. 

We served it with corn tortillas and roti bread, guacamole and pico. It was superb, and we'll definitely be adding this to the rotation.

yummy simple budget friendly recipe that yields a lot of food.  I do as many others and cut the roast into chunks and triple the seasonings so that more of the meat has a full flavor.
For those looking to include a "side dish" give this a try:  Double the broth to 32 oz.  Put 1 lb of dried pinto beans in the bottom of the crock pot with the broth and bay leaves.  Put the seasoned roast on top of the bean/broth mix and cook per original recipe.  The seasonings on the meat and the long cook time make for some very yummy beans.  Add them to your burritos, nachos, or serve as a side dish with or without rice.
You can also give the beans a little more zip by adding a can of rotel with the broth...good either way.

This turned out really great! Did make a few changes.  I followed another reviewer's advice and doubled the spices, leaving out cinnamon (don't double the salt!).  I also braised in the oven on 325 for about 3 hours instead of doing it in the crockpot. Spreading on a cookie sheet after and baking at 400 for about 15-20 minutes was really worth it - crisp outside, tender inside.  Served with corn tortillas, cilantro, salsa, guacamole, cheese, whatever...they were yummy!

Really excellent & simple using a 6.75 bone-in pork shoulder. Following some posted reviews I cut the roast into 4-5 large hunks and tripled the spice mixture except for salt & cinnamon. Was able to spoon off the excess fat and the carnitas were juicy & flavorful. So far used to make fajitas, enchiladas & tortilla soup.

One of the best things i have even eaten.  We have made this for guests a couple of times and they are amazed and immediately want the recipe.  We double the spice and cut the cinnamon in half. Also a key is to do the rub the night before and wrap in saran wrap and in the fridge it goes.  also, throw fresh cilantro and juice of a lime on top of the pork just before throwing the switch on the crock pot to start the journey to flavortown.  Great the next day in enchiladas, or nachos.

With just a couple of changes I added sliced Onion on the bottom of the pot before adding the roast and in the dry rub I added a half teaspoon of Chili powder. It was FANTASTIC!!! My husband said he could eat this all day. I was thrilled with this recipe and would make this for anyone. It was easy, prep time was fast and delicious!

I really like this recipe.  10 hours was a bit long for me, so I decided to cook it on high for about 5 1/2 or 6 hours instead.  It turned out great! The meat was so tender and easy to shred.  I don't enjoy super-spicy food, so I appreciated the mild flavor of these carnitas.  My two-year-old enjoyed it, too!  I could really taste the cinammon (without it being overpowering), and it really blended nicely with the other spices.  I put the pork in some flour tortillas with some corn, sour cream, and cheese (my husband also seasoned it with some taco sauce), and it was great!  A big hit.

I cooked a 3.5 lb roast and it only took about 8 hours.  I would double the spices next time and use fresh garlic.

I doubled all the spices, add some dried red chili peppers for heat, and used a pressure cooker instead of a crock pot.  A pressure cooker can cook pork in 45 minutes what takes a slow cooker 8 hours to do.  Be sure to reserve some of the cooking liquid to moisten the meat after you shred it.

I was worried about the cinnamon and wasn't thrilled at first with the smell since I could still smell the cinnamon, but man o man was this the best carnitas I have ever had.  My whole family devoured it.  It is better than what I have had in restaurants...  I can't even begin to express how good this was.  Really really impressed.

I want to thank PopRocks for sharing this great recipe!  Like others have suggested, I tripled all the spices, including the cinnamon and used 3 bay leaves. I also cut the roast into 1.5" thick slices and rubbed the spices on front and back. I cut up one medium onion and layered it on the bottom along with some fresh cilantro. Layered the meat on top and poured the broth in. I re-arranged the meant slices a few times during cooking and shredded the pork after 5 hours easily. I cooked it for 5 hours on low and 2 hours on high, it was well cooked after 7 hours so I took it off.  Incredibly tasty and tender meat, a great flavor to it. A friend commented he felt the cinnamon was a bit strong, maybe I'll use 1/3 a teaspoon next time. A nice change from beef and chicken tacos that I usually make and I'll have some left over. Smelled incredible cooking, mouth was watering all day.  You won't regret making this, if you do, invite me over for dinner and I'll eat it!

I made this yesterday...it is wonderful.  I made a little bit bigger roast and adjusted the seasonings.  I shredded it and then refrigerated the juices seperately so that I can skim the fat off today.  I will make a few different meals from this recipe including pork tacos/quesadillas and BBQ Pork.  Thanks for a good and easy family oriented recipe!!

4 stars for the simplicity of the preparation - doesn't get much easier than this.  Did double ingredients for the dry rub; cooked on low 10 hours - no need to turn roast @ 5 hrs (defeats the purpose of a slow cooker).  Served on tortillas w/ black beans & cheese - good stuff!

Lasted days after we made it, super rich and tender meat...loved this recipe. The good thing is that the pork doesn't just have to be stuffed into tortillas: you could eat it with rice, beans, greens, + more.

I cut my pork shoulder into two inch squares then placed it in my slow cooker along with the bay leaves placed on top. Next, I combined seven garlic cloves, 1/2 of a white onion roughly chopped, a tbsp of oregano, 1/2 tsp of thyme, salt, and 1/2 cup of water into the food processor and pulsed until smooth. Poured the blended mixture over the pork, and then added a cup of regular Coca-Cola. The Coke infuses the meat with a magical sweetness that is simply out of this world. You must try the Coke ingredient over the broth. I served the carnitas on spinach tortillas with homemade Pico de Gallo with lemon zest added and homemade Salsa Verde made with tomatillos. The carnitas, along with a local Oatmeal Porter, was a very satisfying meal which was given the stamp of approval from Mi Gato Loco.

Yum Yum! My 6 year old was ready for dinner at 3 PM when she walked into the house and smelled the carnitas. I used pork tenderloin, since that's what I had on hand. I doubled the spices and used real garlic (left off the cinnamon). I loved the tip about crisping for 10 or so min in the oven at 400 degrees. Made a world of difference. Made these with best spanish rice recipe and mexican corn recipe from this site. Dinner was an absolute HIT on all fronts. We will be making these again this weekend when we have company. 
Also used the left over carnitas for dinner last night  tossed in salsa to top a frozen pizza before baking. Wow....

OMG, THE BEST EVER PORK CARNITAS.  I KEPT THE RECIPE THE SAME, BUT I SEARED THE MEAT IN A DUTCH OVEN ALL SIDES FOR ABOUT 4 OR 5 MINUTES EACH, ONLY 1 CAN OF CHICKEN BROTH, PUT THE LID ON AND SLOW COOK IN THE OVEN AT 300 DEGREES FOR ABOUT 4 TO 5 HOURS DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOUR PORK BUTT IS.

If you make this SKIP the cinnamon! It had a terrible taste so I added a can of tomato paste to try & save it and it turned out pretty well. Would definately make again without the cinnamon and add the paste!

Pretty good - I made the rub + added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes to add some heat.  I rubbed it and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  I added a little more cumin, coriander, fresh garlic & red pepper flakes in the morning.  I seared it before putting it in the crockpot.  I put one small chopped onion on the bottom, then some soaked Ojo De Cabra beans, then the roast (which was about 2.75 lbs).  About two hours into cooking I realized I forgot the bay leaves!  and threw them in then.  It cooked for about 6 1/2 hours and came out very tender, it was falling apart as I was trying to get it out of the crockpot!  I think it's a great base recipe.  I would liked to have added some chili powder but I'm out.  The beans had a wonderful flavor from the rub.  Next time, I think I might do what others suggested and cut it into smaller pieces and rub those down completely to get the flavor in a little deeper.  I served it with the beans, Spanish rice, sour cream, salsa, queso fresco, avocado, and flour tortillas  I have a ton of leftovers too that will make great burritos and sandwiches!

So amazingly delicious!  Didn't have ground coriander so I used fresh cilantro, and accidentally forgot the cinnamon.  Added about 3 tbsp adobo sauce from a can of chipotles.  So tender, it shredded the meat just by lifting little pieces with tongs right in the slow cooker!  Served it to my husband in a bowl over rice (flavored with butter, lime, salt, and cilantro), black beans, sour cream, cheese, and avocado - just like his favorite restaurant!

Very good! After I cook the meat in the slow cooker, I finish it off in a pan and fry it in olive oil to make it nice and crispy.

I was already to go with this recipe and then I couldn't find the lid to my crockpot, LOL. So, I roasted it in the oven low n slow for about 5 hours....the meat just FELL apart!  I used a pork shoulder blade instead of the shoulder because it has less fat.  But I still had to fridge the juices to get the fat to rise to skim it.  The flavor was great (I quadrupled them--sans the salt n cinnamon) and made a great meal.  Will def make again! I do also recommend to spread it on a baking sheet and bake for 20 moin...made it nice and crispy!

Perfect flavor for carnitas. I doubled the spices except the cinnamon (used 1/4 t.) and cut the roast into 4 pieces. Cooked on High heat in the slow cooker for 5 hours, then shredded slightly and baked on cookie sheet until edges were just starting to crisp, about 15 minutes. Hubby raved! He has ordered carnitas alot from different Mexican restaurants and put these at the top of the list of his favorites. Thanks for posting this easy and great recipe. We will be using it over and over.

This smelled great while cooking, but didn't permeate the meat giving it any additional flavor. We served the meat with sauteed peppers and onions, with traditional fajitas fixings.

I had my butcher carve a boneless pork shoulder from a much larger bone-in piece.  My piece weighed 4.83 lbs. and I ended up trimming some of the exterior fat, then cubed the remaining chunk into 4 pieces.  I tripled the dry mix ingredients and rubbed each quarter with a generous coating.  Then covered the bowl and let it sit in the refrigerator over night.  Next morning I poured one can (14.5 oz) of chicken stock into the slow cooker, then laid the chunks on top of 4 bay leaves in the bottom of the slow cooker, set it to cook on low heat and forgot about it for five hours.  At the five hour mark I turned the meat over and added half a sliced onion and two cloves of chopped garlic to the liquid.  Three hours later I sprinkled a tablespoon of chili powder over the meat and an hour after that I squeezed a seedless orange onto the top of the pieces of meat.  Cooked one more hour (a total of 10) dipped up the meat and separated it with two forks while scraping away the fat.  I used some of the liquid to moisten the pork and enhance the flavor.  I reheated it the next day and all my guest were crazy about how good it was.

I did not care for the spices in this dish. We added cumin and garlic, which made it better.  But, I doubt we'll repeat this again.

Everybody LOVED this recipe, and that is saying a lot in our house, with a 5 year old, 3 year old, and 18 month old : )  My husband and I adored it too.  Really delicious combination of flavors.  I tripled the spices (for a 4 lb roast), and seared the meat before slow cooking it.  I ABSOLUTELY included the cinnamon and wouldn't dream of omitting it - I have cooked other savory dishes with cinnamon before, notably my great-aunts' pasta sauce recipe (and they were from Italy), and pastitsio - cinnamon is a wonderful addition and melded well with the other spices.  And I did triple the cinnamon along with the other spices!  I left the pork whole in the slow cooker, and it turned out so tender and flavorful.  After pulling the meat apart, I returned it to the slow cooker on the "warm" setting, in the broth, to serve - it was great, so juicy.  I would not recommend putting it into the over to "crispen" actually - I would think that would just dry it out!  I served it in flour tortillas (fajita size) with queso fresco, diced tomatoes, fresh cilantro, sliced radishes, and homemade guacamole ("Guacamole" recipe on this site).  Also had lime wedges, but didn't end up using them.  I had shredded cheddar/monterey jack blend cheese for the kids.  I had a side of black beans cooked with lots of cumin, salt and pepper along with it.  Kids loved it so will definitely make it again and again!

I made this for a potluck - Pulled Pork Sliders!
This was my first time dealing with this size meat, and I don't think I will ever purchase a pork shoulder again! Or at least I'll be better prepared, and find one that doesn't have skin and a ton of fat still on it. But, I digress...
As many reviewers suggested, I (attempted to) cut the meat into smaller chunks and played around with the measurements of the spices: doubled the salt and cinnamon, tripled everything else. I also added some minced garlic, which was lovely! Instead of chicken broth, I used "Better Than Buillon," which worked just as well.
Once the pork was done simmering in the crock pot, I put the shredded pieces in the oven at 400 degrees F for about 20 minutes, which resulted in a nice crispness. Then, I tossed the meat with some BBQ sauce.
This was a great hit with everyone! And I'll definitely make it again for those who missed it...

This was the best and closest to authentic tasting Mexican food I have ever made!  My pork roast was only about 2 1/2 pounds so I didn't use the whole 2 cups of broth, but I will next time, as it is this juice with the awesome seasonings mixed with the shredded meat that gives it such a kick.  It was frozen when I started so the seasonings didn't really stick to it, but it didn't matter.  I thought the cinnamon would be off-putting, but it wasn't at all.  This would have made a good tamale filling, if I were more ambitious, but it made hellacious soft tacos and was SO easy!  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!

I had no idea how inexpensive pork shoulder is, making this as affordable as it is yummy! The recipe is so easy and the flavors are amazing.  Do not omit the cinnamon as suggested in other reviews...it is the true "surprise" ingredient that makes it so special!

Fantastic flavor, nice and juicy! After slow-cooking for 9 hours, we pulled the meat and roasted in a cake pan at 400 degrees for 20 minutes to crispen up the edges of the pork; ladled the juice back on, mixed well, and served on tortillas with cilantro-lime rice, diced avocado, and sour cream. Better than Chipotle...

Made this as instructed, but followed others advice and tripled the spices except cinnamon which I doubled. Just personal preference, I'd probably eliminate it next time.

Solid recipe, but nothing too incredible.

One word, AMAZING!  This was sooo good.  My husband LOVED it, and we both ate more than we should have.  It turned out so tender!  The spices could have been a little stronger, but adding some salt when it was finished helped with that.  Definitely a keeper!

Surprisingly good!  Followed others' recommendations to triple spices except cinnamon and salt.  I did go with the listed amount of cinnamon, and while at first the smell worried me that the cinnamon taste would be overpowering, after pulling the meat, the flavors all melded together and I agree with others that the cinnamon definitely added something...  

Finished it up in the oven after pulling, at 400 for 10 minutes - definitely helped.  Overall, a great recipe.  I've made carnitas the hard way in the past, and these were equally good.  Also very versatile - while I was doubtful about the claim it would be good with barbecue sauce, I did give it a try with Jack Daniels sauce, on a bun, and that was really good too!

Smelled and tasted great!  We ate it on soft corn tortillas or in a bowl without a shell (like chipotle's burrito bowl), topped with sour cream, tomatoes,  lettuce, cilantro, squirt of lime juice.  I will definitely make again.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that is was way too salty (maybe from combo of salty broth, added salt, and long cook time).  Next time I will do half broth/half water and maybe leave out the added salt entirely.  Great find, though!

This was crazy good.  I doubled the spices, but followed the recipe to a T with the ingredients.  I poked pockets in the meat and stuffed the extra spice mix all over to help penetrate the meat and it worked great.  I cooked this while I was at work, so I couldn't turn it after 5 hours and it didn't matter.  The top got this black crust on it that was just phenomenal.  I followed other suggestions and broiled it for about 8 minutes after I shredded it and it really crisped up nicely.  I will make this again and again.

This was an excellent recipe! The flavors just pop and within an hour could smell the wonderful spices coming from the crock pot. My roast was a little over 3 pounds and I cooked it to perfection in 8 hours. The only thing that I would personally cut down on was the cinnamon. It added a nice flavor but it seemed to compete with the cumin and other seasoning in the rub. I could taste that over everything else, so even the 1/4 of teaspoon I would cut to maybe an 1/8 of one.

one of my favorite recipes this is so easy to make and can last all week for different dinners. i followed the reviews and tripled the spices including the cinnamon added paprika and chili powder with a bit of celery seed and dried cilantro, cut up the meat into 2-1/2'' pieces coated in flour and browned in pan ,chop half a onion and one jalapeno seeded and white membrane removed. cook on high for about 4-5 hrs then switch to low until its done, place meat in baking dish and add a bit of the liquid brown it in oven for about 15-30 mins. usually make tacos the first night can be added to  scrambled eggs or enchiladas , rellenos or burritos  or even add some BBQ sauce for an awesome  BBQ sandwich.
DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE CINNAMON IT ADDS THAT SPECIAL FLAVOR , THAT REALLY COMES TOGETHER  AT THE END.

I had a 6.5 pound pork shoulder blade roast with a bone in it so I cut it into pieces removing the bone. Coated each piece of meat in the seasonings (doubled except the cinnamon) and cooked on low for 8.5 hours.  
I made a cilantro-chile-lime sauce for tacos (which is what we used the carnitas for) out of lime juice, fat-free sour cream, cilantro, chile powder, cumin, garlic powder, finely minced red onion and cayenne. 
These were so good my husband ate 6 tacos and my picky little boy ate 3!!!  Bueno! Bueno! Bueno!!!

These were so great.  I add black  pepper to the seasoning mix, but they are great as it.  I also didn't have 10 hours to cook, so I put them in the slow cooker on high for 5 hours instead.  Shredded perfectly and tasted moist and delicious.

this was very good!  I doubled the spices as others recommended and added cut up lemons and oranges to the crock pot.  This added another layer of flavor.  We enjoyed it with handmade tortillas and all the fixins'.  I'll be making it again for sure!

My husband is 100% Mexican, born and raised in Puebla, and he said this is the most authentic tasting Mexican dish I have ever made.  He was super impressed.  I do have to admit they taste exactly like the carnitas we've had on vacations to Mexico.  I am making tacos de carnitas for New Years and this is the recipe I'll be using!

Absolutely fantastic. I used a 2.4 lb roast, but kept all the spice amounts the same. I cooked it on low for 9 hours, shredded, then placed the meat on a baking sheet. Baked at 350 for 15 minutes or so, which worked out very nicely. The meat crisped up a bit, but wasn't dried out on the inside at all. I served this in flour tortillas with lettuce, tomato, a little fresh cilantro, shredded pepperjack cheese, and sour cream. YUM! Will definitely make this again and again, thank you!

This recipe is great!  We like spice (not heat), so I triple the spice mixture and bay leaf, and I use a pork roast. My husband doesn't like the cinnamon, so I omit that.  I used it the first time and I did like it, but the recipe calls for more than I would use if I was making this for myself. I also cut the roast into smaller chunks to help it cook faster, and reduced cooking time to 6 hrs on high.  After all, it's going to be shredded anyway.  It doesn't have to look beautiful! I also double the broth.  My husband is Cuban and grew up eating rice with his meals, so after we use this for carnitas one night, he puts the meat and juice over rice for lunch or dinner the next day.  The extra broth moistens the rice.  I love cilantro and lime a lot, so I add several cilantro sprigs and about 3 tbs. of lime juice while it's cooking.  It comes out moist, tender and very flavorful!  It truly falls apart with a fork.  As others have stated, after shredding, I put it in a jelly roll pan with some of the juice made during cooking and broil about 10 minutes.  Then I serve on flour tortillas with tomato, red onion, fresh cilantro and fresh lime juice.  OMG!!! I've actually got one cooking right now, and I can't wait til tonight to eat it!  Enjoy!!

I made this over the weekend, tripling the spices like many had recommended (even the cinnamon and corriander), let meat marinate over night and then cook for about 6 hours in the crock pot. I cut up the carnitas and stored them in an air tight container with all of the juices. 

I typically cook for the entire week on the weekend, so the carnitas were to be eaten as pork tacos and BBQ sandwiches throughout the week. To serve up carnitas tacos last night I followed some reviewers suggestions and put two servings of the meat in the oven for 15 minutes on 400 to make the meat "crispy." I do not recommend doing this as it only dries out the meat. This afternoon I reheated some of the meat in the microwave and it was very tender. 

This recipe was very easy and simple to use. The spices are flavorful, but not overwhelming. The meat can be used in many different types of dishes. I will be making this again.

So tasty!  I love the fact it's not fried in lard.  To get it a little crispier- after shredding it I sprinkle a little oil on the pork- and return it to my oven for a few mins.

This carnitas recipe is tasty, but it was missing a little citrus from what I'm used to. So at the end, before serving, I added the juice of two limes and it really mixed well with the flavors.

This is my husbands favorite.  He begs for carnitas on a weekly basis.  I always double the spices (except for the cinnamon), and I find it more flavorful if you rub the spice mixture on the pork and refrigerate overnight.  In addition, I add 1/2 cup of Orange Juice to the broth for cooking.  It's fool proof and delicious!

This was ok...the meat was very tender. I followed a few suggestions from previous reviews. I cut the roast into larger chunks and doubled the spices except for the cinnamon. I also shredded the meat and cooked it in the oven to "crisp" it up. Next time I make this I would NOT use the cinnamon. I like cinnamon, but it just didn't work for me. Also, I don't think I would crisp the meat next time.  This left the meat almost too crispy and it lost some of the tender juiciness created from the long slow cooking. Giving it four stars because without the cinnamon flavors it would have been great and the "crisping" idea came from other reviews.

5 stars for the seasonings even though I doubled most of them (except the salt), omitted the cinnamon, added a teaspoon of pepper & then roasted in the oven at 350* instead of the slow cooker....Cooked about 3 hours, removed the lid for the last 30 minutes, shredded the meat & allowed it to crisp up. Served with fresh pico de gallo, flour tortillas & mexican rice (the hubs yummy recipe)...so darn good, cannot wait for leftovers!!!

Can't wait to make this again! I would have given it 4.5* but of course I can't. The reason I didn't give it 5* was because I added about 1/2 can of Las Palmas to give it flavor. But the meat was so tender and was very easy to shred and remove the fat (which is usually the part I hate doing). I served it with tostada shells and all the trimmings. Yummy in the tummy!!

A couple reviews stated that this recipe was very close to Chipotle's carnitas, so I immediately went out and bought a chunk of meat and was ready to go.  As is, I gave this recipe a 3.  I did follow other reviewers' suggestions to double all spices except the salt & cinnamon,and I'm glad I did.  Even without doubling the cinnamon, the 1/4tsp that the recipe calls for made this WAY too sweet for my liking.  After removing the fat & shredding it, I salvaged it by tossing it into a pan with a whole, thinly sliced onion & a minced clove of garlic, added more salt to offset the sweet and then a few splashes of chicken broth to maintain moisture.  In the end, the tacos turned out great.  I will definitely make this recipe again as it was so simple to throw together and took very little effort to shred, only changes I would recommend is to leave out the cinnamon all together, add an extra 1/2 tsp of salt and some red pepper flakes for some heat.

Giving this 4 stars for the original recipe, and 5 stars for the one I used the second time after making some modifications. After reading other reviews, I followed the suggestion to increase the amount of seasonings.... I doubled everything but the cinnamon (I cut this amount in half because it made the meat a little too sweet the first time). After cooking the pork shoulder for the 10 hours on low, I removed it from the slow-cooker, shredded the meat, placed it in a baking dish, and put it in the oven (preheated at 400•F) for 10 mins. I then pulled out the dish and stirred the meat so that I could get a more even "crispiness". I put it back in for another 10 minutes and served. The wife can't wait to have it again.

AMAZING! Followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers and doubled the spices, except for the cinnamon which I think we could even use a little less of since the cinnamon flavor was pretty strong at the end. We also cut the pork into 2 inch cubes and added diced jalapenos and garlic cloves for cooking. Cooked for 8 hours on low and it turned out extremely tender and very delicious. Great recipe - thanks!

This recipe is five stars with the changes I made. I'm a beginnng cook so I took the advice of others and doubled the spices. Asked my mom, who is mexican, about the cinnamon and she said cinnamon in carnitas was unheard of so I excluded it. I also added a pinch or two of cayenne pepper because my husband needs to have a bit of spice in his food, but I can't handle anything too spicy. It came out delicious.

Omitted the cinnamon and used beef broth instead (just enough to cover 1/8 inch of bottom); also added a quartered onion scattered around the pork.  Serve with steamed tortillas, crumbled queso fresco, cilantro, avocado, lime, and tomatoes...sooooooo good!!!

The first night I made these the cinnamon was very apparent, not bad but it had a distinctive cinnamon taste. The leftovers however were even better than the first night. My hubby and I ate this for 4 meals n a row, as pork tacos and pork burrito bowls, and it was so good I actually looked forward to eating it for lunch and dinner 2 days in a row!

So very good! Wish I made more than a 2-pound pork loin roast. I did as others suggested and crisped it up for 10 minutes in a 400-degree oven. It dried it out a little bit too much for our tastes, but we all still devoured it. Maybe I was supposed to put it back in the juices after crisping it up! Next time, I think I'll forgo the oven and just serve it from the slow-cooker. A big winner!

This was easy to make and very tender.  I made as directed but doubled spices and threw in a can of green chiles with the chicken broth.  I might try a can of Rotel or some cayenne next time for a bit of heat.

I followed the recipe but double all spices except cinn.  I put in one can of chicken broth and no water. Perfect! Did crisp in the oven at 400 for 15 min. This will be a regular addition in our house. Thanks for a great recipe.

So, so, so good. Just made this recipe for the second time today and I can't stop picking it off the pan and snacking on it.  I took the advice of many others and tripled all the spices EXCEPT for the cinnamon. DO NOT leave the cinnamon out! It really adds to the rounded flavor of the meat, it's just so delicious.  I also put in 3 teaspoons of chili powder to kick up the spice a little. I took the remaining juices (sans fat) and put it in a saucepan, added a little cornstarch, and boiled it while I was shredding and crisping the meat up (20 - 30 mins to get a really good gravy going). Adding some of this to the meat makes the flavor THAT much more amazing and moistens it really well.  I highly recommend popping the carnitas into the oven at 400 for 15 - 20 minutes, it crisps up the edges and is well, well worth the extra wait.  This is my staple carnitas recipe now, I wouldn't dream of using another one!

I used a 2.6 lb pork shoulder butt, but used the amount of seasonings for a 6 lb roast, except I omitted the cinnamon and didn't scale up the salt.  I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic, and a few sprigs of fresh cilantro.  After shredding the meat into smaller chunks, I spread it out evenly across a baking pan previously used to make bacon (bacon grease left on).  After 15-20 minutes in a 400 degree oven, the edges of the meat had a nice crispness.  Served this with fresh made pico de gallo and avocado salad with bacon from this site as recommended by another reviewer.  Everyone thought it was excellent, including a picky 5 year old!

this is the closest ive ever come to authentic carnitas. i did double the spices, but i spilt it in half, and coated the chunks of pork in half the spices and seared them till they had some color, then once i got them in the crockpot i put the rest of the spices in, and i only used one bay leaf. was great on flour tortillas with mexican rice.

We thought this was absolutely delicious! I did cut way back on the cumin as I feel that a whole tsp. would have overpowered the dish and I also added in some chili powder and chopped onions. From others reviews I noticed that many skipped the cinnamon and I'm glad I used it as it added a subtle but very nice background flavor. Served these wrapped up in jalapeno cheddar flour tortillas. This is a keeper and thank you!

This is the way I always cook carnitas. YUM :) Great especially after a long work day. Makes plenty for the seven of us. I do add a can or two (depenging on size of roast) of salsa verde right beforde serving which ad ds a punch of flavor. Also, I skip the cinnamon since I am allergic.

LOVED IT!!  We live in Vancouver, Canada so it's very hard to come by really good Mexican food. I should know because I lived in San Diego for most of my life and had the convenience of going to mexican taquerias and restaurants whenever I want. Now, this is VERY GOOD!   Followed the other people's suggestions and doubled up on the spices and omitted the cinnamon.  I couldn't find any ground coriander at the grocery store, so I just got a few sprigs of cilantro and laid it on the bottom of the crock pot along with the bay leaves. Also, followed the extra step of shredding the pork and browning it in the 400 degree oven for 30 minutes or until browned.  Served it with warm flour and corn tortillas. DELICIOUS!!!!!

YUM!  So easy and incredibly versatile.  I made this for a dinner party and served with yellow rice, black beans, tortillas, fresh salsa, guacamole and Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce (also from this site).  That cream sauce was the perfect accompaniment to these carnitas!  Thanks so much for the post!

This is one of the best carnitas recipes I've tried and is super easy to prepare. I cooked this prior to a campout and served it as carnitas one night and put it in a chili for the next night. Wouldn't change a thing!

I followed the suggestions of some of the reviews and made the following tweaks...
1. Tripled the rub ingredients, except the cinnamon.
2. Put the rub on the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight.
3. Cooked on low for 8-9 hours (depending upon whether or not somebody was home to turn off the crockpot after 8 hours).
My husband said it was the BEST meal I had ever made in 17 years of marriage.  I saved some of the leftover juices separately for reheating purposes.  This is, thus far, the best recipe I've tried on here!

This came out great. I took the advice of others and tripled the rub. When I served it we used a soft tortilla and added guacamole, sour cream, fresh cilantro, a squeeze of lime, Pico De Gallo and, some shredded cheddar (it's all I had). Really, Really good. Great flavors and it smelled wonderful.

This recipe is excellent. Even my picky family loved it. The changes I made were to double the spices (except the salt and cinnamon). I also added 3/4 teaspoon of dried cilantro. In addition, I followed several other's advice and wrapped the spiced rubbed pork in Sarah wrap and refrigerated it overnight so the spices would permeate all of the meat. And instead of 2 cups of chicken broth, I used 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup of regular coke. When I turned the meat, I used the juice from one lime and put it over the top of the roast. Then after shredding the meat, I spread it out in a thin layer on a cookie sheet and baked it in a 400 degree oven about 15 minutes. Thanks for the receipe and for all the reviewers who made many of the above suggestions. I will most definitely make this dish again!

This is a great carnitas recipe.  You can make it in the slow cooker or in a heavy dutch oven on either the stove top or in the oven.  I like to sear the meat on every surface I can to a good crusty brown, I usually double the seasoning (go a little light on the cinnamon) and coat coat in half the seasoning rub before searing and then sprinkle the rest on top before the main cooking event. I also add the juice of a lime and 1/2 cup of orange juice, reducing the chicken broth by half a cup.  It takes about 3-4 hours on the stove,after searing on medium high heat, reduce to low to simmer.  If you need to, once meat is tender, cook uncovered to reduce the juices but not too much, you don't want to dry it out.

Found a way to shake up Mexican night in our house! Everyone in the family loves this. We serve it up on corn tortillas that are fried in oil for 30 seconds and garnish like tacos. I won't bother tearing apart the intricacies of this recipe...just do what you want with the meat to make the flavor your own! I started with this recipe and have added and subtracted as I see fit.

There are already so many terrific reviews, so I'll just agree with them.  I did use a pork loin, trimmed of excess fat, as that is what I had on hand.  We ate this alone and in burritos, and it was a huge hit with the family.  We'll make this over and over.  Great, simple recipe!

We loved this easy recipe.  One of those recipes that makes the house smell so good while it is cooking.  I threw in some red, orange, and yellow bell peppers at the end, (to get some veggies into my husband).   I served the carnitas with salsa and chili peppers on corn tortillas.  We will be serving this at our World Cup parties.

I had an 8lb pork loin and was uneasy about cooking it in a slow cooker since it is so lean but I'm glad I took the chance. I've read many reviews in regards to too little seasoning and I can never put a roast in the slow cooker without searing it on all sides first. I sliced an onion, smashed 5 cloves of garlic and browned them in a bit of oil. Removed garlic and onion from pan and seared all sides of my generously salt & peppered roast to a golden brown. I mixed all dry ingredients (quadrupled amounts, minus the salt). Yes I even quadrupled the cinnamon which is a MUST!! Can't imagine anyone rating this recipe without adding all the ingredients!! My family loves spice so when I read the reviews regarding lack of, I quadrupled even though I only doubled the size of the roast. Placed 4 bay leaves on bottom of slow cooker, added rubbed roast to slow cooker topped with sliced onion and garlic mixture and sprinkled a bit of adobe on top of that. Added 4 cups of chicken broth, covered and cooked on lowest setting (10 hours). After 5 hours I checked my roast as I didn't want a dried out loin and it was already falling apart smelling DELICIOUS! I removed meat and pulled it all apart and added more adobe, a few good shakes of kosher salt, squeezed 2 fresh limes and chopped a huge bunch of fresh cilantro and spread that over meat and broth~NOT ENOUGH SEASONING! Let it cook a bit longer, served on heated tortillas & toppings with Spanish rice & beans. NEXT TIME I WILL ADD HEAT! Thanks

I have made this several times.  It is so easy to serve along with toppings to build your own burritos.  Great for visitors or we also did this for Super Bowl.  A real hit.  I do double the spices and cut the meat into chunks (about 2-3 inches square) so that they really get coated in the seasoning.  Also cut the salt in half, you really don't need that much.  Delicious!

Mmmm, good!  We really enjoyed this.  I doubled the spices (including the cinnamon but not the salt) and cut my 4 lb. roast in half as suggested to get more spices on the surface of the meat.  I didn't turn it because I didn't feel it needed to be turned, plus I didn't want the whole thing submersed in the liquid.  I was afraid at first that it was burning on the top, but it wasn't.

I removed it from the liquid to shred and skimmed the fat off the juices.  I took reviewers suggestions and placed some of the meat in a pan with some juices and baked it to crisp it up.  I didn't care for that, it just dried out the meat, so next time I won't do that.

I served this with the Avocado Salad from this site and that was a really good complement to the pork.  I also made spanish rice and used another reviewer's suggestion to use the liquid from the pork to cook it in.  Yum!

We wrapped it in tortillas with the avocado salad, a little cheese and sour cream.  It would also be good serving it over spanish rice with the salad or other toppings.

Will definitely make this again!  The prep was quick and easy; the most time I spent was shredding the pork!  Thanks for sharing.

This was a great recipe to cook up and portion out in freezer bags to have on hand for other recipes.  I made just a few minor changes.  First, I used the boneless pork rib meat because its what I had, and it is amazingly cheap as well.  Second, I cut way back on the cinnamon as I thought it would be overpowering otherwise.  Just a  pinch was all it needed.  Otherwise, wonderful recipe and am planning on a repeat performance tomorrow.

I doubled the spices and put on the gas grill on 400 degrees for about 5 minutes on each side, just long enough to give it a nice seared look then put it in the slow cooker. I pulled it apart as it cooked so the seasoning and juices permeated all the meat. We made fajitas with it and served with Spanish rice using a cup of the broth as someone else suggested.

This was easy and quick to prep before work, leave on, and come home to a tasty meal. I made it and served with homemade black beans, and a Israeli couscous, orzo, and quinoa mix. Husband loves mixing it with barbecue or ketchup, but I like it as is.

This was so incredible.  So simple and delicious!  We have a chili recipe that uses many of the spices in this recipe, including cinnamon, which adds such a great flavor to any meal, it's my favorite spice!  The house smelled great 30 minutes after I started this, and I cooked it quicker since I just found this recipe 2 hrs. before dinnertime.  I sliced a pork loin, about 4 lbs. into 4 sections and cooked it on high for 2 hrs, then lowered the crock pot to low and cooked the rest a couple of hours more just to see how it would work out.  It was awesome after 2 hrs!  We sliced it thin and wrapped them in a flour tortilla with a bit of homemade salsa, sour cream and just a bit of cojack cheese...so incredible!  Will make again...maybe today!!  We also added some chopped onion (about 1/2 cup), and thinly sliced peppers(about 1 cup) while it was cooking ~ yummy!

This was so simple and so delicious.  I like a little citrusy taste so I added two oranges, cut in half and squeezed, to the braising liquid.  We used 5 pounds of pork shoulder and I doubled the spices (based on reviews) but next time would probably add some kind of spice with kick like adobo chili powder, and definitely more salt.  I served them with tortillas (soft and chips), salsa, avocado, lime, refried beans, and spanish rice for a make your own taco dinner.  The next day my husband made me quesadillas with some of the leftovers and they were to DIE for.  I will most definitely be making this again in the future and then portioning and freezing the left overs - there are so versatile and delicious.  Thank you, Erin!

This was ok.  I did add two small peppers because I like the heat but overall this recipe was kind of bland as written.  I used the carnitas mostly in burritos with some mexican rice and shredded cheese but by itself, it was just plain shredded pork.  We did use some to make pulled pork sandwiches and that was good, mostly due to the bbq sauce we drizzled over the meat.  I may try this again with more seasoning.

We used steak because it's what we had on hand.  Doubled the spices except cinnamon, coated the meat, threw in a chopped onion and some garlic, wrapped it all up in foil and poured homemade broth around it.  Cooked for about 7 hours and then baked it in the oven for about 30 minutes with plenty of juice.  Used the rest of the juice for Mexican rice.  This was unbelievably delicious.  Thanks!

I just made this for the first time tonight and didn't change a thing other than using a clove of fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder.  The meat came out perfectly tender and moist, shredding very easily after ten hours on low.  I spooned a little of the liquid from the crock over the shredded pork, not because I thought it was dry, but for flavor.  I served it with homemade tortillas, cilantro, avocado, and other taco-type fixings and it was wonderful!  I will definitely be making this over and over again.

I made this receipe to the T, the only thing i had to substitute was the chicken broth, I used beef broth instead I didnt have any chicken broth. Also once the meet was done cooking, I shredded it, threw it on a baking pan at 400degrees and baked it for 20 mins to make it crispy, like authentic carnitas. My Husband is Mexican, and VERY Hispanic at that. He knows good Mexican food.. Well HE LOVED THIS!! he usually criticizes my Hispanic food but he had nothing to say about this one! :) Thank you for the amazing recipe!

I doubled the spices as my roast was a bit larger. I also did not use chicken broth since pork gives out its own juices in the crockpot. I did add chili powder and a can of original Rotel. I think it was great, but I will use more salt and less cinnamon next time. We served it on tortillas, both flour and corn and the kids even added beans and cheese to theirs. Very good.

Good recipe and well worth making,BUT one warning the Cinnamon kind of ruins the recipe,I would use just a sprinkle if you like Cinnamon on your meats,Myself next time I make it it(which I will) I will delete the Cinnamon altogether

Turned out great.  I also doubled the spices per the other reviews.  Even though there is very little cinnamon in the recipe, it does add a very pronounced flavor to the meat that I was not fond of.  In future attempts, I will omit the cinnamon but everything else about it was wonderful.

excellent recipe, thanks.  Made almost exactly per recipe but did double the spices (except for cinnamon) and added the juice of 2 lemons at the end.  Next time will leave out the cinnamon entirely.

Best pork I've ever made.  I bought a 2 lbs boneless roast (only one they had left at the store) so i didn't want to put it in the crock pot all day.  So instead i cooked it at 325 for 2 hours in a roasting bag with 1 cup of chicken stock.  AMAZING!  However because of the way i cooked it i didn't shred it for tacos.  Will be making this on a regular basis.

Very good. I used pork tenderloin and doubled all spices except the cinnamon.  I then made a gravy with the liquid in the pot towards the end of cooking time and added it back in the pot after shredding the pork.  Served on soft kaiser rolls.

I followed this recipe except I didn't have the corriander or the cumin.  In place of it I used 1/4tsp., roasted chopped garlic and 1/2 tsp. tyme.  The aroma in my house was just out of this world.  I cooked this yesterday for the 2012 New Years dinner.  I put it on at 2:30 A.M. B4 I went to bed.  Turned it over when I got up at 10:00.  It was so tender and fell off the bone by 1:00 P.M.  My daughter called and her faucet handle broke off in her kitchen and flooded her house.  So my husband had to go take care of it.  We all finally got to eat at 5:00 and the roast did beautiful even staying on warm for 4 extra  hours.  This will now be my go to recipe for a pork roast.  And I won't wait until 2013 to fix this again either.  Left overs were fantastic too!

I followed the advice of others and tripled the seasoning ingredients.  I also cut the roast up into a few smaller pieces, due to limited cooking time.  Instead of cooking the meat in the crockpot, I cooked it in the oven at 325 degrees, then shredded the meat and put it back in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 min to crisp!  It was delicious and so easy to make!!

This is my go to carnitas recipe and everyone loves it. I just realized when my boyfriend's mom asked me for the recipe that I had never saved, rated, or reviewed it. Awesome recipe. definitely double the rub except the cinnamon and don't skip putting them in the oven after they are done! Thanks for this great recipe I will be making for the rest of my life!

I used pork tenderloin, and it cooked in the slow cooker for 6 hours.  It was great, although not as interesting as I thought it might be.

Excellent combination of flavours. The meat shredded nicely and absorbed the liquid. The leftovers were even better the next day after the ingredients had more time to blend. I will certainly make this again, but will be more dilligent in trimming the fat off the pork before cooking next time. There was a thick layer of fat on top when I took the leftovers out of the fridge.

this was excellent.  Carnitas is always a favorite of ours.  I used 2 2.5 lb roasts, doubled the seasoning on each roast, but no cinnamon.  Didn't have bay leaves. Added sprigs of cilantro on the side in the broth.   Also I did the roasting trick someone recommended yummy..  Definitely do many times again.

I rated this a 4 because I made a few changes similar to others. Omitted the cinnamon, used beef broth and pork butt instead for more flavor. It's an easy recipe so you can't go wrong.

Pretty good. I used my pressure cooker, which made it nice and fast! To crisp up the meat and make it more carnitas-like I like to cut it up into smaller bits and brown it in a little lard before serving in tacos or burritos.  Tastes a bit more authentic with the lard.

It tasted so great and I had enough for multiple meals since we are 4 adults. My daugther loved that no onion was called for in this recipe. I also did not use coriander (cilantro) since my more than one of us is allergic to it.

This dish was awesome!  I really loved the flavors with just that hint of cinnamon coming thru. I first used the meat inside flour tortillas and the flavor got lost. I mixed the leftover meat in with Mexican rice and it was much better this way, especially since the flavor of the meat was better the second day.

SUPERB! I made it exactly as written, and it was super easy to boot.  As a personal preference, next time I will reduce the salt, and believe me, there WILL be a next time.  Thanks for the recipe, Erin.

This was one of the most tender meats ever!!! De-lish!!!  I only had a 2.5lb. cut of shoulder, but kept the 10 serving measurements for all of the other ingredients (except the cinnamon-I halved that) since a lot of people said they doubled the spices.  We thew in some BBQ sauce for pulled pork sandwiches one night and made enchiladas the next night with refried beans, the meat, cheese and enchilada sauce and they were delish.  I will definitely be using this from now on for my pulled pork and I want to try chicken soon!

Fabulous and easy! Definitely double the spice mix (except the salt). I think I used about 3 lbs of meat - pork loin roast is usually better than shoulder.

Amazing. I only used half the pork cause it's just me and my husband. I reduced the broth by half but didn't adjust the seasoning because I like flavor. I also added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper and serrano pepper from my garden for some heat. This recipe is really good. It's not just good for tacos but also on a bun with some BBQ sauce.

I've made this several times now, exactly as listed, and it's been great every time.  I like to bag the shreaded port up in zip-lock bags and freeze it for later eating. Makes great tacos and buritos for lunches.

My carnitas turned out awesome.  I already have family from all over requesting me to make them some when I go to visit.  I highly suggest making your own tortillas to go with it.

I tripled the spices except the salt and cinnamon and was so glad I did!! It still didn't quite have the zing I was looking for so I added the juice of 2 or 3 limes and it helped. Next time I will try adding some jalapenos or try the "Pressure Cooker Carnitas" also on this site. I served it with black beans, rice cooked in the juice from the meat and pico de gallo. It was very good, but not as good as I hoped!

5 Stars!  This was delicious.  Following the suggestions of a couple of other reviewers, I doubled the spices (except the cinnamon), cut the pork into large chunks, and after cooking in the slow cooker, baked the pork in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes to achieve the traditional carnitas crispiness - delicious!  My husband and two kids (4 and 1 year old) both loved it too.

Another endorsement of this recipe! I doubled the rub quantities and it was the perfect amount for a 3.5 lb. piece of meat. I also cut the meat into three pieces and browned it in a cast iron skillet. I then deglazed the pan with some Sprite, yes the soda! The little bit of sweetness added a great flavor. My son worked at restaurant where they marinated carnitas in Coke, so use what you have.

A great base for small and effortless batches of Carnitas! Much better for a couple looking to brew some glorious pork bites than busting out the copper pot, all the lard, etc... A local restaurant owner gave me his recipe, so I blended the two. It's an optional brine marinade 1 - 5 days that uses most of the spices found here. Added the juice of two oranges, one lime, sea salt, and removed the cinnamon. 

Finally I just need my carnitas to be crispy on the edge. When adding the chicken broth to the pot (great idea!) I also throw in 2-4 tablespoons of seasoned lard. When it finishes I break up the meat as prescribed and use my seasoned bacon pan to fry the meat. I added less than a tablespoon of lard to the bacon pan, just enough to coat it, before dropping in the tender crock pot pork. The moisture cooks off just a little bit and you end up with the crispiest taco cart style carnitas you ever wanted. OMG! is this good! This was about my 10th attempt at Carnitas perfection. I can't tell you how much easier it is in the crock pot than it is watching the copper pot and using 3 lbs of lard! :) 

Definitely making this one again, maybe I'll share next time!

Restaurant quality, amazing! Omitted cinnamon, didn’t have ground coriander so I used back of spoon to crush whole coriander. Roasted in oven at 325, loosely covered, for 2.5 hours, then shredded meat, then cooked at 400 for another 15 minutes. Perfect!

Hello flavor. These were bursting with flavor, moist and falling apart and down right the best carnitas I have ever had! Only thing I changed is the cooking time. They were done in 4 hours on low in my slow cooker.

I give this recipe 2 stars. Being from San Diego I have tasted many different carnitas. This one tastes like middle eastern or indian food because of the spice combination. It doesn't taste anything like authentic mexican carnitas. I would have given it only one star but the meat did come out very moist and tender so the method is good but the seasoning way off.

Amazing carnitas at home!  Better than many restaurants I've eaten in!  I forgot the cinnamon and didn't notice.  Added a can of diced tomatoes b/c it sounded good.  It tasted VERY good!

Very easy.  After cooking meat in crock pot. I shredded meat on cookie sheet, sprinkled with garlic salt and chipolte chili powder, then drizzled sparingly with olive oil and baked in 400 degree oven for 15 minutes, which made the edges of the meat crispy.  Made good burritos.

Phenomenal!!! Man, another great carnitas from this site. As suggested, I tripled the ingredients except the broth which btw used chicken buillon instead. Because of the buillon, I cut down the salt a bit. I had to omit the cinnamon...its just me. It was so worth getting that last ingredient for this recipe which was the coriander....so worth the trip! Thanks...my house smells good!

This is my new favorite recipe. I LOVE it. I followed the advice of many before me and tripled all of the spices except for the cinnamon. I also used a bone in pork shoulder for more flavor, and took the advice of laying it out on a cookie sheet after shredding it and putting it in the oven for 20 minutes on 350 degrees to caramelize some of the pieces. Super yum!!

Update: Have made this since in my cast-iron dutch oven (325 degrees, 2.5 hours) and was able to achieve the same results and tenderness with FAR less time. Also quadrupled the garlic. Muy bueno!

I loved this and it was so easy! I took other peoples' advice and doubled all the spices except for cinnamon. Additionally I added 1 tsp rubbed sage and 2 tsp onion powder. I cut the roast in to three pieces and coated them all with the spices. I only added 1/2 can (8 oz) of chicken broth, which was plenty of liquid. For cooking, I was short on time so I did 3 hrs on high and 3 on low. It was beautiful! I did throw it in the oven to crisp it up a bit but I would eat it either way.   I made this for guests and they were impressed! Will make again and again!

We LOVE this recipe in our house. We've made it three times now, twice for guests, and it always gets rave reviews (and people always have seconds and thirds). We do triple the amount of spices, and it gives the pork just the right flavor (carnitas should be very mild - nearly bland, but oh so delicious). After 10 hours in the slow cooker, we shred the meat, lay it on a baking sheet, and put in the top rack of the oven at 375 for about 6 minutes. Gives it that slight crispiness that make carnitas so good. We serve with crock-pot black beans, roasted corn, and make a taco bar - corn tortillas, fresh avocado, onions, tomatoes, cheese, plain Greek yogurt (in place of sour cream or crema fresca), and plenty of lime and cilantro. Great meal for guests (easy, can be done ahead of of time), and great for just the two of us since we enjoy leftovers the rest of the week!

I pulled up this recipe on April 13.  I enjoyed it then, but toasted my carnitas too much after cooking.  Will do less, next time.  They came out of the cooker just nice, but others had suggested that they should be toasted.  Be watchful and careful.  I did NOT shred.  As a guest, at a Mexican fiesta one evening, I was introduced to carnitas.  They are, in fact, little meats, and should remain that way---tasty morsels of pork.

If I could give this more stars, I would. My family ate 2 slow cookers worth and the little bit they did leave left, they ate for breakfast... BREAKFAST! Are you serious?? LOL It was a great hit! I left out the coriander because I was out (and didn't know it) and used fresh cilantro instead. Still was superb. Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy!  I loved the flavor that the cinnamon added.  My husband and I both like our carnitas with a little crunch, so after it was done in the slow cooker, I put it in a frying pan with a little oil to get the outside nice and crispy.  Just served with some fresh pico de gallo, cilantro and tortillas.  Delicious!

Super easy and delicious!  I did not add the salt and used 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth.  Also, balled up foil and put the roast on top of that so that it wasn't sitting in all the juices.  A great way to make a toughter cut of meat.  Very versatile, too!  Made carnitas, BBQ sandwiches and also served plain with rise & veggies.  A keeper.

Husband loves Mexican food.  And he LOVED this.  So much so that he requested that I keep making it.  I made per the recipe.  The only change I would suggest it to place the meat on a rack  (or balls of tin foil) to keep it our of the rendering fat.

Tried this last night and LOVED it!! I took the advice of previous reviews and increased the amount of the rub by about 50% with the exception of the cinnamon, which I kept at about 1/4 teaspoon and only used about a 1 1/2 cups broth. Next time I think I'll leave the cinnamon out as I wasn't thrilled with that flavor in my carnitas. When it came time for dinner, I chunked the roast into big pieces and then broiled it for about 5 minutes to get the edges crusty. AMAZING!! My family said it tasted better than the carnitas at our favorite Mexican restaurant and I agree! Served with tortillas, beans, cheese and avocados. YUMMERS!! Froze the leftovers for quesadillas!

It was OK. Very tender meat but next time I would leave out the cinnamon.  My family did not care for the flavoring.

More than a review it's a comment. Traditionally carnitas are to be eated as taco, with hot corn tortilla. Just add a homemade salsa, chopped cilantro, chopped onion and lemon juice!!

I made some changes as suggested by others but somehow missed the suggestion to triple the spices- which I will do next time.  I cut the meat into chunks and cooked in the crock pot for the day.  I shredded it and put it in the fridge overnight.  The next night for dinner I put the shredded meat on a cookie sheet and in the oven at 400-degrees for 10 minutes which heated it up well and made it crispy.  I used the meat in burritos and it was great.  I will make it again but add a lot more spice and also cook it in the crock pot with a few onions.

I left out the cinnamon and I cut the roast into chunks.  I also increased the spices. Otherwise I followed the recipe.  As suggested by another reviewer, we topped it with the 'Avacado Salad with Sour Cream and Bacon',  and also diced tomatoes.  My family loved it.  It was superb.

LOVE this recipe!!  It is soooo easy to prepare.  The seasonings are right on.  Husband & kids gave a huge "stamp of approval" on this one. I did add a little chili powder & tossed 4 or 5 whole garlic pieces in the chicken broth.  I saw someone added a little fresh cilantro.. that sounds good?!  I will try that next time :).

This came out great - I tripled the spices and rubbed it on the meat the night before (I left out the cinnamon).  The next morning I put it in the slow cooker with four cracked cloves of garlic and left it in all day, it fell apart when I tried to take it out of the crock pot.  I added some of the juice back into the shredded meat as some reviewers suggested and seasoned with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder and made tacos.  For some reason I think of carnitas as having more of a tomato-y sauce?  As for the leftovers, I may try baking them in the oven as some suggested.  Thanks for an easy recipe that works really well!

I made a beef version of this recipe.  Used chuck meat (~3 lb), 1/2 c. beef broth instead of chicken, plus added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis.  11 hours in the crock and it turned out fabulous.  even better the next day!

I've made this twice now. The first time I used a pork butt and doubled the rub (except cinnamon), followed another reviewers advice and used cilantro instead of coriander, and crisped it up in the oven for a few minutes afterwards. It was melt-in-your mouth great! This time I used a pork shoulder (picnic roast). It was an 8 lber but had a bone. So I deboned it as best as I could and ended up with several good sized chunks. I tripled the rub (except for cinnamon - I doubled it) and it was just enough. I only used one can of chicken broth and that was plenty. The shoulder turned out delicious as well, so just buy whatever is on sale! Butts are usually cheaper, so go with that if you can(did I just say that? haha)

This was actually quite good. I tripled the seasonings, except the salt. 1 tsp of salt is more than enough since the chicken broth also has salt.  I also broke up the pieces after 10 hours, placed in 9X13 glass dish and baked at 400 degrees until the meat was crispy enough for us(I did add alittle juice from the crockpot so it didn't dry out too much). The pork was excellent for mexican dishes or on rolls as a sandwich
with BBQ sauce.

This is good. We have a friend who makes authentic carnitas in a hand pounded copper pan over an open fire pit. We have been spoiled, but as I say this is good and will do in the mean time. I did take one reviews advice and fry it after taking it out of the crockpot.

This carnitas was awesome. I made this for my boyfriend who is super picky and he loved it. We made tacos and served it with some rice on the side. I also made some salsa and cut up some onions to top the tacos......it was awesome! This recipe was easy and tasted great..I will defintely be making more of this recipe.

It was really good. I had to take it out about an hour and a half shy of the 10 hour recommended cooking period so they were somewhat tough, but still good overall. I would definitely recommend doubling the spices though, except maybe the cinnamon; it's flavorful, but not quite flavorful enough. I'd also cut up the meat 5 hours in when you're turning it because it helps the broth saturate the meat and gives it more flavor. 

For anyone that's curious, this recipe yields about 10 cups and, with the tortilla, one serving (1/2 cup of meat) was 202 calories, 2.5g saturated fat, 15 carbs, and 16g of protein. 

How I'd eat it: 1/2 cup of meat on corn tortillas with sour cream and cilantro.
 - broil the meat for about 5-10 minutes
 - cook the corn tortillas for about 30 seconds each side on a pan that's been heated to low-medium heat

Made this twice. First time I fried the meat after shredding. That was yummy, but not very healthy. Then last night I tried the baking method and it was just as good, if not better. I used beef broth, didn't have chicken, and it worked just fine. I boiled down the broth to thicken it up, then poured over the shredded meat before placing in the oven, 450 for 15 minutes. Doubled the seasonings, excluded the cinnamon, and added half an orange to the crockpot. Yum! Serve on tortillas or plain with pico de gallo, rice, and black beans. Oh! Also used the broth to cook the black beans in. Delish.

Excellent! I also doubled all the spices (except the cinnamon) as suggested by others.  Really wonderful!! Also... I omitted the salt since the broth had salt. (I also omitted the bay leaves and corriander since I didn't have any and it was still awesome)

The ONLY pork carnitas I make for my family.  The smell of it cooking is so delicious and enticing.  This is an amazing recipe.....better than Chipotle Restaurant and frankly, any Mexican restaurant carnitas we've ever had.  We never order carnitas when we go out to eat; instead we make this.  It's the #1 food I get asked for by my family.  Can easily be doubled in a lg crockpot.  (Sometimes I double the amt of spices for the rub if I have a good size 5-8# roast.  Can use bone-in roast but easier, of course, to use boneless but the bone-in is less expensive.)  I'd give this 10 stars if I could.

I've made this recipe multiple times almost as-is, with the exception that I add a 1/2 tsp of onion powder. I think its pretty amazing. I also fry up the meat under a broiler for a few minutes to get it nice and brown, so yummy.

I completely revised this recipe. Cinnamon seemed odd because it wouldn't give this type of recipe a smoked, spicy taste. To accomplish my goal I used a combination of 1/4 tsp allspice, doubled the garlic (fresh, minced), and then added 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1.5 tablespoons chipotle powder. I doubled the cumin and kept the salt about the same. I also kept the bay leaves to 2 and doubled the oregano. Finally, I doubled the coriander but decreased the stock. After 6 hours on high I added more stock and turned the meat over. It was a complete hit in our household!

If you LOVE Chipotles than you must try this recipe. I'm a Chipotle's fan and love going there but with that said this recipe taste just like you're there minus their prices. Like most of the other reviews that I read I didn't add the cinnamon and it turned out GREAT !!!!  I used a four pound shoulder that the butcher cut into cubes.

Doubled the spices as many had suggested. I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic powder. I think next time I'll skip the cinnamon. I did need to add water because I live at high altitude. After I removed the dish from the slow cooker, I put it in the oven on 400 for 20 minutes. I poured the leftover juices over the roast to keep it moist. Tonight we will have these in enchiladas. Yummy!

A permanent fixture in my collection, my go to recipe for holidays and large parties, I usually triple all the spices except salt and hardly ever even use one cup of broth. Outstanding!

I have never made carnitas before and this turned out great.  I used a 2 lb. pork loin roast and cooked it about 6 hours on low.  I used the original/full amount of seasoning though and, quite frankly, could have even used more.  I did omit the cinnamon based on other reviews and added some chili powder instead.  The meat came out really, really tender.  I served it burrito-style with tomatillo salsa and fresh chopped onion and cilantro.  Will most definitely be making this again!

Absolutely AMAZING!  Listened to previous posters and doubled up the seasoning.  Also let it "sink in" overnight before putting it in slow cooker in the morning.  Pork literally fell apart and super easy to get the fatty parts out

My husband always orders carnitas when we eat a Mexican restaurant, so I thought I would try this recipe for him. I loved the fact it was cooked in the slow cooker. For me, it needed more salt, but the meat was very tender. My husband's verdict:Perfect!!!!

My family lived this recipe, although if you like heat you'll have to add it.  I added chili powder, but next time might try some hot sauce.  I also used some for BBQ pulled pork by adding my favorite BBQ sauce to some of it and simmering it together in a sauce pan.  Excellent recipe.

Wow, was this easy and GOOD!  Followed other reviewers' suggestions to double the seasoning (except for the cinnamon) and I'm glad I did.  I also cut the large shoulder roast I had into three pieces to allow for better penetration of the rub.

This is good - not sure if the flavor is authentic or not, it does seem a little off to me, but I have made it twice and it is pretty decent.  I top with a squeeze of lime and some lettuce and it's pretty okay!

I doubled the spice mix and set half aside. Rubbed the pork with half the mix, cooked it in the crockpot then shredded it. When I was ready to serve I heated 1 T olive oil in a large skillet until just shimmering, then added the reserved spices and cooked for 30 seconds or so, then added the pork and tossed until just crispy. Delicious and moist!

I doubled the seasonings, left out cinnamon, added chipotle powder. It was great!  We need to find a way to crisp the meat as carnitas cooked in the traditional cooper pot would have.

This made an exceptional filling for enchiladas. I did eyeball the spice and herbs and maybe put in a bit more than specified. The bay and cinnamon gave a nice flavor to the meat. I did add in a chopped onion with the meat and at the end after shredding some chopped green chili and let it simmer on low another 40  min. to absorb all the juice. Made green chili pork enchiladas that would knock your flip flops off your feet.

I made this today following the advice of naples34102 and serving it Burrito bowl style as suggested by her daughter Sweetooth122 and to describe it as amazing would be and understatement. I don't think it could have been any easier to make something so delicious. I  put it in the crock pot before we went to church this morning and it was perfect by the time we got home. My whole family enjoyed it. We added a sweet corn salsa, guacamole and sour cream and WOW. This is a keeper and has made it into my monthly dinner rotation.

I always try to make a recipe "as written"; that is the case with this with the exception of cooking time.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours, then turned it down to low for 4 hours.  It turned out perfect, literally coming apart as I removed it from the pot.  None of us, dog included, could hardly leave it alone until today (Super Bowl day).  Today I will saute up some onions, peppers and chilies to go along side for those who like them, and of course the grated cheese, sour cream, etc.  Thanks for sharing Erin; I will make this again!

I am surprised I haven't reviewed this yet - this is my 4th time making it, and my daughter's most requested recipe!  She loved the smell when it was cooking, and calls it my "pumpkin pie pork" for it smelled like that (to her) while cooking... must have been the cinnamon and she says it tastes better than pumpkin pie. Actually, all my kids love this.  I serve it over rice with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of cheese.  Don't worry, the cinnamon doesn't make it taste weird, or anything - just a nice depth of flavor. Yum.

Don't leave out the cinnamon! It makes this recipe. I used a pork loin and cut into pieces. Added 1/2 chopped onion. I ended up with a lot of broth so last 30 min turn on high with lid off. If you want a bit thicker add cornstarch and water mixture.

Cook once, eat twice!  I love these kind of recipes.  I made this yesterday using a pork tenderloin.  The only thing I left out was the coriander, because I didn't have any. Cooked it in the slow cooker on medium for 4 hours and it was done.  Shredded easily, and smelled wonderful!  I served it last night over Mexican rice with a bit of salsa on top.  Today I added some BBQ sauce to the rest, and we had BBQ sandwiches tonight for dinner.  Two completely different meals using this cooking method.  Will make this again.  Thanks!

AWESOME. I made this with triple the spices as I had a bigger roast. As far as ratio, it was about double the spices for the 4 pounds of pork that is called for here. You should be able to judge for yourself if you need more spice mixture, it should cover the roast's top and sides. It came out GREAT!!!! Definitely going in the recipe book! We served with cilantro lime rice, black beans, salsa, cheese, sour cream, avocado, lime juice, red onions and cilantro. It literally tasted just like Chipotle's burrito bowl except FRESHER. You NEED to try this!!!! I was in heaven!

Excellent spice combination! I make enough to cover all sides of the meat (usually a bit more than stated here) and omit the cinnamon. When it's done, I slice up onions and lay them out in a roasting pan, then layer the carnitas on top and bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. Thanks for the idea, naples34102. The carnitas come out nice and crispy and the onions absorb all the juices and are a great add-on for tacos or taquitos. This is my favorite slow-cooker recipe and fantastic for company! Thanks so much for posting it!

This is fantastic!  After reading the other reviews I doubled the rub and added 1 t. ancho pepper and 1 t. chipotle pepper powder.  It turned out great.  I used the pork for grilled quasidillas one night and on nachos another.  Will definately make this again.

This is an easy, delicious recipe.  I used a bone-in pork shoulder because I've found bones add flavor.  I added a bit of chipotle powder and halved the cinnamon called for, then crisped the meat in the oven at the end like so many reviewers recommended, and absolutely love the aroma and flavor.

this is awesome.  I did triple spices.  Omitted cinnamon and coriander.

Thank you.  Great way to cook pork steaks or roasts.

Smelled wonderful and tasted fantastic.  I tripled the spices except cinnamon.  I only double the salt and used 1 ea 14oz can of chicken broth.  I also added some poblano peppers and onions to the slow cooker.  Cinnamon makes this unique.  I liked it but I could see some people not being much of a fan.

Wow, is this recipe awesome.  I was searching in the store for a food idea when I came across a package listed as Pork Carnitas.  So I immediately took out my phone and looked for a recipe and found this one.  Seemed easy enough so I gave it a try.  Am I glad I did.  This is the best pork slow cook dinner I have ever made and my family absolutely loved it.  So easy and the flavors are out of this world.  You will not be disappointed.

This meat was tender and had very good flavor.  The recipe is very versatile and will be my go to recipe for Carnitas.   I didn't have coriander, so possibly the taste will change the next time I make it. (I now have the coriander).  We had tacos the first night for dinner, then barbecued pulled pork sandwiches for the 2 next nights.  I sauteed onions until they were carmelized to pile on top of the meat in the sandwich.  When I heated up the pulled pork I added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (our fav) and used Ciabbetta rolls for the bread.  Along with cole slaw and baked beans, this made a really enjoyable meal.

The recipe doesn't call for cutting off the fat, but I did and my slow cooker didn't take 10 hours to make this tender, so I would advise to check the meat at about 7 hours

I used a butt roast instead of a shoulder roast.  The meat just about melted in your mouth.  Very moist and tender.  I doubled the spices as well, even then they were more on the subtle side.  I used to leftover meat for bbq pork sandwiches.  The seasonings were versatile enough for this.

Tasted this at 10hrs when shredded and there wasn't enough flavor from the spices.  I doubled all but the cinnamon based on other reviews and ended up adding a pkg of taco seasoning and letting it simmer for another hour.  That made a world of difference!

I found the original recipe's seasonings to be great together, but didn't have enough to really coat my roast. doubled (or so) the seasonings but kept the cinnamon amount of 1/4 tspn. also threw in a roughly chopped onion. Took all the juice from the slow-cooker at the end and chilled it to skim some fat then dumped it into the rice-maker with some white rice for some spectacular "almost" spanish rice. 
Made for several days of burritos and tacos and happy mouths. Loved it so much I'm cooking up another roast now (only one week later!) I intend to make a burrito or two then use all the leftover meat to make some taquitos to freeze for later. 
Great recipe! and unbelievably simple.

I really thought my family would like this recipe, especially with all the great reviews. I followed it exactly as written. We did not care for it. It looked good and smelled good but the flavor was very strange. Especially with the cinnamon. Oh well, win some and lose some.

Great flavor! I followed the recipe with two exceptions. I browned the roast first to give it some color and omitted the bay leaves because I didn't have any. Served with warm tortillas, salsa, and mexican rice. It was delicioso!

This is one of our favorite meals.  I read the reviews before I made this the first time, so I doubled the spices per others' comments.  The second time I made it, I again doubled the spices, except kept the salt at the stated amount.  I APPLIED THE RUB THE NIGHT BEFORE and the results were even better!  I have continued doing this in subsequent cookings.  Have made this for friends and family and they are all delighted with the results and amazed that it is so easy.  Thanks to Erin for her recipe!  We're forever grateful!

The carnitas were a huge hit at our superbowl mexican fiesta party.  I had an 8 lb pork shoulder that I probably used 5-6 lbs of in the slow cooker--cut into fist size chunks.  I tripled the spice rub but lightened up on the cinnamon to just 2.5 times.  The smell was divine.  I did pull the meat out and toasted it up in the 400 degree oven for a few minutes before serving with burrito shells and tons of veggies, salsa, cheese, guac, etc.  Had Mexican Rice II and Mexican Bean Salad from Allrecipes as sides.  Everything was just wonderful.

This was so good! I was skeptical at first but it was delicious. I used fresh cilantro instead of coriander and fresh garlic. I also roasted it in the oven for a few minutes after shredding. Served it as tacos with pico de gallo, homemade salsa, and guacamole.

So delicious.  Per everyones recommendation I tripled the spices- plus my pork roast was 7pounds.

I also tried frying some to make edges crunchy as someone else mentioned.  Both were superb!

eh, not sure about the spice quantities, you could probably double them up, as pork REALLY absorbs/diminishes flavors. otherwise, great, everyone loved it. add fresh homemade salsa, avocado, tortilla, hot sauce - awesome.

The spice mix was good, but the pork turned out too dry for my taste. Next time I might try it with more liquid.

It's probably because I used the loin, but the meat was very soft with no texture like original carnitas.

This has wonderful flavor! I think my pork loin roast was closer to 1.5-2 lbs and the spices were perfect. The coriander and cinnamon added a nice touch.

This is sensational! After reading the reviews, I left out the cinnamon, added a teaspoon of chili powder, and made a garlic paste with 4 bulbs. Then doubled the dry spices. Slow cooked on High for 6 hours, shredded, and put into oven for 20 minutes..This is a keeper. YUM.

I liked this recipe. I doubled the spices, cooked for 8 hours and the meat fell apart. Taste was good, probably even better if used as filling for tortas. However, we ate ours in tacos: used corn tortillas, added some chopped pinneapple, jalapeños, onion, cilantro and as a side some refried beans.
However, authentic carnitas recipes all use orange juice and coca cola as ingredients.

I added the step of what one reviewer suggested, shredding the meat and transferring that and some of the fat to a cookie sheet, lined with parchment paper (foil didn't work out so well for me). Bake at 425 for 20 minutes or until the tops are a bit crispy and liquid is absorbed. , it's good!  I believe I used Rump Roast. I'm trying the pork next!

Amazing!  Sooooooo good!  I modifiied this recipe based on other reviews: I used Boston But Roast, cut into 6 large chunks, tripled the spice rub (only doubled the salt, which was plenty) and omitted the cinnamon.  Cooked on Hi for 6 hours in the crock pot and baked on shallow sheet for 20 min at 400.  Could even bake for less time and get plenty of crispy goodness.

This recipe makes me use the 7 letter word!  AMAZING!!!  This was sooooooo good!  I couldn't stop eating it!  i didn't have the comin or oregano.  I used Lawrys seasoning salt, black pepper, garlic powder, coriander, and cinnamon for my rub.  I added the chicken broth and some minced garlic. (I almost used French onion soup, will try that next time)  I took the advise of other reviewers, after cooking, I shredded the meat and put it on a flat pan and placed it in the oven for 15 - 20mins.  OMG!!  This was the best ever!  Everytime a see a Pork Roast I will buy one.

It simmers in it's own fat which made me feel bad/guilty just to eat it.  WAY too salty and I didn't even use the full amount.  I'd have given it 1 star but the boyfriend liked it so I was being kind.  Made exactly the way it was written with the exception of less salt.  Some people talk about their fabulous slow cooker carnitas but if it's anything like this, you can count me out.  Sorry to give a bad review, it's rare for me.

This pork is good and has a mild flavor.  Next time I think I will try spicing it up a bit by adding some chili powder and chipolte peppers.

I doubled the spices and only used a 2 1/2 pound roast, and it still needed more spice, but the spices it did have were excellent.  I followed the suggestion to crisp it up in the oven at the end and would highly recommend it.  Overall a very good recipe!

Pork came out so tender and yummy.  I feel it needed a bit of kick in the seasoning so we may had some spicier spices to it next time.  A nice alternative for tortillas to taco-flavored ground beef/turkey. And, loving the crockpot dinner...done when you get home.

YUM!  My family loved it - some had it on buns while others had it in flour tortillas.  I would like to know more about possible toppings for the tortillas, but will definitely make again!  I also used fresh garlic, not sure if that was what made the difference.  We're not much a fan of salty food, so I was extra cautious of the salt.  I at least doubled the other spices too.

We like spicy so I doubled the seasonings, added a package of Taco Seasoning Mix and left the cinnamon out. I put the pork with dry rub in my pressure cooker added the liquid and cooked for 35 minutes. Fabulous! I'm going to try a beef pot roast next.

Yummo! I tripled the spices as others suggested. Served it with the avacado salad that the reviewer naples suggested. I also baked the meat at 400 degrees for half an hour or so with the juices left over from the crock pot. Topped with lettuce, tomato and cheese. I seriously thought my husband was going to cry when he ate these!

I loved this! I did fresh minced garlic, onion, and jalapeno. I tripled the rub (no cinnamon), added 3 tsp cayenne powder, and cut the pork into chunks. It came out sooooo salty, tho! Does anyone else have the same issue?? I am making this again this week and leaving out the salt in the rub, maybe just the salt in the broth will be enough. The meat was so tender and moist, just fabulous!

Awesome!  I will definitely make this again!  My modifications were minor.  Based on others I doubled the spices, but I also omitted the salt, added cilantro and some onion and used fresh garlic instead of powder (we love garlic).  I also used a bone-in roast and just pulled out the bones.  Delicious!

Great recipe!   I used a little less cinnamon, minced 3 cloves of fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder (as I was out) and added a little chili powder for heat.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and after shredding the meat I placed it in the oven at 400F for about 15 minutes to crisp up a little.  It turned out great!  I will definitely make this again!

This was a huge hit with all my boys. My four year old is typically a picky eater and he ate three small tacos. Nobody complained :) I will make these again for sure. I cooked the pork in the crock pot on high for about 6 hrs and it was falling apart on it's own. I also left out the cinnamon as others said in their reviews.

I hate cleaning the slow cooker so I did a variation using an oven safe frying pan. Great combination of spices added 4 tsp of chili powder and 1/2 tsp of onion powder then coated six 1 inch thick boneless pork loin chops with the mixture, put a nice sear on each side, deglazed the pan with chicken broth, covered and baked in the oven at 350 degrees for about an hour and 20 minutes. Came out moist, tender, and easy to pull apart. Thanks Erin!

So rediculously easy and good! I used a 3 lb bone in pork shoulder with the full amount of spice rub and it was perfect. The cinnamon was prominant, but I didn't mind it. We made delicous burritos with this recipe. Thanks for posting!

i did this with country style pork spare ribs in a heavy cast iron dutch oven.  Also I browned, and simmered for a few hours.  I also addid a little Tiquela to deglaze after I seasoned and browned them before chicken broth.  Great spice mixture

I took everyone's advice and tripled all of the spices.  I should have left the cinnamon out completely, I will next time.  And I'll probably take the cooking time down an hour or so. But this tasted so great, and was a big hit with my boyfriend.  Bonus- it's even better the next day!  I'll be making this again. I'm going to have fun fiddling with the recipe.

Outstanding. Easy to make and no adjustments required. By the end of ten hours my piece of meat readily shredded with the aid of two forks. Tasty too, my kids liked it on hamburger buns with barbeque sauce.

Good flavor. It does seem to dry out easy especially once you crisp it up in the oven so you have keep the leftover sauce handy to moisten.

We make this recipe as-is and love it.  Great great flavor!!!  Oh wait, we don't turn it halfway through.  I put it on in the morning before work and it cooks all day without being turned and it's fine doing it that way.  Other than that, no changes.  Yummy!!!  Having it tonight.  It's in the regular rotation in our home now. Even the kids love the meat when we put it in quesadillas for them.

Good recipe overall, except next time I would leave out the cinnamon, as it's just not to my taste. It was super easy and the meat fell apart nicely.

This recipe was amazing!! I will never lose it. I did triple the spices except the cinnamon which i left the same and i sprinkled a little cayenne pepper. I also took the advice of others and after shredding it I popped in the broiler for about 10 minutes to crisp it.I put the meat into corn tortillas with a squirt of lime and it was PERFECT! I usually love sour cream on things but not this, a little cheese and lime is all you need.

I wish we could give half stars because this feels more like 3.5 stars for me.  The spices were good and the meat was tender but the problem was, most of the spices seemed to end up in the juices in the end and even though I used the juices to "wet" the final product I felt like there wasn't enough carnitas flavor in it.  In other words, it was more just pulled pork (which is still good).   The instructions say to be careful to pour the broth around the roast so as to not remove all the spices but then it also says to turn at 5 hours (which I did) which then leaves all the spices in the broth anyway.  Next time I may take other reviewers suggestions and double the spices to see if that helps.  I would probably not double the cinnamon because the only bit of flavor I could taste was the cinnamon.

This was fabulous! I tripled the spice rub and added coarse chopped cilantro. I also added the fresh juice of one half orange and one half lemon.   It was SO tender and flavorful. Crisping it a bit in the over really gave it a nice crust and this recipe made enough for 2 meals for a family of four with some leftovers for lunch two! Delicious and economical ;)

I'm a big fan of this cut of pork, and this preparation did not disappoint.  If you're trying to sell your house put this on before the open house! The aroma is amazing. I did follow the recommendation from other reviews to up the spices - glad I did.  Also, used fresh garlic and cut the roast into a few larger pieces for maximum spice coverage per other reviewers...great suggestions. We ate this soft taco style w/ fresh pico, avocado, & romaine as well as over rice with some fresh blackeyed peas.  Really tasty - great versatility.  What carnitas should be. Now, about to try out the Kalua Pig recipe using the other half of the enormous pork roast.

I made this two days ago and it was delicious. I doubled up the spice mix and omitted the cinnamon. It works just as well without the Bay leaves. When the ten hours were up, I put it into the oven for 20 mins at 400 degrees F to crisp it up. I think it tasted better than the Carnitas I bought from Costco a last week!

AWESOME!! I didnt have corriander nor bay leaves and this turned out great. I didnt turn it over so a nice spicy "crust" formed on top. I ate with corn tortillas and a black bean/corn relish. DH poured bbq sauce over his for a sandwich! So good and easy, no need for me to try other carnitas recipes. Note: used tbs instead of tsp except for cinamon.

I liked it - hubby not so much.  I cut the cinnamon down to barely a sprinkler and still felt it was strong and seemed out of place.  Def need to go heavier on the other seasonings for a full 4# roast.

Great starter recipe!  Added more bay leaves, lots of crushed garlic, and slices of yellow onion and green bell pepper. I started late, so put slow cooker on high, and meat was tender at end of 5 hours.    Shredded the meat onto cookie sheet as done by another reviewer and crispened the surfaces at 375 deg for about 20 min.  Delicioso!!

I tried this for the first time tonight and it came out excellent!!! I prepared as directed, except I used a bone-in pork shoulder roast and one can of chicken broth. It was very tender and the meat just fell off the fork. I really liked the flavoring too. This might also be good to roast in the oven afterward to get a little crisp on the edges. I bought corn tortillas to eat with it, but I think I will just eat it plain!

I live in El Paso, where Carnitas are prevalent in various styles. I was hoping to find a recipe that I could make at home and avoid going out. Although I love the moist slow cooker style, I am not in love with the flavor. I think it might be the cinnamon that just does not fit. Will try again without the cinnamon next time.

Great rub!  (Based on other recipes, I added some other ingredients to the roast: oranges & Onion.  Also, because I didn't have 10 hours, I roasted it in the oven for 3 hours and then pressure cooked it to get to the "fall off the bone" tenderness.  Finished it off in the broiler to give it the crispiness that my favorite restaurant's carnitas has.)

This recipe is AMAZING! I have been making it for over a year and it always gets rave reviews. It is SO easy! I don't eat a lot of pork, but my fiance loves my carnitas (thanks to this recipe!) and even asks me to make them for his office pot-lucks. I usually make a lot more of the rub so the flavor is stronger. The pork is great for tacos, and we've used the leftovers for enchiladas. The same recipe works just as well on chicken too! This is now one of my signature dishes.

This was seriously amazing and pretty easy. My husband ate it for dinner three nights in a row and could not believe how good it was. I did double all of the spices EXCEPT for the cinnamon. Absolutely wonderful!

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  My husband, who is Mexican, usually cooks carnitas on the stove; however, we came across this recipe and decided to try it for a company party.  It totally took us by surprise, and tastes fantastic!  Everyone loved it!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's amazing!

I'm sorry but this was just OK. The meat was so soft almost mushy. I think 10 hours is too long to cook it. There was a tad too much cinnnamon in it and carnitas is usually cooked with fresh oranges. We lived in California for many years and had some wonderful carnitas. It is always a little on the dry side. This really wasn't a true pork carnitas. I will keep looking for a better recipe for this dish.

This is really good, but you definitely need to triple the dry ingredients.  Their was a lot of broth, so no need to add anymore, but the seasoning/flavor was lacking and I even doubled it.  I wouldn't triple the cinnamon, however.  I would leave it at 1/4 tsp and triple all the other dry ingredients.  I'll add mild green chili's next time.

This was Amazing.   The cinnamon makes the dish.  It is a necessary step to cut up the meat and put it in a 400 deg oven for about 15 minutes.  I would give this a 10!

I was worried about the cinnamon in this but it was great. This is the best meal I have made in a long time. I followed the recipe exactly except at the end I did bake it at 400 for 15 mins. I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow. This was sooo good!

Excellent!  The roast I had was a Boston Butt, bone-in.  Doubled seasonings except cinnamon as suggested by others.  Next time I'll triple.  Cooked about 10 hrs, then as suggested shredded the meat and then into 400 degree oven for about 20 min. being careful not to over cook.  Served with flour and corn tortillas, chopped onion, fresh cilantro, salsa and Mexican rice.  Will definitely make this again.    Thanks for the recipe and the helpful suggestions.

The meat fell to pieced after cooking all day. Great flavor. The meat was a little too fatty for my liking so I cut all the fat off after it finished cooking. I sauted onion and bell peper with butter and garlic in an iron skillet unitl vegetables were tender. Cooked the meat in the oven at 400 for 15 min to crisp up the meat. Made fajitas out of the meat and veggies. Topped with salsa and sour cream. Fantastic recipe!

OMG!!!! This recipe rocks!!  I actually cooked mine in a pot.  I did cut the meat into sections before cooking and I also added 4 chopped garlic cloves and extra seasonings.  Everyone included my 7 yr.old loved this meat. Very tender and full of flavor. Thanks for sharing:)

I took the advice of other reviews and cut the 4lb pork shoulder into 4 big chunks.  Since the surface area then increased, I had to basically keep making the rub over and over!  I placed 3-4 cloves of garlic in the chicken stock and set it on high to cook for 5 hours.  The smell during the last hours were toture - we were so hungry but knew we couldn't eat it yet!!  It was 4/5 stars coming out of the slow cooker, but after putting it in the oven for 10-15 minutes at 400, it was 5/5!!

A total hit with my family!  My 2 and 5 year old and my Husband loved it.  They called me a Star after serving this one with taco fixings!   For a  6.5 lb. pork shoulder blade roast,  I did triple each of the seasonings, leaving the salt and cinnamon as recommended for that size.  And added fresh cilantro to the crockpot per our preference.   Cooked on low for 10 hours.  Just  before serving, shredded it and put in the oven @ 400 degrees for 20 min with a cup of broth poured around it to crisp it.  Looking forward to making it again soon!  This was super affordable to make with plenty to freeze!

I thought it needed more spices, like most people have said.  Otherwise, this is very good and inexpensive.  I made some rice and black beans to go with it.  Very economical!

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I followed it exactly, and served it this weekend at my son's birthday party.  Everyone loved it, especially the kids!  I did find the meat a bit salty, but I heard no complaints.  Next time I might add some chilies to give it a kick.  This recipe is now my official carnitas recipe.

Fantastic and easy recipe.  My Mexican wife and friends all rave and crave this when it's my turn to cook.  Great for leftover tacos as well.  As others suggested, I did triple up on the spices except the salt.

This was ok.  I think I will skip the cinnamon next time though.  I could taste a hint of it and well it just didn't work with a savory meal.  All in all though I will make it again minus the cinnamon.

Tried the recipe tweaked the spices a bit (no cinnamon).  I made a dry rub mix and rubbed the meat the day before and put it in a ziploc bag to marinate overnight.  The next morning I just popped it into the crock pot and when we got home....DELISH!!

This pork was amazing!  I put everything in my slow cooker, then shred the pork and served it in pitas with a garlic sauce (1/3 cup mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons milk, 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped), topped with tomatoes and lettuce - my husband went back for thirds and asked if there was any leftover for his lunch the next day!  this has become a regular in our meal rotation!

I actually like the use of cinnamon in savory dishes, (found a lot in Greek cuisine) and I enjoyed the faint flavor it left on this slow cooked pork carnitas.  We used the pork for tacos one night, and added BBQ sauce to it for sandwiches the next.  I thought this meat was exceptionally tasty!  Don't be afraid to try the cinnamon in it, it really adds something interesting.

Holy cow this was good! Next time I will reduce the cinnamon as my husband and I found it a little disconcerting, but I won't eliminate it completely - it's really, really good, and the cinnamon gives it a little extra something. We just found it to be a little TOO much "something". :) We ate it in corn tortillas with avocado, tomato, and a little bit of light sour cream. This is going in my keeper file!

Made this for my family on Mother's Day.  I doubled the spices and that really helped.  I also spread the pork out on a baking sheet after pulling it and poured a bottle of Mexican Coca-Cola over it, then stuck it in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes to get it crispy on the outside, and that really pulled everything together.  It was perfect and juicy on the inside and sweet and crispy on the outside.  I would definitely suggest these additions to the recipe to add a little flair to your Carnitas and make for a memorable meal.  Otherwise a fantastic recipe.  Thanks!

Made the recipe as directed, but after shredding the pork, I put it on a cookie sheet and broiled the meat for about 5 min. to get the top crispy. It was outstanding and my husband couldn't stop raving about it. We ate the meat in tacos with corn tortillas with onions, cilantro, and salsa. Even I (who doesn't normally care for carnitas) loved this recipe, thanks!

I only had a 2Lb pork sirloin roast, but I kept the ingredient amounts the same. Next time I'll add more of everything but the cinnamon--maybe leave that out all together since I didn't like the smell of it with the rest of the yummy smells (although I LOVE the taste and smell of cinnamon). I also knew my roast would only take 3 hours to cook on med-high. I took the advice of others and cubed the meat after slow cooking, and roasted in the oven before shredding more. I served in tortillas with fillings, and Spanish Rice II. I'll be making again. We all loved it.

I have used this recipe three times now.  I recommend doubling the spices (except cinnamon).  I got better results by cutting the roast into smaller pieces.

Very good!!!! I used some of other suggestiions: Doubled spices except salt and cinnamon. At end of cooking take out of crock (removing any fat and leaving juice in the crock) and put in baking dish. Shred meat with two forks. Add about 1/2 cup of the juice from the crock to the meat. Put in 400 degree oven for about 20 min. add another 1/2 cup of juice cook 10 min. more till crispy. My husband loves carnitas and he said these were awesome!!!!

Made this the other night with great results.  I used Pork Carnitas from the local store.  It comes in about 1/4 pound chunks and worked out AMAZINGLY.  Following other suggestions I tripled the spices (except the cinnamon).  Here’s what I added.  2 Dry New Mexico Hot Chilies cut up and seeded.  Even though they say they are hot (and the peppers themselves look it) its not very hot at all.  Also as a special addition I added 3/4 of a can of White Hominy with the liquid drained.  It adds a nice side item for the tortillas we put them in.  

When it was done and a little cool I took the remainder of the meat and liquid and removed all the hominy.  The meat and the liquid were put in the fridge.  2 days later I used the meat, with added spices for tamales.  The fat you can strain from the top of the liquid works great in addition to the lard in the maza and the same with the liquid as the broth.  It made some amazing tamales.

This was great as carnitas.  I put it in the crock pot before work and had a fantastic dinner that night.  It was quick and easy.  Also I had some leftover that I mixed in with store bought BBQ sauce and had BBQ sandwiches another night of the week.  I will for sure make this again.

It turned out really moist, and the spices were great, I used beef broth instead.  Next time, I think I will add more salt, and spices.
I served it with cabbage, salsa, cilantro and guacomole.

Amazing! I made the roast at home and shredded it, saving most of the liquid and then put the whole crock from my slow-cooker in the fridge. The next day I took it to a tequila tasting party, plugged in the slow-cooker and *viola* -- the star of the show. Everyone begged for the recipe so I made a batch of the rub and gave out tins of it for Christmas. I did not use bay leaf and I used chicken bullion in water instead of broth. Yummy!

Yummy!  This was the easiest and tastiest carnitas recipe we have found.  Followed recipe exactly and came home to a great dinner.  We were able to use the leftovers to make more delicious dinners for a couple days.

LOVED this recipe! I made the following slight tweaks after reading various reviews: 1.25 tsp saltDoubled all spices but the cinnamon per recommended various reviews. 3 bay leaves. Cut roast into thirds per recommend various reviews to ensure the seasonings evenly flavored the meat. Preheat oven to 400*.Shredded the meat and evenly spread out on baking sheet. Heated for 15-20 minutes to crisp up the meat so it’s more authentic. DELICIOUS! Entire family approved.

I took others suggestions to double the seasoning but keeping the cinnamon the same. It came out really good. I will probably add some paprika and lime next time and marinate smaller chunks of meat over night. This is a great base to start with.

I followed the recipe except I didn’t have coriander. I rubbed the pork with spices the night before and took others advice and put in oven after slow cooker on 400 for 15 min. Was delicious! The whole family liked it! I served with fresh avocado salad, tortilla chips, and rice. Thank you!

My husband and I have made this recipe a number  of times. We love how quick it is to assemble  and with a couple  tweaks it becomes a five star recipe easily.  
1. The pork shoulder at our local grocer is VERY fatty. I trim about a third of the fat off before coating the meat with spices.  The husband was offended about this at first, but he came around.
2. We quadruple the spices. Literally, add four times as many spices as this recipe calls for, as it is otherwise too bland, but with four times as much, it's delicious. 
3. After the meat comes out of the slow cooker, but before assembling our tacos, we put the meat in the oven to give it more texture. We spread it thin on a baking sheet, bake ten minutes  at 350 then broil on high for 3 minutes,  until a some of the edges start to get crispy. I was offended about this at first, but I came around.

I've made this at least 10 times and have tweaked it to make it 5 stars: I double the spices (don't omit the cinnamon!), sub onion powder for the garlic, triple the salt measurement but use kosher salt instead of regular, and sub beef broth for the chicken. So delicious. I make carnitas tacos with it out of the slow cooker (I like how moist it is... I've tried putting it in the oven to dry it out and brown it a little but that makes it too dry IMO) with corn tortillas, shredded cabbage, cojita cheese, sliced avocado and salsa. The leftovers get reheated with bottled BBQ sauce and served on Hawaiian style buns for the best pulled pork sandwiches ever.

I've been using this recipe for many years; it's a great base that you can tweak to your own liking. I use all chicken broth to cover the meat, I add onions and a Serrano chili to the broth as well. I never have to cook it for 10 hours, whether bone in or boneless-maybe 4 hours tops. I also back off the cinnamon a tad, but I always triple, yes, triple the rub recipe. Once I shred the meat I stick it under the broiler with a little broth until it crisps up a bit, then I serve with tortillas, salsa, all the fixins

I've made this recipe twice.

The first time, I followed the recommendations exactly. I found the flavours pleasant but bland, and the meat was still a bit tough.

The second time I made it, I double all of the spices except the salt,  as well as added 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp of cumin seeds and 1 tsp of coriander seeds to the chicken broth. FInally, I cooked it for 24 hours (flipping at the 4, 8 and 16 hour marks.) It was excellent.

I made this for a "Fiesta Themed" party. The only difference was I used 2 roasts, ground nutmeg instead of cinnamon (not as strong), and fresh cilantro instead of ground, and I didn't use salt. There's enough salt in everything we eat. After slow-cooking for hours, I put it in the oven with the broiler on for 5 mins. to crisp it a little. Everyone was taking whatever was leftover home. I didn't get leftovers but hey, as long as everyone enjoyed themselves, I'm good.

Doubled the spices but omitted the cinnamon (was unsure) and coriander (didn't have). Cooked on high in the crock pot for 4 hrs, then turned on low for an hour. DELISH.

My daughter made this according to the recipe and was disappointed that the meat was so bland after shredding. I added cumin, chili powder and cayenne to taste, along with a few scoops of the liquid, and the resulting filling was excellent. For simple street tacos, add chopped onion, cilantro, avocado, and jack cheese to your small tortillas. Delicious!

I used 7 pd pork shoulder bone in. I broke down the shoulder into big chunks, used 2 1/2 times the recommended spice amount (minus the cinnamon, I used just the recommended dose for that) and 3 cups chicken broth. After cooking in the slow cooker, baked on cookie sheet with liquid at 400 degrees until liquid was gone and edges were crisp. 15 to 20 min. Exquisite with pico de gallo, lettuce, and cheddar on tortillas.

This is the second time I made this.  The first time it was dry and not very flavorful, in spite of the fact I doubled the spices and added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I also left out the cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers.  

This time, in addition to the adjustments  I made the first time, I pierced the meat several times with a knife and cooked on high for 5 hrs and low for 3 hrs.  (I will admit that the cooking time discovery was an accident I forgot to set the slow cooker to low and discovered my mistake when I went to flip it over.)  The results were SO flavorful and tender!!!

These were awesome!!  I had a 4.5 lb pork shoulder that I cut into 4 chunks.  I followed many of the others' reviews and doubled the spices (except the cinnamon and salt).  I didn't have 10 hours, so I put the slow cooker on high for 4 hours, then I put it on low for about 2 more hours and it turned out perfectly!  We had guests over and had everyone make their own burritos with salsa, lettuce, guac, cheese, sour cream, and seasoned black beans.  It was a HUGE hit.  Definitely one we'll do again and again!

This is in our weekly rotation and is FABULOUS.  We serve on lettuce for a great healthy lettuce wrap!  We also crisp it up in the oven at 425degrees for 15-20min.

This recipe has been a staple in my family for 8 yrs! I have two Autistic children who are extremely picky eaters and they even love it! After I shred the pork, I transfer it to a baking dish. Then I squeeze fresh lime juice over the meat and sprinkle on a little bit of  sea salt. Then I broil the meat in the oven for about 5 min to crisp up the edges of the shredded pork. Sooo good!!

My husband said this was amazing! I do not eat meat, but he loves carnitas and I wanted to try making it for him. I followed the directions except used a 2lb pork shoulder, put maybe 1/8 tsp cinnamon instead of the 1/4 and cooked on low for 6.5 hours. It smelled great! He ate with whole wheat tortillas, Pico de gallo and guacamole. It really is a inexpensive meal to make. I will be making this again.

SOOOOO GOOD!! 
I read the reviewes& followed some recommendations. I doubled the spices(except cinnamon) I minced garlic, sliced onion & added a little red pepper flake. I chopped the meat into smaller chunks so the flavors would penetrate better. I cooked in slow cooker for 6 hours . Once done I placed the meat on a foil lined cookie sheet & shredded it. I then baked in the oven on 400 for 20 mins to get the crispy edges. 
My husband made his into nachos while I had a burrito. We LOVED this recipe!!!

Very good and versatile.  I cut up my pork shoulder into chunks, trimming away big sections of fat (but still leaving plenty of marbled meat) doubled the spices except for the cinnamon - I kept that the same.  When it came time to fork shred it was still a little bland for my taste so I generously sprinkled Goya Adobo all purpose seasoning w/ cumin while it was on the cutting board.  Perfect!  Husband said it was better than chipotle.

I added a tbsp of Dijon mustard, a tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, a pack of tropical sazon from Badia and real garlic. Also, instead of chicken broth, I used Clamato original juice, I did double all the other ingredients. Yummo..!!!!!

This was excellent!  I followed the directions exactly regarding the spices.  I cooked it 2 hours on high and 4 hours on low, then I followed other reviewers' suggestions and put the shredded meat on a cookie sheet with some of the broth and baked it for 20 minutes at 400 degrees to crisp it up.  We served this with queso, chopped tomatoes, onion, and lettuce and a side of the Spanish Rice II recipe.  Turned out phenomenal!

My family loves this. I changed it up a bit though. I put the shoulder in a gallon bag, dump the spice mix in, then shake the bag. I rub the spice mix into the meat and let it sit in the frige for a while. I then fill our Dutch oven about 1/4 deep in oil and get it to medium high heat. Put the meat in the hot oil and let it brown the meat - turning it over to get and even brown. Cover the Dutch oven and move it to an oven preheated to 210 and let it slow cook for 8-10 hours.

Absolutely amazing!  Following other reviewers' suggestions, I made slits in my roast and rubbed it with the dry seasonings (omitting the cinnamon) and fresh pressed garlic and let it sit overnight before cooking in the crock pot.  Everyone enjoyed this meat and it was so simple and economical to prepare, I will make this again and again.

This is delicious!  I had never heard of carnitas before so it was fun to try something different and it did not disappoint.  I only had a 2# pork roast but I kept the spices the amount of the spices the same.  Cooked on low for around 6 hours and then browned in the oven for 15 min. and it was perfect!  Thanks Erin Parker for submitting such a easy and great tasting recipe.

It smelled better cooking than it tasted. None of us cared for the cinnamon in the dish, so next time I make it, I will be leaving that spice out.

This is absoulutly amazing!!!!!!!!!! Ok, I must admit, I did omit 2 ingredients....but there is no way would I have ever been able to come up with anything close to such amazing flavors. I must get the coriander...I have never tried it and am very curios to what it has to bring to a dish. I did try adding the cinnamon once and brings a whole different flare to the carnitas..my family wasn't super crazy about the cinnamon. We are Mexican from Southern California and do alot "mexican" dishes, cinnamon isn't always used in traditional mexican cooking, mole yes, carnitas, no. So, it's different, to say the least. This is a staple meal, and have this about every other week and with the leftovers, usually on the third night, we make crispy tacos...yummm...also, I like to please my husbands very hard to please family (from Mexico) with this dish, always a thumbs up with everybody. Must try recipe, folks!!!! Hey, don't take my word for the cinnamon, though, try it out, every taste bud is different. Enjoy!!

This was yummy-my husband was so excited he said he didn't realize I could make these, and he didn't ever have to go to that giant burrito place again:) I did follow some of the reviews to "crisp up" the meat in pan in oven-perfect! Next time I'll omit salt as they were too salty for me---my husband didn't think they were but he can salt to taste. Also definitely will add cilantro and a fresh pico to brighten up the flavour. I served with flour tortillas  which I thought too heavy, will use corn next time. Thanks for the great recipe-think I'll use for Super Bowl!

I doubled the ingredients except the cinnamon and made sure to put the rub in all the creases of the meat. Shredded it, took out the fat, and made some  home made salsa to go with it. Love the slow cooker!! Great meal.

Amazing!!! I doubled the spices as suggested in other reviews. Left out the cinnamon as I am not a big fan. Used an Angry Orchard instead of the chicken broth. Served with plain basmati rice and black beans the first night. Made enchiladas the second night. Yummmm:)

This was pretty good. I'll probably read some of the reviews on how to tweak it a bit.

This was very good. I followed previous reviews and double the seasonings and omitted the cinnamon . Next time I will do the same but not double the salt. It was a bit salty for our taste! But still great!

This is a great recipe!  You definitely want to a) double the spices, and b) bake for 20 mins @ 400 after the 10 hours.  Cut the shoulder into chunks before cooking and then shred some, leave some whole when it comes out.  We serve with tortillas and pico - but you can also put it on a bun as bbq

These were fantastic! I used pork loin roasts because that's what our store had at the time. I tripled all of the seasonings, including the cinnamon, and it was perfect!

Added this to my recipe box because it has such a high rating. So when my husband and I were at the grocery store trying to come up with a new dinner idea I whipped out my phone. We were both excited to try it and sure enough, the house smelled delicious when we got up the next morning. So you can imagine my disappointment when my husband tried it but said it wasn't very good, he had wanted to take some to work for his coworkers but didn't. That night we added more cumin and cinnamon but it was too late, it didn't help. All these years I've known to read reviews first but this time I was using the app and I'm not even sure how to get to them. Making the recipe as-is didn't work for us. We might try it again but we'll do a minimum of doubling the rub and will try putting the meat in the oven before eating. Otherwise it's a soggy mess.

This was almost too easy not to give it 5 stars!  Took me about 3 minutes in the morning to put this together, and it was finished by the time I got out of work!  You can't beat that!  The only thing I hoped for was a little more flavor.  Next time, I will follow another user's recommendation and cut up the pork first, and maybe double the seasoning.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was so good and easy! I had tried to make pork tacos before  this recipe and it never quite turned out right, but this recipe hit  the jackpot! I made it just as it said cinnamon and all. (I was skeptical.) Everyone in my house loved it - even my super picky 6 year old. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

The pork turns out very tender but the spice mixture makes the end result taste like sausage.

Very good, but hubs wanted to know if they should be spicier.  I wouldn't know; not sure I've ever had carnitas.  If that's what he wants though, I'll add a bit of cayenne and maybe a tad of red pepper flakes next time to jack up the heat.  I used 8 pork chops instead of pork roast--we don't have pork roast right now, and I think that might have helped with the flavor permeating the meat.  I doubled the spices except the salt (only did 1 1/2 tspns) and cinnamon (kept that to 1/4 tspn) because I didn't want either to overpower--and hubs can be squirrelly about "weird" flavors in his meat. I probably would've been fine with doubling both though, as there was no odd flavor or saltiness he remarked upon.  I didn't double the liquid and hubs wanted rice on his tacos that we made, so I used the 2 cups of liquid from the meat to make him a batch of rice.  Very good, and this results in a good amount of meat that we can make into pulled pork sandwiches or whatever.  I love that this is a slow cooker recipe and it seems pretty versatile.  The pork just falls apart--I broke it up with a fork and knife while still in the slow cooker and let it soak up some juice before turning it completely off.  One note:  new slow cookers (which I have since I broke my old one--boo!) tend to heat faster and run hot, so I didn't need anywhere near 10 hours.  I think it was in the slow cooker for about 6, but it likely could've been in there longer since this recipe has plenty of liquid for moisture.

I have made this recipe twice! I followed what some have done and did the following: tripled the seasonings, left out the cinnamon, squeezed 1 whole orange, added a small bunch of chopped cilantro but in the chicken broth, I had NO bay leaves so left those out, then once the 10 hours was up, I shredded on a cooking pan with non-stick cooking spray and popped in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. This is awesome with the Spanish Rice II, pico, ranch dressing, lettuce and cheese...all rolled up in a BIG FAT BURRITO! Would be yummy as a breakfast with eggs and hashbrowns too. Or in a Nacho Cheese Dip. Yeah, I'm finding more ways to eat this stuff up. Very delicious.

I've been a bad girl....didn't even try this as written.  So, not sure how to rate it since I'm positive I would not have cared for it had I used cinnamon.  BUT...thanks to "naples34102" I doubled the rub and left out the cinnamon.  So five stars for her review!  So delicious!

Delicious - I left out the cinnamon due to personal preference, added onion powder and tripled the rest of the spices for a 6 1/2 pound roast. Made this the day before I planned on serving - after refrigerating over night, I skimmed a lot of fat off the surface. Baked it at 400 in a shallow layer on a cookie sheet as suggested by many others, (After which even more fat could be poured off) - leaves the meat very tasty without having to eat so much fat. May try this with a leaner cut of meat in the future. This is a great versatile recipe -- cook a big roast and have meat for several meals for tacos, burritos, add BBQ sauce and serve on buns, I even put some on a salad. If there are leftovers, I bet they would freeze well.

My husband, who is more often the cook in our house, was blown away by how good this was. We used a 2.5 pound sirloin roast and cooked it for 6-7 hours. We could have cooked it for one hour less. We were concerned about substituting that cut because some comments on other web sites said it wouldn't shred.  That was not true at all, just don't let it cool too much before shredding. The key is to moisten the meat with the cooking juices. That really transfers the flavors too. I kept the spices the same as the recipe and added two hot peppers to the cooking liquid. We served on soft tortillas with avocados, tomatoes, cilantro, and hot peppers.

 We have made this a couple more times now  I agree to double the spices but do not double the  salt.

Like many others i just doubled the spices but halved the cinnamon. The meat was tender and juicy and very flavorful. But i decided to bake at 400 for 15 min to crisp-en it. I couldn't keep my hands off long enough to fill the taco shell.....I even went up to grab a piece while i was writting this review!!!!!! It's GOOD!!!!!!

It was excellent. After I cooked the pork, I removed it to a cookie sheet, covered and refrigerated.  I put some carrots, cabbage, spinach, and more spices in the broth and cooked on high for about an hour and a half. I then put the pork in the oven. MMMM thanks!
Second time not so good.

Based on the reviews, instead of doubling the spice rub, I used a 2 1/2 lb roast.  Found a package that read "Pork Roast for Carnitas"  I used a frozen broth I had made from an enchilada type soup.  Cooked in 8 hours on low.  PERFECT!  The roast fed two families (4 people in each family) with sides of beans and simple stuffed jalapenos with peach/jalapeno "jam".

i have tried numerous pulled pork recipes and this one is just fabulous (not to mention, my husband's absolute favorite!) Made a few modifications and just used 1/2 of the amount of cinnamon called for in the recipe and instead of using chicken broth, used Dr. Pepper.  Served the pork in a small tortilla (both corn or flour worked great), with a little bit of pico de gallo and it was amazing!

Our family LOVES this. I typically would think the cinnamon was odd, but it is the secret ingredient. Many very picky eaters have tried and can't put their finger on the goodness. This is a crowd pleaser and we use it for the meat in our burrito bar while RV camping. Sooo good!

I didn't have a slow cooker so I cooked this on my stovetop. I added chili powder to the rub mixture and let it marinate overnight because my husband was worried there wouldnt be enough flavor. I also cut the meat into four pieces. I brought the pot to a boil, then turned it down to the lowest setting for 2 hours. The meat was falling apart after only 2 hours and delicious! I shredded it with a fork and let it simmer for another 30 minutes before assembling my burrito with Mexican Rice 2 from this site. My husband is very picky about his burritos, but said this was just as good as his favorite burrito place.

Outstanding!  I used 2 and 1/2 pounds of country style pork shoulder boneless ribs cut into baseball sized pieces and cooked on high for about 7 hours.  I also tripled the rub mixture but omitted the cinnamon. Delicious.

This recipe has a fantastic flavour, but is veeery salty. I'd make it again, but would cut down on salt a bit to not take away from the flavour of the spices. We also added a 1/2tsp of amchor powder (dried green mangos - tastes almost citrusy), and it gave a great, slightly sour counterpoint that really brought out the flavour of the other spices. I highly recommend giving it a try, or else squeezing some lemon or lime juice in there!

Fantastic recipe! Cooked a 2 1/2 lb pork butt for  seven hours instead of the 4lb for 10 hours. Kept to the recipe for everything else.

Go very very light on the cinnamon. I make this a day ahead then shred it and put it under the broiler for a while to give it toasty edges. I paired it with fresh pico de gallo and salsa verde. Amazing!

SO easy & soooo good! Tastes like chipotle's shredded pork. I used 2 pounds of pork loin, the listed amount of seasonings (more salt though, at the end before serving) & 1 cup of broth with 1 T. of lemon juice.  Was done in 9 hours. Thank you; my toddlers both love it in cheese quesadillas, with avocados & black beans on the side.

Really good but I think I'll leave out the cinnamon next time. It gave it a weird after taste. UPDATE: I made it without the cinnamon and it wasn't as good!!! Use the cinnamon!

This recipe is right up there my favorites recipes here on Allrecipes. Thanks for sharing this. I made it today with e\what I already had on hand.  I used a pork loin instead of a pork shoulder. I omitted the coriander since I had none and I did triple the rub ingredients except for the cinnamon(I use 1/2t). Next time I would use a little less salt as well.
Overall...LOVED IT

Great recipe. A keeper for sure. Be sure and place your roast with the fat on top, as it will keep your roast from getting too dry. To achieve a more carnitas texture, I made another batch of seasoning and when it was complete I removed it, chopped it with half the fat added a little juice and added additional seasoning and broiled for 5 minutes, then stirred and broiled several minutes more minutes. Some of the pieces will come out crispy.
We ate pork carnita tacos in Carmen del Playa and they served it with hot sauce, pineapple, tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and we added avacado on a fresh corn tortilla. Splendid! Just like it tasted on our trip.

I doubled the spice mixture (except for the salt, which I multiplied by 1.5), and used a 14.5oz can of chicken broh instead of the full 2 cups (since I still didn't quite use all the liquid, that was sufficient). It only needed 8 hours on low in my crock pot before it shredded extremely easily, and once it was shredded, I separated the meat from the liquid, added 2 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp cayenne to the liquid, and put the meat in the oven to broil. I added about 3/4 of the liquid total, a little at a time at a time, stirring whenever the top was nicely caramelized and the liquid was mostly used up. During cooking I can't say I loved the smell of the cinnamon, but once it was finished the flavor wasn't overpowering. Overall it was quite good, and I served it on tortillas with some bacon guacamole.

Really good recipe.  I ended up doubling the spices per others recommendation (except the cinnamon) to give it more flavor and it was perfect.  We didn't find it too salty but it didn't take 10 hours to cook.  Ours was about 3 pounds and took about 6 hours.  We will be making this again.  Served it on tortilla shells with red onion, tomato, avocado slice, cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime.

This is absolutely delicious!  I was a little hesitant because I never cook with cumin or coriander and I wasn't sure I'd like this.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I did triple the amount of seasoning to coat the roast as some suggested and I'm glad I did.  It was tender and very flavorful.  The sauce was amazing.  This has now become one of our favorite recipes.

This is delish!! I never seem to get going 10 hours before I want to eat --plus I trim the big pieces of fat off and cut the roast into 3-4 pieces to help the spices permeate (definitely do this), which usually takes me at least 20 min-- so I cook on high for 2 hours and then low for 5-6. This time after shredding, I'm also going to put the meat back into the broth for a little bit to moisten the meat. The leftover shredded meat, which I refrigerate in the broth, is so amazing that this last soak may be worthwhile.

I loved this.  My goal was to try a recipe that would make the pork delicious without having to slather a sauce all over it.  This recipe delivered.  I had a whopping 7.4 lb bone in boston butt to cook.  I doubled the recipe, except for the cinnamon.  I was worried about time because it was almost double the size in the recipe so I put it on high for 5 hours (I meant to only leave it for about 2-3 hours on high, but I forgot about it).  Then I switched to low for an hour.  I expected it to be longer, but it was finished around 6 1/2 hours of cooking.  The meat is so flavorful and tasty!  I ate it two ways.  Piled high on a kaiser roll and piled on top of cooked potatoes with sour cream.  I'll make it again!!

This was amazing...hubby said it's probably the best thing I've ever made besides my enchiladas.  The only changes I made was to double up on the spices, left the cinnamon out (don't really like it all that much) and cut the meat up into smaller pieces (about 5 or 6) to get the rub all over.  Thanks again for the fantasic recipe...will be making again and again!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was fantastic. The final touch was after it was done, I pulled it out on to a cookie sheet and pulled it with two forks. I then placed in the oven at 400 for 15 minutes to get that delicious crispy top. SO good. Bonus is the leftovers are awesome with homefries and a poached egg and hotsauce on top for breakfast.. YUM!

I made this recipe as it, with the exception of the cut of pork.  I could only find pork loin at the store i was in, and decided, even though all reviews said shoulder was the only way to go, to try it.  It was amazing.  I cooked it in the slow cooker for 10 hours on low and it fell apart. The flavors were amazing, the meat tender and juicy.  Not having tried Pork Shoulder, I can't imagine how this could have been better.  Definitely a subsitute I would use again.  For those who don't like fattier pieces of meat, this is a better choice.  But honestly, I just changed it for convenience.  I picked up a 5 lb pork loin for $15. Hope this helps!

This is an absolutely wonderful dish.  We have made it probably 20 times in the last two years.  It is easy to make, has a wonderful flavor and is very versatile.   You can use it on nachos, in burritos, chimichangas or even on its own.

We usually halve the recipe simply because we are two people.  We always double ALL of the spices (all of which are traditionally used in Mexican cooking--including cinnamon).  Think of mole sauces.  They use all kinds of spices including the ones Americans traditionally think of as dessert spices.  

This recipes does not need to be turned over in the crockpot.  We've had the same success turning it over or not.  It just depends upon if we are home.

I made this last night for a family dinner. My fiance loved it and wouldn't stop eating it! This is our new favorite pork recipe for tacos, etc. I added more of the spices, just as the reviews said and it turned out perfect. Definitely recommend it!

I'm surprised at the people who didn't like or opted to leave out the cinnamon! In my opinion, this is what makes this particular recipe so good.  Being from Texas, I have tried plenty of carnitas and this version is by far my favorite.  Add a splash or two of rootbeer to the broth for extra flavor and tenderness ;)

I thought this was EXCELLENT!  I omitted the cinnamon, added chili powder and doubled the spices as mentioned by other reviewers.  The combination of spices is really great and smelled delicious while it was cooking.  I tried to start with a frozen butt roast and since it was taking too long to cook, I finished it up on the pressure cooker.  I think I'll go straight for the pressure cooker next time (but start with a thawed butt roast.  Everyone loved it and although I had a 4.5lb roast and thought I would be plenty (and maybe some leftovers,) it was all gone.  I'm making it again for my dinner group next weekend.  Can't wait!

Tripled the seasonings because of comments/reviews. Tasted too much like middle eastern and not enough Mexican. Didn't pull apart either. Not sure what happened.

The first time I made this, I hadn't used a slow cooker before, so it was a bit of a disaster.  I added too much liquid, worrying that it wouldn't have enough because I was having it go while I was sleeping.  I had doubled the spices, but due to the excess liquid (my fault), it was way too bland and had no flavor whatsoever.  So, I didn't rate the recipe at that time, and instead decided to try it again.
The second time I tried it, I had a 3 lb. shoulder instead of a 4 lb. shoulder, so I used AllRecipes nifty serving adjustment.  I still doubled the spices, since I like things spicy, but otherwise, remained true to the recipe.  Oh man, it smelled so good while it was cooking, and it tasted pretty good, too.  In the future, though, I'm going to increase the spices even more.  These carnitas had nice flavor, but they weren't as intense a flavor as I usually like.  I would also recommend cutting off the fat before cooking -- I ended up throwing out huge quantities of just plain fat and seasonings, and due to the chicken broth, you have plenty of moisture, so you don't really need the fat.  That would allow more seasoning on the actual meat as well.  Overall, these were good, but could still do with more flavor.

If you like carnitas, it's hard to undersell this recipe.  I generally make it once a month and it's fantastic without fail.  My own tip - I buy the pork in bulk and generally make two 1.5 lb pieces at a time and often double or triple the rub.  The result is fantastic.

Loved this!! I read through the reviews and took some advice from others. I had 3lbs so, I doubled the spices except the cinnamon. I also added 1tsp of allspice, 1 tblspn of onion powder, & one can of coke. I also added 1/2 of water with 2 low sodium chicken stock packets. I threw it in the slow cooker and did not turn it, as instructed. I'm glad I didn't because it had a really good crust of spices that was full of flavor. Will definitely make again but with a lttle less cinnamon/allspice.

This was off the hook! Make this next week for the family and expect to have it again because it makes soo much food. Invite friends if your family is smaller than 4. There's that much!

I adjusted this recipe to my own taste, and it was delicious. I substituted chili powder for the coriander and used fresh garlic instead of powder. I rubbed my pork roast with the dry ingredients and let it sit overnight in the fridge, then put it in the slow cooker the next day. After shredding the meat, I put it under the broiler until it crisped up the edges a little. I reserved some of the juices to keep the meat moist after broiling it. Yummy in tacos with some lime, cilantro, and cheese!

I normally hate it when people modify a recipe and then give it a 5 star rating, but that is what I am doing. As is, this is a serviceable recipe, it covers the basics and produces some tasty pork. However, I also made this following the suggestions of other reviewers and was rewarded with an amazing meal. I used real garlic, tripled the spices (not the cinnamon) and added chopped onion, cilantro and fresh orange juice. After the pork was done, I shredded it in the crock pot and let it 'get happy' in its cooking juices for about a half hour. I then transferred the pork to a foil lined cookie sheet put it in the oven at 400 for about 20 minutes. It achieved the crispy edges without having to fry it. Yum!

This was a hit! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! I was going to double the spices (from reviews) but I am glad I didn't. It would have been too salty.  It was perfect! We loved the cinnamon. It gave it a great taste. However, I did serve fresh onion and cilantro with it. I was thinking about adding cheese but it was not needed. It made a lot for left overs too. It's a keeper!

Quick, easy and versatile.  We eat the meat over spanish rice, in  tortillas, cuban sandwiches, or crisp the meat with chopped garlic in a little hot oil, squeezing the juice of a lime over it and serve it over Goya's classic pink beans.

This recipe just didn't do much for me, though this is completely a personal preference in taste. It was a little sweet where I prefer saltier flavors. However, this was a very versatile recipe, with me using in tacos and my hubby making a BBQ for sandwiches.

I chose this recipe to make for a huge family celebration.  I was looking for simplicity and great flavor and found it here!  Our carnitas taco bar was a huge hit and everyone raved about the pork.  I followed most recommendations and doubled all spice ingredients, INCLUDING the cinnamon, but cutting in half the broth.  It was perfect!

This meat is amazing!  My family loves it on torillas right out of the crock pot.  I use the leftovers in tamales or with barbeque sauce on buns.  I've been making this recipe since 2015.  I've made it dozens of times and everyone raves about it.  Like others recommended,  I double the seasonings except salt (leave it at 1 tsp), and delete the cinnamon.   I have braised the meat a few times but it didn't seem to make much difference in taste or texture.   I prefer to just throw it all in the crock pot and let it work its magic.  This meat smells wonderful while it is cooking.  If you are looking for a versatile and easy recipe for pork - try this one.  You won't be sorry.   I did try putting the meat into the oven to give it an "authentic" taste, as some have suggested.  The meat came out chewy and hard to eat.  Why ruin a good thing?  Its fantastic right out of the pot.  Thanks you for the amazing recipe!  PS - if you are making tamales, use the juice for making the masa dough.  You will make the best tamales you have ever eaten!

I have made this numerous times and everyone loves it. I slice an onion and put it and a few cloves of minced garlic to line the crock pot, then add the chicken broth and then meat. Like others, I cut the meat into smaller sections and I use 2 1/2x the rub, no cinnamon but usually add a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Sometimes I broil the meat a few mins, sometimes not- it's good either way. We usually serve these fajita style with Spanish rice (I use a cup of the broth in the rice - yummy) and beans. Fantastic!

This is one of the best recipes I've discovered in years!  I used another reviewers suggestion to spread the meat out in a pan and put into the oven for 20 minutes at 400 degrees to give a little crisp to the meat. Took it over the top!  Served on warmed corn tortillas topped with shredded monterey jack cheese, followed by the meat, sauteed sweet peppers and onions, with a shot of Slap Your Mama hot sauce and a big dollop of sour cream - eating it soft taco style.  So good that I raved about it at work and tomorrow am taking it in for a mexican fiesta potluck.

My family loved this recipe.  I did cut up the roast as others recommended and I left out the cinnamon and added cayenne pepper.  Added some corn starch to the crock pot to make gravy and served it over garlic mashed potatos.  Oh my goodness it was yummy and had such a different flavor.  It's a keeper recipe for me for sure.

I only had a 2 1/2 lb roast and I read reviews and doubled spices with the exception of the cinnamon.  I challenge you when preparing for the 1st time do NOT live cinnamon out. It adds a nice flavor and it works.  I to will add this to my list of favorites!

This is great! Juicy, but lacking SOME flavor. I totally suggest adding BBQ sauce, hot sauce, etc. to it just to kick up the flavor. I had it without any flavoring and I thought it was pretty good. I know for sure that I will make it again in the future!

I'm usually pretty generous with my ratings, but this one didn't really make it for me.  Not a particularly tasty flavor.  Kind of....meh.  After reading a ton of the reviews, I cut the meat in 4.  Larger shoulder, so I even tripled the spices (not the cinnamon).  I baked in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes after to crisp.  All of those are highly, highly recommended.  I'm rating on my personal enjoyment of this recipe.  Maybe I just don't like carnitas.

I combined suggestions given by others and it turned out great. I scored the meat deeply and marinated the meat overnight. (I quadrupled most of the seasonings by mistake). I did not add any liquid to the crock pot nor did I broil the meat in the end. I did squeeze the juice of one lime over the meat before I turned on the slow cooker. It turned out moist and very well seasoned. Thanks Erin and my fellow reviewers for this recipe!

I eliminated the cinnamon completely and tripled all the other spices. Used a bone-in pork roast, poked holes in the roast with a knife so I could rub the spices down into the holes as well as on the outside. Cooked overnight for 10 hours, shredded, then broiled on low in the oven for about 20 minutes to warm and crisp it up before serving it at a party. Strained juices from slow cooker and simmered them on the stove to reduce, and added just a bit of corn starch mixed with water to thicken. This "sauce" was delicious with the meat - next time if I have the time I will refrigerate the sauce and skim off the cold fat before simmering it.

This recipe makes enough meat for a teenage boy and 5 friends. :)

Double the amount of all seasoning and rub it all into the roast (don't just sprinkle or coat it).

After cooking, break up the meat into large chunks/shreds on a cookie sheet and put it under the broiler for a few minutes. Serve on warm corn tortilla with diced sweet onions, cilantro, jalapeno slices and some salsa.

This recipe was so easy, tasty and fragrant. The aroma of the spices filled the house making us brim with anticipation, and boy, we were not disappointed. Served it over brown rice and we ate leftovers throughout the week with tortillas, cornbread or whatever was on hand. I cannot wait to get the next pork shoulder from my meat CSA so that I can make this again!

This recipe is so amazing!  I usually double the whole thing to have plenty days with leftovers.  The spice combination is unique and really excellent.   I kept everything exactly the same (except double).  The house smells so good while it is cooking.  I usually serve with rice, black beans, guacamole, and some tortilla chips.  I wouldn't change a thing!

I had some leftover shredded pork from another meal, so I made the sauce from this recipe, let it simmer to reduce, and then used it by reheating some of the pork in a skillet with oil until it started to get a little crispy. Then I added the sauce and mixed for a minute or so before serving on tortillas. Fantastic flavor! Everyone loved it! Served with white rice and green beans. Yum!

So tasty and so easy!! This is one of my new go to recipes. I've made it twice, the first time according to the recipe. I felt like it had too much cinnamon - tasted good but more like Moroccan seasonings than Mexican. The second time I doubled the seasonings as some reviewers recommended and included just a dash of cinnamon. I felt like the seasonings overpowered the meat and the extra garlic powder made it way too salty and it was just too much for me. Next time I'll follow the recipe for seasonings but with just a dash of cinnamon. My Mexican friends loved the version with extra seasonings and my friends who hadn't ever had Carnitas preferred the first version.

My husband is hispanic and was APPALLED to see me making carnitas in the crockpot.  But after he tasted them - he never complained again!!  In fact, he has invited his parents over (who make carnitas the traditional way, to try mine this weekend!!) We left out the cinnamon, trippled the spices for a 4lb shoulder and cut the meat into quarters to help the spices penetrate, as others suggested. We also "crisped" up the meat, as it should be, in the oven before serving. FANTASTIC!!

BY FAR THE BEST RECIPE I HAVE FOUND IN A LONG TIME.  If I could give more than 5 Stars i would. The only thing I did different was as suggested by other reviews was double the rub. We had about 6.5 hours of cooking tome on low. Made them into enchilads. AMAZING. Thank you for sharing

I added three times the seasoning and it wasn't that seasoned, so I think those numbers are a bit off. I also cut my pork up before putting it in the slow cooker. Good recipe, but I agree with other reviewers for more spices. :)

Delicious. I have made this recipe several times now with various cuts of pork and it has turned out perfectly every time. I'm only cooking for two, so I usually use 2lbs of pork, but I keep the spice/broth measurements and cooking time the same as written in the recipe. So good, a keeper!

This recipe was a hit! So simple. I followed the directions exactly , except we added Franks Red Hot and chili powder to turn the heat up a little. We slow cooked overnight for 10 hours and kept it warm for another few. I didn't skim the grease but it didn't seem to be a problem (maybe we had a leaner roast) It shredded so easily! Will definitely make again.

These are the best easiest carnitas.  I used the suggestion of others by toasting them in the oven after the slow cooker.  I also substituted chicken bullion with beer for the broth...came out so good!

These are very savory yummy carnitas.  How ever I feel the flavors get a bit over bearing if used for left overs.  I think I might prefer something a bit more fresh, something with cilantro,but these are still very good, and the method worked perfect.

Tasty as-is, but knocking off a star because I didn't feel as though I was actually eating carnitas. Next time I'll crisp them up somehow.

I make Kalua pork all the time for potluck recipes, and we never need to add liquid, so I left out the chicken broth.  I also cook a 5-6 lb roast for 10-14 hours, so I wasn't sure about 5 hours, especially since my roast was closer to 8 lbs.  It was midnight, I was lazy, so I sprinkled the spices (doubled them since my roast was so large) over the pork, turned the slow cooker on low, and collapsed into bed.  Woke up in the morning to the most amazing aroma.  There was plenty of liquid in pot!  Flipped the pork (it fell apart), scraped off some of the fat, shredded it and let it cook till the guests arrived.  We got tons of compliments on this dish!

Very tasty! Did as others suggested and actually tripled the spice mixture (since my roast was 8 3/4 lbs) and let it sit w/rub in fridge overnight.  

Did NOT need to cook for 10 hours - was probably done by 8 hours and next time will cook for 8 or less.  Will definitely make again!

Love this recipe! I have fixed this several times for my family. It has been a huge success. I have cooked it in the pressure cooker for an hour on several occasions when I have found a deal at the market on pork and took it straight home for supper. Works just as well. I use the broth to make Mexican Rice III to make a meal.

OMG...I am seriously slapping myself...my stomach is so happy that I can't see straight! Made changes (duh!): tripled spices, doubled salt, and kept bay leaves the same...oh, cooked for an hour in pressure cooker doubling broth. Sooooo good...this is going into my recipe arsenal!

Awesome!  One of our new favs! Doubled all the spices except cinnamon, increased the cumin a little.  Also used low sodium broth because it was a little salty the first time.  Followed suggestion to bake in 400 degree oven for 20 minutes after shredding to crisp the meat.  Highly recommend this step!

I omitted the cinnamon like some of the other reviewers but followed the rest of the recipe. It came out great! I tried crisping a little of it in the oven after it was done but I thought it dried up the meat too much. My husband loved it and wants me to make it again!

A good starting point but needs a bit more flavor. I added onions and cilantro at the end for tacos, which helped. The next day, I added some bottled barbecue sauce and make sandwiches--they turned out great!

Cinnamon has no place in this recipe, IMO. I have made my carnitas this way for decades - minus the cinnamon. I also make my chicken taco meat with the same method, only use packaged taco seasoning for spices.

This was AWESOME!! Love the spice combo!  I wanted to make a wet rub for the pork, so I used 4 cloves of garlic (instead of powder) and pushed them through a press.  Mixed spices (a little heavy on the measuring) with the garlic and about 1/2 of a squeezed lime and the juice of a clementine I had on hand.  Stirred it into a paste and rubbed it all over the pork.  Also thick-sliced 2 onions and put on the bottom of the crockpot with the bay leaves, and squeezed a few more clementines over it (just because I wanted to use them up!) and cooked on low for about 10 hours.  AWESOME!! Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely perfect! Did as other suggested after slow cooking and baked at 400 degrees for 15 mins with juice on baking sheet to crisp edges. Ate with pico and homemade Guacamole. Will be making this many more times!

This turned out fantastic.  I have a family of critics of mexican/southwestern food and they devoured this!  I cooked it overnight and used it for taco salad at lunch the following day.  Will be making again.

I am not a good cook at all, but I made these for my husband who happens to be Hispanic and he loved them. He said they were just like the ones he ate in Mexico. I do feel maybe that wad a bit to generous but he did devour it. I doubled the rub and did use the cinnamon. Cooked 10 mins in 400 degree when done for crisp outside.

Great dish!  We had a lot of fun with this recipe.  Some small substitutions based on available ingredients - we used 1 cup apple juice + 1 cup water and a squeeze of lemon juice instead of the chicken broth.  Added onions and minced garlic.  We served on toasted hoagie rolls with b-bque sauce.  Everyone liked!  My 13 year old son ate his sandwich so fast, he was looking for more while the rest of us were still making ours!

Followed recipe and cooked on high for 5+ hours. These were juicy, tender, and overall really good. Topped with some fresh pico de gallo and lime and we had great carnitas!

This recipe is fab!  I did double up on most of the spices, except for the cinnamon.  Do use cinnamon as the recipe calls for, it gives it a little extra 'sumthin' and really adds to the flavor.  I used this to make quesadillas.  They were ahmazing!  I used low carb tortillas (I watch carbs and leave the nasty low fat dieting for others to endure!)  Made my own pico de gallo and guacamole and it was totally delish!  This will be on my table frequently!  Thanks for a great recipe!

A little disappointed!  Followed the recipe and was really excited to try it based on all the reviews.  
I liked the cooking technique.  The meat came out tender, juicy and shredded perfectly, but the cinnamon threw me for a loop.  Not very flavorful.  
I served with chopped yellow onion, cilantro, avocado and salsa.

Great easy recipe. I did a 2.5 Boston butt cut. Doubled all spices except cinnamon, only1/8 tsp.  Made a chipotle tomato salsa to accompany. The house smelled heavenly!

Make sure to get a cut of pork with a little fat on it.  Mine was very lean and ended up just a tad dry.  The seasonings in this recipe are great!

Made this for company and what a HIT!  Tripled the rub (used less cinn), sliced into a little like someone recommened to add rub mix, and put in oven to crisp up edges after shredding.  This is must try recipe!

This is the best carnitas recipe!  It's so easy too!  I made this most recently for a party and had people do their own toppings!  Only thing, it doesn't have a lot of heat.  To compensate this, sometimes I'll add chipotle peppers (not a lot) or jalapenos.  It's delicious with or without though!

I give this recipe 5 stars, but with the common modifications suggested in the comments. This might only be a 3 or 4 star recipe as-written.
I triple the spices except only double cinnamon, and use original amount of salt. I always use a bone-in pork shoulder because it goes on sale for a great price at my local grocery quite often, so I tend to stock up. I just cut the roast into 3 chucks, follow recipe, and then remove the bone after it's cooked. I've made this recipe about 4 or 5 times and it's always good, but watch the salt! You may want to omit it completely if your chicken broth is not reduced-sodium.

Fantastic!  I tripled the dry rub because I had a 6 lb port butt and wanted it fully coated.  I did leave out the cinnamon based on other reviews.  I browned in my dutch oven and roasted covered at 350 for about 4 hours until tender but not completely falling apart.  I cooled and refrigerated.  The next day I cut into chunks, topped with some of the broth, and roasted at 400 for about 10 minutes to crisp up.  Really great - thanks for the recipe!

These were very good.  For a 3.5 lb roast  I tripled the spices, except for the cinnamon, as suggested by other reviewers.  Used it for tacos topped with guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa and cheese.  My youngest son is a picky eater who will only add cheese to his tacos.  He sad it "had no taste".  I think you can do no wrong tripling the recipe or more even.  I have a similar recipe for mexican pot roast and the spices are much more generous than those given in this recipe.

Based on reading the reviews, I doubled the spice mixtures.  The pork butt I had was already trimmed and cut into 3-4 inch cubes, so I tossed these with spices.  This smelled fabulous while it cooked all day!  It tasted good as well.  Next time I will try crisping it up a bit before serving for a more authentic carnita feel.

I made this expecting it to be ready by the time I got out of my night class, but it wasn't. The meat was still pink on the inside, but had a great flavor. I had way too much liquid left over, so I wound up turning it into a mole sauce while cooking the meat in the oven at 350 for thirty minutes. This turned out well, but I am not pleased with the fact that I barely had enough meat for more than three people.

This was AWESOME!! I used a smaller roast only because that is what I had on hand, but still used just as much spices. Turned out amazing. Used it as a filling for enchiladas and it was loved by my whole family! The meat was so juicy and tender. Loved it!

We added some pinto beans to the bottom of the slow cooker and upped the broth to 32 oz, also tripled the seasonings per reviewer comments. Came out really well, we made them into some burritos with the beans, mexican rice, mango salsa, avacados and cheese. Never had carnitas so I can't vouch for the authenticity of the recipe but it was yummy either way!

Pretty tasty!!! Like many reviewers I thought the cinnamon wouldn't work well but it does. I liked the final product. I gave it 5 stars because my  girlfriend loved it and she doesn't like to eat pork. Kudos to the Erin Parker !!!

YUM!  I made this recipe for a party and everyone asked for the recipe.  I did as other reviewers  suggested and tripled the spices except the cinnamon.  It was SOOO good!  My only complaint was that the meat and broth created alot of juices!  I took out 3 cups of liquid when I turned the meat at the 5 hour mark.  I also put a small rack into my crockpot so the meat wouldn't be sitting in all that liquid.  It made the meat juicy without drying it out.  I will make this again as soon as possible.  Really yummy!

Were these carnitas good? Sure, they were edible. But if you are looking for a recipe that tastes like actual carnitas or something even close to it then look elsewhere! I followed this recipe EXACTLY, and the seasonings just did not do it for me, it taste nothing like carnitas and the little amount of cinnamon in it was very overpowering! It made them taste almost sweet, I regret spending the $5 for the corriander to make this recipe! When the pork was put into a tortilla with sour cream, salsa, and shredded cheese it kinda masked the sweetness and they taste pretty good, but if you eat the pork by itself it's not a very desireable flavor.. I will not be making this recipe again.

Slow Cooker Carnitas' Haiku: "Squeeze on the fresh lime! Why'd I follow the reviews? Came out a bit dry." So this is a first ~ I followed many of the reviewers' suggestions and spread the shredded pork (muy delicioso, perfectly seasoned -3X spices-) on a cookie sheet and baked them prior to serving, but we weren't too thrilled that it lost alot of its flavorful, moist texture. A heavy squeeze of lime juice, chopped cilantro, tomatillo sauce, mexi-blend cheese, lettuce, and tomato topping a warm corn tortilla, and the carnitas were still tasty. I had a mega-craving for the heavenly carnitas that I'd eaten in San Francisco last week, and these didn't quite quell the itch, but they were good nonetheless. But to combat the dryness of the leftovers, I may douse it in BBQ sauce and make a sammie for lunch tomorrow.

Really, really good!  Doubled the spices, and served with a salsa made with mandarin oranges, cucumber, cilantro, lime juice and onion with a little tabasco sauce for a kick, and topped with sour cream and mexican cheese on a corn tortilla.  Will definitely make again!

I made this for the first time tonight.  My husband and son (and I) LOVED it!  I used a 4 lb fresh pork should and I tripled the spices (except the cinnamon) as suggested.  I served it with flour tortilla, pick de gio, sour cream, cheese, and salsa Verdi. We ate until we were all stuffed!!!  Thank you for the great recipe!

Delicious!!! We wanted a unique way to cook a little under 2lbs of boneless pork chops-- this was perfect. We omitted the cinnamon and coriander (b/c we didn't have any ground) and added a little extra cumin to make up for it. For chicken broth we used 1 cup made from "Better than Bouillon". Also---cooked on high for 3 hours and low for 2, and did as another reviewer recommended and baked at 400 for 15 minutes. ... my 3 year old loved this served with avocados, cilantro, and tomatoes. Everybody went back for extra.

This recipe rocks. I tripled the spices as folks suggested and it came out wonderful. The spices were just right, not overwhelming and not too bland. And the meat very very tender.

Wow. Just wow. I tripled the spices as other reviewers recommended, and it was amazing. I didn't turn it over halfway through, though next time I will as the little strip not submerged was a little tougher to pull than the rest. It will be hard not to eat the whole thing by myself in one sitting.

This was to die with!!!  I "chunked" my pork before putting it into the crockpot.  Then, I did as someone suggested and put this on cookie sheets and put it in the oven to crisp up the edges before serving.  It was great served with all the regular taco type trimmings.  We ate it in flour tortillas with pico di gallo, sour cream and cheese.  I actually made this some time ago and am just now rating it and now I am hungry for this again!

I had pork loin rather than shoulder, and did not shred the pork.  The slices were tender and well flavored.  As other reviewers suggested, I tripled spices (except the cinnamon). It was too salty but otherwise tasted great.  Just don't triple the salt or cinnamon.  Also suggest adding 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper or some chili powder for a little heat.

This is  a very delicious recipe.  After reading the reviews, I also doubled the seasoning mixture and added Chimayo Chile powder.  It was so good in tacos, then burritos, and pork enchiladas, tostados. This is a huge new favorite with us.

I made this today and it was awesome. I took everyones advice and tripled the spices except the cinnamon. I also coated the meat with the spice mixture the night before. I put in the crock pot for 10 hours and thats it. The only thing I wish I could have done was turn it. I was at work all day so I couldn't do it after 5 hours as advised. Fortunately it was still very moist. I think I wont use so much chicken broth next time. It was really much better than I expected! Not spicy (hot) at all - which I am fine with. It's just an FYI if people are wondering.

This is great! Could not stop eating it! I tripled all spices except the cinnamon, and added about 1.5 tsp chili powder and 1.5 tsp minced dried onion. I had 6 pounds of pork shoulder and cut it into thirds. Used 3 cups chicken broth. Great unique flavor; next time I make it I am going to try baking it in the oven for 20 minutes as other reviewers suggested.

wow! really great. added onion powder and chili powder too, used my citrus salt instead of regular because i didnt have coriander, didnt use any broth.  used less cinnamon than all the other spices but it was a nice background flavor, glad i used it.  i seasoned pork, then seared it in hot pan, covered it with foil and a lid, then popped it in the oven at 300 degrees for about 2 hours.  after it pulled apart easily i added more seasoning, to taste, served with my homemade tomatillo salsa, chopped red onions, sour cream, and toasted flour tortillas(hang tortilla over rack in oven @450 degrees until crisp).  sooooo yummy! jesse loved!

Really good. I didn't have coriander (didn't realize until the last minute) and it was still good! I did double the spices and put in the oven to get them crispy. They were delicious right out of the pot though! Served on corn tortillas with guacamole, chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce, salsa, and low fat sour cream.

Sooo good!  I doubled the spice mix, but otherwise prepared as the recipe stated.  We had plenty of meat for tacos and pork sandwiches for 7 on a recent camping trip.  I froze what was left, and my husband and I finished that off in tacos again last night.  Excellent recipe!

Will make them again without the cinnamon. The cinnamon flavor stood out to me and it didn't compliment well.

This was great! We used a 2lb piece of pork but I used the same amount of seasoning. It was wonderful - the meat was moist and flavorful. We had lots of leftovers and it is delicious each time! Served with fresh tortillas, freshly made guacamole, and cheese.

I took the advice of other reviewers and tripled the spices (except the bay leaves and cinnamon). The pork was very delicious and very tender, but -but- I would have liked a more intense flavor. Maybe next time I will rub the spices on and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours, or I will first sear the pork. There are only two of us in the house, so after we ate plenty of carnitas we covered the remaining leftovers (probably 1/4 of the roast) in BBQ sauce and ate pulled pork sandwiches. Very good! The recipe with the changes suggested (perhaps quadrupling the spices) would probably be 5 stars, but as written, I rate it three stars

These carnitas are my new favorite thing ever! Better than any carnitas I've ever had in a restaurant! Followed the recipe, except I didn't have any coriander. Also used boneless country style ribs. Also followed the suggestion for baking the meat for 20 minutes to crisp it up, just spread it out on a cookie sheet and poured some of the liquid over it then baked til the liquid evaporated. So FREAKING good!!!!!!!!!

Very tasty and very simple. I served it on tortillas with avocado salad with bacon and sour cream. Also on this site. I think I will use the leftovers tonight to make cuban sandwiches.

I just cooked these today and I had to get on and tell you what a delicious recipe this is! I took some of the other reviewers' advice and tripled the spices - all but the cinnamon. I left that at 1/4 tsp. In my opinion, the cinnamon really makes this phenomenal, don't leave it out if you can help it! I also didn't turn the meat halfway through, but it still turned out tender and super flavorful! This is definitely a keeper.

Excellent recipe.  I slow cooked for 6 hours and didn't put it in the oven, and it was just fine.  Excellent with the avocado bacon salad recipe (although I used turkey bacon).

This recipe was amazing! As a carnita-lover, I am very impressed. I followed the advice of those below me and doubled the spice mixture. I will do this again, with the exception of the Cinnamon, leaving it at 1/4 teaspoon.

This was so good. I used pork tenderloin to make it leaner and it was still great.  I though we would have leftovers to freezer but we ate it for several meals and didn't have any left.  Even my six year old loved it.

I will never order carnitas at a restaurant again! I LOVE carnitas, and these were the best I've ever had.  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and cut the 4 lb roast into quarters and doubled the spices. Because of our meal timing, the meat actually cooked for about 13 hours. It was unbelievably tender and delicious.   We served it with warmed tortillas, mexican cheese, and chopped cilantro and onion. Amazing blend of flavors.

Good recipe.  I used a 4lb pork roast and did just about triple the seasoning mix (although I did only use the 1/4 cup of cinnamon which I will omit altogether next time). I also used only about a cup and a half of the chicken broth which was even a little more than needed because the pork let off a ton of it's own natural juices.  When it was finished cooking, I let it cool in the crock pot for about 30 minutes and then cut it into pieces and put it in a 400 degree oven for a couple of minutes until it was just crisped up on the outside.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks PopRocks!

This recipe is a favorite of my family, they love it. It is so easy. I have made it with a shoulder roast and a butt roast, both are pefect. The only thing that I change is I omit the cimmamon and sometimes I add a can of diced chillies.

I doubled the spice mixture (minus the cinnamon..left that as is) and added 1 tbs of chili powder and abt 1 tbp of pepper. It turned out great. I think I will double the chili powder next time.... I like my food with a bit more kick. :)

I thought this recipe was great.  I left out the cinnamon as many others advised.  It came out  juicy and flavorful.  We tried as taco filling and also on buns.  It was a hit with my husband and kids!

I put too much liquid in because I used less meat and maybe that is why these weren't as flavorful as I was hoping - I even tripled the seasoning.  A suggestion - if you double (or triple) the seasoning, double/triple the cinnamon, too!  I see a lot of people didn't do that.  I did, and I could still not taste it very well.  Wish there could have been more - I really like cinnamon in meat dishes!  I used stew meat because I was able to find a two pound package, perfect for my family.  The meat just fell apart ... so yummy.

Everyone loved this, I tweaked it a little. I seared the meat first. I cut slits into the meat and added four garlic cloves sliced thinly into the meat. I also added onions and 2 jalapenos. I could only find a 6lb bone in butt, so I used it and cooked on high for 6 hours then low for 1 hour. So tender and very flavorful.

Excellent. I tripled the spices but didn't add any coriander and only 3 bay leafs. Next time I'll use a little less cumin. Cooked the roast in t a crock pot 10 hours then in the broiler for 20. So good. Company just loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice and so easy! I put a couple quartered potatoes on the bottom because I thought they would taste great cooked in the juices, and they did! After shredding the meat I definately needed to add the juices back in for moisture so we made, "wet burritoes". Flavor was interesting- next time I will leave out the cinnamon. I didn't have corriander to use this time. Next time I will add some onion and maybe a pepper or chili of some sort.

I didn't cook in the oven as some reviews have suggested. Husband says it was too dry that way but he can't get enough of it straight out of the pot.  We serve it with corn tortillas, spanish rice and beans.  Delicious!

I loved this recipe. It was delicious straight out of the slow cooker. I doubled the spices and baked it in the oven but I think next time I will serve it straight from the slow cooker. I served it with homemade pico de gallo and guacamole. Amazing.

Everyone who ate this took one bite and declared they'd died & gone to heaven.  I didn't change a thing to the recipe but I might make 2 the next time just so I have more leftovers.  We ate this  over rice, on tortillas, as a nacho topper and cold out of the storage container with a fork.  Delicious every time.

It was very tasty as a starter for Bbq. It was definitely missing the traditional texture of carnitas.

Absolutely amazing! I love this recipe! It smells great all day and tastes like stuff you'd get at a super authentic Mexican restaurant. I left out the cinnamon only because I don't care for it. I also spread them out on a cookie sheet and baked them at 250 for about 20 minutes. So crispy and delicious. These were an instant hit with the family! Definitely going to make them again very soon!

I must agree, this was so easy and SO Delicious!!  I used a slightly larger roast and I tripled spices as suggested except for the cinnamon. I did not have any bay leaves,  and dont think it mattered.  however next time i will add more cinnamon, I liked the flavor of it.  i threw in a quartered onion, orange and jalapeno half way thru cooking.  Cut my roast in 3 chunks to fit in the crock pot and it was ready a few hours early.  Leftovers were amazing and I cant wait to make this again.  SO GOOD!

I followed other reviewers' advice and tripled all the seasonings, but completely left out the cinnnamon. I also added a couple of chipotles, cilantro and some onion. I also baked the pork once it was done to crisp it a little bit. I made this as our Christmas dinner and it was great. The pork was falling apart and delicious. Thanks for the recipe

I made this today and it was AMAZING! I lived in Mexico for 6 years and missed having carnitas... this is the closest I've ever had. I did double the spices (not the cinnamon) did use cloves and about 3/4c coke and added the juice of two oranges and baked it for 20 mins at 375 when done. We warmed corn tortillas and topped the tacos with onions, cilantro and a squeeze of lime! Super easy and super amazing!!

this was really good and really easy, I tripled the spices except for the cinnamon which was great, because I can't imagine having enough rub otherwise. I added cilantro and lime juice to the broth. The only thing I would change is to add a little less cumin next time.

This was nothing less than fantastic, although I did riff on the recipie a bit... Used real garlic cloves instead of powder. 4-5 crushed, but not chopped. Doubled cumin, oregano, coriander. Added an orange and lime, cut into eighths. Added 12 oz. can of cola. (YES, REALLY!) Also cut shoulder into 3 pieces. I believe most of these modifications have been mentioned in other reviews... This made one fantastic load of tacos, with BBQ pork sandwitches later in the week...

This is a great recipe.  I love carnitas from restuarants and this is very close.  The only thing I did differently was to fry the meat to give it a little crisp right before I served it.

Wow this was amazing. My husband and I are addicted to the mom and pop taco stands around here, so I decided to give it a try. Our favorite is the carnitas tacos, but I always find them a bit too greasy (which doesn't keep me from eating them), so I decided to try to make it myself. This recipe was so good. I used a six pound roast, cut into four chunks, and tripled the spices. Usually my crock pot cooks hot, but I was getting a little worried after seven hours, so I bumped it up to high for the rest of the time. The meat was so tender and juicy. We served on small white corn tortillas with hot sauce, and decided this was just as good as the real stuff, without all the grease!

Great recipe, tripled the spices as others mentioned.  By accident I misread the recipe, thought there was ground black pepper in it, so that went in with the other stuff hehe.  Ended up really good and not peppery at all.

This was good. Next time I will leave out the cinnamon though. I added 1 tsp. adobo seasoning along with cumin and garlic powder. I served on warmed corn tortillas and topped with fresh cilantro, tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream.

Love this recipe. I always double or triple the spices but I have never used coriander since I don't have any. I usually throw in a bit of onion powder and several whole chopped up jalapenos for a bit of kick. After its done in the slow cooker I put it in the oven under the broiler to crisp it up a bit and serve it with re-fried beans, baked plantains and rice.

I usually make carnitas on the stove top, but the recipe looked good since it was in the slow cooker.  I cooked it exactly as stated, the spices were very nice.  However, the meat came out pasty and sorry, I did not like the texture of it.  Hubby and kids thought it was only ok.    I do not plan on using this method again.

Without a doubt, this recipe will go into my recipe box.  As good as some of the restaurants I have had pulled pork in (even better)  After cooking, I pulled the pork apart with two forks.  Made some white rice and substituted one of the cups of water with the juices from the roast to add flavor.  Heated black beans from a can to pour over the rice, and fried bananas in a little butter.  OMG! The pork fell apart.  Don't change anything in this recipe.  Thank You!

I made this dish for my daughter's first birthday party along with Ronaldo's Beef Carnitas.  It was a burrito buffet - flour tortillias, homemade salsas (complements of the husband), cheese, sour cream, guac, onions, peppers, and some of our favourite hot sauces.  We love Mexican food and we loved this.  Thanks for sharing!
***update: After shredding the pork, I spread it out on a cookie sheet and baked it at 300 for 10-15 minutes.  It crisped up a little, which was awesome!

While I wasn't blown away by this my picky eating sister and husband devoured it along with my kids.  I'll definitely be making it again.  I also didn't read the instructions very well and didn't turn it at the 5 hour mark but it was still great.  Next time though I think I will rub the spices on the night before.

I don't know if my cut of meat was too fatty, or what, but the flavor was not quite what I had hoped.  Thanks for the recipe but I'm going to stick with my Cooking Light carnitas  one for now.

So good! My family loved it! When it was done in the slow cooker, I put it into a pan and cooked it the oven for about 25 min. to crisp it up a bit. I served it in tortillas with tomatoes, onions and avocados. It was fantastic.

This was amazing.  I was going to make Posole but saw this recipe so tried it and was glad I did. After reading reviews I doubled the spices except the cinnamon and it came out moist and soooooo good.  Will have with homemade refried beans and rice tomorrow.  Can't wait.  I usually go buy carnitas meat; not anymore.  Oh, my pork shoulder had a bone, but it didn't seem to make any difference.  Thanks for the recipe.  The next day I fed this to my family.  My daughter over ate, my son-in-law loved it, my oldest grandson made yummy noises and my husband said I could open a restaurant with this recipe.

Really Good!  I put it in the crockpot for about 9 hours on low.  I couldn't find pork shoulder roast so I used port butt roast instead I really don't know the difference especially since it was slow cooked.  This is a keeper!!!  Thanks for sharing!

Love the Slow Cooker Carnitas, except I didn't really like the cinnnamon taste and while I doubled the rest of the spices I didn't double that and I still didn't like tasting it, so I doubt that I repeat that in the future.

Wonderful!  Wow!  You will love it.  I followed the recipe exactly, but took the advice of many reviewers and doubled the rub.  I also cut my 4 pound pork roast up into 4 smaller pieces.  I didn't know what coriander was, so I skipped it... found out later it's another name for Cilantro.  Oh well, it didn't matter.  The pork was extremely tender and absolutely delicious.  I served the meat in a whole wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomatos, cheese, and a salsa sauce.  Really good!

Simple recipe I used in enchilada's instead of chicken.  Worked well and would make again.  I did not cook for 10 hours, meat was done in 5 in my slow cooker, so be careful.

delicious delicious delicious! I was only cooking for 3 people so i cut the meat in half and still doubled on the spices! I also cut half an onion in wedges and put it on the side of the roast. all day the house smelled wonderful! after only about 8 hours it was well cooked and as i pulled it out of the slow cooker, it was falling apart. it was very tender and flavorful meat! i made flauntas with it, with suggestions from another recipe. very tasty and enjoyable. i will make this recipe again and maybe make BBQ pulled pork sandwiches out of it.

A really flavorful and easy recipe! I didn't have any chicken stock  so I put 3 chipotle en adobo in the bottom of the slow cooker with enough water to come to 3/4 of my 4 pounds of meat. Following  previous advice I tripled the seasonings, added a little beef bouillon and reduced the salt. I plan to freeze portions and will be making this useful recipe again.

Absolutely delicios!  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to double the spices--definitely suggest that!  Also, throwing the shredded pork into the oven at 400 F for 8 minutes or so was a great idea to crisp up the edges a little.  We will definitely be doing this one again...but with friends, so they can see my mad cooking skills!  Thanks!!!

DELISH! Followed the recipe exactly except for doubling the spice rub. I wouldn't omit any of the spice ingredients.  The various spices work beautifully together.  I made a miscalculation that turned into a pleasant surprise.  I started everything in my slowcooker about 5 pm, and planned to refrigerate and start again in the morning. I ended up cooking till about 11pm then setting the cooker on warm and left it there til I got up next morning.  Started it up again and cooked it another 5 hours.  WOW! It was soooo juicy and tender and perfect.  Thankyou SO much for this yummy reciped.  BTW, Like another reviewer, I rolled the meat in warm corn tortillas an also warm flour tortillas along with guacamole dip, sour cream, salsa, and shredded cheese.  This is a definite keeper. Hmmm, think I'll make enchiladas with green chile sauce with the leftover meat.

Delicious!!! I have tried other slow cooker meat recipes and they all came out tasting like something from a can. This was moist and perfect. Use it in tacos, or for pulled pork sandwiches.

No leftovers! All 7 kids and husband really enjoyed this and gave plenty of compliments and thank you's. The changes I made were using water instead of chicken broth, no bay leaves, no coriander and doubled the spices except the cinnamon. I fixed some mexican rice, corn, black beans and tortillas to go with it. Delicioso!

I have mixed reviews on this one. The meat turned out wonderful - moist and fell apart, but we absolutely hated the cinnamon taste in this receipe. We could not get beyond the odd flavor. I may try to make this again without the cinnamon to see if we like this any better.  Very disappointed.

Loved it!  I left out the cinnamon (had a previous bad experience with cinnamon in a middle eastern stew) and I did cut the meat into large chunks for better permeation of the spices.  I also pan fried it in a  little veg oil to crisp it up a bit- served in tortillas with pico de gallo & guac- it was awesome!  Will definitely make this again.

This was an easy and delicious recipe! I read a lot of the tips and found it was helpful to triple the spices. I rubbed the meat with half the spice mixture and let it sit overnight. I also crisped it up in the broiler, and it was sooo good. The cinnamon is AWESOME! If you love unique, delicious flavors, try this recipe!

I've made this one before and its great!  Didn't change a thing to the actual recipe.  I did put the meat in the oven after cooking in the crockpot to "crisp" it up some.

This was very, very good.  I want to make it all the time.  I did as the other reviews suggested and doubled up on the spices except for the cinnamon.  I also found that pan frying it afterwards really brought out the flavors in it. Will make it again.

Totally awesome, plenty of leftovers to eat off of for a few meals, and great low-stress meal to make for entertaining. I also quickly ran out of rub so I tripled it as recommended and it was fabulous. I've made this twice and received many compliments (and you barely do anything!) People think you slaved in the kitchen all day! Chili powder is a must and I used minimal cinnamon (mostly b/c i'm afraid of the strong flavor). This will be added to my permanent recipe book! PS: if you want it spicy, add red pepper flakes!

This recipe was so easy and so delicious!  My husband likes the outside of meat to have a bit of cripsness so I lightly seared the shredded pork in a pan and he loved it!  The flavor was fantastic.  Will surely be using this recipe again!!

This is a fabulous recipe -- it doesn't get any easier than this. The spices are wonderful and the smells while cooking are enough to make your mouth water. We had tacos with this and I also made a tasty chili out of some that I chopped and reserved before shredding the rest.

This was super easy to make. I love anything that can be made using a slow cooker.  I do agree with other posters; I doubled the rub (all except the cinnamon). I think next time i may use just a pinch of cinnamon- even with just 1/4 teaspoon it was still a little over powering.  Regardless this was really, really good.

I smelled this cooking and had a flashback to when I was a kid in the kitchen of my great grandmother, Ruby Ortiz, who was once married to the mayor of Santa Fe. Very authentic, yummy recipe!

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly! It smelled amazing as it was cooking all day! The meat fell apart and was super moist & delicious. I served the carnitas with tortilla's, onion, and chopped cilantro.

These were very good.  They were kinda sweet from the cinnamon.  I used beef stock instead of chicken cuz thats what I had on hand.  This meat was literally falling apart.  We put it in tacos and burritos.  I will be making again!  :)

I've made this recipe several times and every time I use different suggestions given on this site. Some suggest doubling the spice mix, others suggest more or less of one ingredient or another. My favorite thing about this recipe is that while it is very good on it's own, once you make it a few times you can get a feel for how you want to tweak it to your own liking. Very good and easy for someone new to slow cooker cooking.

I LOVE this recipe! I make it a few times a month now and freeze it into individual burrito size servings and then just microwave it and pop it in the broiler for 5-10 minutes and it's absolutely delicious heated up this way. The only thing I do different is half the chicken stock and it turns out perfect. Thank you very much!

Loved it. My husband loves pork and so I tried this even though I could not get the "carnita" effect at home. It worked and is well worth the trouble. I used a 10 pound pork butt because I wanted to use the meat in another recipe. It took 10 hours to cook and not too long to shred. Thank you.

My husband requested carnitas, so I used this recipe - he gave it five stars and said it was the best dinner he's had in a long time.  Since I was cooking for only one person, I did not want to purchase a huge pork shoulder - I just used a 2 lb. pork ribeye.  Doubled all spices, used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, left out cinnamon.  Before seasoning, I cut the pork ribeye into two equal pieces and seasoned each separately to speed cooking time and enhance the flavor of the spices.  Turned meat after 1.5 hours, shredded after 3.5 hours.  Placed meat on a baking sheet with juices from slow cooker, baked at 400 degrees for 20 mins. as suggested by another reviewer.  Served with Mexi-corn, Spanish Rice and greens as a huge entree salad.

I also doubled the spices but not the cinnamon and salt as suggested. I think letting it sit overnight would be best to infuse some flavor as mine wasn't too much, but we still liked it. I think I'll use beer next time instead of chicken broth as well. Putting it in the oven is ingenius. My husband is still gobbling it up for lunch! I used a pork shoulder as it was cheap but I had no idea what to do with it, this was perfect.

My husband loved this and he is not a big pork eater.  I didn't have oregano, so I skipped that and we like things a little spicy so I added fresh ground black pepper to the rub.  Like other reviewers, I also tripled the rub, and then put it all under the broiler for about 5 minutes to crunch it up.  We will definitely be making this again!

I am going to give this 5 stars even though I messed it up and didn't especially LOVE it.  1st of all, I took another reviewers suggestion and doubled the spices which I am glad I did for the most part.  2nd, I was short on time so I cut the pork shoulder into 6 or 7 hunks and then covered in spice mixture.  This cut the cook time down a lot.  I then cooked on high for the 1st hour and low for another 3 hours.  My big mistake was misreading the recipe and after doubling the spices I accidentally put 1 whole tsp of cinnamon in the mix.  Waaaay too much.  Next time I think I may just omit the cinnamon altogether.  To change things up, the next day we ate the left overs with BBQ sauce over a slice of bread.  Very good as well.  :-)

Made this to use for gorditas last night and chimichangas tomorrow night.  It's a great idea to make this all on the weekend and then plan several Mexican meals that come together quickly on weeknights.  We liked it.  Only, next time I would omit the cinnamon as we don't like the sweet taste even that little bit leaves all over the meat.

Awesome! Husband actually said this was awesome! Never gotten that out of him before. So needless to say, if I could give it more stars, I would. Threw out my other pork for tacos recipe. I did take the other reviews advice and doubled the spices, plus a little bit more. Left out the cinnamon and left the salt at 1 teaspoon. You won't need more. Put in 3/4 bulb garlic, chopped, instead of garlic powder. Used country style ribs, a pork chop and stew meat instead of roast (I was cleaning out freezer). Didn't matter, awesome anyways.

To be honest, we did not care for the flavor of the meat when I used exactly what the ingrediants were. I added alot of my own ingrediants, cooked it on high for 7 hrs and then baked it for 20 min on 400. I served it like authentic carnitas with onions, cilantro, avocado, salsa and limes...it was great with that!!!

OMG! This was great! I did take out of crock pot and put in a Pryrex dish pulled it apart and put in oven @ 350 for 30 minutes. It seemed to help with the grease. Next time I will do the rub the night before and wrap in syran wrap and keep in fridge for the night before I put it in the crock pot. I will definatley do again!

As per other reviewers' recommendations, I tripled all spices except the cinnamon.  Flavor didn't permeate well the meat; the coriander was too strong.  Although low sodium, the broth was inedible with the recipe's 1 tsp. of salt.  The only other change I made was to trim and to cut the pork into smaller pieces (to cook faster).  The meat was tender and moist - just not that yummy.

Very good and easy, maybe could be a bit more spicy and I'm thinking of adding jalepeno's or some other peppers next time.  I made burritos out of it, and used the leftovers to make pulled pork sandwiches - yummy - my husband loved it too.  Oh and it smelled wonderful as it was cooking!

Excellent!  I added chili powder, rubbed in the spices and then browned mine in a little olive oil on all sides before it headed to the pot.
The left-over's were used in a tamale pie the next night.  Can't wait to make it again!

Hubby said these made better fajitas than he'd had in an restaurant.  I added a quartered sweet onion to the crockpot, as well as fresh minced garlic.  Also quartered the meat and doubled the spices.

This is very, very good.  I too tripled the rub ingredients except for the cinnamon with fantastic results.  I added a few splashes of liquid smoke before cooking, and crumbled a beef boullion cube into the crock with 2 cups water.  Will definitely make this again.  I like mine simple, with white onion and cilantro on a corn tortilla and a squeeze of lime. Delicioso!

Awesome! So easy- it has a sweet, cinnamony flavor so some might need to add a kick to it, but I loved it and so did my kids.  I used water in lieu of chicken broth since I didn't want to run to the store and it was still amazing.  Thanks!

This was okay for us.  Something with the seasonings was not quite right.  I am thinking it is the coriander b/c I have made other carnita recipes without that which have turned out better.  Comes out very tender and shreds nice but the flavor just isn't right on.

FAB-ulous!  I have friend from the San Fransisco area, who has been on the hunt for good restaurant carnitas since I've known him (a few years). I never expected to run across a slow-cooker recipe for them, but love my slow cooker . . . so when I saw this, I had to try it. And OH MY GOD - LOVED this recipe. My husband (the only critic whose opinion I actively seek) also loved them. (Ya!) Oh - and the friend from The City  . . two enthusiastic thumbs up !  Thank you PopROcks !!!

I also tripled the amount of seasoning and coated all sides of the meat.  If I have any extra seasoning left over, I sprinkle it into the crockpot over the top of the broth.  Makes it so good.  My husband and I can't get enough of this dish.  Smells so good when it's cooking too!

Yummy!  Used chicken stock instead of broth and used cilantro leaves instead of ground coriander.  This was so good and easy too!  Made burritos with carnitas, guacamole, cheese and sour cream.  Will definitely make again-often!

As per other reviews, I doubled the spices and gave the shredded meat a quick trip to the oven to crisp some of it up.  It was the perfect mild but flavorful meat for burritos for my dad, who can't handle any heat at all, but still loves Mexican food!

This is so delicious and it fills your house with the most tempting aroma.  I love this.  I use a few boneless pork shoulder ribs instead of a whole and I also don't flip them half way through. This is my new favorite recipe!

This recipe was really good.  I browned all the sides before putting it in the crock pot and then fried them up to get them crispy after I shredded them.  I will definitely be making these again.  They were a huge hit for Cinco De Mayo served with corn tortillas, cilantro, and onions, just like in a taqueria!

Delicious!  I double the spices and added more salt.  2 hrs before it was done (I cooked it for about 9 hrs) I drained most of the liquid so that the outside of the pork would turn crispy.  It was incredible!  Served with small tortillas and all the fixins!

The flavor on this was very good. I think I'm still going to look for other recipes though because the carnitas we are looking for is fried at some point. I'll probably still use this occasionally as a convenient recipe in a slow cooker.

HELP! I bought a pork butt that was just under 4 pounds. Followed recipe almost exactly (tripled seasoning and omitted cinnamon). I just checked it after 4 hours and the temp was 170, I'm trying to shred it but it's difficult. I'm assuming I did something wrong. Had my crockpot on low but maybe it runs hot Flavor is good but it's not "falling apart" like other reviewers.

Tripled the spice mix for a 9 pound shoulder.  Added two teaspoons of liquid smoke to chicken broth.  Cooked low for 10 hours turning once. Fantastic with some chipotle hot sauce. Took to pot luck holiday lunch at work. No leftovers and tons of compliments.

So good! Only thing id change is less chicken stock and sub with water to cut some of the sodium. I did a taco rub on my meat and it came out so flavorful. Best cheat! Didnt want to bother with the individual spice mix.
Added half a lime to the pot and save the other half to use on my super large taco. :)

I made this two times - the first time, as written, with the exception being that I only had a 2 lb pork roast so I used the stated amounts of seasoning.  Perfect.  The second time I made it, still with a 2 lb roast, I added about 1/4 Cup of Puerto Rican Sofrito (green).  Again - perfect but with a little more flavor that we enjoyed.

This was quite tasty. I only went with 1.5 cups instead of 2 so it was less moist. Very tasty though

I gave this recipe five stars, but I would only give five stars based on how I changed it up a bit based on other reviews. I did NOT put any cinnamon in, and I doubled all of the rest of the spices. I used minced garlic, instead of powdered. Then after the 10 hours of cooking on low in the crockpot, I put it into a 9x13 baking dish and pulled it apart. Then took some of the liquid from the crockpot (about 1-1.5 cups), mixed it with a tablespoon plus of chili garlic? sauce and poured that over the meat. I then baked it at 400° for 20 minutes. This is absolutely a new family favorite, everyone loved it and devoured it! chili garlic sauce

The flavor and texture on this is really good!  Of course, it couldn’t be easier, in the crock pot.  I did put it under the broiler right before serving, just to get the crispy edges we love.  This combination of spices and seasonings was perfect for us.  Thank you for recipe! :) Freezes well.

I made this just as the recipe stated and it was excellent.  I made some carmelized onions to go with it and put tortillas. My husband and son both loved it. This is a keeper. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I followed the recipe with the exception of the cinnamon. When I removed it from the crockpot, I took several large chunks and braised them in stir fry oil (garlic flavor). That added a nice crunchy texture to the pork. I then took a quarter cup of the juice from the crockpot and drizzled over the braised pork to moisten. It was awesome. Without braising, the pork was very bland.

Very close to authentic Mexican carnitas!  I don't change a thing.  Put into soft taco shells with chopped onion, cilantro, and some Chulula Hot Sauce and, man, this is good eating!

wonderful, easy and delicious. I made per the recipe except I cooked it in a pressure cooker for one hour, I then put the shredded pork on a cookie sheet with parchment paper and baked 20 min at 400. It was a dream come true. I will make again for sure.

Instead of cinnamon I added one Mexican cinnamon stick (canela), 8 cloves, 10 orange rinds and squeezed a whole orange into the crockpot. Once everything 
Was done, I placed the shredded meat onto a cooking sheet and pour a few spoonfuls of sauce over the top. Broiled it for 5-10 minutes To get browned edges on the pork. PERFECT CARNITAS!

The meat flavor itself was good... giving 4 stars because while I liked it - my husband and kids didn’t enjoy the flavors. It wasn’t a family hit.

Came out AMAZING!!!!! I doubled up on the spices and used 4 garlic cloves and minced them in a garlic press. I used only a tsp of cinnamon and that was plenty. I bought a 4 lb roast and it came already in 6 pieces ready to be made into carnitas!!! I didn't add the coriander or bay leaves because I didn't have it on hand. 10 hours on slow and BAM!!! Best I've ever made!!!!!

Delicious!  Recommend using a little more salt and less cinnamon, otherwise it tastes just the carnitas at my favorite Mexican restaurant for only a fraction of the cost!

Loved this dish.  Even better than food truck carnitas IMHO.
I followed the recommendations and doubled the spices.  I even doubled the cinnamon as it adds a very unique and special flavor.  Many of the reviewers say they left it out, my advice is to try it with the cinnamon first.  It is very good.

This turned out amazing! It has a very unique flavor that I loved!!!  I used a 3.5 pork shoulder and, as suggested by other reviewers, doubled the spices --except for cinnamon-- I left that the same. I rubbed the pork the night before  - added the chicken broth & bay leaves the next morning & let it go for 10 hours (the last hour or so I added a can of green chilis that I found lurking in the pantry). Right before serving, I browned meat under the broiler & served with a variety of taco toppings (cilantro, pico, avocado, shredded cabbage, lime, onion, sour cream). OH MY! Can't wait to try the leftovers tonight with bbq sauce on buns!

This was very easy and versatile!  I followed the recipe (tho was tempted to double or triple the spice, based on other reviews) and this smelled amazing while cooking.  I did bake it in the oven for about 20 minutes and I felt it got a little too dry, so would skip that step next time.  We had it in soft tacos as well as on buns for sandwiches and had leftovers with BBQ sauce.  I would definitely make this again!

Really good, pretty easy to prepare. I was going to make it yesterday, but didn't have enough time, so I mixed up the spices and put the meat and spices in a ziplock and left it overnight. This morning, popped it into the crock pot and was good to go for dinner.  The only change I made was to triple the spices.

Made it as written.  I loved it, 5 stars.  Wife is very picky and sensitive, gave it 3 stars and said she is being generous.  Talking about making it again with no coriander and half the cinnamon to be more to her taste.

Wow! This was seriously delicious. The smell alone, that filled my house, was mouth watering. It took no time to prep and little effort to cook, but the outcome tasted like I’d been slaving away over the stove all day. I followed the recipe to a T, but I didn’t have pork shoulder, so I used what I had which was a nice fatty pork loin roast. I was a bit worried that it’d be dry since it didn’t have quite as much fat as a pork shoulder, but it actually turned out juicy and tender. If I could rate this 10 stars I would. Thanks for sharing!! I can not wait to make this again.

Very easy and delicious! I like my carnitas to have a little crisp so after the crock pot I put on a baking sheet and put under the broiler for a few minutes. Then I squeezed fresh orange and lime juice on it. Yummy!!!

I used a pork shoulder roast with a bone in and it turned out great.  Followed the advice of the reviewer who doubled the spices except for the cinnamon and I'm glad I did.  It may have been on the bland side if not.  After shredding the meat,  I also put  it in the over for 10 minutes  at 400 degrees.   Used the meat as a  taco filling and it was great.  Will definitely make again. Thanks for a terrific recipe.

Great, Loved it! I seasoned the pork as directed plus just added onion powder too. Seasoned it during the day left it in refrigerator several hours bc I decided to cook it overnight. woke up to a delicious smell in the house!  We had some on buns for lunch w/ BBQ sauce and then Mexican style dinner! I will make it again!

Excellent!!  Used 2 lbs boneless pork shoulder, cooked 4 hrs on high.  Doubled seasonings except cinnamon.  Replaced Cumin with Chili Powder as I am allergic to Cumin.  Very easy recipe with great taste. Served with toppings of cheese, salsa, sour cream, hot sauce, and fresh cilantro.

Family really enjoyed it and I followed the suggestion to get it out of the crockpot and put it in the oven to make the meat a bit crispy with adding the juice back to the meat.  Also, I used very little cinnamon and forgot to use the coriander.  Delish!

This is amazing!  I no longer purchase carnitas from local market. It's easy and delicious.  I sear my roast before putting in the slow cooker and the flavor of the spices further infuses in the meat.

I am NOT a cook, however this was easy enough for even a horrible cook like myself. The smell is divine and it tasted great!  I doubled the spices as well and really wished I had tripled it. I took the advice of someone else on here and put the spices on it overnight to settle in. It was awesome!

I finally made this amazingly easy to make dish! I used pork tenderloin instead of the called for pork shoulder and it was still delicious! The flavoring was right on - i would have never thought of using cinnamon as an ingredient  but it all tied together nicely! To give the carnitas a bit of a roasted look i shredded the meat and browned it in vegetable oil just long enough to brown it a bit! My family is already asking when I'm making this again!

This recipe is so versatile. It is now one of my very favorite was to prepare a pork roast. my favorite use for the shredded meat is pulled pork nachos, but can be used in tacos, burritos, sandwich buns etc. Yum!

Very flavorful. Made with additional spice as others suggested and did include the cinnamon (but not doubled). I did add the spices to the meat the night before along with fresh garlic. Cut a 4 1/2 lb. pork loin roast into 4 pieces as others suggested as well. I added a half cup of tequila to the chicken broth. Did finish half off in the oven with fresh lime drizzled and some sea salt for carnitas. The other half I usedd for pulled pork sandwiches by adding barbeque sauce.

Made this for a taco night dinner party and it was a hit! I omitted the coriander because I didn’t have any on hand. As some reviewers suggested, I tripled the spices (including the salt and cinnamon). I added the juice of a large orange and a cooked a couple orange slices with the rind attached with just one can of chicken broth. I threw in a few sprigs of fresh cilantro and some diced onion on top at the beginning of the cook time. It came out perfectly cooked overnight after 10 hours. Very complex flavor and juicy texture.

LOVE IT! I would definitely make it again. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spices (except for the salt, and only a touch more cinnamon -> more like 1.5x the cinnamon instead of double). I actually only slow cooked it 6-8 hours (4-5 on high, pulled it apart, and the rest on low). Then i spread it out on a cookie sheet and baked it at 400F for 20 minutes. Added the cilantro at the end. Mouth watering.

This was nicely tender and very easy to shred.  
We like things a bit spicy, so we tripled the spices (not the salt) .  We did omit the cinnamon, as so many reviews recommended.
This was really good and we'll make it again, but we want to spice it up even a bit more; even with picante it wasn't quite what we hoped for.
We might cook it a little longer after shredding to enhance the flavor.

As suggested by many other reviewers, I tripled the spices. I do feel like the cinnamon and coriander were still too much. I will only double the recipe and cut back on those 2 next time. I was not impressed with the pork alone, so I added red chile and potatoes and made burritos. Overall, still good.

This was a good recipe. I doubled all the spices, except the salt. I omitted the cinnamon.  I followed the recipe the rest of the way. After 3 hours in the slow cooker, I cut my pork shoulder in half. When serving, I scooped the meat into a soft tortilla. I combined Velveeta queso cheese with jarred salsa and poured it over the tortilla. Better than expected.

Following recommendations from others, I doubled the spices, except salt did only 1.5. Since there was such a large amount of no cinnamon reviews, I decided to leave that out as well. I did a 4 lb on high in the slow cooker for 6 hours. It came wonderfully delicious and fall apart tender! I cooked for only my daughter and I, so have a lot of leftovers. Going to reheat some for dinner tonight with BBQ sauce on buns, inviting a couple relatives.

This was fantastic.   I have never had pork carnitas before, but definitely will be having them again.  I doubled all the spices except the cinnamon, as suggested by other reviewers and added 4 cloves of sliced fresh garlic.  My daughter and husband are begging me not to lose this recipe.

Great and SIMPLE carnitas recipe--definitely a keeper!  I've been looking for a good recipe, and this one is perfect.  I was skeptical that the meat would be tough by cooking it in the crockpot for 10 hours, but it was super tender.  I broiled mine in the oven for about 20 mins like some other users were suggesting when it was finished to crisp it up a bit and make the texture closer to a traditional recipe without adding fat by frying it in lard.  I used just a DASH of cinnamon, but I would agree, definitely keep it very minimal or cut it out entirely.  I used both garlic powder and minced garlic and I didn't have oregano, so I added about 3 TBs of lime juice and then some Tajin seasoning to my seasoning mix instead to add some more flavors.  We served this over rice, black beans, and veggies for a tasty weeknight dinner of burrito bowls!  YUM!

Absolutely delicious. I was so hungry from smelling this cook all day that I didn’t do the extra time in the oven to crisp up the pork. Very tender, it practically melted in my mouth. I’m looking forward to the leftovers.

Great flavor! I served it with onion, cilantro and lime, and it became a new family favorite. The only adjustments I made were to double the seasonings and cut up the pork into about 8 pieces, just to get the flavor into the meat a little more while cooking. I also broiled the meat for a couple of minutes to make it a little crispy before serving.

We make this quite a bit. It's easy and delish. We speed it up by going on high for the first 2-3 hours. Great reipe. And the cinnamon and coriander really bring out the flavor of the meat.

This is such an easy yet delicious tecipe! Thanks so much for sharing! I had only a two pound pork shoulder with the bone in and followed the recipe except I had to replace the oregano with 1tsp dried basil since I didn’t have any oregano. It was tender and moist in 8 hours on low heat setting. I followed other reviewers and spread the meat out on a baking dish with some of the juices and baked it at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. I served it with Spanish rice, soft tortillas, home made picco de gallo, sour cream, guacamole, and hot sauce. Everyone made their own soft tacos and loved it! Even my three picky eaters want to have this again!

I love this recipe!  I've made it several times and I just love the touch of cinnamon.  I've used every kind of pork cut and its delicious every time.  The only thing I did differently was to just sprinkle each spice on the pork rather than mix it before applying.  Just be sure you don't pour the broth over the top.  Enjoy!!

I've been making this recipe for quite a few years  now. I don't use quite as much cinnamon but I do like the unique taste it adds when I use a little bit. Sometimes I cook this in the oven.  Either way it is so delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed others advice and tripled the spices except for the cinnamon (1/4 tsp) and salt (1.5 tsp). Honestly, it was too much. I felt like I wasted a lot of spice as the meat would have been well covered if I had only doubled the spices.  If I make it again, I would only double the spices. I would also add 1 tsp of chili pepper for some heat. I shredded the meat with 1/2 hour left in time and let it all just soak in the juice.  My family liked this, but I wasn't as wowed as I have been in the past.

I use this recipe for carnitas. I also cook this up for Cuban sandwichs. it's the best. I generally put it all in the slow cooker vs. baking. I follow the recipe and it's always turned out perfect.

This is soooo easy and delicious, and not to mention how many people it feeds (family of 7)! Today is about the 4th time I have made it for my family. We put it in tortillas, over nachos, and just mix the left over meat with rice, corn and beans, or in salad for a delicious carb free dish the next day. I too double the seasoning and it comes out perfect. THANK YOU for this yummy recipe! Grat?eful busy mom :)

I tripled the spice and added chipotle chili powder for a kick.  It turned out delicious.  I find that with allrecipes I have to double or triple the herbs and spices for better flavor.

Amazing.  Used a 4.5lb roast, doubled all but cinnamon in spice rub (used called for amount of cinnamon).  At the 5hr mark, I sort of broke it up in crock so all pieces were in liquid.

So delicious! I tripled the spices like others suggested and it was perfect. I can’t even imagine how it would be with the original spice measurements. Cooked it for the full 10 hours and it was super moist and easy to pull apart. This one is a keeper!

It was good - I put the rub on the night before. Next time, I'll use fresh garlic, more cumin, less cinnamon. After shredding, I crisped it up in the pan just a bit. 

Lots of leftovers!

Had a 5.67 pound pork shoulder, so I increased the amount of spices by 1/4, but only used a dash of cinnamon. I let it cook on low for 10 hours and then dropped it to the warm setting overnight (approximately 12 more hours). It was fall off the bone tender and made the best bbq sandwiches.

Great recipe, everyone loved it! I did up the flavor by adding additional spices to the rub, including Montreal Steak and additional cumin and some red pepper flakes. This turned out so well, people went back for seconds and even thirds! Will definitely make it again. May try reducing the liquid after the pork is done cooking and adding some enchilada sauce to make it into a Chile Rojo/Carnitas -style dish next time but really is just about perfect as it is!

The only thing I did different was crisp up the meat. I sprayed canola oil cooking spray in a frying pan to crisp up the meat and sautéed onion with it. We did a pineapple salsa with them, jalapeños, lettuce, and sour cream on browned flour tortillas, so yummy!

Super easy and incredibly yummy!  I have made beef and chicken crockpot recipes recently so wanted to try out a pork recipe.  This was the best!  I used a pork tenderloin but didn't stray from the recipe otherwise.  This will be added to my favorites and will be made often, I'm sure.

added some mexican seasonings when they've been around and cooked down some of the liquid... Great with pickled red onions, cilantro and a mexican crumbling cheese on a tortilla

These were so easy and tasty! I followed recommendations and doubled all of the seasonings besides the cinnamon. Then I cubed my roast and rubbed it with the seasonings. I seared the cubed pork I a mixture of butter and bacon grease then threw it in my electric pressure cooker for 20 minutes. Served it up with avocado, red onion, cherry tomatoes, and Monterey Jack cheese. They were a hit!

I made this with smaller pieces of meat.  It turned out very well.  I used the spices as the recipe indicated. I thought it tasted "just right"!

I signed up for allrecipes JUST to leave a comment! OH MY FRICKIN' GOODNESS!! BEST RECIPE SO FAR and I've tried about 3 since I've started cooking. 

The reviews helped me to choose this recipe. 

I did what the reviews said, "tripled the ingredients, EXCEPT the cinnamon." 

I also didn't triple the chicken broth because it was enough liquid for my 6 qt, and the 5.2 lb pork shoulder.

I added some cloves of garlic, crushed...because I LOVE garlic, and some chili powder.

Didn't have my homemade salsa on hand, but I just ate this for breakfast. Fried it up a little, added scrambled egg, tortilla, and squeezes of lime...YUM

I skipped the cinnamon and doubled the rest of the spices.  I served mine in a flour tortilla with cotija, cilantro, slow cooker pintos, and a squeeze of lime.  It was delicious.

The only change I made was to add some Adobe seasoning. I served it with flour tortillas, black beans, cheese, cilantro, salsa, sautéed bell peppers and onions, and sour cream.  It is my family’s favorite meal now.

This is the first time I've attempted to make carnitas in a slow cooker. It was very simple to follow this recipe and the end result were absolutely deliciois burritos. The aroma throughout  the house was amazing too!

I will absolutely make this recipe again! it was fantastic. I made it while at the beach for a girls trip and we ate off of it for days. The only thing i will modify in the future is a little more garlic salt because the meat was just a bit sweet and i would also add some cayenne pepper and chili powder for a little, desired heat.

I was amazed at how tasty the pork turned out. My entire family gobbled it up on tacos having 2nds and 3rds! I liked how simple it was putting it in the slow cooker and letting it simmer all day.

This was so good that I see it being part of my future forever! I did double the spices, minus the cinnamon, since the blend looked awesome but not enough for our taste.  The only real difference is that I left the spices on the pork for a couple of hours and then used my instant pot instead of slow cooking. I sauteed the meat and then cooked it on manual for 50 minutes using the rest of the recipe as is. I also decided to put in oven to crisp up a bit but then added it back to some of the juice to keep the leftovers moist. Amazing! Thank you!

This was definitely a tasty dish- especially after taking the advice of others to roast/bake it in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 min. to get the crispy edges. I also tripled the spices for a 6 lb. pork shoulder, but kept the ratio exactly as the recipe states. 
Something wasn't quite what we were looking for, maybe too much cinnamon, as other reviewers suggested. I'll try it again without the cinnamon next time.

My entire family loved this recipe. I would say it has just a tad too much cinnamon but otherwise it was excellent. We made tacos a few times and machaca with it. 
After shredding the meat I pan fried it with onion to get those yummy crisp edges for carnitas taco

I tried the meat by itself and found the cinnamon to be really overpowering, but once it was made into tacos, it wasn't noticeable. I think I would leave it out next time. I served my tacos in fried corn tortillas with fresh pico de gallo, cotija cheese, and shredded lettuce, and they were delicious.

I've been making this recipe for years. It is one of the easiest dishes to make, yet always impresses family members and friends. It's very versatile too - good enough to eat alone, but we've also added BBQ sauce to make pulled pork sandwiches. The only change I make is that I double the spice recipe and depending on my mood, I sometimes leave out the cinnamon.

This was amazing!  It was just like my favorite mexican restaurant. I doubled everything but the cinnamon. After it was done in slow cooker I threw it on my Blackstone griddle to crisp it up. Topped with Cilantro and crumbled cheese. Delicious!

What a great mix of flavors, minus the cinnamon.  I'm not a fan of it in meat.  I meant to put in some cilantro and am so glad I didn't.  It doesn't need it.  The second one I make will have it as I do want to experiment with this recipe.  The recipe is for 4lbs. of meat, I doubled all seasoning's for a 6 lb. pork butt. Trimmed entire fat cap off and left internal marbling to help with keeping it moist.  I didn't bother turning the meat as I wanted the top to keep its dry rub.  I'm keeping the liquid minus any fat to add to some bones for stock making.

Adjustments from recipe: doubled spices, used fresh garlic, omitted cinnamon, 2 cups of broth became half cup broth, half cup lime juice, 1 cup orange juice. Broiling is a must. To reheat, put in pan, add some juice, broil briefly. Good as new. This recipe is delicious.

Sooo Good. I used it for street style tacos. I followed other people's advice about increasing seasoning.  I doubled everything except the salt and cinnamon.  I thought it was perfect, my husband who likes stronger flavors wanted to see triple the seasoning.

Delicious as written (tripled spices for rub except only doubled the cinnamon for a 4# roast) and I added some frozen chopped onions and cilantro while cooking as some suggested. Smells so good while cooking and have served it after putting it under broiler to crisp up the ends as well as not doing that and my family LOVES this recipe both ways! Made it a week later with 7# of meat so it would last longer this time!

I added 1 t. of ground ancho chili powder  to the spices.  After I shredded the meat I added some salt and pepper to taste. I  then filled flour tortillas with the meat filling and rolled it like a rolled taco and fried it to make flautas. I topped them with guacamole and drizzled it with mexican sour cream and sprinkled shredded cheese on top.They were delicious. Everyone raved about them. We loved them so much that I made this recipe twice in a week.

So tasty and simple too! I didn't have corriander so I took a risk and used Garam Masala instead which. . .I think has corriander in it. It turned out great! I'll make it that way again. This dish wasn't super flavorful but I was ok with that because then I could still enjoy the subtle flavor of the pork itself. It was perfectly fall-apart tender after 6 hours on low with the four pound roast.

I have been on this site for a while now and have never rated or reviewed a recipe  because I have always tweaked or changed it. However, this recipe is fantastic as is. At first, I was skeptical of the cinnamon and did not include it. The 2nd time was another matter. Do not be afraid of the cinnamon! It adds a sweet undertone to the overall robust flavor of the rub & pork. I just recently made this for a party (used a 9.5lb bone-in pork butt) and got extremely good reviews. I do agree with other reviewers that you need to double or triple the recipe (even for the called for 4lb pork shoulder). My kids (6y & 8Y) like it as well. I have used this spice rub on chicken and is just as good. Thanks to the original poster for a great recipe.

I made this like 50 times 
Oven and slow cooker 
Doesn't matter how you make it you need to use Mexican seasonings or it will off set the taste of the meat when you get it 
I know this because I am a top chef at a restaurant

I’ve made this before, but forgot about doubling the spices and cutting up the meat as others suggested. It really does make a difference. It was a bit more bland than before. I’m trying something out, I added more spices to the juices and put the leftovers back in to soak in more flavor. I think it will work.

This recipe is great. So flavorful, and you can do so many different things with the meat. We all ate it with tortillas and toppings the first night. With leftovers I made a BBQ sandwich for DH, a quesadilla for DS, just served by itself with rice for DD, and I had it in a grilled cheese. I forgot to turn the meat over while it was cooking, but it still cooked fine. I took mine out at 8 hours.

Ok this is really yummy! I tripled the spice mix & skipped the cinnamon. I also accidentally skipped the chicken broth. I cut up the meat into smaller pieces to roll it in the spices. Delicious! Oh yeah & I cooked it on high about 5 hours.

Loved the subtle flavours of this recipe.  I froze a number of two servings sizes of left-overs. (yes, there were some; I live alone! } Whenever I need a nice hit of Mexican flavours, I just thaw  a bag and  put this  flavourful pork in a wrap , in a quesadilla or on a bun.  Delicious!

Great recipe.  Based on other comments I doubled the spices with the exception of the cinnamon.  It was wonderful.  The cinnamon added a wonderful depth to it.  I thickened the sauce after I shredded the pork with some flour,  and put it over the top of the shredded meat and cooked it in the oven for 30 minutes to infuse more of the flavor into the shredded meat.  We made tacos the first night and my husband made a panini type sandwich with cheese the next night.  The flavor is good yet still allows for creativity in how you can use it.  I would highly recommend the recipe and encourage you to try it in many uses.

Delicious! I tripled the seasoning, except for the salt and this just turned out so tasty. I put the pork on a sheet pan and broiled 10 to 15 minutes till  the meat got crispy. Very simple very easy and very delicious. I did leave out the cinnamon as per other reviews. I also crushed two big cloves of garlic.

Amazing - I made this with an 8 lb bone in pork shoulder. I tripled the spice & only used 1/3 of the cinnamon. After cooking on low for 10 hours I pulled the meat off, added some extra cumin & chili powder & mixed w/leftover juices. I then baked a small amount (just enough for 4) in the oven at 400 to get it crispy & ended up broiling it for 10 mins mixing it every few. Served with avocado, salsa, shredded Mexican cheese blend, sour cream & hot sauce. Corn & Flour torts. Enjoy!

Tripled the spice rub, used 3  fresh garlic cloves instead if granulated.  Added two sliced shallots, juiced a blood orange, and used equal parts chicken stock & brandy, not exceeding two cups of liquid altogether.  Added two sliced jalapeños halfway through.
Turned out AMAZING

Well I'm at beginner stage in the kitchen so I look for easy recipes. I needed something not complicated but would yield about 2-3 days of leftovers for me and my 2 year old. 

That said, I changed the servings size to 4, and based on that used a 2 pound loin (it ended up being a sirloin roast as apparently shoulder doesn't come in that small of a size in my local grocery)  and just over 3/4 cup of broth. Other than that, since everyone recommended to double or triple the spices, I left all of the spices at the same concentration (as the original recipe for 10 servings), other than the cinnamon, which I halved from the original (10 serving) recipe. This is only because I dislike cinnamon and would rather have food that tastes like it's missing something instead of being very strong in cinnamon flavor. Even with half of the cinnamon I could still taste it in the meat, but it wasn't overpowering and did indeed give the meat a nice, different flavor. 

I only ended up needing about 8 hours at low (I did do about an hour at high middle of the day, after I turned it) before the meat basically fell apart as I poked at it with the tongs. The flavor is good, I paired with a veggie side and me and my son built soft tacos with lettuce, pico, cheese and salsa. 

Two thumbs up, will make again.

My first time making this and it was great. Doubled the amount of spices. After shredding I put it in a 400 degree oven to crisp a bit (15 minutes). Even my son who “doesn’t like pork” said it was good.

I used garlic salt instead of powder and it still turned out amazing. Fantastic flavors. Used fried corn tortillas, added black beans, brown rice and refried beans. Will be making this many times in the future.

It wasn't bad, but the cinnamon ruined it for us. (It might be fine for you, but my family didn't care for the cinnamon whang.) I would use the recipe again, but I would leave out the cinnamon next time if I use the recipe.

I only used half the cinnamon and it was still overpowering. I used an 8lb pork shoulder so I adjusted all other spices accordingly. It was fun to make, and the technique seems great if you crisp up in the oven after. The seasoning was just off. I had to rinse the meat in the sink, and it was still too much cinnamon. I’ll make again with seasoning from another recipe.

I liked the recipe, but I did a few things differently.  A lot of people talk about leaving out the cinnamon, but it really off sets the cumin so I suggest thinking twice before you leave it out completely.  Just reduce the amount by about half and you'll be pleased.  I only had one can of chicken broth (14.5oz) so I replaced the remaining liquid with a pale ale.  Beer really gives pork a little something extra, imho. I didn't worry too much about washing off the spices and I cooked it on high for 4 hours.  Once everything was cooked I put some oil in a pan heated it and fried the carnitas until it was more of an authentic texture.   Tasted the meat before the fry job and after the fry job was a vast improvement.  I also added the cooking liquid to the meat as it fried to keep it moist.  All in all a successful and yummy treat that my husband and I enjoyed.  My 4 year old only eats chicken nuggets right now so his opinion doesn't count.

I followed the recipe on this one (keeping the cinnamon AND adding cayenne because I’m partial to spice). I didn’t read how many people increased the spices until about 5 hours in and thought “I’ll just let it go and see what happens.” While I understand the increase in amount of spices, I thought this still turned out delicious and tender, falling apart as I transferred it to a Pyrex pan for toasting. It was definitely done for me at 8 hours on low. I’m sure I will make this again and perhaps increase the amount of spices (and keep the cinnamon!).

This recipe is solid. I blended it with the toppings from the Zesty Carnitas Tacos recipe and found it to be a home run. After cooking I put it under the broiler to crisp up and also added lime which made it shine! The spices are spot on. Thanks for the recipe!

So delicious, it was like ambrosia meat! Easy to make, and very versitile.  We used our meat for tacos, but I imagine you could use it for a variety of different uses: Burritos, Pulled Pork Sandwiches  (if you add BBQ sauce), Pork sandwiches, ect. I would recommend trying it and seeing which spices you like with your meat, next time we might scale back on some of them.

This was the first recipe that I did not brown the meat before cooking in the slow cooker.  I had a package of cheap pork stew meat so the prepping time was like 60 seconds... loved it.  I made it a night before and it was tasty but after shredded and soaked in the broth, the meat was even more tender and better on the third day!  Thank you!

Fantastic, but definitely needs more flavor! I will increase spices next time, but the meat came out amazing - served it with rice, salsa, cheese, tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream to make burrito bowls chipotle style!

This  recipes was the best! And I will be making it again soon.  Who doesn't love a meal from the crockpot?! When it involves tacos...I'M IN! Two things I would adjust...1. I'm sure that the cinnamon is needed, but I think next time I will cut the amount in half. It was a bit too much for my liking for a savory dish. 2. I'm going to double the amount of all the other spices and also add some diced onions for added flavor.

I made a lot of carnitos over the decades,just my own recipe,but wanted to try some thing new.I found this recipe and have made several times now exactly as written and it is our fav. new carnitos.II made a couple bags stir fry peppers and onions on the side and when I started heating my corn tortillas I put some of the stir fry peppers an onions on bottom and meat on the top.Oh was to die for.Melt in your mouth,couldn't wait for rest of tortillas to hurry and get done.Wasn't even worried about my cheese or salsa.Offered hubby some who only likes his big flour tortillas and he was in love with it to ,corn tortillas and all.Oh I did spread the meat on a baking sheet with a bit of the juice and popped in the oven a few til the juice dryed a bit.

This is one of my favorite go to recipes. I gave it 5 stars so people will see it, but it does require changes. I have never added cinnamon, that sounded terrible to me and not a common spice in carnitas as far as I can tell. I followed advice to triple the other spices and it's perfect every time. Maybe lower the salt if you don't like too much, and I still add only 2 bay leaves. If you like carnitas crispy, just throw some in the oven for a few minutes before serving. Looking forward to eating it tonight!

This was DELICIOUS!!!!!  I have been using my slow cooker for close to 30 years, and this is BY FAR, our favorite crock pot  dish to date!  I hope that I'm not experiencing "beginner's luck" with the recipe, because I plan to keep this in my regular rotation, and  to serve it for future family gatherings and dinner parties.  

I will admit that I had to change the spice rub because I didn't have coriander on hand (I read that a combo of fennel and caraway seeds worked as a replacement, if you don't have coriander or cilantro, so that's what I used)  And  I have a family member who is adverse to cinnamon, so sadly, I had to leave it out.  Finally, I tripled up on the spice rub because my family usually thinks everything needs more spice, but that's our taste - use your best judgement for what will work for you.  Everything else, I followed exactly.

I served it as tacos, with corn tortillas heated in the microwave, and I made a slaw with shredded cabbage, low fat sour cream, fresh lime juice, chili powder, and salt to serve in the tacos.  That, and some salsa, and we were in business.

Thanks so much for posting this recipe!  I look forward to making it again, just as soon as we run out of leftovers.  :-)

This recipe is delicious as is and I think the cinnamon gives it a lovely flavor. It tastes just like pork made at our local taquerias here in California. Mine was fall apart tender after about 8 hours on low. I served on corn tortillas with cilantro, Pico, and queso fresco and the next night I wrapped the carnitas up in tortillas for enchiladas (look for authentic enchilada recipe). So good!

Probably the best overall pork recipe I’ve ever done in a slow cooker. Great filling for tacos and burritos, but my mother-in-law loved it Italian style with provolone on a long roll. I could use this recipe, as written, for any roast pork occasion. For a more Mexican flair, I will double the spices next time.

I will definitely be making this again!! It was so simple . I followed everything minus the water. Instead I boiled water and added chicken thighs and an onion then stored in 2 table spoons of chicken bouillon. Let that simmer for an hr then poured that half way to the pork. The aroma was so amazing . My mouth watered the entire time it cooked.

Worst Carnitas recipe I’ve ever run across. Wasted a perfectly good pork butt. The meat was so dry, the only way I will be able to eat it is as barbecue pork sandwiches. Need the barbecue sauce just for the moisture.

I'm picky about Mexican food having grown up a few hours drive from the border of Mexico and California. Based on the reviews, I tripled the spice rub. Added just a dash of cinnamon based on the comments. Also added the juice of one orange and one lime based on an ATK recipe that I was cross-referencing with this one. Added the rinds of the orange into the pot too. Removed them with the bay leaves when it was done. Wanted the acid to help tenderize the meat. Very moist when it came out and my picky eater said he'd eat it when he tried a bit. I decided to freeze the leftovers with a bit of the juice to keep it moist in a freezer bag. I'll broil it to get the Maillard benefits when I serve it - making it a quick weeknight meal. Haven't tried it broiled yet, but it was good enough without it. Asked the butcher to remove the bone from the cut of meat and wish I had asked him to also cube it for me too. Put the finished meat in my mixing bowl with the open paddle on low for less than 1 min to shred it.

I made this and it was delicious!  I followed a few of the other suggestions.  I doubled the rub except for the cinnamon.  I also used real pressed garlic instead of garlic powder.  We took it out of the crockpot and shredded it. Then we saved the broth and used it to pan fry the meat in to crisp it up.  The broth added a ton of flavor!

Amazing! Husband loved it and it was almost too easy, even for a slow cooker recipe. The only change I would make in the future is to be sure to use full sodium chicken broth, as it was a little light in the salt once finished. Otherwise, perfect!

YUM CITY!!!!  The only thing I do differently with this recipe is just add more of each spice but I like my food strong and opinionated! This is DELICIOUS! Sooooo good. I make it once a month now and try to feed it to anyone willing to venture over. I wish I had the nerve to try making these the authentic way but I don't. I'm scared. So crock put and oven it is. (I might try frying chunks in lard today afterward just for the crisp factor, the oven dries it out a touch)   Anyways, thanks for posting this amazing recipe, we LOVE it!

Folllowed the spice rub recipe exactly, doubling it for the amount of meat I was using, and it was so delicious and tender! I've used the shredded meat for quesadillas, soft tacos, BBQ sandwiches, and more. Excellent base recipe.

Next time, I will add cilantro during the last hour, just because I love it so much.

I have made this several times, and it always turns out great. Per other users' recommendation, I use a 2 lb roast while keeping the spice measurements the same. Perfect for dinner for two plus leftovers. Highly recommend!

So good!!!  Loved the combination of spices - cut the roast into quarters and rubbed all sides with the spices (which I doubled).  It was really great - reminded me of carnitas from Chipotle.  Thanks for the recipe!!

It turned out really good. (I did not add the cinnamon) Only bad thing about this recipe was that, even with double the seasoning, it was a little bland. But that's alright if you have a good salsa to add to your tacos. Good base recipe

I love this recipe! So easy to make and so yummy. The only ingredient I don't use is the cinnamon- just a personal preference. We love this recipe so much we're using it to make all the meat for the tacos at my daughters wedding. Can't go wrong!

Very simple crop pot recipe made it with pork tenderloin for tacos excellent I'd give it 10 stars if I could the only thing different I did was seasoned the pork & browned it on high heat on all sides before putting it in the crockpot

This is a great recipe really. I did take the advice of other reviewers and increase the amount of seasoning. I also added fresh orange zest  (probably not needed but I like the citrus taste).  
The recipe calls for just 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and I did not add additional cinnamon, but for whatever reason it was very pronounced. So if you don't like cinnamon I would consider omitting. Other than that this is really great, thanks!

It was excellent pork. I took care to remove as much fat as possible as I shredded it, adn teh flavor was quite nice. We did make pulled pork sandwiches with part of it and also used it in tacos carnitas. Cooked much faster than expected, I think 8 hours was plenty of time and I had an almost-five-pound roast.

This smelled good while it was cooking, but the taste buds were disappointed. It was very bland. I won't be fixing this one again. I'm going to add a can of rotel to the leftovers & hope the family will eat it.

After 10 hrs.  In my 6 qt crockpot on low, it was still a little tough. I used a 4 lb pork loin. I left in for 15 hrs total and it was perfect! I never turned it over. Fat side up. I removed fat before shredding with a fork. Delish!

I made this exactly as written so I can honestly rate this recipe.  This was a very easy and basic recipe for carnival and it was wonderful. For being so simple, the flavors were spot on and they continue to deepen as the leftovers sit in the fridge. I served them with fried corn tortillas and fresh homemade Pico de gallo. I did double the spice blend, including the cinnamon and I am very happy with the results. An easy slow cooker recipe that doesn't dissapoint.

My husband threw this together this morning; super simple. We doubled the spices, omitted the cinnamon and after it was cooked, we baked it on a cookie sheet at 400 degrees for 20 minutes to crisp it up. We served it on white corn tortillas and some fresh pico de gallo. Loved it and will definitely make it again.

Instead of pulling it after it was done I sliced it like a pork roast.  I have made a lot of pork roasts in my time, but this is the very best.  Something about the combination of those spices....wow.

This is my go-to carnitas recipe. I;ve doen it dozens of times, and I don't change a thing except that I use a package of mixed pork chops instead of a pork shoulder. It's usually a little cheaper and It seems to me that having more of the meat exposed to the spices and broth makes this even more flavorful.

Delicious!  I had a bigger piece of meat, so I doubled the spices.  I did not double the cinnamon though.  I found even with the reduced percentage of cinnamon, it still added a bit of an odd taste.  I would recommend crisping it up in the oven for 20 minutes prior to serving to get the real carnitas flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

I doubled the seasoning as well  (except cinnamon) and it was amazing! I threw in some sprigs of fresh cilantro for even more flavor. I also recommend quartering the roast to allow the spices to penetrate better. The result was so flavorful and universal to use for sandwiches, burritos, enchiladas, nachos, etc.  We even added our favorite BBQ sauce to some and it was terrific. There is also a lot of flavorful bone broth left over that could be delicious as a soup base. Will definitely make again soon!

I add a beer and cut back a bit on the broth for a slightly different flavor with less salt. I also shred the pork and put in the oven on broil for just a minute or two to add a little crunch at the end. Have made this several times and it's one of my go-to recipes.

I made this tonight and it was a big hit! My son, who doesn't eat anything, actually ate it on a tortilla and then asked for more! If I can get him to eat it, it must be good! I used a 8# pork butt and had so much left over that I was able to make a whole bag of taquitos for later. I just doubled the spice mix. Delicious!

This is my go to recipe for Pulled Pork. I too crisp shredded pork in oven, being very careful not to over do it, which I have done. I ended up with pork jerky.

I followed this recipe exactly and loved the flavors.    So easy and a big hit with my family!  I used 2 pork tenderloins because that is what I had.  They shredded easily after about 7 hours on low.   We ate it with tortillas and fresh pico de gallo from the deli section at the store.  SO EASY!!!

I've used this recipe loads of times and it's always great! Last time, I didn't have that much time so I cooked on high for 5 hours; if anything, it tasted better!

This was excellent. I actually used 4 pork shoulder bone in cutlets and threw all of the spices and the pork into a freezer bag and shook it up for a few minutes. This covered every piece of pork and incorporated all spices nicely. I did double the spices and they were perfect. I also used 4 bay leaves and then added 4 cloves of diced garlic to the broth after putting all items in the crock pot. For those that thought the cinnamon was overpowering, I didn't feel that way at all and I double it. The spices were perfect. These were in the slow cooker for about 8 hours as 6 was not enough. Once out of the slow cooker I then shredded this into a roasting pan and baked, not broiled, for almost 30 minutes. Once out of the oven I mixed it all together to get some crunchy pieces incorporated with the softer parts underneath. Just perfect with homemade guacamole and homemade salsa. Topped with raw red onion and cilantro with some cheese and sour cream on a corn tortilla. 

Perfect. Thanks for sharing.

I have made this before. I leave out the cinnamon and after I cook it, I spread it out on a lined cookie sheet and broil for a few minutes just til it crisps up. I for sure add more of the spices to it after I cook it and just before I put it in the broiler.

I listened to the others & just about doubled all of the spices, except for the cinnamon. It was still a bit too much cinnamon for my preference but everyone else LOVED it! Came out super tender & tasty! Says a lot when a two year old & two grown men love the same recipe ;)

I have not made this yet but am about to.  My question for anyone is the stated calories.  I am on a diet and was looking for lite on the calories dishes.  This says 10 servings at 223 calories but my diet program says 407...which seems to make more sense.  Anyone shed some light on this for me?  I will double the spices and cut the meat up in pcs as was suggested..I am sure it is going to be great.

I should have read the reviews. It definitely needed more spices. Somewhat bland. Next time I would leave the cinnamon out as it was the one prevalent flavor that stood out.  Still a good diner. Family liked it.

This is fantastic. I have made probably about 50 Allrecipes recipes, most delicious, but never once written a review. I feel like this deserves a good review. I tripled the rub, but halved the cinnamon and added chili powder. Also, shredded and put in the oven for 20 mins on a cookie sheet. Perfection. Thank you!!!

This came out pretty good! I did as others suggested and left out the cinnamon... This was too much food to add something that would potentially make this a "NO", as I have pick eaters that turn their noses up easily. I used a pork butt roast as that was what was on sale (7lbs). I don't usually -but I used a crock pot liner. I placed the meat in the liner and put the rub all over and refrigerated it til the next morning, when I threw it in the crock pot on low for 8 hours. Another suggestion I followed was to times the spices by 5, I did this except the salt (x3), placed liner and meat in crock-pot then made 2 cups of broth by using a chicken "base" that I like to use, poured this around the meat. I completely forgot to add the bay leaves (doh!) and I did not have corriander(what's that!?)(next time...) Something I might do differently, another reviewer mentioned cutting the meat into separate pieces and adding rub to smaller chunks so more of the meat is seasoned with the rub. The "inside" of my gigantic piece of meat was noticeably waaaay less flavourful and was cooked differently (der) than the outer meat. Sounds goofy but I know that you know what I mean. I rated this a 4 because I wasn't true to the recipe, but it will go into our rotation of foods.

This recipe was amazing! I only used a 2 lb roast because I only cook for myself and a 3 year old-- I set it on low for 10 hours but found that my roast was ready to shred around 6 hours. I also took everyone's advice and tripled the spice rub, the only thing I didn't triple was the cinnamon but now I wish I had- next time!! Serve this with warm tortillas, onion and cilantro, maybe some avocado and salsa verde. Great recipe, will be going into my regular rotation!

Excellent. My first time cooking this type of pork roast.  I used the amounts of spices specified in the recipe, omitting the cinnamon, altho my roast was smaller.  The flavor was present, tho subtle, making the shredded pork excellent to make ahead and freeze for all types of dishes. Will definitely make this again!

I've made it twice. First time took the advice of some reviewers and left off the cinnamon and doubled the spices. Even after doubling the spices, we felt like it could use a tad more flavor. The 2nd time we tripled the spices (still left out the cinnamon), added 4 cloves of minced garlic, and let it sit overnight in the fridge. Very good and easy recipe. Used it in tacos with mango habanero salsa, on nachos and by itself on top of a salad.

I had family over for dinner and made this and we all thought it was great but followed what other reviewers suggested and doubled the spices but didn't use any cinnamon and also cut the roast into chunks before rubbing the spices onto the roast. I prepared it ahead of time too  so it did sit overnight covered in the spices and when I got up and started it I just poured the broth into the crock pot and turned it to low. I served mine with pico de gallo, lettuce, crumbling cheese, and sour cream also with rice and beans on the side.

I increased the seasonings a bit - carnitas should be a little spicy. Also squeezed the juice of a whole lime and topped the whole roast with 1/2 cup chopped cilantro (I did not have coriander). Turned out great!

My only complaint was that I could not find cojita cheese in my local grocery, but that has nothing to do with this easy and delicious recipe.

This is a really easy and flavorful recipe.  It makes enough that my husband and I can get 3-4 meals out of it.  Depending on my mood, the cinnamon can be a bit much so I will scale that back if I am not in the mood for it.  Other times it is perfect.

This was WAY easy and extremely good! I used chunks of stew pork instead of a shoulder roast, and it ended up cooking quicker than the shoulder roast would have, plus it was easier to shred. The spices were on par, besides the cinnamon. I did not like the flavor the cinnamon contributed- it was strong and almost "sweet", didn't really fit and that is the only complaint I have with the overall flavor. I would use cloves instead of cinnamon. But one thing that was missing: cumin! I added 1/2 - 1tsp of cumin, along with some minced, fresh garlic & some chopped poblano pepper. Those additions really enhanced the flavor, and overall, it came out really good! Perfectly moist & easy to shred- the smell while this was cooking was fantastic, as was the result! I put the carnitas on fresh flour tortillas then topped it w/ the Salsa Fresco recipe from this site and it was delicious! Will definitely make again, as this was really easy to prep then set aside to cook all day. Very easy and tastes, flavorful meal.

Even the Vegetarian in the family can cook this?? Being said vegetarian, I always check the reviews with any recipe I'm checking out. I followed the recipe exactly with a couple of exceptions; I doubled all the spices and omitted the cinnamon. I totally get why some folks would dig the cinnamon, but my Hispanic family didn't use cinnamon in their carnitas when I was growing up. Our family recipe was lost when Gramma and Mom passed away, since both of them cooked by instinct. All this said, my carnivorous family LOVED this recipe, we are using the meat in tamales. I could barely keep them from snacking the bowl down! I did follow another persons recommendation, and I spread the meat out on a cookie sheet, baking it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes to get that crispy edge that everybody likes. I did rub the cookie sheet with olive oil and pressed garlic before I put the meat on it, just a little garlic essence as it baked. Oh and the meat was cooked probably at the 6 hour mark; I set this up then went to bed, so perhaps cook it during the day and check internal temp. Around six hours. 160 degrees. Lastly I did add some chipotle powder(1tsp) and 1 tsp. Gorilla Salt to heat it up a bit. Wonderful recipe, thank you so much for sharing it!

This is a definite repeat recipe for our family and we've used it so many ways. I do chop it into pieces so it fits better in a smaller cooker or pressure cooker. I prefer to add a can of chipotle chiles in the adobo sauce which adds a wonderful smoky chile flavor to the roast.  For coriander I use chopped fresh cilantro and a little lime juice at the top doesn't  hurt. This also can be accelerated in a pressure  cooker like the Instant Pot and is pretty good in just a few hours if you are getting started a bit late.

This meat is delicious!  Followed another review to broil the meat on a cookie sheet once shredded.  Turns out awesome!

As others have suggested, I significantly increase the seasonings, except cinnamon, whenever I make this. After I remove it from the slow-cooker, I place it on a baking sheet. I shred the pork and cover it with a the cooking liquid, before placing it under the broiler for a while. This is probably my husband's favorite meal.

I served them with  tomatoes, salsa, light sour cream on top of spinach. I mixed in black beans and Mexican rice. It was awesome that way and saved calories from a tortilla.

I've used this recipe for a few years now and we truly enjoy it every time.  I do double sometimes triple the seasoning, (minus the cinnamon). After shredding broil it until its a bit crispy.  I highly recommend trying this recipe

This recipe is incredibly delicious. Five out of five stars. I make pulled pork all of the time, and it's always good. But when I tried this, it took pulled pork to a whole new level. The mix of seasonings is absolutely perfect. I served this over black beans and rice, with sour cream and salsa and cheese and avocado on top. It thought THAT was absolutely perfect. Then, tonight, I decided to just simply top it with a little bit of barbecue sauce - The Trader Joe's organic sriracha barbecue sauce. It instantly became the best pork I have ever had. The cinnamon really adds something, so do not skip it!

Finally, I can make great carnitas!! I followed the recipe with the exception of the cinnamon.  When the meat was done I placed it on a baking sheet, squeezed a little orange juice from an orange and baked for about 7 minutes for the crispy pieces. 
Oh my goodness, this is good! Served on warm tortillas with chopped cilantro and onions.  Perfect street tacos!

Great base recipe! I doubled all of the spiced except for the salt and the cinnamon and cut up the roast before adding it to the slow cooker so the spice could be added all over the meat. I also added slivered onions, a dash or worchestershire sauce and the juice of a lemon. Total perfection!

I've eaten a lot of Mexican food.  When I made this, I didn't think of Mexican.  It didn't taste bad, but just not what I expected.  The most pronounced flavor to me was the coriander.

The best thing about using a slow cooker is how amazing it makes the house smell. I could smell this dish before I even got inside, and it did not disappoint. It was tender and juicy and a perfect easy meal. I will definitely be making that again.

I loved the spice combo in this recipe. I actually used a 5 lb shoulder and cooked it on low for only 8 hours. I made tacos with it and wanted the crispier texture so I pulled half of the meat and broiled it for a few minutes. It came out great. I plan on using the leftover meat for BBQ pork sandwiches on Texas toast with a some spicy sweet sauce. If I have even more left over, I might make some sort of Cuban sandwich sliders. I am an inexperienced cook so this was very easy and fast to prepare and clean up was quick and easy as well.

I followed the suggestions and tripled the rub. And I omitted the cinnamon, just due to personal preference. Ate it one night mexican style and the next night mixed in the pork with regular old Beef Ramen noodles, added chopped cilantro & green onions. Big hit both ways!

Made this for tacos and a salad. Meat was quite over cooked and dry at 10 hours.  Flavor was weak for tacos so added taco seasoning. For pulled pork adding BBQ sauce helped.

I experiment with new recipes all the time. When the hubby takes one bite and says "Oh, this is a good one!" I know it deserves 5 stars. I try not to mess with recipes too much the first time I make them, however I changed just a couple small items in this one. I used 2lbs of pork and doubled the spices per most recommendations by other reviewers. I only used a dash of cinnamon and I used minced garlic instead of powder. This made the dry rub kind of moist and like a paste but it still stuck to the meat well. I wanted to throw this in the crock pot before

I used three boneless chops, fresh garlic and only about 1 3/4 cups broth.  It was amazing.  The cinnamon adds a great taste that I get in the authentic places here in Albuquerque.  This is a keeper.   Make with yellow rice and steamed broccoli.  Yum!!!

Made some adjustments for smaller Family! 2 pounds of pork most of the spices the same cut the salt in half. Seriously leave out the salt. The salt was much too strong in this recipe once you included the chicken broth. Besides that, everything came out wonderful it was a wonderful recipe and I plan on making it again!

Very tasty. I made a few changes. I substituted orange juice for the broth, omitted the cinnamon and bay leaf, and added a bit of orange zest too. This worked as both a burrito filling and later I mixed it up with some BBQ sauce to make pulled pork sandwiches.

I made this for the first time and was a little skeptical. I did what other reviewers did and trippers the seasoning except cinnamon. You can totally leave it out but it's not bad if you just use the recommended amount. I added chili powder and chipotle chilli powder. Also put in some cut onions and tomatoes while cooking. The taste is amazing and will be making it again. I made some salsa verde and got some queso seco to put in my yello corn tortillas. Thanks for the reviews they really help.

I made this a day ahead of when I needed it, and followed other reviewers suggestions of omitting the cinnamon and doubling the other spices (although I think I did slightly less of a double of salt). The night I made it, it just tasted okay. The following day, it tasted amazing. Yum!!

Made it with pork loin instead of pork shoulder. Left out the cinnamon and doubled the rest of the spices... Great with homemade pico de gallo

This recipe is great on several levels.  First, it is EASY to make!  Second, it tastes good.  And third, it is so versatile.  It tastes good in a tortilla, with BBQ sauce on a bun, simply on your plate to eat with a fork.  I did double the seasonings, as others suggested.  Yay!  Now I have several meals just waiting in the refrigerator.  It makes life easier.

Yum!  The meat was so good even just by its self, tender and good seasoning. I doubled the salt and cinnamon and tripled the other spices. I cut it in big chunks about 4 inches, then put it in the rub and into the slow cooker for  about 8 hours on low.  Served with tortillas, sour cream, pico, and avocado slices.

This was great. Like some other reviewers I toasted it in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes after I pulled the roast. We had it on nachos which was delicious. Like some mentioned,  the cinnamon just doesn't seem to fit in this flavor profile.  So I think I will skip it next time.

I doubled the spices except for cinnamon. also, I put some fresh minced garlic in rather than the garlic powder. I also cooked it on the 4 hour setting because I got a late start on dinner and it was still super tender and moist. such an easy meal to make!

I made as written except for using boneless pork loin.  I could smell the cinnamon during cooking, but couldn't really detect it in the finished recipe, so I guess I would leave it in.  This smelled wonderful.  I served it with Mexican rice and refried beans without the refry.  It was a great meal.

I had a 9 pound pork shoulder, so I pretty much doubled the recipe.  It took about 12 hours on low setting.  I added in almost a full can of chipotles in adobo and omitted the chicken broth.  When all was said and done, I strained the remaining broth and proceeded to make a fantastic batch of Pozole by adding in some of the delicious pork, some chicken broth and plenty of hominy. I adjusted the seasonings a bit and got two extra family meals out of the deal!

Followed directions and added a few things from other reviews, such as cilantro and then popped it in the oven to get crispy before eating. My husband and kids all loved it! Definitely will be making again!

I usually make my carnitas with orange and lime, but decided to try this because I didn't have the fruit!  I loved this recipe! Only thing my girls said is  to not put so much cinnamon in next time. I'm definitely going to make this again. Thanks.

EXCELLENT carnitas.  I've been looking for a great version to call my own and this is it.  So easy, great flavor, good plain, on tacos, and even our Hot Tot Mess (tater tots, carnitas, cheese sauce, salsa, sour cream, scallions, jalapeños, a little BBQ or chipotle sauce, and you've made a delicious Hot Tot Mess).

We took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spices. After it was cooked we tore it and put it on a sheet with pineapple, onion and red peppers. It was super delish, hard to stop eating kind of delish.

Great flavor to an otherwise tough cut of meat. We then made french dip sandwiches (using the reserved liquid as au jus) and carnitas quesadillas that turned out fabulously. I also recommend cooking it in the oven at 350F for 10 minutes just to brown the meat and give it some crisp.

I made shredded pork using different recipes but this is the best one so far. I took some suggestions from reviews and cut the meat into a few pieces, seared it so the seasoning stay with the meat. I tripled the seasoning but it could be a little more because it's after all soaked in the liquid so the taste somewhat gets diluted and weak. I'll try with 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, garlic powder and cumin next time.

I made this for dinner this week & doubled the spices as suggested. I will not double them next time as it was not needed. I also browned the cooked carnitas in the skillet & made carnitas quesadillas which were MOST excellent. I was trying to copy the carnitas quesadillas from Baja Fresh & totally nailed it. I will now make this recipe in 2 steps: First the crock pot part & freeze until I am ready to crisp them up for tacos, burritos or quesadillas. This will become a new family staple!

These Carnitas are Bomb! I'm not really much of a carnivore, which is an oddity as a Mexican lol The carnitas have great flavor, and they're not greasy and heavy like traditional fried carnitas are. Even my skeptical mom loved them. 

As a footnote, I cut the meat into cubes before rubbing, so I found the recipe's seasoning was enough. I'm keeping this recipe for sure!

Delicious!  I braised it in the oven as recommended by several reviews and topped it with Avocado Bacon Sour Cream Salad.  I did use a cinnamon stick instead of the ground cinnamon.  Never actually had carnitas before but I very much doubt anything else is going to measure up to this.

Amazeballs!!! I listened to other suggestions - omitted cinnamon, doubled the spices, crisped-up in 425 degree oven.  I served on a flour tortilla topped with a mango salsa - and the sweet mango and lime juice flavor with the salty spice from the meat just sent this piggy through the roof!

Everyone raves about it.  I've made it about three times so far, about once every 3 to 4 weeks. It's quite the hit in our household and I've also made it for friends too. I also accompany it with the taco slaw recipe found here on AllRecipes.com. 
My alterations involved lowering the salt amount and upping the garlic by a clove. Also, for quicker cooking (5-6 hrs), I've cut the pork into smaller sizes (about 3" to 4" in circumference).

I have made this recipe many times, but I make it with what I have on hand. I double everything because the given amounts aren’t enough to cover all the meat. I cut the meat in 2 or 3 pieces for more flavor.

WOW! This is fantastic! I used a 9lb bone in pork picnic roast (prob about 7 lbs of meat). I tripled the spices (very liberal in my measurements). I also threw in an onion as it cooked, fresh cilantro and fresh garlic (4 am frozen cubes of each). I made it for a teacher appreciation lunch in a few days but I think I will have to make another one because it won't be around that long! One note: I started cooking it in high for 2 hours. We were leaving town and I realized I seriously underestimated the time I needed to cook it. SO ( I NEVER thought this would work) I took it out after two hours, tightly wrapped it in foil and threw it in the freezer for a few days while we were gone. This morning I put the frozen pork back into the crock pot on low for 10 hours with more chicken broth. I was shocked that it turned out so amazing! I am going to try this with chicken too. Yum!

This is so yummy and so simple to make!  My book club was having a Mexican-themed potluck and I stumbled across this dish while looking for something to make.  I'm really glad I found it!  I got tons of compliments and was asked for the recipe repeatedly.   Like some of the other reviewers, I doubled the seasoning rub and omitted the cinammon.  I also added black pepper to the seasoning mix and put some minced garlic in the bottom of the crock pot.  I cooked  the meat on low for about 8 hours.  This recipe is basically foolproof.

This pork recipe was amazing! I've never cooked with coriander; I was highly impressed. The pork was so tender it fell apart before I could transfer it to a bowl. Will absolutely make again. I also made homemade guacamole and it made the perfect combination dinner!

Meh. This was just okay. I followed along with most of you, and doubled the spices (besides the cinnamon, which I did include at its original ratio). This just didn't taste like much at all, and had no kick to it.

I ended up doubling the rub except for the cinnamon. We bought 6 or 7lb pork butt which we cut into large chunks. I rubbed the meat and avoided rinsing it off with the broth. I used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. My husband loves this! It is something so simple to make and versatile. Great in enchiladas, burritos, tacos and more. Highly recommend this for anyone who loves pork!

I was in a hurry when I made this and realized I didn't have pork so I improvised by using ground turkey.  It turned out VERY well.  My family LOVED it!

love, love, love this recipe.  Followed the advice of others and doubled the spice rub, but left out the cinnamon.  Left out the bay leaf.  Cut the 3.5 pound pork butt into 3 smaller chunks and applied the rub.  Let it rest at room temp for an hour or so. Simmered in the crockpot (on low) overnight in:  1 can of chicken broth, one can chopped tomatoes with green chilis, one an of chilis, a packet of chipotle taco seasoning, and 8 ounces of green chili salsa verde.  The flavor was awesome!

Shredded pork with 2 forks after it cooled a bit.  Meat fell apart easily!  broiled in the oven for 2 minutes on stoneware to crisp a bit.

loved it! my husband said it was the best carnitas I've ever made! didn't have the coriander but that was OK. I also put the pork in the oven at 450° for about 25 min. do it before shredding the pork. so you get that crunchy pork pieces. and I also used a bone in pork roast for better flavor

This recipe is amazing!  I did double the spices (except for the cumin). I only had a beef roast on hand and I turned out wonderful. I will try it with the pork loin next time and this is definitely going into our recipe rotation!!

I made this and it was mouthwatering! I added  fresh garlic however and one small coarsely chopped onion. Also, instead of two cups of chicken broth I used  1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of orange juice.  I omitted the cinnamon completely as my family despises meat with Cinnamon.

Easy way to cook up pork loin in the slow cooker and make multiple different meals. Nothing special, but it was so easy, we'll definitely make again. Added an onion at the beginning, green peppers near the end, and some corn to give it some veggies. This could be done so many ways. Beats the repeated BBQ sauce!

This was a great way to season pork for carnitas.  I did cut the salt down to 3/4 tsp rather than 1.
The house smelled great and everyone loved it.  I will make this again and again.

This was exceptionally tasty!  I cut the roast in 4 pieces and it was so tender and juicy, it also cooked in about 4 hours.  I did leave out the cinnamon, just thought it did not sound good.  We just put the meat on buns and was perfect.

Tasty! Like others, I doubled the spices, except for the cinnamon. I didn't have cumin, so used a tsp. of fajita mix instead. I think a key is to cut the shoulder into smaller chunks in order to get more of the spices into the meat. I had 3.5 pounds and cut it into 6 chunks, rubbed spices over it and let it sit overnight. Although I usually like to use fresh garlic I stayed with the garlic powder, and didn't have any regrets. I didn't add an onion like many others, but made sure I added the bay leaves. The only change was to add the juice of one orange and throw in the two halves. I found the juice really added to the meat juice flavor. My meat was easy to shred after 8 hours. I tested it at 6 hours, but it was too firm. I think the type of crockpot makes a difference. Mine is a round 4 quart one, not the bigger oval ones. Because it is round, the meat was stacked on top of each other, so I did mix the meat up after 5 hours. I did not crisp the meat up in the oven, but used a big fry pan. I also squirted some fresh lemon juice on it and added just a bit more salt. The meat juice was so good I added some of it to the Mexican rice I also prepared.  I will definitely make this dish again in the near future.

Wonderful! I did take some suggestions from the reviewers. I doubled all the spices except the salt and the cinnamon and I added 1/4 tsp allspice. To make this easier to cook before going to work, I mixed up the spices and put them all over the meat and left it in the fridge overnight with the rub all over it. The next morning, I put the meat and broth into the crock pot. I wasn't home to flip the meat, so I flipped it in the juices when I got home and let it cool for a bit. Then, I used another reviewer's advice and I removed the meat, poured the juices into a glass dish and let the fat separate from the broth and removed the fat. I did follow the suggestion to bake the portion of the meat for that night's dinner at 400 degrees for 20 minutes to get that crispy carnitas texture. I used the pork juices to make black beans and rice to go with this and I served the tacos, black beans and rice, and a Colombian or Dominican cabbage salad with this. Amazing! Will make again and again. Rivaled my favorite authentic taqueria in my area!

I made this in the slow-cooker and it was very good. I started by searing both sides of the roast in a frying pan with a little EVOO.  This got the cooking process started quicker and cut the finish time to 5 hours. I think the searing also adds flavor. I placed garlic along with the bay leaves on the bottom of the slow-cooker before adding the roast. The rest of the recipe was followed as written and turned out very good. I did as suggested and put the shredded meat under the broiler for 10 minutes to add the crispness to the meat that is coveted in the finished product.

BLAND. I too doubled the spices (except salt), substituted smoked Spanish paprika for the cinnamon (husband does not like), used real garlic and placed two halved onions in the bottom. Tip: pour the broth in before you add the pork, no need to avoid washing the spices off. I think it's too much broth and I would recommend increasing spices even more and add chili powder. I probably won't make this one again.

My wife and I have made this twice now, and it's really good and very versatile.  Our only change was getting rid of the cinnamon. It doesn't mesh well with the rest of the flavors at all.

I doubled all spices except cinnamon and added fresh minced garlic. Cooked for 10 hours on low. I did crisp it up in the oven as suggested by another review but I think next time I'll skip that since it dried it out a bit and it had been so tender and juicy straight from the slow cooker.

This was pretty good.  I doubled the spices like everyone suggested.  This does have a predominant cumin aroma and flavor so if you don't care for that, tone down the amount of that spice.  Taste for salt at the end.

Made these when we had company over. I tripled the spices except for the cinnamon.  They were a huge hit. I also made Spanish rice to go along with them . Which is another recipe I got of here. Needless to say they were a hit.

I did not use the cinnamon and with the advice of other reviews I doubled the spices. Also I used fresh garlic over garlic powder. Made excellent pulled BBQ sandwiches the next day.

The whole family loved these carnitas tacos, even our pickier one, which is saying a lot! We used what we had on hand, which was not even pork shoulder but pork chops, and no coriander. And still, a five-star meal.

Great recipe. Wouldn't hurt to double up the spices. I cooked it 1 hour on low, two hours on high, flipped it, two more hours on high, then one more hour on low. Might I suggest only eating this on corn tortillas, chopped onion, cilantro, salt, and lime....Nice, clean flavor.

I thought it turned out pretty good for my first attempt. Next time I will triple the seasonings. I also followed the advice of others of throwing it in the oven for about 20 mins at 400 degrees. I will definitely make this again!

I know this is a recipe for pork, but pork and I do not get along!  I substituted the pork with 4 pounds of skinless, chicken thighs (bone in) AND SO GLAD I DID! I took the advice of many and doubled the amount of spices for the rub. It was just enough to coat the chicken. 

I never buy chicken broth, but I always have bullion cubes on hand.  I dissolved 3 chicken bullion cubes in 2 cups of water to use as a substitute for the chicken broth. Because I do not typically add salt to anything I cook, the end result was a hint too salty for my taste, but in no way unpleasant.  The next time I make this I will omit the 1 tsp of salt from the rub, because I believe the bullion cubes will be flavorful enough.

Like others suggested, I baked the chicken after I shredded it.  I poured everything into a 9 x 13 jellyroll pan (because it was deep enough to hold everything), removed the bones and gristle, shredded the meat as described, and put it in a 400* oven, and baked it until the liquid was dissolved. 

I served it on a large flour tortilla over re-fried beans, brown rice, and black beans.  I topped it with sour cream and a mango salsa which I made.  I will never go to Chiplote again!  I will make this instead! To quote my son, "Ma'... That was Bangin'!"

We topped it with homemade pico de gallo and guacamole.  We wanted some heat so decided to add chipotle flavored peppers in Adobe sauce (Embasa brand) to the slow cooker broth. We really liked it and the meat was perfect. Thanks for sharing, a definite repeat recipe!!

I have made carnitas for many years and wanted to try another way, my family was not happy.  I don't like them sweet which is what happened by me adding the cinnamon.  They were tender - this might be good for pulled pork sandwiches.

This is good, but not great, in my opinion.  However, it was sooo easy to make.  I used "carnitas" boneless pork scraps from my grocery store since I knew I'd be shredding it, so it was also very affordable.

I made this yesterday and it was delicious!  I doubled the spice ratio because I had a 5 pound, bone in pork shoulder. I did not double the cinnamon; I just added a couple of dashes ad well as a couples of dashes of nutmeg. The flavor was just a tad different from our local Mexican restaurant's flavor, but my kids and I thought it was delicious! Even my picky 8 year old ate her whole serving!

Very good but next time I will try it without the cinnamon.  I also followed the suggestion of baking it on a cookie sheet for about 20 minutes to crisp the meat. I sprinkled some brown sugar on top before baking. Delish!

Tripple spices, omit cinnamon. Cut meat into very large chunks.  After shredding place a layer on sheet and bake 400 for 8 min to crisp edges. Serve with corn tortillas and top with onion, cilantro and salsa verde.

I rarely rate recipes, but must say this is absolutely one of the best slow cooker recipes I've tried in a while!  I have a family of 6 and they couldn't get enough.  The kiddos were even eating the leftovers as a "snack" - just meat!  Awesome.  Can't wait to make again!

I love crock pot creations for busy school nights with added soccer practices.  This one is definitely going in my lineup! I was a little skeptical of the cinnamon at first but thought I'd go by the recipe this go around.  I was not dissapointed.  I served tacos on corn tortillas with onion, jalapeño, lime and a chile/oil salsa from my cuñada...will definitely make this again.

This dish spread a nice smell throughout the house and the amount of spices were perfectly balanced. When the slow cooking process was ended, I have put the meat in a grill oven for a while to get a little bit of crunchy sides. Served it on tortilla soft shells with cubes of cucumber, onion and lettuce. Absolutely delicious.

One of my family's  favorite recipes and it's starting to become famous in my neighborhood with kids asking to stay for dinner once the smell it cooking.  I normally get a slightly larger pork butt, around 5 1/2 pounds, and I triple all of the spices except Cinnamon, which I keep at 1/4 tsp.  It normally only takes about 8 hours in my crock pot.  We make Chipotle style burritos with cilantro rice, salsa, black beans, guacamole and shredded cheddar.  Absolutely make this about once a month and you simply can't go wrong.  I put leftovers (if any) on top of a plate of tortilla chips with melted cheddar for really good nachos.

I cut the meat in half and made more spice mixture to cover more surface area. No changes other than that. Everyone always loves it!

So these turned out super well. I've been telling everybody about this recipe. 

I kind of went off book as well. I used country style pork loin which was on special 5lbs for 10 bucks, I'm a college student so this was fantastic. Also meant I had more surface area to cover with the seasoning, so I tried to cover the portions even, but I a had to make more then the recipe called for. 

So topped these bad boys with a homemade Pico de gallo and tzatziki sauce to balance out the power of the cinnamon, it worked like a charm.

Excellent recipe. I did follow other reviewers advice and tripled the spice mixture to properly cover the pork. I also added cilantro during cooking. Finally I needed this a bit faster than 10 hours and thus left it on high for the first 2 hours and low for 6.5. Turned out perfectly, excellent flavor and kids loved it! Can't wait to make this easy meal again!

Doubled the spice rub and followed the recipe as written. It was delicious and my whole group loved it! Don't omit the cinnamon just because you associate it with sweet spices.

So everyone loved the taste but hated the way my kitchen smelled while it cooked.  Personally, it did not smell very well so I wondered if I had bought sour meat.  Whatever the case may be, it ended up not too bad and I'll probably make again.

I use beer instead of the chicken broth and also add some chopped canned chipotle peppers.  One tip to make these more authentic carnitas...after you shred the pork, line a baking sheet with foil, place the shredded pork on it and pour some of the cooking broth over the pork.  Place under the broiler for a few minutes until the brother evaporates and the pork crisps up.  DEE LISH!

We really enjoyed this for dinner tonight.   I usually hate to read reviews where things are changed, but here I go....   I had a pork loin roast, so I used that, and it was wonderful.  I did omit the cinnamon because I do not like it with meat.  I used the rest of the dry ingredients as called for - I did not double anything, however, once it was in the slow cooker, I did throw a couple cloves of garlic in with some diced onion and added black pepper.    I placed the meat on a metal pan and shredded it- and stirred it around to further distribute the rub that was left on the outside of the meat.  I added some of the broth to the pan and broiled it for a few minutes to crisp up a few of the edges.   I also used half chicken broth and half vegetable broth, because I wanted to use them up.     I served this with a cilantro lime rice (I like to sauté basmati rice and then cook it, adding a half lime and some fresh cilantro at the end), seasoned black beans, salsa, sour cream, black olives, cheese, and fresh salsa.  Served with a low carb-high fiber tortilla shell it was a very healthy meal.  The girls ate it as a rice bowl without the shell.    I felt like the salt was perfect, but my chicken broth was low sodium.

Excellent. We made the exact spice mix and used a 2.5 lb pork roast. 6 hrs on low in the crock pot then 10 min in the oven with a little broth @ 450 once shredded. Just perfect.

I doubled the spices and it was still fairly bland.  I might try searing the pork first next time.  Served it with corn tortillas, broccoli slaw and salsa.  also had peppers stuffed with quinoa.

Great easy meal to come home to.  I followed precisely on my first go, but did find the flavours subtle so doubled the dry rub the second time.
I also pan fried mine to reheat and get crispy.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I followed it exactly, and it turned out good! I prefer a little more spice so the next time I added much more cumin and garlic powder. Plus, I also added some fresh, diced garlic, because I like to have bad breath. I didn't measure it out, just eyed it so I can't help you there. The meat was so yummy. Very easy recipe, very tasty. Not traditional, but eh, what do you expect when you're using a slow cooker to make carnitas? I know some people have a problem with the cinnamon, but I really liked it! I used white corn shells, cilantro, onion, and el pato sauce to create my taco. Scrumptious. Prepare to be fat.

If there were more than 5 stars to give, this recipe would get them.  I use this one more than any other recipe I have because we LOVE it.  It's very close to the Spanish Pork they serve in Ybor City (the Spanish/Italian section of Tampa). Down here they serve it over yellow rice and top it with chopped vidalia onions and it's great that way, but also good with tortillas.  I've used pork roast, pork loin and even boneless ribs and it's been amazing every time.  GREAT RECIPE!  Thanks!

My family loves this pork recipe! I doubles all the spices except the salt and added 1/1/2 teaspoons of jamaica allspice. I reduced the chicken broth to 1 cup. We served it with avocado, sour cream, flour tortillas, hamburger buns and barbecue sauce.

I took other reviewers advice and doubled the spice mixture, but kept the amount of chicken broth the same. After shredding the meat, I put it back into the juices. We made burritos with it and it was really good! Will definitely make it again.

Perfect. I may have used more spices than the measured recommendations, since I tend to eyeball it, but this was delicious and perfect with the mix of flavors as written!

Excellent recipe!! I use pork sirloin roast instead, it's a little leaner cut and I did slightly pan fry in EVOO. My family loves the slight cinnamon taste too. Definite add to favorites!!

We completely disliked the seasoning in this. Cinnimon and coriander just did not go well at all. It was not inedible but just won't try it again.

Thanks for this wonderful recipe, I did two things a bit differently, I put the rub on the night before so it could permeate better. ( I didn't read the reviews beforehand.) I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth(personal choice). The biggest problem I had was trying not to eat it all while I was pulling it. :) I might consider increasing the spices a bit next time but the overnight trick really helped. I will add a dash of Chipotle Powder to the rub next time for some slight smoky heat. Again awesome recipe.

I made this for my son's 45th birthday. The only changes were doubling the spice rub and I added one orange quartered. Served it with home made salsa and the usual toppings. It was a big hit with all ages and I will definitely make it again and again.

As other reviewers have stated, the amount of seasonings is off. I used a 3 pound pork loin roast with the silver skin removed. I made it as written with the exception of using dried cilantro as I didn't have coriander on hand. I used only 1 cup of stock. It looked right. It was in the slow cooker for 10 hours and I turned it halfway through. After cooking, I removed it and shredded it and added it back to the cooker. I left all the liquid in the cooker and the meat absorbed it all. I tasted it and added another TBSP of oregano and cilantro as well as salt and pepper. I let that cook for another 1/2 and hour. After adding additional spices it was very good. This is a good base recipe to start with but needs tweaking.

I also followed the suggestions of naples34102, though I only had a 2.5 lb roast, so I only used 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth. Doubled the spices, left out the cinnamon, used 4 cloves of whole garlic, cooked on low for 9 hrs, shredded the meat into small chunks and cooked in the oven for 20 min at 400. Absolutely delicious! Very flavorful. Will definitely make it again!

One step that makes these even better.  Take a pan, put a small amount of oil in and heat it until hot.  Add a layer of meat and sear the meat in small amounts.  This will really make a difference, don't miss this step.  Add and heat oil in between batches.  Serve and enjoy.  Melissa E

Awesome stuff and double awesome when pork loin is on sale. I made a few additions: fresh cilantro, lime, garlic and onion seeing this is what I enjoy in my tacos anyways but I have a secret ingredient that blew this recipe to God status...  Threw in a sliced apple on the bottom with the onion and made the recipe explode with flavor. I would have thrown in habaneros but my lady friend is a pansy when it comes to spice so those must remain an after addition.  Could eat these everyday!

Delicious! Made this for my family tonight, they had tacos and I threw it on top of some romane lettuce with salsa, cheese, guacamole, and cilantro. Turned out amazing!  I had 3 pounds of pork so I doubled the spices but only used 2 1/2 cups of broth. I also added about four cloves (yes the spice) and some minced garlic to the bottom of the crock pot. Even my picky 15 year old went back for seconds!

This is my new go-to recipe when friends and family. They now request it my name! The aroma wafting through the house while it is cooking makes everyone hungry. Even our picky eaters love it. I make a batch of the seasonings (enough for big roasts) at a time, so it is always handy. The only change I made to the proportion of the spices is to the salt. I try not to eat too much salt, so I cut the salt by 25% from what is called for in the recipe. I use a low sodium chicken broth in the slower cooker when cooking the meat, and like some of you, I double up on the spices. The meat is so flavorful that we don't miss the salt at all. 

Sometimes, I serve it as a pork taco, and other times, I add some of the spice mix in my favorite BBQ sauce and mix it into the pulled meat and serve it like a BBQ sandwich. Either way, it is wonderful. It's so easy, but so good!

I was amazed how simple and delicious these were!  I took other's suggestions and cut my 4lb pork butt in half to help the flavor permeate, I doubled the spices and before serving I baked in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes to get crisp edges.  I also did a two cup mix of chicken broth and orange juice.  I don't know if that changes the flavor significantly but I read a lot of carnitas recipes and many use oranges or orange juice.  Thank you for this slow cooker recipe - it is a definite winner!!!

Really Good!  I didn't have coriander, oregano or garlic powder so used 2 T chili powder and a couple of teaspoons Italian Seasoning.  I added about 1 T olive oil to make it easier to apply to the roast.  I only used 1 1/2 cups broth, and think next time I might use less.  That's just personal preference.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

The first time I made this, I added orange juice to the chicken broth-about 1/2 cup for that traditional tang to the meat.  It was delicious and made great "street" tacos with a salsa al fresco of cilantro, tomato and onion; fresh grated cheese-both cheddar and jack-all served on warm corn tortillas.  Next time I'm going to try orange slices instead of juice or maybe along with the juice and it's going into tamales. I like the idea of making more spice rub for more flavor.  Lauriticus

I have tried several different recipes, and this one is the best.  My shoulder was twice the size, and I used 3X the spices and broth.  Just a hint of cinnamon flavor gives this an excellent finish!

Made this for a football game and it was gone by halftime!  Cooked as directed but with double the amount of spices.  Saved the juices and left the pork in the crock pot with tongs so people could help themselves during the game.  Served with shredded monterey jack, salsa verde, and sour cream.  A new family favorite!

Delicious! We put the pork roast on just before bedtime. We woke up to that aroma and had to have Carnitas tacos for breakfast. Just added some fresh pico de gallo, my favorite cheese and I'm set...
Can't wait to see what else we can make with this Carnitas.

I pre-browned my meat (pork shoulder chops) and cooked it in the pressure cooker on med/high pressure for 30-40 minutes (until fork tender).  I also added fresh garlic and some cilantro. Yum!

Crisping in the oven is essential! I left mine in for 20 minutes exactly as directed and it tasted like chicharones (pork rinds). And like many other reviews here the spice mixture needs to be increased. I multiplied each spice in the recipe by two and a half and the salt by one and a half and it came out perfectly

These were amazing. I first seared a 4 pound pork roast on the grill and then transferred it to the crock pot with the other ingredients. The flavor was out of this world, thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Delicious, easy and quick. I actually tripled the spice mix and used a 4 1/2 lb. roast, which I cut into four even pieces. I rubbed the spices on each piece and poured one can of chicken broth in the crock pot and let it go for about 11 hours. There was no need to turn the meat half way through. The meat was perfect and fell apart beautifully. It made for great tacos, nachos and then a few days later I put some bbq sauce on it, and rolled it up in a crescent roll with cheddar chess and had bbq calzones. I love it when I can get three meals out of something. Awesome!

I made this last week and substituted beef for pork since we had no pork roast. I also used beef broth instead. After I took out the beef from the slow cooker, I put the juices in a saucepan and cooked it down about 1/3 and then poured it over the shredded beef. We like a stronger taco flavor, so I added a packet of taco seasoning to the juices. Good recipe and will keep this in mind again for another taco night!

I made this recipe tonite and took the advice from others and doubled the spice except for the cinnamon, I added 3 chopped cloves of garlic and fresh cilantro also, the wife first tasted it then told me I should have cooked it different, she didn't like it. I tried it and thought the same thing, I'm now trying to salvage the pork, got it in a big skillet with diced tomatoes, chopped red peppers jalapeños ect. Basically trying to make this turn out like my shredded beef burritos, I lived in San Diego for 20 years and have never had any carnitas taste like this, I wanted to like it but there was no way, I won't be making this ever again

I made this for dinner tonight...absolutely amazing. I made some changes to original recipe...I kept the spice rub the same..I threw some garlic cloves directly into the crock pot and I cooked the pork on low for nearly 12 hours! After I pulled the meat I got it crispy in the oven on 400 for twenty minutes. I served the meat on soft tacos with sour cream,homemade guacamole, salsa, Mexican blend cheese, yellow Goya rice, refrained beans , fresh tomatoes and red onion. I'm stuffed and definitely need to hit the gym after that meal but completely worth it!

The seasoning combination is delicious and, like the reviewer below, the aroma filing your home is reason enough to make it! I used chicken because it's what I had and filled light corn tortillas with shredded white cheeses, tomatillo sauce, chopped tomatoes & fresh cilantro springs... Great and my favorite: EASY!

I've done very similar, but adding a large diced spanish or vidalia onion and red peppers to the slow cooker about two hours before the meat is done. I pour the broth into a frying pan, heating on high to reduce it before pouring back over the meat.

Followed other reviewers' suggestions and, after cooking for the specified time in the crock pot, shredded the pork and then baked it to get it a little crispy. Turned out delicious.

AWESOME - doubled the spice rub, used a 5.5lb boston butt.  Otherwise followed the very simple directions.  Served pulled on soft tacos, with a squirt of lime juice, diced onion and tomato and some sauce. Husband asked me to make it a regular in our menu and so did the kids!!!

This recipe is AWESOME!!  I followed another reviewers advice to put the pork into the oven on a cookie sheet for a few minutes to crisp it up.  It is a family favorite.

I've made this twice now. I use an 8 lb boston butt, triple the spices (except cinnamon, I use the original amount for it) and it is so GOOD! We shred it and freeze and smaller portions. We've used it for tacos, enchiladas, gyros, soups, barbeque sandwiches and most recently, pork and beans.

I only used 2 lbs of meat with this recipe (but the normal amount of spices) because I didn't have anyone to share this with and I wish I had made more.  Super delicious, have double the suggested spices seemed perfect.  Mine came out a little on the dry side, but I think that's because I didn't adjust the cooking time despite the smaller amount of meat, but I kept eating it with loads of hot sauce so I didn't really notice that as being a problem.  Great when combined with pico de gallo.

Knocked a star because I had to make adjustments. Didn't have any bay leaf on hand so I omitted that. Used fresh garlic and added liquid smoke and ancho chili powder. Cooked for 10 hours and did not turn. It was delicious! Definitely making this time and time again!

Added Adobo seasoning to the top of the roast.  Added a few drops of orange extract to the chicken broth.  Added a few sprigs of cilantro around the roast.  After cooking I pulled into large chunks then put on a cookie sheet and broiled until the edges crisped.  Hubs said he liked this recipe better than any of the other carnitas recipes I've tried over the years!

This is a very good and simple way to make carnitas.  However I did make a few changes.  As many other reviewers have said you will need to dbl the spices for a 4 lb roast.  I used a clove of fresh garlic and halved the salt, omit the cinnamon (I used it and the unusual flavor it gives throws this off, will omit next time I make this), I did add a dash of smoked paprika.  Also rub the roast the day before and allow it to sit overnight.  I did turn it over at the halfway point of cooking as the recipe called for and would recommend not skipping this step.  Also the leftovers made great pulled pork sandwiches when thrown into the crockpot with some BBQ sauce the next day.

This was excellent!  My husband and kids loved it. I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and added chili powder and one chopped fresh jalapeño to the rub. It wasn't spicy but gave it a little bite.

Family loved it!  Doubled the rub ingredients exceptI didn't have coriander, so did a bit of cumin. Also only did a small sprinkle of cinnamon.  Followed the suggestions and cut the pork into chunks so the rub would penetrate more meat.  It was delicious!  Be sure and squeeze a bit of lime juice on it before eating!

Good recipe. Tried to cook it on high, still needed to cook the other 5 hours since it was so thick of a roast I got. Good flavor, very mellow even though the spices are stronger ones. We didn't eat this like carnitas however, I used the meat in some leftover Thai Shrimp Soup I had made earlier and my husband ate it just as pork with rice and beans. I made nachos with it the next day. Very good recipe. I would probably kick up the garlic just slightly and maybe add some cilantro.

I doubled the spices as well, but I think next time I would not add as much salt. The pork turned out so moist and had a delicious flavor, but it was way too salty. It has potential, so I'll try again!

Had high hopes for this recipe but ended up a bit disappointed.  I used the online video instructions, following them exactly but ended up with a rather bland end result.  It was OK but I've definitely had better.

This was delicious.  I doubled the spices.  I crisped in oven for 20 min at 400, and added crushed pineapple (about 1/4 cup) and some juice to pork juices.  The pineapple caramelized and added a lovely sweetness.   My 10 year old and 5 year old declared that they were the best tacos ever!

This was AMAZING! I only did a 2# roast and followed the recipe for 4#, but used half the broth. I added a couple shakes of curry and skipped the coriander because I didn't have any. The pork was so tender and delicious... I'll definitely be making this again!

I have several things to say about this incredible recipe. I think as written it might be disappointing. First - the secret to good Boston Butt in the crock pot is to cook it on HIGH. Not low. Seriously, cook on high and you will be much happier. Still give it 8 hours or so. I tend to not put any liquid in my crock pot when doing Boston Butt. Be sure to cook it until it shreds/falls apart.
The easy way to get the amount of seasoning right is to make a rub. Double or triple (I doubled, except cinammon) mix all spices together in a bowl. Then rub liberally all over the roast. When it's covered, you have the perfect amount of seasoning (since we all probably use whatever size roast we bought in the store ;-). You can save any leftover rub for later. 
Lastly, I recently made this in the oven, b/c I'm without a crockpot. It was ridiculously delicious. If you have the time and the inclination to roast it for hours and hours (like 6) I highly recommend it. Just use the spice rub and put the roast, fat side up, in a baking pan. Roast at 300 until done. Roast to about 190 degrees for pullability or 170 if you just can't wait any longer. I didn't bother with broth or bayleaf.

Absolutely amazing. I took some of the suggestions here and made a few modifications and couldn't imagine it coming out better.  I doubled the spices except for the cinnamon. I cut the 4 pound roast into 4 big chunks and rubbed the spices all over.  I cooked it for 9 hours and turned the pieces over halfway through. Yum!

Love it, love it, love it.. not just for the taste but also because it's so easy to make.
My husband couldn't stop saying "Oh, that pork smells so good" while it was cooking in slow cooker. 
Since I don't like cinnamon, I omitted that but I followed the recipe exactly. Well, I guess I did use real garlic rather than garlic powder and I tripled the seasoning after reading the reviews. I used sirloin roast though because I like lean meat. I think I would probably let it cool a while before I shred it at the end because it did dry out a bit. But still, it was wonderful. My husband thought it was THE BEST and so much better than Qdoba or Chipotle. I made the lime rice from AR and quac, salsa...they all went well together. We used it as soft taco filling and also on a nacho platter. 4-5 pounds pork makes plenty. My hubby and I had two big taco meals and two big nacho platter and we still have some leftover. We will definitely make this thing again and I just can't wait for the sirloin lump to go on a sale again.

Made this using chicken breast in place of pork, and the results were very good!! I did make a few other modifications as well though... I like things spicy, so I added a small can of diced green chillies, and also some pepper flakes. Served on small flour tortillas with broccoli-slaw.

DELICIOUS. The chicken was so moist & flavourful. Absolutely yummy. I could easily just sit down and eat this out of the crock pot with a fork.

I didn't have bay leaves so I skipped them. We made carnitas tacos one night and the next morning I mixed some left over meat with eggs and made a scramble, then tonight missed with bbq sauce and made pulled pork style sandwiches for an easy meal! This was super versatile and made for several days of easy meals!

I've made this recipe many times and everybody I've ever made it for compliments me on how good it is! 

I don't use nearly as much chicken broth as the recipe suggests.  I use, maybe 1/2 cup.  The pork will usually render out a good amount of liquid while cooking.  Once the pork is done, I drain the juices, put them in a pan on the stove and reduce them to about half their original volume to enhance the flavor.  I sometimes even add some more of the spices to the broth.  I then add that flavor back to the pork. Served with some fresh corn tortillas, pico, cheese and cilantro...Perfection!   The leftovers (if there are any) are great for breakfast tacos.

We have made this several times now and it just gets better.  I double the spices except the cinnamon and start it the night before in the slow cooker, about 8:00pm.  Then, before work in the morning, I shred it up in the cooking liquid and let it cook all day in the liquid.  Right before serving, I put it in a shallow metal baking pan and "broil" it for 10 or so minutes.  This gets that crispy taste on the edges that my husband loves.  A squeeze of fresh lime after it comes out of the broiler adds a nice touch.  Also, once cooked, the leftovers freeze beautifully in Ziploc bags for more quick easy suppers on busy nights.  Could not be a better recipe for busy families!  Thanks!!

I know I'm out numbered here, but I could barely eat this "carnitas". This was way too "herby" tasting, I used a smidge of cinnamon because of all the anti-cinnamon comments, I do think that didn't help but it wasn't the demise of this recipe, it was just ewww!! I wasted alot of effort on this, was very disappointing

The only reason I did not rate this 5 stars was because it needed a little more oomph but it was great. To make it even better, I doubled the spice w/ exception of cinnamon. Used chicken boullion granules instead of broth and doubled that without the water (4 tsp granules & only 2 cups water). After cooking, we reserved some of the broth and warmed the meat in a cast iron skillet with some of the fatty broth. OH MY! By making these changes, we made it 10 stars! Corn and wheat tortillas are the best too. YUM!! This is one of the best recipes I've gotten from this site to date. It has become a regular in my house. Thank you!

My husband loved this so much!  He only stopped eating it when his stomach told him to, then ate the rest for breakfast the next morning.  Definitely pair it with ex girlfriends pico de gallo on this site and youve got a delicious meal. Thanks for this recipe!  Oh....and he said this reminded him of the street carnitas in Mexico which are so good you dont need anything else but a tortilla to put it in.

I had never heard of carnita up until finding this recipe!  I will say I was skeptical of what I thought was a mexican type dish cinnamon in it.  BOY, was I wrong!  I made used a 6 lb pork shoulder roast and my guys were begging for more!  I cannot wait to make this again, along with the homemade pico de gallo.  INCREDIBLE!

This turned out good, not great, but I think next time it will be better with a few small changes. I will leave out any cinnamon and triple the rub. I only doubled the rub, minus the cinnamon, but it needs to be tripled. The cinnamon gives it an almost curry like flavor. I also, threw in a sliced onion and fresh cilantro. I think baking at 400 for 20 minutes is a key step otherwise the pork wouldn't have been the right consistency.

We made this  using a 9 pound bone in picnic shoulder roast. There was enough meat pulled off to have dinner and lunch in various forms for a whole week! This would be perfect for a large casual buffet with make-your-own tacos or burritos in a backyard setting. The house had the wonderful smell of carnita mix for 2 weeks!

I used broth and beer, since I have a kegerator and I figured what the heck! I also added a sliced up orange (peel and all)to the cooking broth. After shredding I recommend spreading pork over a foiled cookie sheet and drizzling reduced cooking liquids over the pork and then broiling in the oven for a few minutes to crisp it up. Serve with plenty of homemade guac, diced red onions with cilantro and lime, and Mexican table cream for drizzling!! Delicious!!

This was very easy to put together. I doubled the spices for 3-4 pounds roast. But I still felt like it was a little on the bland side. The left overs reheated very well and were still juicy. Thank you for a great recipe.

The best carnitas I have ever made!  I did modify the recipe.  I multiply the seasonings by at least 4 and added 2 teaspoons of ground cayenne red pepper.  We like things with a kick!  Cooked in 10 hours perfectly.   Very juicy and tender.

The minute I started to braise the meat, the kids were telling me how good it smelled and asking when we could eat.  Like others, I doubled the spice mixture and it was wonderful!  In the interest of time, since I forgot to set it up in the morning, I cut the meat into 1"-2" cubes, put on the spice mixture and braised it, after which I put it in a pressure cooker, along with stock and bay leaves, for 30 min.  Definitely a keeper!!!  Especially thankful for my pressure cooker, too.

Our family FAVORITE! I will use this in place of shredded chicken in any Mexican dish. It's the tasty flavor you would expect at a Mexican restraint(and hopefully get!) This is what makes you decided to stay home and cook for yourself because you know you won't be disappointed. I love finding these perfect recipes! I didn't add the cinnamon though. Any leftovers I made quesadillas.

It is a great recipe, but as the other reviewers indicated, the spice mix needs doubling. I skipped the coriander because I didn't have it. Fantastic! Pork butt is the best cut for this recipe.

This recipe was good, but not as tasty as I would have hoped. I trimmed all the fat from my roast (there's always still a lot left) and used double the spice on a 3 pound roast and it was a bit bland. I'll ad lib next time and triple the spices and add tomatillos instead of chicken bouillon, with a good deal more garlic, of course.

First time I made this, I followed it to a T and it was too salty. Maybe my chicken cubes has too much salt. So the second time I only used salt to taste in the end and it was amazing! I followed someone's tip to broil it for a few minutes to crisp. One of the best tacos I've had!! Used soft taco shells with fresh avocado, diced tomatoes, sour cream and fresh cilantro. SOO GOOD. 

Tonight I felt like chili and couldn't find a recipe I liked. So I whipped this carnitas recipe up in the pressure cooker. Using the same pot I sauteed onions, garlic, red bell pepper, hungarian pepper and added more of the spice mix + cayenne, paprika, a little sugar and black pepper. Once softened, I added a can of mixed beans, a few more cups of chicken stock and crushed tomatoes. BAM. This recipe is so amazing and surprisingly versatile. I want to try making pulled pork with it next time.

Awesome recipe!  I was looking for a pork recipe like they serve in a local restaurant.  If you shred the pork and sauté it in oil or better yet lard, it gets crispy around the edges.  This makes it awesome to eat plain topped with cheese or as a taco filling with toppings.  Would make great enchiladas or tamales also.

I totally enjoyed this recipe! I too took the advice of others and doubled the spices but eliminated the cinnamon completely. I did make this in a pressure cooker with a center cut loin roast(to make it healthier)and I loved it. I will absolutely make this again!

I used a bone-in roast because that is what I had on hand, and it worked perfectly. I used the ingredients as listed (except for coriander that I didn't have). Cooked on high for two hours and low for another 6 hours; turning it over mid way through. Excellent flavor and perfectly done. I do believe that doubling the spices except for the cinnamon would be a good idea. We have lots of left over for two or three more meals as there are just two of us! Will definitely make again.

I made this for a Mexican style Christmas feast and it was phenomenal, and incredibly easy. I followed the first reviewer's suggestion (double spices and omit cinnamon, cut into smaller chunks). I did the spice rub the night before, and set it on the bay leaves in the slow cooker, set the lid on it and put it in the fridge overnight. In the morning I just added the broth and plugged in the slow cooker. I used my kitchen aid mixer to shred the pork, but it was falling apart just lifting it out of the broth. My only complaint is how much fatty broth I had left over with shreds of pork. I used a slotted spoon to skim out as much pork as I could. Clean up was a bit messy, but it was totally worth it. This was wonderful in soft and hard tacos no matter what combination of toppings we used. Everyone raved about it.

Tried this and it turned out pretty good after following the suggestion to bake it a bit to get the crispy effect. Nice and easy recipe...i appreciate that. I'll probably make it again but it will be a while. Not part of my regular rotation.

This recipe was very good.  I followed the suggestions to cut the meat in smaller pieces and to double up on spices.  I covered my meat well with the spices, minus the cinnamon as suggested.  I used 1/2 cup of orange juice and 1 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  Friends who do deep fried carnitas use sliced oranges, so I thought, I might as well try the OJ.  It was a success at my potluck at work and people asked for the recipe. This is a keeper.  Thank you Erin.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  We've tried it twice and it has come out great both times.  The seasoning is spot on and the texture is great.  The only downside is shredding it and trying to extract the fat chunks from the yummy meat.

We've tried it plain and also have used the leftovers for enchiladas (which was the best!)

I just tried this recipe and it turned out FANTASTIC!! I followed the video instructions by adding spices not only on the meat as recipe states, but also add spices to the pot. The meat was flavorful and very tender.

I loved this recipe, and have made it 3 times now.  Every time I serve it at a party, the guests rave.  I followed the recipe as written, but followed the suggestion of another reviewer and put the shredded pork onto a baking sheet, poured drippings over it, and cooked for 30 min at 400F to make crispy edges on the shredded pieces.  It was fantastic, and has become a staple in our house.

This is really good and easy.  I made it as directed first and found the cinnamon to be too much and it was a bit soggy.  So now when I make it I leave out the cinnamon and I shred it up and broil it for about 10 minutes before serving.  This it a perfect filling for fajita style tacos.  Love it thanks Erin :)

I made this today and was quite disapppointed. I saw that many of the reviewers loved it, so I was confident that it would be great. I followed the recipe as described, and wound up with a very tender pork roast that was pretty bland, and lots of broth. Is this necessary? I can see why reviewers added heat.  I'm going to keep looking for a recipe.

Let's face it...nothing compares to pork cooked in lard.  However, this is a really good recipe and tastes great!  I agree with the other reviews-drop the cinnamon altogether and then double up on the rest of the spices.  I even made a gravy from the leftover juices and it was fabulous!  Delicious in burritos and one of the easiest recipes I've tried.  Will make again for sure!

This is delicious.  Doubled the spice mixture for a 4# roast as recommended by another rater.  Used meat for burritos,  with barbecue sauce and alone on a sandwich.  Kids ask for it on a regular basis.

My husband and son (the carnitas lovers in the house) gobbled this one up.  I only used a 2.5 lb roast and cut the stock in half accordingly.  Kept the spices the same.  I might add chili powder next time to give it a little extra kick.

The combination of spices for the rub is truly unique. I've never tasted anything quite like it. We served this on corn/whole wheat tortillas with jack cheese, salsa verde, fresh cilantro, sour cream and lettuce. Delicious carnitas soft tacos.

We make this recipe at least once a month and it is a family favorite. The only thing I change is I do double the spices expect I keep the cinnamon the same. It tastes really authentic. So yummy!

This is awesome!  I did not use the cinnamon and doubled the other spices like other reviewers said.  I also added 2 teaspoons of Pampered Chef chili lime rub.  I was hesitant to try this recipe becasue of the chicken broth, but now I think that's the secret to the recipe.  When finished,the pork dipped into the broth is sooooo good - YUM! I just made it for the pork, on a low carb diet so I can't do the rest of the burrito, but this is the recipe I will use when I can have one!  Thanks for sharing!

Made this for dinner last night. Is was so good. I did have to make 2 changes only because of what i had on hand, first i used veg. broth instead of chicken, and i did not have any coriander so i just put in a little extra cumin,
I sliced the meat thick and served with corn tortillas, avacados, fresh tomatoes, crema and mexican style cheese. Kids loved it too. I will make again, excited to try it with coriander.

One of the nicest recipes for huge, Flintstone-sized hunks of meat. Takes a lot of spices very well. Made the recipe exactly as written and liked it. Added some more cumin and spices to the jus after cooking, and liked it even more. Nice over rice, great in a tortilla and fried. All around great recipe, and good for a variety of meats.

SO easy, and so good. I used a "Fuzzy's" style garlic sauce to go on top of the pork and topped with cheese, lettuce and feta cheese. YUM.

So tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly as it's printed except I used a bone-in 4 1/2 lb pork shoulder roast. The results--perfectly juicy and flavorful carnitas.  The meat shredded effortlessly with two forks and tasted wonderful in steamed corn tortillas.

I love this recipe! I've made it twice now and it's gone over so great both times. The first time I made it I followed the suggestions and baked the meat covered for a bit to crisp it up. I almost thought that it dried out the meat a bit. The second time I didn't bake it at all and I thought it was wonderful.  I think the next time I make it I'll probably try baking it for less than the suggested times listed here. 

Overall it's a really wonderful carnitas recipe. I always triple the rub so I don't run out.

Unfortunately, I didnt think this was as good as the other reveiwers said, but maybe I did something wrong? I doubled the spices but did not add the cinnamon, and also did a mix of beef and chicken broth. I did not have a boneless roast but I dont know if that mattered. It was good, I just expected better. Maybe next time I'll try the cinnamon? It just seemed to lack that zip of flavor I was looking for. However, for not having to do much work to make it, it was something that I didn't mind eating for dinner and leftovers!

Flavors didn't penetrate through the meat. Maybe marinate overnight.

although i do not have a crock pot and had to cook this in a pressure cooker, it came out great although i would have liked to have tasted more of the yummy rub on the meat itself. because of the pressure cooker, had to add more broth (probably the reason why the rub flavor was not so strong on the meat) but the broth tasted so good i am going to use that to make tortilla soup tonight.  thanks for a nice easy recipe!

I had to make this as I was on the way out the door to work. Literally takes no time at all. Just throw it in the crock pot, and let it cook! I didn't flip the roast after 5 hours since I was at work. Oh my God, this is SO GOOD! The flavor is amazing I can't even describe it. Definitely triple the seasonings, but don't triple the cinnamon. I disagree with others on here who said to leave the cinnamon out... the cinnamon was one of the best parts!

I used a pork tenderloin because that's what I had on hand, yet I found the meat to be tough & dry.  It didn't shred easily.  I didn't care for this recipe, but my husband said it was the best pork I'd ever made.  Go figure!  I'm going to give it another shot w/ a different cut of pork & see how it goes.

This is one of my family's all time favorite recipes. We make it about once a month as a treat, since we use pastured pork shoulder roast and it can be quite pricey. I do think using pastured, local pork makes it much tastier (and more nutritious) as we have tried it both ways. As the roast is cooking in the slow cooker, the house is enveloped in the most decadent, delicious smell you can imagine. I am certain this will remain a family favorite for a long time to come!

Very good and easy recipe. I followed other reviewers' advice and tripled the spices. It turned out to be a little too salty for me, so next time I will limit the amount of salt to just one teaspoon, per recipe.

I followed other reviewers advice and doubled up on the spices and next time I will cut the meat up into smaller pieces so that the spices can infuse on more surfaces. That said, I thought this was a wonderful recipe and I would not cut down on or cut out the cinnamon - it was a nice pleasant surprise whenever I got a hint of it. I made the best burritos and then some of the best enchiladas I have ever made using this recipe.

This recipe is easy, and tastes amazing.   I doubled all of the spice measurements for a little more flavor.  You can throw it in in the morning, and it will taste like you slaved all day when you get home.

This was good. I made it for superbowl sunday when i decided not to do my standard pulled pork.
Served with soft tortillas, queso fresco and fresh salsa.
The only thing i recommend is multipying the spice mixture and having some  stock set aside to add as neccesary.  I had a 6lb shoulder and used 3X the seasoning for desired flavor.
Oh and if you like spice add some chopped serranos or dried chilis to the mix while it cooks.

Absolutely delicious... Omitted the cinnamon and doubled up on the spices, but even that was not enough.  Next time I might triple up on the spices.  Served it with flour tortillas, pico de gallo and sliced avocado. Took some to work for lunch and my co-workers were drooling over them.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This recipe for carnitas is fantastic with the following changes as others have suggested. Double the spices except the cinnamon and cut the roast into several large chunks before rubbing with the seasoning mix. If you don't want your meat very salty you may not want to double the salt if you are not using low salt chicken broth. I used a 5 pound roast but I don't think that made much difference in how it turned out. The seasoning was perfectly fantastic and the meat was very tender!!

This recipe turned out fantastic :)  I opted to use 2 cloves of minced garlic instead of the powder.  The only thing besides that that I would change is cutting the cinnamon down to about a dash or a pinch...1/4 of a teaspoon is enough to make it a distraction.  The cinnamon adds an interest layer to the flavoring, so it's worth keeping in, in my opinion...just make sure you use it sparingly, or else you're going to find yourself thinking about it in every bite.

I followed others advice and tripled the seasonings, all except the cinnamon. But I know I like things with lots of flavor. Turned out great!

I agree that this is more like Spanish Pulled Pork than Carnitas, but it is very yummy.  I loved the spice combination,and will use it again!  The only things that I changed, was that I used a bone-in sirloin roast and I pan-seared all sides of it in hot oil after applying the seasoning.  I was always taught that you should do this to A) provide a nice color to the meat, and b) help keep things juicy.  It smelled fantastic and tasted great.  We made pork burritos one night, and tacos and sandwiches the next.

Delicious!!! Although i think you can definately do without the cinnamon. I didn't use the full amount it called for and i still didn't care for it. Some might enjoy it but it's not for everyone.

Great! I used less cinnamon and will probably use even less or none at all the next time I make this. Will make it again.

This is very good.  I would cook it again.  I have deviated when I do not have the correct spices on hand.  However,I always use the little amount of cinnamon in the rub (which I did not think I would like) it is very good.  Do the rub and right amount of time.  It is tasty and fork tender.

This is not only easy, but the best tasting carnitas you will ever experience.  The house smells great all day! The best thing about this recipe is that you can slightly speed up the cooking time by varying the heat between low and medium so that your carnitas can be ready at the 6 hour mark.  See how that works...

Awesome, but with these changes:  leave out the coriander, cinnamon, and chicken broth; add 4 Tbsp of lime juice and 1 onion quartered; quadruple all of the other spices.  Cooked all day.  It was a hit with the family!

Soooo goood!!!  I could not get boneless pork so I did a whole 7 pound shoulder. cooked for about 12 hours (till I could shred the meat easy) I did bake the shredded pieces in the oven for about 15-20 min. We ate this on warmed corn tortillas with some good salsa on top. My Husband and I had leftovers for a few days, but he nor I were complaining. lol!

This was really good, and my kids and hubby loved it! I did tweak a little, tripled the spices as recommend by others, and added a bit of cayenne and chili powder. I placed a sliced up onion on the bottom of the crock, placed the broth in along with 4 crushed garlic cloves, the juice of 1 orange and half of the oranges peel. It cooked up so tender, that like others suggested, heated some oil in a pan until hot, and "fried" up the meat to give it a little tooth. Will definitely make again.

These carnitas were OUTSTANDING.  Like most comments recommended, I tripled the spices, except for the cinnamon.  I also added 1 roughly chopped onion, 4 cloves chopped garlic and a handful of chopped cilantro to the slow cooker.  After it was finished cooking and amazingly tender, I took all of the meat out of the cooker, put it on a baking sheet and put it under the broiler for about 10 minutes or so to give it some crisp and color.  Then back in the pot and ready to serve.  Absolutely incredible and plenty of left-overs!

I kept the seasonings as per the recipe, only I toasted the meat in the oven with some of the juices afterward. It was amazing. Perfectly seasoned. I think it would be too much to double or triple the seasons. Served on corn tortillas with a little fresh lime and avocado--it was FABULOUS!

LOVE LOVE LOVVEEE THIS! I have made carnitas before but this is by far the most flavorful recipe I have tried. My husband is half mexican (so i have to compete with his aunts and grandma's recipes) and even he LOVED it. I had extra meat so I doubled the spices and read another review that said to add some cilantro. The spices were perfect but I don't think the cilantro had much of an effect so I will just stick to the original recipe next time.  This will be my staple carnitas recipes.

I was looking for a dutch-oven carnitas recipe, and this substituted great.  I tripled the spice rub, browned the roast in lard, poured in the chicken stock and put in the oven at 350.  So, so good...

I loved the way these carnitas turned out.  I did make a few changes per others suggestions and doubled the spices except for the cinnamon and added a sliced onion and 4 cloves of chopped garlic to the bottom.  Just crisped some of the shredded meat in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 mins....Yummo...!!  Many thanks Erin.  I've already had this for breakfast and dinner and I will make nachos out of it tomorrow for lunch..!!

I made this for dinner last night and here's what I did:  I doubled the seasoning & chicken broth (except for the salt.  My chicken broth, though low sodium, often makes things a lot saltier).  I  cooked the meat on low for 8 hours until the meat was textremely tender, but not falling apart.  I removed meat and set aside.  I then poured the juices into a pan and simmered them for about 30 min at a low boil until the sauce had condensed and thickened.  I then chopped the pork (as my husband thought this would be more like true carnitas).  I added the pork to the sauce, stirred and served with warm tortillas cilantro, white onion and lime wedges.  Very good, very easy, just watch the salt!

Terrific recipe! I added onions to the mix for the flavor and because we have have a family of onion eaters :) Unfortunately, the day I made these I ended up getting very sick so I couldn't eat them but I did try a small piece and the rest of my family loved it! Served with tortillas and guac and the onions of course ;) Very good. Thank you!

I took the reviewers' advice and tripled the rub. I also added a couple tablespoons of prepared salsa. I turned the slow cooker on at bedtime (on low). In the morning, I flipped it over and shredded it a bit. I left it on keep warm all day. It was awesome by dinnertime. I served it on top of black beans and rice. Topped that with homemade salsa. Fantastic!!

I absolutely LOVE this recipes, as does my whole family. The only thing that would make it better would be if I DIDN'T have to turn it over at 5 hours. Then I could make it on work days instead of just work-from-home days.

This turned out to be one of the best pork recipes I've ever made.  I did modify it a lot.  Like many reviewers I doubled the spices and left out the cinnamon.  Instead of garlic powder I added 6 crushed garlic cloves to my onions toward the end.  Added achiote chili powder and ground black pepper to rub.   Browned the pork, then sauteed a sliced onion.  Finally added a small can of diced tomatoes and sliced orange to the liquid.  I also browned it off in a convection oven at 375 for 20 minutes before serving.  Can't wait to try this one again.  Will play with the seasoning.  More salt, garlic, and maybe some crushed red pepper flakes.

This was really good. I was worried about the meat drying out given the 10 hr cooking time. But there was no need to worry it was juicy and flavorful. I did double the seasonings which I am glad I did or it may have been to bland. It made a lot but people were fighting for the leftovers so it went quickly. I served it with small flour tortillas, guac, sourcream and various other condiments and let everyone build their own.  It was a fun dinner and everyone loved it.  Plus it was easy for me, was not stuck in kitchen all night.

I like that the flavor of this is different than a typical pulled pork for bbq.  It has more of a "Mexican" flare.  I'm regretting that I didn't pour more of the cooking liquid over the meat when I stored it, I should have saved more than I did because it adds such a nice flavor to the pork.  We served this with whole wheat tortillas, a guac sauce, refried beans and a copy cat recipe for the Chipotle Basmati Lime and Cilantro rice.  Really excellent meal!  Thanks!

It was dry tasting, even though it had sauce.  I would try another recipe. But we ate it just with bbq sauce.

Very good recipe. Meat was exceptionally tender and flavorful - I took some other reviewers' advice and doubled the spice mixture while using the same 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. Even so, the cinnamon was a little overpowering. I cut my roast in half and didn't worry about turning it and the meat still just fell apart. Baking the meat after slow-cooking is a fantastic touch, gives it an awesome texture. Next time might use half the amount of cinnamon or leave it out completely and just sprinkle a little bit on top of the roast after putting it in the slow cooker.

These were REALLY REALLY GOOD. The only reason they weren't 5 stars is because they didnt knock my socks off like other carnitas have (but I live in LA, so we have the best of the best) Took other posters advice and doubled the spices, cut the roast into quarters, poked it with a fork and cooked it for about 3 hours on high, and the rest (about 3 hours) on low. They took the meat and put it on a cookie sheet at 400 degree for 20 min to crisp it up a bit. YUMMERS. WILL make this again

This recipe was simple and declicious. The only thing I did differently was add a few orange and lemon slices to the bottom of the crockpot as suggested by another reviewer but besides that, I made it exactly as written. The meat was so tender! My family loved it. I will definitely make this again.

Great!  I'd never made carnitas before.  The reviews gave me some great ideas as far as additions to the recipe and I'm sure they spiced it up.  I too used more seasoning... especially garlic.  I tried the avocado, sour cream and bacon... wow did it pounch it up!  My husband and son LOVED it!

My husband loved it, but thought it lacked some heat.  I didn't care too much for it though.  I will say, it was very easy to put together and had a lot of flavor.

Currently cooking away in my crockpot for tonight's dinner. I've made this a few times and I always double the spice mixture since I usually have a larger roast. The leftovers are great with barbecue sauce and served on rolls.

A  favorite of my husband!  I doubled the spice rub except for the cinnamon.  Heating the left overs in the oven took this over the top.  Next time I will leave out the chicken broth, it was too soupy as the recipe was presented

The meat itself was slightly bland but I think if I had used less than the listed amount of cooking liquid it would have been better. We had a ton of cooking broth left over after it was done. Next time I'll cut the chicken broth amount some and hopefully the flavors of the spices will be more prominent.

Great carnitas! I work long hrs. during the wk. I am out the door at 7 AM & usually not home until 7 PM (I work downtown Chicago / live in the burbs). Slow cooker meals are a lifesaver for me. When I stumble upon a sc recipe that sounds good, I'm always game to try it. This did not let me down (and I like this MUCH better than Bob in CA's recipe for simple carnitas)!!! I know I'm not "supposed" to rate a recipe I changed, but I couldn't resist (lol!) making a few changes based on top reviewer Naples34102's suggestions. I too increased the amount of spices called for (my pork shoulder roast weighed in at 3 lb., so I used 1.5 x's the amount of spice rub). I also spread my (shredded) meat onto a large cookie sheet, poured a bit of the cooking juices over all and heated in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes (next time, I'd shorten the time - my meat was a little dry). The onlly thing I did differently than Naples was to use garlic powder as directed and NOT omit the cinnamon. As Linda Mclean noted, the cinnamon adds a subtle background flavor that is to die for (not to mention it semlls divine!)!!! DON'T OMIT THE CINNAMON!!! I still prefer pork chile rojo (Diyeana), but these are a very close second! :) Served with soft corn tortillas, chopped tomatoes, green onion, some cilantro, fresh lime and guacamole (compliments of Chipotle!), these were Sooooo yummy! Beer margaritas (Big Surprise), Mexican rice and tortilla chips were perfect complements. Thanks for sharing, PopRocks! :-)

This is fantastic, and couldn't be easier.   I didn't shred the meat, I just cut into little pieces before I put it into the pot.   Also, I didn't use the cinnamon only because I don't like it.  After reading another recipe on this site, I also added some sliced onion to the bottom of the crockpot and a quartered orange.  We just ate it plain--it was that good.

This is a great recipe! I took the suggestion of others and doubled the spice mixture, I also put the rub on and then refrigerated the pork overnight. What a great main course for our Mother's Day Fiesta!

AMAZING! I made these yesterday for a Cinco de Mayo party and they turned out absolutely perfect and delicious. I did double the seasoning mixture as recommended by previous reviews. They were turned out very authentic, just as i had hoped! I will definitely make these again and again.

So very delicious!!!  My husband, daughter, grandson and myself ate this stuff all day long (sneaking bites from the crock pot once the roast was done) and served it once again at dinner time.  I did triple the spice mix (except for cinnamon) and a 9+ lb shoulder and it was perfect.  Husband says I can make this ANYTIME.

sub-par. the spices did not permeate the meat, and I even doubled them and cut the less than 4 lb roast in half, before liberally applying the rub. Cooked 10 hrs on low. It was very tender. Next time I would use diced tomatoes with green chiles, or just green chiles, or enchilada sauce in place of the chicken broth. It wasn't really spicy at all.

I loved this recipe- with a few review changes.  I kept the chicken stock the same, but I doubled all the spices I had (sorry, but I removed the cinnamon all together).  I didn't have the coriander, but it was great how it was...just enough salt. I combined it with a homemade hamburger bun recipe, with the option of BBQ sauce.  Yum!

It was very good! I took the entire crockpot over to a friends house who owns a catering business and they loved it too! There was no left overs. However, I didn't add the bay leaves or the corriander simply because I didn"t have it, but it still turned out delish.

I really liked this but didn't have 10 hours of cooking time.  I got great results using a pressure cooker - 15 to 20 minutes.  I then shredded the pork, put it on a baking sheet and crisped it under the broiler less than 10 minutes as another reviewer suggested.  Amazing.

I will most definitely be making this again. I had never used cinnamon in a savory dish before, but it really adds something good. I served this on homemade corn tortillas, garnished with fresh chopped cilantro. Simple, delicious, and very cost-effective.

Very moist and tender. I doubled the rub and baked the meat with some of the cooking liquid per previous reviewers. Interesting flavor, a nice change of pace. It was not as good as the traditional carnitas - but deep frying the pork in lard is not something I would attempt at home anyway! Thanks for sharing!

THIS WAS AWESOME!  DOUBLED THE SPICES, EXCEPT FOR CINNAMON.  SHRED THE MEAT AND SPREAD ON A COOKIE SHEET TO BROWN AND CRISP UP IN THE OVEN AS OTHERS SUGGESTED.

I made this last night for my finicky husband and my foodie sister... they LOVED it!  I used a slightly smaller roast and doubled the spices (except the salt) as some of the other users suggested and it came out PERFECT.  This one is definitely going onto our regular menu rotation.

5 stars!  Doubled up on the spices, didn't use the cinnamon.  I used pork the first time, then a rump roast the 2nd time, great for both!  Put the meat in the toaster oven before serving to give it a little crunch.  Thanks so much!

this was really tasty...used a smaller roast than called for so I should have cut down on the liquid, as mine was a little watery. But still great!! put it in the tortillas with cheese, sour cream, tomato & salsa. Yummy!!!

I made this to go with cheese enchiladas for homemade enchiladas rancheras and it was FABULOUS.  The pork was great, tender and tasty and amazing.  I will make it again soon.

I doubled the spices and it was perfect.  Next time though, I won't double the salt and I will leave out the cinnamon altogether.

Quite good, definitely at least double up on the seasonings.  Good for burritos or with barbeque sauce in pulled pork sandwiches.

Well, this is my new favorite meat. I love the flavor. The meat just fell apart and was very moist and juicy. I served with the raw or uncooked torillas you buy in the store, those are the best kind I think. Thank you for this recipe!

This meat was very tender and good - but it didn't taste at all like carnitas!  It just  tasted like cooked meat.  I agree with another reviewer who said the seasonings just didn't permeate the meat.  It smelled amazing though.  :)
