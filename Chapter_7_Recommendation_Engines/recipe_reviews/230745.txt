Very easy to make and oh so tasty! The chicken turns out so moist and tender.  We will be making this one again.

This was pretty good. I will make it again. I omitted the potatoes, therefore I had to reduced the homemade BBQ sauce.

This was great. I cheated and used bottle BBQ sauce. Not a fast dinner, but very easy. We loved it.

I really enjoyed this recipe! Very easy to put together/prepare as you only really need to cut the onions & potatoes, and whisk the sauce ingredients together. The one thing I forgot was the lemon juice but the sauce was still delicious. It ended up being less viscous than anticipated, but it helped to combat the tiny bit of dryness that the chicken had. Both my boyfriend and my friend could not get enough of this, so I will definitely be making again!

Wow! Haven't had a total fail like this in years! Followed recipe exactly except added celery seed to BBQ sauce to add a little more flavor. Cut potatoes into small bite sized pieces and stirred every 15 min. Covered with foil for 1 hour. Potatoes were still not soft after 3 hours.  Chicken was dry and sauce was lacking flavor. I really wanted this to work! Darn!

Easy and very tasty!! I've made several times as the recipe states and also with bottled BBQ sauce when in a hurry. Sometimes added a few extra veggies too, corn and baby carrots, for a all in one meal. Also, I increase the oven temperature to cook in less time and always cover with foil. Makes chicken moist and juicy especially when you baste with sauce 1/2 way through cooking.

I have 2 pics but your system isn't flexible enough for uploads. But it was awesome. Chicken was tender & moist. Not too much sauce, just enough and it was filling. Only thing I did different was added baby carrots, and I used butter instead of margarine. Great recipe.

The chicken is definitely moist. My husband loved this recipe as-is, but I would prefer less brown sugar in the sauce. Will be making this again!

Turned out great!  I used bottled BarBQ sauce, which saved time and effort.

This was really good. However, I don't believe it is an entire nourishing meal. I made brussels sprouts alongside it and a salad.

I made it exactly as the recipe says. Im sorry, but this just tasted like ketchup, mustard and vinegar mixed up together.  I even added a tiny bit of  smoke flavoring, hoping that would take some of the tart and sour taste out. I won't be making it again.

So yummy! I was surprised at how moist the chicken was, and the potatoes were great. The sauce was really flavorful. This may not be a very healthy meal, but it sure is awesome!

I decided to try this, but didn't have time to make the sauce myself.  It was great,  even with bottled BBQ sauce. Next time I will definitely the DIY version!

I enjoyed this tangy vinegary barbecue quite a bit. My husband did not like the sauce much as it isn't a smoky, KC, Memphis, midwest style sauce. He didn't like the potatoes with the sauce at all. I did enjoy this quite a bit though and liked the tangy sauce. This was an easy dish to toss together and I simply took our my mandoline slicer and did the onions and potatoes on the third setting. I didn't have brown sugar so I used plain white. I enjoyed, hubs didn't. Oh well. I'd make this again had he liked it. It was easy and just set it in the oven and forget it until dinnertime.

This sauce is excellent!! Since it is summer, I wanted to do some outdoor grilling. I made the barbecue sauce and marinated the chicken in it. Then I poured the excess sauce over the chicken while it was grilling. My family could not get enough!

Tried this recipe and my family loved It!!!  I didn't add as much brown sugar and  did add a little more crushed red pepper, my husband liked the the added heat better.  And both my husband, and son cleaned their plates which is something I have trouble with when I am serving like roasted potatoes or fried potatoes.

Loved this recipe. It was very easy to make no more than 10 minutes cutting the potatoes and mixing the bbq sauce on the stove then pour over the chicken and bake. It came out really moist the potatoes were perfect and the chicken was falling apart. Family loved it.
