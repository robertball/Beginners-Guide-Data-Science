I used the brine part of this recipe only.  It is the most fantastic brine and I will use it every St. Patrick's day!  After brining my trimmed brisket for 5 days  - rinsed it and put it in a large pot with 1/4 cup pickling spice and 4+ quarts of water.  Boiled/simmered for 2 hours, then added my carrots and potatoes.  40 minutes later - added 2 quartered heads of green cabbage and 1/4 c. chopped fresh parsley and 6 quartered large russet potatoes.  Was the best I've ever made - thanks so much - this brine is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Made this again today with the changes we learned the first time! Super moist and flavourful after cooking in the oven instead of the BBQ. Was easier to keep the temp consistent. Was smoked in our smoker to perfection then moved to the oven after. SO delicious and simple!

I followed the directions completely except I kept it in the brine for 6 days and finished it in the oven after smoking. Absolutely fantastic. My family loved it. I served it for dinner that day and everyone enjoyed Reuben sandwiches over the next week. I am defrosting 1 brisket and 2 large sirloin roasts right now to make more for next week.
