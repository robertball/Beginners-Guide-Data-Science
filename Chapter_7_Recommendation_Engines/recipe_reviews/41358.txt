After reading all the reviews that this turned out gloopy, I dropped the flour/milk paste completely and just added 1/4 of half-and-half instead to give the sauce its creaminess instead.  With that small amount, it doesn't add much calories and it doesn't overwhelm the sauce either.  Will make this again.

The Basil Shrimp fettucchine tastes great, but is pretty heavy.  Also, I only used half the basil required, and that was plenty!

I really enjoyed this recipe - it's very similar to Lean Cuisine's Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta - which I love! I also thought the sauce was a bit thick and had to add a little more milk, other than that it was great!

This was a very bland tasting recipe.  I reccomend adding extra cayanne, garlic, black pepper and using angel hair pasta.  Also extra milk to keep the sauce thin (one 12oz and one can of 8oz milk) worked good for me.

Good recipe and easy to make.  I made the mistake of shelling/deveining the shrimp myself, buy them that way.  Add a little tabasco for additional flavor (or you could kick up the cayenne) - the recipe is not quite spicy enough for my taste.

This is one of our favorite recipes!  My children (age 3 and 1 1/2) love it!  It is easy and great with garlic bread.  I highly recommend it!

Not a bad recipe.  I added black pepper in addition to the white and cayenne for a little extra kick.  Came out good, although I still think it could use more spice.  The flavors are mild and mesh well.  Thx.

This was pretty good.  I hate shrimp, so I pulled out a portion of the sauce and let my husband have all the shrimp.  He really enjoyed it also!  The sauce was a bit thick.  Next time, I'll reduce the flour, I believe.

I made this for 20 women, did not use the flour or onions ( cooking from memory) and it got rave reviews. I think the sauce covered well and was light without the flour. Nice balance with the peppers,and basil

When I read the reviews that said it turned out gloppy, I thought, Those people must have done something wrong!  How could that happen?  Then I made the recipe, and the same thing happened to me.    I added at least 1/2 a cup of skim milk, and it didn't help.  It was still gloppy, and then there was way too much sauce.  Maybe 2 tablespoons of flour would work later.

I didn't have the fat-free evaporated milk on hand, so I modified the recipe and left the milk and flour out and used a little butter and a little extra olive oil when sauteeing the veggies and it made a wonderful, light sauce for the pasta. I also substituted 1/2 Tbsp dried basil for fresh which worked well, although I'm sure fresh would have made it look prettier. Very flavorful recipe. I made even try again with chicken instead of shrimp as a variation.

We were looking for a new way to cook shrimp in a dish, without losing the flavor of the shrimp itself. I had never used white pepper in anything, and really enjoyed it. The sauce was delicious, and the shrimp held their flavor very well.

I added a little extra pepper because I really like the 'kick' and it came out VERY spicy (which was perfect).  Overall, an easy and very fresh recipe.  Serve with milk incase some of the consumers can't handle the heat!

I would use less basil next time. But it was really tasty. I also used Pepper flavoured pasta to add some extra taste since I didn't have white pepper.

This was a very tasty recipe; the first time I've ever cooked shrimp!  However, it only gets three stars because it's consistency is a little gloppy.  I'm wondering if using stock or regular milk (instead of evaporated milk) might have led to a better consistency.

Yuck - flavorless.  We even tried to spice it up a bit, but the flour seemed to have taken all the great taste away from the shrimp.  What a waste of good ingredients.

What a wonderful dish.  We went a little light on the basil the second time around...it's easy to over-power the delicate flavours.

This recipe was great and really easy too. I didn't have the white pepper or the cayenne pepper so I substituted black pepper and paprika for the two. The flavor of the sauce surprised me, I thought that it would be bland because it was just milk and flour but the seasonings and the flavor from the vegetables and oil made it taste wonderful. I will definitely make this again!
