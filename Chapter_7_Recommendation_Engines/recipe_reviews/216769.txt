All yummy ingredients.  We sometimes use Feta as part of the cheese as Gorgonzola can be a bit too strong for our liking.  If you want to add protein, try adding some drained and rinsed garbonzo beans or black beans or slice a boiled egg.  Still easy, and still yummy!

This is a delicious and simple salad. The only change I made was to use feta cheese.  Everyone loved it - no leftovers!

This was pretty good. I do prefer more "stuff" in my salad though, so next time I will add mushrooms, cucumber, etc.
