Wonderful recipe, and although hardly a health food, a yummy way to get beta carotine and antioxidants into your family. I've made twice now, once exactly as written, and once with some additions. They are extremely sweet as written, and I've found that reducing both the white and brown sugars to 3/4 cup each produces a still appropriately sweet (but not cloyingly so) bar. The second time I made these, I added 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp ginger, plus 1 cup of raisins. That made them over-the-moon delicious, and they were inhaled in record time. Don't get me wrong - without the spices and raisins, their flavor is simple and uncomplicated, but some may interpret this as bland. Both times I shredded the peeled sweet potatoes using the shredding disc on my Cuisinart, and it was plenty fine enough. The shreds of sweet potato melded into the brownie and were not discernible. Moist and appealing with a sunny orange-gold color, they are also excellent keepers, if you can manage to hide a couple for later on. They may be frozen and thaw beautifully, with no discernible difference between frozen and fresh, provided you wrap carefully airtight and don't freeze for too long (say around 3 months, max.) Thank you for a real gem!

THIS IS AMAZING! God, so good.

The yams don't need to be cooked. Just peel them and grate them on the smallest holes on your cheese grater! It takes less than 2 minutes and it's healthy and natural.

I 1/2ed the recipe and baked this in a muffin tin for 12 individual cakes. I completely omitted the white sugar as I decided they were probably sweet enough! I was right, and the glaze is just delicious. I'd hate to have to leave that out.

I used non-hydrogenated margerine instead of butter and I used all purpose wheat free flour. I also used just 1 egg and 1 egg white instead of two eggs. I added 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon. 

All in all, they came out SUPER moist (they key is getting a fresh and firm yam because they are full of water). They are so tasty, especially with the cinnamon. The grated yam melts away into the texture of the cake much like grated carrot in carrot cake. I implore people to make these and NOT use canned yams!  :D

WOW!!  Just... wow.  These were super awesome.  I had my doubts when I was measuring insane amounts of sugar, and saw the weird brown and orange batter, but these are something special.  I wasn't sure if the recipe writer meant yams or sweet potatoes, which are not the same, but I used sweet potatoes, knowing that what most of us from the US call "yams" are really sweet potatoes.  That was fine.  I didn't cook the potatoes before hand, I just peeled and shredded them like the recipe says.  I'm not really sure why everyone is cooking them, you really don't need to.  And I certainly don't know why you would used canned, which have so many preservatives and tons of sugar and salt.  They cook plenty in the oven with the batter, there is no need to use pre-cooked.  I think next time I will double the frosting though.  I really liked the way the frosting complimented the brownies.  I think more would be excellent.  However, I let the brownies cool before putting on the frosting in order to preserve the sort of crusty top that brownies get.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was an incredibly easy and yummy recipe. Instead of going through the hassle of cooking, peeling, and shredding yams, I just used 1 medium sized, drained can of "Bruce's Yams" which I smashed. I think these actually add more flavor and made the recipe very moist. This probably saved me 30 minutes of work!

This was amazing!  Being me .. I used 2 eggs verses 4 and canned yams drained verses 'fresh'.  This made the brownies hold together in a super moist way.  I was afraid 4 eggs would be too brownie like.  Excellent decision!  The only thing I will do differently the next time I make this is to double the batch.  My MIL said, "This was better then any chocolate brownie I have ever tasted."  I have to agree!

This smelled wonderful while cooking. I was looking for a way to get some Vitamin A and beta carotene as well as potassium in my 4 kiddos, and yams/sweet potatoes seemed like they could do the trick. I started with 3 smallish fresh "yams". Scrubbed them clean, poked them on each side with a fork a few times, & placed them on a couple of paper towels in the microwave. I then nuked them for 3 1/2 minutes, turned them over, then nuked them all for another 3 1/2 minutes. Let them cool a bit before removing the skin (came off easily) and throwing them in my food processor to get them all nice and creamy. (It was so thick I needed to use 2 of the 4 eggs in the processor to help make it liquidy enough to process.) Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Perhaps by using fresh yams and using 2 eggs to puree or whip them smooth is what made me need 10 additional minutes on my cooking time. I have to say- all of us, from age 4 to my hubby, LOVE these and they are delicious! I did not do the last step and add even more sugar and butter and milk on the top when it was warm. They were absolutely sweet enough and moist enough w/o adding even more sugar and saturated fat, so I do not regret leaving it off. This recipe is a keeper for us but we renamed it. Brownies are drier and crumbly. These are moist and awesome!! Plus I can not help but think of chocolate from the word "brownie". So thank you thank you for giving us the recipe for the "Golden Yam Cake".  :-)

Excellent recipe, I read most reviews before baking as they are always helpful.  I made the following changes and they turned out great, instead of 1 cup butter I used 3/4 c and a 1/4 c more yams which I mashed.  I used 1/2 c Splenda and 1/2c white sugar, 1 1/4 c white flour and 1/4 wheat bran.  I also added a 1/4tsp of cinnamon and a little extra vanilla ;), they would be great with raisins and maybe a little more bran to soak up some of the moisture.  I also had to bake them an additional 10 minutes on top of the 30 minutes and I didn't bother icing them they were great without the extra calories.  Next time I would add a little more bran and start my cooking time at 40 minutes.  I baked my own yams and mashed them, they came out perfect from the microwave as others had suggested. Oh I also only put 3 large eggs in instead of 4.  Not sure how they would be if I had left the recipe as it was written but everyone that tried them thought they were fabulous the way I made them.  Thank you Starflower for a great recipe!

I read alot of the reviews before making this and I made alot of changes.  Usually I try to make the recipe as it calls for so I can give it an accurate rating but it needed some changes.  I used 1 stick of butter, 1/2c brown sugar 1/2c white sugar( I think anything more would have been too much) I cut it down to 2 eggs but used egg replacer, I added a little over 1 tsp ground cinnamon (which I am glad I did because it gave it a great flavor) and 3c shredded sweet potato.  I did not glaze them.  They came out really yummy and had a hard time stopping myself from eating the whole pan at once.  My 2 year old loved it too, she has had one everyday for 3 days now.  I will definitely make these again.

I found this recipe while searching for anything w/ yams in order to get more potassium in my diet.  I followed advice and microwaved 3 yams, peeled them and put them in a food processor w/ 2 of the 4 eggs.  I did have to cook approx 5 min longer and I did make the frosting.  WOW!  This was incredible.  I had 5 kids eat 2 portions each and ask for more.  The adults loved it also.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe. Easily prepared and amazingly rich and satisfying. I highly recommend it, even for those who don't care for yams. An A+!

Amazing! My 2 year old could not get enough! Even my mother loved these! I give a 4 star only because the original recipe has too much sugar and butter I modified this a little to make it better for my son, and based on previous reviews:  •¼ cup each butter and applesauce •½ cup packed brown sugar •	½ cup white sugar •	1 tsp cinnamon  •	1 tsp ground nutmeg •¼ tsp ground ginger •¼ tsp ground cloves •	2 cups peeled and finely shredded sweet potatoes •1 cup raisins

I took Baricat's advise and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup each.  I also added the cinnamon and ginger as suggested and 1 cup of golden raisins.  I also added cinnamon and vanilla to the glaze.  This cake was absolutely delicious!

AMAZING! Although nothing like the classic chewy brownie, this is an incredibly rich, moist and fluffy cake. My roomates finished it off in 20 minutes!   The yams are incredibly sweet and oily as they are so the second time i made it i cut the sugar and butter in HALF and it was even more incredible! The third time i made it i cut the butter and sugar by 3/4 and it was less rich but STILL delicious and much more healthy. The yams do not need to be pre-cooked.  MAKE THIS you will not regret it!

This is a great recipe. My whole family loved it. I don't understand why on earth anyone would use a food processor though. It is just not necessary. It is so simple to just peel the yam with a potato peeler and then shred it with a cheese grater. It takes just a couple of minutes and doesn't sacrifice the hearty texture of the brownie. Just my opinion though! I also halved the recipe and used a 9x9 brownie pan. (They are so good if I make the whole batch I would just eat them all and probably gain 10 lbs in the process!) I still added the same amount of yams to the recipe though. I notice that with more yams I get more moisture. I also skipped the icing and just sprinkled powdered sugar on them. They were a big hit with the whole family. Thanks for the recipe!!!

These are so good they're dangerous!  I use only 3/4 cups of each of the sugars and it's still very sweet.  Also, I only use three eggs and I boil, peel and mash my sweet potatoes beforehand.  I've made these three times in the past month!

I've never even seen a yam for sale in the U.S., so I was forced to substitute with sweet potato. The result was just ok.

I thought this sounded weird at first but I love yams... give it a try what the heck. It was the best choice I made! My hubby, I and our guests all loved them. It was amazing they were moist chewy, and reminded me a lot of carrot cake consistency, without the cream cheese icing. A couple weeks after I made them they were requested again! I am getting the ingredients again at the store. Also i thought about adding walnuts for those without allergies.

Next time I will half the mix but still make it in a 9X13 and adjust the baking.  It was good, but the best parts were the edges that actually cooked most of the way.  The center was still gooey and batter like.  I'm glad it didn't scare off the hubby that eats everything!! =)

I am not sure what happen but this recipe calls for way too much butter!  I am going to cook this recipe again but using 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup) instead of 2 sticks (1 cup).  My brownies were soaked in butter; making it a soggy mess!

Great recipe!  I added walnuts to my portion and used half whole wheat flour.  Next time I think I will cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup.  We all loved it.

I was doing a search for recipes with "golden" in the title (working on a dinner menu for viewing the Golden Globes) when I came across this one. So I decided to make these for our dessert. I read ALL of the reviews before I began, and I made a few of the suggested adaptations.   I added a little cinnamon (1 tsp) for more flavor, cut the brown and white sugars to 3/4 cup each (so 1 1/2 cups total), and I added a cup of chopped pecans just because I love nuts. I was going to make a cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze in the original recipe, but as others have noted, even with cutting back the sugars, they were sweet enough without any topping.   The resulting bars tasted quite good and more so the next day. However, the texture was very moist and dense, and not as light as I thought they would be from the photo.

These are extremely good! I made a few changes to the recipe. I halved both the white sugar and the brown sugar, using 1/2c of each. I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. I used 1/2c egg substitute (its healthier and I was out of whole eggs at the time). Based on other reviews, I also decided to cut down on the butter. Instead of 1c I first tried 1/2c, but found that the sugars and butter didn't want to cream well so I added a bit more butter (1-1 1/2 Tbsp) and it worked well. I used a 29oz can of sweet potatoes instead of fresh, mainly because I had them on hand. I made sure to drain them well, then I mashed them. Next time I will try fresh sweet potaotes to compare. I didn't put the glaze on top, but next time I may. Over all these were very good and not overly sweet. The only down side is that I ate most of them myself!

Almost Any variation on this will still turn out yummy. I was running low on some of the ingredients. I used 1/2 the amount of sugar- it was plenty sweet. 2 eggs instead of 4. 1/2 the amount of butter for the batter. I didn't have any butter left for the icing. Instead, I used coconut oil. I think next time I make this I will still use coconut oil instead of butter for the icing. I also think it could use more yams- but it's still great as is. I added ginger and cinnamon, like others had suggested, and it added to the overall flavor.

THESE ROCK! I love the yam flavor, and everyone gobbled it up before they were even cooled. I used baked mashed yam and there were some small chunks left in it which were a hidden treat.

I was skeptical about this but tried it anyway.  These are mouth watering!  I did substitute regular sugar with Splendid and substituted baked yams for the shredded.  It still came out with great results.  Everyone loved them!

Turned out really good, although next time will definitely reduce the butter & sugar. Even without the glaze, it was very good. I just put some sprinkles on top for color.

Very very moist and flavorful.  I used 3 eggs and 1 egg white and only 1/2 cup of the white sugar, and am glad I did.  It is already sweet enough, and more sugar would have made it worse, not better.  The glaze is important - don't skip it!

LOVED IT!!! Did do some changes, 3 cups of fresh shredded yams, 1/3 cup wheat bran, 1 1/3 cups flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon,  1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup sour cream, and for both sugars 3/4 of a cup. The rest of ingredients stayed the same. And did not do the frosting.

Mmm... I could get myself in trouble with these. I'm not sure about the excitement of having veggies in this; I'd have to eat the entire pan to get close to a serving of veggies! I've had this recipe hanging around for awhile. I haven't made it because I usually just love to eat sweet potatoes for dinner...but I bought one and didn't have a specific recipe in mind. Anyow: yum! I would agree with several others that they are a tad greasy. I'd reduce the butter by about 1/3. I would probably cut out 1/4 of each of the sugars, but still use the glaze. The glaze is yummy! My bf suggested a brown sugar glaze next time. If only these were truly health food... :)

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. That said, it was more like a cake. I might use this as a cake recipe since my Southern boyfriend said about 10 times that it was amazing. Next time I might use a citrus cream cheese frosting for the cake.

I think this recipe is awesome as long as you add cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. That way it brings out the yummy yam flavor. Otherwise it is a little plain. But great idea! I would definately recommend it!!!

Really not very good at all.  I cut back on the sugar like others suggested and it wasn't very sweet. Used the topping and still not really sweet.  I won't make again.

Fabulous!!! I didn't have a grater handy so I decided to make it easier on myself and bake a large sweet potato in the microwave for about 7 minutes, until it was very soft. I let it cool and then peeled and mashed it. I added a bit of water to it to moisten it a bit and it came up to almost 2 cups. I Also followed some reviewers suggestions and cut down on the sugar to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2. Followed the rest exactly. It was so good, my son could not speak! He was stuffing his mouth with big bites and banging his hand on the table!!! He said it is one of the best desserts he has ever had! My parents loved them too. Even my brother who HATES vergetables including sweet potatoes in desserts said they were really good! They did not feel they were lacking any sweetness either. Came out moist, soft and a bit chewy in a tender way. great texture and great flavour! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I halved the amount of glaze and used only about 2/3 of the sugar called for in the brownie batter, and the final product was still so sweet that I couldn't even finish a small piece.  The texture was also very strange.

Delicious.  I used 1/2 cup butter, about 2/3 c. white sugar (could have gone with 1/2 c.) the full cup of brown sugar, 2 cups of flour, and a little over 2 cups of raw sweet potato finely chopped in food processor (looked like it had been grated).  I baked in a ceramic 9 x 13 pan, for just about 1 hour.  Didn't have time to make the glaze as we were running out the door, but we all loved them even without glaze.

This recipe is awsome as is, but my wife always uses mashed sweet potatoes (boiled tender first) and bakes an extra 15-20 minutes. Talk about a moist brownie.

Even though I didnt care for these, my husband loved them, and thats what counts. I used hard white wheat flour and sucanat sugar instead. And make a cream cheese frosting for them the second time I made them, which he thought was tastier than the glaze the recipe calls for.

Moist & delicious!   My Mom had a few fresh sweet potatoes on hand during Thanksgiving ‘09, and I did not want to go with the usual ‘baked potato’ method of preparing them so I tried these brownies, and they were AwEsOmE! Say it with me: Awe-some.   I didn’t change a thing except that I was out of Vanilla, so I had to improvise. I added some pancake syrup on a whim (the fact that it was sitting on the counter in front of me didn’t hurt either! LoL!), and they turned out to be a hit with everyone! Even with the teenager who was looking at me as if I were crazy while I shredded a sweet potato.   *You know it is good when the teenagers actually know what is going into it, and “love ‘em!” anyway~ Ahhh! Good times….Let me just add: “SCORE!”   This recipe is a treasure in my very humble opinion, I have restocked on Vanilla and I am back again! I thank you for sharing this recipe Starflower!   *I am totally ignorant to the difference between yams and sweet potatoes too! These were labeled as ‘sweet potatoes’ in the produce section of our local grocery store (TX – that may explain a lot! =o) ).  Thanks again Starflower!

I would give this recipe a higher rating if I could - it was that good.  I was determined to find a yam recipe that my husband would like, and this was it!  He couldn't stop eating them.  This is a definite keeper!  I peeled and shredded the uncooked yams and we really liked the consistency and texture it provided.  I made them for the first time at Thanksgiving and everyone asked me for the recipe.  I  also made them for just about every Holiday Party we went to and they were a hit everywhere.  I haven't tried to make the glaze with brown sugar yet, but I will have to give that a shot next time.  The name is deceiving, so don't expect a "brownie".  We prefer to call them Yam Bars because they are closer to a Lemon Bar, texture wise, than they are a Brownie.  But, whatever you call them, they are yummy!!!

Almost like a cake but so good and very different. Moist and delicious!!! A keeper for sure. The only change I made was cut down to 1 1/2 cup of sugar and 3 egss only.  Might cut down a bit more sugar the next time.

I live in Denver and subscribe to Door to Door Organics and had some leftover yams to use. This recipe is fabulous! I steamed the yams for 10 minutes and mashed them with a fork, then I put them in a mixer with one of the eggs to blend. I also only used 3/4 c. butter and nixed the salt. Due to the altitude, I only had to bake the brownies for about 25 minutes. I thought I'd try them before adding the frosting and I'm glad I did because I think they're sweet enough. Plus, I didn't want to add any extra fat if I didn't have to. Enjoy!

These are so wonderful! I would never have thought to use yams in this way! I discovered this recipe when I had an excess of yams in my pantry (during the Thanksgiving season, when they are super cheap) and a craving for something sweet and healthy. I've found the recipe to be pretty forgiving to my inevitable "tweaks" like cutting the sugar a bit, increasing the yam content, or adding different spices or flavourings. Have fun with it! My only criticism would be that the "yammies" end up tasting a little startchy- probably a result of incorporating so much raw yam. You'll definitely want to use the fine shredding side of your grater- otherwise the texture is all off.

I wish I could give this 10 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with the best glazed cake (since that's really what it is) I've ever had!  So moist and yummy. Got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.

Delicious! I love sneaking vegetables into my desserts; I feel a bit less guilty knowing there's something nutritious in there. :)  The sugar glaze was great on it.  For my personal nutritional preferences, I did reduce the amount of glaze as well as the amount of sugar in the blondies themselves, I substituted applesauce and yogurt for half the butter, and I replaced 1/2 C of the flour with whole wheat... and I thought it still came out delicious. Light and moist and yummy!

It was delicious. I brought half the batch to work and they were gone in less than 5 minutes. My 5year-old daughter loved the Orange Halloween cake I made and wants me to make it again. I did cut the sugar back by 3/4 c and one less egg. Also I used fresh sweet potato that steamed in microwave 1st. On our list as a favorite!

Really yummy!  We did cut back on the sugars as one reviewer recommended, used only whole wheat flour, added some cinnamon, and did not make the glaze.  They were plenty sweet and I'm not sure if people were concerned about the yams - I just shredded them on a cheese grater and they do disappear into the batter while baking, similar to carrots or zucchini in  similar recipes - but even more so.  Fun change of pace for snack time or dessert.  :)

I really loved this recipe!  My husband wasn't quite a fan at first, because he loves brownies and was expecting something with chocolate. But on his second piece, he ended up liking it a lot, so I agree with the other reviewers who find the name "brownie" to be a misnomer here.  I used grated fresh sweet potato (couldn't get yams), and it was just wonderful.  No need to cook the yams or used the canned variety. :)  I'll definitely make this again!

Edit: Made this again,  as is with no changes, this time for a company potluck, and it was a big hit!  Now I have my go-to recipe for holiday potlucks.  Thank you for posting such a wonderful recipe! :)

I'll start off by letting you know I grew my own yams, a great feat for a girl from the Bronx! I was excited to get started on this recipe. I had all the ingredients but the vanilla extract so I substituted with almond extract....OMG! Awesome! I suggest you try this immediately!

I read all the reviews before I started these and made changes based on what I knew we would/would not like.  And these were...ok.  The biggest issue, as others have indicated, is the texture.  For most people, the name of a recipe conjures up a picture of what it will be.  If you like your brownies to have a cake-like texture, this is probably a great choice for you.  If you like them more dense and chewy, you'll end up disappointed.  Regarding flavor, as written this wouldn't work for us.  I reduced the sugars, added cinnamon, nutmeg and pecans, and subbed oj for the milk in the glaze, all of which were good choices for us.  I was hoping for a chewy and dense brownie-like consistency so followed one reviewer's suggestion to leave out the baking powder.  I also used a 10x15 bar pan (baked 20 minutes only) to get a thinner result.  I'm glad I made those changes. And, after all is said and done, they were ok.  I took them to work, people said 'thanks' but the usual compliments were not forthcoming.  This is one I won't go back to.

I made these for a friend who loves sweet potatoes! She thought they were better than chocolate brownies. I liked them too, although i like Blondies better. I would make them again but I wouldn't put them on my "top 10" list.

Yummy way to eat some good for you sweet potato/yams.  I recommend cutting back the sugar about 1/4 for both brown and white sugars.  You probably could do the same with the butter.  Someone else recommended raisins and cinnamon too ... going to try that next time for sure!!

I love this recipe, it is so versatile.  I made these with Purple Sweet Potatoes (find them at an Asian Grocery).  I replaced the brown sugar with white (didn't want the color to affect the pretty purple shredded sweet potato, same with the vanilla, I replaced it with Triple Sec (a clear, orange flavored liquor).  For the glaze on top I heated Ube Jam (purple yam jam, very popular in the Philippines, also found this at the Asian Grocery) and thinned it with milk until it was a spreading consistancy.  I waited for the brownies to cool, cut them out with a straight edge knife, they are super sticky and crumbly, so cut carefully, then I covered them with the purple yam glaze.  They were so pretty and everyone at the club loved them.  Thanks so much Starflower!

I made these exactly as written. I wasn't crazy about the texture of the brownies with the shredded sweet potato. The flavor was good but I think I would have liked them better if the potatoes were cooked and mashed, then added to the batter. I also agree with the reviews that say to decrease the butter. It was just a little too much for me. I would try it again with some modifications though

These are always a hit! I like the texture better when I use three eggs instead of four, but four is good too! I also like to top them with cream cheese frosting. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Finally made this recipe after it being in my recipe box for several years. It was wonderful! Without telling my son what was in it, I offered him a piece – he even asked for seconds! Unfortunately, he "found out" the "secret ingredient" and was outraged that his mother would fool him into eating the dreaded sweet potato – all the while chowing down on yet another piece! I did not pre-cook the sweet potato; I just shredded it in the food processer. And, thinking it might be too sweet for my family's tastes, I cut the amount of sugar to only 1/2 cup of brown (eliminating the white sugar completely). I also cooked it in an 8x8 pan and only used 1/2 cup icing sugar for the frosting. It was heavenly!! I will definitely be making this recipe again! Oh, we also call it "Golden Blondies" because a "brownie" usually has chocolate in it.

I love these but thought they were too sweet, so I didn't make the glaze. Next time I made them I cut the white sugar to 3/4 c and swapped half the butter for applesauce. Yum!! So moist!! I might experiment with one less egg to see if they will hold up better on a cookie tray.

Very tasty. I didn't measure everything out perfectly I kind of just eyed everything. But it was very good. I would say though that is it pretty sweet and I didnt put the glaze over it. I also found that it was a bit greasy and needs less butter. I also used 3 eggs as I hate desserts that taste eggy and doing this I couldnt taste any eggs.  Great Recipe, I feel guilty everytime I take a bite of it

For those of you who like a less "cakey" brownie, just leave out the baking powder.  That's what I did, and they came out wonderfully dense and chewy.  I also added 1 tsp fresh ginger, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, and a cup of raisins to one batch.  It was quite good without them, but absolutely to die for with them.  I kept the full amount of sugar, and loved it with the glaze.  My boyfriend preferred it without glaze, which surprised me because he's usually more of a sweet tooth, but I was really glad I made several versions.  I rated this a 5 because a good "base" recipe is worth far more than one you can't add anything to, because everyone has different tastes.  This is definitely a "season to taste" recipe.  I will definitely be making this recipe over and over again for many years to come.

These are fabulous!  I had some leftover sweet potato casserole from Thanksgiving, so I used 2 cups of that instead of fresh grated.  Great way to use up the leftovers!  My daughter, who would not touch the sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving, LOVES these.  I only used 2 eggs based on another review and also less sugar because my casserole had marshmallows in it.  Really good, will definitely make these again, thanks!

Yup, these are a good idea!  I call them Goldies, and they don't stay around for very long.  A nice change of dessert pace too.  I followed the recipe exactly, and shredding the yams in the food processor (with shredder attachment) makes them a breeze to make.

Very good.  I think this recipe requires a couple small changes to make it five stars.  I can't imagine using the full amount of sugar called for, plus the glaze.  I halved the recipe and used 1/3 c. white sugar and 1/3 c. brown sugar, and left off the glaze entirely.  Like another reviewer, I felt that these turned out greasy with the amount of butter called for, so I may try this again subbing applesauce for some of the butter.  With a few small changes, this is a keeper.

Really enjoyed this recipe but 1 cup of butter made them seem really greasy, I think next time I will use 1/4 to 1/2 cup of butter and replace the rest with natural applesauce. I like the butter flavor so I don't want to get rid of it completely, but I do want to cut back on the greasiness and I think the applesauce will taste great with the other flavors :)

I bought a new baking pan that's like a muffin tin only the cups are square. I made this recipe to try out the new pan. It was awesome! I added one extra egg, because it was lonely in there by itself. I was a bit concerned that the batter was very loose and you could see small butter specks. Cooked up wonderful and dense. Everyone loved it. I did not glaze, but put a pecan struesel on top before baking - YUM!

Based on the reviews, I expected these to be amazing, but they were flat tasting--just sweet, nothing else. I'm from the south and we do all sorts of tastier things with sweet potatoes. This reminded me of a sweet potato casserole but not as good. I really wanted to like these more.

Wow, these are much better than I could have ever expected.  Although maybe I wasn't expecting much since they have sweet potato in them and I'm not a fan of yam.  I haven't tried them out on the rest of the family yet but I don't think I will have problems finding takers.  I followed the recipe exactly and produced very moist, delicious golden brownies.

These are NOT browines, at least not by my standards (ie. chewy, rich and dense). This is sweet potato cake, it is a pretty yummy yellow cake with shreds of sweet potato running through it...and a little weird. I was expecting some fantastic new "brownie" recipe...I was dissapointed, not so much in the recipe its self because the CAKE is good enough, but this is not a brownie recipe.

Way to SWEET! I guess I should have realized with 1 cup of white, 1 cup of brown sugar, and the addition of powdered sugar icing.  Also, the grated yam was completely disguised, which was the main reason I chose the recipe.  And, they were a little difficult to cut as they were so soft from the baking powder I am guessing. The texture was more of a soft cake like consistency than a brownie.  Might be good for a Halloween party as the color is a light yellow-orange.  Because of the excessive sweetness I ate one and gave the rest to a friend with kids to share the tray.

These were great with my changes. I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan. I used half of the sugar called for once the recipe was halfed making it 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4c brown sugar. I used 1/4c vogetable oil and 1/4c applesauce instead of the butter. Cooked them for about 35 minutes. Oh and I didn't use the icing. Next time I will probably omit all the white sugar and only use the 1/4c brown as they were still VERY sweet. I also agree with other reviews that this is more like cake than a brownie but a recipe worth trying none the less.  P.S. the kids LOVED them and with the chnages they are only 50 calories. YAY!

FANTASTIC!!  These are SOOO moist and delicious!  My husband actually said this might be his favorite of the desserts I've made.  I followed advice from some reviewers and cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup (will cut back more next time cuz it's still VERY sweet) and I one and a half'ed the icing... however I felt it was too much.  Perhaps that's why these brownies were a bit too sweet??  In any event, these were very yummy and I highly recommend this recipe!  Oh!  just wanted to add that the grating of the yam was easy... it doesn't take long... and it's definitely the way to go!!

This recipe is outstanding!  I lowered the sugars by a 1/4 cup each and thought it could even be lowered more. Next time, I'd only use a 1/2 cup of each sugar since the glaze adds so much sweetness as well. I brought these into work and everyone gobbled them up. I will be making them again for sure!

Very unique recipe! Baked this last night and my husband and I both thought it was good. I wouldn't call these brownies though, it's cake. I followed the "cake" part of the recipe exactly as written. It came out very moist and I didn't feel it was too sweet as some others have stated. As for the icing, I originally made it according to the recipe, but when I tasted it something was missing. I added 1/4 tsp. of vanilla extract and then it was perfect. I'll probably make these again.

This was excellent and very well received. I introduced this dish to some close friends during the Eagles/Cowboys playoff game yesterday. I only told them I was bringing two sets of brownies: my usual chocolate amaretto brownies and a second set with a "secret ingredient". I would not tell them the ingredient until they actually sampled the brownies. Everyone that tried them (kids and adults) adored them, and almost everyone was floored when I revealed the secret ingredient.  I followed the recipe very closely, except for the glaze. I substituted half of the milk with butterscotch liqueur...very tasty!

These were excellent, I couldn't stop eating them!  I used 1/2 the amount of white sugar and mixed in some whole wheat flour instead of using only white flour.  The result was a longer baking time and a slightly nutty flavor with the whole wheat flour.

I really had high hopes for this recipe but was disappointed.  I love sweet potatoes/yams but this lacked flavor.  Maybe it was the potatoes.  After tasting them I added cinnamon to the topping but that did not help.  They are pretty though.  Will not make again.

This is a great recipe. I used a whole can (29 oz.) can of yams. I mashed them with a potatoe masher. I used 3 eggs instead of 4 and added 2 tsp. cinnamon. I also baked them in a 10x15 inch pan. A double recipe of the glaze is a bit too much. maybe 1 1/2 next time.

Oh..my..goodness!!!! I used 4 eggs, 3/4 each of sugars, shredded carrots (leftover from juicing), and added shredded coconut and raisins; omitted glaze as it was already perfectly sweetened. The Result: A flavorful, dense, moist cake. Served hot with tea, so perfect for a cold, rainy day.

Brownie or cake, yam or sweet potato, you say potato I say potawto...who cares?  These are so good!  Super moist with a unique flavor.  We loved them.  I reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup and only used 1 tsp. vanilla.  I used my food processor to grate the sweet potato which is sort of a coarse grate but it was perfect.  Just the right amount of icing.  This is a good one for the holidays when you end up with an extra sweet potato in the pantry.

Yummy--but I agree with others that this is way more of a cake type dessert than a brownie.  It is actually pretty similar to a butter cake recip (which makes sense since it has 2 sticks of butter).  But at the end of the day, my kids ate it happily and had no idea they were eatcing sweet potatoes (which I used instead of yams).

These are wonderful.  I made some changes, however slight, I need to tell about them.. I used 3 teaspoons of vanilla.. (I always add more vanilla than called for) and I didn't measure the yams.  I just grated one good sized one and used it all.  It's really moist and yummy. I also used less than one cup each of the brown and white sugars.  I figured with the icing it would be sweet enough.. I was right!  This is one way to get some good beta carotine in your kids and they won't object.

This is a great recipe.  However, I am dissappointed because I was expecting a rich brownie.  This is not a rich brownie.  It is a cake.  I followed the recipe to a T.  If the name was changed, I would give it a 5 star.  I told my guests, I was making brownies, and I have cake instead.  Oh, I did make this recipe twice, as some of my co workers were intrigued as to what I was making.  The second batch, I put a heavy sprinkling of pecans on top, and it really made these over the top.

These were absolutely delicious, however I attribute a lot of that to the fact that I added 1tsp cinnamon, 1tsp  ground nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves. This gave the brownies a really good autumn taste! Also, I did not drain or cook the yams after shredding. It took me nearly an hour to bake them because they were really gooey inside (tastes great, but hard to remove from pan!). The toothpick test did not work. It came out clean, but then when I tried to cut them, they sort of fell apart so they had to go back in the oven. I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the glaze. I didn't think they were too sweet.

I was sort of disappointed after reading all the rave reviews. I made a half batch of these, and cut back on the sugar slightly. The taste was ok, but I found the texture odd.. sort of spongy. I'll eat them, but my husband won't. I wouldn't make them again.

This recipe is very good! I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg because I love those spices with sweet potatoes. Instead of baking in a 9x13" pan I made cupcakes and instead of using the glaze I made Cream Cheese Frosting II and put that on top. YUM!

I whipped these up for a Bachelorette party this past weekend. The bride-to-be is watching her figure and I decided that for a baked good, these at least SOUND healthy. All the girls loved them! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 3 eggs instead of 4. Even with that omission, it came out as a dense cake. Next time (there WILL be one!)I will use 2 eggs, all brown sugar, and a pinch or two of nutmeg. DELISH!

Absolutely delicious and moist.  I think anyone scared of sweet potatoes would love these.
I used sweet potatoes (the yellow flesh ones) that I microwaved then mashed - next time I'll mash them better because they were a little overly lumpy.  I think these would be great with pecans, or maybe butterscotch chips in them for variety.  But as is, D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!

Oh my Gosh, this sounded good, even to my hubby and son. However, not good, at least for our taste. It came out to be more like a cake rather than a brownie. And even as a cake, ewww. After trying to choke it down for 2 days, I opted to throw it out for the birds and whatever other wild animal wanted it. They didn't like it either. I ended up burying it.

These were very good, but, if made as written, very greasy.  I made them again because they still went really fast, and I had leftover grated yam anyway.  (I used the fine grater blade on my food processor - worked really well.)  I cut the butter in half, omitted one egg and the white sugar and increased the brown sugar  to 1-1/4 cups.  I also added about a cup of raisins.  The resulting bars have a wonderful caramelly taste that really compliments the yams.  I didn't bother with the icing because they're sweet enough as is.  YUMMY!

Can you put another plus behind this rating?  I make this bad boy exactly as listed on the original recipe and it always turns out great. I'm back again to print it out for someone else who has requested it after sampling it's golden exctasy.

What a great idea! I took the advice of others and made a few alterations due to limitations of what I had in the cupboards.  I used a little less than 1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup sugar, removed one of the egg yolks, added some cinnamon and nutmeg, upped the vanilla, and used about 2.5 cups mashed yam (cooked in the microwave).  Baked for 35 minutes.  This turned out great!  It was fairly dense (although not like a real brownie) and just the right sweetness.  With more yams and less butter, sugar, and egg yolk, it's even healther, too!  Will definitely make again.

These were wonderful!  I was hoping they would be a little more dense, like a brownie.  They really were more like a cake.  That being said, the flavor was fabulous and everyone loved them!  Thanks a bunch!

A very sweet brownie!  It was good but took longer to bake for me.  I baked it for 40 minutes.  I would have omitted the topping if I didn't want it as sweet.  Good for someone who has a sweet tooth.

Certainly very good, yet not outstanding since they  sort of tasted bland. I just think two cups of shredded carrots would fit as well as two cups of yams. Sorry, but I probably won't make them again.

I can't get over how good this tastes. I live in Halifax and could not find a yam to save my life, used sweet potatoes instead. It was still good. Only thing I changed was adding more vanilla.

Excellent!  This is definitely not a brownie; more like a cake.  I used one whole yam and mixed everything in the food processor.  I baked it for 45min since it didn't look cooked.  I didn't bother with the icing.  Very moist!

My 6 year old son's kindergarten class was working on the letter Y so he had to make something with yams, let everyone in his family try and then write a report on who liked it and who didn't.  He picked this recipe.  Awesome choice!!  These were to die for!!  We followed the recipe exactly except we added a little vanilla to the glaze.  They were so moist.  They were more the consistency of coffee cake than brownies but that does not take away from the great taste.  My husband, the world's biggest vegetable hater, even loved them and said that, if I could make vegetables in this form all the time, he would love it!  Asparagus brownies??? I'm not so sure.  Yam brownies?  DEFINITELY!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh my gosh, these are sooo good!  I just don't even have anything else to say except that you have to try them--I sense that they will become a staple for me!  I used some baked yams leftover from Thanksgiving.  They were soft enough that I could just stir them in, although there were a few larger (1/4 in. size) pieces of yam left it didn't matter.  I think I'll still do that next time--easier than shredding!  Also, I used brown sugar in the glaze and it's amazing, nice and crunchy.  I may try honey on top next time!

Wow! I was so surprised by how well these turned out! I brought them to a ladies' gathering, and luckily had the foresight to bring the recipe with me. I ended up copying it for everyone. They were SO moist!! And with no oil...amazing! THanks for this incredible recipe. It's a keeper!

What a great flavor and so nutritious!  I think that it could use a different name than "brownies" since they aren't brown and don't even come close to tasting like a wonderful, chocolate brownie.  But they were great and actually tasted like a nutritious cousin of the Tres Leches cake, esp when warm.  would make again and again - perfect for kids to eat their veggies!

I reduced the bach just to sample it, and they came out really moist and almost sponge-like. The only thing I may want to add in the future is a dash of nutmeg or cinnamon for more of a robust flavor. I will definitely be making these for Thanksgiving this year!

I used sweet potatoes instead of yams and it was excellent. Definitely one of my favorites – very moist, not too dense. It’s fairly sweet on its own, so you could probably do without the glaze if desired.

Holy deliciousness!!!! This was divine!. I used 3/4 cup granulated brown sugar, 1 cup coconut palm sugar (to replace white sugar) and added ginger & cinnamon. I used slightly less butter but all 4 eggs and I used shredded sweet potatoes (uncooked) as opposed to yams. This one is a keeper!!

I only gave this recipe 4 stars for one reason: too much butter. I made this recipe to the letter, and, while delicious, there was so much grease on top when I took them out of the oven! Next time I'll follow some other reviews' changes and cut the butter w/ some applesauce. And maybe cut out one or two eggs since they were very spongy. Super tasty recipe- and you don't have to be a yam lover to agree!

Love sweet potatoes in many recipes. This is no exception. These are so easy to make and both times I've made them so far have come out exceptional. I've shared them with family and friends to rave reviews. I shredded the yams (sweet potatoes in my case) in the food processor and did not cook them. Don't know why you would go through the trouble to cook them. One time I let them cool before icing and the other I iced them right when they came out of the oven. They were good both ways. A little different but still excellent. The only brownies I'll make from now on.

I made these as written except I put the batter in a pie plate rather than 9x13 pan because I don't like a thin batter.  I used 1 lb sweet potatoes and I cooked and mashed them first.

Suprisingly awesome! I had a hard time imagining what they would taste like, but they ended up tasting sort-of like a moist carrot cake. I made it just like the recipe, it turned out perfect, and I ended up eating half the pan myself! (it's got veggies, right? ;)

Amazing Recipe.  The glaze makes it so good. I just brought it into work for one of my supervisors and they said "OH MY GOD" like 20 times. I plan on modifying it just to take out some sugar.  I might also add some walnuts and raisins to it as well.  

GREAT RECIPE! Make sure to have it when you serve this to someone for the first time.

WOW! Top 5 recipes I've ever made. ADD LEMON!!! This was the best addition I made. I zested a whole large lemon and the juiced it. This slight citrus addition really let the other flavors pop out. I made an account on this website just to put that recommendation.

I also cut the sugar a lot. Only used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar (as opposed to 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar). Also I ditched the frosting, and instead I caramelized some raisins and threw them on top. I used sweet potatoes not yams. Super delicious. This recipe will surprise and impress the people you serve it to. GREAT!!

DELICIOUS! Family loved it, including my toddler. Husband called it a healthy bread pudding. I omitted the white sugar altogether.. as the potatoes were already sweet. Only used 1 egg and 1 egg white instead of 4. Added 1/2tsp of cinnamon to the batter before baking, and another 1/2 tsp to the glaze topping. I think the cinnamon really made it flavorful. Was worried when I poured it into the 9x13 dish that I either had too little batter, or too big of a dish, but in the end I loved how the bars weren't thick. So if you want thicker bars, use a smaller dish. I did glaze while warm and the batter absorbed it beautifully. But I did wait for it to cool before cutting and they cut into perfect little bars. Will be making again and again.

I made a small batch to try, 8x8 pan. These are just wonderful.  I may add some nuts, finely chopped, next go around.  So, so moist and great flavor!

Excellent! To make this a little healthier, use 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, and cut both sugars to 3/4 cup. For more flavor, add 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp each ginger and nutmeg, and 1/2 cup of raisins. If you don't like overly flat cake, make one and a half times the recipe for a 9x13.

Good but not great.  I substituted 8 oz of vanilla greek yogurt for one stick of butter and used sweet potatoes instead of yams; however, I don't think that affected the taste much.  They were moist but didn't love the texture with the shredded sweet potatoes.  Save yourself time and use canned, mashed yams/sweet potatoes.

Absolutely wonderful!!!! I actually had a funny experience. I made this recipe and was surprised at how totally greasy and sickeningly oily it was. Then I realized that I had accidentally doubled the butter, oops! I tried making it again a few days later and was pleasantly surprised that it was as good as everyone said. I also added 1 teaspoon of Siagon Cinnamon (a spicy cinnamon that tastes like red hot candies. It's available at Costco). They were sooooooo gooooooood! I also used a large can of yams instead of shredding them. My daughter who despises sweet potatoes, loved these (of course I didn't tell her that there were sweet potatoes/yams in them - hehe).

Yummy!  Used peeled raw yams.  1/2 cup white 1/2 cup brown sugars.  Came out great, but someone said it was kind of like sweet potato corn bread so I guess the amount of sugar I used was too low.  I didnt make the icing so that probably would have sweetened them up a bit more.  I dont really like yams or sweet potatoes but this is a great way to eat them!

Ho-ly Cow!! These came out amazing! I prepared it just as the directions said. I just added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger into the mix. UNBELIEVABLE! It's like a cross between a pancake/muffin/brownie! So good. Everyone who tried has raved! Going to make it for Thanksgiving for sure! Thank you!!

I loved these brownies!  They were a hit both at home and the office.  Everyone who ate one asked me for the recipe.  I will definitely be using this recipe again in the near future.

I made these Golden Yam Brownies this afternoon and they were heavenly! Unfortunately, I did not have fresh yams, so I used two cups of mashed candied yams, and, along with the addition of some pumpkin pie spice, this was the only alteration I made to the recipe.

I found it to be a bit overwhelmingly sweet, but my mom, who admits that she is quite the sugar-addict, thought it was just perfect. 

I also didn't think that the texture was very much like that of a brownie (maybe more like a baked custard/pudding???) as it was a bit too moist for a brownie, and, although set, was quite wet. I'm guessing this happened because I used canned yams? 

I still enjoyed this recipe quite a bit, and will definitely be trying it again! I would like to attempt it with fresh yams, but, I have to admit, am a huge fan of the custard-like consistency yielded by the canned yams! 

After baking this, my whole kitchen smells just like the holidays! This is a wonderful dish for fall, Thanksgiving, Christmas, or just a very decadent dessert for those with a sweet tooth! Highly recommended!

They are more like carrot cake then brownies, but nonetheless delicious. I completely omitted the white sugar since I figured they'd be sweet enough with the yams, brown sugar, and the glaze. I also used almond milk instead of cow milk. They were a hit with my roommates and boyfriend.

These are absolutely fabulous!!! I used 1/2 white flour, 1/2 whole wheat flour. Didn't use the glaze and cut white sugar down to 1/2 cup. They were still super sweet and this is coming from a sugar addict! Next time I'll try cutting the sugar even further just to see how healthy I can get these without sacrificing taste. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This is yummy! I did make some changes and am noting them here for when I make this again. I halved the recipe,used 1/4 c of ww flour, used a cooked yam since that's all I had, but plan to use a fresh one next time. I used 1/2 apple sauce 1/3 canola oil. I did use the glaze and used the real butter it called for and also added a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. These alterations were based on a half recipe. This was plenty sweet and incredibly moist.

These are sooo good. I replaced all the butter with unsweetened applesauce. Also I only had cooked sweet potatoes so I mashed them in. Will make many more times.

Oh my goodness, these are wonderful.  Other than using a fresh grated sweet potato instead of a yam, I followed the recipe exactly and they came out sweet, moist, and probably the yummiest dessert I've ever tasted.  Sooo addicting.  Thank you Starflower!

Absolutely scrumptious! Now this will be one of my favorite recipes to bake. I made only 1 change to the ingredient.  Use 1 large can of Candied Yams.  Drain and smash the yams really good and fold into the batter.  This is cake like, but super moist that is loaded with beta carotene. Thank you for having this recipe, I can’t wait to serve it up!

These were amazing!  I actually only had cooked yams, so I used those, and they made these SO MOIST!  I especially liked these warm.  I prefer to warm them up rather than eat them at room temp. My kids loved them too, and i think we ate the whole pan by the next day.  Be careful, I would make them to share, or cut recipe in half or you might gain some lbs, cause you'll want to eat them all!

These were great! But they fell apart a bit and they were very chewy.  I think next time I might play with the proportions and try making muffins with them and frosting them with cream cheese frosting. I also added dried cranberries for a tart bite.

These things are absolutely delicious.  I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestion and lowered the amount of sugar -- I used 3/4s of a cup of each, and they're still a little too sweet but nothing not tolerable and I know if I lower it more they'll be absolutely fantastic. I'm totally going to make these again.

I was really disappointed in these, especially after all of the great reviews! I don't know what went wrong with mine, but they came out VERY oily and mushy. Even after baking an extra 10-15 minutes they never really set up. Just a soggy mess.

I will say that the taste is amazing - but with that said, these are way too sweet and not brownie-like in texture.  I had to cook mine much longer than the 30 minutes and they still weren't the right texture - I made it as written - maybe more flour?  I may experiment with the recipe by adding less butter (because they were also very oily!!!) and maybe more flour - a unique idea with good flavor, but definitely not a keeper as written.

I needed to find something to do with a single sweet potato so I halfed the recipe and used 1 mashed sweet potatoe (after baking for ten minutes in the microwave) and added the rest of the baked ingredients and made muffins. The confectioner's topping isn't even necessary. My family gobbled them up and asked for more.

I made several changes to make these a lot healthier, and they still taste great.   I only used 1/2 cup each of the white and brown sugars, 1/3 cup of splenda, 1/2 cup of canola oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the butter, and 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of all purpose flour.  I also sprinkled walnuts on top of the glaze.  They were still really moist without all that butter and plenty sweet with 1/2 of the sugar.

Tasty and unusual with the yams.  After reading the reviews I cut the sugars to 3/4 cup each, and also added 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the cake batter.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the glaze.  When I make this again I will use one cup of brown sugar, no white sugar, 2 eggs, 1 stick of butter, 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg.  I may also add pecans.

SOOO Yummy. Everyone loved it! My husband and I couldn't get enough of it. my 2 year old kept asking for more. :) I would also say its more cake like than brownie. but who cares how ya call it..still really good. Based on other tips I also used half the butter, since thats all I had and didn't want to make a trip to the store. I also added 1 tsp of cinnimon and 1/8tsp of ginger. And it took about 50mins to bake...not 30mins Highly recommend giving this a try!

I first halved the recipe, and then I substituted 1/4 cup of applesauce for 1/4 cup of the butter, and I added more vanilla along with cinnamon and nutmeg and just 3/4 of a cup of sugar.  It was moist and tasted like a fine sweet potato pudding (like bread pudding, not the stuff in a cup).  No icing needed - it was delicious. Add the "sweet spices" they really kick up the flavor!

This cakey brownie was alright but a bit bland and too sweet. If I make again I will add some spices and cut back on the sugar. Also the icing is not needed.

It's delicious.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown super.  I also cut the butter by 1/3 and just used 1 & 1/2 sticks of butter.  It still turns out very good.

OMG! What a delicious recipe! Based on reviews, I added 1-1/2 tsp. cinnamon and about a cup of chopped pecans. I also reduced the sugars to 3/4 cup each (I subbed brown sugar/Splenda blend for the brown sugar). I had to bake it for 40 minutes. I omitted the glaze because it's plenty sweet without it. This has the texture of cake rather than brownies but regardless, I will definitely make it again and again.

EXCELLENT recipe!!!  Just had some fresh out of the oven, I made it with part Stivia, and part white sugar, and since I made it without reading the recipe all the way through first, I mixed EVERYTHING altogether lol, and it still turned out very yummy!!!  Would make an awesome pot luck item!

MMMMM.... I'm not sure I would call these brownies per se but they are delicious. I kept the recipe exactly as is for my first go at it. I added only 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Thank you STARFLOWER, it's delicious and completely original. I baked mine in a cast iron style muffin pan but only because my new boyfriends house is painfully unprepared for baking. Nothing 9x13 in sight. The crust is buttery and crunchy. I baked them for 21 minutes. I'd best describe it as a dense, sweet cornbread'esque treat - both sugary and a little savory. It's an amazing flavor combination and could be either a desert or a fusion style side to a turkey or pork dinner. Enjoy all...

My husband summed this up correctly by saying these are one ingredient away from being great.  They are wonderfully moist and sweet, but hate to say - kinda boring otherwise. I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Perhaps some spices, or as another reviewer suggested, some raisins or another dried fruit.  Also, just FYI - I had to cook mine longer than 30 minutes - I went 35, and they were still much more moist than you see in the picture shown.  They lost their shape a bit when I put them on the serving platter and weren't as pretty as shown.  Not sure that I will make these again.

I have made this for YEARS but I do variations of this cake with chocolate, pumpkin, bananas and even butterscotch! Wonderful, moist and so delicious! I have also made them healthier omitting and changing things up a bit and it works beautifully! Just wanted to share this with you all. Let your imagination run wild with this cake base, just change the yams to whatever you'd like and go from there!

Delicious! I made these for friends at school and everyone devoured them. I would agree with the last review and say that they were a bit on the sweet side... I wouldn't omit the icing but perhaps cutting back the sugar in the brownie itself would help.

really really good! but very greasy - which surprised me... i will absolutely be making these again, but i'm going to play around to get rid of the greasiness -   also - i completely omitted the white sugar and they were still plenty sweet... and i had to cook them a lot longer!

I mean, it tastes good, but it is not a brownie! Not even close, and not better like some people have suggested. And just because it has sweet potatoes in it does not mean you can call it good for you like many other reviews stated! Have you seen all the sugar and butter in this?! Kind of negates whatever was once healthy. Also, tastes more like a muffin or cake.

Good stuff.  I just wanted to mention, though, that yams and sweet potatoes are not the same thing.  Yams in this recipe would not work out so well.  Use sweet potatoes!

This was really good.  I made it the first time exactly as the recipe was written.  It was too "cakey" to be called a brownie so I think I will cut back on the eggs next time.  Maybe then the texture will be more like a brownie.  The only change I did make was to cut the glaze in half.  I spread it over the warm cake & when it cooled it was like the glaze on a donut rather than a frosting.  Perfect!

Not only is my husband absolutely addicted to these, but since I shared the recipe with family it's become a regular dessert at every major gathering.   There's a few changes I've made over time: First, since my husband is otherwise a health nut, I use smart balance light instead of butter, 2 cups of turbinado sugar instead of white and brown -- though this last time I made them I cut it down to 1 cup of sugar and they still tasted splendid. I use whole wheat flour and mix in a few tablespoons of freshly ground flax for an extra health kick. For the yam I buy one medium/large yam that is easily 2 cups solid. Then I have my husband shred it and use the whole thing. It makes for extra moist brownies. Otherwise I follow the recipe to a T but omit the icing, they're loved enough without it.   Thanks!

I am stymied as to how folks can rate this recipe with integrity when they haven't even followed the directions. Mashing vs. grating is an entirely different dynamic. To customize to my taste, I added approx. 2 t. cinnamon, big pinch of nutmeg, and used almost 4 C. of grated yams. This is a delicious recipe.

Amazing, it tastes sorta like a butterscotch cake, that melts in your mouth. I didn't add the frosting, and it still turned out great. My roommates and I ate the whole thing in one day, it was that good.

These were just okay.  Against my better judgement I went ahead and baked them in the 9x13 I should have used my 10x15.  They were alot thicker than pictured.  The flavor was good but I expected better.  My family who are big sweet eaters didn't finish them and I ended up tossing have the pan.

Absolutely delicious!! A great "something different" dessert.  I did make a couple changes to the recipe- used only 1/2 C brown and 1/2 C white sugar.  With the sweetness of the yams and glaze these are perfectly sweet and flavorful.  Also substituted 3/4 C whole wheat flour, and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Thank you!!

It's a great use of leftover yams from Thanksgiving. Since they were prepared yams I used half the butter and half of both the white and brown sugar. It was definitely sweet enough!

It didn't get 5 stars because I did add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ginger which added a lot of great and necessary flavor. I also only used 2 eggs, 4 eggs is excessive. 

The other complaint was that the stringy texture of the yams was still prominent. I just mashed them this time. I suggest whipping them up well, perhaps with an egg, to give them a smoother texture.

This recipe is great!  I wouldn't tell anyone what was in the "brownies" until they tasted it and they couldn't believe it once I told them.  Everyone went back for second servings.  Very similiar to a carrot cake...delicious! (I made no changes to the recipe)

I made this recipe for the first day of school.  My co-workers really liked them, and the pan is empty.  Thanks for a great recipe.
Oh, there really is no need to cook the yam or use canned, just follow the recipe and shred the raw, peeled yam and it comes out fine.

The flavor worked well, but perhaps my leftover sweet potatoes were too moist, as I baked, and baked, and baked these past the recommended time, and still ended up with a very wet center.

Had really high hopes for these based on the reviews and our love of yams.  My husband and I thought they were just okay and the kids did not like them at all(even before they knew about the yams in the recipe!) We prefer pumpkin bars over these.  Sorry.

Some of the best recipes contain ingredients already found in your kitchen with only 1 added extra that you may have to buy.  In this case I came across this recipe and couldn't resist trying it - I only had to buy the yam!  And now I may have to keep yams in my kitchen all the time because I've had three phone calls since yesterday (when it was served at a party) asking for the recipe and asking that I bring them again.  I've never had a response such as this and they were gone so fast I had to share one with a friend to get a taste.  Now THAT'S a recipe!

These were good, but certainly not heavenly... nor, if you check the butter and sugar content, particularly healthy. But, on the positive side, they were a unique dish to serve and they did disappear!! I used only half the icing and they were plenty sweet, can't imagine using the entire bowlful.

These are good for what they are, but I personally prefer eating yams prepared in a more traditional fashion. This recipe was fun to try, but it's just not worth all the work to make it again.

I cut it down to 1/2 cup of butter, 3/4 cup of white sugar, 3 eggs and I omitted the brown sugar and icing. It was fine that way, sweet enough as a dessert but not overpowering the yams. This suited my taste and waistline better :)  Altho putting it to 1 cup white sugar would've made it more decadent.

Pretty good!  Different from the usual banana bread I make, so change is great!  Turned out more like a cake and not a brownie, though.  Next time I will use less eggs.  Thank you for great recipe!

These were wonderful.  I used fresh sweet-potatoes and mashed them, I topped them with the sour cream frosting from this site, the tang of the frosting went perfectly with the sweetness of the bars.  I omitted 1 egg and it seemed to help keep the bars more dense and "brownie" like.  I renamed them Sweet Potato Bars and my office gobbled them up.  great and easy recipe.  Thanks

Fantastic.  My fourteen year old son thinks they should be called "goldies" not brownies :)!  I didn't tell anyone what the "secret" ingredient was until they had all tasted them - it cracked him up that it was yams.  He kept asking for them all day long, saying, "But mom, they're healthy - think of all the vitamins I'm getting in every bite!"  He could only eat a small square each time because they were so rich.  Addictive.  Thank you, Starflower.

Wow, my kids love these and what a fabulous nutrition value for kids who won't eat veggies and fruit.  I always cut the sugars back to 3/4 cup and add 1/4 cup sweet potatoes.  Only use 3 eggs.  Will add 1 tsp. cinnamon next time.

These were very good.  I substituted a sweet potato because that's all I had in the house. I also used my food processor to shred the sweet potato--it was a lot easier than using a grater.  I didn't put the glaze on the brownies while they were warm, maybe that would have made them five-star.  This is also more like a cake.

There were no words at our dinner table when I served this; moans and other appreciative noises, but no words.  My biggest problem with this recipe is the fantasy that there are 24 servings.  No way a 2x2 square of this golden yammy goodness is enough.  More realistic is six servings so you get 1/3 cup of yams in every serving and can pretend it's good for you!  Even my 2-year-old, who had just eaten enough for a grown man, shoveled this in with two fists (and he hates using his hands).

I used 2 medium yams and ended up with way too much so perhaps one medium-largish should do it.  I agree with others that perhaps the name brownie is misleading, but we'll just call it something else at our house and use this recipe again!

These were delicious. I'm thinking of leaving off the glaze and serving as a side dish similar to corn pudding. I thought of adding a tiny bit of pumpkin pie spice but these really don't need a thing. They are very sweet. A keeper!

These were absolutely fabulous...and my extremely picky 2 year old even cleaned his plate!  Any recipe capable of that is a winner in my book!
I didn't even use the icing and they were still so delicious! :-)  Thanks for a great recipe!

YUM! =) What a different way to make brownies.  These were indeed very moist, almost cake-like.  Will make this again.

Easy to make and very good.  Even better the next day.  Took it to a church function where we needed to bring refreshments.  Everyone loved them.

Who would have thought that you could even make brownies from yams?  We do love our chocolate!  Just don't tell the kids whats in them :) Yum!

These brownies are a great way to get some vegetables into my vegetable-hating children.  You don't need to cook the yams, just shred finely and they offer a nice texture to the brownie.  My only wish is to cut back on all the sugar (I may experiment with cutting some of the brown sugar).  That said, do not skip the powdered sugar glaze which seeps into the brownies, it gives these brownies the WOW factor in taste.

Very tasty!  A big hit at our Church luncheon.  I did add a topping of mashed yams, powdered sugar, cinnamon & diced pecans. It was great!

Super moist & super sweet! My boys loved it. I added a bit of cinnamon and some nutmeg to it. Probably should have baked it a bit longer than I did, mine came out extra gooey but no one had any complaints. I think I’ll cut the sugar a bit next time I make it so it won’t be quite so overpoweringly sweet.

These disappeared instantly. Everyone ate them, kids and husband included. I think I may cut back on the sugar a bit next time.

I made this following a few suggestions to cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup each. I skipped the glaze since I prefer less sweet. I also tossed in a tsp of pumpkin spice mix. They were very moist and loved by all. I may cut down a bit on the butter the next time I make them.

These are very tasty but extremely sweet. I cut the sugar by a bit over half and substituted with 3/4 raw organic cane sugar and 1/4 white sugar. Cut a bit of the butter also.  It turned it way too oily and still too sweet. Maybe I will only use 1/2 the butter and 1/4 cup cane sugar instead. Worth making again with changes.

We made it without the white sugar and without the glaze. If we had, it would have been too sweet for us. But with less sugar, it's still delicious--light and airy. It's hard to eat only one!

Rum soaked raisins anyone??  I took  major liberties with this recipe with interesting results:  3 eggs, 1/2 c butter, 1/2c plain greek yogurt, 1 cup packed demerera sugar (no white sugar at all), 3 cups yams, 1tsp grated ginger, 1/2 tsp powder ginger, 1.5 tsp cinammon, 1/2 cup raisins soaked in 2 oz of Appleton's rum.   Results were a VERY moist cake that took over an hour to cook.  Tastes delicious, still very moist and if I made it again I'd adjust the flour or leave out the yogurt.  The rum and raisins taste amazing so would def do that again

DELICIOUS. Family couldn't stop eating it. A little too moist when fresh out of the oven, in my opinion. I'm probably going to cutback the amount of egg a little bit but otherwise top notch.

I also added some nutmeg and cinnamon per the top review's advice and it was a good addition.

I did make the modifications the others made, and really did not like it.  I had to add a lot of extra spices just to eat it.  We threw away half the batch.

I have made these many many times..in fact they are requested more than my chocolate brownies.  The only thing I do differently, is reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup and the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, and then add a little more yam.    Delish and not quite as sweet.

We made this for our annual Ugly Sweater Party in 2015.  Amazing.  I used canned Yams and added a little of the Yam juice to the top of the pan just before baking and it added a nice crisp crust that was extra yummy.  I don't normally get a lot of raves on my baking as my daughter but this time "I Win!"

Wow, were these a hit!  Seriously delicious.  The only mods I made were reducing the white and brown sugars to 3/4 cups each and also adding 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, and just short of a 1/2 tsp cloves.

My boyfriend and his buddies (house guests for the holidays) demolished the whole pan in 2 days and these guys aren't the biggest sweets lovers :)

These are delicious!!!!!  I had to cook longer than 30 minutes and I even added the glaze and returned them to oven for about 15 more min. The brownies were moist and have a great chewy crust. What a neat alternative to traditional brownies.

I (and the other election workers that were my guinea pigs) really enjoyed these and would give 5 stars yet I too reduced the butter to 1/2 c. and sugar to 1/2 c. and felt it had more of a cake texture than brownie. The consensus of the more experienced bakes is to reduce the eggs to 1 or 2 to get that brownie texture. I will let you know.  Overall I really loved the flavor, healthy aspect and will make these again. thanks for a lovely brownie.

Absolutely loved this recipe. I was looking for a recipe to use for some frozen yam patties we had & decided to try it with this. They were so good that I can only imagine how good it will be with fresh product! Definitely a hit in my home! Even the veggie resistant 10 year old loved them.

The flavor was amazing! The texture was too dense - but not like  brownie dense. Would have liked it more "cake like" But the flavor really is amazing! Worth a try - and will make again,

Addictive! Best cake ever!!! Perfect for something different from the same holiday desserts being served. Amazing, moist, flavorful. I added 1/2 a cup more yams, just for my preference.

My kitchen smells amazing! This recipe is so easy and yummy. I also made a few adjustments as oer other reviews, little less on both sugars and 3 eggs instead of four. I could decide wether to use raw grated or cooked mashed, so i split it it. I used 1c mashed yams ( left overs from last night, spiced with a hint of curry) and 1 c grated carrot. O M G it smells to die for. Havent even tasted it yet lol but 5 stars all the way. I always end up throwing out left yams, no more! Thanks for the recipe!

Made recipe as is, no changes. Came out moist and delicious. My friend replaced the butter with applesauce and it came out too runny so she needed to add more flour. Took longer to bake than stated, about 40 minutes needed. Very tasty. Sort of like a carrot cake tasting. Will very much so make again.

Perfect "trick" food to get my vegetable-phobic son to eat the good stuff! I agree with previous reviewers that the glaze is definitely optional without any consequence. Sweet, gooey, and filling. Love this "tricky treat"!

BESTEST THING IN THE WORLD! I love to bake but mostly its hit n miss. My husband doesn't have much of a sweet tooth so out of politeness he'll take a slice or two of whatever I bake. Well, not this time! He had three pieces in the first 'tasting' and was hovering around the brownie vicinity all evening. By the next day it was all gone. He's asked me to bake it again. THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE! Here are the changes I made, and only out of necessity. Used only 1 cup brown sugar (because of aforementioned sweet-tooth-less hubby) and 1 1/2 cups grated yams because that's how much 1 yam yielded. Wasn't about to waste the good stuff. Rest of the recipe exactly as mentioned.Though I did bake for slightly longer about 45 minutes but that's just my oven. The brownies came out dense and super moist, the glaze was another level of perfection. Thank you STARFLOWER for this super star recipe!!

Let me start by saying that I do not generally like sweet potatoes or yams, but I had some come in my CSA box that I needed to use.  I looked for a recipe that was different and found this one.  I just pulled them out of the oven, and they are amazing.  I only had 2 eggs, so I added to egg shells worth of water to the recipe to make up for the lack.  I was going to put the glaze on, but honestly, they don't need it.  I think it would be way to sweet for me if I did add it.  I definitely recommend making these.  Especially if you don't like yams. :)

GREAT!  All the positive things others have noted! Thank you everyone for suggestions to reduce sugars and to  add cinnamon and nutmeg! I reduced sugars to 3/4 cups each and a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of nutmeg. My non-yam eating family members LOVED it! Yay!

These were pretty yummy and I don't think anyone guessed they were made of yams! With all the sugar and butter though I'm not sure these count as "healthy". Not a personal favorite, but a big hit at the office for non-chocolate people.

Very creative use of yams! I bought some beautiful yams at a farmers market only to find out after they were cooked and peeled they were not a pretty orange but quickly oxidizing to a gray/green. Yuck. This recipe saved the yams from rejection. I had 3-4 cups yams; so I added an egg, baking powder and mashed the yam completely smooth and I only had whole wheat flour. I skipped the sugary drizzle on top. It is fluffy and moist and NOT grey/green. Lovely creative recipe. Thanks!

For starters, I am the only one in my family of 7 who likes sweet potatoes, so when I was given several of them I looked for a recipe that I thought would satisfy my family. I followed the recipe exactly and I loved them. My kids saw the pieces of sweet potatoes in them and wouldn't eat them. My husband said they were "ok". I took most of them to a friends family, who I knew woud eat them. Bummer that my family didn't like them, but I thought they were so yummy!

Followed the recipe and definitely had no problems with it staying moist. In fact- they were straight up SOGGY! Had to eat them with a fork, they were definitely not brownie-like in texture! Still give them a high score because they tasted AMAZING and I would totally make them again. Maybe I'll decrease the eggs like others did, add a little more flour and shred the yams finer to see if that helps.

Amazing! I was sort of concerned about shredding the yam, but using the fine side of the grater it takes maybe 5 minutes, maybe. Off of other peoples recommendations I completely cut out the white sugar and only used the brown and it was still sweet enough. I did add extra flour (3 Tablespoons)  since I am high elevation and that seemed to help. I made this twice in one week for a group of friends and gave the recipe out to those I made them for. Fantastic!

Absolutely delicious!! I just made these, and I'm trying not to go get another one! Very moist, which I love, but won't stay stiff enough for me to get out of the pan in one piece. I'm going to see if it stays together after it cools all the way. Next time I may add an extra 1/4 of flour. I added 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the batter, and that really rocked it out. I can't wait to make these during the Thanksgiving holidays. I did have to bake it for an extra 8 minutes. The recipe was simple, and the hardest part was grating the sweet potato, because peeling and grating took 10 or 15 minutes.

I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because I made some changes. I followed most of the other reviewers and cut the sugar down. I used 2/3 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brpwn sugar. I added a good heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and then substituted orange juice for the milk in the glaze. They turned out delicious. I really wouldn't call them brownies, it seems more of a sheet cake style cake to me but I will definitely be making them again, they were a hit with the whole family.

Delicious! Everyone liked. I used whole wheat flour, added 1 tsp. cinnamon. I reduced the white and brown sugar amounts to 3/4 cup each in the mix, and found that plenty sweet. I also used 1/2 cup butter, and replaced the other 1/2 cup with applesauce.

WOW!!!    These were so different and just plain delicious.   More of a super moist bar texture (like a lemon bar) than a brownie (cake texture).   I loved the  unique flavor of yams in this dessert.   I shredded on my finest grater setting and put them in raw and there was no evidence of "yam shreds" in the final product even though the batter was very lumpy.   2 cups of sugars did seem like a lot to me as well.  I cut the white and brown down to 3/4 c. each and it was still plenty sweet.   Don't skip the glaze!   These are a keeper!!!

My husband couldn't stay of these so I know he really liked them! Everyone thought it was carrot cake at first until I told them different.I tried to make them a little more healthy so I used just 1 stick of butter and subbed the rest with applesauce.I also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg for extra flavor.I used my cheese grater to shred the sweet potatoes  but next time I may try using cooked mashed ones to save a little time.

I really enjoyed these and so did everyone I shared them with, they are a nice subtle sweet and unique flavour. I served them with vanilla ice cream and some caramel sauce :)

I made a few changes in lower the calories and increase the health benefits. I switched out 1/2 cup of butter for applesauce, used eight egg whites instead of 4 eggs, added 2 tablespoons of ground flax, 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp ground ginger. I did not cook the yams, simply peeled and shredded them on my grater. I also did not add the glaze and they came out sweet enough!  Next time I may follow another user's suggestion of adding raisins! Thank you for the fabulous recipe.

These are amazing. I did not cook my sweet potatoe before shredding (as so many recommend).  I only added 3/4 C of each sugar, 3 eggs and 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Everything else I kept the same.  They are so moist. My husband said they are the best thing I've ever made, and took them to work. All the guys are asking me to make more. This recipe goes to the front of my dessert folder.

This is very sweet, especially with the icing but sooooo very yummy.  I added some mace, allspice, cinnamon, ginger, clove, and a touch of nutmeg to it.  The spices really added to the flavor.  I used about a 1/4 teaspoon of each and a pinch of nutmeg, I also used 3 cups of sweet potato instead of 2.  It came out very moist!  I personally prefer it served warm with a cup of coffee.  Next time I will use less sugar and make it for a brunch.  The recipe worked perfect at 6100 ft above sea level, not sure if it will need modification at higher elevations

These brownies were quite tasty!  We followed the recipe exactly, but didn't use the glaze because there were plenty sweet on their own.  They were a bit oily for us, so I might cut back on the butter next time.  My daughter couldn't wait to feed them to her dad to secretly get some vegetables into his diet :)

Loved this recipe the first time I made it for Thanksgiving; the kids couldn't stop eating them. Second time I cut back on the white sugar, skipped the icing, and added dark chocolate chunks. Still had the sweetness, and the flavors mixed wonderfully. Again, the kids couldn't stop eating them!

These were out-of-this-world. We could not stop eating them. As another reviewer suggested, we reduced the sugar and brown sugar to 3/4 cups each and that was plenty. We also added about a tsp of cinnamon and ginger. Amazing.

My mother gave me 3 good-sized, fresh sweet potatoes last month and I decided to look on this website for interesting recipes other than cooking the yams in the microwave. I came across this brownie receipe and immediately made it. THE BROWNIES WERE FANTASTIC! I shared them with about a dozen people and everyone loved them. But I wonder if you can use carrots instead of yams and I also wonder if you can use yams in carrot cake? I bet you could. . . .  By the way, I never make the glaze as the brownies are sweet enough.

These were very good, but also VERY sweet. I would very careful with the glaze - I ended up scraping it off (as much as I could,) but I can't deny that they were a total hit.

OH MY GOODNESS! this is SOOOO yummy. I made some moderations, however. I cut the sugar in half, used wheat flour instead of white and used smart balance butter instead of the fatty kind.  Delicious.  The kids will love it. I also omitted the glaze. It's perfectly sweet without it.

I was disappointed in these.  I thought is was going to be more like a blonde brownie.  It was more of a cake.  The flavor was good but not what I expected.

This was so delicious!  My boyfriend loves brownies and I wanted to try something besides the plain old fudge ones.  This, while not a brownie in the classical sense, did not disappoint!  Yes, it is really sweet, but it's a dessert!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very soft (not mushy) and cake-like.  I added white chocolate chips as well, since my BF is a white chocolate fiend.  The 9x13 pan is a must in order to allow the batter to bake evenly and it browned up wonderfully in my gas range.  Wonderful recipe and yummy flavor!  We'll definitely be making this again.  :)  Thanks, Starflower!

Based on other reviews I cut the sugars by half and indeed it was still sweet enough. Otherwise the first time I made these I followed the recipe as is and really enjoyed it. The second time I added cinnamon, ginger, raisins and walnuts. That was good too. Moves it into the 'carrot cake' realm.

crazy good! you can reduce the fat content without reducing taste in fact I would think that the am't of butter would make these a little greasy as these are super moist with about half the fat. I used whole wheat flour for these as well. Everyone that had them has either asked me to make more or give them the recipe. If you are wanting something decadent without the high calories...these are it!

Amazing flavor, and very moist, but also VERY greasy.   Also very sweet.  If I make these again, I will definitely not add the glaze because they are sweet enough without the glaze.  I may just put a light dusting of power sugar on top.

Super yummy! Best when warm and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Next time we are going to use a cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze.

I loved the flavor and the yams, but I should have baked it about another 10 minutes.  It was just a little too moist. We're making this again tomorrow!

My hubs made these and they were really good. I wish there was a half star option because I'd like to give this 4 and a half stars. Very moist very flavorful, just not quite the "brownie" texture I was expecting. But definitely a recipe worth making!

Very good. I too sent home the recipe with several people. I halved the sugar's and it was still very sweet. I think next time I'll use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce.

I thought these were good.  They were mushy though. I think I needed to cook them longer. I had a clean toothpick at 25 minutes, but I guess I should've let them go the full 30. I did used fresh yams. The flavor was great, but I need to make these again to see if they turn out better when cooked for the full amount of time.

I don't know what I did wrong but I tried to make these twice and both times they came out super squishy in the middle even though I baked it for longer after the toothpick test. I did use a quarter cup less of each sugar and a little less butter the second time but still came out the same way. They still had a fantastic taste and everyone said they loved them that way...i dunno, i'll keep trying!

Oh, these are the most yummy treats! My 13 year old son who won't touch a yam loved these but didn't like the name so he's decided they are "Heavenly Brownies". I took them to work and they were an instant hit. The only thing that was said was that they are a bit too sweet and I had cut the recipe to 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of white sugar.  I took one of the previous suggestions and  microwaved a couple of yams and then placed them in a "bullet" to smooth along with one of the 4 eggs. It made a nice creamy texture and I believe helped to keep the brownies moist. The next time I make these sinful treats I will use 1/2 a cup of each and see how that works. I will also add some shredded yams and walnuts for texture. I think whatever may be added will only enhance the tasted of these treats!

This recipe is unbelievably good!  As another option to a regular baked potato, we will bake sweet potatoes for dinner from time to time.  My children don't usually enjoy this change of pace, unfortunately.  Thus, we are unsuccessful in getting them to eat regular baked sweet potatoes/yams.  Unless we are willing to smoother the yams in butter, brown sugar, and marshmallows, they refuse to eat them.  I had some left over baked sweet potatoes that I was hoping to find a recipe that my children will eat.  I came across this recipe, and I'm so happy that I did!  They are so very delicious.  Granted, the health value of these brownies may not be as high as I'd like them to be due to the amount of sugar and butter used.  But, I will definitely make this recipe again, and next time use some of the healthier alternative ingredients other reviewers have suggested and see how they compare.  In any case, my kids LOVE these and don't even know that sweet potatoes are in them.  It's great!

I wish we could give you more stars. this was easy, and yummy. I used canned sweet potatoes but will use real ones next time. I used all ingredients except vanilla extract. this was sooo good. I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and white sugar, along with everything else -- baked at 350 degrees. Didn't use the glaze because you didn't need this. I cannot believe they are this good and will use this again. thanks!

WOW.  This would get 10 stars if possible.  I didn't add the white sugar, as some of the other reviewers suggested.  And rather than brownies, I made them into muffins.  Unbelievable!  I thought they would be good, but not this good.  They're almost lethal!

"Yam bread" was loved by the adults and this "cake with frosting" was especially loved by a picky 3 year old and a super duper picky 6 yr old who requested a second slice!!  I used my toaster over so had to go with a 7x11 sized pan and baked it covered in foil at 325 for 45 minutes. I uncovered it and lowered the temperature to 200 until the center was finally done (also, when the top was nicely browned, I recovered it to prevent further browning).  I added 1.5 tablespoons of cinnamon and decreased both sugars to 3/4 cups (still very sweet!).  Since my slices were thicker, the brownie was more bread-like yet unbelievably moist.  Definitely a KEEPER!

These were amazing. I did reduce both the brown sugar and the white sugar after reading other reviews, and I think that they were still sweet enough. These were very easy to make, and I will surely be making these again sometime soon.

These are fantastically moist and flavorful. They were easy to make and the frosting seals the deal. I followed the recipe exactly and don't really see any reason to change it:D

AWESOME! These are melt in your mouth moist and wonderful. But I think brownies is misleading, it's much more like cake. The glaze really makes this recipe too.

I have been intrigued by this recipe since I came acrossed it a few days ago.  I finally got out to get the yams in order to make it.  I altered the recipe to make it a bit healthier, used apple sauce for the butter, halved the white sugar, and used 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites.  After I had already shredded a yam I realized I had drank the last of my milk so I couldn't make the glaze as noted.  I did have a can of sweetened condensed milk (fat free) in the cupboard so I used a few table spoons of that to glaze it.  I also liked the idea someone had of adding some cinnamon and ginger so I did.  It smells and tastes a little like carrot cake.  The end result is a little bit sticky but it is really quite tastey.  Will definitely make it again.  My end result, with the glaze, is about 110 calories per piece.

With a recipe this unique sounding, and with this many rave reviews, I had to try it. I made it exactly as written, and: YUM! Soooo good--kind of a pudding/cake/brownie fusion, with an original and fantastic flavor. Next time (there WILL be a next time!) I might try reducing the sugar a bit and perhaps throwing in some extras--but the recipe followed word for word is super delicious.

I made these into breakfast muffins! I substituted 1 cup applesauce for all the butter and only used the brown sugar as suggested by another review. Added cinn/sugar coated walnuts and raisins and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before baking. Baked for about 25 minutes on convection. YUM.

Really, really good. My husband and I are both on a diet, and I screwed up by baking it in a smaller pan (i.e. throwing off the calorie count) but they are delicious. Even my roommate (who isn't into health food) thought they were pretty darn good.

This is a terrific recipe.   They were really pretty tummy and exciting to make. A hit with my friends, they were gone within twenty minutes after they cooled down.   My only qualm: I didn't think they tasted yammy enough.  Perhaps they didn't because I added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I would totally make these again and probably experiment a little more: try to make them denser brownies, perhaps with more eggs and yam (or sweet potato); add chocolate chips or coconut flakes; add raisins and nuts.  :)

I loved these! I did make a few changes that you may want to try. I added raisins to the batter. I also added a little bit of almond extract,cinnamon,allspice and nutmeg to the glaze. It was really good with the spiced glaze. Thanks for anther wonder recipe!

These were very good, but they just tasted like a sweet potato casserole to me. I used canned yams because I did not have any fresh ones, and I think that made the brownies too moist, even with omitting 1/4C of butter. I also left out an egg based on other reviews. I might try these again with some other variations.

Not bad,  wish they had more flavor.  I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter and also added about 1/4 tsp to the glaze.  Next time I will add either raisins, dates, pineapple or maybe craisins to liven it up a bit.  Very good texture and moist.

Soooo yummy!  I used 3/4 c white sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar and it was PLENTY sweet. I used an extra 3/4 c of yams because I had them.  The recipe made 12 muffins (filled the muffin cups all the way).  I baked the muffins for about 25 minutes and they were perfect.  Definitely a new favorite.

Yummy, awesome, all that! I used slightly less butter and white sugar, because all the reviews said it was too sweet as written. But I think the full measure wouldn't hurt, it wasn't too sweet to me at all.  I will continue to make this for friends and family.  It's different and very tasty.

If you love sweet potatoes, this is a must-make recipe! I tried it and my whole family went crazy over it! I omitted the white sugar and it was by far sweet enough, and added cinnamon. Now, I get a request to make it for every family get-together!!! :) Awesome dessert

These were delish and are my husband's new favorite. I was a little hesitant adding the shredded yams because there appeared to be too much moisture but these turned out perfect and moist.  Will make again and again! I may cut down the sugar next time though...

Pretty tasty.  A bit sweet, but keeps me from eating more than one piece.  It was hard to cut & dish out because it was loose and fluffy.

I call these Golden YUUUUUUUUUUUUUM Brownies!!!! My kids call them Heaven on Earth! I was in a hurry so I did change one thing and I do not know if my texture was normal. I used Simply Potatoes(in the refrig section) Sweet Potatoes. They were super moist and super YUMMY!

Very good!  I only used 1/2 c. butter instead of 1 c. and omitted the 1 c. white sugar.  I thought it tasted just fine with these cutbacks.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so I could stand to cut back on the sugar even more, since the glaze was pretty sweet.

Loved it...I was a little adventurous and used purple yams (Chinatown) I liked them better once they were cold, it gave it that nice density it was missing.  Next time I make this I think I will fold half of the grated yams and beat half in so it releases some color into the batter.

This recipe was incredible! I loved it, the family loved it! We're going to be making more very soon [tomorrow!]. They only changes made was that we did not put the glaze on the top, and we found it sweet enough. We topped it instead with Hogendas's Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.

Made some changes to create a healthier version: only 1/2 cup white sugar, substituted all whole wheat flour, used 2 cups of mashed sweet potato and 1 shredded medium carrot, only 3 eggs, used 3/4 cup Smart Balance instead of butter, added 2 tsp. cinnamon and 2 tbsp. toasted wheat germ, left off icing but sprinkled with sifted powdered sugar...if the 9x13 dish is cut into 30 squares, each is only 40 calories!perfect consistency and sweetness...I will try warming them up and serving with whipped cream!

I'm giving it a 3 simply because it is way to sweet, and makes ALOT!!! I followed the recipe however I used 1 3/4 cups pureed yams because I already had it on hand. I will try it again however I will use half the sugar and half the recipe as it made way to much. My 9x13 pan was full. It also took twice the time indicated. It is a great idea though but I will make changes to it and adjust it to our taste. thanks for sharing.

I made these "Yammies" Thanksgiving and had to make it again the day after.  I took advice of others and used canned yams and cut the eggs by one.  Very delicious- I already have request from my family to make more and everyone wants the recipe.

these were really excellent! didn't use the glaze since they were already so sweet and moist. took advice of another reviewer and cooked the yams in the microwave, skinned, then pureed in the food processor.

i also added a handful of chopped pecans. MMMMM!!!

thanks for sharing

I don't do much baking but this was a great recipe, and had a wonderful flavor, very easy to make.  My family loves sweet potatoes, in VA we eat it every way possible.  This was a fresh spin on both brownies and sweet potatoes. My mom loved it, and asked for the recipe to make it for church functions.  Thanks for the recipe,I loved the glaze, and will definitely make it again because it disappeared quickly.  I come from a family where everybody is a great cook and it was nice to have the family eat something they've never had and ask for the recipe, and pat ME on the back ask about the ingredients.

I think a lot of people are making unecessary work for themselves by baking the yams first. There is no need! Peel and finely grate the raw yams, then add as recipe states. I also omitted the glaze and opted for a light whipped cream topping. It was a big hit at my husband's office!

This was REALLY yummy! I took another reviewers suggestion and used a medium size can of yams and it turned out great. It just took another 10 minutes to get it baked all the way through.

I was pleasantly surprised by how these tasted! Even my husband grudgingly agreed that these were delicious. I would have to agree with other reviewers that these are more of a "bar" than "brownie". I also decreased the butter to 3/4 cup, only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and kept the brown sugar at a cup, and used only 3 eggs. I didn't use the glaze since I found that it was quite sweet. I will be making these again and perhaps even decrease the amount of sugar to just a cup.

well...they're.......definately something different.  the dough part turned out to be a nice cake and i was surprised because there was no liquid besides the eggs.  i used okinawan sweet potatoes (purple) and probably should have finely grated instead of the regular size grate - they were too firm.  my glaze didn't liquefy so i smeared it on when the brownie was piping hot and had to mash down the sugar lumps.  i will send it to the firehouse w/my hubby and they will gobble it down!  i might try this again with a yam - maybe during thanksgiving for something different.  thanks for sharing - appreciate it.  if my thanksgiving yam brownie turns out better - i will come back and do another review.  it would have been 3 stars if i didn't use the purple potato but for now - 4 stars, sorry!

This was definitely a unique recipe and I loved these!! I used purple yams instead though, but only because that was what I just happened to have. I would also say that the texture was more cake-like than brownie-like. They were heavenly soft and had a fabulous aroma and taste. However, I found them a little too sweet (and I didn't even make the frosting) and will reduce the sugar next time.

These were good, but mine turned out awfully wet.  From the other reviews I read I think the results on these are going to vary quite a bit depending on the amount of moisture in the yams and flour you use.  Cooks beware and use your experience and judgement to decide if you need to add a little more flour to get the consistency you desire. They didn't have the chewy texture I like in a brownie either.  They really reminded me of Texas Sheetcake, (which some people do think of as brownies, so it is quite subjective.)  You could try reducing the eggs to 2 and using all brown sugar.  It might be chewier then and have a little more "butterscotch" versus pure "yam" flavor.  They do taste good, but I was hoping this would be the yam recipe to die for.  It wasn't, but it was a fine recipe, just not what I was expecting in a "brownie."

Pretty good- husband, mom and daughter liked them.  They were good to give to my toddler because they weren't too sweet and they had some veggies in them!  Thanks for a recipe that -as a mom- doesn't make me cringe when she asks for them!

I made this recipe with the kiddos at school and they absolutely loved them!  The custodians came by to see what smelled so yummy.  Everyone that tried them raved about how moist they were! They are best eaten while warm.

I cooked this using pumpkin but I used splenda and it was too sweet (my fault, I should've known!) This was still was good and I will make it again. Next time I'll try 3/4 c of the sugars and add a few hands full of chocolate chips.

A good, sweet blond brownie.  If anything, it was too sweet because the granulated sugar overpowered the low note natural sweetness of the yam.

It was carrot cake without the cinnamon.  Yummy and delicious.  Many people were astounded that it was not as sweet as it looked.  This made the dessert perfect.

These were so good, I ate 3/4 of the pan by myself in less than 24 hours! I could not figure out if I should of cooked the yams first or not. So I microwaved them and then just mashed them up (as I could not figure out how to shred a hot yam!).
Also, would be really really good with a cream cheese frosting.

I have to agree with others in the name. They were very easy to make. The taste was sort of bland but not bad. I followed the recipe to the tee. Very moist. I would make again ,maybe put a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg.
