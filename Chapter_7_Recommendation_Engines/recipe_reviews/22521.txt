Oh my gosh!!  This was incredible.  I was craving a stick-to-your-ribs comfort food, and this fit the bill.  I used a package of chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, 1/3 Cup frozen corn, and roughly the same amount of chopped carrots and celery.  Did add about 2 tsp cornstarch to the half&half before adding it, and followed the Bisquick box directions for dumplings.  Perfection!  Licking our chops still!  Thank you for the great recipe!

I left out the canned corn and used 2C lowfat milk rather than 3C half and half.  Delicious!  I also used a small can (one of those 4-packs) of biscuit dough, each cut into quarters, instead of the biscuit mix.  To thicken the soup, I added 1T cornstarch mixed with 2T water.  A warm, hearty meal.

This recipe is sooooo good!  I made it exactly the way the recipe says, except that I used milk instead of half and half.  I couldn't believe how yummy this meal turned out to be!  Can't wait to make it again!

It's good, but several changes needed: The dumplings need more mix to cause the batter to be the proper thickness called for in the recipe.  I only used one potato and left out the corn.  As a southern-bred person, add anything else besides the chicken and dumplings and we called it stew!

This was very good. I added garlic, carrot, celery and frozen corn instead of canned. Next time I make I will double the bacon. I used Bisquick so I had to change the measurments in regard to the mix/milk amounts.

Overall, this is a great tasting recipe.  A definite keeper, and I can't say that about too many recipes I try the first time. I cut the poultry seasoning down to 3/4 tsp. and it still tasted very good.  I would cut the dumpling mixture in half next time though, because it was way too much and tended to soak up a lot of the sauce mixture.  My whole family liked it though~even my kids ate it!

DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!  I used 1 1/2 cup of milk and 1 1/2 cup half and half and followed the directions on the Bisquick box as other reviews suggested.  This is an awesome recipe!  Everyone in my family  had seconds!  WOW

I liked it but need to change it before I fix it again.  I thought there was too much liquid (half-n-half).  It was more like a soup then what I know of as a chicken and dumpling dish.

This was very tasty.  I used pre-cooked, pre-crumbled bacon and hash browns, and added celery.
I made my dumplings out of flour and eggs.

Fantastic, a few minor adjustments, instead of the half and half I used two cans of cream of chicken soup, 3 T of corn starch with 6 T of ice water to thicken it and my own dumplings...2 C. Flour, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 T of softened salted butter, 4 tsp baking soda and 2/3 cup of milk...a dash of garlic powder and a sprinkle of parsley....good to go!!  Also doubled the chicken stock which I made from scratch!

This is one of my family's fav meals. We love this! I cook this in the slow cooker, cooking up the bacon, then sauteeing the onions in the  leftover grease, and browning the edges of my frozen chx breasts in it, too. 
I use more bacon, don't peel the potatoes, use frozen corn, add some garlic and celery, and cook it all together all day long, then add the dumplings at the end, after I shred the chx. After I put the dumplings in, I turn the CP up to high and let it cook about 30 min.
*today, I didn't have half/half, so I just put in 8oz cream cheese with 2c whole milk. worked out fine*
 Perfect! My kids are both on their 3rd bowls as I'm typing.

The recipe needs some help. Carrots, celery, peas would make a good addition, and leave out the corn. It's not needed with the carbs in the dumplings and potatoes, and really doesn't add any flavor. So many said this was time consuming to make. It isn't. Not sure why people think it's time consuming. Sure, it's not "open a can of soup, and a can of this" and call it dinner, but then that isn't "cooking" either. That is mixing.

why would you use potatoes when you are making dumplings?? Too much starch. I would add veggies-carrots, stringbeans etc

I just finished this and it's pretty good, but I feel like it needs something.  I did add a clove of garlic and I used skim milk iand some cornstarch thickening, instead of 1/2 and 1/2 both beause I didn't want the calories and I didn't have any.  I also had some extra rosemary during the boiling phase, but removed the sprig after.  I just feel like it needs some more seasoning, but I'm not sure what. Used a double recipe of bisquick dumplings. My very picky 15 year old son liked it.  I tried a bit of it without dumplings and with saltines instead and it was better, so maybe more salt?   I'm sure I'll try it again, we'll see what my husband thinks later.

Turned out fantastic! I had to use up the remains of a chicken I had cooked for supper the day before, so I used the bones to make the broth,(used 5 cups broth) and remains of the meat instead of chicken breast.  I also used 5 slices bacon and increased the potatoes to 6 instead of three.  Instead of half and half I only had homo milk, so, as another reviewer suggested, I used a tbsp of cornstarch mixed with a bit of cold water to thicken it up.  
Turned out fantastic and was even better the next day for lunch.

This dish tasted great. It was not as thin as I expected. Next time I will add about 1/2 cup of white wine and dilute the half and half with milk. My family was very pleased with this comfort food.

This is a great recipe. Everyone I've made it for loves it and requests it often. We did make a few additions and changes after reading other reviews. I throw in chopped carrots and celery, both roughly equal to the corn. I use milk instead of half and half. I also use extra bacon. And since there never seem to be enough dumplings, I use 2 cans of the refrigerator biscuits cut into quarters. Just throw them in at the same point that the recipe says but you don't have to cook them as long. We've also used canned chicken which cut the cook time a bit. The thing to remember with this recipe is its really tough to mess up. We always make more than the recipe above states so we just kinda mix it together until it looks good. :)

This is more of a twist on potatoe soup.  The poultry seasoning is a strong spice be careful.  I found that the soup was much better after it had been reheated.  I save empty sauce jars and store left over broth, soups, sauces in them. If your left overs are hot enough the jars actually seal.

To compensate feeling guilty for the bacon, i added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables instead of the corn. i prefer my own dumpling recipe but these were ok. and you can NEVER go wrong with a recipe that includes bacon! Enjoy!

I am kind of torn between 3 and 4 stars. I think this recipe is a really good base, but I did change some things after making it once. The soup doesn’t have much flavor, so when we made it the second time, we used almost twice the bacon and cut back a bit on the potatoes. We also put in some garlic with the potatoes and onions. We thought that the cubed potatoes were a little much, so we coarsely shredded them instead.  The first time we used some frozen bread dough we had at home and the dumplings turned out great. The next time we used the biscuit dough like the recipe recommended and they didn’t seem to ever cook all the way through even through we let them simmer for longer than recommended. So I guess next time, we will probably use more bacon, add some garlic, shred the potatoes and use bread dough instead of biscuit dough.

I did use a deep skillet and it was definitely not big enough. I had to switch to a 3.5qt pot and it's still overflowing!!! After making it I will say that it was very tasty. I did add an extra bullion cube for flavour. I didn't use Bisquick but one found from this site cut back to 4 servings (instead of 48!!). It was tasty and we will use it again.

This was pretty good! It was a little bland, definitely missing some seasoning but good enough that I'll keep toying with it until it's perfect. Thanks!

I give this recipe a good, solid 4.5 rating.  First, it wasn't the prettiest of all soups to look at but that isn't really a big deal.  I really did enjoy the flavors and it had everything I love - bacon (YES!!!!), dumplings (hooray for carbs) and taters (hooray for even more carbs).  After tasting the broth though, I did add in alot more flavors to the mix because it was coming off a little bland to me, so I threw in some white pepper, alot of garlic and a bit of celery seed.  This is a good, hearty stick to your ribs soup and a little goes a loooonnnnggg way.  I made it for a group of friends, and they all agreed it was tasty.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

The prep time might be on, but the cooking time alone is 20 more minutes than labeled. The smell was great until the half and half was added. Boiling while adding the dumplings caused the bottom to burn, then the dumplings did nothing but fall apart in the soup: ruining the 70 minutes it took to put together. I also understand that bacon grease goes a long way, but I would probably find some sneaky way to put in more bacon. There's only a couple strips for a soup with 6 cups of liquid? I'm the kind of person that likes a bite of everything in every bite! The final flavor wasn't as awesome as I was lead to believe by comments but to each his own.  Directions could have been clearer. Back to the grocery store.

I made this with a few exceptions (of course) I added frozen mixed vegetables (it was all I had) No onions (because of our cats) and I forgot to add the half-half. Still tasted awesome. If I added the half-half, it would have tasted just like corn chowder. Still either way, a definite keeper. Thank you for the recipe!

I used the bacon grease, but left out the bacon (I think it would have been too much bacon flavor for us) and I left out the corn but added carrots instead. It was super tasty.

I loved this recipe. I only give this particular recipe 4 starts, because I made a lot of changes. I halved the recipe, left out the corn, and used equal parts of 1% milk and half-and-half. I also added a cup of chopped fresh mushrooms, and cut up the meat from half a rotisserie chicken. Rather than stirring in the crumbled bacon, I sprinkled it on top of each serving before it was devoured! I love this recipe because it's like a stew and a soup. Too thin to be a stew, but too thick to be a soup. I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe....  the bacon added a lot of flavor!  I was a little worried that the mixture wasn't going to thicken, but sure enough, after adding the dumplings and simmering, it turned out great!

REALLY YUMMY! mY HUSBAND AND I LOVED IT. I DIDNT HAVE ANY HALF AND KALF ON HAND NOR BUSCUIT MIX. SO I MADE MY OWN BUSCUIT MIX WHICH CALLED FOR 2 CUPS FLOUR, 1 TSP SALT,1/4 CUP HOT WATER, 3 TBS SHORTENING. I ALSO ADDED MORE MILK TO THE MIX. I MADE MY HALF AND HALF WITH ONE TBS OF BUTTER AND ALMOST 1 CUP OF MILK. I ALSO ADDED MORE PEPPER, POULTRY SEASONING, AND SALT.

This is a very tasty recipe; however, in regards to the dumplings, DO NOT USE THE AMOUNTS CALLED FOR!  It creates a batter rather than the sticky dough needed to make a traditional dumpling.  Follow the instructions on the box of biscuit mix and they'll come out perfectly.

This was a good, easy and basic recipe to follow.  Very bland so be prepared to spice it up to your taste.  I rated this 4 stars because it did not include cream of chicken/mushroom soup and is a great base for you to build your own recipe.  Next time I will use condensed milk or 2% rather than half-and-half to cut on calories/cholesterol/fat.    You could also easily add more liquid to the recipe to inculde more veggies - celery, peas, etc...would work well.  **UPDATE**  18 Oct 09.  I made this again and it was delicious.  I used 2% milk, and added a ton of veggies that needed to be used.  I added baby carrots with the potatoes and onions.  After simmering but before adding the dumplings, I added frozen peas and corn, fresh zucchini, celery and cauliflower.  I then added and cooked the dumplings and it was much more robust and healthier version than the original.  Also - I flavored the dumpling mix with various spices.  It was a hit with my husband and his mother (gasp!).

This was a huge hit in my house.  Only modification I made was I used six pieces of bacon and only because I wanted to finish off what I had on hand.  Other than that I followed the recipe how it is written, including not changing the liquid portion and it came out perfect!  Really warmed the belly on a cold Minnesota night.  Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful, especially with a few modifications.  Used 1/2 lb of diced bacon and used chopped celery and carrots instead of the corn.  However, if you use Bisquick for the dumplings, be careful, the recipe on the box would translate to requiring closer to 1/2 a cup of milk (rather than a full cup) in order to come up with the right consistency of dough. 

Next time I’ll probably use closer to 2 cups chicken broth and 2 cups half-and-half.  It was very soupy, but delicious anyway.

Terrific Chicken & dumpling recipe! Thick & creamy and dumplings delicious! I did substitute celery & baby Carrots for corn as I thought it would be starchy enough with dumplings & potatoes. Excellent Recipe and my whole family raved about it! One bowl guaranteed to fill your tummy! Good Comfort Food for a cold day!

Really don't understand the great reviews on this one!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls and it was just plain boring.   This recipe makes a huge pot of soup/stew and 3 strips of bacon and a tsp of seasoning is not enough flavoring to put a dent in this volume of stuff.   Without some sort of thickening agent, it will look like biscuits floating in milk.  Everyone at my house tried it and then passed on it.   And if you don't eat it right away, the biscuits swell and get really mushy.   It was a mess after just a couple of hours.   I threw this one out.

Delicious. I used fat free half and half and it was still amazing. We all have nasty colds right now and this was definitely comfort food. Delicious. (Next time I will half the dumpling mixture as there was way more than would fit in the top of the soup pot.)

Great recipe!!  I've made this several times now and everybody loves it.  It's a little time consuming but worth it.  It's also a very 'forgiving' recipe,,,,I've had to substitute ingredients because I didn't have one or the other when I started the prep.  No problem.  I've used canned potatoes (not quite as good as the fresh), canned chicken breast with store bought broth (again, not quite as good), frozen corn (no diff), canned biscuits (no diff).

I cheated with canned chicken and bacon bits, but my family LOVED it!  My boys fought over the last bowlful with the loser shouting "Meanie!" at the winner.  My husband says the bacon really adds something to the flavor.  Just hearing that I'm making it makes all three of them excited!

The amount of liquid that is used is way off.  It was more like a soup!  I don't think the recipe needs potatoes and dumplings.  I used only 2 cups 1/2 & 1/2 and it was still very watery.  I finally used a can of cream of chicken soup to thicken it.  Probably will not make it again.

My kids love bacon, so I knew they would enjoy this for dinner.  It was easy to make, and we all loved it!

I just love this recipe. You can do so many different thing with it. I use half a pack of bacon, carrots, mushrooms, corn, celery, broccoli and beans. When i add the chicken broth I also add two cans of campbells garlic and muchroom soup.  It is our favourite around and it always gets eaten the day I make it.

It made this lastnight and I am already thinking about having it for breakfast!  I followed the recipe pretty close except I used biscuits from a can.  They puffed up twice the size I cut them. I also added a teaspoon of cornstarch and flour to thicken the sauce.  My husband and I give it two thumbs up!

Yummy!  I had to use more Bisquick than the recipe called for.  I referred to the measurements listed on the box for dumplings.  Next time I'll use broth instead of the milk so they have more flavor.  I only cooked the dumplings for 12 minutes, covered, and they were all perfectly done.  I'll also not sautee as long since the potatoes did most of its cooking in the broth.  Oh, I used 5 strips of bacon instead of 3.

Not bad, but really not inspiring.  Sorry.  Kids didn't like it so I can't use it.  Also, really too WHITE.  Chicken breast, cream, potatoes and dumplings - not visually appealing.

We really enjoyed this. Thick & creamy and chock full of chicken, potatoes, & dumplings. (I reduced the amount of half & half to 2-3/4 cups) We ususally prefer the flat kind of dumplings, but these "bread" ones were great in this recipe.

I Love making this recipe with BISQUICK GLUTEN-FREE! It's is really awesome & tastes great too. For those who either have Ceiliac's or are Gluten or Wheat sensative it is a good alternative and comes with many suggestions & a website to go to to find even more. However, if you are like me and have lived with the disease for an extended amount of time then you may happen to know how to convert Gluten containing Recipies into non-GLUTEN RECIPIES & STILL HAVE THEM TASTE AS GOOD. ;) ;)

First time, made as written.  Felt it needed to be jazzed up a bit. Therefore, I didn't want to rate it according to the changes I made. Good base recipe but changes such as garlic, more vegetables, and more seasonings helped a great deal.

This was pretty good but I need to clarfy some stuff.

Listen to the bisquik box, not the recipe here!! 1 cup of milk to 1.5 cups baking mix will give you soup.  

3 slices of bacon is a little chinzy, we used 6 and could probably have used more. 

We didn't add the crumbled bacon until our own bowlfuls because we didn't want it soggy.  The crunchy bacon on top is much better

I think 2 C of the half and half would have sufficed, as 3 just seems like a little too much broth.  This can be helpful, however, if your making more dumplings!! 

The rest of it we followed exactly and it turned out quite nice.  Filling and comforting. Thanks for the great base recipe!

Pretty tasty - can't beat cream, carbs, and bacon in my opinion! I added garlic and cheddar cheese. However, I found it a bit heavy with both dumplings AND potatoes, so if I were to make this again I'd probably only choose one.

the only complaint i had about this was the "cook time". if you add up the time in the instructions it adds up to 50 minutes, not counting prep time. with two of us working on this it took almost 90 minutes to make. totally worth the wait though!

This was really tasty BUT it called for WAY too much milk if you're using "Bisquick" for the biscuits!  The batter was far too thin (soupy!) - I had to keep adding mix until it was the right consistency to drop dumplings on the stew.  With that problem solved, the family enjoyed this winter dish very much!

Kids and husband loved it. Used 1% milk instead of half and half. Omitted the corn. Used reduced fat Bisquick and 1% milk for the dumplings. Increased bacon and chicken broth amount.

I made this without variation for my first time. It was delicious!!! I will use a little cornstarch next time & the dumplings needed to cook a little longer than the 20 minutes. That may have been cause I made alot of dumplings! My 3 picky kids and my even pickier hubby all LOVED it!!!

HI ...  I noticed that some said that they thickened their 'soup' ... mine was so so so thick ... much more like a stew vs. a soup ... my dumplings were very large but were very yummy ... I had to add more broth because it was so overly thick ... the taste was outstanding ...

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was a big hit. I took suggestions for other reviewers, and used 2tsp cornstarch to thicken it a bit more, and I used pillsbury biscuits, cut into 1/4s. I used a whole can of buscuits, which was a bit much, but it still turned out well. Will make again.

This was very very bland.  Also, to follow this recipe as written, you must have a 30 inch skillet or something!  This makes a very large amount, and I had to transfer the ingredients into a large soup pot, and even then the dumplings were at the rim. Anyway, there are no seasonings (beyond the meager poultry seasoning) called for in this recipe.  We really had to add a lot of extras to add some taste.  (dill, garlic, & celery salt helped)

I thought this recipe had a great flavor and made plenty!  I did want it thick, not soupy, so I added the cornstarch/water mixture 2 times suggested by other reviewers.  I also added finely chopped carrots and exchanged the half-half for 1% milk.  It turned out great!  I made it with green bean bundles and my family really liked it!

Wow this was great.  I made it for the first chilly and rainy night of fall.  I did add some celery and carrots while I sauteed the onions and I followed the directions on the box of baking mix like others suggested.  My husband said it was a keeper and I actually had a bowl of it for breakfast the next day.

This tastes awesome!  It is not a traditional chicken and dumpling recipe...but don't be scared off by that...you should definitely try it! The only thing I did differently was that I added 2 tsp of cornstarch to my half and half before adding to the pot. I will definatley be making it again...maybe this time I'll add some carrots and/or celery. Oh, I also used bisquick for my dumplings and need more of the mix to thicken them up. The only thing that my husband had to say was that he thought it needed more chicken and more dumplings. Thanks for sharing this great recipe with us!!

My main concern is that the recipe states that cooking time is 30 min.  With simmering twice at 15 min each, then cooking the dumplings covered and uncovered at 10 min each, that's a total of 50 minutes even with everything pre-prepped (including bacon cooked and crumbled).  I'd say give it a good hour.  As for taste, it was ok - just needs to be tweeked a bit!  I reduced the amount of half and half to 2 cups, as others suggested, and also added a bit of cornstarch.  I used Jiffy biscuit mix and there were no directions for dumplings on the box, so I started out with a 1/2 cup milk, but had to add more.  I still don't think I got it right, as the dumplings never completely cooked thru on top (I ended up turning them over to finish cooking).  I would definitely add more bacon, and maybe some carrots and peas for color.  The dumplings need something as well...maybe some garlic powder or basil or whatever you would like to flavor your dumplings with!  By themselves I thought they were too bland.  I will most likely be making this again - just a little differently!  :)  Thanks!!

I just made this last night and hubby loved it. Changes I made...1/2 lb bacon, 1 stalk chopped celery, I used 3 leftover baked potatoes, fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 (only 2 cups),low fat biscuit mix with skim milk. Turned out great. We'll have this many times over the coming winter I'm sure.

This recipe needs some revisions. Based on reading the reviews I cut the chicken broth to 2 cups and the half & half to 2 cups and used bisquick according to package directions, and yet it was still too runny. It did taste good and my family liked it. I will make this again but with some of my own revisions, not sure what they will be yet.  This recipe will be a work in progress for the next couple of times. Thank you to Rebecca for posting this recipe and for all who post; I love this website!

This recipe was really good.  I, being new to the world of cooking, found it time consuming. Also, the directions on making the "dumplings" is very incorrect. It left a biscut like layer on top till I realized it needed to be real thick.  After adjusting, all went well. Thank You.

My husband and 15-month old son loved this dish. I, however, didn't scale the serving size down, and ended up making way too much (and didn't use a big enough pan). But all in all, it was very good. I'll make it again, for sure.

I would have preferred ham instead of the bacon.  It also came out way thinnner than I thought.  I would have preferred it a little thicker and creamier.  However, my husband had it left over the next day, and said it had thickened up a lot.

A wonderful and easy recipe. For my corn chowder style dishes I like to use this dumpling. 1-1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal, 1 Tablespoon (heaping) baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, 1-1/2 cup liquid of your choice (milk, half&half, soymilk, or even water) They compliment the corn chowder nicely.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Did a couple of tweaks. First as was suggested double the bacon and used a hardwood smoked bacon. Since we enjoy mushrooms added 9 medium mushrooms which I diced in with the fry pan with the onions.   Also after the chicken etc. had fried for a while I added frozen corn (do not keep canned here).  After adding the broth allowed it simmer for about 1 hour then added the milk.  Used 1 cup 35% cream (whipping cream) and 2 cups 2% milk.  Allowed to simmer again for about 1 hour.  When I brought to a boil added a mixture of cornstarch and water to thicken up (family preference) then added the dumplings.  Yummy meal will be making again.

Amazing dinner. The whole house loved it. I would have to say a couple tweaks to the recipe is needed. I find that it needs a little thickening (a little bit of cornstarch) and also I would put the chicken in about 7-10 into the cooking process of the potatoes and onions. Even with the fairly large cubes of chicken I was using, it was a little over done by the time everything else was done.

Would do this again in a heartbeat! I used rotisserie chicken, which usually adds that extra something special to soup, but this time I don't think I needed chicken at all. I also beefed up the veggies with some mushrooms and zucchini. Big hit!

It was good but makes a lot. I think it will serve more than 8 people. I used six slices of bacon as the three it called for did not render enough fat to cook in. Also had to change to a dutch oven as my pan was not large enough to hold the amount of ingredients. I used hominy instead of corn. It was good.

I made this for dinner last night and we loved it.  I did make a couple of changes.  I had some mushrooms on hand, so I added them. I also added some fresh chopped garlic to the onions and potatoes.  We aren't fans of corn, so I used frozen peas and fresh carrot's.  I was a little concerned about the amount of liquid and next time I would add a little flour to it to thicken because I found it a little too thin.  Overall it was very tasty.  I will be making it again.

Just not very good in my opinion.

 I did make a few changes:
*I used fresh garlic 
*I used shredded potatoes from the dairy section instead of pealing and dicing my own 
*I used triple the amount of bacon.

The soup before you add the dumpling is wonderful! However, after the dumplings are added it gets a texture that is almost grainy

Very tasty- would use less bacon next time. Added cumin and poultry seasonings. Used homemade biscuit recipe, and still very easy.

Corn in chicken and dumplings?? I was skeptical, but tried it anyway...actually very good!  I added a little celery and carrot to the veggies, and used half/half and milk instead of all half/half.  My husband and I really liked it, even though it is more like a stew than the chicken and dumplings we're used to.  The flavor is great, and it's very filling.  Thanks, Rebecca, for sharing this recipe - we will certainly try it again!

Disclaimer: I did make a few changes because of my personal tastes. No corn but added peas. Also, instead of poultry seasoning I used garlic powder and Herbs de Provence (a homey soup!). And I only had 2 cups of half-and-half, so 1 cup was milk. But truuuuuuly delicious! Thank you for this recipe... it's a greatttt one!

I limited to 4 stars because I didn't follow exactly:however, I don't know why anyone who followed this recipe found it bad. I used adequate bacon, milk and sour cream instead of half/half, and it turned out great!!  Delicious and warming. I also deviated by using Bisquick dumplings, but suggest that their recipe should call for a little more milk, and drop the muffins a bit smaller. I don't expect to do better than this with chicken and dumplings.

This was a very good recipe. Like others, I added more veggies - diced carrot to the onion in the bacon fat and peas right before I added the dumplings. I also added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the broth. I used the dumpling recipe from the "Old Fashioned Chicken & Dumplings" recipe on this site, dropped them in heaping Tblsp and cooked, covered, for 10 minutes. I did need to add some flour/water mix at the end to thicken it to my liking. Great comfort food!

My whole family enjoyed.  It turned out really well even though I had to substitute soy milk for the half-and-half and milk because of a dairy sensitivity in the family.

My family absolutely loved this, even my boyfriend who really is not a fan of chicken and dumplings.  Absolutely delicious!  I didn't change much other than not using quite as much chicken as I only had 2 breasts on hand which had the bones and skin still - just cleaned them and chopped it up and it was enough.  I used frozen mixed veggies instead of just corn to add some variety and color, and it was seriously yummy!

This was a great recipe!  The only thing I did differently was that I used 1% milk instead of half & half and I tripled the amount of bacon (lower sodium.  I also did not have poultry seasoning so I substituted Mrs. Dash.

this was a really good chowder type soup that was great on a cold evening. my only complaint was that i felt the dumplings were overkill. with all the potatoes you really don't need any more starch... i made the recipe exactly as written and i will make it again without dumplings next time

I kept thinking as I made this that it would be horrible, bland and starchy.  The result was magnificent!  It had the taste of potato soup and the consistency of a good hearty chowder.  I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I used Lawry's seasoning salt.  Also, I've never made dumplings before so I had no idea what to expect.  As I was dropping them in, I thought I had made too much so I stopped and didn't use all the dough.  What a mistake!  My husband and daughter said next time make less potatoes and more dumplings! I will probably make this again, however it is a bit labor intensive.  Not just a 'throw together and bake' type meal.

The only reason this recipe got 2 stars is because the chicken tasted just passable. It looked very unappealing. I'm an experienced home cook and followed the recipe exactly.  After looking at this when it was served, then tasting it, we ordered out. In the words  of my daughter, "Eew Daddy, what is it??"

We love chicken an dumplings! The bacon was a great change but I made my own chicken stock seasoned with salt,black pepper,garlic powder and thyme. Did not use corn. Added fresh carrots and onions. Two percent milk instead of half and half. I also made my own dumplings With 1 cup flour 2 tsp. baking powder, half tsp. salt, 2 tbs. melted butter,1 egg,1/3 cup milk all mixed together. Very tasty!

This dinner was very good.  5 out of 6 of us liked it and with my daughter it depends on the day if she likes something or not.  It does need something.  My family likes a lot of spices and this needed a bit more for us, but my husband and I both went back for seconds and he is very picky.

We love this recipe!  It is the consistency of a chowder which is great on a cold snowy evening.  I followed the recipe as written and was happy with the results.

I was really excited about this recipe... a couple months ago I made a different chicken and dumplings recipe and loved it... this one having BACON in it seemed very intriguing, but this was just okay for us. The consistency was really weird. I did cut back on the liquids like suggested, and it wasn't runny at all. I added more bacon and omitted the corn. I don't know if I did something wrong, but we'll be sticking with my previous recipe for chicken and dumplings...

This was my first shot at making chicken and dumplings...but definitely not my last.  My family absolutely loved this recipe.  I did use more bacon than recipe calls for.  Will make again very soon.

I was suprised, this was really good.  I've always been stubborn and only wanted dumplings and chicken in the "chicken and dumplings", forget making it a stew but this, this was really good.

Fabulous comfort food - simple and tasty and just right for a cold evening.  Although this is a very quick recipe, I make mine in the crockpot for those days when I want to come home to a fully-cooked meal.  I also make the dumpling mix myself, which only adds an extra five minutes - if that - to the recipe.

This is more like a Chicken and Dumpling stew.  Needed more thickness and flavor so I removed a lot of the liquid and whisked in a couple of cans of cream of chicken soup.  Also, I added some garlic salt.  Overall, not bad, but I prefer Chicken and Dumplings Southern style with homemade dumplings completely from scratch.

This recipe was easy, but it is a little time consuming.  I thought the taste was great!  I didn't have biscuit mix so I used pancake mix and it worked just fine.  I also left out 1 cup of cream (the fat scared me)  I think next time I'll add an extra cup of stock in exchange for the cup of cream.  It was hearty and tasty and best of all the kids liked it.  It's a keeper, thanks, Rebecca!

This recipe was excellent!  My husband just loved it and a good friend of ours said it was as good as his mother's and his mother's was the best!!!  I did use non-fat half and half to help cut the calories and it still turned out great.

Delicious.  Family loved it!  The dumpling mix did require a little more Bisquick than the recipe called for to make it the right consistency to drop in for dumplings.  There were a lot of dumplings when all was said and done, but for bread lovers, that's not a bad thing.  Definitely a keeper!

It turned out very good.  I added extra bacon and some spices for flavor.  I had to add corn starch to thicken or it would have been very thin.

If you are using a skillet you need a big deep one.  I transfered everything to deep pot for addition of milk.

AFTER READING A FEW REVIEWS I MADE THIS WITH HELP FROM  THE REVIEWS. I ADDED CARROTS, CELERY.  I GAVE THIS A FOUR BECAUSE I ASKED MY HUSBAND HOW HE WOULD RATE ON A 1 TO 5 SCALE AND HE GAVE IT A FOUR AND A HALF.  I ALSO MADE BISCUITS ACCORDING TO THE RECIPE ON THE BOX.

I do something a lot like this in a slow cooker.  Instead of using biscuit mix and milk, I use tube biscuits from the refrigerated section, cut them in quarters and cover the top of a 7 qt slow cooker with the tube quartered.  It takes a stovetop recipe and makes it a slow cooker recipe.  Just brown the bacon, crumble and reserve.  Add fat to all other ingredients (I'ld boil and mash the potatos first but that is optional if you don't want firm chunks other than chicken), and combine everything in the 7 qt crock pot, so I could turn it on before I go to work and come home to a finished meal taking the dumplings off the top and giving it a good stir to make sure everything is combined.  Just  plate and put bacon bits on top.

This was amazing!! I left out the bacon, only because we didn't have any, and added some peas, carrots ans celery. I would cut back on potatoes, just because you have the biscuits for carbs. I prefer more veggies.  This is so easy. I boiled the chicken.

Definitely comfort food! I replaced the bacon with mild Italian sausage (Johnsonville, of course!) and we loved it. Perfect for chilly Fall days.

This was good, but I couldn't get all of the ingredients into my biggest, deepest skillet, at 14 inches.  Had to leave out some of the potatoes. I ended up transferring it, during the cooking, to a big dutch oven.  Next time, I will start with that and add more bacon.  The kids loved it

This didn't really work out for me - couldn't get the dough to a doughy consistency, and my family thought it was a little bland and would have preferred a chicken stew without the dumplings.  It wasn't bad, just not great.

I made this exactly as written except w gluten free biscuits so I'm sure it would have been even more tasty had it been regular , but my gluten free version got a good review from my husband and my one year old ate his all gone so I'm giving this five stars.

I couldn't imagine a better stew! I did not use the dumpling part of the recipe, instead I made Chef John's dumplings from this site. I added a clove or two of garlic, and some celery (added with the onions) and carrots. I also thickened it with some cornstarch / milk mixture, and in fact used mostly 1% milk not cream. I like more of a stew than a soup texture. One tip, my stew filled the pot and I think the dumplings would have been fluffier if there was more room for them to expand. So make sure to have lots of room in your pot! A definite keeper!

For the money you had in this (the half and half, bacon, chicken etc..) it was just OK for me. Was not crazy about it. I do know other reviewers telling things they added/changes etc.. By the time I tell you how I would tweak it, it would be an entirely different dish. For those of you who gave ideas, I see where they would work. For me, I think I will just pass this one by.

My mother used to make "Potato Dumplings" when I was a girl.  They
were made with quartered potatoes boiled in water with bacon pieces, and then she would make dumplings like the ones for "Chicken Dumplings", rolled out thin on the dough board and cut into thin slices. If we had any fresh English Peas in the garden, she would
put some of these in, but we rarely did.  She always said you only had
two messes of English peas from a planting:  one on the table and one
in the garden.

This is absolutely delicious!  However, the cook time is way low.  Simply adding up the cook time numbers in the recipe shows that the cook time is 50 minutes, not 30.  Big difference if you're timing your dinner to sit down at a specific time.

We thought this was great.  I had to add quite a bit more of Bisquick to make the dough thick enough - not sure if Bisquick wasn't the right kind of biscuit mix or not, but I just added enough to make it into a thick, clumpy dough and voila - the dumplings were great.  I would recommend more salt though.  We had to add quite a bit after it had cooked and I'd rather add a little bit more during cooking so it has good flavor overall without being salty. Thanks for the great recipe.  I've never made chicken and dumplings before and I won't look further for a different recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really well! It basically tastes a lot like potato soup with chicken and corn in it. Maybe kind of like a chowder, but I'm not really a chowder expert. A few extra slices of bacon couldn't hurt, and make sure you season well. Warm, comforting food that the kids enjoyed too.

I made this recipe for my family last night and it was delicious.  I have been attempting to make chicken and dumplings for my husband for years and they have never turned out this well.  I followed the recipe almost exactly using Bisquick to make my dumplings. I did not use poultry season and I don't think the taste suffered at all. The bacon made the entire dish more flavorful. I give it five stars!

This meal was great but I made some changes. I used 1 and a half packs of cream cheese instead of half-and-half and 1 cup of 2% milk. I also used 2 drained cans of mixed veggies instead of the 3 potatoes and can corn.

Wonderful!  The family loved it!  I made some changes:  4 pieces of bacon instead of 3, 1 very large russet instead of 3, 4 cups of broth instead of 3, and 1/2cup of half and half and 3/4 cup of 2% milk instead of 3 cups half and half.  I also used one whole corn on the cob; cutting off the kernals and scraping as much of the starch and adding that as well.  And since it's summer and I have a bunch in the garden, a diced zucchini.  My huband is not a fam of dumpllings so I boiled some egg noodles separately and add them to the bowl before ladeling over the "stew".  Yummy.

This recipe was so good, I made it exactly the way the recipe said to. My father's only ever had his grandma's dumplings and he LOVED mine!! My first time turned out perfect. I'm making it again for the second time and am going to follow a few other peoples comments as far as using more milk rather then half & half

It was very simple and delicious. I took this picture (orange bowl) to show how delicious it even looks. I added with cream of chicken soup and substituted cream of celery soup instead of celery.

This reminded me of my dad's chicken and dumpings- with that said, I liked the recipe but there were a few things that DIDNT work out for me. Having to cook the tatters and chickens and extra parts of the stew for 15 min in step 2 is something I will NOT do again, it over cooked the veggies and chicken. Another thing I would change is that I would add flour or corn starch to the half and half, it allows the liquid to thicken up. I didnt add flour the first time and my "stew" turned out very liquidy, more like a soup instead of a stew. Other then that I loved the recipe and tasted exactly like how I remember chicken and dumplings!

My younger daughter picked this recipe for me to make, she absolutely loved it. She wanted to eat it again for dinner the next night and she even had it for a 3rd time.  Only recommendation would be to add more bacon.

Oh man...I tried this once and have never made it any other way since.........this is my first review after years of membership , that is how good I think this was....I made it exactly as listed but have also substituted milk for half and half in a pinch and it is just as good....I highly recommend this comfort food!

Very good!  The 8 servings is way off for my family.  Even diced, we eat at least 1 breast per person (and we are not an overweight family).  I made 6 breasts and adjusted all the ingredients.  I would also suggest at least 1 slice of bacon per chicken breast.  This fed 4 adults and 1 child.  3 had second helpings and there was one portion left for my husband to take to work for lunch tomorrow. I followed dumpling recipe on box as previous rater suggested.  Even though the biscuit recipe made more than the recipe suggested my family was looking for more.  I also garnished with parsley.  This recipe is a real winner with my family!

Awesome!  I used three cups low-fat milk, added some more vegies, and used ready-made biscuit dough.  Fab!

This dish has real potential. It has great flavor, but I ended up increasing the bacon and should have reduced the potatoes and the amount of dumpling mix. It's more of a potato stew with chicken and dumplings as is.

AMAZING!! Loved this recipe. Perfect for a cold day. One change I made. Substituted celery for the onion since there was someone with an allergy to onion eating it. Also, follow the recipe instructions for the dumplings instead of the bisquick box or you will end up with a LOT of dumplings :) I also added about 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes to give it some heat. Served with mulled cider to drink. Also, I thought even 2 potatoes diced was too much, so next time I will probably use smaller potatoes or maybe just one large one. To each their own though. YUM YUM!!

This recipe is yummy, with some modifications.  More bacon, used 4 cups of broth and 2 1/2 cups of evaporated milk instead of half and half.  Added a little granulated garlic and celery powder too.  Don't bother with a skillet unless it is huge go straight for the stock pot.  My own issues about biting into potatoes so I used the masher a couple minutes before adding the dairy.  Also didn't have biscuit mix so I used the "dumplings" recipe from this site and they were wonderful.

We made this dish last night for a small dinner party and every one was VERY pleased! It was delicious. We doubled the recipe, but used fewer potatoes than suggested. I could tell that even if we hadn't doubled the recipe it still would have taken some very large cookware to contain all the ingredients. I would definitely suggest this meal for a large group of hungry people! Yum!

Okay, this is what I did, I just let my mother make her regular chicken & Dumplings and I just added bacon, I'm like another reviewer, to add corn and all that would make it like dumpling stew so I just did bacon and man! it shot it up a whole different flavor! Doing just that is something I would reccomend!

This does taste good, but here are a few tips to cut down on the cost of more ingredients. Don't cook the chicken with the bacon. Chunk it up and cook it in 6 cups of lightly salted water. Voila! instant chicken broth. There is also no need at all for adding half and half or like some reviewers have suggested...cornstarch. When you mix up your biscuit mix make sure it is very thick, but not dry enough to make biscuits. By tablespoons submerge the spoonfuls into the bottom of the liquid and give it a little shake. It will come off the spoon and float to the top of the pot and will also thicken the liquid into a wonderful gravy like consistancy. I have been making it this way for years, and it is fabulous, although the bacon was a new idea.

Good concept, sort of like chicken and dumplings meets loaded potato soup!  I used whole milk instead of half-n-half and cut back by 1 cup, but still too runny for me, even after adding 1 T cornstarch.  Will try with more cornstarch next time.  I also used bone-in chicken thighs, then used forks to shred meat from bones and returned to pot before adding milk.  Also sub chicken stock cubes in water for actual broth.  Otherwise worked well!  Follow baking mix box directions for dumplings and resist the urge to stir once the dumplings are in.  Let them steam with the lid on for full 10 mins.

I liked this recipe, but I wasn't what I call quick to prepare. I doubled the bacon per other reviews, and it still wasn't strong in the bacon flavor.  I may just leave it out all together next time I make it or just put it on top before I serve it.  I'll probably cut up everything ahead of time that way I can just throw it together faster. If you make the dumplings from Bisquick use the dumplings recipe off the box because it works better than the one on this recipe.  All in all it was enjoyed by the entire family.

Good comfort food. I added carrots, celery and peas and garlic, but omitted the corn, since I didn't have any in the house. I also used red potatoes, since that is what I had. I also used cream of mushroom soup instead of the half and half and it turned out really yummy. I also just used Bisquik for the dummplings. Good recipe, I would make it again.

I thought this was soooo delicious!  I added more bacon, mixed the cornstarch w/the half and half like other reviewers said (plus had to add more to some chicken broth to thicken to the consistency like traditional chicken and dumplings).  I also added chopped carrots instead of the corn.  Super yummy! This deserves 10 stars!

I couldn't wait to make this, it sounded so yummy. I added some chopped carrots and left out the corn because I didn't have any.  I also used whole milk and 1 extra slice of bacon, thinking this might add to a full flavor. My family did eat it but it wasn't a favorite. It was a little bland, in my opinion.  I might make it again by boiling a whole chicken, then removing the chicken to allow it to cool and pull off the cooked meat then return it to pot. I think the flavor would be more of what I expected.

This was very yummy, however it was more like soup than gravy. The flavors were awesome and I will definitly make again with a few changes- follow the Bisquick box for the dumplings, these were too runny and turned a little doughy.  Next, I'll add some corn starch to thicken the liquid. To cut some of the fat/calories, I'll probably use half milk and half the half-and-half it calls for. Oh, and I added some carrots to it as well. Very great one pot meal for a cold winters night!

This was sooo good! My family likes my good old fashioned way of chicken and dumplings and they frowned when I told them I was going to try this recipe tonight, but they loved it and have asked for it again. Definitely 5 stars. I did make the dumplings according to the bisquick directions because I know they turn out perfectly.

The bacon in this recipe adds a nice flavor.  However, I thought there was way too much liquid. Next time I would use 2 cups stock and 1 cup half and half.  I substituted frozen corn and also added some frozen peas.  Next time I would also add more seasonings as some reviewers suggest.

Very good and easy to make too! I've made and had various Chick & Dump but the bacon makes this one special. I made as stated except for 2% Milk instead of H&H because I did not have any and I added some carrots, celery and parsely for color and flavor. Two thumbs up cuz that's all I got.

This is a great recipe.  My people don't like corn, so I left it out and it was still great.  Put a little corn storch as suggested by others.  I also used half breast tenders and half thigh meat since my wife is a dark meat fan.  It turned out great.  It sort of tasted like a very good potato soup with dumplings floating around.  I also added a bit more biscuit mix to make the consitency right.

This is a good comfort food.  After reading the reviews, I decided to stick with the recipe and make it like soup.  I didn't have any potatoes so I added instant rice just before the dumplings.  This worked out really well.  Thank you for sharing.

I never thought I'd ever put this as a complaint, but it was too bacony.  This from someone who loves bacon!  It just didn't seem to mesh well with the Chicken and Dumpling scene.

this was a very time consuming meal. it was very good taste wise but i think that i will prepare things such as the chicken and onion the night before. lots of half and half i think i will try regular milk maybe whole milk next time. other wise this was a big hit. it also doesn't microwave well and we like leftovers. i will make again but not too soon. half and half is kind of expensive to use like that. luckily i drink lots of coffee.

It was okay.  Like the other reviews I read I cut the half & half to only two cups and still it was not a stew.  The poultry seasoning I thought was a little over powering.  My husband and I ate it, but no one went back for seconds.

The ultimate comfort food. My family loves this recipe.  I do increase the bicuit mix (bisquick) to 2 cups, the consitency is better. You can reduce the chicken stock or let is reduce in the pan longer before adding the dumplings.  If you are looking for more color, add some frozen peas instead of corn or in addition to.

I liked this recipe. I did use thighs instead and only 2 cups of half and half b/c I like mine thicker. I also used the bisquick directions for the dumplings. Overall a tasty recipe.

This recipe is very time consumming, but I enjoyed getting it together. I used ham instead of bacon to cut down on the amount of grease in it. I also added carrots, celery & fresh garlic in place of the corn. The soup itself was rather thin, so I made a paste of flour & water to thicken it up just a little bit.  All in all, this recipe is very yummy. My family & I enjoyed it very much & I plan on making it again. Thank you Rebecca for sharing it with the world.

I halved the recipe, but kept the liquid about the same, which was perfect.  Followed the recipe to the t, but left out the 1/2 and 1/2 and added celery, used canned biscuits and reduced the poutry seasoning.  Pretty good, although it was greasy, I had a hard time getting myself to swallow the broth, so I just ate the substance.  Not sure I'd make again.

Wonderful and easy!  Been looking for an easy but tasty Chicken & Dumplings recipe and this sure works.  Added a little chopped celery with the onion and ommited the corn (we don't care for it).
YUM! Will be making this all winter - Thanks Rebecca.

It was my first time making chicken and dumplings, and my husband and I love it! I made a couple adjustments to our personal tastes (more bacon, carrots, lots of garlic and some corn starch), but all in all this is a fabulous recipe!! Thank you!

Pretty good but omitted the corn.  Also, one cup of milk for the biscuit mix was excessive.  The batter was runny so I had to add more mix to the bowl.

It was good, but only after increasing spices & quite a bit of cornstarch to thicken.  I wish I would've read more comments & found that several DEcreased liquid to make sauce thicker.  It was good & I will make again with adjustments I made.

Warning: this makes a TON. My largest skillet wasn't big enough to hold all of the liquid.  Definitely should have made this in a Dutch oven. 

I used frozen corn (don't like canned), doubled the bacon, used a combo of chicken breasts and thighs, and added some garlic powder and dried parsley to my dumplings. Delicious, hearty winter meal. Just make sure your pan is big enough!

I'd actually give it an extra half star if I could. I love chicken and dumplings as a winter time dish. One thing we did just for our own taste was to sauté the chicken with a ton of Italian herbs for extra flavor, but I don't think this is mandatory to make this recipe yummy. We personally like to let it simmer before adding cream to try to get the chicken as shredded as possible. We also added carrots which were great. Lastly, we did not add the bacon to the pot, just crumbled over everyone's bowl. In my opinion bacon tends to get too chewy when it sits in a liquid for too long. This is definitely a great dish which gets better each time you cook it, just make more dumplings as needed!

This was yummy but I changed it a bit. I added frozen mixed veggies instead of corn. I didn’t have half and half so I used whole milk and buttermilk. I added garlic.  I also made my own dumplings without a mix but it turned out pretty good.

Very yummy! I used tenders instead of breasts and added a can of peas and carrots. I used bisquick mix and water, and saved the bacon crumbles for sprinkles when done. I will probably add more bacon next time!

I will definitely make this again. However, I was out of half and half so I used whole milk. Also, the milk for the biscuit mix was way to much. I need  having to use almost another cup of mix but it made a lot  of dumplings, so it really a down side there. I also ommited the corn. Overall very tasty

No changes were made. I would not make this again slow cooker chicken and biscuits much better and easier.  Thought the bacon in biscuits would be a nice touch but wasn’t a fan. My husband ate it and had 2 helpings butalso  liked the slow cooker one much better!

Actually this is a winner as written. I did add some red pepper flakes when put 1/2 and 1/2 in.  I also added fresh carrots,green beans, garlic and mushrooms and left out potatoes. 2 cans of small biscuits to absorb some broth. So good daughter approved I make it again. Loved that I could prepare everything and enjoy a glass of wine during simmering intervals!!

It looks decent however I've entered my food preferences indicating that I'm allergic to dairy fat and cannot eat it and yet this recipe has half and half and the other recipe sent with this was mac and cheese. Therefore the recipes to me are inedible.

It was OK. I would sub peas for corn if  I made it again. The  broth is thin. My husband called it chicken chowder, which is a good description. It was tasty, but not delicious.

Of course I added WAAY more baco AND I slowly fried the skins to a crisp and crumbled that in with the bacon. I also boiled 2 bone in chicken breasts in chicken stock with 5 cloves of garlic. I mixed the cornstarch in with the half and half but adding an extra potato would have done the trick.  I used 12 oz of frozen corn and added a stick of butter also! For the biscuits I used 2 cups flour, a cup of milk, half a stick of butter, garlic powder, old bay and a cup of sharp cheddar (cheddar bay biscuits). For those complaining about not following the recipe to a T, you may not want to follow me, as I ALWAYS try to tweak and add my own little touch. AWESOME recipe!! THANK YOU!!

The cooking time is actually more than 50 minutes - 30 in step 2 and 20 in step 3. When I made the dumplings using her measurements, it was like pancake batter. Ended up using the measurements on the box of mix. With the amount of liquid, feel the spice needed to be at least doubled.

Really really delicious!!!! I had an issue getting it to thicken after I dropped the biscuits in. They all floated to the top and then the bottom was too thin after I simmered it. Next time I plan on stirring in the first couple of spoonfuls of biscuit mix and then I will allow the rest to float on top so they don't break into pieces. The flavor was wonderful and it is a nice hearty meal. I will be making this one a lot in the winter time!! Yum!

Followed the recipe with one exception - instead of chicken breasts, used thighs as the wife and I like them better because of the natural flavor. Great recipe and as there are just the two of us, the leftovers were even better. Tis is the type of recipe that lends itself to adding things like other vegetables, additional spices. Will definitely make it again.

I thought this was a great recipe. Very different than your usual chicken and dumplings. To me it was more like a thick stew than anything. While I prefer the more traditional recipe, I will definitely make this again.

With the addition of seasoned salt, a bay leaf,  garlic powder, and celery seed, and butter with the bacon grease, the flavor was top notch. I loaded it with corn, peas, potatoes, onions, carrots, and celery. The only thing I would change are the amounts for biscuit mix, it was way way off. Mine formed a floating yeasty mass on top that was only dumpling-ish in the end.

This is very good and easily adaptable to your needs. I cook gluten free so I used gluten free bisquick for the dumplings. I know gf batters need extra liquid so I simply used 1 1/4 cup of bisquick to the cup of milk.  Also I used a can of  gluten free Progresso chicken corn chowder which gave me the corn I needed plus made up for part of the 3 cups of half and half, the rest I used almond milk. I added carrot and celery as well. I used homemade chicken broth too. This was so good and just make simple adjustments for your dietary needs. Enjoy!

Here are the changes I made to the recipe: 

I bought 4 large pieces of seasoned bacon from Whole Foods and next time we will add more, it made the dish!

I added many dashes of spice to the 'soup' before the cream went in including garlic, salt, pepper, garlic salt, onion salt, parsley, basil, oregano, and two chicken bouillon cubes because a lot of the reviews said the recipe was bland. 

I also added the 2 tablespoons of corn starch to the half and half before I put it in as many other review suggested.

I used Bisquick for the dumplings, 2 cups of Bisquick and 2/3 cups of milk and it was plenty, I simmered the dumplings 10 minutes uncovered and 10 minutes covered as the recipe and the Biquick box suggested and the dumplings turned out perfect.

My negatives would be that it was time consuming to make (I am a 'slow' cook so it may have taken me longer than the norm), and it made a huge amount, great for a family, too much for a couple. We ate dinner, packed lunches, and froze what was left.
Overall a great comfort food recipe, great flavor, I would like to add more vegetables next time and I will half the order.

I made this from "lefties" as Nanny would say; also, homemade chicken broth.  That being said, watch the salt.  I didn't add any to the broth so there wasn't any in the dish until I salted.  Advice: Wait til done or go easy.  I didn't lose my mind, but it was a bit saltier than I expected.  I reduced poultry seasoning to 2t & that was plenty; thickened with 1T cornstarch.  I added peas & carrots, no corn.  'Was thinking I was making something gravy-ish not soup/stew-ish, more wet than I expected although I should've known.

This is the bomb....cooked it for my friends and they loved it too.  I made my dumplings from scratch since I did not have any milk..just an easy recipe with flour, baking powder, salt, cooking oil and I used chicken stock instead of water.  Definitely a keeper in my recipe book!!

OK...I have 3 fussy eaters in my house and it was probably the quietest dinner we've had in years! They all went back for seconds and the fussiest went back for a third! Easy meal to prepare and VERY delicious. I will make this again for sure!!!

I did try this recipe, and it was great, right up to the point where it said 1 cup of milk for 1 1/2 biscuit mix. To make dumplings it should be 2 1/4 cups to 2/3 cups milk. I had already poured the milk in the biscuit mix and had to keep adding more till I got the right consistency. Other than this the flavor was great!, Loved it.

This was wonderful.  I've never made chicken and dumplings before, and I was rather nervous about the results.  I made this according to the recipe almost entirely.  The only change I made was using garlic/cheese biscuits, and making them according to the directions on the packaging. Everything else was exactly as described. It turned out to be delicious.  I highly recommend this.

This was delicious!! We added about four sliced medium carrots, a small bag of frozen peas, a bit more chicken broth, and used six average sized red potatoes instead. Also, instead of using the bacon grease, we used olive oil. It still turned out very flavorful and fantastic.

really good but a few tweeks were necessary. I used shredded hash browns that I browned salt and peppered, about 2 tsp of parsley, carrots and 1 roll grands buttermilk biscuits torn into pieces. Next time I'll omit the corn. You'd think it would compliment this dish well but it did just the opposite to me; I'll use carrots and celery instead. Easy with the salt! I learned the hard way that the salt intensifies as it cooks

This was amazing! We decided that it didn't quite qualify as dumplings, mine came out like chicken corn chowder with biscuits mixed in. But everyone in my house loved it, I barely had any leftovers. Will most certainly be making this again!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. Fixed this exactly as written,but will make a couple of minor changes next time.I thought the dumplings mixture was a bit thin,so will follow the recipe that is on the Bisquick box for those.We also thought the gravy was a little too thin,so will try thickening it just a bit before adding the dumplings.Other than that,this was a very tasty,stick to the ribs cold weather meal.Will definitely be making this again.

This was sooooo good and easy! Nothing like what Mom used to make!  I added peppers, peas, celery, garlic; used cream to get it all nice and thick, and the herbed dumplings recipie from this site. Awesome fall comfort food which I will definately make again!

This is a delicious, thick chowder kind of meal that everyone loved--and it's even better the next day!  If you're really short on time, use canned diced potatoes, precooked bacon strips, and Tyson precooked bagged diced chicken.

Delicious! The only thing I would change is to perhaps add some corn starch or flour to it to thicken it up some, but if you like it more brothy it's perfect!

I used the recipe as a guide and followed a couple of the recommendations. We had guests over for dinner and everyone LOVED IT!!! Changes I made were rather slight: reduced to 3 chicken breast, increased veggies by adding some cut up baby carrots and 2 stalkings of chunky sliced celery. THe canned corn gave it a nice sweet flavor which complemented the other ingredients nicely. The "gravy" was rather thin so next time I make it just before topping w/ the dumplings I will slightly thicken the gravy w/2 T flour stirred into 1/4 C flour.

The only thing giving this dish any flavor or seasoning is the measly teaspoon of  poultry seasoning, otherwise the bacon imparts nothing and a pot  of  cubed chicken and potatoes  & flour leaves the plate
rather bland.  I should have added something to zip it up because as it is written, I found it pretty
tasteless.

This was my first ever chicken and dumplings and it will definitely be part of our rotation now.  I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and a bag of frozen beans instead of canned corn- the greens were much needed.  I didn't have chicken seasoning so I just used some Johnnys and plenty of pepper and the amount of spice was perfect.  I had half of a whole chicken I'd cooked in the crockpot the day before and that worked great.  I also thickened it with an unmeasured 1/2c Corn Starch and it was the perfect consistency.  I used only 1.5c of half and half and the rest milk and it was great.  I used Bisquick for the dumplings and needed to follow their proportions to get it right. It tasted great, good reviews from hubby, and I liked it was all in one pan.

This kinda bored me but I gave it 4 stars because my family loved it. I made nearly as is, not a fan of corn so left that out. Did use the pilsbury biscuits in a can as suggested and that worked well. Suppose I'd add a sharp cheddar next time...it needed something.

I stuck this in the crock pot for 3 hours adding the dairy and dough last. It turned out great. I suggest less dumplings, double the bacon, add carrots, cellery and peas. It was a big hit!!!

This recipe was Ok...I felt a lot of the soup tasted like mush. The only thing I changed was that I didn't use corn, my husband hates corn. Everything else I put in exactly how the directions stated. I gave this a 3 because the dumplings were awesome, but the rest of the soup was not so great. My son and I were the only ones out of 4 that gave it a 3, my daughter and husband gave it a 1.

I am going to say there is no way to mess up this delicious recipe considering what I did to it!  My husband had been asking for chicken and dumplings for a while.  I had intended to go to the grocery store to get the items I needed but when I woke up, we were under a severe thunderstorm watch.  I decided to improvise.  First, I didn't have bacon so I sauteed the onions in 1 tablespoon butter-flavored shortening.  I also chopped up celery, garlic and a carrot. If you can imagine this, I didn't have any milk or half and half either!  I did have some powered milk on hand and used that along with 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and a can of whole kernel corn.  I boiled a whole chicken and used some of the chicken stock from that after straining out the fat.  After deboning the chicken, I added poultry seasoning, pepper, parsley and a little cumin as another reader suggested. I didn't feel like making the dumplings so I cut up pieces of a refrigerated can of biscuits I had on hand.  This was quick, delicious and made a beautiful presentation with plenty of soup.  I will definitely try this recipe the next time as posted.  Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

Really satisfying!  I used frozen corn, milk instead of half and half, and Bisquick mix.  It made a huge pot full of homey deliciousness.  Even the skeptics were convinced.  I'll be making this again, probably with more bacon next time.

Awesome. I threw in frozen corn and used milk instead of half and half, then cut up biscuits for the dumplings. Hey, it's what I had on hand! I didn't have poultry seasoning, but used some Weber's brand KickN Chicken. Yum! This one is going in the comfort food file!

My family absolutely loved this recipe. I followed the changes that other people suggested and made some of my own. It's a great "base" to start from and modify. It's a keeper in our house. We'll be making it again and again.

Great idea with the Bacon! but the broth came out strange, almost like chix broth w/curdles in it, just didn't quite come together for me.  I agree w/prev reviews that corn doesn't really belong, but celery and carrots DO; also I don't think the milk or 1/2 & 1/2 is needed, because the dumplings normally break down enough to thicken the broth. This would eliminate the "curdling" problem.  Also - needs tons more seasoning!!!  (garlic, onion, parsley, celery salt, etc.) It's very bland as written.  but -- love the bacon!  Thanks for THAT!

I felt as if I was back on the farm with my grandparents. Classic, with a little 'oomph'! The bacon really brings it up a notch. I go ahead(in every chicken and dumpling recipe I make), and add in egg-and-flour noodles that are just plopped in like the dumplings. It gives it a chewy, yet thick yum that I grew up with. Tingles my taste buds, at least!

Wonderful comfort food. Next time, I plan to start with legs & thighs and stew the meat from the bone. The breast meat was a little too firm, & that will give me the broth, as well

This recipe is amazing! I have never cooked chicken and dumplings before. I am not the most experienced cook and was intimidated by the process. I thought this recipe looked "self explanatory".  Followed it as is except for the addition of a tsp. or two of chicken granules in the broth for flavor. Also when finished I removed the dumplings and thickend the liquid with corn starch. It was incredible! Probably the best I have ever had!

This was very good.  I was out of half & half so I used 1 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream & 1/2 cup of milk.  It was delicious & the whole family loved it!  I also used a little more bacon and not quite a whole onion.  It was perfect!

It was very gritty and looked like curddled milk.

Very good comfort food. Could use more bacon...and the sauce part would be nicer if thicker.

WONDERFUL! I can't give it 5 stars because I added and adjusted, such as the suggestion to use canned biscuits instead of Bisquik, and I had to thicken the sauce with cornstarch. Otherwise. A WONDERFUL dish that did remarkable things to plain old every day chicken.

I was really skeptical about this dish while it was cooking.  My poultry seasoning gave it a green tint and it never quite thickened up like my idea of chicken and dumplings.  The only change I made was to the dumplings.  I used Bisquick so I followed the dumpling recipe on the box (2 1/4 cup mix and 2/3 cup milk).  Although this was not the prettiest dish I have ever made, it still went over pretty well with the family.  Everybody ate it and seemed to enjoy it.  My husband gorged himself with 3 helpings!  I will definitely make this again.  My only complaint was that it was time consuming....definitely took longer than the 50 minutes the recipe noted.

Less than spectacular. The flavours didn't work very much for me, everything was sort of a mush.

Very good recipe.  Even our picky eaters loved it.  I used 1 cup less chicken broth and only about 1/2 the milk.  When I make it next time, I would skip cooking for 15 minutes after adding the broth and corn and just continue to the next step so the chicken isn't too dried out.  Very nice recipe, though.

This was fantastic and simple !  I did add 2 tbsp cornstarch to the half and half (I used fat free). I also agree with another reviewer that adding the crumbled bacon on top of each serving would be better. All in all, delicious comfort food!!

I LOVED this recipe, but, the amount of buiscuit mix and milk are not right.  I looked at the box of mix and use that amount and it worked out.  I will be making this time and time again-----DELIOUS

This was really good. I only give it 4 stars because I added more seasoning and I think it would be bland without it. I added Italian seasoning and extra poultry seasoning (Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends-Poultry Magic). I didn't change the amounts of liquids as the other reviewers did, but I did add a cornstartch mixture of 1 tablespoon cs and 1 tablespoon h2o when I added the half and half-(I used fat free half and half). I also was lazy and used Pillsbury grands biscuit dough and cut them in quarters-which was way too big.In the future I will make them much smaller. The cooking times were perfect in this recipe.  I also added carrots and celery when I added the broth and I used one more pototato. perhaps that is why it worked out to use so much liquids. Anyway I give this recipe 4 stars just because I felt it needed some alterations. I will continue to use it as a base though.  Yummy!  thank you.

This was sooo tasty!!! Only changes I made were 1 1/2 c. milk and 1 1/2 c half and half, as suggested by other reviewers.  Still a little runny, but it tasted amazing.

I agree that this isn't the most appretizing-looking dish ever, but it tasted really good. I added a lot more bacon, and I also used heavy cream instead of half and half. Very hearty and filling. Thanks, Rebecca!

My family loved this meal! I made a few changes…added more bacon, used milk instead of cream (that’s what I had on hand), and made dumplings by scratch. It’s a great comfort food and very filling. This one has become a family favorite!

Absolutely my favorite chicken & dumpling dish, although I did make a few changes.  I omitted the corn and used the whole pound of bacon!  Instead of half & half, I used one can of evaporated milk plus regular milk to make 3 cups because that's what I had.  I also used thigh meat along with the breast meat for a little variation.  I don't even look at other chicken & dumpling recipes anymore!

This recipe is very good!  I did make some changes.  I skipped the corn and added diced carrots & celery when I added the onions(about 1 cup of each).  Also, reduce the milk to 3/4 cup for the dumplings.

This recipe was pretty good. We usually prefer it a little thicker, so we may decrease some of the broth. Besides that it was right on the money.

Don't know what not to say about this recipe. I just love it, even went back for seconds. A few hrs. later that is. The whole idea of adding bacon to this recipe really gave it a great kick. Awesome, awesome meal, and very filling!

Rated four stars b/c I have a very picky household. :)
