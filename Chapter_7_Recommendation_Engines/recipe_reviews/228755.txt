This is as old as the hills. I am 71 and my grandmother was from Sweden but lived in Germany up till WWII and she made this all the time, she learned how to make it from Braunschweig where she taught school. She sometimes added a yellow turnip or Swede to the hash but usually just plain served with a sunny side up egg or two on top. We never had it as breakfast though, it was always for dinner.

What a perfect idea for a hash! Thank you!!! To speed things up, I nuked the potatoes a few minutes first, then diced them. I added a half of an onion to the potatoes while frying them. It all got perfectly crunchy and mashy! Add some hot sauce at the table... Yum!!!

This was very good - made it for a late breakfast.  Added the egg on top which someone suggested.  Used real onion instead of powder and would use maybe 6 oz. of braunschweiger instead of 8 oz.  Easy to make and will go in my files.

Just loved this recipe!! Sauteed butter, olive oil, 3 red potatoes, 1/2 yellow onion and onion till soft, added the liverwurst and cooked it for 5 mins.  I then used the oven broiler to crisp it all up, add salt and pepper to taste.  I topped each serving with two over easy eggs.

Had some braunschweiger I needed to use up.....this recipe fit the bill!  Did make some changes as usual....butter and olive oil (and not nearly as much) instead of veg oil, used onions and garlic instead of powder.  Over-easy eggs on top and called it breakfast!

Wow, I would never have thought to make my braunschweiger into a hash.  I bought some the other day but really didn't just want to put it on bread.  So, googled and came across this.  It is wonderful.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I love hash so will be making this often I am sure.

Braunschweiger and liverwurst are NOT the same thing. They are not interchangeable. I love braunschweiger and can't stand liverwurst

Darn tasty!  I love fried potatoes and braunschweiger.  The combination is very good.  The only things I did differently was to fry the potatoes (and some chopped onions I had in the fridge) in butter with a little olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also mashed the braunschweiger before adding it to the potatoes and then mashed them a little together.  Great with a couple of fried eggs.

This is really good. I was trying to think of something for braunschweiger besides sandwiches and this is perfect!

This is awesome!  I love hash, and I love Braunshchweiger.  What a great combo!  I like mine with a lot of freshly cracked black pepper.  Thanks for the idea, this is going into my monthly rotation.
