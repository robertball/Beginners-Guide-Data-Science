This recipe was delish!  Instead of using canned shrimp, I purchased some fresh shrimp and sauteed them in a little butter, salt and pepper and then diced them up and threw them in..so much better than the ordinary can...

Go ahead and add the whole packet of Italian seasoning. It's delicious.

I usually don't look at the "simple" recipes, but this one is GREAT!  I did "cheat" and used fresh shrimp...I also tossed in some fresh crabmeat that was available (now) in my store's seafood section.  The dip was fabulous. Try serving it with little Belgium Endive leaves on the side (along with crackers)  for a light and healthy appetizer, as well as some celery sticks for dipping.

This is really quick!  I used a pound of fresh shrimp, chopped coarsly instead of the canned shrimp.  My husband could not get enough of it!  Very easy and tasty.

I made this for Thanksgiving, I heard a couple of people say it was good. I will probably make it again if requested. I did use fresh shrimp but I think the italian dressing took something out of the shrimp taste I was expecting.

Very easy and had a lot of flavor. I made this for my son's birthday party and everyone loved it. Living in South Louisiana, I was able to buy fresh boiled shrimped at the store. The spices from the shrimp and the Italian dressing mix worked so good  together. I plan on making this for another party this weekend.

was ok.  I followed recipe exactly and was too bland for my taste.  I added about a tablespoon of old bay and some extra salt and pepper to give a little more flavor.  Thank you tho; love to try new recipes, whether I care for them when they are done, or not

Maybe I did something wrong.  This wasn't very good to me, but my family said it would've been fine without the shrimp and served cold.

I was expecting a stronger shrimp flavor.  The italian seasoning flavor overpowers the shrimp flavor.  The dip is good, it just doesn't taste a whole lot like shrimp (I even doubled the shrimp after a taste test).

This dip is really good and I received a lot of compliments on it. Like other reviewers, I used fresh shrimp that I sauteed in butter, salt and pepper. I think that is a great addition to the recipe.

I usually serve this as a warm appetizer and it's been a hit at every party.  I use the entire package of Italian dressing, though.  Easy and great in a pinch!

I made this for my holiday party at work, and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone bragged on how good it was. I accidentally used a whole packet of dressing mix, but it tasted great. It was so good I made it for my family's Christmas Eve dinner. It is super yummy!

This recipe was good, but not mind blowing by any means.  I did use the entire package of Italian dressing mix, but thought that helped instead of hindered.  Next time I think I would add more shrimp.  You could barely taste it.  All in all a fine appetizer that I will make again with just that little bit of tweaking.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written.  The only thing I did different was add a couople of shakes of Mrs.  Dash's "It's a Dilly" seasoning, which is lemon and dill.  I took the dip to work for a potluck and everyone liked it.

This was a big hit at my bbq this weekend.  I did use fresh salad sized shrimp and doubled the amount and also added the whole packet of dressing.

This was ok. I have a similar one where I add artichokes and spinach that I like better. Im not sure about the shrimp in it. I used salad shrimp - it was cheaper then the stuff in the can.

This is a great quick and easy dip, I added the whole pkg. of Italian dressing and 1/2 pound fresh shrimp. It was a bit too "fishy" with that much so next time I'll cut the shrimp in half.

After reading the reviews I decided to go ahead and use the entire package of Italian dressing and I'm glad I did. I also had some fresh cooked shrimp leftover from another recipe  that I tossed in and it made all of the difference in the world. The can shrimp had the flavor and was convenient but fresh shrimp adds texture which I find important.  I recommend using fresh cooked chopped shrimp if at all possible but if you are using can you might want to use two cans.

Very good dip!  I used fresh shrimp and a teaspoon of dried dill weed.  YUM!  Dill is a great addition to many dips!  (You can use fresh dill instead of the dried, even better!)
