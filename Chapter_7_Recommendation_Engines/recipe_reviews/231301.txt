I made the cake just like the directions and it turned out perfect!! It was moist and thick I used sugar free fat free lemon pudding mix in the cake and just sugar free fat free lemon pudding mix with cool whip for the frosting because I couldn't find just lemon yogurt.  I made this for a work lunch and it was gone in a matter of mins.  I topped the cake with raspberries and fresh mint from my garden,  they even ate the mint!  I will be making this one again.

Great receipe.  I couldn't find lemon yogart so I just added lemon juice to vanilla yogart, it worked great.  Also went for regular sugar pudding and regular cool whip. Very moist.

Second time making this cake!  It’s so good!  I didn’t worry about it being low-fat, so I used regular sour cream, regular lemon yogurt, and regular cool-whip.

This is an awesome cake. I followed the recipe exactly. I bought "cool-whip" LITE. not sure if it was my tub, or a characteristic of "lite" products, but by the time I added the lemon yogurt, I was too afraid to frost the cake, & let it sit in the fridge over night, because it wasn't very stiff. I figured the next morning all the whip would be on the plate & not the cake! So to remedy that we just spooned the "frosting" onto our own pieces of cake. Those who wanted more took more, those who wanted less, took less! Everybody was happy. Presentation wasn't as nice as a frosted cake...but boy! It was yummy.

LOVE it. Based on whom I am baking for, I can make the frosting either lemon flavored, or raspberry flavored. Top with fresh raspberries and some mint sprigs, and you have a delicious dessert that will have people coming back for another slice!

This was a very simple recipe to follow. I made it for our Thanksgiving dinner. It was very light. My 26-yr old son declared it the best cake he's ever eaten!

I made a cherry pie filling and used that instead of raspberries, and it was delicious! A HUGE hit at our family dinner party. Thank you!
