I'm making this for the third time in two weeks! The first time I made it as directed, and it was perfect! The whole family loved it. I did follow others' advice and doubled the amount of seasonings though. The second time I used skinless breasts because the thighs had so much oil and I thought it might be just as good with less fat. It wasn't bad at all, but not as good as with the thighs. This time I am going back to the thighs, but since there is a lot of "juice" on the cooking sheet with thighs, I am going to use a roasting pan instead, and add quartered baby golden potatoes and peeled baby winter carrots half way through the cooking time.  The spices are perfect for this.  About 15 minutes until done I am adding chopped sweet yellow onions. I will come back and post a photo and results if I am able to add that later. Update: Okay there wasn't much room left for the carrots and potatoes. I piled them up on one end of the pan after rolling them in the juices, and when the chicken timer went off I removed just the chicken.  I turned the oven up to 485 and roasted the veggies in the juice until done. It was delicious!

I have to admit to using boneless skinless thighs, but if I'd done it with skin I'd have had to taken it off anyway.  So here you go.  Wonderful way to season chicken and use a heavier side dish to make a really nice meal.  We enjoyed our dinner a lot.  We had the Foreplay Pasta with Brie, Basil, and Garlic from this site along with the chicken.  Thanks a lot for our dinner, Nicole.

I saw this recipe and read all of the positive reviews, and figured I would give it a try. I usually prefer grilled chicken, so when I read that this oven chicken would turn out crispy, and also rival the grill, I had to take a shot!!!
My girlfriend raved about this chicken, and said it was my best yet! The only adjustments that I made were I used 4 wings and 2 thighs (What i had on hand) for my small family. I also used garlic and onion powders instead of salts. I took someones suggestion to put the chicken directly on the rack, and let a baking sheet catch the drippings. This allowed the chicken to crisp on all sides.
I definitely recommend this chicken. This chicken even got me some lovin' after the kiddo went to sleep.. WIN-WIN FOR ME :)

I currently have a broken right wrist(I'm right handed) with a cast all the way to my elbow and I made this the other night and the recipe is spot on. I baked for 58min and broiled for 1min. I will likely dial back the paprika a bit next time but my wife was very impressed. We are now affectionately calling this "one arm chicken".

I only had 5 thighs but I kept the full amount of seasoning.  I did as some had mentioned about adding some of the seasoning right to the chicken(under the skin).  Came out wonderfully and yes, very crispy.  However, after 1/2hr I drained the fat off so the skin wasn't sitting in the fat and was allowed to crisp on the sides also.

Awesome recipe !!! I made it with only 6 thighs using the same amount of seasoning (because I always season heavily) and it came out great !!! Also added a little cayenne and cumin . Like the recipe says , crispy !! I also put them on a baking rack so air could circulate all around . I love using the thighs because #1 they're inexpensive and #2 they're more flavorful . This is now in regular in my house !!!

I followed the recipe as close as I could. I always try to, at least the first time. However, I don't use or keep onion salt or garlic salt, so I used onion & garlic POWDERS + a little table salt. (I did add a bit of cumin, from a review, to the spice mix, but DW picked it up right away & said, "It was awesome, but leave the cumin out, next time.")
We both found ourselves pulling the awesome, crispy skin off & treating it like another side-dish!
This was, BY FAR, the best, most honest & simple chicken thigh recipe we've ever tasted!
I may never even attempt to GRILL thighs again... no matter the weather!!!
We're already on the hunt for more $.99/lb thighs!
Thank you so much, Nicole!!!

Followed recipe exactly.  Thighs were crispy and tasty.  Don't know how with these ingredients the thighs become crispy, but they do.  Easy recipe.

I've made this several times, and the whole family loves them.  I make them with the boneless/skinless thighs, though.  I melt about 2 TBSP butter, mix the seasonings in, and then brush the seasoned butter onto the thighs.  Very good, and quick and easy,too!

This recipe is the reason I now use this website. I decided to make chicken for dinner, but wasn't really sure how to season it or at what temp and for how long to bake it. I was planning on just sprinkling some salt and pepper on it and baking at 400 for 30 min and then checking it... Apparently that's all kinds of wrong! Im so glad I found this because it turned out so good! Crispy skin and juicy meat. I'm not the meat cooker in the family, I can do desserts and vegetarian options like no other, but I prefer not touching or smelling raw meat. It just weirds me out. Therefore on the rare occasion I do cook a meat option, no one really enjoys it. This saved me. And redeemed me from all my past mistakes. I tripled the recipe for more chicken, and I sprinkled some on the bottom of the chicken, and then rubbed it in. Got some under the chicken skin like I've seen others recommend doing, and then rubbed that in, then I sprinkled the rest on the top. Even the drippings were so good that I ended up making gravy out of it.

Been doing it this way for YEARS.  It's kind of a no-brainer!  Don't worry about the specifics of the seasonings.   Just put whatever you like on them.  Plain ole garlic powder, salt and pepper is a fave at my house, but any seasoning that you like will work here!  No need to dirty up a container to shake all the seasonings together in....just sprinkle what you like on.   If the thighs that I buy happen to have alot of extra skin, I trim some off, but the skin comes out SO crispy that if you'e a crispy skin fan, you may opt to leave it all on and let it cook!   The best way to do these thighs is to go somewhere around 375-400 and bake them in a cast iron skillet.  No need for the cooking spray and at the higher temp (for about the same hour cooking time) the skin gets crunchier. The meat will still not be overcooked unless you have particularly small pieces of chicken.  Also, about 10 or 15 minutes before you're ready to take them out of the oven, drain the fat that has cooked off and put them back in the oven for the remaining time.   Keeps the chicken from sitting in a pool of grease during the last bit of cooking.  Do try this recipe. My hubby who, when we met, refused to eat any chicken except a breast now asks for these thighs weekly!

Recipe worked perfectly.  Mix and match your spice combinations to whatever you like.  As long as you follow the cooking instructions it comes out crispy and delicious.  In my photo, I moved it to a different plate.  I used a cookie sheet to bake (with tin foil).  Easy Peasy!

Fabulous!  The entire family loved it!  I had to use onion powder because I didn't have onion salt and had read other reviews that had done the same. Otherwise, seasoned and cooked exactly as directed. My daughter is a VERY picky eater, and she likes her chicken the way she likes her chicken. Not only did she eat this like there was no tomorrow, but she has also asked me to make it again. It's so easy peasy, we are having it for dinner again tonight. Definitely on the weekly rotation!!

Yum! Very tasty! Used skinless boneless thighs and only baked for 20 min at 425 degrees but it still turned out well. Nice spice blend.

Very Delicious Chicken!!!!  You will not regret cooking this chicken.  The chicken was tender and juicy, it was not dry. I let it cook for one hour in the oven.  One thing I did different was for 6 boneless chicken thigh, I quadrupled the amount of spices I used.  I used the same kind of spices that the recipe says to use. My whole family loved the chicken. They were asking is there any more chicken? My children and husband kept saying while eating,UMMMM, this is so good!

Very tasty and easy. I used the family size package of boneless, skinless thighs (just over 3 pounds). I cut all the visible fat off before seasoning. I doubled the spices and baked at 400 for 20-25 minutes in a foil-lined 9x13 pan.

This was outstanding !!! I did however made some changes to the original recipe! I doubled the spices and added onion powder instead of onion salt. I also added Rosemary and a packet of chicken bouillon. I also cut some onions and spread them in the bake sheet, i then placed the chicken thighs on top of the onions. I sprinkled some garlic powder and cayenne pepper simply cuz we like spicy! I then sprayed some oil on top of skin and baked them as original recipe called for.  These were amazingly delicious!!!! My family loved it and i have two toddlers that ate it like if it was ice cream! Very yum yum!!

I just spent quite a bit of time looking for this recipe so I could make it for the second time.  Great, easy recipe for an affordable meal.  Husband came home late for dinner that night and loved it warmed up.  I'm going to keep this in the regular rotation at my house.

Edit:  This has stayed in the regular rotation for at least 6 months and is always an easy, successful favourite with the family.

LOVE IT!!! Very crispy!! Had no Oregano or Thyme, so I used Basil and Sage. I 4X the recipe and coated the underside too. After coating chicken, let sit in pan covered in foil for 6-8 hours in fridge. WOW, THE FLAVOR WAS AWESOME!!! THANK YOU!! To cut down on salt, use onion powder and garlic powder on the underside of chicken.

For some reason the chicken thighs never became crisp. Not sure why because I followed the directions and left them in much longer to try and make them crispy. It could have used a lot more of the seasoning as well. It wasn't bad or anything but wasn't amazing either.

Checked after 50 minutes and it was overcooked.  We like a lot of garlic and onion so had used more than it called for and it still wasn't very flavorful.

S3NSATIONAL! UNBELIEVABLE! FANTADTIC!  MAKE THIS NOW!!!  5 STARS!  OMG! I didnt have inion powder so i used onion flakes. I read about 5 reviews and that convinced me....i had to go back and double check if 1/4 tsp was correct because when i saw how little it was, i couldnt believe it was 3nough for 7 thighs (all i had). It was perfect. I say measure out TABLESPOONS, store in a separate seasonong jar w top and uve already got it made for next time! Use a 1/4tsp to measure out to sprinkle on each thigh.  ID SERVE THIS TO ANY COMPANY!!!

I had higher hopes for this recipe. I used 8 large thighs and doubled the seasoning. Knowing thighs with skin-on would be greasy, I elevated the chicken on a rack over the aluminum covered pan. I'm glad I did because a lot of grease collected in the bottom pan. These just did not present the image I had in my head. Even with doubling the seasonings, they just didn't portray the flavor I thought they should. They weren't as crispy as I would have liked either. I think these would be great if cooked on an outside grill. As soon as all this snow goes away, I will give them a try again. Thank you for submitting.

I made this recipe using onion powder instead of onion salt. It turns out so juicy, crispy and delicious... I baked it skin side up for 30 minutes and then skin side down for 30 minutes. This is so good that we added it in to the dinner rotation. So Good... Did I mention its good? Making it tonight!

Super easy and super delicious! My 3 picky eaters loved it, especially the flavorful crispy skin. Used a Cajun seasoning blend as I was missing a few of the herbs. Will definitely make this many more times!

Cooked the thighs, boneless and bone in plus breast.  Didn't make enough dry marinade so used some cajun in addition.  Family loved it.  Simple, fast, good!

I placed fresh rosemary sprigs on top of the chicken. Turned out really great! I placed chicken on top of chopped carrots. Will try making this with the thighs on a rack.

I only gave this 4 stars because of a few tips that came in very handy from other reviewers:
Put the seasoning under the skin, which is GREAT advice. The skin crisps up very nicely but takes the flavor with it!

I also placed mine on a wire rack to bake to avoid having it sit in it's own grease. 

Make sure to at least double the seasoning! I doubled the seasoning and I only made 4 thighs. 

This recipe was SO easy! I can't wait to make it again!

Super easy, which is my highest priority. Chicken was perfect. Very crispy skin, moist meat, and very nicely seasoned. I will be adding this to our menu at least two or three times a month.

Such a quick and easy recipe! I had all the ingredients already and was able to spend some time with my son after work while it was in the oven. Instead of using a baking sheet, I used a cast iron skillet, which I was able to serve right up to the dinner table. It looked very fancy but easy to clean up.

This is a great recipe for the busy working parents who enjoy whipping up a home-cooked meal after work, but still have time to spend with the family!

That was delicious! I'm guessing the foil makes it crispy because our chicken didn't have skin. Flavorful but not at all spicy, paired well with roasted potatoes and Garlic Kale. Definitely making this again.

To be clear: I only used the technique, not the same seasoning. But I am so pleased with the results! I was worried because I'd already marinated my chicken thighs in lemon/olive oil/oregano and I thought they wouldn't get crispy but they did! They were perfectly cooked and delicious. I'll be using this recipe again. I may even try the recommended seasonings. ;) Thanks for sharing!

When I make a recipe for the first time, I really try to stick to the recipe as closely as I can. So I left the chicken on the foil, which I sprayed.  I did, however, make more seasoning and used about twice as much as suggested. I was skeptical about this recipe, even after I read the many positive reviews. But guess what? It really works! Tender and juicy inside, crispy and delicious outside. And easy-peasy to make.  No browning on the stove, no turning halfway through cooking...just season it and put it in the oven and let it roast for an hour.  Love it.

My family loved the spices used in this recipe. The spices used weren't overpowering and pleased the palates from grandkid to grandpa. I did add some cut up butter on top of each chicken thigh before baking.

I made this using boneless skinless chicken thighs and breasts and they came out fantastic!! Better for you not having the skin. I also have made this and sliced them up into strips and put this on salad with either feta or bleu cheese crumbles and it's so delish!! I don't rate unless it's 5 stars and this is 5 stars!! Hubs loves this and it's my favorite go to recipe for chicken!!

I really liked it. I had 4 thighs and used the recipe for 8 so essentially I doubled the spices. Since I usually don't ever like the skin on, I baked 2 without skin and 2 with skin. Both came out really good. The skin got really thin and crispy so next time I will leave the skin on and put a little bit of the spices underneath also. I also broiled it on Lo for 2 minutes to get it extra crispy. I will definitely be making this again.

I liked how juicy the chicken was on the inside and how crisp it was on the outside. The spices were okay...I doubled them but they still tasted a little eh to me. I think I would have liked them more if I'd put them under the skin.

The juice coming off the chicken tasted absolutely superb on mashed potatoes though.

This was the best baked chicken I have had.  I even warmed the leftover and it was just as good.  I admit to adding an equal amount of Caribbean Jerk seasoning for a little more spice.

This is an excellent dry rub and I didn't change the proportions at all. They were moist and crispy and tender. I used the entire recipe on three thighs, under and on top of the skin. I baked them on a rack on a foil lined cookie sheet, both coated with cooking spray. Your recipe is going into my hardcopy favorites.

I used smoked paprika and granulated onion and garlic to avoid the extra salt.  I cooked in a Breville convection oven.  Nice and crispy with lots of flavor.  Only baked for 50 minutes to 160F.  Excellent.

Did not use the spray, but did use a blend of melted butter and olive oil to brush onto thighs before sprinkling with the herb mixture. The whole family really enjoyed this meal. Served with risotto and a garden salad.

Just like other reviewers, I changed up the spices a bit (adding season salt and adjusting the others listed). I also used a mixture of drumsticks and thighs, seasoning the bottom side of the chicken, under the skin and  on top. Followed the baking instructions, broiling for the last few mins. Perfect! Very moist, crispy skin, and flavorful! So easy and convenient. Will definitely use this again!

I am so grateful for this recipe. It’s perfect for those nights where you want a good home cooked meal, but you really don’t feel like spending much time in the kitchen. I’m still baffled not only by how simple this recipe is, but how unbelievably crispy the skin gets! Not only does this chicken taste wonderful, it looks beautiful too. I don’t change a thing, it’s perfect as is.

I've made this recipe several times.  It's always a hit with my family.  Husband and kiddos love it!  I've blended the spices so it's at my fingertips in the cupboard when chicken thighs go on sale.  Sometimes, after the chicken is done, I pull the skins off and throw them back in the oven to crisp them up even more for skin chips!

My family loved it! They normally only eat one or two thighs when I've baked them another way, but using this recipe - they devoured them!

Followed the directions exactly.  Chicken was delicious.  Next time I will put the seasoning UNDER the skin before baking.  We don't eat chicken skin...so all of the seasoning came off with the skin.  If you eat the skin...this recipe is perfect.  If you don't....I'd suggest putting it under the skin.  Either way.....VERRRY tasty and super easy!

Put seasoning on the skin, then flipped the thighs over and seasoned. It was amazing. Will definitely be making again.

The only things I did differently is spoon butter over top the skins before seasoning, and seasoned by eye. 
These were phenomenal. I don't understand the few low ratings. Super simple, super tender, with just enough crisp on the outside, even without broiling. Yum.

Seems to good to be true. So simple. This has become a staple in our house. I rub the chicken down with olive oil (on top of and under the skin) and season on top of and under the skin. DELICIOUS!

Excellent!  I doubled the amount of rub for 6 bone-in thighs and cooked as per directions.  After removing the chicken, I added a bit of white wine to the drippings with sliced onion and baked till opaque. Will make these again!  
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was fantastic. Exactly the flavor I was craving!
I did find the seasoning was only enough for 2 thighs (I season all over), but that was perfect because I was only cooking 2! Haha.
I did not have garlic and onion salts, so I used the powders instead and added 1/4 tsp sea salt.
I also used smoked paprika, and placed a small pat of butter under each of the skins. 
Can't wait to make this again! Definitely my go-to from now on!

This was delicious! The only change I made was to double the spices, add rosemary and some red and gold potato wedges. I didn't have enough of one type of potato. They were both equally good. I basted the chicken thighs with butter and spread the butter and spices under the skin, and sprinkled the potatoes with the spice mix. Yummy!

Nice and crispy.  May need a little less time to cook.  I added whole mushrooms to stew in the juices about half way through.  next time will try adding them from the beginning.  I also dumped a bit of the fat out half way through.

I added these ingredients to garlic bread crumbs and breaded the chicken thighs. I added more garlic salt and regular salt to the concoction.  Not  bad.

I have tried this recipe three times.  The first time I struck with the recipe as written. It good, but a little dry.  The second time, I followed the recipe, but used skinless, boneless thighs. It was very dry and tough.  The third time, I used thighs with the skin and bones intact. I played around with the seasonings by using seasoned salt and a little MSG in addition to those listed.  After 45 minutes in the oven, pulled the chicken and found that it was ready to eat and just about perfect.  I served it with white rice and black beans seasoned with a little olive oil, cumin, raw onion, sherry vinegar and red wine.  Excellent!

Such a good recipe! I burshed the chicken with a little olive oil before sprinkling on the spice mixture. I also altered the spices a bit to match what I happened to have on hand. In any case, my family was wowed and the process of making the dinner was just so easy. A keeper recipe for sure!

This had great flavor, and the skin was crispy. I did sprinkle a little salt underneath the skin. I also used smoked paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder, because that's what I had on hand. I'll definitely make this again.  My family all enjoyed it.

This will be added to our regular rotation!  It was super easy and the chicken thighs really were tender with crispy skin! I couldn't believe it : )  I only made one change...didn't have onion salt, so I doubled up the garlic salt.  I used the seasoning on five chicken thighs because that was how many were in the pack : )

Very good. Greasing the foil isn’t necessary, IMO.
Had enough juice to baste thighs half way through.
Doubled the spices.
Will make again!

I loved it because it was fast and very moist and tasty.  Measuring out the spices was the only slow aspect of the recipe, but with that done the sprinkling of the seasonings and putting chick in the oven was quick.  Bake  with the skin side up. Because there was a generous supply of seasonings on the chicken skins I decided to  serve it with the skin off. There was plenty of seasoning on the skinless side of the thigh.

Delicious as is...
 If you want to ramp the recipe up just a little bit cook the chicken thighs on the layer of  onions slices . The onions will cook and absorb the flavors of the chicken... serve with rice for a perfect meal.

I make this often.  It is quick to prepare. I use garlic powder and onion powder because that’s what I have on hand. So, I do add some salt to the spice blend. This is delicious.

Made this for the first time and it was great. But, next time I'll double up on the spices and herbs for more flavor.

Great dish, super-easy!  I tripled the spices, used 8 large thighs, bone in, BUT, I did trim off some of the fatty parts on underside of thighs as well a bit of excess skin on the top, being careful to leave enough skin on top to just about cover the meat.  I loosened the skin ( so that I could put some of the spice combo under the skin) as well basted each thigh lightly w melted butter, then generously sprinkled all sides of each thigh w the spices.  I baked for 59 mins at 375.  These came out big-time delish!  Moist, juicy, with fairly crispy skin.  I did not broil for a min or 2 at end but I will the next time. Wonderfully easy & very tasty!

Family said it was good - not great.   They suggested a lot more spice - so will double the spices next time as others have suggested.

So thankful to have found this recipe. Finally oven baked thighs my husband didn't say were dry! I used four thighs with bones and skin and made the seasoning x4...a teaspoon of each spice, used garlic and onion powders and added 2 teaspoons pink himalayan salt to my mixture. Used all of it, seasoning the bottom of the thighs, under the skin and also on top, all very generously. Actually seasoned in the morning and refrigerated all day. Baked on a cookie sheet at 350 and they reached 165° at probably 45 min. Did not bake them a whole hour. Will be making again!

The spice mix tasted fine, but might work better on skinless chicken parts, as the crispy skin lifted right of the cooked thigh, leaving you with a tasteless piece of chicken.

Excellent recipe for chicken thighs. Really easy and tasty. This is on my regular rotation now, didn't change a thing except to use parchment paper on my baking pan to save on clean-up. Thanks for posting this.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I only made a few changes by adding crushed rosemary to the spice mix and using onion and garlic powders instead of salts. I added a twist or two of sea salt.  I took another viewers suggestion of putting the chicken on top of onion slices.  I served it with a green salad, scalloped potatoes and cranberries.  Will make again and also when all the kids come for a visit. You can get a lot of thighs on a cookie sheet!

I used the spices as written. I did cook the thighs on a rack over a baking pan to keep the thighs out of the grease.  It was delicious.  The husband, 3 year old and I all liked it.

The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was a little bit too salty for my liking. Now when I make it I substitute onion powder for the onion salt  and it is perfect!

4.5. delicious recipe which I doubled for 3 pieces of chicken thigh quarter (idk how to say this), added garlic powder  and onion semoules and salt , rosemary, thyme, 1/4 tsp each of curry and paprika. I did about 58 mins and then 2 mins in the broiler . The juices I made gravy with added chicken stock cube, salt , sugar and water. Made sweet potato and carrot sides. Hubby was complimentary throughout the dinner and had seconds!

I love how simple and inexpensive this recipe is. Tastes better than the baked chicken served at grocery stores out here. Only thing I do different is use onion powder versus onion salt and double the amount of spices used.

This recipe was simple, delicious and very easy to clean-up due to the foil. I based the chicken with olive oil first to ensure the seasoning will stick. I didn't have any onion salt so I used onion powder instead; other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  As others suggested, I broiled the meat on low for the last five minutes to give a crispier top. It was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Best chicken I've ever made, and just as easy as it sounds. The skin really did come out crispy and the meat was tender. A warning, though: mine was done in well under an hour...more like 45 minutes. So keep a check on it.

I did the same as everyone else, I put spices benath the skin and then broiled for a few minutes. Turned out crispy, tender and flavorful. Definitely a favorite now.

I love how quick and easy the prep was!  It also tasted good and had a great texture--crispy skin with moist meat.  However, there wasn't enough seasoning. I doubled the spices, and that was barely enough.

Made this for the first time with 4 large thighs, 1 recipe is only good for 2 large thighs. the inside meat needs more salt, next time, will put the seasonings indise the skin, but otherwise, it is moist, skin is crispy, will make this again.

I had to double the recipe for only 6 chicken thighs in order to coat all sides of the meat. But very good flavor combination.

Doubled the spices, made a few times, once with just thighs and again with legs and thighs.  Skin was very crispy and meat was moist and tender.  Very flavourful.

Such a simply yummy chicken recipe! I followed the recipes with the exception of doubling the seasoning and used only four thighs. I rubbed both sides of the chicken and added a thin pat of butter at the last ten minutes of cooking. The finished product was a juicy thigh with crisp flavorful skin.

My kids love chicken and I was looking for a roasted chicken recipe that is both crispy and juicy.  I was so lucky to have found this on top of the search results here at Allrecipes.  I  was automatically hooked to try this recipe after reading all the rave reviews.  I made some adjustments to the seasoning.  Since I did not have onion salt and garlic salt, I used onion powder and garlic powder instead.  To make up for the lost salt  I added 1/4 tsp. salt.  I also placed the chicken directly on the oven grill and let the pan catch the drippings which I made into a gravy later on.  After one hour of roasting, I broiled the chicken for 2 minutes on high and it gave the chicken a crispy golden skin.  But next time I will broil just for 1 minute since some areas looked a little charred for  me.   Chicken thighs turned out looking amazingly yummy, crispy crackly golden skin outside, taste is good and well balanced (no spice overpowering the other), tender and juicy on the inside.   But for my Asian taste buds I needed to add just a little pinch of salt sprinkled on top of the roasted chicken.  And walah it was perfect!  The whole family loved it.  Even my parents who live abroad, after showing them the picture, wanted to try it right away.  I will definitely make this again.   Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe has become one of our go to family dinner recipes. I make a giant batch of the seasoning mix and it stays in our pantry. My husband, 8 and 2 year olds all love it as much as I do. My husband has put the mix on chicken breasts and baked them as well. It’s delicious! Thank you!

I made 10 pieces so I ended up making a little more of the seasoning mix for the remaining pieces. I also loosened the skin and seasoned the meat underneath. Also, I like my meat very flavorful so I doubled the amounts (1/2 teaspoon of each instead of 1/4) and I added about 1/4 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper as well.  Skin came out nice and crispy without broiling. Was very delicious even though I don't usually cook with thyme very often. My family loved it.

This recipe is now in our regular rotation. It's so simple yet awesome enough to serve to company. I like to roast new potatoes and onions and/or other vegetables on the same sheet pan and sprinkle the spice mixture over everything. One of our most favorite recipes on Allrecipes.

Delicious and easy! I used skinless, bone-in thighs since I don't eat the skin. I used 1 tsp. of each spice, rubbed each thigh with olive oil and rubbed the spice mix onto each one. This one is a keeper.

Very good. I will follow some other's advice and put the seasoning under the skin next time. The family took the skin off and rubbed the seasoning back onto the chicken. All in all everyone agreed this is a keeper.

This is an excellent recipe. I used powders instead of salt, but used regular salt instead of thyme because I was out. Also, I coated the chicken with vegetable oil before seasoning and placed it on top of a wire rack on the foiled baking sheet. Next time I will use thyme as well. The recipe takes only an hour and is really effortless. Thanks for sharing!

I'm embarrassed to say that I've never had chicken thighs before making the sour cream chicken thighs last week (from this site) but now I'm hooked. I didn't have time to do any marinating tonight so found this recipe and it's another keeper. The seasoning didn't seem like enough so I doubled it, but that is the only change I made. I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!

It was really easy and tasted great. I only had boneless skinless thighs and you really need to cook them like 20 minutes less. Even the picky kids ate it and asked for more. Will make it again.

So easy! My family usually prefers white meat but I bought chicken thighs for 69 cents a pound. Followed recipe exactly. The family is already requesting a repeat of this. A big hit!

It's really nothing to write home about.  My husband said boring, I'm sorry I wish I had something better to say!  My skin wasn't very crispy but the meat was juicy but I think that's a given for chicken thighs.

I made this chicken thigh recipe last night for my husband and me.  I used the recipe as is except for the paprika, which I was out of.  I added a few pepper flakes instead.  Because I only had four thighs, I adjusted the time on the recipe.  I baked them for about 40 min., which was plenty.  They were very tasty and crispy.  I will use this recipe again.

We loved this chicken recipe. The only ingredient I didn't have was the oregano, and it still tasted good! Followed the recipe and the chicken came out crispy and juicy. I used boneless / skinless breasts instead of thighs W/ skin and bone! I do wish I would've doubled the seasonings as someone else had suggested, but the meal was still delicious! To finish the meal we had the "Elsie's Baked Mac and Cheese," recipe , with green beans and rolls. Suffice it to say "YES, we will be making this again! Best part no clean-up!  My pan was clean after using the foil for easy clean, just toss and go!

Excellent!!! I did double the seasoning mix to really flavor the skin and meat underneath!! I highly recommend lifting the skin and seasoning the meat for added flavor! The skin is very crispy and the meat retains a ton of moisture!!! 
* I did not have garlic or onion salt so I used garlic and onion powder and added some sea salt to the spice mixture!

This was really good. My hubby said it was a definite make again recipe. The only changes I made was substituting the  garlic and onion salt for the powder instead. I also put the seasoning under the skin.  The only thing I would do different would be add salt, since I substituted the garlic and onion seasoning. Will be making this again soon.

I've made this recipe numerous times & it's so tasty. I've actually made the rub of the spices & keep it in a shaker.  I've used in on breasts also. Everyone  loves the crispness & juiciness of the chicken. Best ever!

I followed the recipe to the tee.  I know from other reviews, people used boneless and skinless thighs.  Cooks were concerned with the health factor went skinless.  I opted for skin on and on the bone.  When serving I removed the skin, the seasons cooked through.  I like how the skin on helps with flavor and moisture of the meat.

I only rate recipes if I make them as posted. And if I could, I would give this recipe 10 stars!! The only thing I would do different next time is double the spices and sprinkle on all sides of the chicken thighs. This chicken was easily, the best I have ever made. The chicken was crispy and delicious and I am going to make the next time I want to impress someone with my cooking!!

Took the advice and placed the chicken on the rack to cook on all sides, OMgoodness-this is a wonderful recipe!! I like extra spice so, using leg quarters, I rubbed the spices under the skin and on the outside. I cooked then about 8 minutes longer due to the size, PERFECT!!! Thank you!
Update: Made it again, definitely dbl/trpl spices as desired-they're awesome! Extended time to 1.25hrs cooking time. And for those saying they didn't get crispy, use a broiling pan OR turn the thighs and drain the juices after each 20-30min interval. EXCELLENT!!!
Update: Quit counting how many times I've made this, it IS the "go-to" for ANY baked chicken I prepare! I now keep a container to use at a moments notice.

Used 5 whole legs, rinsed and patted dry, substituted garlic powder, celery seed, and salt for the garlic salt and onion salt, which I didn't have.  I think I used about 4x the recipe amounts for all spices, so a teaspoon each plus 2 teaspoons of salt.  Rubbed the whole leg, no just sprinkled on top.  Got good roasted skin without broiling.  I am glad that I didn't have the legs resting directly on the baking sheet, since otherwise they would have been swimming in the drained fat.  I typically use some small racks to raise chicken pieces up when baking.  The temperature indication worked out very well with my oven (surprisingly!) and the timing was pretty close.  Will almost definitely make this again.

This was fast easy way to get your chicken thighs cooked.  My thighs didn't have the skins on so I didn't have that crispy effect.  I think skins should be on so the meat stay nice and juicy!

Followed the recipe pretty closely except I used Italian seasoning instead of thyme, etc turned out very nice. The other change I made and thought worth sharing is I was short on time so I jump started the cooking by microwaving for about 3.5 minutes, then seasoned, then finished in the oven for about 45 minutes plus 1 minute under the broiler. Definitely would make again

Followed directions except baked directly on the oven rack as other reviewers suggested.  Skin was crispy but the chicken was not as tender & moist as I was expecting after reading all the rave reviews.  Simple recipe.  Can be used with any blend of spices you have on hand or to your taste.

I quadrupled or even more the spices.  Don't have salts, so just used garlic powder, and used Mrs Dash for onion powder.  Added cayenne 1/2 tsp.  Also, marinated over night and put thighs on a rack so the fat could drip off.  Will make again!

Wonderful! Super easy and very budget friendly. My 4 and 5 year olds asked for THREE helpings! That NEVER happens. This is a 5-star in our books and will definitely be a regular in our home!

I've probably made this half a dozen times.  It's one of my favorite chicken recipes. While the chicken is baking in the oven, your entire house smells delicious.  I find that the quantities listed for each spice is inadequate to properly rub all your chicken, so I always mix everything x 4 when I make this.

I followed the recipe exact except for I tripled the seasoning and put it on the top, bottom and under the skin before baking. Came out crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and full of flavor. So good! Will be adding it to my regular rotation. Thanks for sharing!

I just tried this tonight, and it was very tasty. Crispy skin, juicy inside, great seasoning. I didn't have any onion salt, but it still turned out great. I'll be making this again in the future, especially since it's so easy.

Wow, this was delicious!!  Everyone from my 11 year old son to my 14 year old picky daughter loved this :)  I used the chicken I had on hand, which was boneless, skinless thighs.  The spices were just so tasty and it really did have a nice crispness to it.  Definitely a keeper!!

Skin came out very nice and crispy and the meat was cooked well, didn't have onion powder or onion salt, added lawrys season salt in its place and it turned out just fine! Added to our rotating dinner line up!

Loved this recipe, and so did my hubby who is a total foodie and can be hard to impress in the kitchen!  I did cut out a step by not mixing the spices separately first, and just sprinkled them directly on the chicken thighs.  Also, I would check thighs after about 45 minutes.  My oven may cook fast or I might've used smaller thighs, but mine were done after just 50 minutes, not the full hour.

Wonderful blend of spices.  Amazingly, the chicken is crispy!  Didn't have garlic or onion salt, so used powders instead, then just salted as I usually do.  Used whole hind quarters at 350 deg. and chicken was done in 1 hr.  Checked with instant read thermometer, just to be sure.  Thank you for a great blend of spices.  As soon as I run out of all the special seasonings for chicken, this will be made in larger quantity and will be the only one I'll ever need

I've been so tired of chicken lately and looking for a new recipe. Just made these tonight with skinless chicken thighs. Doubled the spices, sprayed olive oil both on the pan and on top of the chicken, and cut the cooking time in half. They were delicious! Served them with a side of cauliflower mashed potatoes. We are looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow. Will be bookmarking this recipe.

Super Simple. I put the chicken on top of a thick layer of kale, some onions and garlic. I need a deeper baking dish. I love veggies cooked in chicken broth. Chicken was perfect!

Delicious!  Followed the recipe as written except I only used 4 thighs, but kept the amount of seasoning the same.  Took another reviewer's suggestion and put seasonings under the skin as well as on top.  The chicken ended up very flavorful and moist.  I cut did cut off some of the excess fat and skin on the underside of each thigh so they wouldn't be sitting in fat as they cooked.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome old standby, only thing I'd add is, brine your chicken parts the night before and add garlic powder to the brine solution for it to infuse.

It was certainly easy to make and the skin was crispy.  Next time I'll follow keebdaisy's review and rotate the chicken around a bit so the bottom of the thigh can get some crisp too.  I wasn't "wowed" by this dish, my husband said he prefers some other ways I've made chicken.  But for the simplicity factor this is a good recipe to have on hand.

I didn't add salt because my mom can't take a lot of sodium but it's sooooo good!!! I sprinkled a bit of soy sauce and the rest of the family added salt to their taste.
I tried it with Roasted Apple Grille Sauce - perfecto!!!

So sorry - we wanted to like it, but not to our tastes at all.  Made exactly as directed - chicken was done (overdone actually) at 50" - at even though I was quite careful to remove as much fat as possible prior to cooking, you just can't get it all off - so they were greasy on the bottom.  The ingredients in the rub seemed as though they would work, but there was just something *off* with the finished product.  Thank you anyway for recipe.

No time to marinate for another recipe so tried this. I found that the flavor was very mild.mi cooked 8 pieces for about 1 hour, it was moist with crispy skin. Not sure I would make again, just ok

There is way too much thyme in this recipe, it overwhelms all the other flavors. I will try it again with the thyme halved.

Absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! Super easy, super quick and SUPER delicious. Skin is incredibly crispy and the meat is wonderfully moist. I did use a roasting rack so the chicken pieces didn’t get drenched in the fat drippings. I doubled the spices for 8 larger thighs. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I used an oven basket so the fat dripped away.  I doubled the spices and put the in a shaker to put on the chicken, the meat was juicy, and the skin was crispy, just like if it had been fried.

I never review but this was such a hit, I had to. I r made it four times now. The second time I winged it on measurements and it didn’t turn out quite as well, though still good. My kids who say they don’t want chicken ask for more.

I make this often. I hate when posts make a lot of changes to a recipe and then rate "their" version, not the actual recipe. That said, I do use garlic powder and onion powder and then add my own salt so I can manage the amnt of salt that I use. 
This spice combo is wonderful and I always make extra, store it in a small container and have it ready for use. My compliments to the original cook for an awesome recipe!!

Good Recipe. The thighs come out tender and juicy. I wasn't really impressed with the seasoning mix though. It didn't really add much flavor in my opinion. Next time I'll add maybe lemon or some stronger spices. But this is definitely a great and easy way to bake chicken thighs.

I have made this at LEAST a dozen times! I follow the recipe exactly the way it’s listed and it’s phenomenal! My kids love it too, calling it their “favorite chicken.” I make the seasoning with a tablespoon of each spice and keep it in the cupboard to use for the next time.

Very good!! I put on a metal rack and put that on a cookie sheet with foil.  Skin was super crispy.  I seasoned both under the skin and on top.

This has become a regular in my weeknight dinner rotation. The flavors are perfect and the skin is incredibly crispy while the meat is nice and moist. I make a big batch of the seasoning and keep it in a shaker for it to be at the ready. I peel back the skin and season the meat and the “backs” of the thighs. Then I fold the skin back over to cover and season with salt and pepper o my on the outside. Use a rack on top of a sheet pan to keep the thighs elevated out of the fat. Check them at 35-40 min because you may not need a full hour depending on the size of your thighs. So delicious, thanks for the recipe!

Just wanted to add to my previous review, I did not use garlic salt, & onion salt, just used garlic & onion powder, next time I will add sliced onions, & put it in a shallow pan to collect the drippings, which was delicious.

This recipe is fool-proof. Crispy and delicious! 

I had 11 drumsticks (skin-on) to work with. I adjusted some ingredients because it was what I had on-hand. Didn't think 1/4tsp was enough so I ended up using 1/2 tbsp of all the spices (except for pepper -adjusted to preference). It was garlic powder, onion flakes, whole dried thyme, paprika, dried oregano, salt and dried parsley. Mixed all these ingredients in a small bowl first. In a bigger bowl plopped all the chicken in, added a bit of olive oil and went ahead to coat each piece with the dry rub. Placed that all on a rack with aluminum at the bottom for easy clean up. Oven for an hour, and out came some crispy but moist chicken!
Seriously, this was fantastic! I was hesitant at first, having the thing in the oven for a whole hr but it totally worked. Not dry at all. This will be a staple for dinner. You have to try it!

I doubled the spices but my chicken came out tasting like...chicken.  I'm not sure what the spices did for the chicken because I'm pretty sure that the chicken would have tasted about the same without any spices.

I used boneless skinless thighs and cook them on the grill.  Nice flavor but nothing special.

Very pleased - I didn't need one hours at 350--- it was done in 45 minutes.  I added some bread crumbs that made it crispy--will make again;

Loved it! My husband even went to the store that night to buy more thighs to make the next day. The only change I made was to spray the thighs, after seasoning, with Pam. Don’t know if it helped with the crispy factor, but it was delicious!

This is a great and simple recipe. Will be recommending it to Friends and Family.
I did make one change. I am not a fan of paprika. So, I replaced it with chipotle.

I have indeed made this recipe and I must say it’s the greatest and easiest thing EVER! My boyfriend and I love it and I must say their isn’t ANY LEFTOVERS! I followed the recipe step by step I did not boil my chicken thighs because the crunch I already get is plenty! I hope y’all enjoy it just as much! Y’all take Care and God bless

Definitely use your judgement on the amount of seasoning. I used all of the ingredients however I had to use much more than the recipe required in order to give it flavor. I also cooked it on 375 for an hour versus 350.

A little underwhelming. I applied the rub underneath the skin as one reviewer suggested (since don’t care to eat the skin but appreciate the benefit of more tender meat), and found it was still a little too mild for my family’s liking.  Tender chicken and quick prep but probably won’t make it again.

I made this exactly like the recipe but the chicken released so much liquid that I had to drain it 4 times or it will just sit in all that.   Didn't crisp up at all so I put it under the broiler for 2 minutes. 

The flavor was great.  Next time I will put it on a rack so it doesn't get soggy.

Absolutely fantastic. I must admit I was very skeptical - I don't really like chicken skin. I ate it all up!! This is a great, great basic recipe that will stand up to the fanciest competitors! Make it, you won't regret it.

I put the spice ina zip lock with the chicken and shook it until it was coated. Also I only used 4 thighs this gave a more intense  version that we bith enjoyed. Delicious!

Made per recipe.  Since we don't eat the skin, the rest of the chicken was bland.  If we make it again, we would remove the skin and put the spices on.

I fed my family of 4 with this, and it went over very well. My wife who is dieting, didn't eat the skin, so she was lukewarm to it. Pretty quick and easy though.

Made the recipe exactly as stated but didn’t have garlic/onion salt so I used 1 part salt for 1 part garlic/onion powder. Also doubled the spices in the recipe. 

Really enjoyed this!

Delicious!  It's a keeper for me.  The skin was nice and crispy and the seasoning delicious.  (Smells so good when cooking!).  I like my chicken cooked well, so I baked it at 350 for 1 1/2 hours. Skin was crispy.  Chicken fell off the bone.  I used 6 thighs and barely had enough seasoning to cover each thigh.  If making 8 thighs, I would suggest doubling the seasoning recipe.  The aluminum-covered baking sheet makes for easy cleanup!  A bonus for this yummy dish.

I used my Dutch oven with foil liner ( see photo). I don’t measure spices when seasoning, but used the ingredients as suggested, along with :Sweet basil, Smoked Paprika, garlic powder , sea salt, Everything ( has a great impact) and Tajin. All in a large zip bag , shake , put thighs in and tossed. USED Boneless/Skinless but left fat on for moisture. Rolled them and placed on sprayed foil . Spritzed with EVOO. Placed lid on Ditch oven at angle to retain heat, but keep moist.
350 degrees... took approx 65 min. Placed a Red pepper , zucchini and mushrooms in broth/JuIcEs in about 1/2 way through. 
Absolutely making this again. Shared with my Mother

We love this recipe but can’t imagine ruining it by cooking it this way. Turn the oven up to 475 with convection and cook for 17 minutes. Perfect. Crispy on the outside and juicy within.

I make the thighs..no skin and no bone.  Marinate in salad dressing...when ready to bake sprinkle paprika...bake for 15 minutes in toaster oven.  Easy. Fast.  No skin. No bones.  Easy to ear and healthy.

We have chicken thighs at least twice a week and this is our favorite way to make chicken.  I do debone the thighs but leave the skin on and also make a large batch of the rub for multiple meals. We do add cumin and also some smoked paprika.  Goes great with a side salad  or rice or just about any vegetable.   As we debone they make a great sandwich on a baguette the next day.

Perfect!  I made extra seasoning mix and put more on each thigh.  I’ve made this 5 or 6 times and it is always perfect.  Next time I will put it on a rack over a baking pan to get even crispier skin.

375 is a little low for chicken, though flipping the oven higher after the hour, for a sake of crisping the skin, makes this fantastic.

The skin didn’t get as crisp as expected and the flavor was only on the skin not the chicken underneath.  The chicken itself had no flavor

This chicken was so perfectly cooked and moist. We just loved it! I did put a small pat of butter underneath the skin to keep the chicken moist and flavorful and the skin crisp and tasty.

I didn't have all the spices as listed so I used my salt/pepper/garlic powder mix (Paula Dean's mix, 1 c salt, 1/4 c pepper, 1/4 c garlic powder), onion powder and smokey paprika. Everything else was as listed in the recipe.
I will be making this again today.

The easiest masterpiece so far that my novice cooking skill has ever done very nicely!
I didnt have onion salt in my cupboard so i just used onion powder and iodized salt at still 1/4 tsp and tasted awesome!

next time i think putting the spice under the skin might season the meat better and oil and salt and pepper on the skin with a little oregano and thyme  sounds good. I don't know why but the skin was a little tough ... maybe after  sitting too long before serving.

This is such an easy recipe. Followed exactly . My chicken did not crisp. I did take the advice of several others to broil for the last 2 minutes. Flavor was really good. I will cook this again.
Thanks for a good recipe.

I made the recipe as instructed and the whole family loved it. They said that it smelled like pizza baking (the Oregano & Garlic) and they liked that it was flavorful with a crispy skin. Great easy recipe. I served it with a purchased quick risotto and some frozen veggies for an easy weeknight meal.

We loved it! This is an easy and delicious  way to fix chicken. The thighs  really were crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. The spice mix tastes good on potatoes and carrots. I roasted these along with the chicken. If you do that, remember to toss the vegetables in olive oil before you sprinkle the spice mix on them.

I added 1/4 tsp of rosemary and doubled the amount of spices I used to coat both sides of the chicken. I was worried the meat would be dry, but even my son loved it. And he's in culinary arts! I will definitely make this again.

So easy.  A no brainer.  The only thing I didn’t have was the thyme, but otherwise the kids devoured it and wanted more.

I love this recipe so much that I'm making it again right now at 10:30 pm because I have such a craving for it.  I cook it on a rack with the pan covered in tin foil for easy cleanup.  I use garlic and onion powders instead of the salts with just a light sprinkle of sea salt after coating.  Also, i double the spices, even for four thighs which is my usual.  This is definitely my go-to chicken recipe.  It's really easy, crispy, and loved by everyone I've served it to.  Can't ask for anything better than that.

These are perfect. Made according to recipe and they come out tender and flavorful. I keep coming back to this one! For a little twist, sub smoked paprika for the paprika :)

Made this recipe and it was a hit with the family. I took one of the critiquer's  suggestion and used garlic powder, onion powder and then salt separately and it turned out wonderful. I will be making this again. Thank you for sharing. :)

Very crispy and moist! I doubled the spices after reading and was surprised how hot it turned out. Not a fan of “hot” foods so next time I will use less paprika and pepper.

I rarely eat meat, but my husband loves it so I cook it for him.  This smelled and looked so delicious that I ended up eating a couple of pieces.  OH MY GOODNESS!  Delicious.  I did cook it about 15 minutes longer than recipe, but I didn't change the recipe otherwise.

The only change I made was I used onion powder and a little salt since I didn’t have onion salt.  Very easy and delicious.  I also put some of  the seasonings under the skin and removed all visible fat, except the skin, so had no problem with accumulated fat in the pan.  I would have given this 5 stars, but my chicken was over done before an hour.  I would suggest checking it starting after about 35 minutes.

This is one of my go to meals now! I puts the chicken in a ziplock bag with some potatoes and add the seasoning mix as a marinade. To make the marinade I mix the seasoning in 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil, pour it into the ziplock bag, and shake the bag to make sure everything get covered in the marinade. I’ll leave the bag in the fridge overnight and then put everything in a glass baking pan to bake. The chicken in tender and crispy, as are the potatoes. Fantastic!

Skin was nice and crispy. Seasoning gave the chicken good flavor. I lightly covered the whole chicken thighs and put more on the chicken skin. My husband and son enjoyed dinner. Will make again.

So Good!! I’d definitely use thighs or a bigger portion of  meat.  I only had drums and they shrunk so bad. but it was amazing.  I paired it with some garlic roasted potatoes. Yummy!!

It's good, I only had skinless boneless thighs, so my opinion is not valid, as I am certain the skin is what gives it the crispy texture, I had to cook it for half the time, so it wouldn't burn up (with no bones or skin I am sure that is why)

Still the seasoning was good, and I added a soy/teriyaki sauce to make up for the loss of the drippings from the skin and I think I'm going to perfect that recipe and post it!

So thanks Nicole, next time I have the right parts I will make it as you wrote it down!

It was good but I think this recipe needs alot of tweaking.  Definitely not a fine dining chicken. I doubled the spices and it was enough for 6 thighs. I used garlic and onion powders and added 1/4 teaspoon of table salt. I also lifted the skin and rubbed the spice between the meat and skin, but cooked with the skin on. The skin absorbed the spice and was still crisp and the spice soaked into the meat well. I also cooked in a 9×13 baking dish with olive oil which I think makes the meat a little juicier. However when I checked the meat after 50 minutes it was 180 degrees and tasted4fln.  dry and overcooked. I have more rubbed thighs marinating in the fridge for a couple hours I think I will try again cooking for 40 minutes.

This was, honestly fantastic! Made it just as the recipe said and we loved it. Nice, crispy sken, with juicy meat. I don't measure my spices and i doubled the amount (approximately). Next time i will get some of the seasoning below the skin, though.

I’m a Fraternity Chef. I made this last night for dinner. Couldn’t find the thyme so I used basil instead. Didn’t have onion or garlic salt. I used powder & threw in some Janes Crazy salt. I used a reviewers suggestion to put some of the mixture under the loosened skin & plenty on top. It was perfect and they absolutely loved it. In addition to the thighs I also used some leg quarters.  I served this with corn on the cob, baked potatoes and vegetables Normandy. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for this great recipe.

Love this.  My family likes well-seasoned meat. I double this recipe and season 2.5 lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs sprinkling it on both sides of the chicken. I've made it a staple dish in our home. Thanks!

Very Good! Made as written though I only had 4 thighs and used all the spices! With that said I would probably double spices for 8 thighs. This will be added to rotation. So very tasty!!! Thanks and crispy. I baked skin side up for 50 minutes. 165 degrees

Excellent.  To save time, I cooked for 45 minutes at 350F using convection, and they were overcooked.  Next time, I'll shorted the time to 40 min.

Delicious!  I had a tray of 10 thighs and tripled the seasoning and it was about right.  I didn't have paprika so I used ground chili california.  I pulled a pocket between the upper skin and meat, sprayed top, bottom, and inside the pocket with avocado oil, then seasoned top, bottom, and inside the pocket.  

Baked them on top of a broiler pan and rack that came with the stove.  Mine tested at 180 after 50 minutes, but they were still juicy and delicious.  The skin was still flabby.  (Edited to add: I just re-read the recipe and noticed it does not say to coat with oil.  Guess that was a different recipe I was considering.  Maybe that was the problem.Next time, no oil.)  

Next time I will check them earlier, take them out at 165, and sear the skin in a hot cast iron pan to crisp it.

I didn't get the flavor to go all the way through the chicken. Next time I may try to marinate it a bit before proceeding.

It was just ok. I followed the instructions and mine weren’t crispy. Even put them under the broiler for a few minutes. They got brown on top but sides and bottom were not crispy. Maybe i should have cooked them on a rack.

This was absolutely delicious! I doubled or tripled the seasoning and rubbed it on top, back, and under the skin. Before adding the seasoning I rubbed the thighs with a tiny bit of olive oil. I added about 5 more minutes of cooking time because I did it in a toaster oven. I only cooked two thighs. They came out perfect! Broiled it at the end and got the crispy skin. Yum! 100/100!

The seasoning blend was good, but I used it only on 4 thighs and it was barely enough.  The baking time took longer than 1 hour for the skin to crisp up, even baking at 375.  If I make again, I would put the thighs on a rack in the pan, so they're not sitting in their own grease as they cook.

I never eat chicken skin...However, this is so delicious, I think it's the Best Part!   I use whatever seasonings we like (onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, seasoning salt, etc.) I sprayed the thighs with a little margarine spray. I made this almost every week.  Then, I got an air fryer!   I tried it today, using 360, for about 35 min., turning once or twice.  Great!  (and the skin was crispy like you can't believe.)  We loved both ways.

I loved the combination of seasonings. For me, the cook time was a little too much, but it's common sense to adjust time based on size of the thighs. I also made legs with it. The only real change when I made it was to increase the garlic because my family and I enjoy it, and I used seasonings that did not include salt. I just added a few pinches of sea salt to the mix before applying to the chicken.

TLDR: Simple & enjoyable recipe.

I didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder. I also didn't have onion salt. But I have to say it came out delish! Super, super easy, practically no prep. Great thing to make on a busy weeknight, or ahead to use in future meals.

Gave it a 5 because the spice blend, it cooked properly, and the crisp skin were exactly as expected.  I lifted the skin on each piece a little and put some of the spices under the skin. It made it even better the 2nd time. But I am not a skin or thigh fan. I'll make the spice blend for whole chickens and chicken breasts next time. It was a good "let's see how this goes" recipe. I highly recommend it. 1/6/19: Made is 3 times with bone in w/ skin thighs. I'm still not a thigh fan, but it's a really good spice blend. Going to make it for some whole chickens tonight.

What a hit!!! All the way from my 3 year old to my husband (and everyone in between) loved it! I made a total of 12 thighs so I tripled the seasonings. And I did as someone else suggested and pulled the skin up and sprinkled some of the seasoning inside on the meat it’s self. SO yummy!!

For my family that hates baked chicken, they gave this a 5 star! For 16 chicken thighs, I quadrupled the seasonings and used fresh thyme  and placed them under the skin . I used a salt and sugar brine for 30 min before I baked them.

This was extremely good. The only change I made was actually out of necessity, as lately  I only use a cast iron pan.  I admit that I did have to broil the finished product for about 2 minutes. KFC grilled chicken is no longer on my menu! Thanks for such a simple recipe that will save me much money.  Kudos

I baked boneless, skinless thighs instead of bone-in and they came out dry. Don't know if it's because I didn't cover it. Don't think I'll make this again as instructed in the recipe.

This was very good and so easy.  I never make chicken thighs so I thought I would give it a try.   I made this almost as written.  I forgot the paparika and drizzled the top of the thighs with olive oil, otherwise as written. Very moist, tender and crispy. Will make again.

Really good and easy recipe. I had boneless breast with skin on so I just reduced the time to 40ish minutes and broiled for 1 or so minutes.
So juicy and tender with a nice crispy skin just as it claims!

I have made this so many times.  I make a big container of this seasoning and keep in my spice cabinet. Everyone I’ve served it to loves it.  This is my first rating btw, though I’ve used Allrecipes forever.  Thanks for this one.

Simply the best quick, simple, and cheap chicken dish - perfect for Monday dinner! My husband and kids adore this! My only tweak is that I double the spices, as we found the 1/4 tsp measures weren’t quite enough... I’ve made batches of the spice mix ahead of time to turn the 10 min prep into literally 2 mins MAX! 
Thank you ?? for the recipe!

This was so easy to make!! The flavors were so good.  I used hickory smoked sea salt, garlic & onion powder.  I also used ginger, marjoram, thyme ,rosemary &oregano. I took all the spices and ground them together in my mortar, mixing them like the recipe said. I used a little bit of olive oil on the chicken and veggies,seasoned everything and roasted them in the same pan!

This was perfect!
Sometimes I buy fun little premed seasoning mixes from cute boutiques, or TX Maxx and the like. So here I am with a plethora of seasonings and NO cooking skills! haha. I came here to see how I could use my own seasonings on some simple chicken thighs. These came out perfect! So simple. Anyone could use this basic coking recipe and pretty much use any seasonings they would like. Im so happy I can finally start going through my cabinet of seasonings. haha.

Note**I broiled mine the last 2 minutes of the 1hr time frame and the skins came out PERFECT! Thanks for sharing!

I made the recipe as it was written and added a few shakes of rosemary to the top. 350 degrees for an hour made 8 crispy and juicy thigh pieces. Great recipe!

I doubled the spices like I normally do. Everyone loved it. Easy and delish! I threw in some red potatoes the last half hour to cook in the juices. Will make again soon.

Simple and delicious. I sub'd out the onion salt and garlic salt for fresh finely chopped ingredients and I think it made for better flavor, look and texture, but do be careful not to burn. That becomes easier to do. No one wants burnt garlic ;) Also... I brined the thighs. That's a critical step for any chicken dish, even if you just have an hour, it will make them better to take a salty bath.

I did change the recipe a little...instead of pepper flakes I used ground red cayenne pepper. It was truly delicious. My husband is very picky and he liked it.

I used the exact seasonings but doubled because I had a package of thighs and drumsticks.
Whole family loved it.  But I did have to remove the skin for the littlest one.  Too much seasoning for her.

I’ve never really cooked with chicken thighs but thanks to the hubs latest low carb diet I’m looking for recipes.  This was a hit!  Only changes I made were quadrupling all of the spices, using garlic and onion powder, adding salt, and splitting black pepper and crushed red pepper because we love spice.  This is my husbands weekly favorite spice mix!

SO GOOD!!   Wanted a recipe to be easy and yummy. Served it last night and again for leftovers for lunch and dinner today.   At separate times each of my three grown children said that they loved the chicken and that I should save the recipe.  I doubled the spices.  Didn’t have Onion Salt so I put 1/2 onion power and 1/2 salt.  SUPER EASY recipe!!!!   Thanks so much!!

Used a cooling rack in a jelly roll pan to keep it from sitting in grease. Baked at 425 for 20 min and 30 min at 400. Also, subbed garlic and onion powder and just added a bit of table salt (made extra seasoning to put in a shaker for next time) Turned out PERFECT!!

An easy recipe with flavour but I’d do a 
1/2 of teaspoon of each spice . Other wise it was easy and my Hubby really liked the chicken and my sides . Macaroni salad and coleslaw.

I had everything but the ground thyme and used onion and garlic powders instead of salts , doubling all measurements.  I also put the mix under the skin and placed chicken on a rack so it wouldn't swim in the grease while baking as a few other reviewers mentioned. Baked some potatoes to go along with chicken and steamed some brussel sprouts,  turned out great!

Have made this many times now.  It is so easy to make but still really delicious!  I don't really like chicken so I am always looking for a way to cook it that I will enjoy eating it!  This is now my go to!  Today I am trying cooking it on a rack as suggested by a reviewer so it can crisp on all sides.  Quartered and seasoned small potatoes roasting on the side of the tray...I cant wait for it to be done!

I make this for my family often. We love the way the skin gets so crispy. I look up these guidelines for chicken thighs every time I make them, regardless of the seasonings I choose, but the recipe as is great as is too.

This dish turned out well. I only had five thighs, so the spices were a bit heavy on each. If I had eight thighs, the results would have been perfect. The chicken skin was very crispy and the chicken was moist and tender. The only tweaks I made was to use 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. of onion powder instead of garlic and onion salts (to cut down on the sodium). I did put in 1/8 tsp. of kosher salt for flavor enhancement. My family loved it. I intend to make this dish again and again. This recipe will become a staple in our house

This is the best chicken thigh recipe ever. I add 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper to give it a little kick and I cook it longer at a lower temperature

I love this recipe!  So easy and flavorful!  Anyone who says it's "bland", needs to check how much salt they use on a regular basis because the ratios are perfect unless you use WAY too much salt on everything else you eat and your taste buds are ruined.

Really good flavor for the chicken.  And super easy.   I really love these super easy recipes.  And you will too.  I served this with some rice pilaf and a fresh garden salad and some crusty bread.  A winner dinner in my family's book.

Absolutely our go-to chicken thigh recipe!  Like others, I doubled the spices and often add other flavors the family loves (like cumin and adobo seasoning) but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.  Moist and crispy chicken every time!!  I also tend to use a glass Pyrex baking dish lined with foil (and sprayed with cooking spray) to hold in juices and make cleanup easier.
Have served with pasta, asparagus, Brussels, rice and mushrooms... almost anything works, just use what you have on hand!  this is an absolute winner and great for easy weeknight meals! thanks for the great recipe!!

My FH loved this recipe and already wants me to make it again. I'm only rating it 4 stars because the seasoning stated wasn't enough for the chicken. I doubled the spices, but maintained the paprika as we don't love it that much. I also minced fresh garlic and onions and added it to the rub, applying it under the skin and all over. FH also loved the skin, which he usually skips.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Perfect cook time but a little flavorless and just tasted like chicken (lol).  Will double the spices in the future.

Used boneless, skinless thighs instead so I rubbed garlic-infused olive oil on them and then added the seasonings. I also used garlic and onion powders rather than salts .It only took  35 minutes, and they were moist and very good. This is going in our rotation! Thanks, Nicole. :)

I use skinless, boneless thighs, switch out onion and garlic powders for the salts and add rosemary, doubling all the herbs and spices along the way. Easily one of my husband's favorite chicken dishes and mine, too!

Skin was crispy but even though I doubled the spices it was only mildly seasoned.  Was pretty good but not spectacular.  May make again, may not.

These were pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought the flavor was pretty good.  I quadrupled the seasoning and it was just enough for 8 thighs.

Made this tonight using boneless skinless chicken thighs (that's what I had on hand).  Used garlic and onion powders rather than salts.  Smelled great when cooking, but the flavor was a little bland and boring.  Maybe I should have used salts instead?

Came out pretty good. I used garlic powder and onion powder  instead of the garlic and onion salts, just used regular salt instead because that's what I had on hand. Next time I will put more of the spice mixture underneath the skin.  It was crispy on top and tender on the inside.

I did not use this on thighs, instead I used chicken leg quarters and it came our perfect. I increased the measurements to a teaspoon for each spice. There was just enough to cover 4 of them.

I doubled the spices and only had 5 thighs but it ended up great and well seasoned for us. We're the type of people who almost always double the garlic in any recipe. It ended up being enough to rub under the skin and on the meat. The chicken came out beautifully, very tender, and next time I will use the tip of switching to broil for the last 5 minutes to make the skin even crispier.

It was pretty good!  I like an easy-peasy cooking :)  I followed the recipe, but added a squeeze of lemon on top of the chicken before putting it in the oven.  When it's done and ready to serve, I poured the juice from the chicken over the roasted chicken.  The juice was pretty good too, with a hint of lemon flavor. It became one of my routine recipe.  Thanks!

I made these with a mixture of chicken parts that I had in my freezer consisting of boneless/skinless thighs, legs and thighs (with bone) and 1 quarter leg/thigh.  I doubled the spices, and I used minced onion because I didn't have onion salt.  Onion didn't shake out evenly because the flakes were too big for the shaker I used.  The chicken despite being various pieces and sizes were juicy, some crispier than others and all very good!  Most definitely a keeper and cheap to make!

Easy, delicious, perfect juicy tender chicken and nice crisp skin. Husband and I both enjoyed it and I'm sure this will be in my regular dinner rotation. As others suggested, I separated the skin from the meat and season both (I like a lot of spice and flavor) and added a little cayenne pepper. Perfection!

I made this with boneless skinless thighs. The chicken was juicy but lacking in flavor. I will try it again with the bone-in thighs with skin, it would probably taste a whole lot better!!

What a fantastic and easy recipe! I bought a fairly huge portion of chicken thighs due to a ridiculous sale at Giant Eagle, and was looking for a tasty uncomplicated recipe. This fit the bill perfectly. Only change I made was to loosen the skin and put a significant portion of the spice mix directly on the thigh. BOOM, deliciousness ensued!

Boneless, skinless thighs turned out with great flavor tho not crispy. Used straight seasonings instead of salts, doubled them, mixed with melted butter and brushed on before baking.

Turned out crispy. Had to double the spices and could have used even more as I rubbed it on both sides and under the skin. I didn’t have dried thyme so I used poultry seasoning which lists  thyme as it’s first ingredient instead.  Like others, I used garlic and onion powder instead of salt, but added kosher salt. Thank you for the simple recipe!

Yummers  :-)

 I rub thighs with a little oil before seasoning them and 

put them on the baking sheet on a cooling 

rack...that way, they roast all around & they don't

sit in the fat...then, you still have the option of using the 

'drippings' to make gravy or sauce of your choice! YUM!

Thank You!

Well, changes were accidental.  I realized too late that I thawed boneless skinless chicken thighs.  So,  I  seasoned top and bottom with the  mix in the recipe, cooked them 35 minutes with foil loosely on, then put panko crumbs with melted butter, salt, and some Parmesan on top for 15 more without foil to finish.  Amazing with steamed broccoli and romaine/cuke salad with blue cheese.  My husband LOVED it. 
 And, no mess on my just-cleaned stovetop.   Based on another review, I will be making the Foreplay Pasta on this site as soon as I get fresh basil, to have with this. Thank you!

These are the best chicken thighs ever.  I make them all the time and am so grateful for the recipe!  Crispy skin.  Moist and tender meat.  Great seasoning.  I usually serve with some kind of rice blend.

Absolutely delicious! The chicken was tender and so moist, perfect! I seared the thighs first in a cast iron skillet and then popped them in the oven. It was extra crispy skin! Just as good as fried chicken without the grease. I'll use this recipe again, my family loved it!

I wouldn't say the spices made it crispy but I did enjoy the seasoning. I elevated the chicken on a rack in cookie sheet but didn't change a thing about recipe. Maybe next time I'll try bumping the temperature up to 375 or turning on broiler the last 5 to 10 minutes. The chicken was tasty and I would use the same seasoning again to cook chicken.

This was a yummy and simple recipe. I used boneless skinless thighs and followed the advice of using 2 TBSP meted butter, with the seasonings mixed in, and then brushing the seasoned butter onto the thighs -- and I only baked these for 20 min at 425 degrees. Awesome served with a side of brown rice and roasted brussell sprouts and sweet potatoes!

Delicious! We enjoyed them. I also made them for someone recovering from surgery and her husband. They loved it, too.

I put it on a rack as others suggested.  It wasn't as crispy as I thought it would be but the flavors were great!

I really appreciate how easy and yet tasty this recipe is!  I made some changes, based on the ingredients I had, but not enough to significantly change the basic recipe.  I used a package of breasts and drumsticks, b/c that's what we like.  They also cooked perfectly at the recommended 350 degrees for an hour.   For the spices, I used Tastefully Simple Seasoning Salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, smoked paprika and black pepper.  I decided to make white rice as a side dish, but decided to try cooking it with a can of tomato sauce in place of part of the water, and added garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  Might try it next time with chicken broth instead of the water portion.   It was a hit with my teenage son.  My other teenager loved the chicken, but he wasn't crazy about my rice concoction! 

Just wanted to also add that this would be perfect for serving a crowd for dinner.  It's so easy and tastes great!

I baked it straight from frozen at 375 for 1 hour on a slotted, greased pan. I threw all the spices into 1 Tbsp of melted butter and brushed them on. Turned out amazing!

For such a simple recipe, it's pretty tasty. I was skeptical and wondered if it would have much flavor, so I doubled the amount of spices used. I used 1/2 of each instead of 1/4, mixed them altogether, and applied liberally. The whole house smelled good. I'd definitely make it again. Oh! And yes, the skin was crispy.

This is so simple & delicious. Since I didn't have the exact spices I used Italian seasoning. This dish is a keeper. Everyone raved.

I assume  this is really good to people who prefer white meat to thighs.  But, for those of us who really like chicken thighs, these are extremely dry.  The skin is very good and crunchy, but they are cooked so long, that the meat is dry.

I like the recipe overall and the chicken thighs came out well. Unfortunately out of habit I remove the skin so this was a skinless thigh. Overall it came out nice, but the next time I plan to reduce the thyme that came out a bit strong for my taste. Maye I will add a little Cajun seasoning to spice it so very slightly.

I followed the recipe exactly, other than I didn't have garlic salt or onion salt. I added 1/4 tsp salt and used garlic powder, and onion powder, as others suggested. While it was "adequate," it was quite frankly uninspiring and unimaginative. And now I have another 6 thighs to eat, which will need to be jazzed up somehow.

I'm not sure I should post this because while I made the rub almost exactly as specified, I cooked the chicken in a way that I learned in some other cooking video (that I can't find now) that is very different from this recipe.
First, I put the rub on the flesh side (not the skin side) of the chicken.
Next, I heated a skillet in the oven until it was very hot, then took it out of the oven, oiled it, and put the chicken skin side down on the skillet. I returned it to the oven and changed the setting to broil. The chicken is now being heated from below from the skillet and above from the broiling. The skin gets crispy from the heated skillet, and the top side is cooked by the broiler.
It was excellent. I credit the spice rub of course, not my way of cooking it :).

I’ve made this quite a few times. It’s delicious! I always put olive oil at the bottom of the pan and I double the spices. My boyfriend and I make this almost every two weeks. Super easy and tasty.

Spice blend was really good, but skin did not crisp up like I'd hoped, and at that temperature, I was suspicious.  I've had much more success crisping it up in a pan, flipping it, THEN putting into the oven.

I used bone-in but skinless thighs. The herb/spice mix was pretty good and gave a lot of flavor to the chicken. The chicken thighs I used were on the small size, they only took 45 minutes to cook.
I will make this again with skin on thighs. As the skin will keep the chicken moist and looking more appetizing ..

I made it in my gas RV oven.  With the rack on the very top rung I find things don't burn...i ended up having to cook it for about 1 1/2 hours.  Followed the recipe exactly. Sprinkled both sides and added a little more salt on top.  WOW! Amazing!  Delicious! I like to pour the drippings over the top of them yum. I will definitely make these again. I would have taken a pic but they were gone before I could.

Somewhat disappointed as the thighs were dry.  I checked the temperature at 50 minutes and they were overdone.  I'd start checking at around 40 minutes next time.

Hands-down, one of my family's favorite meals. It's the seasoning blend that is outstanding. So much so, that I make it in large batches to have on hand for a quick meal. I've used every type of chicken as well - thighs, breasts, legs, etc. skin on/off and it's delicious every way. I am heavy handed with the seasoning as well. I've also used it to season a pork roast as well. My children request it and when I announce it's tonight's meal - cheers! (Which does NOT happen often, so it's nice to have a fool-proof family pleasing meal to go to on busy nights.) Enjoy!

I've made this dish three times and I absolutely love it. The changes I made were minor. I sprinkled seasoning on the underside of the chicken before laying it in the pan and also sprinkled some under the skin before sprinkling some on the outside of the chicken. Because of this additional use of seasoning I had to double the amount of the seasoning. I also cooked the chicken at 375 instead of 350. By the way I had some leftover seasoning from the last time I made this and sprinkle it on chicken wings tonight and threw them in the oven on 400. They came out great!

This was a huge hit with my family, even my picky eaters! The leftovers were just as good if not better. I made extra of the seasoning mix and used it on sauteed potatoes. It was the perfect match.

Didn't change a thing to the recipe.  Used Skin on -bone in -thighs ( 1/2 t of all seasonings for 4 thighs).  Flipped thighs to brown evenly last 20 minutes - and broiled an extra 2 minutes to crisp the skin.  Fabulous!

Delicious!!! I tripled the seasonings and cooked for one hour plus broiled for 1 minute. I did find it a tad salty for my liking so next time I'll use powder instead of the salt. Either way it was great, definitely crispy, tender, and juicy! Thank you for such a great recipe!!

Made as is, but substituted onion and garlic powder for the salts and added in a 1/4 tsp salt to replace it. Broiled for 1-2 minutes at the end as per suggested. YUM!

We picked up some thighs, legs and wings at the store over the weekend, looked on here for a good recipe to try tonight. Read a bunch of reviews and watched the video, decided to give this one a try. Glad I did.  Followed the recipe verbatim except made the dry rub with 1 tsp of each ingredient. Sprinkled on both sides of thighs and all around legs. Unfortunately, the wings wouldn't fit the pan - will do those next time :o) Sprayed a rack with Pam and placed on top of the foil lined baking sheet, then turned them 1/2 way through. Great flavor and texture. Not greasy since drippings were in pan below rack. Went perfect with mashed potatoes, gravy  from drippings and green beans. I posted a pic but it went somewhere else? Big thumbs up. Gonna try this approach with my Chipotle BBQ dry rub sometime soon, too. Thanks for posting.

My husband loved it, so I certainly will make it again.  I didn't have any thyme, so I used Italian seasoning. I only had four thighs, but I doubled the seasoning anyway. I highly recommend this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I tripled the spice mix because the amount in the recipe wasn't enough.  The chicken tasted good, but it definitely wasn't crispy.

I more than doubled the spice rub, adding garlic powder, and yes, rubbed under the skin. Very nice blend of spices and did broil to crisp at the end. Thanks!

I used  skinless chicken thighs and drizzled avocado oil on top.  Added spices, omitted the salt.  Very easy to make  and flavor full.  BUT, nothing special.

This is my go to recipe when I want to fix easy chicken thighs. I use garlic and onion powders and add regular salt at the end. Also smoked paprika and cayenne, anything in my spice cabinet that remotely make sense. Very forgiving as chicken is so versatile!

Delicious.  Used boneless skinless breasts - they were seasoned perfectly and crisped up nice.  Baked them for 25 minutes instead of 1 hour.

I cooked them on a bed of onions and then moved the chicken onto a broiled pan to allow any excess fat drip off while I finished the rest of my meal prep.  Super yummy!

Taste amazing! I put the oven for 360°, seasoned both sides and added a bit of adobo seasoning. Left it in the oven for 1 hour and 10 min. And broiled for 2. My family loved It! Will definitely make again!

Love this- great for having groups of people over! I didn't have all the dried spices but subbed non-dehydrated herbs and onion and garlic and just chopped them all very fine. So delicious. Major hit. People who came over saying they hadn't already eaten ate these!

I tried it as written,  just doubled the spice amounts, for a larger batch of chicken, but no pepper. It was very good and simple. The skin could have been crisper.
I cooked it on a rack in a shallow pan.
I would recommend turning the chicken to get even crisping, 
I would do this again, quick and simple.

This recipe is so simile and delicious. I rubbed the seasonings under the skin as well as sprinkling the outside of the skin. It was crisp and flavorful, just as the name suggests.

I marinated the thighs for 4 hours, after removing the skin. I used canola oil, lemon juice,  granulated garlic, salt, pepper, cumin and Penzey spices' Northwoods fire. Then put them in the oven at 400 for 45 mins. Also quartered a potato and rubbed it with olive oil, garlic powder,  salt, pepper and romano cheese and put them in the same pan with the 3 chicken thighs. Came out fantastic! !

I followed the recipe exactly . Chicken hit temperature and were moist but  were not crispy. The house smelled good though.

I will be using this humble recipe when I have company. My word, it is delicious, and my husband loved it.  I increased the spices to 3/4 tsp and used generously. (If using eight thighs or more I would increase the spices to 1 tsp each.) I live at 7800 ft altitude so using the automatic temperature gauge was very helpful. I baked five chicken thighs 1 1/2 hours at 350. I roasted vegetables as the side: onions, cubed sweet potatoes, squash, and green peppers tossed in olive oil, then baked just  as the chicken. I placed both dishes on the middle rack in the oven and they were done at the same time. I also served this with rice on the side. If I were allowed to give this another star I would. The simplicity and flavor of the chicken will amaze you. Crispy, crunchy, succulent. Yum!!

This will definitely be added to my regular dinner rotation. Made almost exactly as stated. Only changes were that I only had 4 chicken thighs, so I didn't have to cook for a full hour, and I had double the amount of seasoning so I put some underneath the skin as well as on top of it. But the ingredients themselves were left exactly as the recipe called for. It was the first time in a long time that I didn't have to fight my picky toddlers about eating their dinner--they both gobbled this chicken right up with no complaints!

Couldn't have been any easier. The chicken was still juicy and the skin was crispy. Very tasty. The only change I made was using onion powder and garlic powder and then added salt.

I have made it twice.  I followed recipe exactly, except 2nd time didn't have garlic salt.  It was delicious the first time.  I have one question.  The seasoning was not enough to cover 5 thighs, so I made more.  Am I using too much on thighs

I made half the amount of chicken and only garlic, onion, and paprika. It turned out great. It was very easy and I will make it again.

This is my go-to chicken seasoning now.  I have the seasoning mixed in larger shaker jar in my cupboard & just grab it when we get the craving for crispy delicious chicken - and have used it on pork chops/steaks too.  I don't even measure now, just coat the thighs and bake!  only one suggestion (& reason for 4star rating): double the amount of seasoning to get the best flavor - first time chicken was just a bit bland, but decided to try  again with more of the seasoning and that did it! Thanks for sharing Nicole

This well a very good recipe.  I followed the suggestions on adding more of the seasoning and I also used a broiling pan.  It was super easy and was quite a hit!  I highly recommend this one.

The skin was more dry (and perhaps a bit leathery) than crispy but they were juicy and overall pretty tasty.

We bith really loved this recipe.  I changed a few things:  used egg beaters, minced fresh garlic, and used gluten-free flour.  Was amazing with a vinegar/oil salad and 1/2 sweet potatoe.

This recipe is fantastic! I did double the spice mixture as I had seen some reviewers mention, and we traditionally like things very well seasoned.  I roasted some potatoes and parsnips in a separate pan, and poured the juices over them and let them roast an additional ten minutes once the chicken was done.  My husband and I both loved it, and this will definitely be in serious dinner rotation.

I added some extra seasonings for my families tastes and they LOVED it...  definitely will make this again.  The chicken browned very nicely... didn't need to broil it at all!

I've made this four Sundays in a row. My daughter and husband love this. I buy a ten pack of thighs and I make the seasoning recipe using two tsps of all the listed ingredients. I also cover the meat first with a generous amount of seasonings, then put the skin back over and cover that with the seasonings. I put the thighs on a rack in a deep roasting pan lined with foil. It does get to be quite a bit of juice in the pan and the chicken cooks better raised up a bit. Delicious!!

This is a delicious spice blend! I would have given this five stars except I did not follow the instructions exactly. Instead, I marinated 4 chicken thighs in 4 parts olive oil to 1 part apple cider vinegar and added the spice blend, with the same 1/4 teaspoon measurements, to the marinade. I used garlic and onion powders, instead of garlic and onion salts, for everything.  For baking them, I used 1/2 teaspoon of every spice and 1 teaspoon of salt, and I sprinkled each thigh with a good coating of it.  I baked it for about 40 minutes and my family liked the skin, even though it wasn't quite crispy.

Easy to make and tastes really good. I was surprised how juicy the inside was and how crispy the skin turned out.

I made this and love it. Even my family loves it (I'm not a very good cook, but wife is worse. It's OK, she admits that.). I keep a plastic container  full of this stuff and sprinkle it on liberally whenever I make chicken thighs. I just coat both sides real well (I like a lot), place the thighs in my big iron skillet and bake it per the author's instructions for an hour and they come out terrific. This makes for one very cheap and easy meal. Thanx for sharing this!

This was so good!  I didn't expect much because it's such a simple recipe to make but, wow, so tender, juicy and flavorful.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and threw in some baby carrots and they roasted in the pan juices and were delicious.  This is a keeper and will be making an appearance a lot.  Thanks for the terrific recipe.

I will definitely make this again.  It was crazily easy and very flavourful.  My only change to the recipe was to use boneless thighs, as that was what I had .  Consequently I cooked them for 30 minutes not for an hour.

Great recipe! Perfect bone-in chicken thighs (got on special at Aldi's for 67 cents a lb). Skin was perfectly crunchy and the simple rub was tasty. This is a keeper!

It was very juicy and delicious!!  The skin was not crispy though, but leaving it on does keep the meat nice and tender.  I removed the skin right before eating because I don't like skin.  I also doubled the seasoning an I made gravy with the drippings.  Tonight I served it with rice and mixed vegetables.  I might do potatoes next time.  Just remeber to use a rimmed baking sheet, otherwise the drippings will drip to the bottom of your oven and you will burn your house down like I almost did!

Created this great tasting baked chicken following recipe as exactly stated.  It is quick to assemble and easy clean up when using foil to line pan.   Will be using this recipe again and again.

Great recipe! I used a baking rack to elevate the chicken and it took a little longer, but it was crispy and juicy. I also mixed a little more of the spices and sprinkled them under and on top of the skin. I will definitely keep this recipe!

We love this recipe and make it regularly. I scale the recipe to make 32 servings and mix up the spices ahead of time, storing them in a spice jar. The meal can be made much more quickly and multiple times this way.

I recommend applying the spices liberally to both sides of the chicken thghs before baking.

What a quick and easy dish.  I followed one of the suggestions.  I pulled the skin up and added the seasoning to the meat, and then I added it on top of the skin.  I only made 4 thighs.  Next time if I make 8, I will double the amount of seasoning.  Give it a try.  You'll love it.

Made it per recipe and my family didn't really get excited about it.  All the seasoning was on the skin, so the meat didn't have any flavor.  Skin was crispy and it was good.

Nice enough, good flavor, and skin nice and crispy. For those who didn't get crispy skin consider one of the following (IMHO the most likely causes in order):
Did not dry thighs adequately, over seasoned, perhaps needed finishing with broiler (oven variation).

This was fantastic!  I only had four chicken thighs, but I used all the spice mix anyway.  I didn't have ground thyme, so I crushed some dried thyme leaves instead.  The chicken was done in 50 minutes.  I served it with white and wild rice. My picky boyfriend actually said, "mmmm". LOL!   Will definitely be making this delicious and easy recipe again.

Made this last night, followed recipe exactly - delicious! I didn't have a rack to set thighs on so I set the timer and every 15 minutes I drained the fat so they weren't sitting in it. So easy! Highly recommend!!

Amazing but needed a little more salt.  I made three thighs instead of 8 (only because it is just the boyfriend and me).  I used the measurements given but still used a dash of everything over the chicken before I put them in the oven.  Definitely making this again.

Made tonight and loved it. I took the suggestions of a few reviews and doubled the seasoning. I also put the chicken in a zip lock bag with the seasoning and a bit of olive oil (just eyed it) to coat the chicken better. I put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes before baking. This one is a keeper.

Cooked perfectly! I was worried (as I often am when cooking poultry) that the texture would turn out displeasing, but boy was I wrong! Tender and juicy yet crispy and tasty!! I'm definitely gonna make this again. I'm Cajun and love a little spice, I added crushed red pepper flakes and substituted the garlic salt for garlic powder because I didn't have any. I also added a a squeeze of lime that I had leftover. Came out amazing! So simple.

Very good and easy recipe- and I would definitely make it again. I would make more of the seasoning mix- just to give it a little extra- but definitely yum!

I used crushed up sage and onion flavored croutons for the coating. Place chicken on rack on top of pan. This made the bottom of chicken crispy also.

I made this last night using skinless chicken thighs. I dipped them in melted butter before adding the spices. I also baked them for 45 minutes. All 3 of my kids really liked it!

I don't eat much meat usually, but I loved the taste of this chicken so much I picked the bones clean! Then I bought more chicken and made a bunch of freezer meals with this recipe. So easy to make, so delicious to eat. New family staple!

This was really good.  I made it with boneless skinless thighs, and Italian Seasoning instead of oregano and thyme.  I added 1/8 teaspoon of salt since I only had onion powder and garlic powder.  I will definitely make this again.  I didn't adjust the baking time, even though I didn't have boneless.  Halfway through, I added carrots to the pan.  I used a rack for the chicken, and turned it halfway through and seasoned the other side.  Delicious!

this came out really well, and the chicken was still nice and tender without having a cover over it. i didn't have all the ingredients so i used salt, pepper, garlic powder, basil, onion powder, and cumin. the skin came out nice and crispy! and i took the advice of previous reviews and added the spices under the skin for more flavor.

Made this for dinner and it was yummy! Would have been better if I had a wire rack to drain the juices to make it crispier but I broiled it for the last 8mins or so. I added lemon juice to this and it's amazing! Thanks for the recipe.

Mixed the spices but used garlic and onion powders instead of salts. Added sea salt to the mixture to make up for it. Loved the rub. I cooked the chicken thighs on an oiled rack above a cookie sheet. 400F for 45-50 minutes gives crisp skin and a moist chicken.  5 stars for the rub. I don't know how other cooks are getting crispy skin at 350F though.

So easy and so good! Made it exactly like the original recipe, although I didn't measure the spices, and I did mix quite a bit because I had 9 large thighs. I did add a pat of butter under the skin of each thigh for extra moisture since this is baked without aluminum foil to keep the steam in. The smell in the house had everyone hungry and we all agree that this one is a keeper!

Excellent!  The skin is fabulous - I didn't measure that exactly - just sprinkled each item into a bowl until it looked like enough.  I also used a little Mrs. Dash's seasoning and Lawrey's seasoned salt.  I will definitely make again and my husband agreed!

Put spices (used 1 tsp of each) under skin and on top of skin.   Added melted butter before roasting on rack.  Cooked for 1 hr at 350 degrees.  Turned out great.

Made as written and it was very easy to make. The skin was nice and crispy. The chicken was very juicy. Plenty of flavor.  Threw in a couple of potatoes to bake as a side. Put this recipe in the make it again file.

This continues to be my go-to recipe for a quick dinner.  Love how the spices crisp up the skin.  I've made this so often, I have the spices ready to go in a sealed container.  I do bake the chicken at 375* and only for 40 minutes.

Very good recipe!  I used 8 chicken thighs, so i doubled the spices and it took an hour to bake.  I did put chicken in broiler for 2 mins for extra crispiness.  Next time i think i will also put spices under the skin to better flavor the meat.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe with crispy skin and juicy inside. I made a 5 lb. box of chicken and increased the seasonings to 1-1/2 tsp. of each. I didn't have onion salt so I used dried onion flakes. I sprinkled the garlic salt straight on to the chicken before putting on the other blend of seasonings. Five shakas from a Hawaii fan!

This turned out perfect. Took the cue from another reviewer that said place chicken directly on rack and place the drip pan below. Served with roast carrots and roast potatoes in duck fat. Duck fat...you can't go wrong!

As a lifelong vegetarian this was my first time ever making chicken thighs, and they turned out great.  We already had all of the spices on hand (other than onion powder rather than onion salt) so that made it so easy.  The only thing I did differently was quadruple all of the spices, and mixed them together in a ramekin then sprinkled them on each chicken thigh with a little spoon.  Though I did not eat them myself, my boyfriend really loved them.  Thank you for the great recipe--making chicken doesn't seem so scary now!

I doubled the spices and followed the rest of the directions as written. Easy and came out perfectly - crispy, tender, and delicious. Definitely in the regular rotation! Thanks!!

My usual recipe bakes for 50 minutes at 200 C, so this was more juicy, but the skin was still crisp.
I added 1/4 t each of cayenne and cumin to make it spicier, and used 750g chicken thighs (5) for 2 people.

This was a winner for our family.  I have kids that are picky eaters, so I didn't add any of the herbs.  I did rub the seasoning under the skin. And I did broil for the last two minutes. The skin was so crispy and the meat was so tender!  My kids all wanted seconds and I only had one left, so we had to share it.  Will definitely make this each week!

This was good--and like everyone said, the skin comes out crispy!  I will make it again--but, I will pull back the skin and sprinkle the seasoning on the meat.  I pull the skin off my chicken and the skin had all the flavor.

I used my own homemade marinade that I soaked the chicken thighs in for a good 24 hours, then put them in a metal baking pan and dusted the tops of the chicken with some more seasoning, then cooked for 1 hour at 350 degrees, then broiled it for the last few minutes to get that skin extra crispy. Probably the best chicken I've ever made in the oven. Absolutely delicious!!! Try it out, you wont regret it

We really enjoyed this chicken. The only change I made was to replace a SMALL amount of the black pepper with cayenne pepper as we like things a little hot! I plan to make it again.

This chicken came out very tender and the skin was nice and crispy ..  the only thing I will change when I make it again is definitely double if not triple the spices and put some under the skin as some of the other reviews suggested.. I will leave out the oregano  just because I'm not a fan ... but will definitely make it again

Great recipe! Took another reviewers advice and seasoned under the skin. Also I baked it on a cooling rack placed in the baking sheet to let it get crispy all around.

This is now my go-to seasoning for chicken.  In fact, I've even put it into an empty paprika shaker so I always have it on hand.  Throw in some potatoes, carrots, whatever veggies for a delicious one dish meal. Make as directed for perfect chicken thighs.  I've also used this seasoning for beer can chicken, as a rub on the grill... it's great all around!

The skin was crispy as stated by other reviewers.  I rubbed the seasoning directly onto the meat, under the skin, as well as on top.  I will double the seasoning next time and add a bit more salt.  My family and I loved the flavor and it was very easy to make.   I served it with a side of rice and steamed broccoli.

Pros
*Easy - This recipe requires very little hands-on time.
*No exotic ingredients
*Delicious

Con (sort of)
*Cooks for 1 hour.  That is only a con, because sometimes busy families can't wait that long for dinner to be ready.

I tripled the spices, and I placed them under the skin.  I also cooked the chicken pieces on a baking rack.  The skin was so crispy and delicious.  This recipe works great with roasted vegetables.  (Toss 1-inch pieces of potato, sweet potato, and carrots in Olive Oil.  Salt to taste.  Place vegetables on a separate baking sheet, and cook for ~45 minutes.)

I will try this with breasts next time.

I used 4 thighs and added a quartered potato and some whole carrots, doubled the spices and baked in convection oven for about 45 to 50 minutes.  Perfect one dish meal, will definitely make again.  Thank You.

I brushed the chicken with oil before I seasoned it. Seasoning was barely enough for 4 pieces, I had to add more, so make some extra to begin with. I used garlic powder and onion powder so I had to add some salt as well. Then, 40 minutes into the cooking I added, sliced onions, green pepper, sliced tomato and mushrooms. It turned out great and was a complete meal. Skin was crispy, chicken and veggies were cooked to perfection and even my finicky eater husband loved it. I will definitely make it again.

My  only change was to omit onion salt since I don't use  it.
I doubled the ingredients and it was great for the 6 thighs I had.
We will be having this again next week.  Thanks for such an easy and tasty idea.

Absolutely loved them.  Had enough juices for a great gravy.  I didn't have parsley so I used poultry seasoning.

Delish!!!

Simple and tasty. Worked great as a dinner in the oven while I'm gone with my son for 45 minutes. Come home to a meal that's nearly made. Just add boil in a bag rice and some steamed broccoli. Dinner was ready 10 min after getting home. Perfect for the school night after after after school activities.

I usually don't make bone-in chicken because I can never seem to get the skin crispy enough, unless I make fried chicken. I had 2 bone-in chicken thighs and really enjoyed this dish. The seasonings really help crisp the skin in the oven. I never have the onion and garlic salts because I'm too heavy handed with them...or maybe they just contain too much salt for this salt lover! I subbed for onion and garlic powder, and added some salt and pepper. Also, I recommend adding a little of the seasoning under the skin, but it's not necessary (use most of the seasoning on the skin as recipe indicates).  If you don't care for the skin, the chicken meat will have some of the seasoning too. Measurements were fine for us as well as the cooking time--chicken was moist. Overall, great quick and easy recipe, which I would not hesitate to make again!

This has joined out regular dinner rotation. Even the kids eat it. Has enough flavor that it isn't bland but not so much kick that it's too much for us. Thighs are so inexpensive which is an added bonus. The leftovers are good cold out of the fridge. I make exactly as written. I need to make a container of the spices all ready mixed to make this dinner even easier.

Followed the recipe exactly as written, minus onion salt and paprika as I didn't have any. This chicken was so good! The skin comes out crispy every time, and so flavourful.

Wow!!! I wasn't expecting much, as I was using frozen thighs on sale from the store but we couldn't stop eating them! The skin was crispy and so good, the chicken was moist and delicious. Easy to do, I had it in the oven in like 2 minutes while holding a baby. Amazing! This is now my go-to recipe! I didn't change anything, no need.

Although the meat was very juicy, the skin was not crispy. It had  more of a soft texture rather than a crispy texture. Overall this was still a great recipe which I will use and keep as one of my favorites :)

I didn't have cooking spray so I used a paper tower to spread olive oil on the aluminium foil. I cooked the chicken for 1h00 and the internal temperature was 170-175. It was perfectly cooked. The chicken was so good. Crispy from the outside and juicy from the inside.

Turned out perfect. I used boneless skinless thighs.  I tripled the seasoning for about 12 thighs. I heavily seasoned the thighs and placed them in the oven. However at the end, I brushed them with some olive oil, they were starting to look dry on top. But they came out perfect. My 5 year olds kept saying yumm while they were eating and asked for seconds. Definitely will keep this in rotation.

Made it exactly as the recipe states and it came out delicious.  Was worried it might be too salty, with both onion and garlic salt, but it was perfect.  I did double the seasonings, and used the extra on some potatoes I baked along with the chicken, and they were delicious too.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I've made this at least 30 times since discovering it about 4 months ago-tonight I'm making it with the intention of layering homemade barbecue sauce on it.

This technique is crazy good and yields delicious tender chicken meat and cracker crisp skin.

I've tried a myriad of different spice and herb combinations , but my favorite has to be salt, pepper, garlic powder, a bit of paprika, oregano and a good sprinkling of Old Bay seasoning. No matter what spice and herbs you use the skin is always crisp and delicious!

As I do, with all recipes  I find, I twist it to make it seem my own creation.  I basically used 4 large chicken thighs (bone in with skin) and I doubled all the spices and took the time to coat all sides of the chicken, not just the top.  It's probably my oven, but I used an Instant Read Thermometer and felt the chicken was under cooked at the suggested time frame.  I added 10 minutes, gave me heat perfect and the chicken was NOT overcooked.  So my recommendation is to use an instant read thermometer to ensure you are safely feeding your family.

Love this recipe. I usually use the given quantity of spice mix to only 3 thighs to fully coat, and spread some good mustard on before sprinkling the spices on. One of my favorites!

I had a very similar recipe at my daughter's home recently that was simply delicious. For years I have been baking boneless skinless chicken breast and I really liked the flavor of the seasoned thighs. So I found this recipe and made a version of it tonight. I didn't have all of the spices so I used what I had. I also had purchased skinless boneless thighs and broiled them the last few minutes. Mine turned out good yet not as juicy as everyone talked about. I have a brand new range and I am still learning about convection cooking, which is faster than conventional. So I will definitely be making this again with room to improve! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe with a bit of disappointment at the end.  I did not broil at the but the "Crispy" did not show up.  However the seasoning is very good.  I read another cooks advise and seasoned both under the skin and on it.  I would make again but will broil to crisp the skin.

This blend of seasonings made for an easy and moist chicken thigh. Depending on the thickness of the thighs the time should be monitored. One thing I added at the very end is parmesan cheese at the moment I let the chicken rest for 10 mins.

Wow! Easy & so-o-o Tasty!! Used the tin foil tip so there was no clean-up... Thank-you for this awesome recipe because my Hubby usually doesn't care for dark meat and he raved!

Loved how crispy it turned out. I removed the skin before cooking, then added all of the spices to the chicken. I doubled the spice recipe and thickened the juice for a delicious gravy. I didn't have onion salt so I used onion powder. I adjusted the garlic & oregano for a double recipe used 3 cloves fresh garlic and 2 tsp fresh oregano instead of the dry. The flavor was delicious. I will be making this again soon.

I made this today, but I did it on my gas grill. Why should I heat up my kitchen? I'm in Arizona. Only two of us so only two thighs and cut the spice ingredients in half.  I grilled over Indirect heat on my gas grill. Indirect on a grill is the same as an oven. They were done in about 50 minutes.  They turned out awesome! Tender inside, crispy on the outside. I will make these again many more times, on the grill. I wouldn't change a thing.

Really good! Definitely comes out crispy, but I found that 1 hour at 350F didn't cook my chicken properly for some reason, so had to turn up the heat. Other than that, tasty.

The recipe is easy and the chicken turned out excellent. It was just as crispy and as juicy as the title states, with great flavor. I  followed the recipe as written and will use it again but value it for it's versatility when wanting to spice it up. My husband, who doesn't like eating anything off the bone has requested I make this more often.

The only change I made was that I used this spice mixture for a whole roasted chicken... it was crispy and over-the-moon delicious! Left overs made a fantabulous homemade chicken soup! Yep - I'd make it again, and again, and again, and again...

Update 6/22/2017 - I use this spice blend so much that I quadruple the spices and store them in a spice jar with shaker lid. Really comes in handy for a quick meal. I even use it for other things like soups that call for chicken. It's a great all purpose. I just label my spice jar "Chicken Seasonong." Many thanks to the originator of this recipe!! ??

We love this recipe and always use it for chicken thighs. Here's a tip you might find useful, I mix a tablespoonful of each spice, then mix together and store it in an empty spice jar. Then a few shakes on you thighs and into the oven.

Made this tonight for dinner and it came out pretty good.  I made the seasoning exactly expect I used onion powder instead of onion salt.  I doubled the seasoning and seasoned 5 thighs all over, but should have done under the skin.  I cut up come carrots, quartered potatoes and onions and lined the bottom of a baking dish with them.  I used the rest of the seasoning on the veggies and placed the chicken on top of them.  Baked at 350 for 1hr 20 minutes and came out real good.  I did need to add a little salt to the chicken, but otherwise it came out good.

Only made 3 thighs to try it out. Didn't measure, but I used a lil red pepper flake, fresh ground Italian seasoning, garlic & onion powders, smoked paprika, fresh ground black pepper & sea salt, then spritzed them with some coconut oil. Paired it with some Brussels sprouts & baby carrots that I seasoned up & roasted. Delicious! Definitely a repeat for when I'm stuck for meal ideas!

I will make this again!  Triple the spices and add salt .  Take the skin completely off the thigh and set aside. Clean thighs of excess fat. Sprinkle spices on the meat and place on baking sheet.  Take the skin that was set aside and sprinkle with spices and place one back on top of each thigh.  And bake according to the directions.  No need to broil. Delicious chicken and crispy skin!  Wonderful flavor.

An easy recipe, similar to baking a whole chicken, except here we use thighs. I had 3 huge thighs which I washed and patted dry with paper towels and then trimmed off the excess skin, which was a good move because it reduced the amount of oil that extracts from the fat. I used garlic and onion powder and dried oregano and thyme, and added a little salt, but I winged the measurements, which I think was much more than the recipe called for, but I was happy because it was delicious. I tested my chicken after 30 minutes, but there was still some pink, so left it in another 20 minutes, and then rested it for 15 minutes and it was perfect. The skin was crisp and flavourful, the chicken was so moist and tasty and fell off the bone. With this technique, next time I will try a different spice mix for variation and I'm sure it'll be just as delicious!

I love this because it is so easy but tastes fancy.  To make it faster and healthier, we use skinless boneless thighs now.  Not as crispy without the skin, but it tastes great!  Takes about 30 minutes for boneless thighs.

I have made this with skinless breasts as well as with thighs and breasts that have skin. After two years of using this recipe the only change I've ever made was smoked paprika in place of regular paprika because I didn't have any on hand, both ways taste great. A quick easy and delicious chicken.

I'm giving it four stars because it is what it says it is: crispy and tender.  Like other reviewers, i sprinkled some of the spice blend under the skin. Not doing so would have made me give it three stars since there's just a subtle flavor, nothing like 'whammo' or anything. I am thinking that doubling the spices and putting half under the skin and half on the skin might be a good idea, because right now the chicken is good, but not great. I'll try that and let you know! :)

This was excellent! I omitted the garlic and onion salt and oregano and instead used Lipton onion soup mix with the paprika and thyme. The cooking instructions are right on. I did not turn them over as some suggested. The skin was crisp and chicken juicy with great taste as promised!

Loved this recipe! I did make a few changes (ofcourse!) I used leg quarters because that's what I had & I boiled the chicken 1st to render some fat & loosen the skin for easy removal. Then I put it in the oven for 25 minutes at 450 degrees (while my rice cooker worked it's magic). I doubled the seasonings (as others suggested) & I only had garlic & onion POWDER so I added a 1/4 tsp salt. Turned out perfectly crisp on the outside & juicy in the middle! Big hit for my picky eaters!! My go-to chicken seasoning from now on! Thanks!

I used 3 chicken whole legs and 1 tbsp olive oil. I also doubled all the spices. and replaced paprika with cayenne pepper. I added 3/4 tsp salt as I used normal garlic and onion powder.
After baking for exactly 1 hour, the chicken looked a bit dry but it was juicy upon eating. Will make again.

Double the seasoning because we love extra kick! Great recipe but I think the thyme overpowers a bit I will scale back on that particular seasoning  next time.

Very good. Made them last week, and I have some thighs out on the counter right now and asked hubby how he would like them and he said "do them the way you did the last time"...so for me that makes it a 5 star. Very crispy, but microwave reheat makes skin blah and soggy and you have to take it off, otherwise these are great!

I really liked this recipe, but my 9 year old didn't care for the spices.  (He painstakingly scraped them off.  It was hard to watch). I used skinless, boneless thighs, and drizzled olive oil over the thighs, and they were a little dry, but not too bad (I tend to overcook chicken most of the time, and this time was no exception).  I'd definitely make these again, but just make some plain thighs for the kiddo.

I  just add the seaso inside the meat and skinand I also add little of extra olive oil on top of the skin it make more extra crispy. Just watch it before it was done. Don't let is burn too long.. My family loves it! And I will make it again, they were very easy to make.

Very good recipe! Crispy skin, juicy on the inside! Very easy and simple to make. The hardest part I had was just too defrost the chicken and that wasn't bad at all. 
The only changes I made was I used onion powder because I didn't have any onion salt. I didn't have any thyme so I didn't do that. Also I didn't have any cooking spray, so I just put a little olive oil on the tin foil. I served with salad and a stroganoff noodle pack, those 7 min side dishes. Over all I loved it, and I will make again!! Thank you for the recipe

The recipe is very easy, and you end up with moist meat and crispy skin.  I use garlic and onion powders instead of salts, so I can better control the salt.  As others have suggested, I double all the spices then add 1/4 teaspoon salt.

I love this recipe.  I double the spices and bake at 400 degrees for one hour.  The chicken is extra crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  Great recipe.  Thanks Nicole Burdett.

My husband loved this dish, he is a picky eater raved how crispy and tender the chicken was.
I made the recipe exactly as stated like others used onion and garlic powder instead  of salt plus I  tossed the chicken in olive & garlic oil before I put the seasonings on then I tossed again laid on rack on the baking sheet and it turned out great.

I thought this was a great thigh recipe, especially if you throw it under the broiler and get that skin nice a crispy.  I only used four chicken thighs though and double the spice recipe.  That's my only problem with the recipe is not enough rub.  Loved it though after plenty of seasoning!!

I made this recipe using boneless, skinless chicken thighs because it was what I had and I wanted to make something easy for dinner tonight. While this was easy, I discovered I'm not particularly fond of the oregano flavor on the chicken. I love it in Italian dishes and was surprised to find I didn't care for it in this dish.

My family enjoyed this recipe!  My young boys (10 & 7) even cleaned their plates.  I do plan to make it again,  but will not put it into our regular rotation until I can figure out how to make the flavor  more consistent  in every bite.  I may need to marinade in the rub or do a little something extra.  Don't know yet, but I am giving it 4 stars for a simply good fulfilling Monday night dinner meal.  We are pleased!!!

Chicken came out crispy & tender as promised!! Next time I will triple up on the seasonings. Double  just wasn't quite enough as I sprinkled some of the seasoning under the skin right onto the chicken as well as on top. I also cooked the chicken on a rack over a cookie sheet so the chicken didn't sit in the fat while cooking. The flavor was amazing. I will definitely be making this again!!! Thank you for the recipe!!

Excellent! Everyone loved the crispy skin. I used onion powder instead of onion salt, we have to watch salt intake. I threw in some red potatoes and roasted them at the same time and temp. Broiled everything for about two minutes at the end! Yum! Quick and easy.

I made this for dinner and am very happy with it.  It was moist and very tasty.  The skin was crunchy  and perfectly spiced.  I broiled it for 1 minute and that was all that was needed.

definitely will be making again. so simple, but yet so tasty. i really thought it would be so so. i picked it because it was simple. the only change i made was i used thyme flakes because i did not have the ground thyme. you can't go wrong with this recipe. i don't change ingredients from original recipes . when you do that--you have a whole new recipe.

This was surprisingly very delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I swapped onion and garlic powder for the onion and garlic salt. I didn't think it would taste as great as it did because the recipe was so simple, but it was crispy and juicy as promised. Glad I tried it.

It seemed strange at first to just put these simple spices on top of a chicken, I thought it would come out dry. But it came out perfect - just as described: "Crispy and Tender". And it was very delicious. Simple healthy recipes that taste this good are such gems. I don't know why anyone would eat "Shake'NBake" garbage when you could make this instead.

This is a very simple and tasty recipe. Chicken thighs have been on sale lately and this is the perfect recipe for delicious and inexpensive meal. I made the recipe as is, though I placed some of the spices under the skin. i highly recommend this recipe!

I didn't have thyme, but used all other spices, and since I had 11 thighs I added a heaping teaspoon of seasoned breadcrumbs to have more topping.  This is probably the best chicken I've every made.  So easy, delicious and it looks beautiful!

Tastes amazing! Super easy to do. Bought all the spices and herbs in the bulk section to save me money. I just made sure to proportion them equally when I mixed it instead of measuring everything and then whatever else I had leftover I can use for next time.

I only had skinless/boneless thighs to work with (bet it's better with skin and bones), but it was pretty good. I even cubed up some potatoes and cooked them in the same pan with the same spices. For a guy that doesn't like cooking complicated recipes this was perfect. I'm gonna make this again sometime.

The chicken meat was delicious, but I had a problem with the skin being too crispy!  The skin was difficult to eat and I am wondering if it might be due to the antibiotic free thighs I used?  I put the thighs on a baking rack set  on a foil lined pan, and there was very little fat in the pan.  We enjoyed the chicken, and I will try it again, maybe cooking for a little less time.  If anyone has any ideas, it would be appreciated.

I made this with skinless, boneless thighs and it was very tasty and well received by my dinner companions.  I did double the amount of dry rub and  did decrease the cooking time by about 15 minutes.  I would definitely make it again.

We don't normally eat chicken with skin on and bone in; but this recipe looked really, really good so I bought chicken thighs and made the recipe exactly as written tonight for dinner.  Okay, made it exactly as written but GREATLY increased the spice rub.    The end result was very good, served over a bed of  rice pilaf.  There is one change I'd make next time -- elevate the thighs off the pan so they're not soaking in the fat during cooking.  I've used this process for other recipes and it makes for crispy on both sides.

Used 3 thighs but the same amount of seasoning.  Used garlic powder and onion powder so I added 1/4 tsp of salt. Nice change from the usual shake and bake!

The only thing I did is pulled the skin from the thighs. The chicken turned out juicy and crispy. This will always be my go to recipe for baked chicken. It's the only time I've gotten juicy chicken without covering the dish with aluminum foil.

This turned out perfect!  Loved the crispy skins and the chicken was moist and delicious.  I doubled the spices as others suggested and rubbed it all over the chicken.

Used double the amount of seasonings for 1.5 x the chicken. Found it to be a rather bland recipe. I won't be making it again.

I absolutely loved this dish.  I didn't have onion salt so I just used garlic powder to substitute.  I didn't have ground thyme so I did dried basil and it actually turned out great.  I had to use what I had on hand which resulted in a yummy dinner.  My husband who is also a picky eater loved it.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

This was delicious, used same amount of herbs and put under skin as other reviews stated but only made 6 thighs. I baked on a broiler pan  sprayed with Pam and covered the bottom pan with foil. Easy clean up. I did find the baking time to be almost 1 1/2 hours. Maybe the thighs were larger. Definitely a keeper recipe, next time I'm going to try legs and breast also.

I only had boneless/skinless chicken thighs. Was very yummy.  Next time I will make it with the skin and bone for the crispy effect.  A true and easy keeper recipe.

This was great for whole family!  Doubled spice amounts, used regular garlic and onion powder and same amt in salt.  It also reheated in the oven very well the next day.  Easy to pair with anything.  Tasty, crispy, juicy!

Easy to make. Had to change the recipe a little as didn't have onion salt or garlic salt on hand. Still good, but needed a little more salt. Also seasoned the skin and under the skin. Skin was crispy. Cooked on the lower rack in my oven. And if you don't have an instant read thermometer, make sure you get the reading next to the bone- I think I cooked it a little long due to getting a misread.

I was skeptical because the recipe just seemed too simple, but I also was in a rush to have dinner prepared and in the oven. This was super quick and extremely easy to make. On top of that, it was absolutely delicious. I only had four thighs, but still used the same amount of seasoning the recipe called for. I also took advise from the previous reviews to add the seasoning under the skin. My husband, who is usually the cook in the house, loved it. He even noticed the seasoning added under the skin. He doesn't like to eat chicken skin, but he actually ate the skin off this chicken (that alone is a big plus). It was  crunchy and full of yummy flavor. I will definitely make this again!

Mine came out a little too overdone. I think maybe 45 min. Might work out better for my oven. Check them before an hour! Taste was great though.

This chicken is delicious and so simple.  The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly; the results were moist tender chicken with crispy skin and just enough seasoning.  As written this recipe is perfect.  But, the last 2 times I've made this, to save on time and calories, I've used boneless skinless chicken thighs and baked them for about 25 minutes.  Obviously, not as crispy as the chicken with skin, but still very tasty and tender.  Even without the skin, the chicken does get a bit of a crust on the outside.  Regardless of my chicken thigh's bone and skin status, this will be a go-to recipe for me.  Literally takes 3 minutes to prepare, makes no mess and tastes great.

So very very good.  And easy.  And inexpensive.  Will definitely make this again.   Only changes made were used garlic powder and onion powder because I didn't have these in "salt" form.  I added celery salt to make up for the salt.  Also seasoned the underside of the chicken with a little salt before cooking  and put some of the spice rub under the skin.
If you want to cut out some fat, you could easily do these without the skin or you could take skin off after cooking.

This recipe turned out very flavorful and juicy. It was a little in the salty side. Next time I will use garlic or onion powder instead of salt. I also did not have thyme and recipe came out great!!

The seasoning is delicious. Unfortunately, since it's on the skin which I don't eat, all the flavor went in the trash. Next time I'll remove the skin and apply directly to the meat.

This recipe has been a hit with my family for a few years now. So much so, that I've saved a mixture of the seasonings in my pantry. I love this so much, I'm going to share this on one of my recipe blog posts with credit to the original author, ofcourse. 

I absolutely would not change a thing. My husband and daughter both ask for this recipe often. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I used thighs and drumsticks for this recipe and I dried them with paper towel before seasoning them to make sure the skin was good and crispy.  I also pulled the skin back some and seasoned the meat underneath as well as the skin.  It turned out fantastic!  Very crispy and tasty and the meat was juicy and tender.  I will make this again.

This meal was great my family and I enjoyed it very much I did get skinless thighs and it still got a good crispy coat on top! The blend of spices was just perfect! It was a very easy meal to cook season put in the oven and you're good to go! This is definitely a meal my family and I will have in the future again!

This was very easy and delicious. Only thing I changed was to bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes before reducing the temp back to 350. This  ensured a crispy skin and keeping the juices inside.

I agree with most everybody else - how in the world did these pieces end up crispy??? But they did and were pretty good. We'll do this again, but the next time I'm adding 1/4 t. salt along with the other seasonings. I did bake ours (4 thighs) on a cookie cooling rack above a foil lined pan which helped keep the bottoms from being greasy, put lots of the flavoring under the skin along with on top, and baked them for the full hour.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe. Edit: And now that I read the recipe over I see that I used onion and garlic powder instead of salt, which explains why I felt it needed regular salt. This time I'll do it right!

My husband absolutely loved this!!  I salt the chicken early in the day to help draw out extra moisture so the skin gets extra crispy and then rinse before adding the spice blend.  Delicious!

This was so delicious! I put the seasoning on top of and under the skin. I substituted onion salt for onion powder. Also, at the last minute I realized I was out of thyme so I ground a little less rosemary in my mortar and pestle as a substitute. Yep I am surely making this again and again!!!

This was amazing.  When I think crispy skin on chicken thighs, I usually go straight for the cast iron skillet.  This was incredible.  I did, however, triple the spice mix and put some under the skins.  The cooked for just about an hour exactly - I cooked about 10 mins longer because I rotated the pan half way through to cook evenly in my tiny apartment oven.  The skin was absolutely perfect - so crispy, so yummy!

Really good for such a simple recipe.  The entire family ate it up.  In place of the oregano and thyme I used an Italian seasoning (in which oregano and thyme were the primary ingredients).  I put them on a rack in a roasting pan so that the grease would drip down and it was fabulous.

These were crispy and good though the seasoning doesn't get to the meat. Perhaps it would be better to lift skin and put seasoning next to meat. Thanks Nicole

I followed the recipe exactly, and found it to be only so-so.  There was nothing wrong, but the chicken did not have "tons of flavor"....the entire family found it to be rather boring.  With all the chicken recipes out there, I probably won't make this again.

This recipe was great.  I didn't have onion salt or thyme, so I omitted those and added Emeril's Bayou mix and italian seasoning instead.  I had 10 thighs and doubled the spices.  I put half on top of the skin and half under the skin. Wasn't too spicy and we even had a couple two year-olds eating it.  Timing was just right...

Delicious!  My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  Super moist and flavorful.  I always make this recipe as it is presented, don't need to change a thing!  This spice mix is brilliant, and so easy!  This recipe was particularly wonderful when we were on a low carb diet, I made it at least once a week for months!

Will def make this again!  I used boneless, skinless thighs in a covered roasting pan.  About 15 mins before the timer was done I tossed in some chopped up carrots, potatoes and sliced sweet onion.  What a flavour!!!

Wonderful and fast!!!  Made it just as the recipe says.  I put half up on a rack as suggested in one of the reviews and found it cooked the same as those not on the rack and turned out very crispy.  I also seasoned under and over the skin as well.  Next time I will cook in a heavier pan so that I can deglaze those wonderful juices with some wine and create a little demi glaze to drizzle over.  I paired with roasted root vegetables and crusty warm bread and it was a perfect dinner.  My very picky seafood only daughter loved it and ate two pieces of the chicken.  My husband loved it too, even the root vegetables.

I made the mistake of using garlic and onion powder, not salt. Makes a huge difference in the taste, making it more peppery. Not going to give less stars for my mistake because its still pretty tasty and VERY easy to make!!!! Definitely will be making again with the right ingredients next time :-P

This was a great jumping off point for me. I've made thighs in the past and the skin never got crispy. This worked great. By jumping off point I mean I cooked them according to the time and temperature directions but added a step in the prep and changed up the seasoning. My dh hates thighs because they are greasy and I enjoy the crispy skin. So I trimmed off all of the fat except the little bit covering the top. To season them I used garlic, ginger, five spice and drizzled them with a little soy sauce. Everyone loved them!

We loved this recipe and didn't change a thing... except that we had a few more thighs in my package so we upped the herbs just slightly to equal the pieces. It was FABULOUS! So simple. There is a nice crunch on the tops with a moist meat center. Really easy inexpensive meal that 99% of people already have the ingredients in their cupboard! This is my second time making this so I figured I'd review it. ;-) Use tinfoil to line the baking sheet and it will make cleanup as easy as it can be.

Absolutely delicious. Didn't change a thing.
 I have made this so many times, I felt the need to write about it again. This has become a staple in our home.  People request it when their coming over for dinner. It's great for the next day...cold right out of the refrigerator.  I've started making two pans full of chicken that way the kids snack on it the following day.  Love love love this chicken!!! Thanks for a wonderful addition to our weekly menu.

Easy, fast, and delicious!  We absolutely love this recipe and my husband likes me to make it at least twice a week, and I can have it in the oven in less than five minutes.  It is amazing how crispy the chicken gets just having spices and herbs sprinkled on the skin.  When I cook skinless chicken breasts I baste it with a small amount of olive oil and then add the mix.  The cooked breast meat makes absolutely delicious sandwiches.  I have modified the recipe a bit and use garlic and onion powder, not salts, and then add about 1/2 part salt. I also triple the amount of paprika and use smoked paprika for a delicious bonus flavor. Because I make it so often I make up large batches of it and keep it in a spice jar with a shaker lid ready to go.

Very easy and delicious.  I used 12 thighs and doubled the spices.  The recipe calls for onion salt but used onion power.  Because I made more than the recipe, the thighs weren't done in an hour - added an extra half hour and bumped the heat up to 375.

This is now my go-to dinner recipe. We have this once a week and absolutely love it! I use boneless skinless chicken breasts and it turns out great even with the same cooking time. Sometimes I put them under the broiler for 2-3 minutes after the hour is up. I also get creative with the spices..using the basic recipe shared here and sometimes add more or less. Fantastic recipe! Thank you so much for sharing this.

Very simple recipe, I used a little more seasoning and put some under the skin as well as on top, also sprayed a little cooking spray on top. The boyfriend and kiddos definitely approved and it made the house smell yummy.

Made this for supper tonight as written and it was very tasty.  This is the first time I've made chicken thighs in a ever long time.  I didn't like thighs, but, this recipe has changed my mind.  I will make this recipe again.  I also usually do not eat the skin, but I did tonight.  The skin had a nice crispy taste.

I live in a spanish spice household so I switched some things out and used Adobo, sazonador, Sazon, garlic powder, dried minced onion, pepper & oregano.
I have a 7, & 2yr/o who are very picky in what they choose to eat and they ate it all.
I did make sure to flip the chicken and rub the bottom and between the skin & meat to make sure there was flavor on the meat as well.
The chicken was the main dish and I made white rice, a can of Goya pink beans w/sauce and corn on the cob for my sides!!!
A new family dish going in my "FAV RECIPES" book!!!
Thank you @allrecipes for the amazing idea!!!

This recipe was fantastic! The only thing I did differently was put the chicken on a baking rack as others suggested. I also doubled the spice mixture. The next time I will triple it as it is so yummy. My husband absolutely loved this dish. Chicken thighs can be a bit greasy but they were still very very tasty and crispy.

I used the receipe as written however I used drums as well as thighs. This chicken turned out great and with little mess to clean up. Very tasty and will be on my menu when again it is my turn in the kitchen.

These are easy, fast, and delishious!  I only used 4 thighs, but doubled all the other ingredients and the thighs actually come out with an herb crust, instead of just lightly seasoned.   Also I used 1 tablespoon fresh thyme (because I had it and wanted to use it up) and  I think that helped bump-up the flavor.  So good!!  I made it twice in one week.

I rated this 5 stars for being quick and flavorful. I made exactly as the poster wrote it. I did not flip them but baked them skin side up after coating all sides. I had to double the spices for 8 thighs. My husband does not care for thighs as they are usually tough. However, this recipe converted him and will promote the purchase of money-saving thighs as they always go on sale. I took the leftovers to work to share and everyone raved about them. Thanks for a great recipe!

Simple.  Mixed up  a small container with 1T of each of the spices, and now I'm ready for next time.  I'm sure the seasoning would be excellent on pork also.

The chicken turned out well but it NEEDS to be salted under the skin before roasting. Otherwise , it's rather bland in taste end result. I also roasted it for about 20-30 minutes a longer than called for. My oven must run cooler than average.

I had to make a few subtle changes. I don't use garlic or onion salt so I used powdered and added an equal amount of kosher salt. I also didn't have ground thyme so used dried thyme leaves and I used white pepper instead of black. I also added an equal amount of dried rosemary. I don't eat the skin so I rubbed it onto the chicken as well as the skin and let it sit for a few hours before cooking. When it was time to cook, I drizzled some EVOO on top of each thigh. It was absolutely delicious. This will be making rounds into my monthly dinner menus. I cooked it in a pan and used the liquid that baked off for roasted potatoes and carrots. I'm going to be making it again tomorrow night using chicken leg quarters and making the potatoes and carrots with it. I may use the drippings to make a homemade chicken gravy as well. This is a very versatile seasoning recipe and different things can be added or subtracted to suit one's tastes and diet. Thanks!!

I didn't know how something so simple could get so many positive reviews but this was so good!!! I loved it and the kids loved it!  The only thing I did differently was to turn the oven on broil for the last 3 mins to make the skin extra crispy!

Great as written.  I only had two really large bone-in thighs and the amount of spices was enough.  Skin was nice and crispy.  Will make again.

Add a little lemon juice to the bottom of the pan and it gives it a fresh twist. But I use fresh garlic, Italian seasoning, onion powder, salt, pepper, carne asada seasoning and lemon juice.

First time I made this recipe...got rave revues. Took a chance and made this for company.
Did not change a thing.
However I "cleaned up" the thighs...bought these thighs at Giant Market for 88 cents a pound. I cut off with my kitchen scissors all the excess fat tucked under each thigh...it would have fried the thighs instead if roasting. Great idea from someone here to "rack" the thighs. I used my cookie racks..did the job perfect.
This is a keeper...yummy! Oh I rubbed the spice mix under the skin too.

These were very crispy and very easy. I had some leftover ranch seasoning so I used that for the seasoning. I also lined my baking dish with foil as suggested by others. Another reviewer suggested draining off the fat halfway through. That helped really crisp up the thighs. I served with a caprese salad and creamy spinach and mushroom fettuccine.

This is just one of those recipes that is amazingly easy yet very satisfying. I doubled the spices as suggested by many. The combination of spices is perfect. Making it again tonight and shared this recipe with my sister who does not like to cook at all and she and her family loved it too.

Reading the recipe -- it doesn't sound like much as there is very little to it and it is not at all labor-intensive but it is definitely worthy of 5 stars! I am making up a container of the spice blend to that I will always have it on hand. Going to share this with lots of people!

Made this for the first time tonight and we really loved it! The seasoning was superb and it indeed was crispy outside and moist and juicy inside.  I baked it on a rack on a cookie sheet as other reviewers suggested but did use the aluminum foil and sprayed the rack.  The only thing I will do differently next time is double the seasoning mixture so I can coat the bottom of the thighs as well.  Cooking time and oven temp were spot on. Thanks for this great recipe... will definitely be making this again!

Delicious as written. Next time may sprinkle seasoning directly onto meat under skin.  Took less time (meat 200 degrees at 45 mins but still nice and juicy) for 4 thighs on gold sheet.

This was delicious even though I made it from boneless skinless chicken breasts, due to me being on a diet and also wanting to cut fat. I only had garlic powder and onion powder so I added salt for additional salt, otherwise made it exactly. Loved it and thanks for the recipe. I will be making this on a regular basis.

We loved this chicken recipe. So easy after work as well. I used boneless, skinless thighs and brushed them lightly with garlic infused olive oil (didn't have garlic powder or salt), then sprinkled the spices on. I also followed another readers idea and roasted carrots and potatoes in the juices. Thank you for the great supper idea.

I marinated mine and put them in a sealable baggie in the marinate and froze them.  We were planning on grilling outside but weather didn't permit.  So, this AM when I got up, defrosted and put in the oven, just opened the bag and poured it into a casserole dish.  These baked up beautifully and I think that the lower temp and longer cook time created a more tender juicy chicken.

This recipe is very simple and very tasty. I made it with boneless/skinless chicken thighs and it was very good. I just shortened the time by 10 minutes and let them rest before serving.

I used boneless, skinless breasts and just made sure to drizzle some olive oil over the chicken to retain moisture. Used smoked paprika instead of regular - Flavor was great! I would make this again.

Very good. I took the skin off just for the sake of calories.  Also used Italian herb seasoning instead of oregano and thyme.  It has a little bite to it and cooked in exactly 1 hr.

After 30 minutes of cooking the chicken (only 4 pieces) I added carrots, peppers & onions to the baking sheet. I sprinkled some of the seasoning on top and sprayed a little olive oil on veggies. Baked chicken and veggies for another 30 minutes. Scrumptious chicken and veggie dinner!

Very good!  I used 10 good-sized thighs and doubled the seasonings which I rubbed under the skin as well as on top.   Had to pour off the fat twice; I mixed some of the drippings into sliced carrots, potatoes and onions which I roasted in a separate pan.  This was a delicious meal.  Even my extremely picky 11 yr old ate two pieces!

Like it says,"crispy and tender"! Made it for the kids back to school dinner and it and I was famous. I'd read some of the reviews before I made the dish and wanted to be sure it was flavored throughout so I marinaded in Zesty Italian dressing for 6 hours prior to baking. Because of this, it needed to be drained. I would definitely recommend broiling last two minutes of cook time.

I have made this many times. I double the spice and use as needed. I rub the spices on directly instead of shaking it. I also peel back the skin and rub the spice directly on the meat and on skin as well. I use olive oil to coat the pan and baste about 3-4 times during cooking. Comes out perfect!

This recipe came out very well. It was simple to prepare and cooked for an hour. The result was delicious. I think the key to the crispness is using foil to line the pan. My family really liked it. I served it with a simple risotto including onion, carrot, celery simmered in chicken broth. I added at cup of peas to the finished rice and seasoned it with Parmesan cheese.

Very easy and very good!  I used Seasoned Salt in place of onion salt, tasted wonderful!  Would surely make this again!  Also, I had ten larger sized thighs, so I doubled the spice mixture and used it all up :)

I followed this recipe exactly and loved it.  I took the advice of another reviewer and rubbed some of the spices under the skin as well.  Perfect.  Considering how inexpensive chicken thighs are I now make this fairly often.  Thanks for the great recipe!

So crispy and good! Definitely use a splatter guard.  All I used was salt on both sides with a little pepper on the meat side after the turn.  I'm gluten free, so that fragrance and flavor of crunchy fried chicken is something I've missed. Now, it's back! The whole house smells heavenly.

I honestly didn't think the amount of spices would cover the chicken or be flavorfulfor that matter, but dang, I was wrong! I'm glad I followed the other reviewers and gave it a chance. Delicious! I used fresh oregano and minced onions because that's what I had on hand. But the skin was crispy and the chicken juicy! Rave reviews from everyone here!

I've used this recipe several times and really find it convenient. I've double the spices, but use garlic and onion powder instead of the sallted variety!  Works as well!

A bit bland, but the tip skin part did get crispy. You need to really lift the skin and add some rub under it in order for the meat to have some flavor. I also doubled the seasoning for 7 thighs and cooked for 45 minutes instead of the full hour since I hate my chicken dry and like it just cooked enough so it's no longer raw.

I followed this recipe exactly as written.  I thought that it was very flavorful and juicy.  I used drumsticks instead of chicken thighs and they were great.

Easy and tasty.  I use onion powder instead of salt, and no garlic (not a fan).  I use hot paprika and cook at 375 not 350 if the thighs were frozen and defrosted in the microwave as they might need a bit more heat to cook through.  I am light on salt but use a little for enhanced flavor.  This is a great recipe.  I like it with rice or smashed red potatoes and veggies.  Will make it again and again.

So easy and delicious!  I doubled the spices since the amounts didn't seem like they would cover 8 chicken thighs.  So glad I did.  My husband raved about this recipe.  I will definitely be keeping packs of chicken thighs in my freezer from now on for a quick and delicious dinner.  I served this with a "Knorrs" Chicken flavored rice and some freshly steamed carrots.  Thank you!

DE-LISH! I used turkey thighs instead of chicken and just tripled the measurments of the spices due to their larger size but they turned out PERFECT! Skin was very crisp and meat tender and juicy. Will make this recipe again!

Great idea for seasoning chicken.  I cooked chicken thigh without the skin and think it'll be good covered in bbq sauce.

Wonderful recipe! My family gobbled it up. I roasted fingerling potatoes to go with it, doubling the seasonings that went on the chicken and put them on the potatoes with a little olive oil. This recipe is definitely a keeper. ~Julie

This was amazing! I used the full amount of spices on just 4 thighs and it was a mouthful of flavour. Perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside! Thank you!

Love this recipe! Sooooooo easy and delicious! I made it with 1/4 tsp garlic and onion powders and added 1/2 tsp salt because I didn't have the garlic or onion salts. Even my hubby said I should make this again and again and though he likes chicken he doesn't like alot of it. Thanks for the recipe!!

I have made this several times and we love it - so easy and delicious!   I did increase the seasoning amount and I just put the seasoning in a plastic bag, add the chicken and shake it up to evenly distribute the seasoning.  Thanks for this recipe, it's great - even my 88 year mother makes it often because it's so easy.

Easy and budget friendly indeed. The only thing is, if you do not want to eat the skin, then you lose all the flavors. Next time I will try using skinless thighs.

Great base, I didn't have oregano or paprika and actually used cumin and curry powder instead, worked great!
