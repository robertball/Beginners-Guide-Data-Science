I gave this 4 stars only because I like it better with a little more flavorful salad dressing.  I grew up eating this with a light french or catalina dressing.  Try it!

So fresh & tasty! You can still make this salad in the winter time using jar grapefruit.

This is definitely light and refreshing and I will make it again with changes. I ended up serving this with shrimp sauteed in olive oil and old bay seasoning.  It had a beautiful presentation.  The only thing we were having trouble with was the acidity of the dressing, I even added a teaspoon of agave to it to balance it out, maybe it needed more or a pinch of sugar.  We also thought serving it with some type of blackened seasoned fish would go well with this dressing.  We will try that next time. Definitely has potential!

This was delicious and I made it as written, minus the sprouts. Served it on lettuce leaves paired with salmon and augratin potatoes. This will definitely be a "go to" recipe for me!

These are flavors you wouldn't think work together, but they are awesome! This is a new family favorite.  We love the flavor and presentation factor!
