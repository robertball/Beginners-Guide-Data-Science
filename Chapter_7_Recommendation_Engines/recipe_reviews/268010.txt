Excellent stew. I added some little neck clams, a pound of sea and a  half pound of bay scallops and another pound of the cod. I  two and a half timed the base recipe and fed  10 very happy people. Have fun dipping your crusty bread! You will love this.

I have prepared this stew a few times and it is always a winner.  I use anchovy paste that I always have on hand, as well as adding Clamato Juice to enhance the flavor.  If available, fresh mussels, added in the final simmering, not only complete this stew; but really enhances its presentation and interactive eating and conversation. Impressive when serving to guests!  Thank you Allrecipes!

We made this as called for and we enjoyed it.  First comment is that the serving size is incorrect this will feed at least 4 adults as written.  It was interesting to hear the different comments regarding the meal.  Some really could not taste the flavors and felt it was too watery, personally it is exactly what I expected.  The only change I made was using 1/2 Teaspoon of anchovy paste instead of the the anchovy fillet.  I really enjoyed it but gave it four stars based on the overall comments.

The combination of spices was especially well done and spot-on. The tomato base and olive oil made it light and healthy. Brilliant recipe here!

I used Pollak and added some bay scallops.  It was delicious and will be a recipe I will make more often, especially with Lent coming up.

I made this exactly as the recipe and video guides.  It was delicious and my husband loved it! It really lets the fish shine and is a nice healthy dish.  My only struggle was with straining the tomato puree. I first used a very fine mesh strainer and it would not let the liquid through. I ended up using my mesh colander and that worked.  I was worried about the tomato mixture but it all worked out as Chef John said it would. The fresh herbs were a really nice touch.  We will make this again.

This was quite tasty!  Used dry herbs as I didn’t have fresh ones.  Added them along with the tomato purée to allow time to blend.

Substituted cod for halibut. Should have used snapper. This recipe is designed for firmer fish. Overall very good. Better the next day after flavors have had time to meld.

Mmm, such nice flavours, and not much work. Only change I'd make for me is more fish less shrimp. And I used haddock instead of halibut, I'm sure it's even nicer with halibut. Thanks for a delicious meal idea!

The sauce is light and simple and delicious. I halved the recipe as I cook for myself only. The next time I make it I will make a full recipe of sauce with half the seafood, and that will be more than enough for 3 servings (6oz of fish plus 8oz of shrimp should feed 3 people at a minimum).

Delicious! I wish I had the anchovie paste. I used soy sauce instead. But my audience commented that it was one of the best entrees I've made! I used cod instead of halibut because that's what I had on hand. Tasted great just the same. Oh, I didn't strain the tomato/clam juice blend. Not sure, but it came out just fine! I'll strain it next time when I have the right tools.

Fantastic!  I used big chunks of Cod, extra large shrimp and mussels!!  Used the chunky puree garlic and alot more seasonings...like salt and fresh pepper.   Double the recipe and added some crusty bread and salad....the BEST!!!  I used the entire puree of the tomatoes  to give it more body and friends told me I need to sell it - it is SO GOOD!  Thank you so much for this recipe - I will make this for a lifetime!

Fresh, healthy, simple, & FANTASTIC!!! These flavors are subtly balanced and rich. DO NOT skip the clam juice nor anchovy! I used paste and accidentally over browned the green onions & garlic...I’ll do it exactly the same!

This was actually quite delicious. As far as time goes the longest time was spent on straining the tomato and clam juice mixture through the chinoise.  
There isn’t much juice/broth after it’s all said and done, it’s just barely enough for 2 servings.  I’m guessing it will double just fine, so next time there will be plenty for 2 people to have 2 servings each with some leftover. .

Very flavorful and easy to prepare seafood stew. I added diced waxy potatoes for more heft and that is purely a matter of personal preference. I’m also partial to thyme in seafood stews, so I added 1/2 tsp. to the broth. Try this recipe. It works.

We loved this! I didn't have clam juice so I subbed with chicken broth also, I didn't have fresh oregano so I used a little dried oregano. Other than those two substitutions I made the recipe as written. It came out delicious, I would suggest tasting for spicy heat before adding additional red pepper flakes when serving.

This was absolutely delicious. I used cod and shrimp. I suggest serving with homemade Italian bread as I did. The portion size is off, I doubled the recipe and it was enough for my me, my wife, and our 4 children. Next time I plan on using a larger variety of seafood... maybe some lobster claw meat... and some clams...
