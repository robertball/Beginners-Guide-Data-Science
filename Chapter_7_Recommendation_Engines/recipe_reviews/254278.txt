This is my new go-to Asian sauce. Can't wait to use the left-overs on some spring rolls. I used two habaneros and one serrano chili. This made it seriously hot, but we like it that way. It seemed like a ton of garlic, but the sauce was perfectly balanced between sweet, garlic, and heat. 

Thanks Chef John.

Absolutely brilliant. The best I've ever made. I was not very sure about the importance of the fish sauce in this recipe ...now that i've made it, I am. Its amazing that an Indian learning to cook a Thai recipe from an American chef...Thats the beauty of food (& internet :-) ). Chef John, you rock...every time.

I substituted Sriracha for Sambal and just one dried arbol pepper instead of birds eye peppers (that's what I had).  I also cut back a little on the brown sugar.  Tasted surprisingly good!

The best Sweet Chili Sauce! The others Ive tried come out either too starchy (which separates) or not the same fullness in flavour.

I made this to go with the spicy shrimp cakes, went together perfectly. I used jalapeño, because that’s what I had on hand, otherwise followed the recipe.

Dang, this is now the go-to sauce in my house and others. I gave some to a friend of mine that is Vietnamese, and this is now her go to sauce. She supplies me with Vietnamese peppers and I make the sauce. My only question is how long can this be refrigerated before it spoils...????????
