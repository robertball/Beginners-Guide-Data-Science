So, so good. You will NOT be disappointed. This is common seasoning in Italian cooking for both pork roasts and chicken---with the addition of a splash or two of dry white wine. Wonderful aroma as it cooks too, which is a nice bonus!

This was fantastic.  My children loved it as well.  I used fresh rosemary, 3 or 4 garlic cloves and probably 3 Tbls. of olive oil.  I put the oil mixture on the tenderloin in the morning, wrapped it in plastic and put in the fridge.  I will definetly make this again.

Very simple and quick to prepare.  Only thing I did different was slice the garlic and then stuff it into the roast on the sides.

I gave this 4 stars because 160 degrees is far to high for taking a pork roast out of the oven.  For a decent sized pork roast 145-150 is a more correct target that will eventually rise towards 160 as it rests.  Taking out at 160 guarantees overcooking.  For those complaining about cook time inaccuracy you don't know how to cook a roast.  Time is a guideline, it is done when it is done, not when the timer goes off.  Get a meat thermometer and use it.  Learn the proper temperatures for cooking various cuts of meat.

This was one of the few times I broke my cardinal rule to follow the recipe 100% the first time. My roast was a 4lb pork loin. I took suggestions from several reviewers and cut slits in the roast & filled them with part of the garlic and fresh rosemary that I pressed slightly with the side of a small spoon to release the flavor & aroma. I then rubbed the roast with the olive oil & spread additional garlic & rosemary over it, along with some salt & pepper. I roasted it for 15 minutes at 450, then reduced the temperature to 300 for 90 more minutes, basting occasionally.  It was amazingly tender, juicy and delicious! I made gravy with the pan drippings and served slow-cooker mashed potatoes, pesto tomatoes (both recipes from this site) and steamed broccoli sprinkled with freshly ground Parmesan.  We had enough meat & potatoes for leftovers that we had with applesauce and a green tossed salad.  It was just as good the second time around! Thank you, Stacy!

This was a disaster.

It smelled great as it was cooking, but was inedible.

Another reviewer commented that 2 hours wasn't enough time:  I made it with pork tenderloin and 2 hours was WAY too long.  It was dried out, and the outside was so crusty/crunchy I could hardly cut it.  The inside (what little was salvageable from it) was bland and dry.

What a waste of a rather expensive cut of meat!

I got great compliments when I made this for dinner guests.  Would definitely make again.  Very simple.  I added extra olive oil and some salt pepper the second time around, which came out even better.  Great with garlic mashed potatos and southern Green Beans.

I used a center cut pork roast and this recipe turned out great.
The meat was so tender, I could barely slice it, it was falling apart.
The family loved it - very easy.

The big problem with this recipe is I feel it is designed for a pork LOIN, not TENDERLOIN. Very different cuts, anyone who uses tenderloins and bakes it for two hours should probably sell their stove and order pizza. Comeon people. Just a simple typo. Use a pork loin. Tenderloins take less than a half hour to bake.

I make a similar recipe I got from my mother-in-law, who is from Italy. She showed me how to stab the roast all over with small pockets. Coat with olive oil and then sprinkle with generous amounts of salt and pepper. Mince 3T of fresh rosemary and 3-4 large cloves of garlic. Push small amounts of rosemary and garlic into the pcokets. Brown the roast all over on the stovetop and then slowly roast at 325 for 2-3 hours, depending on the size of the roast. If I have a small roast, I 'pot roast' it on the stove top with a small amount of water in the pan and a lid that lets steam escape, turning it often.

This recipe was easy and simple. I cut the amount of rosemary in half, though, and even that seemed too much. But the pork was moist and delicious, and made for great sandwiches the next day.

this is soooo good and ridiculously simple.  *tip to save pork lovers some serious cash*: you can sub. pork trimmings for just abt. any pork recipe and save a bundle of $$$.  what they are(as described to me by a butcher) is the excess meat left over after butter-flied pork chops are cut, so the pieces are really good cuts of meat--just not as pretty or nearly expensive.  i buy these at my grocery for .89/lb!

I always cut slits into the top of tenderloin and insert slices of garlic & fresh rosemary leaves into it, oil, then salt & pepper before roasting.  Roasting is definitely better to me than using a crock pot as some suggested.  Use the meat thermometer to prevent overcooking the tenderloin & turning it dry if that is what is happening to you. 155 degrees & very slightly pink is still perfectly safe to eat & leaves the pork moist.

It may be worth five stars cooked the way suggested but I altered the recipe, and used 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 Tbsp crushed rosemary, 1 Tbsp crushed fennel, 2 Tbsp EVOO, plus salt and pepper to taste...Yum!!!!  Yum!!!  I found an easy way to crush the rosemary and fennel seed was by putting it inside a pepper mill (minus the pepper of course).

Made this over the weekend. Loved it !! So tender it fell apart trying to get it out of the crockpot. I used a 4 lb. pork shoulder roast that I seared on all sides. In same pan I sauted 1/2 onion (all I had) and garlic in olive oil, scrapeing bottom to get all the brown bits. Place the roast, onions garlic, rosemary, 1/2 cup water & 1 cup wine in crockpot & cook on low for 6-7 hours.  Ymmm!!!

So good!  I used fresh rosemary and the meat was so tender and full of flavor.   A word of caution though; if you use a tenderloin the cooking time is far too long.  Mine was ready in less than an hour.  I added a little water to the pan after the meat was done and served the juice over the meat.  This is a great and easy way to make a delicious pork roast.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I took advice from another site and cooked at 450 for the first 10 minutes and then lowered the temp. to 250 for the next 90 minutes.  The rosemary flavor with the pork was great!  This is such a simple, yet elegant dish!

Rosemary and pork are a wonderful combination. I do recommend crushing the rosemary in a herb grinder or with a mortar and pestle so that it adheres to the meat better and doesn't poke anyone's mouth.

I added dijon mustard to the glaze & used fresh rosemary since I grow my own. The glaze crusted up beautifully and the flavour was fantastic! It works great on baked pork chops too. This is going to be my regular glaze for pork roasts from now on!

So good!  I used a 2lb boneless rib pork roast and it took about 1.5 hours to cook to perfection.  I used 3 cloves of garlic, taking the advice of others & putting some in slits in the meat. I didn't measure the rosemary, just eyeballed what amount would be good for the cut meat I had.  I probably only used about 1 tablespoon.  I added some fresh ground pepper as well.  Very simple, and my husband & son loved it.

This was sooo easy and soooo delicious. I bought a package of two small pork tenderloins (2.5 lb)and used dried rosemary, fresh garlic (I put some on top and stuffed some inside the tenderloin) and EVOO. The meat package said to cook it at 400 for 20-25 min per pound. I cooked it for 30 minutes and checked it. The internal temp was already 160. It cooked faster than the recipe. It was sooo moist. My family devoured this!

I am not a meat eater, but I made this for my boyfriend about a week ago. His exact words were "That's the best piece of pork I've ever had". I baked it covered for three hours at a lower temp and then uncovered for an hour at 375. Just perfect! And the smell alone made me rethink my vegetarian ways.

I cooked tenderlions instead of roast.  I thought it was too dry.  Also the taste was not there.  I will not try this one again with tenderloin.  Maybe it is better to be used with a roast.  Constructive Critisum

I tried this with tenderlion and it was only ok. It came out very dry- even with reduced cooking time- and not very flavorful. The rosemary was overwhelming. Next time I will make a few modifications. First, this recipe seems better suited to a roast. I will mix it with the oil, garlic, and fresh rosemary (instead of dried) to marinate overnight before cooking. To try to keep it moist I will try it in my slow cooker. With those changes I'm hoping to have much better results next time.

Easy and delicious.  I used only one small pork tenderloin (not sure of the weight) along with fresh rosemary, garlic powder and some fresh thyme.  It cooked faster than the recipe, probably because it was so small.  Watch a meat thermometer instead of the clock when cooking pork tenderloins.

This is a great recipe - to keep the pork moist, however, I always put about 1 cup of red wine in the bottom of the pan and baste the pork often throughout cooking. It gives it a wonderful flavor.

I am not much of a fan of pork roast, but my husband wanted one for New Year's day. I looked over every recipe on here, and decided on this one since we had everything we needed on hand for it. I think it changed my mind about pork roasts! It was absolutely delicious! It was tender, juicy, and very flavorful...very unlike every other pork roast I have ever had before this one.

My family loved this roast and I found it very easy to fix.  I used fresh rosemary from my garden and plenty of garlic, a little salt and pepper at the end.  It was delicious!  Thanks so much.

Wonderful flavour - have made this several times and used different pork roasts each time (tenderloin can be quite pricey where I live!) and it always turns out fabulous.  I have added dijon mustard as well and that adds a lovely flavour.  Great recipe - will be making this often!

I was skeptical that a recipe this basic could be worthy of so many stars…my skepticism has been squashed.  My pork roast turned out flavorful and very moist…Husband and kids loved it!  The only thing I did differently was I combined the oil, garlic, and rosemary then rubbed it on the roast (just easier).

I used pork tenderloin and it was great. Lots of flavour and not dry at all. Roasted in oven for about 25 minutes and served it with mashed potatoes and carrots for a nice meal. I will definitely add this to my regular recipes.

This turned out great. Followed recipe as written. My 4.5 lb pork roast took 1/2 hr longer than the 2 hours recommended and I would have left it in a full 3 hours had I not had to feed my company! It wasn't dry at all. I did make one little addition after reading some reviews - I sliced some onions and put them under the roast - that may have helped keep it moist(?) Anyway, this was definitely my idea of a roast pork and I'll keep this one in my recipe box.

Used a 4 lb pork loin. I cut slits in the roast & filled them w/minced garlic & chopped fresh rosemary. I rubbed the roast w/olive oil & "rubbed in" additional garlic & rosemary all over, seasoned  w/onion powder, salt & pepper and lightly sprinkled all over w/cayenne pepper. I roasted @15 minutes at 450*F, then reduced the temperature to 300*F for @90 more minutes, basting occasionally... taking the roast out at a temp of 160*F. It was  tender & juicy.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I cut slits into the meat and stuffed, as others suggested. 375 degrees for about an hour and 20 minutes for almost 3 lb roast. Roast was pretty moist, maybe 10 minutes less next time., and I baked in a glass baking dish.

WOW!!! I can't believe how GOOD this is and how EASY!!! I never made a pork roast before, but this is going in to my regular rotation for sure!! I can't believe what I've been missing out on! I had a 2.75lb roast, so I started checking mine after an hour with the meat thermometer. It took about an additional 15-20 minutes. I covered it with foil after that and turned oven off and left in there while I finished up the sides. I made Stove Top stuffing, gravy (for the stuffing, the meat didn't need it but the option was there) and broccoli. Whole family loved it and I was feeding a family of 7! My house still smells awesome!! Thanks for the post!!!

This was a good recipe. I gave it 4 stars because it was a little dry. I put slits in the pork and inserted a clove of garlic in it. (6 total) I also used fresh rosemary. I rested the pork on a bed of apples and onions so it wouldnt burn on the bottom.

I will definitely make this again!  Followed the advice of others to make pockets in the pork loin and stuff garlic and rosemary into them.  Also, cooked at 450 for 1st 10 minutes, then 350 for 90 minutes.  Checked it at 60 minutes as others suggested to shorten bake time, but internal temp wasn't quite up to 165.  Poured a bit of water in bottom of roasting pan before baking and added small amount of garlic, rosemary, and pepper.  Then served over the pork loin.   Excellent, and very easy.

This recipe was amazing, simple and very tasty!! The only thing I would do different next time is to make sure I don't over do the olive oil and make pockets in the meat to get the seasoning flavour more even throughout the whole roast.

Great tasting and easy  recipe with the adjustments I made .  Had a 2.5# pork tenderloin.  Rubbed 1 TBS olive oil  on roast and then rubbed roast (2 pieces which I tied together after seasoning) with 3-4 cloves minced garlic and 2 TBS minced fresh rosemary. Let marinate for 1 hour in refrigerator.  Cooked at 450 F for 10 minutes and then lowered to 250F and cooked for 90 minutes or until reached internal temp of 145 F and let rest for 5 or so minutes.  Moist and very tasty

My whole family loves this recipe.  I make it at least 2-3 times a month.  The simple combination of rosemary and garlic is delicious.  One note about pork tenderloin - for some reason my cooking times are not consistent.  I find it's critical to use a meat thermometer while cooking.  I prefer the ones with the probe that can be left it that alerts you when the meat has reached it's optimal cooking temperature.  This keeps it from being over cooked and becoming dry.

Simple and Fantastic! Used all the ingredients that most anyone would have on hand in their kitchen and produced a BEAUTIFUL cut of pork. I didn't alter the recipe a bit other than to stuff the slivers of Garlic down in some holes poked in the loin and this thing came out as great as some pork dishes I've had at 5-star restaurants here in Dallas.

TRY IT - you won't be disappointed.

This turned out EXCELLENT. We grow our own rosemary so have plenty to spare (and who doesnt love plenty of rosemary?). I did top my slices with  spoonful of roasted pineapple and habanero sauce and not only did it add a little kick, it really complimented the flavor of the rosemary (I used about 5 sprigs - 4 broken and spread over the roast and 1 cut in half and stuffed into the roast).

This was fantastic! I had a small pork loin and just cut the recipe in half, baking for 1 1/2 hours. It was tender and juicy. I covered it with tin foil for the first 30 minutes. I'd say it was the best I've cooked yet.

I added 1/4 Cup basalmic vinegar and breadbrumb to give a tickened paste to stick to the pork.  I reserved some sauce on the side and mixed it with potatoes and cooked it all in one pan.  Meat was moist and potatoes delicious!

This is the way I cook pork roast, and people who thought they didn't like it now like it.  I use garlic, sale rosemary and sage.   Everyone wants to get the pieces with the crunch topping on it.  I always use a meat thermometer, so that it says moist, not overcooked.

This recipe turned out great. I cooked the roast covered with foil for 1 hour, and then removed the foil the last hour. It was very tender & moist - a great dinner paired with mashed potatoes & country style green beans with bacon!

Lovely seasoning for pork roasts (or chops).  Always try to have fresh rosemary on hand because it marries so well with pork.  Good submission.

We blended fresh rosemary and garlic with olive oil then brushed it on a 3 1/2 lb rib roast and grilled it on a gas grill at about 250-300 degrees F for almost six hours, basting every hour or so. Although the griller thought it was a little dry the rest of us didn't, we poured the drippings over the meat when done, (could have made gravy, might have cooked too long). We put carrots and onion under the meat to keep it off the pan and the heat of the grill. The carrots were very tasty, I  generally don't care for them. The rosemary coating was excellent. We'll make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

It only took an hour to cook, which caught me a bit of guard. Definately tasty. Because it cooked so fast the outside did not have time to get nice and brown. I added 1/2 cup red wine half way through, then reduced the cooking liquid for dipping.

I made this but I cut the garlic cloves in half poked them inside the beast and it added to the flavor. My dad loved it and he is a very hard man to please. Very juice. To keep it from becoming too dry check every half hour for internal temp. (this might slow down the cook time but will keep the roast from becoming over-done.

I cooked my pork loin one hour and the internal temp was 160.  It smelled fabulous and the seasoning was nice, however it was extremely dry.  It would have been a burnt mess had I cooked it two hours.

Used the same spices, but put it in the slow cooker for 8 hours. Walking into my house after it was done was so mouthwatering.  Even used to juices at the bottom to make a garlic rosemary gravy for the garlic mashed potatoes I made. Serve with bacon wrapped asparagus!

Very moist and nice flavor.  Had a 3# pork loin roast and cooked in my slow cooker on low for 4 hours (stuck it in there when I came home for lunch).  Flavor was nice, but it could have used some salt.  The pork was falling apart when I cut it, which was fine, but the drippings needed salt to accent the pork flavor.  Took the drippings from the crock pot and added a 1/2 cup water with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon cornstarch blended into it & added it to the drippings...boiled and poured over the meat...this is what it was missing! Husband, son and I liked it, but daughter wouldn't eat it without a spoonful of mashed potatoes at the same time. Overall, I would make it again, but would add salt while it is cooking.

Had a two pound pork sirloin roast and cooked for 1 1/2 hours.  I'm not sure if that was too long because it turned out  a little dry.  Husband still liked it though and wants me to make again.

I have made this easy recipe several times and each time it is delicious. The rosemary aroma has everyone drooling by dinnertime. Any leftover roast (which is doubtful!) is great for sandwiches.

I altered this recipe a little and ended up with Simple Savory Pork Roast from this site.  It was delicious.  Only took 1-1/2 hrs to cook.
Only giving it 4 stars due to my modifications.

This was very good. I did change it,because I used secret recipes garlic mix and roasted red bliss potatoes with pork loin. I still used the rosemary and it was so soft and delicious.

It should be made clear that this receipt is for a cut of "pork shoulder" as depicted in the photo.  NOT for pork tenderloin, which needs no more than 30 minutes at this temperature.

I added veggies, white wine, butter, parsley, basil and it needed 10 minutes more for my oven. Turned out very tender and good but needed more flavor in my opinion.

I made this last night.  My husband and I both loved it!  Followed recipe - took advice from another reviewer & about tripled the olive oil, (fresh) rosemary & garlic.  Mixed all ingredients together, pierced meat & rubbed the mix all over the pork.  I had two pcs. of tenderloin totaling a bit shy of 3 lbs.  Cooked @ 425 degrees for 10 mins. and then dropped oven to 350.  Only took a total of 35-40 minutes to reach 150 degrees.  Highly recommend the use of an instant read thermometer.  The pork tenderloin was extremely moist & flavorful.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  :)

Great reviews from my guests!  Cook time in recipe was too long.  Fortunately, I set timer for 1.5 hours, so I could check on progress.  Tenderloin was done (maybe a bit over done) at the 1.5 hours point.  
I made gravy from drippings (adding a little chicken broth).  Served with Brussel sprouts (roasted and finished in frying pan with maple syrup), and roasted red potatoes(seasoned with fresh thyme).  
Overall, a very good meal!

Pork tenderloin came out tender and moist @ 160 F, not dried out. Use your meat thermometer and you'll have no problems. I think a different cut/pork roast would be more suitable for the ingredient amounts. If using tenderloin, I would reduce the amount of dried rosemary, and lightly season with s&p too. I was fine with the garlic amount. I used crushed rosemary and it was too overpowering. Perhaps that was the mistake. Will try again, reducing the amount of rosemary, and update review accordingly.

Easy and tasty. Use a meat thermometer to be sure you don't overlook.  My pork did not get crusty on the outside, like I like it. I would definitely recommend putting in oven at 450 for 15mins. And then reducing temp to 325. Otherwise a nice recipe that my family enjoyed!

This came out very delicious! Juicy with great flavor, I bought meat thermometer soon as it reached 70c I took it out had enough pan drippings to make a nice gravy  with rich brown color, add a bit salt I find I usually end up with a really pale color gravy unappealing ,cooked this in a Cuisinart pot has a very tight lid
this is the best ever recipe .Thanks for shairng

Delicious and also great for those on a low sodium diet (as long as you check that your pork isn't infused with a sodium solution).

I've made this twice now, and it's delicious. However, based on experience I reduced the cooking time to one hour for a 2 1/2 lb loin. Thanks to the rosemary and garlic, the husband thought I was cooking a lamb! Slice the leftover pork (if there is any) for tasty Cuban sandwiches.

EASY SO GOOD    This was very good. I did change a bit however. I used ingredients,  with salt and pepper, on bone in pork chops.
I BarBQ them and it takes much less time. Started in a foil pan
and moved to grill for last minutes. So moist,so good, so easy.
Iloveit

This recipe was way off in the timing of cooking the pork. After 1.5 hours in oven it wasn't done.

Incredibly good, everyone loved it. Love how simple the recipe was. Since I had two roast I did have to put it for a bit longer. But will make it again for sure.

Outstanding! I made the following additions. I added a good dose of sage and then, on a whim, sprinkled flax seeds and diced onions on top. The coating added succulent richness that was out of this world. Also, we have a convection oven and it took less than an hour at 375° to bring the 1-1/2 lb. pork to 160°.  With convection meats never dry out and cooking time is reduced by 1/4 to a 1/3 of the time.

We used pork tenderloin instead of a roast, which could be cooked for a shorter period of time.  Also used another reviewer's suggestion of using fresh rosemary, as well as extra garlic (sliced up and inserted into pork) and olive oil.  We also seasoned the pork with salt and pepper.  We will be making this again.  May try brining the meat next time to get a slightly more succulent flavor.

This is the best pork roast I have ever eaten!  I followed the recipe just changed the amount to 2 people - it recalculated the recipe for  a 1 lb of roast pork and was perfect for the two of us with leftovers.  Very good, I wouldn't change a thing!  The pork was very tender and was delicious!  This is a keeper for me.

I followed ingredients but put it in the oven at 350. I covered it with foil for about 40 minutes (the recommended temp for the size ) the temp was a bit under when the timer went off so I pulled off the foil and baked another 10 min. It was juicy and delicious. There were no leftovers! I will definitely make this again.

So simple and delicious! 
I used what I had on hand which was dried rosemary and garlic powder.  I rubbed olive oil on the roast and browned it first.  I made the rub and rolled the roast in it and then I put about a 1/4 cup of water in the dish and dropped a chicken bullion cube in it and covered it tightly.
Someone posted that 2 hours was too long to cook it and theirs dried out; so I split the difference and put my in for 1hr 45 mins.  However, I ended having to put it back for another 15 minutes because it was a little pinker in the middle than we like.  I'm not sure what they did or didn't do, but my roast came out tender, juicy, and delicious!  I made gravy with the leftover juices. 
My husband absolutely loved it along with the cabbage, chicken flavored fettuccini and cornbread I made with it.  
I believe it was one of the best dishes I've ever made!
I've never used rosemary on anything before and had to dig it out from the back of my cabinet.  This spice is now in  the front row of my Spicy Rack!

The pictures shows a pork butt roast, but the instructions say to use a tenderloin. Two hours is way too long to cook a tender cut of meat like this. So the others must have used the larger cut of a Boston butt. I wouldn't use a pork loin or tenderloin for this recipe.

Without doubt the best roast pork I have ever made.  As another reviewer suggested, I sliced the garlic into slivers and stuffed the slivers into slits I had cut into the roast.  The glorious garlic flavor seeped into the meat, and didn't just lay on top of it. I rubbed the olive oil into the roast, sprinkled with salt and pepper and used fresh rosemary to sprinkle liberally.  This has been a WOW meal for us and for guests and will continue to be.

Made this last night for the family. We all agreed that it had a good flavor, but two hours was WAY too long for a pork tenderloin. I recommend cooking it for 30 minutes, then adding more time if needed.

As a main dish I think this is very bland. It's juicy, and I loved the rosemary, but overall underwhelming.  However, as a sandwich  - think Cuban! - it's terrific. Slice thick, pair with dill pickles, olive tapenade, cheese; rub the bread with olive oil, and grill.

My family loves this recipe!  But, I cook it in a broiler pan and add about 1.5 cups of water to the bottom of the pan to keep the meat moist.

Very good and very easy.  I added salt & pepper.  My pork tenderloin was only 1-1/2 lbs so I roasted it for 1 hour and then put it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp it up a little.
