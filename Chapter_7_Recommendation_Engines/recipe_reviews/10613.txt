My Belgian mother used to make something similar.  She used an electric waffle iron with extra small squares.  It was imported from Belgium and Dad had to rewire a plug in the kitchen to use it.  The special iron runs at a higher wattage - Mom says it makes a difference.  Maybe you can find an extra small grid waffle iron at a kitchen gadget shop.

My Belgian family mother-in-law made this cookie and called them galettes with the emphasis on ga'lettes.  This year I ordered an electric iron from Palmer Mfg. and made my first batch.  I cut the recipe in half and used 1 oz vanilla, 1 oz rum extract and 1 oz whiskey and 2 lbs dark brown sugar. Very Good.

I tried this with a pizelle iron, but it didn't work out well because the dough is so thick. I couldn't get the insides of the cookies cooked without burning the outsides. I guess the gas burner method is the only good way.

Here's my faimily's (Pierson) version.  I use the giant mixer in my church's kitchen and make at least 3 batches every Christmas. I use clean 2 or 5  gallon buckets with lids and store them in the garage (it's definitely cold in there.) until I have time to make them. We rarely get any - I give them all away.  I also used the antique version for many years, but now am quite happy with the electic version (Palmer Mfg.).  It cooks two at a time and both sides at once!  Gullets -   makes 13 dozen				 2 lbs. 	Butter						 4 lbs. 	Brown sugar					 1 dz. 	Eggs						 Â½ C. 	Rum						 5 lbs. 	Flour

These cookies were crispy with a delicious, rich, buttery flavor--very quick and easy to make.  I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings and increased the vanilla extract to 1/4 tsp instead of 1/8.  I used dark rum, because I didn't have any whiskey in the house.  Then I whipped up the ingredients in the food processor, and there was no need to refrigerate the dough.  After following the rest of the directions in the recipe, I baked the cookies to perfection in a waffle cone griddle.  They tasted very similar to the authentic Belgium Buttery Waffle Cookies that my co-worker brought back to the office from her trip abroad.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will be making them regularly.
