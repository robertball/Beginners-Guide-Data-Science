My husband and I also enjoyed this drink on our honeymoon. Our version is a little different. We use ice, pina colada mix, bananas and irish cream. I have made it for various occasions and everyone wants to know how to make it and if they can have more!!

Wonderful!  I don't drink much, because I dislike the flavor of alcohol, but this drink is like a dessert!  I didn't have coconut cream, so I used light coconut milk instead, which probably cut back on the calories and still tasted awesome.  I will definitely make this again!

I used a very large frozen banana as I did not want to add ice cubes (I'm one of those weirdos who does not like ice in her smoothies). Because I did not have coconut cream, I used a jigger or so of Malibu coconut rum and a jigger of fat free evaporated milk to make it creamy. The irish cream I used was homemade. This was FABULOUS. I loved this cocktail.

Wow! Loved this drink. My husband and I have been wanting to duplicate this recipe since we were on a cruise 8 years ago! I made this for myself, so I cut the recipe in half, then took another reviewer's advise and used frozen pina colada mix (3oz), one banana, 3 oz bailey's, 1 1/2 oz cream of coconut, ice and an ounce or two of pineapple juice. Very good. Thanks for bringing back awesome memories!

This was really yummy! It was more like a smoothie than a drink. Next time we'll cut down a little on the fresh banana so it tastes a bit more alcoholic. We also used coconut milk instead of cream to save a few hundred calories ;-)

I found this a little on the sweet side. I did not use ice but frozen bananas instead. I also omitted the banana liqueur, glad I did because I think it would be sweeter. The Irish cream was homemade.

We also loved these on our honeymoon in St. Lucia! I omitted the banana liqueur and added more banana. We are just not fans of banana liqueur (and our bartender didn't use it). I also concoted my own coconut cream with half and half and coconut extract since I did not have a can of Coco Lopez on hand. My husband really enjoyed his BBC as an after dinner treat!

This is amazing!  My husband and I have been looking for a recipe for the BBC that we had at Sandals St. Lucia and this is it!  It's the perfect island drink!  Yay! I'm so excited!

I
loved this cocktail so much. It's a great island drink, reminds me of
tropics. I substituted banana syrup for banana liqueur and used coconut
milk. I will use this recipe over and over.

I have to give this 4 stars because I followed the advice of another reviewer.  I used approximately 2 cups of crushed ice, 4 ounces of pina colada mix, 2 ounces of Bailey's Irish Cream, and 2 ounces of cream de banana and blended it all together.  For taste I would give it 5 stars.  Thank you!

Yummy! Didn't have any banana liqueur, but the bananas were ripe enough that it had great banana flavor.  This is definitely a keeper.

Way too much coconut is called for, I put about 2 or 3oz. and one more cup of ice... that came out really well.
