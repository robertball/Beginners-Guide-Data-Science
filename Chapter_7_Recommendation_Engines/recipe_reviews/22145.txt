Really good...I had no idea how much 3-1/2 lbs. apples meant in cups, so I used 5 very large apples,which worked out fine.  The addition of maple syrup to the crispy crust is a great idea.

This is a delicious dessert. I made it for my friends and they loved it. I took the suggestion of someone else who tried this recipe and used pecans instead of walnuts (just preference) and it tasted great. I also sprinkled cinnamon over the apples and top layer, and it was a great touch to an already sweet treat.

This is really GREAT!!!  Very easy to make - I did add more apples and added cinnamon to them, and used pecans.  Also, as suggested, put some of the crust on the bottom. Great fall dessert, esp w/ vanilla icecream!!!!!!  A keeper!!!!!

This recipe was so good, I used peaches the second time.  It didn't even last long enough to get cold.  My family wants it all of the time.

Great receipe.  We finished it right off, and was asked to make more right away so I cut down the receipe to fit the four apples I had left.  Also the second time I added the oatmeal crust to the bottom as well as the top.  I will make this every weekend for the rest of fall.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was the most delicious apple crisp recipe we ever tasted.  I substituted apples and cinnamon instant oatmeal instead of maple and brown sugar.

This was a great recipe.  Even my husband who normally won't eat desserts ate this.  I sprinkled a cinnamon & nutmeg mixture over the top.  A wonderful fall treat.

I was looking for an apple crisp recipe similar to what I had growing up, but this wasn't it.  It was good though, just not what I was looking for.  This tasted just like oatmeal cookies with apples -- a great combination.  I think it would be good with raisins in it!

This is the most unbelievable apple crisp ever!  YUM!  The company I made it for also loved it.  I too added cinnamon to the apples and served it with vanilla ice cream.  This is truly a great fall dessert.

My 10 year old daughter has been cooking since she was five years old, but this recipe is easy enough (with help peeling apples) for children. Also, they enjoy drizzling on the syrup.  I served it twice and had excellent reviews.  I just modified it by adding cinnamon to the top before baking.  This was also the first recipe from your site so I am sure I will try out more as needed.

This is a quick and easy dessert to make!!!

The topping is crunchy & delicious!!!  

It's especially good when it's hot and topped w/vanilla ice cream!!!

Good for a quick breakfast too!!!!   You get fruit & oatmeal all at once!!

Try mixing the apples w/blueberries or raseberries.  Add almonds & raisins to the topping.

I just pulled this from the oven, and practically ran to the computer to give it a 5 star rating.  The topping on this apple crisp is heavenly.  I was a little concerned with how dry it all looked before going into the oven, but never should have worried!  I used granny smith apples, and tossed with a little sugar and cinnamon, and I also added some extra cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping, as well as a little extra walnuts.  This is fabulous!  The whole house smells heavenly.  My family is always looking for great recipes to share, and I'll be emailing this one tomorrow!  Thanks!

Excellent recipe for apple crisp! I didn't have any instant pkgs of oatmeal w/ brown sugar so I used 3/4c of quick-cooking oatmeal.  Also, I added 1/2tsp of cinnamon.  Since I was using apples from our apple tree - I had to guesstimate. Looking back, I think I could have used more apples but overall, a wonderful fall recipe and a perfect way to use up those apples from the tree. This was devoured in one day! Thanks Gracia!

I tossed the cored, sliced apples with about 1/4 cup of white sugar, and a teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon. I didn't have packaged oatmeal, so I used about 1/2 cup quick oats instead. I put half the apples in the dish, half the crumble mix, then the rest of the apples topped by the remaining crumble mix and topped w/maple syrup.  Turned out great!

I followed the recipe as is except for subbing pecans for walnuts, and we did not care for this at all.  The topping was very "flour-y", dry and bland, not very sweet. I made this for my husband and brother-in-law who both love apple crisp, and honestly it was the worst we've ever had.  I've made tons of apple crisp before, and really hoped to like this recipe for something new.  It's possible I messed something up, but apple crisp is pretty foolproof I think.

Wonderful recipe.  I have done it as it and I have also cut it in half.  I have also reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup.  Still works beautifully.

Terrific recipe! Just to let you know 3 1/2 pounds is about 8 medium apples. I made a few changes to this recipe just because of the ingredients I had on hand. I used 7 medium granny smith apples. First I core my apples, and then I use a peeler to peel them. When I slice them I end up with 1/4 inch thick apple rings. This I have found is the quickest and easiest method for me. I used margarine instead of butter. I used 2 packets of cinnamon roll instant oatmeal and 1/2 cup quick oats. I used 1/4 cup pecans rather than the walnuts. I added a splash of vanilla when I mixed the butter and brown sugar. The syrup I used was Hungry Jack Lite Butter flavored. This recipe was perfect and I will make it again and again!!! Next time I will use a few less apples and add some blueberries! Mm mm good! :)

This is a very tasty, moist apple crisp.  I prepared it for a family gathering, in my 9x13 baking stone...the top was crunchy and the apples were moist.  All the apple crisp connoisseurs attending loved it.  Next time though, I plan on sprinkling the apples with cinnamon sugar prior to topping, wasn't quite sweet enough for my tastes and besides apple crisp and cinnamon go hand in hand.  I have added this to my file and will be making it again...thanks!

This was very good.  I doubled the oatmeal part and used half on the bottom and half on the top.  I don't think this is necessary but it did taste very good.  I'll try next time with just the oatmeal on top.  One thing I did that I think made it EXCELLENT was used caramel ice cream topping instead of syrup and added it during the last 15-20 minutes of baking.  Also sprinkled apples with cinnamon and didn't use nuts.  SOOOO good with icecream.  Did kinda feel like eating really yummy oatmeal but I'm not complaining!

Was looking for a wheat free gluten free recipe.  We had a bag of apples that needed to be used up.  I don't really like to alter the recipes shared here, but I had to for my husband.  I substitued two things...1 cup of ground corn flake crumbs for the 1 cup of flour.....3/4 cup of old fashioned oats for the instant packets.  It was really wonderful.  Thanks for sharing.  We'll use this again and again.  I added cinnamon also because we were lacking spices from the instant oatmeal. Edit to add....we had the leftovers with vanillla ice cream.  Really delicious!  Thanks again.

Fabulous!!!! Like other reviewers I added some cinnamon, vanilla and a dash of nutmeg to the apples. I also added in two extra packets of the instant oatmeal so I could stretch the topping and put it on the bottom of the pan. The result is amazing! My mom said this was the best apple crisp she's even had... it was just excellent!

Wow!! Knock your socks off- apple crisp! I never thought of using instant oatmeal packets, but it worked really well. I used two plain and one with cinnamon and it came out great! The maple syrup really makes the difference. I will be using this recipe for years to come!

I used canned baked apples - draining most of the juice out and followed the rest of this recipe. Didn't have to cook as long because I used already cooked cinnamon apples, was a quick dessert. This was delicious.  I especially liked the instant brown sugar oatmeal as the topping.  Yum...

This was pretty good! I made a few subsitutions- I did not have all of those apples on hand so I used some pears. I also used margarine and Splenda brown sugar mix, weight control quaker oatmeal and sugar free syrup. It turned out wonderfully! My hubby liked it as well, so I will be makingthis again for sure :) Thanks!!

Great Apple Crisp recipe! My family LOVED it!  I actually made twice the recipe and had  a few substitutions of what I had on hand.  I used rolled oats instead of the instant kind and finely chopped pecans instead of walnuts and it turned out great!

Serve it hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you've got pure DECADENCE!!

A bit more or less of any of the ingredients don't make much difference for this recipe, so you definitely can't go wrong. The topping was good, but nothing spectacular. I put some topping at the bottom as a crust, as suggested, and it came out too mushy - I think it would've been better if I baked the crust first, baste it with egg white, then add the apples + topping and bake again.

Instead of regular butter, I used the fat free squeeze kind of butter and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It was a hit with my family without all the fat! Yumm!

Absolutely Delish!!!  I used about 8 large apples of different types, added cinnamon, nutmeg and some flaxseed.  I also used whole wheat flour.  Tried the suggestion of putting the crust on the top & bottom as well!  Turned out fabulous! Served over vanilla ice cream- everyone went back for seconds!!

LOVE IT! My dad always made apple crisp growing up, but sorry dad, this tops it! lol I wasn't sure how many apples to use, so I peeled 6 large apples and it filled a 9x13 and an 8x8 pan. I coated the apples in a sugar and cinnamon mixture first, and I doubled the crust recipe. I just used 3/4 cup regular quick oats instead of packets and it was just fine. I also sprinkled some nutmeg and cloves on top. (I did not put in any nuts) It came out perfect and everyone loved it! The maple syrup idea is brilliant. This one is a keeper.

This recipe sooooo rocks!!!!  I am living in Peru, and try to cook different "American" dishes with ingrediants I can find here, to accustom my 2 stepsons to the different food.  Sometimes its a success, other times, not so much...but this was a definate keeper.  The whole family loved it, even my older son who doesn't care for apples.  I notice some reviewers had too chewy or too hard topping, mine came out just perfect for me.  Next time, I probably will follow advice and sprinkle cinnamon over the apples before i put on the topping.  Thanks for such a kickin' recipe!!

This recipe is awesome. I also added cinnamon like others suggested and it turned out great. I also used a secret that my mom taught me which is when baking an apple pie you should use three different types of apples. This works with apple crisp too. The difference in the apples sweetness and tartness makes for a wonderful flavor.

This is a wonderful and very easy to make recipe.  This is great for when you have leftover apples from picking and you are sick of pies and looking for something different. 
I did not have maple and brown sugar oatmeal so I used apple cinnamon flavor instant oatmeal and it turned out just as good.  This would also make a great potluck dish too.

This is so much better than any other apple crisp I have tried. Loved the added flavor of the maple syrup and nuts in topping. I did sprinkle cinnamon/sugar over the apples mostly because I think I would of missed the cinnamon AND because the apples were turning brown while making the topping. This has a nice balance of apple flavor  to sweet(like the brown sugar so much better than white with apples) and the crunch from the nuts is an extra that I will miss in other apple crisps after trying this.  I chose to use pecans;they are so similar in flavor but don't seem to go "rancid" as easily as walnuts do, in storage (who uses a whole bag at once?). Using a POTATO PEELER and an apple slicer/corer tool the prep only took about 15 minutes. Since the bags of apples I purchase come in 3 lbs. I added 2 small apples to a 3 lb. bag of Mcintosh. Next time I will use closer to 4 lbs. for a thicker apple layer. Gracia, if this is what you come up with when you are bored... I am looking for more recipes by you! Outstanding! And hard to believe all that flavor has only 8 gr. fat per serv. Not exactly lowfat, but not as bad as some of the other apple crisp recipes.

This was very good at a company outing and had several requests for the recipe.  However, I used more apples (5 lbs.) for a 9x13 dish and there still was room for more.  I also did not use the maple syrup because with the cup of brown sugar and the packaged oatmeal loaded with sugar, it seemed too much to me, and even without it, it was still very sweet.  Will definitely make again.

I was desperate for a dessert for a church function of at least 80 people. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe! The apples were tender and the topping crunchy. The syrup gave it a little extra sweetness and this was soooo easy to make (with the exception of peeling all those apples!) Absolutely delicious...rivals some expensive premade apple pies but so much cheaper.

This was an excellent dessert to make. It was so tasty. Usually I don't care to much for some apple desserts but I had left over apples that were on the verge of wrinkling so I decided to make this. I am glad I did and would make it again. I followed the recipe exactly but I did sprinkle cinnamon on top because what is an apple dessert without cinnamon.

I liked the packets of oatmeal a lot for the crisp. Very easy and worked well. I used a caramel butterscotch ice cream topping in place of the maple syrup but used way too much which made the crisp very chewy. It did however taste like a delicious caramel apple in a bowl. I highly recommend serving this with vanilla ice cream. It is not nearly as good without it.

Really yummy and easy.  I halved the recipe but kept the butter at a 1/2 cup and added a teaspoon of vanilla to the sugar and butter mixture.  I also didn't use the maple syrup and it came out perfectly.  My guests asked me what I used to make the crust so crunchy and yummy and they were shocked when I pulled out the instant oatmeal box.  Here's how I layered mine:  Half of the oatmeal mixture, five honey crisp apples, a teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon sprinkled over the apples and finally the remainder of the oatmeal mixture on top.  I also buttered the pan before baking.  I had to bake it earlier in the day but I put it in the oven on on warm for about 20 minutes before serving and it was perfect.  Will definitely be making again!

I just made this for my family. I switched out the maple & brown sugar oatmeal for the apple & cinnamon. It was wonderful. I do think next time I will coat the apples in a brown sugar and cinnamon mix as i simply like more sweet and cinnamon, but the recipe was great, especially if you are looking at a dessert that is not as sweet. It is super easy to make as well.

For flavor, this would have to be a 5+ stars. However, it was a bit too sweet, and that's why the four stars. Very easy to make, delicous flavours, one of the best crumbles ever, probably the best so far if I had cut down on the sugar. Perfect texture as well. I used fugi apples, and they were perfect for this. Not any kind of apples would work though. McIntosh or red delicious for example would not work. They are not good apples for baking, because they fall apart and do not hold their shape during baking. The kind of apples used plays a huge role in a baked recipe, and can determine whether a good recipe turns out good, or bad. Anyway, next time, I will cut down a lot on sugar, maybe omit all together, and just add the syrup.

This is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO yummy! I made half the recipe in a 9" pie plate, omitted the nuts and added a little freshly ground cinnamon. Served a la mode, this is dynamite!

Great!  I didn't have any instant oatmeal so I used 1/2 cup rolled oats and 1/2 cup granola.  Next time I'll add 2 pinches of salt, but that is just my personal preference.  The walnuts and maple really made this!  I served this with vanilla ice cream. YUM!  Thanks, Gracia!

Yummy...Yummy...Yummy...
My husband saw me putting this recipe together and said "there's enough there to feed an army!".. Well let me tell you, between him and my 13 year old son, the apple crisp was gone in less than one day!!  (The only adjustment I made was sprinkling the apples with a 1/2 cup granulated sugar & 1 tsp cinnamon mixture before putting the topping on).  Great recipe, I was afraid at first to use the maple syrup, but I did and loved it.
Thank-you, definitely a keeper!!

I made this for a large crowd of hungry skiiers.  I sprinkled apple pie spice mix and maybe 1/4 cup of white sugar over the apples to coat them, then added the topping.  I threw in an extra envelope of oatmeal and doubled the nuts since I like a lot of crisp.  It was fantastic.

I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings, stirred cinnamon and two crumbled Nutri-Grain Apple-Cinnamon bars through the apples. Then I added cinnamon to the topping mixture and used little pieces of real butter instead of syrup. And I used instant apple-cinnamon oatmeal, no nuts. MMMM! I also used a 3:1 mixture of gala and granny smith apples. The best recipes are the ones you improvise. Great recipe. Can't wait to make it again!

Seemed to like, but they seemed to like the simple cinnamon and sugar easy recipe just as much.  Maybe try again with the changes in the notes.

This recipe was fantastic!!! My husband ate most of it and he hates apples! :) I used a variety of apples which were; honey crisp, jonagold, and yellow delicious, I think this gave it a deeper flavor. To add even more flavor I also used cinnamon-pear maple syrup instead of plain and I imagine that using pear slices and cinnamon instead would give the same result. I certainly would only real maple syrup, I don't think that the "fake" stuff would have the same fresh flavor.

It was alright and I had all the ingredients on hand but the apples completely disintigrated and it was like a mush instead of a crisp.  Oh well.

This is really tasty and easy to make. I have made it twice. The first time I was just looking for a way to use up apples before they went bad. We shared it with friends and then they requested I make it for Christmas dinner!

I didn't have oatmeal packets - NOR enough instant oatmeal, so I used what I did have - about 1/4 c., and then used whole wheat flour instead of white, and it turned out great.  I left the nuts out.  Flavor wasn't a problem - I threw a scattering of frozen whole cranberries over the apples before adding the topping and it turned out bubbly and delicious!  It's very sweet (had never made with maple syrup before), so if that's not your thing I would cut the sugar as suggested in other reviews (cranberries help too!).

Really scrumptious! I made Some changes: cut sugar to 3/4 cup; used 3/4 cup of rolled oats instead of oat packets; instead of nuts, added 1/2 cup of sweetened coconut flakes (which added a nice flavor and a layer of texture); tossed 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and some honey with cubed 3 granny smith apples and 2 tiny gala apples. It was definitely NOT bland. This recipe is exactly what it claims to be -- a basic apple crisp recipe. It's up to you to personalize it and make it distinctly yours!

This recipe came out just as I expected...great!!  I adjusted it for my own tastes.  I drizzled extra maple syrup on the tart, Cortland apples before I added the oatmeal mixture.  Also, I didn't have oatmeal packets, so I substituted 2/3 cups instant oatmeal, 1/4 cup brown sugar and an extra pinch of salt.

This was very yummy Gracia.  I did over cook mine just a tad, so the oatmeal mixture was a little hard.  I did double the topping to cover all of the apples and used about 6 large granny smith.  I did not use the water and I tossed my apples in a large bowl with twice as much sugar called for (they were very tart) and the cinnamon.  This made my house smell soooo good.  I would make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Fabulous...Thought that it needed a bit more of a cinnamon taste though, will probably use brown sugar and cinnamon oatmeal next time as well as sprinkling it on the apples.  The boyfriend loved it--even though he doesn't like nuts, I thought the walnuts were great!

I appreciate a variety of ways of making apple crisp. Based on this recipe I adapted the following.  I omitted the nuts. For dry ingredients I used equal parts of flour, brown sugar, oatmeal and one stick of chopped butter.  I used a cast iron skillet with lid to cook apples with cinnamon, a dash of almond extract, nutmeg and butter. 350° for 30 minutes.  I sprinkled the dry ingredients over the apples. Place back in the oven uncovered.  400° for 15 minutes. Or until golden brown. Cool for 30 minutes and scoop into serving dishes.

First note: I doubled this recipe to take to a potluck.  That said,
I tweaked mine (as I usually do) by adding about 2 tablespoons more sugar and 2 tablespoons more butter, plus less flour by about 1/4 cup and I cheated (lol) by using Quaker instant oatmeal that already had nuts (raisin, date, and walnut flavor, to be exact).  By using more butter and less flour, I could 'pat' the topping on to be sure to cover all the apples fully and it baked up perfectly in about 55 mins.  I also omitted the maple syrup because I thought the additional sugar (plus whatever flavoring was in the instant oatmeal) would be sufficient.  Both dishes I brought were large (15x10 or 12) and were scraped clean in under 90 minutes!  And no, there wasn't more than say 25 people (max) at this potluck.

Everyone in the family loved it including my 20 month old! I followed a tip from another reviewer and added cinnamon on top. Next time I think I will try it with peach as another reviewer mentioned!
I didn't even peel the apples it wasn't necessary but I used a mixture of Gala & Fuji.

Loved this recipe! I substituted pecans for walnuts, added a touch of apple pie spice and drizzled caramel topping over the top instead of maple syrup. Perfect recipe for my boyfriend and son who do not care a lot for chocolate desserts. Will make again.

I loved it instead of maple oatmeal I used walnut, dates and rasin oatmeal (It was all I had lol) and I think it turned out better bc it wasn't as sweet pluse the syrup made it sweet enough!

I thought this was a very good apple crisp recipe. The maple syrup gave it a nice added flavor from other crisps I have made. I didn't have packets of instant oatmeal on hand but just added regular quaker oats and it came out fine.

This came out pretty good. Mine was a little dry, and I'll probably add some milk next time. But overall it had good flavor and the apples were nicely cooked. I would also recommend adding more syrup to the top to help out with the moisture. I will most likely try this recipe again.

Although this recipe tasted ok, I will probably not make it again.  Needed more flavor, even after I added cinnamon.  Topping was pretty good, just not the what I was hoping for.  Good one for the first Apple Crisp I have ever made, but will look for a different recipe next time.  Thanks though!

I have apples in my back yard that don't seem to have much flavour when baked with.  I tried this recipe with those apples, and I got rave reviews from my friends to whom I had served it to.  I suggest doing what I did; I baked it one and a half hours before we wanted to eat it, and therefore, we had freshly baked apple crisp  a la mode.  I don't eat a lot of apple crisp, but this is definitley a keeper.

My hubby and I were quite please with the little ditty.  I like the maple syrup--it added a nice, sweet touch.  I usually like a crispier apple crisp, but this was a nice change.

Sorry to break the streak - this was good but not the best I've had - I kinda like a "crispier" crisp - the instant packets didn't quite cut it for me - I'm looking for a more granolesque baked crisp - I'll keep looking.  But overall for a party it was gobbled up.

This was really quick and easy, and it smelled great while cooking!  I also added some cinnamon like others suggested.  To make the cutting and peeling go faster (like less than 5 minutes), I used the Apple Peeler/ Corer/ Slicer sold by Pampered Chef.  (I don't sell their stuff, but that gadget is great for this kind of recipe.)

We love this recipe! It was really easy.  I  forgot the maple syrup - but it was still delicious!! I was out of instant maple and brown sugar oatmeal packets - so I used apple cinnamon instead - yummmmy.

Definitely a thumbs up from my family. 
Thanks!!

Positively Outstanding!!! I can't believe one review thought it was dry. Certainly not me. Like some folks, I substituted apple and cinnamon instant oatmeal, mainly because that's all I had. And, I put some of the crumb mix on the bottom. My thinking was, so it doesn't collapse as easily. It worked. And lastly, a little sprinkle of cinnamon on the apples and again on top. Definitely a keeper.

Omg good!, I was looking for a recipe that involves instant oatmeal because that’s what I had on hand. I cut the recipe into 1/3 and used single serve baking dishes. I love the ooey gooey part. It turned out better than expected. This I will definitely make again

I will DEFINITELY  make this recipe again!  I used 5 large apples, which worked out fine. To core and peel the apples I used a gizmo to help me. I used 1 cup oatmeal instead of the 3 packets of instant oatmeal, which worked out fine. I also added 1/2 teaspoon  cinnamon. Very delicious!

I prefer an old-fashioned recipe with more natural ingredients vs. relying on pre-made oatmeal packets. It's pretty easy to make this a legit way and use spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.  Also, I recommend putting a bit of orange juice in with the apples to prevent oxidation. Try another recipe.

I used five medium red apples but could have added one or two more. Also I didn't have instant oatmeal so I used one and a half cups raw oatmeal.  I think it helped to give it a better crunch.

I have made this recipe for years! Always a favorite.  The first few times I made it as written, which turns out wonderful! Then have tried to tweek it to make it healthier.  I have added 4 tbs instead of the 6 it calls for,  I also leave out the syrup. Still delicious!

I used the crumb portion only as I had canned apples on hand that I had done.  Loved the crispy nutty flavours but my maple syrup was mildly flavoured and was not pronounced.  I will make this crumb mixture again.

I really didn't like the way the crust tasted the oatmeal tasted strange to me and it didn't have enough flavour. I wouldn't do this one again needed cinnamon or nutmeg or both and it just was a little off for me

Wow! Brilliant idea to improvise rolled oats for instant oatmeal! I had cinnamon flavor and used honey crisp apples. Delicious for this first day of fall!

Made this the other night for my Husband, Son and Father-in-law. They all LOVED it and it's now it's in my recipe binder. I did add cinnamon as recommended on one of the reviews. The maple and nuts gives it wonder flavor and makes the topping nice and crisp.

I've used this recipe a few times now and the last time I used it I accidently used twice as much butter meaning that I needed to double the recipe of the topping.  I used almost all of the double recipe of topping for the 3lbs. of apples I had and it was gone in 10 minutes!!!  I do like sweet food and so did my guests that day so it worked out great.  I will always make twice as much topping from now on.  Thank you for a new found family desert!!

This needed something ... I had to sprinkle Apple Pie Spice after tasting it. It was too bland.  I like that Autumn apple taste, maybe without the cinnamon it just wasn't what I expected.  If you add spices to your liking, this recipe is easy and bakes beautifully..  I used a glass dish at 325 for 55 min.   Perfect.  Great with vanilla ice cream....

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made it several times and follow the recipe exactly and have always had a perfect apple crisp.

This was okay.  I also added extra cinnamon.  I felt like the maple taste just didn't belong there.  Plus, the baking time is a little long.  The topping was hard in spots.  I'll look for a different recipe for apple crisp.
