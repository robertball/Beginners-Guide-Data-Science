My mom started serving this at Thanksgiving and Christmas as an alternative to the lime jello mold thing my grandmother used to make that no one liked.  It's delicious!  The tang of the cranberries combined with the citrus pineapple and sweet whipped topping is delicious with turkey or ham.  Always make the day before and just pop in the fridge until dinner time, and hope the kids haven't been into it so there's enough for everyone!

My friend gave me this recipe and I make it for every  Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It's easy and delicious - and I don't even like cranberries.  It's a wonderful alternative to traditional cranberry sauce and is more like a dessert, which is why I love it.  I'm going to try making it a little differently based on another reviewer whose family got the recipe off the back of a package of cranberries.  They let the cranberries sit for a couple of hours, then mix everything together and let it sit overnight.  The leftovers have always been great, so mixing it all together the night before will save a step (and at least a few minutes) on the actual holiday, when I'm busy with the rest of the meal.  This is a great recipe!

This recipe is older than me, and I'm 52! We first found it on the back of a cranberry package.  My family has been making it for decades, but we don't refrigerate only the sugar and cranberries overnight....we mix in the cranberries, marshmallows, and pineapple and let it set for about 2-3 hours, and then we fold in the fresh heavy whipping cream, freshly chopped pecans, and I like to use organic maple sugar - makes it even more rich tasting - and then place in refrigerator overnight before serving.
