This is good stuff!  I followed the recipe, in spirit, w/a few minor tweaks based on what we had on hand.  I used previously frozen (and thawed) pizza dough (Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site).  We always keep shredded grilled chicken in the freezer, so I was able to simply heat the butter/Red Hot/chicken and eliminate the boil.  Operating on rote, I sprayed and cornmealed the pan before spreading the dough (and liked the texture it added).  After spreading the chicken over the base cheese, I squirted a bit of light ranch dressing, followed by the final cheese.  I used Kraft's "Pizza Blend" shredded cheese, w/a bit of shredded white cheddar, too.  This baked 20 minutes in our over, followed by a few minutes under broil to brown the top.  Our one complaint, if you will, is it was quite salty (and I love salt).  I'll search for a low sodium hot sauce to use next time.  THANKS for the recipe!

Recipe Group Selection:  31, January 2015 ~ My DH and I really enjoyed this calzone.  I changed my cooking method to baking the chicken, as Christina did.  I baked the chicken the day ahead and reheated on the stove top with the butter and buffalo sauce. We like celery with our buffalo dishes, so I made half the calzone as written and the other half I added diced celery to the chicken mixture.   When I make this again, I will add celery to all of it.  This is very filling and lasted us for 2 dinners with enough leftover for DH lunch.  Great recipe that I will make again.  Served 'Broccoli and Cauliflower Salad' from AR with it.

I made this calzone for a New Year's Eve party and it was gone before any other item. I made it again the next night for my family and the neighborhood kids and they raved about it.  To save time I bought a 2lb prepared chicken at the grocery store and shredded that.  This recipe was super fast and super good. Thanks for this recipe - I'll be making it again!

This had great buffalo flavor and was so easy to put together.  Especially if you cheat and use leftover grilled chicken!  I used thin refrigerated pizza crust, which worked great.  Obviously, a homemade crust would have taken this up a notch, but for a quick, easy meal, it was pretty tasty!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, lukeybear2007!

This was really good, but, as I usually do, I embellished the recipe.  I cooked six small red potatoes, quartered, in a pot, and smashed them with a little more Frank's, probably another quarter cup. They soaked it right up. It was actually a little too much, so I have some lunch tomorrow!  I made two calzones, dividing the store bought Publix dough in two.  I followed the chicken measurements and Franks.  I rolled two mini circles, keeping a little mound of flour nearby to pat my palms into.  I spread out the chicken mixture.  I added a tablespoon of Parmesan cheese on each. Then added the mozzarella cheese and then patted some smashed potatoes on top. I put each on a large cookie sheet covered in parchment, sprinkled with yellow cornmeal.  I set the two sealed calzones on it, and baked them in my convection oven on 420 for 20 minutes. Oh, I also had sliced tomatoes and basil that I put on top of each after I rubbed them with olive oil.  So, it took a little longer to bake because of the potatoes.  I will definitely do this one again!

Yum!  These were very good.  I made a homemade pizza dough and my calzones ended up a little bready, but I'll bet with pre-made dough or biscuit mix, it would be even better.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was a great base recipe.  The only changes I made were to add chopped red peppers on top of the chicken, then to drizzle ranch dressing over the top, then add the mozzarella cheese.  Will definitely make again!

First time, turned out great!

Few tips, put the dough on a pan before adding ingredients. Trying to move the calzone full of stuffing to a pan is quite difficult!

I add 1/4 block cream cheese to the chicken/buffalo sauce mixture, makes the calzone a bit creamier and I prefer it that way!

I don't put the mixture over the entire dough, just half and fold the dough over top.

I have tried this using dough from a bakery that was frozen and the pre rolled dough from the dairy section. Don't use the pre rolled dough from the dairy section of your grocery store it sucks. Use the real stuff from the bakery department you can find in the frozen aisle or sometimes in the bakery dept cooler. Or make your own (I'm not doing that).

One of these calzones is enough to feed 2 people with massive appetites. Could feed 3 maybe even 4 if you're feeding small kids!

Great recipe cook all the time now!

The recipe was quick and easy to make.  My kids and hubby absolutely loved it!  I used the pillsbury pizza crust and doubled the recipe.  I plan to make it more frequently.  I even taught my teenage son (17 years old) how to make it in preparation for dorm life. :-)

I had leftover pizza dough, from Chef Rider's Quick & Easy Pizza Crust, toppings (ham, rotissarie chicken, Bell pepper, black olives). I spread out dough, lightly put avocado oil on it, added a couple spoonfuls of jarred garlic & basil spaghetti sauce, shredded cheese, chicken, ham, black olives, Bell pepper, and more cheese over half of the dough. Then folded other half on top & pinched edges together. Lightly oiled the top, placed it in the oven for 10 min, flipped and baked another 3 min. It was really good! Maybe a little less filling next time.

I had a can of crescent rolls to use up so I made this recipe.
I didn't measure anything and I didn't have the exact ingredients and it still turned out delicious. I cooked up one chicken breast and shredded it. I didn't have Buffalo sauce so I used half a bottle of Frank's Red Hot Kickin' BBQ sauce. I also had a small amount of frozen corn that I wanted to get used up, so I cooked that and mixed that in also with the chicken, butter, and sauce.  I didn't have mozzarella so I used what I had: Cheddar Jack. I used less than a cup of cheese because I used Blue Cheese dressing as a dip and I figured that was more than enough cheese.
The only thing I didn't like was the thinness of the crust. I will assume it's because I used crescent roll dough instead of pizza crust dough. The next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I will use a pizza crust.

Made for Recipe Group. I thought I had pizza dough, ended up with crescent sheet, so I used that. Worked out fine. Good taste, everyone liked it. I did add in some Ranch to the mix, only had mixed cheddar(thought I had the mozz too), and I used some previously baked shredded chicken I had in the freezer. Quick, easy, and tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe.  I cut my dough into 2 individual calzones, although the chicken didn’t fully fit. The added a little bit of chopped celery into the chicken mixture. Then I tossed about 2tsp of blue cheese into the calzone before closing instead of dipping in dressing. Delish!

LOVE this recipe! It’s so easy, makes amazing leftovers, and tastes great with ranch. However the first time I made it the bottom of the crust burned. I cook it at 375 for 20 minutes

Only made this recipe once (glitch caused it to say 3x), but I'll be making it again. What a tasty and simple dish! I used barbecue sauce instead of Buffalo sauce because it's too spicy for me.  Also added some onions. Very flavorful!

FYI, this is a stromboli, not a calzone. A calzone is smaller, filled with cheese and cooked in the fryer. This was a great stromboli recipe and my family loved it...but we used Ranch dressing and Blue cheese dressing as dips.

This was a big hit with my family. I added onions to my husband's calzone and some fresh dried oregano to the tops! Will definitely make this again!

I made this with the bought pizza dough but rolled it up like a pizza roll, rather than folding it over like a calzone.  Otherwise, I chopped up a stalk of celery and drizzled some ranch dressing on the stuffing.  Very good recipe, forgot to serve with more ranch dressing which would have made it so much better but very good as is, too!

Good Buffalo chicken flavor.  I added an extra slug of wing sauce (Frank's Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce) and I pan-fried the chicken because I refuse to boil chicken unless I'm making soup as it leaves the chicken tasteless and rubbery.   Still, a good dish; served with a tossed salad topped with blue cheese or ranch dressing.

I did find this recipe very easy to make, but I made my own dough in my bread maker.  The taste was very well blended with just the right amount of spices, and brushing on the olive oil before and after filling, made the dough even tastier.  I sprinkled some garlic powder on the outside of the calzone before baking.

This was an easy delicious recipe to make!  I will definitely make it  again. I simplified it even more by slicing the chicken and cooking it in the butter  instead of boiling it first.

Very easy and my kids ate every bite.  I made it into a "pizza" instead of a calzone b/c I needed to feed more people and by folding the dough in 1/2 would have only fed 1/2 of the family.  But next time I will buy more dough and make the calzone.  


I also added some onions.  My family likes onions.

I made this but changed a few things. First I added a little more  hot sauce, I love Texas Pete and used 4 table spoons of butter. Then I mixed Marzetti Blue Cheese Dressing about 2 and a half table spoons in with the chicken and sauce mixture. And for a little more spice, I finely dice up a half stick of celery and add it to the mixture also. My wife can't get enough of this and all my friends beg for me to make it.

Great idea!! I changed it up a bit to make it my own. I used chicken thighs and coated them in Italian style bread crumbs before frying them, then shredded those with forks and heated again in the sauce. More of a crunchy texture. I also fried separately 1 red onion, 8 sliced mushrooms and 3 sliced stalks of celery. I added that to the calzone as as later. I rolled out pizza dough into a 18" round. Unfortunately, I didn't have mozzarella cheese, so I used marble. For a finishing touch, I sprinkled some Italian style bread crumbs on top before putting it in the oven. I used convection bake and found it was too cooked at 410 degrees and 17 minutes. I will next time convect bake it at 400 for 15 minutes. That should be plenty. Great idea and thank you for the inspiration! :-)

A real calzone has more cheese, ricotta in particular.  I liked LOVETOHOST's suggestion to spray and cornmeal the dough.  I  mixed the mozzarella cheese with the ricotta with additional buffalo sauce.  Now we are taking calzone!

I diced the chicken and cooked it like that rather than shredding it after.  The amount of hot sauce needs to be carefully adjusted depending on the brand used.

This recipe was just OK.   There really wasn't much flavor in the filling.  Maybe a little dip in some hot sauce would help.  I probably won't make this again.

I really wanted to like this more than I did. Perhaps if I had baked the chicken it would not have been dry. The underlying issue is that I much prefer a traditional  calzone, and I prefer the Buffalo wings.

This was pretty tasty and easy to make. I used a rotisserie chicken to skip one step. I used Frank’s Red Hot and Pillsbury pizza dough. Next time I will check it after 15 minutes in the oven because it was quite browned after 17 minutes. I’ll also use more chicken and roll the dough thinner. I will definitely make it again though!

Grilled the chicken before shredding.  Added a roasted red pepper.  Used 1/3 cup of sauce because we like very spicy.  I agree its better to have the dough on the prepared pan before folding the dough.

Made this for our local football watch party and it was gone before the end of the first quarter! Added the Chipotle Chili Powder suggested by one person and it added that special smoky flavor that everyone commented on. this one's a keeper!

Everyone in my household loved this.  It was a super easy and quick weeknight meal.  I was asked to make it again a few days later for a college football party.  It was hit at the party too.

We made it for the Furman v VMI game this weekend and it was really good. It travelled well and pleased everybody. One guest suggested having more buffalo sauce for dipping in addition to the blue cheese dressing. We also tried with some gorgonzola crumbles in the chicken/cheese mix and it was awesome. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this with store bought rotisserie chicken.   Doubled the sauce to properly coat the chicken and added a couple ribs chopped sauteed celery.  I did notice the saltiness that other reviewers spoke of, but will be making it again cause the hubby asked me to soon!  Wonderful dipped in blue cheese dressing!

Good recipe, but this is a stromboli. A calzone has ricotta cheese in it. I used thighs because wings are dark meat and I wanted to stay true to the "Buffalo" flavor. Everyone loved this stromboli and I will make it again.

I didn't like this. It may have been the wing sauce I used. Was kind of bland to me. I think it needs spices of some kind.

This is so delicious.  Just like our favorite pizzeria makes.  We were thrilled with how this turned out.  And so easy.  I used the breast meat from a roasted chicken I'd made and Pillsbury Thin Crust pizza dough. I cut back a little on the amount of the meat and cheese so that all would fit on my pizza pan.  Also kicked up the buffalo sauce a bit for our taste. With a side salad, it made a wonderful weeknight dinner.

This was much easier to make then I expected. Turned out great. Next time I make it I will add more buffalo wing sauce to give it some more heat.

Delicious just as written.  I liked the idea of rolling out on cornmeal, a lot of good pizzerias do, but I can't understand why one reviewer added mashed potatoes to it!  And I'm Irish!

These came out really good. We used a roll of personal pan pizza dough (8 circles of dough, made 4 calzones) and some Guy Fieri buffalo sauce. My only complaint was that the sauce had no kick to it, so we'll be using a different sauce next time. Definitely a keeper. Quick and easy

It completely elevated the flavor to use fresh blue cheese. It’s better in a wheel not crumbled. 5/5!

My boys both loved this but I found it SUPER salty. I will certainly look for a lower sodium wing sauce before I make this again. I think I will also omit the butter because I found it really greasy.... but I have already had requests to make this again so I would say it's a hit.

Turned out great! We liked the calzones with the thinner rolled pizza dough. They had more flavor than the thicker calzone. Added butter to the top once it came out. Family loved it!

These were amazing, but I changed up the recipe a bit.  I took 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts and put them in a large pot on the stove.  I added  cups of water and 4 chicken bouillion cubes and sauteed them on low for about 2 hrs.  After the two hours I drained the liquid and hand pulled the chicken apart.  The chicken is tender enough to do this easily, but if you would prefer chunks you could still do that as well.  I used store bought frozen dough to save myself a bit of time as well.  I brushed the outside of the calzones with olive oil and they were absolutely wonderful!  Definately a meal I will be making again soon!

This is delicious! I made a few changes based on other reviews... First, I baked and seasoned my chicken breast in the oven. I also used a little bit of blue cheese dressing in the mix. Lastly, I brushed with olive oil instead of vegetable oil. My calzones weren't pretty, but that's obviously my fault. This is a great dish for an appetizer!

Kids loved the first time I made it with full amount of buffalo sauce and blue cheese. I made it a second time and used a little less buffalo sauce and blue cheese instead of ranch and my husband and I found it more enjoyable. Perfect for Sunday football meals!

Finally made this after printing the recipe months ago. Was really good! Only thing I added was a sprinkle of garlic powder and onion powder while heating the chicken. I used the left over breasts from a fried supermarket chicken instead of boiling. And we are not Blue Cheese fans so we used Ranch dressing instead. Thanks to the OP for posting this quick and easy meal!

This is a very simple recipe with big flavor. My kids and I love making these. I use the "perfect every time pizza and calzone crust" recipe on this site. The calzone always turns out crunchy and oozing with flavor.  I add sauteed onions because i love onions. Delicious! Thanks for sharing!!

This was a hit with my family. We cut the dough into four pieces and made individual calzones. We tried sprinkling cornmeal on the parchment paper before cooking and it was okay. I don't think it added a lot. Also sprinkled Parmesan cheese on the top before baking which also did add a lot either.  Next time, I'll probably still make individual portions but will follow the recipe as written otherwise.

The filling was tasty, but the crust was too bready. It didn't have the nice texture of a traditional calzone. Maybe it's the refrigerated crust. Plus, the cooking time was off. Left ours in for 17 minutes, and it was burned.

I've made this a couple of times and it has been a huge hit!  My husband now asks when I will fix this again as this is now one of his favorites.  Transferring the calzone is a little tricky--so take it nice and slow.  Enjoy!

Really good and super easy. This has made it into our Friday night fun food rotation. Made exactly as written; dipped in homemade blue cheese dressing.

I guess I would just prefer a pizza or something. The taste was good. I used 1/2 breast and 1/2 thighs and more than doubled the amount of buffalo sauce. I think adding some sliced/chopped green onions would be cool. Not a bad recipe. Be careful not to overcook it and when you pick it up to put it in the pan, it may be fragile because the filling is warm. Not the best buffalo chicken type recipe ever, but certainly not the worst either.
