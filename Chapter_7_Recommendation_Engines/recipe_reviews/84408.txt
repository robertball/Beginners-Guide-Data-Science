This potato salad is awesome!  At first glance it doesn't seem like the combination of ingredients would work, but they actually work beautifully.  The bok choy and peppers add crunch, and the soy sauce adds just the right amount of saltiness.  I used maple cured bacon which is a little less salty then regular smoked bacon, and it turned out great!  I'm a cilantro lover, so I added cilantro according to the recipe however I think that those who don't care for the strong flavor of cilantro could easily substitute parsley and not miss a beat.  This is a great recipe and I will be making it again and again.  Yum!

HI, I am the submitter of this recipe and just want to clarify the amount of potatoe to be used.  If the potatoes are quite large than 6 should be enough, of course if they are smaller than use 6-10. Use your judgement. Thank you for all your comments.

I can't stop eating this stuff! I omitted the cilantro - mine has been in the fridge for a week, and was looking pretty sorry - and I'm actually glad I did. The flavors work SO well. I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks so much!

I can't believe I forgot to rate this recipe! So first, let me state I am sad that I forgot to buy bok choy because I love bok choy. This recipe melded all the ingredients perfectly. You have the traditional asian ingredients, soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onion which really liven up the traditional old potato salad. The bacon adds a nice crunchy texture, the cilantro adds the cool crispiness, and the sugar mellows out the saltiness nicely. The only thing I did differently was to had less mayo. Absolutely try this recipe, you will not regret it!

We weren't sure what to do with the bok choi in our CSA box but we were determined to find a better option than letting it go bad in the fridge as in past years. This recipe made great use of the choi as well as the green onions, and cilantro also in the box, and my girls LOVE potato salad so this seemed like a good recipe to try.   The only change that I made was to skip the dry hot mustard because I don't have any. Nevertheless, it was a big hit with the whole family. The Asian flavors are really clear and it is such a fun and different approach to potato salad than the norm. I just made a double batch again today to bring to a neighborhood potluck  and hope that it is widely enjoyed. I know we'll be making it again as a family in any case. Yum!

Really unique flavor, and just what I was looking for.  I'd also never worked with bok choy before, so I really enjoyed this recipe, not only for its lovely flavors, but for introducing a new ingredient in to my repertoire.

Awesome job with them taters there!  And I'm a life-long non-potato eater, but when I saw this one, something in my brain made a 'ding' noise and I had to try it.  I love all the ingredients, but my cilantro was in an even sorrier state (2 weeks in fridge) and was only able to use a scant amount of what was salvagable.  My bacon was on it's way out too, so I doubled up on the bok choy and onions and omitted the salt since the soy sauce was included.  Nice and spicy and definitely something I'll make for company or wherever I'm invited that says 'bring dish'.  It'll be brought!!

This turned out much better than expected. Delicious with Asian Tuna Patties and some pineapple chutney. It was even better the next day.

This is so good. Looking at the recipe it seems like an odd combination of ingredients. If you can get past that, give it a try. You will be glad you did. Yummmm!

This intimidated me at first because it seemed like such a bizarre combination, but it was delicious! The only substitution I made was I used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of red because that was what I had on hand. I made the rest exactly as written and found it to be a truly unique flavor. Nice job, thank you for sharing!

Added a little more bacon (Nom Nom Nom!), Didn't have any sesame oil, so I just used Soy Vay Marinade instead. It looked frightening. Everyone was scared of it, until they tasted it. It was yummy! I..of course...told everyone it was my recipe, and that I was feeling very creative. Great...inventive...Idea. Will do it again!

Very tasty and a fun change from regular potato salad. I didn't include the bacon and added celery. I like regular potato salad and will make that more often but this is a nice option when I need a change.

Yummers! This was great! My husband really really loved it. He was skeptical when I first told him what we were having. I loved the crunch that the bok choy brought. I did use a green bell pepper instead of red since that is what I had on hand. Also I used about 9 red potatoes because it looked really juicy after just 6. This is a great twist on a classic dish.I'll be making this again. Thanks!

WOW!! I made this for my Father's Day crowd because we had a Korean feast and I wanted to try a different side dish. Besides all the kimchee. This was perfect. A different twist. I made the recipe as stated but I couldn't NOT find DRY HOT MUSTARD. So I used regualr mustard powder. Next time I will use more bacon and more veggies or less mayo.

this was a perfect item to bring to a barbecue.  I was asked to bring a side dish - and this barbecue was being held by a wonderful caterer so I wanted to impress! and this did!  They ate it all up.  I would lesson the amount of mayo though - was a little too much.

My hubby is not a big fan of cold potato salad,he'll eat it, but no matter how much i change it up, he never raves(& he often raves about my cooking!) Well BOY DID HE LOVE THIS (as did my young kids) I've often used this flavor profile, but never thought to try it w/potato salad. I was cooking up southern pork ribs (using spicy chinese barbecue riblets recipe on here) & ribs & tater salad go well, but i wanted to carry through the asian theme,can't believe i found a recipe that worked! Try it, if you like asian inspired dishes, & potatoes, you'll LOVE this..I served it w/alysons brocc salad...Even though it's very unique, my hubby proclaimed that this is the dish he wants me showing off (even at his fam's Thanksgiving,lol...unorthodox, but he liked it THAT much!)

Good overall taste, but as written it is too soopy for my taste and the onion/red pepper are way too much for 6 new red potatoes. Next time I'll add more potatoes (probably 6 more) and try that.

Really wanted to love this, but just didn't-neither did my cookout friends. It was just enough different to be different, but not fabulous!  Made as written-maybe just personal taste issue.

I wanted potato salad with my ribs and this is a great Asian meal with a southern roots.  Thanks!

What a great twist to potato salad! I left out the bacon and used a small squirt of regular yellow mustard instead of the dry mustard and it turned out great.

We love this recipe. It is easy to make and isn't swimming in dressing like so many potato salads that are store bought.  I had black Sesame seeds that I needed to use up,they were a wonderful added to this recipe. Since then, I have used regular Sesame seeds in it but we like the black ones best. It is a new favorite at our house. :)

This was ok. I wanted something with an asian flare, so I decided to try this. I followed the recipe exactly. I felt the sesame oil was a little too overpowering. It's all I really tasted. Next time, I think I will reduce the sesame oil and just put some sesame seeds in the salad. It needed something else, I just can't figure out what. I will need to play with it. Overall, it was an ok recipe. It could be better with some tweaks.

I wanted to make this to have with my Asian inspired barbeque and it was a good choice.  I was surprised how creamy it was with no eggs.

Very interesting for a change of pace.  I love the surprise of adding extra veggies into basic potato salads and the asian twist on the dressing appealed to me.  While tasty this just didn't quite come together in a way that said fusion.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and I couldn't believe how good it was! I normally don't like potato salad very much, but this was way better than any other kind I've had.

I've been trying to find a recipe that I can incorporate potato salads with an Asian flare and this dish does not disappoint. Even my "non-loving mayo" kid liked this dish. I will be making this again. Thank you!

Great but I replaced the secondary ingredients with carrots and celery.

This was so delicious! I pretty much followed the recipe and it came out wonderful... It paired so well with pork chops marinated in soy sauce and garlic. Will definitely make this again!

I made this earlier today for dinner tonight.  I went exactly by the recipe, and like another reviewer I am not a big fan
Of potatoes, but my husband is, so I went out on a limb...It was really different, and really delicious!

My new favorite potato salad, however, I do add more Soy sauce and sesame oil.  Didn't have dry hot mustard, but powdered wasabi worked out great.
