Mmmmmmm. The name of this recipe grabbed me. We tried it, and it was a great twist on a classic.

Different but very good.  Better the next day.  I can only give this a four because frankly, I have better chicken soup recipes that I'd rather make.  But this was light and refreshing.

YUMMM....This recipe turned out very well! I didn't like that the soup was very light in color so I added a few drops of yellow food coloring to liven it up.I would definatly make again.
