This dip is very good and so very simple! It is a nice base for other additions as well. I chose to bake half the recipe to see how it would turn out, so it took 20 minutes at 350 degrees. The flavors blended nicely and the texture was great. It does set up quickly, so this would be nice in a crock pot to keep it warm. It is delicious chilled also. I served this with toasted onion bagels cut into bite size pieces. Ths would be a great appetizer for  breakfast or brunch also. Next time I may add some diced red pepper. Thanks for sharing I will use this again :)

This stuff is awesome. My  husband's family makes this. Here is a good tip..... we ADD garlic salt instead of onions with the cream chease and old english cheese. Delicious. Also, I have used reduced fat cream cheese and it doesn't change the yummy factor :).

Love this dip! Served with bagel chips, but also loved it with plain crackers. I was surprised how long it has stayed fresh in my fridge. Kept it for a few weeks. Agree with other reviewers, best to sit out a bit before serving. Will make again!

It's good.  Used 1 block of cream cheese and one jar of old english with a whole bunch of green onion.  Tasted great.

This was a definite hit at our latest potluck. I did soften the cheeses in the microwave for about a minute and they blended perfectly, and I only used 1/4 cup of chopped green onions. One suggestion: if serving to a crown, it needs to be set out for quite a while to soften up. It was a little hard to spoon out after being in the refrigerator for so long. I will absolutely make it again.

Simple.  Tasty.  I like it even better left out at room temperature for a while as it softens quite a bit.

Pretty good but a little bland.  Used chopped jalapenos instead of the onions and rolled in slivered almonds.  So much you can do with this recipe...

Wow, this is really good! I was a little surprised it was so good, since it only has the three ingredients. But the green onions actually give it quite a bit of flavor, especially sitting overnight. I served it with bagel chips. Thanks for sharing!

made as is at first. i used sweet onion instead of green since i didnt have any. i used this as an appetizer for a big sunday dinner i made today. after i tasted it i fried 4 trips of bacon and crumbled it in and added salt pepper and garlic. its not a very pretty dip and i added some chopped red pepper to add some color. its a good base recipe. i used town house crackers to dip it with.

So good, and easy to make! Also, with only 3 ingredients, it's an inexpensive dish to bring and share.

Made this for Euchre Club and they all loved it. The guys made cheese sandwich bagels with it.  I used 1 bunch of green onions just as the recipe called for, but I did also add 1 tablespoon of fresh horseradish (almost squeezed dry). It really was delicious!

Made as instructed but honestly it’s not very flavorful   I added red pepper flakes to help but it wasn’t much help. It was of course easy to make and I suppose a basic dish for someone looking for something easy

Easy and Delicious! Use onions to taste, though.

I used Old English processed cheese and it was easy to make and delicious!  Also a big hit with my guests.  I  served with pretzel bread from the bakery cut into small slices and this was a great combo.  This makes a lot and could easily be cut in half for small gatherings.

This is super simple and it was such a hit....I also like that it will stay good in the fridge for a while.
