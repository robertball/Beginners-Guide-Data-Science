This was a very easy and quick recipe. The orange flavor didn't come out as much as I had hoped. Probably would have if the orange juice or zest was mixed into the dough plus added in the topping. But that's the trade off when you use a prepared breadstick instead of making your own. Still, the fact that it was low fuss makes it one I will use again.

These were really good, the flavor wasn't as intense as I thought it would be but still very good, we all enjoyed these.

These were really tasty! I tried to make them with Grand biscuits, that I rolled up, didn't work. But they are still good with coffee. The other reviewer that said there was little orange taste, was not true in my case. I had a tangerine,zested and squeezed, nice orange flavor!  I will try these again, Thanks JJohn!

I'm not thrilled with these. The orange flavor just didn't carry through, at all, and at the cooking time suggested they came out overly done. They were certainly edible, but I won't be making these again.

These were quite good, though I would recommend mixing some orange eel into the breadstick dough.
