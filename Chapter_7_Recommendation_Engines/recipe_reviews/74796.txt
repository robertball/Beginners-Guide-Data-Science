You cannot go wrong with a beer butt chicken.  I make this about once every 2 weeks and my family never grows tired of it. I usually use about 2-3 limes and stuff one of them (or an onion) in the top to keep the steam in the chicken.  I also season the beer (you can use sprite or 7-up as well) with some lime juice, garlic salt, and chopped onions. I have never covered the chicken with foil or basted it and it always comes out nice and golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside. I have also made gravy out of the drippings and it was amazingly good.

I decided to make this meal and then as I started to prepapre to cook I thought I realised I did not know what I should do with the chicken or beer can.  After looking at the reviews and no one else raised this question I thought I was left out of a very special cooks secret. So for all those in the dark as I was you place the can in your required baking dish/tin, opened ease the chickens bottom (sounded better than my first choice) over the opened can, resulting in the chicken facing the skies whilst resting on a can of beer. I am going to give this one tops marks although my chicken really had very little citrus flavour the meat was so very moist that with adjustments in flavouring not only the inside of the chicken but also under and on the skin this could be great. Good luck

We've made a number of beer-can chickens, so I spiced this one up a bit. It turned out great and was probably the best one we've ever done.

I made a basic barbecue rub (paprika, salt, pepper, brown sugar, onion and garlic, etc.) and added a bit of chile powder and cumin to the rub as I thought the Mexican spices would go well with the lime juice.

I loosened the chicken skin (just dig your fingers in), put the rub under the skin and on the skin, and poured the lime juice under the skin and into the cavity. I stuffed the lime skins in the cavity as directed. I let it sit in the refrigerator for an hour to let it soak up the rub.

I opened a can of Really Cheap Beer, poured some out, added some of the rub to it, and lowered the chicken onto it. (We have one of those handy beer can holders from Bed, Bath and Beyond or Linens and Things. They really make the whole process a lot easier.) 

Instead of putting it in the oven, I put it on our gas grill, set for indirect cooking, and cooked it until it reached 180 degrees--about 2 hours. The skin looked really dry, but the inside was very moist and tender. Delicious!

Many of the previous reviews for this recipe indicate that there is not much flavor. I have been doing Beer can Chicken for a number of years. I use Montreal Steak seasoning. Mix 3 Tbsp. Montreal Steak seasoning and 1 Tbsp. Brown Sugar. Rub the outside of the chicken with butter (I have also sprayed it with cooking spray) Then use about a third of the seasoning mix and rub it all around the INTERIOR of the chicken. Rub the remaining seasoning over the outside of the chicken."Sit" the chicken down over the half can of beer. On the grill, heat the grill, then turn one side off.Set at medium heat. Place the chicken "sitting up" on the side that is off (you can use the legs to form a sort of tripod to keep it up) Close the cover and leave it to cook for 1 1/2 hours. It may need a bit more time. But no more than 2 hours!
Remove the sitting chicken from the heat, let it sit 10 minutes then remove it from the can and cut up. This is THE BEST chicken we've ever had!! It is ALWAYS moist and very flavorful! I have made it in the oven as well. You can use soda in the can, but the taste is a little different than with beer. I heard someone say that it is the hops in the beer that infuse the chicken with some of the flavor.

VERY GOOD!  I, like most, made a couple of modifications to the original recipe.  I squeezed a couple of teaspoons of lime juice into the beer and dropped two cloves of garlic in the can as well.  I rubbed the inside and outside of the skin with salt, pepper and garlic powder and a little Tony's (cajun seasoning).  I did not cover with foil because I LOVE crispy skin! It was moist, tender and delicious. I also made an awesome gravy with the drippings; great with mashed potatoes. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Any recipe that starts with me drinking 1/2 a beer is OK in my book. We already had a beer chicken holder so we used that ($2 at the grocery store). The chicken was incredibly moist and flavorful. Great recipe. Thanks.

This chicken came out fantastic, amazingly tender, meat fell right off the bone. Only modifications I made were: using 2 limes, one halved as directed, other cut into wedges, and placed under skin along with several pats of butter. For seasoning I used Adobo as well as some garlic sea salt. This combination came out incredible, and I will definitely be making this again.

I made this a few weeks ago for a Sunday dinner.  It was a big hit.  I used lime pepper to season the chicken instead of regular pepper.  I did have to cook it a little longer but the result was a fantastic juicy chicken that the whole family loved.  Thanks LaQuinna for the great recipe.

Like some of the other reviewers I too added and changed the spices to my familys taste. Also did two chickens at the same time, useing the 20 min a pound rule. Not total weight of two chickens but the weight of the heavest bird. I also always use a meat thermometer. Don't skimp on the price get a good one. I'm not into the "high teck" kind just a really good themomerer. The best advise my grandmother ever gave me was to buy good equipment for the kitchen. Save up if you have to baby, but get the good stuff it's your family were talking about. Mine came out fall off the bone tender and juicy. I used extra stout dark beer from a bottle, washed out two soda cans and split the beer between the two followed the recipe adding a little more spice and lime juice and some garlic cloves to the beer. Thank you LAQUINNA for the oven recipe as I'm not much of a grillen gall.*** up date on this review still as wonderful as ever now if i don't have caned beer I use a tall mason or jelly glass jar and just pour the beer in there.

OPEN THE BEER CAN (haha just in case you didnt know) I personally LOVE this recipe, though I used 2 1/2 LEMONS instead of limes and a can of light beer. I prepped the chicken using pepper as suggested and less salt than suggested. I also put on lemon pepper and a little bit of garlic salt. For my 5lb chicken, the cook time was about 2hours. I think this is because the beer was refrigerated along with the chicken. The foil was only covering the chicken, not the entire pan BTW. I do suggest if you want crispy chicken skin (i had someone who wanted it) to uncover the chicken once its near the optimal temperature and turn up the temp approximately to 400 for the last few minutes, maybe higher depending on your altitude. (high desert here). i cooked it for 4 people and it was AMAZING!! i think the lemon accented the flavor a bit more than the limes.. not to mention i slit the lemon halves a few times for a little extra flavor.

Great and easy recipe! I didn't have a lime, so just squirted some lemon juice in the appropriate areas...and added a clove or two of garlic to the can. I will be using this again and again!

I have tried this two ways and I find it better on the grill.  I stuff the beer can with garlic and rosemary and then stuff either an onion or lemon in the neck of the chicken.  I also wet down some wood chips and place those on top of the coals. Put one piece of foil under the chicken so not to burn the little wings.  Spray the outside with either butter or oil about half way through grilling it.  Takes about an hour for a 4 to 5lb chicken and once the internal temp. is about 165 to 170, take beer can out of it, lay it down in a pan, cover it with foil for about 15 Min and then cut away.  Always juicy and taste great!  Hint...don't leave the vents open on the charcoal grill...just let it smoke up...too much air will kill the coals and

The flavor on this is good, I added lots of extra garlic and onion and did a basic chili spice rub on the outside...But as far as ease goes forget it! I don't know what I'm doing wrong but I couldn't manage to get one beer can to support the weight of a whole chicken...it ended up falling over in the oven about 2 minutes after I put it in, perfectly salvageable because it's now roasting on its back swimming in half a can's worth of beer lol. Only after I tried this recipe did I find out online that they actually make cheap little rack beer/chicken can holders to make these things stand up in the oven...will try again once I've purchased one of those but don't recommend trying without it!

Great fresh citrus tasting chicken.  I did enhance the seasonings quite a bit because we like robust intense flavors in our food. I added cumin powder, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder and blackened seasoning and made a dry rub and rubbed on the outside and inside cavity of the chicken.  I also added some in between the chicken skin and the meat.  I  cut the lime in eights and put some limes in between the skin and also added some sliced onions and chili peppers.  We used a dark ale and grilled the chicken on indirect heat (thanks to another reviewer for this tip).  The chicken was full of flavor and very good. YUM!

This is one of my favorite recipes to make during the summer. My oldest gets a real kick out of helping his Dad BBQ a chicken on top of a beer can. I throw on some foil covered onions (with butter and a beef bouillion cube) to serve with it. It's like eatin' all high class, only you aren't. TIP: I add rosemary and garlic to the beer can before adding the chicken. Makes it even better.

This a family favorite..I usually use a can of gingerale instead of beer which complments the lime flavor incredibly and I always make 2 chickens so we have leftovers over the next few days. I also love to use a yummy Montreal Steak spice rub on the chicken after I squeeze the lime juice on. We like the skin to be extra savory and a little crispy. The drippings from the chicken with the lime juice, the spice rub, and steamed gingerale makes the most amazing flavorful gravy that goes great with garlic mashed potatoes. I just add a little flour to the drippings about a 1/4 c. (if there's not quite enough drippings I just add a little oil so there's something for the flour to absorb) and then add about 1/2 a liter of chicken stock...mmmm yummy!! The best chicken dinner ever!!!

Easy to do.  I had 2 chickens to cook.  I used  soda cans & put water & seasonings in them.  How come no one said how silly these naked chickens look sitting up in the pan?  lol  A great recipe if you need a good laugh.

used Corona for the beer as it was all I had on hand; I loved the image of the bird with a can shoved up its rear end, was wicked funny. Suprisingly moist, good flavors, didn't really brown much though...must work on that. The limes in the body cavity really add a bit of a kick to the chicken flavor!

I've done many beer can chickens on the Weber but never thought about doing it in the oven!  Upped the oven temp to 400 and used a Penzey's spice mix - Turkish - it was absolutely delicious.

Fantastic!!! We usualy do (Beer In The Rear) chicken on the barbee. Never tried it with lime. We drink 1/2 of the beer then add our spices to the can, rub the chicken with more spices. Then put the bird on the can. Then stuff a piece of onion in the neck hole to keep the steam in the bird. cook for 2 hrs. or till temp is 190 deg.

I made this on the grill and it turned out very well. I cooked it on low for about 2 1/2 hours. Didn't baste it at all, the skin was crispy and flavorful. The meat didn't have a whole lot of lime flavor to it, but it was -very- moist. I poured lime juice and garlic powder into the beer can... also rubbed the entire chicken down with lime juice, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. I had small Mexican limes, so I managed to fit 2 in the cavity, halved. I also stuck one in the top to keep the steam inside. Thanks!

I really like this recipe and today is the second time I'm making it. Even my picky British buddy loves it. I have changed it a little...I use 4 limes squeezed over the top and stuff the cavity with the equivalent of one lime and the neck with 1/2 of a lime and some onion. in the beer I put 2 cloves fresh garlic, a little bit of fresh parsley and some fresh onion. I also put some onion down in the pan with the residual lime juice. I discard the remains of the other 2 1/2 limes. Salt and pepper to taste of course and for the beer I use "Coors"...has good flavor plus the movie "Smokey and the Bandit" rocks LOL! Have fun and make it your own!

this was good. I would like a little more lime infused flavor but Im not sure how...I used a bunch of limes. May try and add a little lime concentrate next time also. Easy..I also used fresh cilantro. Thanks.

Why did they use the beer? It might have been if I could have that figured out for me - it is bland as is it.

This chicken is AMAZING !!! I actually took the spice/herb blend from the simple whole roasted chicken recipe on allrecipes and then used the lime, beer and water from this recipe.  SO juicy and tasty...definitely the BEST roast chicken. The lime really makes the difference !!

This chicken was good, but not terribly flavorful. I rubbed the chicken inside and out with a paste of crushed garlic, fresh lime juice, salt and pepper. It had to cook much longer than and hour and a half - in fact, closer to 3 and a half hours. BUT - I will probably make it again because it was fairly easy and tasted just as good as a rotisserie chicken bought from the supermarket.

This is a very simple, very flavorful recipe. The uncomplicated list of ingredients really allows the flavor of the chicken to be the focal point of the dish. The only change I occasionally make to the original recipe is the addition of 2-3 cloves of garlic to the beer before cooking. This allows a hint of garlic flavor to steam up through the meat during the roasting process.

First off, I am learning to be a better cook. I have followed allrecipes before and they have been excellent until this... The temperatures weren't accurate, flavors bland. Unfortunately I am unable to improvise enough to compensate for the lack of instruction.

just made this chicken for the first time. we used an apricot beer, which gave a really nice flavor to the chicken. i also added some garlic, lime juice and maple syrup to the beer, and stuff the chicken with 2 limes. it took longer to cook, maybe 2 hours, but our chicken was pretty big. delicious.

Actually, I was a bit disappointed.  I love lime...I mean, LOVE lime.  The chicken wasn't all that lime-y and was quite bland.  I followed the recipes exactly, but think that this could use more spice.  The beer did make the chicken very moist and tender though.

This recipe was delicious!!I made a herb butter with chopped garlic and some cajun seasoning and spooned it under the skin over the breast. Also used chicken broth instead of water.Turned out moist and delicious.

Wow...I made this three days ago and we are still talking about how good it was!  Based on others' suggestions, I decided to insert lime slices between the skin and the meat of the chicken to give it a stronger flavor.  I cooked my 6 lb. bird on the BBQ (over a disposible cooking sheet) on medium heat for about 3 hours.  Fall-off-the bone delish!

4 stars because the chicken is very moist. I didn't get a very strong lime flavor- however, I didn't have any limes. I used lime concentrate and put a lime-soaked onion slice in the cavity. I will try this again, but with lime slices. Also, it didn't get as brown as I like.

This was my first time making beer can chicken and I am officially addicted! The meat was so moist and tender, absolutely delicious. However, this recipe needs a lot more flavor to get the full 5 stars. The chicken should be well seasoned inside and out with lime juice (use the zest too!), salt & pepper. I added garlic and two extra limes and it was great.

IT WAS SOOOOOOO GOOD! I followed the recipe to a T except I cooked it differently. I cooked it on 400 for 30 minutes and then turned it down to 300 for 2.5 hours. I don't think it would have been done in the time the recipe said. It was sooo good. Smelled so awesome while it was baking. Thanks

It was moist to almost the point of being chewy in parts (i baked it for 2 hours because my mom claimed it wasn't done) if I was to do it again I wouldn't cover it with foil at all was it wasn't so white, and I'd rub it with garlic powder. I put the juice of two limes in the beer can.

I love the taste of this chicken.  I used the lime zest of a whole lime, chopped, along with the juice for a stronger lime flavor. I made this into skewers using chicken breast strips and grilled for a party. I also used a whole can of beer since I marinated the strips in a zip lock bag in the frig for about 1 hour. BE CAREFUL that if you do this, you do not over cook them.  I did this to the first batch. Good Luck!!!

This chicken turned out great and it was easy to make. I took Jenny B.'s advice and squeezed the lime under the skin and also seasoned with paprika, cumin, garlic, and onion. I took the foil off a little earlier than stated so the skin would brown more. It turned out very moist and tasty with plenty of flavor. This will go into my recipe box.

I took the foil off after 30 mins because I wanted the skin to be brown and crispy. I was surprised that it wasn't very lime-y, especially as I had sat the chicken breast down in lime juice all day. I should have followed Jenny G's advice and poured some of the juice under the skin. Despite this, the chicken was extremely moist and tender. I will try this again. Thanks, LaQuinna!

This was so moist and yummy.  It took a little longer than 90 minutes to cook and I had to add water to the pan, but it was worth the wait.  I also made gravy from the drippings.  It had a very intense lime smell (not taste), and the end result was a deep brown, intensely flavored gravy which was delicious with the chicken.  My kids DID NOT like the gravy, though.  This time I made biscuits but next time I will make potatoes for the gravy.  Everyone loved it and it had a mild lime taste.  Tnanks for sharing.

Fabulous!  Husband and children loved it.  The only change I made was adding more lime juice before roasting.

I had heard about a recipe similar to this one from the girls at work. No one in my family quite knew what to expect. It was YUMMY! The chicken was very tender! I made some ammendments.. I did not have a lime, but I had lime juice. After I dumped 1/2 the beer in the can, I put about 2 1/2 tbsp of lime juice into the beer can. Also, I had some (about 1/2 c.)lime and herb marinade, so I poured that over the chicken instead of using the juice.

The chicken was very tender, however, in places bitter due to the lime being inserted under the chicken skin.  I would recommend eliminating that step.

I have been making "buzzed bird" for years, but this is the best. I didn't have limes, so I used lemons. My son suggested next time (you bet there will be!) to use both. Since I used lemons, I seasoned with lemon pepper.  I guess that makes it Beer Roasted Lemon Chicken huh.  At any rate, this is chicken!

Tender and juicy with crispy skin. I didn't have a lime so I used an orange. Also plugged the top with a slice of orange. I was actually able to carve the bird right off the can. Very moist! I will be making this often and trying others suggested variations. This technique is definatly the way to cook a whole chicken.

I give this recipe 3 stars only because it wasn't outstanding. The chicken was very moist, but a whole baked chicken  always comes out moist.  No one could detect any lime flavoring.  It was simply good, moist chicken...period.

AMAZING!!! No matter what seasonings you use, the beer and lime are awsome complements to it.  No need to carve the bird, the chicken literally falls apart. This is a family favorite, even to those who don't like lime.

Just made this, also with a few adjustments. I rubbed the chicken with extra spices on top and under the skin, I added lime slices under the skin too and it was citrus-y enough for me. Squeezed some lime juice and threw a couple garlic cloves in the beer can. Can someone explain to me what the beer does? I didn't detect any beer flavour. I also didn't cover it at all and it came out nice and crispy. Based on all the reviews I put it in for longer, 2 hours, which turned out to be a little too long as it was a bit dry. Special thanks to the girl who expalined what to do with the beer can in an earlier review - I didn't know either!

The chicken came out nice and moist but didn't retain a lot of flavor.  Definitely needs a spice rub or perhaps a brining.

The chicken fell apart around the can when it was done, melt in your mouth tender and wonderfully juicy with a hint of lime.  The drippings are as good as the chicken and make a wonderful gravy.  Awesome recipe, and so easy!  Goes great with the rest of the beer.....

This was the first time I had ever roasted a whole chicken and it turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception.  I stuff the chicken with about a 1/2 bunch of cilantro, for more of that Mexican flavor.  Will make again, thanks for posting

I make a recipe quite like this one frequently. Since I am more of a wine lover than beer, I use white wine and fresh herbs instead of beer. I purchased a stand from my barbecue store that is designed for this recipe. I use an empty soup can, fill it two thirds with a cheap white wine and put fresh herbs such as rosemary or lavender in it and roast it on the barbecue (burners on to 350 deg. on one side and the other, where the chicken is, turned off). Roast the chicken for 30 minutes per pound and the skin is crisp on the outside and the meat wonderfully flavourful.

This turned out great.  I let it marinade about 2 days, because plans changed the first day.  But I would highly recommend at least 1 days.  After I removed the foil, the chicken wouldn't stand up on the can any longer.  But it still ended up really good.  My wife hates beer, and she loved the chicken, so don't let that deter you!

I liked this recipe, but am only giving it three stars because had to add seasoning. Going on other reviews that stated it's blandness, I decided to add a rub of 1 T. chili powder, 1 t. cumin, 1/2 t. of turmric...made into thick paste with lime juice and a wee bit of olive oil....rubbed on chicken about 6 hours before baking. Used Bud with lime, thought that might boost up the lime flavor, sadly can't say it did, and gave the bird a good hosing with lime juice and put the halves in the cavity. The flavors from the rub were great, but even with the Bud Lime beer, I couldn't taste the lime. The breast meat was so tender and juicy...yum. Next time I am going to do it the same, except maybe try adding some lime zest to the rub...see if that helps infusing the lime flavor.

Was good. I will make again. The flavoring was a bit dull, and the chicken was moist but needed some extra gravy or spicing. In all very good. The Lime and Beer combination is a winner.

This was ok, a little bland.  I don't think the lime really added anything  extra to the chicken.

I make this all the time; sometimes on the grill and sometimes in the oven; with all different types of beer.  It's great and my husband loves it.  Add a simple Caesar salad and you've got a meal!!!

This was disappointing.  I think I am at fault, though.  I didn't have any beer in cans, so I used beer in a bottle.  It's smelled amazing while it was cooking then tasted like plain old chicken with no seasoning on it.  I may try this again using a can of beer.  I think it will end up with more flavor.

This was less time consuming than my regular 'Beer Can Chicken' but not as flavorful, might try my regular recipe and add the lime to give a favorite a bit of a twist.  Thank you for sharing.
