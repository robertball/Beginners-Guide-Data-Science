This is great and easy. I recommend not adding the tomato sauce - makes it too soupy. Adding some corn works well.

This is delicious and very easy to make. It even transfers well as a recipe for non-fish dishes such as pasta or tofu dishes.

I fixed this for friends and they thought that it was one of the best things that they have ever eaten.  Very simple to make and a vegetarian delight.  Can be made as spicy as you like, or as mild as you could want.  I plan on fixing this again soon.

Awesome recipe-low fat and high in flavor.  Be careful about using salsa that is too spicy-you won't be able to enjoy the flavors to their fullest.
