This was very good - it had a tasty, crunchy, crusty exterior and moist interior.  The directions didn't specify whether the beating should be done by mixer or hand, so I beat by hand which probably accounted for the homey, coarse texture (which I prefer).  I think this cake could be improved by a combination of spices as an earlier reviewer had suggested,and I did cook it an additional 10 minutes - it looked a little jiggley although the knife came out clean.  I had half a block of leftover cream cheese in the fridge, so I beat that with the pineapple juice and then added the 10X sugar.  I spooned that over the cake and topped with additional walnuts. I took the cake to work for a bake sale, and had several comments on the beautiful appearance of the cake and 2 requests for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again, as I love Bundt cakes for their ease of frosting.

OMG! This is the best carrot cake ever!  I used pineapple tidbits, out of crushed.  I left during the baking of this cake, and did not inform my daughter of the previous reviews that said it may take longer.  Anyway, she took it out when it beeped.  It was nearly raw! LMAO!  I put it back in when I got home and it continued to cook beautifully!  Thumbs up to the chef!

I made "Mom's Pineapple-Carrot Cate" for an Easter Sunday dinner that I was invited to.  It was moist and delicious--everyone loved it! Only changes I made was adding 1/4 cp. more oil, & also added 1 tsp. ea. nutmeg & allspice & changed 2 1/2tsp. cinnimon to 2 tsp.  Instead of Bundt pan I used 9x13 pan. It's definite a 5-star winner!

I had so many problems with this recipe. I have a Pampered Chef spring form bundt pan, that is 10 inches but too small for this recipe. I had to change the cookie sheet under the cake 3 times during cooking. Once the cake was done though it tasted awesome. My husband and step father really enjoyed it. I will reserve some batter for cupcakes next time I use this recipe. Thank you

Even though I forgot to put in the pineapple..it was still very moist and delicious.  The cake disappeared in a matter of moments. I will make this again.

I made the cake for a dinner party.  It also took me about 40 minutes more to cook it and it did overflow from my bundt pan but it was great!  The others at the party also loved it!  moist in the middle.  easy to make.  will do again definitely!

This cake was moist, flavorful, and yummy!  I bake it for a community dinner and receive many compliments and requests for the recipe.  I added lemon juice and zest to the cream cheese frosting which enhanced the cake even more.

Hands down the best carrot cake I've ever HAD or MADE.  It is requested most often and practically inhaled when it hits the plate.  I don't care if it overflows a bit.  I frequently put the extra into a mini bundt pan or muffin pan.  Thanks Doris!

Made this for my wifes birthday per her request. My Dad said it was the best carrot cake he has ever had. I added extra cinnamon and a little nutmeg for good measure. Is super moist, great texture, and very tasty. I will add more pineapple in the future but otherwise was a sure fire hit with everyone at my house from age 4 to age 55!

This was really good, took it to family get together for Easter and everyone loved it. I left out coconut (was out) and replaced walnuts with pecans (southern thing), one of the best carrot cakes I've made.

I had to bake this for 60 minutes. I would advise cooling it much longer in the pan, as some of it stuck to the sides when I turned it out. Overall it is a 5 star cake. Delicious. Even the pickiest member of my family loved it. Thanks. I will be making this recipie again.

I prepared this cake to take to a sports banquet for my daughter's track team.  It was quite a hit!  It took a bit longer to bake than the recipe called for, though.

it tastes great (apparently; i've never eaten it but have made it for friends), but overflows the bundt pan EVERY TIME.  if i didn't get requests, i wouldn't have made it again.  for some reason i didn't make a note of the overflow after the first time.  i haven't come up with a solution other than to pour some batter into a loaf pan. bottom line: great flavour, but be prepared for the excess.

This cake turned out to be delicious! not too moist with a nice crumb and great flavor because of the pineapple and coconut!  it was my favorite out of the 3 that I tried on this site : the other two being Carrot cake 3 and Sam's famous carrot cake.

I've used this version of the carrot cake for many years now, and this is by far the best recipie I've found for it. The only thing I change in my version are the nuts; I'm allergic to walnuts so I substitute with macadamia, pine nuts are also a great option. Excellent cake, moist and very flavorful all on its own. IMO this cake stands on its own without a need for any frosting. Also, this cake ships extreemly well. I sent 2 doz cupcakes to my hubby overseas and they made it to him and his buddies moist and fresh as the day I baked them. They absolutly LOVED it (even though they had to settle with canned icing, yick) and cant wait for a seccond batch. Quick, simple, excellent cake for any occasion or need.

Everyone loved this recipe, even with my changes listed below:!
I used 1 c. whole wheat flour + 2 c all purpose flour.
Also used 1 c unsweetened apple sauce + 1/2 c oil
Baked in 15x10 pan for 40 minutes.
The texture is not oily at all.

I've made this over and over, it so yummy! The best part for my family is that it's milk/butter free. My little girl is allergic to the whey protein found in dairy products. It's nice to have a cake that she can eat.

Good carrot cake.  It was unbelievably simple to make & very tasty.  I used raisins as a substitute to the walnuts (didn't have any in the pantry).  The men at work thoroughly enjoyed it, as did my peeps at home (husband & toddler).

Great cake. I cut the white sugar down to 2 cups, used 1/3 cup of  the oil with 2/3 cup of applesauce, used only 1 cup of coconut and 8 oz. of crushed pineapple. I also used only 3 eggs.  I used 2 cups of shredded carrots. And I added a tablespoon of Allspice.  I put honey pecans on top of the cake, but no nuts in it since some family members cannot eat nuts.  For the frosting, I mixed 1/2 stick of softened butter, 8 oz. cream cheese together, then added 1 cup of confectioners sugar. Mixed til creamy. Yummy. I will definitely make this cake again. It was great!

I made this cake and it fell apart when I turned it over to dump out of the pan and it was oily. Was very disappointed! Had a good flavor bug will never make it again!

Great recipe! Just changed a couple things- used applesauce instead of oil, only one cup of sugar and no vanilla. Will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe! It's a bit sweet, so maybe less sugar next time and more cinnamon. Made mine into cupcakes! Put cream cheese frosting in the middle :) amazing!!

This makes exactly 24 cupcakes baked for 35 mins.  Very good flavor, texture, and moisture level but next time will cut back on oil to 1 cup as EXTREMELY greasy and cut back on sugar to 2 1/4 cup as it was too sweet to frost. Some changes: Used the large grater (the one to grate cheese), desiccated coconut (not sure whether that is the same as flaked coconut), raw granulated sugar (as we don't buy white sugar) and tidbit pineapple (as I couldn't find crushed pineapple).

This was dense, moist, and delicious, although be careful that you use the proper sized bundt pan or it takes FOREVER to bake.

This was Easter dessert yesterday and loved by all. It's even better today, so moist!!! The only change I might make would be to cut back on the sugar as it was quite sweet.  I made a glaze out of melted cream cheese, confectioners sugar and pineapple juice.

I made this for Easter.  I made cream cheese frosting that was a bit thin so that it would flow down the sides.  Very rich but, good.

I usually don't bake from scratch but wanted a carrot cake for Good Friday.  This was excellent.  It did take longer to bake that called for in the recipe but may have been due to small electric oven at camp.  An Eggcellent Easter Cake.
