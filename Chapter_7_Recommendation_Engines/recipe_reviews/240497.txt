My husband makes turkey bone soup every year. I looked at this recipe to tweak the spices, excellent recipe! I like the addition of barley.

Added mushrooms because I love them with the barley. Would have liked it to be a touch thicker. Hoping that after it sits overnight it will thicken up. Love the touch of brightness from the lemon juice.

So good and great for the leftover turkey bones.  I modified for my Instant Pot.  I made the stock--40 minutes under high pressure.  Stained the stock.  I put the rest of ingredients in the IP and cooked under high pressure for, barley and all + extra carrots and celery, 18 more minutes.

My husband said that this was the best turkey soup that I had ever made.  And, I have made many a pot of turkey soup in our almost 50 years of marriage!  I came very close to following the recipe exactly.  The Herb's

This recipe was great.  My husband who won't usually eat turkey soups loved it.
