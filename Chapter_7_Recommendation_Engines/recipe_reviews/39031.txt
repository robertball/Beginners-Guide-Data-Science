Easy, creamy, cheesy and delicious - a definite must try.  I topped them off with some chopped green onion and extra shredded cheddar cheese.  You can't get enough cheese, right?  The only thing that might take this over the top and would be some crumbled bacon bits.  Next time.....

I loved these. They were really easy and came out fluffy and delicious. MUST TRY. Add other things to add to taste like green onions and maybe some red peppers

very very tasty.  made it as described and it was so yummy. very easy to make. i used a masher on the potatoes prior to using a mixer as i felt the potatoes would mix easier if they were broken down a bit first.  i can see how the suggestion of adding bacon would make it even better.  i think this tasted best when eaten immediately.  the next day leftovers just didn't quite have the same zing.  i will definitely make these again in the future.

YUM. I used Cracker Barrel 2% sharp cheddar. I didn't add all the carnation milk, just added until it was the consistancy I wanted. There was just over a 1/4 c. left. Isn't evaporated milk the best? Is there nothing it CAN'T do?

I really wasn't too impressed with the recipe as written.  It really didn't have a lot of flavor, and I like my mashed potatoes to be packed with flavor.  However, with a few additions, this recipe can be a three or four.  I added more cheese than the recipe called for (approx. 1/4 - 1/2 cup additional) and added garlic powder to taste.

I tasted the mashed potatoes before adding the  cheddar cheese and I thought they were better without the cheese.  Evaporated milk is a good idea for mashed potatoes, I will use that more often.

Great idea for a starter... I did add quiet a bit to this, 1. I added about 4oz. of French Onion dip rather than just plain sourcream to up the flavor, 2. I added a few dashes of dried thyme, parsley, and oregano, and also some garlic salt.  3. Store bought "real bacon" bits worked great.  Everyone enjoyed these and we will probably be heating the leftovers up tomorrow!!!!! Thanks for the great starter recipe!

This recipe is AWESOME.  Made it exactly as instructed.  I tripled the recipe so I would have leftovers, and then pan fried the next day for my own version of Potato Pancakes! YUMMY!

On occassion, there are times when we love cheese in our mashed potatoes - this recipe satisfied our craving! I too added some minced green onion. Went great with our baked chicken (which produced no gravy) but these didn't need any gravy!! Thanks!

Good way to serve mashed potatoes, especially when you don't have gravy.  I added extra cheese and chopped green onions, and the entire family enjoyed it.

This is the best mashed potato side dish and a must have at all family dinners! If you are concerned about the calorie intake, use non-fat or low-fate evaporated milk instead, and the dish is still fantastic! However the bacon and chives are a must! You won't regret it.

Very good, but I don't thing the evaporated milk did anything special. Save the $ and use regular milk.

These potatoes were really good, the evaporated milk made them nice and creamy! I followed the base recipe ingredients however added a touch of ranch mix, garlic powder, fresh bacon, and green onion to the finished potatoes. Served with homemade fried chicken strip and corn. Will definitely make these again!

This is an easy way to kick up mashed potatoes.  Things I do different is to add 1-2 tbs of Philadelphia cream cheese (depending on how much I make) and sometimes a little sour cream.  Sometimes I also throw chopped garlic in the water when they boil, then try to capture and keep it in when I mash them.  I have to admit, I haven't used Evap Milk though.

These are great!  The consistancy is perfect:)  I added garlic, extra butter & used 5 large potatoes.  This really is a better milk substitution.

If you are concerned with fat content you can cut a little by using lowfat evap milk.  You won't even know the difference.  You can also use less butter or substitute a margarine or lowfat spread.  These work really well when you are serving a meat with no gravy.  They have enough flavor on their own and don't need gravy.  My kids LOVE them, especially with bacon bits stirred in at the end.  Yummy!

Thought they were fantastic. I ended up adding some bacon bits and some different types of cheese to add a little more flavor. But all in all my guests loved this recipe.

These are awesome!!  Love potatoes, love cheese what could be better.  The evap. milk is the secret to these creamy spuds.
Will make often.
