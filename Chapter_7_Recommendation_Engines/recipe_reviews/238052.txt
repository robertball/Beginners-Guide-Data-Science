My mom and I love this stuff. It's so creamy, sweet, and cheesy, and it's such a great treat to make for holidays. I like that it doesn't need boxed cornbread mix to make, and there are a lot of ways to customize it.

I added diced 1/2 of a medium sized onion along with the bell pepper to the butter while melting in saucepan on stove.  Also sprinkled bread crumbs as a topping before baking.

I wasn't impressed by this. It wasn't bad, but wasn't fantastic it was just okay. Maybe the type of cheese used would make some difference? I used mild cheddar cheese. I used red bell pepper later thinking maybe green chiles would be better with some Monterrey jack cheese.
