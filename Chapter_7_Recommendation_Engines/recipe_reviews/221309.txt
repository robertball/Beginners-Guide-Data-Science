Very like the Cdn Bloody Caesar, using clamato juice in liue of tomato juice.  No worchestshire sauce for me, but thats a personal preferance.
Would like a "spear" across the top of this, with a couple steamed shrimp, choritzo or garlic sausage, pickled onion, cherry tomato, or sliced pepper to bring it up to speed.  Noteably missing a celery salt component, let along the lemon juice/celery salt dusted rimming...

Getting "really" picky, I'd favour Frank's hot sauce over Tobasco (McInerny type) as the latter is sort of sour/vinegary..

Sadly this thing just blows your sodium control out of the water...where I love my caesars, I only get one every once in a while, and so get sort of "picky" about how good they have to be...

Good but to make it great (in my opinion) add a splash of dill juice. They sell it in several stores around here and it gives it just something extra that you can't quite put your finger on, plus  agree the hot sauce is a bit too much for me, but I"m a wus!

Want to kick this drink up a notch?  Try using bacon-flavored vodka (yeah, there really is such a thing).  Ah-MAY-zing.

I cannot review this recipe as is. I am a U.S. citizen and have had Bloody Mary's. Since moving to Canada (married), I have had Bloddy Caesars, which in my personal taste is better. Following this recipe, replace tomato juice with Clamato juice (Motts). In place of lemon juice, fresh lime juice tastes better in this drink. To rim or not to rim the glass, this is a personal choicI

Very nice however the hot pepper sauce was a little too aggressive for us.  I would just add less the next time.

I made this to drink with my brew. Used a green pepper, cilatrol & small onion, one stalk celery and chopped in chopper. In blender put 2 cans of diced onions, salt, pepper, a little tabasco & 3 shakes of worchester sauce along with the chopped up mixture.

I used lime juice instead of lemon and added 1 tsp. of horseradish to my tomato juice.  I also add green olives to my garnish.
