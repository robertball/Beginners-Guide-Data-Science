YUM!!! Being a tarragon lover, I figured I would love this. Tried it on baby Romaine- Earthbound Farms. Easy, good, & low carb! Thanks!

I loved this. It was a really nice change of pace from the typical vinaigrette. I served it on tossed on field greens with red onion, feta and dried cranberries. I thought I'd try it again with bitter greens, blue cheese and fresh pear slices. Make a very gourmet salad.

Pretty interesting flavor.  I added this to chopped bell pepper (green & orange), cucumber and kidney beans and chilled.  Will make again.

i love vanilla and was excited to try this and it was just awful. Too much vanilla not enough sugar, better of drinking the vanilla extract, because that is all you will be tasting

Good stuff!  I tried it on a bed of spinach and romaine with blueberries, walnuts and some chopped yogurt pretzels and it was excellent.  It's a nice change of pace from so many fruit vinaigrettes that end up being sickeningly sweet or too tart.
