I used all fresh vegetables, minced the garlic instead of crushed, double the tomatoe sauce, regular rice cooked in chicken broth (no instant) and did more of a layering with the rice,  main ingredients and mozzarella cheese topper.  Absolutely delicious! :-) It did take longer than the recipe called for,  but I don't mind that with the end result being sooo tasty!  My husband raved about it and my three year old ate it all! Definitely will make again.

Pretty good as written.  I always follow the recipes as written the first time before I start improvising.  For me, it is the only way to honestly evaluate THIS recipe.  I do peek at the suggestions of better cooks than I to get inspired, and maybe next time get creative.

I did alter some of the details of this recipe but kept the spirit of the recipe and it turned out delicious. 1) I at least doubled the tomato sauce, 2) I used fresh vegetables, 3) I used extra garlic and a bit of Cajun spice, and 4) I used regular long grain white rice cooked in chicken broth.  I also layered the rice, sausage/veggie/sauce mixture, and cheese, then left in in the pan with the lid on for a bit (10-15 minutes or so?), to heat through and fully melt the cheese. It's been a while since everyone obviously loved dinner around here, but they all raved about this dish-- one of my sons said: "It was great,  just needed a little more broccoli, and a little more sausage, and a little more rice . . . wait, never mind. We just should have doubled the recipe for more everything."

As written, this is OK.  Here's how I do it to get this to closer to five stars:

INGREDIENTS:
•	1 TB Olive Oil
•	1 TB Butter
•	1 Pound Smoked Sausage, sliced into ¼” slices
•	1 Large Red Bell Pepper, ¼’ diced 
•	1 Medium Yellow Onion,  small diced
•	2 Garlic Cloves, Minced
•	½ tsp Onion Powder
•	1 tsp Dried Oregano
•	¼ tsp Crushed Red Pepper Flakes
•	2 Cups Broccoli Florets
•	½ cup Chicken Broth (or water)
•	1 cup Tomato Sauce
•	2 cups Cooked Brown Rice
•	1 cup Sharp Cheddar, Grated
DIRECTIONS:
1)	Add oil and butter to pan and heat over medium-high. Cook the sausage until browned, about 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove sausage from pan and set aside.
2)	Add the bell pepper and onions and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, onion powder, oregano and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3)	Add the chicken broth and tomato sauce, and simmer for 5 minutes uncovered. Add the broccoli, cover, and continue to simmer for about four minutes, until broccoli is crisp-tender.
4)	Uncover pan, add sausage and cook until liquid is almost completely absorbed.  Add cooked rice and cheese and stir to combine and warm through and melt cheese.  Season with salt and pepper.

Easy to make, but bland.  I managed to salvage it by adding some salt, pepper, and some Creole seasoning I had in my pantry.

I used all fresh vegetables and had to improvise some ingredients. I used Hillshire Farms Polka Kielbasa.   Instead of chicken broth I used "Better than Bouillon" and a half cup water.  Also I used Ragu Pizza sauce and canned Italian seasoned stewed tomatoes.  I also threw in a dash of Merlot wine and pepper.  I used much more garlic...at least 5 cloves.

I took the advice of a bunch of reviewers and added seasoning (garlic powder, basil, Cholula) and some spinach, along with the whole 8oz can of tomato sauce. Absolutely delicious!

I thought I put too much work into it for it to be so bland. I used low salt chicken broth, and I think additional spices (not necessarily salt) would really elevate this dish. Maybe ginger or lemon pepper? IDK,I'm just a beginner in the kitchen. I also agree with another reviewer who said there was too much oil. My daughter liked this, so I  will make it again, but next time I will add spices and reduce the oil.

I was not a fan of this. Prior to making this recipe I noticed aside from the garlic there was no other seasoning to this recipe. That said even changing the instant rice to Knorr Spanish rice (which has seasonings included) didn't help the flavor. I appreciated the vegetables this included, but it's not enough for me to make it again.

This dish was pretty good, but of course I made changes. First, I used Johnsonville roasted garlic turkey sausage because it’s what I had at home. I used the 15 oz can of contadina Italian and herbs tomato sauce instead of the 1/2 cup of regular sauce and minced garlic instead of crushed. I used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables (red peppers, yellow peppers and onions) and the baby broccoli florets. I followed the regular instructions, but added pepper, garlic powder, seasoning salt and crushed red peppers for seasoning. I used shredded Colby jack cheese, but don’t really know how much.

It turned out really good. It’s a good base recipe but as it was cooking didn’t seem to have enough flavor so I added more garlic, basil oregano and a splash of red wine. I also cut the rice in half and added more tomato sauce like other reviewers suggested.

We enjoyed this dish, but it was not a favorite.  We weren't as fond of the mozzarella and would likely use a less stringy cheese with more flavor if made again.

This was very good. I did make some minor changes.  I used fresh broccoli and peppers instead of frozen and added it after the meat had simmered in the soup mixture so it still had some crunch. I used regular rice because I don't use instant. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken because that was all I had on hand.  I also added a whole can of tomato sauce because it looked too  soupy.  My kids (11 & 5) cleaned their plates and the husband asked for the recipe to go in rotation! Simple dish with lots of flavor!

Thanks to other chefs, i also made some adjustsments:
1. Minced 4 medium garlic cloves (instead of just 2 crushed cloves)
2. Used an 8oz can of tomato sauce (instead of 4oz)
3. Fresh broccoli
4. Salt and Black pepper to taste (I added about 1/4 tsp each)
5. Added 1/4 tsp oregano
6. Also added 1/4 tsp of red cayenne pepper for a little kick, which I could have omitted w/o losing anything on taste
7. Omitted cheese completely (didn't think it necessary)
8.  Simmered everything for 30 mins to allow liquid to thicken but not evaporate
9. Regular rice (not instant) cooked separately
NOTE: 2 cups of rice is too much. Unless you're a big rice eater, 1 cup will do, given all the other ingredients.

Served a couple of scoops of cooked rice topped by the sausage, etc.

I can't wait to try this with the mozzarella, but over pasta (not rice). Think I'll use either thin spaghetti or penne noodles stirred in olive oil, etc.

Loved this! I had the hot smoked sausage, which added spiciness that we like. Used fresh vegetables, no rice, but added a little spaghetti at the end. Also added cilantro on top, only because I had it and needed to use it. I did taste it first without it, I think this is an awesome dish that is really easy. Definitely making it again.

This came out deliciously. My whole family loved it. I used raw hot sausages instead of Hillshire smoked sausages so it took almost a 1/2 more too cook. I also used regular rice, not the instant. Spending the extra time was worth it.

This recipe was very good, I would make it again but next time I believe I would put a small jar of mild salsa in it. I like my food to have a little more spice. This recipe was a little to bland, Also if your a  first timer to make this, chop up everything first and make your rice then cook the meat last because it does tend to burn easily when your doing other things while the meat is cooking.

I decided to make this tonight and we were definitely not disappointed! I did what another commenter did however, and used all fresh vegetables, doubled the tomato sauce and used a mix of jasmine rice and basmati rice made fresh rather than instant. I didn't layer however, but once I put the cheese on I popped it into the oven for a quick few mins on high broil to really melt the cheese and get a bit of a brown going on. My husband loved this dish, and devoured three bowls before I could finish my one, lol it was absolutely delicious! It does need a little something, he says hot sauce though I don't like hot sauce, but something like that just for that extra little punch of flavour. This is definitely a new favorite, thank you!

Used Janet Kirby Zesto suggestions from June 6, 2016. I also added tomato paste and Italian stewed tomatoes 1 can each.

It was tasty.  I had no tomato sauce on hand so used marinara sauce instead.  It was tasty.  I used regular rice. Only one cup of rice would have been fine.

This is one of my "go-to" quick meals that my husband really enjoys!  Sometimes I use orzo instead of rice or cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, and sometimes I add a little oregano and basil, just for a change of pace.  No matter how I prepare it, it's always a hit!

I read the reviews before I made this so I did make changes.  This is very bland.  Here's what I did.  I used beef sausage because my husband prefers it.  Instead of chicken broth I used Knorr's beef stock. I cooked the instant rice in beef stock.  I used 1 cup of tomato sauce instead of just ½cup.  Also I added ½tsp of salt(you'll need it) and about the same of black pepper.  My husband ate a bowl with mozzarella cheese then a bowl with Colby shredded cheese.  He preferred the Colby cheese I tried it and I agreed. He also added some fresh ground tellicherry peppercorns to suit his taste. He has requested that this be made again and he ate the broccoli so I'm thrilled with how this turned out.

Made as written and the one thing I would change is to cut back on the oil and red bell pepper. Other than that this is perfect and great for getting dinner on the table in a hurry. The best part is that it is all done in one pan making clean up a breeze. Hats off Hillshire Farm!

It turn out ok but the the vegetables and the tomato sauce with the water had to cook a lot longer it was on this wet side, I would probably didn't leave out the water and do the whole can of tomato sauce like other people have said as the water and tomato sauce didn't mix will I had to cook off the water.

Big hit with the family as a week-day dinner!  After reading the reviews, I altered the directions but kept all the ingredients as is.  Cooked the rice independently.  Then cooked the sausage first, (otherwise the garlic gets too charred).  Used a slotted spoon to remove the smoked sausage once it was browned.  Added the (fresh) pepper and onions to the oil for 7 minutes, sprinkled kosher salt to taste.  Added the (fresh) broccoli and garlic, for an additional 2 minutes.  Added the tomato sauce (with salt) and the water to the skillet for 2 minutes, returned the sausage with the cooked rice  to the skillet and mixed everything together.  Sprinkled with cheese and YUM!!  (I think cooking things separately, adding kosher salt to the veggies while they cook and using salted tomato sauce fixes the bland flavor problem)

I substituted two things but other than that everything came out amazing. So instead of putting broccoli I put mixed vegetables and instead of mozzarella cheese I put sharp cheddar. The kids loved it my parents ate it up. This meal was amazing.

Made a 1/2 order for two exactly as stated by the recipe but added some fresh green beans, califlower, and sharp cheddar. WOW it was amazing with no added spices. 
Had the request to make the other half for tomorrow's lunch. 
Oh, tried a little soy sauce on the last couple of bites.... Heaven.

Made as listed but used shredded cheddar cause that’s all I had.  Too much rice, needed more liquids and any spice would have helped. It was filling and we were hungry but won’t make it like this again.

It was pretty tasty and very easy to prepare. I did forget to add the cheese - oops! The only negative is that it was somewhat greasy. The next time I make this dish, I'm going to cut back on the amount of oil and see if that helps.

Like many reviewers I also found this a little bland. But that’s ok. I enjoy finding good recipes with ingredients I like and then spicing it up to my taste. And this is definitely a good recipe! It will be fun experimenting.

I kept double checking the recipe as I made it to make sure I didn’t miss out on any seasoning.  I followed the recipe except I added a teaspoon of Louisiana seasoning.  The result:  it was still bland!  Next time I will cooked the rice in the chicken broth, skip the tomato sauce and use Rotel Diced Tomatoes and Jalapeños to kick it up!!  I will also added Louisiana seasoning to the garlic, sausage, pepper and onion mixture.

It was really good. I used Butterball Smoked Turkey Sausage because that's what we had. We also used cauliflower rice to cut down on carbs. I will definitely make it again.

Not really impressed. Lacked overall flavor and ingredients didn’t seem to go together flavor wise. Also needed more seasoning, pretty bland if done by the recipe. Probably not going to make again.

Excluded the rice and added about 4 slice of bacon and topped it all with a fried egg. A keto version of this that adds some extra protein

I substituted frozen broccoli for fresh and simmered the garlic for an extra long time on medium to begin. Everything had great flavor. Will make again.

I used less oil and subbed catsup for tom. sauce. I used only 1/2 pound of the smoked sausage- we are watching fats and trying to eat more veges. Last I used shredded Pecorino Romano instead of mozzarella, just because we like it.

I had everything except broccoli but made it anyway. I used jalapeno sausage and it turned out great! There is plenty for leftovers the next day. Great to take for lunch to work! I definitely will make again. I might even throw in the broccoli next time! Others have said this recipe was bland. Use jalapeno sausage and that will liven it up!!

I have made this many times, each time I use what I have on hand.  Tonight it was  Echrich 4-Pepper smoked sausage (quite spicy-hot!), fresh broccoli, diced fresh tomatoes, and  red and yellow sweet peppers, sliced.   I use 2 Tbsp tomato paste in place of the sauce.  I have even put frozen corn in this! This is a no-fail recipe, and lets you make it your own!

Delicious!!!  . I used a full- size can of tomato sauce (~14 oz) and no water - but mixed the chicken bouillon into the tomato sauce.  I did everything else per the recipe, except I didn’t add the mozzarella.  Served it over rice and - yum!  Happy hubby, happy tummy!  Thank you for a quick & easy DELICIOUS recipe!

I made this using the Hillshire Farm chicken smoked sausage. I cooked parboiled rice to use because I never use instant. I added the garlic after the sausage and veggies were almost done as to not burn it. Added a little black pepper. It was quite good. It was reminiscent of a Cajun dish so I added Louisiana hot sauce when it was served. It was tasty. I would make it again.

Fantastic!  Only substitutions:  Used a frozen package of Broccoli Normandy (a blend of broccoli florets, cauliflower florets, orange carrots, and yellow carrots) for the broccoli, some fresh spinach leaves, and a cup of tomato sauce instead of the half cup.  The spinach leaves were a nice addition if you like spinach.  Thank you for this recipe!!

This is one I make every so often because it's so good. I added twice as much tomato sauce and added pepper, basil, and oregano. I actually have tons of wild rice on hand and it's even better with it I believe but white rice is good too. The whole family loves it.

I followed the recipe exactly. I’m not a cook I dabble my husband is the chef. I found this recipe to be pretty good except for the fact it was very bland.  I think I should of added spices to it while it was simmering. I will try again with seasonings.

My family loved this! But I have to admit I used  what I had on hand which was fresh veggies, regular rice, and venison smoked sausage. I thought it might turn out a little bland with no seasonings so I added garlic salt and pepper. But with the venison smoked sausage it had tons of flavor. So while I can't honestly say I made this exact recipe, it was still an absolutely delicious idea! Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this recipe, but I did change a little bit. I added 8 oz. of tomato sauce. And I used a box of beef flavored rice and I added about a quarter cup of dry basmati rice to it and cooked it with chicken broth. I can't add a photo because its all gone now ,but it did look real good.

I love this recipe! Are use cooked brown or wild rice instead of instant. But if you don’t have time, instant rice is the way to go. It’s quick easy and so very delicious!

I used all ingredients but substituted rotel for the mater sauce and added tony chacheres & fresh cracked black pepper, a few dashes of scorned woman and a pinch of chipotle smoked pepper. Doubled the cheese, of course :) and it was great!  Will make it again and again.

I always try the original recipe before making changes, but not this time.  The recipe looked way too bland! These are the changes I made, and it turned out amazing! My kids really liked it!  1) I used 3-4 cloves garlic and only a couple TBSPs of oil  2) Brown rice cooked in a rice maker ahead of time 3)Fresh Broccoli instead of frozen 4) Better than Bouillon Chicken base mixed with 1/4 cup water 5) Lastly, I added a splash of Liquid smoke and some pepper and a half a can of black beans. No cheese. My 16 and 18 yr olds cleared their plates.  :)

I only used a Tbsp of olive oil (the smoked sausage renders a LOT of fat, cooked instant brown rice in chicken broth, doubled the tomato sauce and l put all 2 cups of a shredded triple pepper cheese blend on the top making a sort of skillet casserole. Next time, I might add a half of cup or so of black beans and serve with a dollop of sour cream. Excellent recipe!

I made a lot of tweaks, but this is a great easy recipe at it's core. Just needed a little extra flavor. Doubled the garlic and tomato sauce and added some cumin, chili powder, and seasoning sauce. Added a few brussel sprouts too. And I substituted pasta for the rice and beef broth for chicken broth.

Had a heavy hand with the Italian spices, used turkey sausage and a lot more veggies than the recipe called for, and served it over brown rice. Worst part was waiting for the brown rice to cook. Delish dish. Will definitely make it again.

Substitute tomatoes sauce with diced tomato with an oregano, basil undrained. Also added 3-4 tsps SLAP YA'H MAMA seasoning. I had no bell pepper, but I did have a half a bag of birdeye stir fry veggies and bell peppers, ( I removed the baby corn, and the Bambo - or what every you call them). it was AWESOME! I think the next time I make this (and I will): I will add shrimp.  It had a nice Cajun flavor.

I made substiting fresh chopped jalpenos for the broccoli and tomato paste for the tomato sauce and used jasmine rice. For the cheese i used shredded italian and colby-jack instead of mozz cheese. I was a nice, quick week-night meal. Fabulous!

We added a little paprika, pepper, garlic powder.  I made some cheesy garlic biscuits to go with it.  We used Conucah sausage for the first time based on a referral and it was sooo much better than Hillshire, but I’m sure it would be good with that too.  We didn’t add broccoli and we substituted fresh tomatoes for the tomato sauce.  We used chicken broth to make the rice instead of adding it in later.  We only added 1/4 cup of water at the end instead of 1/2.  We all liked it!

Okay cook time is longer then what is listed but worth it. I cooked my sausage with roasted minced onions and olive oil for almost 20 min. I Left the juice of sausage in pan. Then mixed all my veggies in fresh only. Then added 1 cup of tomatoe sauce and 1 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I also added 2 finely chopped habanero peppers, and 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, a half cup of sugar which levels out the spicey part, a teaspoon of lawrys cajun season salt, and eye balled the black pepper. I let that all simmer for about 15 min. Until you have a beautiful thick rouxe in your pan. I made dirty rice on the side at the same time. I cheated and used 2 boxes of zatarains no ground meat. I cooked the dirty rice with 2 cup broth and 2 1/2 cup water. And combined my rice into my pan with sausage and veggies. Let everything simmer for about 10 min. And topped with mozzarella cheese and sharp cheddar.  Lastly i made sweet water cornbread to eat with on the side. It was a huge it. Nailed it. Will be added to the dinner meals.

So delicious! I added a little bit more tomato sauce & I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves. I also added mushrooms and took away onions. It was sooo good! My husband loves it so it’s going in meal rotation!

This is about as easy as a recipe can be. I had some shrimp I needed to use, so I threw them in too. I also didn’t have instant rice, so I used regular white rice . Two cups of rice was too much, but my dogs were appreciative. One of my kids is very picky, but he ate it without too many complaints, so I’m calling it a win!

Wow amazing! I was trying to figure out what to do with the sausage i was cooking, this was perfect, so quick and easy. I was fortunate because i had cooked tomato sauce the day before, i recommend good sauce. I made this with quinoa on the side rather than rice. I used yellow peppers and i added jalapeños. I cooked the sausage whole, sliced and added them to the veggies once the sausage was cooked, just after adding chicken stock and sauce to the veggies. Amazing!

I substituted jasmine rice for the rice in the ingredient list.  I also added maybe a teaspoon of Sriracha sauce when adding the rice. I will definitely make this again.  The ingredient mix seemed odd, but both my wife and I loved it!

Having used chicken basil sausage, complementing it with a little salt, I cooked as directed.  It was fine, but I got no real raves.  In the future, in order to avoid any sogginess, I might stir-fry the vegetables separately, then add them to the sausages and stir in a little pasta sauce.

Taste great! Reviewed others comments and made sure to season to my liking (garlic salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, sea salt, red pepper flakes) - used fresh broccoli, red and yellow peppers, green onions and beef kielbasa (skinless). Made this with basmati rice.  The kids loved it too!

Very bland, using frozen brocolli is very mushy. After trying a serving, I added some fresh pineapple and its juice plus some sugar then it was good except for the brocolli.

Good, but not great. Since I used a non-stick ceramic lined skillet, I reduced the oil to 1-2 tablespoons.  I used the whole 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. It took longer than 10 minutes to cook. 
 I used brown rice, and stirred it into the skillet with everything else. To me, it was rather blah, so I added some Italian seasoning and a small amount of spicy BBQ sauce.  That helped, but I'm not sure I'll make again.

This is a FAST recipe, although it is prone to the "glop factor".  The instant rice tends to dissolve away into "glop", so a regular rice lightly cooked is a good substitute.  Also, I let the mixture cool a bit before adding the cheese, so it didn't melt away as well.  Family members who don't ordinarily eat seconds of anything lined up for this.

I followed other suggestions such as mincing the garlic and doubling the tomato sauce. It was so delicious! Will definitely make again!

We liked it, but thought it was a little bland. We added Cajun seasoning and a half pound of small shrimpand doubled the tomato sauce. Maybe we will add a can of red beans. We had Joe's Stuff from the New Orleans School of Cooking.

I've made this a few times and it's very good. A little bland. I also made this using Italian sausage removed from the casing adding in some Italian seasoning. Delicious!

Next time I would either increase the broth and cook the rice with the other ingredients or make regular (not instant) on the side.

This wasn't very good.  The flavors didn't fit together.  Would have been better if I would have followed the advice of others and added creole seasoning.  Might have worked as a rice and red beans meal with smoked kielbasa.

It was ok, I added corn and seasoning though so it was not as bland.  My suggestion would be not to use instant rice but white rice instead, use fresh vegetables, minced garlic, and instead of  mozzarella use cheddar. : )

I made this today and I read some of the reviews and took some of their advice.. I have been cooking for over 40 years and knew that it would certainly need more spices. Did make some changes, I added 3 cloves of garlic, tsp brown sugar, tsp basil, tbsp. chili powder, 1cup of sauce and 3/4 chicken broth....it was delicious. I also used all fresh vegetables and used noodles instead. My husband loved it, will make again.

I saw this commercial on TV and had to make my own version. 
I use either the Beef or Turkey Smoked Sausage
cut my tricolor bell peppers & onions into strips and sautéed them in butter & minced garlic (adding water as needed to keep from sticking) 
After getting a nice carmalization I remove from skillet, using same skillet and NOT rinsing out all that delicious flavor I make my instant rice in same skillet, after rice is finished, simply add sausage, peppers & onions back in and viola... Easy Breezy Deliciousness

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used what cheese I had in hand instead of mozzarella.  It was very good, and ready.  The only thing I'll change next time is to omit the tomato sauce, it wasn't my family's cup of tea.

I'd recommend chopping the vegetables finer than they say to. Otherwise, following the recipe leads to great results.

It's good for a quick meal.  I used parboiled rice that I cooked ahead of time.    Would cook again if looking for something different.

Excellent.  Add more time for preparation.  I burned garlic while cleaning and cutting pepper and onions.   I will also cook rice in advance next time.   Added broccoli last so it wouldn't fall apart.
Family loved it.

I make this dish on a regular basis and absolutely love it.  Leftovers may not be as colorful  as the first time around, but tastes just as good.  As with most recipes, I added a few more of the vegetables and replaced the tomato sauce with a small can of diced tomatoes with chilies.

I used pasta instead of rice and cooked 1 box of pasta on 4 cups chicken stock with Italian seasoning, the tomato sauce, and crushed red pepper. I cooked all the meat and veggies together and then mixed them in with the pasta. The pasta had good flavor but over all it was just a quick meal with mediocre flavor.

My entire family loved this!  It was quick, easy, and tasty.  I did use frozen vegetable fried rice (from the frozen section at the store), which added a bit more flavor (I think?) and veggies.  I will definitely add this to our rotation!!!  Thanks!!!

I Added 1 can of organic diced tomatoes, used fresh cooked broccoli instead of frozen, and omitted the broth. I grated 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, because that's what i had. i used orzo pasta instead of rice just for a change. I added 3 cloves of garlic, and some red onions, and a few chopped snap peas.  I love my veggies.  It was delicious.  I know the original recipe would also be  delicious, i just added my own spin.

Fantastic meal! Very, very filling. Add smoked bacon and thyme to the pan when cooking the meats and I promise this dish pops with flavor. Pull the thyme before adding the vegetables and you're all set! Our whole family really loved this dish!

Very easy to make. I doubled the sausage, used a whole can of tomato sauce, and whole can of chicken broth. I also added Cajun spice mix and used the spicy shredded cheese blend for a little kick. My husband loved it.

Followed the recipe with only a couple of minor changes.  I used fresh broccoli and red pepper that I prepped the night before and 3 Minute Rice ready to serve brown rice cups.  It was a hit.  I passed the recipe on to a co-worker who also made it for her family a couple of nights later, and she declared it a hit at her house as well, and said it will go into her permanent rotation!

My family liked this dish, it's simple, fast, and satisfying. It's not a 5 star dish, but it's a quick family dish that no one will complain about. So it's good enough for me.

When making a new recipe for the first time, I follow it exactly and then make any changes the next time I make it. It turned out wonderfully. I did double the recipe because there were 7 of us. The only thing that I would do differently would be to cook it in a wok. To keep the sausage from burning you have to stir quite often. Also I like my veggies to have a little crunch to them. Try this recipe, it is very good.

Very good and  hit with hubby as I did not include broccoli.  I made the following adjustments to the recipe:
- used Kroger Hot Italian Sausage
-illuminated broccoli (may sub zucchini next time)
-substituted chopped onion flakes since I did not have fresh onions
-added some Italian seasoning before simmering.  

Will use this again for easy meal.   May use Italian marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce.

This was very tasty and a quick meal to make. We loved it! I did a few minor changes. After cooking the sausage, I added the onion only and cooked it with the sausage for about 5+ minutes to carmelize it some,  then added the rest of the ingredients.  I used chopped fresh broccoli heads and added a little more of the tomato sauce and broth;  3/4 cup instead of the 1/2 cup only because it seemed like it would be too dry after adding the rice. I only cooked 1 cup rice which was perfect. I felt two cups would have been too much.

I gave this recipe five stars even though I changed the way it is made.  A friend made it as written and said it was great.  Her family loved it.  I wanted it to be a one-pot meal so I increased the broth to 3 cups and added 1 cup of Uncle Ben's converted white rice after cooking the onions, garlic, peppers and broccoli (I used fresh).  Rather than the Hillshire sausage, I used Aidell's portobello mushroom and mozzarella smoked chicken sausage because that's what I had on hand.  Then I added the tomato sauce (actually leftover jarred tomato pasta sauce) and broth and simmered it for 30 minutes.  The next time I will add black pepper and maybe some mushrooms.  This rendition turned out great, too, and I was able to use up odds and ends in the refrigerator.

Bland, but not bad. I enjoyed the combination of ingredients but was missing flare for some reason. Probably just needs a slight revision with some added spices.

I made it as the recipe called for. I never make changes the first time. It was terrible. My husband who eats literally anything and would never waste a bite of food did not finish his small plate. No flavor even with all of those ingredients. It needs more spices but I will never make it again.

I cooked my rice as yellow Puerto Rican style rice and then I cooked the sausage per the recipe but I didn't include broccoli and I used mini sweet peppers, onion and everything else minus the broccoli. The liquid did not absorb as the recipe called for so when I mixed in the rice it made it slightly wet, i sprinkled the cheese and it tasted delicious. My family enjoyed it very much. Definitely adding this recipe as one of my go to quick meals to make.

I dice the pepper rather than having strips since it's easier to eat all together and it looks prettier. Rather than using instant rice, I make my own rice in a rice cooker while I cook everything else and I steam the broccoli separately and put it together after the simmering. I have also used a Premio sausage combination pack of hot and sweet sausage, and I've added cut pieces chicken to it also which was good.  I don't add the cheese and it's still great without it. I've been making this usually once a week and doubled the recipe for a family gathering and everyone raved about it.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!

I followed the recipe except that I only used about half of the rice and only 2/3 of the broccoli.  It was great!  I've already been asked to make it again.  Not sure if they really liked it that much or just want someone else to cook...

I trippled the chopped garlic, added 2 small zuchinni, and another cup of chicken broth.  I also added salt and pepper every time I added more ingredients.  I  added a pinch of dried chili peppers and a couple of pinches of dried basil.  I don't use instant rice.  I had around 4 cups of lleftover Japanese Botan rice that I added to the mixture.  No cheese, but both my husband and I thought it was fantastic.

My husband loves this recipe so much he helps cook it.  We do use  rice cooked in rice cooker and reheated in recipe.  Also, we use mozzarella cheese, but also might add grated colby or sharp cheddar.  Easy to prepare and very good.  Oh, we also use fresh vegetables and cover and cook for about 15 minutes, adding cheese the last five or so.

With the additions listed below , this was real good!  I apologize for making changes and then rating, but I think this recipe would have been bland without kicking it up a bit. (I halved the recipe, so the changes apply to that amount. )  First, I used hot Hillshire smoked sausage; doubled the garlic  (minced) and used instant brown rice because that's what I had, and used whole box of frozen chopped broccoli. I added 3/4 tsp. of "Paula Dean house seasoning" (I add onion powder in same proportion as garlic powder to the P.D. house seasoning).  I used up a little  green pepper along with the red pepper.  I used some left over diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  I doubled the mozzarella cheese....of course. Will definitely make again.

Overall a really great recipe. My whole family loved it! I sautéed the garlic, onions and peppers in the oil before adding the meat and then seasoned with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika with the liquids. Great flavor!

I agree that it lacked some ingredient that would tie it all together. It is rather bland. My boyfriend never adds salt to anything. He asked for salt and pepper. I knew what that meant--;-(. The liquid was not absorbed after at least 20 minutes of simmering. I think there was too much water in the broccoli. That, plus the addition of fat from the sausage, is reason enough to skip the oil next time--if there is one.

This will be my go-to recipe for a quick dinner with great leftovers.  I cooked long grain rice separately in a rice cooker and used one large stalk of fresh broccoli cut into small flowerettes.  Added chopped up fresh tomato and fresh basil and of course, salt and pepper.  A big hit.

I did not make any changes as I wanted to judge the recipe as written. I will never make this again. As with other reviews, this dish had absolutely NO flavor. While eating this, I took it off my favorites, and decided I wanted to write a review.

I forgot the cheese at the end but it was very good.  Used a blend of vegetables instead of broccoli alone and minced the garlic instead of crushing it.  I didn't have prepared chicken broth but used chicken bouillon  and water instead.  Very filling and satisfying.

Easy, I used chicken sausage stuffed with jalapeño and mozzarella cheese, what could go wrong!  Used garlic, oregano,
Freshly made tomato sauce, brags organic sprinkle, salt free, and rushed red pepper. Served over brown rice, sprinkle of parm. Cheese.

Made this Sunday I had frozen smoked cocktail weinies, I sliced them in half, added zucchini, squash to the broccoli, peppers, onions and used diced canned tomatoes instead of sauce, added a bit of flour to thicken it....it came out delicious!  My man loved it!! I tweaked here and to taste...worth it!

I read the reviews that said it was bland so I added two jalapeños and cayenne pepper. I also added the cooked rice while the broth was cooking out so it absorbed the flavor too! It was very good!

The biggest problem was the amount of olive oil and the overall blandness of the dish. The sausage creates enough grease on its own without adding this large amount of olive oil on top of it.  The vegetables could have sauteed with the sausage and chicken broth.

I made this but I did buy fresh Broccoli  and steamed it.  I served it with a side dish of mixed vegetables.  I did use minced garlic, but all other vegetables were fresh.  It was delicious.  Quick and easy to fix.  I love the one pot meals  that are posted on here, especially for the summer months.  Yes I will make it again.  We loved it.

I made it as per the recipe the first time and thought it was okay.  I added 1/2 lb mushrooms, more garlic, cayenne and a generous amount of Italian seasoning.  I also changed my liquids to 1/4 c water and 3/4 c tomato sauce and reduced the rice to 1 1/2 cups.  I got rave reviews on that rendition.

Had no broccoli, so used sliced fresh okra.  All was eaten.  Will cook it again.  Absentmindedly sliced a potato and threw it in the skillet, knowing full well rice was cooking.  Duh!  Just removed cooked potato and put it a container in the refrigerator for next morning's breakfast.

I added a little more of broccoli because the package was bigger which was still not enough, added more of the smoked sausage and 3 cups of brown rice, so so delicious, was just enough for 5 servings, will make it with more of everything next time, love it love it love it! My husband and children loved it! Will make it again soon!

It lacked flavor and was kinda mushy. Thank god I used all fresh vegetables or it would have been even more watered down. I recommend adding spices to your liking.

I have made this 3 times for guests and it always gets raves, moans of delight and requests for the recipe. Once I used a combination of Kielbasa, turkey and chicken sausage because that's what I had available. I couldn't tell the difference.  I use jarred garlic, and I accidentally used a whole small can of tomato sauce instead of the half called for. I added a few dashes of chili sauce because I love that flavor.  I have always gone with fresh broccoli, but next time I want to try frozen. Once I also used a bag of frozen peppers & onions for convenience, just to see if it was as delicious that way. Easier is better if the taste is unaffected. Right? Worked beautifully! Thanks so much for this easy & excellent recipe.

Delicious! Prep time for me was longer than 20 min. Also next time I will use regular rice, not instant. I don't really like the texture of instant rice.

My family really enjoyed this. Best part is I did the prep work in advance and then just threw it together.  Fast and delicious.

Yes, I would make it again but I would use fresh broccoli.  It was even good left over after adding a bit more liquid.

We liked this (and add salt and pepper ) but I think the amount of oil can be cut in half.  I also used long grain rice as that is what I prefer.  Thanks for a quick meal choice !

My guy doesn't like rice so I made this with the thin egg noodles.  He and I really enjoyed this entrée.

This dish turned out DElicious!  I used fresh broccoli and instead of minute rice I used pre-cooked regular white rice.  What a nice blend of flavors with the kielbasa sausage.  This goes into my "must make again" folder.

We enjoyed this recipe but I had to make changes since I did not have the exact ingredients. I used small sweet peppers that were red, orange and yellow. I used pineapple and bacon andouille sausage and sharp cheddar cheese. I did use the chicken broth rather than the water.  I followed cooking instructions per recipe. The dish had good flavor.

It's very bland. Easy to make but needs some flavor.

Didn't make any changes. It's a good recipe, but I didn't think it was great.
