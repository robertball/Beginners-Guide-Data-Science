This was pretty good.  I would add more of the pickled jalapenos next time.  Also, I put in the lime juice with the other liquid, instead of waiting til the end.

Very tasty and very easy to make. A little spicy for my taste, but good. Next time, I will probably use fresh, roasted jalopenos instead to turn the heat down.

My husband didn't care for this - thought it was too spicy.  My daughter loved it!  If I make this again, I'll probably use less red pepper.

I really like this recipe, it's easy and with the exception of the Clam juice, it's all standard pantry items. I will add shrimp next time to make it a more substantial meal, but I am really happy with the outcome. Thanks!

8.16.19  I seldom do this on a new recipe, but I had to make  changes to salvage this for dinner.  First, I made exactly as written with the exception of not adding the pasta, and found the sauce totally without flavor, flat.  We simply would not have eaten it the way it tasted, just bland.  So I added more pickled jalapeño, more red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, chopped fresh oregano and basil, added some small cut-up sweet fresh tomatoes, along with some red bell pepper, and just let it cook down, allowing the flavor to develop. I cooked the pasta separately because I’d already reduced the sauce, added it to the sauce along with some sautéed shrimp, and will say the lime at the end was this recipe’s salvation for us.  This recipe has had decent reviews, and I wouldn’t discourage others from trying it, but it just didn’t work for us.  I giving it 4 stars, but that’s based on the changes that I made.
