I agree with another user as this recipe is most forgiving. How forgivinf? Check this out : not only have I never made souffle, I have never eaten it! Light and airy - great with coffee ice cream and chocolate syrup. I will be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!!

This souffle was great! I am a chocolate lover and this fudgy sauce really completed the dessert and there's no need to add more chocolate to the souffle itself! Make sure that the egg whites are at room temperature or they will not whip properly.  Do not repeatedly open and close the oven door or the movement will cause the souffles to fall.  I baked this recipe in 6 small ramakins filled almost to the top for 35 minutes. I recommend serving it like this -when the souffles are done, scoop a small "dent" out of the middle and pour chocolate sauce inside. After that, you could top it with a scoop of ice cream, drizzle the chocolate sauce on top and maybe sprinkle some chocolate pieces, raspberries or strawberries on top.  YUM!

I had never made a souffle in my life, but this turned out great I had run out of milk, so I substituted 1/4 water and 3/4 light cream. I used a high-quality cocoa, which made it super-chocolatey. It was gorgeous! It baked up beautifully in a round pyrex bowl. Great warm with ice cream. Individual servings can be reheated in the microwave.

We did tests of various chocolate souffle recipes from lots of sources and this one was the best!  Rich and chocolate-y.  Worth the little bit of work required.

I tried this for New Years Eve dessert and it was fabulous.  As a baker though I just tweaked it a little.  I added 3 oz. of my favorite bittersweet chocolate to the hot milk and whisked until blended. Also added 2T. orange liquor along with the sugar and vanilla.  You can sprinkle with confectioners sugar, but we just scooped out and topped with whipped cream and a scoup of homemade icecream.  If you are a chocolate lover you need to make this.  It was so simple and everyone loved it - also made a great presentation.

I've used this recipe over a dozen times already.  I've always had consistent results - even made in two different kitchens.  
I normally add 2 tablespoons of the Hershey's chocolate powder and that is sufficient chocolate for me.  But my souffle doesn't stay up like in some restaurants.  My friend who uses a different recipe (involving a double-boiler, too much trouble for me) told me to add a teaspoon or two of lemon juice when the egg white peaks just start to form.   I tried that the other night and voila!  My souffle stayed up beautifully until we dug our spoons into it.  
I prefer my choc souffle with a little bit of whipped cream.  Easily mixed together using heavy cream, some sugar and bit of vanilla extract.

This VERY easy, forgiving recipe produced great results. I had a small mishap, accidently ran water into the mix, during my first try but the results were still fantastic. 

Everyone will love. They think it is hard but it and it is easy enough to make most any time. 

I tried cooking it in individual remekins but didn't get as good of results as I did with one larger ceramic dish.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! I found this recipe extremely forgiving.  At first when I blended the cocoa with milk, I thought it might be too thick (since I've never made it before) but I stuck with the recipe and it all turned out great!  everyone who ate it enjoyed it. They never would have guessed it was my first time ^___^  I would suggest adding a chocolate sauce on top.  Also, I used low fat Hershey's cocao instead of the specified kind as well as skim milk, it still turned out great.

Easy and impressive *looking*, smells great cooking, and the texture is enticing, too.  But where's the taste?  My chocoholic husband and I were both let down by the blandness.  On separate occaisions, I have tried using a higher cocoa content, better quality cocoa, putting a square of chocolate in the center, adding one T. brewed coffee, adding orange liqueur- and it just never seems to rise above "average" in flavor.  It's still in "experiment" mode for me- not a keeper or something I would serve guests.

This is a very recipe in terms of souffles. At least thats what my mom said. I'm 12 years ol, I made it, no help(exept for seperating eggs) I had a few mishaps that could easily be avoided. My whole family loved this souffle! It tasted like a brownie but ten times lighter but it was surprisingly filling. Its only flaw was the fat that it could have been more chocolatey. Tgis workkes very well in personel souffle dishes.

AMAZING!!!   My first souffle and it was perfect, and easy.  I will make this again and again!  I made two souffles tonight for ten friends and it didn't last 5 minutes. I prepared some of the ingredients in advance (i.e., pans buttered, eggs separated, cocoa & flour mixed) It took about an hour from start-finish. I wish I had some leftovers I want some more.

First time I had ever made a Souffle, and it came out terrific! I was a little worried that it wouldn't come out as well, because I couldn't seem to get the egg whites to get stiff, so I was releived that it still came out good. Didn't have the coffee ice-cream either, but I still liked it by itself. Deffinetly want to try it with the ice-cream, though!!

I made this recipe last night for my husbands birthday dinner.  It was pretty simple to make; however I was disappointed because there was no chocolate sauce in the middle.  Maybe I baked it too long.  All in all it tasted wonderful, light and fluffy.  I served the souffle on a big white plate drizzled with chocolate syrup, sprinkled with powdered sugar and a scoop of vanilla bean icecream.  ***********For a helpful hint, I made the chocolate mixture ahead of time and set it aside.  When we were ready for dessert, all I had to do was beat the egg whites and fold them into the chocolate mixture.  This allowed me to spend time with my husband, rather than be in the kitchen all night. :)***********

This was my first time making souffles, they turned out good, but extremely rich!  I served them with vanilla ice cream & whipped cream.  But I think next time I'll make some kind of sauce as well; either chocolate, rasberry, or strawberry.  Everyone enjoyed these, so I'll definitely be making these again!

This was good but I did add 2 ozs of semisweet squares like a previous reviewer suggested.  I wasn't sure how cooked it was suppose to be either.  I tested it with a toothpick like a cake and it was just a little goopy when I took it out.  Was great with Starbucks Java Chip ice cream...but I think anything would be good with that ice cream.  You know how if you eat cake or cookies too soon out of the oven you don't get the full flavor of the dessert?  It's too hot and sometimes it even tastes better the day after.  This dessert is kind of like that.  It says to serve immediately but I wonder if you let it sit till it was all the way cool if the flavor would come out more.  But I guess the idea of souffles is to serve them warm.  All and all it was dee-lish and I would make again but with probably another ounce of bittersweet chocolate.  (This is in addition to the cocoa it already calls for.)

I thought souffle was supposed to be difficult, but this recipe makes it incredibly easy. I added 2 blocks semi-sweet chocolate to an 8 serving size and it was just perfect. I left it to cool about 30 mins and it sunk a tad, but it still tasted great, especially with the icecream. I liked placing a touch of chocolate brandy sauce on top. I'll try the lemon next time. One thing they didn't mention, but I remembered from reading another recipe was to make an aluminum foil jacket around the top. Putting the 8 servings in a six cup dish, it needed a good 3" cuff of foil (buttered and sugared) to help hold it up as it cooked.

This was my first stab at making a souffle, and it came out great....the only thing was it was just a little bit dry.   That could be because my mother called as I was heading to take it out of the oven, but next time I'll put a pan of water in the oven just to be on the safe side.   I did a low carb version, I used cream instead of milk, low-carb baking mix instead of flour and Splenda instead of sugar. I also took another reviewer's advice and added a tsp of lemon juice to the egg whites when they got foamy, and my souffle rose and stayed up like it should.   It got rave reviews from the family.

Sinfully good, embarassingly easy.  I've now made this two weekends in a row- both times served after large dinners- and everybody wanted seconds... or thirds.  They literally scraped the bowl last night.  We serve with vanilla ice cream and "Fudge Sauce" by Valerie on this site.  The BEST dessert ever-- very impressive with fairly little fuss.  I was always intimidated by dessert souffles, until now.  A+!

This was my first attempt at a sweet soufflé at it was very easy.  This soufflé puffed up very nicely and fell after 10 minutes out of the oven.  This is my guess as to why it is suggested to serve immediately.  I tried a piece shortly after it came out of the oven and I wasn't too impressed.  It just seemed bland and as though it lacked something.  However when I tried some the next morning, I was in love!  It was so chocolaty, but light enough that it melted in your mouth.  The flavor was similar to a fudgey brownie.  I know that soufflé is supposed to be served before it falls, but I actually like it better after it falls as I enjoy the texture more.

Wow! Delicious AND easy to make. If you make one sweet souffle this year, make this one. 

I took the advice of some here and added two ounces of semi-sweet chocolate to the mixture.  To deal with the slight addition of the melted chocolate liquid, I also doubled the flour to 1/2 cup.

This was my very first chocolate souffle......just pulled it out of the oven and served it to my family.  I am so proud of myself, as it turned out perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly as listed and it turned out to be a work of art.  Even my neighbor, who is a professional caterer, said it was the bomb!  For those of you who don't know what a 6 cup souffle dish is (I didn't), it is the same as a 1 1/2 quart souffle dish.  I got mine at Bed, Bath & Beyond for $7.99.  Good Luck!  Elise

I recalculated the recipe to yield 3 servings, used a small round corningware dish similar to the individual 'grab-its', and still baked the souffle for 40 minutes. I don't like runny-center souffles. I served it with fresh strawberry slices.

Really yummy! When mixing the cocoa mixture with the hot milk, it got WAAAY to thick...I'm talking like impossible-to-continue-stirring-thick. So...I just added a little more milk until it was at a very thick but "stirrable" consistency. After cooling the chocolate mixture and folding it into the egg whites, I was concerned because it was liquidy and for some reason I was expecting a meringue consistency. If that happens to you, don't worry it's SUPPOSED to be like this. I placed my soufflé dishes in a broiler pan that was almost half filled with water and then baked them for 45 minutes...turned out perfect! (And as long as this review is, it's actually a pretty easy recipe) Oh and the coffee ice cream is delicious with the soufflé.

This is definitely deep and dark. You will need to add semi-sweet chocolate like others if you want something "chocolatty" I served with raspberries and choc. sauce  and it got rave reviews. I also made it about an hour or so ahead of time and put it in the fridge until the over was free for baking and it was done right after dinner.

Outstanding results 2x with this recipe.  

Used small ramekins instead of the large souffle dish for individual desserts.

Used Giardelli instead of Hersheys cocoa.

Adding warm fudge sauce makes this an indulgence on par with any dessert you'd find anywhere!

This was my first time making a souffle and I must say that I was VERY NERVOUS, since my mother was very excited since she loves souffle...so there was some pressure *chuckle*. Aside from minor setbacks (I could not get the egg whites stiff so I settled for very foamy, nor did I know how to "fold" the batter so I gently pushed it around until mixed) it was quite easy, and I added 1 tsp lemon juice...perhaps because of my eggwhite and folding issues, it did not rise as much as I had hoped it would, but it did rise some, and sank a LITTLE, next time I will use 2 tsp lemon to see if that works better. I also threw in a handful of bittersweet chocolate chips, delicious! I can't wait to try it again. I served it with "creme anglaise I" from this site and haagen daaz vanilla fudge icecream...HEAVENLY. Just thinking about makes me yearn for more, and my family loved it too! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

For a person who has never made or eaten a souffle before, I honestly didn't know what to expect.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this recipe.  I did like previous views suggested and added 2 oz of bittersweet chocolate and I had to substitute the Dutch processed cocoa for regular cocoa powder, but it still turned out great.  One suggestion that I make myself is to add an additional 2 T of sugar.  Alone, the bitterness of the chocolate can easily be tasted, but once paired with ice cream, that problem can easily be overlooked.

Simple, delicious, (relatively) healthy and oh-so chocolatey. This is a perfect recipe for anyone who needs a less guilty chocolate indulgence. Serve immediately before it loses volume and deflates!

Nice and easy to make. I do have to agree with the others though that is a bit short in the chocolate flavor. To help compensate for it I made a mocha sauce to pick it up a little. (a strawberry sauce also helps too) 

All in all I think this is a good base recipe and now it's time to have some fun with it.
