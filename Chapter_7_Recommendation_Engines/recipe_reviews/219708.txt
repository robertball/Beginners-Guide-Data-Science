Very good. I have to admit to some tweaking . . . I used mini ice cream sandwiches - one layer - my 9x13 did not have room for a second layer. I also cut the sandwiches to fit the pan. I did not bother with the chocolate pudding mix in the Cool Whip - and it was not missed - at all. I used nearly 2x the peanut butter called for (in 2 layers), all the hot fudge and caramel sauce (one layer, each), and mini Reese's cups (one layer). I did the first layers as called for (not measuring the peanut butter), then, as I saw I was running out of room, I did another layer of peanut butter and topped with the last layer of Cool Whip.  This got raves at a rehearsal dinner (= [I put it in the fridge when we started serving dinner, so it would soften a bit, after reading Frauline's note.] Oh! It took one box and a few extra of the mini sandwiches for the single layer - 18 mini's to a box . . .

We loved this but it's HUGE. Next time I make it I will only do half the layers or make a smaller pan. It's delicious!

Instead of dealing with preparing peanut butter cups, I chose to use Reese's  flavored choc syrup, the "Magic shell" kind. It added more texture and stability to my lasagna!
Of COURSE we're making this again! My 8yo son did most of the layering.

OMG! DELISH! This was gone super fast. I didn't think it would be that good because I am not a huge fan of the ice cream sandwiches, but it was.

Really good and pretty easy. It's just not cheap, but that's ok for special occasions. I made it for my son's 12th birthday and he kept saying, "My mom's really good at making ice cream cakes", which was nice to hear.

Great idea, I scaled mine down and used mini ice cream sandwiches.   Topped with peanut butter m&ms and mini peanut butter cups.

I found this recipe very sweet but enjoyed it quite a lot :)
At first I was a little hesitant because I was told that it has a lot of calories, sugar and fat...But its so worth it as this is the yummiest sweet thing I have had in a long time!

It has good texture, a great consistency and the layers of Ice cream were very yummy when combined with the Ice cream sandwiches etc. This is probably one of the best recipes of ice cream lasagna I have tried out of many..(my first attempts were too hard or too soft or didn't set right etc)
My one recommendation is to add marshmallows  and sprinkles to the layers as this  A- Improves the taste a heck of a lot, and B- Makes the decorative half of ice cream lasagna better  (Just in case people are coming over, Its for a party etc.)

This particular recipe I found is a little on the pricey side but DEFINITELY  worth as it lasted for a loooooonngggg time, The only problem with that was that I had to keep freezing and refreezing it as I couldn't eat it all at once because I would've been violently  sick... But if the servings were made on the smaller side I could handle eating it :)

Personally..All in all I think this is one of the best  desserts ever made and rate it 69/5 Stars!! LOVE IT..LOVE IT..LOVE IT!!!! 
Great  recipe,
Thank you so much for sharing it with us

I made this as a surprise for my son's 31st birthday. He requested that I make it again for him this year (and he has never made a food request before).

I made this exactly as the recipe was written. I should've thought ahead and used a deep Pampered Chef stoneware 9 x 13 I have for it spilled over the sides after adding the second layer to my regular Pyrex dish. This was a big hit for a birthday party. I was told by my girlfriend that she fell even more love with me after she ate this. Lots of lip smacking and yum yum noises from around the table.

As a previous poster stated, this is a pricey dessert, but it was delicious.  Very rich so it took us weeks to finish it all.  I made it exactly as recipe said and it tasted just like an ice cream Snickers bar.

This is not a 5 star recipe, it's a 10! This is to die for and everyone that has tried it has copied the recipe, if you don't have a sweet tooth don't even try it. I also added a few  cocktail peanuts between one of the middle layers.  I've been asked for this recipes numerous times.

This was so easy, and perfect for a child who does not like cake, for his birthday "cake", we put candles in it, and everyone enjoyed it! I used magic shell but no caramel, on 1 layer i usedeopolital ice cream sandwiches, and the other just vanilla to give it a colorfull look.
