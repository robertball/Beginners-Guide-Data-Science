Great recipe.  I added 1 cup of chicken stock and 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning mix to make more sauce.  It was a big hit!

You are a life saver!  I've also been making this recipe for years.  School starts tomorrow and my daughters asked for this for dinner tonight and we are in the midst of a move and all my recipes are on a POD somewhere.  I couldn't remember the exact proportion of Dijon mustard to Italian dressing, did a quick search and found your recipe.  Thank you so much for taking the time to post this!  To everyone else:  This Is Delicious!  Try it!

OMG, this was amazing!  Given the limited ingredients I figured it'd be just "okay" but boy was I wrong!  SO SO delicious!  Next time I will double the sauce/onion because that sauce was SO good that we are all scraping the pan with our fingers for just a bit more.  Even my 15 year old, who supposedly doesn't like onions, took more than her share (of onions!).

Wow this was great. I added 2 tablespoons of extra Italian dressing. And I used Webers horseradish mustard (from Western NY) the sauce and onions were real tasty. I would make this again.

Served it over brown rice and wish I'd made more sauce.  I used thick cut loin chops from a local butcher shop. This is a very tasty dish. Didn't change a thing.

I'm so glad you all like this recipe. The main reason for the small amount of sauce is to keep the calories reduced - I think I got this from Weight Watchers (or another 'lo-cal' cookbook) many many years ago. I've made it with more sauce, more onions, different Italian dressings - it's also great with a balsamic vinaigrete!!

Exceptional and SO EASY!  I really never cared for pork chops but now I am rethinking them as a more frequent item for our dinner.  This is superb! Doubled the sauce and cooked for only 2 chops. Served this with Chef John's Fondant Potatoes for a very easy and delicious meal.  Thank you Karen for the submission!

This is the best!!!! So easy, a go to so many nights! I usually do the recipe with just two pork chops as the sauce is so great! Rice, noodles, mashed potatoes, go for it! You won’t be sorry.

OK for a fast dinner esp if you want to do it on the stove top. Not sure about the flavors of the dijon mustard and italian dressing. Might try in again using a different mustard and dressing. Onions are optional and didn't really add anything interesting to the flavor.

Very flavorful. I did use a tablespoon or so of canola oil instead of cooking spray and used a cast iron skillet. I will definitely make this again!

I just made this recipe, and we liked it a lot. I only had Robusto Italian dressing, so that's what I used. When I went to get the dijon mustard from the fridge, I found I only had German whole grain mustard, so again,  that's what I used. It was delicious. There was plenty of sauce for my taste without adding more liquid.

It was ok but a little bland (and I added garlic too). Perhaps if you doubled the sauce it would make more of an impact. Was a very easy/quick recipe to make so that was great. Will try it again but with Italian seasoning added and double the sauce.

Made these last night.  I used EVOO instead of the spray Pam.  I only made 3 pork chops and I'm glad I did because there wasn't any extra sauce.  The sauce that was there tasted good (my daughter didn't think so).

So yummy! I only had zesty Italian dressing but it still worked!
