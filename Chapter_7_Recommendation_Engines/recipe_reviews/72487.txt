I used this sauce for a chicken and rice noodle dish.  Excellent!  Added a whole can of cocounut milk and reduced peanut butter to about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup.  Also added two tablespoons of sugar.  Omitted the cilantro.  Excellent.  I will make this again and again. (This makes enough sauce for 1 pound of rice noodles, therefore a main dish for 4 people or two famished people. I also used two chicken breasts cut into long pieces and stir fried them in evoo before adding the sauce).

For a vegetarian option:  Steam some carrots and green beans in place of the chicken breast.   Then in a skillet, saute 3 cloves of garlic with 1 tablespoon of grated ginger.  When the ginger starts to turn pale brown on the bottom of the skillet, throw in the green beans and carrots with a splash of water to deglaze.  After this step, throw in the cooked noodles and then work in the peanut sauce.

Excellent recipe. Having just returned from Indonesia was eager to eat some satay so gave this sauce a try! FANTATSIC. I did however add more coconut milk instead of water and used ground dried ginger (its all I had) Plus I added a heaped tablespoon of Sambal Olek (Chilli Jam) so omitted the lime and used a squeeze of lemon instead and it tastes fantastic. Just like it tasted last week when I was sitting in a resturant looking out over the ocean and listening to gamalen music!! :)

Hmm Actually I kind of changed the recipe LMAO I also used Soy rather than fish sauce as Husband is alergic to seafood but it still worked perfectly. Thankyou for an excellent guidline to base my sauce on!

This is a wonderful Thai peanut sauce! I followed the recipe exactly. When i tasted it, I thought it was marginal (a little bit of a letdown). But...after sitting in the fridge for and hour and then being used with Thai Chicken Satay (recipe on this site - read my review), it was awesome! The various flavors in the sauce must have needed time to blend and accompanied by the taste of the marinated chicken, it was definitely 'The Best Thai Peanut Sauce"!

I made this as a dipping sauce for a fondue party and it was everyone's favorite.  I used seasoned rice vinegar and low fat coconut milk.  Next time I will use the regular coconut milk for more flavor.  I found the most important thing was to make it ahead of time (day before if possible) to allow the flavors to develop.  Make the basic recipe, wait a couple of hours, taste and start adding.  Do this several times with at least an hour in between until it is to your liking.

(Edit to add: After a day of being in the frig, this sauce is even better.  Can really taste the herbs so much more.) I had no idea how to make peanut sauce.  With a few of the suggestions of other reviewers I love this sauce.  I cut everything in half.  I then added more coconut milk to make it thinner, about a tablespoon or so of sesame oil, about 1/2 TBS of rice vinegar, 2 TBS. of hoisin sauce, and 2-3 TBS of white sugar. I put it all in a small food processor  because I used crunchy peanut butter.  I used everything else in the recipe.  The sesame oil made the biggest difference and I highly recommend it.  The hoisin sauce didn't add much and I probably won't use it next time. We had this with Vietnamese Fresh Spring Rolls from this site.  (also had the fish sauce from that recipe)  This peanut sauce is so good I was dipping bread in it.  Will also use it to make noodle dishes.

This recipe is nearly worthless as written. It is WAY too thick and WAY too peanut buttery - it just tastes like barely watered down peanut butter. The good thing is it's easy to play around with and improve. I doubled the ginger, lime juice, soy sauce (low sodium), and coconut milk (lite), added some lime zest, copious amounts of chile garlic sauce, and several tablespoons of hoisin sauce, chucked in about a full cup of chopped cilantro, and thinned it with additional water. That made for a finger-licking good peanut sauce. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti with tender-crisp veggies (bell pepper, snap peas, scallions, broccoli) and pan fried tofu squares.

Delicious and flavourful! The mixture may sound a little odd (fish sauce, coconut milk, peanut butter) and I was a little hesitant to try this, but I am glad that I did! Using smooth peanut butter makes all the difference - I also made the addition of extra cilantro and some lemongrass. Served with chicken satay. My end verdict? A huge hit!!

Really great recipe, except I cut down the amount of peanut butter because it seemed to be a bit too much. I also found it helped to make the sauce with the ingredients in the stated amounts (except with less peanut butter), and then to adjust after so that it appeals to your personal tastes. I like adding more coconut milk, personally.

This was delicious in a peanut chicken stir fry, but I plan on using it for the next time I make satay!  It was even better the next day, as I dipped my finger and ate some, then mixed the rest with some leftover rice.  Oh man, this sauce is great!!  Oh, I also halved it, and it still made enough for 6 - 8 people.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this recipe!

quick, simple and VERY good.... I like to warm it up some in the microwave after all is assembled to bring out more of the flavor...I also instead of using just hot sauce put in 1 Tablespoon of red thai curry paste (it is what we keep on hand all the time) think it adds more flavor and authenticity too.

Great, with these additions: about a tablespoon or so of sesame oil, about 1/2 TBS of rice vinegar, 2 TBS. of hoisin sauce, and 2-3 TBS of white sugar.  And let it sit in the fridge overnight.

***You must let this sauce sit a while before you make your decidion on it*** When I first tasted it I tasted overwhelming peanut butter with the other flavors separate and not blended.  I was not going to use it right away so it sat and when I tasted it the next morning WOW!!very good I can't wait to try it on noodles and chicken with vegetables.

I really wanted to make a Thai peanut sauce but was afraid that my mom wouldn't be able to tolerate it, as she is prone to heartburn and sensitive to certain spices. I tried a (much) milder version of this sauce and we all loved it! It was still flavorful but without the "kick" of the original. I substituted almond milk for coconut milk, used only 1 1/2 tablespoons of soy sauce, and omitted the fish sauce, hot sauce, ginger root, and cilantro. I also added a tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons of white sugar, and a tablespoon of sesame oil. I let the flavors mingle in the refrigerator for a while, then heated it up on the stove just before serving with rice. Thanks for the inspiration!

I really liked this. Added extra coconut milk to thin it a bit, other than that, made as directed. I served it with fettucini pasta, and it was great. Added some crushed peanuts to the top for a little crunch, and it was great.

I made this without coconut milk and instead substituted water. We also ran out of peanut butter so I added tahini - delicious! I also added in a pinch of salt to help pull out the flavors! I served this with sauteed kale and carrots over quinoa. Delicious!

If I wanted peanut butter, I would eat it from the jar. This recipe was easy, but disgusting. It did NOT taste like any kind of good peanut sauce I have ever eaten before. I don't reccommend this recipe! :(

Reduced peanut butter down to 3/4 cup and doubled the coconut milk.  Wonderfully delicious on Thai Chicken Satay (this site) and jasmine rice.  Excellent with side dish of Sesame Broccli also this site. Made this for hubby, who said it was better than Thai Thai by Ricky restaurant (in Mandeville).  LOL!

I changed so much in the recipe but it still deserves five stars because I wouldn't even have attempted it with seeing this first. I mostly followed the directions except, used only a 1/2 cup of peanut butter, no water, regular milk and a fat pinch of shredded coconut, red pepper instead of hot sauce. I also added honey and brown sugar to taste - I wanted that sweet-hot taste. (I put the sauce in the the microwave for a minute to soften and make it easier to stir.) All the substitutions were because of what I had on hand. Next I sauted the garlic and ginger in olive oil and added cut up chicken and sliced carrots. After the pasta was done, I drained it, added it to the chicken pan, mixed a little, then added the peanut sauce and mixed again and served. This was awesome! My husband loved it, the kids kind of liked it but I think I made it a little too spicey for them. Overall, a great reciped to use however you would like. Thanks Stephanie!

Seriously, I could put this on everything...it's incredible.  

I probably used 1/2 c more coconut milk to thin it, and used crunchy PB.

This is fantastic!  I omitted fish sauce (I'm vegetarian) and instead used more soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil.  I didn't have any cilantro either, so I added some minced green onions.  What an amazing, easy, inexpensive sauce!  I am not all that familiar with Thai cooking, but this sauce makes me want to start!  I'm serving it over pasta right now, but I'll definitely make it again and again.  So creamy and flavorful and WOW!

This sauce was exactly what I was looking for! It is spicy and sweet and the coriander really made a difference. I used it as a dipping sauce to go with grilled chicken, my husband and I loved it.  I had no problems with the texture.  What I did was to incorporate the lime juice in last.  I also made sure to chop the ginger and garlic very finely.   I will definitely make this recipe again!

This recipe had a wonderful taste served over noodles.  However, the consistency was horrible. My best guess is that the lime juice curdled the coconut milk giving it a chunky consistency instead of smooth.  It was hard to eat.  I will try this recipe again after making a few changes.

This recipe has all the right ingredients, but in the wrong proportion! When I made this, it turned out with a really strange texture and tasted way too much like peanut butter. Then I started reading the reviews which I should have done to begin with! I was able to salvage the recipe by following everyone's advice which was to use more coconut milk, and add more of all the other ingredients. I also added 3 table spoons of brown sugar to sweeten it up a little. If you are willing to do some trial and error to find the right mix of ingredients to fit your taste, then this is a good recipe. If you don't have the patients, then find a different one! Good luck!!

I ended up using this recipe for a stirfry and added a bit more lime juice. I just prefer a more acidic taste. wow!! yuuuuuuuummmmy!!  loved it!  i love that it is vegan and if you can find gluten free soy sauce, it can be gluten free. Oh!! did i forget to mention that i omitted the fish sauce? that is why mine was vegan!

Ready in 15 minutes? I stirred the stuff for longer than 15 minutes, trying to make it blend.
1 & 1/2 cups of peanut butter? You gotta be kidding.

Changes: used 1/2 c. crunchy PB, no cream, full can of coconut milk, and didn't quite have enough lime juice (maybe 2 tbl)Only used 1/2 of sauce for dinner for 2, and warmed up on stove with a little cornstarch to thicken.  Cooked up some chicken and rice noodles. Next time probably wouldn't add quite as much hot sauce. I really liked the flavor, but my sweetie said it could of been a little sweeter.

This was great ! I did reduce the amount of peanut butter to 3/4 cup and subsituted soy sauce for the fish oil but added Hoison sauce instead of hot sause. I put this over wide egg noodles.
I'm going to use it as a dipping sauce next......

Super easy.  I mixed all of the ingredients in a sauce pan over low to medium heat stirring continuously until it was hot and smoothy texture.   I served to steamed broccoli and brown rice.  This was really easy

Strangely enough, this is extremely delicious with pasta, especially long flat ones like fettuccine or linguini. I add the whole can of coconut milk for good measure. I add a tsp of sesame oil, my opinion, it brings out more flavor. Delish recipe and highly recommended!

great - get the flavors melded faster by making it in a saucepan over low heat.  start with just some of the peanut butter warmed enough to soften the garlic and ginger. add more peanut butter - then incorporate some coconut milk. I subbed rice vinegar for lime... skipped for lack of, the fish sauce hot sauce.  you can control how much you make this way too.

This recipe definitely served the craving for peanut sauce! Love the ginger flavor.  It is lacking the hot spice that takes the edge off the overwhelming peanut taste. I added a bit of dried chili peppers and it was just what I wanted out of it. I changed up the amounts of peanut butter and coconut milk a bit from reading other reviews and was glad I did.

I used this recipe to make a tofu stir-fry and a chicken stir-fry, but we did not enjoy it at all. The sauce is extremely thick and has a strong peanut butter flavor to it.

Awesome and easy - I used this for the first time for my husband's birthday party buffet with chicken skewers and everyone was blown away! Now i use it for other dishes like rice, pasta, stir fry, and chicken. It lasts for a long time in the fridge too and is great to use with any kind of boring leftovers.

*Update* to my *Update* I made this again recently and while I was making it realized I'd done something, well.. odd.  I had doubled every ingredient except the PB. So, yeah, I've got to re-star this, and I'm sorry to do so.  But double everything else but the PB and you may find a BIG keeper in your recipe box. Old review follows: This recipe is a fantastic jumping-off point. I prefer chili paste to what "I" consider hot sauce (to us, that's Tabasco) so I used chili paste (sriracha would work well also). Mine was thick - good for a dipping sauce, but I thinned it out a bit with extra coconut milk to serve over rice noodles & leftover baked chicken. Oh, and chopped some peanuts in the food processor for the top. Just fantastic. I will ALWAYS keep coconut milk on hand now.  AND my picky/Irish traditional husband loved it. One tip on using fresh ginger - toss it into a freezer bag and freeze it before grating, it goes much easier.

A bit thick for my liking, so I added water to thin it out. Also, I personally think it could use more spice, so I added more hot sauce.

Delicious!  But I did make a few changes: A added a little cumin and turmeric, and was very happy with the results of that.  I also heated it in a saucepan while mixing the ingredients in.  This softened the peanut butter, which was otherwise way to sticky, and made it much easer to blend everything together smoothly. 

I used this peanut sauce as a sauce for a chicken stir-fry, which I then put into a garlic-and-pesto tortilla along with some rice vermicelli to make a wrap.  It was wonderful!

Recipe is great and easily modified. As per the previous comments I increased the coconut milk. I also used chunky peanut butter, so I heated it up to melt. First by adding ginger and garlic to the pan to bring out the flavors then put all the other ingredients in.I used additional soy sauce instead of fish sauce (vegetarian), squirt of lemon juice (for lime juice) to taste and it turned out wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the basics for this recipe and was completely amazed at how much flavor came from these ingredients! I altered some of the ratios (about 1/2 the peanut butter and 2x the coconut milk that it called for) and I left out the fish sauce because I didn't have it. It was PERFECT for the thai stir fry I made. I always assumed the peanut sauces that you find in a jar were really complex, but I will NEVER buy another one after I tried this. It whips up faster than the stir fry! And that's saying something...

It was ok, but for the price of making you can get better.  It was kind of bland.  I had to quadruple the amount of hot sauce AND add hot oil as well to even feel the heat a little bit.  Every peanut sauce I have ever had was spicy, so I felt this was an important thing.  It's a good base, but you do have to tweak it.

This was a good starting off point but I had to doctor it up to taste, hence the 4 star rating. Because so many people complained that all they tasted was peanut butter I doubled everything except the peanut butter but I didn't like it at all! I couldn't taste the peanut butter at all, all I could taste was salty soy sauce (and I used the low sodium stuff too!). So I just kept adding in peanut butter until it was how I liked and I used a full can of coconut milk. I also added in quite a bit of sweet hoisin sauce because I used natural peanut butter which isn't sweetened and I wanted some sweet in there. Lastly I added a dash of sesame oil and for the hot sauce I used "chile garlic sauce" that you find in the asian section of the grocery store and it's thick and chunky and HOT! I used this to dress a side dish/salad for a summer party that had soba noodles, cabbage, carrots, red bell pepper and green onion and then I garnished with the cilantro. VERY yummy!

This is 5 star with the change of using a whole can of coconut milk, with no water.  I haven't tried it using the recipe amount, but I think that there would be too much peanut butter.  It is better not cooking it, because the oil separates from the peanut butter.  Great recipe with complex flavors!

My husband & I both did not care for this.  It was way too thick & too much peanut butter taste.  I tried a lean cusisine with a peanut sauce that was better than this.  I don't think I'll be trying any version of this again.

A most excellent recipe! It really needs the whole tablespoon of tabasco (if not more) for the extra kick. I use lite coconut milk and crunchy peanut butter.  I also use more cilantro than it calls for. This is quite thick. You just need to add more water (or coconut milk) to thin it.

I love the ingredients! I had to improvise with quantity and with what ingredients I had on hand. I used a couple tablespoons of regular milk and added a couple tablespoons of shredded coconut instead of coconut milk and used cayenne pepper instead of hot sauceI only had dried cilantro and I always opt for crunchy peanut butter. I had to omit the fish oil and it was still great! I mix in shredded chicken and top a pizza crust with it or put the mixture in wonton wrappers and fry them up. Dip in thai style chili sauce or duck sauce!

I've used this recipe many times and it is wonderful.  I do a chicken satay and once the peanut sauce is combined, I portion out about 1/2 a cup of it and brush the chicken with it on the grill to infuse some of that wonderful flavor during the cooking process.  The key to the thickness is a little bit of heating.  Pop the sauce in the microwave and heat for about 10 seconds to get a thinner consistency.  You can use chunky peanut butter also.  I served this with Sesame Noodles also on this site. This is the best Thai peanut sauce because you can adjust many of the flavors in this recipe to taste without ruining it.  It makes a lot of sauce so either plan a party with a satay platter or be prepared to refridgerate the unused portion.

This peanut sauce is far too thick as written. I added a LOT more coconut milk and then had to adjust all of the other ingredients accordingly. I'm freezing some of this sauce for another family, so decided to add the cilantro later rather than mixing it in to keep it fresh-tasting. Servicable flavor, unfortunate texture, sorry. Thanks for letting me try it!

Way too much peanut butter. Next time I will leave out about half a cup if not more and add half a cup more coconut milk.

Great recipe! It makes alot of sauce - so I would recommend freezing part of it.  I put the sauce over sauted chicken tenders, onions and green peppers and served it over jasmine rice. I can't wait to try it over rice noodles!

I made this sauce exactly as the recipe stated, and used it as a coating for flat lo-mein noodles.

Its a decent sauce, but the flavors don't combine very well. The taste of peanut butter is very strong, before being replaced by the lime juice/cilantro.

Also, the sauce would benefit from some texture - some crushed peanuts would be the obvious choice. A more authentic Thai sauce would use only crushed peanuts and forego the peanut butter, anyway.

If I were to make this again, I'd use much less peanut butter, add some finely-crushed peanuts, and perhaps add even a little more water.

I made this the day before to accompany Chicken Satay. The extra time gave this sauce a chance to come together flavourwise. The cilantro added about an hour before serving is important to the fresh taste. Very good. Thanks for the recipe.

This was an excellent sauce, but it really makes a lot! I ended up with more sauce than I needed for a lot of noodles. Next time I'll make it smaller or use more noodles for leftovers. I tossed the sauce with sauteed fresh veggies like onions and peppers. The hot sauce you use makes a difference too. I used Dave's Insanity Sauce, and this was so spicy! So be aware of the hot sauce you use and how much, if you don't like it spicy!

This recipe was great. I changed it up quite a bit, starting with melting down peanuts instead of using peanut butter, because that attempt was too sweet. I also added a lot of kick to it. But, this recipe gave a great base to figure out how to make my own sauce. Thank you!

One of the best peanut sauces I have made!  I recommend doing it all in a food processor... start with your garlic and ginger (I also added a couple of green onions) and then add the rest of the ingredients.  At the suggestion of others I also added the lime juice at the last minute to prevent curdling and also recuded the peanut butter (I used 1 cup and 1 heaping spoonful).  I also increased the coconut milk... probably used 3/4 cup (about half a can).  The second time I made this with low fat PB and reduced fat coconut milk and it was equally delicious.  Finally, I added a couple of spponfuls of sugar because I like mine a little sweeter.

I thought this peanut sauce was as good as any I have had at Thai restaurants.   It made quite a lot so I halved the recipe ,  and had enough for dipping sauce for Summer Rolls,  and then used it to coat Pad Thai noodles and chicken . Delicious.  Will make some this week-end!

This is so sickingly awesome!! I used chunky peanut butter and didn't have coconut water, the nuts give a nice texture. I had leftover ingredients from a pho soup I ordered take out, so I added this sauce to the rice noodles and other fixins ( cilantro, sprouts, shrimp, chicken, jalapeño, lime, green onion) sliced a little carrot, and made a phenomenal stir fry!

With a few modifications this recipe was excellent. I heated my skillet on simmer. Just enough heat to blend. 

I lowered the amount of (no stir, crunchy) peanut butter to a little less than a cup. 
Omitted the water competely & doubled the coconut milk (I used Savoy coconut cream).
Used sirarcha as the hot sauce.
And added just under a tablespoon of sesame oil per other reviews.
Also used just under a teaspoon of powdered garlic & ginger.

It was amazing right off the stove luke warm.  Sure to be even better after the flavors meld overnight. Perfect consistency to dip SPRING ROLLS!

This is a good sauce..recipe is easy to follow and everyone at my house who "dipped" chicken liked it.
I think the reviews need to be written with more sensitivity...if you don't like say so but no need to rant about it as the person did on Feb. 23, 2009. That was a nasty review and should not have been allowed to be posted!

I think there's an error on the peanut butter measurements.  Perhaps, it should be 1/2 cup rather than 1 & 1/2?

this would be a no star if it was offered. Someone earlier mentioned melted peanut butter and that is seriously all it is. Very very nasty. Curdles. Clumps. Is not smooth and all you taste is way way too much peanut butter. Will never fix again.

The best!!!  I use fish sauce instead of soy, or vice versa, depending on what I have in pantry.  Used on pasta and rice noodles, with scallions, mmmmm!!!

This sauce is waaay too peanuty -- even after I increased the coconut milk to 1 cup.  Next time around, I'm cutting the peanut butter down to 1 cup, keeping the coconut milk at 1 cup, and adding a few tablespoon of oil (maybe seasame oil).

WAAAAAY too much peanut butter.  I used a whole can of coconut milk (13.5 oz) because it was too thick, and it was still too thick.  Didn't have much flavor, just tasted like peanut butter.  Wasn't spicy, wasn't sweet, just peanut butter.

Excellent recipe -- great for fondue, noodles, satay, even a dip for steamed veggies!    We like things spicy in our house -- I doubled the ginger, garlic and cilatnro.   Also added 1/4 cup vinegar.   Delicious!

An AMAZING recipe - I was skeptical at first, but this "no-cook" recipe lured me in and it was so worth it!   I actually had several modifications though. I had a smaller group (3) for dinner, so i used 1/2 cup PB, 1/4 cup coconut mil,, no fish sauce, because I didnt' have it, no hot sauce because I don't handle heat well, and I did add rice vinegar, 3TB, and some crushed peanuts. The rice vinegar and lime really give it that sour kick, while the coconut adds the sweet balance.    I poured this over 2 dishes I made - one was a chicken dish with red peppers, the other veggies with tofu. I got many compliments from my dinner party and husband and I really can't believe  how simple it was! Took me no time. A definite crowd pleaser!

Really liked it.  I think using all natural peanut butter works well.  It takes out the generic taste, unnecessary sugars and salt.  I have also used raw almond butter which seems to be healthier, but it is expensive.

Thank you Stephanie!  This is out of this world.  Didn't change a thing.  Served it with "Thai Chicken Satay" from this site.  Slathered the cooked satay with this sauce and sprinkled with chopped peanuts. Placed a small bowl of additional sauce on each plate for dipping. Oh my, so good!  Also served "Asian Coconut Rice" and "Barbequed Pineapple", both from this site.  Wonderful meal.  Can't wait to make it again for visiting relatives this summer. Don't know what I would do without All Recipes!

this was just not for me.  too peanut buttery, not enough sweet & spicy flavor for me.  i ended up adding 3x the coconut milk, 1/4 c. sugar, and 1/2 c. sweet thai chili sauce, in additon to 2 full T. grated ginger and no water.  then it was delicious!!

This recipe was fabulous!  I accidentally put in three times the amount of ginger but it's still delightful anyway.    Next time I think I would add more coconut milk as mine turned out very very thick and I'd like something that would be a little more saucy.  But taste . . . peanut heaven.

I made this exactly as written and it was not like any peanut sauce I've had.  It tasted like eating pure peanut butter!  Maybe it should have sat longer to blend but it was just way too thick.  I see others have commented on cutting back on the peanut butter and maybe that would have helped.

This sauce is fantastic! I had coconut milk left over so I tried this recipe out in order to use it up and it is now going to be a consistent meal. I did use one cup peanut butter and one cup coconut milk and it tasted delicious. Much better than any peanut sauce you can buy at the store. Thanks for the recipe!

The best thai peanut sauce I've tasted in or out of a restaurant. The recipe is very forgiving, too.  I had to alter a couple of things because I didn't have them. I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy, omitted the fish sauce, and soaked 1/4 cup shredded sweetened coconut in skim milk in place of the cocnut milk.  I also added some sugar.  I will be making this constantly now; Thank You!

I used the whole amount of peanut butter which was too much. It made it too thick. 1/2 cup would be plenty. I also threw in 2 teaspoons of curry powder. The flavor was amazing. It was the hit of the faculty room

very good!  I give 4 stars instead of 5 b/c I don't have a lot of experience with peanut sauces so I'm not sure this is actually "the best".  But it was darned good!  I used one full can of coconut milk and about a cup of peanut butter.  I'd suggest starting with 1/2 the can of coconut milk and going from there, my sauce was quite liquidy. The taste was great though. I served this over the "Thai Tuna Burgers" by Dakota Kelly, over Jasmine rice with the cilantro on the side.  Very good combination with the tuna burgers and rice! My husband's eyes lit up when he tasted all this together.

After going to a Thai restaurant, I fell in love with the chicken and peanut sauce. I wanted an easy recipe and something I could follow. I really loved this recipe once I tweaked it a bit. Following what everyone else said in the reviews, I added more coconut milk and only a cup of peanut butter to make it thinner.  I also used powdered instead of minced and took out the cilantro and fish sauce.  I liked it a lot! It really tastes just like the sauce in the restaurant.

Not quite totally authentic but extremely yummy. I used lite coconut milk and substituted it for water. Added it to a beef and spinach stir-fry, served over asian noodles, for a very satisfying dish. Would be a very good dipping sauce as well, for chicken for example.

Very good!  I cut the recipe in 1/3 to only make enough for use on the Chicken Satay Pizza recipe.  It was great!  I, too, lacked some ingredients - I used chili powder and cayenne instead of hot sauce, extra soy and lime because of no fish sauce.  No fresh ginger, so I used extra powdered, but I think it would be much better with fresh!  Mine came out a little too peanutty (I used old-fashioned peanut butter). I would start with a little less peanut butter next time to get the flavor right for peanut sauce - a little more soy and lime to peanut ratio.  I used light coconut milk and perhaps regular would have added more flavor, but I didn't really notice that adding anything.  I also added a little onion and honey, because mine seemed to lack something, and the sweetness helped.  This was fantastic on the Chicken Satay Pizza recipe on this site - spread on flatbread and topped with chicken, cilantro, green onion, grated carrot and roasted red pepper, then topped with a little cheese to hold it all together.  Yum!!

The peanut butter taste is a little over whelming. I feel like this sauce is lacking something...but I just can't put my finger on it. 
I did add a couple tablespoons of sugar b/c I guess I like a sweeter peanut sauce.

This was very good.  I did take the advice of the other reviewers and reduce the peanut butter to 1 cup.  I used natural peanut butter for a more authentically peanut flavour.  I made this with Indonesian Satay, which was good.  The leftover dip was excellent for dipping raw vegetables.

What a wonderful mingle of flavors; more complex than most peanut sauces I've tasted (and I judge Thai restaurants by their peanut sauce).  It was a little too thick, so thinned it out with extra coconut milk; maybe next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I'll use a little less peanut butter.

This is so good. I used more coconut milk and added some sesame oil - may not be authentic but tasted great!

OH this is delicious! Very, very easy to make, and it even keeps in the fridge for a week. I might use just a touch less PB tho.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe - many of the same reasons others noted.  The peanut butter flavor was overwhelming, and the sauce was too thick (I added more coconut milk and water, which helped).  I left off the cilantro (as others said they did), because I don't think true Thai peanut sauce has it (at least not in the restaurants I go to).  I halved the recipe and it still made PLENTY - served it with "Chicken Satay," also from this site.  I think I'll keep looking for another Thai peanut sauce recipe though.

Thanks so much! This recipe was fantastic and my fiance loved it. I didn't cut the recipe in half, but instead I used some of it to cook chicken in (and added more water and coconut milk to it), some to dip Vietnamese spring rolls, and some to freeze for future use. Though I don't like spicy foods, the amount of hot sauce used was perfect to give it just a kick but not make it spicy.

The flavor on this is great!  We loved it.  I made it and added to a beef stir-fry at the last minute just to heat through, and then served more sauce drizzled over.  As others commented -- it makes A LOT.  I could have cut the recipe in half and had much more than plenty for my husband and I.  I froze it though, and figure we will have delicious peanut sauce whenever we want!  Great recipe.

I liked it, but found that the peanut butter was too dominant. My boyfriend loved the Indonesian Satay (from this site), but hardly dipped into the peanut sauce at all. I halved the recipe, and it was still far, FAR TOO MUCH. Next time I think I will halve the recipe (which then asks for 3/4 c. peanut butter), and then reduce the peanut butter to 1/2 cup and increase the lime juice for an extra sparkly, light flavor.

I made this for dipping for the Indonesian Satay (in this website). It was delicious and EASY!!! I did have to cut the recipe in half. As suggested, I waited until the last minute to add the lime. The texture and flavor were great! Thanks!

I did love this recipe, once I tweaked it. Luckily, it is easy to tweak! As written, the peanut butter is a bit too strong. I increased the coconut milk and lime juice. It is very tasty. The possible uses are many. I tossed it with rice noodles.

Added about 1/4 cup coconut sugar to it and used half the peanut butter suggested. Tastes exactly like the peanut sauce at Thai restaurants.

This is my favorite peanut sauce.  I like it even better than what you get in a restaurant.  I saute the ginger and garlic before mixing with the rest of the ingredients.  I also use low fat coconut milk.   The whole family loves it.

Great Peanut Sauce, 

I added 3 tablespoons of Honey
1 tablespoon of Hoisin
and omitted the cilantro

To make it taste like what you get in a restaurant. We made it for a stir fry and it was amazing, added it to the wok 2 minutes before the veggies were done and it was perfect. Thanks!

I followed this receipt exactly how it was written and then added it to a fried tofu Thai dish I made. My guinea pig (boyfriend), who has traveled extensively in Thailand, said it was the best peanut sauce he's had stateside. Oh, and it's even better the next day!

Served this as a dipping sauce for grilled shrimp, and we thought it was delicious.  After I took the photo, I did thin out a bit with more coconut milk.  Used TJ's light coconut milk, and did increase the hot sauce a bit to suit our taste, otherwise, followed the recipe.

The TRICK to this amazing sauce is letting it SIT FOR A FEW HOURS-it makes a world of a difference! I also added more hot sauce (cause I like spicy food), a little more coconut milk (made it less thick). The cilantro is a MUST..I blended it in with the rest of ingredients ( not just before serving) which gave it an amazing tangy taste. I marinaded chicken tenders with this sauce, put them on wooden skewers and grilled them, then added more sauce at the end...my family was begging for more ;-)

I will make this again but cut peanut-butter down to maybe 3/4 cups. I know it's a peanut-butter sauce but it t was way too peanut-buttery. I added the whole can of coconut milk in the end but it didn't help matters.

Oh my God...I made this sauce for a rice, chicken, and scallops dish for my fiance for supper.  It was the best flavor I have ever had save for a few select sauces my honey and I came up with together.  You are amazing and I am grateful forever to you for this amazing recipe!!!

I thought it was "ok".  I would add palm sugar next time.  Perhaps a little bit of shrimp paste.  I had it with satay chicken over noodles.  Sprinkled the cilantro over the noodles.

i love the sauce as is and added my twist to suit our taste.  i did not have fish sauce so i used shrimp sauce.  i like cilantro, so i used the stalks and cut them into bits for that punch of taste and texture. finally, i added lime skin, grated for that punch of lime.  microwave for a minute and i was ready to go.

This was an excellent peanut sauce!  I also followed many people's advice and scaled way back on the amount of peanut butter (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup).  Also used crunchy peanut butter to add some texture and authenticity to the mix.  I like mine a little bit spicier so I also added cayenne pepper and a bit more than the recommended hot sauce.  Also, combined this with Spicy Grilled Shrimp (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Spicy-Grilled-Shrimp/Detail.aspx) and some rice noodles.  Made for an excellent dish!!

Super thick if made as written. Reduce the amount of peanut butter! Nothing like the peanut sauce at my favorite Thai rest. It just tasted to much like regular peanut butter with a little bit of spice to it. Maybe if i reduced the peanut butter by 1/2 i would have been able to taste the other ingredients. Probably wont make this version again.

I will make this sauce again, I did however add dark brown sugar and next time I will not add as much ginger. I really like ginger but feel like it was really strong in this dish. This sauce is really good with thai egg rolls.

This was so good, but I did have to adjust since it was so thick. I didn't have any problems with it seperating and we used it over the next week. My family loves it! Thanks for sharing.

Terrific! I have made this a few times and play with the amount of coconut milk depending on how loose I want the sauce.  My favorite things to dip in it are chicken satay and shrimp skewers.  YUMMM!

I have NEVER experienced Thai foods ever.  But took it upon myself to make it at home.  This recipe was super easy and I followed the Ingredients/directions perfectly.  Next time I may reduce the peanut butter by a 1/4 cup or so. I stirfried it into some pad thai noodles, steamed carrots, and broccoli and served it as a side dish to allrecipes "Chicken Satay".

This is very good but love a good heat so instead of the hot sauce I added 3 tsp of Sambal Oleke and 3 tbsp of Garlic Chilli sauce as well as 1 tsp of Red Curry Paste as well as doubling the garlic and adding 2 long green onions chopped fine.

Fabulously easy recipe.  I am slightly allergic to peanuts, so I used cashew butter instead & it was delicious.  Made a great dipping sauce for shrimp & chicken tempura.

Quick and easy.  I didn't have all the ingredients (missing coconut milk, cilantro and ginger).  I put 1 tbsp of Diana sauce and it was a great kick to the sauce!  Thanks for the easy recipe!

The soya sauce and fish sauce amounts overwhelmed the peanut flavours to create an intensely salty sauce. I strongly recommend reducing the amounts of both.

The 2 stars are because I made it as it was written and  I agree with the person who said it was too thick and peanut buttery without much taste  of the other ingredients. I blended it all in the food processor which didn't really smooth it out.  I added more coconut milk - 11 oz total -(because that was the size of the carton of full fat coconut milk I was using. )  I added another Tablespoon of lime juice (because I had that amount left from my lime.)  I also added more water to make a smoother and more saucy consistency.  Then it tasted pretty good before refrigerating to blend flavors.  I would eat it like that, but I think it can still be improved upon.   I would make this again with those adjustments and try  adding in another clove of garlic, an extra teaspoon of ginger and maybe a bit more hot sauce and see what that does for it.  As it was, with the added ingredients, it was a lot of sauce, and it would be a great amount for a party.  It could be that it will also need more fish sauce and soy sauce (I used tamari,) too.  But, it was a good place to start as someone else said, and easy to play around with.

It's too thick, as the recipe is written.  I doubled the lime juice, which doesn't hurt the flavor a bit, and added a little more coconut milk until the texture came out right.  Also, I used crunchy peanut butter, because why not?  After those tweaks (which were really pretty low-level, for me anyway), it came out totally delicious.  It makes a lovely low-carb meal spooned liberally over steamed cauliflower.  Don't skip the fish sauce.  Seriously.  It's readily available at Asian markets and most big supermarkets.

I cut down a little on the lime and upped the hot sauce a bit.  A few mins on the stove helped it all blend nicely.

I followed the advise and used less peanut butter. I started with whole can of coconut milk and added 1/2 cup of peanut butter, mixed, tasted and added another 1/2. I omitted cilantro (not a fan) but added dill. All in all its ok. I will omit fish sauce next time - weird aftertaste. I really don't see the point in the fish sauce as an ingredient. Also, will cut everything in half next time - too much final product.
Also, I serve the sauce warmed up, tastes better.

I made this recipe, using some of the comments from other reviewers,  and thought it was amazing. DEFINITELY halve the peanut butter (3/4 cup was perfect imo) and I toned down the garlic (1 clove grated was enough)  for those who hate the aftertaste (my wife, ahem).   This was the first time I had added coconut milk and it was such a great suggestion ~ it adds a fun but subtle twist.  For those who like a spicier sauce, jack up the hot sauce ratio a bit!   Once this is done sitting, i'm going to toss it with some noodles - the consistency is perfect for it.

The basic idea of this recipe is very good.  I recommend  thinning it out with either more lime juice, coconut milk, and water and/or lessen the amount of peanut butter.

This is a great basic recipe. I made some minor tweaks, but that's what's so good about this recipe. I started out with the amount of peanut butter I wanted to use and adapted the remaining ingredients to that amount.  I used a small amount of black bean & garlic paste in place of the fish sauce. Excellent.
Thank you

Well impressed with this - caution re: soy sauce - use lowest sodium available... as I used a low sodium, but still found it a tad 'salty' but this is going into my standards dip wise - and creams nicely for jar storage... #delish

Pretty easy and tasty- we like with more PB crushed peanuts on the final salad. Plus used coconut oil instead and some water to thin it out.

It was ok. I should have read the reviews before I made it. It came out WAY too thick at first and the peanut butter overpowered everything. I had to add more coconut milk, more ginger, more soy sauce, and I threw in some sesame  oil for good measure. The Silver Palate has a cold sesame noodles recipe with peanut butter and chicken and asparagus that is really good, and I think that was the flavor I was looking for when I made this.

The sauce is a bit thick, and I think there is a bit too much peanut butter for my taste. Next time I'll cut back the PB and bump up the lime. Good guide, though, because I had no idea how to make peanut sauce.

I made this exactly as directed and planned to use it on Thai rice noodles with sauteed chicken breast, carrots, and scallions.  When I tasted it, it pretty much had no other flavor except the peanut butter, and it was entirely too thick.  I added olive oil, a lot more lime juice, more cilantro, and probably another tbsp or 2 of soy sauce.  It was much better in terms of consistency and flavor, but still not smooth as I had initially expected.  Next time I'd probably use much less peanut butter and a lot more coconut milk which I can't taste at all.  And a lot more hot sauce or red pepper flakes.

Hi! Thanks for this quick and easy recipe! I used a mortar and pestle and made much less by guesstimating the ratio, starting with 2 Tbsp peanut butter (cooking for one), left out the fish sauce since I didn't have any, subbed lemon for lime, and parsley for cilantro, but it still came out great! I served it over sauteed tofu.

Love this sauce!  Used 1/2 TBSP red curry instead of hot sauce and served with "Thai-Style Grilled Pork Tenderloin" from this website.  We devoured it!

This was horrible and a waste of a lot of expensive peanut butter.  The end product was way too thick and tasted like .....really thin peanut butter.  Guess I should have read the reviews first.

This came out way too thick and way too salty. Needs low salt soy sauce and less fish sauce and WAY more ginger, coconut milk and hot sauce....and maybe a touch of lime juice. All in all rather a bad recipe.

So I tried this recipe and even printed off one of the reviews with massive changes and tried that too.  Even after all the changes I was disappointed.  I let it sit overnight and tried it again the next day, and it was still disappointing.  Still searching for a good peanut sauce recipe.

I followed this recipe to the drop and it is way too salty and there is no peanut flavor at all. Not only that, it is so thick, you can't call it sauce anymore.
Maybe I was supposed to -not- use organic ingredients? Not trying this again.

The recipe sounds great.  I used unsweetened coconut milk instead of water. I also found that I about doubled the amount of water (coconut milk) to thin out the sauce. I also used natural crunchy peanut butter from Trader Joe's. I doubled the amount of chili paste and sugar too. I also added sauce to taste. It was so yummy that I could drink it. Thanks for the base recipe!

The peanut butter completely drowns out the flavor of all of the other ingredients. Next time I'm going to try putting only 1/2 cup of peanut butter and taste and adjust.

Good recipe. I tried a couple different things. First, I doubled the recipe, so that it uses a whole jar of peanut butter (no messy measuring), plus it keeps pretty well in the refrigerator. Secondly, I added 4x the hot sauce (Frank's redhot is the best choice) because thai peanut sauce is supposed to have a decent little kick! Also, I added about 1/4 cup of sugar. All of the Thai peanut sauce dishes that I have ever tried in Thai restaurants have always had just a touch of sweetness to it. Thanks for the great recipe!

I think the recipe is just fine as written. You need all the peanut butter to bring out the peanut flavor of the PEANUT sauce. 

What I will tell you is you have to prepare this a day or two ahead of time, as it is MUCH better after having a few days to combine. 

Now all I can think about is what else can I make with this sauce.

I made this exactly as written to serve over pad thai noodles. It was deplorable. We couldn't eat more than a couple of bites between us and ended up calling for a pizza instead. Far too thick and  much like eating melted peanut butter.

So this tastes amazing, but only after some tweeking. I doubled the recipe, but only used 1 cup of peanut butter. Honestly, I cannot imagine if I'd added the two other cups. It would be overpowering. I didn't have fish sauce, so I substituted rice vinegar which worked beautifully. It definitely needed some acidity, even with the lime juice. Other than that, it really does taste great. But DO NOT add the full amount of peanut butter!

This is an excellent recipe. I make the sauce for Vietnamese spring rolls and it is great! I have also had it over stir fry and it is very good. If it is too thick just add more coconut milk or even water.

I loved this sauce.  I used it with Thai Lettuce Chicken Wraps.  Delish.  My only change was to add 2 tsp of sugar.  Probably missing because I used all natural almond butter which has no added sugar itself. I will definitely make it again.

I made a half recipe of this along with the Indonesian chicken satay for a dinner party with three girlfriends.  It was so good we ended up dipping shrimp, asparagus and bread in it too!  It's the perfect mix of sweet and spicy.  I used reduced fat crunchy PB, lite coconut milk and left out the cilantro.
