My Nana made these every year and entire family loves them!!! She gave me the recipe a few years ago and now I make them too. All of my friends and coworkers ask me to make these during the holidays. I cannot tell you how yummy these are.. you NEED to make them! One thing I have changed is to just make them into balls because shaping them into crescents is a huge pain in the... and it takes WAY too long.

I let them rise much longer, so they would be big.  Delicious!

I accidentally used regular white sugar instead of confectioners, but they turned out well.  They had a texture very similar to pecan sandies.  I took them to the in-laws for Christmas, and it reminded them of a recipe from their childhood.  Great, inexpensive recipe.

This was delicious! I used pecans instead of walnuts, and they are just about gone!
