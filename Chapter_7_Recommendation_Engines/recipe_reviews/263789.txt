Good sugar cookies; not overly sweet, and definitely soft. They are more of a cakey style cookie. I did add a 1/2 tsp of salt to the dough and didn't use a full 2/3 cup of sprinkles (I didn't  have enough). The dough was kind of sticky to work with, so I refrigerated it for about 20-30 minutes and that helped quite a bit. I also used a medium cookie scoop and got 30 cookies--next time I will use a smaller scoop as the cookies were kind of big. Make sure to really flatten them too, as they puff a lot in the oven. The sprinkles also kind of "ran" in the dough, so it was weird color, but still tastes good. I also need several tablespoons of heavy cream in the frosting to get a spreadable consistency.

used irish butter, and green sprinkles (1/2  the amt.) came out great, used soy creamer in the frosting to make it creamy, didnt have heavy cream, the butter made the taste so it didnt matter. called them irish birthday cookies, still soft and delicious almost a week later, cooked for 12 min. as they were a little big, 31 cookies.
