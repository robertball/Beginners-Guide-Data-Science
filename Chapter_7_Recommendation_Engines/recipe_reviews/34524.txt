I used a smoked ham so really only had to heat it through and not 'cook' it so I put it in for 2 hours. I skipped the cloves because I didn't have any. The ham turned out moist and tender with a hint of swweetness. Very simple to do.

I loved this recipe and would have given it 5 stars, but my daughter thought it was a bit sweet, which frankly is never a problem for me.  I used an already cooked turkey ham and it worked out great.

This recipe is too easy and totally delicious.  I used a pre-cooked ham so I added the juices from the bottom of the package.

I used my Nesco 18 quart cooker to make a whole ham leg [21 lbs]. I put the ham on the rack, added enough water to cover the bottom, and used a mustard glaze instead of the brown sugar one. It smelled heavenly while it was cooking and when done, was so good!!! The ham wasn't dry or overcooked, just wonderful!!! Thank you for the recipe!

Used this for my Easter ham, and it was delicious! I got rave reviews all around. After I packed on the brown sugar, I then drizzled a little bit of honey over it and it was fabulous, but I skipped the cloves. Thanks!

I had such a hard time finding a 'raw' ham joint! Every store had ready-smoked hams... Anyway, I tracked one down in the end! This is a very tasty, very traditional, very easy recipe, and it looked beautiful. I used half water, half orange juice, and basted it a little every 15 minutes or so. Delicious! (and the cold left-overs are just as good!) Thanks, KK!

I made a mixture of brown mustard and apricot preserves to coat the ham first. I then packed on the brown sugar. I'm not quite sure what kind of ham this really called for, so I just used what I normally buy. It wasn't a fresh ham, maybe smoked. At any rate, I needed to carve off all of the fat before beginning. I too used a mix of OJ and water and replenished as it cooked away. The liquid made a very nice gravy and the whole meal was delicious. Thanks KK!

This is how my mother did it all my childhood and how I have passed it down to the kids. With the exception, we don't add water. We use a turkey baster and suck out the fat, put into our cast iron skillet and make Ham gravy out of it. Most people say Ham gravy? But everyone becomes a fan after eating their ham with ham gravy. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Ham gravy over your mashed potatoes and meat. Yum!

We made this recipe yesterday for Christmas dinner and it turned out a beautiful, moist, scrumptious ham. We used a fully cooked 11 lb half ham from Rayley's, with cloves, light and dark brown supar, on a rack over one inch of water, fresh orange juice and pinapple juice. We baked it in a turkey roaster with lid on at 350 degrees for 2.5 hrs. and it was a perfect 160 degrees on our quick read thermometer. We, along with our guests absolutely loved it to the point that there were only about one pound of leftovers. Interesting note: the cooking directions on the ham wrapper said to bake it dry uncovered. Sure glad we didn't do that....!

I have made many versions of ham over the 40+ years of cooking. This is the best by far. I was asked, by several previous guests, to make it again for Christmas dinner. I was perusing the reviews to see if I could add anything above what has already been said. The only thing that I can say is that this recipe produced the best main course dinner that I have ever made. Thank you Auntie KK.

So easy and so delicious! I opted for the pre-cooked spiral ham and followed the direction for heating.  I also opted out of the cloves.  This had a very nice sweetness and was ready in no time at all! Perfect for a holiday meal!

This was a super easy recipe.  I used a precooked 8 pound ham, and I used the cloves sparingly.  I cooked it for 2 hours (according the package directions on my ham), and it was great.  This is a keeper for me.

I guess I'm in the minority on this one.  My ham turned out really good, I just really couldn't taste any of the brown sugar.  I was expecting the ham to have a sweet taste but it didn't.  I skipped out on the cloves since my family doesn't like them.  Thanks for sharing though.

I thought this was pretty good.  I used ground clove since I didnt have whole and I only had dark brwn sugar.  I also added a little bit of Oj to the water mixture.  Delicious!

My first ham, and it was delicious!  Cooked for 5 hours covered and it practically fell apart when cutting, super juicy, and had that good crunchy outside...it was very good!  Cant wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!

Just made this ham for Easter 2011 and it was wonderful. We got a half-ham bone-in (NOT spiral cut as the picture shows) at 11.65 pounds. I scored the top and sides and studded with cloves, packed on the brown sugar crust, stuck pineapple slices all over the top with toothpicks and put cherries in the middle of the pineapple slices for that retro look -- it was so pretty! The cloves really made this ham and next time I will take the extra time to stud the entire ham, underside and all. I ended up using another 1/2 cup brown sugar as well. The cooking time is dead-on. I have a convection oven which can perfectly cook a 25 pound turkey in under three hours (oven has its own meat thermometer built in so I know the second it reaches the right temp). I assumed it would make quick work of an 11.6 pound ham. WRONG. The ham is more dense so I should have considered it would take longer. At four hours it was around 150 degrees. Dinner was already an hour and a half delayed so I just decided that since the ham is fully-cooked when you buy it, it's really only a warming issue. The ham was nicely done -- heated through -- clear to the core despite being under 160. It was moist and tender too. Like others, I added orange but also pineapple juice to water in the bottom of the pan. I made parmesan scalloped potatoes to go with it from my recipes site but added onion to mine. This dinner was a huge hit -- got raves about the ham. We'll probably make this again next Easter.

I have made this recipe twice recently for my husband and myself...we're newlyweds and I had never cooked a ham before! We loved it both times! The first time it came out a little dry, so i just cooked it less and added more water for the second time, and it turned out great!

My grandma and mom add a little flour and butter to the brown sugar coating (premixed together).  This is supposed to help make the brown sugar stick to the ham a little better and forms a crust. I haven't tried it but thought I would add to this. LOVE this kind of ham!!

We love this ham. I have made it several times. I use a smaller ham so I cook it for a shorter amount of time and I don't measure the ingredients, I just pour them on and it turns out very yummy each time.

I'm not known for being a cook (unless heating up frozen dinners and preparing trader joe's bagged stirfry is cooking), and I've never in my life baked a ham, but I got tagged for Thanksgiving dinner with less than a day's notice and tried this recipe.

I followed it exactly, and the ham was amazing; no one could believe it, least of all me!  A friend of mine, who is an excellent cook and who makes holiday meals every year, said it was the best ham she'd ever tasted.

Great recipe and easy, too.  What a great New Years Day ham.  I used Spiced AppleCider and OJ (1/2 & 1/2 mix) instead of water.  It really added another level of flavor.  I also used maple syrup to help hold the sugar stick to the ham.  I think honey may work better.  I used a digital remote thermometer and it took the guess work out of the cooking time.  They are only around $20. and worth it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this for Christmas dinner.  My husband is stuffed to the gills... still has like 8 pounds of ham in the fridge and wants to know when I can make this again.  He says it is the best ham he has ever had.

I got RAVE reviews on this ham.  I had a 10 lb. uncooked ham and trimmed the fat off and other than that, I followed the directions to the T!  I cooked it for 4 1/2 hours and the smell was just wonderful!  I thought that with all that sugar on it that it was going to be too sweet, but it was perfect!  My son was still eating it when I was trying to clean up!  That is AMAZING to see him do that!  I will be making this again FOR SURE!  It's super easy and everyone loved it.  Thanks!!!

This was my first attempt at raw ham.  It was GREAT!  The flavor was unbelievable and it was so moist.  I used coke instead of water and no cloves.  I can't wait to make this again!

It was great, but I used a probe temp. gauge on the grille using the Recommended temp. to 140 degrees.  Since it was already cooked once why not.  It was juicy and very tender.

This was THE BEST HAM I have ever made.  My family RAVED about it being sooooo moist.  The key is definitely the water and the foil tent.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  Merry Christmas!!!

VERY EASY!!  I doubled the brown sugar and added about 3 Tbsp of dry mustard to it.  since most of the sugar fell off into the drippings/water it wasn't too sweet.  i saved the drippings and made soup stock from it - it was amazing!!

I followed the recipe to a tee, but I think I didn't put enough brown sugar and I also think it would have been even better if I had basted it periodically.  Either that or I cooked it too long.  I used a precooked ham about 10 1/2 lbs and warmed for 2 1/2 hrs...probably should have taken it out at 2 hours, but it was still excellent!

We aren't really big on cloves at my house, so I left them out and just moistened the sugar and rubbed it in, then covered with foil. I haven't had ham like that since my Greandmother made it! What a great recipe!

This was my very first fresh baked ham and I have been cooking for 20 years! I loved the simplicity of this recipe, as I don't like too many flavors getting in the way of the flavor of the ham. My whole family enjoyed this recipe very much and I would make it again. I made a few changes, partly out of necessity. I did not have enough whole cloves so I mixed a scant 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves in with the brown sugar and the kids and I pressed the mixture all over the ham. I then baked it as instructed, but did not cover till later as my lid wouldn't fit over the ham. I later used foil as it started to brown too much. I think next time I will cover first then uncover to brown at the end. 
It made a lovely sauce that I served over boiled potatoes. Thanks for a good recipe!

And with this recipe, I have evoked the much-anticipated favorable comparison to mom's cooking. I did add a maple syrup glaze to it for the last 30 minutes of uncovered cooking. The outside was nicely browned, and the inside was falling off the bone. There are not enough stars for this ham.

Because I didn't have any pineapples or cherries for my Easter ham, I tried this recipe instead.  The combined flavors of the cloves and brown sugar came through perfectly and it was so moist!  The family loved it!

This was one of the best ham recipes I have ever made.  My husband claims it's better than his mothers!  The house smelled incredible all day too!  I don't think I'll ever need to search for another ham recipe again.

Did this for thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit.  Some guests said it was the best ham that they have ever had.  Made it the way the recipe said but put pineapple slices on and poured the pineapple juice into the liquid.

I'm happy that someone else likes a simple ham.  This is the fastest most elegent dinner you can make.If I have company then I put the pineapple rings with the cherries in the middle on top of the ham. As far as the people that didn't like cloves....You don't eat them, you take them all off before cutting the ham.  Remember to score your ham not dice like my sister-in-law did), but score the top before you put your brown sugar on any extras you want.
has anyone has made ham gravy? I haven't found anyone yet, but, love it when they try it at my house. It's a sweet gravy, but, delicious.
Take the ham out of the pan and keep the drippings on the bottom of the pan (if you added some water before cooking you'll have more gravy).  Don't salt or pepper since a lot of hams can be very salty.  Make your ROUX (flour and water mixture), and start adding it to your drippings until you get the consistency that you want.  If it's still to salty then add more water (little at a time).  I always add a little more brown sugar until I get the taste that I want (my sister adds the pineapple juce instead of the water...like I said it's a sweet gravy (I was raised on this gravy).  Let your family or company add their own s&p as they want.  If you like raisins, I put raisins in it in the begining so they cook and puff up.  Please try it, remember you don't have to serve it since you didn't purchase any thing extra to make it. You might surprise yourself and your family (& company).

I had 2 hams so I pulled out the Rival Electric Roaster and tented aluminum foil tightly under the lid.  It was very moist and the brown sugar gave it a slightly sweet flavor.  Did not use cloves, not our favorite.  Brushed with honey mustard to help keep the brown sugar on it, but there wasn't any left once it was cooking.  I've never been ablt to get a "crust" on my hams. Pulled it our at 140 degrees.

This ham is excellent.  It falls off the bone it is so tender!  I don't even like ham but my husband gets one from work for Christmas every year so I have to cook it.  I recieved so many compliments, saying that it is the best ham they've ever had. This recipe is a keeper.  The only thing I changed was that I used the Splenda brown sugar mix and it worked great. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe and use it all the time.  The only thing I do extra is add pineapple rings on top of the ham and cut down on the water (2 cups or so).  Very flavourful!

I made the recipe for our Easter dinner and it turned out great! My family raved about how moist the ham was and it was super delicious! I added some brown sugar to the water on the bottom! I will make this ham again soon!

My first try at baking a ham.  I had a spiral cut ham so the cloves didn't stay in, but I used ground cloves in the water.  I should have basted it a little more while it was cooking, but it was still great!

The halved this recipe because I had a small ham.  My kids love when we use whole cloves so they can "stud" the ham!  Great flavor and will be good for leftovers!

When I saw the price of almost $5 for a small package of pre-cut ham, I said no way.

I bought a 6 poud half ham for $9 and change, had the butcher cut it in half for me to roast both halves in less time. I plan on giving the other half to the neighbor.

Recipe was great, but I added a dash of powdered cloves to the sugar with warm water and honey. I also added a few pineapple rings to the top. 

A bit sweet only because I cut out all pastries, soda pop and candy.

Good base recipe. I changed it up just to make it extra special for Easter dinner today (it would have been great as is) & it was wonderful! I used a smoked butt portion with 7Up as suggested by others.  I basted a few times & drizzled pure maple syrup for the last 20 mins. It was so-o-o good my 12 year old couldn't stop eating it & he is very picky. Thanks for sharing.

A tip that may work for some of you:  Cut the ham in a cross-hatch pattern; rub the brown sugar deep into the slits; add your cloves if desired.  Sometimes I add pineapple slices to the top and pour a bit of the juice slowly over the top to help work the brown sugar down. Just use a tiny bit and pour slowly. I pour about 1/3 to 1/2 the juice from the canned pineapple into the bottom (instead of water). I normally use a 5lb fully cooked boneless ham, but you can increase the amount of juice/pineapple to fit your ham. Even with the water this method produces a delicious ham, and letting the slices mingle with the juices for a bit makes it even better.

I made a ham for our pajama party. Put some whole cloves on it. Cooked it for 1 hour. Went out , came back and cooked it for another 1/2 hour and it was raved about. That was all I did and it was so moist. Couldn't believe nothing was on it.

Usually I agree with the majority of reviewers but this was not at all what I expected. I made it exactly as it called for and it tasted no different to me then throwing the ham straight into the oven without the cloves and sugar. The sugar melted off the ham almost instantly and the cloves didn't add hardly any flavor. It made the house smell great but taste wise, it was as plain as can be. Maybe it was something on my end (or maybe next time I need to increase the sugar.)

Delicious!  I had planned to use the slow cooker, but our ham was too big, so in a bind, I found this and gave it a shot.  The only thing I didn't do was use whole clove because we didn't have any-just ground cloves.  But it was super moist and really good.

Very good and very easy! I skipped the cloves as my family doesn't care for them. The ham was very moist and delicious!

It was very juicy, but a little bland. I didn't taste the cloves at all. The juices did make an excellent gravy though.

I made this today for Easter. The cloves were a surprise hit with my company. I used a prebaked ham, and it was only 3-1/2 pounds, so only needed 1-1/2 hours in the oven. Adding the juice from the bag plus water to 1/2 inch and covering it tightly with foil made a moist ham. Thanks for the recipe!
