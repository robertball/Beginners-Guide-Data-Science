Great recipe! I added about 1/4 cup extra buttermilk since other reviews had complained that the muffins were dry, and they turned out perfect. 

The only problem I had was that this recipe made waaaaaay more than I expected. It said they made 42 servings, but I got about double that!! That's okay - I just froze half of them, so I can take them out and pop them in the microwave in the future!

I used 1-1/4C low-fat sour cream instead of the buttermilk. Came out quite tasty and moist. CAUTION: this recipe says it makes 42 servings, that's about 3 muffins per serving. I have 120 mini muffins!! They freeze well, so it's not a big problem. But we'll be eating muffins for awhile.

These were great, i also used frozen. I would add maybe more liquid cause they were somewhat dry. Even so they were very delicious

I decided to make these full size muffins and it came out to be about 3 dozen. They were a bit dry compared to other recipes.

These were great. I baked them for 10 minutes in mini muffin tins and they were moist and not overly sweet. A new favorite!

I made this following the recipe and they turned out great for my daughters preschool snack.  Not dry.  I used frozen wild blueberrys from Trader Joes and I spooned the flour into the measuring cup.  I also didn't mix too much b/c with muffins they will toughen up.  I will be making these again.

As previous reviewer noted, yield is off; I halved the recipe (used 2 eggs) and made exactly 42 minis.  I didn't find them dry particularly.  They were good.

I tried to make half of the recipe. Well that didn't work out too well considering I ended up with 48 mini muffins!  I read how a few people thought the recipe was kind of dry so I added 3eggs instead of 2 1/2eggs and added 3/4 cup extra buttermilk. Still kind of dry for my taste. I'll try the sour cream next time :)

Delicious. Added more buttermilk because the batter seemed a little too thick. The muffins were very moist and not too sweet. Came out great overall; thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I used about 1 1/3 cups of buttermilk per recommendations of others.  Makes a ton of muffins!

I cut this back to "21" servings which made the recipe a little tricky. I used whole wheat white flour, cut the sugar back to a scant half cup and because I was a little too groggy this morning to use two and a half eggs, I used three full eggs. That turned out to be a blessing anyhow because a lot of the reviewers complained that the muffins turned out dry so the extra "liquid" is needed. I got almost three pans of mini muffins out of this recipe that even with the extra half egg turned out a little dry. The flavor is great--it just needs a little more milk. A little drizzle of Yogurt Lemon Glaze will fix that.

I make these about once a week. I sprinkle a little bit of streusel on top before baking, and they disappear!  My whole family loves them. Mini, regular, or big, the muffins are a HIT!

I had the recipe calculated to 12 and baked the muffins in a Nordic  12 cup Sweetheart Rose pan.The recipe for 12 filled the cups perfectly for a full muffin. (About 3/4) I did increase the baking time until they started to brown. The muffins are moist,delicious and beautiful.

My 3 year old loves "mini" anything.  I buy him store bought mini muffins (I won't mention the brand).  He loves them but I always feel guilty when I give them to him because they are full of sugar and tons of preservatives.  I made these for him and he loves them!

I thought these muffins were good.  My kids didn't like them but they are picky. I also cut this recipe by 1/3 and added 1/4 C applesauce since other reviewers said theirs were dry. I still got 28 mini muffins and they turned out great.

My first attempt at making "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" into mini muffins failed. I needed blueberry mini muffins quick, so I made these exact to the recipe. I thought that they were too dry & dense for muffins, and not that great. On the positive side they did look just like they were supposed to, which was important because I was taking them for refreshments at a church function. Although I am not a fan, the kids and even some adults gobbled them up. So, I suppose they do work well for refreshment/pot luck type situations. Unless requested, I will not be making these again. "To Die for Blueberry Muffins" definitely deserve another attempt at becoming mini.

I just made these and they are very yummy!  The batter is very thick and that worried me, but they came out great The recipe also makes a TON of muffins, which is nice.
