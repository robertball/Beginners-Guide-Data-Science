Excellent recipe.  A keeper! I substituted cannned peas for frozen ones and the tomato sauce with a can of diced tomatoes.  I added 4 tbsp chili powder and more garlic.  Because I cooked the pork in the micro-wave I didn't add the olive oil.

I had a jar of red peppers in tomato sauce that I used instead of the red pepper and can of tomato sauce.  My dish turned out a little dry as I didn't have "enough" tomato sauce.  Hubby loved this dish.  (Didn't add the nutmeg either as I wasn't sure I had any and too lazy to look! LOL)

Did not have any peas, so I used frozen corn instead.  I added some Oregeno and Cheyenne Pepper.   It was very easy and tasted great.

3 1/2 stars.  Husband thought there was 'too much going on' in the chili, but I liked that there were a lot of vegetables.  I added a lot of the spices because without them, I don't think there would have been a lot of flavor.

Great buffet dish-not overly spicy and hearty enough to hold you over.

Very Different type of Chili. It was alright - will probably make a spicier chili-like chili next time.

Great new version of chili. Sometimes I opt for lean ground turkey in place of other ground meats. I also use black beans for a nice change.

I made this chili for my parents and they both loved it! I added a little salt and pepper to the pork while I was browning it and added some fresh broccoli florets from the garden in place of the wax beans. (forgot to add them to the shopping list) I used about  1 T of chili powder, 1 t of marjoram, and 1/2 t of nutmeg. I didn't make a spicy chili but you can always add more chili powder to your liking. I will definitely make this chili again!

What’s great about this recipe is that it’s so easy to adapt with what ever ingredients you have on hand. I found it when I decided to use a pound of ground pork that I had. I had to substitute a couple of things. No wax beans but I had green beans. Frozen corn had to do for the canned peas. I only had a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, so I opened a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes to make up the difference. I even tossed in a can of drained black beans and a little water. After cooking for 45 minutes, I put it in bowls, topped it with diced onions, shredded cheese and sour cream. Yum

Chili should never be made with this protein.
