This recipe was better than my favorite standard apple crisp, which was hard to beat!  I added cranberries and raisins, and tossed the apples in a tbsp of lemon juice, added the cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping that others suggested, and used blueberry flavoured maple syrup and it was amazing!  The crunchy topping was such a delightful change from regular crisp recipes.  Thank you!

Very easy recipe to throw together. I didn't have the 2/3 cup of maple syrup called for in the recipe, I used what I had (just enough to drizzle over the top of the apples) and it wasn't too sweet, just right. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon over the top of the apples before adding the crust. My family loved it. A+++

Make this recipe one evening to take to work the next day.  I doubled it and put it in a 9x13 pan.  The only change I made to the recipe is the addition of a dash of both cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping (just enough to taste a hint of each).  
Warmed it in the microwave (uncovered) when I got it to work, and the topping was amazingly still crunchy and crisp like it had come right out of the oven.  Everyone loved it - it all went really quickly.  
Great recipe in the autumn when you have lots of apples to use up!

After reading all of the reviews with the changes that were made, I still decided to make this exactly as written. After baking it (and eating it) I found this recipe needed no changes, no "tweaking." The amount of topping was just right, it was not too runny (if you bake it long enough and allow the juices to thicken as it cools), had the perfect level of sweetness, and needed no spices. It's a good, basic apple crisp. Still, it was somewhat disappointing in that I had high hopes for a more prominent maple flavor and it just wasn't there, even though I used the stronger Grade B maple syrup. So while this was very good, it doesn't really set itself apart from other apple crisp recipes.

Using other recommendations and tweaking:  Sliced apples and put into 8x8 pan and added 1 cup frozen blueberries.  Tossed all with 1 tbs flour, 1 tbs cornstarch and 3 tbs lemon juice.  Sprinkled top with nutmeg and cinnamon.  Let sit.  Topped with 1/2 cup maple syrup and 2x amount of topping.  Bake for about 40-45 min.  Nice and bubbly, not soupy at all.  Thanks!

This was so simple to prepare and so delicious.  I brought it to a dinner party and there was none left.  I used a combination of grany smith and macintosh apples.  I might add some raisins next time too!

Really good pie in a cold evening! I used chopped almonds instead of rolled oats. Also I sprinkled apples with fresh lemon juice and used slightly less sugar, so the pie was not too sweet. I made it for my friends and there were no leftovers! Thanks for the recipe, Helene.

Wow, was this great!! I was wondering what I would do with all of these apples....
I added some nutmeg and cinnamon, and sprinkled in some raisins, the second time that I made it and it turned out even better!! Great over ice cream....

Already made this twice and doubled the recipe both times using a 9x13 pan.  Used only approx 3/4 c. of pure maple syrup for a doubled recipe.  Mixed apples with cinnamon and nutmeg and 2T. of flour.  Sliced apples right in pan and mixed altogether with syrup, spices and flour.  Also doubled topping but cut back on butter, used only about 1 1/2 sticks (12T.) and mixed as for pie crust in my food processor, then added the b. sugar and rolled oats (the only kind I use at home) along with more cinnamon, nutmeg and a little salt.  Baked for 40 minutes at 375 F.  Used Empire and Cortland Apples.  Thank you, to all those good cooks out there, I read the reviews before I made this and it turned out Wonderful!

This is a delicious recipe. The maple syrup adds such wonderful flavor. I added 2 tablesppons of flour to the maple syrup to keep in from being watery and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the crumb topping. Will never make traditional apple crisp again!

I've made this several times and it has become one of our favorite treats. Yesterday, when I made this, I didn't have oats on hand so I used 1/2 cup of corn flake crumbs instead. Both my wife and I thought the corn flake crumbs were even better that the oats! I also have cut down on the syrup to 1/2 cup and there is plenty to cover all the apples.  Before I put the syurp onto the apples, I sprinkeled cinnamon and nutmeg on the apples. I highly recommend the cinnamon. I can't imagine anyone not liking this!

This is an excellent recipe!  Very easy with minimal ingredients. Goodies that you always have on hand.  My sister makes syrup every year and this is just fabulour with fresh Canadian Maple Syrup. Dont use Aunt Jemima, it just isnt the same! I also added cinnamon, it is a must in Apple Crisp! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! It is my new fave!

This recipe tasted pretty good... I just have a few issues with it... first of it is not a pie... I think it would make a great crumb pie but for that to happen it needs a crust and to be put in a pie pan... second... next time I think I will add a tablespoon flour with the apples to help thicken them... also a tad of cinnamon, nutmeg, or nuts wouldn't hurt.... but the spices may take away from the maple flavor... but I think a few nuts would be a great addition.... the crumb topping is very good though and this recipe is a very good crisp...

Good stuff. I used less sugar and sugar free syrup so it wouldn't be so sweet. I also tried it with the skin on since it is much healthier but it makes it way to chewy. Not sure what I will do next time...but it was good!

What a delicious autumn treat! I came home from apple picking with so many apples and had to pick an easy dish to make  before they all went bad! I, too, reduced the maple syrup to 1/2 cup and used a whole cup of oats. I also substituted a portion of the butter with cinnamon applesauce and baked it an extra 5 minutes. I'll definitely make this again.

This is a delicious version of apple crisp. I used a 9x13 baking dish. Before I put the apples in the dish, I put them in a bowl and stirred in the maple syrup as well as 1 tspn cinnamon and 2 tbsp flour to make sure they were evenly coated. Followed recipe otherwise. Served with vanilla ice cream. Definetly a keeper.

I tried this recipe for the first time and found it too sweet but loved the crumbly top.  I used Aunt Jemima and the full amount called for...next time I'll try using less, adding lemon juice to the apples and maybe some raisins/cranberries as others have suggested.

WOW. WOW. WOW!!!
I had a bunch of Fuji apples (not exactly the ideal apple for baking) but this was out of this world. I didn't quite use as much maple syrup and I used imitation,  so my bad... I can't say I noticed maple syrup flavor :P my kids LOVED this, the crumble was like a yummy oatmeal cookie!  I WILL definitely make this again.

This is, in one word, excellent!  My apple crumble recipe calls for a pie crust and since I'm trying to cut down a bit on fat and carbs, this was a better choice than my standby.  I was skeptical just piling apples in a pan without a crust, but this turned out so yummy!  A hit with three out of four family members, the fourth only not liking it because she doesn't like her apples baked!  LOL  Thanks for a definite do-again recipe!!

This was good, but it was kind of like clumps of oatmeal cookies on applies. I probably won't make it again, but a good way to use some apples.

This is a good apple crisp...except I didn't have enough topping to cover the apples completely, so some got tough.  Next time I would increase the oats and flour to 1 cup each and keep everything else the same.  I used whole-wheat pastry flour, and it worked out well.  I used only 1/2 cup pure maple syrup and it was plenty!  Very sweet.  Used a combo of Gala and Fuji apples.  I had to bake it an extra 20 minutes before my apples became tender enough.

We thought this was great!  I had bought 40# of apples last year and peeled, cored & sliced them, freezing them ziplock baggies for pie. With all those apples, I think I've made every apple pie out there and this (a crisp, actually, and not a genuine pie) was the biggest hit, yet by far the easiest. I did add cinnamon and nutmeg as others have suggested and I cut down on the maple syrup to 1/2 cup.  Thanks Helene!

Very good flavor; I made with real maple syrup,
and added cinnamon and freshly ground nutmeg to the topping.  Had to bake a lot longer to get the
apples done.  Used Granny Smith apples and they were very tart, so the whole 2/3 c. of syrup was
fine.

This is a great apple crumble. Not too sweet which I like. I used pure grade B maple syrup. I use ambrosia apples which hold their shape and are a little tart. There is a depth of flavour in this that other crumbles do not have, so I think that comes from the maple syrup. If you want more of a maple flavor, I would suggest to incorporate some maple into the crumble topping. Perhaps use maple butter or maple sugar. I will make this again! EDIT: After it sat a day it took on way more flavour and was absolutely delish with some maple walnut ice cream! Let it sit a day and you will not be disappointed!

I just made a small serving of this and yum yum yum soo good and smells amazing!! I did add flour and cinnamon when stirring apples as well as adding cinnamon to the topping. You also need like double the topping to really get it all covered. So with those small changes I will definitely make a full pan of this again!!

Great recipe. You don't need a lot of ingredients and it is relatively quick. I used a combo of museli and quick oats, which i think added to the texture. I also added raisins, crasins, nutmeg and cinnamon. We ate it with vanilla ice cream and gingersnap cookies, which really complimented it well. Next time i may try adding ginger.

This was quick, easy, and very tasty!  I doubled the recipe in a 9x13 and sprinkled cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg over the apples before adding the topping.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  Served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  Everyone had seconds!  I'd love to try it with cranberries along with the apples next time.  Definitely a keeper.

This was just soooo good! I've never made any kind of apple dessert on my own before, and this is definitely going to be my go-to from now on.

I decided to toss my apple slices in a mixture of 1 tbsp. flour, 1 tbsp. brown sugar, and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Also, I used some very tart and crisp Courtland apples that blended perfectly with the sweet syrup (I used a lite "fake" syrup). I wouldn't omit the syrup unless you are using an already sweet apple, but even then I'd suggest just using a little - the flavor is very subtle but it still adds something.

Delicious!!!!

this turned out great!   i decided to leave the skins on.... i like the taste/texture of baked apples w/ skin, so it worked for me... if you like it too, i'd recommend it, soooo much faster, plus a little healthier too. 

i also recommend adding a bit of lemon juice... keeps the apples from browning as you slice them, and contrasts nicely with the maple syrup

i only had 1/3 cup real maple syrup, for the other 1/3 i used 'fake' stuff... it was fine.  definitely include the pinch of salt too... it needs it

This recipe IS AWESOME!!!  Try it!  I followed the instructions exactly, but doubled it and made it in a 9x13 dish.  YUM YUM YUM!  I'm enjoying some with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and some whipped cream.  mmmmmmmm.

I've made this probably 15 times in the past year.  It is quick and easy.  I use apple cinnamin quaker oatmeal packets instead of rolled oats and it turns out perfectly.  I've always used granny smith apples.

My husband said, "This is good," which is high praise coming from a man of few words and fewer preferences.  I doubled the topping as recommended in other reviews (I'm glad I did, it's really tasty) and also used pure maple syrup.  I agree with other reviewers that it came out too liquidy.  I prefer a thicker sauce with the apple portion.  I really like the idea of maple flavor, though, and may adapt this with some of the thickening strategies of other apple crisp recipes.

This is good but you have to eat it right away. This is not a dessert dish to save for later. It get's very watery and looks unappetizing after being in the fridge.

So good. Everyone loved it...even my mom! The best so far I think. I used granny smith apples, and they were pretty big. Still used the amount asked for, and it came out perfect. Not too sweet or rich, just right. Thanks for this easy wonderful recipe!

Like another reviewer, I also ended up with a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pan. Next time I will mix some dried tapioca with the apples to absorb some of the moisture. Had a nice crumble though. My favorite apple crisp recipe on this site is Apple Crisp II.

As I am sitting here munching on my leftovers, I simply had to write a review!

I am no baker (not really a great cook either) and this was SO easy.

I used 4 gala apples (small-medium sized) sliced fairly thin so it would cook up quickly.  I tossed the apples in a tsp of cinnamon and a tbsp of flour then poured over the maple syrup.  

I mixed the oat/brown sugar topping with my hands (seemed like the easiest way to get everything to combine well).  I pressed it on top of the apples making sure I didn't leave any open spaces (MAKE EXTRA TOPPING IT IS SO YUMMY!)

I baked it for probably an extra 20 min or so, so that the topping was browned and crunchy.

Happy Crumbling!

I made this last night and it was WONDERFUL, I was looking for something quick but tasty to make and I came accross this as I had all the ingredients. I had this ready for the oven in about 15 min. Im not sure how much Maple Syrup I used probably not the half cup i just stopped when it looked enough. I sprinkled extra brown sugar and some cinnamon and nutmeg on top of the oaty topping.This is great on a cold evening infront of the TV and will deffinately be making it again. Would reccomend to anyone and everyone!! Thankyou so much Helene.

This was my first apple crisp ever, and the results were awesome. Made this today for someone's birthday and it was a hit. I added a few dashes of cinnamon to the batter and only used 1/2 cup of maple syrup. Awesome with ice cream!

YUMMY!
I'll definitely make this again and for company, too.
Like other reviewers, I used only 1/2 cup maple syrup and doubled the topping and put cinnamon on top.  I also used regular oat flakes, as rolled oats are hard to come by in Austria.  It was very crunchy and lovely.

What a treat!  This turned out great.  Per other suggestions, I reduced the maple syrup to 1/2 cup and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  My husband even enjoyed it and he usually does not like sweets.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good.  I have already made this for guests twice and got compliments all around.  Be sure to stir a little flour into maple syrup before you pour it over apples so it doesn't turn out runny.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely mouth-watering wonderful...the first bite was warm and literally melted in my mouth...it was sweet, but the real maple syrup I used honestly complimented the tartness of the apples so much, that I had to hold back going for thirds! I usually add things to recipes, like any cook, but decided to leave this one as it was, at least the first time...I'm glad I did, it was wonderful...I might add cinnamon the next time...

This recipe was excellent!  I served it to my roommates and boyfriend and everyone loved it.  I did as others suggested and sprinkled cinnamon over the apples and over the top of the crust.  I also replaced 30% of the flour with soy flour (because of its high protein/low carbohydrate content).  It also made the house smell DELICIOUS while baking! *****

Great flavor!  I made a couple of changes that people recommended, and this bumped it up to a 5/5.  I used honey crisp apples and lightly coated them in cinnamon as I put them in the pan, and cut maple syrup down to 1/2 cup.  Then in the topping mix I added cinnamon and a pumpkin pie spice mix (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, etc).  Took about 15-20 min longer to cook than recipe said.  There was definitely some water in the dish from the apples, so next time I might try tossing the apples in cinnamon and flour as others suggested to thicken this up.  Thank you!!

We had way more apples than expected so made a double batch.  One we did with the maple syrup and the other with the blueberry syrup. We added cinnamon and raisins and then ate it warm with vanilla ice cream.   Definitely a keeper recipe!

So yummy with vanilla ice cream.  I doubled the topping except for the sugar and it was sweet enough with a drizzle of maple syrup over the fruit.  I used black doris plums (canned) and fresh pears instead of apples.

Here in the Garden State we have so many pick-your-own apple orchards, and I'm always looking for new apple desserts to make. This is so much simpler than making a pie, and I think it's even better. I use as many types of apples as I can find for variety in taste and texture. Yum!

This dish was unexpectedly delicious!  I went to an apple fest and brought back locally grown apples to use in the recipe. What a treat! I doubled the "crumble" because that is my husband's favorite part.  Instead of using just the maple syrup, I tossed the apples in half the maple syrup, and substituted honey for the other half(again, locally made from the apple fest). I then lightly sprinkled the apples with cinnamon. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little bit of cloves to the crumble mixture. I cooked it for 35 minutes as the recipe says, but left it in as the oven cooled down for about 40 more minutes. The apples turned out perfect. Served with ice cream and coffee.  People were making yummy noises the whole way through! Thanks for the great recipe!

Would give it 5 stars except following changes: tossed 6 apples with juice of half a lemon, 2 Tbsp tapioca and 1 tsp cinnamon, grated half a fresh nutmeg into topping. The best crumble from this site so far.

Delicious!  Didn't use all the butter and it was still good.  I put limeade over the apples to keep from turning brown (I cut them first then went back later to finish). I used honey instead of maple syrup.  SO good!!!

This apple recipe is soooooooo very good. I followed the recipe exactly except that I doubled the topping. I know what you are thinking...but at our home the topping is something we all fight over. I have added this to my sweet hubbies favorite list and will be making again.

Best apple crisp I've ever made. I used Watkins cinna cream sprinkles and apple bake seasonings. After it had cooled I stirred it all up so every apple piece was coated in the oat mixture and the syrup made it all so sticky and wonderful. Loved it!

Good basic recipe.  Not too sweet.  Mine ended up with a lot of liquid - instead of being thick and gooey - which is the way I like a crumble.  This has such a very nice taste - will use this recipe again.

I've made this twice, using all different types of apples (whatever I've had on hand.) I also add a sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg etc. My two year old absolutely loves this dessert.  It's a lovely crumble~quick, simple, and foolproof.  Yum.

AWESOME!!! Easy to make. I didn't have regular maple syrup, so I used Red Raspberry Maple syrup I had in my pantry. That combined with whole cranberries, adding a little cinnamon & nutmeg in the topping really made this tasty. I did add a little cornstarch to absorb some of the liquid. I'm going to make for a baby shower I'm attending next week!!!!

It was light and crispy. Tasted great fresh out of the oven. Must add Cinnamon and nutmeg, would have added a little more maple syrup, and possibly add some pecans and use less oats. I also wish I would have made a little more of the topping in order to FULLY cover the apples.

I used real maple syrup, not the brown corn syrup stuff - and the recipe came out a watery mess. I actually had to drain the pan when it came out of the oven.

I used this as a base recipe as i dont like oats, i made my own crumble using digestive biscuits and added ground all spice to the crumble (about 1 tsp) and i part cooked the apples before then drained the juice and thickened half of it using cornflour then mixed back in with the apples so i had a nice thick sauce with the apples

Simple and sensational! I had five apples to use or they were going to go bad. I used two Grannie Smith's and three Red Delicious (which worked great in this recipe, even though they are often not good for baking). I didn't have real maple syrup, so I used Smucker's Breakfast Syrup, which is made with Splenda. I sliced the apples thin, mixed with the syrup, combined the ingredients for the topping, then spread it on top of the apples. Baked a little longer to get the topping nice and golden brown. The house smelled heavenly and my brother and I enjoyed our autumn treat after dinner with big dollups of vanilla bean ice cream. This recipe is a definite keeper!!!

Very delicious! I had some extra apples to use up and this recipe fit the bill. I used a scant amount of brown sugar since the red apples I used were VERY sweet and the maple syrup is sweet enough. Pretty snack/breakfast any day of the week. This recipe is a keeper!

This was one of those easy yet yummy desserts, I had everything on hand.  Was great warm with vanilla ice cream.  Next I make it though I will add apple pie like seasonings to it, just to give it a little more flavor.

I just took this out of the oven, and it smells wonderful!  I nibbled it a bit and it's even better.  I did cut back on the syrup, as most everyone suggested, to 1/2 a cup and added a bit of cinnamon.  I ended up using 7 smallish apples.  Everything else as done in the original recipe and I will definatly used this again!  My house smells so yummy!

I used honey instead of maple syrup and just drizzle it over the apples. Also, i added a handful of raisins and 1/8 tsp of cinnamon before the topping. Oh and i suggest u double the topping. I serve each slice with a scoop of low-fat vanilla ice cream and it's a hit! Thank you for this great recipe,Helene!

Very good and very easy.  However it was a little too sweet with all of the maple syrup.  I even cut the syrup down to a half of cup.  Would probably make again using lighter syrup.

I made this into a Apple Honey Crumble Pie instead of Apple Maple.  It turned out delicious.I might doublr the topping next time.  The topping was really good.  I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to the topping.  Will make this again.  The apples are a little watery, but good all the same.

This was soo good. This was a lot like apple crisp, but tasted a lot better thanks to the syrup. It was a little watery, but it didn't deter from the taste of anything, so I didn't mind. I only ended up using 4 big apples and baking it for a full 40 minutes.

So wonderful!  My boyfriend adores appley desserts and I was looking for a quick alternative to pie.  I love maple, too, so it looked like a winner.  By the time it was out of the oven, he had been snacking and said he wasn't hungry, but when he saw me eating it he asked for a bite.  After one bite he asked for a second, and after that, he got his own plate!  He loved it, as did my brother, father, and mother.  A total hit!  Thank you so much for this recipe, Helene.  This will be a staple dessert for us.  My mother asked for the recipe before she was even done eating hers.

Pretty good, definitely add some cinnamon.  I had to bake it longer than the recipe asked for to bake the apples.  I didn't have a problem with it being to sweet. My whole family enjoyed it.

This was amazing! I made a couple of small adjustments and will again when I definitely re-make this!
First, I added cinnamon and nutmeg as someone else suggested, (About 1/2 tsp each, I didn't measure) and about 1/3 cup of walnuts to the crumble mix. 
The end result was delicious! I used 100% Canadian Maple Syrup. A definite must.
What I will change next time? I will reduce the amount of sugar used for the crumble. I used a couple of teaspoons less than written because I read what others had written... but I love sweets! This was almost too sweet even for me. So I added milk to cut the sweet when I ate it (hot of course)

I made this with the small pie apples from an old tree in our yard and our local maple syrup. This is the best crumble I have ever eaten! I plan to try making it with some of the apple slices I am freezing to eat during our long Minnesota winter.

This was very delicious and very sweet. Of course, I might have forgotten one of the apples... but I might go a little lighter on the sugar next time. I had no brown sugar so I used white sugar. Toward the end of baking I used the broil setting to brown the top a little. I have eaten it all in 2 days...bad on me!!

Very easy to make with the kids. Tastes great. I did add cinnamon and some ground ginger.

So bomb. After cooking the apples made it a bit liquidy. I just spooned the liquid out.

We did not change any ingredients.  Granny Smith apples and dark amber maple syrup blended perfectly.  My sister gave me a pint size jug of syrup she purchased in New Hamphshire and since it was too strong for my taste on pancakes and waffles, I needed another means of using it.  This is now my favorite apple recipe.

I am fortunate to have neighbors who make great syrup! We use the darker maple syrup, which has a more intense flavor and really love this recipe! We think of it as a new addition to fall on the farm!

Great recipe! I would heat the apples in a pot before hand to get rid of excess liquid from the apple. Not too much though it will make it mushy, just heat till a little soft. After all it apple crumble not apple soup! :)

I didn't use a tart apple so I did reduce the amount of maple syrup and then also used slightly less brown sugar as well. I tossed my apples in pumpkin pie spice but otherwise I stuck to the recipe and absolutely loved it! So good!

Followed the recipe for the first try. It is easy, fast and tasty. Perfect with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.  It was a hit with the whole family. I will definitely make this again.

It's excellent and easy! I made it with half apples/ half pears.  The recipe is definitely missing cinnamon! I added 2 tsp of cinnamon and half a cup of coconut, cut the maple syrup and sugar by half. It was plenty sweet enough :)

Love this recipe. Super easy. I may cut down on the maple syrup a little next time.  I used a mix of granny smith and sweet tango apples. In addition to the maple syrup I used a little honey, imitation maple flavor and cinnamon. Mixed everything together and made the topping per the directions. I sprinkled nutmeg and cinnamon on the topping with some vanilla extract...amazing! I'd recommend doubling the topping, it's very delicious and the perfect amount of crunch.

This is hands-down the best apple crisp recipe I have ever tried. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg to the top before baking, as others recommended, and it was great! The most crisp topping of any recipe I've tried also. I would have gotten a picture but it disappeared too quickly! I highly recommend serving this a la mode.

I will try this again with some tweaking. I made it exactly to the specs of the recipe. The flavor of the crumble is decadent but the maple syrup makes it way too sweet. And, I think some spices will knock it out of the park. So...less syrup, add cinnamon and nutmeg. Also...depending on how thick you cut the apples, your cooking time may vary. I put it in the oven and set the timer to 35 minutes. I checked it at about 23 minutes and it was bubbly, brown and the apples were very tender so I pulled it out.

The crumble on top was amazing.

It was apple soup out of the pan. I thought refrigeration would solidify it but it didn't. Would adding flour to the apple/maple syrup mix help? Extremely sweet.

Made recipe exactly as written, no deviations. It was simply divine, very rich. I used Macintosh, perhaps next time I will use apples that are little less sweet. I served it right away and it was quite runny, but by the time it cooled down, it had thickened up and when reheated the next day it did not become runny again.

I made this using muesli instead as rolled oats are difficult to find in France and it turned out  fine. My advice if you use plain muesli, add a bit less as it soaks up liquid. You can also use the crunchy variety and stick to the recipe. I also use muesli in cookies (as a substitute for the oats in Dad's cookies) and as a topping mixed with cream for apple pie!

Just made this and it was excellent, my husband especially likes it! Ours did come out a little 'watery' but that is only because the apples were so stinkin juicy. It was still so good for being watery. Going back for seconds now!

I would make this in a larger pan, my apples made this soggy, so a larger pan would help. I think nuts would also add to this receipe. All around this receipe is great when your short on time.

Perfection! I did add raisins, but other than that and cinnamon to the topping followed the recipe. We served it with vanilla ice cream to son's new girlfriend and fmaily and everyone loved it!

This was a good tasting recipe, but it was VERY watery, even after adding 3 heaping tablespoons of flour, above what the recipe called for.  I think I may increase the flour an additional 1/4-1/2 cup to absorb the liquid.

It was really good, my family ate it all up and wanted more.  I'll have to make some more soon.  Next time I would add cinnamon.  I was suprised the recipe didn't call for it.  It came out with liquid and I had to spill it out, and then I put it back in the oven.

A great fall treat! My housemates all loved it. I made this in a gluten-free variety substituing special gluten-free steel cut oats instead of oatmeal. Along with dashes of allspice and cinnamon. mmmmmm!

I just took this to our voting district this morning, and we all had a party.  Everyone agreed that this was delicious!  I don't love the taste of maple, except on pancakes, but the maple syrup taste didn't come through to me.  Thanks so much for an easy, yummy recipe!

I also had a watery mess in the bottom of my pan.  Perhaps too many apples?  I used 7 small ones becuase I didn't have any large apples hanging around...

I was pleasantly suprised with this recipe.  It had a very good flavor, and I am not a big fan of maple syrup.  I didn't use the full amount, and I used Light syrup, but it was very good.  Do not use Light Margarine however!! The topping does not turn out correctly! My cooking style is "trial and error"!

This is an exceptionally simple yet delicious apple crumble.  I made it last weekend and already have had requests for the recipe.  The only modifications I made was I added raisins and cranberries, cinnamon and allspice and served it with a dollop of whipped cream.  Absolutely lovely!  This one is a keeper.

I LOVE this crumble/pie and now serve it every Thanksgiving and Christmas (at my family's request). I also added about 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. The maple syrup and oats are what make this recipe truly unique, and we like ours with heavy whipping cream or cool whip.

This is a very yummy apple crumble! I will make it next time with a bit less maple sirup considering it was a bit too sweet for my taste. The crumble was great even the next day!

My boyfriend is super picky about anything he eats but we both agree this was the holy grale of apple crumble. By far the best desert and so easy to make. Like many others i also added a pinch of cinniman and nutmeg to the topping mixture and it really added to the flavour. We served it with vanilla ice-cream and it was perfect!

FABULOUS! i made this as a dessert for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. i cut back on the syrup to reduce the sweetness a bit, after reading the ratings from other people, and i also used the syrup made with splenda to cut back on calories and it was still fantastic.

Probably the best apple crisp type recipe yet.  The maple syrup is definitely better than sugar, and I added cinnamon.  I'll keep this one in my recipe book.

I followed others' advice and reduced the maple syrup to 1/2 cup.  Mmm-mmm-good!  I served it with vanilla ice cream.  My dad suggested trying it with a graham cracker crumble, too.

Yum!  My husband had seconds.  I doubled everything and made it in a 9x13in pan.  I added 1/4c lemon juice, a tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  I used the cuisinart to slice the apples - so easy.

one word - EXCELLENT! my bro-in-law is usually quite fussy when it comes to food but even he couldnt resist going for 2nd-3rd helpings! i followed the advice of cutting down on the maple syrup, tossing the apples in lemon and adding cinnamon. i also substituted flour with rolled oats. got plenty of compliments, so thanks heaps helene for sharing this recipe!

This is SOOOOO easy, takes about 10 minutes to prepare and I made it with sugar-free maple syrup to cut down on the sugar! :)

Excellent!  I used 3 Granny Smith Apples and 2 Golden Delicious.  The combination was perfect.  The guests begged to take the left overs.  Thanks for this easy recipe!

Good but a little watery.  I am not sure if its because I used Aunt Jemima syrup or if I used too many apples. * I made this with already sliced baking apples.  Very sweet and went great with vanilla ice cream.

This is a very good apple crisp. The maple syrup adds a nice touch. It is very sweet, but there was not a single complaint from this sweet loving group! This one will be made again. Thanks, Helene!

This was so good, we fought over the leftovers. I used lite maple syrup, and added cinnamon and nutmeg. It made the whole house smell good as it cooked and we loved the results. Very easy to put together.

My husband and son liked this better than I did, although I thought it was OK.  I followed other reviewers suggestions about cutting the maple syrup in half.  Apparently the apples I used were very tart so I could have used the full amount of syrup to sweeten it up. I will try this one again.

I used table syrup, added 1 tbsp lemon juice, about 1/2 cup of raisins (which I sprinkled over the apples under the topping), and cinnamon and nutmeg were added to the oat mixture (all as suggested by reviewers). With these changes the recipe was great though not so "maply" (I didn't have real syrup); just a nice tender apple crisp.  It baked up fine in 35 minutes though my oven tends to be faster than most.
