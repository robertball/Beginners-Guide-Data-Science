This was quite runny for a salad. I had to drain off a lot of liquid. Also it was very sweet--more like a dessert.

Cut down on the water when boiling. I omitted saffron bc I didn't have it. But I loved it. Didn't taste the turmeric much.

This is tasty! It's sweet, but then the black pepper adds a nice counter. I don't know if it turned out the way it should have for a salad, but it is a yummy side however you look at it. I used the full amount of water. It was runny after cooking, but it thickened as it cooled. I tried it hot, warm, and cool, and liked it at all temps. I didn't have saffron so I added an extra smidge of turmeric.
