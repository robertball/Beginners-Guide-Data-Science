I love this salad. My company loved this salad. The only thing i did differently was not to juice the mandarin oranges. I used canned mandarins and purreed them in my hand chopper. Tasted delicious in the salad. Also added 1 tsp of honey to the dressing. Great flavour combo's in this salad.

This salad was good, but it didn't taste like I thought it would. I made 3 changes. 1. I added salt & pepper to the dressing to give it a bit more flavor. 2. I also used canned mandarin oranges instead of nectarines. 
3. Instead of 1/2 a lemon, I used the juice of a whole lemon. All of the tastes together was very interesting. I paired it with a very spicy chicken dish I prepared. It was a nice cool salad paired with a spicy dish. I will probably make again.

This was great!  I didn't exactly follow directions, though.  I used romano lettuce, fetta cheese, walnuts, tomatoes and avacado just thrown together with this dressing.  The dressing was fabulous, and it can be used with any salad, as I proved with my random concoction. :)

Everyone loved this salad!  I used feta instead of blue cheese and people raved!  The dressing was great but I would use one orange instead of two.  The lemony flavor of it is what makes it so good.  Great combination of flavors though, nuts in salad are always great!

I brought this to a big pot-luck dinner party, and everyone was talking about it. They all wanted to know who made the salad. Everyone agreed that it was a really unique combination, but that all the flavors really worked well together.

The perfect salad to accompany a dinner for guests. I added more avocado than indicated, but that's my preference.  Also, I candied the walnuts.  Perfect!

This received raves when I served... I was very surprised how well the tangerine juice mixed with the Olive Oil.  I juiced a number of tangerines to make this and found a lot of dressing leftover - not sure why.  Anyhow, this will be used again.

One of the best salads I've had.  I don't often finish the first course, but this salad was the exception.  I made a few changes though.  I was more in the mood for feta so that's what I used, cut in decent size bits.  I used toasted pecan pieces, not walnuts.  I slighly increased the lemon juice, lemon zest, and olive oil for the dressing and slightly increased the pecans, apple, avocado and cheese; also added salt and pepper which it needed.  I think with this salad, more and bolder is better.  With that said, I will make this dish over and over again, it's fabulous, great flavors and textures.  My guests went back for more and I had to remind them that there was a main course.  A big hit indeed.

This was an excellent salad.  I wasn't able to find fresh mandarin oranges, so I just pureed 1/2 of a small can of drained ones.  Worked great and my company loved it!

It's delicious.  The blend of fruits, cheese, garlic, and onions seemed a little unorthodox at first, but I quickly changed my mind.  All the citrus smells so good while you are preparing it.  It is very filling, as well as an exciting dish.

This dressing is delicious!  I escpecially liked that it didn't have sugar or vinegar in it, which most dressings do.  The salad is good as well (really like pears in this salad subbed for the apples) but will use the dressing again and again on various kinds of salads.

I used less lettuce and more apple and I candied pecans by toasting them with brown sugar and bourbon.  I found the dressing rather sweet.  Strangely, the blue cheese was completely drowned out by it.  If I make it again I won't use any onion as I found it clashed with the rest of the flavours.

Delicious salad.  Served it for friends and it was well received.  The dressing was a bit bland as per the recipe, so I made the following additions:  1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil (a little goes a long way), 1 teaspoon honey, 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar.  This gave the dressing a complexity that matched well with the apples and avocados.  Will make again!

I marinated all of the ingredients (except the avocado and greens) in a container for several hours before mixing the ingredients together. I also used a variety of apples. Delicious!

I used a whole lemon then added a splash of white wine vinegar.  Used canned mandarins and blended then strained.  Tossed in carrots and some red peppers.

I've made this twice now and it is absolutely fabulous!  I put the blue cheese and dressing on the side so people can add as much as they like and toss the avocado/apples with the lemon zest before tossing with the lettuce to prevent browning.  The dressing is perhaps the best part of this, so fresh but not overly sweet...but as a warning the garlic really comes out by the second day.

At first glance, I thought the combination of ingredients seemed a bit odd.  But let me tell you, my husband and I just had this salad for dinner tonight and we LOVED it!  The tangerine dressing is absolutely delicious, light, and refreshing.  I used clementine juice instead of the mandarine oranges but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee.  Hubby thought craisins would be good in the salad too and I agree.  This is one salad I would proudly serve to family and friends.  Excellent recipe!!

Such a delightful little salad bursting with citrus flavour!! I used feta and pecans because they were handy. I followed another reviewer's tip and toasted the nuts (about 1/4 cup-I scaled down for a smaller crowd) w brown sugar (about 1 T) and grand marnier (1 T) at 200 for 15 mins. I used a Gala apple which is probably the only thing I would change. For the dressing, I used a large can of mandarin oranges, drained & juiced in my food processor. I included the pulp. Hubs raved.

I think the dressing would have been just as good, and less fattening, had I omitted the oil and added extra mandarin juice. This was such a sweet refreshing salad.

I hosted a bbq for my college graduation and this salad was the hit of the party. Everyone wanted the recipe. I would never think to use some of these ingredients together but it was truly delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I loved this salad!  So refreshing and light.  I used regular oranges and added a bit of orange zest to the dressing.  I also sweetened it just a tad with a little artificial sweetener.  Threw the dressing ingredients into my food processor and emulsified nicely.  I loved the crunch of the walnuts that I toasted, with the saltiness of the cheese, and the sweetness of the dressing.  Made for a very pretty presentation as well.

Wow. That dressing was amazing. Like others, I used drained mandarin oranges from a can (20 oz) and even so, it was to die for. I never woudl have thought of a salad like this. Thanks so much. Just beautiful! And easy!

The tangerine dressing was a refreshing change from the normal vinegar/lemon/oil combos I come across. As with all salads that ask for fresh red onion it had a "bit" here and there but Ill definitely make it again! I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese and so I used feta and thought it tasted great.

This was good. I thought it might be too sweet with the orange, but the blue cheese balanced it out. I used shallot instead of onion; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I used a Fuji apple, but I think a tart Granny Smith would be even better. This would also be good with spinach.

Excellent! Very light and refreshing salad. I used fresh squeezed clementines, doubled the amount of lemon juice and added a little bit of honey to the dressing. I also added a very small amount of smart balance butter to the walnuts and 1 tsp of brown sugar while toasting. Served with Key West Chicken from this site. I will definitely make this again!

This was very good.  I used about half a can of mandarin oranges (and 1/2 the juice) and blended them in my magic bullet.  I also omitted the cheese.  I will definitely use this again.

Delish! I used OJ instead of juicing mandarins, and I threw the mandarins right into the salad. Very easy and very tasty! I'll do this again soon!

ONE OF THE BEST SALADS I'VE MADE.

YOU MAY WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR TO THE SALAD DRESSING--DEPENDING ON THE "SWEETNESS" OF THE ORANGES YOU FIND.

ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF FINELY CHOPPED MINT IS A GREAT ADDITION TO THE SALAD DRESSING

Very good and great taste with tangerine dressing!  I 
used fresh clementine 
tangerines and fresh 1/2 lemon (all peeled), garlic and blended in  food processor till liquid and added olive oil. It turned out great. I will make this salad and dressing again.

Yummy!  Will definitely do again.  Husband and 4 kids had seconds and even thirds.  I only used half the avocado and I should have used the whole avocado like the recipe called for.  Also didn't add the full amount of lemon zest (got tired of zestin') and using the called for 2 tsp would have been better.  A FABULOUS recipe, thanks!

I tried this salad because I liked a similar one made with oranges.  The tangerines I chose were Honey Tangerines--not the best choice--and I had to add honey to make it palatable. If you use tangerines, you will want to be sure they are flavorful and sweet, like Clementines. Avocado  or Walnut Oil add a nice flavor as well.

Lots of kudos for the great salad and dressing.  Used a small can of mandarin oranges, too, and just mushed them in my pampered chef dressing bottle for a double recipe.  I wish I used more than double the blue cheese.  Left the skin on the apples but cubed it small.  Lemon zest from 1 large lemon was plenty for my double recipe.  I prefer the half spring mix-half spinach for the greens.

Very tasty salad and salad dressing.  All the components played well together.  I used butter lettuce, nearly double what the recipe called for and substituted goat cheese for blue as that is what I had on hand.  Fresh tangerines make this recipe.  I used bottled orange juice in one prior attempt and it was lack luster.  Squeeze the tangerines.  You'll be glad you did.  Definitely a keeper.

A bit more work than some salads, but worth the effort.  I suggest adding more blue cheese to balance the sweet and savory.  The dressing is a bit thin, but fresh and tasty.

I loved the combination of apple and avocado.  The dressing was good, but between the juice and the zest in the dressing and salad, there was too much of it.  A little too much red onion.  The nuts and cheese were excellent.

Everyone liked this salad for Thanksgiving.  I added almost a half of a can of mandarin orange juice because I was going off of memory rather than looking at the recipe. I was concerned that it would be too thin, but it was great.  Excellent blend of flavor.

Absolutely wonderful! This recipe lends itself to add so much of your own things. Here is what I did:

-Added candied walnuts (coated them with milk, sugar and cinnamon - boiled)
-Used two granny smith apples
-Added balsamic vinegar and sugar to the dressing
-Used feta cheese instead of blue cheese
-Also added grilled chicken strips and made a whole meal out of it!

I liked the salad part of the recipe but did not like the dressing.  I think I was expecting something different...something more like the "citrus splash" dressings they used to have.  I ended up using a different dressing.

We really love this salad in my house and it has become a go to recipe.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe with only two minor alteration(canned mandarin orange juice rather than fresh, and Havarti rather than blue cheese).  Since then I have made some other changes depending on what I have at hand, such as throwing in some sunflower seeds, mango juice instead of mandarin, a variety of cheeses.  Every time it has been great!

Very nice & tasty - a great way to get fruit and veggies at once. Walnuts & blue cheese always go well together. Of course I varied things a bit - it's not tangerine season so I squeezed a big orange. Might have got too much orange juice that way, because I felt it could have used a little more oil. The red onions here are too hot just now, so I used a lovely sweet white one. Still yummy.

My family & I love LOVE this salad!!  I made it differently than the recipe shows because I was missing some of the ingredients.
I chopped 1/2 head of iceberg lettuce, 1 red apple (with skin left on for color), 1 avocado, 1/2 c. walnuts, 1 20-ounce can of pineapple tidbits drained (juice reserved) and mixed together for salad.  
For the dressing I used the reserved pineapple juice, 2 Tbsp oil, 1 tsp. lemon juice, 1 Tbsp. sugar, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp garlic powder and mixed all together for the dressing.
I served the dressing on the side of the salad (thinking I might have had excess), good thing because I had about 1/2 cup leftover.
I plan to make this salad many times again, next time I'll make it according to recipe, then next time I'll use dried cranberries & canned mandarin oranges & baby spinach.

Good, excellent dressing. Added bacon and used a rougher type of green.

I've just recently started being a vegetarian, and I thought that this dish would be too complicated to make. It was easy, and delicious. I will make this again. I switched out the baby greens for Spinach, but other than that followed the recipe. Great recipe!

It was a GREAT salad!!!  I don't think I put enough tangerine juice in it because it tasted a little oily from the olive oil.  It was a great salad.  Maybe I should add some sugar to the dressing to sweeten it up a bit.  Other than that it was good!

Lovely, lovely salad--gorgeous colors, and a fantastic mix of textures.  Even the boyfriend liked it, though he raised an eyebrow over the sneaking in of fruit with vegetables.  I used Clementines and Greek feta, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  Definitely something I will make again!

I thought this salad was OK, but my mother-in-law and my husband both LOVED it...  As written there was WAY too much dressing.  Per someone else's recommendation I added a bit of honey, and I found this made it too sweet -it would have been better without the adjustment.  Overall a good, easy salad.

This salad didn't work for me.  Thought it sounded good in theory, but the dressing was all wrong.  Won't be making again.

This salad isn't bad, but it didn't wow us.  Bf liked it and finished it, but I didn't eat it all.  I'm not sure if it's bc of the blue cheese, but it wasn't my favorite.  I'd have prefered a different dressing as well.  I like tangier flavors, and it didn't quite get there for me.  Still, it's a great combo of fruit and veggies so I'll try it again with a different dressing.  Thanks!

I didn't care so much for this: the dressing was delicious, but the salad itself tasted a little off to me.   I'm not a huge salad eater, but I need one for a dinner party and I thought that, judging from some of the reviews,  I'd like this one.  I was disappointed.

Somehow this dressing was just too subtle for the stronger apple and bleu cheese. I needed to doctor it up with some honey and white wine vinegar.

I served this salad with Easter dinner and it was a big hit.  I used miniature blood oranges in place of the mandarins.  The dressing was particularly good and the combination of flavors was really nice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

The salad is very good, but the dressing needs something more to suit our tastes. Will definitely try again, but will maybe add some fresh herbs, rice vinegar and toss a few of those yummy oranges into the salad.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Wonderful and beautiful salad. The dressing wasn't strong enough for my family so we added 2 Tbsp of white wine vinegar. Everyone loved the salad!

Awesome summer salad! I couldn't believe how delicious and easy it was. I didn't use the oranges (just orange juice for the dressing) and it still tasted amazing.  The garlic was the perfect finishing touch.

Dressing-puréed can of oranges in blender with other ingredients. Way too much dressing.
