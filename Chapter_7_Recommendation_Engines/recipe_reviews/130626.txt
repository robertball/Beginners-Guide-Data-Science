I also didn't dip the rolls into boiling water and I made them simple round rolls. Turned out great!

Four stars only because i was afraid to do the dipping in the hot water.  They are so tender when they have risen and i was afraid i would deflate them.  I baked them anyway and they were wonderful--just perfect sweetness.  i could get fat on them!!!:)

I used all whole wheat flour, changed the sugar to 2/3 cup of honey, changed the shortening to oil, and upped the anise seeds to 4 tsp.  All of this is due to family preference.  What a delightful recipe!  I love the small knot shapes, the flavor and the texture!  I'll be making these again!

I skipped the boiled water dipping and brushed with a yolk wash then pushed brown sugar ontop and the result was amazing. They all disappeared immeadiately and everyone came back for seconds!
