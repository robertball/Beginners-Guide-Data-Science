Update 8 March:  I absolutely love the guilt free indulgence this smoothie allows me to have. I chose not to use the stevia because I wanted it to be naturally sweetened by the cherries. Yum!!!

Original: I am amazed at how delicious this was!! Minus the whipped cream it almost taste identical to a black forest cake!!! Thanks for sharing

I used sweetened vanilla almond milk because I didnâ€™t have stevia and even my picky teenager liked it. Great way to get some greens in him.

This smoothie has a great flavor but it doesn't look very appealing. I cut the amount of cocoa powder to 1 1/2 table spoons and used a table spoon of organic agave nectar instead of the sugar substitute.

Next time I make this, I will put the spinach into the measuring cup loosely, rather than packed. I will also decrease the cocoa a little bit. The cocoa and spinach flavors overpowered the cherries. I believe they also created the brownish green appearance rather than thedailygourmet's lovely purple that she got.

It was good after I sweetened it more than called for in the recipe. I added about a tablespoon of agave for 2-servings.  Without it, the bitterness of the unsweetened cocoa stood out. I actually messed up and blended the chia in with the smoothie rather than sprinkle on top. Don't know if that made much difference in the taste.
