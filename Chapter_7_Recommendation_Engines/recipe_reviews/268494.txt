I will never make hot dogs any other way. This is pure genius. The hot dogs in my Philips air fryer needed about 5 minutes. I made slits in them to give more crispiness. I also used gluten free buns, which needed more time. Thank you for the recipe.

I cooked turkey hot dogs in my air fryer oven      I checked them after three minutes and they weren't done so I continued cooking them for another three minutes.  I did rotate them and made slits in them.  They came out great!   We normally make in microwave or frying pan.  This is the best way!

Next time I’m going to try using the rotisserie option on the skewers.

Got a new air fryer and had to try it out. Figured before I tried something more substantial, I couldn't possibly ruin a hot dog. I was right. The hotdogs tasted just like we had grilled them outside and the toasted buns were wonderful.  Great first outing with the air fryer. Now I have some confidence that I can make something more expensive and not ruin it. Thanks for all the reviews that gave me the angst to try it myself.

A fantastic way to make hot dogs! Mine were frozen so I cooked them for 4 minutes and they looked and tasted like they had been cooked on the grill.

Awesome !!!  I put the buns in the basket and took the basket out after 2 minutes and placed the dogs in the bottom of the fryer for more “fry”.   Added a minute for more crispness.   100% delicious.  My oldest remarked that he loved the toasted bun.

I just made my second meal with my small air fryer.  I had 2 long all-beef wieners that were frozen.  I put them in the microwave on defrost for 2 minutes, which thawed them just enough for easier cutting.  I cut them in half and placed them in the air fryer at 400 degrees.  I set the timer for 5 minutes.  Then because I really like them really browned, I turned them and cooked them for another 3 minutes.  They were perfect for me and my husband.
