About a week before you plan on serving it, prepare the meat and let marinade over night in the refrigerator. (I added fresh carrote and sliced onions)  Cook it, let cool then slice it and freeze.  Reheat in the cooking liquid.  When heated take the liquid, cranberries, and vegetables and puree them.  Cook the liquid down and you have a wonderful gravy to go with a delicious brisket!
I made this for Thanksgiving along with my turkey.  I have turkey left but not a bit of Brisket!

I've made this several times in the crockpot, and it's always a winner.  This same sauce is also good baked on chicken.  I bet it would even be good with pork.  Very versatile and delicious!

I have been making this recipe for awhile now.  This recipe may sound strange, but is very, very good. The tangy and sweet are excellent together.  So easy to make too.  
I usually make "Super Squash" with this recipe, which is found on this website as well. This is the best recipe I make, and I make alot of recipes.  Definitely try this.

I made this for New Year's day dinner & it was fantastic!!! I'm Texan & I still say this sauce is better than BBQ anytime! :o) I too used a can of whole cranberries instead of fresh. I sliced it, plated it & poured the sauce over the slices; served it w/ green bean bundles, black eyed peas, salad & cranberry ice (from allrecipes) for dessert. It will become our traditional Texan New Year's Day dinner............................................................................ I made this again for a church potluck where several other BBQ briskets were brought & just wanted to tell y'all that my cranberry brisket was chosen over all of their's 3 to 1.

This was great.  I made it in a slow cooker and used a can of whole cranberry sauce instead of fresh cranberries.  Also, I had a small bottle of Catalina dressing which turned out to be less than one cup, but that didn't seem to matter.  There was plenty of sauce to serve over the meat and the kids loved it.  I'll definitely make this again!

I prepared it as a main dish for a pot luck party.  EVERYONE asked for the recipe.  It is very very easy to prepare.  The serving amount of brisket recommended in the recipe is for 6, not 16 (unless you are using it as an appetizer). I had a group of 16, so I used a 6.5 pound brisket. I cooked it for 4 hours, which was plenty of time. I sliced the brisket then mixed it back into the sauce- it was delicious!  I'm using this recipe again for another party. My husband was disappointed that there were no leftovers, so I'll to get an even bigger brisket next time!

I made this recipe for a special dinner with my mom and her friend and we all agreed that it was excellent! I kept getting compliments all night...even after dinner was over! It was so different from any other brisket we have ever had. So easy and so good! I only made two changes to the original...I used a sweet honey catalina dressing and dried cranberries only because I couldn't find any fresh. It turned out wonderfully! Thank you so much for this YUMMY brisket!!

this recipe sounded and smelled delicious, but when it was done, we found that the cranberry flavor was lost to the onion soup flavor.  The onion flavor was overpowering.  Maybe if half a packet of soup mix was used it would be better.

Using Catalina makes a wonderful difference.  I used dried cherries in place of cranberries and it was still moist.  My family left no leftovers.

I made this in my slow cooker using a can of whole cranberry sauce instead of fresh cranberries and cooked it on high for four hours.  The meat was tender and flavorful and we really enjoyed it.

Very good, very different.  Everybody loved it.  We really love the left overs and changes I've made so here are my tweaks: 5-6 pound brisket, 1 bag cranberries + 1 can of whole cranberry sauce instead of doubling the fresh cranberries. Just use the 1 envelope of soup mix (If I use a 3 pound brisket I cut this in half), and double the catalina dressing.

This was a HUGE hit at Hannukah party I threw.  I did modify a bit.  I used a 5lb brisket, 1 can of whole cranberry sauce (as suggested by other reviewers,) only half an enevelope of onion soup mix (I don't really like the taste of the soup mix) and threw everything in the crockpot and cooked for 10hrs on low.  I think next time I will use even less of the soup mix as it was a bit salty and mabybe another can of cranberries to give a more fruity flavor.  All in all, really tasty though!

I made this because of the high reviews and it sounded delicious, but I should have listened to the one person who said it was way too much flavor. There was too much onion seasoning - should have only used half or a quarter of the packet. And the cranberries were really pretty, they made a beautiful sauce around the brisket in my dutch oven, but it was too salty/tangy to even taste the meat.

This came out super yummy! I was surprised it didn't have more of a cranberry flavor, but it still was excellent. We added some cranberry sauce to the sandwich. Thank you for such a creative brisket!

I made this and, unfortunately, did not care for it. The vinegar in the dressing and the tartness of the cranberries didn't meld well nor make it a savory dish.

I have always made this recipe with "super squash", another recipe on here.  I can hardly make one without the other now.  The super squash recipe helps with any bittterness of the cranberries.  The cranberries help give the super squash a little zing as well! Try these two together.  You'll love it

This was really great and flavorful.  I would advise AGAINST cooking for the full 4 hours as doing that made my brisket a bit dry and overdone...but the flavors were wonderful.  Next time, I'm pulling it out of the oven after 3 hours.

I made this for Christmas Dinner. The picture above is mine. I used roast cut instead of brisket cut for better persentation, but it came out awesome!! It was so tender that you could cut it with a fork and the taste was delicious. This is definitely a keeper!

This was super easy to make.  I thought the flavor was wonderful.  This was the first time I made brisket and I was a little concerned that the temperature was too high to be cooking for such a long time, but sure enough after approximatley 3.5 hours the brisket was cooked to perfection.  The meat was literally falling apart.  This was great on its own and also made wonderful pulled sandwiches the next day.  I would not hesitate to make this again.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but mine wasn't as flavorful as I expected.  I think I needed to make a sauce or something to put the meat back into after slicing, but I didn't trim my brisket very well beforehand so that juices were too greasy to use.

Smells so delicious & looks impressive. Very little hands on time, so it's nice and easy. I used a 10 ounce can of cranberry jelly instead of fresh. Very tasty.

This was good but I think it would be better with canned cranberries--probably jellied.  I used fresh and it was unpleasant to bite into a cranberry.

My very picky eater daughter asked me to make this on a weekly basis (she must not have realized there was a can of whole cranberry sauce in it!) While I didn't think it was as wonderful as she thought, it was extremely easy as well as tasty.  Ideally, I wouldn't want this in the crockpot any more than 6 hours on low as the sauce really starts to burn.

I did a few things differently but still got rave results.  I used a chuck roast instead of brisket...and being in a hurry after work, I cooked the 3 lb. chuck roast in a pressure cooker on 10lbs. pressure for 30 minutes with only 2 cups of water.  Then I transferred it to a casserole dish, put the remaining ingredients in (cranberries, onion soup mix and catalina dressing)covered and baked it at 350 for an hour.  I served it with mashed potatoes...we're all still licking our fingers. YUM!

This was simply fabulous!  When I first saw this recipe, I was really skeptical at first because of the combination of ingredients together and I was worried that it would turn out too sweet as my husband and I don't really like sweeter dishes.  However, as a newer cook, I've been trying to broaden our horizons (and palettes) and seeing as how the recipe contained all things we like on a normal basis, I decided to take a leap of faith. (The four and a half stars might have contributed to the equation as well ;) )  WOW!!!  Like I said before, flipping amazing.  I changed absolutely nothing on this recipe, with exception to using frozen cranberries and not fresh because my local grocers didn't carry them.  It's hard to imagine that the frozen cranberries made a single bit of difference in the over all flavor of the roast, it was really just that good.  The flavors blended perfectly and it was not a sweet roast at all. It was so tender that fell apart with a fork; we didn't even need steak knives.  All around, beyond and above, excellent recipe and I am soo glad that I decided to take a chance on it.  I will most certainly be making this again!!

Interesting mix of flavors...not quite sure if I really liked it.  At 3.5 hours, the brisket was pretty tender, but could have baked at least another half hour.  Still looking for that killer brisket recipe.

This must be a love it or hate it recipe.  The meat came out very tangy almost tart.  It didn't taste at all like what I think of as traditional brisket.  We did not enjoy this at all.

It was OK.  Nothing special.  Granted, the outside of the roast where it carmelized was very good, but the flavor didn't penetrate.  Also, the smell while it was cooking was unpleasant.

In spite of the trouble I had, the results were tasty and I look forward a more successful attempt.  I mistakenly elected the 4 hour cooking time and burned the marinade, the bottom of the meat and most of the cranberries.  I had trouble getting a good tight seal on the baking dish with the aluminum foil - this may have contributed to my problems.  When I try again I will probably try a lidded casserole dish.

I first had this at the MapleLag Cross Country Ski resort near Detroit Lakes MN.  It is Fantastic!  I cook it at 300 degrees for 4 hours.  Then put it into the refrig over night  slice it and put it back into the oven at 300 for 1.5 hours. I use a 3.5 or 4 pound Brisket with extra fat thinned out on the back.You can also add some dry red wine (1/4 c) if desired.

I was very excited to try this, but it did not turn out well at all.  I followed the recipe as written. We sampled a bit before dinner and found that we did not like it at all and scrambled to make dinner plan #2.

This was excellent!  Super easy. Cooked for 6 hours on high in the crockpot and used whole berry cranberry sauce instead of fresh berries.  Served over mashed potatoes.  Really good and easy.  4 lbs serves 8.

Very yummy, and easy to make!  A good way to prepare a cut of meat that usually would do well to be marinated and/or slow-cooked!  I might add a bit of sugar next time, as my family was slightly put off by the tartness of our cranberries...but I thought it was great!

I would have rated this 5 stars, but there were some changes that I had to make. 1) I didn't have Catalina dressing so I used French. 2) The cranberries that I had went bad. So I used dried cranberries. 3) Instead of preheating the oven to 350, I lowered the temp to 300. 4) After baking, I uncovered the brisket and raised the temp to 375--to caramelize the brisket and sauce. It was a huge hit. The fat rendered perfectly and the moist meat was fork-tender. Only bad thing about  this 
incredible recipe is that there was very little left over for the next day!

This created some of the least flavorful brisket imaginable.  The only way to rectify this was to make a sauce out of the drippings.  I mashed up any remaining cranberries and then strained all the juices, added about 1/2 cup sugar, tsp of black pepper, tsp of crushed pepper, and 2 tbsp. white wine vinegar and reduced down to a BBQ sauce consistency.

This was so good, but I made changes to it. I use whole berry cranberry sauce because I couldn’t find fresh cranberries and only used half the package of onion soup mix. Cooked it in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Will be making this again!

The flavor of the brisket was very good!  Im not sure I would keep the foil cover on the entire time as it made the sauce soupy and not carmelized at all.   I also used a 4.78 lb  brisket and cooked for 3.5 hours more would have been too much

As an alternative to fresh cranberries, I substituted 1can of cranberry jellied sauce and a couple handfuls of dried cranberries which plumped up in the slow cooker. Resulted in extra sauce but that's preferable to a shortage. Delicious and simple recipe.

I made this for Seder this year and it was a HUGE hit!  I doubled the recipe because I had 10 guests and I wanted leftovers. The only changes I made was using half a packet of onion soup mix, using 2 cans of whole cranberry sauce and I made homemade Catalina dressing (from Food.com) since I forgot to buy that dressing. When I make this again I will make sure that my baking pan has deep enough sides to handle the extra juices (I did cut off most of the excess fat but it still spill a little bit over the sides of my grill pan and the burning smell on the bottom of the oven wasn't the most pleasant smell. Halfway through cooking I easily scraped it off and then the wonderful aromas wafted through the house). GREAT and EASY recipe!

I made this Christmas morning and received very good reviews from the family.  I found a 2.8 lb brisket at the store, and it was enough to feed 11, although they were very small portions.  Luckily, there was plenty of other food to be had.
The sauce seemed like it would be good on roasted turkey as well.
I made it in a crock pot.  I first rubbed 1/2 of the onion soup mix into the meat, and then seared it.  Then, I poured the catalina dressing over it and let it marinate over night.  Next, I put it in the crock pot and added the rest of the onion soup and the cranberries.  I cooked it on low for about 6 hours.  I let the meat rest overnight, then rewarmed it Christmas morning.
