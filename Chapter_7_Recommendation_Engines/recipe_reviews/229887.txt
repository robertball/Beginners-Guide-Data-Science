This was delicious!  I substituted apple cider for the whiskey and it worked great.  Will definitely be making again!

This was a pleasant surprise! I didn't have Jack Daniels nor a jalapeño pepper and used scotch whiskey instead. I don't think scotch was much different from using Jack but perhaps I will try it with Jack and a little jalapeño next time.  I loved the fennel flavor with the sweet potato.  It was a southern cooking twist to a couple of root veggies. The bacon, onion and fennel aromas were so nice when starting out. Advice:  Don't let the potatoes get too soft and mix the brown sugar together with the whiskey before pouring it over the veggies. Wait for the sauce to Thicken a bit., If you  like a little "kick",  I am sure a bit of diced small jalapeño would have been a nice touch. I just wouldn't 'add too much so as not to overwhelm the taste of the fennel and sweet potatoes.

Couldn't find fennel so I substituted with celery.  Also, used Wild Turkey honey bourbon and cut the sugar in half.  This was delicious!  Wish fennel was in season but will definitely make this again.

I made this with apple cider instead of whiskey like one of the reviews recommended.  It was delicious!  One of my guests told me that she hates sweet potatoes, but that she actually enjoyed them cooked this way.

Soooo good! Used JD Tennessee Honey whiskey. Followed another reviewer's comment to mix whiskey & sugar before adding to vegetables. Had already cooked bacon so used olive oil and skipped Step 1. Probably will add the jalapeño at the end next time for more kick (added with fennel at beginning).

Okay, I seriously have to say that these are hands down the BEST home fries I have ever had. I have never left a review on any website but these were worth the time to do so. I had to make two substitutions only because I didn't have a couple of the spices on hand. I used chopped celery in place of fennel and chipotle pepper instead of jalapenos. I can't wait to make this with the fennel since we really like it. Great recipe! Cheers!

Not a bad recipe but the brown sugar, whiskey, and bacon completely overpowered the flavor of the sweet potatoes. To me it tasted similar to baked beans with bacon, and that’s not what I was looking for.

Changes I made: double the bacon, two sweet potatoes, half a bulb and the stalks from fennel, no onion, no jalapeno. I prefer my sweet potatoes to be savory, and I needed to use up leftover fennel so this was a nice dish. Boyfriend gives it 3 and a half stars, but says he would make it again. It didn't wow me enough for 5 stars, but I thought it was pretty good and I would probably make it again if I had the ingredients on hand.

Sooooo good. My husband hates sweet potatoes and he ate seconds. I substituted half a red pepper for Jalapeno and used red pepper flakes to add heat instead. Yum yum!

Amazing!!  Served as a side to scrambled eggs, but ready to try again with sausage or chicken.  My fennel bulb was small so I used the whole thing and added more sweet potato (about 20 oz. peeled/cubed).  Forgot the jalapeño.  It was so good, but I can see where a little zing might compliment the sweetness.  Will add it next time.

Followed directions but I made it without a jalapeño pepper and I doubled the sweet potato portion and it came out great!

SOOOO AMAZING!!! I didnt have whiskey but had some ginger broth already open in the fridge which worked fine. Also I didnt want to waste mouth watering bacon so I used the whole 16 oz pkg! No regrets there. Also I had some leeks that needed to get used so replaced them for the onion. Over all super tasty! I probably could use less sugar next time cause it was really sweet which isnt bad in my opinion, Im just thinking of others. Also I used a huge sweet potato, they come in such a variety of sizes but I figure the more the better right? Just be sure to cut them small so they cook through. Thank you to who ever posted!!!!

This recipe is awesome. I always halve the brown sugar and occasionally add a couple handfuls of kale at the same time that I add the sweet potatoes. One of my favorite winter meals. I always double the recipe because I wouldn't know what to do with the other half of a fennel bulb. Also, 6 servings is a bit much. When I double it, I get four filling dinners out of it. I think if you were serving it alongside eggs and toast for breakfast, you could get 4 servings out of it. But 6? Maybe if you eat like a bird.

Made this for dinner last night and it was a huge hit with the family. Once it was all done I transferred it to a serving dish and quickly fried up 4 eggs in the pan with all the drippings.  Completely wonderful. Definitely plan to make it again.

THIS WAS AWESOME. Pretty much went exactly by the recipe, added a little fresh garlic and did thick cut bacon ends chopped up and threw some pepperjack cheese on top. Killer.

Delicious.  I stuck with the recipe except that I only had 1/8 cup of whiskey, so I also used cider vinegar. This was wonderful. Next time, I'll make sure to stop by the liquor store first.

I was a little skeptical but this was really good! The recipe didn't specify when to add the jalapeño so I added it at the onion step. Followed the recipe exactly - the only thing I would do differently next time is double it! Thanks!

Pretty good.  Followed the directions except I halved the sugar.  Good thing, wouldn't have wanted it any sweeter.  Though I don't care for heat much, I would make again with twice the jalapeno next time.

The flavor was great but I felt the onion and fennel got too brown by time sweet potatoes were done. Next time I will try cooking them for less time before adding the potatoes.

So delicious! I added mushrooms and extra bacon, and instead of whiskey I used some OJ and water. Turned out so yummy, it was a great comforting breakfast for dinner meal paired with some eggs and biscuits at the end of a long day.

Very good, but a bit too sweet. I'd use either two medium or one giant sweet potato and cut the sugar down to a tablespoon. Otherwise, a  great side to turkey sausage loop for dinner.

This is a nice change from just a regular old baked sweet potato. I also skipped the jalapeno (am I missing something, or does the recipe not state when to add it?). I went a little hog wild and quadrupled the recipe. I'll probably just double it next time.  Definitely a keeper.

Really good.  The only changes I made were to mix the sugar and whiskey together before adding to the vegetables and I used jarred jalapeños as I didn't have any fresh.  Husband really liked it.

This dish quickly became a household favorite and even though I make a large amount there rarely ever are leftovers. I add more bacon because bacon makes everything better! and I use 1/2 cup of bourbon instead of whiskey. I have added parsnips, cubed ham, and Asian pear - each adds flavor.

Terrific recipe!  I'm not a big fan of sweet potato/marshmallow casseroles, and this is a tasty  change. It has a sweet/hot/savory mix of flavors that is hard to beat.  The recipe, exactly as written, is five stars.  I  put a minced, unpeeled Granny Smith apple into the mix, but it's not necessary, I just had one in the fridge. Add some walnuts or pecans, and this one is ready for the Thanksgiving table.

Very enjoyable little breakfast recipe for a couple who doesn't normally do breakfast, but just happened to be in the mood.  We used bourbon and sub'd out half the brown sugar with real maple syrup to play up the smokey maple bacon I used.  Loved the additional of the fennel.  Would be great bit a bit of cubed apple.

This is SO yummy! All I had was bourbon, don't  know how different that is from Jack Daniels.  Next time I plan to try the ACV like other reviewers. I used only 3 oz. of bacon, it was the end of the package. Still bacony, even with increasing the amount of veggies. A keeper in this house!

Sweet, savory and a little spicy! I love a good Brinner (breakfast for dinner) and this was a good way to change it up. I used sausage instead of bacon, left it in the pan; green onions instead of fennel and Courvoisier cognac instead of whiskey (it was either the good stuff of the tequila left in the liquor cabinet). Final touch, dash of cayenne. Topped it off with an over easy egg. So. Good.

I skipped the fennel and yellow onion and instead used green onion, asparagus and garlic. Also used Jameson instead of Jack Daniel. This was amazing! Boyfriend loved it too!

We forgot the jalapeño, but this was fantastic! We will have to try this again.
