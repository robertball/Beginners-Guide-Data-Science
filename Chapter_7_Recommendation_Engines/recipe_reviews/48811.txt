Made this with fresh cherries, tried  with both sweet and sour cherries. I just added more sugar and some flour to the sour cherries. I also saved some of the batter to put on top before baking. Besides the cherries I sprinkled on sliced almonds before topping with the dough.

This was very good, but not quite what I thought it would be. From the "bar" name, I expected to get something harder, like a cookie. Instead, it was more towards a sponge-cake (not nearly as soft, though), or a cobbler like another reviewer wrote. My batch may have been a smidgen flatter than desired, since my dish was a little bigger at 9.5 x 13.5 inches; and I didn't quite spread the cherry-pie filling close enough to the edges. I "buttered" the dish with butter-flavored cooking spray. Also, I'd never used lemon zest - I just ran a somewhat fine grater over a lemon, and obtained 1/2 tsp. of finely grated stuff. However, my palate wasn't discriminating enough to discern the lemon juice and lemon zest, but it probably helped the recipe anyway.

I used the suggested canned cherry-pie filling, and it tasted perhaps a bit "unfinished". However, slightly reheated in the microwave, it was maybe even better! Unfortunately, I let it sit around one day too long, and had to throw away the last third of the batch because little white spots of mold appeared (that hasn't happened in a long time!). So my advice to everyone is to gobble this up quickly. I'll add it to my recipe box. Thanks for a nice new treat.

My husband cannot stop raving about this recipe-he says they are super delicious, awesome!! The only change I made was to use 1 cup milk instead of light cream.

I didn't have cream, so I also replace it with milk.  I was surprised to have more of a batter than a dough.  It was good, but turned out more like a cobbler.

I used strawberries & won't do that again. Next time I'm going to try apples with brown sugar & cinnamon or blueberry pie filling.

I have made this several times and love it.  I use heavy cream in place of light cream.  I have never added the grated lemon zest, but only because I'm too lazy to do it! HA! Everyone raves about this delicious cake.  I have tried other fruit fillings, but prefer the cherry the best.  I think the tartness of the cherries, really sets off the sweetness of the crust.

I sprinkled a handful of white chocolate chips on top of the cherry pie filling, which was delicious, but I found the cake-base to be rather tough. When I made it, it certainly wasn't of a consistency that could be "patted" into place. I followed the recipe exactly, but it was almost the consistency of cake batter. Of all the desserts I made for Easter dinner, this was the least popular. I won't be making this again.
