7.19.19  Had 3 very, VERY ripe bananas which either needed to be used today or they’d be heading out to the curb, so why not try a new recipe?  Followed the recipe  except for baking into muffins rather than a loaf.  I always bake muffins at 350º, so I bumped up the temp a bit, and they were done in about 20 minutes (ended up with 11).  These are moist, tasty muffins, but if I make these again, I will substitute half of the brown sugar with granulated white sugar.  The banana flavor mingles well with the chocolate chips, and it’s a treat when you bite into one of those soft chips.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
