I am not going to rate this because it is my own. I added a few "notes" to the bottom of the recipe that I noticed did not make it to publication. 

1. I don't normally measure the vinegar and oil when I make this recipe so the amounts are approx. Usually I keep adding a little oil, a little vinegar then keep tasting.

2. Nine times out of ten, the next morning the pasta will soak up the vinegar and oil mixture. You can add water if you like to moisten but I usually go in and add a little more of the olive oil and/or red wine vinegar.

I also have been making a similar recipe for years. I use caesar-italian bottled dressing and instead of moz. cheese I sprinkle in some grated parmesean cheese. My family has loved this pasta salad for years!!

Salad was wonderful.  Recieved a lot of compliments.  I ommited the cauliflower, and went light on the red onion.  Next time I will add the cauliflower, more onion, and more cheese!!  Wonderful!

This was very good but it did get very dry.  Most people ended up putting some Italian dressing on it and that worked well.  Also, it took forever to make this, maybe because I'm slow at chopping.  I don't know, but it took me 1 1/2 hours total.  UGH!  I did add green and red pepper.  Have to say it was worth it though because it really does taste wonderful!

Excellent but it makes a really large batch even though I only used 1/2 of the broccoli and cauliflower and about 2/3 of the 8 oz. of pepperoni. I used the turkey pepperoni. I ran out of red wine vinegar(used 1/3 c.) so the next day I added zesty Italian and it was still wonderful. Even my 2 young grandsons liked it.

I didn't exactly make this as written, but its a good starting point.  I used two bags of Wacky Mac (24 ounces) versus the 16 ounces that the recipe specifies.  I used the same amount of broccoli, cauliflower, red onion, garlic, pepperoni, cheese (although I used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella) and olives.  I also added a small package of grape tomatoes and some Parmesan cheese.  For the dressing, I used two .7 ounce packages of Good Seasons packets and followed the directions on the package, but using olive oil.  The finished product was delicious, but almost a little too wet when it was all finished.  To my surprise, though, when I got up in the morning, the salad had absorbed a lot of the dressing and it was a little too dry, so I had to add some bottled Italian dressing I had.  Very good and easy to make, especially for a large crowd or a dish for a potluck.  I'm sure my recipe served probably 25-30 people, as side dishes.

I'm sorry to say this, but... not good. Have you ever eaten a bowl of something, waiting for it to be really good, and it never gets there? That was this for me. It had a pretty look with all of the colors, but the taste was not good. Too much twang from the oil/vinegar mixture, too much of a bite from the raw red onions, and just no flavor. I picked-out the noodles to eat them alone or with the mozzarella. I took it to a picnic tonight... no one said 'yum'. And it took waaay longer than 15 minutes to make, what with all of that chopping, so it was really disappointing to spend all of that time right before the event and then to have it be not-so-good. I'm sorry to be harsh.... It was just really missing a 'yummy' factor. Sorry.

This LOOKS 5-star, so I went ahead and rated it! I got hungry just reading the recipe and reviews. I might try adding some thin cream cheese(that we get here in Brazil)or even plain yogurt so that it won't be as dry-as one reviewer complained.

This excellent pasta salad is jam packed with yummy ingredients, and is hearty enough to eat as a meal.  I have made it for parties and everyone loves it and requests the recipe.  The recipe makes a ton of servings, so I always take some leftovers to work to share with others.

I've made this a bunch of times already.  It's my "go-to" pasta salad.  As another reviewer stated, it's a meal in itself.  I have improvised according to what I've had in the fridge.  This time I didn't have cauliflower, just broccoli and  some diced provolone cheese to make up for the little amount of Mozzerella I had.  I use turkey pepperoni to cut down on the calories.  You really won't be able to tell the difference.  The dressing is perfect.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I don't understand the 4 1/2 star rating for this recipe.  I made for a get-together over the weekend and not much got eaten.  I thought it was too oily (guess I should've added the oil gradually) but at the same time, dry.  Too much pepperoni, in my opinion, and I didn't even use as much as called for. Actually, too much mozzarella also.  All of this could be easily fixed if I made it again, but it just didn't impress me enough to try.  Sorry.

Kudos Helene!  This is one of the best pasta salad receipe around.  I added grape tomatoes and Wishbone Zesty Italian dressing instead of olive oil, Italian dressing, etc.  I made enough for 15 people and I thought I would come home from a BBQ with plenty left over but it the salad was devoured.

I finally found a perfect pasta salad.  I dislike the ones where it calls for a bottle of Italian dressing because it's so overpowering and I am not a fan of it to begin with.  This was so light and refreshing and you could actually taste all the ingredients.  Great recipe that will be a staple from now on.

Yum!  I omitted the pepperoni and added in artichokes and extra garlic!  To make it wetter, I put in some of the olive juice and artichoke juice.  Light and delish!

Yummy! I left out the pepperoni as I'm a vegetarian, and used pepper jack cheese instead of mozzarella to still have a bit of a kick.

Very good Helene! I blanched my vegies for about thirty seconds to bring out the bright color of the broc. Added more seasonings and used a mix of feta, cheddar and jack cheeses. A hit, to say the least and I thank you!

I gave this recipe four stars because I made several adjustments to it and it was a little difficult to use because of the vague measurements on the seasoning ("to taste").  I used just over a tablespoon of Italian seasoning.  I used Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine.  I liked the milder, sweeter flavor.  And closer to a two to one measurement on the oil and vinegar not the one to one suggested in the recipe.  I omitted the pepperoni, used Parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella.  Also I grilled the red onion before chopping and adding it to the salad.  The grilled onion gave a milder onion flavor.  I took it to dinner at a friend’s house and it got rave reviews.  Several people mentioned it had a Greek kind of flavor.  Making me think Feta cheese may be a good substitution to try next time.

There are many cured Italian meats, pastas, cheeses, vegetables, and olives that can be used in a pasta salad. Seasonings: herbs, spices, aromatics, and vinegars can vary as well.
Combine lettuce, Italian meats: pepperoni, salami, etc; chopped hot pickled vegetables (Giardiniera), Kalamata olives, roasted sweet red peppers, marinated mushrooms, and artichoke hearts. Imagine. Create. Experiment. “A recipe has no soul. You, as the cook, must bring soul to the recipe.” ~Thomas Keller

Skipped the pepperoni, used feta instead of mozzarella, and used a combo of red wine and balsamic vinegar.  Great flavor, my guests all loved it.

I loved this salad.  The dressing was the perfect flavor.  I've tried to make similar salads using italian salad dressing but this was so much better.  We only made a few changes...no olives, substituted salami for the pepperoni, reduced the cheese to 4 oz and used shredded cheddar since that's what we had.

Delicious! We made a few changes --Farfalle pasta, white balsamic vinegar mixed with a combination of basil & sundried tomato olive oil and regular extra virgin olive oil, left out the cauliflower, but added grape tomatoes (uncut)and shredded parmesan cheese. I also blanched the broccoli. I whisked the oil, vinegar, garlic and seasonings together, then added the dressing to the rest of the ingredients while the pasta chilled... and finally added the pasta. Since we're serving it tomorrow, we taste-tested tonight and this pasta salad received rave reviews from my husband!

Instead of using red wine vinegar and seasoning, I just used my favorite red wine vinagrette and it was perfect. No additional seasoning needed. It got rave reviews and I was asked to bring it again!

I love this recipe, esp since we all have oil and vinegar on hand.  I also added diced up Salami.  I like to get it sliced extra thick from the deli and dice it at home.  Same with the pepperoni.  It gives it a great meaty taste that my husband loves!

Absolutely delicious! I broke my cauli and broc into very small pieces, and I used quite a lot less vinegar. Husband couldn't get enough. Thanks so much, Helene!

I took this dish to a cookout and got some postive feedback although I thought the pasta sauce needed some oomph. Maybe a cream-based sauce with some zesty spices and freshly ground  pepper would be a welcome addition.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe a lot.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion and used more olive oil than red wine vinegar.  The taste was very satisfactory, however, I still like my mom's pasta salad the best.

This was bland.  I was surprised because so many rated it highly.  I even spiced it up by using yummy summer sausage in place of the pepperoni.  I wouldn't make it again.

Thanks Helene. This is an excellent pasta salad. I especially liked the addition of fresh broccoli and cauliflower. That adds a nice crunch to the salad as well as some very healthy vegetables. Also, thanks for your follow up note. I also found that the next day the oil and vinegar dressing seemed to disappear.  All I did was add a little more red wine vinegar.  I do like a vinegar taste in the salad.  This recipe makes a huge amount so it's great if you're serving a crowd and it's also nice to have some leftovers for lunches during the week. Also, so easy to put this together.

Not bad...I agree with others though that it's a little bland.  It seems like a healthy lunch to take with you to work, though.  Maybe I'll try other reviewers' suggestions and try feta or parmesan cheese next time.

Excellent!  I've been making something similar for years.  Makes a nice main dish salad during the summer but can also double as a side dish at a BBQ

This was very good, but we added some zesty italian dressing to it. I also used cheddar, and colby jack cheese instead of mozzarella. I made it the night before so everything could marinate.

Excellent Pasta Salad!  I made this for our Memorial Day BBQ and it was enjoyed by everyone.  Didn't change a thing. Thank you for a great recipe.  Will make this one again and again.
