I found this to be an interesting combination and it was worth a try. It turned out great! Nice fall-like recipe. I used mushroom noodles with it. Will make again!

We love this dish! It has been a family favorite for years. I first found it in a Weight Watchers cookbook, but misplaced it and was overjoyed to find it again here. I make it as written and find the blend flavors to make a delightful fall dinner. It is one our entire family liked, and with six kids, that wasn't easy!

I did not care for this recipe. I found it to be too sweet and bland, so I added ginger, garlic and hot pepper.
