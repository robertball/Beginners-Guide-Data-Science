This used to be my favorite menu item at my local bagel place when I was in college.  If you add some thinly sliced red onions and lemon pepper, it is absolutley amazing!  The lemon pepper is essential.  Sounds weird but seriously you have to try it!!!

I eat these ALL the time, they are especially tasty with fresh garden tomatoes.  My Mom, who is from England, served this to us kids (on an english muffin, & cottage cheese instead of cream cheese) with a "spot of tea" growing up.  Yum.  Thanks Patt!

Queenie, you are right! This IS a killer tomato bagel sandwich! I've been trying to clear out perishable food in the house for the last couple of days since I'm leaving town, and this was perfect to use up fresh basil and tomatoes. So much more interesting and flavorful than the plain ol' bagel and cream cheese I was planning on having until I decided to do a little AR recipe investigating.  Simple, yet satisfying and delicious.

I love how the cream cheese gets warm and gooey on toasted bagels. Mmmmmm... Husband took a bite, and looked like he'd died and gone to heaven. Quick, easy and delicious! Thanks, Patt!

This is probably my favorite sandwhich ever. I've been making it since I could spread cream cheese!In fact, I just made myself one for lunch tomorrow! I slice red onions and add them as well. The great thing about this recipe is that you can add ANYTHING you fancy to the bagels! YUM.

This is yummy! I love to do mine with onion bagels and regular cream cheese (or vise versa) and topped with tomatoes, avocados, and alfalfa sprouts. Also good with a good deli turkey.  You can do whatever you want with these, they make a great lunch!

A pretty straightforward recipe that incorporates everyone's favorites: bagels and cream cheese and garden fresh tomatoes and basil. An easy to make, refreshing alternative to a traditional breakfast menu.

Very good and easy to make.  I used a whole wheat bagel and light cream cheese.  Omitted the salt and pepper.  I'm just getting over morning sickness, and this was a nice thing to have for lunch with some lemonade.  I will be making it again!

This is more like a method than a recipe, but the original is very good. Looking forward to adding dill instead of basil, maybe some cucumber, smoked salmon or even an egg...the possibilities are many! Also, bagel thins instead of a bagel make this more carb-friendly for those of us who need that.

Loved this for lunch and a nice change from ordinary sandwiches.  I did add the cucumber and red onion for added crunch and taste.

I'm giving this a 5 because I know it would've been a 5 if I had some fresh basil here at work.  I did have cucumber and that was a nice fresh addition.  Great for a lite meal with no fuss.  Can't wait to try again with a red onion or fresh basil.  TFS

EXCELLANT taste with the fresh basil! We substituted the cream cheese for a slice of swiss and it was delicious. I will recommend one suggestion that makes these tastier and easier to eat. After toasting and adding the cheese (either kind), lay the basil UNDER the tomatoes, and then broil the halves on a cookie sheet for 5-10 minutes. This will soften and roast the tomatoes just enough to make the sandwich easier to bite into. Placing the basil under the tomatoes keeps it from crisping into nothingness :)

This is so delicious. I bought mini bagels and made a few and had to go make more. I just picked tomatoes from my garden and wow, how delicious is that!! I think I am going to be a vegetarian!

I've tried this before and have it for a snack at least once a week.  I generally add one of the following:  lox, very thinly sliced cucumbers, or very thinly sliced red onion (actually I don't like onions but other family members do)

This was quite good, and much better than I actually expected it to be. I used 110 cal. bagel thin toasted and reduced fat cream cheese. I don't understand the main picture with a different herb and all of the other toppings. As is, it kind of reminded me of a capri salad sandwich. I didn't think I would like fresh basil on a sandwich, but it does work.

I serve this sandwich for breakfast at my B&B while fresh tomatoes are available - it's always well received!   It's best warm when the cream cheese is slightly softer, but is just fine made ahead and set under a glass dome to keep them fresh.  I usually use the miniature bagels and place 6-8 of them on a tray - it's attractive on the table and even better eating!

i've been eating these for years,a friend made it for me once, I love it. I just wanted to add that hot peppers flakes in between the cream cheese and the tomatoes are awesome at breakfast time because they somehow bring out the flavor of coffee. The heat from the pepper flakes... and the different heat from the coffee... and some smokiness happens...VERY NICE>.

Wow, this was so good! Quick and easy to make - I'd personally recommend using fresh bagels from the bakery specifically for this, and adding a light coating of butter before the cream cheese is spread. The fresher the ingredients on this, the better! For a lunch variation or something different, try adding minced garlic of the jar variety or hand-pressed. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy!  My grocery store didn't have any fresh basil, so I had to use dried, but loved it anyway!  Update 6/8/06: I made this for breakfast again this morning, and sprinkled a little balsamic vinegar over the top.  Outstanding!  Took this wonderful sandwich to a whole new level!

I have enjoyed this recipe for years, but I always use an Everything bagel for my sandwich.  The bagel has onion and garlic on it and just makes it a wonderful lunch or snack.

Why did I never think of this?? This was absolutely excellent, and I enjoyed every bite of it. I didn't have basil, so I skipped that, but I only had whipped cream cheese with chives, so that made up for it. It does take a lot of effort not to eat it three times a day,this has turned into a new craving for me. Thank you for sharing!

These are quick and fantastic!!!  I'm a busy mom with a 2 yr old and have made these to entertain at playgroup.  So tasty like it took a lot of effort. I used mini bagels and added red onion.

Fantastic!  I finally have fresh basil ready for the picking and I had some bagel thins, so this was lunch today. By using a 90 calorie bagel thin and fat-free cream cheese, this really dropped the calories in this sandwich.  A delicious summer delight that I know will be lunch, many times this summer!

I eat these all of the time, but to save on carbs, after I split the bagel, I hollow it out by scooping out the main part of the bagel.  This leaves just the shell of the bagel and once you toast them they are so crispy and good.  This leaves more room for the tomatoes and cucumbers I put on mine too.

So simple and so good.  It’s easy to adjust this recipe to suit your tastes.  I personally like the clean flavors of  the garden fresh tomato and basil.  I made this on a mini bagel so this was perfect for lunch.

Very tasty sandwich.  I was drawn to this recipe because my favorite salad is a Caprese salad.  I made the recipe as is, and it is good, but decided to add a few drops of balsamic glaze to the top and it was perfect!  I can see doing variations with mozzarella cheese.  Also, fresh basil is a must!

We loved this recipe! A co-worker is having a brunch wedding reception so we set up a taste testing in the office with 12 co-workers.  They loved it. The ingredients are simple and portable.  We used the mini bagels and added the basil spread and fresh basil leaves as well. Great flavor and presentation!

Very tasty.  This is a great way to use just about any fresh veggie or meat to make a lite and tasty sandwhich.  I added lemon pepper and thinly sliced cucumbers and red onion.  We enjoyed this very much.  Thanks for the recipe.

Simple, healthy, delicious.  Can't really ask for much more in a bagel sandwich.  I sprinkled some lemon pepper over the tomatoes, but other than that I stuck with the recipe.  I could add all sorts of veggies to this and still have a great sandwich.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This was great! I used whipped cream cheese, but this would be good with a flavored cream cheese as well. I only had regular tomatoes, so I just chopped some up. Very nice for a light breakfast! Thanks for sharing. :)

I make mine with the new thin sandwich rounds that Nature's Own (and just about every other company) makes.  Not as chewy as a bagel and it saves calories, too.  I also use whipped cream cheese with chives and for added flavour, I use Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt instead of plain salt. I love fresh herbs and lettuce, especially cilantro and butter lettuce. There's something so decadent about the melty cream cheese and the juicy tomato in contrast with the bite of the herbs.  Like another poster, I also add thinly sliced cucumber when I have one.

This is a good recipe. For variety though, we love adding sliced avocados. You can add the slices or smash the avocado, spreading it on top of the cream cheese, followed by the tomatoes and basil on top.

I recommend using some pesto in place of the basil leaves.

Yum!  I used chives whipped cream cheese, and mini bagels with a slice of garden tomato.  It was delicious and so quick - I didn't have to wait long!

Yum yum yum!  Love this for brown bag lunches!  Very tasty and easy!  I used a multi-grain bagel for a little more flavor.  Thanks for the post!

This was so easy and so delicious! I didn't have any basil so I ended up sprinkling a little garlic powder on the cream cheese, then some good sea salt on top of the tomato. So good! I know I'll be eating this for lunch a lot!

This was really good. I don't like basil so I only added the tomato. Tomato on a cream cheese bagel is really yummy. I can't believe I never thought of it.

It was good, however I found out that I am not a huge fan of basil. I put cucumbers, tomatoes, and bacon on it and it was even better!!!

One of my favorite breakfast items!  It is also quite good if you put a slice of provolone cheese on top and pop it in the oven/toaster oven until the cheese has melted!

Boy I wish I had this stuff on hand the other day; I was in a rush, and so I had no time to make a quick bite to eat before heading off to class. I took another reviewer's suggestion as to using lemon pepper, so I did and omitted the regular salt and pepper. Wonderful bagel sandwich, thanks.

Great idea!  I used light Laughing Cow Garlic & Herb cheese wedges instead of cream cheese.  Delicious any time of day - the fresh basil really makes it.

Who knew something so simple, would be so delicious!!  Instead of a roma tomato, I used my garden-grown beefsteak tomato...yum-my!  The salt, pepper and basil make it just perfect.  Also, used an "everything" bagel from Sam's Club.  Made the perfect light dinner!!

Update: Tried this with fresh basil and cherry tomatoes from our garden, it was good. Used homemade bagels from this site (Bread machine bagels). Original review: This is one of my favorite quick lunches from this site. I have not tried with fresh basil, I always use dried. I have even added basil, tomato, & cr. cheese into my Magic Bullet to make sandwich spread.

Absolutely fantastic and super easy to make. I used whole wheat bagels, a cream cheese substitute that has zero cholesterol, fresh roma tomatoes, and fresh basil. DELICIOUS! I omitted the salt and pepper and didnt miss it. Thanks Patt!

I LOVE these! I usually make for lunch instead of breakfast. I usually just shake dried basil and salt and pepper on. I always put shredded mozzarella on top! My mouth is watering thinking of these.

A nice, easy sandwich that's light, yet satisfying and filling. I think next time I'll try it without the salt & pepper, or have each person add their own because I thought it was just a little too salty for me. But delicious, and I'll definitely make this again.

4.5 Used fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden tower.  If I could have found my glasses, it would have be a nicer plate and more finely chopped basil.  I can see this being much more of a lunch dish than breakfast, delish!

My girl and I loved it. Simple but tasty. First time making it, did not have cream cheese, so we melted some swiss over thinly sliced tomato and onion (sprinkled with salt, pepper, and garlic powder) prior topping the sliced cucumber on a buttery crossiant. Adding this to my favorites.

Delicious!  Here's another variation that is wonderful:  dark pumpernickel bread, thinly sliced tomato, thinly sliced red onion, cream cheese, smoked salmon.  Omit the basil for this version.

I grew up eating tomato sandwiches in the summer.  we'd get the tomato fresh from Nana's garden.  A little mayo and salt and lots of pepper.  YUM!  Had to try this and is really good--just a nice variation of Nana's.  To those reviewers that that say Meh. It wasn't great.  WHAT did you expect.  The ingredients weren't going to combine into some UBER flavor!

The fresh basil added the perfect amount of flavor to it without overdoing it. I used Greek brand cream cheese which is a mixture of cream cheese and Greek yogurt on top of an everything bagel, and it gave a little extra zing to the flavor. Loved it!

This was pretty good, but I thought the combination of cream cheese and salt was too salty, next time I will leave out the added salt.

LOVE bagels with cream cheese and fresh tomatoes!!! My favorite variation is a toasted green chile cheese bagel with veggie cream cheese and the tomatoes -- sliced thick!!!  Or if you are unable to find green chile cheese bagels, a slab of green chile or a drained can wrok almost as well!  YUMMY!

So Good!!!!!  My 9 year old daughter doesn't like breakfast at all.  I made her one of these this morning and she LOVED it.  So did my 12  year old son.  Big Hit.  I used a mini bagel and sliced the tomato real thin.  Salt and Pep on to.  Fresh basil is the key! Yummy~

my mother in law introduced this to me and it never sounded appealing until i tried it.  although, FRESH GARDEN TOMATOES make this what it is.  if it's not a fresh garden tomato its just not the same.

I went through a phase where I ate this every single day! It's so, so good! And you can use dried basil, too, but the texture is better if it's fresh basil.

This gets 4 (and a half!) stars only because you suggest toasting the bagel - which I've personally never appreciated - although I understand some people do, but not why.  Otherwise, I've been eating my bagels with cream cheese - plain, herb, scallion and garlic, whatever - and tomato for over 35 years.  In fact, the bagel shop in New Jersey where I ordered these every workday morning eventually "put it on the menu" they thought it was so good.  Oh, yeah - I always get a garlic bagel, not toasted, with the cream cheese and tomato (if it doesn't have garlic, it must be chocolate!).

I t took me a long time to get around to trying this - looked too simple to be good, and I was sadly mistaken.   I did wait until the tomatoes were in season which does make a difference.  Anyway, with good bagels as a base it is excellent.  Thanks.

I LOVE this recipe!  It's so refreshing and light.  Very healthy choice along side all the other holiday fare.  
The best tomato I've found is the "Campari" tomato.  Yummy!!!  I've found them at Publix next to the grape tomatoes.  They're in a small plastic container too.  Perfect tomato to go with this dish.

This was an awesome simple recipe.  I took them to church and adults really liked them.  I still think fresh basil makes a big difference.  So it is better to always use fresh ones.  Thanks for the good recipe.

I used to eat this all the time in college and forgot all about it until I came across this recipe.  When I saw beautiful plum tomatoes at the farmer's market, I knew today would be the day for this recipe.  I substituted dried parsley for the basil (personal preference) and it was delicious.  Also fantastic with scallion cream cheese, I seem to recall.  Thanks for posting and letting me relive a bit of my youth!

This is really good.  The key ingredient is the basil.  I started using whole leaves because it made the flavor so delicious.  I also used lite cream cheese, and added advocado on top.  I used onion bagels and that was tasty too!  A really good lunch or dinner.

I guess I am the minority here but I thought it was just okay.  Not sure I liked the basil on it.  Thanks for posting.

Awesome!  I added avocado to mine and thought I had died and gone to heaven - over a sandwich!!  These were amazing!  You can add anything basically to this sandwich to make it taste the way you'd like, but just plan and simple as the recipie says is the best.

This was delicious!  The grocery store was out of fresh basil leaves, so I ended up buying some fresh basil spread which turned out to be a really good substitute.  I think I will serve these on mini bagels at an upcoming brunch.

Very good, but I try to use as little salt as possible so as not to consume too much sodium.  I didn't have any basil leaves at the time either, but they tasted fine without them!
