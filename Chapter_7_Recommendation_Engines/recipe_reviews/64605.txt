I didn't care for this recipe.  It was too runny, even after I attempted to thicken it up.  If I ever made it again (which I won't), I would make a roue (sp?) first with flour and butter and maybe that would help the texture/thickness issue.  The taste also wasn't to my liking.  My husband thought it was ok and ate the whole bowl, so that's why I'm compromising and giving it 3 stars.
