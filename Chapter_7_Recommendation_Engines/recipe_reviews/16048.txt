These are excellent.  I have made them 4 times and had success 3 times.  DO NOT USE A GLASS PAN.  They did not cook through all the way and were very bad.  

I used a metal 9X11 pan the next 3 times and they turned out perfect.  Very moist and chocolately.

OMG!! I have made these about 1000 times. Actually am making them again tonight. This is absolutely excellent and my hubby..my hubbys friends and coworkers ask for these all the time. 
All I have to say is DO AS INSTRUCTED! (Although I do have to say I put more batter on the bottom of the pan than top, seems to work out better)Do not make the cake mix (as on the back of the box) Do exactly as the instructions say to do in THIS recipe and it will turn out perfectly!! 
The only thing I would change is: if your husband KNOWS you are making these: HIDE THEM!!

This didn't work for me at all, it was very hard to get out of the pan and very sugar gritty and greasy.  The only thing I can think of is maybe the chocolate cake mix is supposed to be prepared according to the box with the eggs and milk? If so the recipe should have stated that, it just says add the cake mix????? I might try it again and will add to my review. Seems everyone else likes them so there must be something to it.

These brownies are AMAZING.  I've made them 5 times since I discovered the recipe here and they just get better.  Once I was forced to use caramel syrup and it was just as good, as well as a nice time saver.  I always use Devil's Food and milk chocolate chips, it's important to put the remainder of the batter in the fridge while the first layer cooks--it's much easier to work w/ when it's cooler.

I normally avoid recipes with packaged cake mixes, but you will NEVER know that one was used in this recipe.  These were the best brownies I've ever made.  I wondered if I was missing a liquid ingredient while mixing the batter, but the directions are correct.  The batter is very thick and hard to stir, but that the way it is supposed to be.  We had so many Christmas treats at work this year, but this was the most popular.  The brownies are gooey.  Don't cut them until they have completely cooled.  I made them at night and cut them the next morning.  If I had to describe these brownies in one word, it would be "decadent."

I accidentally made this recipe with sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk and they were fabulous - the only way my husband will eat them.

These brownies are amazing! Best I've ever eaten. EVER. and everyone RAVED at Christmas over them.

I read a lot of reviews and they came out PERFECT the first time. Some things to note: #1 - I made sure to use a METAL pan. #2 - I used the baking caramels from Kraft so that I didn't have to unwrap them. There were less than 15 oz of caramels, so I just used slightly less milk and it turned out great and I had plenty to cover the brownies. #3 - I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and I felt that milk chocolate would have been way too sweet. #4 - When layering the caramel and chips on the 1st layer of brownie mix, the brownies will drop since they're not completely done. This worked fine. #5 - When laying out the 2nd brownie mix layer, I took tbsp size scoops and rolled them into balls and flattened them with my hands. I then laid those on top of the caramel. It didn't entirely cover the top, but it worked fine and spread out in the oven.

Totally worth making. A++++++

These were delicious. Make sure u stir your batter long enough for it to become totally "wet" to avoid grainy brownies that some have complained about. These will probably be the best brownies you ever taste, espeically if you like Turtle.

I did not have the german chocolate cake mix, but used double chocolate instead. They were delicious! I think any chocolate cake mix would work. These are VERY RICH!!! If you want the richest sweetest (cake-like) brownie you have ever had try this recipe! Cut them small and be ready to give some away to a friend (unless you want to gain 10 pounds... or if you have better self-control than I do) : ) !

Yum!  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and I can't imagine how sweet they would be if I had used milk chocolate.  If you are generally a dark chocolate fan I would recommend sticking with semi.  The only bad thing about these is the time it takes to unwrap the caramels!  I will have to put up a picture soon!

Loved them!  Forget the teaspoons and smashing. Put the last of the batter in the freezer- and then when bottom is done dump the chilled batter on to a large sheet of wax paper.  Cover with another sheet and finger press or use a rolling pin to flatten.  You can use the wax paper to flip the thin sections on to your hand and place on top of the brownie.   The first time I made them I refrigerated the batter and only finger smashed small amounts between the wax paper.  The second time I dumped all of it and used a rolling pin.   Fast and easy!

This recipe is a very old one - it's been a favorite in my house for at least 15 years.  Always delicious and absolutely decadent.  A little tricky to get the top half of the batter on - it definitely does NOT cover the caramel - don't even TRY to do that.  That is misleading they way they wrote the instructions.  Just hand- place the batter on top...it will taste wonderful.

I've made these dozens of times and they're always a HUGE hit!  I melt the caramels in 1/3 cup evaporated milk though - it's exactly 1/2 of a small can, so the remaining 1/2 can (1/3 cup) can be used for the brownie mix.  No measuring needed!

I don't like brownies.  Not even this recipe.  Using this recipe, I just won a mandatory brownie contest in my office.  The prize is that I have to make them again for a 50-person conference and these brownies will represent my office the in the national brownie contest.  Whooppee.  Great.  Instead of enjoying a relaxing Sunday summer afternoon, I will be slaving away in the kitching making those stupid rollie balls and trying to make them cover the caramel.  I wish people didn't like it so much.  The only consolation is that my office mates have practically licked the 9x13 dish clean, and I won't have to bring any home with me.

OMG....that's what everyone was saying when I took these to a surprise 50th birthday party.  I was also told they were better than you know what!  Lots of people asked for the recipe.  I made these in an 8 by 8 square pan to make a thicker, richer brownie.  Worked out very well that way (cut into 16 brownies each pan).  I also didn't need 2 cups of chocolate chips.  I used one 16-oz bag per 3 pans of brownies.  Just sprinkle them over the top.  I did try making some of the brownies with caramel fudge (commercial, not store-bought) to save time on unwrapping the candies and they turned out good, but the best flavor is with the real deal!  Takes time and work but definitely worth it.  The brownies are richer and hold together better.  Using fudge caused the brownie to be very gooey and some fall apart, but nobody really seemed to notice the difference between the two!  --udpate--12/18/07....just reading through some comments and noticed that a few cooks were confused as to whether or not to prepare the cake mix as stated on the back of the box...NO!!!  You will have exactly what the box states is in the mix...a cake!  Your 'batter' is going to rise and become fluffy.  This recipe does require a lot of patience, and you're not always going to get it right the first time.  Try using a deeper dish, like an 8x8, and always place a cookie sheet underneath for batter overflow.  Keep trying, these brownines are worth the trial and error.

this recipe is a family favorite! since i've prepared this recipe several times, i have made some changes. i used 1 can of evaporated milk (1/2 c, then 1/2 c), and instead of making balls and smashing them on top, i just spooned the brownie mix on top in small globs - adding the extra milk helps with this a lot. also, devil's food cake mix works well, and even a basic scratch chocolate cake recipe is good, though the cake mix makes things go faster. my family likes extra nuts, so i use a bit more. two thumbs up!!

I took these to work and everyone loved them.  They all want the recipe. :)  On the german chocolate cake mix I made it to the recipe, but next time i'm going to try it with only two eggs instead of three.  To give it a more brownie like consistency.

I would give these brownies 10 stars if I could! My husband said that these were the best brownies he's ever eaten...then he said they could be the best thing he's ever put in his mouth. Our neighbor said they were a drug! He found himself sneaking in our house and snagging brownies when no one was looking...sure sign of a junkie! I made these exactly as written! Don't change a thing!

At LAST! A friend gave me this recipe years ago, and I lost it! I found that using between 1/4-1/3 cup evap milk in the caramels made for a richer, less soupy, caramel sauce.  I also doubled the recipe, added coconut on top of the chocolate chips, and baked it in a 1/2 sheet cake pan -- there was hardly anything left after our family dinner.

As for the topping, I just got in and had fun, pretending I was playing in the mud like I did as a little girl, as I dropped little globs of the remaining cake/milk/butter/pecan mixture on top. (Note: Wash hands THOROUGHLY before this last step)!

These are great!!  I made them exactly like the instructions except I didn't completely melt the butter.  Mine came out very sticky, but I think that was my fault.  I will definitely make them again.

My neighbor makes these brownies and my husband ALWAYS raves about them.  (I really don't eat chocolate)  So I found this recipe thinking this looked like what he have been raving about!  Yep, he says this is the recipe ... and to give it 5 stars.  Well if there were more starts to give, he says this recipe deserves it!  I made just as the recipe is written.  Now I need to make these for my dad & brother!  : )

Ten Stars!! These are amazing! I used an 8 x 8 metal pan. I was a little concerned because the batter was so thick but it worked out. Next time I won't use as many chocolate chips. After reading all the reviews about being really gooey I let cool for a while after taking out of the oven then refrigerated. Cut a big chunk, throw in the microwave for a few, pop a big spoonful of caramel icecream along side then cover with a little more caramel sauce. Heavenly!

These brownies tastes UNBELIEVABLE! I didn't have caramel so only used the choc chips layer in the center and mixed in chopped hazelnuts. Used condensed milk instead of eavop milk as we dind't have any. It goes perfectly with a hot mug of ginger tea. I finished the whole batch by myself. Will be trying it next with vanilla cake mix for variation. A definite keeper!

We have been making these for 22 years.  They are my favorite, but I like them best when they are cold and the caramel is hard.  To make it easier, use the caramel bits by Kraft.  You won't have to unwrap caramels.
UPDATE- An even easier method is to use Mrs. Richardson's Butterschotch Caramel (found by the ice cream at grocery stores like Kroger).  I melt it in the microwave.  The taste is amazing and makes them so fast to prepare.

I've been making this recipe for years.  I prefer to use a dark chocolate cake mix instead of the german chocolate - it gives a more intense chocolate flavor.  I also sprinkle about 1 cup of coarsely chopped (I like big chunks) walnuts over the dough before pouring the caramel over.  Next I sprinkle on the chips.  Finally, it's not necessary to refrig the remaining dough for the topping - I just use a teaspoon to spoon dabs of the dough and drop over the top - I don't completely cover the stuff underneath.  I like the result - the crunchy topping dabs.  Really yummy!

These were great! Although if looking for a true fudgy brownie, I wouldn't use this recipe as a subsitute.  I love fudgy brownies and wouldn't classify these as that, but for a wonderful chocolate/caramel dessert this recipe was truly wonderful.  Lots of compliments and will definately make again.

It does not get any better than this. This was an easy, impressive recipe that I took to a ladie's games night. It was a hit! I made it in a stoneware 9x13 pan that I sprayed with cooking spray and there was no sticking at all! I will make these again and again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

These are the best brownies I have ever made (even if they are not the prettiest! I made a few changes. I reduced the chocolate chips to 1 1/4 cups which was plenty, I reduced the carmel to 10 ozs, I used pecan 'chips' (because not all my kids are nut lovers and don't like hunks of nuts in desserts) and I reduced the cooking time by 8 minutes because we like our brownies on the gooey side. I agree with other reviewers that getting the carmel covered takes some time and skill, but it's worth the effort.

These are great!  I had a little difficulty with the top.  You have to press the batter VERY thin to cover the top of all the brownies, which is a bit time consuming.  I did not make any changes to the recipe.  They taste better than they look in my opinion.

I make this all of the time.  You do not mix the cake mix up according to the box.  Follow the recipe.  The batter will be stiff.  You have to use your hands and piece it in the dish.  Flatten out as best you can with your hands.  After it bakes and you put the rest of the ingredients on INCLUDING the caramel mixture. I do not put that on top, you have to piece the remaining batter on top.  It will not cover completely, but thats okay.  Piece in small amounts across the top.  As it bakes it will close up some.  Some of the gooey is suppose to ooze to the top anyway. I leave out the nuts.

These brownies are fabulous.  I used sweetened concensed milk - 1/2 can in cake mix and the other 1/2 can melted with the caramels.  Be sure to use Kraft caramels as Brochs are gritty.

These are the most delicious brownies I've ever had. The great thing about them is that you use a cake mix so it expands to more brownies than you know what to do with. I brought half to work and the other half to my family. I did do a few adjustments (from the advice of my chef boyfriend), I added extra pecans and after cooking the first half I not only added caramel but also peanut butter and sprinkled chocolate chips on top. It was amazing! Definitely worth the time.

These are what my Grandmother called "Sinful Brownies". For ease, I spray my pan with non-stick spray then line with wax paper. When the brownies are done I just lift the wax paper with the brownies out and let cool, then cut. When storing I wrap each separetly so they don't stick together.

A little trouble?  Maybe if you've never baked before!  I have made these half a dozen times and they are always a hit.  Being from Canada, I had a little trouble figuring out how many caramels to add as ours are sized in metric.  Next time I will buy the bars of Macintosh toffee which will save me the time of unwrapping 56 caramels.  Try to time your baking so that they will still be warm when served - to die for!

These have to be the best brownies I have ever made. I made them first for a cookie exchange at work-they were scarfed down. Now my husband insists I make them at least one every other month or so, because he loves them too. They are not for the novice cook but the payoff is so good! Thanks for posting this!

Yummy good. I add the nuts to the topping instead and only used about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Milk chocolate is way too sweet in the already sweet brownie.

I just made this recipe last night and these really are some great brownies.  I followed the recipe to the T and thought they turned out pretty well, but I do have a few suggestions though. 1.Make sure to put more than half the batter in the bottom of the pan, once you put the caramel on it, it sinks to the bottom, making it hard to cut the brownies out of the pan in one piece. 2. When putting on the last layer, don't worry if you cover it all. 3. Use Semi-Sweet...milk chocolate is WAY TOO sweet. 4.The brownies are much BETTER a day old!

I have been making these for years and they are always a huge hit. I used to roll out the second half of the cake batter and try to put the whole thing on as a layer, but now I just take a spoonful at a time and flatten it out in my hand and put it together like a puzzle. Kraft now has a simpler way of doing the caramels, instead of unwrapping all of them, they have "caramel bits" and you could just pour them right into the sauce pan with the evap milk!! Can't wait, that will save a tedious step. Plus the more time you spend "unwrapping", the more likely you are to eat some that you are unwrapping!!

This recipe is bar none one of the best brownie recipes I've ever encountered! I'm usually a from-scratch purist, but I'll happily make an exception for this great recipe. Still making one 9x13 pan, for a thicker brownie, I doubled the batter recipe, using one box of German chocolate cake mix and one box of Dark chocolate fudge cake mix. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate. I also quadrupled the pecans, adding half to the batter, and the other half minus a few tablespoons (which I sprinkled on top with drizzled chocolate and caramel) to the caramel layer. As other reviewers have suggested,  I used a metal pan for baking, and instead of individually flattening pieces, I just dumped all the chilled batter between big pieces of parchment paper, rolled it flat, and broke pieces as needed to cover the caramel layer. Because the brownies were thicker, I lengthened the initial cook time to about 18 minutes, and lengthened the second cook time to about 25 minutes. The brownies turned out great, but I definitely could have cooked them for longer; the edge pieces were the best consistency.  I would absolutely make this yummy recipe again!!!

Entered this recipe into a Brownie Cook Off at work and won!  I had never made it before and just crossed my fingers with confidence given its reviews.   Made it in a metal pan and DID NOT mix according to cake instructions.   Made exactly as directed and turned out perfectly, all three pans.  I didn't start heating the caramels until the first layer was baking.   Don't worry about covering the entire top with batter patties.  As it bakes, it kind of spreads out and covers naturally.   Very doable,  try it, you'll love it.

These are fantastic!  They were the talk of my party, everyone was asking me which brownie was the one people were talking about.  My caramel package only had 11 ounces and I omitted the pecans and it turned out great.  Make sure to spread the bottom half of the brownie mix over the entire pan, I thought it would spread more when it baked, but I ended up missing the bottom on some of my brownies.

Oh WOW! Best brownies ever. I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate chips, but the recipe is perfect as is. I used a little more batter on the bottom layer than the top. The top layer of batter does not need to completely cover the caramel. It will spread as it bakes and it looks great with the caramel peeking through the top.

OMG!!  These are wonderful!  I followed the recipe and they came out wonderful.  I used Pam on a metal pan and they didn't stick.  I also didn't think the batter was going to cover the bottom of the pan, but I took my time and it did.  On the top I just "mushed" the batter/dough between my hands, placed it on top and baked it.  It doesn't need to be entirely covered or perfect.  They are wonderful.  Will make these again, soon :)  Thank you!

These are very dangerous brownies, they are way too delish. I made them for several people at Christmas on a lark, never made them before, and they all came back a week later cursing me for making them gain pounds and asking me to make more.  These are very good but I would adjust the recipe next time to use a little less caramel and use all semi-sweet chips. The caramel already sugars the brownies heavily, you don't need the extra sweetness of milk chocolate. I will also save out some of the melted chocolate to pour a thin layer on top to finish it. And maybe a little more nuts.

My Godmother gave me this recipe years ago and I have yet to meet someone who doesn't LOVE it. My fiance is a brownie fiend and he always requests these instead of cake for his birthday. The only thing we do different is we don't add pecans. There are very few times when I feel it is necessary to add nuts to a recipe, and this is not one of them, but if you're one of those people who loves pecans/walnuts/etc in their brownies you'll probably love this recipe just as it is. Thanks for sharing!

I got this recipe from my husbands grandma before she died.  So we called it Grandma Brownies! The difference (it does make a difference), is i used 3/4 cup margarine (oleo back in the day) not butter!  And i use sweetened condensed milk (usually).  When doing sweetened condensed milk it is 1/3 for 'kraft' caramels and 1/3 c with the cake mixture! And of course we freeze them!  Don't tell anyone our secret!

I don't know if I did these the way they were written because when I mixed just the cake mix with the ingredients called for I decided there was no way the batter was going to cover the 9x13 pan called for. I decided that maybe the recipe meant I was to prepare the cake mix as directed on the pkg and then add the ingredients the recipe called for. I did this but then realized that it was more like cake batter when pouring over top instead of being able to pat the batter to cover the caramels. The end result was a soft chewy brownie style cake that got devoured so I didn't mind if I goofed.

Wow. These are amazing. Easy to make and delicious. My husband says they're too sweet but what does he expect when the three main ingredients are chocolate cake, chocolate chips and caramel? lol. The only thing I changed was the chocolate chips. I only had one cup, but I went ahead and made it anyways and they still came out great. I'll definitely be making these again!

I have always heard about this recipe, but never tried it, until today for the 4th! I love it!! I didn't put nuts in the batter, but just sprinked them under the caramel on half. I lined the baking pan with foil and greased it really good with margarine, and had no problems with sticking. They cut and came out beautifully. They are so delicious and really don't taste like cake mix at all, for those that dislike that flavor. We loved them!!

This recipe, for me, has the potential of having a 5-star rating but was entirely way too sweet for my taste. Next time, I would add half the chips and caramel! I used white chocolate instead of regular and it was a delicious combination!

I had very high expectations for this dish. It didn't turn out so great -- the bottom part of the brownies were really hard (almost like a solid chocolate consistency) and it was difficult to get them out of the pan. I love the concept of these brownies, so I might give it a shot again. I'm definitely not going to try this again when I need to bring a dessert somewhere though. I'll test it out for myself first.

This recipe is great!  The only suggestion I have is to put just a bit less than half on the bottom (or at least on the lesser part of "half") because it makes the recipe a bit more gooey (always a good thing).

These are the best brownies that I have ever had.  They are so rich and chocolaty! All of my coworkers devoured these in no time. I have made these a couple of times now and have even made them with a peanut butter filling (Crunchy Peanut Butter/Graham Cracker Crumbs/Confectioners Sugar) Same rave reviews.  As for making the top layer, I found it easier to cut out parchment paper to the size of the pan and spread the top layer on the paper to place on top.  A lot easier than flattening the balled brownie mix one-by-one.

These were pretty good. I like my brownies more fudge-like and these are more cakey. I liked the caramel in the middle, though. Yum! I think I will try the caramel with a different brownie recipe (Brooke's best bombshell brownies, which are more fudgy) and I think I will get something that I will enjoy more.

These are excellent, and extremely rich. Since there is only 2 of us eating them, when the pan has cooled, I cut individual servings and freeze them. They thaw and reheat very well.

This was an awesome brownie!  I used a milk chocolate cake mix because it was all I had, and I used holiday red and green white chocolate morsels.  A tip for the caramels...They do make them specifically for melting, so you don't have to unwrap!  Saves even more time.  Will certainly make again and again!!

Easy to make, and definitely worth the extra effort! We accidentally added too much butter (a cup rather than 3/4) but they still turned out great, although probably mushier than they should be. I would suggest following other reviewers and baking them in a 9x9 pan, as they were fairly thin and the batter was hard to spread over the larger area. I'll be making these a lot more in the future!

Oh, so good!  This is a very moist, chewy and perfect brownie.  Due to the use of german chocolate cake mix, instead of a dark chocolate, the chocolate flavor doesn't end up being too sweet against the caramel.

Really good!! Definetly Very Rich!
I used a 9"x9" baking dish and added a handful of mint chocolate chips cause I like the flavour. I also topped it with pecans before the final baking for look and because I had a handful left.

Wow!  These are soooo good. Definitely worth the extra effort.  We couldn't wait to start eating them, so we cut into them before they were completely cooled.  They were very messy but by the next day, were firm and easier to cut.  If I were making them to take somewhere, I would make them the night before to let them completely firm up.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I started making these back in the 1970's (yes, the ingredients were available waaaayy back then!). They were a favorite then, and remain so today. I haven't tried it yet, but think that lining the pan with parchment paper could make removal from the pan easier. I do recommend refrigerating them once they are cooked and cooled. That makes cutting easier. You can them bring them to room temperature for time of serving. Very rich, and delicious for the sweet tooth!

These were awesome. Last recipe i did w/caramels it said use 2 tbsp of heavy cream and melt in micro. the way this recipe calls for the evap milk worked sooo much better. Slowly melted it on the stove and turned out smooth and creamy and easy to pour. The bottom was alil mushy at first but i covered them and let them sit overnight and the next day they were perfect!! Everybody loved them! Will definitely use this recipe again.

Very very sweet...but what do you expect with caramel brownies? I've used this recipe several times and they always turn out a little flat. They taste great, but not the most impressive presentation.

I sent these, and 8 other different baked goods to my Hubby in Iraq, for the last 4 days all I've been hearing about were these brownies! These are his absolute favorite! Thank you for bringing me a sense of "taking care of him" and giving him an amazing taste of home!

Simply amazing! I've tried this recipe about 5 times and they always turned out great! I switched it up and instean of using German Chocolate Cake Mix.  i used classic yellow. simply heaven! With the cake mix, chocolate chips, and caramel sauce! its so rich and yummy.  i admit that i used a little bit more than a cup of chocolate chips and i completely covered the first layer with the chips, but it was totally worth it!

These are my go-to brownies--I've made them dozens of times. As other reviewers have said--follow the recipe. Also, I usually bake them hours (if not a day) before I need them. The extra time makes it much easier to cut them; otherwise, you might have a gooey mess.

Every year since the 1980's, my kids now adults with their own kids, beg me to fix these luscious bars at Christmas.  They take a while...but definitely worth it. I do use semi-sweet chocolate chips instead and only  1 1/2 cups.

I don't normally rate recipes low since I often "tweak" them so much, but I followed this one completely and it was a waste! My brownies turned out very greasy with an "undercooked-like" texture, even though I did not use a glass pan and I cooked them exactly as long as the recipe called for. The taste couldn't even save the texture, as it wasn't anything to write home about either! Thank goodness I had the sense to do a trial run batch before taking them to my in-laws' house for Thanksgiving as I'd planned! I will not be making these again.

Wow - these were a huge hit! They were a bit time consuming but well worth it. I used more than 1/2 of the batter for the bottom layer and we liked that a bit better. Remember to really grease the sides of the pan as the caramel will stick to the sides.

Have made this recipe several times, both as gifts and for my family. It's a hit everytime!  Unwrapping the caramels tends to take awhile but besides that step, it's a very simple recipe.

I got a recipe very similar to this about 9 years ago.  But mine called for sweetened condenced milk.  This is by far the most requested thing i bake.  And i bake a lot!  The brownies are just amazing.  Try this if you havn't already, it's worth the time it take to mix everything up.  Instead of peeling oodles of wrapped caramels, i just buy the 10 bag of caramel bits at the store.  I'll add 1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk to the cake batter, and then add the rest of the can to the caramels and microwave and stir them until they are melted.  If you melt them on the stove and the bottom burns, no biggie, you can use the burnt caramel anyway, it's all still amazing!

These are the best brownies ever!!!!! I make them all the time and everyone loves them. I always use a non stick metal pan 9 x 13... and i still grease the pan... i use milk choc chips and only Kraft Caramels :-) I have found the brownies taste best if you add the butter when it is still hot! to the mix :-) i also bake them for 1 minute less for a chewy brownie!!! if i could give them ten stars I would :-) Thank so much for the recipe!!!

Don't use glass! It cooks so much better if you use a pan.  I also decreased the amount of chocolate chips by about 1/4 cup and mixed 1/2 cup in with the top layer of batter.

This recipe has been around for a very long time, but I believe I prefer using 1/3 c evaporated milk with caramels and 1/3 c in batter and increase nuts to 1 c and use the whole bag of chocolate chips!  Also, be careful to find the bag of Kraft caramels first because they tend to be seasonal!  Maybe changing the name to Bars instead of Brownies would help those who are expecting something not quite so sweet.  But, man!  We love these!

I made these for my State Fair and they won first prize! I was really hesitant to try these since brownies made with mix are normally very chemically tasting.  The cake mix doesn't give them any fake flavor, though.  I doubled the recipe and made them in a 9x9 pan like some of the other posters suggested. They were much thicker and gooier that way. I also added twice as many nuts, and dropped dough in blobs all over the top so the caramel was visible underneath.   Very rich and very good.  Everybody loves these!

I tried to mess up these brownies in almost every way possible and they still turned out great; moist, chewy and rich! My husband loves them. I didn't have milk chocolate chips so I used a combination of semi-sweet and white chips. I also was out of pecans, so I used walnuts. But the thing I thought would ruin the recipe is that I almost forgot to add the melted caramel!!! Idid remember, but AFTER the topping was already on. I tried to lift some of it up to pour the caramel under it, but it was difficult to do and most of the caramel ended up on top. RESULTS? Still wonderful. I won't mess up next time and will definitely make this again!

These are absolutely fabulous!  To eat them as brownies...I recommend letting them cool completely (as the hot carmel makes it hard to pick up in squares).  However, if you have some ice cream, they are delicious while warm on top of some vanilla ice cream!

Excellent! Every single person that has tasted these brownies has fallen in LOVE with them. Since these are a bit rich, I used a small biscuit cutter and made little circles out of them. It was perfect!

I only had 1 c. of chocolate chips and plain chocolate cake mix instead of German chocolate, so I made those substitutions.  These baked like the directions said to a T, the only thing I would say is to store them in the fridge because they are more of a brownie consistency that way.  And they're very rich, so cut them small.  :0)

Holy cow- these were sooooooo decadent. I used a smaller pan to bake them in, which made them a bit thicker. I also left out the nuts since my kids don't like them. We were amazed at the gooey goodness that came out of the oven. It definitely does take them awhile to firm up but it's worth the wait!

Great brownies...took them to work for a "brownie bake off" contest....won first place.
My only variations: used devils food cake mix, and made in a slightly smaller pan to keep them thicker. Will definately be making these babies again!! Thanks for an awesome recipe.

Used a 9 x 9 pan instead of 9 x 13, since cake mix boxes and packages of unwrapped caramels both now  come in smaller sizes than the recipe calls for.  I also used a glass pan, so I extended both baking times by several minutes.

This is what I call a make and take dessert. You make it and you take it somewhere to share. You can't leave it at your house.... it's just to good! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. Will definitely be making this again.

These turned out excellent.  Used aluminum pan,  as one reviewer said not to use glass.  Here are some helpful hints to make these turn out stellar:  (1) use the ingredients only listed in the recipe.  Do not make the german choc cake per the back side of the cake box,  (2) one reviewer talked about them being super grainy.  Use the evaporated milk (liquid) which comes in a can, not non-fat evaporated dry milk powder in a box, (3) to melt the caramels, put in a 1100 watt microwave for 1 min 35 seconds, stir, then another 1 min 35 seconds, stir well.  This should do it, (4) when you're putting the top layer of batter on top, keep a bowl of water nearby.  Either moisten your fingers to then flatten the batter super thin before placing over caramel/choc chip layer, or you can dip each spoonful of batter very quickly/briefly into the water before flattening out with your fingers.  Either way, the moisture makes it much easier to work w/ the batter, and the extra moisture doesn't at all affect the outcome of the baking.  

I also elected to put a fudge icing on top.   1 c sugar,  1/4 c milk, 1/4 c butter, 2 t vanilla.  In a pan, bring to a boil for 1 minute.  Remove from heat, beat icing w/ mixer 3 min or until thickens to desired consistency to spread over completely cooled brownies.

Makes a delectable 13 x 9 batch of brownies!  Two taste testers so far, two rave reviews.  This one takes some time to make (unwrap caramels, flatten the top layer), but well worth it.

I used a gluten free cake mix and it did not affect the recipe at all!!  They were delicious!  I baked them in a glass pan for maybe an extra 3 minutes and just spooned the second batch of batter on top.

I doubled the recipe, used semi-sweet chips, and two 10oz. bags of caramels mixed with 3/4c. evaporated milk. I put a little more than half in each 10x10" square pan that I sprayed with Pam, lined with parchment paper, and then sprayed again (with extra over-hang for easy lift-out). I baked for eight minutes, took them out, sprinkled with the chocolate chips and coconut, then poured the caramel sauce over that. I randomly dropped the remaining brownie mixture onto the tops, not trying to completely cover the tops. Took them into work, and everyone went CRAZY over them! I had folks begging me to let them pay me to make them, and others begging for the recipe! Next time I'd use mini chips, so they melt more, more coconut, and caramel sundae topping instead of having to unwrap all those caramels. Great recipe! Would be great with vanilla ice cream. Will absolutely make again.

Love this dessert!!! Always topic of conversation at parties.  Follow directions exactly and there will be no worries.   Love the tip to spread remaining dough on plastic wrap.   That saves a lot of time.

I make these every 4th of July...making them right now. Always a hit at the party especially if you freeze them on a hot day. I use 1/2 c evap milk to the dry mix and 1/3 to the caramels though. Easier to spread the dough and the caramels stay stiffer.

They tasted okay, but I didn't like using the cake mix.  It seemed too dry and was hard to spread.  I also used caramel topping instead of melting the caramels.  (Easier clean up!)   They were good, but I think next time I would use my regular brownie recipe and add the caramel and nuts.

This is  a truly rich and delicious brownie!  I know it uses a boxed cake mix, meaning it really isn’t a “brownie” but it is wonderful, none the less.  I made this for a long girl’s weekend trip to Tennessee and I did leave some home for my family.  The only change I made was, once the melted caramel was poured over the chocolate chips, I added a moderate sprinkle of sea salt before the top layer of brownies.  Everybody loved them and I can’t wait for another occasion to make them.

I doubled this recipe for a bunch of high school girls and baked in 2 separate 9X13 inch pans.  I did make changes: First batch: 2 boxes fudge brownie mix, I used one entire box on the bottom and baked the base for about 22 minutes until completely done.  Then poured the caramel sauce over and another entire box of prepared brownie mix on top.  Baked for about 25 minutes.
The second batch I used 2 boxes of milk chocolate brownie mix, baked the bottom layer (one whole box) for about 14 minutes-still a little under cooked.  Then poured caramel sauce and the next batch of brownie on top.  Baked until done. Both batches I used strong brewed coffee in place of the water. The changes between the 2 pans were the brownie flavor and the base layer baking time.  I found that the first batch turned out way better as it was baked longer and they held their shape much better than the second which was too gooey in the center pieces for my liking. I threw away about 5 center pieces as they looked too raw.  The edge pieces were great though.  I will make this recipe again and again!! But I will follow the changes that I made for the first pan and not the authors. Im not sure why you would use cake mix if these are brownies? The girls loved these and went back for more! Yes they're sweet, you can tell just by the ingredients! If you don't like ultra sweet, try another recipe, these are yummy and sweet like I like!

have now made these twice.  on advice from other reviews, do use about 2/3s of the mix on the bottom.  for ease I used caramel sundae syrup and it worked just fine.  these don't last long around here, they are wonderful

Pioneer Woman had an identical recipe.  I was disappointed.  The taste of the mix predominated.  I might make them again only with a "from scratch" base not a mix.

Only change I make to this recipe (known as Killer Brownies at our summer camp) is to use caramel ice cream topping rather than go to the bother of melting caramels.  Also can use favorite brownie mix instead of German chocolate cake mix.

I got this recipe from a friend and have made them for our school fundraising events...They always sell!
They are awesome! I did make some changes, I double the cake part of the recipe for thicker brownies.  In other words, I use the entire batter part for the bottom and make another batch for the top.

Absolutely Amazing!  I have made these on quite a few occasions, and people rave about them every time.  Honestly, these have made me kind of a baking celebrity within my circle of friends. The recipe is a little strange at first, but with practice it becomes easier.  Definitely worth the extra effort - I don't really bother making any other type of brownies anymore!

These brownies are sinful. Soooo good. I followed the recipe almost exactly (dark chocolate chips and no nuts)  and they came out perfectly.  I've made them three times and I expect to make them many more times.   For the top layer of batter, I do recommend smashing the batter balls pretty thing, or you might run out before you've gotten it all covered. Or maybe that was just me. :)

These are amazing. Everyone tells me these are the best brownies they have ever eaten when they try them. Don't worry if you can't completely cover with the second half of the batter. I like the caramel to poke through on mine.

Let's just say these are the best brownies on the face of the earth.  This has become my secret little recipe!  I bring it to almost every gathering that warrants bringing a dish to pass and I have become a food-celebrity amongst my group of family and friends quickly because of these brownies!  Seriously, make these brownies.  They are TO DIE FOR.  You don't even need to eat dinner, just these brownies.

We call these "Crack Brownies" at our house...probably just as addictive... I use Devils Food chocolate cake mix, tastes great.   This recipe is easy to screw up so be sure not to pour the caramels all the way to the edges (unless you like really crispy caramel) and do not overbake.  Add flavored chocolate chips for an extra kick.

These were pretty good, but mine did not turn out like the picture and weren't 'to die for'.  The brownie part was much lighter in color.  I think they would be a lot better if I use a Devil's Food Cake mix instead of German Chocolate.

This is a little extra work for a brownie, but according to the family it is worth it!  I followed the recipe as written, but needed additional cooking time as it was not done.

Here is a great twist on this recipe... try using a yellow cake mix in place of the german chocolate cake mix- I'm telling you it's to die for!!  Follow the recipe exactly the same, just use a yellow cake mix instead!  enjoy!

These are the best! We have made this recipe for years! We always take them camping. We always like them best when they are refrigerated.

I made these as written, not to hard. They are very sweet. I would cut small pieces though. I'm going to try it with Dark Chocolate cake mix, and the jar caramel next time.

Amazing. Thanks to all who made suggestions previously. I opted to use Caramel Sundae sauce instead of candy for the middle. I doubled the batter in step 3 and used about half of it to get complete coverage on top. Semi sweet chip and metal pan work great. Wonderful treat!

I may have overgreased the pan with PAM so i had to put the brownies in for another 15 minutes. i was worried that they were too gooey so i put them in the fridge and after about an hour they had a perfect consistency! my boyfriend raved about it and his roommate said it was the best brownie he ever had. def worth the trouble!!

I am very new to baking and was afraid I would mess these up horribly, but they came out perfectly. I would deffinately suggest using semi-sweet chocolate chips to keep them from getting too overpoweringly sweet. I had trouble spreading out the bottom layer but found that it will spread nicely once in the oven. These are extremely decadent and moist and yummy. Excellent recipe!

The best brownies I've ever had.  I made these for Christmas and everyone loved them.  I omitted the pecans, but only because of my brothers nut allergy.

These were a huge hit at a cookout this weekend!!  I screwed up and forgot to add the milk to the caramels but everything turned out fine.  I melted the caramels in the microwave with 1 Tablespoon of water.  I also did not add any nuts since some people don't like them.  Other than that, I followed recipe.  These were very gooey, so I put them in the fridge for a bit but then they were hard to cut.  I think next time I'll line the pan with wax paper so I can just pull them out and cut on a cutting board.  I will definitely make these again!

These brownies are amazing.  Like another reviewer mentioned, this must be made in a metal pan.  The first time I made it in a pyrex pan and it came out gritty and mushy. The second time I made it in a metal pan and it came out perfect.

This is a hit with all of my friends!  The only thing I do differently is bake it at 450 for 6 minutes and then 450 for another 8 minutes.  And DON'T make the cake mix just use the combine cake mix with butter & evaporated milk.

I was quite nervous before I made this recipe.  Most people had a tough time with it, although I didn't.  I just made sure to  really coat my pan with "pam" and everything turned out great.  Be sure not to over cook!

This really is a five star recipe! Completely rich and gooey, this dessert will definitely not disappoint!

I like my brownies a little less "cooked" than most other people, so I shortened the final baking time by 5 minutes.

I froze the brownies for 1 hour in order to get a clean cut when removing them from my pan.

I also melted additional caramel and drizzled it on top of the cut brownies. I tossed on a few extra pecans for garnish, and voila! A fancy dessert was served!

Spectacular!  They are a bit difficult to make the first time around; however, they become easier with each attempt.  These brownies have been a hit with everyone that I have given them to ... matter of fact, they are frequently requested!

I had a bit of trouble with this recipe. Firstly, I live in Canada so the measurements are different and this caused a problem.

I bought one package of chocolate cake mix but didn't think to convert it to oz. because I figured a package is a package. NO it's not!. It takes two packages at 266g to make this recipe. When I saw how much batter I had to work with I knew I'd messed up. I figured the brownies would thin but just as delicious. I could probably have put it into an 8X8 pan but I had too much melted caramel sauce. 

Anyway, it turned into a gooey dessert served in bowls with ice cream and was a hit none the less!

These were good, but not 5* material. Sorry! I would not discourage anyone from making them though. I used a smaller pan 7x11in, and that may be where the problem lies. DO NOT USE A 7x11in PAN!! It over flowed the pan a little (it rises quite a bit) and turned out too gooey. Gooey is great for the caramel but not the actual brownie mix. Maybe I'll try a 9x9 or an 8x11 pan next time. If I remake this and it turns out better I'll bite my 4* and re-rate it. Also, I only used half a standard bag of chocolate drops and 11oz of caramel and it was just enough. I guess if I use a larger pan I'll have more surface area and I'll most likely use more of the aforementioned ingredients. Happy cooking!

My sister makes these brownies and they're THE BEST so I had to make them too.  Since I can't follow a recipe to save my life, I made them with Smart Balance, fudge cake mix, a mixture of milk and dark chocolate chips (what was left of bags in the pantry) and no nuts (didn't have them).  The Smart Balance makes them gooier and more difficult to cut, but they're still yummy.  The darker chocolate cake and chips made these even richer than the real recipe, which is plenty rich.  I can never actually taste the nuts when my sister makes them and she adds extra, so next time (because I'll make these over and over) I'm going to try a cup or so of salted mixed nuts chopped and sprinkled over the top to make a salty/sweet combination.  Even though I cut these small and they are SO rich, I could eat the whole pan by myself in a couple of days.

These were too gritty (with sugar) for my taste but I think it was probably the cake mix I used.  I didn't use german chocolate it was something else.  I will try again with a different mix.

Phenomenal!!  I made these for a family get together, and as sweet as they were people went back for more.  All I heard were ooohs and ahhhhs.  A bit labor intensive.  Trying to roll and flatten the batter to cover and chocolate chips and caramel was difficult as it was very sticky.  Next time I think I'll let it stay in the fridge longer.  I couldn't get the top covered with batter completely and thought that I'd have caramel and chocolate oozing through, but it turned out beautifully.  To cut easily, put in the fridge for a couple of hours.  Absolutely scrumptious!!  You'll never want a regular brownie again!!

Oh my gosh! These are amazing! Totally the best ever- there is no question about it. They are so good I think I will make a btach and sell them to a local coffee-shop. I think more brownie-lovers MUST enjoy the bliss!   I added shredded hazelnuts yo the mix along with the pecans, and it made it even yummier is a delicate way. Thanks Barbara Hodge! You made my weekend!

Oh my GAWD! These are amazing! I brought them to work for a food day and they were gone in 15 minutes.  I used two ger.choc. mixes instead of one, made it thicker...This is a must for all chocolate or caramel lovers!

The German Chocolate Caramel Bars on the back of the German Chocolate Cake box containing coconut, less milk, and more pecans is much better.

I use a very similar recipe, but I don't include nuts. I don't think it's too much of a pain to make, except for unwrapping all of those caramel candies! My family loves it, and it has become "my" thing to bring to our picnics! It's an awesome dessert, and oh so ooey-gooey...a chocolate-caramel lovers heaven! You can't eat just one bar. :)

These were tasty, but I'm on the fence if I will make these again.  If I do, I would definitely use semi-sweet chips, as these were borderline too sweet.  I would also skip the nuts and try to keep the carmel layer away from the edges.  It left a chewy edge that I ended up cutting off.  Lastly, it's kind of annoying to have leftover evaporated milk that will probably get thrown away.  FYI I made in a 9x9 pan and cooked about 10 minutes for the first layer and an extra 5-8 minutes for the second bake.

I had to make a few adjustments to the recipe. First I could not locate an 18.25 oz german chocolate cake mix so I used a 15ox and added a pudding box. but there was no way 1/2 of it was going to fill a 9x13 pan so I used all of it and used another recipe from here for the top. But lord almighty was it gooooooie for the first hour. So good. It was a real crowd pleaser.  (also didn't use the nuts cause I don't like buts)

These brownies turned out perfect and I have had so many requests to make them again. I’ve read other reviews and hope this helps. I have used both glass and metal pans...both worked perfectly. I also used a smaller 8 x8 pan for thicker brownies (they were extra gooey because we did not add any cooking time. We loved it that way (adjust accordingly based on your personal preference. Finally, I had to sub out the nuts with chopped peanuts the last time I made them. The salted peanuts did a phenomenal job complimenting the chocolate and the Carmel sauce!! Yum.. I am going to need to make the substitution again soon. I mentioned it to let you know you can try your favorite nuts as it will work nicely with the recipe. Hope this helps if you want to try some modifications. For the record: this is definitely a 5 star dessert!!

Super Delish & Decadent
Tried this over 5yrs ago fr co-worker! Ran into & demanded the recipe. I still remember the taste all those yrs ago. I made exactly as the recipe called for except only 1 cup semisweet chips.  I rolled out 2nd half of dough on parchment paper  & smashed down using my palm. Then layered it on the caramel. Must use a metal baking pan.

Excellent recipe, however, I couldn't find the cake mix size called for and it seemed that the mixture was not enough to cover the bottom of the pan.  It worked out fine, but didn't  really have enough for the topping to my liking.  Next time, I bought two boxes of cake mix and had a little extra after dolloping on top, but was worth it  (just bake extra in a small pan).   Big hit at work!

This was amazing! I DID use a glass pan, heavily greased, and it turned out great. So no worries there. I only used 11 oz of caramels because that is how much Kraft puts in the package now and I didn't want to buy two packages. The only other thing I changed was to lower the amount of chocolate chips to 1 cup. We ate them warm with vanilla ice cream on top. Wow!

Make this all the time. My daughter likes it better if I use devils food cake mix and white chochlate chips instead. No matter what combo you use these always turn out delicious! One trick I learned is to cut these into small squares and away from edges of pan while still warm then once completely cooled recut. It will make it much easier to get out of pan.

VERY great gooey brownies that are also incredibly rich.    15 servings per pan is a little too much for our taste because they are so rich.   I think I would recommend that you do 24 brownies instead.   I will make again.

Very decadent!  A tad tricky the first time, though not hard.  I followed the recipe pretty exact.  Beware, the batter looks super thin at first, I had moved to a smaller pan due to it, assuming I had messed up, but it bakes up much fluffier!  So I had to move back to the bigger pan, which ruined the look a little.  It did still taste kind of cakey at first, which threw me a bit, but I quickly became addicted.  I highly recommend and ur nephews and niece loved as well!

I have made these for many years with great success.  It's favorite of many friends and family. However, as of this last year the Kraft company has changed its packaging, the ounce in them are now- regular package has 11 ounces and the value package has 13 ounces! There are about 3.5 which equals an ounce of these caramels. Be sure to watch the ounces on the packages! Beware, some of the other brands do not work well.

These are very good and very rich. I used the little caramel balls that are made for use in recipes but only melted them about 95% so there were a few small caramel pieces.  I also lined my pan (used a glass pan) with foil and cooled them (in refrigerator) which made the removing and cutting really easy.  Cut them small -- a little piece goes a long way.

This is the ooey, gooey brownie that everyone will want to eat. I made these and my family as well as co-workers LOVED them. They can be a little challenging to prep and make, but very much worth the effort. I used a mixture of rolo candies and caramels. The Rolos melt faster but I wouldn't want to use only Rolos since they are not as solid as the bulk caramels. You really do need to wait until they are completely cooled before cutting. They are rich enough that you can get away with cutting them into smaller pieces. The 9x13 pan can produce 24 smaller squares or 15 larger ones. Depends on how many you want to serve and how rich your guests like their brownies.

I left my recipe at home and wanted to make my version...which is just like this version!  My aunt also gave me this recipe and it is my family's favorite of all time.  Make it exactly as written and you will have no problems.  Do not worry about not covering the top completely, it will spread.  I do bake the bottom for 15 minutes so the caramel does not leak through completely.

I've made this recipe several times, following the directions exactly, and gotten rave reviews.  I use a glass pan, and have had no trouble.  However, the last time I made them, I cut out the nuts and sprinkled a bit of sea salt on the top as a last step before final baking....AMAZING.

My daughter gave me the recipe and asked me to make them. I should have read the reviews about not using a glass pan and possibly baking the bottom layer a bit longer.
After 20+ minutes of baking it was soft and all puffed up in the middle and crusty edges.
Number one rule of a chocoholic is to never throw chocolate out so we served it up and it was delicious.  Kind of like a chocolate pudding/molten lava cake with carmel..yum!!

Fantastic. Rich and gooey and perfect. Didn't use nuts but otherwise followed recipe. Metal 9x13 pan worked great. Just follow directions. Stir well. Use your hands to smoosh dough on top. Take little bits and flatten then lay over top like a puzzle. It blends beautifully on top.

We have used this recipe in my family for 3 generations and it is a holiday tradition to have them and both Thanksgiving and Christmas!  I now make them as brownies and as blondies - same recipe, but switch the chocolate cake mix for a vanilla or white cake mix and switch the chocolate chips for white chocolate chips!  Most folks can't decide which is their favorite!

Takes so long to cook.  Make sure the bottom part is more cooked like 10 or 15 minutes instead of only 8.

Great.  Very sweet but very good.  I used too much of the batter on the bottom.  I could not cover the top but it turned out good anyway.  Don't spend too much time trying to cover the top of the cake, it will be ok anyway.  Thanks

These taste even better the second day... amazing!! I make these for camping, parties, etc. and everyone absolutely LOVES these and always requests that I bring them. I am actually shipping some to my cousin for his birthday because he loves them so much (and he claims he doesn't like chocolate) :) I recently brought them on a houseboat trip. I made them Thursday and they didn't get eaten until the following Monday and they were still just as good! One tip I have is to put them in the refrigerator for at least a couple hours to harden the caramel so they are a lot easier to cut and less messy.

I made these according to recipe, but I put them in cupcake wrappers in muffin pans to make individual brownies. These are VERY sugary sweet!!!! I had lots of caramel left over (I wanted them to stay in a cupcake form, so I only put about 1 TBSP of caramel filling in each....about level once the center sank) and then I topped with betty crocker WHIPPED milk chocolate frosting. SUPER SUGAR OVERLOAD. a teensy bit gritty, but all in all good taste.

Ok I kind of misread the directions but they still turned out great!  I poured all the batter in the pan, and then topped with the caramel mixture (instead of putting it in between the layers).  Still very good!  I am going to make these again the right way... :)

These are a serious sugar overdose. Super dense, super full of sugar. I use sweetened condensed milk instead of just evaporated, and devils food cake instead of German chocolate. I've had people pay me to make them time and time again. Not for the faint at heart.

These were awesome! I brought then to a picnic and they were gone in minutes. Thank goodness I cut them small! I agree they were a little time consuming(that top layer) but so worth it. I made them the night before and cut them in the morning, and they were very easy to cut. Absolutely a keeper! 
Update: I've made these several times and now freeze the batter for the top while the bottom is baking then roll it out between 2 pieces of parchment and lay it on top. Much easier!

Absolutely delicious! I would rate this 4 and 1/2 stars. It would have been a 5 but the batter is very difficult to work with and it takes a long time. Those are my only complaints. I had them for a cook out and served them with coffee ice cream on top. mmmmm! everyone raved about them!

This was very interesting to work with. First off I want to let everyone know that I made the mistake of using 2 cake mixes instead of one and had to double up on all the other ingredients. This is what happends when you have a 2 year old in the kitchen with you! Anyway after this I only kept the amount of choc. chips and caramel the same and it came out great. The dough was very thick and hard to spread. This is why I think it was good that I made the mistake of using 2 cake mixes. It was easier to cover the bottom of pan. Use a metal pan...trust me! It was ready in 21 minutes and very rich. I used a triple chocolate betty crocker cake mix and a devil food cake mix. It was really really sweet. So be warned! Thank you!

These were really good. However, the caramel layer sunk to the bottom and made the whole thing kind of runny. Maybe my bottom layer wasn't completely done? Not sure. But they were yummy anyway.

These were just okay.  I'm always leery of making recipes using a boxed cake mix because the end result usually tastes a little bit artificial to me, and this recipe is no exception.  I love the idea of filling a brownie with chocolate chips and caramel, but it would have been a thousand times better with a "real", from-scratch brownie recipe rather than a boxed cake mix.

These tasted better than they looked. I made them for a aprty and ended up not taking them but wish that I had as I can not stop from eating them at home :) It seems like there's not enough batter to cover the bottom and top layers of the brownies...

Have made this recipe since the early 80s, it is good with any chocolate cake mix if you don't have German Chocolate. It works great with most of a jar of caramel sauce in lieu of unwrapping all the caramels and making the sauce with evap. milk. It is worth the trouble to make the little "batter patties" to cover the caramel layer. It turns out great and it's also known as "Better than Sex" Brownies.

I was asked by a co-worker to bake some caramel brownies for his birthday.  Having never made them, I chose this recipe based on all of the rave reviews.  All of my co-workers agree that "this was the best thing you ever baked!"  That is quite a comment considering all of the baking I do!  Can't wait to make them again!  They were so rich and yummy!  I loved that the caramel stayed gooey on the inside of the brownie.  Yum!

Ohhhh baby, phenomenal. I used sweetened condensed milk and a splash of regular 2% milk instead of evaporated milk and I saw no problem. My only complaint is that you have to leave the batter in the fridge for a really long time before they can actually be rolled without sticking to your hands. By the time I got them rolled they would be very melty and hard to place properly on top of the carmel. I was worried that they wouldnt turn out because of how haggard my top layer was working but they were fantastic! So my advice is try not to worry about how they look on the top just make sure you have a fair bit of dough left for the top. YAY will definately do again thanks!

A little crispy on the outside and ooey, gooey goodness in the middle.  I thought it was best the first night but it's just a dang good brownie.  On the rich side, you could easily eat these til you are sick to your belly!  Thanks!

THESE ARE AWESOME…the only thing I do different is use walnuts layer them with the chocolate chips and caramel. Oh did I say THESE ARE AWESOME!
Update ... I find that if you use 2 layers of wax paper with PAM sprayed on it and use a rolling pin to flatten out the top layer between the wax paper ... peel off one layer of the wax paper and lay the batter side down and then peel off the top layer. Seems to work well for me : )

OMG the most decadent thing i've ever tasted - perfect for someone with a serious sweet-tooth!! they were super easy to make as well- except i suggest cooling them in the fridge before cutting since they are sooooo gooey!!
i brought them to my mommy's group and sent some to work with my husband; everyone was begging for the recipe!! i will definitely make these again!

These brownies are AMAZING!  I used Devil's Food Cake Mix instead of German Chocolate because that's what I had on hand and they are sooooooo delicious.  I thought the hardest part of making them was unwrapping all of the caramels; so don't hesitate, try these!

This is my favorite brownie recipe.  I actually think these are better after about two days.  By that time the caramel has really asborbed into brownie making it super soft and gooey.  Yum!

Awesome!  I didn't add the nuts since the store was out of them and I used devil's food cake mix bc that was all they had.  These brownies were amazing!  I had a bit of trouble getting them out of the pan.  They didn't stick.  They were just a gooey mess.  But a delicious gooey mess!  They reminded me of a molten chocolate cake with caramel AND chocolate inside.   I want to make more just thinking about them :)  I served them with vanilla ice cream.  They are so rich I can't imagine them without ice cream.  I will definitely be making these again.

My son says he doesn't like caramel and he loved these. They were rich and moist. I used a chocolate cake mix and left out the nuts. You don't need to put the top in the fridge just pick off small chunks of the batter and drop on the caramel layer. Next time I'll use caramel topping and I'll be able to make these in a few minutes.YUM!

the reviews are right! These really are so good! I made them in a 9x9 pan so they were a little thicker. The only problem was removing all those wrappers on the carmels and getting your hands pretty sticky smushing the top layer on. But worth it!

I didn't have the right size dish, so the batter ended up a bit thicker, and I didn't adjust the cooking time accordingly, which resulted in a fantastic gooey mess of chocolate goodness!!!

I made these at our annual cookie baking party this year, and they were the hit of the party. They barely lasted long enough for people to take any home! Even though they took a bit more effort than your normal cookie, they were incredibly rich and decadent and absolutely worth it. I made with devils food mix, werther's caramels and left off the nuts.

Really good, everyone loved them, but I thought they were definitely more like a candy than a brownie.  Very very sweet and rich.  Instead of all milk chocolate chips, I used half semi-sweet and half "caramel swirl" milk chocolate chips.  I agree they seem to hold together a bit better the next day.

OH MY GOD!  Yes, you can create some short cuts but the extra time is going to make your guest eyes buldge when they taste these. I made them for Christmas and they were a big hit!

This is an awesome dessert!  I used regular Devil's Food cake mix instead of German Chocolate and it worked really well.

I did not put the pecans in the recipe, otherwise I followed the directions. The brownies were a huge hit as one person said while they were eating them "they are sinfully delicious"

This recipe is delicious and not as hard as Barbara says.  I use triple chocolate cake mix as I'm not crazy about German chocolate.  I use these brownies to gain favors at work! Yum!

One of my favorite desserts to bring to work or a potluck.  I usually use semi-sweet chocolate and more chopped nuts.  onderful recipe!

I gave 3 stars because I didn't think it tasted like a brownie.  It's more of a bar, and it's extremely sweet.  I would have liked less sugary, more chocolate flavor and more like a fudgy brownie.  It was a very good bar though, the caramel and chocolate chips as the center layer made it into a bar.  I would have also like the brownie parts to be thinker, there was only a thin layer of brownie, a thick layer of chocolate and caramel and another thin layer of brownie.  I will keep looking for a more traditional brownie recipe.

These were by far the best brownies I have ever made or eaten!  So moist and chewy and wonderful!!  I omitted the nuts, but next time I will try adding them, too.  I didn't think it was too much work and the end result is soooo worth it!

These are a hit anytime I bring them to a party.  I have never come home with any left on the tray.  Great for adults and kids.
