Absolutely heavenly with French bread to soak up the sauce...tender and delicious. I didn't have cognac so used brandy, and it worked just fine.

Excellent recipe! It was so delicious ~ I used the Dijon mustard and served it with yellow rice and sugar snap peas and everyone loved it!

First, I must tell you that Michele & "dark liquor" don't get along so well.  In fact I cannot smell it without getting the chills, a result of too many shots back in the day ;).  Well I thought I'd give this a shot, because it was going to be cooked & well...I thought it was pretty tasty.  I did use brandy (I bought a small sample), and I could taste it after a few bites.  My husband tasted it and said "this is good" and normally he is not a fan of any kind of "steak sauce".  Thanks CLM-

Didn't care for this; the mustard flavor was too strong even though the amount was reduced. I might try the green peppercorns instead next time but I doubt I will ever make this again. Husband liked it slightly better than I did.
