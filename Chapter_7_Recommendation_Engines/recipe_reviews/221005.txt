Delicious entry. But too much work.To make the marinade simpler just mix in mint, garlic, lemon juice, pepper and yoghurt . Plus Salt and(or) honey ( 7 extra seasonings)  to taste. marinate overnight for better results and bake half an hour before serving!

This is very good. The mint and mustard go very well together, and the vinagret sause was  a fantastic complement to lamb. I found I needed to cook the lamb about fifteen minutes longer to get it o a very good medium rare.

I always thought lamb was a difficult dish to perfect. This recipe is quick, simple and delicious! I substituted yellow mustard in the sauce, because that's all I had, and it still came out delicious. Very moist and flavorful. I already have plans to make these again for a dinner with friends.

I paired this dish with some rosemary and garlic roasted, baby red potatoes, tomatoes, and red onion along with a light spring salad. I drizzled some of the vinaigrette on the salad too - it was incredible! 

I'm making this again next week for my dad for Father's Day. His favorite meal is lamb with mint jelly and I have an inkling he might love this...

This recipe is awesome! I followed it to the letter--except: I didn't use the aluminum foil on baking sheet. After browning the lamb in a cast iron skillet and applying honey & mustard and topping, I just baked it in the skillet. The result was crispy outside and luscious inside. The flavor combination is awesome--Keith Peterson, Everett, WA

Made a half a rack for a small special Christmas eve dinner.  The 20 minute baking time was just right and the vinaigrette made the dish.

I followed the instructions exactly since I don't always feel confident with roasting any red meat - particularly spendy lamb. It turned out just wonderfully.   The flavors were just right. I had some leftover bread crumbs and mustard sauce and used that on roasted chicken thighs the next day. Thank you Chef John. Im going to try your pistachio crusted lamb next!

Very tender and with just the right spices. I baked it a bit longer because we like it well done but otherwise the recipe is accurate and easy to follow.

I thought this was a very nice. We eat lamb regularly and this was a nice change. I followed the recipe as written. I did prepare the marinade and vinaigrette in the morning so that I was ready to assemble more quickly.  I will make this again.

I made this last night, and my husband is still raving about it. Substituted Ritz for bread crumbs.  Substituted regular old white vinegar for rice vinegar.  Substituted Parmesan cheese for the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.  Next time I'll use more mint leaves.  My husband loved the vinaigrette, I used mint jelly.

This is an excellent recipe - the mint crust is such a great contrast with the juiciness and tenderness of lamb, the mustard and honey keeps the lamb very moist. My husband isn't very fond of the vinaigrette sauce, so I skip on it - it's really not necessary as there's plenty of flavor in the crust. The instructions for frenching the lamb, blanching mint, and searing the rack prior to baking are also great tips for better cooking in general.  However, we like our lamb well done and that takes at least 60 minutes at 400 degrees.  I wish there were more recommendations from the author on how to cook this meat well-done.

I made this about a month ago, and I'm making it again today.  This was a wonderful recipe!  I had to cook the lamb for an additional 15 minutes for medium rare.  I would not skip the vinaigrette, it makes this recipe fantastic!

I have made this 3 times, and it is excellent. I always have to treat others to it, as I cannot eat a whole rack of lamb. It is a wonderful recipe. I put a parenthesis around each group to make it simple: Breading , Honey-Mustard spread and Dressing. It takes out the confusion with all the items.

The most perfectly cooked rack of lamb ever! I used the parm cheese w/an Italian mix of herbs. ( You can now get freshly pre-mixed chopped herbs in the salad section. It's great) I grated lemon zest, for freshness, the olive oil, & the garlic w/salt.  The KIDS loved this too. Super hit!! :D

I served this to my sister-in-law who said she did not like lamb! She enjoyed it this way! We made the sauce but it was so good without it... Thanks Chef John!

I have made this dish now 2x.  The first time I followed directions to the T and was very good,  but I found a few of the steps to be unnecessary (for me) because I couldn't taste the flavor that they were suppose to add.  So the 2nd time,  I made it more on the order of Dijon pork chops and it was excellent.  And to be honest it tasted about the same as the first time I made it,  so to me it made no sense to do a some of the steps, mainly the mint leaves and the sauce.  For me the sauce made the nice crispy outside soggy and that for me was a turnoff.

I made this as directed,except for substituting Tabasco for cayenne pepper. It was savory and aromatic.  I'll make this again.

Made it for my dad, he loved it, but he wanted it bit more well done. If you are cooking for someone who might find any pinkness of the flesh off-putting then cook it for another 10-12 mins at the same temperature. It's a bit more tender, especially if you choose a rack with a little extra fat.

this is a great recipe, the only thing I will say is that it takes about 40 mins to an hour to create. I have no problem with the extra time, as a meal like this should be carefully prepared, and enjoyed over a nice bottle of wine, or two!!

This was Delicious and well liked by all my dinner guests. I did not try the sauce, but will do so based on other reviews. I have made this just as described, but also combined it with the recipe  found on this site which uses pistachios in the crust. To me... adding the nuts makes this even MORE delicious than the original recipe!!! You cannot go wrong with either recipe or a combination of the two! Enjoy!
