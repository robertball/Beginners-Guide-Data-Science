4.21.17   This soup has real depth of flavor, layer upon layer.  The fire roasted tomatoes partner well with the sweet roasted peppers.  Followed the recipe, but did add more cumin and some Roasted  hatch chile seasoning I had on hand (just personal taste preference).  I think this also could be served chilled, like a gazpacho (we'll see tomorrow!).  Tomato soup always was my childhood favorite, and then as an adult, I grew to appreciate roasted pepper soup.  Now I can combine both, and this is the BEST of both!

Luscious and quick to make if you simply set an oven timer to roast the peppers and onion.

12/18/17, a cool, rainy day, my lunch was brightened by this winner of a soup!  Healthy and jam-packed with the south-of-the-border flavors I love, this soup is definitely tomato soup on steroids.  My only substitution was to use avocado as a garnish, as I did not have any cotija.  I loved it with the lime and avocado, and I will use the cotija, next time.  The only thing that could have made it better would be to share it with the submitter!  Thanks for posting.

I substituted with vegetable stock and only used two cans of the Hunt's because I had some fresh romas from the garden. It's really simple to make and delicious with a little heat to it!
