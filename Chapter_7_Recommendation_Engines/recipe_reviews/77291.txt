Just WOW.  This is the first cheesecake I've ever made and I got absolutely rave reviews.  I usually don't eat any desserts that I make, but even I had to indulge!  Everyone always asks for the recipe...and for seconds!

This cheesecake was absolutely awesome.  I've made alot of cheesecakes and this was one of the best.  I had to substitute the sweetened condensed milk with heavy cream and a 1/2 cup sugar because my sweetened condensed milk was bad when I opened it.  I also used toasted walnuts.

I've been making this recipe for years.  I originally got it out of the Eaglebrand cookbook.  It's a family favourite.

Sorry but I did not care for this at all.  The almond extract is very overpowering.  There was no praline taste to it at all.

This recipe is AWESOME!!! The cheesecake has a wonderful flavor! My entire family raves over it. I made everything how it is stated in the recipe and am very happy with it. My brother has requested one for an FFA fundraiser auction. Enjoy!
