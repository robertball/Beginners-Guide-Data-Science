I loooooove this marinade.  Didn't have all lemon juice so I used about 1/3 lemon and 2/3 lime, and it turned out delicious!  My favorite by far, I made it with the Caramelized Onion Pork Chops!

A very simple marinade that works great on sirloin.  I used 1/4 c. of olive oil, dijon for the prepared mustard, 2 tsp. of minced garlic vs. powder and 1/4 tsp. of onion powder.  I let the marinate all day and it came out very nice.

I marinated chicken with this and it turned out exceptionally well. My fiancee loved it! If you don't like lemon-Beware. You can really taste the lemon juice in it!

I was looking for a simple marinade using ingredients I always have around so I didn't have to go out and purchase marinade mixes or already prepared ones from the store and this was just the thing I was looking for.

I changed this one a bit. I added a couple garlic cloves, didn't use the oil. It came out great. My husband loved it said the meat was very tender.

I had to try this marinade because I did not like the deer steaks even with lots of seasoning.  This was a great recipe and I even tried it out on out extended family who all loved it as well.

Simple, delicious, amazing!! I tweaked it with 5 packets of Splenda and let it marinade overnight and my pork chops were wonderful.  I grilled them and my family loved them.  And that includes two picky little children who just ate them up.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I bought some pork chops on sale, and forgot to buy a marinade. So I made this one. It was very tasty, and so easy to make. Will use again.

Terrific!  I used this for New Year's Eve NY Strips w/company.  Our guests loved the flavor the marinade added to the grilled meat.  I marinaded in a plastic bag for 24 hrs in the refrigerator.

I do not eat meat, but my husband does.  I made this on Saturday and marinated his tenderloin in it for a little over three hours.  He LOVED it - and he is a very picky eater that prefers to eat everything plain.  On his advice, I give this five stars!  (not to mention SUPER easy to make!!)

I personally didn't like this marinade, but friends and family loved it. Everyone is asking me for a copy of the recipe. If anyone reads this and has other marinades, I would love to try them.

I hate giving bad reviews but feel that this recipe calls for it. I followd the recipe to a T and used it on round steak. The marinade did nothing to tenderize the meat. On top of that the meat had a sour flavor. I will definately not be using this recipe again. Sorry.

I used this on a pork loin and it was very nice.  I used real onion, dijon mustard, and added a bit of honey.  I marinaded the pork for 6 hours and then seared the loin in a pan before baking which added some great color to it.  I served a rasberry vinegar sauce with it.

Awesome!!  "Prepared mustard" is dijon mustard.  For the salt & pepper amounts, I used 1/4 tsp. each.  For the garlic powder, I used 1/8 tsp.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Skipped the soy sauce and used BBQ Mustard (stonewall kitchen) on pork chops.  Marinated about 5 hours.  Chops were tasty and tender.

I really liked the outcome of this marinade. we used it for meatballs and they were very flavorful.   Although this is not my favorite marinade, since it requires ingredients that we always have around the house we don't need to make a special trip to the grocery store.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't eat red meat, but according to my carnivor hubby, this marinade rocked. Used this on a london broil tonight and all the boys were chowing down. Thanks Tory!!

This marinade was ok.   Its too tart for me.  I doubt i'll make this again, but if I did I would cut back the lemon juice, and add some honey. Id add several  garlic cloves too.

Excellent! I used 2 cloves pressed garlic instead of the garlic powder and marinated pork loin chops for 24 hours. Wonderful results.

I have made this on many occasions with various types of steak and have gotten nothing but rave comments, especially about the citrusy tang.  I'm excited about how it will taste with chicken, or as a sauce on fish!

This marinade is good as a starter. I didn't have garlic powder on hand, so I added a teaspoon of minced garlic. I also added 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and a teaspoon of dry rib rub. Next time I will decrease the oil by half. All in all, not too bad.

This is now my go-to marinade for many kinds of meat. I  especially like using it for London Broil on the grill. Once we got invited to dinner at the last minute and I left the meat in the marinade until the next day. It was soooo good that now I  always try to put all the ingredients in a gallon zip bag, then add the meat and refrigerate the day before I cook it.

I can't think of a meat that this wouldn't taste great on! It uses common ingredients, and gives you great results! I used this with venison steaks.

I halved the recipe since I was only marinating 1 1/2 lb sirloin steak, and there was more then enough.  The lightness of the lemon juice was a nice change for a beef dish and it had a good tenderizing effect after about 2 1/2 hours in the fridge.  There were a lot of ingredients left up to "taste", so I just put in a TBL of McCormick Monterrey Steak Seasoning and it came out very well.  When I use it for lighter meats, I'll use different spices, but it's definitely a keeper
