This was good, however it seemed like it needed something. I think next time ill try and spice it up a bit and do something with the dough that adds more flavor to it aswell. Good, cheap and simple recipe, Thanks for sharing!

The first time I ate these, an ex boyfriend's aunt made them. And I just had to have the recipe! This is exactly how she made them. They are ADDICTING. I like to eat them when they get room temperature. So easy and great for breakfast, snacks, parties, or any ol' time! :]

The taste of these rolls are actually five stars but I gave it four because it is too much filling.  I think you either need to use 3-4 cans of rolls or cut the sausage and cheese in half. The way stated makes each bite overwhelming with the sausage mixture.  I will definitely make again because the taste is to die for, but I will only put a little, little bit of the filling on the dough.  Maybe also just roll each crescent roll up like normal with just a dab of filling.?.

I thought these were ok, but felt that the sweet croissant dough did not go very well with the salty and spicy sausage filling.  Furthermore, my husband did not like it at all, and he is usually not very picky.  Next time I make them, I will make sure to either use pizza dough or make my own dough.

This is a great recipe. I made this for work and it turned out great. The pickiest eater there couldn't get enough of them. These were wonderful and I will definitely make them again. Everyone loved them and they were so simple. No one could believe it was just three simple ingredients.

I got this recipe from a friend in my MOPS (mothers of preschoolers) group becuase I loved it so much and ate 2 or 3 helpings everytime she brought it.  Much to my amazement, when I got the recipe I saw only these three ingredients listed-- and nothing else.  When I make this recipe, I roll out on can of the dought in a 9x13 pan. Then spread the sausage and cheese mix on top.  Lastly I roll out the second can of dough on top.  I also use turkey sausage to be healthier.  Soooooo gooooood!

This recipe was quick and easy to make! 
It was a HUGE hit with my family. Delicious!  Next time I'll try the hot pork sausage.  Thanks for posting it!

I made it again and rolled out the dough and made small appetizer rolls, finger food style.  Addictive!

I cut the crescent dough into small squares and put them into mini muffin tins that were lightly sprayed with cooking spray.  I put a scoop of the sausage/cheese mixture into each crescent cup and baked at 350.  They seem a little easier to transport and eat this way.  I always make them for football tailgates when we have early games.

Being English, the trick is to either use flaky pastry or make your own. Cresent roll dough is far too sweet. It is a savoury snack, so add pepper or spices to boost it. Normally served warm, most bakers in England sell them cold, or straight from the heated display case....

Great taste!  Went great with a honey mustard dip.  My only problem was with the crecent roll.  It keep sticking and breaking up.  So I decided to roll out two at a time and made it into a roll.

I give 5 stars after my changes. I use spicy sausage and I add 1 chopped jalepeno to the mix.  I started using the crescent dough sheet (that's not cut already). I cut the sheet into 15 squares, put some sausage mix in the middle and connect the seams, rolling into a ball. Perfect bite size pieces. Everyone loves them!

I gave it a 4 because it was too bland. I tried it again with herb and garlic creamcheese and added chopped onion and it was a big hit! Super simple.

Two stars only because of the ease of prep. But these rolls are severely lacking in flavor. I made them for a party and too many left meant they weren't very well-received. If  make these again I'l have to help it out somehow - maybe a hotter sausage, and definately some mustard added to the cream cheese mix.

These are super easy.  I make two small rolls instead of one large one.  It seems to bake a bit better that way.

I wasn't crazy about this.  It was a little bland.  It wasn't bad, I just think if I make it again I'll add something for a little extra flavor.  My family liked it a lot, and it was very filling and rich.  Quick to make, too!

I made this again, and now since my cooking skills have improved quite a bit since 2008 when I first made this, the recipe isn't that great. This time and the first time I had to jazz up the meat (there is no notes in the recipe as far as flavoring). The cream cheese is too thick, and could use something to bring out the flavor as well. It an easy base recipe, but needs improvements made. 11/17/2008 Mmmmmmmmmm...tastes like biscuits & gravy, I am going to make this a lot!

Great recipe! I'm sure it would be just as good on it's on because I liked the combination & simplicity. I did add a can of green chilies & minced garlic but can't wait to try it without those changes. :o) Thanks!

Very big hit at my family gathering.  I lined the bottoms of mini muffin tins with the crescent rolls and put the mixture in the middle so they were just bite sized - very quick, easy and good!  Yum!

This was great.  I actually only had one can of crescent rolls on hand, so I used some of the canned biscuits.  I pressed 2 biscuits together, then put a good sized spoonful of the mix in the center.  I then folded up the edges & pressed the seams together in the center, then baked the same as the crescent rolls w/ seam side down.  Of course the crescent rolls were a bit tastier, but as far as my kids were concerned, they were all the same.

this is incredible. It sounds weird but the flavors really go well together. My cousin fixed this for me the morning of my wedding shower. I cook it all the time now. I would give it 10 stars if possible.

My family loves this !!!  To make it a  little healthier I use ground turkey sausage, lite (not fat free) cream cheese, and low fat cresent rolls ... I use 2 cans of rolls.  Roll the dough out flat, put the mixture of turkey and cream cheese in the middle and make a burrito out of it and slice it when it's finished cooking .. this is a great receipe ... we have it for dinner too!!

I used spicy pork and took these to a family get-together. I thought they were pretty good, but everyone else RAVED about them.  I only gave them 4 stars - mostly because they were a little annoying to make.  Not hard, just annoying.

Everyone who tried this oohed and ahhed and couldn't believe it only had 3 ingredients! A cheap and easy treat that appears to be much more than meets the eye!
