This recipe has been a favorite with my family and friends for over 25 years. I have made them with almond extract or vanilla and they are delicious either way. I like them bigger, so I use heaping tablespoonsful of dough, press them with a fork in a criss cross fashion, then bake them at 350 degrees for 12-18 minutes. These look so pretty, just like a cookie from a bakery, and have a crisp, sandy texture with a pleasant almond flavor.

Great. A very picky sweets eater said these may be the best cookie ever. We added actual heath bars chopped up and threw in some left over pecans

These cookies were excellent. Very much like the store bought in texture, but better tasting.  I always bake cookies in a convection oven so they're soft and chewey, but I think these cookies would be even better with the added crispness of a regular oven.  I did not toast the almonds and the cookies were still delicious.

These were pretty good, but we still prefer pecan sandies as opposed to almond ones, as pecans just seem to go better with the flaky, melt-in-your-mouth type cookie.  I didn't really like the way the cookies looked with the fork print on them, so I just pressed them flat with the palm of my hand.  Not a bad cookie, just not one of our favorites.

Thank-you Alice for posting this. I have baked these cookies for years - they have always been our "beach" cookies because they stay so crispy. My recipe is still packed somewhere after our last move and we have missed these cookies. They are so crispy and yummy and I've baked them twice in the last week!

I love these crunchy cookies.  I know them as Texas Sized Almond Crunchers from one of the Pillsbury bakeoff cook books.  I use blanched sliced almonds, slightly crushed, for a more tender bite.  Last time I made them I left out the toffee bits and sub'd in 1/4cup brown sugar and 1 Tbsp flour and they came out perfect as well.  These cookies are also outstanding as a replacement for shortcake with strawberries and whipped cream  or crumbled over a Hot Fudge Sundae, even crumbled on yogurt.

We love these.  I use pecans rather than almonds since we have pecan trees in our yard.

I only rate recipes when I follow the directions exactly, and as written I made these cookies.  Unfortunately they were not crunchy, but dry, they lacked any real flavor.  I love almonds, so I was very disappointed. Not sure I will ever make these again, unless I totally revamped the recipe.

I didn't have any whole wheat flour in the house so I used all purpose for the whole 4 1/2 cups.  I used 8 oz pkg of Heath's toffee bits and 1 3/4 cup chopped pecans, other than that I stuck to the recipe.  The dough came out a bit dry and crumbly so I added a bit of egg substitute and a tsp. of softened margarine and mixed it in (I did use unsalted butter for the 1 cup) and it was fine.  The cookies turned out nice and crisp and irresistably good.  Thanks for a very good recipe.

These are awesome cookies.  These are the second most requested of the cookie recipes that I make (next to the chocolate chip cookies).

These are my family's favorite. Sometimes I include nuts; sometimes I don't. They're good with almond flavoring or vanilla. They are crispy and delicious.
