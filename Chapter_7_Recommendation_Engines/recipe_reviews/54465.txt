Awesome stew!!!   It was simple and easy to make.  I used a crock pot - and let it cook for most of the day.   I added a little more salt and pepper to suit my taste.

Maybe this is obvious, but I found it odd that the recipe didn't instruct you to brown the turkey first.  Also, I omitted the bacon, added a cup of lima beans and a dash of cayenne pepper for a better flavor.

This recipe had an odd mixture of flavours.  Also, I love salt, but even this was too much!  I recommend removing the regular salt altogether, and just keeping the garlic salt.
Overall, an interesting recipe, but not one I'll put into my regular meal planning.

This was an ok base recipe, I used chicken broth instead of water & cut out the bacon & salts. Needs a little fine tuning, I'll have to make some changes next time...

I followed others' suggestions and cut back the salt signficantly.  I also made this in the crock pot, cooked on low about 7 hours, with the ingredients layered in the order listed.  I would recommend decreasing the liquid if you are making this in a crock pot.  Also, next time I think I will cook the bacon on the side and serve it as a topping to sprinkle over; cooked with the rest of the ingredients, I was disappointed that it did not contribute much flavor.  Overall, good and my husband commented on the wealth of flavors -- will make again.

This recipe is basically ok, but 3 tsp. salt and especially 3 tsp. black pepper is way too much!
I cut out the salt entirely and added slightly less than a tsp. of pepper, but some in my
family still thought it was too spicy.  Other than that, though, we enjoyed it.

Thank you for the warnings about salt.  I didn't have any turkey or beef, so we used chicken.  I partially cooked the bacon in a skillet, just enough to draw out some grease, and then cooked cubed chicken in the bacon grease (yum).  Because the chicken and bacon were already partially cooked, I only cooked the stew for about an hour.  Turned out terrific!

Great recipe. Agree with others that the salt is too much. Here's how I decided to make it. Substitute ground buffalo (bison) for the turkey. Eliminate salt alltogether (diners can add to taste). Reduce garlic salt to 2 tsp and add 1 tsp minced garlic. I also added a diced shallot.

This recipe is a great dollar stretcher.  I like to add more flavor by taking the big pot I'm going to make the stew in and frying the bacon in it, removing it to add back in later, then caramelizing the onions in the reminants.  Follow the rest of the recipe as is, and when you add the potatoes to the pot make sure to get up all the good bits off the bottom of the pan with the potato water and it'll make it extra tasty.

A bit peppery for me, but this is one of those recipes that if I don't fix it, my husband will make it for himself...so it's gotta be good.

My grandmother used to make a tomato based turkey soup the day after Thanksgiving or Christmas and this was the closest recipe I could find.  The base of the recipe is good, I just made some changes to suit my tastes.

Changes:
Used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.
Omitted the salt, sugar, garlic salt and flour.
Added 1 clove of fresh garlic.
Added 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes.
Substituted water for chicken broth.
Also used fire-roasted peeled and diced tomatoes.

I thought the flavor was very nice and using bacon and chicken broth was enough salt for me. 

My version of this stew turns out more like a very chunky soup.  Yummy! Yummy!  I would make it again and again!

Pretty good, but a bit too spicy for my liking.  I think next time I'll use half as much pepper and an extra teaspoon of sugar.

Perfect guy stew.  It's easy and full of flavors. Salt could be an issue although it was perfect the next day and the day after that and the next day too! I used ground round.

I thought this was a really good recipe. I thought it could have used a little more spices than it had. I may try to tweek it a little next time I make it. My boyfriend totally fell in love with it. He said is was one of the best meals I've ever made him. He's happy with it, but as a cook I can taste when something needs to be added or not added. All in all it was a good recipe.

Only took a quarter of the time, but this was great!  Can't imagine if I had not done the shortcut method.   Wonderful depth, rich broth to be savored.

I'm not a huge fan of peas or corn so I substituted about 1/4 cup mixed, dried beans.  Didn't need the flour for thickening.  I liked that it used ground turkey instead of beef and next time will try with vegetarian crumbles. The bacon definitely adds to the richness in body.  I thought it was a good basic soup that could utilize leftover meat or veggies that needed to be used up instead of thrown out. With a nice baguette, some cheese and vino you'd have a pretty nice meal.

Very good!  I left out the bacon and went a little light on the seasoning.
