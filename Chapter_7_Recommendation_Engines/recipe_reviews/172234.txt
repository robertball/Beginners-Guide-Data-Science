Quiet, mellow flavors.  Perfectly understated, just as I like it, just as I wanted it.  Well balanced combination of the flavors, and I particularly liked the additions of nutmeg and lemon juice, which I didn't measure, just added to taste, probably less than what was called for.  The turmeric gives the orzo a brilliant yellow color which, in combination with the green kale (I used arugula because I grow it),  gave this a striking appearance. (Note to self: this might make a great dish for a Green Bay Packers party with its vivid colors of green and gold!) Other than seasoning to taste rather than adhering strictly to the given measurements, I wouldn't change this recipe at all and have absolutely no criticism.  It's lovely.

The flavors were delicious.  If i make it again I would put a little chicken stock with the kale and garlic while it is cooking.  My garlic burned and the kale was not soft and tender.

I have never had kale before and I got a bunch in my bountiful basket this weekend.  I found this and we LOVE orzo so I thought I would give it a try.  Not sure why you need the turmeric other than it makes your orzo a pretty color.  This makes a HUGE side dish.  I normally only make half a pound, but I wanted to follow the recipe.  Make sure you stem the Kale- it doesn't get soft and I was glad I did a good job on all but one leaf.  Kale is not bad, but I think the lemon juice and parm is a little on the light side for this much orzo.  I also found my kale starting to burn with no water just the evoo to cook it in and my garlic was clearly on the brown side.  If I did this again I would cook my garlic then add a little water or stock to steam my kale instead of cooking it in the oil.  Some of the pieces got really crispy.  Thanks for sharing overall it was good I would just make a few minor changes next time.

This is one of those recipes where you really wish there was a 10 star rating option. We absolutely loved this. The flavors are amazing.  I added some halved cherry tomatoes right before serving. Thank you so much! :)

Love this recipe.  I boiled 1 cup water add chicken bouillon cube and then added chopped kale to water to let it simmer until it softens.  Meanwhile, I sauteed mushrooms, carrots, red pepper and onion and added garlic, crushed red pepper, nutmeg and lemon juice,  seasoning salt and cumin. Cumin and lemon juice are excellent together. Drain kale and mix w/veggies and orzo. Fabulous.  I used only one cup orzo and it made 4 lunch sized meals.

DELISH! i took the suggestions of adding beans and cherry tomatoes and it makes the dish more filling for a main course. I also added red pepper flakes to the oil and garlic before adding the kale and it gave it a lovely kick!

I don't like Kale but my boyfriend makes me eat it because it is good for me.  So I was happy to find this recipe that combines orzo (which I love) with kale.  I followed some of the suggestions given by others.  I cooked the orzo the way we always cook orzo, cooked the kale the way we always cook kale, then combined them with the turmeric, lemon juice, nutmeg and parmesan cheese as a last step.

We normally cook orzo by cooking minced garlic in oil for a few seconds until fragrant, then we put the dry orzo in and toast the orzo for a few short minutes.  We also add some chili flakes, which some other suggested as well.  Then we add slightly more chicken broth than orzo and bring to boil then lower the heat and cook covered until the broth is absorbed and the orzo is soft.

As for the kale, we cook garlic in oil until fragrant, add a half cup broth, then bring to boil.  Once boiling we add the kale and heat until the kale is wilted and the liquid is absorbed.

The dish was good when I followed those steps and we both enjoyed the combination.  We will make it again.

this was really quite lovely. I added some white beans and pine nuts, and later when I had leftovers I added some sauteed mushrooms.  actually used the full amount of kale for half the orzo by accident, but it worked out fine.  nice recipe!

I thought two cups of orzo to be a bit much, so I cut it in half.

I really like the way the flavors combine in this dish--unusual and tasty.  The lemon brightens everything nicely.  Also, the turmeric gives the pasta a nice color.  I added some of the white wine I was planning to drink to the kale while it cooked for more continuity.

This was a great inspiration to use all that kale in my garden - but I went the shortcut route.  Brought chicken broth to a boil, added a few dashes of hot sauce and some salt and pepper (I used homemade chicken broth, if I used canned I would not add salt) chopped kale, cooked about 10 minutes, adding water as necessary then added the orzo.  Big hit at a dinner party with grill shrimp on to Definitely a keeper!

I have been making this recipe for a few years now- I can't believe I am just now reviewing it! Thngs I have learned from trial and error: When made as written, my kale always burns. After 3 attempts and always having gross, burnt kale, I simply learned to trust my gut and experience (I should have known better) to cook the kale on a lower setting than called for, and only until it's at my desired doneness. This is usually a lot less cooking time. Also, I feel like the amount of lemon juice in this recipe is just a bit too much, so I reduce it by about half. This recipe yields A LOT. so much so, that it can be a whole meal if I use whole grain pasta. But as a side, I usually cut the recipe in half (but often keep the kale at a full bunch, or I double the kale if I'm making the full recipe). Play around with this one and find what works for you. It's not perfect as-written, but it's good enough that I keep coming back to it.

This was SO GOOD! I sauteed garlic and onion and then braised the kale with chicken stock until it was soft. The other thing I did that was a little different was to melt butter & olive oil in a sauce pan, add tumeric and orzo and saute the orzo for a few minutes before adding chicken stock heated to boiling. I'm happy I made enough for lunch tomorrow!

I made some adjustments as suggested from previous reviews and turned this into a main course meal.  It was fabulous! 
I added a chopped red pepper to garlic saute.  I added 1 cup of white wine when I added the kale along with 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  And at the last 10 minutes of cooking I added a can of rinsed and drained white beans.  Excellent with these additions!

Great healthy side dish. I used low sodium chicken broth in place of the water. Next time I will probably add more garlic.

Wow, I had no idea this would be as good as it was.  My family really enjoyed it.  I was surprised at what a great combination these flavors were.  I made no special adjustments, but made this exactly as described.  Made a LOT.

I love kale & was used to eating it overcooked for years. That is how most people ate it. Since, I now know how much of the nutrients are destroyed by cooking too much, I learned to eat kale in a more chewy state & still enjoy it, especially w/garlic. Also, I know turmeric is very good for you, but have yet to taste it. I am looking forward to making this dish very soon. It should be delicious.

I've never reviewed a recipe before and finally had to with this one.  It is amazing.  I do tweak it just a bit by leaving out the turmeric, adding in some spicy italian sausage and probably twice the parmesan called for.  Makes for a complete meal and is so good!

Liked this, but think it would be better to cook orzo in just enough liquid to be completely absorbed. Might try chicken or veg broth with 1/2 the turmeric called for.

I have made this several times.  I always add more garlic and double the BABY kale stems and all.  The baby kale stems are finer and cook well. At the end, I add toasted pine nuts.. WE love it and is so easy and good for you.

I really liked this recipe, the flavor was mild. I think too mild for me. I will kick it up a notch next time cutting down on the orzo, so the flavor will be stronger.

Try this with a little chard instead of the kale.  I'm not a fan of kale, and I found it tough in this recipe.  If you have some leftover cooked collard greens, it would be delish, too.

This was so tasty!  I love the consistency of orzo with the kale.  I realized after starting, I didn't have a lemon so I left that out.  Also, I was worried the kale would burn so I added about 1/2cup vegetable stock to it.  This was delicious!  I will be making again, next time I will be sure to have the lemon too!

A bit too lemon-y for us.  It was ok once we put some tomato sauce on it, but to citrus-y for us to eat by itself.

I thought this recipe had great flavor. The only thing I did differently was add chicken stock after the kale cooked in the olive oil and garlic to help it get nice and tender. The recipe calls for "1/2 bunch kale," which I'm sure varies, so the next time I make this I think I'll up the kale or decrease the orzo so that they are more equal in ratio. I also added tomatoes as someone else had suggested.

I thought that this dish was fabulous!  I read the reviews and added chicken stock while cooking, and I added some cherry tomatoes for the last 6 minutes of cooking time.  I have tried this recipe with both kale and collard greens, and it is wonderful.  There is a lot of flavor in this dish.  I think that this may become a staple to my menus!

Great - I blanched the kale before sauting it.  Plus I added more parmesan and lemon.

This was amazing!  I made some modifications.  I added carrots, onions, and black beans to the mix to make it more of a main dish instead of a side dish.  I also steamed the kale in vegetable broth and for about half as long as the recipe calls for because I like my greens a little crispy.  I will definitely be making this again.  The parmesan cheese pulls it all together very nicely.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!!!

I followed the recipe and found this dish to be a little bland.  Would try to dress it up with a little more garlic, maybe some white wine and tomatoes next time.

I took everyone's suggestions and diced up some tomatoes and cooked them with the kale, garlic, and chicken stock at the end. I also baked some tofu and stirred it in at the end. The parmesan really made this dish I think. I didn't really measure the lemon or the nutmeg so I think I put in more than it called for but it was really good and filling and it used up my kale from the farmers market. The turmeric didn't make the orzo bitter at all. It was really good. Thanks for the great recipe!

I really wanted to just love this.  I had organic kale from the garden and I always need a healthy side dish.  Cooking the orzo with turmeric added a kind of bitterness to the pasta.  The kale, even with 20 minutes of sauteing did not soften it enough, and it was pretty chewy.  I might mess around with this one a little and perhaps use the recipe withou the turmeric, adding a little lemon juice to the pasta and some extra parmesan.

Flavors are wonderful. I removed garlic after it flavored the oil. Also added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes with the garlic. Added chicken stock to the first kale sauté and cooked at least 5 minutes less in total and upped the Parmesan to 1/3 cup to meet our  tastes. Add more olive oil when serve if you find it too dry and store left overs with 1/2 cup pasta liquid.

Agree with some of the other reviews. It could have used some broth or water to help cook the kale. Mine was still a little tough, and I stopped it from cooking earlier than suggested because it was burning and drying out. Enjoyed the touch of flavor from the turmeric and nutmeg. Adding a little chicken broth would have blended nicely.

This was okay.  First time I ever used turmeric in my cooking and it added an unique flavor to the orzo.  Wanted a different way to eat kale instead of eating it plain in a salad.  This was a fun change.

Excellent simple recipe. I think I will follow the other reviews next time and add a bit of water or chicken stock to the kale as its cooking because mine got very crispy on the edges and it didn't taste very good like that. I thought the flavor was delicious and it made me not miss the cream sauce or loads of cheese I normally put on my pasta!

My 3 year old loves this!  I made a couple of alterations for health and taste reasons - I use 1 cup whole wheat orzo with 1 cup regular, cooking the whole wheat 1 full minute before adding the regular, then keeping the time stated.  I also use chicken broth to cook the kale, just enough to keep it from sticking to the pan.

This is a great recipe - the yellow orzo is beautiful.  I thought the pasta-to-veg ratio was a little skewed to the pasta-side for my own taste.  

The second time I made it I used only half the orzo and added some halved grape tomatoes and toasted pine nuts.  The splash of red made for a very colourful side dish!

This is a winner.  The texture of the orzo works so well with the kale.  I left out the tumeric and the nutmeg and added red pepper flakes.  I steamed the kale before adding it to the garlic and oil.  I probably added a little more parm than called for, but it was soooo good.

We really enjoyed this dish. I made the mistake of having my pan too hot before adding the garlic, so it had a slightly burnt taste, but for a rookie, it was a minor mistake. We had this with chicken and our kids (2&4) both enjoyed it.

Wow! Definitely a recipe I will be making more often.  One suggestion I'd like to make is to be careful when you strain the orzo that has been boiling in the turmeric because it stains pretty easily, other than that, the whole family loved this recipe especially my 3 year old.

I made this as a hot dish with brown rice instead of orzo. I didn't use nutmeg because my husband dislikes it, and I added halved cherry tomatoes. It was very good. I'll be making it again.

I love the contrasting textures - the crispy fried garlic and kale with the smooth, soft orzo.  The lemon gives it a surprising brightness, and its just the perfect light summer dish!

it was ok but not that great. the orzo is way too much for that amount of kale. halve it(the orzo) and i think it is better. also needs something additional, maybe tomatoes, mushrooms or a legume. also, when cooking the kale it will overcook in just that olive oil. my garlic was brown/crispy and the kale not tender. i don't usually saute my kale that long(20min!) and it might have been better had i of followed all the other recipes i've used before with kale and that method.

This was just ok, and only after I added some tomatoes and bacon bits.  Maybe next time I'll try it with some chicken stock.

This recipe was very good. I cooked it with brown rice instead of orzo and my whole family loved it. Tastes great with yogurt on top.

This was good but not great. I followed the recipe exactly, but I ended up going back and adding more lemon and more cheese. I also has some trouble with the kale - it burned a bit and I kept having to add more oil. Worth making again, but it needs some adjustment.

It tastes like kale, lol but be ready for the slightly bitter, spinach-like taste. Great texture. Do add tomatoes after cooking, or some tofu, or some veggie sausage, or beans...for protein. Just stir them in the bowl at the end. Very good for you no doubt and a good balance of flavours. Might try rice in place of orzo. No modifications req'd!

I made this in hopes of give kale a chance. But nope nasty although the orzo was delicious. Nothing against this recipe kale just isn’t for me.

I liked this!
It's so different from anything else we eat regularly. It's simple. The kale gives a great flavor because it soaks up all the oil and garlic. I was skeptical, but the garlic really should just be sliced, not minced.
Next time I'll buy the kale the day I'm going to use it and experiment with the amount of lemon juice. (I added very little and couldn't exactly taste it.)

Made recipe as is. It came out great. I loved the beautiful yellow color the turmeric gave the orzo pasta.  Will make this again. I felt it could have used more lemon juice. Tasted great even before I added the cheese, for lower calories and less salt.

I made this with spinach, added white beans and grape tomatoes and it was delicious.  Will be a rotation here. Thanks again Bryna,  greatly appreciated.

Made this again with the Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs from this site, oh my goodness, everyone raved. Once again though, made with spinach.  I do cut back on the lemon, add no salt, use chicken broth as to not burn garlic.  Just laid the kabobs diagonal, finish off with a little parsley, beautiful presentation and DELICIOUS!!

Really yummy, I think I just didn't chop the kale as finely as it needed to be. There ended up being big bites of it which I wasn't really a fan of.

I'm glad I read the reviews first.  I added chicken broth while cooking down the kale, which meant it only took 10 min instead of the suggested 20 min.  I also doubled the parm, but that's just because I LOVE parm.  Maybe next time I'll try adding in some chicken too.

I really wanted to like this recipe. The kale and garlic seemed to burn.I will try again...but next time will blanch the kale then fry it on a lower temperature and for a shorter period of time. I did end up putting some feta cheese on top before serving to take away the burnt taste.

I did not have orzo noodles available, so I used brown rice. I added yellow peppers and tomatoe slices to make the meal more healthy. It was delicious. My mum and dad loved it! I will cook this again soon.

I love this recipe! The tumeric is a nice subtle taste and the color is fantastic. I have made this several times and will continue. One thing we've added as a standard is sun dried tomatoes. Also for leftovers, I heat it and then add fresh tomatoes and/or avocado.

I really wanted to like this, but the flavors didn't mesh well at all for me and the cooking method wasn't great either - if I had let the kale cook as long as it called for, it would have been burnt to a crisp.  If I ever tried to make something like this again, I would leave out the lemon juice and nutmeg and used minced garlic instead of slices.  But I doubt I would make it again, I think there are many tastier kale recipes on this site (and tastier orzo recipes as well, for that matter).  Glad I tried it, but it is definitely not for me, and the rest of my family disliked it even more than I did.

This was delicious!  Next time I would use a less orzo, maybe a cup, and more kale.  I would also put lemon on the side for people to add their own.  My kids thought it was too strong, even though I didn't use a whole lemon.

Not quite sure why all the great reviews.  We thought it was quite bland.  I tasted it after following the recipe and realized it needed doctoring.  I looked at other reviews and in a separate pan sautéed some cherry tomatoes and added garbanzo beans plus red pepper flakes and added that.  Still didn't give it the flavor to rate it highly.  Sorry!

As mentioned previously, this seemed to need a bit more, so I added a chopped medium-size tomato near the end of the sauteed kale, which I did in chicken broth not oil, with minced garlic and pearl onion. I also put the turmeric in near the end of the saute, then added the orzo to that pan and let it finish cooking with the black pepper there, adding parmesan at the very end.

This recipe was very tasty - even my husband liked it, which surprised me (I never thought he'd admit to liking kale)! I used lentils instead of kale, because that's what I had, and I added some shallots in with the garlic. Delicious, and very easy!

Good way to use kale if you have it and don't know what to do with it (like if you belong to a CSA). Will make this again. Also good with whatever vegetables you want to add, like eggplant, green beans, summer squash and/or tomatoes.

Delicious! As a vegan I omitted the parmesan and even without it this dish is a winner. I also tried making it with cous cous and it was good too. Thanks for this one!!!

I agree with cooking the kale with some extra dry sherry or chicken broth.  I also turned the heat down a bit.

The flavors did not mesh well together.  Like other reviewers mentioned, there was not enough liquid in cooking the kale and garlic, so the garlic burned and kale was tough.

very good, i didn't have kale so I subbed in spinach and it was excellent.  I also added some red onion and black eye peas for protein, thank you!

I'm giving it a 5 star even though I forgot the cheese so Im not sure how it is with that. However, it still tastes good without the cheese. I also suggest adding cherry tomatoes but they are not needed. My partner even went back for more. If I changed anything I would add the kale sooner to the garlic.

so so so good. I will definitely make this again! I left out the nutmeg - as i didn't have any adding paprika instead. I also added a bit more parmesan - my boy and I both LOVE cheese. It was perfect as a side dish with a roasted pork loin as well as for our impromptu picnic the next day!

I thought this was delicious. Lose the turmeric, add some red pepper flakes. A ten.

This was exceptionally good. My nine-year-old daughter even enjoyed it! The only suggestion I have is double the kale.

Love this recipe. I've made it for 3 events recently and have made it for myself at least 3 times.  Easy to put together and delicious side dish. The most important component of this meal is to make sure the kale/garlic doesn't burn. I find that the time indicated for wilting the kale is too long on my stove. It only takes me a few minutes to wilt the kale -- so be sure to keep an eye on this.  I continually get rave reviews (including the one time I burned the kale) for this dish from family and friends!

I'm sorry, but nobody really liked this dish. I followed the recipe exactly. I think the kale overwhelmed the orzo and its texture was unappealing.

My husband and I both liked this dish a lot.  I had never cooked with turmeric before but it had a great flavor.  There are a great mix some great bold flavors in this dish.  It was a keeper for us.

This was nice, but not great.  I had to add lots of salt and pepper to get a good flavor.  But, very healthy and pretty!  It probably would be better with the additions other reviewers recommended (beans, tomatoes, etc).  Has a lot of potential for experimentation though.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Rich varied flavor with two of my favorite under-used ingrediants.  I served with steak and peppers.  Will try it with fish next.
