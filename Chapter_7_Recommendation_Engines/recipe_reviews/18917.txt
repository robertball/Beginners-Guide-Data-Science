Only reason I rated this as 5 stars is 'cause 7 isn't available!  I made a couple of changes that (I think) made it el-perfectamundo!  Instead of orange juice I used grapefruit, and Malibu cocunut rum instead of dark.  Just happened to be what I had on hand, and I really don't see any reason to try it the original way once I have the actual ingredients on hand.

It does remind me of a "Sex on the Beach." Very simple to prepare. I used Grey Goose vodka and followed the recipe. I didn't think it was too strong but I only eyeballed the ingredients and didn't measure. Put it in a huge Pinot Noir glass with a little umbrella. I feel like I am on a cruise right now! Beautiful color.

This drink is very good.  The peach schnapps gives
it a sweet, the cranberry and oj give it sour.  A
good balance, not to sweet and not to sour.

Very good.  Peach Schnapps flavor strong at first, but then started to go down easy.  Used Ketel One Citron Vodka and Capt Morgan Rum.  Can't wait to try this one on my friends!

Actually I decieded to double the Vodka to 2oz, this is a really great stress reliever. Max 1 if you have to drive. For parties though I stick to the origional reciepe. Tastes like Sex on The Beach.

Very good but STRONG.  I used twice as much juice as the recipe called for and it was still pretty strong.  It was a stress reliever, that's for sure.

This is NOT the recipe for the drink commonly know to bartenders as Absolute Stress!! I'm sorry, but in these proportions this just tastes awful.  A true Absolute Stress is 1 oz. Vodka, .5 oz peach schnapps, 1 oz. Malibu (or other coconut) Rum, 2 oz cranberry juice, 1 oz. Pineapple juice.  Traditionally, absolute stress is a shooter and should be shaken over ice and strained, but it would be ok to drink over ice as a cocktail.

My bartender friends in college got me hooked on this drink, still my favorite after many years. I make it with Coconut Rum and use pineapple juice instead of orange juice. I also usually add almost 2 shots of vodka and 3 parts cranberry since this drink is very strong. I always make pitchers of these for parties and everyone loves it.

I had two of these last night, made a little stronger for my tastes, and I was de-stressed for sure. This is darn tasty, and not near as sweet as I thought it would be. I'd make this again.

I used Smirnoff vodka and Captain's Tattoo Rum.

This is good, but I also prefer the more traditional "Absolut Stress" from my days as a bartender: Fill a 12 glass with ice, pour in: 1 oz Absolute, 1 oz Malibu, 1 oz peach schnapps, add only a SPLASH of pineapple juice, and fill it up with cranberry juice. This is heaven, only... deadly!

I love cranberry juice and I love vodka so I tried this.  The picture by allrecipes shows a red drink, but mine was a pale color, not really red at all.  I was a little disappointed that the peach schnapps kind of over rode the cranberry taste.  I tried adding more cranberry and less schnapps and it was better but I think I'd leave out the schnapps all together next time.

I tried this recipe out just now, with a few modifications.  I find that peach schnapps tends to overtake all other smells and flavors, so I only used 1/2 fluid ounce.  I only had pineapple rum and grape juice, so I used both in place of the dark rum and cranberry juice.  I added 3 ounces of orange juice and grape juice to dilute the alcohol a bit more.  Garnished with two cherries and voila! A delicious, fruity beverage! I let my husband try it and never got it back.  Now I need to go make a new one.  This comes highly recommended!

A little too strong at the beginning, but when ice melts it mellows out.  A welcomed cocktail

Love it, love it, love it!  This is my favorite "beach" drink when we go out clubbing on Pensacola Beach!  Bamboo Willie's makes one that really kicks!  If you have it, be sure to use Absolut vodka - that makes a big difference.

I used just half an oz of the liqeuers & still added more juice. I don't have any peach schnapps so I used peach brandy...it worked ok. For the first one, I did use Mailbu rum (coconut flavored) but on the second (yes, I had two but remember I cut the alchohol in half ;o) ) I used Bacardi Gold (didn't have dark rum) & I liked the taste of it better. If I had gone on to make a third, I probably wouldn't have even cared what it tasted like. LOL

I didn't have orange juiceand it calls for vodka anyway, so I used Absolute Mandarin. Pretty strong drink, but just what the doctor ordered. Definitely going to become a favorite of mine. Going to be trying it the way it was written as soon as I get some orange juice.

This was awesome. This will take stess out of any ones life. I used 1/2 shot of each liquor. then 1 shot of each juice and lots of ice. Finished the glass off with more cranberry juice(which was probably another shot). The first one I made per directions and got knocked on my Butt. Thank You Great Drink

Pretty good if you want to get drunk fast.  I must be a pretty cheap drunk because after one of these i was done.  I couldn't really taste the cranberry juice like i wanted to and it was more of an murky orange color...nothing like the picture.  Might make again but add another ounce of cranberry juice

I messed up on this one.  Thought we didn't have the dark rum or vodka (should've known better--we have way too much alcohol!), so used vanilla vodka and coconut rum instead.  Come to find out we have both of what was called for.  Oops!  This drink was okay; a bit strong.  I didn't have any problem finishing it, but it wasn't my bf's or my favorite.  Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good. It was very strong, so I had to add some extra cranberry and orange juice. The taste wasn't amazing, but it was decent, and I can see myself making this again, if only to use up extra OJ and cranberry juice.

i made some alterations...i used bacardi o instead of dark rum, left out the peach schnapps. i made a jug of these for a graduation party. i used 1 part vodka, 1 part rum, 1 part oj, and 3 parts cranberry juice. everyone liked it, but i wasn't the awesome drink i was looking for. maybe i'll try the original recipe next time.

All my guests wanted the recipe.  I made it with fresh squeezed OJ, which seemed to make it a cut above, and vanilla rum. Also, used 1.5X both juices or one drink would knock out most ladies I know.

I had to triple the amount of the juice as otherwise it would have been too strong as a cocktail. Otherwise it tasted really good.

There's a flavor in here that I didn't love. I think maybe I went a little too cheap on my peach schnapps. Maybe with a better brand...

I like all the ingredients in this drink and I really expected that I would love it.  Unfortunately there was a weird after taste that I just didn't like.  It was ok, but I probably won't make it again.

Loved it after I made some small changes. All I did was use whipped flavored vodka instead of regular vodka and I added 1 ounce of pineapple juice to take the bite down a notch. 
Perfection!

I very seldom have a drink, but was in the mood for something fruity tonight.  I used the alcohol listed, but only used half the peach schnapps and tripled the orange and cranberry juices.  It was still plenty strong for me.  I think I would have liked it with a little un-cola pop added just to give it some fizz.  I will try that next time.

I love this.  I made my first one as written...give or take a little since my shot glass registers 1.5 oz.  It was a bit too peachy so second time I did less peach more vodka.  Better but....  third was same liquor as first splash oj more cranberry.  Think it was my favorite.  But after three really didn't care....  lol. Going to try subbing pineapple for the oj tonight.  Oh...and only rum I buy is Malibu so that's what I used.

My "absolute" favorite when I just want one drink. Love the fruit flavors! As another reviewer mentioned, I have made this with coconut rum as well as dark rum, and I think the coconut gives it a little better taste. Excellent!
