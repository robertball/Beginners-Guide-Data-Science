This patatas bravas recipe is excellent.  Very authentic!  I reduce both the amount of salt the potatoes are fried in and the amount of oil a little though.

These were very good.  The potatoes are very fluffy inside.  I did cut down on the amount of olive oil used, as it would have made this inexpensive recipe a lot more expensive and I didn't feel that it was necessary.  Thanks for the recipe

Tried to prepare the salsa today, and it was nothing like a proper salsa brava. It was far too bitter and far less sour than what I remember from Catalonia. And where is the cherry vinegar? That's a must in salsa brava.
Even after adding vinegar, some lemon juice, extra paprika and salt, and also some sugar to contrast the bitterness - there was still no saving this. Now it just tastes like ketchup.

These are the best patatas bravas I've tasted. Honestly, in my travels to Barcelona, I never had patatas bravas as good as these. Love these!!

Amazing, we've made this twice now. The first time we did it exactly as written.  (And it was exceptional.) 
The second time we used lard instead of oil, and hot smoked paprika. Also amazing!
