My son has celiacs and this is the best recipe I've found yet! I took the suggestion of using coconut oil. The batter was a little bumpy but they didn't stick to the waffle iron. I also used all chicken eggs. Very yummy and great fluffy texture with crisp outside. Really the best!!

Best gluten-free recipe yet! For a little healthy-fat, I substituted coconut oil for the applesauce and that just made them even better--plus they didn't stick so bad and came out crispier--bonus all the way around! Definitely a make again and again kind of recipe!

Agreed, Best gluten-free waffle recipe!  I usually have Greek yogurt available, so I use this as a substitute for the applesauce.  I also use this recipe for pancakes and eliminate the vanilla:) To add more nutrition I add:  1/8-1-4 cup of Flaxseed and/or substitute Stevia for the sugar!  I LOVE this recipe!!!  Kudos!

I was hesitant at first due to the work involved. I couldn't find another recipe that looked quite as good so I pushed through my reluctance! This was not difficult at all. I always read the reviews and try helpful hints ... So I subbed butter for the applesauce and used dairy. I had always considered duck eggs to be larger than chicken - and only having chicken, I added one extra. Excellent waffle!!

These are amazing!  I used all chicken eggs and cinnamon flavored applesauce.  My kids gobbled these up.  I plan on freezing the extra and putting them in the toaster for busy school mornings.

These were awesome!  It had been a long time since we'd had waffles because I was getting frustrated with other gluten free recipes.  My daughter was so excited to eat these.  They turned out really well!  I halved the recipe and used ground flaxseed in place of xantham gum and they were great!  Next time I will not cut the recipe in half.  I'll freeze the extra.  Thank you!!!

Very good would never know they are gluten free. The only thing I changed was I used all chicken eggs.  Made up the whole batch and froze them to put in the toaster.

I halved the recipe because this was my first time making it. That didn't seem to effect the consistency. I only used chicken eggs. I used coconut milk instead of almond. I was concerned about it sticking as it doesn't have any fat in it however, they didn't stick that much even without cooking spray. Crisp on the outside and warm and moist on the inside.  Consistency was very close to regular waffles. I would use almond milk or dairy alternative next time to avoid the coconut flavor. Overall very good. Wonder what buckwheat flour or adding oil to them would do. I baked the whole batter and froze them so I could pull them out in the hectic mornings. Thanks for the recipe!

These were fantastic waffles.  And not just fantastic for gluten free,  these were hands down fantastic waffles!  The only change I made was because I didn't have applesauce I added about 2 tbsps melted butter.   We cooked them with some chocolate chips and even my non-gluten friends wanted the recipe because they tasted better than the wheat ones.  They were crispy on the outside and fluffy and soft on the inside.    The batter is super thick (like paste) but we spread it on the waffle maker and they turned out just great.  Definitely a keeper!   They didn't last long enough to take a photo!

We LOVE these!  They're a frequent treat in our house.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Perfect!  Just add berries! Oh, & I like to smother them in coconut oil. Yum!

This is a great recipe. I used regular milk and all chicken eggs and it turned out great. Also added a cup of huckleberries!  Yum!!  For a family with celiac this is a keeper. Makes enough waffles for a small army so be hungry:)

This is a rockin' recipe.  Everyone liked it!  I am going to try the tips for less sugar and substituting coconut oil for applesauce.  The aroma when this are baking is absolutely divine. Yum--mie!

Awesome! Very light and fluffy! I didn’t have enough sorghum so I used potato starch. These are my revisions.  2 1/2 c sorghum, 1/2 c. Potato starch, and 1/4 c. Rice flour (because it wasn’t thick enough.) I also substituted the 1/4 c. Butter for the applesauce. I think that you could add more butter or oil to make it more crispy on the outside. Definitely a make again!

Fantastic recipe. So easy, so few ingredients, my whole family loves them. I've only ever used chicken eggs and I only keep cinnamon applesauce cups on hand, so I always use one of those. I have a ceramic, non-stick iron, so I omit the oil. I do freeze them & pop them in the toaster, so they make a great, easy breakfast for my GF son. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.
