The submitter, Kathy, is right! These really do taste like pizza--and without the guilt!  I used large portabella mushrooms which made this a "meatier," hearty and more substantial dish.  I rubbed the mushrooms with a bit of olive oil before baking on a cookie sheet at 350 degrees, about 15 minutes. Topped them with the shredded mozzarella and popped them in the oven for another 5 minutes.  Rather than as an appetizer, I could easily see this as a light, carb-free main dish.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Kathy!

These were wonderful and loved by all.  We made 48 of these using the large stuffer mushrooms and also used some different cheeses and pepperoni for the ones that don't care for sausage.  Big hit and so yummy.  Thanks for sharing.

I made these for Christmas dinner, and they were delicious! I realized after they were baked that I forgot to add the spaghetti sauce, but it was great without it. :) Thanks!

These were so good. I used 1 c. of Italian sausage, 1c. of chopped pepperoni, and a 3oz. pkg. of cream cheese, used as the binder, plus the other ingredients that were written.I put a couple TBSP. of sauce in the meat mixture. Heated on top of the stove till all incorporated. Let cool a little so you can handle them ;then stuff. The rest of the sauce I put in the dish when I baked the mushrooms. Excellent.

AWESOME!!  So easy to make. I used hot/spicy sausage instead of italian for a kick and I added a little extra spaghetti sauce.  Cooking was fast and clean-up was easy.  I have already shared this recipe with all my co-workers!

To liven it up a little I used ½ mild & ½ spicy Italian sausage. Because it was in 1 lb. packages, I was forced to use the other half for breakfast the next morning with scrambled eggs. Oh well...

WOW - this was great! We used 2 portabella mushrooms so I only fried 1/2 a roll of sausage with the rest of the ingredients as the recipe shows. I baked them for 15 minutes without cheese then sprinkled it on and continued baking until the cheese melted. This made a great main course for our meal. Thanks so much for the recipe - we'll definitely have it again soon.

These were just okay.  I've had much better stuffed mushrooms.  I think I'll keep looking for another recipe.  They may be much better minus the spaghetti sauce.

WOW!!!  This was very easy to make.  I added a little cheese to the mix before I stuffed the mushrooms.  I also refrigerated the the stuffed mushrooms for 2 hours prior to cooking them.  I will definitely make this again.

Love 'em!!  I reduced the quantity of ingredients and stuffed two portabello mushrooms and served each with salad.  They really do taste a lot like pizza. YUMMMMM...and super easy!

I made this at Christmas time.  I thought it was just OK, but to be honest, everyone there gobbled 'em up.  So I guess they will stay on my rotation.

I really enjoyed this!  It was something different & simple and was a good meal served with a salad.  The only change I made was I used white onions instead of green & added a little garlic powder while the sausage was frying.

Took these to party and they disappeared very quickly, got good reviews. I did not have mozza on hand so used fresh grated parmesean instead. Used hot Italian sausage and left out the onion.  Will definitely make again.

Simple for a weeknight meal.  I cooked for the stated time, and the mushrooms were not very tender.  I recommend cooking for longer and maybe adding the cheese on at the end.

These were good and pretty easy.  My only complaint is that we had way too much stuffing, even though we used extra mushrooms and they were BIG!  We wanted to use the leftover stuffing for breakfast with scrambled eggs (which probably would have been great) but forgot.  The mushroom caps were yummy, but pretty juicy - you had to lean over to eat them, or risk getting juice on your shirt.  Something to keep in mind if making for a family get-together.

My husband loved these. Used spicy italian sausage. Did a can of tomato sauce and added italian seasoning and garlic salt. mixed mozz and a little parm cheese into stuffing mixture. Also added a couple tablespoons of italian breadcrumbs. Didn't add any cheese on the top. Served with some plain pasta. Yum!
