Yes, this was simple, and made with ingredients I had on hand! I used the juice of half a fresh lime, one clove of garlic, and instead of thyme I used a handful of fresh oregano, rosemary and basil. Instead of grilling, I baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, and it did the trick! Very tasty. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe.

I used Rockfish and tilapia and substituted the juice of a lemon for the lime because that's what I had ... it was healthy, delicious, and so easy!

We used the marinade as written on one large lake trout fillet (just under a pound).  Let marinate in a glass baking dish for approx. 2 hours, then put in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes (leaving marinade on the fish).  Very flavorful, easy, and tasty.

I have served this many times.  Best cooked on the barbecue, but also excellent roasted at 425F for about 10 minutes.
Add extra garlic to the marrinade,  and serve simply with more lime wedges, along with a side of something with color and texture contrast, like wild rice and green beans.

I was looking for something simple and full of flavor and this did the trick. I didn't have fresh thyme but was goes great with lime, fresh cilantro of course. Keep other ingredients mostly same, omitted pepper, used a Chile lime seasoning I had on hand. It is 15 degrees here, so no grilling! Broiled in oven with marinade on for about 10 minutes

It was good for a simple recipe.  I doubled everything but the pepper and thyme so it might be because of that...  The mango salsa tilapia blew me away and this one just didn't.  But good in a pinch.

I baked it in the oven at 375 and then broiled it briefly. My family liked it,  but I would use a little less lime juice next time.

was somewhat disappointed.    I bought fresh trout and followed this recipe exactly and it was somewhat bland.    Perhaps the flavor of Tyme as the primary flavoring is not good by itself unless you really like tyme.   I would not make this again although it was easy and healthy....
