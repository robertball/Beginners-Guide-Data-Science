Great recipe. Easy to follow for such an authentic flavor.  I'm not sure if I added too much pasta. I didn't have as much liquid as I would have liked. I'm remaking today.  Yum!

Nice flavor. I used scallops instead if chicken and it was good. A little over powering but will cook again.

Delicious!!  I used a whole can of light coconut milk and I made rice noodles.  They were not added to the soup but added to each bowl before the bubbly soup was poured in.  The broth was very flavorful!!

I travel, and had something very similar in Kowloon. This was gorgeous and as authentic as it gets. I didn't put so much pasta, but that's because I prefer it with less.  Lovely.

This is a great recipe. I followed the soup base as is and just threw in the veggies I had on hand (tomatoes, carrots, bamboo shoots, button mushrooms, green onion) it turned out amazing! I used the whole can of coconut milk and a whole can of chicken stock. It was the perfect consistency. This is a very flexible recipe, you can definitely make it your own and it will still turn out amazing. The lime to brighten up the dish was key!

this was great! I added a little squeeze of lime juice to each plate.  I would double the liquids because they got sucked up by the pasta, and I like having the soup at the end of the bowl.

The flavors were spot on and delicious. But it was more of a pasta dish than a soup. If I made it again I would consider increasing the amount of stock and decreasing the amount of pasta.
