5 STARS, BUT ONLY WITH THESE ALTERATIONS:  The point of bean cake is our health, so I made the following changes.  Reduce sugar from 2 cups to 1 1/2 cups.  Substute most of the oil for applesauce, (I used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce).  To eliminate even more sugar (and the fat from the pork), I used a 16 oz. jar of home-canned black beans in place of the baked beans with pork.  To hide the beans, I substituted 3 Tbsp. cocoa powder for the 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  I also have a wheat grinder, so I ground fresh whole wheat flour and substituted it for the white flour.  I left out the raisins.  With these changes, you can transform this recipe into a DELICIOUS, HEALTHY CHOCOLATE BLACK BEAN CAKE.  Yum!

Yes, just like everyone else, I too was skeptical.  But let me tell you all, delicious!!! Don't change a thing. Follow the recipe and it will turn out great. I have a pet peeve, when people don't follow the recipes and change things around then give less than 5 stars, it makes me mad. Very good cake. I made the 2 loaves. Tastes like a pumpkin type flavor. I will definately make it again and again. Thanks for the submission.

Very tasty and moist! I replaced all of the oil with applesauce and made muffins (baked about 30 min) and they turned out great!

Does this really turn out as good as you think it would? No.....it's BETTER. I don't use two cups of sugar, one is plenty and I also use butter or margerine instead of vegetable oil. Instead of just cinnamon, I'll add two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and I soak my raisins in hot juice or rum (making sure to drain them well) before adding them to the batter. It is one of those spice cakes where people remark on "OMG, this is SO good....how did you make it?" and then once they find out, they HAVE to make it themselves so they can fool someone else. This is also good as cupcakes with a Cream Cheese Frosting. GREAT for White Trash Parties!

This cake is moist and tastes great!  I do suggest mashing the beans, otherwise you end up seeing whole beans in the cake.  Also, I replaced most of the oil for applesauce (maybe 4/5 applesauce to 1/5 oil), and I used only 2/3 of the amount of sugar that it called for.  The cake still comes out very sweet.  Great idea to use beans to sneak in some extra fiber!

This cake is one where people say, "mmmm, what's this?" after tasting it, and the look on their faces is quite amusing after you tell them there's a can of pork and beans!  My roommate made this for a dietetics class once, and she said that nobody could tell what it was made out of!  So it's kind of a joke that we make it for each other's birthday every year now.  but it really is pretty good, nice and moist and it does in fact taste similar to a spice cake.  I haven't tried any type of icing or frosting, but I have made this cake quite a few times, and though people may be hesitant, they will surprise themselves after tasting this one!

I don't know if it is because I know the beans are in there, but I can taste them.  It's OK.  Definitely fun to make and share.

Mom said it was easy to make and it tasted WONDERFUL. She asked Jeanie to taste it and she did, and Mom said can you guess what is in the bread? Jeanie said ummm Raisins, walnuts, she couldn't guess the Pork n Beans and she just loved it. Mom said she is taking one to work for her friends to try. She said she will make it again....as she does love Pork n Beans on toast....

Great recipe.
I too was very lary of the way this cake may taste. but what a surprise its wonderful.
I made it for after dinner tonight and my husband and daughter had no clue as to how it was made they just knew it was wonderful tasting and wanted more.
i told my daughter how i made it and she was very surprised and said you are kidding me.made with baked beans.
I did change a couple of things, i used 2 cups less 3 tablespoons of white sugar and i used 1 cup of extra virgin olive oil instead of veggi oil and i used 1 cup white flour along with 1 cup whole wheat flour, i threw in 3 tablespoons of ground golden flaxseed, and i used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 1.i will cut back more on the sugar next time but this is for sure a keeper and a great recipe to share with friends and family and let them guess whats in it

I disagree  w/the reviewer that said  the point  of this bread isour health. the point is for it to taste good and give pleasure. If  you make it as written it will do just  that and when you reveal to people what is actually  in it you get to giggle at  their  surprised  looks.

Made this with some substitutions. Used whole wheat flour, beans in tomato sauce (it's all we had and eat) splenda and mostly applesauce with maybe 3 tb of oil. Also added more cinnamon than called for, and some nutmeg. Cake was very good and will make again, with some more revisions. I will add quite a bit more seasoning next time - cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie etc. This made 2 - we added nuts to one. It was our favourite so will add more nuts next time.

I found this recipe today and made it. I was sooo excited cause it was something different and it sounded yumm. Like past comments I only used one cup sugar,one cup white flour & one cup whole wheat flour and used plenty of cinnamon and added a dash of nutmeg. I did'nt have nuts or raisins but this taste sooo goood, you cannot even taste the beans at all I mean not one bit. I will def make this again and take it to events & boy will they be surprised when they learn what's in it. I also made a buttercream icing and covered it quite generously.

First of all, I did make a couple of changes.  This is what I changed.   For the oil, I used 1/2 cup of grapeseed oil and 1/2 cup of plain fat free Greek Yogurt.  Based upon other reviews, I decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cups and increased the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons.  As for the pork and beans, I used a 99% vegetarian pork and bean that I ran through my food processor to puree them.  I added raisins and pecans pieces(found in the baking isle).  When hubby got home, he tried them, really liked them, then I told him what was in them. He was really surprised but said it allowed him to try them with an open mind.  He also said they are really, really good.  Even asked if I could try making them in lemon flavor, lemon poppyseed, or vanilla by using a white been.  Lol...he's all into this.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Almost forgot to mention, I made this into cupcakes.  Baked them for about 18 minutes, but that time will vary depending upon oven.  Happy snacking.

Three stars because its definitely unique!  I thought, with the addition of much more spice, it was a tasty and moist quick bread.  Had left over baked beans from dinner and decided to make a loaf of this bean bread.  It may be psychological but I felt like it had a grainy texture, reminiscent of added fiber.  A quick recipe worth trying.

Awesome!  Banana/Zucchini/Pumpkin bread-ish. Kinda on the sweet side, but great texture, color, and flavor.  I wish I had the cans because that would just add to the class of the whole thing.

Very interesting. I was looking for stuff to do to use up my baked beans and came across this and knew even if it turned out horrible I had to try it. It's actually really good. I used Heinz baked beans in tomato sauce. I ran out of white sugar, so it ended up being about 1.33 of white, and another third of brown.  It made 4 mini loafs and 6 muffins. I was a little weary tasting it knowing what had gone in, but it's quite good. The rains are a good addition as well.  It doesn't look like the main picture, but more like the ones other people have uploaded of a very light bread.

Excellent!  Love the looks from co-workers when you eventually tell them what kind it is.  I, too, smooshed the beans so it wasn;t obvious.  In loaf pans it took mine 65 minutes to cook.  I also dusted the cooled cakes with powder sugar before serving.

I was skeptical about this recipe, but it was a HIT at the office.  I made it again, substituting the raisens for bacon bits and peanuts and I cut the sugar in half - amazing. I also used applesauce instead of oil to make it healthier.

i halved the recipe and substituted the eggs because my cousin was allergic to eggs...and ended up with it not really binding well and crumbling all over the place! the taste was nice but i thought it was way too sweet because the beans are quite sweet in the first place. next time i'll probably cut down on the sugar.

Pretty darn good! I used maple beans, and pureed them to make them creamy. Using maple beans makes it really sweet, so I suggest reducing the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 cup or so, and adding 1/2 tsp salt. Then maybe some cream cheese icing...mmmm...  I need more recipes that use beans as an ingredient (other than chili!)

I was quite surprised by this recipe. I didn't have any baked beans, so I used a can of kidney beans instead, which I decided to smash up. I omitted the raisins and was able to make 2 loaves. It was very good.

This is so moist and yummy.  I glazed it with a powdered sugar icing and it made it so sweet, not that it wasn't sweet already.

I will certainly make this again, even though it is hard to get past knowing what is in it.

Thanks for the recipe.

I was surprised on how this cake came out!   Everyone liked it.  It does taste like a spice cake.  I made a few alterations, I only used 1 1/2 cu sugar and I omitted the raisins(my son doesn't like them) I mashed the beans up and I topped it with a light simple  glaze.  It was a hit!

This cake was very moist.  I did as others suggested and used applesauce instead of vegetable oil.  I also used 1 and 1/3 cup sugar instead of 2 cups.  I love raisins so I added slightly more then the optional amount.  I also mashed the baked beans with a wooden spoon in a separate bowl (as best as I could) before adding them to the mixture.  My work colleagues and friends had no idea that baked beans were an ingredient!  They truly enjoyed the recipe, and so did I.  Also I used part of the batter to make muffin-cakes (huge hit) and the other part I put into mini loaf pans.  I cooked them each for 25min, then when that time was up I did the toothpick test and proceeded accordingly.  In my non-convection oven they both cooked for about 30 min. I fill my mini loaf pans about 3/4 of the way to get a baked result that is slightly under the top of the pan. Thanks for this recipe, I will be making it again!

Unbelieveable!  You would never guess the beans are in there.  Hubby thought it was pumpkin bread.  I used applesauce instead of oil

I am making this right now and it looks like it is going to be wonderful!!  It's my friend's birthday and she is a health nut so I didn't want to make a regular cake for her. I am using a round pan instead of loafs to make it look more like a birthday cake and I'm going to ice it with a powdered sugar frosting. (not really healthy but come on...you can only be so healthy on your birthday!) We work together and I am bringing it in to share with everyone so I will update this to reflect their reactions! (I only gave it 4 stars so far because I haven't tasted it yet. This may change...we'll see) I subbed most of the oil for applesauce and used baked beans without pork (shes a vegetarian) I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar.

Loved this recipe!!!  I halved the white sugar and also used one cup brown sugar instead.  I added golden raisins and walnuts and some allspice.  Next time I will try it with splenda.  Yummy!

Great way to get rid of baked beans. I had a 28oz can of vegetarian baked beans so I used that and didn't add any oil.  I tasted it before baking and decided to add some pumpkin pie spice to go make it more like pumpkin bread (because it definitely has the coloring for it).  I also put it in one loaf pan and it worked out fine.  Overall, pretty good, moist,  but not a recipe that hits it out of the park.

easy to make, very moist.  I did cut 1/2 cup of sugar out (1 1/2 C. total) and 3/4 C. applesauce and 1/4 C oil.  Took a loaf to work everyone thought it was good and were surprised that it contained pork n beans.  No one could get over how moist it was.  It's a keeper.
