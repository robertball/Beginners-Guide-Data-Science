Great recipe I could run with and make into healthy breakfast/snack muffins my own way with healthier ingredients and on hand pantry items. Really easy!

Fabulous flavors all mixed up together.  I didn't like the "frosting" and it really doesn't need it.  Might toss some mini chocolate chips in next time.  Wonderful cake!
