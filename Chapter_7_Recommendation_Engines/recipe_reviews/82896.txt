Wow, this sauce was very bland, but has potential.  I made a few changes for improvement to perhaps 3.5 - 4 stars.  The changes are in lieu of the original ingredients.  Use:  1.) 12 oz. Solid White Albacore; 2.) 14.5 oz can Hunt's Diced Tomatoes, undrained; 
3.)  Use 8 0z. chopped black olives; 4.)  use 3 cloves pressed garlic cloves, 1 tsp dried basil and 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes; 
5.)  Add 3 TBS capers (these really make a difference!); and 
6.)  Top with grated Romano cheese for extra flavor.   
Allow flavors to blend in refrigerator before serving.

Even though I made a few minor changes, I gave this five stars because it's a great basic recipe - it's simple, easy, and a big hit with my family. And I always adjust recipes to suit my own taste, anyway. I added rosemary, capers and sea salt. I had no tomato puree, so I used crushed and whole tomatoes, broken up (with a pinch of sugar). It's important to use the solid white, not chunk light tuna. I used 12 oz of solid white and didn't add it until cooking was almost done, so that it would not disintegrate. I was very liberal with the olive oil and garnished with lots of fresh basil.

The only thing I'd do different with this recipe is either double the recipe for the sauce or not make as much Angel Hair.  It seemed like there was more pasta than sauce, which I don't like.  Either way, the sauce was really good.  I'd make it again with the said adjustments.

This was really good and, honestly, better than I expected.  
Used 3 cloves garlic, since we're garlic lovers.  Substituted 15oz can of tomato sauce as we did not have tomato puree.  Worked fine, though probably would be better with crushed/pureed tomatos.
Considered doubling the tuna, but think now it would be too strong.  This is just enough tuna that you can taste it, but it doesn't overwhelm.  Great stuff.

I liked this recipe a lot. I did use Italian styled diced tomatoes and omitted the tomato puree. I have made this several times. its a good fast dinner and I have all the ingredients in my pantry.

I was a little hesitant about the tuna tomato sauce comb.I didn't have white chunk tuna so I used what I had, it was fine. Also didn't have the olives but it was still good. You can also brown some bread crumbs in a pan and add on top the pasta, pretty good. Quick and easy, excellent recipe.

I substituted stewed tomatoes for the canned tomatoes and canned tomato sauce for the tomato puree.  I also added a dash of tobasco and the recipe was fantastic.  My boyfriend and I both loved it!

March 7, 2006 Review:  I couldn't decide between 3 1/2 or 4 stars for a rating, so I think a low 4 stars would be adaquate.  It was good, nothing sensational, but something different.  It's a really mild (bland) flavor.  I did sub the whole peeled tomatoes for diced tomatoes, so maybe that would have made the difference between good and great. 5/4/06 UPDATE:  I have changed my rating of this recipe based on the fact that I had so much extra sauce, I had to freeze it.  It's still in my freezer, I know we'll never eat it, and I hate looking at it!

This is one of my standby recipes. Love it. I usually add some red pepper flakes for a little spice, too.

My husband and I just moved and needed to make dinner with the few ingredients we had on hand, and this recipe was just what we needed! It was easy, doesn't use a lot of ingredients, and doesn't take that long to prepare. The only changes we made were using a can of just normal tuna instead of the white tuna, substituting one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce for the tomato puree, and adding one beef bouillon cube to the sauce for flavor. And this was super tasty! We totally plan to make this recipe again!

I think the sauce was very metallic. I personally did not enjoy the flavor. I followed the recipe as written. It was easy and relatively cheap to prepare.

We do not particularly like canned tuna, so I used grilled, marinated tuna instead.  Only other changes are that I used fresh basil and added 1 tsp. red pepper flakes.  The flavor is unique and very good.  I can't quite bring myself to rate the recipe 5 star, but it is a strong 4 star.
