Made it with a home-made cake rather than store bought, but I needed to know how to do a strawberry shortcake and used this recipe for the berries and cream part. The strawberries turned out super delicious with a nice looking glaze from the melted sugar - like strawberries on a store bought, pre-made cake. Used cool whip and they went great together. I was worried that I needed to make a strawberry spread as well to layer with the cool whip, but it was plenty sweet with the cool whip and sugary strawberries, so there was no need. Plus once I put the strawberries on the cool whip, some of the juice melted into the cool whip anyway, made it even more delicious. Also did this with raspberries, and they turned out just as delicious. Very quick and easy, plus it looks pretty so guests will be impressed. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not a big fan of these dessert cups, but it worked in a pinch for a dessert to serve. I think I prefer angel food cake or pound cake. However, the berries and syrup are just right.

This was delicious! I made homemade spaghetti sauce and Italian meatballs to incorporate into my families dinner, and this was the perfect dessert to follow it. Something light and fruity tasting. The only thing I did differently was add on a strawberry reduction sauce to add a little more strawberry flavor! (Not that it wasn't flavorful my tastebuds were tingling it was so delicious)

One of my granddaughter's favorite desserts to make. My granddaughter is always asking me to buy the petite shortcakes. She loves the whipped cream the best.
