I made this rub at the last minute on Thanksgiving day.  The only change was to add a Tablespoon of salt.  I rubbed it under the skin, in the cavity and all over the outside and the bird turned out fantastic!  I highly recommend this recipe.  I'll problably never inject marinade in deep fried turkey again.

This recipe was phenomenal! I have never fried a turkey and was very hesitant.  I got a great deal on the fryer equipment on Craigslist so I had to try it. I rubbed the spices inside and out, and under the skin after drying the turkey very well. I also cut off the tail for a better flow of oil. I did add the 1 T of salt as another reviewer suggested and since we canâ€™t stand oregano I used basil instead. I also used Cracker Boy Original instead of a Creole spice.  I let the bird sit in the refrigerator overnight. About an hour before the frying I let the bird sit out. If you mix the spices well you will not have clumps of any one seasoning in one spot. When I strained the oil with cheesecloth for the next use, (which will be this week) there was hardly any herbs in the oil, they mostly remained on the bird. Thank you for posting this recipe, I will use it again and again, and doubt I will ever roast another bird!

Made this last nite didn't change a thing and it was great!! Everyone wanted the recipe. Can't wait to try on chickens in my ronco.  Just be sure to let it sit for 24hrs before frying, cooking.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was our first attempt at frying a turkey. We used this recipe for the Turkey Rub and also injected it with a jar of Creole Butter for the marinade. We had no leftovers.

EXCELLENT! We not only did the rub (and not 24 hous in advance) but we enjected the turkey with a garlic marinade before deep frying it. Every said it was the best turkey they had ever had!

This is the first time I tried deep fried turkey! I thought we messed up and turned 'tweety' into a chunk of charcoal! I made this rub and added rosemary into the mix. My food processor was a great tool for get everything chopped up good! I rudded 'tweety' down and had quite a bit of rub left over so I put about half cup of white cooking wine in the bowl, stirred and let it sit for awhile to blend then I dumped it into the brest cavity to marinate. After about 10 hours on its back I flipped it over onto the brest. I also injected it with apple cider beer. My crispy critter turned out to be very good despite that and everyone loved it! The marinaded juices even got used for 'big bird' in the roaster and made great gravy!

What a great rub!  Like other stated, the taste mellows a ton after deep frying.  I worried it would be too spicy but it was great.

WOW!! This was so good. I followed the instructions exactly. I marinated the turkey for 2 days and really agree that it made a world of difference. The herb flavoring really penetrated the meat and was so delicious. We had a large family dinner and everyone raved how amazing the turkey was. I was pretty impressed. This is definitely a rub you should try!

This IS the perfect rub.  I've tried others, but they only make me wish I'd used this one.  I used a mortar and pestle to grind the bay leaves in my first few endeavors, and got  a real workout in my forearms.  Switched to my old, forgotten Braun coffee grinder and the job is done literally in seconds.  Seal the rubbed-down turkey in a 2-1/2 gallon zip-lock bag, and refridgerate for 8 to 24 hours -- HEAVEN!

I love this recipe, it makes a great rub.  I like mine a little spicier so I add more creole seasoning and a touch more garlic, but other than that I have used this for 2 years I think.  Another tip, make sure the turkey is almost completely dry before applying the rub, otherwise you get a lot of run off.

10 STAR RECIPE. I followed this recipe exactly as written on the very first turkey i have ever deep fried. 3 years ago. I have done all my turkeys using this recipe since then. (i do 2 turkeys each holiday) I will never cook a turkey any other way or use any other method of seasoning. Everyone who was here raved and raved how it was the best turkey they have ever had. Thank you hebegebe for sharing this treasure of a recipe.

I have been frying turkeys for 5 years now and this is by far THE BEST turkey I have ever had.  The simple combination of herbs and spices makes the turkey 1000% better.  I only had it 'marinating' for less than 24 hours, I can only imagine what a full 48 hours would have done!

I made this rub for my Thanksgiving turkey last year and had to google it to find it again for this year. I also used the creole butter injection kit and injected the turkey all throughout. The end result was one of the juiciest turkeys ever. Can't wait to do it again this year...

This was fantastic!! It's a wonder someone didn't lose a finger picking at the skin while it was being carved. The meat was super flavorful and moist.

I've used this on both chicken and turkey in the smoker too.  It's the only rub I'll use now.  Cut the bay leaves by 2/3 and added a little vegetable oil to make a paste for rubbing.  Awesome.

We made this recipe for one turkey for Thanksgiving and roasted another.  Everyone really liked this one better.  Although, I would still do both because the roasted one will provide the gravy and leftovers.  Last year we brined our fried turkey the night before.  I prefer this recipe (tasted great and less mess).  We have quite a bit of leftover rub that I will keep for perhaps a fried chicken.  We also injected with creole butter prior to frying.  Delicious - not too spicy and not greasy at all!  Even the kids loved it.

Very good. A lot of the rub cooked off of my turkey and some spots had an overdose of pepper, but over all very tasty.

First time deep frying a turkey and this rub was fantastic and the turkey was moist and delicious.  I marinated it for 24 hours with the rub and the flavour was bang on!  New family tradition for Canadian Thanksgiving.  Maybe it just will be.

First time deep frying a turkey. I did two!! This tub was fantastic. I only applied it 12hrs prior to frying because I was late getting the turkey fully thawed. But it didn't matter. Everyone loved it!! I got a scribbled copy of the rub, so the last two ingredients were tablespoons!!

Will DEFINITELY use this next time.

3 years in a row using this rub for deep frying turkey the best. This year Iâ€™m trying something a bit different since I have been reading how great dried brining is so after I applied the run I then dusted the bird with Kosher salt and it will sit for about 36 hours will see.

Used this rub recipe for our thanksgiving turkey and it was amazing! I did add smoked paprika and sage to it and I ground up the bay leaves in my coffee grinder.  I was so impressed and so were all of the guests we had over for thanksgiving!!

Was excellent and got rave reviews from the family.  Only thing I added was a little salt to the rub. Will be our yearly rub from now on!

Tried this recipe a few years ago on a whim, it is hands down the best.  So good!  I also rubbed it under the skin, it turned out great.  Using it again this year.

Made this for our deep fried Christmas turkey and it was fantastic. At first I thought that there were too many bay leaves ( 25 is a lot) but everything was delicious. I used a small coffee  grinder to grind the bay leaves into a fine powder.

This was perfect!   At my office we each brought in a turkey to fry; 5 in all.   Everone used an injected marinade recipe except me.   This dry rub was unanimously rated the best of all the turkeys by far.  Delicious flavor.  Thanks for the great rub recipe.

Excellent recipe, but I would reduce the Creole seasoning next time because it turned out so salty, didn't realize it was so much sodium in this seasoning. Our turkey looks burned but that's what happens when fried, it's just the skin it was nice, tender and juicy.

Perfect, I just did my first deep fried turkey and it was perfect.  I did my research and used this rub and it was all gone after dinner even the bones were picked clean.  I wouldnt change anything.
