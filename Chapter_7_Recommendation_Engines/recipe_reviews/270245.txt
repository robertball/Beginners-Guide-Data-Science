This was creamy, cheesy, deliciousness! At 20 minutes mine already had the brown spots and I didn't have to broil. The one thing I will say though is go easy on the salt. The recipe states to salt in two separate steps but I recommend stopping after the first. Other than that, this was perfect and one that would wow your guests.
