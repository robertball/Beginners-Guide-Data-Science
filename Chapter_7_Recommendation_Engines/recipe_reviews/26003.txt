This was overall a good recipe.  I doubled the amount of sugar in the cake but omitted the chocolate on top, as well as the orange liqueur.  It was still not too sweet but tasted more like a dark chocolate.  It looked very pretty sliced on a dessert plate that had been drizzled with chocolate syrup! My family liked this dessert, and we will be making it again.  Remember to close container tightly in fridge for storage so the cake will not dry out.

This was an excellent recipe, although I added raspberries along with the strawberries and dispensed with the chocolate sauce.
