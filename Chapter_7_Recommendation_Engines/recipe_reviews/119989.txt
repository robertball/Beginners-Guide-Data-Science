Here are my adjustments to this delicious recipe:
I doubled it, used 1 can cream of mushroom & 1 can cream of celery (both Healthy Request type) instead of the cream of chicken, added 1/8 t. red pepper, 1/4 t. black pepper, 1 t. celery seed, used 1 T dried minced onion instead of chopped onion, and omitted the sliced celery.  The flavor was really good.  Next time I will use crushed corn flakes (approx. 2 cups with 1/4 cup margarine) instead of saltines.  My family loves lots of "crunchies" on top.  The doubled recipe fit nicely in a 9x13 pan.

This recipe was really tasty and easy to make. I didn't have celery, but did have all the other ingredients and used those. I also added peas, corn, and spinach. I added some garlic, black pepper, and lemon pepper as well. I topped it with the buttered saltines and about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar. Overall I really liked this recipe... I really liked the crunch of the water chestnuts a lot! I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that you cannot tell that there's mayo in it.... you can taste that, and if you are making this for someone who doesn't like mayo, you should either cut back on the amount of mayo, or substitute a second can of cream of chicken/celery/mushroom/etc soup for the mayo. 
Thanks for the recipe!!

This is too good to be so simple!  My family loved it!  I didn't have mushrooms or water chestnuts, and it was great w/o them.  I combined the celery with 1 tablespoon margarine and cooked it in the microwave for 1 minute because my family doesn't like the "crunch".  They did, however, like the buttered cracker topping.  

I will be making this again.  I can't wait to try it with the mushrooms!

This is pure comfort food, and a dish that I would be proud to serve to both family and company! I have made this several times, and I can count on it always turning out great. I followed the recipe as printed with two exceptions - I substituted slivered almonds for the water chestnuts, and crumbled potato chips on top instead of crackers - just personal preference. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe has been a favorite of ours for many years.  I substitute cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken soup, omit the celery and mushrooms and use one sleave of ritz crackers for the saltines.

I love this recipe.  We call it "Hot chicken salad"  I use toasted sliced almonds instead of water chestnuts and used crushed potatoe chips on top.

This recipe was pretty good for a quick,easy dinner.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms, onion, garlic, and celery prior to adding it to everything else and also added julianned carrots.  I also didn't have enough mayo so I subbed sourcream for half of the mayo.  I also added pepper and a couple of dashes of hot sauce prior to  baking.  My husband had several servings.  I don't like cooking with "cream of" soups because it grosses me out, but sometimes it is just to tempting  because it is easy and it usually tastes good.

One of my favorite dishes is anything with chicken and rice, so when I saw this recipe I thought I would give it a try.  It is a great starter recipe. I had to make a few changes/substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I used cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have any cream of chicken.  I put in a few dashes of poultry seasoning, a little minced garlic, and two chicken bouillon cubes.  I left out the celery and lemon juice (didn't have any) and waterchestnuts (yuk!), but put in diced pimento. I mixed in a hand full of sharp cheddar cheese.  Also, I used french-fried onions, since I didn't feel like chopping an onion, mixing 1/2 can in and crushing some on top along with some extra cheese, instead of the saltines. As someone else stated, the mayo is a must. It adds a certain tanginess to the recipe. Also, I had some homemade chicken stock on hand, so I added a little to give it a little more moisture.  This was delicious.  Definitely will be using this recipe again.

This was ok.  I liked it but my husband didn't.  He said he could taste the mayo... I don't think so!  I would make it again but I'm wondering if maybe some fresh garlic would jazz it up a little.. it just seemed to be missing something!  Oh... I suggest NOT using ritz crackers.. just got too buttery tasting!

I also doubled the recipe except I used 1 crm of mushroom / 1 cream of chic.  But I've made this three times since finding the recipe and honestly, I've subbed crm of celery and/or any combo of the three (crm of celery/chicken/mushroom).  Also - used crushed potato chips instead.  Love and plan to keep and use many times over.

Very tasty.  I omitted the mushrooms for my husband's sake and used Ritz crackers for the topping.  Other than those two changes, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It took a little longer to prepare than I had hoped, but other than that it was a pretty good recipe.

Very bland. I followed recipe exactly except I was out of celery.  I do not think this would have helped much though. I will not make this again.

Great starter recipe. I added broccoli, cauliflower, and corn. I omitted the watercress and celery. I used cream of chicken soup and cream of mushroom soup. Added a splash of of chicken broth, omitted the mayo. Added some garlic powder, Italian seasoning, black pepper and dash of Cajun seasoning. 
I also used panko bread crumbs instead of saltines. And topped with sharp cheddar cheese. I also baked some chicken drumsticks separately til almost done and then transferred onto rice before adding panko bread crumbs and cheese. Then cooked til bubbly.

Great! I am giving 4 stars because I changed it slightly-I used less mayo(about1/4c) omitted the water chestnuts, lemon juice and saltines and topped it with French's Fried Onions. Even my picky eater loved it!

Loved it! I switched out the celery for a cup of broccoli and used Miracle Whip instead of Mayonnaise. Other than that, it was delicious.

This was a great recipe when I had a pack of chicken I needed to cook and 4 hungry men hanging out in my living room playing video games. I did make some changes which this recipe made it really simple. Instead of saltines I used some sour dough bread crumbs I'd had left over from a stuffing recipe I made a couple weeks ago. I did not use mayonnaise either because I've never liked the thought of hot mayo. I also put grated cheese over the bread crumbs. Came out so yummy an I got lots of compliments.

This was very tasty, but I did modify a bit.  I threw in a half of a red onion while I cooked the chicken and fresh sliced mushrooms.  I substituted chopped asparagus for the celery to get some extra veggies in there and I added a half cup of shredded cheese.  I will make this again for sure.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and so did my friends who I cooked it for. I substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise, and it turned out very well. It's very mild though, so I recommend adding a bit more salt or other spice of your choice.

I never thought I'd make a chicken rice casserole but needed to do so for my daughter who is 7 months pregnant and SHOULD be on bed rest.  I didn't have any water chestnuts and they don't like mushrooms so I added a little extra celery.  Had some left over Firecracker Crackers (from this site) and crushed them for the topping.  What I like the most is that there is no cheese in this recipe.  It was delicious!!!  The water chestnuts and mushrooms would be an improvement.  1st class!!!

I omitted the mushrooms, chopped the water chestnuts, added black pepper...and maybe may have used a bit too much celery.  It still went over well with my family and guests.  The granddaughter wasn't fond of it though.  She's all about not liking some textures at the age of 4.

I have been making this for over 30 years.  It is the very best chicken rice casserole ever. I add a little curry power and use crushed potato chips on top.

Made it just as stated and it really was quite good. Perfect quick meal for those busy weeknights. My daughters and husband really liked it. Will definitely make again. I like panko bread crumbs and may try in place of saltines for something different.

I am sorry to say but I made this for dinner for my boyfriend and I and I am very disappointed. The recipe has good reviews but we both just found it very bland. It is definitely missing something. The chestnuts did give a nice crunch but something needs to give this some good flavor. Will continue to look for another chicken and rice recipe.

Used the Ritz crackers like someone suggested, left out the mushrooms, seasoned and fried chicken tenders with seasoning salt, salt and pepper and cut into pieces.  Also added a little evaporated milk to make  the casserole  more moist. This was delicious!

It is had to rate this dish, because my boyfriend and I loved certain aspects of it and didn't care for others. We didn't care for the mayo--I would probably add two containers of the soup concentrate instead--but we loved the unexpected crunch of the water chestnuts and the crackers crumbs on top (we used Ritz instead). I gave it four stars, he voted two, so I compromised on three. However, if you're a mayo fan and love rich comfort food, this might be great for you.

Good but needs some extra spices. I skipped the mayo based on other reviews and used cream of mushroom soup. I was out of crackers and used a mix of rice crispies & frenchs onions instead. Added 1/2 chopped onion, used fresh mushrooms, added broccoli. Sauteed onions, mushrooms, celery first while rice & chicken cooked. Added some garlic, parsley, garlic powder and pepper. Mixed everything together, added a little chicken broth to thin out, then topped with mix of french onions & rice crispies put in oven for 20 min to brown and then sprinkled with finely shredded cheddar cheese. Good comfort food.

I made this recipe about a month ago and had my doubts about it because of the water chestnuts and the mayo, but it turned out very good.  My husband loved it.  I made this as a side dish because we wanted grilled chicken that night so no chicken was added, and the celery and mushrooms were increased.  I cut the mayo to 1/2 cup and changed the soup to low-fat/low sodium cream of mushroom. The water chestnuts gave it a perfect crunch and it was a great way to use up leftover rice from the day before. I would make this again.

Great recipe...the kids and husband thought it was great as well.  I had to do a lot of tweaking due to not having all ingredients.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, no celery, no waterchestnuts, cream of mushroom soup and ritz crackers.  Turned out great!  I'm adding this to my recipe box.

Serious comfort food recipe!  I used cream of mushroom and a frozen vegetable mix instead of celery.  Water chestnuts added a nice crunch!

This was a great way to use left over chicken! It was so delicious! It worked for me, even though I had to substitute Golden Mushroom soup for Cream of Chicken. I sliced the water chestnuts before mixing them in. Yum!

This is a go to often for us. I make the recipe as written except we leave out the mushrooms as some in the family don't eat them. We like the crunch of the celery and chestnuts.

I was embarrased to serve this to my friends and family.  So very bland.  Prep time took way longer than 10 minutes.  It needs flavor, so if you try it...doctor it up!

I'm not big on cooked mushrooms and did not have water chestnuts so I left them out.  This is a great recipe.  My husband loved it.  It would make a good dish for a pot-luck.

This recipe is worth more than 5 stars just on simplicity alone.  It is absolutely delicious!  I don't like water chestnuts and leaving them out of the recipe was not a problem.  Will definitely make again and again.  I used Ritz crackers to make a buttery topping.

I couldn't believe this recipe had no cheese. It still was GREAT!! The only thing I changed was I added Durkee Dried Onions to the top and took out the crackers. I am diabetic and with the rice there was enough carbs in it. So I lowered the carbs by adding the onions. I didn't put in the chopped onions either. The whole family LOVED it!!

I have a hungry, cheese loving man on my hands and he loved this dish!  He couldn't believe there wasn't cheese in it somewhere.  We cut out the mushrooms and water chestnuts (not his fav) and I sauted the onion with a little bellpepper and garlic before adding to mixture.  Will cook again! :)

Delicious!! I have tried many chicken and rice recipes and this one is the best so far. I love the crunch that the water chestnuts give it. Also, I didn't have mushrooms but still wanted the mushroom taste so I added a can of cream of mushroom soup. Amazing!

The water chestnuts add just that crush that makes it so edible!  It was a little more difficult to make because I used fresh everything and that meant cutting, but it still was pretty easy.  I like the hot sauce added to it to give it just what it needed.  My family both liked it alot.  I'll be making this again.

This recipe has good Ingredients, however I did improve it for our tastes.  We do not like crunch in casseroles, so I totally omitted the water chestnuts and then I lightly saute'd the celery and onion (for softness) before I mixed those in.  I added a cup of Velveeta Shreds (in the cheese section). I then only used 1/3 cups of Mayo instead of 3/4 cups.  Instead of mushroom "slices", i used stems & pieces (Green Giant has them).  Instead of doing the 1/3 cup of crushed saltines, I crushed about 2/3 cups of cornflakes which calls for additional butter.  YUMMO!!

This was very good. I sauteed the celery first and I did not add mushrooms (my kids do not like them). I had to use panko bread crumbs instead of crackers. I will admit, it did not look very pleasing, but when paired with a salad, it does look more appealing to the eye!

Well, my kids LOVED it, but I thought it was a failure.  I didn't like the flavor at all.  Wished I hadn't added the mayo - - I could taste it too much and wish I had added more veggies and maybe some cheese.  Bland at best. :-(

If you like the taste of cooking with soups you'll probably like this...I am more a fresh food person but thought I make this because I had everything on hand and it was easy. It was okay but will not make again.

This was very good. Omitted celery, onion, and mushrooms since I didn't have any on hand (and yet I had a can of water chestnuts.  Go figure.)  I used basmati rice, which has a nutty flavor.  Also, I sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on top of the cracker mixture (maybe 2 tbl of cheese), baked per directions.  Very tasty, and even good the next day reheated.

I skipped the mayo and used two cans of soup.  Used Ritz crackers, no butter.  Everyone enjoyed it, no leftovers!!

Definitely a 4.5-star rating on this one. Very satisfying comfort food. Made just a couple of adjustments: 1) omitted mushrooms to save my husband the trouble of picking them out, 2) omitted the celery to save me the trouble of a last-minute dash to the grocery store, and 3) substituted some toasted bread-crumbs for the crackers on top, which gave the topping an almost "stuffing-like" quality. Oh, and I also threw in some frozen peas and carrots for just a bit of color. In any case, very tasty. And it "warms up" well, a definite plus when cooking for two. May play with spices in the topping next time. "The Hubbs" really enjoyed it, as well. Ergo, will most certainly be using this one again. Thanks for this recipe!

My husband and I like this recipe.  The only changes I make is to leave out the water chestnuts (the celery itself gives a little crunch and texture, and I don't usually have water chestnuts on hand anyway) and cut the lemon juice down to 1 tsp instead of 1 tbs.  Instant brown rice works well too & adds flavor.  Good recipe.

My family loves this recipe. It is a wonderfully creamy and warm comfort food dish. The only suggestion I have is to add 2 - 3 tablespoons of dijon mustard to the mayo. Don't omit the lemon juice - it won't taste lemony, but gives it a little extra flavor. Great recipe!

This is a very good base for a chicken rice casserole. I added garlic, paprika, red pepper and some chicken stock. I also put some chopped boiled potatoes, rice and then covered them with the sauce. The family devoured it!

This was INCREDIBLY yummy (after the changes I made). Hence the 4 stars instead of 5. First of all, mayo in this would have been really weird, so I did about 1 TBSP of mayo, and then subbed sour cream for the rest. I don't like onions and celery so I left those out and just added a little onion powder. I doubled the recipe and instead of using 2 cans of cream of chicken I subbed one for cream of mushroom soup. I also added peas to the mix. DELICIOUS!

My family loved this recipe.   The saltines looked a little bland, so I sprinkled dried onions on top of the crackers.  (The kind you put on top of the green bean casserole.)  It added a nice flavor and crunch.   This is a keeper!

I thought this recipe turned out quite well. I did make a few changes. I didn't have any mushrooms or celery so I used one can cream of mushroom and 1/2 a can of cream of celery instead of the cream of chicken. I added a cup of shredded chz and used seasoned chicken. I did use green beans with a little hesitation. I am use to using broccoli. I also used wheat Ritz crackers instead of saltines. I definatly like the added crunch the water chesnuts and the cranckers give this dish.

Tasty, quick & simple.  I keep cooked cubed chicken in my freezer always ready to use. I added one can of green beans and sprinkled McCormick Montreal Chicken Grill Mate on Top with crackers and then topped all with 1/3 cup crushed BBQ potato Chips.  Fussy husband had two servings.  Thank you Linda

I made this recipe and loved it. I changed it just a little by adding fresh garlic, parsley & I used celery salt instead of regular salt. Also I didn't have any crackers so I used corn chex and was pleased with the results. Great recipe!

Love this one!!!  I made my dish a little more Asian in flavor.  First,I sauted the chicken in Sesame Ginger dressing.  I left out the cheese and additional spices.  I used the canned straw mushrooms (like you would use for stir-fry) and used a chinese 5 spice (1 tsp.)  I also toasted sliced almonds for the top.  Everyone loved it!!  I will be making again and again

I wasn't impressed.  I sauteed the veggies before hand and added cheese.  Other than that, followed the directions.  I found this one bland. I think it would be good if you added about 8 oz of sour cream in with the mayo.

I was concerned that the mayo would overpower the taste, but combined with the water chestnuts it gave it a nice sweetness.  My husband really enjoyed this and I will definately be making it again!

I didn't think this was very good at all, although we did eat it for dinner.  The celery was quite hard and it just didn't have the flavor I was hoping for.

This was a great kick off recipe that is open for interpretation.
I didn't have water chestnuts, so did like another reviewer and added sliced almonds, about 1/4 C. 
I used some crumb topping I had left over from the Campbells SW Chicken and Rice Bake mixed with about a 1/2 C. of grated garlic cheddar.
I used at least a 1/2 C. of sauteed onion and a 1/4 C. of sauteed celery, (both in EVOO) cause I like more veggie in there. 
The taste combination was just great!

Pretty good.  I sauted onions, celery, 1/2 green pepper and fresh mushrooms to make them soft.  I used cream of mushroom soup because thats what I had on hand, and I used sliced american cheese tore up because I didn't notice that I didn't have cheddar on hand till it was too late.  I topped it with french fried onions, didn't use the lemon juice, and I forgot to put in the mayo, dinners can be hectic at my house.  Next time I will use the mayo to make it creamy.  Wasn't dry at all.  My 3 boys - age 7, 4 and 1 loved it.

my husband is not a fan of any kind of casserole but this he thought was great!  i omitted the celery just because we arent fans.  i didnt care for the crackers on top i will make it without the topping next time.  great recipe!
