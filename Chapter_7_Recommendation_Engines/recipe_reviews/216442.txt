Thanks for your ratings and reviews everyone! Just for some additional info/help, these are not glazed walnuts -- they are supposed to be sort of crystalized. I think adding another cup or so of nuts would be a great way to use up the excess sugar mixture, and using all zest and no extract is another good idea for a subtler taste. Thank you for trying these out; I'm glad you've enjoyed them!

Another "different" treat. Was easy to make and very well received at our holiday party. Had requests for recipe which is always a good sign.

Made this for Thanksgiving and they were a hit at both family dinners.  The only complaint I have is that they are sugary (sandy texture) rather than glazed.  I will play with it a bit to see if I can change that for Christmas.  Also, there is a lot of syrup and nuts that were wasted after cooling because there was a slushy "cluster" left because of excess syrup.  I ended up throwing it and the nuts encased in it out.   I had added an extra handful of nuts prior to cooling because there was so much excess syrup, but it could really could have stood another cup or two.  I will try that as well to avoid throwing any of it away.

Really good flavor, but they sugar crystalized. I omitted the orange extract and used the zest a whole orange. They went well with pear & gorgonzola salad.

I used pecans because that's what I had on hand .  I hand-squeezed the juice from 2 California Cuties (Mandarins) in place of the extract letting some pulp fall in to the nuts.  I threw them in a 350degree oven for 1 minutes to crisp them up.  Taste great!!  I will add them to sauteed green beans.

These are SO yummy!  It took mine a lot longer than an hour for the glaze to set but the orange flavor is SO good and so worth the wait!
