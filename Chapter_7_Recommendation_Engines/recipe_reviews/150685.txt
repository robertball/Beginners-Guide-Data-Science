I'm a Texas boy and I've eaten nothing but grilled steaks my whole life. I was really unsure about the marinade and pan frying a steak but decided to take a gamble. Boy, was I surprised, the steaks turned out tender and juicy with the perfect flavor to accent the great taste of the meat, not over powering, and defiantly not undetectable. If you are looking for a restaurant quality steak without having to own a grill, this is it. 5 Stars all the way.

I know that flat iron steaks are the new "in" steaks nowadays, so I was keen at trying them as I never had one. I came across this recipe and decided to take a ride to my local butcher's. I brought the steaks home and followed the recipe to a tee. The outcome was great! The steaks had a wonderful flavor from the marinade and were very juicy and tender. I cooked them medium rare (one medium) and they were perfect. I sautéed some button mushrooms in butter, olive oil and onion powder and served a small amount on top of the steak. I would make this recipe again and also use this cut of steak again.

This was an o.k recipe. I followed the directions exactly and we couldn't figure out the taste. We thought either it has too much mustard or I let it marinade too long (I put it to marinade in the morning and we didn't end up grilling it until the next day for lunch. I might try it again with less mustard or with prepared mustard next time.

My mother-in-law sent this recipe to me recently.  While over at her house during the holidays, she made this for the family.  It was WONDERFUL!  I ate it up.  It was nice, because she could cook the meat to the "doneness" of everyone's liking.  My husband and I prefer medium-rare or medium-well.  My in-laws prefer their meat more well-done.  It was SO tender!  She, too, followed the recipe to a tee.  I will definitely be looking for flat-iron steak at the grocer in the very near future.

This was a very easy and flavorful  recipe. I did add a little more garlic and rosemary than called for, but that's because I like my flavors a little intense. I also used the pan scrapings to make a simple wine and mushroom gravy to round it out. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a pretty good recipe. I only give it 4 stars because it seems like something is missing. As someone else said, you are sort of trying to figure out the taste. I'll try other things to add or take out. A pretty good steak though.

This was absolutely a restaurant grade meal!  For those that have asked, a flat iron steak is also called a "Top Blade Steak".  In my supermarket, it's called a Flat Iron steak and comes prepackaged in a cryovac (sp?) package.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly.  I think that you need to in order to give an accurate review...is not fair to give a bad or less than complimentary review if you did not use the same ingredients, left one or more out, or substituted. (You can decide after trying if you want to tweak it to your tastes.)  Is not necessary to use an expensive wine...I used a $2.97 bottle of Oak Leaf that I got at Walmart.  I also used the fresh herbs and I think I marinaded this for about 6 hours. This was just for my husband and I, so the steak I bought was just a little over 1 pound.  I still used the same measurements for the marinade and it was perfect.  I cut the meat in half because I knew my husband would want his more done....I am a medium rare girl...he doesn't like to see a lot of red.  And that brings me to some complaints I saw of this recipe regarding the cooking time.  It's difficult to judge that because of the thickness of the steak you buy and the heat you use.  I started the burner at medium high about 3 minutes before I added the meat (gas burner).  I would say that for my steak, it took about 7-8 minutes per side for medium-rare.  I left my husband's in the pan for an additional 3 min. per side and it was perfect for him. Excellent meal!

This was really good. I had never tried a Flat Iron steak before and I was so excited about how it turned out that I went and got another one and made up my own marinade! My husband has asked that Flat Iron steaks be added to the regular rotation.

You can't get proper browning on a steak in a nonstick skillet. In order to form that perfect crust, you have to use a cast iron (preferably) or a stainless steel skillet.

Just made this tonight following the exact directions and ingredients and it tasted okay. Cooked per the directions it comes out very rare. So, we broiled them in the oven on a grill rack for about 10 minutes afterwards. The meat came out super juicy and much better this way.   To bring out a bolder taste I made a dipping sauce mixing 1/4 cup zinfandel (or red wine), 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. This really livened up this recipe's flavor and and should be added as part of the recipe. Enjoy!

If I could give this 10 stars I would. This was my first taste of Flat Iron Steak. It won't be my last. It is more tender than sirloin. I followed the recipe exactly except for the dry mustard, I used 1 Tablespoon. Instead of pan frying, I put it on the grill.   I was able to get a good price on a steak assortment,(Flat Iron, Sirloin, NY Strip) so I doubled the marinade recipe,  placed each steak individually in a Ziploc freezer bag with several tablespoons of the marinade and put them in the freezer. They marinade as they thaw in the fridge. My guests never let me plan ahead, they usually just drop by to see "what's cooking" So I can pull out the amount and cut I need. Having these handy has made me a hero to steak lovers. Thanks for this flavorful recipe.

Lori Jay, Flat iron steak is the shoulder top blade cut.  Found this online:  The Flat Iron is very similar to any of the Flat Steaks so anything calling for Skirt or Flank Steak will benefit from a Flat Iron Steak.

It was so easy I couldn't give it five stars, if that makes sense, but it was absolutely phenomenal nonetheless. I added red wine to deglaze and threw in a tablespoon of butter to add some substance to the sauce.

This was good. I definitely agree with many other reviews that the steak needed to cook longer. The entire center of mine was red and I put it back in the pan to finish cooking. I had to use dried herbs and balsamic vinegar instead of wine. I didn't have any on hand. I really like flat iron steak and I will probably use this recipe again in the future.

Made this last nite and my wife just loved it!  As some suggested, substituted balsamic vinegar & worchestershire sauce for the wine.  To us, that made all the difference.  Really bold flavor with this option.  Iron skillet in pre-heated oven at 500 degrees and baked 4 min per side.  It just hissed and gave a nice sear to hold the juices.  We don't see flat iron steak very often but we will now be on the look out for more.  Purchased at a Super Walmart that really had a good selection.

This was a quick, easy and delicious recipe!  I only changed one thing because I didn't have chopped chives on hand, so I used green onion, instead.  This recipe is a keeper!!

This turned out awesome.  I followed the recipe and used all fresh rosemary, chive and parsley from my wife's herb garden.  I also used fresh chopped garlic.  Pan fried.  Oh, I didn't have cab, so I used merlot.  Turned out tender & delicious!

Yes a good dish. It did not matter that ready made mustard was used instead and any sort of red wine. Strain the marinade and when you have cooked the steaks leave to settle and then boil the liquid rapidly to make a jus, add a splash of balsamic vinegar (fig if you have it) and away you go. Slice up the steak as you would a ducks breast. This could also be served with a little cranberry sauce and parsley sprinkled over the top.   Your guests will think you have spend far more than the Flat Iron costs.

I don't know what I did here, but I couldn't taste the marinade and it didn't tenderize the steak very much. I even doubled the marinating time. One thing I did different was was use sliced flat iron steaks. Maybe, that was a problem. I did cook them in a hot pan versus grilling. Both, never seemed to be a problem before though. The steak was still descent, for not being a prime cut, just not sure entirely about what the marinate did for it.

I agree with other posters that the marinade needs more acidity.  I would recommend substituting red wine vinegar and worcestershire sauce for some of the wine.

I have never cooked with this particular cut of meat and I was pleasantly surprised at how tender this turned out to be! I made this strictly to specifications and found that the wine flavor took center stage to others, so for those that do not like the strong 'wine flavor' I would strongly recommend cutting the amount that you use. My husband does not like bloody meat so I cooked it 8 minutes per side on an indoor grill and found it to be perfect, not overcooked at all. I will definitely make this again, but with less wine...

I tried this recipe last night for my husband and I and we really enjoyed it a lot. This is a must. I used dried herbas as I did not have fresh herbs. The result was very yummy. However, I can't wait to try with fresh herbs. I will definately cook it again!.

Best Steak Ever!  I can't believe how good such a cheap cut could be.
I'm not a fan of wine, red esp, so I used someone's suggestion to sub balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire sauce instead.  I also heated a cast iron skillet in a 500 °F oven to sear both sides for 4 mins and it came out juicy, almost fork tender, and exactly cooked as stated.  I like my beef rare, so next time I'll do it for 2.5 or 3 mins per side, but I already went back and bought more of these.

My steak was about the same size and thickness as the picture. The recommended  time to cook was way off.  Even after eight minutes on each side, it was still raw. I threw some butter on it and stuck it in the oven at 400 until the internal temp was adequate.

I was curious about flat iron steak since I have been reading about it on the cooking websites so I purchased a decent looking cut and then happened upon this excellent recipe and the proponents and steak aficionados were quite right about the excellent nature of this relatively new steak! It came out very tender and was delicious! Thanks for an excellent recipe!

Your recipe is very aptly named.  This was hands-down the most fantabulous steak I have ever eaten!!  The marinade was delicious and the meat almost melted in my mouth, it was so tender.  Good-bye Tenderloin,  this is my new Fave!

Really good! I did not have fresh herbs on hand which I'm sure would have made it even tastier. I had to finish my steak in the oven, as my pan was getting too blackened and smoky and the steak was not even rare yet. 10 minutes at 425 finished it off nicely and it was still tender and rare!

This is an exceptional recipe.  It is so easy, I even made it on a camping trip without any trouble at all. My family loves the aroma--wishing they could eat that as well--and polishes it all off. I serve it with orzo, and I think that the better the balsamic vinegar, the better the result. I used a vinegar from Safeway (okay), but think the one at Costco was much richer. Again, excellent recipe! :D

this is far from perfect.  it was still breathing after the suggested prepared time.  not rare but BREATHING!!!  it took another 15 minutes and then 5 to rest to get it to medium rare.  and the steak was NEVER frozen.

I've always wanted to successfully pan fry a steak and flat iron is the cut to make that possible.  This marinade is very good.  I cooked it at least 6 - 8 minutes per side because it was totally raw in the middle after 4 minutes per side.  I did not let it come to room temp before cooking which probably had a lot to do with length of cooking time.  It came out juicy and pink in the center after 6 - 8 minutes. I will use this recipe again.

Best steak recipe ever. This was my 1st time making a flat iron steak and I am back to the butcher for a couple more. I used all the fresh herbs but after chopping I had 1/3 c of herbs. I used molasses in place of the wine which is what I have always used in my marinade recipes. I marinaded this for 4 hours and fried this in a large fry pan at medium/high heat for 4 minutes each side. The steak was med/rare throughout the entire steak and juicy translucent. 5+ star!

Delicious!  Nice marinade.  I didn't have the cabernet so just used some red wine I had and I also didn't have fresh rosemary so had to use dried.  Then I was the opposite and didn't have dry mustard so squeezed in some regular old yellow mustard.  I think I added a bit extra garlic and then stuck it in a bag and went to bed.  We had it the next night for dinner

Got my steak on clearance for 50% off to so it made it taste even better!!  We like our meat still close to growling so it was rare-med/rare and so tender you could cut it with a fork.

This is one of our favorite (non-BBQ) steak recipes. Exceptionally tender and flavorful. We've prepared it several times without the dry mustard (simply because we didn't have any) and loved it. I'm going to try the dry mustard today.

Wow, this was fantastic!  This is the perfect Sunday-After-Church main dish.  You can mix up the marinade overnight, and pour it on the steak Sun. morning.  Since it cooks in a skillet only 10 minutes, you have dinner on the table in a flash. The marinade was delicious.  Not too overpowering, just the perfect complement for the meat.  Since I'd never had flat iron steak, I was afraid that the lean cut would be very tough.  Perhaps it would be without the wine to tenderize it.  However, it was very tender.  The 4.5 minute per side was perfect.  It is one the rare side of medium rare, but since our whole family perfers medium rare, it was very much to our liking.  The kids and hubby loved it and I'll be making it again many more times!

This was excellent steak.  I had to use red wine vinegar instead of cabernet, and dried herbs for fresh and it was still fantastic.  Just finished eating.  :)  I fried some onions and potatoes with it.

This was my first time to cook a flat iron steak. We didn't have enough time to marinate the required time but we loved the flavor. The rosemary was a very pleasing taste. Can't wait to try it again.

It was delicious! I made it for our Christmas Eve dinner, as I wanted something that I would be able to throw together w/out a lot of preparation.  My entire family, including the daughters who are not fans of beef, loved it. Don't know if the recipe changed, as some reviewers talked about 1/4 cup mustard--the recipe I followed only called for 1/4 tsp, which was the perfect amount. Highly recommend!

Made this last night just as directed, except had to sub prepared brown mustard, and it does make a very tasty steak. I used 1" thick filets, med-rare, cooked 3 mins each side. Very pretty sliced on the platter too.  Might try topping with some sauted mushrooms next time.

Very good. The only thing I changed was I used 2 tsp and not 1/4c of dry mustard powder as I only had 2 tsp left in the bottle on hand. But, even if I had more....I would be afraid to use 1/4 of mustard powder in a small batch of marinade. It sounds like an awful lot...

This recipe is fantastic! I couldn't find any "flat iron" cuts of steak so I purchased tender medallions (another shoulder cut).  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  The flavor of the marinade is amazing, even after just two hours, and the cooking instructions were right on target. We got a perfect medium rare.  My boyfriend was very impressed. Yum!

I did not care for this at all. I don't even like the smell of it. Judging by the other reviews it was good so I am not sure if it is just because I am sensitive to the Cabernet or the mustard powder or what but I will not make this again.

I really don't see how no one likes this b/c I thought this was very easy to prepare and good, throw the ingredients together and marinate, then cook, how hard is that? I followed the recipe but left out the rosemary since I didn't have any. I also used regular mustard because I don't usually keep dry in the cupboard (don't use it enough). This turned out great. The marinade made the steak very flavorful and cooked up very tender. I used my rocket grill to cook since it is much easier and was so good. Served with garlic mash potatoes and green beans and carrots. Great marinade, quick easy and tasty. Thanks for the recipe

Substituted Merlot for the Cabernet Sauvignon but kept everything else the same.  Turned out wonderfully.

I thought that the seasonings were quite anemic.  I pretty much quadrupled the recipe amounts.  I just love flat irons and this flavor combination was very good.  Note to people who are not familiar with this cut: this is not a good grilling steak. It is a great pan steak.  DO NOT cook it passed medium. Mid rare is best.

To me, this had no taste. I ended up adding a rub to it to give it some flavor.

I really did not care for the marinade on this steak.  I am a big fan of flat iron steaks and was hoping to find a recipe for pan frying them.  Something about the cab wine and the mustard.  Hubby said it was good but we both like the "Grilled Flat Iron Steak with Blue Cheese butter" much better.  Though the marinades are quite similar.

I don't usually do reviews.  HOWEVER!!  Tried this recipe this evening and it was awesome -- nothing like a great flat iron steak in the middle of a big Maine snow storm.  Flavorful, tender and we'll have this again (and again).

We LOVED this! I changed things just a bit, though (because I can never actually stick to a recipe): I doubled the garlic, used cilantro instead of chives (just because I didn't have the recipe right in front of me and got the ingredient mixed up), and also added a little bit of paprika. It was excellent! I will definitely make this again!

I prefer to use a Merlot rather than a Cabernet Sauvignon, and 3 cloves of garlic. Nevertheless, a great steak.

AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't drain the marinade. I let it brown with the meat until it was like bar-b-q sauce. It went so fast around my house, the smell still hung in the air and my skillet was still cooling, but it was GONE!

Great marinade! The steaks come out very moist and juicy, which is rare in a flat iron steak!  I have one of the vacuum sealers that allows me to make custom sized bags.  I mix the marinade, and put it and the steaks in a vacuum-able bag.  Then I vacuum and seal the bag. I do that with all meat marinades now, seems to really accelerate the marinating process.  But that's the only addition I made to the recipe.  Thanks for a really good one!!

It may be that I simply do not like Flat Iron steaks.  I have cooked them several times and not liking them exactly, I tried this recipe.  While I WILL SAY the meat was very tender, I did not like the taste. I doubt I will use this recipe again.

I'm not quite at the "PERFECT" level on this recipe but it was good. I have other Flat Iron recipes I prefer but it was worth a try. I followed this recipe as written. The amount of Mustard Powder seemed a tad high. I still enjoy the reviews that bear little resemblance to the recipe their rating!!!

I made it as specified and marinated for about 2hrs and the steak was just pretty flavorless. I think that's more a problem with the cut of meat though...flatiron just isn't very flavorful (compared to ribeye or tenderloin). I did take the extra marinade and, after sauteing shallots with garlic in butter I added chopped mushrooms, reduced it with some chicken bone broth down to a nice chunky gravy/sauce. That saved it, but still it wasn't anything I'd go to the trouble to repeat. Bummer...would've loved to have had some other than bulgogi to do with flatiron steak!

This sounded good, but turned out quite flavorless.  Maybe needs to marinate overnight instead.

YUM. I did not have all of the ingredients for the marinade on hand, but most of them. I had never made flat iron steak before, but sometimes the price just can't be ignored. I would recommend six minutes per side. After slicing, if someone doesn't like the rare result or it isn't heated all the way through. throw the slices into the hot skillet for just a few seconds per side. This was sooooo tender and delicious.

Made this tonight staying true to receipe.  It was just okay and barely cooked.  Had to put under the broiler for another 5 minutes. To me, this was a lot of work to turn out just okay.  Chopping the parsley, rosemary, chives and garlic...Whew!

My husband bought two flat iron steaks. He made one a couple of weeks ago and it was tough and tasteless. He was ready to throw this one away but I convinced him to let me try. Used this marinade and seared as instructed. The steak was wonderful.  I didn’t use the mustard but will the next time.  Now I’m ready to work on my own marinade. Thanks!

This will go into my rotation for sure! I followed the suggestions from others who suggested adding more acidic liquid.  I did not have the wine so I used 1/4 c. sweet vermouth, 1/4 c. Bragg's apple cider vinegar and 1/8 c. Worcestershire.  I also used 2 heaping tablespoons of  minced garlic.  I added everything to the food processor to blend, poured on top of the steak and marinated for two hours before putting it on a preheated broiler pan.  I broiled on high for 5 minutes, flipped and broiled for another 5 minutes.  I let it rest covered for 5 minutes before serving and it came out medium rare.  I sliced thin and served with fresh green beans and cauliflower.  DELICIOUS!!

Made this tonight - absolutely delicious!  Whole house smells like a very expensive steakhouse YUM
Will definitely make again. First time making flat iron steak and happy to abandon London broil for this new fave at just about the same price. Only had 30 min to marinate at room temp and all flavors came through nicely.

Just finished eating this steak & it is a keeper recipe for sure. I used the fresh herbs from our garden & followed the recipe as written except that I did a quick marinating with a marinating container & my vacuum sealer set to marinate. I had to put the leftovers in the fridge right away. There was only my hubby & myself eating it & eating it & we couldn’t leave it alone. It was that good! Thanks for sharing.

I have made this receipt a couple of times.  I followed the directions exactly except I cooked mine on the BBQ and a 2” steak took 30 min and a 1” steak took 15 min.  Each time was perfect!  Thank you!

I didn't use any mustard powder because I hate mustard and I used a good Chianti in the marinade.
It was melt-in-your-mouth tender at medium rare! I will definitely make it again!

Made this yesterday (my first time cooking flank steak myself) and it was AMAZING!!  
As a garlic lover, I did double the garlic. The steak was tender, flavorful, and received compliments from everyone who ate it!!   Highly recommended.

I had never made flat iron steak before. I gave it a bit of a pounding with a meat mallet and marinated it in Italian dressing, chopped garlic, soy sauce, red wine vinaigrette, a shot of whiskey, a pinch of sugar. I was going to throw it on the grill, but it started to rain badly. As the steak was already marinating, I had to make it that day, so I found your  stovetop recipe online. You were right, about four minutes a side for medium-rare. Oh my God! What a wonderful cut of meat! Tender as a filet, with a bold taste akin to grass-fed beef. Just delicious. I was skeptical about using a non-stick pan instead of a cast-iron skillet, but went with your directions anyway, and it was absolutely great.

Made it once, not bad.  I let it marinate over nite.   The only thing different that I did was to use a cast iron pan.  Never use non stick on high heat, bad news.

I will not make this again...it was too much work for not much flavor.  My son wanted the steak sauce for his steak.  I had not cooked this type of steak before and had been wondering about flank steaks.  Probably won't buy them again either.  Mine was too grisly.  The fellows said they were okay but would rather have t-bone or sirloin.

After reading a number of reviews I decided to try this.  The recipe needs something and even before making it, I thought the recipe lacked acid.  I made the following modifications...turns out great for those needing something more.  * Use an old cab that you have stored in the fridge for a few weeks that you like.  The cab needs to oxidize and take on some off flavors and acids.  Alternatively you can just fully use a home made Cab near vinegar. * If you use wine, cut it with balsamic vinegar. * I decided to use a slice/two of a small yellow onion (close to a shallot) in place of the chives to bring out more pungency.  For the lack of acid I rate this 3.5 stars.  No such rating to the benefit goes to the engineering!

LOVE, LOVE the marinade! For us, probably best on a better cut of meat. Had to cook longer than suggested as it was really rare...returned to pan to cook longer. Meat was quite chewy. I will try again, but use a better cut of beef.

I don't know, maybe I'm just not used to the flavor, but I thought the marinade just tasted weird for a steak. I think it might just be preference though because I chose this recipe for its high ratings. The majority seems to like it!

This is really close to a marinade I've been looking for from a steak house from 40 years ago. Of course it was done on a flank steak then. You just made a wish come true!  Big thanks Cocina JNOTS.

I used prepared mustarard and maybe a little bit more wine than called for. There was nice flavor, but I guess I'm looking for something a little different.

The marinade smelled good but it turned out to be very strong when the meat was cooked.  I didn't like this one.

Wow!  This is the first time I have taken the time to rate a recipe.  I just had to chime in and say that this is fantastic just as it is.  The only substitution I made was green onions for chives, only because I didn't have chives.

Wonderful flavor, and it seems to freeze well too.  I split into two baggies for marinating, and put one in the freezer for a quick dinner some other night.

This is just outstanding!

First time I've been motivated to post a review. But this steak is terrific! No changes - a real recipe box keeper.

Made these last night, they were great, juicy and full of flavor.  Even the one that we cooked well done was juicy and tender.  We did grill ours.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I will use this on other cheaper cuts of beef.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This is the perfect flat iron stake.  Does not need any thing on top, like sautéed mushroom maybe a little A1 steak sauce.. This is better than any Felit Mignon I have ever had.
This is a 10 star recipe. Is on my next dinner party menu. My hubby and I had it for lunch today he wanted more. Thank for this recipe.
