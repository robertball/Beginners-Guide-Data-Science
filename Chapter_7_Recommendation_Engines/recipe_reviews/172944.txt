The measurements in this recipe are incorrect. If you follow it all you will get is a very soupy sweet mixture that is useless. I know because I followed the recipe to the letter and thats what I got. However the recipe was not a total lost, I tried it again and this time I added the ingredients alittle at a time all the while tasting and checking consistancy. I used the ingredients for 10 servings. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup instead of 1-1/4 cup. The salt from 1 tablspoon to 1/2 teaspoon and the boiling water from 2-1/2 cups to 1-3/4 cups. The recipe also said to cook 4 minutes per side. That is too long, they do not burn but they do get hard. I cooked them 2-1/2 minutes on each side. And they were perfect

The water should be boiled with the salt and sugar and then the cornmeal should be added slowly while stirring. In that way you can assure a more uniform taste and no clumps. Also, if you apply a little bit of butter to your hands when forming them, the mix will not stick to your skin. Another variation is to use munster cheese instead of American cheese and eliminate the sugar entirely. They are ready when the cheese oozes out of the stick.

NOTE: The instructions are incomplete. You need to boil the water 1st then stir in the cornmeal, salt and sugar. Mix all the ingredients well until it stops sticking to the sides of the pot. Also, I personally recommend using only 1/4 cup sugar (otherwise they end up being overly sweet).
