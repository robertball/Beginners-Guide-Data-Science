I agree with the previous review, this is one of the best coleslaws I've ever tasted. I substituted walnuts for the pecans only because that's what I had on hand, and toasting them really does add a great flavor to the coleslaw.

Made this for dinner last night and really didn't care for it.  It seemed a little bland, but by tonight it was terrific!  It just needed time for the flavors to blend.  The only changes I made were to use dried cranberries instead of raisins (because my raisins were pretty dry) and to use lime juice instead of lemon juice.  Will certainly make again.  Would be great for a potluck.

I was pretty dissapointed with this recipe. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor. I used dried cranberries instead of golden raisins, and I doubled the amount. I think the amount of dressing is not nearly enough; I would suggest that it be doubled. This was okay, but it lacked flavor.

We thought this was a wonderful coleslaw, definitely in the top five coleslaws that weâ€™ve tried.  It is light and refreshing with a mild sweet flavor.  Delish.

This was a nice change of pace from the traditional slaw.  I did not toast my pecans, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Thanks for sharing, M.K. Bishop!

EXCELLENT! At first, hubby turned his nose up at it, but once he tried it he LOVED it and literally could not stop eating it, lol! I made it as written, but only measured the dressing ingredients, just adding in a touch more honey and eye-balled the salad ingredients. I will definitely be making this delicious,  refreshing slaw often! Thanks for sharing. :)

I served this last night at my dinner party along with Monterey Chicken and garlic mashed potates and my guests raved about it.  I used a prepared bag of slaw mix - threw in a few craisins with the raisins - it was delish!  Only thing I would do different is next time I will chop up my own cabbage because it would be fresher.  My sister wants me to share this recipe so she can used it for a covered dish!

Great base to start from, but definitely needed help.  I substituted dried cherries for raisins, added 1 Tbls prepared horseradish, 1 tsp onion powder and 2 tsp fine sea salt to the dressing.  I found the amount of dressing to be fine, but if you like really wet slaw then you need to increase how much you make.

It's very good.  I used lime juice instead of lemon and used toasted walnuts. I also wanted a tiny pinch of salt on mine at the table (I'm not really a salt fan either but it brought out another dimension)but the family gave it great reviews!

Very tasty with a nice crunch.  I skipped the raisins and the onions and added a bit of mustard to the dressing.  Really quick to make and better if made the night before.
