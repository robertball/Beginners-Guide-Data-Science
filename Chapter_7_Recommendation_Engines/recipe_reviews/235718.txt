I made this for dinner tonight, and we all loved it!  I did add one clove of chopped garlic the last 30 seconds after browning the onions and right before adding in the spinach.  Baking time was accurate and it was perfect.  I also put a dollop of Greek yogurt on top just before serving.  Next time I make this I'm going to add some dried oregano with the egg mixture so it will have a Greek flavor.  I plan on making this dish more often as it was so easy for a quick meal.  Thanks Chef John, this is a keeper!

Very good...I had some kalamata olives which I added albeit sparingly because of the salt. Turned out just as promised.  Note that the video and the recipe are different, at least with regards to cooking the spinach.  I sauteed mine.  Will make again!

I have made this twice now.. It is a nice change from the quiche with cottage cheese that I make. It is firm and delicious, great warm or cold as leftovers from the fridge. The texture is wonderful. The feta cheese adds the perfect amount of saltiness and compliments the eggs and spinach without overpowering the favors.

This was really good but lacked flavor. I would make again but incorporate the chees into the spinach mixture.

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe as far as ingredients, but since I don't have a saute pan I can put in the oven I piled everything into a quiche pan (10 1/2" diameter;  2" height).  It was therefore not as thin as in a large saute pan, so took longer to set (approx 30 minutes).  I also really don't like runny eggs, so the 30 minutes let it set all the way through and was a little browned on top without broiling, but without making the eggs tough.  I will definitely make this again.  I could easily cut this into 1" pieces to make appetizers, too.

Make sure the mixture is no more than an inch deep...use a large enough dish... or it takes much longer to bake and may not set in the center.  I also almost doubled the cheese and it was great.  Don't over salt the eggs, though.

Loved it but it needed more than double the feta, I think 8-10 oz would be better.  I doubled and it still could have used more.  I did use a garlic clove as well.   I put it together the night before and just baked it for about 40 min.

This was a really great recipe. I made it as per the recipe and it was delicious  as written. I also mixed it up by substituting mushrooms or asparagus for the spinach. Of course, the bacon is a must lol although I am considering a seafood variation....

Pretty good!  Gotta say, though, better the day it was made.  I made it in a fast iron skillet and kept the leftovers in a lie plate.  Baked for 20 minutes, try 19 next time!

This was so good. I changed it up a little and used breakfast sausage instead of bacon and I out some fresh garlic in with the spinach. I also doubled the feta because well I’m Greek and a huge feta lover. So good.

I liked this except mine looked soupier than the picture...I think it is my oven, I even baked it longer. Seemed like I squeezed a lot of liquid out of the spinach.
4 of 5 of us liked this dish.

Perfect flavor balance with 3oz feta.  I made it in a cast iron pan which may be why I had to bake mine for 23 minutes in stead of 15.  Also, I removed the bacon from the pan to let it cool for chopping while sauteing the onion on its own.  I returned the bacon to the mix much later.

I've made this recipe twice  and both times used diced ham in place of the bacon.  Sautéed it with the onion and a little butter.  Delicious!  Simple, not too many ingredients.  Love it :)

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  It was a wonderful meal for 3 different times.  However, I  would use more feta next time.  Also, I chopped the cooked bacon and mixed it in the recipe.

Have made this many times.  It is my go to dinner in a pinch.  Yummy!  Mostly make it without meat, sometimes use bacon or Canadian bacon.  Serve it to company at breakfast.  Everyone has loved it.  Never have any leftover.

Absolutely outstanding!  Made exactly as directed... except... had no feta cheese, so I sprinkled shredded cheddar on top, and then thought, "What the heck, I'll put some fresh mozzarella rounds on top of the cheddar and see what happens!"  OH, MY!

Thanks CJ, for yet another great base recipe!

Perfect!
I forgot to preheat the oven so I just put a lid on the cast iron pan and turned the burner to low-ish for 10 minutes. Then I threw it under the broiler until it browned a bit.  Turned out just right. Thank you!

Chef John rocks! I'm not an experienced cook so am interested in the cooking method as well as the ingredients. Made it for the two of us so adjusted the recipe to 4 and it was just the right amount along with a slice of  whole wheat toast. Will add more feta next time as we are cheese lovers, also liked the suggestions to add mushrooms and a dollop of Greek yogurt on top.

Too many eggs and no crust. Not what I was looking for.

i added some mushrooms.  This is, in my opinion, a very tasty and healthy recipe... and a nice way to eat spinach, which i do not usually eat.

I used kale and Swiss chard, because I didn't have any spinach and had kale and Swiss chard!! Also used scallions because they were going to be discarded soon!   Turned out very flavorful! Putting it under the broiler made the top crispy and wonderful!  I would make this again and add mushrooms to it next time!!
