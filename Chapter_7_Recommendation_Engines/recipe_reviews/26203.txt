These are really good although I suggest making them with peanut butter cups instead! I'm not really a big caramel fan. I used the same base for the cookies though and it's very tasty.

These were pretty good. I may have overbaked them so they were tough. I prefer regular peanut butter cookies although these are an interesting twist.

I followed the other suggestions (saying the cookies were too sugary) and did not roll the dough in the left over sugar. Instead I sprinkled a tiny bit of sea salt over the cookies before I baked them. This gave them an amazing salty kick to an already sweet cookie. Very good!!

One recommendation for you. Buy really good-quality chocolate covered caramel candy. I bought the store brand the quality of the chocolate was not good and unfortunately that on its own took away the WOW factor when you bite into the cookie! The cookie dough softens pretty quickly so put it back in the fridge between batches. I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers and sprinkled some sea salt on the cookie balls before heading into the oven. We typically don't like things too sweet these days so I think that little bit of salt worked better for us than the additional sugar would have. Pretty good would have been better had I used higher-quality chocolate candy.

I thought these were just too sweet. Part of my review seems to be missing. I do remember the caramel and peanut butter cookie combination just not working for me and the caramel candy hardening as the cookie cooled. Interesting take on the peanut butter cookie and peanut butter cup combination either way.

Wasn t sure what chocolate covered caramel candies to use. I used chocolate covered caramel kisses. They were hard to cover with dough. Some od the cookies melted out. They were very yummy though!
