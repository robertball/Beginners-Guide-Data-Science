This recipe turned out great!  It was very moist and the really liked the taste of the pineapple and coconut in it.  However, next time I will substitute apple sauce for the oil and see how that turns out.  1 cup oil I thought was a lot of oil!!

This is some really good zucchini bread! I didn't drain the pineapple that great so mine was SUPER moist, a little too moist, but that was my fault. The flavor though, is awesome. I was out of pumpkin pie spice so I just used 1/2 teaspoon each nutmeg and ginger. My kids loved it too :)

This is an awesome recipe!!! Great flavours that aren't overpowering. VERY moist! I had a small problem ... not with the recipe, with my zucchini. When I grated up my zucchini, I didn't have quite 3 cups, so I grated up a carrot to make up the difference. Turned out great! This is a keeper!!!

The best!  I did what a few suggested: 1-squeeze the excess water from the zucchini, 2-at least double the spices, 3-add an extra 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 4- use 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp coconut extract.  Then a couple of my own: 1- forget the sour cream, 2- forget the oil completely, 3- when you drain the pineapple, reserve the juice, 4- replace the oil with 1/4 cup pineapple juice and 3/4 cup coconut cream (available at Trader Joe's).  These are HUGE calorie reducers and add a lot of flavor.  5- I also used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, 6- toast the coconut before adding (I used 3/4 cup).  I will be making this again......real soon!

Overabundance of zucchini prompted the search for this recipe.  This hit the spot...  Very moist & flavorful, only one change fm me (I used 1/2 WW flour, b/c I had lots on hand.)  This will be one of my "go to" recipes in the future.  Many thanks!!!

Amazing! I added extra spices and used 1/2c. applesauce and 1/2c. oil. Made a oatmeal/brown sugar/ butter mix. to put on top prior to baking which made it wonderul.  You will have to bake this a little longer than suggested otherwise the middle will come out gooey!  Great recipe SuzyQ thanks for sharing!

Tropical flavors are subtle, yet, still a nice option from traditional zucchini bread. I would up amount of coconut or add some pineapple & coconut flavoring next time. This made three loaves instead of two for me.

This makes a lot of batter and filled the loaf pans within an inch of the top. Let them bake for one hour and 5 minutes and they were done to perfection.  Used only cinnamon and my house smells like Christmas!  Love the 2 loaves it yields so I can share one with a neighbor.  Bread is dense, very flavorful and a very welcome addition to my recipe file.  Thank you!!

Moist, flavorful, and such a wonderful way to use up an abundance of zucchini this season! Having read about excess moisture in zucchini, I squeezed excess and drained pineapple the first time.  I I would not drain both next time...maybe just the pineapple. Also I didn't have coconut in the house and substituted w/ oatmeal and it was delicious.

This recipe is wonderful but I think it need more spices.  Not different spices, just more of what it already calls for.  I added almost twice as much and it was still pretty subtle spice flavor.  I made some into muffins and some in mini loaf pans. I added walnuts on top of some and left others without.  It's definitely ultra moist, it would almost be difficult to overbake this.  I like my quick breads really moist and tend to take them out earlier than most people - before the toothpick comes out clean.  With this bread, make sure it's all the way done otherwise it turns kind of gummy after sitting overnight but still really really delicious.

this recipe must be "idiot proof".  I became one of  "those people" that alter an original recipe rather than try it as stated first.  I made these muffins and "sort of" cut the recipe in half.  I added a mashed ripe banana, didn't even measure the zucchini, I had 3 medium sized ones that were going soft in the crisper. I only had 8 oz. of pinapple.   I added chopped walnuts.  I only had one egg, I messed up and forgot to half the sour cream.  And guess what, they are fabulous. Recipe made 6 XL muffins and 9 regular sized.  I baked the reg. sized for 20 min. at 350 degrees and the XL for 30 minutes.  Moist, didn't stick, don't fall apart, smell divine and oh so good with a schmear of butter.  Thanks for the motivation and base recipe.

This bread is very moist and a has nice flavor..I thought you would taste the pineapple and coconut more though. I might add more coconut next time and maybe some nuts.  Since the sugar was so high in this recipe I halved it and used Splenda and Splenda Brown Sugar for the other halves and nobody even noticed. I also used Fat Free sour cream.  Thank you for a good recipe, I will make it again.

I gave this a 5 star because it is a wonderful base recipe.  As others have said, the flavors need to be more intense.  I doubled the cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4th teaspoon cayenne pepper.  I used 1 cup coconut and 1 cup walnuts/pecans.  Used half oil and half applesauce.  This made 4 medium loaves and 1 small loaf and baked in 45 minutes.  It's a great recipe for texture and consistency ... Just needs a little more flavor.

I had to use margarine instead of the oil and omit the sour cream because I was out of both, and I doubled the coconut because DH loves it. It's super moist and a good snack bread, but the coconut taste wasn't noticeable at all, even when I had doubled it.

Wow!  This was great.  Squeeze the water out of the zucchini and press some of the juice out of the pineapple.  I did half vanilla extract and half coconut extract and it was delish! If you're using a Pampered Chef mini loaf pan, I baked it for about 35 minutes.

Absolutely delicious.  Gave me a chance to use up some reduced zucchini and coconut I had in the freezer for quite a while.  Moist, with a wonderful flavour.  I did used apple sauce instead of oil and would maybe cut back a little on the sugar next time.  Will definitely make again (hubby loved it).

My family absolutely loves this recipe. I make them into muffins and freeze them. Always great!

I made a alteration to the recipe. I used coconut oil instead of oil and didn't add coconut. Periodically I add chocolate chips. Mmmmm

I substituted apple sauce for the oil in this recipe and halved the sugar.  Everything else I followed to the letter.  Although the loaf looks beautiful and golden in the pan, it's taste is bland and very mild.  Next time I will a tiny bit more salt, butter flavoring and more cinnamon.  Moist and dense with a very nice texture.

Great stuff!  I was out of sour cream, so left it out of the mix.  I only put 1/2 c of oil and added 1/2 c of applesauce instead.  Topped the bread with walnuts for some crunch.  Excellent!!  This recipe made 4 mini-loaves, 4 medium loaves, and 1 large.  I used every bread pan I had . . . hope it freezes well!  :)

Instead of coconut, I used a cup of chopped black walnuts. Delicious. My family is crazy about it. We have black walnut trees, so we always have a nice supply.

This is the best zucchini bread I have ever had. It is moist and makes a bread like a tropical cake.  I made the recipe "as is" with no changes and plan to make another this week.

Very tasty! I altered it quite a bit but left base as indicated. I added konjac root powder (3tsps), fenugreek (3tsps as a galactagogue & blood sugar stabilizer) ground ginger (1tsp), unsweet flaked coconut, 1/2 cup chia seeds, 1/4 cup milled flax, coconut oil instead of veggie oil, coconut palm sugar instead of white sugar (all sugars I used 1/2 of what was indicated) and finally I used whole yogurt instead of sour cream. Very moist and delish! This is a great way to use all the zucchini growing in the garden this summer!

Very moist...delish! I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 veg oil, and added extra cinnamon as others had, it still could have used a little more spices and sugar but great none the less! I also used crookneck squash i had excess of instead of zucchini....great way to get rid of extra veggies you are getting sick of eating other ways. Instead of loaf pans I used regular and mini cupcake trays and made muffins, single serve, nothing to cut and great to throw in with lunch for work!

This was amazing.  I substituted coconut oil for vegetable oil and omitted the flaked coconut.  It was awesome and is now my permanent zucchini bread recipe!

This recipe is the BEST Zucchini Bread recipe ever!  For a more coconut flavor I used coconut oil.  I also found the hint from other reviewer to squeeze excess water from the zucchini to be spot on!  EXCELLENT recipe everyone I serve it to raves over it!

I really liked how moist this recipe was although a couple people from work who tried it couldn't taste the coconut at all but I won't ding the rating because of it because the flavor was great.

This is an all time favorite. I add walnuts, because everything tastes better with walnuts. I drain the pineapple and make a glaze with the juice and powdered sugar and drizzle it over after the bread is cooled.

Absolutely delicious! Made me think of a carrot cake. I sprinkled some coconut on top of the loaves before baking but other than that didn't change a thing. Whole family loved it. Will definitely be making this again!

Really liked this. Made it in a cake pan b/c of others saying it was mushy... This seemed to help, but it still took longer to bake, but worth it.

Tried this recipe for the first time.  Followed to the "T", but it seemed too mushy on the inside yet crusty on top.  Baked for a full 60 minutes.

i was a little unsure about the pineapple coconut combo. I'm always looking for different zucchini bread recipes. Now I have 3 that are a sure hit. The words very moist, delicious, and divine were used by my taste testers to describe this zucchini bread. This recipe is a keeper!!!

Great recipe. I made half the recipe for only 1 loaf. I used 5.5 ounces of drained pineapple since I never buy small cans of pineapple and the actual crushed pineapple from a 20oz can weighs out to 11oz .  Substituted applesauce for oil.  Added 1\2 tsp of coconut extract. 52 grams of chopped almonds.

Soooo good! Favorite zucchini bread ever. Everyone loved it. I’m making it again right now. I had better luck with the miniloaf pan. I had a hard time getting the reg size loaf pan to have center thoroughly baked. Recipe is so good would not change a thing —except for mini loaf pans— but I am not an infrequent baker so it may be just me.

Made this in two smaller baking dishes as it was too much for two loaf pans.  Brought it into work and was told by several people it was the best zucchini bread they ever had.  I did up the coconut to 1/2 cup.

A review I read suggested using pineapple juice and coconut cream for the oil and sour cream, and since I had both ingredients and no sour cream, I tried it.  It produced a wonderfully moist bread which I was very happy to share with my family.

I make 6-8 loaves at a time and have made this recipe probably 15 times and it is one of the two best recipes I have in my arsenal (Sam's Famous Carrot Cake is the other; it too has coconut and pineapple; starting to see a pattern!).  Everyone loves this bread exactly as-is.  I don't give 5 stars to hardly anything, but this deserves it.  And yes, you may have to adjust the baking times and only bring it out when the toothpick is almost clean (not the recipe's fault that your oven isn't the same as everyone else's :))

Substituted pumpkin pie spice with 1/2 tsp each of allspice and cardamon. Used 1c. of coconut oil rather than vegetable oil (made sure eggs at room temperature and coconut oil at liquid consistency). Increased flaked coconut to 1 c. and toasted. Baked in bundt pan at 325 for about 80 minutes. Glazed with lime juice, lime zest mixed with powdered suger. Super moist and limey zing was a nice contrast with sweetness of cake and cardamon flavor. (May increase cardamon to 1 tsp next time). I have a ton of shredded zucchini in the freezer from last year's crop. Very tasty way to use it up!

I poured 1/2 in the loaf pan and with the rest I made 10 muffins.  They turned out super moist and  very tasty.  I did reduce the white sugar by 1/4 c.

  Would make again.

I made this almost exactly, only I used half the oil. The pineapple and coconut just add a twist of flavor from the regular zucchini recipes. I doubled it and have shared with two friends who are asking for the recipe. Delicious!

I really liked the moist texture. I did add more coconut after reading some other reviews, but still found it a subtle addition.  I also decreased the sugar by half and found it plenty sweet.

This was the most moist loaf I have ever made!  I used applesauce instead of oil and used nutmeg instead of pumpkin spice. Baked about 65 minutes. Love it!  Will make again and again!

I made this recipe but made into muffins. They were very good. very moist! but next time I think I am going to do as other people suggested I will put coconut extract as you could taste the coconut or the pineapple. so might as pineapple juice too.

This recipe was disappointing.  The bread was very moist and required more cooking time.  It was too sweet for my liking.  The flavor combinations were good.  I doubled the spices base on other reviews.  Would try again with modifications.

Nutritious, delicious and super easy! 
Subbed applesauce instead of oil.
Added pecan on top.  Next time will crush some into the batch or try walnut instead.
Added more shredded coconut on the top before baking for more flavor and look.
Thank you for this great recipe!

I subbed applesauce for the oil and kept everything else the same.  The texture and spice was really good but you couldn't really taste the pineapple.

So moist and people who said "WHAT? I don't like Zucchini" tried and loved it! I took the leftovers and cut the slices in half - spread Vanilla Curd on it like a sandwich and cut them into small bite size pieces and OMG can't describe how good that was!!!!!

The bread tastes good......BUT it took WAY longer than an hour to actually cook all the way through.  I had to bake it an extra 30-40 minutes.  It does taste yummy, but the consistency is a bit mushy, not very bready.

I halved the recipe, used whole wheat flour instead, and didn't have the vanilla on hand - so I omitted it, and it was still delicious. My kids loved it.
