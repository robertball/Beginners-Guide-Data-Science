My family really liked this recipe.  I did change a couple of things to suit my taste.  I used 1 cup havarti cheese, 1 cup sharp cheddar, and 1 cup Monterey jack, added 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon garlic pepper, and sprinkled Parmesan on top.  We just like spicy!

WOW!  This recipe is great AS IS.  The Harvarti cheese makes for a nice change from traditional potato recipes.  I have made this four times in three weeks and always get rave reviews.  Only complaint is that Havarti is somewhat expensive.  I found that some major grocery stores also carry it in the dairy isle with the other block cheeses, much less expensive than buying from the deli.

I think I'd try some of the suggestions here...more potatoes, less (or lower fat!) cream...I love cheese and potatoes, but agree, this was a little oily.  I'd make it again with modifications.

I'm not sure what I was expecting.. but this wasn't it...   but my guests said it was good, so either my taste buds were off or they were just being polite!

They came out very tasty. I really liked them. Two things: I don't think I used enough potatoes-it was very oily. Also, this cheese is really expensive. It was $8.58/lb at my supermarket deli. Tasted great though! I will try it again with more potatoes.

This is always a big hit, and very adaptable. I always sprinkle some dill on the layers. Sometimes it curdles, so cook it on a lower temp, cover for a bit, then remove the foil, increase the temp to brown the top.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner. My biggest pan would not fit more than about 3 lbs. of potatoes, couldn't find heavy cream so I ended up using 2 cups of light cream, 2 cups FF 1/2 & 1/2, and 2 cups Havarti with 1 cup 2% fat sharp cheddar cheese. I can't tell you all the raves I go on these potatoes. Next time I will use only FF 1/2 & 1/2 and the same combo of cheese. Try these you won't regret it.

This was a great recipe. Next time I'll cut the cream in half and use whole milk. I'll also add some chopped onion.

I agree with the others that this is oily, very oily.  I even added a little more potatoes.  It's very "heavy" on the stomach.  Good taste, but we felt like we gained five pounds!  Won't make again.

As most other people have mentioned in their reviews, this was a FABULOUS recipe.  I really enjoyed it, everyone I served it to really enjoyed it.  I did add garlic powder and a bit of onion powder.  Next time I will do a mixture of regular havarti and dill havarti.  I did not find it to be greasy at all.  EXCELLENT.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe.  Havarti cheese gives it a totally new taste from the usual scalloped potatoes.  My husband loved it!  This recipe is definately a keeper.

Love this recipe. Have made it several times, but I actually use a different cheese everytime. I used a chipotle white vermont cheddar which gave it a nice southwestern flavor.

The Havarti cheese really goes well in this dish.  It was excellent made just as is.

I have made this recipe so many times now that I don't have to refer to the recipe anymore!  I feed a family of 6, including 4 teenagers, and I always use a 5-lb bag of yukon gold potatoes, 16 oz of havarti and keep the cream at 3 cups.  This is now our traditional Christmas dinner potato dish.  I have also made this with havarti w/ dill to serve with the broiled talapia parmasean (this site) and it goes wonderful with the fish.  I've also made it with an addition of garlic and rosemary to serve with lamb - fabulous!  I've made this with various combinations of cream, half & half, milk, etc. and it always comes out really well, but the cream is the BEST.  The havarti is expensive so we only have it on special occasions, and leftovers (if there are any!) never last long.  Everyone I've served this to has absolutely LOVED it.  Don't serve it to guests unless you plan to have the recipe printed out and ready to give away!

Loved this recipe. Much better than I expected. I did use more potatoes than it called for so I didn't experience the "oilyness" that some mentioned. I will be making this recipe again tonight, but I don't have enough heavy cream so I am trying 1 cup condensed milk instead.

I've made this recipe 8 times now including every Thanksgiving for the past 4 years.  It is extremely simple and always a hit with several people asking for the recipe after eating it!

This was the BEST!!!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using the chicken bullion.  I would not omit that next time (I just didn't have it on hand), as it needed the salt.  But this will become a holiday staple.
