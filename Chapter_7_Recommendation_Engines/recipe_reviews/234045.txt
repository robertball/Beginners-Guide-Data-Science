This was good!  I halved the recipe and served this over cauliflower rice.  Oh and I added broccoli :)

I made this tonight and loved it! Had to sub out some things. Added more broth as I was short coconut milk. Used dried basil, eye balled it. Used honey instead of maple syrup. Skipped the lime leaves (next time I make it I will add fresh lime juice to finish it). I used hosin sauce instead of fish sauce. Even with all that and being my first Thai curry it was amazing! I also little it simmer for hours which helped thicken it.

I put some jicama in it for crunch value but it unfortunately made it too sweet, so would use less maple syrup next time.  The flavor was otherwise quite nice.  I will make it again.  Note: you can dry lemon grass quite easily and then grind it and use it as you would any other herb.
