This recipe was great! I was looking for something to make with the leftover spiral ham I had. My friends tol me to make pea soup but I knew my kids wouldn't like that. This recipe was perfect. All the ingredients were already in my house. I used the ham which I chopped finely with my food processor. The only thing is betweem the saltiness of the ham and chedder cheese, this really doesn't need the additional saly. Skip it or it gets too salty. Overall a great way to use the leftover ham, one that even the kids will love!

I love ham croquettes.  I used to eat them with my grandma.  There was two restaurants left that served them. One is closed down and one is 1 1/2 hours from me. Either way I found this recipe. I used 1 slice of pre-cooked Smithfield hardwood smoked center cut slice and shredded it. It is more similar to the ham used at the restaurants anyway. And, I have never eaten them made with ham lunch meat. I got 24 golf ball sized croquettes, which I shaped into little football shaped ovals like the restaurants.  When I re-heat I might serve with a white or bechamel sauce, like I remember as a kid, with a little chopped parsley for garnish.  And they are good with mashed potatoes and southern vegetables as a side. I think I will make this every Easter with some of that leftover fresh ham.  Thank you submitter.

I've made this twice now & both times turned out delicious.  However, the 2nd time, after I finely chopped the ham & added the veggies, bread crumbs & eggs, I used a hand blender to give it that final "paste-like" texture before dredging & frying.  It came out way better like this, I think. I chose to omit the cheese this time as well-just because we didn't feel like it & it still turned out great. Thanks for the great recipe!

Even though I was hesitant to use the amount of bread crumbs in the recipe, I went ahead, and I wish I'd gone with my gut. These were basically bread croquettes with a little ham in them. I know that a filler is necessary in a croquette, but this was just way too much. In recipes like these, I find that the cheese flavor can get lost, and this was definitely the case here, where the cheese had a lot of bread to compete with. I also didn't care for the garlic powder.

These were alot of fun to make! I used 4c. of leftover Ham, and I used my "Slap and Chop" to dice up the meat, WORKS GREAT! We also made a cheese sace to go with them RECIPE FOR CHEESE SAUCE::... 2TBL Butter ... 2TBL Flour ... 1tsp salt ... 1cup milk ... 1cup shredded cheddar cheese ... 1tsp prepared mustard ... salt and pepper to taste : INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHEESE SAUCE::: In a med size sauce pan, melt butter. Mix in flour and salt. stir continually until the mixture simmers, it won't take long so have your milk measured & ready! Slowly pour milk into the mixture and continue stirring until mixture has thickened and looks like a white sauce. Stir in cheese and mustard and continue stirring until cheese is melted & mixture is smooth. Add salt and pepper, if you want. Serve Warm. We also use this cheese sauce on homemade pretzels....very tasty!!!  " Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding" ~Proverbs 3:5

These are very good.  I have never had ham croquettes before so I really have nothing to compare them to but they were super easy to make and yummy.  I used the some left-overs form a spiral ham that I had made and just chopped it up.  It worked very well and is a nice change from ham and eggs again!! :o)  The only other change was to use fresh garlic.  Thanks for a yummy new dinner idea!!

Quite salty even without adding the salt in the recipe.  My husband really enjoyed them.  Served with Honey Mustard sauce from this site and fresh vegetables to counter some of the salt.

This recipe is a good start but I found it far to "bready" for our tastes. I left out the added salt based on the advice I read but I ended up having to add salt while eating them. Next time I will double the amount of ham and reduce the bread crumbs inside. They looked awesome and browned well.

I used my leftover spiral ham for this recipe, but simmered it first to get rid of the extra salt. Obviously didn't add any more salt to the mixture. Threw in a few more seasonings and coated it with a mix of bread crumbs and parm. Different and good. Thanks!

Excellent use of leftover ham.  I halved the recipe because there are only 2 of us and it still works (using 2 eggs in the batter and 1 egg for breading without any water).  I also used panko for bread crumbs on inside of croquette and rolled in corn flake crumbs on outside for breading.  This gave it a little more depth to the flavor.  I didn't think it needed any extra salt added.  Ham was salty enough.  We ended up with 3 each for dinner and 2 each for breakfast the next day.

Delicious.  Very good use of leftover Ham from Easter. Did not add any salt as the ham was already salty enough. Also substituted 1/2 cup of parmesan for some of the breadcrumbs.

I grew up eating Salmon croquettes, so was intrigued when I saw this recipe. 
I think this is a good recipe, but the texture of the ham after being fried is kind of gooey and unappealing.  The taste is super salty (and I might even call myself a sodium addict).  I think I will try this next with chicken or something less salty as a protein.  
I served it with honey mustard, as someone previously suggested which cut the salty taste a bit.  
The recipe made about 25 balls for me (I flatten them kind of like small patties). I fried up half and froze the other half individually on a cookie sheet then stored them. We'll see how they keep.

I added (4 servings) of mashed potatoes to get a more Spanish ham croquettas feel/taste.  Delicious!    It's not very flavorful, it's not suppose to be, as it's a starch side dish.  Would make again!

I grew up eating ham and turkey croquettes and was SO excited to find this recipe!  I made a honey mustard sauce to serve on the side...mmmm!  I made extras so that I could send my boyfriend to work with leftovers and while I was cleaning up I looked over to find him hovering over the plate eating the rest!  I will definitely make this again - thanks!

I used fresh garlic but I didn't have any green onion. I substituted the sliced ham for diced ham steaks. I also used super sharp cheddar since one review said there was not much flavor. I served them with a honey mustard sauce and they went over really well.

I had bought a ham and since there are just 2 of us, even the smallest ham I could find was sure to be enough for several meals.  I came across this recipe while looking for things to do with the leftovers after a traditional ham dinner was finished.  These were delicious.  I have had chicken croquettes before but never ham, so I wasn't sure how good they would be.  I'm very glad I gave them a go.  I had to substitute shallot for the onion since my last onion went bad on me.  I also used panko in the croquettes and Italian breadcrumbs for the coating.  Of course I used leftover ham instead of lunch-meat too. Otherwise kept the recipe as stated.  Served with sauteed asparagus and it was a wonderful dinner.  I'll make these again next time I have leftover ham.  These would also be wonderful as an appetizer for a party.  Thanks for the recipe!

I fine-tuned the recipe a little bit. First of all used rice bread to make the bread crumbs because my mom has celiac disease. Secondly, I did not use 3 cups of bread crumbs.. only around 2 and that was still too much. Thirdly, I made this a spanish-version. So I added jalapeno and paprika. Lastly, I used a combination of marbled Cheddar and mozzarella along with a bagged Italian cheese blend mixture. Yielded very very delicious outcome. Both my mom and I loved it. It actually wasn't that hard.

I thought the texture on this was way off. I hesitated adding the breadcrumbs but decided to stay true to the recipe, and I really regret it. I will not be making this again.

These were a decent way to use up leftover ham, but not something I would make very often.  Also, I found that they don't keep well and taste a little off if you try to reheat the next day so I would only make enough to finish eating the same day you make them.  I served with mustard and dill pickle slices.

This is the only time my very finicky daughter ate ham and cheese together.  and loved it.  Meanwhile, oddly enough, my boys who love ham and cheese did not care for these.  go figure.  My husband and I had these as a late night snack with the chicken croquettes and were quite satisfied.

Excellent. Like most of my cooking, I used this as a jumping off platform. The cheese I used was Sargento Mexican Blend which was a perfect cheese for this. I added about a Tablespoon of JD Hickory Smoke mustard and about 3 Tablespoons of Hellman's light mayo to the mix. My breadcrumbs were an Italian seasoned flavor, and I used Ritz cracker crumbs on the outside because I ran out.

I made these with our leftover holiday ham.  I used the food processor to cut up the ham into a consistency where we would have pieces of ham but not chunks.  I omitted the garlic (not garlic lovers) and fried in olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter.  I used panko breadcrumbs for the outer coating.  Recipe made 9 nice-sized patties.  They were delicious.  I will definitely make these again.

I normally don't write reviews. I actually just used the recipe with ground Turkey and I did not use the cheese as all the croquette's I have ever had didn't have it. We used Peanut Oil for frying and I actually double rolled them in bread crumbs. It was a win all around! Next time I plan on using a food processor to combine it all together a little better and easier to roll them. Either way it was delicious and my husband who makes dinner 99.9% of the time was impressed I actually made them (I don't care to touch raw meat with my hands) and he gave me a high five. Haha  Wins all around!

This was a great recipe. I did not use the last egg and then coat them in breadcrumbs and they were still delicious and tasty. I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Would make again

I made this recipe similar to the picture, forming the mixture into small log shapes. Given the shape and contents, my family has dubbed this recipe as "Meat Twinkies". They are delicious, but heavy on the gut. I used my food processor to chop the ham and I think that made the texture better. Also, I ran out of bread crumbs so I dredged half the croquettes in matzo ball mix (essentially seasoned cracker crumbs) and we all thought the matzo meal croquettes were tastier than the ones dredged in bread crumbs. Additionally we dipped ours in various mustards and ketchup and it worked really well this way. This is a fantastic recipe to use up left over ham!

I've made this for quite a few years with our leftover Christmas ham. My family looks forward to it almost as much as Christmas itself. I did change one thing though, I made my croquettes more like a patty in shape as I found it cooks a bit more evenly for me.

Very good but too many breadcrumbs.  It tended to fall apart when frying.  I fried instead of deep fried.   Next time I would add fewer bread crumbs and maybe some oil or mayo to help keep it together.  Creative way to use up left over ham in a completely new meal.

Followed the recipe, although made a smaller amount for just my husband and me.  We made a simple white sauce flavored with a hint of spicy mustard to serve over the croquettes, and they were delicious!

Really good!  I did not add as much bread crumbs since I read that on a couple reviews.  Also, I think the amount of salt to add is really dependent on the ham - some are much saltier than others.  And to make it a lot healthier, I made them in my air fryer.  Cooked great without the added fat and oil.  An awesome way to use that leftover holiday ham!

I made some changes on the recipe(I swiped the cheddar for danbo since i don't like cheddar very much, and used parsley instead of green onions), but other than that they turned out great! I really liked them and so did my sister, it's a great recipe.

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/81452/ham-croquettes/ ... 1 10 17  I followed the recipe - except didn't fry, just panfried in butter.  These fell apart eventhough I refrig'd for an hour.  They were delicate so I didn't attempt the egg before the breadcrumbs.  These smelled good, but, weren't a hit.

This recipe was delicious! I used a hand operated meat grinder, for the ham, & Panko bread crumbs. My family loved them, even picky toddlers! My daughter made some dipping sauces, for them, (spicy Sriracha mayo, grainy Dijon mustard, regular prepared mustard & honey mustard) they tasted great, alone or with any dipping sauce.

I was not impressed. The ratio of ham to bread was way off. Found it dry. I would double the ham or half the bread. Next time I will use potatoes in the croquettes and bread just on the outside.

I halved the recipe and it made 8 croquettes, which was plenty for my family. I had a nice whole ham I baked so chopped my ham from that, which, I feel would be better than lunch meat.  As suggested by another reviewer, I omitted the cheese and salt. I used panko crumbs on inside of croquette and rolled the croquettes in corn flake crumbs. With the modifications, suggested by another reviewer, they turned out great.

Very good! I agree, I will cut back on the breadcrumbs. May add some horseradish to give them a little zip, too. I made them early in the day and just popped them in the oven for dinner. Froze the rest. Great for a quick dinner! Thank you!

Great recipe.  I used left over ham that I minced and I used fresh garlic (about a tablespoon, minced).  I did not add salt as the ham I used was salty enough.  I also took the idea from a different recipe and used 1/4 cup of mayo. I decided to use Panko bread crumbs for the coating and they tuned out moist and flavorful as well as crispy.  I finished them off in the oven as the middle didn't seem to be hot enough when I taste tested.  I think these would be great with a sauce as well.  Thanks for sharing this one!

I also did not include the salt (ham is already very salty and we are watching our sodium intake). I had a leftover ham, so I diced it very small - took a little longer than using packaged ham, but worked just fine. No green onion, so I just left it out. Used a Mexican blend and Italian blend, since that's what I had opened up in the fridge. I think this recipe is forgiving enough that small changes won't hurt it - it is just toooooo yummy!! It smelled so good, I wanted to eat the mixture before I had added the eggs. We don't normally eat fried foods, so this was a little hard on mine and hubbys bellies, I think we may try to bake them next time. Going to follow the directions for breading them and then cook them on parchment paper. I'll try spraying them with a cooking spray to help crisp them up.

We loved it. My kids are not fans of split pea soup and I had a lot of leftover ham. I will definitely make these again.

Had some ham that was leftover and a bit dry...this is the perfect recipe.  We will certainly make it again.

We really disliked this.  In fact, we each tried one and gave the rest to the dogs.  There was no real flavor.
