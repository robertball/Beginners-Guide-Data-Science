These eggs were good but, honestly, I didn't think there was anything to really distinguish them from many other recipes.  If I were to make again, I'd probably add more dill relish because that may be the one thing that could differentiate them from deviled eggs that I've made all my life.  And please don't take this review as negative because they were tasty, but I guess I was looking for something really different.

This is a good basic deviled eggs, but I think the quality of the relish may be why I wasn't as crazy about it.

I really liked these!  Now, deviled eggs aren't my thing, so I don't have much to compare them to, but I really enjoyed these.  I made them using pickled eggs and 1/2ed the recipe for 5 eggs.  I chose to decrease the sugar and I'm glad I did because I think the full amount would have been a tad much for my tastes.  I love the dill relish and yellow mustard.  THANKS for the recipe!  (And, if you haven't tried PICKLED deviled eggs yet, DO IT!)

It really came out well but I did make a substitution.
In place of the dill pickle relish, sugar and vinegar I used sweet pickle juice .   The entire family felt these were the best deviled eggs I had ever made.
Thanks

I made this per the instructions. It was just OK; hence the 3 stars. I didn’t care for the Apple Cidar vinegar and relish taste.

They were really good, but I added more apple cider vinegar than noted here. I used Dijon mustard. I left out the sugar and the relish. I also almost never use salt and pepper.

I did not make any changes to this recipe and they turned out great. This will be my “go to” recipe for deviled eggs from now on.

This is a good, quick, easy recipe for deviled eggs.  I substituted sweet pickle relish for the dill relish and left out the sugar.

Love these!  Taste like the ones my mom used to make.  Would leave out the sugar next time.  Sprinkled them with paprika and celery salt.  Eggcellent for Easter!

Closest measured recipe I have found to make deviled eggs the way my mom does (who, of course, never measures anything). Only four stars because, well, they're not quite mom's! Also, I like to chop the eggs whole and add doubled quantities of the other ingredients to make a great egg salad.

I chopped up some tangy dill pickles and used that. Generally the same, just tasted and adjusted as I went. Delicious!

I used sweet relish and eliminated the sugar. I also increased the amount of relish and mayo as I like my filling to be creamier.   Easy Peasy!
