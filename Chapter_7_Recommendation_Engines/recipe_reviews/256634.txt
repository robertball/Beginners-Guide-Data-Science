Wow this is a great dinner and fast too.  I used very thinly sliced skirt steak and didn't have a lot of time to marinate it.  The potatoes were crispy and golden brown.  The steak only takes a minute or two to cook and tasted like I had cooked it outdoors on the grill. (I love hot the grill pan gets)  I steamed some broccoli and dinner was on the table in no time flat.  Awesome!

The marinade for this skirt steak was very good, I did marinate mine for 8 hours...and the pre-heated Induction oven grilled this to perfection in under 3 minutes to a perfect medium rare.  The roasted potatoes got crispy and crunchy on the outside just like I like them!  I served the steak and potatoes with a side of oven roasted Brussels sprouts...what a lovey Sunday dinner!

I just marinated the steak for about 4 hours and then grilled it on a gas grill.  I did make roasted red potatoes, but used another recipe for that.  My husband RAVED about the steak!

This makes a great meal and takes very little time to prepare.
I tossed a little fresh parsley into the potatoes because I had extra to use up, otherwise made as directed. My family enjoyed it!

This was such a quick dinner to get together and was a hit with my family!  My steak only marinated for about 15 minutes, but, it was infused with flavor.  The potatoes were crisp and the steak cooked to medium rare which is just the way we like it.   Make sure you cut the skirt steak against the grain and it will be even more tender.  Thanks for the recipe!
