I thought the blending of the spices on this was perfect.  You could taste a hint of everything without any one spice being overpowering. Thanks for sharing.

Jam-packed with SUPERFOODS like Onions, Garlic, Ginger, Kale, Sweet Potato, Tomato, Lime and Black Eyed Peas!  You can't go wrong here, it's wonderfully flavourful.  A taste of the Caribbean!  Loved it!!  Thank you Traci B.

I was worried it could end up kinda strange with all the different ingredients in it. It was not strange at all. The best thing I have made in a long time!

The reviews were not helpful so I decided to try the soup anyway.  I must say it was delicious.  The favors were so well blended.  I must admit I added a little salt and black pepper.  The aroma was wonderful.  Thank you so much for sharing. I will definitely make this again.

The lime did it. It is a sweet soup. I made it the day before and just put the lime juice on the table and told guest to add a few drops. They loved it!

I recommend you use stock rather than broth since it's more flavorful!  You can up the spices if you prefer.   I like to puree a little bit of the veggies to add into my stock as well.

I liked this soup but found the flavour a bit bland. It is super healthy so I will make it again, but next time will probably double the spices!

I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 1 only because of the nutritional value of this soup. I am so sorry, but this was terrible. I followed the directions exactly except I didn't have thyme, so I used rosemary and I also used home-made vegetable stock. Maybe that's what my error was, I don't know, but we couldn't eat it. I did notice that the soup seemed a little more edible before I put in the lime juice.

Delicious. I've made this twice--the first time I didn't have all the spaces, but it was still good. This time I had everything and it's wonderful. Make sure to add the lime juice gradually--it can overwhelm the soup if you add too much. My only substitution was collards for kale since that's what I had. I put them in with the sweet potatoes so they would cook enough.

Deeelish!!  This soup is fantastic!  The only change I made was to use black beans in place of back-eyed peas due to a mistake in reading the ingredients but the flavors and textures still meshed together wonderfully!  Thanks for this keeper!!  Oh i also used fresh lime :)

Pretty bland.  I would have added some orange juice to complement the soup's other spices if I had had it on hand.  Will not make again.

I think some people would really like this soup. It was not my favorite. It has good coconut flavor if you like that and it is very healthy and easy to make.

I made this for a nice change and it's delicious. I changed the Kale for a can of Jamaican Callaloo I got in the grocery store.

I made this following the recipe to a T. I add sweet potato (cassava) and coconut milk for more substance. It also helps thicken the soup a bit.
when thick you can eat it with rice.

Ignore the reviews saying this is bland! Very good, full of superfoods and easy to make. I would recommend adding a bit of cayenne pepper or a scotch bonnet to "season" the pot - I used both. Slice a few slits into the pepper and toss it in whole. This will release the great flavor without too much of the heat. Remove the pepper before serving.

Really good soup though I did change it quite a bit. I used only fresh vegetables.  I thought vegetable stock would be too bland so I used chicken bouillon and cooked the peas in water I'd boiled two ham hocks in and added some of the water to the soup.  I used both kale and collards.  I added an extra teaspoon of ginger, an extra cup of coconut milk and puree some of the peas to thicken the broth, as someone suggested, to serve over rice.  After one day, I no longer tasted the coconut which was present when I first made it and I really liked.  The predominant flavor is now the ginger which I also like.  I will have to play with this recipe to get the right combination of flavors, but I really like the recipe and will make it over and over again.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. The one change I always make is the addition of a Scotch bonnet pepper (finely chopped and added with the garlic and ginger - be careful not to breathe the steam!) or two. They add a pleasant degree of heat (well, pleasant by my heat tolerance, anyway!) and also a more distinctively Caribbean flavour.

Also, if you are not purely vegetarian, adding a fish fillet or two ( I just drop them in whole at the same time as the sweet potatoes, and gradually break them up as they cook) is a nice way to make it a little more robust. I don't always do that, but sometimes I do if I feel like having a little extra protein.

I loved it! I used water instead of oil as I want to reduce the calories. It worked, it just needed to be cooked ten minutes instead of 5 minutes. I also added a fresh tomato and a half cup of corn kernels (canned, but no salt) and no salt added beans (there's tons of sodium in most canned beans). Lastly, as a vegan, I used vegetables cubes (one salted, one no salt added) to create the brouillion. It was excellent!!! :-) Thank you, Traci!!!! :) :) :)

Very nice soup!  I had never had a callaloo but was familiar with each ingredient and actually had pretty much everything in stock.  I had roasted vegetable last week and so had leftover sweet potato chunks on hand.  I used ground ginger as I didn't have any fresh ginger.  I used lite coconut milk--so I might have saved a few fat calories.  Delish!!

I liked this soup for the nutrition.I added black beans instead of peas. I also added salt and a little jerk seasoning to amp up the flavor.  I served it over quinoa. It could also be served over brown rice.

This is one of the greatest tast I've tried, ginger and coconut milk gives a very good twist to Kale, thanks for sharing the recipe.
