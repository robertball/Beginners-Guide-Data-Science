Super easy!! I made it for after church in the crockpot and used Busch's baked homestyle beans! Minus the brown sugar, it was a huge hit!  Will definitely make it again!

Really good.  Too hot - will cut back on pepper next time.  But otherwise excellent.

After paying $13.00 for baked beans in a cafe, I decided to make my own.  These tasted better than the cafe beans and were a fraction of the price.  Great for breakfast or lunch.  Also good with ribs at a BBQ.  I didn't have any beef and left it out, still was great and very filling.

My family loved this recipe. I mixed it exactly as written but cooked them in the crockpot and they were a huge hit at the family barbecue.  This recipe makes quite a large amount and the small amount leftover were great the next day.  I plan to make them again for the upcoming Memorial weekend.  Kudos, great recipe!

I added 1/2 lb of sweet Italian sausage, 1 crushed clove of garlic, doubled the amount of ketchup, BBQ sauce, and molasses. Cooked covered in oven @ 275 for 4 hours, stirring every hour.  Absolutely fabulous!  My book club raved about it.  NOTE: Brown bacon first, and put aside.  Then brown beef, sausage, garlic and onion, and mix with bacon.  Otherwise beef, sausage and onion will burn while you wait for bacon to cook.

This was a hit yesterday for Father's Day. I doubled the recipe and cooked in the crock pot. Not a drop left for leftovers.

Most of my family doesn't like baked beans using more than one type of bean, but this was a hit and everyone loved it!!

I loved this recipe.  The variety of beans adds a new dimension of texture and flavor.  Made the day ahead, and the tastes blended nicely.  Will make again.  Just set a little Beano out with it, and your guests will devour it without hesitation!    :~)

This is my go- to recipe now for "baked beans" I put 2 cups of presoaked dry pinto or bolita beans in to the crockpot on high with some chicken broth,  cook them until  done, about 4 hours. Then I drain the beans, reserving the liquid to put back as needed. Put the beans back into the crockpot with the seasonings. I omit the white sugar, I double the kechup and BBQ sauce, add about a teaspoon of minced garlic (I like garlic!)   Heat for about another hour or so until the flavors blend. Sometimes I omit the bacon and burger.   Comes out perfect!  Nice sweet-spicey flavor.

Great flavor.  My only complaint was there  wasn't enough sauce and the beans were a bit dry.  Next time I'll increase the sauce ingredients by 50%.

These were so hearty and good! I added some sausage to the meat blend and also added 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce. We took them to our church small group meeting, and they were an absolute hit! These baked beans (with the slight mods) are our new favorite. I'm already looking forward to making another batch.

This is a new favorite!  The blend of beans always catches the attention of the guests.  the blend of flavors is unique.  It satisfies the guests so what more could I ask?  left overs are even taken home and eaten for lunch.
