I am Jayme. I've done a little playing around with this recipe since submitting it, and wanted to pass along some of the things I've done. First, for a low calorie version, you can use 1/4 brown sugar baking splenda instead of 1/2 cup brown sugar, and use fat free mayonnaise instead of regular. About a month ago, I was playing around with this recipe and added 1 cup of craisins, 2 diced braeburn apples, and 2 broiled and diced chicken breasts. I took it for Mother's Day and everyone loved it, and although I still love the original recipe to go with a simple dinner of burgers, hot dogs, or sloppy joes, the updated version is my new favorite salad to take for pot lucks and to serve with pork chops.

This came out really good! I was a little leary, as it's completely different from the way I normally make cole slaw, but I went ahead anyway and I'm glad I did. It is sweet, but in a good way. The only change I made was to use a bag of pre-shredded cabbage/carrots instead of shredding my own cabbage. I will definitely make this again!

Some recipes have so many things added to give you bells and whistles it's difficult to remember what you're eating. This recipe is simple, few ingredients and anything but boring. Truly a great coleslaw and one that goes well with everything from Carolina pulled pork to burgers and dogs off the grill. This is a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a very simple cole slaw.  I am using to top NC style pulled pork bbq sandwiches and needed a slaw to whip up on my lunch break from work.  It has the perfect taste and texture for what I am using it for.  At first, the color kind of set me back (I'm from VA, cole slaw is white there), but it will go well with the vinegary bbq.  I followed another reviewers advice, used a bag of the preshredded cabbage and halved the recipe.  Perfect.  I added maybe another tablespoon of mayo to thicken it up a little, but other than that the flavor is great.  It will be amazing once it's chilled.  For the record, anytime I make a salad (potato, macaroni, pasta, slaw) it always needs to chill for awhile.  If anyone is trying this recipe without chilling it first and giving it a bad review, then try it again and let it sit for awhile.  The flavors need to blend.

add finely chopped celery (omit celery seed if too much of a good thing) and half a green pepper for an even better recipe!

This was good. Very good. It was one of many I tried my hand at making one evening for a fish fry. It was the closest to what you come to think of as a cole slaw.

It was very quick and easy and it makes ALOT of cole Slaw.  I used a few bags of the pre-shredded cabbage, both green and red. I also added some shredded carrots for more color.  I may cut down on the apple cider vinegar next time and add a bit more mayo or even a touch of sour cream or yogurt to be a little more creamy.  A good standard- thanks!

Never having made "homemade" coleslaw before, I was asked to make some for a funeral.  I used this recipe except for the slaw I added carrots, onions & green pepper.  I asked everyone for their honest opinion & it got rave reviews!  Thanks!

Too much vinegar for my taste. I made it a little more creamy by just adding more of the mayo. Nice easy recipe. Will use again!

I liked the flavor, but there was way too much dressing.  Maybe the cabbage shrunk more because I added salt (and cayenne for flavor), but I had to add an additional two cups of cabbage at least.

Awesome recipe!  I used 1/3 C of everything for pre-bagged cabbage/carrot slaw.  Perfect amount of dressing - really good with pulled BBQ pork sandwiches.

The dressing for this coleslaw is REALLY good - love the celery seed in it.  I put a variety of vegetables in it (cabbage, carrots, radishes - whatever's around) and the dressing makes it delicious.  I may try it with broccoli and cauliflower pieces!  Thanks!

I don't normally make traditional cole slaw (I usually make it Asian style), but this is a really good standard recipe. I made Po' Boys for lunch and wanted an easy slaw to top them. I added some carrots to mine and only made 1/4 the recipe since I only wanted enough to top two sandwiches. It turned out great and I'd probably use this recipe again if I ever need to make quick slaw.

Very simple and delicious, but it makes a lot of sauce.  I used only half for a bag of cole slaw.

fantastic. I was low on ingredients (no celery seed for me) but was able to make this super tasty cole slaw anyway! The dressing is delicious. I added some onion to it for some added flavor, and used Nayonaise for a lighter, non-egg mayo. Thanks!!

I liked it. It is a little on the strong side but that is how I like things! I like being able to taste it! I did add carrot to it as well. This would be good with any dish.

I love all cole slaw, but wanted to try something a bit different.  I should have read the reviews before I made this. I agree with others...WAY, WAY too much vinegar and very soupy.  I had to double the amount of cabbage and add more mayo.  After that, it was just OK.

Awesome basic recipe! Sweet and tangy without the heavy mayo taste of most cole slaws. I used these ingredients exactly as shown.  I then added a variety of veggies!  Try it...you won't have any regrets!!

I was searching for recipes that use raw apple cider vinegar—it's such a healthy food to add to your diet—and came across this. It probably would have been great following the recipe exactly, but I made the following changes:  - To make it healthier, I used 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup plain yogurt.  - I used both red and white cabbage, as I like the spiciness and color of the red.  - I added 1 green onion, 1 carrot, and 2 banana peppers for color and flavor. It was very good; I'd definitely make it again. By the way, I disagree with some of the previous posters about cutting back the amount of vinegar—I didn't find the amount overwhelming at all, and I think it would likely have been bland with less.

I tried this at first and although good I decided instead to experiment. I bought a bag of pre shredded angel hair cabbage and a small bottle of Marzzela's slaw dressing. In a bowl I added the cabbage, 2 stalks of copped celery, 3 quarter medium sized onion and shred a small carrot to it as well. Here is the fun part and sooo good, I bought a small can of pineapple chunks, added all, I then included a few handfuls of small marshmallows, a tbs of cider vinegar, teaspoon of sugar, dash of salt and pepper and wow!

This is a great tasting recipe and so easy. I made half a recipe as I had only a half head of cabbage.  I added a grated carrot and some grated onion.  I will make this again.

I used a 14 ounce bag of Dole Classic Cole slaw with HALF of the recipe for the dressing. It turned out PERFECT!

Very good and easy to make with simple ingredients.  I didn't have mayo, so I used lowfat vanilla yogurt.  Came out fine with less fat and calories! I also, used regular vinegar.  Tasted good!  I liked that it wasn't a long list of ingredients.  I did make in the morning and let it chill until dinner time.

Simple, easy, and delicious. I like that it doesn't have a heavy mayonnaise component, so that it's lighter and sweeter. I'm surprised that no salt is necessary.

I made the Teriyaki Onion burger recipe from this site and thought this would be a good side.  It certainly was...and couldn't be easier to put together...but I did add some grated carrot for a little extra color.

Great cole slaw dressing.  Added a few extra veggies to add some color: red onion, celery, green pepper, carrot, and apple.  Plus a tablespoon of lemon juice.  Great flavors!

This was a great recipe. I halved the dressing recipe and used 1 bag of broccoli slaw, added 1 sm. can chunk pineapple, drained & 1 cup walnut pieces. My 16 yr. old loved it!

This slaw is SWEET (tasting, I mean)...little too much for me, but the hubby liked it fine.  Will make again, but will cut back on the brown sugar & cider vinegar a bit.  Also, I liked the ease of preparation.

It was a really easy recipe to throw together as a BBQ side dish.  I found it a little too vinegary, although it was better the next day.  Next time I would add more sugar and mayo and less vinegar.

Way too much vinegar for my taste.  After sitting in the fridge for about 3 hours, it seems to be less obvious so by tomorrow it should be fine (hopefully).  I will make this recipe again but next time, cutting the vinegar in half.

I tried to use this recipe because it had less mayo in it than other recipes.  I don't like much mayo.  However, I ended up having to double the mayo to thicken the dressing up and cut the intense vinegar taste.  After that, my family liked it.  I like the taste that the apple cider vinegar gave the slaw, but I think next time I'll reduce the vinegar and increase the mayo.

Easy to make, but rather bland on color.  I added some carrot for color.  This is a good tasting sweet coleslaw, so I might cut the amount of sugar in half next time.

This is so easy and so good! I too used the splenda version of brown sugar to make it a little healthier along with fat free mayo. I only gave it four stars as I believe the amount of sugar used is way to much! I cut it down quite a bit. I also added raisins! It was soooo good though and I will definatley be making this again, thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Apple cider vinegar a winner and brown sugar for  a smoother taste. Sweet tart w/celery seed. Yay Jayme.

My family likes a little sweeter dressing on slaw so I added a tablespoon of Agave sweetner to the origanal recipe. Agave does not spike insulin so it is a healthy alternative to sugar and my family loved it. I put the whole dish of dressing on. It was really too much so today I added more cabbage voila! salad for tomorrow.

I thought this was waaaaaaaay too vinegar-y.  Next time, I'll try about half the vinegar - it would probably come out creamier (it was too soupy), too.

I wanted a change from the savory cole slaw I regularly make, so I decided to try Jayme's recipe.  Great choice!  SUPER simple and very tasty.  I used malt vinegar instead, because it's all I had on hand, and I added a bit of coarsely ground black pepper.  Delish.

First, let me say that I do not believe that there is any single "right" taste to cole slaw.   That said, for me, this cole slaw is a three. The recipe makes an average-to-good tasting cole slaw.  The taste is not bad, but nothing to write home about; not much depth, kind of thin. More vinegar taste than sweet.    Personally, I like a creamier sauce with a little more sweetness.   But, for some people, this will be the perfect cole slaw.  So, if you like a thinner sauce, that's more tart, this is perfect for you.

This was very easy to make and is a nice creamy type of cole slaw which I like. I took a suggestion from some of the other reviews and only used half of the apple cidar vinegar as I did not want it to be bitter. By doing this, the cole slaw actually turned out a little too sweet. Next time I will go exactly by what the recipe says. Definately goes well with BBQ pork.

i made this for bbq sandwiches, it didn't say anything about letting it sit, so when i first tasted it after i mixed it i didn't really care for it. but i put it in the frige for a few hours before serving and it turned out a lot better. even tasted better the next day. i did have to add more cabbage and mayo because the vinegar was a little too much for my liking. will make again, my boyfriend asked to have the bbq and slaw at the very least once a month after we get married :).  thanks jayme

Easy to make but the vinegar is way too much.  I also would reduce the brown sugar.

This is not a bad recipe but the apple cider vinegar needs to be reduced by somewhere in between a third or a half. The vinegar was just a little too overpowering.

Looking for a quick side to leftover meat loaf, so I can get back to gaming. This was perfect it only interrupted Fallout 3 for 30 minutes. I had time to toast bread and heat the meatloaf. My husband loved it.

Loved the recipe.  It's quick and easy and is even better the second day.  I tweeked it a little by cutting down on the brown sugar and increasing the vinegar and added a little more heat with a tablespoon or so of horseradish (not the beet kind).  Just makes it less sweet and more tangy.

even though i used less than a very loose 1/4 cup of splenda brown sugar blend it was too sweet in my opinion.  hubs liked it (but he loves anything i make no matter what, sweet man!) while my daughter hated it.  didn't work for me either. like the simplicity so might try it again with a bit of tweaking.

Certainly not cole slaw in my opinion, more like cabbage salad or something.  VERY unusual taste.  My 4yr old LOVED it so I will make it again because of that.  I liked it (not love) for a change of pace.  I thought it was best after sitting and soaking in the dressing for a while.

Very tasty without being heavy.  Many coleslaws drown in mayo - not this one, it's light and flavorful.  I only had white vinegar and it came out fine.

Excellent. Didn’t have apple cider vinegar so used balsamic vinegar.  Did use as much brown sugar.  Sort of just guessed at amounts of the ingredients because I was only making a small bowl.

I made this a few days ago.   Followed the recipe exactly except I used more coleslaw mix.  I had bought bagged mix and, according to the package, the bag contained 6-3/4 c. mix.  The recipe only calls for 4 c.  which I think is not enough.  I added the entire bag and mixed thoroughly.  The dressing is soupy so ended up as a puddle in the bottom of the bowl.  The dressing is also too tart for my tastes.  

About half the coleslaw is now gone so I added another bag to the bowl since there is still so much dressing in the bottom of the container.  Once this is all gone, I won't be making this recipe again.  Although it's very easy to make, it would take too much tweaking to satisfy my taste.  There are plenty of other recipes out there.

Tastes traditional, but with a little tang from the vinegar. Very tasty!  Will be my go-to now, especially with grilled seafood.

I used pre-cut broccoli slaw (2 bags) and this came out great.  I also added about 1/4 cup sour cream to make this a little more creamy.  Ate on top of pulled pork sandwiches, YUM

I needed to make cole slaw with ingredients that I had at home so I went with this one.  I did cut down on the sugar and vinegar then used reduced fat mayo.  Also, threw in some shaved carrots.  Still a little "vinegary" tasting but really liked it.  Next time, will add just a little less vinegar and think it will be perfect.  I'll keep at it.  Served it over Kalua pork.

I have made this several times and it is always a big hit.  You can modify easily to satisfy the palate for more tart tastes or sweeter.  I reduce the vinegar to 1/4 cup as well as the brown sugar and leave the mayo as is.  One hint:  Don't use lite mayo.  It is OK, but with real Hellman's, it's the real deal!  Every bit as good as your favorite in a restaurant.  We love it on a sandwich with pulled/BBQ pork.

I was out of white vinegar so I came on AR to find a recipe with Apple Cider Vinegar.  This recipe was so close to the way I make it, I thought it'd be perfect.  I use white vinegar and white sugar, minus the celery seed.  Maybe I'm too used to my family recipe. This was just ok.  Way to "wet" for our tastes.
