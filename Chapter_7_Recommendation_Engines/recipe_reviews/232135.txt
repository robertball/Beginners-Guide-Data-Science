Very good way to fix scallops.  Do all the prep first because cooking needs attention.  Served with steamed broccoli with Raspberry Enlightenment, and sauvignon blanc.

I was skeptical about this dish as I was making it because I didn't think the  scallop mixture would have enough flavor to enhance the couscous, but I was wrong. It was very tasty. The parsley garnish is a must as this dish is visually bland, but not bland in the mouth!

The scallops came out like a normal scampi, but there wasn't enough sauce to give the couscous flavor throughout.
