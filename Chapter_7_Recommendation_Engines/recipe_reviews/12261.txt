Wonderful and so easy to make. I used fresh pineapple instead of canned and added an extra Tbs. of tapioca.  Was not watery at all.  I would recommend letting it sit for at least 1/2 day so the juices don't flow when you cut it.  It needs to sit for a while.  WOW!!! No wonder I love mango dishes!!  Stored this recipe in my mailbox and will definitely make it again.

More mango than pineapple, kind of a funny name...but very good!  Tropical.  My dad said it tasted a lot like a peach pie.  I used pineapple tidbits & just tossed them in with a bit of the juice, did not mash or anything.  The mangos were very ripe & sweet.  Orange juice instead of apple juice.  Baked up nice, I let it cool overnight & it was completely set (a little hard to cut, actually).  Might use less sugar or skip the brown sugar in future - tons of caramel sticky guck bubbled over onto the tray.

outstanding!! i've made it twice now in just a week, and my family just loves it.

i did substitute coconut rum for the apple juice (it seemed like such a nice, tropical thing to do) and i may cut back on the sugar next time i make it--the mangoes i have been getting are exceptionally sweet. 

thanks for the addition to my repetoire.

If you love these 2 kinds of fruit, you will be obsessed with this pie! It was phenomenal! I used a different kind of juice (orange-mango-peach juice) and a bit less than half the amount of white sugar. Otherwise, I did follow the filling ingredients. I made the pie crust from scratch though. Makes a huge difference. Pie crust is rather easy to make, so do it :)

I just made this with my husband and it is delicious, but I think it is a bit too sweet with all the sugar and I love sweet anything.  The mangoes and pineapples are already sweet and definitely don't need all the added sugar. Yummy!

Definitely let the fruit determine how much of the sugar you add. Made this twice, using fresh pineapple both times.  The first time, the pineapple was a little green.  We used the whole quantity of sugar and it was just right.  The second time I bought the presliced pineapple n the clamshell package from Costco. It was pretty sweet so I left out 1/4 cup of sugar.  I could’ve left out 1/2 cup or maybe more.  I can’t imagine canned pineapple would need the whole cup and a quarter.  Other than that this is a good recipe. I use one of the hot water pie crust recipes from this site and the pie turned out great. Will make again.
