These are very tasty. I do agree that they were a bit too chocolatey, and I do loooove chocolate, but I just added a tablespoon more of peanut butter, and voila! Perfection. They are very good for what they are, a no-bake cookie. I was looking for something quick and easy to satisfy my sweet tooth and these were perfect. Thank you for this recipe. Oh and by the way, it does say in the recipe to refrigerate them. Thanks!

They're good, but a little too chocolatey. They are also somewhat hard to eat, because they don't stick together too well, and really should be kept in the refrigerator.

these are okay.  No bake cookies are not a favorite of mine at all, but I figured bf would like them (he really likes no bakes).  He said he liked them, but then said they were okay, not the best thing he's said about no bake cookies.  So I guess these aren't really his favorite.  They are certainly easy enough, and they used up some of that cereal we've got everywhere, but I guess I'll try another recipe next time.  Thanks for the recipe!
