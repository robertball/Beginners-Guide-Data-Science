I like the recipe but be careful because they cook really fast. I made some blueberry and cherry syrup to put on top. Yummy!!! You don't have to eat this for breakfast; it makes a good substitute for cornbread.

They turned out just great: not overly sweet. A bit of organic maple syrup on top perfected them. But really were good plain too. I had bought some amaranth just bc I hadn't cooked with it before. Used chestnut flour instead of sorghum flour bc had the former and not the latter. Other than that I made as directed. And they hit the spot ! Satisfied my pancake craving!
