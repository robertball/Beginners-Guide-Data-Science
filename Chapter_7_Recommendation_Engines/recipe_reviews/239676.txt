Made this as written and found it pretty bland.  I'd rate it about 3.5 stars.  It definitely needs something added to spice it up because the soup is not very flavorful.  If I make it again, I will probably add some taco seasoning, or similar.  Gave it 4 stars for convenience.

I could not find the exact Campbells soup as per the recipe. But did find a Pres. Choice brand which had the beans, chicken bits, jalepeno. No cumin or cilantro, so I added some to the soup. The rest I followed exactly. It was good but did not really taste much like Mexican food to me. Plus I really must learn how to wrap up the food in the wrap without it all falling out the bottom. My first time & much leaking out. Yikes.

These were very good. It is a quick and nutritious dinner. I knew the mix was going to be bland, since the soup I was using (Kirkland's Southwestern Black Bean Soup) always needs extra seasoning, so I added about 1/2 tsp of seasoned salt. I also added some Mexican cheese blend before rolling up the burritos. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Great flavor! The chicken needs to be cut into chunks or shredded instead of strips.
