I just really didn't care for this smoothie. The whey powder is over-whelming and the apple skins did not seem to dissolve. I tried to fix it, but couldn't cut through the protein powder taste. To the credit of the submitter, I find this issue in all smoothies with these powders and usually do not use them. Why the skins did not dissolve, I do not know. Never had that issue in my Vitamix. The smoothie was also a luke warm despite the ice cube. I have made numerous smoothies, in my blender, but it appears others enjoyed this!

I haven't seen a smoothie recipe quite like this one before. It turns out to be a great apple based smoothie which is refreshing. There is a nice mix of flavors between the apple, vanilla, and banana. I would make this again!

What a great idea!!! I have never thought to make a smoothie with apples. I was afraid of the apple being overpowering so instead I used 2 bananas and 1 apple and I didn't measure the milk or OJ. My daughter and I love it! I would have never tried apple if I didn't see your recipe. Thanks a lot  =)

I followed the recipe exactly. This had a fresh, good taste and was different since it called for apples. Because I prefer really ice cold smoothies, I added ice to the glass as I drank it.  I enjoyed it for a change.
