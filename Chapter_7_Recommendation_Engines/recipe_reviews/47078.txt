This is my favorite way to eat tomatoes!  Light and fresh, the good tomatoe taste comes through. Use good Balsamic.  I sometimes top with crumbled feta or blue cheese and black olives, use fresh basil confetti for added color and flavor.  Perfection!

I made this for a potluck and it was a hit!  After marinating over night, the vinegar and onions were no longer overpowering and became almost sweet.  It was super easy and I'll definately make it again!

Growing up in our lttle Italian getto in Chicago we ate an identical "salad" almost everyday.. all summer long. It was GREAT! Passed down from my Great Grandmother (who added a leaf or two of fresh mint to hers) it's also very healthy. She and my GGrandDad came here from Sicily, married, as teens quite early in the last century. I was lucky enough to know GGrandDad (who lived to be 98) as a kid and learned a lot. (How to ID edible fungi and other edible "weeds" for example). But the best, and most outstanding memory from their home was the smell, and taste - OF THE FOOD!!!
(funny how certain foods invoke such strong memories)

I've been making my own variation of this all week with all fresh veggies from my garden. Added small cukes, green pepper, yellow tomato, red onion chopped. Didn't use as much olive oil or Balsamic as called for since we don't like the veggies swimming. Added just enough to cover and also added a little honey to take the bite out. Delicious...DH had 3 helpings!

This recipe turned out great!  I didn't have the shallots, so I just left them out and made it with the tomatoes.  I also added a little chopped fresh basil to the mix.  My husband loved it and even took the leftovers to work the next day to let his 2 coworkers try them.  They loved it as well!

This really is a nice side dish or appetizer!  Two days later, I was making grilled turkey with cheese sandwiches and put the marinated tomatoes with shallots on the sandwiches including a touch of mayo and the sandwiches were awesome!  They add a special taste to the sandwich.  My husband loved it!

Perfect side dish instead of a salad.  I also had two warm multigrain baguettes that we enjoyed dipping in the dressing.  Yum!  I also added fresh garden cucumber slices around the serving tray and it just added to the presentation and tastiness.

I recently made this, and it was wonderful.  I followed the directions to the T, and the only thing that I added, was a little organic brown sugar to the oil and vinegar.  Everyone loved it, and had to make more, just remember to allow time for marinade flavors to blend before serving.

really good but you can definately cut back the # of shallots.  I love 'em and it was still a bit strong.  Maybe 3 or 4 would be better depending on the size.  I also recommend chilling the dish at least an hour before serving-it lets the shallots mellow and the oil mix in.  I also added some Italian spices, which was a nice addition.

This is delicious, and one of my summertime favorites! Since I'm watching my weight I alter this recipe a bit by adding layers  thinly sliced mozzarella cheese for protein, then top with sliced black olives and fresh basil, finely minced. I also cut back quite a bit on the olive oil, or omit it entirely, and used multigrain or whole wheat bread.  This makes it a meal instead of a side dish. Oh, and I don't refrigerate the tomatoes - ever - it changes both the taste and the consistency!

Yes, yes, yes.  This recipe is simple yet divine.  I made it for a party and I seriously had my guests begging for more.  

Freshly picked tomatoes are the only way to go, which is what I think made this such a knock-out dish.  Layer french bread, tomato slice and a fresh basil leaf on top.  Happiness.

Update:  made this again--and had 3 people ask for the recipe!  My version--I doubled the recipe: for 10 tomatoes I only used 4 shallots, added about a 1/2 to 1 TBSP brown sugar and salt to taste.  Also I sprinkled about a tsp of salt-free pizza seasoning in the mixture.  Perfection!

My 15 year old son LOVED this.  I thought it was awesome.  Be careful not to put too much dressing on the tomatoes...it can be a bit overwhelming.

Delicious!  I used more vinegar than oil, blended in a small herb food processor with fresh basil, omitted the shallot (daughter hates onions) and sprinkled it all with a bit of feta cheese and chives to finish it off.  Looked as yummy as it tasted.

I Love this recipe.  It's simple, delicious, and a perfect companion to so many dinners.  If you like to dip your bread in Balsalmic and olive oil, you'll love this side dish.  Next time I think I'll add some cucumbers in the mix. I like it with feta or parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.  Great dish and even better when you're short on time to make an entire salad.

Nice! I used red onion and a pinch of garlic powder because I didn't have shallot. We had this as a salad with french baguette (the bread is a must for dipping!). Thanks!

Not for me - I didn't like the vinegar taste.  Way too many shallots.  I'm still giving it a 4 though, because my boyfriend (who loved the vinegar taste) loved it.  But we both agreed there were too many shallots.

This was an EXCELLENT recipe! I added some freshly ground pepper to the tomatoes and a teaspoon of sugar. I only added the sugar because I didn't print the recipe and couldn't remember if it had called for any or not. This was superb though and I'll definitely be making this again and again. Next time I'm going to try adding cucumbers and see how that works. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Great change up for home grown tomatoes instead of just salt & pepper!  I didn't have balsamic vinegar so had to use apple cidar. sprinkled with s&p. I used a suggestion from someone else and crumbled blue cheese on the tomatoes. marinated for 15 minutes and continued to "flip" the container. it was excellent!!  after dinner, I added more tomatoes and blue cheese to the container for tomorrow and put in the frig! can't wait to have more.  Thanks Scarlett!

This was OK--not bad at all, but nothing spectacular. I didn't really care for the texture of that much shallot, and I think it could use some fresh herbs (basil, oregano, maybe some thyme). With that much olive oil, I think it would be better served over greens.

Excellent!  I love these Greek style tomatoes!  They work great as a side to a chicken dish.

This was great with our local farmer's market tomatoes... it was even better then next day on top of some fresh spinach. Thanks for the great recipe! Light, flavorful and delish!

Light and fresh and oh so easy sidedish.  Great use of summer tomatoes.  I sprinkled with lowfat feta cheese.

Its a winner. I go a little farther. I combine chopped cucumbers along with chopped green peppers and chopped sweet onions in any combination along with the olive oil and Balsamic dressing and tomatoes.
