I like this recipe. I have made baked wings in a couple different ways but with all of them I do this first.  I steam the wings in a large double pot for 10 minutes dry with paper towels refrigerate for 1 hour. Then pull out your wings and prepare them per the recipe.  I like cookie sheets with parchment paper. Your wings will have much less fat and remain very juicy. great tip I got from a competitive BBQ expert.

For those skeptical of a coating that doesn't include bread or corn flake crumbs, believe me; this recipe was delicious with  Parmesan cheese as the main ingredient. The only change I made was not adding salt because the cheese was salty enough. The wings were tender and delicious.

Im surprised this recipe does not have more reviews... these are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and my wings were crispy outside, juicy inside, and flavored perfectly.  Seriously, if you are looking to make some addictive and crave-worthy wings, look no further- the recipe is right here!

1)Four lbs is a lot of wings! The amount of butter and cheese/herb mixture in this recipe only did about half so I had to melt more butter and make more dredging mix. Even then I barely had enough for all the wings. 2) I baked the wings on foil sprayed with Pam. Some still stuck and none were truly crispy. 3) I didn't add any additional salt and glad I didn't. The Parmesan cheese made these very salty.

I used half melted (unsalted) butter, and half olive oil.  As far as flavor, this recipe deserves five stars.  I gave four, because as another reviewer experienced, I also ran out of coating half way through preparation.  I do recommend using fresh grated Parmesan.  I’m a huge fan.  The flavor is far and above Kraft brand.  Once you buy fresh Parmesan, you’ll be spoiled.

I occasionally take a chance on a recipe that doesn't have a lot of reviews and I must say, THIS recipe was worth the risk!  The chicken came out juicy and flavorful.  I didn't have Parmesan on hand so I omitted and it was still fabulous.  I HIGHLY recommend trying this recipe.  It was DELICIOUS!!

Used about two pounds of wings and the full amount in the recipe of the “breading” and had just enough. Cooked for 45 minutes and they were perfect. Will definitely make again

We  eat a lot of wings and I mean a LO T of wings. I've tried dozens of recipes and different cooking methods but always go back to frying them and then coating them in various sauces. Baked just never seem to do as good for me. They usually get all watered down leaving whatever you coated them in a big puddle under your wing. Not these. These were perfect and crispy around the entire wing! My husband and I were both very much impressed. The only change I would recommend making is to leave out the salt. They were a bit too salty. Be sure to use unsalted butter as well,

These wings are requested on a weekly basis. My family swears these are the best wings ever, and I agree. So crispy and so much flavor. The pools of melted coating under each wing is the absolute best. Awesome!

Pretty tasty, but salty. Next time I won't add any salt and will use unsalted butter.  I'll also be less generous with the coating as I ran out half way through my chicken.

The whole family really loved them. I chose the recipe because my kids won't eat anything spicy. I bought 3.8lbs of chicken wings and I had to make a second batch of the breading because the original amount wasn't nearly enough. Other than that, they turned out great and I will definitely be making these wings again.

Excellent baked chicken, baked 20 minutes both sides at 375 and broiled for 7 minutes each side. Nice and crispy and to assure that I obtained that crispy texture all this was done on a rack while cooking. Awesome quick and easy wings .... thank you!

I wanted to give this five stars because the taste was really good, but I did have to get past the saltiness first. I am not sure if it was too salty because the coating was too heavy. I did have to make a second batch of coating to finish the wings. I will omit the salt the next time and coat lighter.

Only change I made was to add 2 tsp. Chili Powder instead of paprika. Also baked wings on a slotted broiler pan so juices drained through to bottom pan.

I added red pepper flakes to the coating for a little heat. I liked these, but next time will try with a better quality parmesean. I used the cheapo shake cannister kind, probably not the best idea.

I followed the recipe exactly. These are very delicious. Cooking them as long as directed makes the meat fall right off the bone. The skin is crispy. They were such a hit I have had requests to make them at other functions. No need to change a thing.

I haven't made this yet, but most of the complaints were with adding salt.  All the recipes on this site that mentions to add salt, DON'T!   I add in garlic salt, paprika, or some spicy sauce that is loaded with salt to begin with!   So do not add salt, just add your favourite flavours.  Sometimes I'll grate some garlic cloves, and add that instead of salt.

I love these wings!  I make 1-1/2 times the Parmesan and seasoning to make sure they are all well coated.  I bake them at 375 for 50 minutes, turning after 20 minutes and 40 minutes.  They come out perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy inside!  I make a meal of them with a salad and have the perfect low carb dinner!

I was looking for a low carb appetizer to take to friends and I ran across this recipe. It was easy and everyone loved the wings. I left out the salt like some recommended but next time I think I’ll add it. We like some saltiness on our wings.

Just made these! Tasted great, and they did turn out with a crispy coating. I only made two pounds of wings, and the  4oz butter was "just enough", but I had leftover parmesan-spice leftover. They did stick to the foil, even after lightly spraying the foil. I'll try using parchment paper, or a silpat liner next time. I'm keto, so this is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

First of all I used smallish boneless skinless thighs. Also I dusted the damp raw chicken in a seasoned flour before dipping in the butter mixture. I think it held the flavorings better this way.  You could omit most of the salt- especially if you use parm/Romano blend like I did. I also used white pepper instead of black. I used 375deg for 35 minutes in a Pyrex dish. My picky sweetheart licked his plate! That’s a win.

Definitely make them again. Used about 1.5 kg of wings and double the dry coating. Made them to have cold at the horse racing. Delicious cold and hot!

These were really delicious, only thing is I’d double or even triple the cheese mixture, I only made about 2 and a half pounds of wings and I still didn’t have enough to coat all the wings.

These were just ok. Followed the instructions exactly. They looked great but the Parmesan cheese was a little too strong for my taste. Maybe great for a gathering but I wouldn’t make them for myself again.

I have to be honest of course. I just did not get the CRISP that I was looking for. It’s difficult to achieve a CRISP wing recipe in the oven. I will stay with the frying method for this desired taste, hence the reason for only four stars.

Everyone raved about them and said the best wings that they have had...and we eat wings on many occasions. 
Trying different  ones at times.
The only thing is you have to double the receipe or you'll have half the wings left.

I have made this 3 times but with small legs. The first time I just placed on the foil and with the fat in the legs it was soggy. The next two times I placed pieces on a rack and then on  a baking sheet. Nice and crispy. These make a great take a long for  a pot luck or a happy hour. Never any left. Slight changes. I added an extra garlic clove and one extra teaspoon of a smokier paprika

This recipe gave the wings really good taste, however, there is no way those wings come out crispy at that temp and time.  Skin still had the "raw" like texture.  I have tried to cook crispy wings in several ovens at that temp and absolutely NO way do they come up crispy. To make them crispy you either have to turn up the heat to 500 and cook for an hour or keep the same temp and cook for 4 hours. If there is one thing I hate is messy wings and this recipe makes that happen.

I wanted crispy wings and these has such good reviews. Everyone said they followed the recipe exactly, so I did just that (with the exception of substituting basil for parsley because I didn’t have any) and while they were delicious and flavorful they were not crispy. Maybe next time I’d broil for 3 minutes at the end? I didn’t want to overcook the chicken but there was so much juice. Other suggestions?

Okay...you think chicken wings...what can I do to make them differently...well use this recipe. Seriously I checked out several before deciding on this particular one.  I wouldn’t change any of the ingredients, just found for the winglets I was using I needed more of the parm cheese dry ingredients. Also, my oven only required 45 minutes on 350. There is no need for a dipping sauce as these are so flavorful. Soooo good...this will now become a regular party app!

Delicious recipe! Cooked perfectly and crispy and tasty.

Agree with other posters to at least double the recipe of coatings. I made full batch of butter/garlic and cheese/herb coating for half as many wings (2lb). I just barely had enough butter/garlic coating and had to make more of the cheese herb coating.  Also keep in mind 2lb of wings was about 20 wings so 4lb is like 40+ wings.

These turned out really juicy on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside. The only thing I did differently was used parchment paper instead of aluminum foil.

Made them tonight. Read many reviews. Cut the salt in half and shredded my own Parmesan which I feel works best when trying to coat Protein. The cheese and spice mixture stuck to the Chicken so well. I may have added an additional clove of Garlic.  They were delicious! Who knew you could get that kind of crisp and flavor with baked Wings. Delicious!

This recipe is good as is, but I agree that the butter mixture is not enough for the amount of wings. I made the recipe for four people, and I had to add more butter and a bit more  of Parmesan. The outcome was very good, but beware they can easily burn and give out a lot of smoke from the Parmesan and butter greases. My recommendation would be to lower the temperature and bake them covered on aluminum foil for about 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil for the last few minutes of baking to brown them. They will brown believe me! I have made several recipes with baked wings and they come out perfect. I agree that you might not need salt because the Parmesan's salt is just enough. This one is no exception. Might make it again with my "tweakings" if they can be called so.

Followed the advice of others:  cut  recipe to about 2 pounds of wings  and then cheese mixture covers nicely;  45 minutes in oven;  could cut some/all salt ( we like it extra salty so I made it like the original recipe).  One of our favorite wing recipes.

I made this tonight and my family absolutely loved it. I complimented it with Mild Hooters Sauce and it was to die for. The chicken was crispy, tender, and juicy. I would drizzle the garlic butter very lightly or it will have a greasy texture upon coming out of the oven. I did have to add more of the dry ingredients as the original amount wasn’t enough. All in all, good job with this recipe and it will become my go-to!

The only thing different I would do is put the wings on a grate on a baking pan. They brown great

This was delicious.  My wife and I love it!  The only this I will do differently next time is I will delete the salt because the Parmesan cheese is so salty to begin with that I should have known better and not used it.  But for a great non-diet meal, this was so good.  Will be making it again.

As others say, this recipe only does about 2 pounds of wings.  I like it but I'll take someone's suggestion for the fresh grated parm next time.   Maybe more garlic since I can't get enough.

I made it exactly as detailed for a birthday party. They turned out crispy, fall off the bone tender and I got nothing but rave reviews all night. We’ve made them several times since and I’ve passed the recipe out to others.  This is a keeper recipe for us!

I've never made chicken wings before, but felt inspired to try making THIS recipe because the reviews were so fantastic and it looked super easy.    My husband LOVES chicken wings and he couldn't get enough of them!   He raved about these wings!  He wants me to make them again and add about a TBS of Franks hot sauce to the mix.  He likes a little spice.   I thought they were fantastic as is.  Great recipe!!!

first time making oven baked wings, and this was a really easy quick recipe, love how crispy they got. cooked for 45 minutes and they were well done. Would maybe change up the seasoning to add a bit more flavour. However I skipped the salt as recommended by others and found it really did need it plus I only had kraft parmesan (perhaps fresh grated would have been more flavourful) Otherwise this is a great base recipe to start with. Will defiantly be making these again.

I just made this wonderful dish tonight and let me tell you!! Its the best baked chicken I've cooked so far! I just added more ingredients  to it because it wasn't enough.  I added homemade sauce I also Broiled the last ten mins of cooking to have that honey glaze on top as you pull it off. I served with mac-n- cheese and corn. It was awesome!! Thank-you for this recipe. Much respect for your intelligence and sharing with the community.  I give it a Ten Star Rating , honestly!
                                                      Thank-you,

Very tasty.  The second time I made them I used garlic granules in place of diced. They stick to the wings better.  And I tossed a tsp of them into the cheese mixture. Never too much garlic!

Greasy, drippy mess.waste of butter and cheese. Had to make more coating and butter.  Did not come out crispy and coating came off.  I will try once more without the cheese and also dry off the wings and bring them to room temp first. Probable reason for fail

I had a package of drum sticks and not wings but the recipe worked great and everyone liked them. Four stars instead of five because the spices were kind of bland. Next time I will add some zip. I used a brush to brush the garlic butter all over the chicken drummies and then patted the cheese spice mix all over the chicken. It stuck beautifully. Ready in one hour moist and tender. Thanks for this recipe!

These were really good, everyone loved them. Just be sure to make more coating then called for because mine took extra. So some were without a coating and I have to say they were bland compared with this recipe.

I brined them overnight. I sprinkled the mix over them, which was enough to cover them. Shouldn't have added salt to the mix, as the brine was enough. Still good though.

They turned out very good, I will definitely make them again. I steamed the wings for 10 minutes as suggested by another reviewer and then refrigerated them for a couple hours before baking, they came out crispy and delicious.   The only other change/suggestion, as other reviewers mentioned they were salty I used unsalted butter and half of the salt the recipe calls for and they were perfect, not too salty.  My wife usually puts buffalo wing sauce on wings, she didn't even use sauce at all.  The only reason I'll give this 4 stars and not 5 is that as others have mentioned, I ran out of dry ingredients and had to scramble to quickly make more.  I did 2lbs of wings and I'd double or triple the dry ingredients next time around.

Great flavors. Not as crisp as expected but we will do this again. The previous comments are spot on. Parmesan is only enough to cover 2 lbs. wings and the recipe is a bit salty. I had wings that were neither injected nor brined but I used the recipe as presented, which is an sop for me. Will reduce salt  next time which will be quite soon

Really good. I made from froZen so had to cook a bit longer.  Like 60 min total. Flipped at 40 and 50 min. Put on a rack above pan and wish I had let them sit in the butter but they were delish!

Agree with others, the flavor is outstanding and they are juicy inside and crispy outside. I did cook a little longer to make sure crispy.  Very happy, will make again!!!

I've found my chicken wing recipe at last! These were delicious and easy to make. I would double or at least half again the butter/garlic mix and the spice mix (with the exception of the salt) because I came up a short. The wings were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I would definitely serve these to guests.

I love crispy chicken but it takes so long to fry. This recipe is easy to follow, delicious, crispy. I would rename this recipe Simple and Delicious Chicken. I will definitely be making it again.

Very delicious.  Thankfully I read previous reviews and doubled the amount of coating and used 1 1/2 sticks of butter for exactly 4 pounds of wings and only 1/2 the salt.  I also par boiled them  to render some of the fat then chilled them in the refrigerator for 2 hours, which also helped dry the skin out.  Separating the wings into the two parts and then proceeding according to the recipe yielded great results.  Next time I would use the full amount of salt and maybe add a little cayenne to spice them up.  Terrific alternative for people on low carb diets.

I followed this recipe exactly and my husband and I REALLY enjoyed them! They are as crispy as anyone could want. We tossed them with Chef John’s buffalo sauce and the whole dish was awesome. Better than restaurant wings without a doubt.

Just a general comment on the saltiness of the wings .
Use salt-less butter and do not use a low grade parmesan cheese ,the cheaper the cheese the saltier the coating will be.

The receipe does not mention covering the wings with anything to keep the moisture in, not even al foil. The wings @ 350 for 60 minutes do not turn out very well as they should with a moisture preserving cover.

Made it. I. had just 1lb of wings and there wasn't enough to cover 1lbl of wings.   I used my own ability to save the day and they turned out great. I poured off the fat and kept baking.  Recipe need re inventing.

Wow! These wings were delicious! I'm eating low-carb these days and the wings more than satisfied my craving for something "breaded".  Agree on omitting the salt per other cooks as the Parmesan provides all the salt you'll need to season the dish. They were buttery, crispy, and divine. Thanks for this lovely recipe, MARKANDANGIE! (Oh, and I'm having the leftovers for lunch today, at room temp :-)

Definitely making them again.

They  had a little too much oregano for my taste.  They were also quite greasy.  Maybe if they were baked on a rack they would be better, so they weren't sitting in the fat.  I did like the low carb breading though.

I wanted to make these yesterday, but didn't have all of the ingredients for the spice mixture.  So, I opted to add a few extra cloves of garlic and then sprinkled Old Bay on the wings and baked them.  Flipped the wings after about 40 minutes and added Old Bay to the other side and continued to cook.  They were a hit!!

Made this recipe for the Super Bowl.  Did not add the tsp of salt and I thought the Parmesan cheese added the perfect amount of saltiness.  Will definitely make again!  Yum!

I made these exactly as listed, but did turn them over 1/2 way thru cooking.  We loved them and will be making again!

Delish! I have been trying to find the perfect crispy baked wing recipe for ages and this is it! I think the secret is in the baking time, the hour allows the coating to crisp up perfectly. I followed the recipe, made no alterations and they were perfect!
