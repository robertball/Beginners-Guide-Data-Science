These were good but I think the mint flavor was a little overpowering. I’d like to taste a little more of the coffee so next time I’ll try cutting the mint to half. Also, I mixed it up in a blender with ice to make it a bit more frothy. Pretty good!

Very good. Like an Andes mint, only stronger. I shook this up well in my cocktail shaker with some ice before shooting it down. Made it even frostier.

I made a special trip to liquor store for the crème de menthe for this recipe.  I hope I can find another recipe to use the liquor as this one just was not for me.  Made as is, and couldn't drink it, so I poured it over ice and added some half and half and a bit of regular milk.  It was better, so I gave it to my husband.  He said he got it down, but wasn't interested in having it again.  Interesting that the photo of the drink on allrecipes has no green color.  My crème de menthe made the whole drink green.
