I used chicken broth instead of granules as that is what I had on hand.  As for the soy sauce, it is a MUST, just much less of it.  I only used about 2 teaspoons as we are watching our sodium, but this dish would be very bland without it.  I also added garlic.  You can really change this up any way you like, a splash of white wine will really add depth!

A nice tasty side dish. I used brown rice, and used the tip a reviewer gave of soaking it first. It came out soft and plump - I'm going to use this tip all the the time.

I completely forgot to include the soy sauce and this was still delicious.  Quiet and understated flavors, yet still with lots of character because of the herbs.  I used the dried minced onion but used chicken broth rather than water and chicken bouillon granules, and fresh herbs rather than dried - basil, thyme and parsley.  Fresh, clean flavors and not overpoweringly so.

Wow! This is really good ya'll! So long I have searched for a great rice dish. My family and I adore this. I threw in an extra dash of each spice. It is still pretty mild,and I will probably play with it a bit over time, but we sure did enjoy this! Thank you for a recipe I will use over and over again.

Very nice flavor.  Much better than any box mix rice.  Added everything (except soy)to rice cooker and turned out great.  Will definitely make again.

I used chicken broth instead of water and ommitted the soy sauce.  Also, I used brown rice instead of white.  It came out great, just slightly undercooked.  I think next time I will either add more liquid or cook a bit longer at a lower temperature.  The water seemed to cook off before the rice was fully cooked.  Seasoning was perfect.

This came out soooo good!  It will definitely be used over and over!  Being from the south, I increased the amount of herbs.  I used a full teaspoon for the basil, marjoram and thyme.  Other than that I made no changes.  It was great!  Can't wait to eat it again!

I had such high hopes for this recipe!  My family loves flavored rice, but no one liked this dish, not even my 4 year old who will eat more rice than anyone else at the table.  It really seemed like the soy sauce interferred with the spices, they didn't go together.  I ended up throwing it all out.

I rated it 5 stars few days ago, but I have to came back to say that my picky eater 10 years old son, claimed for this rice each day!!I'm so thrilled that he loves it!!
Don't have dried minced onion so i put more onion powder instead. 
I'm also adding a bit of oregano, salad herbs, salt and pepper.

Loved the taste of this rice. I only changed two things. In place of the water & granules, I used 1.5 cups chicken broth for my 1 cup jasmine rice per the ratio instructed on the rice package. I also reduced the soy sauce to 1T.  The herbs are a perfect mix & the soy sauce adds a nice flavor, so don't leave it out. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! :)

I made this along with some almond crusted talapia, and it was not good. I thought is was the talapia that was killing the flavor, but no way. I love rice and this was not good. Has to dispose of it. Don't know what went wrong.

I made this exactly as written.  I found the soy sauce to be overpowering.  It gave the rice a more "beefy" taste even though chicken base was used in it.  I might give this recipe another shot using only 1/2 tbs of Low Sodium Soy Sauce.  I agree with others the dish might be bland without it; but, for us the called for amount was too much.

I didn't change anything about this recipe. The rice is flavorful without being overpowering. I would suggest that if anyone would like to taste more of the herbs to add extra. The soy sauce can be overpowering but, my husband and I loved it as is. We also used low sodium soy sauce as a healthier alternative. I served this with fish and vegetables and it was perfect. I will definately be making this again.

Came out delish, I didn't use the soy sauce and added some curry powder (I like to put a little curry powder in most of my dishes). Great way to change up the standard rice side dish w/ a meal!

This is a flavorful, basic side that we all liked. I had Jasmine rice and it was not mushy at all. I was hesitant will all the herbs, and you really could not single anything out other than soy sauce.

Thiis is a lovely background for a more highly flavoured main course. The only change I made was to cook the rice in organic vegetable stock and leave out the chicken bouillon powder. Any herbs that complement your main course could be used. Thanks for a great side dish!

I made this with Cousin Cosmo's Greek Chicken and a salad.  I would make it again, but I didn't think it was anything phenomenal.  It has a subtle nice flavor to it, and it would complement a really flavorful meat dish nicely because this rice is a nice step up and change from regular rice, but it still lets the main dish be the star of the dinner.  I had a hard time getting my rice to cook to the point of not being crunchy.  I had to add in probably about an extra cup of water while it was cooking.  Other than that, I omitted the chopped onion and I used oregano in place of marjoram (don't keep that on hand, and wasn't going to buy it for just 1/4 of a t.) Once it was done cooking I added some salt and pepper to taste.

I thought it was okay. I used brown rice this time. I might give it a second chance using white rice to see if it is any better.

This is the only way I cook rice now.  It is so incredibly simple and very delicious!  The only change I make is that I leave out the marjoram (I don't have any) and I follow the cooking directions on the rice I am using at the time (as far as rice to water ratio and cooking time).  I cook this at least once a week, usually more often.

This was GREAT and so simple.  I had to make some changes to accomadate what I had on hand.  I used Olive Oil instead of butter. I omitted the soy sauce and the dried minced onion (I added a little bit more onion powder).  I used Oregano in place of the marjoram and poultry seasoning in place of the thyme and I added 1/2 tsp of granulated garlic.  My three year old ate it all and said it was great!  This will be a keeper!

Pretty good, but I don't think I'd make it again. It tasted a little too much like boxed stuffing.

I made this with my own homemade chicken broth and I omitted the soy sauce so it would compliment the Apple Kielbasa Coins I made to go with it. Other than that, I kept it the same.

Very good. There were no leftovers.

This was pretty good. Next time I try it, I'm going to cut back on the soy sauce just a bit. I didn't have reduced sodium, so I used regular. It was a bit on the salty side. Not bad though!

We liked this.  It's nice and simple and has good flavor.  I didn't have boullion cubes, so I just used a can of chicken broth.  Beef broth would be good too.

What a simple quick way to fancy up plain rice. My family really liked this. "ummm" they said with surprise upon tasting. I did add a little more chicken bouillon. I will use this recipe many times. Thanks!

I really like this mix.  I made up a batch of the seasoning mix and stored it in a little container.  Now it's premixed for me whenever I want to make this again.

It was bland. I even used chicken broth instead of water and doubled the basil and thyme. I added peas for color and flavor. I would have been better making Rice-A-Roni box.

I too used my rice cooker.  All ingredients went in & it turned out great!  I did omit the dried onions as I'm not a fan of those - heartburn.  Overall, good recipe and my husband really enjoyed it too.

My 7 year old said, "This is the best rice I've ever had!"  I used liquid bouillon concentrate and decreased the water a bit, threw it all in my microwave rice cooker, stirred, and cooked the same way I cook plain white rice.  It came out PERFECT.  I was out of marjoram so I left that out.

This is a regular side dish in my home now.  I've added it to the refigerator for quick reference.  Whenever my son visits he wants this rice.  Very nice, interesting combination of flavors.  For those who don't want the flavored boxed rice variety.

This was ok.  I often make herb rice with butter, a generous helping of Mrs. Dash, some turmeric, and salt and pepper.  I tried this as an alternative.  I have to say I do NOT understand the people who called this rice strong.  I had only 1 T. left of regular soy sauce, but since it wasn't the "lower sodium" called for, I can't imagine that that alone caused the bland flavor.  I put this all in my rice cooker and added frozen broccoli, cauliflower, and peas.  Perhaps the water of the veggies made this more bland?  Either way, I had to spice it up with my usual Mrs. Dash, a generous sprinkling of salt, and some pepper.  After that, we all gobbled it down for a quick and easy lunch.  I'll go back to my own "pinch of this and that" rice from now on though.

Full flavored rice! We used 2/3 of a chicken bullion cube and white rice. Will try brown rice next time because I like to switch up our rice recipes between the two.

This dish turned out great, the whole family loved it including my fussy 5 yr. old.  Followed the recipe with exception of marjoram (didn't have any) and mixed everything together in the rice cooker.  This will become a new staple for us!

The only reason I would give this recipe a four is cause my rice would not cook so next time I will try with a different rice. But flavour was nice and my daughter loved it! I allso added fresh minced garlic.

This was a great side dish for our pork chops tonight.  I will definitely be making this again.  I used fresh onion instead of dried because I don't have any and accidentally added garlic powder but how could that be wrong?  In the future I will be making it with brown rice.

This was alright but it wasn't impressive. I'd eat it again, but there are a lot of other rice dishes I'd prefer. The herbs were strong and it isn't a mild side dish. This was simple and not bad, overall a dish that is fairly versatile, like I said I'd eat it again. We had no leftovers here.

This recipe is excellent!!! I made just a few changes. As per another reviewer, I used a can of chicken broth and topped it up with water to make 2 cups. I therefore omitted the chicken/vegetable bouillon. I also did not add the dried minced onion...just personal preference. My daughter said this tasted like professional rice. Great compliment Suzy!

This was a great addition to the keeper box. Made tonight on the suggestion of the Recipe Exchange; served with shredded chicken and some fresh corn. Per other reviewers, I only used 1 tbsp low-so soy sauce, and also used 1 cup homemade chicken stock and 1 cup water with some chicken base added.

I didn't have low sodium soy sauce and felt it was a little too salty so next time I would use just 1 t. Otherwise my husband and I liked it.  Would be good with vegetables in it as well.

My whole family liked this rice dish. I used vegetable stock instead of water and the bouillon granules. I did have to add a little more liquid as the rice was simmering. It went well with both chicken and salmon. Many Thanks

This recipe is a keeper.  At first I was a bit skeptical when I saw how simple the ingredients were, but after trying it, it is truely a winner.  Very easy to make and does not fall back on flavor.  Even my toddler loves it!

This was wonderful.  Didn't change a thing, though I'm probably going to tweak it over time.  Is going in the permanent rotation.

Quick and tasty, a great side for any meal! Be warned - the reduced sodium soy sauce is NOT a suggestion; regular soy makes eating this an unpleasant, salty experience.

Very good! I didnt have onion powder, so I doubled the dry onion, and it tasted great. The only change I would make next time is to half the soy sauce and just add some kosher salt. It was borderline "Asian-y".

Delicious! Made it exactly as stated. We had it with balsamic glazed salmon and green beans. Kids and hubs ate it up. I used Jasmine rice. Thanks for the quick yummy side dish addition to my collection!

I've made this three times now and it's a great recipe. I normally increase the recipe by half, so I'm using 1 1/2 cups of rice, 3 cups water, and am increasing the rest of the ingredients by half, except for the soy sauce.  I only use 1 1/2 tbsp. even when I'm increasing it by half.  So far, everyone has really liked this recipe.  Cook time for increasing by half is about 21 minutes simmering.

Have been looking for a good rice recipe and have not found anything I really liked but loved this one! I had a Rice-a-Roni mix that I bought on accident so I just used the rice (rice and vermicelli). Cooked in butter until browned, then added all other ingredients. I also substituted chicken stock for about 1/4 of the water.  Tasted great!! I might try adding Yoshidas teriyaki sauce instead of the soy sauce next time to add a little sweetness.

This rice was easy and flavorful.  I used chicken broth (in lieu of water/bouillon granules).  This recipe takes no longer than any boxed rice product, but it's significantly healthier and very tasty.

No one in my family cared for this and we all love rice.  It came out too strong tasting and I even cut back on the amount of soy sauce and seasoning.  Unfortunately most of the rice was thrown away.

This made a good side dish i used 1/2tsp of the herbs since I wanted lots of flavor everything else was as is. Update: I made this without the soy sauce so my picky son would eat it . Surprise! He ate it! I did use 1tsp onion soup which had onion pieces as I had no mince onion.

My family loved this recipe!  The only changes I made were to omit the onion powder (I didn't have any on hand) and use oil instead of butter (I don't mix meat and dairy).  I thought the soy sauce was going to overpower the recipe, but it did not.  Very quick to make...plus it's very tasty!

Nice rice dish...use any spices you like...I use a little less water for a fluffier rice (1 3/4c.)Thanks!

I've never tasted such a great mixture of herbs in rice. I gotta say this recipe is not only easy but delicious and super fast.

This is one of the easiest and tastiest rice side dishes I have ever made. I made it last night to go with salmon and my husband and I fought over the the last grain in the pot. I'm thinking about making more just to eat for lunch today because it was soooo good and I can't wait to have it again. Thank you!

PS - Only changes - I used Jasmine Rice, just because that's what I use. I also didn't have dry onion and used minced fresh onion. For the butter I used "I can't believe it's not butter". :)

I thought this rice had a good flavor but was a little too overpowering.  I think I may make it again with less herbs to tone it down a little.

Really loved this - an excellent way to make brown, healthy rice more interesting.  Thanks for the great idea!

very good and easy to make - the only thing different i did was add frozen chopped broccoli to it while it cooked - it was a nice side dish (hubby thought it was too strong, next time i'll use only 1 tbsp soy sauce)
