A Good Recipe. My variation is as follows: After draining and cooling the potatoes a little, I tumble them in bowl with a little butter to coat the skins. Instead of then 'smashing' the potatos, I cut a cross in the upper side of each, to about half-way through. Then, by using a finger and thumb on each hand to genyly squeeze in the lower half, (press between each cut line) the potato opens up, like a flower! This allows the seasoning liquid to flavour the inside of the potato more and, (if you don't ever fill them), crisp the skins nicely. Leftover seasoning can be added just before serving, if desired.

Excellent, with accurate cooking times and temps.  Since I was serving this with another side dish that already had herbs I omitted them here, just brushing the smashed potatoes with olive oil and sprinkling them with sea salt and pepper before baking. I used Baby Yukon Golds, trying to keep them all uniform in size. They're cute little guys, look great on the plate and, if left in the oven long enough, are crispy, beautifully browned and delicious.

I am so  sorry but I just didn't care for these potatoes.  I was so looking forward to trying them but when I was eating them I kept picking out pieces of rosemary from my mouth.  I must say that I followed the recipe exactly.  I did not change anything.  If I made them again, I might whizz the herbs in my mini processor and add maybe a little cayenne or cajun/creole seasoning.  Thanks so much for posting your recipe.

These are so GOOD and SO easy!  The first time I made them, I followed the recipe pretty closely, but when I have made them several times since, I have played around with the herbs togo with my main dish.  Always excellent!

This was a great way to prepare potatoes differently.  Sometimes I get tired of mashed and baked!  This recipe was delicious, and thumbs up from hubby and two teenage daughters.  I noticed some people had trouble getting the sauce over all the potatoes.  I drained the potatoes after boiling, left them in the pot for a bit, then poured a bit of sauce over each potato while in the pot, then gave them a  in the pot so they were well coated.  I had pork roast in the oven at 325F, so couldn't use the oven, but fried them instead.  In they went into the pan, and I smashed them there.  I just flipped them a few times, so they cooked evenly.  The herb sauce just melded into the potatoes, made them very tasty.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! It is so easy to make, yet it tastes high-class and will impress your friends and trick them into believing you're a kitchen wizard. Champagne taste on a Boone's Farm budget.

I sometimes love to add a little crumbled feta on top of the finished product. Yumbo.

I fixed these potatoes for dinner tonight and we LOVED them!  I did grind the herbs in a small food processor before adding the oil and butter. It worked really well. I doubled the recipe and the six of us (my parents ate with us tonight) finished all three pounds of potatoes. I think they would have eaten more if I'd had them. Both of our kids asked when I was planning to make them again. They can rest assured...it won't be long.

Was looking for something fast to go with meatloaf. Fantasic! Only used salt & pepper for spices. Boiled potatoes in salted water, and tossed them in oil/vinegar mixture before smashing.

I used larger yellow potatoes, and it still turned out wonderfully.  Crisp on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside.

Will definitely make theses babies again!  I changed up the recipe by adding cloves of garlic and onion wedges during the roasting time.  I also left out the herbs listed here and just used simple olive oli, sea salt, pepper and rosemary springs from my garden.  They came out crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside.  Just right!

I used half of the potatoes and the full amount of the herb mixture ... just to make sure there was enough of the sauce.  My husband and I loved this recipe.  We really like balsamic vinegar, and the herb mixture was quite tasty on the potatoes.  Next time I will half the whole recipe, as we didn't need so much of the sauce, but we will definitely make this again!

Absolutely fabulous! Very easy and oh so tasty.
Twice baked means you get that little crunch on the top of the potato and as the cook said adjust the seasonings to suit your taste

Amazing flavor and texture!  We will definitely make this again.  I had fresh savory and rosemary, so I used them.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any sage so I omitted it, but I plan to use it next time.

I had a little trouble smashing mine but in all it made no difference, since they tasted great!  I LOVED the balsamic which gave these a unique flavor for potatoes!  I think fresh rosemary would make these awesome and next time I will do that.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were quite good.  I didn't use as many herbs, but tried to base it on what we would like. This isn't to say the recipe wasn't good as is. But I knew my husband wouldn't care for the thyme and rosemary or so much garlic, so that was the only reason I changed it. I used parsley and some chives with pepper and kosher salt.  Really good and a bit different, too!!

Mmmm good! Easy squeezy. I made this recipe exactly as written, it's now on my rotation of recipes.  Family loves the "little reds".  Soft on the inside, crispy on the outside.  Wonderful melding of spices, oils and potatoes. Thank you Amanda81.  GRANDMA SUSIE

Gosh, these were delicious! I followed the potato instructions to a T. Whilst they were baking away in the oven I crisped up some onion and bacon, tipped it over the potatoes halfway through and in the last five minutes sprinkled with some grated cheese. Amazingly delicious and very filling as a meal on its own. Thank you for the recipe.

Small changes I made: I used about 4tsp butter, cut them like a baked potato and squeezed them open, topped them with sauce and baked them 30 minutes... best potatoes I've had in a very long time.

I made these last night with a bag of Trader Joe's Potatoes/Baby Medley (the bag was 28 ounces and included a mix of baby red, yellow and purple potatoes). They were absolutely DELICIOUS! My husband loved them, too and we can't wait to have them again.  I cut the potatoes in half, boiled for 20 minutes as directed, and let cool. Then I added them to the olive oil/butter/seasonings mixture in a bowl and tossed to coat well. From there, I placed the potatoes on the cooking sheet, smashed and drizzled any remaining mixture over them. Really yummy! The blend of seasonings is so good! Next time I think I am going to smash them before coating in the bowl.

Thought this recipe was great.  The key is to let the potatoes cool.  I used a silicone baking sheet to bake them on.  They came out nice and crispy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These little guys are adorable. I went with a simple combo of thyme, salt and pepper as I knew that hubs wouldn't care for the sage, savory and rosemary. I used well aged balsamic and it added a great flavour to the dish. I tried to smash them as the recipe is written but mine crumbled,  probably user error, so I cut them in half and used a fork to gently smash. The next time that I make these I will leave them in the oven a little longer to crisp up a more.

These potatoes were delicious. Used thyme,garlic,crushed red pepper nd rosemary,butter and olive oil. We like a lot of flavor so I didn't measure the spices. They were all gone!

I couldn't eat these myself due to some dietary restrictions but my guests loved them! They were easier to make than I expected. Just give yourself plenty of time: while they don't take much effort, they do require a lot of time.

The seasoning on these is to die for! I could have eaten them all day. I only had larger boiling potatoes, so I cut them into large chunks and used them instead. They weren't as pretty to look at, but, still, oh so good! Also, I omitted the salt and truly didn't miss it. We loved the crispiness formed by the outer potato surfaces + the seasoning.  A keeper!

I could not stop eating these! This recipe allows for a lot of creative modifications. I added herbs from my garden - rosemary, lemon thyme, and parsley.  My family aslo loved this dish.

I was pleasantly surprised with how well this turned out. Totally exceeded my expectations. Was looking for a change from regular old mashed potatoes and found this recipe so I gave it a shot. I only used about half as many potatoes (since I was only cooking for two) but still made the same amount of sauce. I put the rosemary through a spice grinder before adding it to the sauce. Other than that, made exactly as directed. They were super flavourful, crispy on the outside, and fluffy inside. Will make this again and again!

Great taste! I used a mortar And pestle to grind the rosemary and thyme before adding to the rest of the balsamic mixture.

I made this recipe and was not crazy about it at all. The potatoes were bland. I think the sauce would be good with more butter and mixed in fully, then baked again.

These are pretty good. I found them a bit lacking in flavour but I think that's because I had a hard time keeping the oil mixture on the potatoes. I spooned it on, it mostly ran right off. I think brushing it on would work better. I did change up the herbs based on what I had and what I like, but I tried to use the same proportions. I think next time I'd also decrease the amount of oil next time, so that it doesn't dilute the other flavours as much. I especially wanted more of the balsamic flavour. I liked this method though (other than the spooning oil on) and the little bits of skin that retained the oil mix got wonderfully crispy.

Nice departure from the "usual" potatoes, and tasty.  I microwaved tricolor small potatoes until barely cooked to tenderness. We used aluminum foil (shiny surface down-facing) instead of parchment paper and cooking time was perfect.  Flavor and texture were very appealing.   Will be making these again.

This was an instant favorite the first time out. I used a bag of Green Giant baby yukon golds which was the perfect amount for the recipe. I used a clear Collins glass with a flat bottom to get the smash right. Lots of possibilities for spice mixes to change this up.

Absolutely outstanding!  Made them first for just my husband  and myself. And he raved! Then made them again for his family and they loved them.  I had originally mad3 “plain” smashed potatoes with just olive oil and sea salt which were really good, but this recipe is the best

I always wanted to make smashed potatoes. And I've brought Dole's pre-washed mini Yukon potatoes. I had trouble firmly pressing them to partially crush it with my palms even when it was tender after 20 minutes in boiled water. Maybe it needed more time to cook and then cool. I've made only 4 and had enough for the mixture for it. Nonetheless, however round, it did taste good. Any tips on how to crush the potatoes would be great.

Can’t beat the flavor of these potatoes.   Found it difficult to mash some of them . Cut some after the first boil .  Even better the second day . Thru the third day leftovers into homemade vegetable soup!

Tried these tonight,  only changing the smash technique for Chef John's X and squish method. Absolutely delicious! An added bonus is that the whole house smells aromatic from the spice combo!!! We will make these again and again! Thank you for sharing!!!

Very good potato side dish. You can make the boiling step ahead and 30 minutes before dinner finish the recipe.
I didn't have all the herbs it calls for, but it still came out delicious. For people that were bothered by the dried rosemary, just crushed it little bit with your fingers before using it..

Easy and tasty. I had no savory so I upped the other herbs a bit and I added about 3/4 tsp cayenne pepper. It gave a low-profile kick that even the toddler at the table liked.

I made this for a dinner party and half really liked it and the other half thought there was way too much rosemary. I am going to try  again but without any rosemary. Thanks for sharing.

Move over roasted potatoes, because these are amazing! Crispy yet creamy in every bite and full of herb and garlicky goodness! I also sprinkled fresh chopped parsley just before serving. A winner in our house, all around.

Complete waste of time.par cook the potatoes add the spices and fry lightly on stove. Way better and faster with more flavour. Add some onion too.

My family loves "Smashed Potatoes"! I gave it four stars because I don't follow the seasoning recipe exactly. I don't care for rosemary or sage, so I'll add other herbs like marjoram, chives or tarragon. If I'm really trying to keep it simple I'll just do seasoning salt. I also like making this recipe with different varieties of potatoes. The little purple potatoes turn out great and taste slightly sweet. I tried some smaller sweet potatoes once but they didn't get crispy and delicious like they are supposed to, so I wouldn't recommend trying that. We serve ours with a dollop of sour cream or plain Greek yogurt on top.

I love making smashed potatoes.  I totally cheat though. I find it is much easier to just put the potatoes in a microwave. I let them cool then transfer to a baking dish and smash them.  My second cheat is to used garlic infused olive oil.  There's no chance of burning the garlic that way. You get the right amount of garlic taste this way.  I use whatever fresh herbs I have on hand.

It seemed okay.  I used red potatoes, and I think they might have been too big...they didn't smash too pretty. I will try again using the yellow, smaller potatoes.  I rate it only 4 stars, but the flaws may have been my own.

These were delicious and easy. Used dried tarragon. The 1st time I used baby red potatoes, pricked all over, microwaved in heavily sea-salted water, 10 min till fork-tender. Foil on cookie sheet, drizzled olive oil over foil. 12 peeled cloves garlic, scattered smashed garlic cloves evenly on foil using a foil covered can. Add roughly chopped onion among garlic. Cover with baby potatoes, smash w/same can. Covered w/tarragon. Drizzled all w/olive oil & seasoned salt/pepper. Baked per recipe. 3rd time made as modified, had bigger potatoes, quartered before microwaving.

My new favorite way to serve potatoes! I added extra balsamic vinegar and a different variety of herbs. I didn't have parchment paper, but greasing the baking sheet worked fine. They are delicious when still soft, too!

Sort of good, but we thought to much balsamic vinegar.  I did like how they got a crispy edge after baking, but just to sour so won't make again.

I made these three times the first week.  My family inhales them.  Like others, I mash up the taters a bit and stir with the seasoning, then bake.  Prepare to give them plenty of time to get crispy on the edges.  These potatoes should have a much more elegant name, because they truly are amazingly delicious.

We enjoyed these very much! The flavor was excellent. The only thing I would do differently is to follow one reviewer who suggested to slice open the potato and squeeze (sort of like for a baked potato), then squash gently, and then drizzle the olive oil mixture over them. Without this step, I found that too much of the oil dribbled out onto the grease-proof paper. Other wise great!

I used big red potatoes because that is what I had on hand. it was amazing. Melty, creamy and super tasty. I added a tiny bit of butter halfway thru, because they were bigger. I also used the marinade on chicken and it was amazing. The potatoes were fancy but super easy to make.
