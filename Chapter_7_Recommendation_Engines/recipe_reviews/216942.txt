Well, I didn't have any chicken so I used hamburger, and I didn't have any sweet potatoes so I used turnips, and I didn't have maple syrup so I used molasses, but I still feel I am justified in reviewing this recipe....no, no, none of the above is true, it's just that some of the reviews on this site can be so annoying sometimes. 

Anyways, this recipe actually is lovely!  Fast, easy, and it tastes great! 5 stars.

This recipe has some good things going on. The sauce with the maple syrup and onion was really good. However we felt the sweet potatoes with the sauce was a little flat. So I mixed some mashed butter and brown sugar in the potatoes to fix them. Ofcourse then you have something like candied sweet potatoes. Oh well that made them good for us anyway. Thanks for the recipe.

We LOVED it!!! I doubled it so we would have leftovers, and also added a couple tablespoons of butter when mashing the sweet potatoes. It doesn't specify as to use real Maple Syrup or not, but that's what I used.
Thanks for sharing!!!

This was amazing! When I was putting it together, I thought, "What am I doing?! All these different ingredients?" I'm not a fan of pan frying, so I put the oil on the bottom of a casserole dish, put the chicken tenders on that, poured the maple syrup on top, and sprinkled the onions on top of that. I baked at 375 until the chicken was done. Then I removed the chicken, served it on the potatoes, and drizzled the sauce over it.

This dish was fantastic!  I made it for my girlfriend, and she almost fell out of her chair!  Actually, it was I that almost fell.  I could not believe at how tasty it was, and decently healthy!!

We really liked this. I must admit that I changed the recipe a decent amount to personal taste. I am not overly fond of Montreal Steak Seasoning, so I was looking for a replacement in the spice aisle and came across a mesquite maple seasoning by the same company and used that instead. I added a little garlic powder and a pinch of red pepper. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added about 2 tablespoons each of butter and brown sugar to my sweet potatoes, which I cooked in salted water. The glaze was excellent and all the flavors came together so perfectly. I think next time, I will use caramelized vidalia onion bits in place of the green onion and add a sprinkle of parsley for the color aspect and see how that turns out. Thanks for sharing!

Don't know HOW this can have so many rave reviews. For the price of pure maple syrup well, I's save it for PANCAKES! I mean it was edible but REALLY..it was no wheres near a response such as awesome,fantastic, delicious, a staple, or any of the above! SORRY! Just was not imressed with flavors at all.

Super tasty! Who'da thunk all this would go so well together?  Went looking for a recipe for sweet potato chips; searched by ingredients (sweet potato, oil) and saw this. Just so happened I had everything in the house, down to the ingredients to make my own Montreal Steak Seasoning. Made this as directed (though I did salt the potato water, and added a pat of butter when mashing) and it's definitely a keeper. Thanks very much for sharing, Barbie!!!

Delicious! At the end, I added the chicken to the pan with the sauce, then poured over potatoes. Used a little less green onion and real maple syrup that I bought at Costco. Kids loved it too!

I couldn't believe how yummy the maple syrup glaze was with the chicken.  Who would've thought!  For the sweet potatoes, I added butter, milk and a little maple syrup for a slightly sweeter taste and it was a perfect dinner!  No complaints from my 3 & 4 year old either!  Will be making this again soon!

This was fabulous!  The maple syrup on the sweet potatoes forms a nice chewy texture to them once it cools a bit on the potatoes.  Yum!

This was fabulous! My husband is new to sweet potatoes and he thought they were great as well.  Didn't have green onions, so I sauteed an equal amount of white onion for a couple of minutes before I added the maple syrup.  We will make this again!

I really like the maple glaze, and I'd never thought of putting chicken tenders on sweet potatoes. Thanks for sharing this great idea.

I will definitely make this again!  For as simple as it was it was so tasty.  The spice of the Montreal seasoning held up well against the maple syrup and the sweet potatoes.  I was afraid leaving the sweet potatoes unbuttered and unseasoned might be dull but it was just right when the sauce and spices on the chicken mixed.  Made a nice spring salad mix on the side and enjoyed a great meal.  I'm not a naturally gifted? cook so I truly appreciate meals that have big taste payoffs for little time investment.  This will be gracing our dinner table again soon.

Loved this. Expected to hate it (I'm not a maple fan), but I loved it -- and so did my picky 10 year-old. I made as directed, with these exceptions: (1) I didn't have green onions, so I used white onions and simmered them in the oil with the chicken. The carmelized onion was delicious. And, (2) I didn't have the Montreal Steak Seasoning, so I made my own (Google "Montreal Steak Seasoning recipe" for  some excellent recipes!). A hearty, flavorful family dinner. Thanks for posting!!!

This was good, but not fabulous as other reviewers have said.  I probably will not make it again, even after following several suggestions...it was average.  I'd rather try other recipes.  Sorry Barbie.  :(

This is sooo good!  I used sweet potato fries because I had them on hand and the sauce was a great dip for them.  I also used a sweet onion instead of the green onion and it turned out fantastic!

I have nothing bad to say about this recipe, except that I ate way too much of it! My potatoes only needed to cook for about 15 minutes, so just keep an eye on them.

I loved this and will definitely make it again. The maple glaze tastes delicious over the sweet potatoes, and the steak spice adds a nice zing to the sweetness. I would suggest using more than the 2 Tsp of steak spice suggested.

Simple to make with chicken tenderloins.  Pretty, served with green peas. Probably won't make again, just no thrilled.

I've made this many times and it's always a hit with hubby and kids.  Don't worry about using expensive maple syrup, I didn't realize until this last time that I didn't have real maple syrup on hand and used the kids Mrs Butterworth's  and it worked  just as well.  Also, the ONLY thing I changed was the onions.  I sliced up an onion and carmelized it in the syrup.  REALLY tastes enhances this dish!

Husband LOVED this!  Only thing i did different was I didn't have chicken tenderloins so i cut chicken breasts into strips.  Perfect combo of sweet and savory.  went great with mashed sweet potatoes.

This recipe is great! I used Honey Aleppo Pepper seasoning, since I didn't have any steake mixes. I doubled it and used not only tenders but also cut chicken breast to the similar size, fried the meat in two batches in a stainless still skillet (Important detail! It helped to have nice browning of meat). I didn't have green onions on hand so I sauteed regular onions in the low hit in the same killet for about 10 min, then added maple syrup, boiled it a bit and added chicken back to the skillet to dress with the souse and warm it up again. The souse came up beautifuly brown and thick, it tasted outstanding. With sweet potatos, I added a tablespoon of brown sugar and two tablespoon of butter. It was great combination of flavours, my whole family loved it. My husband ate all the leftovers before I could hide it in the refregirator! It will be my go-to recipe for an easy, no fail family pleaser. Planning to make it again for a dinner party this weekend! Thank you for the recipe!

This is so simple and good. However, it needs about twice the amount of sweet potatoes for 4 servings.

Wow this is delicious!  I added a little butter to the sweet potatoes but that's all they need.  The syrup makes them plenty sweet.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and left out the onions because I didn't have any.

Want to add my kudos!  My picky daughter and husband get excited when they see this dish on the table.  I have been following several reviewers' suggestions by sautéing half a yellow onion chopped on the oil when the chicken is done and then adding the maple syrup.  The flavors of the onions and syrup are heavenly together.  The Montreal steak seasoning on chicken was unexpectedly delightful.  And this cooks up quickly...what a bonus!  Thank you, Barbie!

I nixed the steak seasoning and seasoned the chicken with a smal amount of salt. Instead of green onions I used white onions and cooked those in the pan (in the oil) prior to adding the chicken

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe as did my husband.  Instead of vegetable oil, I used 2 tablespoons of butter.  When I removed the chicken I threw in some thin slices of apple and the green onions and let those cook down a bit before putting in the maple syrup.  The apples were a spectacular addition to the glaze.  I also added a bit of butter, milk, and brown sugar to the potatoes.  I would absolutely make this again!

Pretty good and decently healthly.  Next time though I may try adding some butter and brown sugar to the sweet potatoes to kick it up a notch.

So I was skeptical about this because of the 2 bad reviews. But I was so pleased with this recipe that I signed up with the website JUST TO LEAVE THIS REVIEW! Everything was fantastic and I can't wait for the hubby to come home so I can warm up a plate for him! 

Just for perspective: I used real maple syrup because that's all I had in my fridge and it caramelized nicely with the onions. Next time I will try fake maple syrup to see if it's really worth the precious stuff! I also used yellow onions because that's what I had (and the picture does not look like green onions to me). This means I took the advice below to throw the onions in the pan with a dash of olive oil a few mins before the syrup. 

All in all, perfect!

Easy and superb!  I didn't have green onions so I used finely sliced red onions instead.  Served with minted "mushy peas" was delish!

I haven't made this, that's why the 3 stars. My question is what recipe does the picture represent? Where do the red onions in the pic come in? They actually would be my preference over green onions.

This is the easiest dinner that I have ever prepared and it is delicious!  How's that for a recommendation?  Instead of chicken "tenders" (whatever that is), I used chicken thighs and seasoned them with lemon pepper and herbes de provence.  Avoid the temptation to doctor up the maple syrup sauce.  

Perfect.  Try it!

It was quite yummy. I added some garlic and while the photo actually shows red onions (and I'm sure that would be an excellent combination) the green onions gave it just the right flavoring.

I did change some things about this recipe based on what I had on hand.  Sorry, to all the recipe purists!  I seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash and used Vidalia onions sautéed in the pan after I took the chicken out. Then I poured the generic (non)-maple syrup into the skillet to continue as the recipe instructs.  I served this with wilted spinach and dinner rolls.  I loved the pairing of the slightly bitter spinach with the sweet sauce and the potatoes.  If I made it again, I would probably use center cut pork chops as the chicken was too mild of a flavor to stand out from the sauce and potatoes.

Hubby found this recipe, so I happily let him make it -- and it's the best thing he makes, honest! :-) 

Surprisingly nice blend of flavors between the sweetness of the maple syrup (don't use pancake syrup!), the green onions and the spice (steak seasoning).

Hubby reports that this is quick and easy to make.

This recipe was just ok. The chicken didn't have enough flavor with just the Montreal steak seasoning. The maple glaze didn't really capture the green onion flavor like I thought it would. Maybe they needed to be sauteed first then add the syrup. I also added butter, cinnamon and nutmeg to the potatoes. Don't think I'll make again.

Excellent! So easy and delicious.  I added grated parmesan to the steak spice for coating the chicken, and deglazed the pan with a little chicken stock before adding the maple syrup.  Then I served it on roasted squash and baby spinach.  I will definitely make this again.

This was great and SO easy.  I didn't have enough onion and could see why they were necessary b/c it was a smidge too sweet w/o enough, so I still gave it 5 stars because that was my error and I could see how the onion would have perfectly balanced it.

UPDATE: made it again tonight with a few changes: 
I added some cinnamon with the montreal steak seasoning and also put all the herbs & cinnamon with the olive oil and heated it first to spice the oil.

Put the chicken in the warm oil, then coated both sides with the cinnamon and montreal steak sauce.  Once almost done, added a little butter to the pan to brown it.

When I added the maple syrup, I STILL didn't hve onions, so I added dehydrated ones, but think you need the real ones for the fluid, maybe with chicken broth too?  SOMETHING b/c it caramelizes which in and of itself is delicious, but hard to chew once it cools :).  I also added a few mustard seeds and a gloppy heaping teaspoon of honey mustard.  The mustard REALLY helps cut the sweetness of the maple.

STILL awesome.

I used red onion and butter flavored pancake syrup. I cooked them together with an added can of dark red kidney beans and increased the syrup to 3/4 cup. It was awesomely good!

Delicious!  Next time I'll double the chicken, since my children asked "Is there more chicken?"  I created my own Montreal Spice Mix from a recipe found on the internet.  Will definitely make again.

Yummy!  The sweet/salty combo was perfect!  Easy meal with fairly standard ingredients (I used chicken seasoning instead of steak seasoning and it turned out great).  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for sharing!

This was just awesome- I definately plan on making it again.  The steak seasoning and green onions cut the sweetness of the maple syrup so it isn't overpowering.  My husband and two year old son both asked for seconds!

I didn't expect to like this as much as I did.  It was really good.  I don't know if I bought low sodium steak seasoning but salt was the one thing that I did have to add--but I did that at the table so no big deal!

I used chicken breasts butterflied and cut into strips. I also left out the onion and added chopped (cooked) bacon. Then I layered it into a baking pan and popped it into the oven for 10 minutes. So yummy!

My first bite was OMG this is good, but after that it was really too sweet for me.  Next time I'll add more green onion and cut back on the maple syrup.  I loved it, just couldn't eat a whole lot of it.

So I am going to be "that person." I still give this recipe 5 stars because it is a really good base recipe that I could use as a starting point!

 I added toasted pecans to the maple sauce which candied them nicely. I also did not use Montreal seasoning but cajun seasoning with a healthy dose of paprika, pepper, and garlic powder. And lastly I added butter, salt, pepper and a bit of milk to the sweet potato mash. I really wanted to make a mix of spicy and sweet and it was devoured. I worried about the chives but it worked well. 

Thank you author for posting this recipe. I never would have thought about it in my own

Delicious chicken dinner with a nice root side. Of course a lot of the flavor is from the half cup of maple syrup, but its worth it. I did the same as others in their pictures and sauteed some red onion in a separate pan with some of the syrup sauce. The onion adds a nice savory tartness to an already amazing dish.

Certainly was easy and nutritious; however, I need to try it with chicken that has been soaked in salt water.  The fry did dry out the chicken to some extent, and the spice might be improved with experimentation.

Just based on what I had on hand; I used chicken drumsticks, threw them in the slowcooker, added a bunch of chopped green onions, salt free veggie spice, drizzled a little olive oil and some maple syrup over top and walked away. Made up some sweet potatoes to go with it and the toddlers devoured it all caveman-style. So good, fall off the bone tender and surprisingly delicious.

We loved this recipe! I didn’t have Monterey Steak Seasoning, so I Googled a substitute. Worked great. Also, I grilled white onions and left them in the pan while I cooked the chicken. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This dish was quite delish! We used yellow onion instead of green, which gave it an awesome flavor. I think the onion is what made the dish; without it, I don't think it would have had as much flavor.

Only change I made was to add a little butter and cinnamon to the sweet potatoes because that is the way I always make them otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  It was really good and will be making again!

This recipe is delicious!   The flavors are so good & marry so well.  I added some sautés slices of onion to the chicken & added brown sugar & butter to the potatoes. I don’t know that this made it any better, but it didn’t hurt it.

this was amazing!! first review I've written on this site, but I felt like I had to put something because it was just so good! I followed the advice of a few reviewers and used a little butter and brown sugar in my mashed potatoes, then used red onions instead of green with a little parsley on top for color. I also found a Maple bourbon steak seasoning and added just a touch of honey and smoked bacon grease to the Maple syrup. the combination was outstanding

This is delicious!  I didn't have chicken tenders or green onion on hand, so I used cut up chicken breast and about 1/4 cup of very thinly sliced and chopped onion.  I also added 2 tbls of butter to the sweet potatoes.  Because the onion is a bit more robust, I added it to the maple syrup while it was boiling to help it cook and mellow out a little.  This might be a bit sweet for some palates, but I found it to be a really nice change of pace.

I think this had amazing flavor!  The only change I made was adding roughly chopped sweet onions and a Tbsp. of butter after I removed the chicken .  I let that simmer and cook for a few minutes and then added the maple syrup and cooked for 2-3 minutes.  Served as the recipe suggested and love it.  Will definitely make this again.

This was so easy and delicious. I didn’t have any sweet potatoes so made a rice blend. Used real maple syrup and am very pleased with how it turned out. Will definitely share this with my daughters and daughters in law.

My young adult children are always pestering me to make something different and so when I came across this recipe I gave it a try. They loved it! I used red onion like the picture instead of green like the recipe. A little more  prep time was needed to dice fresh sweet potatoes and cut up chicken et al.

Such a simple and tasty recipe. I prepared it exactly as written without modifications. Delicious!! Even my picky eater liked it. Next time, I need to make larger portions. This wasn't enough for 2 adults, 2 tweens.

Excellent and easy.  I did not make the sweet potato component, I served the maple chicken and onion with coleslaw and potato salad.  The maple chicken was moist, tender, and very easy to make.  I had thick breasts, cooked them 6 minutes per side and then 2 more minutes with the onions and maple syrup in the fry pan.

I did use canned yams instead of fresh, but that can't have made that big a difference in a dish that was bland, too sweet, and a waste of good maple syrup.

The dish was OK. Lots of prep work. The chicken should be simultaneously cooking as the yams. Dish got cooled down quickly while waiting for the other steps to be done.

I tried this just last night and I can't stop raving about it. I used chicken thighs instead of tenders and the maple glaze caramelized on the skin and it was to die for. I had some maple balsamic, so I added a bit of that to the glaze, but I think it would've been just tasty without it. 
I also seasoned the sweet potatoes with a little salt, pepper, butter and garlic and it complimented the maple glaze beautifully. 
This will definitely be a staple at my house. 
Thanks for Sharing!!

Bomb Diggity Dog!!! Wife and I Devoured the whole thing! Tweeked it a bit but stayed the course.. only extras I did were.... sautéed some red onions in the same pan as the chicken, throwing them in when chicken was half done, and removed all from the cast iron when chicken was done. Made the sauce as discribed but used a lil less than 1/2 cup of green onions..looked as if there would be more onions than sauce if I added it all. 
Added a 3tbs of butter, 1tbs brown sugar, and 1tbs of shredded coconut to the sweet potatoes before mashing, and used real maple syrup.. other than that I had to fight the wife off my plate.. Will definitely make again

I got this recipe in my email today and had all the ingredients on hand...it sounded really weird,  flavor combo wise....but, I figured,  meh, why not? This was AWESOME! The savory of the steak seasoning played so well with the sweetness of the sauce.  The green onion added another layer to the flavor profile,  but I do think that sauteed, or caramelized onions would play well too (after reading other reviews). Followed the recipe exactly,  except for using chicken breast instead of tenders. Minor deviation. I highly recommend this!!! TY for submitting! Hubby and I have happy tummys!

I like the recipe.  The steak seasoning on chicken didn't work for me.  To each their own, and that's an easy fix, whatever your preference is.

Excellent!  Very different, but delicious.  Only thing thing I did different was jazz up the sweet potatoes a bit.   Added butter, salt, brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice.  Will def be making this again!

I didn't have sweet potatoes, so I paired it with zesty roasted red potatoes. The composed bite was incredible. The sweet of the chicken paired well with the spicy starch flavors of the potatoes. I'm making this again and again

We made this recipe as directed with the exception that we cooked the sweet potato in the microwave and did not use onions in the chicken.  This was delightful. I found the Montreal seasoning a bit too spicy sometimes so I might cut it back next time. We will definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I put butter and brown sugar in the sweet potatoes and put the chicken back into pan with the sauce and let it simmer for a few instead of drizzling the sauce over the chicken.  Quick, easy, and tasty.  Will definitely make this again and again!

I loved it! Hubby liked it, teenage daughter gobbled it up but the two younger kiddos didn't care for it. Sigh. 
This recipe will vary dramatically with the "Montreal" or other spice mixture used, but it's a fantastic combination of flavors and very easy preparation. I did add a little butter to both  brown the chicken better and add creaminess to the sweet potatoes--a little goes a long way. 
Thanks for the great idea!

This recipe did well for a recent Paleo diet.  It was tasty in the fact that the chicken was moist & the sauce & sweet potatoes paired well together.

Me and my boyfriend LOVED this the first time I made it. I made it again though and the sauce did not turn out right and I can't figure out why! The first time I made it the sauce was thin and well... Saucy! I made it this second time and when I poured the maple sauce over the chicken, it immediately hardened up and it's making it very difficult to eat.

This is an easy go-to weeknight meal that can quickly be made.  We are not used to eating such sweet tasting things/meals/drinks so it was a little too much on the sweet side for me. So, to make it a little less sweet & maple syrupy, the only additions/adjustments i made was to  first de-glaze the pan (after cooking chicken) with some wine & then add in about 1/2 - 3/4 of the amount of maple syrup in the recipe. And i couldt resist adding a little bit of butter to the potatoes before mashing them.

OMG!!! This was really good!  I question myself at the end of cooking the chicken before putting the maple syrup in the fry pan as a lot of the bits on the bottom of the pan looked like to were really over cooked...but did it anyway...and OMG the Flavor was A+...Will definitely do this on again!

I followed this recipe almost exactly  (I used chicken breast rather than chicken tenders as it was what I had on hand). It was simple, yummy and quick to make. I will definitely make it again though I might microwave the sweet potatoes for a softer mashed consistency.

One of my favorite meals! Hits the spot and my pregnancy cravings.  Made a much smaller portion for myself and ended up wanting more. It is delicious.

Great flavor and very nice presentation! Only change was I didn't use chives, just sprinkled with parsley before serving. It has been requested I make it again soon!

I actually changed quite a lot about this dish, mostly additions & my household liked it enough to request it again & that is a big compliment with these picky eaters. First, I used a burbon & brown sugar steak seasoning & used the whole thing, not just 2 tbsp. I sliced a whole vidalia onion & used about a tablespoon of the seasoning on them while sauteeing. Set aside. I also had half a yellow & red peppers, & sliced, lightly sauteed & added them in with the onions.  I also added a nip of burbon once everything was in the same skillet. It *was* sweet, but the spices in the steak seasoning balanced it out nicely for us. The sweet potatoes were mashed according to my household's usual preference.

I used chicken breast and thigh, 1 yellow onion sliced thin and doubled the maple syrup. It was easy and came out delish.   I also made the sweet potatoes earlier in the day and reheated it which was helpful.

We loved this! I followed the recipe exactly and was really pleased with how it turned out. I did add a little salt to my plate at the end, but my husband preferred it unsalted. A quick and easy recipe that doesn't require many ingredients. For our family,  5 svgs = 3-4 individual adult-sized meals

Perfect quick maple glaze. I used spicy Montreal steak seasoning and it was the perfect balance of sweet and heat. Served with couscous instead of sweet potatoes for a lighter summer dinner.

This is a great combo of flavors! I sautéed two onions with the chicken, then added the maple syrup (I used fake-o maple syrup and it was great) and simmered. I used a cracked pepper/garlic/red wine marinade/seasoning. Yum!

I just happened to have these ingredients on hand - thought why not.  Everybody raved over this one.  For me I would decrease the amount of montreal steak seasoning as I am not that crazy over pepper - but the rest of the family said to leave it as is.  Especially like the function that increases or decreases the serving sizes.  Will definitely make again

The potatoes were OK. My husband really disliked the texture from the green onions, so he picked all those out. The potatoes probably would have been better with some spices (cinnamon, ginger, etc.). I can't really rate the chicken because I used a homemade version of Emeril Essence instead of steak seasoning, and I cooked it for less time at medium high (though we did like that!).

A bit too much on the steak seasoning for my 11 year old, but my husband and I really liked this.  It may just be too 'sophisticated' for kids' tastes.  Pretty quick to throw together, and the chicken tenders came out fairly juicy.  Coming from someone like me, who does NOT like white meat, that's pretty high praise!

Great, easy recipe! I used regular onions and added almost 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the 1/2 cup of maple syrup because I had double the chicken tenders and did not want to add more syrup. Also, made my own Montreal Steak seasoning (Searched online-will be keeping this recipe too.). Served over regular mashed potatoes since we are not big sweet potato fans. This is a keeper!!

I've made this about 5x since I first saw it. I always double it. I don't generally have chicken tenderloins, so I cut regular boneless-skinless breasts into large chunks. One of my daughters suggested adding pecan pieces to the maple, but I don't know how that will go with the onion.  One time I started it before realizing we didn't have maple syrup, so I used butter, brown sugar, and a little water. It was still yummy. It's so good. We have a big family meeting tonight, and I'm making this because everyone loves it and it puts us all in a good mood! Thanks for a good 'un!

My kids love this! It's sweet but tangy from the seasoned chicken.  We use less potatoes since lest over sweet potatoes are ok. You can keep the reduction and dip chicken bites into it too.  Good winter or fall meal

This was a great combination of sweet and savory flavors!  I only made 1 minor change.  Instead of boiling and mashing the sweet potatoes, I cut them in 1" cubes, drizzled with oil, tossed with half the Montreal steak spice and roasted them in the oven at 375F.  While the potatoes were cooking, I cut chicken breasts in chunks, tossed with remaining steak spice and browned in the skillet, adding sliced white onion near the end.  Then I poured in the maple syrup with the chicken, added the roasted sweet potatoes, and stirred so all was coated with syrup.  Then it was all spread on the baking sheet that the potatoes had been done on, baked another 10 minutes so the syrup became bubbly and a little caramelized.  So yummy!  Even my hubby, who is not a fan of sweet potatoes, loved it.

This is a dish that is loaded with flavor.  I thought the combination of chicken and maple syrup sounded odd, but it works, and it works very well.  Knowing that my hubs would not eat the sweet potato I fixed a sweet potato for me and a Yukon Gold potato for him.    Since I only made two potatoes, I just fork-mashed them on separate plates and added the chicken, onions and sauce.    I used some green onions and some red onion as that is what I had on hand.  The maple syrup glaze is so delicious on this chicken dish.  It was a wonderful meal that I will be making again.

I agree..delicious!  I used yams, but might try sweet potatoes next time.  I did mash them w/1 T butter and some salt.  I used red onion and put them in the pan for a couple of minutes before adding the real maple syrup. I also made green beans and rolls.  The plate was pretty and colorful. The rolls blotted up the remaining syrup and it was almost as good as a cinnamon roll.

I was looking for a recipe to use some 100% pure,fancy, VT maple syrup that I received as a gift at a wedding.  This recipe was perfect.

I cooked my chicken and onions at the same time in a little olive oil and a bunch of montreal steak seasoning.   Afterwards, I removed the chicken and poured in the little (wedding favor sized) bottle and let it come to a boil.  I was pretty shocked at the flavor from the maple, montreal steak seasoning and onions together.  Beautiful.

oh this was SOOOOOO Good! I was looking for a unique way to prepare chicken and tried this one! I made the following alterations because it was what I had: Montreal CHICKEN seasoning from McCormick, Olive Oil, and regular white onions. I did add cinnamon and honey to the sweet potatoes for personal preference! My husband licked the plate clean!

Well first off great recipe!! I only made a few changes, I did what others suggested and added brown sugar and butter to the sweet potatoes and I used chicken thighs because that's what i had, and cut up red onion because is on the picture lol. Followed the recipe and love it!! Served with oven roasted asparagus on the side with the sweet potatos.. yummy!!

This is really good. Made it as written. It was too sweet for me as I haven't eaten much sugar lately. So next time I will serve it with the sauce on the side, so we can each add our own amount. The flavors are quite wonderful though.

We really enjoyed this. It was very easy to make, I used a maple, bacon steak seasoning on the chicken to give it some more flavor and I added butter, nutmeg and cinnamon to the sweet potatoes. The sauce was very tasty!!

This is really good.  It is not necessary to use genuine maple syrup; you can use Mrs. Butterworth's or some other brand of pancake syrup.  I also caramelized a yellow onion instead of using green onions, and it was great.  I agree with some of the other reviews and think it is a good idea to add a little brown sugar and butter to the sweet potatoes.

I found this with the ingredient search. Simple to make and just enough taste without being too sweet. Had my doubts on the Montreal Style Seasoning, but the sauce wouldn't have worked without it. I did use sugar free (read: fake) maple syrup and it was fine.  I use a lot of frozen chicken tenders and eat sweet potatoes 2-3 days a week, so it was a winner for me.

Great, super easy, perfect for weeknite meal. I did use a bit more maple syrup than the recipe called for. I dont see why you couldnt use canned sweet potatoes to make it that much easier. Will make again.

Just made this for my family - I could tell my husband was suspicious while I was cooking, but he loved it! The chicken was really flavorful -- my 2 year old loved it. I also added about 3 tbs. of butter to the yams when I mashed them (I'm pregnant, I like butter). That in conjunction with the maple glaze made them to die for! Definitely keeping this recipe around.

I was pretty excited to try this recipe, but sadly it was a disappointment. Mostly the glaze...it got all hard, like taffy, and was off-putting. The chicken got a little too crispy, but that was my fault. I still give two stars b/c I think some of why this recipe failed me is my own fault. I'd be willing to try again and see if I get different results.

Very good, I didn't have steak seasoning so I used a Caribbean Jerk seasoning. My husband really liked the glaze.  Super easy and quick, we will be making this again!
