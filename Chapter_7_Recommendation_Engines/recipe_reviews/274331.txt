One thing I will probably change next time is I'll make a double recipe of the crust. I made it in a wider pan so it didn't quite cover it.  Other than that it turned out very well. Not too sweet. Just right.

They're done when YOU say! Cook them a little less, you'll get moist and dense. Overcook and you have a dry cake. Deeeeelishus!!!!

Moist and delicious. Not too sweet. I would cut back the baking time next time as the top overly browned and the blueberries started bursting. Overall a very good bake and keeps fresh for several days .
