I love sweet potatoes,so I thought this sounded good.Next time I'll add an extra cup of potatoes and less sugar,and even a little less topping.I couldn't taste enough of the sweet potatoes.It seemed like the topping over powered them.Even though,it was very good.

My aunt has made this for years. We call it sweet potato casserole. I have made it several times now. It is wonderful! You could eat it as a dessert. We always use 3- 15oz canned yams (brand name yams). We also use 1 stick of butter (use real butter), 1/2 cup of white sugar and cinnamon to taste. The topping is thick, so you'll have to spread it(not sprinkle). It is definitely a recipe your family will beg you to bring every holiday dinner and then fight over who will get the last serving.

Definite 5 stars.  Followed people's advice about cutting the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg and ground ginger.  I've made it twice already -- once yesterday and once today -- both for a group of people.  Gone in a flash.

This recipe is fast and easy. Everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner loved it. I used baked sweet potatoes once and canned yams another time. Both were equally great!

I made this to accompany a large pork loin roast. It was for a large gathering. I asked for a show of hands, "Who hates sweet potatoes?"..several went up. I asked that they just take a sample of this sweet potato souffle. After dinner I asked again, "Who hates sweet potatoes?"..NO hands went up!! They all loved it! EVERYONE requested the recipe! Great compliment to pork and, of course, turkey.

This recipe has made me the superstar of Thanksgiving – people wait for this to arrive.  Up until I had this dish I had never encountered a sweet potato side that I actually liked!  The flaked coconut addition really makes this dish unique and TDF.   I do make some modifications to this recipe to cater it more to my own personal tastes – I reduce the white sugar to ¼ c. otherwise this dish is way too overwhelmingly sweet, I also reduce the butter in the soufflé to ¼ c. and the butter in the topping to ¼ c., I add cinnamon and nutmeg to the soufflé mix, and I substitute pecans for walnuts in the topping.   Thank you so much Ricki for proving that sweet potatoes can taste good!

I give this 4 stars because it looks like it would be way too sweet for me, but i did change the recipe quite a bit and would give that version 5 stars.  I cut the sugar WAY back- only about a tablespoon of white sugar and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar for the topping.  Also cut the butter to about 2 Tbsps. I added cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.  Turned out great!  Much healthier and less like a dessert, but very flavorful with the spices.

My friends say this is the best thing that I make, and it's super easy!  We stumbled upon the recipe several Thanksgivings ago and have been using it ever since.  You can also substitute sweet squash for the sweet potatoes.

This dish is delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the amount of sugar mixed with the sweet potatoes by half.  Next time I make this dish, I would leave out the white sugar COMPLETELY.  I have a sweet tooth, and even for me...with the decreased sugar, it was too sweet. I would also add another cup of mashed sweet potato, and/or a touch of evaporated milk for richness.  The brown sugar/coconut topping, to me, is the star here!  I absolutely loved it!  I consider this to be a solid recipe as it's good on it's own, and can be altered easily to adjust for different tastes.  Thanks SO much for sharing!

Absoulutely Excellent.  This was super easy to make.  It was a hit at our Easter Brunch.  It will be a staple from now on.  I made the souffle part a day ahead and it kept well.  I added to coconut mixture right before baking.  It was wonderful.  Can't give it anything better thank fabulous!!!!!

This is wonderful!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar, egg substitute for the eggs, and omitted the coconut altogether.  Thumbs up for all of the changes except the egg substitute, which made it too runny.  The kids will think it's a dessert and you'll know it's really sugar free.  My husband, who doesn't eat ANY veggies, loves this.  I highly recommend this for anyone.  Because of this recipe, I always bring the sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving!

This was very good, and very sweet. Keep the potatos firm. Otherwise they mush under the topping.

This was absolutely delectable!  My only change was substituting maple syrup for the white sugar because as a Canadian I need to use maple syrup in sweet potato recipes.  I used 3/4 cup maple syrup plus 1/4 cup cane sugar since maple syrup is not as sweet as white sugar.  I was worried about the consistency with all the extra liquid but everything turned out fine.  I received many compliments even from people who never give compliments so be prepared... We ate the leftovers cold and it was even MORE delicious than at the Thanksgiving meal.

I don't like sweet potatoes very much, but I thought this recipe was delicious.  And, for those that like them anyway, they LOVED this recipe!  Very easy and pretty fast to make - this will definitely appear on our holiday table in the future.

It was too sweet and had too much butter for my taste. The reason I gave it four stars is because I really liked the topping recipe.

This is delicious! I just made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I made it without coconut because I didn't have any on hand but it still came out so good! I would suggest decreasing the amount of butter in the topping if you make it without coconut. I bet it taste even better with coconut. Also, my sister HAD to include marshmallows so she spread some on top and baked it for several more minutes. It really doesn't need marshmallows but it tasted fine with them. Great recipe!

One word to sum up this dish;

WOW!!!!!

This is absolutely incredible as is!! One thing i would keep in mind, is that the "topping" portion only gives you about enough to just cover the top.  I like a nice crunchy topping so i will make probably 25% - 35% more.

Tastes like apple crumble topping on pumpkin pie.

If you want to show off for someone special MAKE THIS DISH!!!!

I would give it more stars if i could!

I made this for our family Thanksgiving dinner and this was the star of the dinner. People couldn't stop talking about it and kept asking for the recipe. They said one difference was using real sweet potatoes instead of canned. It was wonderful, and definitely a keeper!!

I will make this recipe again. I made a mistake the first time & put only 2 cups mashed sweet potato. Made the dish overly sweet.
I'm not too fond of flaked coconut so I cut the measure in half and made the missing half of oats.
Ground the nuts as fine as I could 'cause I can't chew them.
Added the extra spices as recommended by other readers.
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp ginger
1/4 tsp cloves

Put the added spices in both the sweet potato and the topping, so double the spice amount.

I think the recipe will come out great next time.

Out of five different recipes I made on Thanksgiving this is the one people requested the recipe for.  I think I used Yams instead of Sweet Potato but the result was still popular.

This was sooooooo good...My hubby doesn't like sweet potatoes, and he just couldn't get enough of this. Hours after dinner I see him in the living room munching on the leftovers of this wonderful dish, with coolwhip on top, and glass of Milk. This will defintely be served in our house again :)

I made this for our thanksgiving dinner mainly for the guests that like sweet potatoes (me not being one).  I couldn't help but try it after everyone kept commenting on how good it was.  So, I tried it and it was WONDERFUL!  To my disappointment, there were no leftovers!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used pecans instead of walnuts (what I had on hand).  Definately a hit with the guests!

I have used this recipe twice over the last two holiday seasons, and both times the results have been VERY positive.  Gobbled up by even the most finicky of eaters!  The only substitution I make to this recipe is the use of chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  I think I like the idea of a praline-type topping, but I'm sure it would be delicious with walnuts as well.  Thank you, Ricki, for what has become a holiday staple in my household!

Fabulous!  I don't like sweet potatoes, but it's easy to forget thats what these are!  Deliciously sweet and rich.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I wondered if this should be served as a dessert but everyone voted no, even though it tastes like one!

Yum!  This is the second year I've made this for the holidays, as this was requested again by my family.  Everyone made a point to ask about it and complimented me on how delicious it was.  I will probably be making this again next year, knowing my family.

This was delicious!  The sweet, crunchy topping is what made this dish so tasty!  Everyone in my family complemented me on it, and I am an inexperienced cook (this was only my 4th dinner I have made).  I will absolutly be making this dish again.

I've used this recipe for 35 years and its always a hit. I've added raisins to the yam mixture before. I also add a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  I've also used the canned or fresh yams. Both are great. If I'm in a hurry I'll buy the individually wrapped microwaveable yams so in 10-12 minutes fresh yams are ready. I've also cooked fresh yams overnight on low heat in my crockpot. This is an easy way to free up the oven and have the yams readily available. It also helps the yams maintain moisture. Especially if you add 1/4 cup of water into the crockpot. This recipe is also good with apples or pears instead of yams.

I have been making this recipe ever since I got it out of a church recipe book many years ago.  The only difference is that I only use 1/2 cup of coconut and prefer pecans rather than walnuts.  My original recipe called for a full cup of sugar but after seeing this, I believe I'll make it with just 1/2 cup this year.

Not a great fan of coconut or walnuts, so nixed them from the recipe. We loved this dish, such an easy yet excellent side dish to accompany dinner, even a dessert or anytime sweet. Fun change w/a good steak dinner...yum.

This was one of the best if not the best Sweet Potato dish I've ever made/tasted.  One of my guests kept going uhmmm, uhmmm, yummm the whole time.  I added about 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice (made my own from this site) and I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, but those were the only changes I made.  I wasn't sure how much 3 cups would amount to in and used 5 yams.  It was perfect.  Thank you Ricki.

AWESOME! Very easy to make and it tasted like dessert. The combination of spices was perfect. I almost left the coconut off because my husband doesn't like coconut, but that is what really makes the dish! He loved it even with the coconut. I will definitely make this again for holidays and special meals. This time I made it for Christmas dinner.

Made this for three different Christmas/New Year's potlucks. People love it. Peeled, cubed and boiled sweet potatoes about 15 minutes, then mashed well with potato masher. Substituted demerara sugar for brown, pecans for walnuts (we are in the South), added cinnamon and nutmeg to mixture as well as topping, used straight evaporated milk for milk.  This went immediately into the Recipe Box. This will be our standby. Thanks!

I used pecans instead of walnuts, but hey, I'm from the south and the natural choice is pecans. Have done this recipe a couple of times now and contrary to some of the other reviews I haven't found it to be too sweet, in fact, it hasn't turned out to be nearly as sweet as I had thought it would be. Great recipe!

I've made this twice, the first time I used fresh sweet potatos and made the recipes exactly like it called.  The souffle was a bit runny.  The second time I used canned, and reduced the vanilla and it came out perfect!!  This dish is absolutly fantastic!!  Thank You so much!

Outstanding recipe!  My friends and family love it when I make this.  I did leave out the coconut (don't like it) and I used pecans and walnuts for the topping.  Fabulous!

I give 4 stars only because it is way too sweet and I have a huge sweet tooth.  So for me to say that I know it is too sweet. Next time i'll cut the sugar amount in the sweet potatoes to a sprinkle.  This def is more like a dessert than a side dish.  The coconut in the topping is delicious and I used walnuts and they added a great touch.  I covered for the first 20 minutes of baking but found the top wasn't getting crunchy so I wouldn't cover next time.  I can't wait to try again with less sugar because it was yummy!

This was a fantastic addition to our Thanksgiving dinner. I was especially pleased when my husband (who detests sweet potatoes)mentioned them to family members that arrived for dessert. The coconut/brown sugar mixture made this dish, and I intend to try it on my next Coconut Custard pie.

I absolutely LOVE this receipe!  I made it to bring to a family Thanksgiving dinner and made it again for my own Christmas celebration.  Huge hit with most.  (There were a few who do not like sweet potatoes and didn't wish to taste.) This dish is incredibly delicious.  The topping is a wonderful bonus to this already great dish!! 5 Stars all the way!!  If you like coconut, you'll never need another sweet potato receipe -- you'll make this again & again.  (If you have guests that don't care for coconut or find the topping too sweet, they can just spoon it aside.)

One of my favorites for the Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, Mother 's Day celebrations! I reduced the white sugar & used only 1/4 c. & also reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 c. I also added 2 tsp. of bourbon for added flavor.  It usually disappears quickly!  If there is any left-over, I serve it warmed-up on a ham sandwich!! I have been asked for the recipe at least twenty times!! It's definitely a keeper!

This is my favorite sweet potato recipe. I tried this several years ago as a Thanksgiving side dish, and it was an immediate hit! My husband does not care for sweet potatoes and refuses to try it, but that means there is more for me :0) .

This was amazing. Even my uncle who doesn't like walnuts, couldn't tell it had walnuts it was so good. The topping makes an excellent crust. And my cousin, who doesn't like sweet potatoes, liked this.

I make this recipe every holiday, a family favorite.  I make one BIG change that makes a world of difference...instead of sweet potatoes, use Japanese sweet potatoes, found at farmer's markets or Asian grocery stores, makes it 10x better!

great recipe! i added cinnamon and nutmeg as suggested by others. also cut down on the sugar in the sweet potato mixture, which i will do with the crumble topping next time. i omitted the coconut, which is why it ended up too sweet, i guess. also, i put everything on a graham crust (in an 8x8 square pan) so it became more like a pie. but it was great! will make this again soon!

After not being able to find her usual sweet potato bake recipe for Thanksgiving this year my mom asked me to look for one.  Honestly, at first the coconut and walnuts made us both a little concerned but we followed the directions and doubled the recipe... It turned out GREAT!  Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving!  This is a definate keeper!

This had a very good flavor, I think I may have done something wrong though, it didn't have the texture I thought it would. It was somewhat runny.  I did use canned sweet potatoes so that may have been why, but I drained them very well.  I will try this again using baked sweet potatoes.  Otherwise, fantastic!

Yum, yum, yum!  Everyone loved this!  I can't eat walnuts so omitted those and used oats in their place.  I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and added cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves due to other reviewer suggestions.

This was a good recipe, although next time I will follow the recipe vs. taking advice from others.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup as suggested & added more sweet potatoes (5 cups) and it just wasn't as tasty as I think it could've been.  Luckily I had made a traditional sweet potato casserole and I ended up mixing the two & it was too die for!!  Next time...I will do everything the recipe calls for and add mini marshmellows to the top when it's done to broil for 2 minutes.  It will be fabulous

Sooo yummy. Even my husband who isn't fond of sweet potatoes loved it! I baked the sweet potatoes first and scooped out the inside using some of the skin. You won't be disappointed with this recipe!

I microwaved fresh sweet potatoes and used the mixer to "mash" them. This was a wonderful,easy recipe that I will incorporate into every holiday meal!! I used 1/2 brown sugar/ 1/2 white sugar and substitued pecans for walnuts-what a dish!I suggest before adding any spices-try the recipe as is first- and tweak it later according to your tastes.

DELICIOUS!  I made this for T-giving dinner yesterday and it was a hit.  The coconut topping with its added crunch and flavor was a great twist on the traditional sweet potato dish.  To save time, and as suggested in a previous review, I used 3 cans(15 oz each) of canned yams in place of having to cook the sweet potatoes myself. Everything else was as instructed on recipe. Yes, it was sweet like dessert, but IMO, it was not TOO sweet. Will definitely be on my holiday table every year.

This was fabulous.  I didn't change a thing, except for substituting pecans for the walnuts.  I baked 3 sweet potatoes for 1 hour to make the 3 cups.  The coconut was an unexpectedly nice addition.  I hope to make this again soon.

I can't give it a perfect 5 because I didn't make the recipe as is.  However, after using the tips in the reviews, I would give it rave reviews.  I made it for the T-giving Potluck at work yesterday and people liked it and asked for the recipe.  Changes:  did not add any sugar to the sweet potato mixture, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I din't use coconut.

This was delicious!  The topping was wonderful.  Almost like a dessert.  My kids don't like nuts so I chopped them very fine and they didn't know they were in there!  Yummmmm!

This was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. Did NOT add coconut flakes (yuk!) but it still tasted great. Added ginger and allspice as  well stepped it up a notch.

It’s been my family’s favorite for years now. I tried it per original recipe and modified as others suggested. This year making it with pecans instead of coconut flakes. All I can say there were never any leftovers even though I always double the recipe.

Not really a "souffle" because you are supposed to separate the egg yokes from the whites and beat the white to be fluffy.  It is hard to get the entire egg to fluff up.  This is simply a fast easy savory yet sweet dish. Nothing to write home about.

this is a very forgiving recipe and easy to make. My family requests it every Thanksgiving and Christmas. Want it a little healthier? Cut back on the sugar a little, still great. Have a little more or less of mashed sweet potato? Don't worry still turns out great. Make extra because it reheats well and tastes great as a leftover.

I made this 2 weeks before Thanksgiving for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a bunch of kids and their parents for an after-school tutoring program.  THEY RAVED OVER THIS DISH!  Seriously, I couldn't believe it.  And it wasn't like there wasn't much food to choose from... there was.  Maybe 15 things.  So I ended up sending this recipe to several people I'd never even met before.  

Changes?  Yes.  1/2 c coconut.  Used drained canned yams.  Ended up cooking it twice as long because the yams were so wet, but the reviews were still stellar.

Go for it!  I'm making it again today for Thanksgiving lunch tomorrow.  :)

Cutting the butter back to 1/3 stick of butter in place of the 1/3 cup of butter works better for me both in the mixture and the topping.

The only changes I made were: I omitted the coconut, and added a dash of cinnamon. The nuts I used were pecans. I scaled this recipe down to half, (there's only 2 of us). Other than that, I followed recipe to a T. Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe and it was great.  The texture color and flavor were perfect.  I did a small change and it was that for the top i convine everything at once and did not melted the butter.  It helped me a great deal and it cooked wonderful. One thing is that i use it as a dessert everybody loved it.

It's delicious, my kids all love it.  I have made it exactly as the the recipe states, and I've also made it using less sugar (1/2 cup, and I used brown instead of white) and less butter (1/4 cup) and it was still excellent.  The topping is good, although it makes way too much.  If you don't happen to have coconut on hand, I have used oatmeal instead; both are good.  Very tasty.

Very good. Nice rich flavor and wonderful texture. This was a hit at my Thanksgiving party. I also added coconut extract to the mixture and used coconut milk instead of regular milk. We love pecans so I substitute pecans for walnuts. The topping adds a nice candied flavor. Yummy!

this was definitely a table pleaser, but I did change the recipe and reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup and added cinnamon and nutmeg as was recommended. Next time I will reduce the sugar even more and reduce it in the topping as well.

I used pecans instead of walnuts.  This seriously is the best sweet potato recipe ever!  I've made several others and no one raved like they did with this one. My mother was an excellent cook, and at Thanksgiving dinner my sister said that my sweet potatoes were even better than Mom's.  Now that's a compliment!

I made this for Thanksgiving with my family and got a ton of compliments on it. I made it exactly as stated but it did end up making more topping then the casserole really needed. I just used what I needed and tossed out the rest but I'd probably reduce the amounts by 1/3 or so. Good recipe, but very sweet.

I made this recipe today and it was a hit.  I always buy my canned sweet potatoes but now I will always make this recipe.  I used a variation of another souffle recipe and added the eggs yolks to the mix.  Used the mixer to beat the egg whites until stiff and folded them onto the batter and baked in a greased pan.  I cut down on the sugar and added marshmallows at the end and baked for few minutes.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

Didn't like it at all. I tasted more like a dessert than a side dish. I always love sweet potato but perhaps this recipe used too much sugar!

Delicious and easy.  I loved the addition of coconut.  A great change-up for sweet potatoes.

I made this souffle for Thanksgiving.  My entire extended family loved it.  I especially liked it because it had coconut.  I wasn't able to make it with nuts because of a particular guest.  The coconut was a nice addition instead of just the butter and sugar.  I have a request to prepare this with our Christmas Ham dinner.  Super easy to make.
