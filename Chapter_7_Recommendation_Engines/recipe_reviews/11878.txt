One of my oldest recipes. Minus the pie crust-The spaghetti is crust enough and I also slice up meatballs instead of ground beef. Always delicious!! And this time I added peas for the kids.

Great recipe!  Since I'm single, I'm always looking for recipes that re-heat well.  This one fits the bill--the pasta doesn't get soggy after heating again.  It also freezes well.  I've made this 3 times, and have made a few adjustments to suit my preferences.  No pie shell (reduces fat grams), used 2 cups of spaghetti sauce, added some garlic powder and oregano to the meat mixture, and parmesan cheese on top of the meat mixture in addition to the mozarella.

I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but...   I am sorry to say this was really terrible!  Perhaps it was the fact that I love the ORIGINAL version of Spaghetti Pie (and there are many variations) or the fact that by adding a pie crust, to pasta adds a multitude of fat, calories and carbs.  I thought I would give it a try in case it would 'add more' to an already great recipe. WRONG! Putting hot noodles in a pie shell wasn't a good idea. 

It was pointless to add a crust to pasta. Did you just hear the words, "Spaghetti Pie" and thought it HAD to be in a pie crust? Oh and there is another reviewer who stated that a 'pie shell' is not a 'pie crust', and inferred that a 'pie shell' is just a pie plate... Google 'pie shell' it's the same as a 'pie crust'. AND you don't put the type of pan in the ingredients!

I would much rather have my Spaghetti Pie and a piece of garlic bread!  And, of course a salad:)

My husband and I really liked this recipe!  I made it as per the recipe but substituted cheddar cheese for the mozzarella as it was all I had on hand.  Although other reviewers preferred this pie without the crust, I think it added nicely to the flavor.  This recipe goes into our favorites.

not a bad little dish. dont use the pie shell as it is not needed. you can even make about 2 lbs of the pasta and use a reg. lasagna pan if you need more then the 9 inch pie shell bowl makes. of couse most of this depends on how good the sauce is

As many other reviewers stated I didn't think the crust made sense so I didn't use one.  I doubled the recipe in a 9x13 pan and used spiral whole wheat noodles.  It turned out great and is a nice change from regular spaghetti.

I cut out the pie shell- it really would make no sense to have it with spaghetti, like other reviews said.  I also substituted sauteed mushrooms, bell pepper and onion for the meat to make a vegetarian version.  Turned out exellent, and so pretty in the dish!  Most certainly a dish I will make again

I made this for a food exchange.  Everyone raved.  I omitted the pie shell, used meatballs instead of ground beef and sprinkled the Parmesan cheese over the spaghetti after putting in the 8x8 dish rather than mixing with spaghetti.  Next time, I might try with penne rather than spaghetti.

This recipe was very easy and very enjoyable! Even my sister, who hates spaghetti, asked for seconds! I left out the crust, however, and combined the ricotta cheese mixture with the spaghetti before putting the meat and sauce on top. A great recipe that I will be sure to make again!

I was looking for a kid-friendly recipe that would travel well. This one fits the requirement. I too omitted the crust and just put the pasta into the pie plate. I used my family recipe for pasta sauce in place of the ground beef and spaghetti sauce and my husband rated it "a keeper". Simple to make.

Our family loved this!!  I did not use the crust, and can't imagine that being any good.  It is perfect without it.  It's easy to go ahead and make 2 since the ingredients you buy to make it come in the sizes to double the recipe.  I did add a minced garlic clove, and Italian spices to the meat to give it more flavor.  My husband liked it better than just regular old spaghetti I usually make!!  Very nice change!!

I needed a main dish for a potluck and this recipe called for ingredients that I already had on hand.     I increased the servings to 18.  Changes that I made were:  I DID NOT use a pie shell, but just baked it in a large metal roasting pan lined with foil.  I used angel hair pasta that I had on hand.  I probably had more meat than it called for, but used what I had -- 3/4 of it was ground beef & 1/4 was ground turkey.    I substituted half of the ricotta cheese with cottage cheese that I already had.  I didn't have the full amount of spaghetti sauce on hand; it was OK but next time I'll use the amount it calls for.  I strongly recommend only cooking the pasta to 'al dente' and for the large quantity I was cooking, you must stir it constantly!  The only negative that I could say is that I found it to be extremely difficult to stir the parmesan cheese into the pasta - probably best to do that while the pasta is hot.  But DO NOT stir in the egg whites when the pasta is hot - they cook in clumps too quickly!     It turned out wonderful!  Similar taste to lasagna, but much lighter in texture.  I received several very positive comments about this dish!   Thanks!  Janet

This recipe is so easy and my husband loves it.  It still tastes good reheated in the microwave at work for lunch the next day.  I don't use the crust because the spaghetti makes a great crust already.

This recipe is amazing!!! Btw, for those who rated this below, when the recipe asks for a pie shell, it's just the metal frame, not the "pie crust" so the reason you think it tastes funny is because you didn't read the recipe correctly. There isn't supposed to be a "pie crust", it's just the "pie shell" so that the spaghetti pasta can crisp up and make the "crust" itself. This is something I grew up with and love this recipe!! Thanks for bringing it back!! :-DD

Different. Still yummy...originally was going to make spaghetti (didn't really have a taste for-lol) but ran across this recipe to switch it up a little.  It was good I still had some ricotta cheese and didn't really know what to do with it.

I made this last night. I think the only thing I changed was that I omitted the ricotta. It probably would've added to the pie, but I didn't have any.   It was tasty, and I enjoyed eating it. But it wasn't spectacular and the time it took to make (while not overly long, longer than normal for me) means I probably won't make it again. I do think this would be a great recipe if you had kids though.

This recipe was a hit, even with the picky eaters.  I wouldn't take out the pie crust, it added just the right touch to the meal.  This was great with a blue cheese/almond salad with raspberry vinaigrette.

This is so easy and tasty.  My husband is very picky and only likes a few things, but he loved this pie.  I made it without the crust, and it still retained a pie shape after cutting.  Will make this again very soon

Made it without the pie crust (just spaghetti, parm, egg white and some additional garlic powder) and added a small bag of baby spinach (steamed, drained, squeezed and chopped)to the ricotta. Great use of leftover spaghetti and sauce.  Just like lasagna, only easier. Will make it again!

I skipped the pie crust by accident.  I just assumed the spaghetti and egg white would be crust enough.  It was and it a great, simple dinner.  Family loved it.

This is really good!  I left out the pie crust, used all egg whites and cottage cheese instead of ricotta and the yolk and  it was delicious!!  I also added some salt, pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the pasta.  I used leftover meatballs and sauce and just chopped up the meatballs.

This was a great change from regular spaghetti. I personally enjoy this WITH the  pie shell. I did only use two of the three cheeses since that was all I had on hand, and it turned out wonderfully just the same.

This was a hit in my home. I omitted the pie crust, and mixed the ricotta mixture with the spaghetti. I did not have any groud beef, so I cut up some frozen turkey meatballs and used that instead. Leftovers tasted great. Will definitely make again.

Just made this recipe today...very very good...I have added romano cheese to the recipe and also omitted the pie shell, but it is (still eating it) very delicious!  Will definitely make it again, maybe next time try it with the pie shell.

Although a throughly enjoyable meal, even with the vegatarian substutions that I made, the recipe itself was a bit confusing and there seemed to be a need for more garlic and rosemary flavoring.

Hmm, not sure about this one. The filling was basically what anyone might use for lasagne, manicotti, cannelloni etc. I really don't think the pie crust lent anything to the meal other than extra calories. So, I'm giving this 4 stars because it did at least taste good (I used my homemade meat sauce for pasta - I refuse to buy store-bought pasta sauces). I would recommend to anyone to a) forget the pie crust and b) use the recipe to make lasagne instead.

This is a simple and easy recipe that I have served to many guests. It is wonderful. If you want to make a larger quanity you can just double the recipe and place in a 13x9 cassarole dish.

This recipe tasted great but would be quite time consuming as written.  I had the ricotta mixture and some browned sausage leftover from making calzones so it was very easy for me. If I had to make the meat sauce and boil spaghetti I probably would have just eaten that and skipped the whole pie thing.  Nice for a change from that, though, and the three cheeses made for a tasty, rich meal.

This recipe is amazing. Everyone loved it! The only issue I had was that the pie crust didn't totally cook during the allotted time, I might try baking it a little beforehand next time. But the recipe didn't really say if the pie crust should be baked beforehand or not

Very tasty recipe. I had to make a couple changes as my ingredients available were limited. Firstly I had no pie crust to use but the spaghetti alone holds together so it didn't matter. Also didn't have ground beef so I used a meaty marinara sauce. It was very quick to prepare and very tasty.

Really good base recipe, I have used this as my kick off for spaghetti pie many times.  Add meatballs, oregano, parsley, alfredo sauce, pepperoni, etc, etc.  I cook it in a cheese cake pan, you can really pile up the ingredients with this method.

I think what I am reading is lack of seasoning except for the pasta sauce. I make my own because I like it better, less expen s I've & far less chemicals.

I also added a layer of fresh spinach between the cheese layer & meat layer. I also agree with losing the pie shell. Just use a deposit display pie pan & you are set.

This is delicious, but as many said, you don't need the pie crust. I omitted it, to save time and calories, and baked this in a greased pie plate. I also put it on a baking sheet so if it ran over, my oven would stay clean. I only had an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, so I seasoned it with Italian seasoning, and it was plenty of sauce. I like this recipe better than the one in my cookbook. It is economical, and delicious.

I omitted the pie crust, and used spaghetti squash instead of pasta.  I also added 1/4 cup of red wine to the tomato sauce (used 1 cup of that), and ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Came out great, and was much healthier!

My family loved this recipe! I did substitute ground turkey and turkey sausage for the beef. Also added onion, garlic and Italian Seasoning when cooking the meat. The next time, I will add some spaghetti squash to the spaghetti, and perhaps some spinach!

I couldn't find ricotta cheese at the local supermarket, so I substituted it with cottage cheese. Well, it was still incredibly delicious. Of course, I didn't use a pie shell. I topped it up with chili flakes cause my Indian family just won't enjoy any meal without a good dose of spice.

Love it! Unique dish to bring to a party. Reheats well. We love the pie crust as a special treat - not sure why everyone wants to take it out.
