What can I say, it is the same version that we all know how to make. Nothing really new. The fat content is quite high but tastes good. Any salsa will do and you you can add your own veggies as I have done. Shredded carrots for picky children, and zuchini will never be detected in this dish. Add mild salsa for less spicyness. Put a bottle of hot sauce for those who like a kick. I have tried this same recipe with a combination of different cheeses like Jelapino cheese, ranch flavoured cheddar, and mozzerela(sp). All really good. I have also for something different to this basic recipe have used flavoured tortillas. Good stand by! Only 4 stars because it is a stand by recipe.

This is one of my favorite snacks to make for the family. To make this less messy from skillet to plate, you can always serve the salsa on the side either on it's own or mix it with the sour cream for a quick "dip". This is also really good with leftover Salsa Chicken and a layer of refried beans.

I used a little less salsa and wish I had used even less than I did. Other than that, great flavor and super easy to make! HUGE hit with our 2yr old.

Very simple and easy, but has great flavor. Change the salsa and change the flavor.

Loved it. It was quick and not as messy as some of you said it was. I did use a sweet corn salsa instead of regular salsa. Great recipe!
