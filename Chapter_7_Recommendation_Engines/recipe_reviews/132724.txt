This recipe made fantastic tablet the first time round (followed instructions but cooked for 30mins and used the cream rather than milk). Second time round it didnt set but I didnt stir it until cooled and used milk... so the secret is not to cut corners!

I am an experienced candy-maker, and I followed the recipe exactly but the candy did not set and now I have a big pan of sweet mush. Will not be attempting this again.

Having made this recipe a few times, I've finally figured out the best way to make this... ADD 2T LIGHT CORN SYRUP.  I've compared this recipe to similar SBT recipes and i think adding in the corn syrup is key to preventing sugar crystalization.

Here's what i do: in a 5qt pot add all the ingredients + 2T corn syrup and set to medium.  Let dissolve/melt together before stirring constantly, around 170 degrees, then start stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.  Once it comes to a boil, reduce to medium low heat (as I'm impatient) and constantly stir until closer to 240 degrees.  Turn off + remove from heat; instead of beating vigorously by hand, i plugged in my hand mixer and beat on low for 3min (temperature wise it was around 210 after 3min.)  With my foil lined with Pam sheet pan, I poured the whole mixture + scrapped the sides.  The mixture setup perfectly and had a smoother texture...vs the gritty texture I've experienced in the past.  So delicious... Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious!  A good friend of mine from Scotland brought some of her mom's tablet back to the US, and this is totally on par with her mom's.  

I didn't have a candy thermometer, so I just cooked the mixture for 40 minutes while stirring with a wooden spoon.  Then I cooled the mixture while stirring with a whisk for 5 minutes.  I didn't wait until the mixture began to feel grainy.  I just stopped whisking once it reached the consistency of brownie batter.  It set perfectly and has a smooth, glossy finish and a knife literally glides through the firm tablet just like butter.  The texture  is smooth and velvety, and absolutely to die for!

I used whole milk, as I didn't have cream.  I also didn't have unsalted butter, so I used regular, lightly salted butter and omitted the salt in the recipe.  Perfect!

I also found I had to boil for longer than 20mins, 28 / 30 and then beat for approx 5mins before getting the 'grit'.  Hubby says its the best tablet i've made and my granddaughter is still stealing it from the tub.  I was tryin out recipes for my sisters wedding, she's a scot getting married in England and wants to give a small piece as a favour.  This is the one that reminds us of being kids and the one we're going to use.  thanks

Great taste o Scotland. Boil a little longer though and use a 'spurtle' to mix 'like a wooden spoon without the spoon end' or use the Handle of the spoon. Don't use a metal whisk.   P.S Dont eat too much you will get sick.

I used a candy  thermometer & it took forever to reach 235-240Â° almost 40 mins.  Used another's suggestion with using wisk while on the stove and hand mixer afterwards, which worked well.  

This tastes a lot like the sugary (a little grainy) Canadian Maple candy. It was good, my husband LOVES it.

Im Puerto Rican, and This is very close to the Dulce De Leche I grew up eating, & taste like the ones we buy in bodegas... Came out perfect , set up perfectly...I cut the recipe in half and also added a tablespoon of Trimoline which is an Invert Sugar.. Not readily available I happen to keep it on hand because I'm a pastry chef... You can use Light Corn Syrup instead this prevents crystallization , acts as a preservative and gives a better mouth feel to the tablet.... It also adds to the caramelization ... Which will bring your temperature higher thus cooking faster so use it and you won't have the issues other reviewers are having getting up to temperature I reached the temperature in 16 minutes 
It makes a big difference... Use 2 tablespoons of invert sugar for the full recipe .... I also used my hand mixer & beat it for 3 min to cool off ... I was done making this in less than 30 min ..... It set up perfectly ..... Only suggestion is less butter to taste more like dulce de Leche. Hope this review helps others.

Super-easy to make.  I have made it twice already.  My family devoured the first batch so I made it again and doubled the recipe.

I made this following the recipe; except I didn't have a candy thermometer so I took a guess and boiled and stirred for about 25 minutes.  It didn't work!  By the next day it had still not set up, so I scraped it all back into the pot, added a shot of maple syrup, about 1/4 cup, ( I figured I had nothing to lose) and boiled again for about 20 minutes.  It turned out fantastic!  I will be making this again.

Close but not quite perfect. I returned from Scotland 5 days ago and the 4 or 5 different makers I tasted while there varied some but all had a more caramel flavor than this...not strong but just a tiny bit. I made this exactly as written and now think I needed to cook it just a few degrees hotter, again, just a tiny bit.  Next time I intend to replace half of the white sugar with either brown or turbinado trying to get that flavor. In spite of these critiques, this is tasty, easy and well worth your time and ingredients. If it doesn't set up for you, recook a few degrees hotter and try beating it more.  Read some old fashioned fudge ( non marshmallow ) recipes for more hints because it is the same basic principal.

After reading the reviews, I decided to make half the recipe just in case I was unsuccessful. I eliminated the salt and vanilla (personal preference). I boiled the mixture vigorously on med heat for 2-3 minutes before reducing the heat to low and continued to cook for about 25 minutes. At that point, the mixture thickened and became a nice tan color.  Off the heat, I beat it with a wooden spoon until it cooled and was the consistency of thick batter.  I cut the tablet this morning and it came out great!  I will present it to my best friend from Scotland to get the real verdict, but I am sure he will be pleased, as this is much better than the packaged stuff I brought back for him from Scotland.  Either way, I consider this a great success!!!  Thanks for posting!

You must add 1TB of corn syrup or invert sugar to prevent crystallization to the pot while cooking.
You need not to stir while waiting to reach 240 degrees.
You must take to 240 degrees. Or it will not set.
You need to pour into a kitchen aid mixer w/ paddle attachment. Then add vanilla if you like.
Mix on medium to high speed. Until you see it change from glossy to opaque. 
*please be careful w/ this hot mixture at all times.
Yes it can burn you if you get it on your skin.
I am a pastry chef and they will not give you this information due to the liability factor.
Then pour into a lined sheet pan w/ parchment & pan spray.. be patient and let it cure :)

Mine didn't set up - was I supposed to cut and separate the pieces to "dry" them out? It seems that when I break a row apart and cut it and let it sit uncovered it does "set up". Is it supposed to be so gritty? Has a super great taste though - I've about made myself sick on it! :) I will try again and maybe beat it a bit longer after removing from heat. A super tasting recipe! Thanks!

Tastes just like tablet should.
Helpful hint - double the amount of vanilla to give it a rich, creamy taste

Made this for a Burns Night party. Used whole milk, and the vanilla, took about 25 minutes before taking it off the heat, low temp during cook was a simmer effectively. Cooked to 236F and used a quick read Cooper digital thermometer to doublecheck the candy thermometer which was 3 degrees off in the cooler direction. Another 10-15 min to cool before pour. I used a nonstick saucepan and had virtually no crystals, poured at about 160F. Scored it at 100F in nonstick pan. Samples from bowl leftovers were quite good!

It tastes REALLY GOOD! I made it for my class, but the only problem is that it didn't set right and so it's basically a big Tupperware dish full of a highly viscous caramel tasting substance...

I followed this recipe completely and it didn't set at all. 
I tried again but this time I made some changes...
Used 1/4cup  butter, 1 cup milk and 4 cups of sugar. Bring to boil and simmer for 10minutes. Then add the can of condensed milk bring back to a boil for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and beat for 25minutes until thick. I used a whisk for the whole process stirring constantly. It's been sitting for almost an hour and it's already setting nicely.

Holy Cow! This was amazingly delicious! 
This certainly wasn't the easiest recipe I have ever made, but it was worth it. It took me forever to stir it to get it up to temperature, much longer than the description. I ended up turning the temperature up.  It also took me forever to get it to cool down to the grainy stage. It stuck a little in my pan. I think I will use parchment paper next time.
When my arm recovers I believe will make this again.

The final product was very soft and would not set. I would recommend anyone attempting this to cook much longer than specified. (until a caramel colour)

This is delicious.  The only problem I had was with the pan size.  It didn't even come close to covering to the edges of the 13X18 pan and its not even 1/4" thick.  I think a 9X13 pan would probably be the correct size for about 1/2" thick candy.

I used half and half (because it was on hand) and cooked it for about 20 minutes till it was soft ball by the cold water method and it set up perfectly.  I also took someone else's suggestion to add invert sugar in the form of a tbsp of corn syrup.

The first two times I tried this recipe, it would NOT set!  I read the reviews, and tried re-boiling my second batch, and, once it reached a rich caramel color (think toffee apple!), I beat it with my electric hand mixer until the mixture lost its gloss **Do not try to "feel" for grit with a spoon or worse, a finger.  Once the mixture has lost its gloss completely, it's gritty.**

On my third try (once I was able to recognize what it SHOULD look like) I made successful fudge!!!  I can't wait to give this as gifts for Christmas :D

This recipe is DELICIOUS. It's super easy to make, too, but i changed the ingredient amounts (decreased the sugar)...still tastes delicious. Yummy to smell when it's cooking, too
