If there was a better rating than five stars I would certainly give it to this recipe.  It was a total hit here and my mom told me that it was the best thing I'd ever cooked, & she wants me to make it often now.  The only changes I made: I added an extra tablespoon of ground cashews, and also I added the curry at the beginning and cooked it with the onion to bring out more of the spicy taste (I was told this is how traditional Indian cooking is done).  All in all this was a simply delicious meal and it tasted exactly like something I would expect to find in an Indian restaurant.  The ingredients are simple yet the taste is extremely flavorful and just a tad sweet.  The only negative thing I have to say is, the ten minutes the recipe gives you to cook the potatoes is simply ridiculous.  I had to leave them for about half-an-hour and even then they were very firm (but not raw).  Also, make sure you stir a lot because the stuff tends to stick a little to the bottom at first.  Next time (I'm going to make this often!), I'll cook the potatoes a little before-hand, and I'll also add cauliflower.

Delicious. Korma usually doesn't have cream or tomato sauce in it. Try coconut milk instead. Better if you use garam masala, turmeric and cardamon instead of prepared curry powder. This is good for those who eat chicken. Just add some cooked cubes of it to the recipe. Use yukon gold potatoes cut in a dice, and they will get done in the alloted time. A great meal for families or for guests.

I made this for dinner the other night for my husband and I, and it really was amazing.  We couldn't stop raving about it, and the whole time it was cooking I kept hearing my husband say, "Man, that smells good!"  Very easy to make and delicious.  I used 1 15-oz can coconut milk (still kept the tomato sauce) instead of the heavy cream as many reviewers suggested.  I also added about 1 1/2 cups cauliflower florets and that was a really nice addition.  And instead of just curry powder I used 3 1/2 tsp curry powder, 2 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1 1/4 tsp turmeric, 3/4 tsp ground cardamom, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg, and a dash of ground cloves.  SO much better and more authentic than curry powder.   The only problem I had with this recipe was that the potatoes took much longer than written to cook and become tender.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes, which was recommended by one user, but that didn't seem to make a difference.   Finally I decided to add the coconut milk earlier than written to see if more liquid would help the potatoes cook faster, and that is definitely what did it.  Once I added that, the potatoes cooked up in no time and I was able to add the rest of the ingredients and finish the recipe.  Served with rice and naan.  We will DEFINITELY be making this again and again, as we really like to eat vegetarian at least once or twice a week and are always looking for new recipes to add to our collection.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Delicious! I made this twice, and prefer to omit the tomato sauce and put in some yogurt instead. Tastes more like from the restaurant that way. I also play with the spices, adding a bit of cinnamon, turmeric, garam masala, and cardamom.

A great korma. Just as good as our favorite Indian restaurant makes, and not as heavy. I used only 1 large potatoe, and a whole can of light coconut milk rather than cream and tomato sauce. I also used a little less curry and added a teaspoon of garam masala. YumYum.

Good starting point.  Like many others found it needed more seasoning.  I added about 4 cardamon pods, 1 tsp cumin, upped the curry to 2tbs instead of the 1.5tbs, and added a few sprinkles of cinammon. Also, doubled the garlic amount.  Didn't use the bell peppers, instead used cauliflower and added fish.  So yummy but even better next day.  Seriously as good as restaraunt if not better....

Excellent recipe! My husband and 22 month old loved it! I made a few modifications as well: coconut milk insead of cream and a few extras like spinach and garbanzo beans and it was a definite hit! Can't wait to try the left-overs....

I've mad ethis many times. Try adding a little coconut milk it balances the spice a bit. Also DON'T use sweet potatoes, the consistency didn't work well nor the flavor. I like to add turmeric as well to give it a little more oomph. Definitely a keeper!

This was very good once I upped the amount of curry and added garam marsala and fresh ground pepper. At the end, I still felt like it was missing something, so I added a pinch of brown sugar and it was just the right touch to compliment the curry flavor! Will definitely make again.

This dish is absolutely delicious and satisfying! The recipe turned out wonderfully. I followed it pretty exactly, only, because I wanted something without dairy in it, I used coconut milk instead of the heavy cream, I used finely chopped almonds instead of cashews, and I used 1 less potato than called for, as the potato I had was pretty sizeable. I think adding another potato would have been way too much! Otherwise, a superb entree that tastes heavenly and exotic next to jasmine rice. Yum yum! If you try this with the heavy cream and like it, I suggest making it again sometime with the coconut milk. The flavor is distinct and rich.

Yum! I confess I read many of the reviews and altered the recipe some, but I stuck as close to it as I could.

First, I doubled the recipe, except I kept the potatoes at 2, and added a medium-sized head of cauliflower (cut into bite-size pieces). 

My other changes: I cut the onions in half and thinly sliced each, then sauteed them in about 2 tbsp. olive oil for 40 minutes — to the point of caramelizing (I wanted the sweetness). Taking a cue from another reviewer (who recommended canned potatoes), I peeled the 2 potatoes and 8 carrots and cut them into bite-sized pieces, then steamed them until they were nearly done. Instead of the tomato sauce, I used 2 cans of no-sodium diced tomatoes (juice removed). I didn't have a jalapeno pepper, so I used cayenne pepper (worked just fine). I used a little over 4 tbsp. curry powder, plus 1 tsp. garam masala, 1 tbsp. tumeric, and 1 tsp. powdered cardamom. I also added cilantro while it was cooking rather than as a garnish. I also used 2 cans of light coconut milk plus 1 c. water. 

Other than sauteeing the onions and steaming the potatoes and carrots, I didn't pay much attention to the order I followed in adding ingredients... I more or less tossed it all together and then let it simmer for 45 minutes or so.

I served it with brown rice, but I'd have preferred brown basmati rice... I'll save that for next time.

Thanks for posting!

really, extremely delicious. easy to prepare. it took a little longer than expected (because maybe i used the wrong potatoes, and those took a while getting tender) and i didn't add any extra salt.  really made the curry powder (home-made) come alive.

This was delicious! I used a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce instead of a 4 ounce can. I put in a whole can of coconut milk instead of heavy cream. I didn't put in any potatoes, instead I added some cubed tofu. I also didn't add the jalapeno. This was such a flavorful Indian dish that tasted pretty close to a really good Indian resturaunt. I served it with basmati rice and homemade naan. Putting in cashews was such a nice touch. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Yakuta, you are phenomenal!  I loved this recipe!  We followed it with one substitution (diluted tomato paste in place of the tomato sauce) and it was delicious!  I highly recommend this recipe, no alterations.  We served it over "Indian-Style Rice with Cashews, Raisins and Turmeric" with Naan and "Mango Lassi II."  Delicious!

Well I'm brown so my expectations may not have been realistic for this recipe. I made it as originally written with some spice modifications the first time and the favors were pretty bland for what I'd expect from a korma. Still the base recipe is a GREAT starting point if one adds liquid with the starch so the potatoes cook properly. The second time I more than doubled the spices (cumin, garam masala, turmeric powders), bay leaf, small cinnamon sticks, garlic, ginger and sautéed all to release flavor as first step even before the onions - I remember my grandma cooking this way. Skipped dairy and used tomatoes to create the curry - I guess this is North Indian flavoring. I referenced the chicken korma recipes for inspiration too. And then at the end I heated the cardamom pods in a dry sauce pan to release the flavor and added five or six pods to the korma. Next time ill try with fish when I having an "animal protein day", which I do once a week. Pretty much any hearty veggie can be added to this recipe for a yummy dish. Thanks!

Still not totally the same as our local Indian buffet, but certainly tasty.  Maybe the type of curry powder makes a difference?  I made a dairy free version by using coconut milk instead of the cream.  Had to add liquid to get the potatoes cooked, and it took a lot longer than the recipe said (then again, more time for spices to mingle).  Might try this again with different curry.

I am Bangladeshi and I cook mostly curries.  To cut down on cooking time you can do the following:-use frozen vegetables, -microwave boil fresh vegetables while cooking the onions cook, -use canned vegetables(especially potatoes)

This was great! I had planned on using coconut milk instead of cream but had none in the cupboard at the crucial moment, so added some yoghurt & milk in desperation & it was still tasty. I added some garam masala, which is a must & a little turmeric & cardamon. My potatoes took a lot longer to cook through than stated.

Steamed the carrots and potatoes beforehand. Used 8 oz can tomato sauce. Subbed coconut milk for heavy cream. So good!  Will make again and again!

Mmm I liked this!!  My Indian friends' mothers all mix curry in earlier in their recipes, so I added it with the onion to the skillet.  I also replaced the heavy cream with coconut milk.  Everyone enjoyed- thanks!! :)

Great recipe, added more spices (1tbsp garam masala, 2tsp cumin and extra curry powder for a double batch).  Added a little water to help cook potatoes but it still took longer than the recipe called for.

meatless meals are a tough sell in our house.  but this got sighs of satisfaction all around.  basic recipe is sound and it can be tweaked (spice level and additional ingredients) with no worries.  plain yogurt instead of heavy cream was just the ticket and cauliflower added rounded out dish.  will  make this for next party or potluck.

This was good.
We used coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  I thought it was better after we added some diced tomato.  Thanks for the good base recipe!

LOVE this dish!  you can make it less fat buy using coconut milk and make sure you dice the potatoes pretty small so they cook properly in the allotted time.

I made this dish minus the cashews and jalapeno. According to Madhur Jaffrey (very renowned Indian chef) Jalapenos should never be used in Indian cooking so I used canned green chili's  and it was delicious. I omitted the cashews as a personal preference.

Just finished eating this and all I can say is WOW! Easy to make and forgiving of a couple missing ingredients (jalapeño & cashews). I could eat this once a week. The spices are perfect. I had to sub in coconut milk as I had no cream in the house. I added the curry with the onions and the aroma was heavenly. I think this would also be great with some chicken added to it, but it is great without it. Make sure to finely dice the potatoes and they will be tender when everything else is ready. I served this over brown rice. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe. My husband is still raving about it.

Very good.  I used 1/2 cup coconut milk and 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt in place of the heavy cream.

Delicious! I too had problems with the potatoes getting done but maybe a smaller dice would have solved the problem.  Will definitely make again and may cook my potatoes a few minutes in the microwave first before adding.

My husband and I both love to eat Indian food, but it never tastes really authentic when we make it at home. This dish was just about as close as we could get! We made no changes to the recipe, and it turned out DELICIOUS. We will definitely be making this again, but next time we may substitute half and half for the heavy cream to save on some calories.

Absolutely delicious especially the next day.  I used coconut milk in place of cream and only one jalapeño pepper.  It was not too hot for the kids.

This was an easy and absolutely delicious recipe! I substituted the whole milk for half a can of thick coconut milk and as others suggested used a mixture of turmeric, cumin, brown sugar, curry seasoning, cayenne and salt to flavor. I didn't have any jalapenos or cashews, so omitted these. Grating the fresh ginger made a huge differance rather than using dry.

I left the skins on the potatos to save time and threw them in a pot to boil while sautéing the onion, carrot, garlic and peppers in a large skillet. I spiced the vegetable mixture while it was cooking then strained the potatos and tossed them in the pan along with the coconut milk, tomato sauce and frozen peas. This method worked really well in that the potatoes were already fully cooked so the remaining vegetables retained a nice crispy texture. I was worried the entire dish would be overly mushy but all the vegetables were perfect. I let the pan simmer for about 30 minutes and poured over brown basmati rice. Everyone loved it and wanted seconds, including my meat-loving husband.

Thanks!

I made only a few little changes along the way - I used a little tomato sauce, but not as much as it calls for.  I used light cream to make it a little healthier.  I increased the cashews a bit, and adjusted spices along the way, adding cumin, cardamom, turmeric, etc, as one review suggested.  Next time I'll pay more attention to those ratios!  It was excellent, and my friend who "doesn't like Indian food" has begged me to make it again soon!

Proceed making this recipe with caution. After reading many other reviews, I decided to give this a try as it is usually one of my favorites in an Indian restaurant. I cook a lot of curries, but have never tried this one. Based on other opinions, I upped the spices - added garam masala and some turmeric; I also added extra garlic. I did add the spices to the cooked onions in the style I was taught to make curries, where you cook the spices for a bit. I found that I needed to add water twice to adequately cook the potatoes and carrots. In the end, even with the added spices, it was very bland. Visually, it looked correct, but lacked basic flavor. Perhaps tomorrow the flavors will be better once they've married overnight. The best part of the meal was the garlic naan I paired it with.

One of my favorite vegetarian dishes! I have read many reviews and made a few adjustments of my own. First, I don't do the tomato sauce. If it's summer and I have a fresh garden tomato, I will add it- if not, I really don't miss it in this dish. Second, I do not use heavy cream. Instead, I use one can of lite coconut milk from Trader Joe's. It makes it creamy and is a tad healthier for you! Lastly, I don't always have cashews on hand so what I have been doing is adding one can of drained chickpeas. My husband and daughter (2 years) love this meal. My husband is not vegetarian but still enjoys this over rice as a meal. I serve over rice with steamed broccoli and sometimes naan and hummus :)

OMG - I'm addicted to this recipe now! I made a batch Sunday and another batch last night. It's SO GOOD. I served it with basmati rice. 
I did add more curry powder (cooked it with the onions to bring out the flavor) and I added a teaspoon of garam masala. This is an amazing dish - thank you so much for the recipe!

I thought this was really good, but I did add about 3 tbsp of Patek's Mild Curry Paste just to give it a little more flavor.  Did as some reviewers recommended and used the coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  Really good and makes fabulous leftovers!

I'm not sure why I ignored the fact that the only spice in this 'indian' dish is curry powder and decided to make it as is, but the result is accordingly bland. I suggest you don't bother with the original and follow other's advice and make your own spice combinations. Personally i'd leave out the curry powder altogether. 1 tsp of Garam Masala, Coriander, Cumin, and Turmeric would probably be good.

I really changed this up, so really the 5 stars are a reflection of my changes. Added more curry powder, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, bay leaves and tumeric sauteed with onion. Also used yogurt and coconut milk instead of heavy cream, for a healthier dish and threw in chopped spinach and a dash of sugar at the end. Delish over jasmine rice.

This is a great recipe and I love to make it! I think it's a little too much potato, maybe I will cut it down next time. The potatoes also take at least 30 min to cook. I have made it with heavy cream before, but cut down to half and half this time to cut down the calories. I think it was even better!

Would give five stars, but I made some changes -- followed other reviewers' suggestions and used garam masala instead of curry powder, coconut milk instead of heavy cream, and omitted the tomato sauce (also omitted peas, but that's because I forgot to buy them at the store, haha). Tastes like it's from a restaurant!! Made enough for dinner and lunch for the next three days... so excited for these leftovers!

I have been using this recipe for years.  I tried another a few weeks ago and was sorry I did!  This is really yummy.  If I don't have heavy cream I'll use milk, coconut milk, or no milk at all and it's still wonderful.

Wonderful veggie dish! I would only make a couple comments: I had the potato cut in 1/4 - 1/2 inch cubes and the carrots cut into small bits. Even so, the first 10 minutes didn't soften them much (on med-high heat!). I went 15 minutes and they were crisp-tender. 

Next time, I'll microwave them for a few minutes to get them partly softened before mixing them with the onions and spices.

Also, I added an extra 1/2 cup heavy cream to provide more liquid. 

Overall, a fantastic dish that we'll use over and over!

My husband and I were blown away by how closely this resembled what we get in Indian restaurants.  As one reader suggested and it turned out to be true, note that the carrots and potatoes need longer to cook through than 10 minutes, so you might want to cook those separate and then add them in.  FANTASTIC.

I made this recipe as per the instructions and myself and my 2 young boys found it absolutely delicious! I am wondering what people did about the can of tomato sauce. The cans of tomato sauce here in Canada are 14 ounces, but in this recipe it states: 1 (4 ounce) can tomato sauce. Not sure if the 4 ounces is a typo or if cans are smaller where the recipe's creator lives, but I decided to just use about 1/4 of my can and it came out great. I wonder if all the people who commented that they didn't like the tomato sauce used a full 14 oz can? Curious!

Absolutely delicious!  Like others suggested, I used coconut milk instead of cream and I bumped up the spices by adding a little turmeric, cumin and cinnamon to the curry.  I also zapped my carrots and potatoes in the microwave for 5 minutes before adding them in - there is no way that the potatoes would have been done otherwise.  Other than those few changes, I made the recipe as is.  Will definitely be making again.

Great tasting and colorful presentation. Made as written except for moderating the amount of salt (1/2 teaspoon rather than 2 teaspoons) as each serving has a high level of sodium. Otherwise, the seasoning was perfect. Vast majority of reviewers have commented that cooking time for potatoes is way off, and that is true. This is a definite make again dish. Next time cook the potatoes for about 15 minutes in advance, and the carrots 5-10 minutes, and then follow the recipe’s directions as written. May want to make other versions by subbing coconut milk for heavy cream, and/or adding chicken. A wonderful recipe, YAKUTA.

This was the first time I tried this kind of recipe and I loved it! I made some modifications to it that I think made it tastier. I replaced heavy cream with light coconut milk and used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned. I also would blanch the potatoes and carrots prior to putting them in for cooking, as they were a little bit on the crunchy side. But the flavor was delicious! I will definitely make this again.

My Indian husband loved this dish!  I used 1 green chili instead of the jalapeno.  I also left out the bell peppers b/c he's not a fan of them.  I didn't have any heavy cream so I googled & found that i could use 1/3 cup of butter & melt it into 3/4 cup of milk & wisk.  It must have worked b/c the dish was yummy!

I had to add so many ingredients that the recipe was useless.  I added Turmeric, Garam Masala, extra Curry, and Cumin to get the spice level right.  Won't make this again.

My very first attempt at Indian food! My husband LOVES Indian food and loved this. I made just a couple changes though based on previous reviews. I used a whole can of lite coconut milk in place of the tomato sauce. I added 2 tsp of Garam Masala. And, I traded the cream for 2 heaping spoonfuls of plain yogurt. OUTSTANDING!

I used coconut milk in place of the cream as other users suggested and this was awesome! Next time I will add a lot more curry powder as it wasn't very hot to me. I put the potatos and carrots in with the onion to get a head start on cooking, and also sliced them pretty thin to help cut back on cooking time. Delicious vegetarian recipe!

Excellent, I love cooking indian food and this was my husband's favorite.  I did change it based on other reviewers.  I cooked the potatoes ahead a little and would like to do that with the carrots.  I added extra garam, coriander with the onion.  I used coconut milk instead of tomato sauce and yogurt instead of cream.

This was a great and hearty recipe. I used coconut milk and it was wonderful. I would use a little less tomatos next time to help cut down on the acidic taste. My international friends I cooked this for couldn't get enough!

My first Allrecipe that I simply didn't enjoy making or eating.   Followed it verbatim, except for using oil instead of ghee, and substituted using light coconut milk instead of heavy creme.  Noted that the mixture dried too quickly in the first step cooking the diced potatoes/carrots etc, stuck to my ss pan, and then started to burn.   Transferred all to another stainless steel pan to finish the recipe.  Potatoes were the biggest downfall, and I used a fine dice like the video shows.  Taste wasn't spicy enough, and everything was rather bland.  I'm disappointed and probably won't even reheat the leftovers tomorrow for lunch.

I agree with others who said the recipe as written is bland. I added nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon and sugar. I also used coconut milk instead of cream. Also, the smaller you dice the potatoes is the quicker it cooks. The dish turned out good. It tasted like restaurant quality. This is my first time making this kind of food so this recipe is a good start.

After one bite, hubby said, "You should keep this recipe."  Subbed light coconut milk for cream, didn't have peas, added chicken, garbanzo beans and celery.  Also added garam marsala and cumin.  Very good!

Great dish. I substituted a can of coconut milk for the heavy cream as suggested by others, and let everything simmer for a much longer time. I also used a different combination of spices as outlined in Spirited Sarah's review. My fiancé's Indian family loved it, to my great relief.

This was tasty and easy to make, but it definitely needed more spice. We used half heavy cream, and half coconut milk, and that worked out nicely. For the leftovers I doubled the curry, and added cardamom and garam masala. We'll definitely make it again!

This was tasty. I had to make two changes; forgot carrots at the store, so no carrots, and used a whole green pepper but no red. Didn't specify potatoes, so I used two regular baking potatoes and two red potatoes. I do not think 1 1/2 T of curry powder is enough spice for this dish. Somehow I felt it needed something. However it's quite easy to make, thanks for sharing the recipe!

I've put this into my monthly rotation of cooking for about 4 months and it's always satisfied :) A few tweaks: To make vegan, I went away from the suggestion of coconut milk and instead added 2c Soy Creamer from Trader Joes, no addition of salt (tomato sauce had enough for me), upped the curry to 2 Tsp, upped the # of garlic cloves to 6, and added 1 Tsp of Garam Masala. Served over coconut basmati rice. Excellent, forgiving recipe :) thank you!

This is definitely a keeper. As suggested by others, I par boiled the potatoes and carrots and then added them to the onions and sautéed them a bit before adding everything else. Increased the curry by another tablespoon and used coconut milk instead of heavy cream which was the best suggestion.  If making it for myself instead of company I would add a little cauliflower and a sprinkle of red pepper. Thanks for all the good suggestions.

Wonderful, flavorful veggie dish! Even my hubby who likes meat in such dishes commented on how good it was (although when asked he said he would not eat as complete supper, but as a side)! I served it as my niece's meal since she is a vegetarian and the rest of use were having grilled chicken. Only two changes, I added 1 cooked cubed sweet potato and substituted coconut milk inplace of the cream. Excellent dish! Next time will double sauce or 1/2 again as much as not enough as is.

I would definitely make this again.Even my somewhat picky husband liked it.  I used Almond milk instead of cream but I like the suggestion to use coconut milk.  I will try that next time!!

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I did different was use a can of evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and cook the potatoes ahead of time.  Next time I will try coconut milk.

This is AMAZING!!! I love the curry with the vegetables. I made this for my father in law and husband and they absolutely loved it. However, i opted out of the high calories so I used half a cup of heavy cream just for creaminess and the other half I used coconut milk which gave it an amazing kick!!!!

Really good. I used coconut milk as suggested. I also used coconut oil. I would add chicken next time, or serve as a side dish the next day with pork, could be good. Next time I think I will add diced apple too and see what happens. Oh, and this will take you way longer than 55 min, with all the peeling and chopping, and cooking potatoes till tender.

I think this was a pretty good base for a indian dish but timing was a little off. Potatoes and carrots were hard. Other than that, I still gave it 4 stars because the sauce tasted nice.

fantastic flavor, potatoes and carrots took forever (maybe boil them a bit next time or start sauteeing earlier) needs more spice-cayenne worked well without changing the flavor

I have tried several curry recipes, and this was the best one so far. I only made a few changes. I used 2 tbsp. curry powder, 1 potato (finely chopped), added a can of chickpeas and used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. I will Be making this one again!

This is indeed a delicious recipe. A couple things: I found "tomato sauce" was vague. At least in Canada, we don't have "tomato sauce" unless it's pre-spiced and salted pasta sauce, so I got a 5oz can of tomato paste and mixed it with 1/2 cup water, and that worked fine.
As some others have said, I found I had to pre-cook the potatoes slightly. I baked them in the microwave for 1-1/2 mins per side and that seemed to work good, although they were still just a tiny bit al dente after the meal was finished cooking. I also found I didn't have any curry powder left, so I substituted Epicure Curry Dip Mix, and it worked like a charm.
For those with nut allergies, I left the cashews out and it still tasted great.

Overall, a delicious and versatile recipe which we will definitely be making again!

2/12/18- Updated this for the instant pot. On sauté mode, placed the carrot, potatoes, garlic and half the onion in the pot and got to browning. Once browned, I added the tomatoe sauce and placed tompressure cook for 5 minutes. (got the burn mode- so I added 1 C water). 
Quick release the steam, added the rest of the ingredients (subbed coconut milk for the cream) and pressure cooked for 3 minutes. Came out AWESOME!


***2/3/14The flavor was really good but I was unhappy with the recipe instructions. I microwaved the carrot and potato to partially cook them and cooked the recipe as instructed. The carrots  still were too hard and there wasn't enough liquid to cook the carrot or potato with out adding a bit of water. If I didn't partially cook them I am not sure how they'd soften.  I also subbed coconut milk for the cream. I loved the flavor.    I'd make it again but cook the potato and carrot  a bit longer.

I followed the recipe and was really disappointed with the flavor and the lack of sauce.  The dish ended up dry and fairly bland in terms of taste.  It was spicy enough but lacked flavor.

This was pretty darn good.  I love Indian food, and this replicates it pretty well with staples from your pantry.  I made this for a friend who is vegetarian, and her husband cannot have dairy, so I was looking for an easy vegan curry recipe.  This worked out great!  I doubled the recipe, and subbed a can of coconut milk for the cream.  Even the man liked it, and he's not into adventurous eating. I'll definitely make this again.

Good recipe recipe. Excellent with some tweaks. I found it a little underspiced and underseasoned (but this is of course a matter of taste). 

Tweaks: 
1) I added an extra 1/2 tsp each of ground cumin, tumeric and coriander. 
2) I added 1 tbsp brown sugar
3) I used light coconut milk instead of cream.
4) I added a little extra water during the cooking
5) I kept roughly the same amount of "stuff" but omitted potatoes. I used carrot, peppers, frozen green and yellow french beans and canned instead of frozen peas. I think you could used pretty much any veggie you fancy, really - I would like to try cauliflower next time. 

Healthy, flavourful, delicious!! 

I served it with brown basmati and grilled chicken.

very good, and had the approval of 3 guests of Indian origins.  I didn't have Tomato sauce so substituted with Tomato Paste.  Used Coconut Milk and the heavy cream.  I added the cream about an hour before serving to temper the jalapeno heat. Had no cashews but took another reviewer's suggestion of using slivered almonds. Used only green pepper as I had no red.  Added extra cauliflower.  All this goes to say that it's a very adaptable recipe.  
I served this as an Easter dinner with ham, homemade sourdough French bread, aloo tikki (brought by a guest), and broccoli - a real fusion of east and west.  I have to say this makes a lot.  Gave away lots to departing guests, and still have lots for leftovers for today and tomorrow and....

Loved this.  Flavorful, healthy, delicious.  Subbed coconut milk (light), left out the jalapenos for the sake of the kids, and used ground ginger instead of fresh (it's what I had).  The cashews and cilantro totally make it!

This came out really well - enjoyed by both hubby and me. I did make a few changes. I added about 2 cups of chopped cauliflower, 2 chopped tomatoes and increased the frozen peas to two cups. Also, instead of cream I used soy milk which may have made this a bit thinner in consistency. I made this 1 1/2 hours before serving. After stir frying the onion, garlic and peppers, I added the rest of the vegetables (raw) with the tomato sauce and let simmer, adding the milk, cashews (chopped) and peas about 1/2 hour before serving. I served it on basmati rice.

This has become my "go to" curry recipe because it is such a good basic recipe that can be changed up according to one's taste and what ingredients are on hand.  The only permanent change I always make is to use 1 can of light coconut milk in place of the 1 cup of heavy cream.  It is good with or without the jalepeno.  I sometimes add a can of drained and rinsed chickpeas and a tsp. of garam masala.  I usually need to add a little more salt and some black pepper.  Also, instead of the ground cashews, I sometimes us tahini....or about a 1/4 cup chopped, toasted cashews as a garnish on top.  Serve with jasmine rice.  Yummy!

This was easy and good.  Instead of cooking it per the directions, I just threw all of the ingredients into my small slow cooker and voila! I added garam masala and used half & half instead of heavy cream (only because I forgot to buy the cream!).  I think if I made it again I might use coconut milk.  Also, I used crushed almonds instead of cashews.

I did add boneless chicken thighs to this thinking my vegetable-hating daughter wouldn't eat it. My entire family loved it, so I think I could have left off the meat and they wouldn't have noticed.

Super-duper!  But, I made some changes based on the reviews here.  Pre-boiled the potatoes for 10 mins and it should have been 15.  Added tsp Gram Marsala & 1/2 tsp of tumeric and a cup of cauliflower.  Used 1 can of coconut milk in place of the cream 
and a small can of peas.  Mixed most of a bunch of cilantro with the milk reserved the rest for garnish.  Served over Jasmin rice.  Wowza!

This recipe was bland and a bit on the bitter side - I think because of the excessive amount of curry powder.  The second batch of veggies also took a lot longer than 10 minutes to cook.  However, this would be a 5 star recipe for me if you make a simple change:  omit the curry powder entirely, add 1 t. ground cardamom and 2 t. garam marsala.  Oh!  And use sour cream instead of cream.  (It adds the tangy taste that was missing)  This makes this recipe sooooooo good!  Will use this recipe as a base from now on with my alterations.

This was very easy to make, and it was absolutely delicious. It was a hit with my husband, and even my mom liked it. I served it over brown rice. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was continually adding broth (you could use chicken or veggie) while the potatoes were cooking to keep the veggies moist in the pan. I will make this as often as I possibly can. Another bonus is that it helps use up vegetables in your fridge. Good potluck dish, I'd imagine.

Absolutely fantastic. We paired this with leftover lime-and-curry marinated, coconut-coated chicken from the night before. Instead of heavy cream we used a 5% vegetable-oil based coconut and lime food cream, which was even better than plain cream would've been. Finally we added a couple whole cardamoms (make sure to take them out before eating!!) and a bit of Turkish yogurt that needed using up. All in all it was a very filling dinner and the leftovers were just as good.

This was pretty good...tasted like restaurant quality. Using another suggestion, I added cardamom, cinnamon, garam masala, and some tumeric. My only complaint was that it took way longer than 20 minutes to get the potatoes to soften up. This might also be very good using 1/2 sweet potatoes and 1/2 white potatoes.

Finally, a version of korma we loved!  Took all the hotness out (we have toddlers), and added 1 tsp garam masala.  We used butternut squash instead of potatoes.  Lovely.

This was very good! My only changes: coconut milk instead of cream; cooked potatoes a little longer in a bit more water; no curry, but used garam masala and tumeric instead, about a teaspoon each, and added a generous handful of chopped fresh cilantro right before serving. mmmmm... delicious! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Wonderful vegetarian meal, in short.  As some other reviews suggested I used yogurt (used fage greek yogurt to add protein) rather then heavy cream and it added the perfect flavor to this dish.  Also, rather then a pre-made curry powder I used garam Marsala, turmeric and a dash of cinnamon as the spice mix and it made for a well balanced dish.

This recipe was delicious, rich flavors and vibrant colors!  I substituted light coconut milk for the heavy cream and initially only put in a cup,  but ended up using the entire can.  Despite cutting the potatoes into small chunks,  they took close to 30 minutes to soften.  Next time I'll parboiling the potatoes first.  I also tossed in some frozen spinach.  This dish could also be healthier with less starchy veggies - next time I'll use only 1 potato and 1 carrot and add cauliflower, more spinach, mushrooms and the entire red & green peppers,  maybe even some cube tofu.  The sauce is fantastic as is!

This was delicious.  My kids and husband loved it, even though they are super american boring food lovers.  I personally would add more jalepenos or something more spicy (for me, not the rest of the family).  Perfect, and I will cook again soon.

The whole family liked it, even the kids. Only changes I made were to add a bit more curry, coconut milk instead of heavy cream, and a pinch of brown sugar. I added the curry in with the onions. Next time will use Yukon golds to cut cooking time (cooked quite awhile). Served over rice, going to get naan next time. Will definitely make this again!

This was quite good and easy to make.  It wasn't spicy enough for me, so when I make it again (which I definitely will!) I will use more curry powder and garlic.  I also did make the substitution of coconut milk for heavy cream since I'm trying to cut dairy intake.  Very tasty.

This is really good. I will definitely include it in my regular rotation. Only changes: used half and half instead of heavy cream (still very good) and pre-cooked the potatoes. Highly recommend!

Using other reviewers advice I pre-cooked the potatoes and carrots. Next time I will steam all the veggies ahead of time as they remained failry crisp.  I also added cauliflower and broccoli so I needed more tomato sauce mixture which meant I also needed more spice than what's called for.  I was hesitant to use all coconut milk thinking I might miss the creaminess so I used 1/2 c coconut milk and 1/2 c. half and half.  Next time I will definitely use all coconut milk.  Also added cayenne pepper as we like it spicy.  It turned out nice and wet so it went well with basmati rice.  Didn't have naan so I heated butter and garlic in a pan and cooked pita until crispy and hot.  Was delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

I steamed the potatoes and carrots together... very quick and set them aside to add later.  Added cauliflower and substituted with coconut milk. Used 3 1/2 t. curry, 2 1/2 t. cumin, 1 1/4 tumeric, 1/4 cinnamon, 1/4 cayenne, 1/8 t. nutmeg, and a small dash of cloves.  I also added the spiced in the beginning.  Served with cottage cheese! So wonderful :)  Thank you for the recipe and all the great reviews to work from.

What a delicious and hearty vegetarian meal. This recipe did need a few changes. 2 T oil. I had to use 1/4 tsp ground ginger - did not have fresh. Up the garlic to 6 cloves. I omitted the jalapeno, don't like the taste. Doubled the ground cashews. 2 1/2 tsp salt. The curry powder/salt should be thrown in with the oil for a minute FIRST and THEN mix in the onions. Also, the potatoes and carrots MUST be boiled beforehand for around 10 minutes at least, otherwise they will be crunchy. I kind of threw in however many veggies I wanted but tried to stick to the original measurements. I didn't have any cilantro but I thought it was great without any on a bed of rice. I will definitely make this again!

This was not awesome. Edible, but only with major additions... I would probably have tossed it without adding garam masala, cinnamin, tumeric, more ginger, apinch of sugar, and way more heat!  It could have been my curry powder though, some blends are better than others. I'll keep looking for my "go to" curry recipe. Hope you like it more than me! It does smell amazing as it cooks though.

This was really great. I had to move it to a bigger pan - a big pot, really - and let the veggies go longer until they were tender enough, but the seasonings were great. Substitute coconut milk and it's vegan.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time. I've made it quite a bit of times and it comes out perfect every time. I substitute the heavy cream for coconut milk. I lessen the amount of peas and add okra and spinach. Also, I've discovered that small red potatoes cook faster than any large potato :)

This was good!  I did make a few changes to the spices, but that wasn't a huge deal.  Specifically, I added an extra 1/2 tbs. of curry, 1 tbs. masala garam, a pinch of cinnamon, a pinch of cardamom, and about a teaspoon of brown sugar.  

All of those spices helped balance the overall flavor.  Also, I added about 1/2 cup of milk and used coconut milk instead of cream.  Delicious!

I made this recipe for my vegetarian friends because you can feed alot and it doesn't cost alot.  Very authentic tasting!
I used what I had on hand, so I used green peppers, mushrooms, onions, and peas. Swapped the cashews for sliced almonds and the cream for coconut milk.
Remember that mushrooms cook quickly so add them towards the end.

Also~ whenever I make curry, I add chopped fresh mint  and loose leaf tea to the rice while its cooking... AMAZING!

This is soooo good, I make it pretty often. But, cook the taters first and throw em in at the end. Also, I never use heavy cream- why fatty up such a good vegetable dish? I prefer about a half cup of coconut milk, seems more *right*

Cook time was WAY off and it needed water to cook the potatoes but an hour and a half later I had an incredible dinner!  Oh and I added 1tsp. of Gram Marsala.  This is going to be one of my new Fav!!!!

Really really good!! I made for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used low fat coconut milk in place of cream and added in garbanzo beans for protein. I also made the naan, amazing!!!

Good way to get your veggies.  You can use really any combination of veggies.  To make this healthier, use plain yogurt or canned evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.  The type of curry that you use, really changes the taste of the dish.  I do the onions in the food processor so they are really small and use whole canned tomatoes then pulse those in the food processor.

Very tasty, and easy recipe to follow.  I substituted sour cream mixed with light cream since I didn't have any heavy cream on hand.  I used Newman's Own shocking tomato sauce so I omitted other heat.

I used this recipe as a base for what I would call "Hillbilly Korma." I did not have most of these ingredients and spices in my kitchen so here is what I used: Half a large onion, diced 1.5 tablespoons curry powder 4 to 6 ounces of Basil and Tomato spaghetti sauce 1 can of mixed vegetables A heavy cream substitute using milk, cooking spray (I had no butter), and few pinches of flour which I heated to mix and thicken a bit while cooking the first part.  I used the spaghetti sauce because I noticed it had many of the spices already (besides ginger).  I think the mixed veggies were a good idea because it reduced the cooking time.  I served this atop white rice.  It was a little bland (which other recipes had said) but was easily fixed with a little salt and pepper.  I actually really enjoyed this recipe and will probably make it again.  It still tasted pretty authentic despite all the substitutes.

Oh my.....this was delicious!  I doubled the ginger and useddried red chiles since I didn't have a jalapeno pepper.  Awesome!!  The cooking time was much longer than the recipe calls for, but well worth the wait.  Yummmm.....

This is absolutely delicious! After 3 disasterous attempts at making Indian food, I gave up much to the dissapointment of my boyfriend and my dad. I didn't try again until this recipe, and it brought me back! I was sloppy with the spices, as I felt it needed more, and I added red pepper flakes and cayenne, just for warmth. This is a keeper!

Excellent! I did make some changes, simply to make the recipe more to my personal taste. For instance, I replaced the peas with chickpeas and added some diced tomatoes. This is one of the best recipes I have ever tried. However, it is very rich!

Really wonderful flavor--used ground almonds in place of cashews.  Added fresh cauliflower.  Next time I'll pre-cook the carrots.  Used evap milk in place of the cream to cut down calories.  Great recipe.

Super yummy and easy! I served over rice. Here are the changes that I made (not because they were necessary to make the dish better, just because it's what I had on hand!):  - no jalapeno  - 8 oz tomato sauce  - 1 red bell pepper  - no green bell pepper  - 1 cup sour cream instead of heavy cream  - no cilantro

Delicious!  I've made this many times and always exactly as written.  Absolutely wonderful.  I have never needed to pre-cook the carrots or potatoes, and it always comes out just fine.  We use a coffee grinder to grind the cashews and that has worked perfectly.  Wonderful with basmati and naan!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I made it with half and half rather than whole cream and it was still amazing!  I think I'll try it with coconut milk or even plain yogurt some time to see how it turns out.    My husband's comment was that it was better than our favorite Indian restaurant's korma.   A new family favorite!

Awesome.  I used a can of coconut milk instead of heavy cream, as others did, and also added a teaspoon of garam masala.  I think it is a tad salty and will reduce that next time, but it was great as is.

Will definitely make again... I followed advice of others and boiled the carrots and potatoes ahead of time, and I'm glad I did...also substituted coconut milk for cream and tomato sauce, another good idea to make it less heavy. It was missing something, but we could not define what... next time I will play with the spices a bit... overall a great recipe and happy to have found it

Delicious.  Easy.  I substituted cauliflower for the potatoes (we were already having a dish with potatoes as well), and added a pinch of cayenne to kick it up a little.  It was just great.  A keeper.

I changed this so much, I'm not sure it's the same anymore. I used the lite coconut milk and yogurt, since most Indian food would not be made with heay cream. I've never seen any authentic food in India made with heavy cream, but there is always an exception. I won't use curry powder. It's not the same. Instead, I used some prepared Garham Masala (cheater), a little tumeric, some dark brown sugar, about a table spoon, and some cinnamon, just a touch. It came out beautifully. I also doubled all ingrediants for the liquid, since Korma, as another reviewer said, is supposed to be fairly soupy.

Very good! Followed a few previous suggestions, and used coconut milk, only one medium potato, but added some cauliflower.  Didn't have cashews, so used almonds instead and decreased the curry a little, but added some garam masala. Nice complement to our Indian feast!

Very very nice! The only difference for me is that I didn't have potatoes, or the heavy cream. I did use 1pack of frozen green beans/carrots/corn, and about a cup of organic soy milk. Everything else I did the same. IT CAME OUT GREAT!! I followed the recipe with these additions, and it was creamy and spicy. I put it over brown rice with baked Chilean bass steaks.  My husband raved! Even with the changes, it came out wonderful, and the aroma..AHHH..just like a restaurant!

Wow, oh yes!  I appreciated the subtlety of the curry in this meal.  There is just enough hot flavor to impact you, but it doesn't knock you out.  We left out the frozen peas b/c my husband is not a fan of peas, but there did seem to be SOMEthing missing other than that...an ingredient neither of us could put our finger on.  We just kept remembering our korma experiences at our favorite mediterranean/Indian restaurants & it felt like a seed of some kind should be added.  Thoughts?  Even with mild spice, this was too much for my toddler, however.  Great leftovers.

Oh my world!  This was fantastic.  So simple yet tasty.  Easy enough, I think my kids at 9 & 15 could manage if I pre-diced the jalapeno.  I will admit we left it simmer over 30 minutes as I had to run, but it was still amazing and nothing was over done.  Now I'm pondering what would happen if I put this in my slow cooker...  Or used sweet potatoes and/or rutabagas.  Stay tuned.

I had to constantly worry about the potatoes and carrots burning. 30 minutes later, I finally threw my hands up and added two cups of veggie broth just so these darn potatoes would actually cook.The amounts of spices listed aren't really adequate to give the dish the full flavor it needs to be Indian food.I ended up almost tripling the amount of curry powder and adding some Garam Masala and a few other spices I had laying around.

I'm one of those people who are guilty of always tweaking recipes. I used 7 spice, cumin, turmeric and fresh oregano to give more flavor and since we have a tomato allergy I used heavy whipping cream instead of tomato and doubled the amount and instead of the heavy cream I used plain yogurt. I also added palm hearts. The end result was a delicious dish even my hard to please husband loved.

This recipe will surely be in regular rotation. The only thing I did differently was use coconut milk instead of heavy cream. Delicious!

I made the recipe as specified but used coconut milk in place of cream.  

It was bland so I added 2 T plain greek yogurt for some tang, 1 Tbsp coriander powder, 1 Tbsp cumin powder, 1 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp garam masala, 1/4 tsp cayenne, & a couple of pinches of dried fenugreek leaves. 

I will make this modified version again and again!  Yum!

I omitted the tomato sauce and the heavy cream and substituted a can of coconut milk instead.  I also doubled the seasoning.  I cooked the diced potatoes almost completely before adding them, and added half a head of cauliflower as well.  Really good and made for a nice change of pace for dinner.

Amazing! I used one large sweet potato instead of regular potatoes since it was what I happened to have on hand and the flavor and consistency were perfect! On the advice of other reviewers I did add cauliflower and cumin, and I also subbed cayenne pepper for the jalapeno. Also, I ended up using the entire red and green bell peppers instead of just half, because you can't have too much good stuff in there! Next time I make this, I think I will use coconut milk instead of cream to make it vegan. Definitely a wonderful dish that I will be making again.

This was great. The only things I did different was used 3 jalapenos, half and half instead of heavy cream, and added another 2 ounces of tomato sauce and 1/2 cup of half and half at the end because I like a bit more sauce. Will be making again.

Made this a few times now and took the advice of others, used coconut milk in place of whipping cream, used butternut squash and turnip instead of potatoes, kept carrots in. I also used a full can of tomato sauce and coconut milk due to more veggies. I love this dish!

We doubled the sauce using milk in place of heavy whipping cream for the second cup, and added some extras broccoli, chic peas & the whole pepper instead of half, but that's about it.  It could use a little more of the curry, but maybe we had an old can with less flavor. Overall excellent and will definitely make again.

Made as directed but with light cream. Found it to be very mild and creamy, but a bit lacking in texture and flavor.

I made this for a bunch of vegetarians in my family and they all loved it! Be sure to do all the chopping of veggies in advance because cooking time goes fast and you'll want to have everything prepped and ready to go. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Next time I'm going to try it with coconut milk instead of cream for my vegan niece. Has anyone tried that yet?

I loved this! So aromatic and tasty, and filling enough that your meat-eaters won't even miss the meat :) I'm not a fan of jalapeño so I substituted dried red chilies for a similar kick.

Used garam masala, Sam tiny dash of cinnamon and a nice amount of turmeric rather than curry powder. Added those spices to the veggie mix with ginger and garlic till aromatic, for about 5 mins. Then added the remaining ingredients. Instead of heavy cream I used 1/2 and 1/2 to save some calories but still have a silky creamy sauce. This dish is perfect!

Just wonderful! I agree with cooking the potatoes at least 30mins! I didn't add the tomato sauce but added a can of coconut milk like previously suggested. OMG was this good!! I also added garam Marsala and extra curry1 tbsp because I like it spicier. I also simmered mine for an extra 20mins.Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I read a lot of reviews before making. I followed the directions for the most part but did use coconut milk and added a lot more spices as some of the reviewers suggested.  I always thought I didn't like Indian food but this dish made me realize that I do!

We love Indian food and while I am not a novice cook, I wanted something fairly quick and easy but healthy too. Like others, I used coconut milk vs. cream. Also added garam masala and turmeric and threw in some cayenne because we like it spicy. Delicious recipe!

an easy, delicious dish that hits the spot for Indian flavors.  you can mix and match veggies (I like cauliflower, potatoes, carrots, peas, peppers and chick pea, but you could use any combination) and if you chop everything the night before you can make it for a weeknight dinner.  btw, I have made this many times and have never put in jalepeno or cachews.  tastes great without them and easier.

Cooked this exactly as written except cooked the potato and carrot first, so they would get done as some folks complained about this.  It was really an amazing dish.  The prep time for this recipe is way off though.  This recipe took me quite a bit longer than it says to chop all the vegetable, but was certainly worth the effort in the end.

It's a good base but needs way more seasoning. I ended up tripling the curry powder, using coconut milk instead of cream and tomato sauce and used only 2 tablespoons of cream to help thicken the juices.

I did like this, but like everyone else said, don't use cream, use coconut milk.  Also, up the spices.  Next time I will probably even add more coconut milk so that there a good amount of sauce to soak into the rice.  I was in a hurry, so I did precook the potatoes in the microwave a bit.

Made this for my family
My husband and I gave five stars
the kids at four. They are 9 and 7 and the dish is a little spicy. Easily fixed by leaving out the jalapeño or adding some plain yogurt for them.

I substituted hot sauce for the habenero and used half and half. Delicious. Although the potato seemed a bit undercooked....might have been the cooks fault though.

I'm of South Indian origin and korma is a common dish, albeit a somewhat difficult one. This recipe provides a nice version, which is a mix between sambar and real korma. Used yogurt instead of cream and added dried coconut as well as coconut milk.

wow I love this!! I followed recipe with a few changes, as other reviewers said, I left out the tomato sauce and cream using instead coconut milk. Also left out the cilantro since I dislike it. I used a cup of broken cashews since I like their texture. My son traveled India a while and said it tastes authentic

Wonderful.  Only thing is, when I was trying to cook the potatoes and carrots it was too dry.  I added some chicken broth and all was absolutely delicious. I feel very encouraged to try more Indian recipees here!

Excellent!  My husband, a somewhat snobby eater, almost ate the whole pan!   Not too heavy, but filling. Changes I made...while cooking initial ingredients:  I added water in order to keep the tomato sauce from sticking to the pan.   I also added a shredded chicken breast both times and it was a perfect all-in-one meal.  Tried with both brown and white rice and prefer the white.    This is staying in my menu planning rotation, for certain!

Fantastic!  Humble suggestion... Leave some cashews as a garnish at the end.  It will add a good crunch.

I followed this recipe the first time as-is, and found that I needed to add either more tomato sauce or water so that everything didn't stick.  It was pretty good the first time, but I have since followed other people suggestions, including adding garam masala/cinnamon, taking out the tomato sauce and instead adding a can of coconut milk (using full-fat coconut milk i drain the watery liquid into the pan at the beginning and add the fatty part at the same time that the cream is added.  I have also found that the cashews take a bit too much time and have ommitted them.

I think I used too much curry, but it was so good I couldn't stop eating it, even when my eyes were tearing up. I used plain yogurt instead of tomato sauce and coconut milk instead of heavy cream and it was beyond delicious.

This was pretty good. I made a lot of changes based on what I had in the house and the preferences of those I was serving. I used a can of coconut milk and a couple of medium fresh tomatoes instead of the cream and tomato sauce. Left out the jalapeno, cashews, peas, and peppers but added a can of chickpeas and some green beans. Many reviewers mentioned that their potatoes took longer to cook but I found that red potatoes (cut into small cubes) cooked pretty quickly.

LOVED this recipe!  Love Indian food, never tried to cook it until now.  This recipe was very easy. I took others suggestions and used lite coconut milk instead of cream and added a teaspoon of garam masala to the mixture.  Turned out wonderful, even better on the second day!  Thanks for a great recipe.

A great tasty and easy recipe.  I substituted coconut milk and didn't have curry so I used garam masala and it came out great.  Leftovers are even better.

Really great recipe. Took the advice of user Spirited Sara, but also added half-and-half when it seemed too spicy for my family (didn't measure cayenne).   Also added rotisserie chicken breast at the same time as peas. Perfect!!! Turned out better than our favorite Indian restaurant. Will make over and over again.

This was too bland for me and I did add extra curry powder.  As one reviewer suggested, I used coconut milk and it helped I think.  Cream would have made it more bland.  Sorry.

I just made this yesterday, my first Indian dish for my fiance, who's from Dehli. The look on his face when he walked into the house and the aroma hit him was something I wish I had a camera for. He told me the taste is very authentic,and he took some of this with him to work for lunch. The recipe was modified this way: coconut milk instead of heavy cream, and added garam masala and turmeric to other spices recommended. I also made it with some coconut burfi, which paired nicely as a dessert and way easy to make. We loved it!

This recipe is very good and fairly easy to make. It took me about an hour when all said and done. It could use a little more spice, so if you are someone that prefers their korma on the spicy side, like me, consider adding more seasoning. I also altered this recipe another time by halving the tomato sauce and adding yogurt. Was much more creamy

Delicious and mild. I didn't modify recipe much. Of course, the potatoes were boiled al dente prior to adding them to the recipe. Generally, I'm one to add spices, but the mild curry powder and ground nuts combined with the sweet carrots and peas was sufficient for my taste. My boyfriend is not much for Indian food, but he enjoyed it immensely as well. I took another user's advice and added cauliflower and kale. Tomato paste was used instead of sauce. I'd add mushrooms next time I make it!

Made this last night and it was incredible! Made it with coconut milk instead of the heavy cream as suggested in the video.  I would have put in another jalapeno and more curry but as is it's delish and perfect for the kids.  Made it with baby bok choy salad and crustless spinach quish also from this site! One fab meal!!!!!

Really nice. I should have just used the coconut milk like people suggested and added the spices like cardammon. My husband added more curry powder. I used cream and coconut milk but I will skip the cream next time.

Oh this is amazing!! It takes a lot longer than 20 minutes to chop everything up, though. The potatoes also take longer to cook than it says. Also, I add quite a bit more grated ginger root and garlic than it says to.

We LOVED this one! I made it ahead of time in the slow cooker by adding everything except the cream. I set it on low for 7 hours, then added the cream at the very end, as I cooked the rice to go with it. 

We're putting this recipe in "heavy rotation." Weekly veggi korma. Yum.

I'm a novice cook, but so far so good. I've made this dish at least 3 times.  The potatoes seem to be the biggest issue in terms of achieving the perfect firmness.  So far, they have been on the firmer side (which isn't all that bad).  In lieu of the heavy cream, I used coconut milk the last time. Some of my family members are vegan, so the coconut milk  did the trick. There was little if any change in flavor.  It was also nice knowing that the coconut milk was far less fattening than the cream. I'm going to try the light coconut milk next time.  I also use a full can of the tomato sauce (8 oz) as opposed to the 4 ounce when making this. Cheers!

Excellent recipe.  I subbed coconut milk for the cream, added the curry powder along with the garlic & ginger, and increased the amount of tomato sauce a bit.  Delicious!

Great recipe!  I decided to go Vegetarian a few years ago, and I honestly have reached a bit of a plateau as far as "variety" goes. Enter "Vegetarian Korma."
This was my first time making non-Thai "curry" (know that's not technically the correct term, but I'm not entirely sure what is).  The result was so much more delicious than what I expected from such a simple recipe!  The only major alteration that I made was adding extra Tomato paste.  I mistakenly got a 15 oz can instead of a 4 oz one, and I probably used a bit more than half of the can.  
I personally have a weak tolerance for spicy food, so I was happy with the mildness of the dish.  If you want it to be spicy, you will probably need to add your own spice.  And as for "flavor" spice, I thought the dish was great.  I was skeptical of only using Curry Powder, but I ended up not needing to add any seasoning of my own.  
The only weird thing with the recipe was at the end of Step 1. I added water so the potatoes would actually cook, and so nothing would burn.  I assume that it was implied to do this?  I can't imagine the potatoes cooking properly otherwise...
Anyway, delicious recipe.  I will definitely be making it again.

A good way to use up some leftovers. Not my favorite dish (felt like it was missing something, and I don't mean meat, just something) but there's nothing to not like about it.

Way to bland! Also, veggies did not cook in specified times. To save this dish I added 1 can coconut milk, cayenne pepper, ground clove, turmeric, cinnamon, and lime juice. Cooked it down to desired consistency with lid off.

Made this for Meatless Monday exactly as directed but both hubby and I found this dish to be rather bland and tasteless. I had high hopes because it was fun to make and looked good.  But there just wasn't any taste to it.

Delicious!  I packed this with a few extras, like garbanzo beans.  Such a nice flavor, such a richness.  I made this for a dinner and everyone had great things to say!

Im something of a country girl, so the peas, potatoes, carrots and peppers made this more of a comfort food with an exotic flair.  I did use a can of coconut milk instead of the cream, and cooked cubed chicken breast with the onion.  I started light with the seasonings and kept adding until it was to my liking.  Quick, easy one pot meal that was delicious.

Excellent Recipe! Thank you Chef Yakuta and to all the other members that added details of their mods! I added more curry powder and cumin and gara masala. Definitely do pre-boil the potatoes and carrots! I did 15mins like one person suggested but even that wasn't enough for the potatoes! Lite Coconut Milk still added a very good flavour! Thanks again!

Westernized Korma (traditional middle eastern & Indian recipe), generally good but very heavy so you couldn't eat very much :D, I've tried two times more curry with one tea spoon cumin and cinnamon and make it more spicy, now I'm eating it and the taste is excellent but definitely next time I will use full fat milk instead of cream :)

Like others, I made a couple changes. Used coconut milk instead of cream, added a little more onion, used Yukon Gold potatoes (though they definitely needed to cook longer than 10 minutes (more around 25-30)) and added the cardamom pods too.  Delicious.

Next time, though, I'll likely add some red pepper to add some additional heat, the jalapenos just didn't really give it the heat it needed.

My brother was in for his first visit in three years and he loves Indian, Chinese, and Filipino foods. I'd never tried anything like it before, but the directions were clear and simple and it came out amazing. My mom suggested that Sunday dinners at my house become a tradition afterwards. I assured her that I was happy with the tradition of going to her house for the same. LOL

Fixed it for friends last evening, it was creamy and delicious, a keeper.  After reading reviews I made a few adjustments, here's what worked (note I doubled the recipe):
•	Use can of coconut milk AND small carton of heavy cream
•	Add cardamom and cinnamon
•	A little more ginger and a little more cashews
•	Use 5 yukon potatoes
•	Cook in crock pot for about 4 - 6 hrs on high but fry onions,garlic peppers and ginger in the oil until translucent first
•	Can add diced chicken breast and cook with the onions, etc.

So close to a 5 star! 4.5 at the least. But 5 stars with slight modifications. Firstly, full-fat coconut milk substituted for cream is a must, especially since it's much more widely available now. If you've ever cooked Indian food, you'd see that right away. Secondly, I make my own curry powder so I didn't need to add more spices, but if you get store bought, you'll probably need more curry, a bit more cinnamon, and more turmeric. That's based on my past experience with store-bought curry powder, but taste and see and add on your own. And definitely saute the curry powder with the onions, careful not to burn. I would also agree with another reviewer, the potatoes should be cooked a little before everything else. 10 minutes might work for itsy, bitsy pieces, but who wants itsy, bitsy pieces of potato? I also added an extra garlic clove and extra ginger, but that's my taste and what I usually do with recipes of this sort. Haha, it looks like a lot of modifications, but really they're not far off from the basic recipe which is an excellent base. A little experimenting and a few twists to suit your own tastes, and it easily becomes full 5 star.

I was looking for a vegetarian meal for when my brother in law visits.  Everyone in my picky family loved it.  It is well worth all the chopping and dicing.  I used red curry paste instead of yellow curry.  It was very flavorful and perfect for kids but I think I will double the curry and add another jalapeno next time.

Fabulous! I substituted coconut milk for the heavy cream (I'm vegan) & I added the juice of half a lime & garbanzo beans. I also doubled the ground cashews & toasted a handfull for the top of the finished dish. Since I only eat fruits, vegetables & grains, I was looking for new recipe ideas with LOTS of flavor, and this one fits the bill! Cooking times are a litte off, but otherwise, its wonderful! Tastes quite authentic, especially with the addition of lime & coconut milk :)

Made this recipe as stated and as other reviewers have said, the potatoes either need to be parboiled or softened prior to adding to the curry mixture (and for that matter maybe the carrots as well). It also needs more liquid even though it is supposed to be a braising cooking process; I used vegetable stock, probably 3/4 cup. Overall, the flavor was great and the smell was fantastic. I think the next time I make this I might saute the red pepper with the onions. And add sliced almonds and golden raisins to the mix as that is how our local restaurant does it. Thank you Yakuta for sharing this recipe!

I would make this again as a side dish. As I was making it, I just could not imagine serving potatoes on rice...it just doesn't do it for me. So I served it with some leftover chicken & mushrooms on the side. I really enjoyed it this way and would make it again as a tasty side.

This was easy, impressive and delicious! I used one sweet potato in place of the 2 potatoes and the texture was perfect. I think 2 potatoes would have been too much. Also, I forgot the red and green peppers but it was amazing without them. Thank you, this is on the list for a family regular! Good enough for company fare.

This was a delicious dish!  I tripled the recipe to feed a large group of friends, some of whom were vegetarian and some were not. EVERYONE loved the dish! I did add the light coconut milk like others has suggested and I also added it early to help cook the potatoes.  I also traded the green peas for edamame to boost the protein!  Yum!!

I doubled the curry powder and used an 8oz can of tomato sauce. I also used coconut milk instead of cream. Next time I will add more red bell pepper (b/c I like it!) and maybe another jalapeno pepper. YUM!

I did the same thing as several other members:  I substituted coconut milk and fat free yogurt for the heavy cream.  I also added spinach to the recipe and omitted the cashews.  It was yummy!  Will definitely make again soon!!

I loved this recipe.  I've tried alot of packaged and jarred korma and it's never that good.  I feel like this is the closest to what I would get at my local Indian restaurant.

Very good basic korma recipe, and if you have access to high-quality curry powder, it's even better.  I made mine with chicken, which I sauteed with the onions. I used cauliflower instead of bell peppers, and subbed fat-free evaporated milk for the heavy cream to reduce the fat.  I microwaved the potatoes for 2-3 minutes, but I don't think it was necessary because I cut them small enough that they would have cooked in the time allotted.

This recipe is a good start to a tasty dish! I agree with many of the other commentors: increasing the amount of curry and garlic and adding garam masala gave this korma more flavor. However, the real secret is to add a bit of brown sugar! It gives more body to the korma while bringing out the other spices.  Thanks, Yakuta!

My friend took me out for Indian food the other day.  It was the first time I had ever had it.  I immediately jumped on here and found this recipe.  I took some advise from others and doubled the tomato and used a full can of coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  This turned out better that I could have hoped for.  I love this and plan on making it again.

This was amazing!  Who said vegetables were boring.  Great taste, great presentation.  Got rave reviews.  Everyone wants me to keep this recipe and make it again soon.  I added chick peas.  Served with Garlic Naan.  This is a must try.

Excellent recipe but agree with others who recommended upping the spice. Also, you need to soften the potatoes and carrots before. They won’t cook in reasonable time otherwise

This was fantastic! A keeper for sure.  As other reviewers have suggested, next time, I will make it with coconut milk instead of heavy cream and cut the potatoes smaller to reduce cooking time.  Outstanding dish!

This is our favorite meal!  I use coconut milk just because I can keep it on hand.  My 4 year old requests this!  I prefer to eat it with naan, but we love it with rice or by itself!

Yummy! Used a can of Light Coconut milk instead of the heavy cream as other users had suggested.  Easy to prepare and easy to customize.  We used chicken in place of potatoes for a non-vegetarian version.  Thank you for posting!

Unfortunately I found this recipe quite bland despite increasing the spices. My folks however, who do not eat Indian cuisine, really enjoyed. Am still seeking some good vegetarian Indian dishes for which I can abort local reataurants to enjoy at home.

Great recipe and dish! What i will do different: (1) prep the ingredients in advance (2) boil potatoes and carrots ahead of time so that they are soft (3) use less jalapeno to mellow spicyness (4) add fresh tomatoes to the dish when it is served over rice.  This original recipe was a hit.

Absolutely wonderful for a good, vegetarian Indian meal!  I make the amendments others suggested and used a 15 oz can of coconut milk in place of the cream and also added that earlier in the recipe so that the potatoes had more liquid to cook in.  I would cut back on the salt just a tad next time, but that would be the only thing I would change.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This recipe is awesome!  I also added some tofu, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  I love the slow heat, and this satisfied the Indian craving I've been having.  Also, many Indian recipes call for ingredients I'd have to drive an hour or more to find (I live in a pretty rural area), but I had no problem getting them.

Healthy, flavorful, and easily adapted to varying tastes. Very easy to assemble/cook: prep the ingredients to have them ready, and avoid the undercooked potato issue by dicing and boiling with carrot chunks before adding to the skillet. I took a couple of suggestions and mixed them: no heavy cream; I used a can of coconut milk plus about 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and let those cook w/veggies into a thickened sauce. I used some diced jarred jalepenos (raw ones are hard to handle) and added enough spices to get it started....curry & s/p available when serving. Served with EASY tzaktizi sauce from this site (or just use some sour cream!).

I've tried several recipes for Indian cuisine, and this is the first one that actually met my expectations. I stayed pretty close to the recipe, except I added a few more spices and used light rather than heavy cream.  I used yukon gold potatoes, diced, and they were perfect.  Cant wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.  Will make this again.

This was delicious!  I did have trouble getting the potatoes cooked enough...I ended up adding quite a bit of water for them to cook in, which happily did not ruin the consistency or flavor at the end.  Also used half and half instead of cream and it was plenty rich.  Will definitely make again.

Wish I could rate it a 4.5. It was very good.  Kinda a lot of shopping and prep work, but good flavor.  I definitely had to cook it for longer than the recipe called.  My peppers, were still pretty raw after 10 minutes.

Very good recipe, overall. My only complaint is that the potatoes did take absolutely forever to cook, and the carrots as well. Next time I will pre-cook the carrots and potatoes until almost done before adding them in. But otherwise, this was great. Thanks!

I make this dish all the time now and love it.  I boil the potatoes some before I put it in so that the cook time isn't so long (the 10 minutes suggested is more of a dream than reality) and add broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and yellow squash and it's excellent.

I had to do several substitutions because my pantry wasn't quite up to the whole recipe.  I used pine nuts instead of cashews and cocunut milk as was suggested because I have a dairy allergy.  But I have to say, it was FABULOUS!!!!  I will be making this one again.

Really good!  I omitted the onion and garlic (intolerant) and accidentally added 6oz of tomato paste instead of sauce.  It was still wonderful!

This is so quick and easy as written. I do take a little extra time to make sure everything is tender.  I saute the onion with the curry and some extra Indian spices.  I add cauliflower and chickpeas (I used northern white beans when I don't have the other on hand).  I also use coconut milk and no tomato sauce or cream.  I have used fresh tomatoes.  I have tried other Korma recipes out there and I keep coming back to this one. For sure use yukon potatoes for quickness. Definitely a favorite!

I am generally not a fan of Indian cuisine, but I truly enjoyed this dish -- granted, I did make a few alterations. Just due to personal preference, I swapped out potatoes and carrots for cauliflower and cubed extra firm tofu, which I lightly browned in a skillet, set aside and added back to the mixture before simmering. Per other reviews, I used a can of coconut milk in place of heavy cream and thought it enhanced the recipe. Finally, I added a ton of cashews -- they're my favorite! **UPDATE** Made this again with everything the recipe calls for, plus cauliflower and skillet-browned firm tofu. This time, used cream instead of coconut milk (had none on hand) and it came out just as tasty. :)

My second go at this was even better than the first, and we loved it the first time. I used golden potatoes (instead of russet) and up-ed the curry powder to 2 tablespoons. I will say that 10 minutes is just not enough time to cook potatoes. I let it simmer for at least 25, closer to 30, minutes then finish off with the peppers and cream. I skip the cilantro as I'm just not a fan. And the longer you can let this sit, the better it is.

Awesome recipe, just like the restaurant! The only changes I made: added 1/2 tsp turmeric powder to the sauteing onions, steamed the veggies beforehand, and only added about half the called for ground cashews (I hate cashews). It turned out excellent, really big hit in my house, Thanks!

This is sooooo simple and delicious!  I opted out of the heavy cream and replaced it with 2% milk.  It does make a difference.  If you want a great creamy korma keep the cream or even half and half works and is barely noticeable.  I make this at least once a month, usually 3 or 4 times per month!  I serve it with mango chutney and  Kabli Naan which is naan stuffed with coconut and cherries.... yummmmm!

This dish is DELICIOUS!!! We added organic chicken since we are not vegetarian.  We used coconut milk instead of the heavy cream and tomato and we LOVED it! We didn't use the carrots or peas b/c my husband didn't want to but I think it would have tasted great with the peas, not sure about the carrots.  I added green beans and used 1/2 of the salt recommended.  It was a bit saltier than I would have preferred.  Overall this is a must-make dish!

Per some of the other reviews, I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. I omitted the jalapenos. I had to cook the potatoes much longer than the recipe said. I didn't have curry but it tasted great with a mix of other spices. There's really nothing I would add or remove from what I did - it was tender, fragrant and yummy! Very satisfying vegan dish.

I love making this ahead of time and then I just have to reheat it all week long for a healthy meal. My toddler loves to eat this with naan, too. To make the flavor more authentic, I swap out the curry powder for 1tsp cumin, 1 tsp paprika, and 2 tsp garam masala (you can get this is most grocery stores, but Indian/Pakistani stores carry it for much less). I also use garlic and ginger pastes to speed up the process. I leave out the cream and add fat free half-n-half just as it finishes cooking. It saves a ton of fat and tastes great.

Delicious!  I make this dish often for potlucks.  With Basmati rice and Naan it makes a wonderful week night meal. I add chicken to it sometimes as well. It's creamy and only a little spicy. It's easy to make too!

OMG!!! This was sooooo delicious! I love it! I cooked it in a wok, and sauteed the onions with the curry powder and salt, and I added one tsp of garam masala. I used lite coconut milk instead of cream. I used only one potato and half a head of cauliflower. Served with some rice pilaf, recipe from the food network, and some garlic lavash. So good!! As some other raters have noted, it does take much longer for the potatoes to cook.

This was good.  It wasn't spectacular, but definitely good.  I might try looking up different curry seasonings because the curry powder was pretty generic for me and just not special.  Please don't leave the cilantro out, it adds so much to the dish!

Fantastic curry. I didn't use the jalapeno pepper so that it would be mild enough for the kids to eat. I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. The coconut milk made such a great addition. I also did not use green peppers as no one likes them in my house! But the cashews were wonderful and crunchy in the curry.

Sadly, disappointed with this...  I put in more tomato sauce than called for otherwise there would not have been enough liquid for the carrots and potatoes, which by the way, should be diced pretty small.  Added garam masala to make it more flavourful and still no go for me.  Also used the coconut milk instead of cream.  Not planning on making this again.

Everyone loved this, including the picky 8 year old.  It tasted really light and fresh.  The only change we made was adding a handful of cashews to it at the end to make it more crunchy and tasty.  It was s lot of work chopping though.

I made this for my "kitchen challenged", picky vegetarian sister and she wanted the recipe! Of course I enjoyed it too, and then the leftovers later. My changes: I used coconut milk and vegetable broth instead of cream and tomato sauce. I also added cauliflower with the potatoes and carrots. So yummy!

So rich and delicious! I chickened out on the jalapeno pepper bc I was worried about burning my hands when cutting it (wuss, I know). It was still very good and very spicy without, as I used a red curry powder. Next time I'll probably go with 1 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 2 and try subbing coconut milk for the cream, as someone suggested. Oh, and it took something like 15-20 minutes to cook the potatoes to a tender point before I went ahead and added the cream, peas and peppers.

This is good.  I like the other reviewers' suggestion of replacing the cream with coconut milk, it's definitely an improvement.  I also reduce the curry powder to 1/2 T and replace the rest with a tablespoon or two of mild curry paste (available in the international aisle of most grocery stores) to reduce the heat and increase the flavor.  I also add some garam masala to taste.  The thing that makes me really enjoy this dish is adding fried cubes of paneer.  It adds a nice sweetness, and I just really love cheese.

While not the same as my favorite Veggie Korma at India Palace in Overland Park Kansas, I thought for a novice cook, this was divine.  Easy to make and tasted so close to my favorite that I was thrilled.  I made it extra spicy with hot curry and it still wasn't hot enough for me personally, but what a great way to enjoy this dish since we've moved to Ohio and good Indian restaurants seem to be in short supply.  Thank you..will be making again and again.

Simply amazing! I did reserve about half the cashews to throw in just before serving. This gave the dish an extra crunch. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I listened to other viewers for taste/health reasons and used coconut milk and instead of curry I just added a bunch of other spices (turmeric, garam masala, cinnamon, cardamon, ground ginger, cumin etc) I really really loved it and when my office-mate from India told me how good it was, that is when I was truly confident in it!  Thank you for the recipe, it gave me the courage to experiment!!  I cooked the potato in microwave for 4-5 min before hand but not the carrot, next time I will cook the carrot too but the frozen peas and fresh cauliflower cook well as is.

Lovely flavours. I changed this by making my own curry paste first from mustard seeds, garlic, ginger, cardamon, fresh chillis, coriander, curry powder and garammasala.

This recipe was WONDERFUL.  I did not have tomato sauce to I use fresh tomatoes from the garden.  Due to nut allergies I used soy nuts.    This has become one of my favorite dishes to prepare and to eat ;-)

I use half of the tomato paste and 1.5 cups cream; otherwise I end up with a very tomatoey, pink (despite extra curry and turmeric) not-quite-Indian dish. After 4 different tries, I think I've finally got it. The potatoes and carrots need to be cut into very small cubes or you end up with crunchy veggies!

This has a GREAT flavor!!  Instead of the heavy cream, I substituted 1 cup of coconut milk.  I also omitted the red and green peppers and added cauliflower.  Delicious!

This is a wonderful and flavorful dish. I found that 10 minutes wasn't long enough for the vegetables to cook so I did them longer (about 20). Other than the cooking time, I followed the recipe exactly. My non-vegetarian husband enjoyed the dish as much as I did. The most important thing when cooking with curry powder is finding one you like because the curry powder is one of the most important elements of the dish.

This was so good that I had to post it on Facebook as my status.  The only variation that I made was that I used non-fat half and half instead of the heavy cream (I'm trying to lose a few pounds!).  This was an incredibly tasty, healthy dish!

Great recipe! We crave it every couple of weeks. We never have cashews but it still turns out great. We also prefer to use an 8 oz can tomato sauce. Yummy!

I made this with my slow cooker on low while I was at work all day, and everything was cooked perfectly. I added sweet potato and cauliflower and left out the peppers (just cuz I don't like them) and the cream (my husband thought it would ruin it after seeing the result without it). It was very good served over brown rice, even my 2-year-old ate it. I thought it could have been a bit better, and next time I'll add more curry powder and perhaps a little cinnamon. Very good and versatile, though!

I substituted evaporated milk 1:1 for the heavy cream and it worked well.  I also added 1/2 a cauliflower b/c we had it laying around and that also worked .  As other reviewers mentioned, my potatoes needed more time to cook - next time I'll add them at the beginning with the onion.  Will definitely make again!

A fair recipe but needs additions.  We added spices Garam Masala, Coriander, Rogan Josh, and Cardamon 1 tsp each, and left out the cream. Replaced the tomato paste with 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, and simmered for almost an hour.  Much better, with better flavors

This was very tasty! I had to use a full 8oz can of tomato sauce or it got too dry. I also used coconut milk instead of cream and added some garam masala. Will definitely make this one again.

I enjoyed making this dish, and it tastes great, but I did make a few adjustments. I used onions, peas, cauliflower, carrots and potatoes instead of the peppers (this combination is more of what I'm used to ordering in restaurants); less jalapeno (wanted more sweet than spice); left out the cashews and used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. Also, to achieve that pretty yellow color, add turmeric powder. :) Served it with chicken tikka masala and it was a big hit!

Wow! Flavorful, filling, healthy and so authentic my BF tasted it and said, "It tastes like real Indian food!!" Hah! I cut back on the potato and wasn't going to use tomato sauce but realized it needed liquid; I added a diced tomato or two and replaced the cream with lite coconut milk. Also, I added more crushed cashews. Prep time takes quite a while but it was well worth it.

pretty good, but took a lot longer to cook than expected because of the potatoes.  I added cauliflower to mine instead of the bell peppers.  Definitely give it a LOT more time to cook the potatoes.  It helps if you add more water so it doesn't dry out.

I must admit that I have been using All Recipes website for many years and this is the first review I have written.  I felt compelled out of culinary obligation to do so being that I followed the recipe exactly (though I did toss in cauliflower and peas) and it was PHENOMENAL!  I have never recreated a dish that so closely tasted like what I get at my favorite (rather pricey) Indian restaurant.  While I enjoy the experience of dining out, I would be just as happy to cook this dish at home from now on.  Thank you SO much for sharing!!!

This dish is absolutely delicious! As suggested by other reviewers I added the curry powder with the garlic/ginger. After adding the potato/carrots, I noticed it wasn't much liquid to cook them, so I added a little water.  I only used 1 medium potato, doubled the amount of cashews, and to cut on fat I added 8 oz. of fat free plain yogurt instead of heavy cream and finally I added a can of garbanzo beans for some protein. Next time I want to add coconut milk since many other reviewers mentioned it turns even better. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

With the substitution of light coconut milk instead of tomato sauce and heavy cream, and the addition of broccoli, cauliflower and spinach (in lieu of some of the potato and carrots), I could not stop eating this!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I'm new to Indian cooking, and this was very easy and very tasty!  I've tried a few variations, such as leaving out the nuts, adding cauliflaur and even corn.  It's always great!

This one's definitely getting made again.   Next time I will up the cream to 1.5 cups. Like so many others, I subbed coconut milk for cream and found the potatoes took a long time to cook, even cubed quite small. I ended up adding a little water to the pan and covered to sort of steam the potatoes and carrots.

I absolutely love this recipe (as does my husband and he doesn't like Indian food). I have made it as stated and with a few subsititutions. Substitued red curry paste for the curry powder for a "spicier" version of this meal. Also, I always use coconut milk instead of cream.

Because of some of the comments about cooking time on the potatoes, I par-boiled them for 10 mins. while I was doing the rest of the prep work.  Good recipe!

I used peanuts rather than cashews, and a mix of plain lowfat yogurt and cottage cheese instead of the heavy cream.  This was fantastic!  I had to cook it WAY longer than the instructions.  Next time I will take the other reviewers advice and precook the carrots and potatotes.  And there will definitely be a next time - this was fantastic!

This dish was AMAZING!  After searching Allrecipes.com for a way to use up several veggies I had left in the fridge,I stumbled upon this little gem.  I substituted whole-milk yogurt instead of heavy cream to lighten up the fat/calorie content.  My husband raved about this dish - we will definately be making this one again!!!

Excellent flavor.  The timing is kind of off though, plan for 45 minutes for the potatoes and carrots to cook - or to save time, lightly steam them beforehand.  Instead of cream, I used light coconut milk and fat free half and half (in equal amounts) and it worked beautifully.

This recipe is so flavorful and delicious, I will definitely make it again. I used Lite Coconut Milk instead of cream and I used a little more than a cup because I like more sauce.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I still can't believe how good it turned out! I just started being interested in cooking maybe a week ago, so if I could pull this off, anyone can. I used coconut milk rather than cream, and added so many different veggies and tofu that I had to use 8 ounces of tomato sauce and almost 2 cans of coconut milk. I doubled or tripled all of the spices and added tumeric, cumin, garam masala, and cayanne pepper. I wish there were leftovers, but my friends and I just couldn't get enough!

I think because it smelled so fabulous as it was cooking, we went in with too high of expectations. It was good, but it felt like it was missing something (although it is probably very authentic just the way it is). I also needed to cook the potatoes longer than it said to.

Yummy! I skipped the jalopeno and used spicy curry instead, but less of it so it was not too spicy. I used more onion, garlic and carrots and kept everything else as written. I never thought Indian dishes can be so quick and easy.

This recipe turned out very delicious and was easy to make! If the vegetables are cut in advance, it's even going fairly quick and could be made while guests are over! I followed the tip of some other reviewers and added a bit of tumeric for more flavor. I also added one cup of cubed chicken and put in more curry and ginger powder. Instead of the heavy cream I used 3/4 cup of milk and 1 1/2 tsp butter, which turned out just as great! My boyfriend loved it so much, he didn't want to stop eating even when he was full! I will definitely make this recipe again! Thanks for sharing this!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I was amazed that I could make Indian food that actually tasted as good as what I eat out.  I made only one substitution, instead of heavy cream, I used blended cottage cheese.  It would be easy to adapt this recipe with different vegetables.  Next time, I will add paneer.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this for dinner tonight. My husband loves curry and he liked this a lot. He felt that there wasnt enough heat to the dish and that maybe it needs some red pepper flakes or the seeds from the jalapeno. Im not a big fan of bell peppers so I picked them out. I think celery might go good in this too. We served it with coconut rice. Very tasty vegitarian dish :)

We loved this! The reason I give it only four stars is because I really think that it needs yogurt as opposed to the cream. Next time I make this I will try it that way.

Delicious.  I multiplied everything by 6 and, after eating my fair share, ended up with 9 quart-sized bags for the freezer.  In a giant dutch oven on the stove top, it took probably 2 hours for the carrots/potatoes to soften.

This recipe was great; the flavor was the perfect blend of sweet with a little spice. I also substituted coconut milk for the heavy cream/tomato sauce, I added another jalapeño for more kick, and I sauteed some cubed tofu and threw it in at the end for a little more protein. It turned out great. It's definitely on the "Will Make Again" list.

I have made this several times now, and it's better than the restaurant version. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the potatoes and carrots MUST be at least partially boiled beforehand for this recipe to work. Also, it's easy to burn; you need to use really low heat or stir (i.e. flip) the mixture constantly. 

I prefer using coconut milk--the whole can--to cream. Also I like to add a bit of garam marsala and turmeric.

I changed the recipe to serve 8. I substituted light cream for the heavy cream. I put in half as many carrots. It was delicious. Make sure you have rice.

The reheated leftovers, although tasty, seem to lose some of their kick, so you will probably need to add some salt. 

I followed others' advice and cooked the potatoes a little before starting the recipe and finished prep and cooking within an hour.

I've started making this all the time; it's so good. I use about half an onion, substitute a half-can of chickpeas for the potatoes, one or two carrots,no jalapeno, half a can of peas, a good amount of cashews, no red pepper, and I think I'll try some celery next time. 

I also use lite coconut milk instead of heavy cream, and add some cayenne pepper to make it spicy. (Although last time I got carried away and used a whole teaspoon -- WAY too much.)

My alterations probably destroy the authenticity of the recipe, but it tastes really good!

Also nice when topped with plain yogurt.

This was my first time making Indian and I think I did pretty good. I followed my cousins advice and used coconut milk instead of cream and added garam masala on top of the 1 1/2 tablespoons of curry. I swapped the cup of peas for a cup of garbonzo beans...delish! My husband was impressed. Will make again for sure.

Didn't use cashews or jalapenos and it was delicious! The second time I replaced half the cream with milk - removing about 700 calories from the dish. It came out just as delicious but much healthier.

This wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't what I was looking for. It tasted more like a curry than a korma. I used coconut milk to make it more like what I've had in restaurants (here and in the U.K.), and I doubled the amount, because the kormas I've had have always been saucy. The flavor was missing a certain sweetness, and I think there was too much curry. It also seemed a bit too acidic for a korma--maybe reduce the tomato sauce? The veggies are a good base, but I'll look elsewhere for the sauce. Thanks, anyway.

I have never cooked Indian food before, but this recipe was easy to make and really, really yummy. I took others' suggestions and used lite coconut milk instead of heavy cream, and I think it was a great improvement. Since others also mentioned that the potatos took longer to cook, I microwaved the potatos and carrots ahead of time.

so good... this has to be one of my favorite vegetable curries. Tastes like it belongs in a very good authentic restaurant.

This recipe was amazing!!! I follwed it almost exact, just made a few minor changes, used coconut milk for a lower fat/non dairy version and added garam masala. My husband was so impressed, especially since cooking indian food was always his specialty...now it's mine ;)

really good! added califlower instead of potato. Also followed tips of additional spices and used sour cream instead of heavy cream (all I had, was going to use coconut milk but out of that too). Turned out quite good!

It was ok. Needed more seasoning also, should be creamier. Good base recipe though.

VERY GOOD. SUBBED HALF AND HALF AND YOGURT FOR THE CREAM. ADDED MORE JALAPENOS AND SOME CHOPPED TOFU. SERVED OVER BROWN RICE. YUMMY! MAKE SURE TO CHOP YOUR POTATOES PRETTY SMALL -- TOOK LONGER THAN STATED TO COOK.

This was great!!! Forgot to seed my jalapeno so was a tad to spicy.  Added more onion just cause I love them and more cream since I like a lot of sauce.  Took another reviewers suggestion and added some garam masala.  Would like to try with the coconut milk I think that would be really good.  This is not kid friendly at all unless they like spicy foods.  Will definitely make it again.

Really, really good.  I didn't have the red pepper or the cilantro but otherwise followed the directions pretty closely.  Delicious and nicely spicy.

Made as directed except used coconut milk instead of cream but did include the tomato sauce.  Very good.  You can adjust the spices as you like to get the flavor you want;  I put in a dash of cinnamon just because it gives another dimension.

Yum.  Made mostly as written.  Subbed a poblano for the jalapeno (use what ya got), coconut milk for the cream, and couldn't find peas in my freezer so used the rest of a bag of cut green beans.  Added a can of garbanzo beans too.  Meal prepped with a scoop of brown rice and I was a happy camper.  Totally forgot about the cilantro.

I winged it, because I wanted to make a big batch! 
I used.. 
1 onion, 3 tsp minced garlic instead of cloves, 2 tsp minced ginger, 2 carrots, 6 potatoes, a big can of tomato sauce plus a normal size one, 2.5 tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp chili flakes instead of a jalapeno pepper (just go easy if you do the same!), 2.5 cups of milk instead of cream, 1 red bell pepper, 1 can of peas instead of frozen, and a can of mixed veggies.
Haha it was a spicy pot full! Had it over rice and am gladly freezing some! Thank you for the recipe!

I added raisins which I had microwaved in water to rehydrate them.  I also added whole cashews and cayenne pepper because it was not spicy enough for me.

The easiest and tastiest Korma I've ever made. I added some different vegetables and precooked the potatoes, but other than that, I stuck to it pretty close.

This was tasty! It took much longer too cook the potatoes through than the instructions suggest. I'd save 4 oz more of tomato sauce to add to the mixture once the potatoes have been cooked. Also I'd use 2% milk and corn starch instead of cream to make it a bit less heavy.

Excellent with lite coconut milk. I put the onion garlic and jalapeno pepper in the mini cuisinart to finely chop and added spices to sautee. I also added a tablespoon of honey as it tasted a little bitter and added more spices as others suggested. Excellent vegetarian dish.

5 Stars!! with these changes I got from other reviewers:
Change the cream to coconut milk.
Change the seasonings to: 3 1/2 tsp curry powder, 2 1/4 teaspoons salt, 2 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 2 tsp garam masala, 1 1/4 tsp turmeric, 3/4 tsp ground cardamom, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg, 1 dash of ground cloves.
I loved it! My 20-month old loved it too!

I loved this.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add a leek instead of onion as I didn't have any onions.  I then cooked it in my electric pressure cooker on high power for 5 mins, and it was cooked to perfection.  This will definitely be a regular for me.

Absolute family favorite.  Slight modifications - I add some cauliflower, put bell peppers & cauli in with the carrots & potatoes, replace 1/2 of curry with my own spice concoction (gharam masala, ground cumin, cayenne & turmeric). Seasoned to taste.

It was delicious, though I did feel it was missing something. I cooked it as per the instructions, as a vegan alternative, I changed the heavy cream to coconut milk, since that’s what I had on deck. Next time, I’ll use coconut cream. I also upgraded the some veggies - onion to red onion and potatoes to purple potatoes. I also threw in a little cinnamon and cardamom, per one of the suggestions in the comments. I still felt there needed to be more of a salty presence to balance out the sweet and spicy flavors. I new to the plant based diet. So, I’m not certain that this “missing salt” isn’t just me craving meat. We’ll see. I’ll definitely try it again.

My 2 teens get excited whenever they see this on the weekly menu!  They are good eaters and both rank it #2 of all their fav meals(I think tacos will always be #1...LOL).  The hubby and I love it too.  It's a winning recipe for sure!  I have made it with heavy cream and half/half....we prefer the lighter half/half version. Oh...and I skip the cilantro simply because I am not a cilantro fan!

I absolutely love this recipe and have modified it to my tastes but that's because this recipe is so awesome and so easy to tweak depending on who is eating it and it's still phenomenal. okay, so. I am from MD so instead of the recipes spices, I put in 2 tsp of Old Bay, 2 tsp of garam marsala, 2 tsp of red curry, 2 tsp of regular curry or spicy hot curry (depending on who I'm cooking for) into 3 tablespoons of olive oil on median heat in a pot, everything is the sam until I add potatoes. I add a little water with the potatoes .5 cups to 1 cup and let simmer for 30 minutes and then follow the recipe and simmer with the cream until the potatoes are easy to pierce with a fork. usually 20 more minutes. I usually simmer at a much lower temp than medium once I add the potatoes and stir often to prevent burning on the bottom which adds a bitter note I don't like. I have had nothing but rave reviews!

Delicious!!!!!!   Made it for out of town guests who are vegetarian.    I did use coconut milk instead of cream since I am temporarily off dairy (the substitution was just heavenly) and added chickpeas and cauliflower to bulk it up since it was vegetarian.    I also simply microwaved the potato and carrot chunks with a dash of water, covered, in order to steam them before adding them, based on other reviewers recommendations.

   Not too spicy yet tasted like something from an Indian restaurant.  My husband is a meat-eater (as in must have meat in every meal)  and he actually really enjoyed it since it was very hearty with the potatoes, big chunks of carrot and cauliflower, etc.  He asked- “are you sure there is no meat in here?”.   But he did put in a request for me to make it again with chicken.   The flavors were creamy and smooth and just heavenly.    I wish I had time to make it all the time but this will be a treat for us for the moment since we have a baby.  My guests who love Indian food said it was delicious though they did not rave like they did when I made the Rosemary artichoke lasagna... but I on the other hand was obsessed.  My eight year old and I who were working together trying our hand at Indian for the first time high fived like three times while we were taste testing .  It’s actually addictive.   Can’t wait til next time!

This was fine, though it just tasted like generic curry. I used Yukon gold potatoes in small cubes and they cooked just fine. This is a good curry recipe, and I will likely make it again if I feel like an easy vegetarian curry, but this lacks a distinct korma flavor.

A great way to sneak in a meatless meal every once and awhile. I did substitute coconut milk and it was quickly devoured by my family. Cannot recommend more highly!

Chris loved it -- said this was the best dish I made all Ramadan! Relatively easy.  It really does NEED the fresh cilantro -- it really lifts the dish. Even the boys like it. I'm not a fan of peas, but other than that I would have loved it too.

I really like this recipe but I (and another friend who made it) always have to add water to keep it from scorching. I use an entire 8oz can of tomato sauce and the extra water makes it much saucier which makes it good to serve over jasmine rice. Just keep an eye on it and stir periodically. Add water as needed. You can add other frozen veggies too. It’s pretty easy to make this your own.

You DEFINITELY want to cook off the potatoes and carrots some before making this dish.  Not sure who came calculated 10 minutes was enough time but it is not. After 25 minutes I just added the coconut milk (as suggested by others)  and put the lid on. Took still maybe another 30 plus minutes simmer on low  for carrots and potatoes to soften up. Good flavor but I guess you can make it as spicy as you want or don't want.

The end result tasted great, but it took much longer to cook the potatoes and carrots (40 minutes instead of 10, I like them soft).  Maybe as a result of that, it was quite dry, I ended up adding twice as much tomato sauce and a whole packet of store bought korma sauce as well.  I suggest doing the cooking in a large pot instead of a skillet, it was full to the brim and kept spilling over while I was stirring it.  I also added chicken cooked with curry and garlic. Very tasty!

Thought it was great. Wanted a more healthy version, so I used coconut milk ( full fat ) instead of heavy cream and parsnips instead of potatoes. Served over quinoa. delicious !

Great recipe.  I won't enter the "authentic Indian" debate on the spices or cream.  I made it as written, and I'm really happy with it.  My potatoes were Russet, so even with microwaving them for 2-1/2 minutes first, they still took 20 minutes to cook.  I added some water along the way during that time to avoid sticking to the pan.

Really liked it!  Substituted as follows due to what I had on hand.  Added Garam Masala spice in addition to the curry, used cream of potato soup instead of the cream, used frozen peas and carrots instead of adding fresh carrots, used canned diced jalapenos instead of fresh.  Bloomed the spices while cooking the onions, cooked the potatoes with some water before adding the other ingredients.

Loved it - I doubled the sauce - used coconut milk instead of cream - added a can of pineapple tidbits - 1 chicken breast cut up and cooked it with the onion. It probably took about 30 minutes to cook in all to get the potatoes to cook. I added In Probably 2 tablespoons of Garam Masala and stirred in a handful of The cilantro.

First time making an Indian dish so I combined some suggestions from several reviews.  Boiled the potatoes & carrots until crisp tender, drained and added later when recipe instructed.  Added the curry powder with the onions from the beginning.  Upped the curry powder to 2 Tbs.  Also added 1 tsp of cumin and 1/2 tsp of turmeric.  Added an extra T. cashews.  Used 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of 4 oz.  I added the peppers with the potatoes & carrots instead of later with the cream.  Stirred often as it did tend to stick to the pan.  Omitted the peas & cilantro.  I did use the heavy cream and it turned out great, but may consider coconut milk next time as recommended by several reviews.  Used long grained wild rice because that is what I had on hand and it worked fine.  May use basmati next time.  Just decided to try vegetarianism recently and was feeling a little overwhelmed and doubtful - but this recipe gives me hope that food can be amazing without meat!

This recipe is fantastic. I make it slightly different from the recipe, just because I found the potatoes and carrots take too long to cook the way it is written. I cook the potatoes and carrots first in coconut oil and then add the onions, jalapeno and bell peppers followed by the garlic and ginger. I continue with the rest of the ingredients from there. I also use coconut milk instead of cream.

It was very dry. I added a quart of home canned tomatoes to it. I also added an extra teaspoon if salt. I would make it again with the added tomatoes.

This was wonderful.  My kiddos ate it up and asked for it for lunch the next day.  I left out the jalapeno (kid friendly) and used garam masala (instead of curry) and coconut milk (instead of cream).  Will definitely make again and again.

We love authentic Indian dishes & we really liked this one. I used 1 can of coconut milk instead of cream. As other reviewers mentioned the potato issue, I cooked the first part of the veggies in coconut milk and didn’t add the sauce til the very end. I sautéed the onions, garlic, & ginger ‘til tender, then removed them and cooked half the coconut milk whilst stirring it for about 5 min. Added back the onions, along with the carrots, potatoes, and jalapeño. Cooked for the ten minutes, added the rest of the milk, cooked another 3-5, then added the other peppers & peas. Cooked on low for about 7, then added the tomato. (I figure if it keeps beans from cooking in the crock pot....) Also subbed out some of the curry for cumin and garam masala. All in all, totally worth doing again.

To make this recipe paleo, I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil, sweet potatoes for regular and coconut milk for heavy cream. Even with these changes this dish is complex and delicious! I found that i tend to need upwards of 8-12 oz of tomato sauce in order to keep the dish saucy enough with all the veggies.

I used about three times as much fresh ginger, two times as much jalapeno. I added half of the spices right after the garlic ginger and onion to bring out their flavors. I also added a teaspoon of garam masala. I completely forgot the tomato sauce and added more cream. Came out great. I bet you could use coconut milk/cream instead as others have mentioned and it would be great as well.  I don't know if this is implied or not, but I boiled my potatoes and carrots first as I wasn't sure they would cook all the way otherwise.

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe nearly exactly, adding a bit more salt and some pepper along with more curry powder than suggested, and it turned out well enough that my roommate who doesn’t like Indian food much said that this was one of her favorite things that I’ve made! I will definitely be making this again.

This meal was pretty good.  I also used coconut milk since I had it.  It took a lot longer to cook than stated though.  after 20 minutes the potatoes and carrots were still hard.  So I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer for them to soften.  Who know's it may have just been to potatoes I used.  It tasted a little bitter to me so I added a Tbsp on brown sugar which made a big difference.  I will make it again.

Really good but a bit labor intensive because I doubled the recipe so it required quite a bit of vegetable chopping. I enjoyed it and so did everyone else except for my son who loves Indian food. This is the first Indian dish he hasn't liked.

This was so good! Everyone in the family loved it! I put a little less curry in it because we ran out, but it was still delicious. Next time, we might add some shrimp! Thanks for a great recipe...we'll be making this again soon.

We really, really liked this one! I cut it down to 1/2 a jalapeño for my kids. Used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and 13.5 oz can of coconut milk in lieu of cream. Not super hard to prep -cutting the carrots probably took the most time. We ate it over basmati rice and cauliflower rice mixed. I think next time I will try it with cauliflower florets instead of potato which should cut down cook time by a LOT.  We also added chicken, but I think it would also be good with garbanzo beans. Definitely a simple, filling dish that everyone raves about!

I'm so happy to have this recipe.  The cooking time was longer than advertised, but I was not precise about quantity, so that likely caused some of the delay.  I did substitute coconut milk for the cream. I will make this again.

So I will start by saying - I have not ever been a huge fan of Indian food but have been playing with some recipes for my daughter who does enjoy it and is vegetarian so there are lots of tasty options. That being said, this recipe may have changed me - it was so delicious - I did omit the jalapeno and used red and yellow peppers just because of tolerance and allergies. But it was rich in flavor and so healthy. If you are not vegetarian, you can easily add some chicken. I will agree that the potatoes and carrots needed some additional time to cook or cut them into much smaller sizes. I am also at altitude so additional time is needed.

Delicious, but it takes a long time to cook the potatoes as others have mentioned. I am guessing at least an hour. I also had to keep adding water so the potatoes did not boil dry. I look forward to making this again!

Delish!! Took advice and subbed coconut milk for heavy cream. Also add califlower the last 30 minute (+/-) of simmer time. I've made this dish several times. I always double and freeze for future meals. I also began adding any left over vegies. Italian style greenbeans for example. Enjoy!!

Delicious! And so easy! You can add browned sliced chicken sausage sliced or pieces of chicken (i would also brown these separately), but also truly excellent as a vegetarian meal. Oh, I used sugar snap peas instead of the round green peas. I’m sure pieces of cauliflower would also go great in this too.

It would have gotten 5 but it took my potatoes 2 hours to cook :( ..and I boiled the potatoes beforehand because of the reviews saying it took longer to cook. I read a couple reasons why it took so long...1 because I boiled them first 2 the acidity of the tomato sauce....however,  to make I used 3 potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, and peas. I doubled the seasonings and added cumin &  chili powder. I bought naan & together it is tasty!

This was very aromatic and authentic. Loved it. Next time I will substitute garbanzo beans instead of the peas. This will add protein.

Great recipe for vegetarians! Satisfying, delicious, and different from the everyday chickpea dish. If you don’t have jalapeños, don’t worry. Sprinkle some chili or hot sauce on top, and you’ll get that kick!

It tastes very good, worth the effort for sure. I should have parboiled or nuked the spuds first. Took WAAAY longer than 20 mins to cook.

Very nice! I hope that the leftovers are good because it made a ton. I left out the bell peppers (because my husband is not a fan), and I added a can of drained chickpeas (because my husband is always worried about getting enough protein). Delicious and satisfying.

For starters, It makes A LOT more than 4 servings; more like 8 servings.  I also made naan bread from this site (that  is going to be a work in progress).  One of the best vegetarian recipes I've ever made.  I did make modifications to our taste.  I felt it dumb to use 1/2 green and 1/2 red pepper, so I just used 1 red pepper, which I prefer over green.  I upped the curry to 2 Tablespoons.  Reduced to 2 cloves of garlic.  Used 1/2 can of coconut milk, instead of cream, 8 ounces of tomato sauce (keeping calories down).  Added lima beans and peas.  My husband said he would have liked garbanzos; I'm thinking about that one.  Salt is a must.  I knew a whole jalapeño was too hot for us, so I used a small Serrano., and only used about 2/3's of that pepper. No cashews, which I will add in portion of the leftovers, and let you know.  Dip with naan bread--no utensils necessary.  It makes it feel so authentically Indian.

I decided to add in a teaspoon or so of red chili powder and turmeric when I added in the curry. Had a well rounded taste with a little heat.. perfection. I also decided to make chapati bread to go with this meal. Was prefect in every way.

Cut your potatoes and carrots in very small cubes. If you don't,  you'll be sitting on that stage for an hour, requiring more tomato sauce and water. I used yogurt instead of heavy cream.  Definitely made a difference in the taste. Overall original flavor was ok.

This is fantastic! I love curry so added a little extra. We also like a little heat so I did not seed the  pepper. Served this with basmati rice.

I'm going to make it again this week and double the recipe so I can take some to the office for lunch.

Made it as written.  Served it over brown rice.  I topped it with a little lime juice and cilantro.  I think a little plain yogurt would be good.

The cooking time for this dish is much longer than stated.  Delicious when complete but if making for a dinner party make sure you give yourself 15-30 minutes longer than the recipe states.

We loved it! I did follow previous reviewer' advice  and used more spices & coconut milk. I also added the coconut milk earlier and simmered the potatoes & carrots in it. I added one drained can of garbanzo beans for more protein, too. I added the green frozen peas very last, just until they warmed up, so they would keep their pretty color. So delicious! Thanks for the recipe, it's great for Meatless Monday!

Added 1 tsp garam marsala and 3 cardamon pods based on other reviews.  also, potatoes took a long time to cook so next time, I'll try pre-steaming them a bit to speed up it up.  Great recipe!!

Delicious.  I followed the lead of many of the other reviewers and added more spice.  Extra curry powder, turmeric, and cumin.  In hindsight, I wish I had also put in more garlic, because it was still lacking just a little.  I also omitted the onions, which could be part of it.  The only other thing I changed was one red bell pepper instead of a half of red, and a half of green bell pepper.  I'll make this again and keep working on bringing out the delicious flavors more dramatically.

I loved the taste and since I'm trying much harder this year to eat more veggies I was glad to have found this recipe.  I usually make recipes verbatim but past experience and a number of other commenters helped with the suggestion of precooking the root vegetables, which worked wonderfully.  I had a bit more sauce than I thought I would but nothing that takes away from the recipe overall.  In addition you will enjoy it more if you make it with cumin, coriander, tumeric and garam masala - 1 teaspoon of each.

I love this dish.  I made it for a party I am having and I have some vegetarian guests.  It is colorful, has a wonderful aroma, and the flavor is unbelievable!  I have to say I did make one change.  I added coconut milk.  I had to make a double batch. So instead of 2 cups of heavy cream, I put 13 oz can of coconut milk and 4 oz heavy cream.  YUMMY!

Although I didn’t have tge peas & had to spice it up with sriracha instead of jalapeño to use what I had it was delicious. Read reviews:yes, it does stick some so stir frequently, the potatoes do take quite a while to cook& the coconut milk was terrrific in it. I didn’t have peas or the ground cashews on hand so we did without.

This only took 1/2 hour to make and was delish!  I didn't have the cashews or cilantro, used frozen peas and carrots for lack of fresh, and left out the jalapeno.  Also used sour cream.  I plan to add more curry powder to the left-overs as mine is very mild.

I urge you to try this for a quick and minimally spicy Indian meal.

This was easy and delicious. I added some cumin, and used full fat coconut milk in place of cream. Also added some shredded cabbage. Served on brown rice it was delicious.

I have made this recipe twice now and those I have served it to really have enjoyed.  It is mild enough for those who do not like a strong curry.  
I only wonder if I should be using toasted ground almonds or raw?   I suspect raw would be better - then you would not see it all in the recipe.

I suggest adding some kind of liquid (like broth) to the potatoes while cooking, to avoid everything sticking to the pan. This recipe was perfect for my parents, who are currently on a vegetarian diet! Will make again.
I recommend not using both rice and potatoes, as that may be too much starch, and carbs. You could either serve it by itself or put it over riced cauliflower.

I am not a big curry fan most of the time but this turned out very well. I didn't add the peas and onions as I have dislikes and allergies, but the rest of this dish was wonderful. I mixed in some cooked rice and ate it on naan. It was a bit of starch overload so I will not be eating this very regularly but it was tasty. Very Easy Dish.

This recipe is so good and seems to get better the more I make it.  I have found it is best to have everything chopped a crushed before you start frying the onion.  Otherwise its a panic.  Also I like to dice the potatoes nice and small so they cook faster.  I follow the directions exactly and love it!

Was a little on the dry side when served with rice. Will definitely make this again. will add more tomato sauce and heavy cream the next time. Very mild flavor of curry. Easy to correct it to hotter flavor with using hot curry powder. Made this for my vegetarian granddaughter. She loved it as written.

This is a great base recipe. As a lot of reviewers have suggested, I exchanged the heavy cream for a can of coconut milk. I also added additional spices, such as turmeric, cardamom, and cinnamon. I put some finely chopped cauliflower in, and you couldn't even tell it was there. Be ready to cook the potatoes for far longer than 10 minutes; I diced the potatoes into small cubes and it still took half an hour for them to cook. I will definitely be making this again!

I loved this recipe and did make some changes. Like others suggested, I subbed coconut milk and tomato paste. I also changed up the veggies based on my tastes and added kale, cauliflower, and sweet potatoes. Like others, I added more seasoning. 
Fun fact- I froze a bunch of this in mason jars for quick and easy grab-and-go work lunches. It defrosted/reheated perfectly, and I paired it with Trader Joe's garlic naan.

This was amazing! I kept with the heavy cream, did 8oz of tomato sauce. I would opt out the cilantro as garnish, it adds a fresh flavor if you want it, but is kinda of out of place with everything else being warm and cooked. The dish is a bit sweet and very little heat.

WARNING! I've made this successfully many times and it's always delicious.  I make it vegan by substituting coconut cream rather than cream.  Soo good.  But this time after all the chopping and cooking, I went to add the coconut cream and didn't realize there's a difference between coconut cream and cream of coconut.  Instead of a thick cream substitute I added a sugary coconut syrup.  Dumped the whole thing.  I was so disappointed because the korma smelled so good.

After reading reviews I used an equal portion of tumeric, cardamon, and garam masala instead of store bought curry powder. I think next time I might use a little curry powder but still add those spices. I did use the tomato sauce, but instead of heavy cream I added a can of full fat coconut milk, which added a really nice flavor. I was making this in my cast iron skillet, which adds a nice flavor, but since I don't have a lid for it took about twice as long for the potatoes to cook. They were firm but cooked. Over all this is a really good base recipe, but I'll be adapting it more on my next attempt.

Nice base, but too bland for me, even after upping the spices a lot. And I don't even eat (hot) spicy food, just looking for flavor.

I also found that the frozen peas clashed with the dish. Whole peas in the shells might do better, though I'd just leave them out and add cauliflower and/or broccoli instead.  Raisins are good for sweetness too.

I did not have jalapeños on hand, so I added a bit of cayenne pepper. I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. It came out perfect! I will definitely make this again and again! I served mine with cauliflower "rice".

Switched it up a bit after reading the other reviews. I did 1 can of coconut milk, 1 tsp each of curry, garam masala, cumin. 1/2 tsp coriander and 1/2 tsp turmeric. Halved the salt. Great flavor! This was a good base recipe. Next time I'll use less oil as it was too oily for us and was separating

I've made this dish twice and both times with great success.  The coconut milk is definitely what makes it.  My husband loved it and my father, who is a professional cook and very critical of anything I make in the kitchen, enjoyed it too.  Whenever my dad is involved there is always a "critique session" after the meal which revolves on what I did wrong.  After he ate this he had nothing to say which, as far as he is concerned, is a good thing!  He even went for seconds, which is unheard of for him.  I will definitely make this again!

Food components were fine but even doubling the spices called for this is a very bland meal. I'd suggest half the cream  and much spicier chilies

Outstanding! I followed advice of others and used coconut milk (light) instead of heavy cream. Instead of curry powder, I used 1.5 tbsp garam masala, 1 tsp turmeric, and 1 tsp cumin. My friend (who is Indian) wanted the recipe!

This tasted very good! My daughter loved it. I did substitute the heavy cream for coconut milk. It came out tasting great! I served it over basmati rice. Needless to say, there were no left overs.

Left out the jalapeno so my kids wouldn't complain about it being too spicy; served over rice and naan.  Everyone in the family gave it a double thumbs-up. We will make this one again!

Can't say enough good things about this recipe.  The flavor if off the charts good.  We've cut out the potatoes and substituted cauliflower.  We also pour this over quinoa!  Fabulous!!!

I did make some changes as recommended by other cooks. I  used coconut milk (from the can) instead of cream. Also substituted broccoli for the peas because that is what I had. The seasoning for me was just right, but I think curry is really different with each brand. I use McCormick curry as it has more fenugreek and I like that flavor.

What a fantastic recipe! I've made it several times now. I love how good it tastes and how healthy it is, and that my husband, who generally doesn't like Indian food, loves it too! He even brought some to work with him today.

The last time I made it I added more cashews than the recipe recommended and substituted coconut milk for the heavy cream. It was still fabulous. As other reviewers have noted, you'll need to cook the potatoes for longer than 10 minutes.

I brought this to a Super Bowl party last night. My red meat-loving uncle-in-law made a point of telling me that he was humbled to say that this was great. Several people have asked for the recipe.

I made this recipe as it states, and it was really great! I think it could have used more sauce, so I think I'll figure out a way to make more next time (maybe 50% more of the cream and spices?).  I look forward to trying it again!

I and my family thought this was great.  The only problem I had was the cooking time for the potatoes, maybe I used the wrong kind (russet) but they took more like 20-25 minutes to cook then the 10 minutes suggested in the recipe.

I'm Indian so used my own spice mix (cumin, turmeric, garam masala, black pepper and salt) which I added with the onions, garlic and ginger and paste to initially release the flavours.  I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil or ghee.  

I then added the potatoes and carrots with a can of diced tomatoes and a cup of water (I also added tofu and cauliflower).  I had to let that liquid cook down on medium high for a long time until the potatoes were cooked.  Then I added the can of light coconut milk instead of cream and let it all simmer down.  It is strange to use a jalepeno in Indian cooking so I used green chilies with the bell peppers.  

Then I made a cup of brown rice and mixed that in once both were cooked.  Delicious and healthy meatless meal.  Easy to pack in single serving dishes for lunch.

Very  easy and delicious recipe.  I did lighten it a bit by substituting 2% milk for the heavy cream.  The curry powder I used was a hotter variety since my family likes more heat in some of the dishes we make.  My husband requested that I make this again which I definetly will.

My husband & older daughter loved this!!!  I followed the suggestions to sub coconut milk for heavy cream & adding 2 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1 1/4 tsp turmeric, 3/4 tsp ground cardamom, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg to the curry powder.  And to add curry seasoning to onions.   Although I ended up not using all of the curry mix.  Sub cauliflower for potato.

I will definitely make it again. My family & company absolutely loved the meal. I used coconut milk instead of cream. I use turmeric, cardamom, garam masala & cinnamon. I also used the curry powder I had. then I decided to add pine apple, apples & mango. I had no green peppers so I used red only. The taste was amazing....however it takes a lot longer for the potatoes & carrots to soften, so next time I will boil them half way first.

I love this recipe and I've made is SO many times. My only issue is that the potatoes will NOT cook in 10 minutes. Used canned or steam beforehand. My only other change is that I normally add in a meat as well :)

This is a standard in our house. I usually omit the jalapeño, and add hot sauce (for adults) afterward. It's always appreciated at potlucks as an alternative (vegan,non-gluten,etc.) entree.

The flavor was good, but you MUST boil the potatoes partially to give them a head-start. Otherwise, it tastes starchy.

I made it exactly as directed and it came out great. I made it early in the morning and then we ate it later for dinner so that it had a chance to sit. The leftovers the next day were even better, the longer you let t sit, the better it gets. I would have added more cream and some vegetable stock so that there would be more of a sauce than a glaze, but it was excellent. I served it over a rice and lentil mix for a little extra protein.

OMG. So delicious. I substituted some things because of what I had available. Sweet potatoes for potatoes. Had to simmer the potato mix in some chicken broth and extra tomato sauce because it took a while for them to soften.  I had cubed then in small pieces.  Used broccoli instead of peppers.  Added a bit more cream and pieces of cod during when I added the cream.

This was very good. I used coconut milk rather than the heavy cream, extra curry powder and some stewed tomatoes. It did take much longer to cook like others mentioned (thanks) even though I thought I had the potatoes cut up in small pieces. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

Must first parboil the potatoes or you'll be another 30 minutes making this!  (I know because that's what happened when I made it as written.)  As recommended by others, I add the curry powder to the onions.  Also, I increased spices: added 1 tsp garam masala, 3/4 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/4 tsp ground cardamom, and 1/8 tsp cinnamon with the salt.  With these tweaks, it's now in our regular rotation, and we are certified carnivores!

Great tasting dish! I added beets as well since it's in season. I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. And instead of frozen peas, I used sugar snap peas.

This is a good recipe, I did not use cashews. I only used half a bell pepper and a whole can of coconut milk. I skipped the cilantro. I accompanied it with white rice. Omg, it is good.

Delicious...I made it near to the exact recipe except I didn't have ground cashews.  The sauce thickened on its own without the cashews perhaps due to the russet potatoes I used.

I enjoyed this a lot.  I added a bit - used the curry powder as written but added garam masala too in equal parts.  I also added about a half head of cauliflower and a can of chick peas to really make this hearty.  Served it over rice and looked forward to the leftovers in my lunch!

Amazing. First time ever making an Indian dish. Made this for my sister per request for her birthday. She loved it! So much flavor! I didn't change a thing. I made this with jasmine rice and Naan. Couldn't have been any better! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Absolutely delicious, it was one of the best all recipes i've ever tried. I would definitely recommend it. You could also use the korma and rice as stuffing for stuffed paprikas out of the oven (i did that with the left overs the next day). Another tip is to serve it with naan, its a really great combination!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes ever.  I've made it many times.  I've tried a few of the variations and this is what I like the best:
- heavy whipping cream vs. Coconut cream.  The dairy cream is just better.  The other flavors aren't masked and it's so nice and fatty!
- garam masala (mostly) with some lemon curry powder
- a whole container of crushed cashews.  These guys just add a lot to the dish, so add more!

MAde the changes to spice specified by a user in the comments: added cumin, increased amount of curry. Excellent recipe. Only thing was that the two normal sized potatoes we used provided too much potato and they did not cook evenly.

Even my picky, meat-loving kids like it! I substitute one can of coconut milk for the heavy cream to make it vegan...even though we're not. Gives it a nice flavor.

This was easy and delicious.  I added mushrooms because they needed to be used and 5 small pods of okra, becasue I had them.   I also added a few cardamon pods.  I will be making this one again.

Loved it for its mild flavor. Great for when craving an Indian meal on a hot summer day;I mashed some for my eight month old daughter and she devoured every bit of it! It'll be my go to korma recipe when I'm in a rush; very easy to make.

Very yummy! 
I have made this twice now.  First time the exact recipe.  Second time I made a few changes:
No peas, just used the whole green and red pepper.
I used 3 tablespoons of curry powder - could have used a little more in my opinion.
Used coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  Added much more flavor.  And wasn't so heavy/thick. 
Added a tbs of cumin.  
VERY YUMMY!

This is one of our favorite recipes. However, I use an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce (instead of 4 oz.)  and a can of coconut milk instead of cream. I always add 2-3 cups grilled chicken, and a bit more water. Absolutely delicious. I serve with brown rice and home-made naan.

loved it.  I'm not a spicy person but felt that it needed more.
  did anyone blend it?
I used coconut milk instead of cream or tomato sauce.  I did add a fresh tomato.  and only one potato, as per other reviews.  
really good with brown jasmine  rice cooked in a bit of coconut oil.

I used a whole can of canned coconut cream for the cream to make it vegan and everyone went crazy for it!  Just enough spice, one of my favorite dinners!

Husband and I were quite pleased with the results! I substituted the heavy cream for coconut milk and it tasted just like the restaurant. Here's a helpful hint: let potatoes boil for 20 min on the stovetop prior to prepping. This will ensure they are thoroughly cooked when they are tossed in with the veggies!

I made this as directed, minus the jalapeno and it was terrific! Lots of chopping made it take a bit longer than advertised but we would make it again, perhaps in a double batch to freeze? Also, adding cauliflower or subbing out one potato for some cauliflower would be delicious, too, and a bit less heavy. We served it with rice and naan, so it was a lot of carbs. :)

Yum.  I was hesitant to make this because I was skeptical that I would like it.  It was very yummy!  The creamy sauce and veggies mixed with rice is very good.

I used coconut milk instead of cream.  I also added cumin and more curry because I like a bit more flavour.
Next time I will add red curry paste to add a bit more zip to the flavour... Enjoyed it on brown rice.

Followed the suggestions to add a little more curry powder and some cumin and cayenne to bring the spice level up. The potatoes do need to cook a bit longer than 10 minutes, I would put them in first with the onions so they have time to fully cook through.

The dish was delicious, and tasted just like it does in the restaurant! I will definitely be making this again!

It is very good! However, it is hard to get the potatoes to cook all the way, so cut them as small as possible and cook longer that the time in the recipe.

Awesome! Halved the recipe for the two of us, but put in the entire can of coconut milk (which was perfect for dipping the Naan). Followed other people's spice addition hints and did cauliflower  instead of peas. Excellent! Thanks! Loved it! So happy there is enough left over for tomorrow!

This was wonderful!!! I added a little red curry paste and garbanzo beans which "beefed" it up a bit. It took an extra 30 minutes to get the carrots and potatoes cooked through but the rest of the vegetables held up during the extended cooking time.  Would be great with chicken or shrimp, as well.

We definitely enjoyed this dish.  I am always hesitant to write reviews as I seldom follow the recipe exactly.  I always read others reviews and tweak according to our tastes.  For this recipe I used yogurt instead of heavy cream and followed the spices noted by another reviewer rather than straight curry.  Served over Jasmine rice.  Very tasty.

The taste on this recipe was amazing! The only reason why I can't give this 5 stars is because the cooking times were messed up a bit. I followed other people's advice and cooked the potatoes first and that worked well. What didn't work well is the carrots. After 45 minutes cooking they still never cooked through. I ended up having to have to use almost 2 cups of coconut milk because the korma kept getting to thick due to the fact that it was on the heat for so long so the final product was not the consistency I was looking for. I added more curry powder than the recipe called for and also added a little cinnamon and Cardamom. Next time I make this recipe I will pre cook the carrots with the potatoes.

This was ok, but not nearly as much flavor as the vegan curries that I have been making, found on allrecipes as well.

I did follow some reviewers advice and added Garam masala, turmeric, coriander, and  used coconut milk instead of cream.  I am glad I did these things, definitely made for nice combination of flavours.   I also cut the potatoes into small cubes and the cooking time was spot on.

I followed the suggestions of many others and doubled the curry and added garam masala,  pre-cooked the potato, added some chicken and used coconut milk. It was delicious. It was even better the next day after the flavors had a chance to meld. I will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious!!  Fantastic recipe!  I changed some things based on what I had on hand.  
It takes longer to cook overall unless you boil the potatoes and carrots 10-15 minutes before adding to the dish. I added curry paste with the onion and ground garam masala, turmeric, cumin, and cardamon at the end. I used large onion, large potato (or cauliflower), whole red bell pepper and celery. Excluded the tomato sauce, green bell, jalapeno peppers, peas, and cilantro. Also finely chopped the cashews. Use whipping cream or coconut milk.
Will serve with saag paneer next time I make it!

Very very good!  I added an additional 1/2 cup of cream and used garam masala instead of pre-prepared curry powder.

Good recipe, can adjust flavor as desired. The potatoes/carrots took a lot longer than 10 mins to become tender though so definitely add that into cook time!

It tasted amazing! Make sure to cut the potatoes really really small or they won't cook fast enough. It's a great dish! We served it with rice.

I cut way back on the jalepeno for the sake of the kids, used peanuts instead of cashews and whole milk instead of cream (because that's what I had). I added a bit more spice: some cumin, turmeric and garam masala. I also tossed in 1/4 cup of black beans I needed to use up and left out the peppers.

Loved this!  I did sub a can of coconut milk for the heavy cream, and added it early to aid in the cooking of the potatoes.  I might even add more later next time.  I also added the curry with the onions to allow it to cook in the oil too.  Turned out great!

I made this as written. (I always do the first time.) It was sooooo yummy! Husband and I took leftovers for lunch the next day, and we both were sad that there wasn't more. It was a bit spicy for our kids though, what with the jalapeño and all, so they didn't eat it. But it had just the right amount of heat and spice, balanced with the smoothness of the cream. 
Tip: I cut the potatoes in small chunks to make sure they cooked through by the end of cooking time.

I followed many of the recommendations.  I substituted plain yogurt for the tomato sauce and  I substituted coconut milk for the cream.  Instead of just curry powder, I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1 1/4 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp garam  masala,  3/4 tsp cardamom, 1 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and a dash of ground cloves.  I also added a can of chick peas and diced tomatoes.  I also found I needed to cook the potatoes for closer to 30 minutes instead of suggested 10.  But this was very good.

I've prepared this like three times already and is deliciuos. There are some things that you can modify but it still a good recipe if you want something different for lunch and most of all that's vegetarian.

A very nice recipe!  
The second or third time I made it, I forgot to buy potatoes and heavy cream at the market so substituted cauliflower and coconut milk.  the original recipe listed above is lovely, but I'm sticking with my lower calorie variation. Try it sometime!

I used my own curry mixture (cumin, coriander, turmeric and Cayanne pepper) i highly recommend steaming your veggies until soft before making this.   So disappointing.

This turned out great right from the start, but is easily adaptable depending on what you have in the fridge. I often throw in some cauliflower or whatever else I have and it turns out great. Tastes great on the next day as well. A keeper!

2015.02.29  I made so many changes (last minute recipe), but it is still great!  I served it with turmeric rice and AMINAH A. RAHMAN's Chickpea Curry from this site.

This would not have fit in my skillet, so I used a medium-size pot.

Potatoes take WAY LONGER to cook than specified.  At least 20 minutes of simmering.  In the future, start this dish first, then move to the others once this is simmering.

Mods:
Entire 8-oz can tomato sauce
14-oz can coconut milk in place of cream
No bell pepper (wish I had it, so I mounded the peas in the cup, should have used 2 cups peas)
1/4 tsp cayenne in place of jalapeno (CUT TO 1/8 NEXT TIME FOR DBF)
3 normal-size red potatoes, peeled and SMALL dice
2 Tbs curry powder (Spice Islands brand)
Massive scoop (~2 Tbs) peanut butter in place of cashews
Butter in place of oil
No cilantro

It didn't quite stack up to restaurant Korma, but it's not too bad. Maybe some more spice would have helped.

Evidently I'm simply not a fan of korma. I heeded the warning of other reviewers and partially pre-cooked the potatoes and added more spices and cauliflower. It still turned out dry and bland. Despite all of the vegetables, this meal's texture was simply too starchy for my (and my family's) liking.

I'm a cream girl. I love recipes with cream BUT I have to say, this is sooooo much better with coconut milk. Also I found that you need closer to 15oz of tomato sauce. The potatoes and carrots don't have enough moisture to cook in using only 4 oz.

This was an okay dish. The potatoes tasted the best, maybe add some more of those. Not sure if I would make it again, perhaps if I want Indian food really bad.

Tasted great but it needed A LOT more liquid to cook the potatoes. I tripled the amount of sauce and it was perfect. It had to cook an extra 15min I'm guessing. Potatoes were about 1cm cubes, maybe a bit bigger. I used light coconut milk instead of cream.

'Didn't have a jalapeno  & subbed coconut milk for the cream.  Not spicy.  It was fine, but not anything I'll play with or repeat; but still glad I tried.

It is a great starting point for experimentation or if your just learning. But as an experienced cook I too read the reviews and altered based on the majority. I used coconut milk and more spice across the board. I subbed where I had to, like all I had were frozen orange peppers from my CSA. But all in all in keeping with the spirit of the dish. It was yummy over my Mexican long grain white rice :)

Fabulous! I increased servings to 6 and used 1 can coconut milk in place of cream.

I think the spices need tweaked.  It might be a great basic introduction for someone that doesn't appreciate curries, but I needed much more "umph".  I combined the suggestions of several reviewers and added more curry powder, cardamom, cumin, turmeric, garam masala, cinnamon (I added all these spices with the onions so they could benefit from heating), pepper and a pinch of brown sugar.  It also needed more salt.  I used lite coconut milk in place of the heavy cream and still used the tomato sauce, and the sauce was perfect in consistency.  I also added lots of cauliflower, since most veggie korma I have ever had contains cauliflower, which is always my favorite veggie in there.  Steaming the veggies while the curry sauce cooked made quick assembly.  My husband swears he hates curries, but he ate it and said it was good.  Baby steps with him...

Agree with mermaid's and others' suggestions to substitute coconut milk for the tomato sauce and cream, and turmeric, cardamom, and garam masala iso curry powder. I add chicken, too. A family favorite.  Delicious!

Love this recipe! Great flavors and not too spicy (I'd love for more kick, but my husband is anti-spicy). I did have to use about 3x as much tomato sauce because everything was starting to just stick to the pan. Also, I didn't have any cashews so just threw in 3 Tbls. of peanut butter. Great substitution if you don't have the cashews on hand.

A tasty and affordably exotic Monday for me! I recommend cutting the potatoes and carrots smaller so they cook closer to what the recipes states. It took a lot longer for me. I only used one bell pepper, no jalapeño, and an 8oz can of tomato sauce over brown rice. Very delicious.

I did make some alterations at the suggestion of other reviewers. I used a combination of coconut milk and tomato sauce and added more than called for for a saucier Korma. I also added some whole cashews at the end. Overall, it was very good. My family liked it and I plan to make it again!

Turned out amazing. Added twice as much tomato sauce for a more saucy dish, and served it over rice.  I agree with some of the other reviews, though, 10 minutes to cook the potatoes is ridiculous, it took me easily half an hour to get them to a edible consistency.  But, for my first time making Indian food, it turned out much better than expected!

I didn't use heavy cream. It dulls out the spices. I used Thai  coconut milk which is what most curry dishes use. Tasted amazing.

I followed advice of others. I added  3 1/2 t. curry,  2 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp garam  marsala, 1/2 tsp cinnamon,  1/4 t. cayenne, and 1/2 t. tumeric. I cut down the salt to 1 1/2 t. I also added 1  1/2 c. cauliflower , doubled the peas , and added  1 c. chick peas. I also exchanged the cream for 1 can of coconut milk. I served it over quinoa cooked in vegetable stock.  It was delicious

This recipe was a big hit with my family, however I did make some alterations. Firstly I left out the cashews. Secondly I left out the jalapeño and instead used a can of rotel. It turned out great!

I have made this dish twice. The pros: it's a tasty way to use up any frozen or fresh veggies you happen to have on hand and it's hearty and filling. The second time I made it I added more potatoes and it was better than being served on rice. I do like this dish and it does remind me of restaurant vegetarian korma, but I wouldn't serve it to a guest or recommend to a friend. It's missing a punch... It's just a little bland.

Wonderful!  Skipped the green peppers as a personal preference and added garam masala.  It's a tad too spicy for my taste.  I think I'll skip the jalapeño next time to keep flavor but reduce the heat.

Use  8oz can tomato sauce, par cook the potatoes and carrots.  Instead of cream I used 1 - 15 oz can coconut cream since I made this for my son who is a vegan and cannot eat dairy.  Very good!

My family loved it so much they asked me to make more this same week! It was sooo good! I did make a couple changes, instead of vegetable oil, I used olive oil, and instead of fresh onions, (because I'm allergic) I used onion powder and doubled up on the curry and cumin and used powdered ginger instead of fresh ginger and i left out the cashews. still came out tasting great!

Awesome recipe, but as others have mentioned you need to cook those potatoes longer, or else they're gonna be far too crunchy.  The final product was also a bit bland, but others have great suggestions on how to spice it up a little. I just ate my leftovers for lunch without rice and it was still delicious and filling on its own.

Very good. We all loved it and had it at a potluck where it was almost gone. Made a large casserole dish of it and poured on top of the rice. Used more tomato sauce while cooking and the 2 T of curry as others suggested. Not too spicy. Next time I will add a can of chickpeas for more protein. I did cut the vegetables up in small cubes to cook faster and added some acorn squash that I had waiting to be added to something. Was a good addition. I may also try coconut milk instead of the cream next time also.

I used Spirited Sarah's recommendations on the spices and coconut milk.  I used Cauliflower, carrots, green peas and sweet potatoes (cut in small chunks).  Next time I will also use chick peas!   I parboiled all the veggies to the consistency I like which is "not mushy" and still a bit firm.   When I was finished making the sauce I simply tossed in the veggies and coated them with the sauce.   It came out creamy and had lots of cream left to soak in to the rice.  I LOVED IT!   I could eat this every week.  Maybe I should share it with Burmese Superstar Restaurant across the street.

A definite keeper!!!  My husband says he doesn't like Indian cuisine, but he sure did eat a lot of this :)  I just "forgot" to tell him that it was an Indian recipe...

I used 2 potatoes as the recipe calls for, however, I think mine were MUCH LARGER than what the recipe intended, so I added a full bag of frozen peas  and a few more carrots (mostly for color, plus, I like veggies).  Also, I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil, and since I decided to try this at the last minute, I used skim milk because I didn't have heavy cream.  I also didn't have any jalapenos or cashews handy .  But...  This recipe turned out SOOOOO good!

Instead of heavy cream I used a small can of coconut milk - it was still very delicious

This is a very simple and delicious recipe to make.  I usually make recipes as written to see how I like the original recipe,  then adjust it the next time I make it.  However,  this recipe is great as written.  

My husband isn't a fan of vegetarian meals, but liked this one.  He said if it had some meat he would like it even better, so I tried it with some chicken today and it was still delicious.  I just sauteed a cubed chicken breast seasoned with just salt and pepper and then removed it from the pan and continued to follow the recipe.  I added the chicken back to the pan when the potatoes were almost done cooking and then added the rest of the ingredients.  Great dish!

Hmmm. Well, it wasn't bad - it was just missing something. I followed some other reviewers' advice and used light coconut milk instead of cream and tomato sauce and boosted the spice (2 tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 4 cardamom pods). I also used cauliflower instead of potato. I think it needed a little more creaminess and something extra to give a little more flavour. I might remake the recipe following the original instructions and see where I can go from there.

Super easy to make and delicious! I added an extra jalapeño ( with seeds) because I like it hot. I upped the curry powder to about 2 tbls and added 1 tbl of ground turmeric as well as about 1 teaspoon of hot spicy powder. Served over basmati rice and roti. Cilantro as garnish.

I loved this . Due to food allergies I cut out the peas . I didn't want potatoes so I used cauliflower.  It worked great!  I will say that I followed another comment and added almost twice the curry, added turmeric and cumin. It almost sounds like I didn't follow the recipe at all .... it was the best base that I could trust and   I feel like I can build on this recipe .

I am a terrible cook .... this recipe makes me feel like I can conquer the world.  I'd only suggest for a novice to do all the cutting ahead of time. I cut as I went through which resulted in some bloodshed.

Used Coconut milk instead of cream to make it vegan. Could use a little kick. Next time I will use a little thai curry paste.

First time making this and my family loved it, however I would have loved it even more if it was a bit more spicy. I think next time I will definitely increase the cumin and curry. Can't wait to make this again!

Delicious!  I have a severe cashew allergy, so I substituted pine nuts.  I also reduced the salt to 1 tsp.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and served with warm naan.  I loved it and my kids loved it.  This is a keeper!

We love Korma, and we really liked this basic recipe as a base from which to expand! As others suggested, I used the traditional cooking method of adding the seasonings with the onions, added additional seasonings (cardamom, tumeric, and garam masala), subbed some of the potatoes with cauliflower instead, and used coconut milk instead of cream. I used Yukon Gold potatoes as these cook a little faster and lend the perfect texture. I also added some paneer cheese cubes. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This is absolutely incredible. I had a very hard time finding ground cashews and I did not have a food processor. I did this:

1.) Put cashews in a sealed plastic bag.
2.) Cover bag with a towel.
3.) Smash it up with a can of soup
4.) Rolled the can of soup over the bag repeatedly until the nuts are obliterated.

I made this dish with some of the changes listed in the comments section (swapped coconut milk for cream, used turmeric, added cumin and cinnamon) and my husband and I LOVED it!  He said it was better than the Indian food from some of our favorite Indian restaurants!  Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

Really delicious receive. Though the amount of salt and curry powder is a bit too much. I replaced the cream with coconut milk as recommended by the review and it turned out cool. I also replace the tomato sauce with 3regular sized tomatoes.

It was Ok if you like things with light flavors. I had to add more spices to get a real korma flavor going. I also added cauliflower.

This was really good.  I have never been very fond of curry dishes, but decided to try this for my husband.  He loved it and I loved it!  I only added half as much salt as the recipe called for.  It was very flavorful and filling.  I will definitely make again.

I loved this.  I also listened to the reviews and used light coconut milk and 1/8 of cream for color. I used 1 table spoon mild yellow curry and 2 tablespoons madras curry powder (which has coriander, clove, garlic etc). I added the curries when I was cooking the onions and mushrooms, not during the sauce. I added mushrooms and meant to add spinach and garbanzo beans but I forgot. I let it simmer for about half hour and I served it with Indian basmati rice which I added saffron to while it was cooking.

I make this on a regular basis and absolutely love it.   Everyone in the family, including both vegetarians and non-vegetarians, enjoys it.    I make it without the green peas because one family member doesn't like them, but it still turns out great.    

You can adjust things quite a bit, as many of the reviews suggest you can add coconut milk instead of the cream and tomato sauce; you can add chick peas for more protein; it's a great basic recipe to adapt.

Potatoes never really softened... Took much longer to cook than said.  Used whatever veggies I had in the bin.  End product is great.  Can't go wrong with heavy cream (though I cut in half and was plenty rich).

I was looking for the perfect recipe for a birthday party.  I did a trial run and I think that this will be a hit!  I took the suggestion of the other poster and did their version of the additional spices along with the coconut milk and cauliflower.  My edition to this recipe is instead of potatoes was butternut squash that I found already cut up.  It does take some time for the butternut squash to soften, so I put a lid on the mixture.  I used a bag of frozen cauliflower and a bag of peas and carrots.  So simple and quick.  Thanks so much!!

Amazing dish! I've made this several times now and it's been a hit everytime. I cook the potatoes and carrots mixture longer than 10 minutes until they get soft. I add dashes of other spices as well, some turmeric, cardamon, garam Marsala, ginger powder, fried cumin seeds, and whatever else I feel like that day. It's always turned out delicious and never overpowering.  I also add some cooked chicken at the same time as the cream and let it simmer.

My husband and I really enjoyed the recipe.  I had problems getting the potatoes to cook so next time I would either cut them smaller or pre cook them.

Really good! I followed other reviewers suggestions regarding using coconut milk instead of cream and doubling the amount of curry. I also added turmeric and garam masala to taste to add a more authentic flavor. I also used potatoes + a bag of already cut frozen veggies (carrots, cauliflower and brocoli) and skipped the peas (I used what I had on hand). Also, didn't add the jalapeno because I wanted my daughter to be able to eat it. My husband couldn't belive I did this myself and did not buy it at our favorite restaurant! Thanks for the great recipe!

In addition to curry powder, I used turmeric, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper. I didn't have garam masala on hand, but I would have used that as well. I added some cilantro with the veggies. Instead of adding the spices later, I sautéed them with the onions, and then added more to taste after I added the cream.  

For the veggies, I used zucchini, snow peas, ½ a tomato, carrots, and canned potato. Like other reviewers, I definitely recommend using canned potato if you don't want to wait around for regular potatoes to cook. If you like paneer in your korma like I do, you can cheat and add cubes of queso blanco in the last 5 minutes of cooking, it kicks the dish up a notch!

The only other thing I was missing in this dish was a more cashew-y flavor to the sauce. Instead of grinding the cashews, next time I would make them into a paste (maybe with ginger and a little bit of oil) so the nutty flavor is infused in the curry. The little bits of cashew in the sauce just didn't work for me. But this is just an idea, I haven't tried it yet. Overall expect to experiment quite a bit with this recipe, but it's good to start with!

This recipe was ok.  I used coconut milk instead of cream - it may be better with cream.  Not out-of-this-world great.  Next time I think I'll sub in cauliflower for the potatoes.

I recently went vegetarian and I absolutely loved this recipe. I added some garam masala at the  same time as I added the curry powder and I think that is what made the recipe amazing. If you dont know what garam masala is, look up a recipe. Thats what I did. Its just a mixture of basic spices. Next time I make it I will be replacing the heavy cream  with coconut milk.

So delicious! My family and I love this. No need to go out for Indian food when you can make this excellent dish at home. EDIT: We have made this many times and always enjoy it. I double the recipe so we'll have savory leftovers the next evening. Also, I increase the curry to taste and add a bit of Turmeric, which makes this dish taste even better.

Thank you for this recipe! I thoroughly enjoyed it! Like others I used coconut milk instead of cream and put it in there with the potatoes, carrots, and curry for 5 minutes before I put the cashews and jalapeño. I then cooked that for another 15 minutes so that the potatoes could get cooked enough. Maybe my cubes are a little bigger! Turned out delicious!

As someone new to cooking with curry, I was apprehensive.  But, the flavors were great together.  It is almost like a comfort food, which isn't easy to accomplish in a vegetarian dish.  I do have to call bs on the cook time: WAY longer than 10 minutes.  I will be making this again for sure.

As good as I get in the Indian Restaurant! Loved this! The only change I made, was using light cream, rather than heavy cream. I cut all the vegetables the day before (except for the potatoes), which saved alot of time the day of cooking. Served over rice and enjoyed it very much! I will defanitley make this again! I also passed the recipe to my sister, who is a vegetarian.

So very yummy. I took the advice of other reviews and cooked the potatoes longer. I also added paneer for some extra protein. Going to make this more.

This was such a flavorful dish! I made sure to cut up the patatoes quite small so they would cook quickly. The only change I made was I used plain yoghurt instead of heavy cream. So delicious!

Super Delish! Microwave the spuds for a couple minutes before throwing them in the pan. Be very liberal with the curry powder, add a little cumin and don't be afraid to cook it for a few extra minutes. My girlfriend loves it! And if you don't live with a vegetarian just substitute potatoes for chicken. Enjoy ;)

Absolutely amazing! Replace vegetable oil with coconut oil, and heavy cream with coconut cream and it is even better (and healthier)! Also, I use chopped celery instead of chopped onion (cause my son and I don't care for onions). I make this often and it never gets old. :)

I really like this recipe! I used a pot instead of a skillet for easier stirring. I added some water while I was cooking the potatoes and carrots, because the potatoes took a while to get tender. Every time it seemed like there was a risk of burning them, I would add a little bit more boiling water in the pot. I also added 1 cup of plain kefir together with the tomato sauce to balance the flavor. It really tastes great and my husband and I loved it!

This is a great and different recipe perfect for gluten free and vegetarian lovers. True indian flavor, lots and lots of vegetables which make up for the guilt from the cream.  I would have tried the whole healthy coconut milk thing but watched the video AFTER I went shopping so - too late for that option. I will say, I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and also substituted 1/2 teaspoon of ginger for the ginger root and did not use the garnish, still fabulous!! And, since every review talked about the potatoes not cooking, I put them in my microwave steamer for 7 minutes prior to adding them to the saucepan. Solved that problem. Oh and I also used some canned pickled jalepenos I had from a friend instead of the fresh one - a great and different recipe. My first indian dish at 49 - a success!

Delicious! I also used coconut milk as mentioned in other reviews and added it early to help cook the potatoes faster. Definitely will make this again and again!

I love this recipe. It tastes very similar to the korma at my favorite Indian restaurant. I don't care for peas, so I omit them. The potatoes do need quite a bit more cooking time than indicated. I tend to double the liquid ingredients as a personal preference. The base is excellent for a number of variations.

Very tasty. It takes quite a bit longer for the potatoes to cook, however. We went shy on the tomato sauce due to personal preference.

Very good! I enjoyed this; the aroma, the gorgeous colors, the spices. But as others have said, it definitely requires a lot more heat. I added turmeric, garam masala, and lots more curry than called for and it still could have used more. I will also use 2 cups of coconut milk instead of 1 next time which will increase the yummy sauce. And there WILL be a next time...

This was so wonderful even my picky boys eat it up and asked for more.  The only thing I changed is in place of the heavy cream I used one can of coconut milk.  This recipe was so easy and will definitely be put on our monthly winter menu.

I made this "somewhat" (big smile) exactly as written and it was fabulous. One thing to note is that it says a *4oz* can of tomato sauce. If you read the recipe, that makes things much easier. I, on the other hand, decided to dump a 15.5 oz can in and then had to backtrack. It was still delicious, but I bet it will be even better when I get it right the first time. And, yes, I agree with others that the potatoes took longer than 10 min, but I suspect that has something to do with how big you cut up the cubes of potatoes and carrots in the first place.

I was excited about this recipe because I love vegetarian korma, but there was something missing. I followed the recipe as written, except I only used one potato. Two potatoes is just way too much. I like things with crunch so next time I might add more cashews. The kormas I have had at my favorite Indian restaurants have a sweet element to them. I feel like the recipe needs a sweet fruit maybe a cranberry or a grape.

Very good and authentic tasting.  A lot of potatos so definitely no need for any extra starch.  I might omit the bell peper next time, add less potato, and maybe some cubed tofu.  All together, delicious and a good base recipe for trying different ingredients in korma.

This recipe was not a big hit.  I added coconut milk like others suggested which helped but this recipe still needs something else.  I just cannot figure out what it is.  Just kind of bland.  I'm going to try again though!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This Korma is absolutely to die for! Great base recipe. I did as the other reviewers suggested, I sauteed my spices along with the onions, ginger and garlic. I used Curry, Garam Marsala and Tumeric. I doubled the recipe. The Coconut Milk gave it a silky gravy. Everyone on Facebook and Instagram were asking for the recipe. Sadly, it is all gone. I will be making more this weekend. 6 STARS!

4oz of tomato sauce isn't enough.  Either cook carrots and potatoes without anything else or add more sauce and/or water/liquid of some sort. 
I added some saffron, just for my taste and instead of jalapeno I added a pepperoni; just because that's what I had on hand.  I also added extra firm tofu at the end.  And served it with naan, rice, spicy chili garlic sauce and limes as well as the cilantro.
Really liked it, my husband did as well.  After trying it the kids thought it was good. (A 3 year old and 10 year old.)

I love this recipe! It's easy and reminded my husband and me of our favorite Indian dishes. I didn't modify the recipe at all, except for leaving the seeds in the jalapeño....spicy! The curry was really flavorful and had all the right veggies and spices. I loved how easy it was too...a one pot meal! I think next time, we will try adding chicken!

Great flavor. I needed to cook a lot longer than the recipe called for and still wound up with undercooked potatoes and peppers. But great flavor.

FANTASTIC! Kids and husband loved it! I used Spirited Sarah's spice mix in place of plain curry: 3 1/2 tsp curry powder, 2 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1 1/4 tsp turmeric, 3/4 tsp ground cardamom, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg, and a dash of ground cloves. I also used full-fat Thai Kitchen coconut milk for the cream. The potatoes took a long time to cook so I added the cream earlier and cooked it 10 min. longer. I also omitted the tomato sauce since we were out. SO good over brown rice. And gluten free and dairy free. Thank you!

This recipe was so great! My family and I loved it! I ended up using walnuts instead of cashews, just because that was all I had on-hand, and I only used 3 teaspoons of curry powder, because my 5-year-old doesn't like her food "too spicy". Other than that, I made the recipe exactly. Delicious! I will definitely make this again.

Just made this for dinner...delicious!!! I followed other reviewers' suggestions: replaced cream with a can of light coconut milk (and added it at the same time as the tomato sauce so there was extra liquid to help cook the veggies), added some cauliflower, and only used one large russet potato (other reviewers made me nervous that it wouldn't cook in a timely fashion, so I microwaved it first, then peeled it and cut it, then added it a little later in the recipe). Too lazy to embellish the spices and glad I didn't...the curry powder tasted great! I did have to add a little extra liquid at the end (used the skim milk I had on hand).  We will definitely put this recipe in our favorites file.

For the calories consumed it was ok, but I can think of lots of recipes that I would prefer.  However, I needed to use up  some of the ingredients that were in this recipe, so I tried it. My husband said it was ok.  I liked the taste of the finished product, just not the calories.

Really enjoyed this recipe!  I steamed the carrots and potatoes separately (based on a suggestion from someone else who said it takes longer than 10 minutes for them to cook), and I didn't at the paste.  I served it over rice and it was delish!

This was awesome! The only thing I did differently was in addition to the cashews the recipe calls for, I added a bunch of whole cashews & it was SO yummy. :) Im a beginner when it comes to cooking (but not eating) Indian food, & this was so easy & turned out great. Thank you for the recipe!

First of all - thank you very much for the recipe!!!!!!!!!

It has introduced me to the world of traditional Indian cooking. I have made this Veggie Korma probably ~20-30 times since i started cooking it 2 years ago. LOTS of flavor and very easy to make. I replaced cream with coconut milk (i try to avoid dairy products when i can) but otherwise i still use the same proportions/ingridients. Sometimes i use tomato paste or sauce + tomatoes. 

The flavor is awesome. Some reviewers below who say its bland did not follow the recipe or used bad ingredients (spices). If your spices are sitting in the cabinet 1year + you have to throw them away!! Most flavor is gone already! Use good spices!

Made it for someone else and we both found it a little bland.  We needed to add extra spices.  Also, the potatoes took three times as long to cook as the recipe calls for, so factor that in when planning.

Very close to what you find in a restaurant.  As far as the potatoes go, if you're using russet, one is sufficient, not two.

One of my favorite curry dishes!  The only things different I did was omit the jalapeño ( I didn't have any), ad used cocnonut milk instead of the cream.  I really loved this dish!  Hearty and healthy!  Thanks!

This was so delicious.  I can't wait to make it again.  I only changed two things......I used cayenne pepper because jalapenos don't agree with my husband, and I used canned coconut milk instead of the cream. I LOVE this recipe.

I have made this a dozen times and each time it is fantastic.  It is foolproof.  I always use regular full fat canned coconut milk instead of cream and it comes out AMAZING!  Regarding the potatoes yes they take 20 m. longer to cook and the carrots too.  I suggest putting the cut up potatoes and carrots in a sautee pan with 1/2 c. of water and cook with a lid while you're working on the other part of the recipe, this will speed up your cooking considerably.  And keep all the curry in it, it really needs the spice.  Or cut up the potatoes and carrots smaller. Tastes even better the next day.

This was good.. The seasoning didn't seem quite right and the carrots were still crunchy even though I cut them small and cooked it extra long. Next time I think I'll just leave them out.

VERY tasty!!  As suggested by others, I added a little more curry powder & ginger then what the recipe called for. I also added some cumin, a little cinnamon and cayenne pepper to add more flavor. I used fat free half & half instead of heavy cream and it was still super yummy, didn't miss the heavy cream at all. I poured this over brown rice but would have preferred brown basmati rice. I didn't have Naan so I rubbed a bit of butter on some plain flour tortillas and sprinkled with garlic powder. Set the tortillas in broiler for 4 minutes until they puffed up and they were perfect for this dish!  My husband loved this and it was all super easy & inexpensive.

This recipe was so delicious! The ONLY problem i had was that the potatos and carrots took forever to cook. More like 30 minutes before adding the cream. Next time i will parboil them ahead of time. Also add the cream little by little otherwise you will have to simmer it longer too so that it can reduce. The flavour was amazing and i will definately make this again.

Delicious. I took the advice of some of the reviews and used coconut milk instead of cream. The flavor isn't quite what you get in Indian restaurants and I'm not sure what's missing, but it definitely is a delicious substitute. I cooked the potatoes ahead of time and next time, I think I'll cook the carrots first. I didn't use jalapeno because my fiance can't really do spicy. I'll probably experiment a bit next time to figure out how to get a stronger flavor, but I think this will be one of my go-to recipes for sure.

Indian cuisine is one of our favorites, so I was super excited to try this recipe!  It turned out better than I expected!  My one issue was getting the potatoes to cook.  I used two heaping spoonfuls of hot curry powder and one spoonful of maharajah curry powder (I buy mine from Penzey's, super worth it, very flavorful!!) Next time, I'm thinking about omitting the potatoes and using garbanzo beans instead. I also think I will take note of a few of the other suggestions and use coconut milk instead of heavy cream and adding cauliflower to the mix.

Absolutely delicious.  My friends are kind of picky, so I used peppers, onions, sugar snap peas, and asparagus as my veggies.  I agree with others on the cooking time for the potatoes - they take much more than 10 minutes.

Really very good and super easy. Will definitely make this again. However, I sensed something was missing once I began eating--raisins. It definitely lacks a sweet element. Other than that, absolutely wonderful!

for me personally just a little bit too salty- but still a really great dish, especially awesome since the ingredients are so readily available and don't require a trip to a specialty store.

This was a FABULOUS dish. I'M a vegetarian who's starting to expand her horizons and try different dishes from every part of the world. Loving Indian cuisine I found this gem while search for a new dinner idea. I must admit I had to tweak the recipe a bit, I added more curry, red crushed peppers, pepper & additional salt, cauliflower, mushrooms and tofu. It came out wonderful. This recipe receives a 5 star from me and my husband who was stuffed by the time he was able to see the bottom of his bowl. Thank you for sharing. C. love Jordan

Admittedly, I did make some changes suggested by other reviewers, but this was awesome!  I increased the curry to 2 tbsp, added a sprinkle of garam masala and about 1/2 tsp cumin.  I substituted light coconut milk for the heavy cream and added about 3/4 c cauliflower with the peas (but next time will add a few min earlier).  I found that I needed to add some water while the potatoes were cooking to keep them from sticking and drying out.  Next time I will add a little more garlic & cashews.  Fantastic!!

Using coconut milk (as the video suggested) left the korma slightly more watery than the kind I have in Indian restaurants but it was still very delicious!

Loved it! The flavors are amazing and compliment each other so well.  I suggest adding the full 14 oz. can of light cocnut milk - really makes the korma creamier and comliments the curry and ginger nicely.  I think next time I will add a little more ground cashew.  Pairs well with a malbec ;)

This recipe is AWESOME!  We've have had the real thing and this is very close to it.  The only thing to mention would be that if you like your Indian food to be a little spicy, you'll need to add more to it because this recipe is very mild. I made it for valentine's day and I got 2 thumbs up from the wife! :-)

We tried this tonight.  I liked it a lot. It is not overly spicy. Only thing we changed was to use half and half.  My daughter makes this often and says its even better with whole cream. We ate this with basmati rice and garlic naan.  We had 2 hungry couples and there was a little left over, so the servings on this recipe are right on.

Cook onions, garlic, and ginger on skillet. Mix in blender with carrots, jalapeno, cashews, and sauce. Cook potatoes, peas, peppers, salt, curry, and cream in skillet. Add pureed mix. Cook until potatoes are tender.

At first I thought cilantro garnish on an Indian dish was different, but after trying it, decided it really made the dish. Having lived in India for a few months, I would have to say that it did not taste 100% Indian to me, but definitely pretty close and I liked that I could make it using easy to find ingredients. I think I'd like to try it with coconut milk someday, and I did use powdered ginger. I'm sure fresh would be much  better. Overall it was pretty good and a enjoyably different way to use up some potatoes and carrots.

This was very tasty.  I will probably leave out the jalapeno next time as it was a little too spicy for my 2-year old. *Update* Made this again and my 2-year old is now 5. Neither of my kids liked this meal but my husband and I loved it. I took a recommendation and used a can of coconut milk instead of milk. I also used a cup of leftover diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce as I didn't have any. It turned out amazing.

I thought this recipe was pretty good with the changes that other reviewers suggested. I felt like some spice was missing - I didn't have coriander and didn't add as much curry as others suggested so maybe that made a difference.

Changes/Additions:
1 tsp garam masala,
2 tbsp curry powder,
2 tsp cumin,
1 tsp salt.
Yukon potatoes,
Canned green chile peppers instead of jalapeno,
No tomato sauce,
Added 1 cup coconut milk and 2 tbsp plain yogurt,
No green peas,
No green pepper.

I steamed the carrots and potatoes separately, as some reviewers said it took a long time to cook those if just added to the skillet.
I cooked the onions with the spices.
Then added ginger, garlic and cooked for a few minutes.
Added rest of ingredients except red bell pepper and cooked for 10 min.
Added red bell pepper and simmered for another 5 minutes.
Served with steamed broccoli to add a green vegetable to my meal. Next time I'll serve with basmati rice or naan bread to temper the aftertaste of the spices.

Solid base. Forget the cream, replace it with a can of coconut milk. Definitely play around with the seasoning-- whoever suggested the cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander, cloves combo was GENIUS. I halved the jalapeno so my 9 year old wouldn't freak out, and it still had a great flavor you could feel on your tongue after the meal was over. Also tossed in some mushrooms in the last 10 minutes. Next time, RAISINS! I used baby Dutch potatoes, quartered them, and STILL found them a little firm, so adding the coconut milk right away might not be a bad idea to cook them fully. The flavor is fantastic, and it's a warm and wonderfully filling dish even without meat in it (but my 11 year old requests chicken next time.)

So, so good! This was one of the yummiest dinners I've ever made. I followed the suggestion to add some more spices but stuck with the cream (not coconut milk). I made sure to dice the potatoes nice and small (each piece about the same size as 2-3 peas), and they cooked in exactly 10 minutes. I used the whole 8-oz can of tomato sauce because I love tomatoes. And I cooked the green peppers separately--I hate them, but I wanted my husband to be able to add them into his serving. I'll definitely make this again.

Awesome, delicious, easy, wow! I loved it. I prefer stronger flavors than than what is called for so the second time around I added more jalapeno, more nuts, more cumin, more giner, more garlic. I also recommend adding a little more cream if you prefer more sauce (as I do).

Good introduction to cooking Indian style at home. I used coconut milk instead of cream, and threw in some green beans and a few chunks of sweet potato. The one jalapeno was not enough for my taste--I might use one of the smaller, hotter peppers next time. I added the prepared curry powder before the tomato sauce, and stirred it around for a minute or two with the onion, garlic, and ginger, to take some of the "raw" taste off of it. Next time I will use the component spices individually.

This was pretty tasty!  I liked it a lot, but it wasn't as creamy and nutty as the korma I get at my favorite Indian restaurant.  I will do a few things differently next time, like using coconut milk instead of cream, and I might also add more cashews.  I'll make it again.

This was excellent!  I used coconut milk instead of cream and it was perfect!  Also, I omitted the jalapeno only because I'm breastfeeding, so can't do too much spice.  I've made it several times now and it's so good! Great over jasmine or basmati rice!

My husband is a very picky eater as is my father. I made this tonight and they both really liked it. I had some frozen corn leftover from the other night, so I tossed that in as well (with a healthy dash of cumin.I made quinoa (boiled with vegetable broth, not water)and mixed it right into the main serving dish. I baked naan bread until crispy for those who wanted it. I omitted the cilantro, but I served with a simple side salad. Delicious, spicy, slightly sweet: a keeper for sure.

Delicious...I added 1/2 cup of yogurt and 1/2 cup of cream instead of 1 cup of cream. I didn't have curry powder so I used garam masala and turmeric. Also I added paneer. Was really awesome!

This was excellent, though it did take a lot longer for the potatoes to cook than 10 minutes (about 30 minutes) and I even cut them very small.  I'd recommend cooking this in a pan with a lid so that you can put the lid on when the potatoes cook to avoid too much moisture loss.  The first time I did this, I kept having to put water in the pan to keep things from drying out and sticking to the bottom.  I made this since and found that again the potatoes took a long time to cook even when cut in 1/4" cubes.

Good as-is, but I have also modified to use coconut milk.  This a great flexible recipe - I add or remove the veggies depending on what I have!

This recipe is a good baseline but it needs a lot more spice to really work. Garam masala and cardamom were good additions.

Great, but read the reviews for helpful advice. Coconut milk is a great choice instead of cream. Add it at the same time you add the vegetables so they will cook faster. Yummy! One of my favorite dishes.

Very tasty!  Love the cilantro, don't forget it!   I replaced the potatoes with tofu.   I also added a bit of Cajun seasoning for that extra kick.

I am a student and need quick, easy recipes. This recipe took me under 30 minutes to prepare and it was very tasty. I will definitely make it again, possibly adding a few extra spices.

I have to admit I changed this recipe a little but it was great and would probably be great without the changes.  I added more veggies and used coconut milk instead of heavy cream and no tomato sauce.  I added a little vegetable broth during the part of the recipe where you are supposed to put in the tomato sauce so there would be some moisture to cook with.  I also added some tofu.  Fabulous dinner.

Overall, the recipe turned out quite well. 

I made a couple of edits based on the recommendations here: Substituted 3% yoghurt for heavy cream, skipped tomato sauce and put in one fresh tomato instead, and added more spices (turmeric, cardamom, cumin).

The potatoes definitely have to be cooked first (or, for convenience, microwaved).

My family doesn't like peppers.  I left them out and just added more carrots, potatoes and peas.  Rave reviews from the family.

Delicious recipe.  Highly suggest making this maybe a day before you actually plan to eat it.  Just like chili, spaghetti sauce, etc., the flavors seem to develop over time.  Made this for dinner, didn't seem very impressive, then had it for lunch the next couple of days and each day it just tasted better and better.  The potatoes and carrots do need longer than 10 minutes to cook.

SO GOOD! A favorite in our house. 

If I don't have cashews I use peanuts and turns out yummy as well. I have also used different kinds of fresh chili peppers instead of jalapeño and it always turns out great. 

The cilantro garnish definitely tops it off and adds a nice fresh contrast to the creamy dish.

Based on the way this is written, you will either end up eating raw potatoes or cooking it for >1hr regardless of what type of potatoes you use. Cook the potatoes before you start and add them later in the cooking process.

I made this last night and it was delicious!!  I added 3 medium potatoes and didn't add the cashews. I also added some red pepper for spice. Next time I want to try it with coconut milk instead of the heavy cream. My family loved it!

This tasted ok, I used cconut milk as others suggested and it tasted more Thai than Indian.  I will keep looking for a better veg karma.

Per other reviewers' suggestions, I substituted a 14 oz can of lite coconut milk for the heavy cream (adding some of it earlier in the cooking process than stated to increase the liquid, and help cook the veggies), and increased the tomato sauce to a 14 oz. can. I'd recommend reducing the potato to one, if it is large. Increasing the bell pepper amount to at least one of each color would be my preference. If you're not big on spice, I'd recommend taste testing a very little bit of the jalapeno pepper before assuming that one whole one is the proper amount as pepper strength can vary; the one I used last night was very strong compared to some so I used only 1/4 of it and it was good for our family. Lastly, I added a 15 oz. can of chickpeas to up the protein content. Thanks for the recipe. We will make it again!

This recipe was good, but I wasn't blown away. Per other commetner's suggestion, I used a can of coconut milk instead of the cream. I also simmered it for 20 minutes to ensure that the potatoes would fully cook. I served it with Basmati rice and would make it again.

Excellent, authentic flavors! I did use lite coconut milk in place of the cream and coconut oil for the vegetable. This does take more than ten minutes to cook the potatoes, but this is a delicious recipe. I've made it twice in a week I liked it so much!

This was a wonderful recipe. I of course, made a few changes. I omitted the jalepeno pepper because it would have been too hot for my kids. I also omitted the peas because I didn't have any but I think it would have been better with. Used ground ginger instead of fresh and it worked great. I also used chopped cashews instead of ground. I like that because it added a little texture. Overall a GREAT recipe!

Fairly easy to make and it was tasty :) The one change I made was only using 1/2 cup of heavy cream and replacing the other half with plain yogurt. I will probably make this again!

Fantastic.  Used coconut milk instead of cream; Frank's Finest curry spice blend, ~ 1/2 - 1 tsp finely chopped jalapeno instead of sliced (accidently chopped instead of sliced). Serve over quinoa for better flavor (and more nutrition) than rice (alternately can serve over millet or freekah).

This was delicious! I served it with brown rice,  added more nuts, and substituted coconut milk for the heavy cream.  I think next time I'll grind more cashews to sprinkle on the top for serving.  For my taste I think I'll add a little more ginger too.  Overall, great vegetarian meal!

This is a keeper!  I added zucchini, broccoli, doubled the amount of peppers (red and orange), and used coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  I served it over rice (I use 3 parts brown rice to 1 part basmati).  This was a hit!

Love this! Made it vegan. Used coconut spread to sauté. Blended 1 can coconut milk with 1 TBS red curry paste. Added that when it says add cream. Didn't use cashews or jalapeño so my kids could enjoy too. Also didn't have ginger, but it wasn't missed.

I made this recipe just as it states, no changes. 
This was REALLY good! My picky eaters loved it, as well as my husband. My daughter's friends (normally meat eaters) were over and they even loved it (had seconds!)
Will certainly make it again.

I doubled the recipe but because I only had one jalapeno, I added a bit of cayenne for more spice. I did use the tomato sauce and took the recommendation of using coconut milk. The potatoes were still a bit firm but they did finish cooking in the coconut milk. I also added a touch of cumin. It's a cross between indian and thai curry but it's delicious! Will definitely make it again. Next time, will use less potatoes and serve over brown rice. Delish!

Always a hit at my house, I do substitute the cream for a dairy free version.  All in all my non vegetarian friends love this recipe.

Very delicious meal! My husband and I are by nature carnivores and have recently made the commitment to eating at least 2-3 vegetarian meals a week! This recipe will definitely be added to the keep pile :) A few changes, I followed the advice of other reviews and used milk instead of the cream and tomato sauce, I also added eggplant for texture. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband said "who needs to go out for Indian, this is great."  I left out the cashews (nut allergy) and used 2 cups of cream.  Best recipe I've made so far!

This is an incredibly delicious recipe. I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions and used 1 cup of unsweetened coconut milk instead of heavy cream. I used cayenne instead of jalapeno and I actually boiled the potatoes to about 75% done and added them in at the required step. Other than these slight modifications the Korma turned out to be divine!
Thank you so much for sharing it with us.

Super easy and really delicious.  Even my die-hard meat eater roommates loved it, and everyone who came by that evening for a visit asked for a bowl because it was so fragrant.  I used half cream and half coconut milk, and did add a little salt.

This is soooo good! Hearty, satisfying, and interesting to the taste buds. I did use some of the other reviewers' suggestions and used coconut milk instead of the heavy cream, added garam masala and turmeric, and threw in some garbanzo beans to add some protein... even my picky kids (ages 3 & 5) liked it!

Definitely boil the carrots and potatoes first.  I use half heavy cream and half coconut milk but don't skip the heavy cream altogether - it makes the dish.

Hard to stop eating! I increased cream to two cups, and used 8 oz of tomato sauce, because I like a lot of sauce. Will definitely make again.

Best Indian recipe I've cooked so far! Boiled potatoes 10 minutes prior, but will boil longer next time. Replaced heavy cream with equal parts coconut milk and plain yogurt. Added extra spices (nutmeg, garam masala, pepper,etc...), cauliflower, braised fresh spinach, a tomato, slivered almonds, golden raisins.  Awesome.

This is tasty.  Cream is too high fat, so we used evaporated skim milk and it was delicious.  A great dish for a potluck.

This was yummy and flavorful! I took other reviewers advice and exchanged the tomato sauce and cream for 1 1/2 of coconut milk. I accidentally used 2 tablespoons of curry but it was great, next time i"l use more jalapeno for a lil more kick. I would also cut the potatoes much much smaller so they cook faster.

This was a stellar recipe.  My husband, who refuses to take leftovers to work, took the leftovers to work!  It was very easy, great flavor, and a nice subtle heat from the jalapeños.  I thought I had cashews, but I didn't so I used peanuts, I bet the cashews would be even better.  Also, I served ours over noodles.

this was amazing, I loved it and was met with rave reviews from our dinner guests.  Can't wait to make it again.  Only changes I made was to omit the cashews as my husband is allergic, substituted coconut milk for the cream and used a whole 8oz can of tomato sauce as I couldn't find a 4oz can.  I would recommend par boiling the potatoe's 1st, mine cooked for approx 1 1/2 hrs and were still very al dente.

Very Good and delicious .. will make again. I used baby gold potatoes instead of russets to make prep time faster, and rather then using half green and red pepper I used all red because I find the green bellpeppers to be a bit on the bitter side

This Meat-Lover Loves It

This is a vibrant celebration of natures bounty, it is filling and delicious...you really do not miss the meat, and I eat meat all the time (no way am I a vegetarian, it's just my wife wanted to try a meatless dish). 

Oh - and by the way - no meat just happens to = super inexpensive!!

Reheats beautifully for top-notch leftovers (I put a handful of the chopped fresh cilantro over my white rice, so that I can remove it before microwaving the dish, and replace it "uncooked" before eating...perfect...many stares and compliments).

This will be a solid do-again for us. Maybe not daily or weekly, but once a month for sure.

ONLY EDIT would be my potato chunks needed to cook longer. They were typically 3/4" to 1" cubes, so either reduce the chunk size or cook longer (probably prefer the latter, longer cook time) to ensure more tender potatoes. Probably another ten mins. Well worth it though.

This was widely liked by all of my guests. I did use an entire red and orange pepper as well as added more milk to make it a little more saucy. We put it over rice and it worked great. Ill be sure to make it again!

I used a recipe Good but needs more spice.  I gram marsala, an extra jalapeno,  and an extra red chili pepper and still not spicey enough.  I will add a can of green chilies next. :)

This is a wonderfully fragrant and tasty dish! My family is moving toward a flexitarian lifestyle, so we are trying to add more vegetarian dishes to our meal choices, and this one is the most flavorful we have tried so far!
I did substitute a can of coconut milk for the heavy cream and added some garam masala with the curry powder.
Once again, GREAT dish!!!

Had to play with the spices a bit like the other reviewers but definitely gives you a good place to start. I added cauliflower in lieu of potatos because I do not like the starch.  I also added edamame beans in place of the peas because they are not my families favorite.  These changes were due to our personal taste but the dish turned out awesome!!!

Absolutely delicious, and simple to make! A wonderful recipe! Can also be converted to vegan-friendly by substituting cashew cream for the heavy cream. Gives it a nice, nutty, sweet-spicy flavor.

Oh my - this recipe is soooo good.  I make it with lite coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  Also often use red chillies instead of jalapeno for a little more spice. I have found that yellow potatoes or sweet potatoes cook a lot faster than white potatoes in it taste great.  Also have often added chick peas.  Sometimes will add some diced up chicken to change it up as well.  It's a favorite in our house!!

This recipe was ok, but definitely nothing like the korma I've had in restaurants. Like others have said, you have to precook the potatoes. I also had to add a lot of spice. Made it according to directions, but it seemed pretty bland and not very spicy. So I added quite a bit more curry powder, cayenne, and chili flakes. Overall I'm kind of disappointed after all the great reviews.

The flavors were awesome! I used plain yogurt instead of cream. I did not add the jalapeno. The potatoes need to be cooked longer than the recipe states.

This tasted great!  I've made this a few times now and both times I followed other reviewers' advice and used an entire can of light coconut milk in replacement of the tomato sauce and heavy whipping cream.  I had to cook it for almost 1/2 hour to get the potatoes to cook all the way.  Although the recipe is VERY tasty, I gave it 4 stars because the cook time is not accurate.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will continue to use!

The easiest Indian I've ever made. Indian cooking is an acquired skill and I used to believe that you had to be born there in order to make any edible curry. Not so with this dish. I did not add any jalepenos and it was still spicy enough. Pretty simple ingredients for Indian and just super tasty. There were no leftovers all three times I've cooked it so far!! Thank you.

This recipe lived up to the ratings. I changed it up a little bit. First, I used half a can of light coconut milk in place of the heavy cream. Also, I omitted the jalepeno knowing younger eaters wouldn't like it spicy. I cooked the potatoes in the microwave first before adding to the pan. I used ground ginger instead of fresh minced. This would also be good with some chick peas and perhaps leaving out the crunchier bell peppers. My only complaint is that it is too labor intensive for a weeknight after work type meal.

I enjoyed this recipe. Made the dish as directed except I had to omit the jalapeno for my 2yr old but I added a little cayene pepper later to my own plate. Would like to make it w/ the jalapeno next time and use coconut milk instead.

This recipe is so incredibly tasty! Make sure to source some high-quality curry spice. The only amendment to the recipe we'd make is to cook the potatoes and carrots longer than 10 mins. Depending on how thick you slice them, they will need more time to soften.

This recipe is fantastic. A can of diced tomatoes can be used in lieu of tomato sauce and red pepper. I also prefer it with yams over potatoes. And I use half and half to make it a little less rich. I think it is better that way. I also like to add more cashews, I think I add more like 5 tbls. Quick and delicious. Really fast for indian food. :)

This is a great recipe - just a couple of things that I changed.  First, the potatoes and carrots do not cook thoroughly in the skillet in 10 minutes.  So I boiled the potatoes and carrots until they were tender before adding them to the skillet.  Also, I added garbanzo beans to the recipe for some protein.  Yum!!

4 stars as is, 5 with changes.  I recommend adding more cashews for the amount of korma this makes - about 3/4 c is good.  2 t salt is way too much, especially with the added cashews but even without.   I found the consistency nicer with about 1/2 c tomato sauce, and I used nonfat Greek yogurt rather than cream.  Absolutely delicious ... and healthy!

This was simply delicious (and very easy to make!) and warms me up on a cold winter day. The only thing I did differently was cooked the potatoes a little longer. Next time, I will use coconut milk to taste the difference from heavy cream. I will make this for my husband when he comes home. Thank you for the recipe!

I've made this recipe twice in the last 2 weeks and I love it. It's so easy and delicious. The first time I made it for my boyfriend, I used less potato and added some baby squash and substituted the cream with rice milk. The second time I made it for my parents with chicken. I used coconut milk this time and no green pepper.

Very good. I've made this several times with excellent results. I tend to add a bit more spices if I want something more flavour, because Korma is generally a little bland.

Yummy - totally good recipe, probably not authentic, but who cares.  Used powdered ginger because the fresh in the store was pathetically dry and gnarly - good substitution.  Also added paneer - GREAT.  Needed to cook much longer than recommended, but c'est la vie!

This recipe was okay! I didn't have the cashews on hand so I'm not sure if that would have made a significant difference. I substitued the cream for coconut milk.

This recipe is quite good. When I was putting it together I kept thinking that it had too many ingredients; I was surprised by how tasty it turned out.   My fiancee is from India and he loved this recipe. It will certainly become a regular dish in our home.

I used can of tomato juice and about 3/4 of a pureed tomato in place of the sauce.  Used about 1.5 teaspoons salt.  Replaced cream with whole can of lite coconut milk--boiled to reduce liquid.  (This makes fat/serving about 9 grams if it's 5 servings.)  Needs to preboil potatoes so they will cook faster.

Based on other comments, I first tried a modified version of this recipe.  I'm not an experienced cook, so when my wife said "Honey, this is really good" I was pleased!  This is a very warming, comfort-type food, which will be welcome during our cold winters.   I left out the peas and tomato sauce and subbed lite coconut milk for the heavy cream.  Next time I make this I might try using 1/2 the tomato sauce and 1/2 the salt (you can always add more salt to taste after serving).  I would imagine you could also incorporate any mild-tasting soft vegetables (cauliflower, turnips, rutabaga, mushrooms, etc.)

I made this as directed, with the exception of homemade Jalapeno hot sauce instead of the fresh jalapeno (didn't have any).By the end of cooking, I thought it was very good, but missing something. I added some cumin, tumeric, ground ginger, and paprika. Served it over jasmine rice - the wife and kids (4 & 6) absolutely loved it. I added more jalapeno sauce, salt and pepper to mine, but I like things spicier. Will definitely make this again!!! Thanks!

This was a pretty easy dish to make because you just basically throw everything into the pan. Most of the time came from prepping and then waiting.   My customizations: I added diced paneer, a teaspoon of garlic paste (vs. minced fresh garlic), a teaspoon of ginger paste, 8 oz. tomato sauce (vs. 4 oz), a cup of water, coconut milk (instead of heavy cream), a serrano (bc I didn't have jalapeno). I also added a few more veggies: mushrooms (bc I love them), cauliflower, zuchini.   Also added a bit more salt to taste.

Love this dish! My husband said he didn't like Indian food... but I changed his mind with this dish. I took advice from previous reviews and added curry powder with the onions so that the dish had more time to absorb all the spice.

While this is not a Korma it still is a decent Indian curry if you double the curry powder. Will try again with coconut milk instead of the tomato sauce.

This is really good.  I used coconut milk in place of cream and added chicken, but that's the only alteration.  My husband (who is English) said it's as good as a curry from a restaurant (maybe better).  It really didn't need the chicken, but I think I discovered when eating this that I'm not a huge fan of chic peas, so I may fully substitute chicken for chic peas or just reduce the amt of chic peas next time.  Or not...  chic peas are good for you and it really was nice as is.  Matter of personal preference really.

My husband is from Bangladesh so I tried this when his dad was visiting. We loved it and it was so easy to make. Normally I don't make changes but I did use nonfat yogurt instead of the cream to cut down the calories. I'm sure making it with cream would be heavenly!! It's great with rice, tortillas, naan or alone.

Delicious, and just like the navrattan curry i wanted to reproduce from my favourite indian restaurant. to my taste, substituted chopped snow peas for canned and broccoli for potato; for health, sustituted 1/2 lite coconut milk, 1/2 milk for heavy cream (but i'm sure sticking to the cream would be great). i'm truly thrilled with the outcome, having been searching for a good recipe for this dish for two years. thanks!

This was pretty good the first day but so much better the next day for lunch.  I used one can of lite coconut milk in place of the cream and instead of potato, I used 2 medium sized zucchini.  I also skipped the bell pepper and added half a bag of frozen cauliflower.  Next time I will add some cayenne pepper and try adding chicken.

This was pretty good. We were looking for a meatless meal for Lent, and settled on this recipe. Served over Basmati rice and with naan bread. I used olive oil, only 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp curry, coffee cream ("half-and-half" in the US) to reduce the fat content, and used fresh parsley as the garnish, but those were the only changes I made.

I thought it would be a good idea to cook the potatoes a little bit beforehand so they would be cooked all the way since so many people complained of them needing additional cooking time. Bad idea. They kinda turned to mush. But everything was so delicious. Since I had doubled the recipe, I used a cup of cream and also a can of coconut milk. The coconut milk is a MUST! Sooo good! Serve this over rice with some naan and you're good to go!

This was good! I have not had Indian food that much at all so I didn't know if I'd like it or not, but I did :) The only changes I made were that I halved it, I didn't have any bell pepper so I just used some extra potato, and I used coconut milk instead of cream. I served it with some garlic tandoori naan and I enjoyed it :)

Great recipe. The only variations on the recipes were that I left out  the peppers and needed to cook the potatoes for at least 1/2 hour before they were tender (not 10 min on my stove!).

This is a tasty and satisfying meal. You probably won't notice or miss the meat. This is also a good recipe for anyone who enjoys Indian cuisine but is wary of too much heat. Tips: don't cube the potato and carrot, cut them into bite sized pieces and boil them in a separate pot until "al dente," then add.  This will cut down on the total prep time.  I lucked out with the rice.  Don't sweat this part - basically in the end you'll want to heat the rice and the mixture together so the sauce incorporates with the rice and so it is all heated through.  I used lite coconut milk instead of heavy cream.

Very good!  My husband and I love Indian food, so being able to make it at home rather than going out is great.  Like other reviewers, I also used lite cocount milk and suited the veggies to my family's taste.  I added a can of chick peas as well for some protien and left out the potatoes. The only thing I'll do next time is leave out the jalepeno, since my kids said it was a little too spicy.  Thanks!

The first Indian dish I have ever made.  I am leary of many spices in Indian dishes but I really enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe with the exception of not adding the potatoes and I did add shrimp.  I also substituted coconut milk for the half and half as other reviewers suggested.  I used red curry - I never know what type of curry these recipes call for - yellow, red, etc.  I will make this again.

Wow!  This is a lot of work. But so worth it.  Everyone loves it.  I do make a few fine-tuning adjustments, such as substituting no fat plain yogurt for the heavy cream and doubling the tomato sauce, but it's simply delicious!

I made this recipe but with a bit of a twist. I substituted sweet potatoes for the normal kind, and I added chickpeas. I didn't have any carrots, so I threw in some broccoli. I also didn't have jalapenos, so I added crushed red chili peppers. Instead of heavy cream, I put in unsweetened coconut milk. I served it with jasmine rice, and it was AMAZING! I served it to vegetarians and non-vegetarians and they all loved it! I will definitely make again - This time I will stick to the recipe more to see if it turns out differently. YUM!

Absolutely loved this!!  I had a half can of lite coconut milk to use up and since so many commented on using that as opposed to heavy cream/tomato sauce, this recipe was my winner (and btw, loved the flavouring it added)!!  I did pre-cook my potatoes somewhat and also added the curry powder from the start of cooking the onions, garlic and ginger.  Served this over basmati rice and it was FANTASTIC!  My 2 year old son devoured some of the leftovers with me for lunch today!  Will make again for sure!

This was pretty good!  I did have issues with the potatoes taking a long time to cook, next time I will parboil them first.  I added chicken broth to deglaze the pan since it was getting burned bits on the bottom and then covered the pan for about 25 to cook the potatoes.  Since I added stock, I cut the cream by half, but I would like to try coconut milk next time.  I also added a bit of cayenne pepper for heat :)  Yum!

This is awesome!! Loved it, loved it!! Followed the advice of others and used lower fat coconut milk instead of heavy cream. Did not have any fresh ginger root so used ground ginger.

Delicious and flavorful dish! really enjoyed it.   I add extra cumin, paprika, and coriander to spice it up a little. Also added cayenne pepper since I like spicy food. Could had added a little more though.   Used a can of coconut milk following the recommendations of other reviewers. Also added a little over 5 oz. of tomato sauce. I should have just used the entire 8 oz. can I bought because I can't do much with the remains.   I think next time I might even dice up some tomatoes and add them to the mix.

This is Delicious!  BUT - you need to make modifications to make this recipe work, which is why I am giving it 4 stars.  You can't boil the potatoes and carrots without adding liquid.  I even chop mine up pretty small, no way. You have to add in water and boil it off.  Other than that  I did make one change.  I used canned Coconut Milk instead of the cream.  It was so yummy and Tasty, I think I will always make it that way.  I'm sure the original is just as good though!

I used butter potatoes and had no trouble getting them cooked in the alotted time.  Skipped out on the cilantro and it seemed like something was missing.  Also had to continue adding water throughout cooking because it kept getting dry, and I think saucy when I think Indian food.  Overall, delicious.

This is a really tasty recipe. I didn't use cream I used light coconut milk because I thought it would be a little better for you than heavy cream. Also, I thought the spices were a little weak, maybe next time I will add some garam masala or another pepper. But overall, it was tasty! Happy cooking!

This recipe made me a lover of korma.  I must admit that I veered a bit from the original recipe.  I doubled the cashews and added cauliflower.  I'm also not a huge fan of ginger so I cut that in half and added some cayenne.  SO GOOD!  I do cook this for much longer than is called for.  Ten minutes is just not long enough to cook the potatoes.  I will sometimes throw all the ingredients in the slow cooker and "forget about it" until it's time for dinner.

This is a really good recipe, but I added cinnamon, cumin, coriander, and a touch a paprika to give it a slightly more traditional taste. Otherwise, excellent!

I made some minor changes, (i.e. olive for veg oil, fire roasted chiles for japs, etc.) but I think this recipe base is so solid, no minor change you make is going to affect the outcome.  This is not a burn your mouth off dish, it's delicately spiced and delicious.

This recipe is sooo good, you have to try it! However if you're not eating meat on the side or something, you may want to add some canned garbanzo beans to this, I think it fits well in the recipe and it's good protein! Like some people I added a little coconut milk to this, but you can barely taste it, so next time I'm just using the cream.

Loved this and so did our 18 month old. Iused 8 oz of tomato suace because 4 would have been so dry. Potatoes took a little longer to cook mor elike 15-20 minutes instead of 10. I used cocunut milk instead and used a whole can instead of jsut one cup because it all seemed very dry and it came out wonderful! I also added some garam masala in addition to the curry powder and it was a great addition. Loved this~

This is a great recipe. I've used it several times and only made a few adjustments. I steamed the cubed potatoes in a separate pot before adding to the other ingredients. This cut down on the prep time. I also had some fresh spinach in the refrigerator and threw it in the skillet while simmering. The spinach added to the lovely appearance of this dish. My family loves this. Thanks.

Very delicious! I did make some changes - I cooked the curry powder in the oil for a few minutes at the very beginning.  I used whole bell peppers instead of halves, light coconut milk instead of cream, and I also threw in a teaspoon of cayenne pepper for some added kick!  I also needed to add a cup of water to cook the potatoes, but then I boiled and reduced this back down to the tomato sauce that was originally the only fluid in the mixture.  I really liked the coconut milk substitute - the subtle flavour it added was deeelicious, and the calorie and fat content of this recipe was greatly reduced.  Yum!! I expect it will be even more yummy tomorrow, as I have lots of leftovers!

I made this recipe last night for a vegeterian friend.  I ended up eating more than she did.  I'll try that coconut milk suggestion, but it would be hard to beat the heavy cream.  Delish...

Good recipe, but great once I added turmeric, cayenne, and ground ginger.  I also used almonds in place of the cashews because it is what I had on hand.  i think cashews would have been better.

As a new veggie, I tried this recipe out since it had a lot of stars. It didn't disappoint! Even my non-veg hubby loved it and my veggie friend. I used coconut milk instead of heavy whipping cream, which made it a bit more Thai. I also added broc and some other vegetables. YUM! Will do again for sure.

This was delicious! As usual, I measured the spices generously and was glad I did. Note that the potatoes take much longer than 10 minutes to cook, and I add a little milk to help them along. EDIT: I've made this recipe half a dozen times, and it is always excellent. Today I used coconut milk instead of cream and fresh tomatoes (pureed) instead of tomato sauce. Wow! So good!

Delicious recipe!  I used milk instead of cream to cut down on the fat content.  I also used a little more curry powder than the recipe suggested.  I precooked my carrots and potatoes in the microwave till they were about halfway done, then added them with everything else to simmer.

This is my first review ever, and after following most other peoples reviews I eliminated the tomato sauce and cream and substituted coconut milk. I also played with the spices by adding garam masala and cinnamon. My house officially smells like and Indian restaurant! I haven't even tasted it and i love it.

Very tasty. As others have said, plan for more time on the potatoes. I also added cauliflower, cayenne pepper, garam masala, and a bit more salt. Delicious!

very very good. i made couscous with toasted cumin seeds instead of rice. i used a can of coconut milk, some tomato paste and water as my liquids. i only used potatoes and beans and it was superb! thank you for the easy recipe! It took a little longer to cook, but was delicious.

Definately precook the carrots & potatoes or keep in mind it will take very long so have enough time! I left out the heavy cream and substituted w/ organic soy yogurt. I wanted to add coconut milk for the taste but decided against it for my heart and waistline. I played around w/ the spices adding in a teaspoon each of garam masala, cinnamon, and cardamon. Like others I added in the ground cashews. The resulting taste was very flavorful.  Good base recipe to play around w/ spices and veggies.

other than changing some of the veggies used, went with recipe as is. but with all Indian food it's always better 2 days later.

I didn't have any cream or coconut milk, so I added some yogurt. I also added, ground mustard, cinnamon and a touch of nutmed. I had whole canned tomatoes, so I used those instead of the tomatoe sauce. Also: I used sweet pas, because they were in my fridge and I needed to use them. The korma turned out great, although it was a little bit acidic because of the yogurt, so I added a bit of sugar. Will definately make it again :)

great recipe. I definitely would say that it is important to cook the potatoes longer than the ten minutes the recipes requires. It took me an extra 15-20 on top of that.   Then I would add the green peas and cream.

This recipe has what I consider authentic Indian taste. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and cooked the potatoes and carrots longer. Instead of heavy cream I used some light sour cream mixed with a little water - more like a yogurt consistency. I added some garam masala, a little cumin and some cinnamon, but otherwise this recipe has great flavor on its own. I served it with chapathi bread (like naan) and jasmine ricee. Great meal!

We loved this!!  It is the closest we've found to our favorite indian restaurant.  I added about 1 tsp. of turmeric, and added the curry and salt with the ginger and garlic.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the 10 minutes for the potatoes should be about 20 minutes or more.  We also made the chicken tikka masala off this site and had a great dinner!   Enjoy!

This is was awesome. My only suggestion would be cooking the potatoes a little longer than 10 minutes so they aren't still crunchy, but great otherwise.

5++!  This was wonderful!  We loved it, even more than I expected to.  With such simple ingredients and the only spice being curry powder I wasn't sure it would be flavorful enough but I was wrong!  I realized after I was done that I forgot to add the nuts-oops!  Results were still fantastic so didn't seem to matter.  I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and just a red bell which I added after the potatoes to make sure it was nice and soft.  This was a winner and I'll make it regularly!!

I, too substituted the coconut milk.  I also had to add liquid while cooking the potatoes as I went along.  It was almost like making potato risotto!  It turned out delicious, though.  Like others mentioned, it makes for great leftovers and adds a nice aroma to your kitchen while cooking!

this recipe worked ok for us.  it was good, not great.  the dish really lacked something that we all couldn't put our finger on... it just felt a little flat. like it needed some kind of spice at the end to really rev it up...hhmmm.

Used half a cup of coconut milk, half a cup of cream. Potatoes take way longer than 10 mins so allow time for that. All in all good recipe. Served over jasmine rice.

You should definitely add the curry powder at the beginning. Unfortunately the recipe is lacking in that it says potatoes and carrots "cubed" - how big? If they are cut into 1/4 inch cubes they cook OK. Coconut milk, not cream is the authentic way.

This was SO good! I plan to make it again with a substitute for cream to make it healthier. I chopped the potatoes and carrots in a small dice so they would cook thoroughly. My young kids even liked it.

We make this recipe frequently and it is a real favorite.  We leave out the Jalapeno so my kids don't complain and we use yogurt instead of the tomatoes.

This was excellent the first time I made it. I fallowed a few of the comments and made a few simple changes. I omited the heavy whipping cream and tomato sauce and used coconut milk in its place. I also used about 2 tsp read peppers and added an extra jalapeno for more spice. Next time I would precook the potatoes because they made this take an extra hour of cooking.

I couldn't believe how good this was because it's so simple!  I just threw in the veggies I had on hand (squash, baby bella mushrooms, carrots, peas, onion). I might try lentils next time. I cooked it a little longer than the recipe called for and the veggies were perfect.  This is a keeper!
2nd time around: I used coconut milk, a cup of chicken broth, and increased the spices so that we had more sauce. YUM!

Like many others, I used yogurt instead of the cream (and omitted the cashews). I prefer things spicier and used two jalapenos and a little extra curry powder.

Delicious and adapts well to changes!  I actually modified this quite a bit to make it friendly for young eaters - I did not use the jalapeno at all and didn't have any green/red peppers or cashews on hand - so those didn't go in either.  I subbed evaporated milk for the cream and added about 3 tablespoons of cream of coconut to get that added flavor.  All in all - went great with Tandori chicken and Cardamom-spiced rice and best of all - my 8 year old gobbled it up!

Lots of chopping, but oh so worth it. I left out the jalepeno and even my 12 yr old ate it. She was thrilled to have a vegetarian dish that the rest of the carnivores in the family would be happy to eat regularly.

This dish is lite and full of flavour.
A definite keeper.

This was great and a big hit!!!  Never cooked Indian food before and found this to be simple to make.  Replaced the heavy cream with yogurt for a lighter taste and added cinnamon, cardomon, garam masala and tumeric.

I took the prior suggestions and used coconut milk instead of cream.  I also added yogurt, like other Korma recipes do.  I wish I would've used the cream.  Coconut milk definitely makes a lighter version.  I also added turmeric, coriander and red pepper as the other Korma recipe on this site uses.  Couldn't find garam masala.  Next time, I would use 1/2 and 1/2 and add more red pepper.  Definitely use just one potato instead of two.

Excellent!  Made it twice.  First exactly as in the recipe and the second time with extra heavy cream and a little butter.  Both turned out great.  Thanks for sharing!

This was wonderful.  I followed the recipe  except added a little more tomato sauce and substituted half and half for the cream. I added some cauliflower and had to cook it a little longer to get the veggies done. Everyone loved it and the little bit of leftovers were delicious the next day.

This was very good, but I did add a little more salt and cayenne pepper for some heat.

Very good, but not quite like what we order at the indian restaurant. Made for a very good supper, though. Thanks!
