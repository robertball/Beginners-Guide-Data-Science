This is a great dish that I made some modifications to. First I combined the juice from the pineapple with a bit of soy sauce and 1/2 lemon juice and marinated the salmon in it. I then removed the salmon and patted it dry and seared the skin side in a hot pan for 3 minutes then flipped for 2 minutes until slightly browned. I put the salmon in a baking dish and poured the marinade over and threw in pineapple chunks capers onion remaining half lemon juice and olive oil. Sprinkled with pepper covered with foil (with holes) and let bake until flaky. I would have included kale if I had any.

I made this recipe last night we had all ingredients on hand EXCEPT the pineapple. I usually attempt every recipe first as written....however this was my first exception. It was FABULOUS!!! My family scarfed it up even my picky 2 year old I used 1.5 lb Salmon I will definitely be making this again with the pineapple just to try it!!

This recipe is delicious. I added extra veggies like broccoli mushrooms and carrots on top of the salmon as well as took tips from other posters and marinated the fish ahead of time. It turned out great and my husband also loved it!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I followed another reviewer's advise and marinated then seared the fish before baking it. I used fresh pineapple and some organic juice instead of the can. Perfect meal for a summer evening!

Delicious and nutritious and so easy! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly. I used crushed pineapple. I used fresh frozen kale that was already chopped, probably closer to 2 cups. Added extra capers and a little caper juice. Served over brown rice to which I added lemon and capers. I had white onion and loved that they were slightly al dente. Red onion would be good too. Will definitely make again!
