This was a great recipe!  I love to bake, but had never used a cookie press before.  I had absolutely none of the problems some of the users mentioned.  Real butter is a key, though!  I found no need to mix the flour in by hand.  I used my KitchenAid mixer and it came together just fine.  My five-year old was amazed by the "magic" of the cookie press, and loved the taste.  She said, "These are so good.  I think we could SELL them!"  The recipe came together fast, and the baking time is so short.  We were able to make mountains of cookies in no time.  One note: If you are sprinkling sugar or other decorations on the cookies, do that BEFORE you bake.  Otherwise, the sugar will not stick in my experience.

I made these last night. This recipe tastes and 
works better than the one that came with my cookie press! I got 6 dozen cookies from the recipe. It also works well for stamped cookies, as they keep their crisp patterns. Remember that these cookies rely on real butter for much of their flavor. Substitutions will not only not taste nearly as good, but may affect the consistency of the dough. You CAN substitute different flavorings for the vanilla. Try almond, peppermint (perhaps with crushed candy on top and/or coloring the dough pink), rum, orange or lemon. The dryness of flours may vary, but this should be a stiff but kneadable dough that can be packed into the cookie press. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks!

Very good.  Only comment, I made the dough the day before and refrigerated it.  After bringing to room temp on the counter for the dough was not as easy to work though the spritzer machine as the first batch I made that I used immediately.  

I would use immediately next time.

This cookie was wonderful.  Light and flakey and melted in your mouth.  This was the first time ever using a cookie press.  The dough did good the first time filling the press but by the second time I needed to refrigerate the dough.  Thanks for the recipe!

I bought a cookie press in a thrift store a while ago, and researched on the internet for spritz cookie recipes.  I read a lot in forums about how cookie presses suck in general and are complicated to use, how the dough sticks to the cookie press but not to the sheet, and so on.  However, using this recipe for my first time with the cookie press, I have no idea what all those people did wrong, but I bet it was that they used the wrong recipe. This was fantastically fast and easy, and absolutely no hassle whatsoever.  Using the cookie press was lots of fun with this recipe and I canâ€™t wait to do it again!

Well...I followed the recipe to the T, and ended up with a dough way to soft...I ended up having to roll them in balls, and while they were edible, nothing special and I kind of feel like I wasted 2 sticks of butter.
I chilled it for 15 minutes, and it was still to sticky for my electric cookie press...I really hate to write a less than glowing review, but I'd hate for anyone to be disappointed as I was. I'm off to try another recipe!

Very good! I followed another review that suggested adding 1tsp of salt since I used unsalted butter. I also used 2 eggs instead of 3 egg yolks. I only baked for 6 min & they were perfect!

This is a great recipe.  I read some of the reviews that mentioned floury tasting or dry - You have to use real butter (salted), then I added 1-1/2 tablespoons more sugar and 1 tsp more of vanilla - these are the best Spritz Cookies I've ever made and I've made a lot.  As usual I tripled this recipe for fam and friends.

YUMMY!!!! WARNING: these are highly addictive cookies! I was planning on making my traditional cream cheese spritz but when I realized I didnt have any cream cheese I searched for an alternative spritz and found this. These cookies are so darn good that the kids are fighting over them... one of them hid some cookies in his pocket!!! Yes I did make a few adjustments based on previous reviews.... I only used 2 cups of flour, 2/3 cup granulated sugar and 1/4 cup light brown sugar to avoid a dry cookie as some had described. I didnt refrigerate the dough and had no problems in my manuel cookie press (the batteries died on the electic one :( Do not hesitate to make these cookies!!!

This is my first time making spritz cookies and using a cookie press (Pampered chef).  The dough was so soft and easy to work with.  I couldn't believe how perfect the cookies turned out.  They have a very delicate, delicious flavor.  I added only 2 cups of flour and added 1 cup of sugar.  I think they turned out tasting perfect!  These cookies are not bland; they're supposed to have a subtle flavor and a melt in your mouth texture.

I have never been moved before to write a review, but these cookies were amazing!  I kept pretty close to the recipe, just doubling the amount of vanilla (a preference I usually indulge in) and adding a 1/2 tsp. of salt, as others have suggested.  They came out perfect the first time!  I didn't have to refridgerate, and I used a Pampered Chef press.  Thank you for my new favorite cookie recipe!

I have tried several spritz recipes from this site with mixed reviews.  This one was terrific.  The cookies came out of the press easily and no chilling required!  Use the dough as soon as it is made. I may add a pinch of salt next time to bring out the nuttiness of the butter.

I actually made a sugar-free version of this cookie and it came out wonderful! I substituted a generic version of Splenda in the same quantity as the sugar listed in the recipe and I used 1 tsp almond extract and 2 tsp. vanilla for the flavorings...I really thought they were great.  I have a small home-baking hobby and I have a lot of friends who love for me to do their baking for them...so this will be guinea-tested on some of my diabetic friends who have been feeling left out.

I used this recipe because another review said it worked great with their Pampered Chef cookie press.  I completely agree that this is the best recipe that I have found for my Pampered Chef press.  The cookies turned out great w/out the mess that most other recipes have!  Thanks...great, easy recipe!!

This is a good recipe. I didn't think the first batch was sweet enough so I used 3/4 cup of sugar and I thought that worked better. I also use green food coloring after mixing the flour.   My mom and I made Spritz cookies when I was a kid and she can't find her recipe. This one is close, but something is a little different--we used to sift the flour so that might be it.  Also, you don't want to chill the dough before using the press. I noticed some other reviewers did that and had trouble. The dough works best when it's at room temperature.

This is my first time using a cookie press. my cookie press is the cheapest electric press you could find and I still did great with this dough; the consistency is perfect for the cookie press. do not need refrigerating, maybe if you handle the dough too much. About the flavor I found it a little bit bland so I double the vainilla and also made a second batch with 2 tsp almond flavor. and put a whole cup of sugar instead of 2/3, I also used coloring for the cookies and turn out great! cooking time was more 6 mins than 7-10. I will be including these in my Christmas cookie tin cans gifts.

I mixed the first part with a mixer and then hand mixed in the flour.  The dough was easy to put in the pampered chef cookie press.  The first batch came out great but then the second batch of dough wouldn't stick to the pan.  I guess I should have put the rest back in the refrigerator while I was waiting.  The cookies tasted good but they crumble easily.  Overall, I would make them again.

I was so nervous about this recipe because of some negative reviews - but these worked perfectly and tasted great. I had a near disaster with another recipe and there was absolutely no issue with my cookie press using this one. The office will thank you, Lesley!

Self-respecting Swedes only use Almond Extract in Spritz, not vanilla!  
And if you use margarine, you will end up with an inferior cookie that is too soft to keep a shape.

very nice cookie. not to strong a flavor very understated and great to eat. i made them for a party and they were placed out on a table with 4 other spriz cookie trays. these were the last ones put out and the first ones gone. they work best when made with a cookie press as this will allow you to make them uniform and uniform cookies always bake better

Love the flavor! Easy to make. Was hard for it to stick to the baking sheet so we added 3 tbsp. milk and it fixed the problem!!! Try it..it works and the flavor stays the same!

I agree with some of the comments about the flour-y flavor. I used unsalted butter but the last time I loaded my cookie press I mixed in a little salt. Next time I would put in more and I think it helped the flavor. I might also use some sprinkle sugar on top for sweetness. I would consider making this recipe again. I also used whole wheat flour (only flour I have) and substituted the vanilla for almond. The WW worked fine.

These are just like my great grandma used to make every christmas.  It is a thick dough.  It is sposed to be.  When using the cookie press use designes that have big holes not the tinny little ones.

This is the same recipe my grandmother used, except that she often substituted almond extract for the vanilla.  I find the dough very easy to work with and the cookies are always a BIG hit!!

This recipe was VERY easy to make and tasted great!!  After I made the dough, my cookie press broke, so I had to roll them out and make with cookie cutters.  And they still came out DELICIOUS!!  They were a little crumbly but still great.  I will use this recipe in the future! No changes were neccesary for me, but with the cookie cutters, I only had 24 cookies in the end.

Best recipe for Spritz cookies that I have found.  Great tasting cookie and the dough is good consistency to place inside cookie press.  Only thing is, my cookie press stopped working half way through.  I have two, a battery operated one and  a manual.  I couldn't get either one to work.

Great recipe.   I make chocolate chip meringue cookies during the holidays and this is a great recipe to use up all those egg yolks!  I've also made with just a bit of almond extract added as well.  So yummy and festive!

I would honestly give this recipe 20 stars if I could!! I'd never used a cookie press before and this recipe made it so simple. I made the cookies with the Christmas tree stencil for my family for the holidays and they were a HUGE hit. My mother especially couldn't stop eating them! I'll be making another batch for her next week for her Valentine birthday. I used orange extract instead of vanilla and they're just luscious. I can't wait to try the recipe with other flavors like maple or almond. Or maybe lemon poppy seed! The possibilities are endless with this wonderful, simple, delicious recipe!

The raw dough tasted great, but I didn't care for the baked cookies.  They were bland, and lacked flavor.  Mine didn't hold their shape during baking, so they didn't even look pretty when done.

These turned out great.  I prefer a little more vanilla flavor so next time I will add a little more.  But the dough was perfect for our cookie press and the cookies turned out great.  I cooked them for 8 minutes.

Very easy to use in the cookies press - be careful not to let the dough sit too long or cookies will be too soft in press and will fall apart in oven. I refrigerated dough in between using during my second batch and that worked fine. Also, I added 1/3 cup more sugar as original recipe was not sweet enough and I was disappointed in that.

This was a very floury tasting cookie that was too dry to go through the cookie press.....They ended up okay, but nothing to write home about. I followed the recipe to a T.

I made this recipe using one reader's suggestion of 4 egg yolks.  The first batch of dough was a bit warm and came out of the Pampered Chef Cookie Press wihtout any problems.  I made a second batch that was a bit colder and had problems getting the dough to stick to the cookie sheet.  I guess one of the tricks is to have your dough about room temp.  Taste of the cookies was great

I had a really difficult time getting the dough to come out of my cookie press and stick to the cookie sheets.  I have a pampered chef cookie press (it's manual).  Perhaps an electric one would have worked better.  I had to squeeze really, really hard to get the dough out, and even then it was hit and miss.  The flavor of the cookies is fine.  I won't use again since it doesn't seem to work for my particular press.

This is to a T the same recipe that my mom passed down to me (with the exception that our instructions say to sift the flour first, but I've made it both ways, either works fine. Sifting makes the cookies lighter and fluffier). We made these for Christmas every year with a twist.

We would triple the recipe, keeping every all three batches separate from each other. We would then add red food coloring to one batch, green to another, and leave the third one alone (so it remains white). Then she would chill them (usually overnight and make them the next day).

Then, the magic is you take a hunk of each of the colors, and press them into the cookie press. Once you get going, the cookies will have red, green and white swirls of colors on them. You just keep adding each of the colors till you run out of dough. Towards the end the colors won't be so distinct, but it is worth the effort.

For those wanting to try but unsure, these are my all time favorite cookie. I am not a huge sweet fan, and these are not overly sweet. You could easily add sprinkles or top with sugar to make them sweeter if you wanted, but to me they are perfect the way they are.

My great grandma always made Spritz and Rosettes for Christmas and mailed them to us, she's getting too old to move around in the kitchen, so I went on the hunt for a cookie press and the perfect Spritz recipe, and this recipe is it.
These cookies are so delicious, I was so excited to send friends and family off with a tin of them!
they're buttery and not too sweet!

I used real butter and put them in the oven for 8 minutes exactly.
the first time I made them it was a test batch and I learned quickly to use an ungreased, chilled cookie sheet. that way they have no problems sticking, just be sure to remove the cookies immediately after taking them out of the oven.

Followed recipe exactly. Did not like them. First batch burned on the bottom. Lowered temp for next pans that went in and turned out blah. Not sweet enough, lacking in flavor. I don't know why because I didn't change anything in the recipe.

Great recipe.  I used the egg whites brushing each cookie with egg whites before adding sprinkles helps them stick and also gives them a shine.

These were a hit with my visiting friend when I made them for a baby shower tea using the heart disc of the cookie press. Very quick, very buttery. All the ladies loved them. I'll use this recipe again!

I followed the recipe, used real butter but the dough was too heavy to use with my cookie press. After adding sone water to make the dough easier to manipulate it worked ok. I would use again but add less flour

I used this recipe to try out my new cookie press and it made it very easy! One of my huge reservations about spritz cookies is that they often call for so much butter, and I'm too cheap to part with four sticks in one recipe! lol But yes, this one worked perfectly, and I ended up with a generous amount of perfectly sized butter cookies in the end. I even bumped it up a bit with one batch by adding a pinch of salt, about two teaspoons of grated orange zest and I used about 1 cup of sugar to yield a sweeter cookie (and combat a bit too generous of a salt pinch). The extra sugar probably isn't crucial but I recommend the zest! It opens up a ton of flavour possibilities and these cookies were MUCH less time consuming than other holiday cookies I've tried. These will definitely make it into the cookie tins this December as well as all year round! :)
ETA: my cookie press BROKE in the middle of a batch of these, and I just patted the dough flat and cut out with a small star-shaped cookie cutter! They held their shape and were very cute, kind of a shortbread texture and pretty lovely. I will hang onto this recipe even now that I don't have a cookie press at my disposal.

Just tried this recipe. Very good and easy to use. Didnt think this year I was going to make Christmas cookies....just one of those lazy years. But Im very happy I did. I parted the dough in 3 sections, colored 1 red and 1 green and rolled the three together. They came out adorable. Not bad for someone who was going to be bah humbug to cookies this year lol lol Merry Christmas!!

I just received a cookie press for my birthday and this is the first recipe I have made with it.  The cookies are delicious, and very easy to make.  Total cookies was about 7 dozen.  Very tasty, and I will be making these again!

I have been making Spritz cookies for 10+ years and have used several different recipes, and finally found my favorite one a couple of years ago, but couldn't find it this year :(   So I thought I would try this one... It is amazing.  So simple to make, and worked so well in my cookie press.  
I added a little bit of Almond extract to the recipe tho, and they taste Fabulous!!!  I will be making these again!

The cookies are great, but the pan I put on the lower rack of my oven, the cookies burnt. Thats ok, because I learned from my mistake and made a new great batch after.

Thanks for the great recipe and all the ideas from everyone.  I did only 3 cups of flour also and love it.  I haven't ever done Spritz cookies because I thought they would be hard.  I have had the battery powered press for 3 years without using it.  Love it now and will use it more often.

At frist when I tried these they were good, but not grandma good, so i put the dough in the fridge all discouraged. I didn't want to waist it so I backed the rest last night, and WOW they are great! They might be able to compeate with my grandmas. I would recomend letting the dough rest for a big in the fridge.... I also made a cream cheese frosting. yum.

I didn't love these cookies, they turned out a little dry, which is definitely not what I remember eating every Xmas when I was little. I baked them for less time, and at a lower temp, still kinda dry, tasted a lot like sweet flour. Also, just a tip for a beginner Spritzer, ALWAYS use aluminum foil, or a pan that is NOT non-stick, if you use any type of nonstick anything, the cookies won't even separate from the press. I followed the recipe as stated, until the first batch came out very hard, that's why I lowered temp and time, but I wouldn't make these again, even after the adjustment.

Very good. I mixed in the flour with my mixer and they turned great. It would be to much work to mix the flour in by hand. They turned out so well I'm going to make a second batch.

These cookies have a nice texture and a nice light flavor, but I had trouble with these working in my press.  I had to add a little milk to loosen them up.

Update: I bought a new press this year - an old Mirro aluminum press on ebay - and the dough works just great without any modifications in this press.  Last year I used a plastic Wilton, and it just didn't agree with my hands nor the dough.  Changing this to 5 stars! Great flavor, delicate texture that melts in your mouth - not hard or too crispy at all.  Great for my grandma who can't chew crispy cookies.

I am very dissappointed in this recipe. My dough was incredibly crumbly, even though I used less dough than the recipe called for (at the suggestion of other reviews). Also, the dough came out of the cookie press, it would not stick to my pan. I'm not an "experienced" baker, so maybe it was me...but I will not be attempting these again.

this recipe turned out perfect!   I used 2 cups flour and half a cup cornstrach. I used almond extract in place of the vanilla.  It came out of moms old crank cookie press perfect.  I baked them at 375 degrees for 6/7 minutes.  Just Perfect!

The recipe is absolutely delicious and super easy. The dough also comes together perfectly. The only complaint I had was that a few of mine got slightly brown around the edges which would be fine for other cookies but never for spritz. The solution is very simple however: Bake only 6 minutes and they will come out perfectly. Most spritz recipes call for only 6-8 minutes anyway.

One of the best Spritz cookies I have made. I used to use my mom's recipe, now I have my own. I had to make another batch the next day, my husband ate all our "Santa" cookies that night. Wonderful cookie. One note, to make cookie more formed when using cookie press, refrigerate in bowl 30 minutes before pressing.

Excellent, thanks for sharing! Very easy to work with using my cookie press - after refrigerating. Made one batch with vanilla & one with almond - both were yummy!!

Sorry, but I don't understand the ppositive reviews for this recipe.  I followed it precisely and it turned out really bland.  Adding salt would have probably helped a bit, but as is this recipe was a waste of ingredients. I give it two stars because it made cookies with shapes that held up nicely, but that is about it.

This was a very good recipe to use in a cookie press. I had no problems working the dough through the press. I used light butter (all I had), added a little extra sugar and vanilla extract, and turned out good.  I did lower the temp to F 350 (for 10 min) after my first batch burned, and that worked fine.   cookies had a nice, simple butter flavor.

Cookies tasted great, but I had a hard time working the dough through my Wilton cookie press. Dough was too thick (and it was not refrigerated). Next time I will use less flour.

My sister and I have been looking for a recipe that was as good as the ones our Mom use to make and this one is very close.  The cookies were easy to make, thanks in part to my KitchenAid mixer - no hand mixing necessary!  The cookies melted in your mouth and had a great flavor.  This will recipe will definitely be made every Christmas from now on!

Yum! I only used 2 egg yolks, because I wanted a thick consistency for my press. I also substituted almond extract for the vanilla and it made them very almondy! I loved them. I lowered the baking temperature to 350 degrees and they baked for about 8 minutes.

I was forced to edit my review of this cookie. The first time I made it, they were very tasty and worked okay with my Wilton cookie press. The second time I made it, I couldn't get it to work with the press at all. I ended up rolling the dough into a log, refrigerating it, and then slicing into discs.  The cookies were dry, crumbly, floury, and tasteless! I cannot recall making the dough any differently between the two times, so all I can say is that I gave it a rating of 3, 4 for the first time and 2 for the second.

Tasty cookies. I used 1/2 c. less flour than the recipe recommended. The dough is difficult to mix but after a few minutes it all "gels". I used my Pampered Chef cookie press and it worked fine. Will probably use recipe again.

I was having problems with the spritz recipe that came with the cookie  press I've had for years. It was always too sticky or didn't come out of the press...this recipe was wonderful! Didn't have one bit of trouble with it!! I also substituted almond extract for the vanilla...as I do with a lot of recipes - more flavorful.

I made this recipe exactly as it is stated.  They worked great in my press and taste yummy.  I didn't give them a 5 because I have never made press cookies before.  I thought they were a little dry, but maybe not as this is my first time with this recipe so maybe this is exactly how spritz cookies are supposed to be.

First I have to say I've never made Spritz cookies before. This recipe was perfect. They tasted the way I remember my grandmother's cookies tasting and such an easy recipe. One thing to keep in mind is the temperature of the dough is very important. After chilling in the refrigerator for about an hour was perfect.

I had to add more butter to make it more doughy.  I didn't have a cookie press so I flattened the dough and used some cookies cutters.  They where a little doughy in the middle so I put them back into the oven.  I added some red  sprinkles  to add more  taste.   Would I make it again sure I would.

This is the same exact recipe my Grandmother handed down to me.  It's wonderful.
If you want to shake it up a little, use almond flavoring instead of vanilla, or lemon and lemon zest.
If you are going to ship these tender cookies, freeze them first and wrap two cookies together in cupcake papers. Pack in tins with popcorn.

Very good!  I couldn't find my cookie press so ended up rolling the dough into logs, wrapping in waxed paper, and chilling in the fridge for about 30 minutes.  I then sliced the logs into 1/8-inch slices and baked as directed.  The cookies turned out great!  Crispy and buttery!  If the cookies turned out so well in spite of not using a cookie press, you know it's a great recipe!

DO: try these cookies.  They are pretty tasty once done!  But if you have never made spritz cookies unsupervised or are a relative novice at "fancy" baking, learn from my epic fail and:
DON'T sniff the flavor bottles.  I wanted 3 different colors with 3 different flavors, and thought I would revel in every moment of this magical Christmas-cookie-making adventure by breathing in the imitation strawberry (which, come to think of it, was probably 20 years old anyway).  Avoid the fume headache.
DON'T hand mix if you can help it, unless you were already planning on knocking out an upper body workout, anyway.
DON'T put the dough in the fridge for too long.  Maybe a little bit to help stiffen it for a clean press, but don't leave it in there for a half day while you finish your last minute shopping, thinking you are all clever and a good time manager.  You'll come home to solid bricks.
DON'T assume you will have natural instinct on how to artfully and effectively use the cookie press.
DON'T expect your experience will replicate the fairy-tale memories you had of making the same cookies in your Mom's kitchen when you were five.  My cookies were the most hideous things I had ever spawned from my kitchen, and no amount of sprinkles and slivered maraschino cherries could camouflage the truth.  I was almost sad enough to tear up a little bit, until I tasted them... and then it was okay.  That's why, even after the long string of don'ts, I still recommend you give them a try :)

A lovely basic spritz.  I added a touch of salt, just to be sure it wasn't bland.  And it's such dry weather right now, I added a tablespoon of water to make it workable dough.  Thanks!

I really didn't like this recipe.  The dough was hard to work with and stuck to the press more than with other recipes I have used.  I was disappointed.

Nothing says Christmas to me like spritz cookies, and I was anxious to give this recipe a try.  These mixed together well and I had no trouble getting the dough through my Wilton cookie press, but all I taste when I bite into one is the flour!  Not sure why, except that I did use unsalted butter; maybe the flavors would have been more well rounded if I'd used the salted kind?!?  Anyway, I'm still on the lookout for that "perfect" spritz recipe!

I found the dough to be too stiff for my battery operated cookie press, which was a little frustrating, but I managed to fix that by thinning it out with 2-3 tablespoons of milk.  They taste and look great and were quite quick to make.

Followed the directions to a "T" and ended up with dough so stiff it crumbled coming out of the cookie press.  I will be sticking with my normal spritz recipe.  Plopped the dough down on cookie sheets to not waste it and the flavor was great, just not so much for being able to use it with a cookie press.

I followed the directions to the T & came up with a VERY thick dough - I was fighting with my cookie press the whole time until I just gave up.  The cookies that I did make were very plain tasting to me & way to heavy.  I like butter cookies but these were just too plain for me.  I think that if I am to make these again I will only do 2 cups of flour next time & that should thin out the dough enough to not have to fight with the cookie press.  I might also try to use the whole eggs instead of just the yolks.

For years I have tried to make Spritz that taste as good as hers. ( When I follow her recipe they don't come out the same.)  This makes a cookie like hers.  It is delicious.  Thank you

These weren't bad, and I knew not to expect a super flavorful cookie, but I have to say these tasted like sweetened flour. I probably would have enjoyed them more dunked in tea, but as they were, they just weren't the cookie for me.

I agree, butter is essential in this recipe.  Because these are a little dry, we always frost them!  I just use about 2 cups confectioners sugar and slowly add milk, a little at a time until it's the right consistency.  Then I put about 1/3 cup in 4 different custard cups and add a couple drops of food coloring, and we have green, blue, yellow, and red/pink frosting.  It's very easy then to decorate the cookies with sprinkles, dragees, colored sugar, etc.  Even small children can help.  Just give them a little plastic disposable knife for each color, and they will go to town.

Made Christmas Eve.  They turned out very flat! I used 2 cups flour and one cup sugar.  The cookies are very light/delicate.  Would probably not make again.  I will try recipe on the cookie press next time!

very good! I couldn't bake the cookies the day I made the dough, so I refrigerated it until the next day. It took a while to soften but once it did it worked wonderfully! A wonderful basic recipe.

Quick & easy. Perfect when family is wanting some home baking NOW. I made plain ones and added several types of sprinkles to the rest. Also, make a double batch if you want any for yourself.

This would be 5* but I did make changes. I took the advice of another and baked 10 min. at 350. I also rolled into small balls, made a finger indention in the middle and topped with colored deco sugar. My family LOVED these and have requested that I bring them to every get-together! Thanks for the great recipe!

it was ok...this is the first time in a very long time that I had made these cookies. I followed the directions to a "T" with the amount of flour to put in but I had to use more because the dough was too "thin" it took me 3 times just to get the consistancy of the dough "perfect" enough for the cookies to come out of the press without running on the cookie sheet. glad others have not had problems with the recipe...I thought I had done something wrong...I dunno...the 3rd time fixing the dough it came out better then the last 2 lol

Good flavor, but I had a really hard time getting this recipe to work with my press.  I add to add more butter because my dough was so dry.  Then again it was a warm dry day here in CO so who knows?  That's the frustrating thing about spritz cookies.  I swear they only really work well about 75% of the time.

Worked well with the cookie press.  I did not like them at all--thought they tasted bland with a bitter floury after taste.  My husband, however, likes them.  Made the recipe as stated, but only needed to bake them for 5 minutes.

I think next time I might add some butter extract or more vanilla.  Very nice texture and easy to work with.

This recipe was too thick to run through a bag. I tried it twice and both times it did not work. The "dough" is super thick and I just had to spoon the cookies. I did try this recipe twice . . .
