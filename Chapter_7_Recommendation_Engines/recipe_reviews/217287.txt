Good recipe but I believe there was a typo. 2 cups of grape juice is way too much. Charoset is not supposed to be swimming in liquid. It should be half a cup max, of grape juice.

This was great except  I used the 1/4 cup of cinnamon which was to much . It did say to tast. I added  a 6 once container of peach yogurt to cover up the tast  of too much cinnamon as that was all I had. this was great!

I made a 2-apple recipe, with 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and crushed walnuts/brazil nuts combo. Next time I will try pecans or macadamias! Too much juice, poured out a lot before serving.

Simple, easy Charoset.  Kosher wine can be exchanged for grape juice, and pecans can be substituted for walnuts (either way, this recipe is easy and delicious).  My apples and nuts were chunkier, rather than finely chopped.
