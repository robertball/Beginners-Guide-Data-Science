Growing up, my mom made this for us all the time and now I make it for my family. You can add anything you like to this recipe. Sometimes I add celery or chopped green pepper. When my salad is completed I usually serve it on a large bed of lettuce. I slice hard boiled eggs and tomato and place on and around the salad. Makes a pretty presentation for a very simple yet delicious and easy meal. For those of you who like a little zip, have a bottle of hot sauce at the table to sprinkle on the salad!

I made this for a party and since I'm all about presentation, I made a few modifications. I only used one can of tuna and I used plenty more than 1/4 cup of Miracle Whip. I threw in some thawed frozen peas and shredded sharp cheddar cheese. It looked quite yummy and I had several people comment that it was just like their mom used to make! I didn't really try it since I added those other things. I'll have to make a version again with just the tuna, macaroni, and Miracle Whip for my plain palate.

This simple and easy-to-follow recipe turns out a delicious mac and tuna salad. I added a dash (or two) of red pepper flakes for an extra zing just because I love spicy foods! And it's also perfect for lunch for the next day!

Just what we needed today. We're getting close to payday and running out of almost everything so we've got to use what we've got. We did add a little more mayonnaise, I used green onion (four "stalks") and at the request of my son, I added chopped pickles and a little dijon mustard and Frank's Hot Sauce. For us, this did not feed ten. This fed four of us, my husband ate what was left. Very easy, quite budget effective and filling.

This recipe is very similar to my own except that instead of onions I use scallions (aka green onions) and I don't add oregano.
I like this recipe because is not goopy with mayonnaise, and it's easy to prepare.  I used to make a batch of it, and then eat it as a quick meal in my college dormitory.
Another variation that I've tried is to add some grated parmesan cheese. 
A suggestion to facilitate mixing, I usually mix together the tuna, and seasonings (not the mayo) first while the pasta is cooking, this also helps with flavor balancing even though it will be strongly flavored at this point and then mix it together with the pasta and mayonnaise at the end.
A slightly more exotic variation is to add a little bit of sesame oil. I liked it but my bf didn't.

Yum! I like things colorful so I used half a diced orange bell pepper and half a diced cucumber instead of onion and added a bit of shredded cheddar cheese. Oh and I used colorful shell pasta. Pretty and tasty! This is a great recipe you can make your own with whatever veggies and spices you enjoy or keep it more basic for the kiddies. Thanks for sharing this! I'll enjoy experimenting with it again!

This was bland so I had to doctor it up a bit. I left out the oregano and added paprika instead. I also added ranch and eggs, you can't have tuna without hard boiled eggs. The last touch which really gave it the flavor it was missing was some shredded pepperjack cheese. MMM now its good.

My family loves creamy tuna fish with onion sanwiches, so I prepare this tuna dish the same way, toss it into the macaroni and add more mayo. I season to taste with the listed ingredients, only eliminating the oregano. We enjoy it!

This was pretty good.  I added cheese to mine for a little more flavor.  I think it was better the next day when the flavors had time to blend.

Yum!   I cut the tuna back to 1 can because I just wanted a subtle tuna taste; I also cut back the onion since my boys aren't fans but I minced some carrot very fine to add some crunch!.. I agree that the oregano and garlic went well in this recipe...  :)

Tried this recipe for dinner tonight, and everyone loved it! My picky daughter had two helpings, and my husband and son had three each!  Very good pasta salad with tuna. I'll definitely make it again.

I just added a jar of pimentos, a celery stalk, a tsp of mustard, and two of minced garlic, and upped the mayo to 3/4 c.  Mostly because I can't leave things well enough alone. :-)

I really like the flavor the garlic powder and oregano give this tuna pasta salad! I upped the mayonnaise to 3/4 cup, subbed a few finely chopped green onions for the onion, and used Wacky Mac spirals instead of macaroni. I also added 1 red bell pepper, 1 large stalk of celery (2 average stalks would be fine), and about 4 oz. of mushrooms (all diced). I served it over lettuce. It had a lot of color and a lot of flavor! I'll definitely make this again!

It was definitely a base recipe.  All the additions others suggested are great!  I also added lemon juice (about 2-3 TBLs) with the dill, tomatoes, cheese and lots of real garlic rather than powder.  I think water chestnuts would do well, too. Next time I'll add hard boiled eggs and red or other sweet pepper. Be creative with this one!

Like others I did some changes based on what I had around the house.  I deleted the oregano and used dill instead.  I used ranch dressing and mayo both.  I used Vidalia vs red onion.  I also used garlic powder along w/ salt and pepper.  For color I cut a bunch of cherry tomatoes in half.   My boyfriend & I loved it!  I made a separate dish for my daughter without the onions & tomatoes and she loved it too.

This is the way I have always made tuna macaroni salad.  I use a 1/2 to 3/4 cup of salad dressing(Miracle Whip), and add shredded cheddar cheese.

A great basic macaroni salad. Easy to prepare. Good as is or easy to add to. I used more salad dressing then called for. I also added paprika and a dash of seasoning salt. I choose not to use onions, maybe green oninon would be a good addition, or some shredded cheddar.

For the dressing, I used fat free Greek yogurt and ranch dressing (tastes like sour cream, mayo mixture.  Used garlic salt, onion powder, minced red onion, finely chopped celery, a handful of green parts of green onions, thawed frozen peas, seasoning pepper and low-sodium salt.  Also used whole grain penne pasta. A little healthier and just as good.

It needed a lot more mayo than called for!    I halved the recipe and used at least 1/2 cup.  I also added onion powder and lots of pepper.  Adding extra pepper really gives a zing!

I made it with elbow macaroni.  Deleted the garlic powder and oregano.  I added chopped green olives.  My husband loved it.

I used miracle whip instead and doubled the amount I put in to 1/2 cup. I also sliced grapes and added them in. Finally, I didn't add the lettuce. Instead, I scooped the pasta mixture into lettuce wraps.

I usually make this recipe for a quick lunch and dinner; except I add in a can of Hunt's or Del Monte's diced or stewed tomatoes Italian recipe.  It add alot of flavor to this recipe and my 5 yo loves it.  I also add vege's like peas, broccoli, sometimes carrots and a little onion.  I like my food to have texture.  I gave it 4 stars because it's a bit plain.

Simple and easy to throw together. The spice lends a subtle flavor that I enjoy. Only thing I changed was I sprinkled some paprika on top for a little punch of color.

Love this salad...it's great in the hot summer months and you can do so much with it to suit your taste.  My family isn't fond of onions, so i use fresh chopped chives instead.  I also add a little celery seed instead of celery...again it's a family preference.  I too usually add fresh or frozen peas, but the last time I made it, I didn't have any so i tried fresh quartered broccoli florets to add some color and it turned out great.  For an added zing and even more color, try sprinkling some paprika over the top for presentation.  Sliced green or black olives work well in this recipe as well.  Try some of these variations and your summer salad will be a hit!

This recipe definitely needs help. It's a good basic recipe, but written as is leaves much to be desired. Start out with this and then add what you will: celery, green peppers, peas, cheese, green onions. I found oregano and tuna not a good mix for my tastes. I'd use dill weed. Needs a bit more mayo, to individual tastes. Spice it up a bit by adding a shake of hot sauce or a jalapeno pepper. It just needs alot of additions to make this work.

This tasted bland to me. I had to add mustard and horseradish just to give the pasta a little bit of flavor.

this was pretty good. I had all the ingredients already. I added some peas and white corn to mine, and a little ranch dressing.

for an even better salad make this with macaroni and cheese instead of just plain macaroni and even add canned or fresh veggis as a fulfilling meal.

I really enjoyed this dish. I didn't cook the macaroni long enough (I'm not that good at 'al dente'). It tasted like cold tuna casserole but without the fattening cream of mushroom soup (don't get me wrong--that soup is still very good to use and tastes excellent). Works very well as leftovers for a cold lunch when you don't have access to a microwave.

This recipe was the simple version that I've been looking for (without all the green peppers and celery, stuff like that)  I'm not one for raw onion so I left that out.  However I did add in peas (which is an excellent suggestion) and also little cubes of mild cheddar cheese.  I will definately use this recipe over and over again! Thankyou.
