Made it for the first time for Christmas morning...let it bake while opening presents. As other reviewer noted, it made lots of filling (I used the whole bag Ore Ida O'Briens). I had 2 frozen 9" pie crusts from Thanksgiving, so used both (thawed) and merely added 2 more eggs, some milk, a few shakes minced onion and got 2 quiche! Husband and daughter both asked for seconds! That's a Christmas miracle...

The maple bacon made this recipe too sweet. I would use smoked bacon. Try Tyson bacon that is used in microwave to heat up, or cook regular bacon on stove. Also I used vadalia sweet onion sauta in a pan first. Also the cheese I used is smoked cheese. ( at times I used regular American cheese)
Also use half the hash brown potatoes. 


This makes it much more tasty.

I made this but totally changed it (based on other reviews and to suit my other menu items) 
I made it into 2 quiches by adding 2 extra eggs & 50% more milk & cheese.  I substituted the bacon with a pack (one of the blocks) of frozen spinach, defrosted and squeezed dry.  Besides needing salt (because- duh, I took out the bacon), it was super good.  I will make it again (with salt)

I used Hickory bacon,Added 0ne cup of Biscuick,  I used Instant potatoes and saut√©ed in a little bacon grease green onions, yellow onions, green peppers, chives and diced fresh parsley No pie crust, only Pam spray in glass pie plate.  and added to the cooked mashed potatoes.. Mixed all together in mixer slow after stirring it together with a fork to incorporate flour and bisquick
Watch time in oven, with the Bisquick it rises and get done faster. Use toothpick or similar to test for wet or dry.

Took about 15 minutes longer with a calibrated oven.
Recipe makes  two full 9" pies, not 1.
Sorry Ore-Ida, but TOO much potatoes, not enough eggs.  The O-Brien mix I USED to use had much more veggies in it.  I was disappointed in the shortage of veggies.  This was Ok for a quick mix, but definitely needs more veggies or expect the dish to need same thing you would add to a potato...  
This is literally more of a potato pie - versus an egg dish.  

Next time,  I would add some  herbs, probably still follow the egg, cream, milk mixture - and add maybe 1 cup of potato mix, and max of 2 to 4 oz the cheese.  Any mix left over, scramble it up in a pan - or put into muffin tins for single servings.
It was a crowd pleaser for a couple of potato fans - but maybe consider it more  for a lunch or dinner side dish instead of brunch,  unless revised to be more egg/veggie like.

I am not sure of the proportions.  Made way too much for even 2 9" pie crusts.  Looks good, have not tried it yet, but I recommend someone review the proportions.

Too many potatoes.  I would use 1/2 the amount was more like potato pie the quiche.  Will not ever make again.   Look for another recipe.
