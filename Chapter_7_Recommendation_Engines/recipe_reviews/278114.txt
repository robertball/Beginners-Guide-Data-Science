Quick and easy to make, but I think it needs a little more salt and some garlic. Also, note that this will probably only work for 6 or 8 quart pots as it gets pretty full and froths a bit.

I made this and it turn out horrible.  Still editable hunke of pasta and peas. O how I wish has a little pasta water to add to the glue mess!

I will make it again but nex t time as stove top where I can control the pasta to just under firm and the add the cheese and peas. Total time will be about the same time. 

Never again will I do PASTA in a slow instant pot which I ok for the truly lazy cooks.
Spend the time and make something great.

Good cooking RonB 

PS if I could give this a 1/4 star it would be given.

I'd use a bit less water. But it did all evaporate at the end of the process. It tasted terrific. Was very easy to make.
