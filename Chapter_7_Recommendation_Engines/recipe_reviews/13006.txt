My husband thought it was a bit too spicy, but I loved it. If you are using dry beans, make sure to boil them first on the stovetop and then add them to the slower cooker. Dry beans do not get as tender in a slow cooker even if you soak them overnight.

I'm giving this 4 stars, not because it wasn't good, but because I did make additions to it.  I'm sure the basic recipe is very good just as written. I did not soak my bean, but put them in a pan with the chicken broth and brought it to a full, rolling boil and then transferred it to the slow cooker. The beans turned out tender and perfect. I also added 2 big sprigs of epazote, which is an herb traditionally cooked with black beans, as well as 2 bay leaves. Along with the other spices I tossed in 2 packets of Goya Sazon. The addition of a can of tomatoes w/green chiles as other suggested sounded like a good idea, so that went in too along with 2 boneless, thin-cut pork chops! I left it on med-high in the slow cooker overnight (about 15 hours total). I do not feel this soup was too thin. I only mashed some of the beans against the side of the kettle with the back of a spatula.I just had a big bowl with a dollop of crema....yum!

This recipe is awesome.  I have made it several times, and it is really, really good.  If you are pressed for time just use the canned black beans, toss the rest of the stuff into a slow cooker, (I also added a can of diced tomatoes) and when you get home, dinner!  I just pureed  about 1/2 the soup for a more authentic look, and served it with chopped green onion, sour cream, cheddar cheese and homemade guacamole. Also, although I am not a huge fan of spice, I found this just right with the amount of cayenne recommended and two minced jalopenos.  They really mellow out in the soup and it won't be that spicy, just the right amount. YUM!

I am giving this 4 stars because I changed it up a bit. This is a good base recipe. I used 4 cans black beans(drained) and only 3 cups of broth. I added 1 can spicy diced tomatoes, 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 small diced yellow onion. I also doubled the cayenne, jalapeno, and cumin....we really like it spicy. I also added some chopped cilantro and a tbsp fresh lime juice. An hour before serving I put half of the soup in the blender and returned to crock pot. This made it thicker. I served with sour cream and shredded cheese on top. It was spicy....yummy and gone in a heartbeat! Will make it again.

Made this soup today.  I cut the spices in half...still too spicy for me, but I'm kinda wimpy on the heat level.  I like spicy, but not hot, which, I know, is completely subjective.  I added a can of Amy's Vegetarian Organic Refried [Black] Beans.  Now just right for me. (November 2007)Help me understand why reviewers lower the rating when they don't follow the recipe?  The logic escapes me.

YUM!!.. This soup turned out really good!! I have made Black Bean soup in the past, but they did not compare to this one. I followed the other reviewers advice and added green pepper, onion and a can of diced tomatoes. I also made sure to soak the beans overnight. I wanted a slightly creamier soup and ended up pureeing half of the soup. It turned out perfect, spicy but not too spicy! I have added this one to my favorites.

I love to eat black beans and rice and this is a great recipe for this. I like my food spicy so I added in a whole fresh Jalepeno with seeds and a chopped onion. I doubled the hot sauce also. Instead of soaking the beans overnight, I put them in the Crock Pot before I went to bed and let them cook all night (don't tell my mother or she will yell at me for leaving an appliance on while I slept). However, the beans are harder this way. I'd soak them if I wanted them softer.

Instead of the jalapeno peppers, I use a chopped green pepper and a small can of diced green chiles. I also add a chopped onion, a can of diced tomatoes (reducing the amount of broth), and sometimes some cooked, diced chicken breasts. It is a great recipe, there are many things you can add or change to make it a bit different every time!

I doubled the spices, added fresh cilantro, 2 chopped red & green peppers, 1 good-sized jalapeno pepper, 1 sweet onion, 1 can of green chiles, 1 can of rotel, a shot of worcestershire and about 1 cup of salsa. (basically gazpacho ingred w/out the cukes)  Lot more work, but everyone loved it. Served over rice.

This is an excellent recipe for black bean soup.  I was afraid it would be too spicy, but decided to try it without adjusting the spices. When done, I blended approximately 2 cups of the recipe and returned it to the slow cooker.  Turned out great!!

Instead of "soaking" the beans overnight, just wash the beans; add the chicken broth (or whatever liquid you want to use); bring to rolling boil for 10 min., cover and let set for 2 hrs. Easy, and a "no fail" way to soften any bean you want.

What can I say?  Simply delicious!  My husband, who doesn't normally care for black beans, went back for seconds -- I think that says it all!  My changes: I added one chopped onion, a few cloves of minced garlic and two roasted/seeded/diced Anaheim chiles to the crockpot.  After the beans were tender, I added one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes.  After tasting, I ended up adding about 1 tsp more cumin, chili powder, onion powder, and garlic powder to give it more oomph.  I used an immersion blender to blend about 1/2 of the soup before serving topped with fresh chopped tomato and grated cheddar.  This one will be going in my recipe book!

Very tasty, but a little too spicy. I didn't even use the hot sauce. I'm from the South and love spice, but too much can take away the other flavors and the enjoyment of the dish. I will make again and scale back on the cayenne.

This has become a regular; I probably make it every two or three weeks. I was surprised at how rich and flavorful this soup is! I've started adding fresh green pepper and onion, and usually try to use organic black beans as they are only slightly more in cost but taste amazing in this soup. I also like to add chunks of smoked ham and through in sour cream at the end to make it more creamy. Also, to make it less soupy I usually use only 4 or 5 cups of chicken broth, 6 tends to make it too watery. The best part of this dish is that I can throw it in the crock pot in the morning and eat it 12 hours later. It's one of those few dishes that the longer you cook, the better it tastes!

This is good, I dont know if I think of it as soup though, I'm eating over rice and its delicious.  I did 2 tsps granulated garlic - I love garlic!  1 jalapeno with some of the seeds/membranes, about 1/2 tsp cayenne and no black pepper - the rest of the spices I kept the same.  I also added some chopped green pepper.  I love these kinds of meals as you can change it up and serve it different ways, and beans freeze well.  It does smell more flavorful than it actually is, but its easy to add stuff to get the taste you want.  I love that its inexpensive and can be done in the crockpot or on the stove.  OH - mine is not too spicy - but it all depends on the heat of your peppers and types of chili powders/hot sauce.  I used the tabasco chipotle sauce - you can always leave out the cayenne and hot sauce and add to taste when the beans are done.   OK - I had to come back and change my rating to 5 stars...I've still got my beans cooking and added a bit of flour as I want it to thicken up a bit, but the flavor has just gotten better and I keep eating bites out of the crockpot - I'm going to keep cooking longer to let it thicken, but this is really good!

Soup was decent after being doctored up with onions, green peppers and tomatoes..plus extra spices...but still a little bland.  Can't imagine that it would have any flavor without those additions.

Good base recipe. Here are the changes I made:  - Puree half the beans after slow cooking - Mix one tablespoon corn starch in a 1/4 cup of cooled soup - One small can tomato paste (helps soup thickness) - 2 tbsp worthesire(sp?) sauce  Serve topped with diced cilantro, tortilla chips and sour cream.

This is very good!  I cut the black pepper in half and added just a pinch of the cayenne and left the hot pepper sauce altogether, for the sake of the 6 little ones in the house.  :)  Hubby and I added a generous amount of Tabasco at the table.  I made some yellow rice and served it in the bowl with the soup, with freshly cut homegrown tomatoes on top, with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt.  YUMMY!  Will be on my regular menu plan!

I made this recipe last night and it is delicious.  I added smoked diced kielbasa sausage.  I would cut the cayenne in half.  i used fresh serrano chilis instead of jalapeno.  I also started with dried black beans that i boiled for 3 mins then started cooking in crockpot.  i cooked in crockpot for 6 hours on high then overnight on low.  I also pureed about 1 cup of the beans with my hand blender to thicken it.

This is a very simple, easy recipe with tons of flavor. I made some additions based on other reviews. I added a can of Rotel, 1/4 c chopped cilantro, a quarter of an onion (chopped), and the juice of a small lime. I brought the beans to a boil on the stovetop for about 5 minutes before starting them in the crockpot. Before serving the soup, I put 3 cups of the soup in the blender and blended it well, then put it back in the soup. That really made into a soup and not just beans, for me. The only thing is that the soup was a little thin for me. My husband didn't mind at all though, he ate almost the whole pot!!!

Good base to make soup.  After making changes and additions, it was wonderful.   Cut spices in half. blended about half of the beans to help thicken.  Added can of drained diced tomatoes, drained can corn, cilantro, chopped green onion, lime juice and the end result was 5 star.  Served with crushed tortillas, cheese and sour cream.

We really enjoyed the flavor of this soup- I did decrease the jalapenos.  The only problem is the texture of the beans- we don't think the slow cooker gets them soft enough, even after soaking.  I agree with the review that says to boil them first on the stovetop, if you are expecting a soft bean.

This was an excellent recipe you may want to make extra; I'm making it a 2nd time in 2 weeks!  The only adjustment I made was to use sweet bell peppers instead of the jalapenos because I was serving it to daycare children.  I also cooked it for an extra day in the crock pot on low heat to have a softer bean, and that was only as a matter of preference.

My beans were a little firm in the crock pot. I should have boiled them first.

I cooked the beejezus out of this soup (probably 18 hours in a slowcooker after beans soaking for 12) to get it nice and thick, but oh man it was worth it.  Also, pureed half in a blender about 12 hours in.  My parents found it too spicy- i blame the jalapeno juices.  Boyfriend and I inhaled it.  What a simple, spicy delight.  Will definitely make again, despite long cook time.  It just sits in a crockpot while I go about my day and eventually I have awesome soup!

What a great recipe!  Nice and spicy and full of flavor - the house smelled wonderful all day. I used fresh jalapenos and added a little extra cumin.    I like a mix of creaminess and whole beans, so I blended half of it and mixed the two parts together again.  I served it garnished with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of cilantro.  I will DEFINITELY be making wonderful soup again - thanks for sending it in!

I was surprised - it was very, very good. I added smoked ham hocks and I didn't have a jalapeno pepper or chili sauce when I threw it in the crockpot. I planned to buy it early enough to be able to add it, but didn't get around to it. I thought it would turn out bland or lacking, but the cayenne and chili powder really added a lot of great taste. An hour before it was finished, I blended some of the beans and it thickened the soup perfectly. We had leftovers for two days and it was just as delicious. This is a keeper!

Made this in a slow cooker. YUMMY! I used Black beans, Cranberry beans. I rinsed them and boiled them and covered them over night. I sauteed onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, & japs in EVOO and then it all goes in the slow cooker. Top w/Pico De Gallo or chopped onions, sour cream and cilantro!  Thank you TOOBUSY2!!!

Sauteed garlic, onion, carrot, celery and mushroomsin a little olive oil.  Used canned beans and chicken stock.  Put it through food processor.  Found it plenty spicy enough without hot pepper sauce.  Enjoyed it with ribbons of spinach and a dollop of sour cream.

Pretty good but a little watery.  Do NOT increase liquid- if anything decrease it a little bit.  I also took some out and blended it up to make it a little thicker.  Pretty good soup.

Simple and easy to make with ingredients I already had in the pantry.  The cumin added a nice zesty twist that livened up the bland taste that black means usually have and it also heightened the chili powder taste. I used less chicken broth and cooked in the crock pot and served on rice instead of like a soup.

I have made this several times, although I have gradually changed more and more. First, it has far too much chicken broth for my taste. 2-4 cups is plenty. I did not like it with only the jalapenos, but it is great with a can of tomatoes with jalapenos. I also add in an onion and extra garlic powder. With these changes it has become a staple in my house. I usually make it once every couple months.

Excellent!  Everyone went back for seconds (a few had thirds).   I noticed some reviewers didn't soak their beans, but I soaked mine overnight.   I used fresh garlic in place of garlic powder and added diced onion.  Before serving, I pureed some of the beans with a little bit of the liquid then added it all back to the soup to thicken it.  Outstanding!!

I am going to try to make this again, but I made it with canned black beans, and it needed more than I put in.  Regardless, the soup was very tasty, but a bit too spicy for my taste.  I will tone that down next time.

I'm going to give this 5 stars, as I think it's a great base recipe.  I thought the spice level was perfect, it had that kind of heat I look for in a comfort soup, something perfect on a cold day, etc.  I chose the option of blending parts of my soup, also added cornstarch to make it creamier.  I added a can of diced tomatoes.  It's a good base everyone can take and then add the things they like.  Yum!

This was delicious. Modifications: 3 cans beans,  1 can diced tomato,  1 can chicken broth, 1 pkg taco seasoning,  1/2 lb ground beef,  1 chopped onion, 1 can diced green chilies,  1 teaspoon jalapeno pepper.   Added all to crockpot. Followed the hint to blend 1/2 the soup to make creamier.  Topped with sprinkling of cheddar.  Will definitely make this again and wasn't too spicy.

Got endless compliments on this. It helped that I did boil the dry beans before adding them to the slow cooker. It made a world of difference. Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I'll use it again!

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I followed the advise from some of the other reviewers and added a can of diced tomatoes, chopped onions, and minced garlic.  I used canned black beans and vegetable broth.  Cooked on high for about 1 1/2 hours and low for about 2 hours.  This is something I will be making again and again.  Thanks!

Wonderful recipe!  My husband enjoyed it as well.

I made a few modifications based on the other reviews -- added onion, diced tomatoes with jalepenos, diced kielbasa, and a little chili seasoning.

Served with green onions and melted cheese on top.  Absolutely wonderful!!

This is the best of black bean soups! I doubled the dry spices rather than use the jalapeno and it had just the right amount of kick. I like using dry beans instead of canned beans. This soup is better than the black bean soup you'll find in most restaurants. I have already shared it with all four of my daughters. Great job! (Easy to make a nice vegetarian version, too, simply by using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.)

I thought this was great.  I followed the idea of adding Rotel - because how could that be bad.  Plus, I didn't have any jalapenos on hand, so figured that would add some spice.  I cut back a little on the cayenne and boosted the hot sauce a bit.  Then used the immersion blender to give it a little smoothness.  Mmmm - can't wait for dinner!

I've been on the hunt for a good black bean soup recipe for months now. This was the third recipe I've tried, and I'm so happy I found it! I will admit that I messed up the consistency - my bad, not the recipe's fault - but we ended up using the finished product as burrito filler, chicken topping, etc. The flavors were delicious! It had the perfect amount of kick to it to please me and my boyfriend, who loves it spicy. I'm excited to try this again and fix what I did last time to make the perfect soup. A couple things I did differently: I tried one reviewer's method of bringing the dry black beans and chicken stock to a rolling boil, then adding to the crock pot; they were more tender than beans I've had soak overnight! I didn't have any cayenne, so I threw in some hot sauce and Cajun seasoning I had on hand. Other than that, this recipe is excellent as is!

As I cooked this in the slow cooker I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it, but by the end, I pureed (with a hand blender), part of the soup to give it a creamier texture without being all creamed. Served with a lime crema (just mix fresh lime juice with sour cream- yum!) and it's beyond delicious!

This soup was so good!  I made it for dinner for my meat and potatoes loving boyfriend and even he ate a second bowl.  I must admit, I made several alterations though since I didn’t have the night before to prepare and had some substitutes in my pantry.  I used 4 cans of black beans instead of dry and a can of chunky rotel instead of the diced jalapeno.  I’m veggie, so I opted for 4 cups (the whole container) of vegetable broth instead of chicken.  I left the hot pepper sauce out and added 2 handfuls of chopped fresh cilantro.  I took others suggestions and about an hour before serving I blending half the soup and then returned it and also served the final bowl with a dollop of Greek yogurt, yum!

Wow my family loved this soup!  I made it exactly as described (we don't mind a bit of heat).  I can see topping this off with onions, cilantro, salsa, a bit of cheese, and/or tortilla strips and I think it might even be better.  I had some left over and so I stored it overnight.  What I noticed was that the beans soaked up more of the soup so it was not as soupy the second day but it still tasted great!

Really tasty, good basic recipe that can be adjusted any number of ways.  I added a half pound of chopped smoked ham, a heaping tablespoon of minced onion, and a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies.  I also used two whole jalapenos chopped finely rather than 2 teaspoons.  If you don't blend or mash the beans, you can remove them with a slotted spoon, and serve them as, well...beans.  (The blended, thickened version is good too.)  As I'm typing this review, I'm making this recipe for the third time--this has become a regular meal at our house.

Super spicy & good.  I soaked my beans over night  and then rinsed and brought them to a boil.  then transferred them to a crockpot with the chicken broth and spices etc...  I used jarred sliced jalapenos and not four teaspoons - and I didn't measure the hot sauce...just several shakes!  Wowser!  I did use my smart stick to puree most of it.  I also threw in a can of tomatoes with diced chilis at the last second.  I served with chopped onion & shredded cheese as toppers.  Excellent.  Will definitely make again and again!

I will no longer doubt a recipe when "spicy" is in the title.  I thought this would have a little kick to it, but it had a big kick.  I even left out the hot pepper sauce and it was still way too spicy.  I finished my bowl, but my husband could not. :)  Next time I make this I will use less jalapenos and less cayenne pepper.  I pureed half of the batch in the blender and then mixed it back in.  Really great consistency.  Will definitely make again.

I really loved this soup, but made quite a few changes (mostly to use up some leftovers).  I used some extra bouillon to make the chicken broth stronger than normal.  I also added four frozen boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I added a medium chopped onion, 6 small diced tomatoes, and used a heaping tsp of fresh minced garlic instead of the powder.  I decreased the amount of jalapeno and cayenne for picky guests, and omitted the hot pepper sauce, but I used about 2 heaping table spoons of chili powder, and 3 tbs of cumin.  I cooked it on low for 16 hours, and then served with sour cream.  My guests LOVED it.  I think this will be a go-to meal in the future when I need to use up leftover chicken or veggies.  It's a great canvas for experimenting, and you can't beat the price of dried black beans...

This was delicious!  I soaked the beans overnight but also boiled them before adding them to the slowcooker.  I also pureed about half the soup for a somewhat smoother consistency (but still chunky).  It was SPICY!  We loved it but for company I might tone it down a notch.

I love this recipe.  I double the beans to make it thicker.  I cut the jalapeno by half.  Still gives enough spice.  After it cooks, I will take about half and swirl in the blender to help thicken.  Excellent soup!

Added all ingredients in the crock pot the night prior and left in fridge while the beans soaked overnight. I used fresh jalepeno, cilantro, and red onion and added everything else as instructed. Due to the advise of another I added 2 packets of sazon which really enhanced the flavor. I opted also not to puree half the soup (my blender is broken). The soup came out perfect and not hot at all - the entire family loved it. I will make this again.

Excellent!  I have made this many times and also taken it to the Moose and to work on Bring A Dish To Share Day and the raves were lavish.  Only complaint was the spiciness from some of the Whooses but they still liked it as they complained! I add a Smoked Pork Joint which make a big difference.  Also green pepper, tomatoes with chilis and sometimes onion.

I love the flavor here and I'll be using this recipe (with changes) a lot. As is, this is ridiculously watery, but since practically everyone else has mentioned that, I feel kinda silly for not reducing the liquid to 4 c on the first try. I did mash up the beans by hand a bit at the end. Anyone who thinks this is lacking flavor might want to check the freshness of their spices or quality of their chicken stock.

Sorry but this soup just didnt work for me and the taste was terrible. I soaked my beans overnight and boiled them and still after cooking in the crockpot for 5 hours, it was just broth with semi-hard beans floating in it. Also, it didnt have much flavor. I love spicy food and this wasnt even near spicy enough for me. I put a whole chopped Jalapeno in it too. I ended up having to puree the whole batch, thinking I could save it. It looked like bad baby food and tasted even worse. So I ended up throwing a whole crock pot of beans away. I will try another black bean soup recipe next time.

This was so good, I can't believe I actually made it.  I added a can of diced tomatos and a handful of rice.

Next time, I'm going to try adding some spicy sausage, reducing the beans slightly and putting in a little more rice.  The spiciness was perfect.

Wow! I added a few more jalapenos and Habanero hot sauce, and this was indeed fiery. Brava, Lynn! I'm often disappointed with slow cooker recipes beacuse of their blandness, but I had no such problem here. Also, I added a tomato, onion, freshgarlic instead of garlic powder, and a bell pepper, and I served it with sour cream on the side. Make a big batch--I did, and it worked well tripled (often not the case with slow cookers) and stayed wonderful for lunch and dinner afterward.

Nice and spicy!! I used fresh chopped garlic rather than the powder and I also added fresh chopped onion. I substitued several spoonfuls of brine from the jalepenos for the Tabasco, as my husband doesn't care for the vinegar taste in Tabasco. We also added a ham bone which gave it an additional depth of flavor. I cooked for 6 hrs on high and then for another hour on low before blending some of the beans/broth to thicken. It was very good. Thanks.

Incredibly easy and tasty.  It wasn't as spicy as I thought it might be, but since tastes differ in our house, we put the tobasco on the table.  Served with brown rice it makes the perfect lunch or dinner on a cold day.

I have been looking for a spicy black bean soup recipe for years!  They all seem to have ham/ham hock in them and are meatier rather than spicy.  This was great!  Very spicy and I even left out the hot sauce, figuring that I could add it later (my husband is a baby!).  Thanks!

Fantastic recipe. I make some changes based on our tastes. We add the can of rotel, pork chops, and onions based on other reviews, and we substitute chipotle powder for cayenne pepper. We leave out the jalapenos so that the children will be able to eat it better. Otherwise we make it as-is. Definitely a family favorite.

Allow more time to cook for tender beans. Didn't add jalapenos and cut the chili powder quantity down to 2 tsp instead of the 1 tbsp.  Added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chili's.  Excellent recipe!

This is a great recipe base.  I am a vegetarian so I swapped the chicken broth for vegetable broth.  I prefer spicy food so I tripled the spices.  I served it over brown rice with grilled tofu.  I will make this again!

Not your ordinary Black Bean Soup.  I made this for dinner tonight and my husband requested the 5 star review.  Changes I made:  I added a diced onion, added a 28 oz can of tomatoes, used 2 lbs of dried beans, did not add jalapeno instead I added Tabasco, chipotle hot sauce and doubled all other spices.  A great basic recipe that I adjusted to our tastes.  Thanks

I really did not like this one. It was spicy but had no flavor, strangely. Was it my chicken broth? I don't know.....but I have to find some way to salvage this. I'm going to add corn, peppers, onions, and tomatoes tomorrow to kick up the leftovers.

This is a good soup!  I used slightly more than a pound of beans, only 4 cups broth and it was still more runny than I'd like.  It's spicy, but for me, just the right amount.  It is good and easy to make!

I soaked the beans for 9 hours and then cooked on high in the crock pot for about 3.5 hours. I wish I could rave about it like the others, but I can't. It's missing something. It just doesn't do it for me. I ended up draining the liquid and freezing the beans to use in another recipe and will probably start doing that on a regular basis.

Delicious! I added green pepper, onion and a can of diced tomatoes. Cooked 11 hours on low and it was perfect! Next time I will do a cup less broth as it wasn't as thick as we would have liked.

Very good. I omitted the cayenne since I don't have any at the moment.  I did not presoak or preboil the beans (I never do for the slow cooker), and they were just fine after five hours on high in the crockpot.  I let the soup cool a bit and pureed about a third of it, then added it back to the rest of it.  Served with sour cream on top to help mellow the spicy.  All in all, very good.

Didn't have any cayenne pepper or jalapenos so I sauteed an onion and added a tiny can of tomato paste for flavor. Came out great!!  Instead of soaking the dry beans overnight, bring beans & water to a rolling boil. Boil for 2 minutes.  Cover, remove from heat & let sit an hour.  Rinse & drain and then begin the soup recipe.

We were so impressed with this recipe! I had 2 cups of beef broth left over from another recipe so I used that plus 4 cups (one box) chicken broth and this was delicious. I also put some in the blender to thicken it up a little. I left the hot sauce out and added like a garnish. This is a spicy recipe and so full of flavor. We topped it with cheddar cheese, sour cream and fresh cilantro. Thank you for such a great recipe!!

Excellent!  I added coursely chopped celery, tomatoes, & carrots, and sauteed finely chopped onion & garlic.  The carrots were especially delicious!  Really great  - I was expecting to be disappointed, to be honest.  I omitted the cayenne pepper since I didn't have any on hand, and I think it was just hot enough.

Very good starter recipe.  Our family really enjoyed it.  I think this is a great recipe to add to to really make this soup your own.  Personally, I added a bit of chopped ham, finely diced onion, carrot, celery and a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  After the beans were tender I put about half of the mixture into the food processor with a half a block of cream cheese and then added it back to the remaining soup/beans.  Delicious!

One of my favorite soups by far!  So yummy with a dollop of sour cream on top.  I just toss it all in the slow cooker and let it go.  Quick, Easy, and YUM!

I did change it up with sauteed onion and garlic - blended some of the beans - added brown rice and also threw in some of the turkey I cooked up today that was in my freezer ($5.60 for 15 lbs.  :) )since Thanksgiving! I really am enjoying it for quick lunches to take to work! I look at soup recipes as a place to change things up a bit to fit your likes and dislikes. I also didn't use the jalapenos cause that's a bit too hot for me. I will make this again---and probably change it in another way!? Thanks!
UPDATE - I make this soup every 2 mos. and freeze in in 1 cup containers - I add a lg. onion sauted - fresh mushrooms - lots of cooked chicken - and shredded carrots - diced tom/gr. chilies..today I'm also going to add a can of blackeyed peas!! Yes - I have changed it a lot - but this is where it all started - I LOVE this soup and I have made it extra healthy!!  Again - Thanks!

My husband and I thought this recipe was great!  We only made a few modifications.  First, for those who thought the beans were too bland, there should always be some sort of fat added to dry beans when cooking.  It's very important to the texture and flavor.  I added four slices of smoked, thick-cut bacon and then fished them out before using my immersion blender to blend up some of the beans just before serving.  I also added about a teaspoon of mustard powder, a tablespoon of onion flakes, and a half-teaspoon of paprika.  I didn't have any fresh jalepenos, so I used pickled (hot), and they turned out great!  It was somewhat spicy, which we enjoy, but I imagine cutting back the cayenne and jalepenos would remedy that.  I also added about a half-cup of sour cream when blending (just slightly, for texture and consistency) at the end.  Serve with buttermilk cornbread, some shredded jack, and pico de gallo, and it's WAY better than chili!  This recipe is a definite keeper at our house!

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I served it over brown rice.  I ended up decreasing the spice because I was concerned it would be too spicy.  However, I found that didn't make it spicy enough.  Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! and easy!  I soaked the beans for about 6hrs and had no problem with hard beans.  I cooked for like 7hrs on low with maybe the 1st 1/2 hr on high.  I added 1/2 red onion, ham, and couple leftover slices of pepperoni.  I pureed 1/2 of the soup as others suggested and aded 3tbsp sour cream to the pureed mix before mixing it all back together.  It's awesome.

For our tastes, this recipe needed a lot of help to become flavorful.  I didn't have jalapenos but love spicy so used the hot sauce and cayenne pepper.  I used low sodium chicken broth b/c I like to control the amount of sodium.  I addeda little onion powder and left beans cooking on high when I left for work.  Returning home at lunch the house smelled delicious but the beans were incredibly BLAND.....I added salt, 3 heaping tablespoons of sofrito (bottled tomato based flavoring with green peppers, onions, garlic) and two drained cans of garlic and olive oil petite diced tomatoes.  Left cooking on high for another 2 hours then low for an hour to meld flavors....still had the spice but the additions really added flavor which for us was necessary served with rice and grilled chicken breasts.

5 stars!!!  I followed this recipe almost exactly- I did change chicken broth to veggie broth and I zapped it through the food processor to make it creamy.  I just love the texture of it pureed.  SO HEALTHY, AND YUMMY!  Definitely one to keep.

I was nervous about trying this because the ratings were so divided. But I'm happy to announce this rating is positive! I soaked my dry beans from 6pm until 12pm the next day. I only used 4 cups of broth, and I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and a diced Jalapeno pepper. Per another reader's suggestion, I also added one packet of Goya Sazon. When it was done I blended half of it, and served with cheddar cheese and sour cream. I will make this again.

I didn't add the jalepenos, as I didn't have any (plus, I figured my son wouldn't eat it so spicy). It was spicy even leaving those out! I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a pound of kielbasa. I soaked the beans overnight AND cooked them on high for 9 hours, and they still could have used more time to soften. Topped with sour cream and cheddar cheese, this soup was yummy!

I made this soup for my husband and his dad. I used 4 cans of black beans instead of the dry. They RAVED at the flavorful broth and spicy kick! Since then, I have experimented with adding italian sausage. It is a keeper in our house!!

I wish there was a 4.5 star rating for this recipe.  I had to make it without the jalepenos, since I did not have any on hand.  On tasting the soup, I was glad I had omitted them.  This soup is quite spicy - you have been warned!  My teen age daughter was unable to eat her "heartburn soup", my 6 year old wouldn't touch it.  My husband, teen age son and I thought it was good and liked  the "zing".  It was quick and easy to throw in the crock pot and the underlying flavor was very good. (And we love black bean soup with some crusty bread!) I used a potato masher when the soup was done to mash up about 1/2 of the beans and thicken it a bit. I will make it again, but next time I will use minced garlic rather than powder, add a chopped onion and a can of diced tomatoes.  I will definitely cut the cayenne and the hot pepper sauce in half if I am serving it to the kids (or company).

I replaced one of the cups of broth with a can of creamed corn, and added a can of regular corn.  I also added a little salsa, cilantro, used veggie broth and omitted the hot sauce.  Next time I will add even more salsa or maybe even a can of diced tomatoes.  Loved it!

very good recipe!  I added half a large onion chopped up.  I used 6 cups of beef broth instead of chicken.  I also put about 1/4 of it in a blender at the end and pureed it.  I also added the jalepeno pepper to the blender and I only used half a pepper.
Very yummy with a little mexican cheese and sour cream on top.

The flaors in this soup were very nice. I did what others sugessted and blended 1/2 of the bean mixture about an hour before I served it and it was a nicer thick consistancy - more like a stew/chili. We served it over rice with cheese and green onions - yummy! AND, the next day I had leftovers on nachos and used some as dip - very useful in a number of ways!

This was wonderful! I used only 3-4 cups chicken broth & processed the black beans because I like a thick black bean soup. This is quite spicy, so I'd add spices by taste so you don't get too much. By others' suggestion, I added garlic, onion, cilantro & lime juice. I will make this over & over again!!!

Extra tasty. Instead of jalepenos, I used a can of diced green chilies. I only had 5 1/2 cups of chicken broth and it worked out fine. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and green pepper. It would have been good with onions too, but I didn't use any this time. I pureed half the soup, and we ate all of it over a couple of days. Very easy to make.

Excellent simple soup - did some thickening with a stick blender directly into the crock 30 minutes before serving. Was not too hot for anyone, but I used seeded, diced fresh jalepenos instead of canned. Served with homemade tortilla chips and rice cooked with onion and olive oil for a little extra flavor.

Couldn't have been simpler to make!

Great basic black bean soup... add a ham bone to the beans while they are cooking and you will not be sorry!  I serve it with pico de gallo and sour cream!

The overall outcome for this soup was great.I doubled up on spices except for cayenne and hot sauce, added chopped onions, red/green peppers, fat free cheddar cheese and cilantro.  I omitted the jalapeños, I'm not crazy about super spicy food. For a creamier texture, after the soup was done I scooped half of soup with measuring cup, putting it in the blender for a couple of seconds which made texture perfect. The soup was delicious  has a little kick of spice and kid friendly,  my 6yo loved it as well.

For me, this is the perfect amount of spicy. I mashed up the beans a little bit with a potato masher. It was delicious.

I loved this recipe. I soaked the beans the night before and put everything into a crockpot. The beans were perfect. I had black beans on a small flour tortilla, fresh sliced avocado and a dash of sour cream. A simple meal but delicious. The recipe makes meals versatile and time saving with the crockpot. Will make it many times to come. Thank you for a great recipe.

Very good recipe.  I threw in a can of rotel, diced red onion, diced green pepper.  I think you definitely have to blend half of the soup at the end or it's texture just isn't right.  Also - I soaked the beans overnight, but I think a bit of boiling would have been better - like people said.  I will make again for sure.  Thanks!

As I am a vegetarian, I substituted the chicken broth for vegetable.  Was a little bland, next time will add onions, green peppers and tomatoes.  And if you use dry beans, either boil them on the stove top or add lots more time than 6 hours to your crock pot time.  Dry beans will not get quite as tender in the pot in 6 hours even if you soak them overnight. All in all, good soup though. Will for sure make again! :)

This is so good! I am a guy who cannot boil water, but I made this in less than 10 minutes and is my favorite soup.  I used real jalapenos and reduced sodium chicken broth.  I think a little ground pork or beef would be awesome!

I adore this recipe.  It has been my go-to recipe for dried black beans for a couple years now.  I make large batches and freeze them in smaller portions.  I use it for black beans in recipes all year.  In cold weather months, I take it out and eat it as soup.  It's so versatile and delicious.  I've had people ask me how I flavored my black beans in various dishes I've prepared, and I always refer them back to this one.  Love it.

The recipe, as is, is not bad. However, I did find it a little bland. It wasn't until I found a packet of Goya Ham flavoring that the recipe came alive.

I cut the spices in half and didn't use the hot sauce and it was still pretty spicy. That's a matter of taste, but I can't imagine what it would have been with all the chili powder and cayenne. It was VERY soupy, even with removing 2-3 cups of the beans at the end and blending them to make it creamy. I didn't love this soup.

Very good. I used Bob's Red Mill Black Bean Soup Mix and kept the seasonings the same.  When it was done, I added one can of drained diced tomatoes. It was quite thick, so I served it with brown rice.

Loved it!  used a stick blender to puree some of it and added a can of corn and a can of diced carrots.  The sweetness of the carrots worked well with the spice.  Serve with brown rice... yum.

I made this soup for a girls night and it was a huge hit! I added the dice tomatoes with green chilies as suggested and mushed up some of the beans to make this thicker.   I also added some red pepper flakes, diced red onion, fresh cilantro, and a can of corn.  We toped it off with diced tomatoes, cheese, sour cream and a little more cilantro! sooo good!

Solid! It was easy, tasty, hearty, healthy, and had just the right amount of kick! I added a can of diced tomatoes and a chopped onion. I didn't add jalepeno peppers. I boiled the beans for 45-60 min. instead of soaking them overnight. The recipe offers a great base recipe from which you can play around.

Great recipe. Didn't change a thing. It was a little spicy for my teens, but adding a little sour cream and cheese took away some of the bite of the jalapeno. Served it with a sourdough French baguette (kind of like at Panera Bread). Delicious!

We LOVED this recipe, but we did make a few alterations because of our personal preferences. We love how spicy this recipe is and we even added a little bit more hot pepper sauce. We also sauteed and added an onion to the slow cooker and stirred in fresh cilantro before serving. Served with croutons. Yum!

Delicious! We used less of the spices because our 2 year old was eating it. Add quacamole and sour cream into the soup at serving at it is a home run!

This was OK...I felt like it needed something else though then just spice and beans...maybe diced tomatoes or something? If I try it again, I may add tomato and corn.

This is EXCELLENT! I lived in Brazil for 5 years and this is as good as any I had in all levels of restaurants in Rio. Warning: Jalapenos, Chili Powder, Cayenne Pepper, AND Hot Pepper Sauce? I am Latino and enjoy Jalapenos with just tortilla chips... But this? I advise you cut something as I cut out the Jalapenos, although you may like it as written.  Still, a delightful side dish.  And, if you like this, you will love eating Fejoada, the national dish of Brazil. Simply put, it is this recipe plus a couple of ingredients. The recipe is on this site. Enjoy! Back to my bowl of Black Beans....

i made it less spicy by adding only 1 jalepeno and a pinch of cyanne pepper. I alos added 1 tsp garlic salt(ommiting regular garlic) and 1 cup of salsa. I didn't have any chicken broth.

This was a great soup! I added 1 can of tomatoes (because I love tomatoes) and served the soup with cheese quesadillas. I will definitely make this again!

An amazing and simple soup. Only changes I made was I added some diced onion and pepper and subbed vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. I will definitely be making this again!!

This soup is fantastic with a bit of a kick...just right for a hearty winter soup.  I took half and place in a blender for a thicker consistency, then returned it to the soup.   My husband who hates bean soup had 3 bowls of it!!!   Corn chips on the side go well with this.  Keeping this recipe.

We loved the taste of this soup, but did agree that it was a little spicy. Next time, we will reduce the jalapenos by half and serve the rest on the side, along with reduced fat shredded cheese and reduced fat sour cream. We eliminated the garlic powder and used 1 1/2 t of garlic salt, instead. About halfway through, we used a potato masher to smush up some of the beans. 2 hours of simmering later, the consistency was perfect! Nice and creamy, and no blender used. Also, we made this on the stovetop, not the slow cooker. Total cooking time was about 3 hours.  We'll make it again. Enjoy!

This is wonderful soup!  The spice is just right.  I used two good-sized jalapeno peppers and the spices it called for.  I put in fresh garlic, some onion and some green pepper and they just added more yumminess.  I also blended the soup a little with an immersion blender to give it some thickness.  I WILL make this again.

Easy and tasty. I didn't have jalapeno, so I used dried red chili. Still nicely spicy. I also added onion, carrot and celery to mine, sauteed with the spices before I added it all to the crockpot. Seems like a really adaptable recipe.

I made this soup for my family and even the Grandchildern liked it.  I added a little extra Mexican Chili pepper but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Will certainly make it again.

I know that this was rated really good by a lot of people but it didn't suit my taste. Chilli powder was too strong, should have been left out completely. I had to add rosemary, celery salt, garlic, 2 onions and some left over pork roast to make it edible. In the end it came out well. I always appreciate trying new recipes but for me this one was not a winner.

This a really good base for a great soup.  I added about a half cup of diced onions and a half pound of bacon that I had browned in a skillet together.  An imersion blender used lightly gives it a more authentic touch I think.

Very good recipe.  But it's too spicy, and coming from me that's saying something.  Perhaps my jalapenos were particularly potent, but I think it was too much cayenne.  Add 1/2 the amount, you can always add more if needed later.

Excellent. Use your judgment on the level of spices; it's always easier to add than subtract. It's a solid recipe.  I soaked the beans overnight, and they were definitely done after 4 hours in the slow cooker. I just finished making a batch with smoked pork neck bones added for extra flavor -- I highly recommend this recipe either way.

I just made this and have already shared the recipe.  I like tomatoes and rice with mine, so after it cooked I stirred in a can of petite diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of jasmine rice.  Very, very good!

Absolutely delicious.  I skipped the jalapenos and hot sauce to keep the soup kid friendly and instead added diced green peppers, onions and corn.  I let the soup cook on low all day then used a potato masher during the last hour of cooking to thicken it a bit.  Yum!

This is a staple in our home! The very first time I made it, I added all of the 'heat' and only my husband loved it. Now I make it regularly without the cayenne pepper or jalapenos or hot sauce and the whole family enjoys it (kids too)! I actually use this recipe for my pinto beans too (add a ham hock) and they are delicious this way! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this yesterday and thought it was delicious.  I soaked my beans overnight, used the recommended ingredients except for using pickled jalapeno slices (about 1/4 cup) because I didn't have fresh and also I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I cooked it on low for about 10 hours then used an immersion blender to thicken it up.  We served this soup with shredded cheddar and fresh cilantro.  It was spicy, but not too much for us.  We will definitely make this again!!

This was delicious and incredibly easy to make.  The spices were just right to me - not sure why someone would make this recipe if they don't like spice.  Also, I don't see any need to pre-cook the beans before adding to the crock as others suggested.  Before I turned the heat to low, I filled up my blender and pureed then mixed back in with whatever beans were left in the crock.  This really helped thicken up the soup, but still left some whole beans for texture.  Also added some chopped up turkey bacon at this time (ham or sausage would be good too).  I served with chopped green onion, shredded mexi-cheese, and lite sour cream (sour cream also helps cut spice for those who need it).  You could also top with a few sliced jalapenos and or chopped tomatoes. If serving as a meal, you'll feed five at the most.  But there is plenty of room in the crock pot to double the recipe if you need to serve more.  Will definitely be making this again.

People really need to rate based on the recipe as written and not on their changes. As written, this is the pitts. As others have described, it's beans floating in gray water. Mashing the beans is without a doubt crucial - I just took a potato masher and began squashing them in the crock pot. Also crucial is doing something to add flavor to this boring bland blah dish. I sauteed up some onions and turkey bacon since that's what I had on hand. Then I ended up topping it with a little cilantro, sour cream, salsa and guacamole and looked at the final outcome of my dish and wondered to myself why I bothered with this and didn't just make fajitas with canned black beans.
Hate to give bad reviews :( sorry.

I love the flavor of this soup.  As others have suggested, it can be dressed up with avocado, sour cream, cheese, tortilla chips, onions, etc.  Also, when the family was tired of soup, I drained the liquid off and used the beans as filling for burritos and as a topping for salads.  This recipe makes a lot of soup!

This is VERY spicy, a little to spicy for a soup. At least for everyone who tried it when I made it. But great for other things. I pureed it all and put small amounts in plastic baggies and put then in the freezer so all I do is pull one out and let defrost and I cut the corner off and squeeze it out to make a great quesadillas! I am going to make more when I run out to have on hand! Thanks!

Wow! This soup is so good! I served it with sour cream, cheese, and green onions with tortilla chips on the side. Also, this is seriously one of the easiest recipes I have ever made. I did puree the soup at the end of the cooking time with a stick blender and I also added a couple of tablespoons of corn starch to thicken it up. I did not add the diced tomatoes like other reviewers suggested--I didn't think the soup needed it. Also, I did soak my beans overnight and then followed the cooking times exactly and the beans turned out soft just like they should. I will definitely be making this soup again and again. Thanks!

YUM! This was so good and exactly what I was looking for! I did make some changes, so it would be exactly like the black bean soup that I had in mind. I added garlic cloves, an onion, carrots, and a can of tomatoes. I also decreased the spicy spices just a tad. And I pureed the whole thing with my immersion blender. This one will be made again and again!!

This recipe is excellent as is. My only modification, a bit more chili powder and I use fresh Jalapenos (2 diced), not canned.

This was okay. I blended almost half like some of the reviews said and it gave it the consistency of refried beans. The flavor was about the same as refried beans and worked better as a dip than  as a soup.

BUT, the color and look was HORRIBLE. My kids didn't want to eat it, neither did my husband. He said it looked like, um, a bodily function gone wrong.

That is not the fault of the poster, but I just don't see how this would be appealing to anyone. My husband said to throw out the recipe.

This soup is fantastic.  I make this all the time.  I like to kick it up a little more than most with extra jalepeno, chili flakes, cilantro, lime juice, and hot sauce. Spicy!  Excellent brainless recipe that I will continue to make over and over.

Very good and hearty, good spice level.  I might add 2 c. more broth next time.  Also, I didn't have any jalapenos, so I threw in some spicy Ro-tel.  Added a chopped green pepper and 1/2 c of brown rice for the last half hour.

I think that this has real potentional (which is why I'm giving it 4 stars) but my version was SO hot/spicy that I couldn't eat it. In the middle east we have different peppers so I have to experiment and figure out how much of each kind to put in.

I also added onions, sazon and stewed tomatoes with chilis. Next time I'll use less broth. I left out the fresh jalapenos and added Emeril's haberno spiced smoked chicken sausage. Thought it came out terrific, and the sausage really "kicked it up a notch!"

Definitely the best black bean soup.  I use this recipe every year.  I add 1lb sweet italian sausage and shred carrot into it as well for color.  Very good the next day to and serve with bite sized tortilla chips and dip, too.   You could also top with a dab of sour cream.  Very tasty.

I've made this a couple of times now and my family really enjoys it. My kids think it's a little on the spicy side, but my husband loves it that way. Next time I think I'll cut back on the jalepenos and let hubby spice up his own bowl.

I let it cook all day long in the crock pot...at least eight hours. I also mash about half the beans for a thicker soup. The only other deviation I make from the recipe is to use fresh jalepenos (rather than canned) and several tablespoons of fresh cilantro when I first mix it up.

We top it with shredded cheese, fresh chopped cilantro and a dollop of sour cream and serve hot cornbread on the side.

Very yummy (and I made it really spicy). I added some shredded chicken to it to make it a little heartier and a dollop of crema (or sour cream would work) for a more creamy consistency. I think adding some fritos, tortilla chips, or corn bread would also set t his dish off.

This was not soup. This was black beans in spicy black watery-ness. I was able to salvage the beans by making Vegan Black Bean soup from this site, which, by the way, is really good. I won't make this again.

Very good!  Often 'spicy' recipes aren't really spicy, but this one is. Well, I may have been a little heavy-handed with the spices! :) I pureed 2/3 of the batch to thicken it up.  Much better consistency.  Topped it with sour cream and green onions.  Wonderful!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful soup!  After reading reviews, I added canned diced tomatoes, chopped onion, cilantro and a little leftover lime juice that needed to be used.  I did run half of it through the food processor to thicken it up.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious!  Although, I did have to modify it with what I had.  I used 3 15oz cans of black beans and only 4 cups of broth (I like it thick).  I substituted crushed red pepper flakes for the hot pepper sauce and omitted the jalepeno.  After the cooking finished I purreed the soup.  We garnished with tortilla chips, jack cheese, avacados, and diced onions...yummy!

Very, very spicy!  This was the best soup ever!  I made it quick by using canned black beans, a can of mild diced green chiles instead of jalepenos and I added a can of finely diced tomatoes.  Also, I added a small amount of ground cooked sirloin with onions.  Makes an entire meal!  Yummy!

This recipe was a little dull on its own, so I added some onions, celery, cilantro, & stewed tomatoes to jazz it up a little.  The tomatoes, especially, helped to round out the flavor of the broth so that it didn't just taste like chili powder.  This is also very tasty using vegetable broth, for you vegetarians out there.

Very easy to make & VERY well received.  It's not really spicy, so don't worry too much if you're faint at heart.  The fire-eaters can spice up theirs later on.

I think this recipe was just fabulous.  I added one large chopped onion, reduced the cayenne pepper by half (the hubby and kids don't like things too hot), and I was generous with the chili powder and cumin.  It did also need a little bit (~1 tsp) of salt.  The kids and hubby both loved it, and it was very easy to start in the morning before work.  I left it on high all day, and reduced it to low when I returned from work, and let it cook on low for about two hours before dinner time.  Very filling, and very healthy recipe.

This was my first attempt and not the last.  It is a good base for black bean soup butI felt it needed a little more substance; I put about 2/3 of the beans in a bowl with some of the liquid and used an immersion blender to puree it. I added it back into the crockpot and it thickened up really nicely.  I served it with tomatoes, sour cream, quacamole and tortilla chips in it or on ths side. It was fabulous. Thanks!

I love slow cooker meals, and this one is no exception.  It makes the house smell heavenly, and it's ready when you get home from work.

I usually cut the beans in half as well as the broth, but not the seasoning, as it's just my husband and I, and we don't need a ton of leftovers (although we always have a little bit, which is nice).  I also cook it on low instead of high since it cooks all day while we're at work.

Outside of cutting the beans and broth quantity in half, I follow the recipe as is but also add a bay leaf as well.  The soup is wonderful by itself, but we will sometimes drain the juice and place the beans in a tortilla along with cheese and scrambled eggs for a breakfast black bean burrito.  Wonderful.  Love this recipe!

I made a few adjustments, based on prior reviews, and it turned out delicious. I didn't soak the beans overnight, I brought them to a boil on the stove and then added them into a hot crock pot. I added two small ham hocks while they were cooking, because everything tastes better with a little smoked pig in it. When the hocks were falling apart, and the beans mostly done, I added in two chopped bell peppers and a small can of diced tomatoes. I served this over rice with fresh cilantro. So good! Definitely trying this again.

I ended up with a watery, lackluster soup with chewy beans. Six cups of chicken broth is WAY too much. When I served the soup it was nicely spicy but lacked any depth or complexity at all. To remedy this  I added raw chopped onion, shredded cheese, and a healthy dollop of greek yogurt to each bowl.

i wasn't trying to make a soup out of this but wanted some direction to cook black beans from scratch as my first attempt was a fail.. glad i read wannabechef7's review.. i made sure to bring the beans to a boil (after 6 hours of soaking) and then after 4 hours of being on high in the crock pot it was nearly done.. turned it down to low for about an hour and it was completely done.. i omitted the jalapeno, cayenne, and hot pepper sauce because i wanted more generic black beans.. used beef broth in place of chicken.. this was awesome.. ty so much for the recipe and new found confidence in making black beans!  ~~UPDATE: this time i added all the ingredients.. i cut the cayenne in half and it had a nice bite on the end.. i still used beef bouillon for the chicken broth.. it was a nice variation for what i'm used to.. ty again for this wonderful recipe

This was a fantastic recipe!  I simmered the beans for 10 minutes and allowed them to soak overnight.  The texture was perfect.  Based on other reviewers, and knowing I don't like super spicy foods, I only put in 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and I served it with a dollop of sour cream.  Otherwise I stayed true to the recipe.  Excellent!  The leftovers are fantastic for lunch too!

I followed a lot of the tips from reviewers and added a can of diced tomatoes, diced onion, etc, and I toned down the spice a lot because I'm weak sauce that way. It was really yummy and super easy to make. Topped with shredded mozzarella cheese.

The flavor of this soup is amazing!  I was afraid it would be too spicy, but with a dollop of sour cream it is just right.  

One thing that I wold change is the amount of liquid.  It seemed to be too thin.  Other than that it was wonderful and I will definately make it again.

I just made this and agree with others that it's very hot. Cutback on cayenne and chili powder and skipped Tabasco. Used a hand blender, but left some whole beans. It's on the thin side, but that's what I've been looking for. A Mexican restaurant used to serve a soup like this with sides of onions, salsa, cilantro, cheese, avocado, fried tortilla chips, and sour cream. This is the perfect base to serve with those sides and let guests customize their bowl.

Great basic recipe. I simmered the dried beans in water about 30 minutes and then let them soak in the broth overnight in fridge. This made more sense to me. They can be absorbing the flavor.

great recipe.  I added the end of a honey ham to the crock pot and cooked all day on low.  Husband loved it and he usually doesn't like black beans.

This recipe was really good! I used canned beans instead of dried, added a little less japlapeno and skipped the hot pepper sauce altogether.  My boyfriend, who hates vegetables and isn't the biggest soup guy, LOVES this recipe.  I love how simple it is.  Definitely blend about a quarter or less of the soup to get a thick, saucy texture.

I wish I could give this 10 stars! I add a can of Ro-Tel and use hand blender to thicken before serving with cilantro and lime wedge. SO GOOD. I wish I had thought to make this yesterday so I could enjoy it tonight.

This was OK.  I thought by soaking the beans overnight would make them softer by the time the cooking (crock pot) was over. NOT!  I see why some put this in the blender - which I don't have. I think that would have solved the problem!  Decent taste tho.

Great recipe. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of all the additions I made to make it flavorful. I added some fresh garlic, more chili powder and pepper sauce because we like it spicy, and some bottled salsa (which makes all the difference!). I followed the suggestion of pureeing half of the soup which made the consistency excellent. Serve with a little sour cream on top and it becomes even more delicious.

This was okay.  I added some diced red onion and some cilantro to give it a little more flavor.  Not the best I've ever had but really easy to throw together.

I also thought this was really good - made exactly as specified, although I added salt (My broth was no fat, no sodium and I definitely thought salt was needed!)

I also pureed about half the soup and returned to the crockpot to cook for about another hour.  Topped with a sprinkling of shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream and homemade cornbread on the side.  YUM! 

It was a TOUCH spicy for me, but I a wimp - my husband thought it was perfect.

I soaked my beans overnight and they were plenty tender without boiling them first.  I added a  can of rotel per another review.  I served this over rice with cilantro and lime and a little diced tomato on top.  It was delicious.

Sooo delicious!! I'm very picky because I want things spicy, so I added extra cayenne, jalapeno, and rotel with green chiles. I definitely agree with boiling the beans before putting in the crock pot. I hate cooking and this was so simple and delicious!!! My hubbie even liked it and he hates when I make soup!!

This was fantastic! I have never made beans or black bean soup before so I followed recipe exactly. We ate this with white rice, sour cream, shredded cheese and homemade and homemade corn tortilla (we used tortillas instead of untensils). It was delicious! I can see how others will change it up as a great base soup, but I found it fantastic as is. My husband loved it. It is spicey and not for those who don't enjoy a little kick. Thank you for sharing this!

Very good! I also recommend the can of diced tomatoes and pureeing half of the beans to make it thicker. Added some chicken which I think was a good idea. I may decrease the broth a little (5 cups) next time to make it a tad thicker. Yum!

I love this recipe because it's very basic.  One can customize the recipe to their liking- I took out all the spices.  The next time I make it I'll add sausage, onions, carrots- you get the idea.

I really like this recipe a lot. I only had a can of mild green chiles so I used that instead of the jalapenos, yet it was still pretty spicy. I like spicy food so it was good for me but my husband thought it was too spicy. I used 5 sups of broth as recommended by others b/c I like thicker soup. I also blended some of the soup and it was quite good.

Based on several reviews I decided to cut down to 5 cups broth and added 1-1/2 cups sour cream which helped thicken it up, but letting it sit overnight really helped.  Threw in 2 diced andouille sausages, 1/2 onion & minced garlic instead of powder.  The next morning I scooped out 1/2 the beans and put them in the food processor.  Even without the seeds in the jalapenos this was a 4 on a spicy scale of 1-5 (and that's with sour cream added!!)  Topped with crumbled Queso Rancherito.  Tasty!

This soup was REALLY yummy! It made quite a lot too, so we had leftovers for days afterwards. I didn't find the recipe too spicy at all, in fact, I wish I'd added spicier chilis (we used green chilis instead of jalapenos). I wanted a bit of texture, so I didn't puree the soup, but I did take a flat spatula and smush about half the beans up.     For changes, I didn't make many. Based on the pictures that people have provided, I thought I might want the soup to be a bit creamier, so I added a half a cup of half-and-half. Also, to cut down the sodium content, I only used one can of broth. But really, the soup would have been 100% fine with just water!    Overall, delicious and something I will be making again for sure!

I've never made a black bean soup before but this was delish! I only had 1 can of black beans, and I added a finely chopped onion, 1/2 cup very spicy salsa and a can of tomato sauce. I pureed before serving and added 1/2 cup of light soy milk to cut the spice.

I thought this was a fantastic soup.  I made it as directed except added half a can of corn because my boyfriend just loves corn and threw in some cooked chicken drumsticks - also because he loves meat.   The spice amount is perfect, its incredibly tasty.  I just love this soup! Perfect for a cold evening.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream and a bit of shredded cheese on top. SUPER YUM. Thanks for this recipe! Definately a keeper!!

Really good flavor but definitely needs a little salt.  Also, my beans were way too firm so I didn't get the creamy texture I was hoping for.  (I soaked 12 hours overnight and cooked 12 hours on low.)  Once I figure out how to get softer beans this will be perfect!

I made this today for a luncheon with my friends and everyone loved it!  The only changes I made were to use vegetable broth to make it vegetarian, and used 1/2 the jalapenos which was plenty.  I also used my hand blender to blend it at the end to make it thick.  Delicious!  Everyone loved it.

I have never made black bean soup before so I am not sure if I did something wrong. While I like extremely spicy food the cayenne pepper was way too much.  There was nothing tasty about this soup.

This is a very good soup to add to one's recipe collection.  I did cut back on the heat and it still had a good flavor.  I also, used my immersion blender to give the soup a little more thickness.  Too top of the soup I added a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of cheese and served it with cheese-its.

I am a HUGE black bean soup fan, but this one just did not do it for me. I followed the recipe exactly, but the beans were never softened (for future cooks, be sure to boil the beans, even though the bag directions do not tell you to). Even after running the soup through with the immersion blender, it was still WAY too runny for our tastes.

Very good, not too spicy.  I added onion - everything tastes better with onion!! I also used my immersion blender to thicken it up a bit.  Would make it again on a cold winter day.

This was really cheap, easy and delicious! I added about 1 cup of leftover refried black beans, which helped thicken the soup a bit.  Note that black beans don't need to be soaked overnight, just boil them for 10 minutes before adding them to the slow cooker with everything else.

Taste was pretty good on this soup, but I think that next time I will probably add some smoked sausage to make it a little more substantial.

First, unless you have a certain type of food processor, DO NOT PUT SOUP IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR. It made a *huge* mess trying to chop it all up in my food processor. Second, next time I'm going to use more beans as the soup was still kinda thin after processing. Third, this soup is really a cross between chili and soup. I wish it had been thicker like chili. Will I make it again? Perhaps but with my additions.

This is a delicious soup! I almost overcooked it in the crockpot, leaving me with a very thick soup, but it was still very good. I used leftovers for lunch the next day by putting the beans in a whole wheat quesadilla with chopped red onions, fat free mozzarella cheese (grated) , chopped cilantro and a bit of sour cream, I rolled it up and made the best black bean burrito I've ever tasted! Thanks for the recipe!

Sorry, this one just didn't work out for me. I soaked the dried beans overnight and then followed the recipe, but the beans were still hard at the end of cooking. I also thought that while it certainly had spice, it lacked flavor. I kept the leftovers and will try to salvage this by using it as a base for another black bean soup recipe I've found.

SO good...we love spicy food and this was right up our alley!  My husband loved this so much he had a second huge bowl of it!  He begged to take it to lunch during the week as well....we followed the other reviewers and doubled the spices.  It was great!

I make slow cooker recipes on work days so I'm not home change the temperature halfway through the cooking. I cooked this on low for 10 hours and it came out brilliantly. I definitely think that this soup needs the pureeing. For once I actually just seasoned as the recipe was written because I was running really late and I didn't have to adjust later as it was to my taste. I'll definitely add this to my regular rotation because it's easy and yummy.

husband gave 5 *s !!  kept spices the same (and included seeds from jalapenos) and although it burned my mouth a little, it wasn't the uncomfortable kind.

i included:  2 cans black beans, 1 can refried black beans, 1 can corn, 2 cans tomatoes w/ chiles -- all undrained -- and 1 can chicken broth.  perfect consistency!  served over rice with sour cream & cheddar -- which made it heartier and helped cut the spice.  i do think it would be just as good with only the black beans but have to trick some veggies into my husband somehow!

i used better than bouillon instead of chicken broth, which usually makes for much better soup; however, i have to admit that this soup does smell better than it tastes. not bad, but it needs something. i added cilantro as an afterthought and that definitely kicked it up. but it may be that the best black bean soup recipes call for tomatoes as part of the soup base. i recommend trying those instead.

Cooking time was way off - needed 3-4 MORE hours in crock pot.  It also required some sort of mashing - this step is not optional.  When complete, it was spicy, but lacked any other real flavor.

This was my first time making black bean soup and my husbands first time eating it. We both enjoyed it and will make again. I followed suggestions to add onion and fresh garlic. I also reduced the spice a bit since we don't care for things that are too spicy. Good flavor and simple.

Whoa, was it just me or was the cooking time really off?  I was planning on making  this for lunch so last night I brought the beans to a boil and let them soak overnight.  I then put the beans and everything else in the crock pot.  At lunch, the beans were still way too hard - that's with cooking on high the whole time!  So, I kept cooking them until dinner.  

The flavor of the soup was good.  I was worried that it would be too spicy based on my early taste tests but by the end of cooking, it wasn't nearly as spicy.  My husband's only complaint was that he thought the soup was a bit too boring with just the beans and stuff.  He wanted more in it.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I followed it exactly as written except the last hour of cooking I tossed in some brown rice to thicken it. I was using it for tortillas and it worked perfect!!  I think I may skip the rice next time so that  can just enjoy the soup.

This recipe was actually too spicy for me, though my boyfriend (less of a spice wuss) LOVED it.  I added the tomatoes with chiles as some users suggested, but didn't feel that it added anything.  When we got tired of having soup, we drained it and put the beans into burritos with guacamole, which made it easier for me to handle the spice.  Overall, very very good.

delicious spicy soup.I added the spices slowly. Starting with 1/4 tsp of spices and went up to 1 tsp. That worked for me. I used 1 cup of chicken broth not 6. I am keeping this recipe.

I altered this recipe slightly, and it was DELICIOUS.  I used one can of chopped green chiles in place of the jalapeno and omitted the cayenne (two small children in the house!).  I also added a pint of homemade salsa at the end of the cooking time and ran my hand blender through it a couple of times.  This didn't make it smooth, just thickened it somewhat.  I served it with sour cream, cheddar, and tortilla chips.  Leftovers were awesome!

I used this recipe to make a good taco salad (just pureed some of the beans to make it thicker). The recipe was very easy and tasted good, but nowhere near as good as my husband's black beans (and he will not share the recipe!). Definitely worth your time to try.

Too hot for me even when I didn't use the jalapenos.  It just wasn't enjoyable that hot.  Will use what is left to serve over rice to try to tone down the hottness.

I followed the changes as suggested by StephanieV, and I also changed the chicken broth to vegetable stock to make it vegetarian. We all loved it. I also made (recipes from this website) "Colorful Vegetable Fajitas" and "Guacamole". It was a great meal.

Very good soup, but I agree that some of the beans must be pureed to thicken it up. Didn't find it to be at all too spicy. Very good flavor. :-}

This is a good recipe to start with, but I felt it needed a little something.  I added some beef base for a little extra flavor and some tomato paste to thicken it.  Really good with the "Navajo Fry Bread"

GREAT STARTER RECIPE!! I gave only 4 stars b/c I made some modifications as follows: no diced chili peppers or pepper sauce, 4 c chicken broth, 3 cloves fresh garlic, 1 T cumin, 1.5 c sauteed onions, 1/2 of a fresh green pepper for flavor removed prior to eating, pieces of ham chopped up &  ham bones for flavor, added 1 can of petite diced tomatoes w/mild green chilis 1 hour prior to serving, I also pureed about 1/3 of the beans and added back. Topped each serving w/ Mexican cheese & sour cream...DELICOUS! Leftovers can easily be heated up or used in burritos or tacos!

I used canned beans to save time.  Pretty delicious!  Garnished with a dollop of sour cream to cut the spice a tad.

Hot as hell but I can't stop eating it! Tastes soooo good with Mexican style sour cream. I keep stirring it in and topping it off with diced onions. I made it with 1 canned black bean, 1 can refried black bean with jalepeno pieces and 1 can creamy white beans for lack of a better match. I added the latter to cut the spice, I am sensitive to jalepeno.

wonderful recipe! I took 3/4 of the cooked beans and a can of diced tomatos and juice and put in blender to give it more of a soup consistency - otherwise its more like beans in juice.
I am going to add a cup of frozen corn to it as well. Go easy on the cayenne pepper if you don't like the heat. It's so spicy it is addicting!

I thought this was pretty good for something you make in the slow cooker. Hubby and I are actually away from the house for more like 11 hours a day so I soaked the beans the night before and then put them in on low all day. they were perfect! I may add onions next time. Thanks!

My family loves this recipe. I don't add jalapeno's (small children) but do add a can of rotel mild tomatoes and chilis and corn. Even better the next day, if it lasts that long!

I loved this recipe!!!!  I did not want it quite as spicy so I cut down on the Cayenne Pepper.  I also pureed the soup.  Other than that I would not change a thing!  If you like really spicy use the recipe as is.  My husband and I both raved about this recipe.  I will make it again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

simply amazing!!!  i couldn't find the cayenne, so that was omitted, and i cooked it on low for 10 hours.  also, i like it really thick so towards the end i mixed up some corn starch with water and got the consistency i liked.  i served each bowl with a dollop of sour cream and salsa and fresh cut cilantro and my family LOVED it!!!

I wouldn't say it's the THE BEST, but I am going to try some others. I cooked mine on low setting for over 8 hours. I addes cilantro, 2 bay leaves and fresh garlic to the recipe. Also, it's great to add half and half or sour cream after it's done, it will have a nice creamy texture. My beans were not hard, I soaked them for a day and half. It was really good, just not great.

I thought I had all my bases covered by following the other reviews and cutting down on the spices. I didn't even bother to serve it to my family as the beans never appeared to get done.  I soaked them for 10-12 hours the night before and followed the instructions to a 'T' as far as cooking time.  The soup was extremely thin, unlike any other black bean soup I've ever had.  Soooo...like others suggested, I pureed 1/2 the soup and mixed it back in.

This was a great soup. I will definitely make this again. I didn't use dry beans though, used 3 cans of black beans. I also didn't use the 6 cups of chicken broth. I used 3 14 oz cans and it still was very watery. After I blended some of the soup with my hand mixer, it thickened up just enough. I didn't add the jalapeno pepper or the cayenne, just some red pepper flakes. I didn't have any hot pepper sauce so I added a 2 tablespoons of medium salsa. I chopped up some onion and added also. Love it! Thanks!

Awesome flavor, perfect spicing. I made it with ingredients as written and it is a great simple soup. I would probably add onions next time but I love onions. I did cook it on high for at least 6 hours because I like my beans really soft.

Great recipe - and so healthy!

I threw in a can of diced tomatoes, half a diced yellow onion and half a green bell pepper, and two diced chicken breasts. I garnished with shredded cheese, sour cream and sliced avocado. It was a big hit with everyone.

My only complaint was that the beans weren't soft enough. But that's my fault, as I didn't soak them over night - just for a few hours in the afternoon. I mistakenly thought that 6 hours simmering in chicken broth would get them tender enough. Not true! I guess it has something to do with cold water vs. hot? Will soak the full 12 hours next time.

This first food I have ever made that I threw away. It actually made me sick when I smelled it. Maybe other will have better luck.

These black beans have fantastic flavor.  They are incredibly easy to make.  When served in bowls, we add chopped fresh tomato and onion on top.

My family loved this - only gave it 4 stars because I did make some alterations: I minced 2 fresh jalapenos, added about half a diced onion, used fresh garlic rather than powdered,  reduced the amount of broth to about 4 1/2 cups and increased both the cumin and cayenne to our taste. That brought the spice level up to noticeable but definitely not overwhelming.

I would say I liked this, but did not necessarily love it. Definitely better the following day! Easy to make, which was nice,. I did follow the advice to boil the beans first, and I am glad I did. Felt I needed to also add more salt, which I typically do not do.

I used large can Eden organic black beans, 1/2 6oz can tomato sauce, 3 cups chicken broth, 1 fresh Roma tomato cut in quarters, 1/2 green pepper cut in 1/2 “ pieces, small sweet onion chopped, several cloves garlic, sliced thin, garlic powder shakes, small amt commercial taco seasoning, mild, 1 tsp cumin, generous shake of chili powder, two frozen celentro cubes, enough salt to taste, 1 tsp sugar, 2 tsp of jarred jalapeño, ... Fresh pepper and left out cayenne pepper and hot pepper sauce. Did not mash to thicken. (Next time, might add one frozen lime juice cube.) Very nice soup. Cooked 9 hours.

I always made black bean soup using canned black beans and this was the 1st time making the soup from scratch. It was pretty good, Little bit runny but that can be fixed by blending couple of cups of the soup. I did make few changes. I chopped and sauteed 1 onion and 1 green bell pepper and added them in the crock pot. Also, I cut down little on the cayenne and hot sauce for the kids. I served topped with some diced avocados and chopped cilantro.

This was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was use Chipotle Chile Powder since for some odd reason I was out of Cayenne.   Once the beans were to my desired doneness, I used a potato masher and mashed the beans a bit to make it thick and it was perfect.  I added a dollop of sour cream, some fresh cilantro and diced yellow onion.  I think some Cotija cheese on top would be delightful as well!

Very Good and it is now saved in my recipes. I actually kicked up the heat and spices a bit. I added some ham, and I used a potato masher to puree some of the beans in the crock pot which made it thicker.

Really spicy but I liked it.  I did remove some of the beans  to the food processor to make it a little creamy.  I would make it again.

I followed the recipe but also incorporated some of the recommendations from commenters such as adding a ½ cup of onion, some pork and bay leaves. I also threw in some small fresh tomatoes because they were getting old. The soup still needs perfecting however. It's not thick enough and something is missing but I can't put my finger on it.

Turned out great.... did not cook the full time, as I did not want the juices to cook down...so when I reheat it would be "soupy". Served with rice and sour cream.... yummie!!

I made this soup today and it was very flavorful and oh, so easy!  I loved that I didn't have to chop an onion.  It was quick and the best bean soup I've ever made.  I'll definitely make it again.

We are black bean fans to begin with. I cut the recipe in half but doubled the spices because we like them. I used  a serrano pepper and cut the hot pepper sauce out. I did use vegetable broth to accommodate the vegetarians and added cilantro the last few hours. I didn't soak the beans overnight, I  just brought them to a boil before placing in the slow cooker......where they remained for the night, on high......then the next day while I was at work, on high.... but the soup for dinner that night was fabulous! I'll just keep the cook time in mind the next time I make them!

I added ham stock instead of chicken stock. I also added fresh garlic and a couple of bay leaves. I used a packet of Goya Sazon to add an extra layer of flavor. I spooned this over rice with chopped onion, tomatoes, fresh cilantro, a squeeze of lime, and some cheese. It was great. Will make again.

I was excited to make this as my family loves black beans and spicy food. I was sadly disappointed. I completely agree with another reviewer who said it was spicy hot but very bland. I added a chopped onion at the beginning and a can of drained diced tomatoes at the end. I have a hard time believing that this would have mad the soup MORE bland. It was also wicked (yes, I'm from Boston) watery and pureeing 2 cups helped thicken it, but it went down the disposal.

This is really good! I made the following changes: soaked the black beans overnight, cooked on high for 4 hours and low for 6, then added some blended up cherry tomatoes, half a can of tomato paste, and (already cooked) turkey sausage (also blended two cups of the black bean mixture and added back into the slow cooker), cooked on low for 30 minutes more. In my recipe, I didn't skimp on spice and it's not too spicy. I also added garlic because...it's garlic and should be in everything.

I only used 4 cups of chicken broth. Added bay leaves, minced garlic, and onion. Towards the end I added more salt and seasonings, because it tasted a little bland.

Good basic recipe that is easy to make your own. I like to doctor it up with half yellow onion, poblano pepper and can of diced tomatoes.

Very tasty and filling! I had to add about a half cup extra chicken broth to get the consistency right. I also chose to blend half of the soup and then pour back into the rest as others had suggested. I added 2 extra teaspoons of jalapeño for extra kick. Served with a big dollop of sour cream!

Made as directed plus 1 can diced tomatoes w/green chilies as others directed, plus some salt.  Consistency was fine, flavor just didn't do a whole lot for me.

It was Ok - I soaked black beans overnight, placed in the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients and decreased the chili powder to 1/2 tablespoon.  I also pureed some of the beans during the last 30 minutes of cooking to make it thick.  Served over rice, with shredded cheese, and sour cream.

Once again, a good base for an amazing soup! Make it your own.
I added quite a few flavors. I placed a whole diced onion, 3 carrots,4 slices of bacon and I was very generous on the Cumin, Cayenne, and pepper. To really smooth it out, I brought in my hand blender after 4 hours to make it much more creamy. I also cheated and added some cream cheese, half a package. Dress it with some Cilantro and a great Zinfandel and WOW...a great soup.
Don't forget, season to you and your families tastes. We like it spicy at my house! Cheers

Easy and good. My favorite kind of meal. I didn't boil the beans, just soaked overnight and they were fine, but I understand how boiling would make the consistency better.
I didn't have quite enough stock, so I used 2 cups of water to get enough moisture which actually turned out good since it is quite a spicy soup and I was making this for a friend who doesn't embrace spice quite like I do, so the water helped mute the spice just a little.
A little sour cream and cheese on the final product and you have a yummy and filling dinner!

This just didn't do it for us. I cut back on the "hot stuff"--reduced the jalapenos and eliminated the hot sauce and the cayenne. But it was still way too hot. And other than hot, it didn't have much flavor. We ended up tossing this out after a couple of days since no one wanted a second meal of it.

excellent soup. as others have mentioned, i also added canned tomatoes and chilis, extra jalepeno, peppers, onions. it was very much like a chili, delicios. i also did blend 1/2 of the soup in the blender to make it thicker and i boiled the beans in chicken broth after the soak before adding them to the slow cooker. i ate the soup all week as part of the fat smash diet (since you can have meat) i lost 2 pounds in 5 days.

I'm no expert, but this was like spicy water with black beans when I went to turn it to low. I added another can of black beans, put about 1/3 of the "soup" in the blender, and added cornstarch to thicken it. After all that it was more like a soup.  Also, I LOVE spicy foods but this is a little too much.

VERY spicy!! I just used a large can of black beans instead of soaking the dried ones. I drained and rinsed my beans maybe I should have left them undrained so it would have thickened these up. Turned out really good, thank you.

The flavor was great, however I left out the jalepenos and it was still very spicy, so spicy in fact my husband couldn't eat it. Though i suppose it is called "Spicy slow cooker..." So if you like very spicy food this is great

I would give this recipe more stars if it weren't for the extreme heat level of it even after I cut back on the chili powder.  I like spicy food but this was too much, however it was great with added cooked rice and leftover shredded beef from a "shredded beef for tacos" recipe I found on AP. I did use canned black beans (some of those pureed like another reviewer suggested). I had a lot of Cilantro in it also which my husband thought I added too much of, but I loved the dish and so did all of our six children.  Thanks for the recipe.

As my husband well said "This soup kick butt. With numchucks!" I made a few changes to accommodate my supplies on hand.  I had to use up some tomatoes pronto so I put in 2 chopped romas.  Also, I had a 1/2 lb of ground pork that I threw in.  Didn't have cayenne so I added a few more dashes of hot sauce.  I deseeded two of the four peppers to reduce the heat a little (my poor sister STILL thought it was too spicy!!  I thought it was perfect).  I also used fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.  Served up with chopped cilantro, diced onion, and irish cheddar cheese. SOOOOO yummy. Enjoy!

I was not thrilled with the slow cooker results...I am a big fan of black bean soup, and this was my first try in the slow cooker.  I soaked the beans for almost 24 hours and cooked on high for five hours, then on low for three, the beans are NOT cooked.  I gave up and put it in the refrigerator - will have to pull it out later and cook again on the stove so that it is edible.  You definitely need to take extra care to ensure your beans get cooked ---- for me, it is not worth the extra time when I can make it on the stove.

I love spicy foods as much as the next person but this is too much heat.  Like other reviewers said it's all heat and no flavor.  I think it would be much better with no cayenne pepper and more jalepenos instead.  I'll try a different recipe next time.

This is good....with some changes.  One, you don't really have to use the slow cooker for this recipe, and I opted not to.  I did soak the beans overnight first.  I added a diced onion to this, and simmered that first, then added the beans, broth, and spices.  I also added a few dashes of garlic powder as well as a can of green chiles.  I smashed beans a bit with a potato masher after they were cooked.  The soup is good.  Nothing that I will crave, but it is good.

I used canned beans and threw in the bone from the holiday ham. My SO says it's the best thing I've ever made, and I am a pretty good cook(if I do say so myself)!

I was very skeptical of this soup when I was making it especially since I didn't have one of the ingredients(ground cumin)  I just left it out and hoped for the best.  Well, I was unawere my sister brought some to work and all her co-workers RAVED about the soup.  I finally tried it and was pleasantly surprised.  It was very good.  I will be making this one again.

This is a good recipe, I did have to make some alterations to it so I gave it a 4.  I recommend mashing the beans down (or putting them in the blender like others suggested).  I thought mashing was better, kept it a little more chunky.   I also added onions and corn for more texture and flavor.  My spices might have been older, but I had to actually add some more to make it more flavorful.   Next time I will add some chicken to it as well.   Its a tasty recipe that is easy to make.

Delicious! I did not have any jalapeno peppers but I did use an onion and 2  carrots, chopped. I used an immersion blender at the end and added fresh cilantro before serving.

I love this black bean soup.  I used 5 cups of chicken broth, omitted the cayenne and jalapeno and added a can of rotel and chiles.  Cooked it exactly as listed and blended with an immersion blender at the end.  Better than Bahama Breeze's black bean soup.

The spices are perfect, but it needs more textures.  I tasted it after cooking as directed and decided it needed something.  I added a can of crushed tomatoes and used the blender to puree half of the beans.  That helped a lot.  Then I topped the soup with diced onion and cheese.  Next time I'll add tortilla chips as well and maybe some diced bell peppers.

I love how simple and flavorful it is, and how easy it is to tailor to what's in my fridge. Here's what I did: I used red beans (dried--I had them in my cupboard), and left out the jalepenos (didn't have any). I boiled the beans in the broth for a minute and transfered to the slow cooker (high 4 hrs, low 6 hrs). Then I drained the liquid, and boiled 1lb of frozen cauliflower in it, and then pureed it. I added this to the beans and it came out hot, creamy and delicious!

We really enjoyed this tasty soup.  I addd 1c. frozen corn and a 19 oz. can of stewed tomatoes.  I pured half of the soup but I think next time I will pure the whole amount to add thickeness.

Sorry, but this soup was not what I had hoped for.  It lacked substance and was way too spicy.  I even halved the spicy ingredients, removed the hot sauce, and reduced the broth to 5 cups.  AND I LOVE SPICY FOOD!!! 
I've had Spicy Black Bean soup before, but this one just didn't cut it.

I made this for my parents.  It was a little too spicy for my mom's taste but my dad and I loved it.  I changed the recipe a little bit.  I added a can of diced tomatoes w/ chilies and some cilantro.  This is definitely something I would make again.

out of this world and so easy.  I skipped the hot sauce and dumped all into the pot.  At the end I pureed with a hand blender and served with tostitos.  Couldn't get enough of this!

This recipe was as easy as it states, and trust me, I'm no cook! Definitely add a little something to this if you like a bit more zing. I am giving the recipe 3 stars simply because half of my fussy eaters liked it, the others did not. But try it, you'll like it!

I tought that this soup was okay but my husband loved it.  The more of it he ate the  more of it he loved.  I thought it could still use a little more spice but I like spice alot.  I also would only eat this as a side dish or appetizer unless some veggies and maybe some ground beef or turkey was added.

My husband and I were surprisingly disappointed in this.  It was ok, but nothing special.  The soup wasn't thick at all, like black bean soup normally is.  It was just beans floating in liquid.  About an hour before dinner, I took out about 1/4 of the beans and then mashed the rest into the broth and readded the beans.  The consistancy of this soup was all wrong, and the taste wasn't good enough to make up for that.  On the plus side, it was really easy to make and I think it was just personal preference that we didn't love it.  Thanks anyway!

There was nothing special about this soup.  It was as though I'd heated up a can of black beans and added some spices.  The taste was good, but nothing special, unless you're a black bean fanatic.

My family enjoyed this spicy slow-cooked treat. Will definitely make this again. The house smelled wonderful, too!

Delicious!  Used NO Chicken broth to make it vegetarian. Play with the spices to taste.  Served with fresh cilantro and shredded sharp white cheddar. My husband threw in some leftover veggie sausage crumbles while cooking, which tasted great. Mexican corn bread from an iron skillet rounded the meal out.  Even my 4 year old ate it.

Like others, I decreased the amount of chicken broth to 4 cups. For personal preference, I also added in a can of diced tomatoes. This is a great recipe; especially when it is cold outside.

My first soup made in slow cooker.  It was easy to do and tasted great.  Filling enough as a main course.  I topped it with a dollop of sour cream, chedder, and chives.

I loved this recipe but my family did not so I resigned to give it 4 stars.  I think it was the appearance more than the flavor that turned them off.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  It was the best soup I'd ever made...my family thought so too.  The only variation I made to the recipe was to add cubed chicken.  Also instead of paying for chicken broth, I made my own with soup base and water.  Highly recommended recipe !!

Holy cow is that hot! And I didn't even add the jalapenos or chili powder! I took a short cut and used canned beans, also added carrots and celery. Really good, I'll just have to cut the spice WAY down. Even my husband was sweating, and he loves his hot sauce.

This is a hassle-free recipe.  The leftovers were great warm or cold with crackers and melted cheese.  I did add some other seasonings and veggies to give the soup more flavor.  I also didn't add as much of the spicy seasonings as the recipe called for.

I thought this was pretty good, but just needed something.  I added green chili peppers, onion, Rotel tomatoes, and finally rice.  The additions just seemed to give it more substance since hubby wasn't totally thrilled after his taste test.

Delicious soup!  Even good with a little shredded cheese on top; drained and beans put on nacho chips or in a soft taco!  A must try!  Thanks.
