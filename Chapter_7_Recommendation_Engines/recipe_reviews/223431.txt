Great summer party cocktail. I like using dixie cups for these because the cups can be torn at the seam for easy eating. If you can find it in your local store, try this with Pina Colada jello mix.

I love how simple and quick to prepare this recipe really is.  I did also add 1 packet of Knox Gelatin.  I also used pineapple jello rather than the strawberry/banana.  So delicious ~ pure tropical.  Thank you for sharing Janice. Maybe I should add that I made the shots in wilton silicone molds, once set they just peeled out ~ so easy and everyone loved the shapes instead of the plastic cups!

Delicious!  I used pineapple Jello-mix and it tasted just like a Pina-Colada  shot.
