So easy and wonderful! Light & fluffy. I would put it on the higher rack in your oven to keep the bottom from browning so drastically. I added leftover broccoli from last night's dinner and the hubby thought I slaved for hours.

I love this recipe. I did change it some by using bacon instead of ham and parm. cheese instead of the moz. Omitted the onions and sprinkled extra chedder and chives on top just before it was done. Served it with chopped tomatoes on top. The basic recipe is wonderful because there are so many ways you can fix it. Next time I'm thinking asparagus and fresh mushrooms. Yum! Thanks for sharing.

update: So much better than a regular omelet. Today I used 6 eggs, some browned sausage, 3/4 cup of milk and one chopped green onion. I reduced the cheese just a bit and used 3/8 tsp seasoned salt.  Turned out to be a little too much salt. I think a dash of hot sauce would have been great, but didn't think of it this morning. I used an 8 inch pie pan and baked for 35-40 minutes.  Original review: This is a tasty and easy recipe. I like that it is also a great recipe for making substitutions based on what I have in the frig. Today I made it with parmesean as other have suggested (NOT the powdery kind in a shaker) instead of mozzarella and used some sour cream in place of half of the milk. Also added a few chives, about 1 teaspoon summer savory, and some dried parsley to the seasonings.  Left out the ham and served it with sausage links. This is now a Sunday morning treat at our house.

LOVE IT!  But confused by the number of people who were put off by the photograph...you can add your own picture of your creation!  It clearly says photo 1 of 17...and many reviews state how they add thier own ingredients, making it a family favorite.  That's why we love it!  Whatever veggies or meats or cheeses are in the pantry go into the omlete!  It is a good solid recipe as is, but a great base to use up leftovers or items that are in need of use.  A frequent breakfast for dinner in our home!  And the reviewer who gave it 1 star without even trying the recipe based on the mushrooms in the photo that aren't listed in the recipe...shame on you.  Your comment is a true waste of allrecipes.com users time.

This is a great recipe!  I modified the original ingredients by adding a little more ham.  I also added mushrooms and onions which I sauteed in butter and seasoned with garlic salt (8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms and a medium white onion) in place of the minced onion.  

I made it for my wife and kids on Mother's Day and the whole family enjoyed it very much.

Excellent! Mine took 1 hour to bake. The glass dish made it perfect and it kept warm well. Once I let it sit for a few minutes, it formed a nice shape. I used bacon and greased the glass dish with a touch of the bacon grease for added flavor. Moist and delicious. Many variations including diet and non diet versions!

I made the omelet and added 1/2 cup of Mt. Olive diced jalapenos and sauted fresh mushrooms; just because I love them.  It was really good.   Lowest Reviews belong to two people who did not even try the recipe.  Why is lovethebeach and Donna reviewing somthing they have not even made.  One should not review based on ingredients or say mushrooms in the photo.  If you like them put them in, if not leve them out.  What is the big deal.  Shame on lovethebeach and donna for reviewing something they have not made.

I made this for friends and received rave reviews.  I served large portions and everyone cleaned their plate.  It turns out light like a soufflé.  I like it better than the heavy casseroles with bread in them.

I just happened to get this recipe in my email today so thought I would make it for Christmas brunch. I used chopped crispy bacon instead of ham and I added a small can each of sliced mushrooms and green chilies. It was excellent and will certainly fix it the next time we have overnight guests.

What a way to clean out the fridge!  Deceptively delicious considering how easy it is, in spite of my modifications:  1) Sauteed a little bit of chopped up onion, one minced garlic clove and a little bit of chopped green pepper in olive oil; 2) Added that to the egg & cheese mixture; 3) Used left-over ham deli meat; 4) Did NOT add seasoning salt since the ham is salty enough; 5) Added some canned peas and one can of diced tomatoes.  Yum!  One note...this did take 1 hour to cook in my oven.

As a lot of people have noted, am omelet is a great pallete to create a wonderful meal.  Start with the eggs, then let your imagination take over!  These are also nice when baked in cupcake pans as well.  Spray them with nonstick spray, then everybody has their own individual "egg cakes"!  They make a nice presentation when sided with some hashbrowns or homefries, or a couple of pieces of melon!

I happened to have all the ingredients already on hand so thought I would surprise my hubby with breakfast (that doesn't happen very often).  He was pleasantly surprised.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but it is easy to adapt to your own taste.  I like the suggestion of parmesan cheese.

Man, do these poof up!  I filled individual 10” ramekins about 2/3 full and second-guessed myself,  debating whether or not I should fill them up a little higher with the egg mixture.  Good thing I didn’t, as these rose very prettily to the top.  I’ve tried several of these baked omelet recipes and this one interested me because of its lack of a lot of add-ins.  It made it simpler to prepare for one thing, but I was also interested in learning if I would like the omelet as well without a lot of extra stuff in it - mushrooms, peppers, etc.  (But mostly just because I was a little lazy this morning)  These were great! Really fluffy, with nice flavors of just the ham, cheese and onion.

Been making this for years, but I called it refrigerator pie (aka quiche). I make it in a glass pie plate and spray that with cooking spray then sprinkle toasted bread crumbs before adding egg mix to pan. It can be made with any combination of veggies, spinach/onion/bacon is my favorite. Great with broccoli for dinner too.

This is the most versatile recipe and it is a bit more "special" than serving eggs. I serve this to company.  You can put anything you and your guests like in it just remember 8 eggs to 1 cup milk...the rest is up to you.  I read someone's review that they poured into muffin tins, which I will try when I have guests with different likes and dislikes, you can "individualize" them. Another great thing about this one is while the dish is baking for 45 minutes, it gives you plenty of time to get the table set, the smoothie blended, the toast toasted.  Serve it right in the baking dish!

Excellent!  Very tasty and healthy compared to other breakfast casseroles.  I added mushrooms, onions and diced green & red peppers and sautéd in 1 TBSP of buter, salt & pepper until soft.  Omitted the minced onion and mozzarella cheese and used all cheddar.  My egg bake was still liquid in the center after 45 min of cooking, will probably use a bigger pan next time.

Maybe I just don't like omelets done in the oven or something, although I've made other egg dishes in the oven that were fine.  It was rather on the puffy side, and it seemed like all I could taste was "puffy", and that it prevented other flavors from coming through.  i.e. I could hardly taste the ham or cheese, even though ham has a strong, salty flavor.  I didn't really *dislike* it -- just seemed a bit on the boring side and I can't see a reason to make it again.

Just made this dish for the family for a Sunday morning breakfast. It was a HUGE hit! Everyone LOVED it! I used sausage instead of ham - because I had it on hand - and every morsel was eaten! Delish!

This is my first time giving a rating to any recipe. This was simple and fuss free. I normally wake up before everyone else, so this was nice to put it and bake while one by one everyone came downstairs to the smell of breakfast. Thanks for this recipe, love that you can add whatever ingredients you like.

This was really good.  I did change it a little (not because I thought it needed it, but just to get rid of some other indredients).  I put frozen potato cubes in the microwave to thaw a little, then layered the potatoes, onions, and peppers into the bottom of my 8x8 dish.  Then I followed the directions exactly to the recipe.  I did have to cook it a little longer, but it was very tasty, and I will make it again.

Rating this as a great base recipe!  This served 4 for our family (which included 2 college-age males).  For the first half of baking time I placed it on the top shelf and then moved to bottom shelf for remaining half.  I sauted onions and green pepper, added bacon and used 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning and cheddar cheese.

Saw this this morning and made it for Christmas breakfast.  I used 6 eggs, bacon, 3/4 C milk, cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan.  We ate it all up!  Easy to put together quickly and it was ready in 40 minutes!

Very easy, very flexible.  I treat it like a crustless quiche and use whatever leftovers I have on hand to add to the basic egg mixture.

This was great!  Easy, heats up well, and you could add whatever meat/veggies you like.  I'd like to try this with mushrooms, green chiles, and some tabasco.  Yum!

This was yummy, even my 5 and 3 year old ate it!  I added more ham, less salt, some fresh minced chives and grape tomatoes sliced in half.  I also sauteed the ham in a nonstick pan to dry it out a little and brown it.

This had a lot of flavor.  It's also a great base recipe that you can add whatever you want to.

This worked great. I poured my egg mixture into smaller ramekins versus a big casserole dish and they turned out golden and puffy like a souffle :) nice flavours. My guest said that she liked it better than pan fried omelets.

So good!! Our friends enjoyed this delicious dish with us and went home with the recipe. The only modifications I made was crispy bacon instead of the ham and a sprinkling of coarse ground black pepper on top. I also baked mine in my skillet and it was perfect in 40 minutes.

I made this earlier this morning for Christmas breakfast.  Very good.  I added a few green onions that I sauteed with half a green pepper.  I also added 4 pieces of cooked crumbled bacon.  My 2 year old son is a very picky eater and he loved it. He even had some of the leftovers for dinner AND wanted seconds!  So, that alone makes this recipe a keeper!

I've been using this one for awhile now. Made it the first time when my husband was going easy on the carbs and still wanted to enjoy a breakfast casserole, sans all the bread those dishes usually contain. Like many other reviewers, I've used lots of variations.  Ham and cheese, Sausage and mushrooms, veggies, there's always a nice "Tah-Dah"! when you take it out of the oven. Served it most recently at Thanksgiving breakfast for my husband's and my parents. Great for just two as well, as any leftovers reheat well for a quick work-day breakfast. Thanks for this recipe!

This was really good and easy. My picky 9-year-old son hurt himself on it. He told me that it was great, but next time I shouldn't make so much so he wouldn't have to eat so much.

Every pan was either too small or too big simply because all are being used due to the holidays. So I decided to try the bundt pan. I sprayed the pan generously with cooking spray, poured the egg mixture and cooked according to directions. It came out beautifully and impressed my holiday guests! Great recipe.

This was great for Christmas brunch.  So quick & easy to make and you can vary to your own tastes.  I added in chopped mushrooms, red & green peppers and red onion instead of dried.  Fried back bacon instead of ham as it was what I had on hand.  I used a little garlic powder & dill as well as the seasoning salt & pepper.  thanks for a keeper

This is a great recipe.  I made a few changes, substituting the ham for bacon bits, and the mozzarella for parmesan.  When it was done, I garnished it with cheddar cheese, green onions and tomatoes.  My husband and I loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so easy, so fast and so delicious.  The first time I tried it I had company who didn't like onions or peppers, so I left those out.  I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk.  It was so good, I made it again just for my family with the onions & peppers and again using 1/2 & 1/2. Wow, was it good! Though more fattening, the omelet was really creamy and fluffy. It's just fine with milk, too. I had the 1/2 & 1/2 & needed to use it.  Like someone else mentioned, leftovers can be quickly warmed in the microwave for a fast, workday breakfast.  There are so many possibilities for change-ups that this makes a perfect recipe for a quick, special breakfast/brunch meal using what you have on hand. Just be sure not to leave it in too long or it will dry out.  I found out the hard way that the suggested baking time is exact!

Made this with some bacon and about half pound of ground beef leftover.  Turned out great.  I also put some fresh diced tomatoes on top.  So yummy!  husband and sister loved it as well.  I think it would be great to add onions, spinach and tomatoes to the mix before baking, will try that next time.  thanks for this delicious and very easy recipe!

This is an easy & delicious recipe!!  We loved it!!
It is very easy to do your own thing depending on what you have on hand.  I added sauteed onions, potatoes & sliced zucchini.  I actually made it in the morning for dinner that nigh tand it worked fine.  I'm going to try making it the night before next time.  Great for a brunch!!! Thank you M. Clayton!

EXCELLENT!  Actually my sister, Lynda, shared this recipe with me from the Allrecipes site, and my Mom who was visiting, and my husband loved it.  Then even leftover and reheated, my son stopped by and loves it to.  It is a definitely keeper and very tasty!

I just tried this today with a few modifications.

For the eggs, I used 10 eggs, 1 1/2 cups of milk, a dash of salt, two or three dashes of pepper,  about 1/4 cup diced ham, about 1/4 cup bacon bits and about 1 cup shredded Kraft colby/Monterrey jack cheese blend. I say about because I didn't take exact measurements.

I popped this in the oven for 20 minutes to firm up the top of the eggs. As soon as that was in the oven, I browned ground Jimmy Dean country pork sausage and did my best to break it up while cooking. By the time the 20 minutes were up, the sausage had cooled enough I was able to crumble it on top of the eggs. You have to be careful at this stage, while the top was slightly firm, the eggs were still mostly in a liquid state. A few of the bigger sausage pieces broke through the firmness and sank, so I recommend smaller pieces of sausage crumbles or letting it cook 25-30 minutes instead.

Back into the oven for another 20 minutes! When the timer was up on that, I sprinkled the top with almost a full small can of drained Rotel, some finely chopped white onion, and more cheese. I let this cook another ten minutes and it was done. 

This is much better than any omelette I've ever had. My son loved it! He's normally a picky eater, so I figured the tomatoes might put him off. But no, he ate a huge piece. My husband doesn't like the consistency of quiche and thus wasn't a fan, but said it was an excellent breakfast quiche, especially considering it was my first go at it

This is a awesome dish. I throw in a layer of hashbrowns to make a crust. I broil the hashbrowns slightly to make them crispy. Then throw in what ever I have on hand. I had to make two nine inch pie plates to take to a Sunday brunch. No leftovers. I have also precooked the veggies slightly and made sure the liquid was drained before adding it to the egg mixture. This helped in the baking process.

Easy and good. And presented nicely with some chopped tomatoes and green onion on top. Crisped up some turkey bacon and sauteed some onions and added in.

Awesome!  I'm sure it's perfect as-is but I had to make some adjustments based on what I had.  I used bacon instead of ham and feta instead of mozzarella.  My 5 year old even said it was the best thing she's ever had, which says a lot.  Definitely a keeper.

I just saw this recipe in my email from allrecipes.com and decided to make it for breakfast this morning since I hadn't made anything yet. It was delicious and so easy! I love that with omelets you can add anything you have and want and make it your own. I will definitely be making this again! I didn't have seasing salt so I just added pepper, salt and garlic powder and it had great flavor.

I love baked omelets. They are so easy and adaptive and everyone can eat at the same time. I used Egg Beaters in place of eggs, added mushrooms and left over baked potatoes sliced up in place of ham since I didn't have any. Served with salsa and toast and this is healthy and yummy. Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I love this.  I adjusted it for 2 and baked it in a small loaf pan.  Perfect.  I had some evaporated milk that was about to expire so used that in place of the milk.  This will be a regular breakfast for us.

Made twice. First time exactly as written. 2nd time used sausage instead of ham, and added more seasonings. A good starter recipe, then add your own flair.

Loved it!  I normally don't like eggs, but this was very tasty, filling and fluffy.  The boyfriend was surprised and said "you should make this more often!"  I just added a little mushrooms.  Great recipe!

Such an awesome recipe to have on hand when you're throwing together a breakfast for more than a few! I sauteed some mushrooms and pancetta instead of using ham. (and of course added a few dashes of hot sauce)Next time I'm gonna make this with all fresh veggies....*yum*

Did not work for me. Took over 1.5 hours to cook through and eggs were still watery. I have used egg substitute in many recipes from this site with great results, but did not work this time.

I give this five stars after using 3 ounces Hilshire Farm sausage and 3 ounces shaved ham, 1.75 cups of cheese and adding onion powder along with dried onion.  Husband raved!  This is one to show off to the mother-in-law!

This recipe is great because it's so versatile! You can add whatever cheese, veggies or seasonings you have on hand. I also like it that you're making all the servings in one go, and not having to prepare time-consuming individual omelets. The only thing that lets it down is that the bottom tends to get a little bit rubbery. Other than that, fantastic! Thanks!

Delicious and easy.  I changed this a bit by omitting ham and onion.  Used low fat chedd. and Monterey Jack; used half and half instead of milk; added about 2T sour cream and 1 T melted butter and 2 tsp. cornstarch.

Since my husband is on maintenance Atkins, I am always looking for new recipes.  Today was his birthday and I made this as a "breakfast birthday cake'!  It was awesome.  Didn't have any ham on hand, so I substituted sausage breakfast links.  I needed to cook mine closer to 50 -55 minutes however.  Will be making this for a holiday brunch I am hosting for friends this week.  Easy, looks and tastes great--perfect!

I made this for dinner a few times already.  My husband & guests loved it.  Each time I decided to alter the recipe a little - using Gruyere instead of Cheddar or shallots instead of onions.  I also sprinkled it with parsley for some color.  Yum!

I made it the first time for Christmas brunch. We loved it. 

I made it again for New Year's Day brunch but this time I substituted 1 cup of crab meat for the ham. It was delicious!! And it is gluten free!

So easy!  I hate making scrambled eggs on the stove, and am hopeless at omelets.  But this was great. I didn't have seasoning salt or dried onion, but I tossed in some diced raw onion (about 2 handfuls, probably 1/2 a cup or so) instead, and used all cheddar instead of half and half since I had no mozzarella.  I baked it for about 50 minutes and it came out perfectly.

Very flexible in terms of what you want to include - ham, onions, mushrooms - what ever you like and what ever you have will work.  We have a friend who worked at an Original House of Pancakes and he said they added sour cream to their omelets and of course they bake them too.  I did sub some of the milk w/ Sour cream.  Really great and super-easy!

Ok as written - kind of bland. The second time I made it I added red and green peppers and fresh chopped onion. Definately improved the taste. Good base receipe to add your own ingredients to.

I've been making a few of the baked egg dishes here on AR for Hubs to grab and microwave for breakfast.  This one seems to have been the best one yet.  The others had very little milk or none at all.  That made them a little tougher and not as fluffy as this one.  This recipe also lends itself well to changing it up to suit your tastes or to accommodate what you have on hand.  Lots of possibilities here!  This time I used some jalapeno pepper jack cheese along with some cheddar.  Mine yielded 4 good size servings.  A definite do again!

This is incredibly good.  The only changes I make are adding a sprinkle of cayenne or a dash of hot sauce, and a little dry mustard,  which I add to all egg dishes to enhance flavor, and a liberal sprinkling of fresh nutmeg on top after baking.  I make it for company using 8 eggs, and also make it just for the 2 of us using 3 eggs, with slightly less than 1/2 the amount of the other ing.  Still takes about 45 minutes to cook in a glass dish.  Much much better than the "rolls" of eggs that restaurants try to pass off as omelets!

Simple and flexible.  Came out great even though it had to sit for a half hour before we ate (family came home late).  I omitted the ham because my kids like their eggs and meat separate and they were disappointed when the dish was empty!  I served it with sour cream and salsa.

Made this for a group of 9 people for New Year's Day brunch. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 dish. It was gobbled up and I got great compliments. Easy way to use up leftover Christmas ham. I followed the recipe as written (doubled).

Full of flavor.  Next time I might lessen the salt a bit.  Will make again!

Simple, basic and easy to customize, which is what I love about these types of recipes!  I made this for my boys to use up some leftover ham.  I added some of my own seasonings and some diced yellow and orange peppers for colour.  Mushrooms would be a must if the boys were not eating it as we love them!  Overall, very good!

This is a fantastic basic dish that can be changed up to fit your mood or on hand ingredients. I followed the recipe with a few changes. I substituted half the eggs for eggbeaters. Added half a sauteed onion and fresh chives. The family really liked it. I loved the ease and only one pan clean up. Served with a side salad for a perfect light meal. Will make this again and again changing things up a little bit. Will try it next with Swiss and sauteed mushrooms.

Wow, this was delicious. My boyfriend makes a similar receipe and I thought his was good but this was fantastic. We used half cheddar and half pepper jack as the cheeses because that's what we had on hand. Also we threw in 1 minced scallion because we didn't have dried minced onion and it added just the perfect onion flavor. Other than that we didn't stray from the original recipe. Thanks for this, what a great Sunday breakfast.

Love omlets of any kind but never thought of baking them; this was great as is (okay, I've heard mushrooms - love them - are good for you, so I threw some in).  I like 'cleaning out my refrigerator' of veggies with an omelet, and this would be perfect for that - and to top it off, it's better than using a frying pan!!!!

I made for Christmas brunch this year and everyone loved it! I made one mushroom (1 package presliced) and one with ham. People especially liked the mushroom one. I think that people thought more work went into it than actually did. It was EASY and it was made before guests arrived so I wasn't busy prepping, it was in the oven already.

What an easy breakfast this was. I used lunch meat ham diced up, 3 slices. This would have been good with sausage too. It could have used a little more ham though. This was a little skimpy in that department. Very good, very easy, tasty. Thanks for a great meal.

So good and versatile!  I omitted the salt since ham and cheese are so salty themselves.  Added some mushrooms, a jalepeno and seasoning.  Anything you have on hand can be tossed in.  Yum!  I really like that it's baked; it's a nice time saver.

Nice breakfast casserole change up from the ones made with bread.  I used more ham than the recipe called for to satisfy the carnivores in my family.  My favorite about this recipe is it slices and serves neatly - no runny egginess in the center.

I added sauteed mushrooms and onions in a little bit of butter with some salt and pepper.  I also added green peppers and 3 crispy bacon slices to the original mixture.  It was a hit!  I cooked it in an 8x8 pan and it was perfect for 4 people.  We all enjoyed it thoroughly and added hot sauce for extra flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

This was excellent! My boyfriend gave me a high-five!  I sauteed the onions with a clove of garlic in butter before adding in. I also added 2 strips of chopped bacon and 2 sauteed sliced zucchini.   It was great! Next time, I will try it with bacon, mushroom and parmesan.

I have been making this recipe for a while now.  To give it a creamier texture I add in 3 oz of cream cheese when I blend the eggs and milk together.  It is heavenly and cheesy!

This was great. I added a bit more ham and some parmesan. I had no cheddaar but in the last few minutes just put some american slices on top of the dish until they were melted. My husband loves American slices:) You could put whatever you like in this. Is good as written, thanks.

This is a good dish for an egg lover. However for the average bear not so much. You couldnt taste anything but egg. But all in all it was still okay. My suggestion would be to add a layer of hashbrown, and maybe even alittle sausage or bacon.

Very good, very easy to make and my family loved it!  I made this for New Year's Eve afternoon brunch using Jimmy Dean sausage instead of ham and adding sauteed mushrooms (4 oz. can) and fresh onions.  I also cut the seasoned salt in half (to 1/4), taking the suggestions of others, since the sausage is pretty well seasoned (I used the frozen Jimmy Dean sausage so I microwaved 4 patties on 50% for 90 seconds just to unthaw it and cut into small squares before adding to the mixture).  Also, as others mentioned, I will also add more cheese; maybe 2/3 cup of both mozzarella and cheddar.

Excellent! I did make a few changes. Used only 6 eggs, subbed buttermilk instead of reg. milk, used 1lb. Jimmy Dean sausage, and added 1 can chopped tomatoes and green chili's. Also baked for 1 hour. Very, very good! Thanks!

WOW!  Delicious recipe for breakfast, lunch, brunch, or dinner. So easy to make, and a great way to use whatever might be left in your fridge or pantry.  I added green peppers, mushrooms, tomato, minced garlic, and fresh herbs along with the ham and cheese.  I bet the leftovers tomorrow will be even better.  Great dish for company too.

DELICIOUS!! This is quiche without the crust!!  I've made this a few times.  This time I added leftover steamed broccoli, cooked bacon, lots of shredded cheddar cheese!!!  And I added onion powder in place of onion, added some Old Bay spice, fresh ground pepper and salt!!  This is a keeper!!

I made this because my boyfriend likes omelets.  Boy did it turn out good.  I am not fond of omelets but I liked this one.  I substituted the ham with hot breakfast sausage and also added some sliced portabella mushrooms since there were some left over from another recipe.  Boyfriend said I make a 'mean omelet.'  Very light and fluffy.

Made this for dinner last night with bacon bits, browned onions and red peppers.  Really good dish.  Be sure not to bake on a low rack in the oven, it will brown too much.  Served with Polish sausage and hash browns.  Nice to have the eggs baking while I made other things.  Will serve this again!

A+++ recipe.  In fact, I'd say this is one of the best recipes I've gotten from this website.  Instead of ham, I used thick sliced turkey.  I also used sharp cheddar which gave it great flavor.  Be sure to add the minced onion as it did give it that extra flavor (I halved the amount of minced onion but still gave it that zip).  Thank you for making Christmas morning breakfast special for our family!

Wow, this turned out great. I am having an Xmas Brunch at home this year and am looking for recipes which can be prepared beforehand. This will be one of my dishes. I didn't use Mozarella because I didn't have any and didn't miss it.

Thanks for sharing your recipe, it was so easy and so good. My family likes a little kick so I used pepper jack cheese instead of mozzarella and onion salt instead on minced onion and salt. Worked great!

This is so easy and tastes excellent. I have made it probably 10 times already. I made it a couple times with cooked maple sausage and that is so incredible! Definatly a family favorite! Thanks for sharing. :-)

Very yummy! This is what I did. I cooked three strips of bacon and set aside to crumble. I then cooked half of a diced onion and a 1/4 piece of diced yellow bell pepper in the bacon grease. After beating the eight eggs with the cup of milk, I added a small shake of salt and some freshly ground pepper. Next, I added in the cheese and the onion/pepper mixture.Mixed in the crumbled bacon and baked in the glass pan for 40 minutes adding a bit more cheddar on top for the last couple of minutes to melt. This was a very good breakfast. Served with some southern grits.

This  is very good, puffs up nicely, and a great  way to make an  omelette.  I halve the recipe if it's just the two of us. Have used  crumbled bacon instead of ham, and added mushrooms. A few shakes of hot sauce perks it up a bit. I like it topped with a little salsa and sour cream or yogurt. It's a regular with variations at our house.

My husband and I love this recipe.  It is so amazingly simple to make.  I usually make this for dinner once a month or so.  We change out the ingredients to have something a little different.  One of our favorites is to add asparagus and Swiss cheese.  Another is ham, mushrooms and Swiss cheese.  You can easily adjust the number that can be fed by adjusting the number of eggs used (adjusting all other ingredients accordingly, of course).

I recently made this recipe again for  a special occasion  Every time I make it I am reminded of back when airline travel was a pleasant experience.  One airline served it for breakfast on a cross country flight I frequented.  
I separate the egg whites and whip them up just a bit. Not enough to make a souffle.  Add to mixed yolks any cheeses, meats, veggies, herbs that strike your fancy. Gently stir in whites. Butter baking dish well and bake on middle rack. So creamy/fluffy on inside and just barely browned on outside.  Baked and served in individual dishes with mixed fruit and oven browned cubed potatoes makes a special breakfast.

Excellent basic recipe which can be easily changed to your own preference. In my case I used sausage vs ham,  cut up sliced Italian blend cheese vs the cheddar, diced small 1 T sweet onion vs the dehydrated onion, added 1 cup of cut up fresh baby spinach, used 2% milk vs reg milk,  added some fresh ground pepper.  It came out excellent per myself and my husband. On the second day I added 1 T water to baking dish, covered tightly with aluminum foil and reheated second half of the omelette in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes, then removed from oven and let rest for 5 minutes.  This was a great first day and also second day leftover breakfast.  Thanks for the great recipe!

So easy.....and it turned out perfect!   I would add a little more cheese on top toward the last few minutes.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!   Forgot to take a picture before we ate it all!

Loved it!
I used white and regular cheddar, pepper jack and mozzarella cheese... cut up mushrooms and mixed it with some Hot salsa instead of salt or pepper and cutting onions.
It came out nice and fluffy with a little kick in each bite. And I saved my eyes from cutting up onions!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I followed it almost exactly except to substitute bacon for the ham. Several people commented on how much they liked it.   I will make this again and maybe add some feta cheese and/or broccoli. All in all a good fall back recipe for a crowd.

We thought this was very good!  I didn't use ham, instead used crumbled bacon and mushrooms, and omitted the dried minced onion (not fans of onion).  Used a shredded blend of Mexican cheeses and also shredded parmesan.  Baked in an 8 x 8 non-stick square pan, on the second to the top rack of oven.  The bottom of it ended up being really browned.  Didn't like that!   (Maybe if it was cooked in a glass pan it wouldn't get so brown?)  Couldn't really taste the bacon or mushrooms so next time I won't cut them up so small.  The texture was a bit spongy (used 2% milk...maybe whole milk or cream would make a difference?).  When I took it out of the oven, noticed the bacon and mushrooms had "migrated" to the center of the pan, leaving 1" around all sides of the pan without any of those ingredients.  It was pretty flat, didn't look like the picture posted.  Thought it tasted a bit bland so I finely chopped the green part of a scallion and sprinkled on top...I'm not an onion person (that's why I left the minced onion out of the recipe) but the very (very very very!) tiny pieces of scallion added some good flavor.  Also, after taking out of the oven and tasting it, added a little shredded cheese on top and put it back in the oven for a minute to melt.  I will definitely continue to make this experimenting with different ingredients, and would really like some thoughts on what to do so it's not quite so spongy!

I made it without meat, added some tomato & spinach. I have a convection oven, and it baked too fast on the outside and was a little underdone inside. Maybe drop the temp a little for convection?

Awesome. Made "SOPP" from this site for dinner last night and knew this would be perfect for using up the leftovers. Used only Mexican blend cheese cuz that's all I had. Added a couple more eggs and a bit more milk to stretch it out to a 9x13 for more room to cook due to comments about rubbery bottom. Simple and delish.

Excellent! A great way to make an omelette for the whole family. I added sauteed mushrooms, chopped onion, ham and pepper jack cheese and it was delicious! This is a great go-to recipe when I don't really feel like cooking and it's always great.

It was delicious and so easy! Only change was the type of cheese...I used Colby jack and Swiss because that's what I had on hand. I did have to increase the baking time to 55 minutes. Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe! My husband has had me make it for a couple of things going on at work, & he said nobody could stay out of it. They went on and on about how good it was. I did change the seasoning salt to garlic salt because we didn't have the other. I also used cooked breakfast sausage since I had no ham. He liked it so much that he has had me make this dish for our family at home. I really like the fact that you can add anything to this dish. Can't wait to experiment with it more.

I tried this super easy and absolutely delicious recipe over the weekend.  I followed the basic recipe, except I added some frozen hash browns from the freezer, chopped red pepper and green onions instead of minced.  What I am going to love about making this again is that you can put just about anything in it and change it up.  Open the fridge, see what you've got on hand and you're on your way to a delicious egg dish.

I make this a lot, of course change it up a bit. For instance, I boil red potatoes for a little bit then slice them up and layer them in the bottom of baking dish then pour in eggs and put in sliced cooked polish sausage and chopped up green, yellow, and red peppers. The last thing i do is put a layer of sausage gravy on the top and bake for 40 min then put a layer of cheese and bake for another 5-10 min. Oh I use a 13X9 baking dish also with a dozen eggs instead.

This was so tasty! I used the blender to mix the eggs and milk so it came out nice and frothy. I also added green and red capsicum (peppers) and used reduced salt seasoning. Delicious and easy to experiment with different vegies!

Sounds like typical ingredients but FYI this is not an omelet it is a Frittata. Basically you don't need to follow a recipe for an omelet. Use whatever veg/meat you like or need to use up. Saute the veg/meat first, add egg that has been mixed with milk, cook until formed enough, flip, fold, plate..omelet.

Oh, it was good. I didn't have any ham so I used bacon and I didn't feel like chopping up a whole onion for just  1 tablespoon. But it seems to me and everybody that it needs something more to it. Maybe when I make this again sometime, I'll try a few different things.

Thought this was just okay.  We made with bacon instead of ham and also added mushrooms, but still definitely lacked something, even sprinkling some more salt helped.  It does have about the same consistency as a crustless quiche.  Not sure if I'll make again...maybe if I'm out of ideas.

A bit plain, but easy and delicious nonetheless.  One batch of this omelet fed me for four nights :P, and the leftovers reheated well in the microwave.  I never actually used ham for this (I only had turkey sausage on the two occasions that I cooked this) but it still came out well.

Was not too impressed with this recipe.  Basically its just a quiche without the crust.  I sauteed red pepper, onions and mushrooms. Added lots of pepper but still found it far too bland.  I will not be making again.

Pretty good.  I love the ease of this recipe, and the versatility.  I didn't have mozzarella cheese, so I subbed with Kraft singles.  Not at all the same thing, I know, but bf loves them so I knew that would make him happy.  Would be better with mozzarella, I'm sure.  I used egg sub so I added more seasoning than called for--it's so bland, it needs help, as real eggs don't.  I added garlic, pepper, and some hot sauce, although I couldn't really taste the hot sauce.  I'd add more next time than just a dash if I wanted a kick.  Mine took an hour in the oven, which I expected based on the reviews.  It really puffs up nicely and is a no fuss breakfast, especially as I mixed everything up last night, then poured in the pan this morning and baked.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have to say that we loved this recipe. I doubled the recipe and did not have motz cheese, but I had some pepperjack cheese so I added that instead. Otherwise I made it just as ordered. The kids loved it...which is always a bonus! I sauted some mushrooms, onions and collard greens with garlic for a side. Thanks for a great meal. I will be making this over and over again.

Everyone loved this. I used the recipe base, but made some modifications. Sauteed the onions, and also added green and red pepper. Also used some different cheeses that I had on hand (hot pepper, american, and cheddar).  Added 1/2 cup of flour mixed with 1 tsp. of baking powder so that it puffed up.

This recipe is so great- it really gives the opportunity to add a bunch of different ingrediants. I actually modified this a little bit. I used 6 eggs, just about 1/4 cup of milk and  1/4 cup water (it stays just as fluffy), shredded fresh parmesan, mushrooms, red onion and threw in some three cheese blend shredded cheese. I've also made a meat lover's baked omelet as well with some left over bacon, sausage and ham. Excellent recipe!

This was just okay for us. It is a good way to use up extra ham, but it really needs more to make it not so boring. I omitted the seasoned salt (ham is salty enough on its own) and added garlic powder and pepper. I would add some green peppers or mushrooms next time.  Thanks :)

This is an absolutely easy and wonderful recipe! I made it for dinner for my family trying to use up the leftover spiral ham from New Years.  MMMM!  I did it exactly as the recipe is stated. My husband sauteed some mushrooms to put on top. I served it with some rolls and asparagus. Very tasty! Next time I will be adding some veggies to the base to see what happens. 
The minced dried onions made it through my picky eaters, and they have asked me to make it again tonight! :D

This was quick and easy. My 10 year old GD didn't want to try it and then wanted thirds! Would definitely use again. Made with leftover deli ham this first time but will try sausage and baked ham next. Made right by recipe.

Very good and really easy.  I added about 1 cup of blanched asparagus cut into 1 inch pieces.  Yum.

I made for it for breakfast and my family loved it. I added it to my recipe box because it's a versatile recipe. I used left over turkey and it was wonderful. I plan on alternating the meat everytime I use this recipe.

This was very good.  I did make some changes:  green onions from the garden, 2 cloves of garlic, bacon instead of ham and salt/pepper.  Next time I'll probably use bell peppers too.

It is amazing how delicious this recipe is for this simple of prep and ingredients! I used 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella cheese and it was delicious. It did take about 10 minutes longer to cook all the way through. I served it to my family and it was gone and even someone who does not like eggs devoured this dish.

This is a great baked omelet recipe. I love that it is so versatile. I like LOTS of toppings/fillings so this is what I used: chopped ham, canned mushrooms, canned tomatoes with green chile's, onions, garlic, mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese, parmesan cheese, cottage cheese, black beans, cumin, seasoned salt and pepper. IT WAS GREAT! My husband ate it three days in a row! Thanks!!

Made this Christmas Eve and cooked it Christmas day.  I used the items I had on hand which was quite simple:  eggs, milk, ham, seasoned salt and 1 cup cheddar cheese.  Easy and tasted great!

Very good and easy. I didn't have any ham so I added bacon bits (from real bacon) and black olives. You can really do what ever you want for the meat/cheese/vegetables which is great! I didn't have seasoning salt so I substituted with regular salt (half the amt though) and a dash of pepper. We had this for dinner and I served it with Asparagus Parmesan (also from this site). It made a really nice meal.

This is really good! I love that it doesn't have "wet bread" in it like most egg bakes do. Changes: I added a couple tbsp of mayonnaise and used 1 cup of shredded American cheese. Also, plain salt and a little pepper, no season salt. If you're cooking for a group, better double this recipe and use a 9x13 pan.

YUMMY!  I literally walked straight from the table where I just ate this to my computer to write a review.  I followed the recipe exactly, just made 1 1/2 times the amount.  I ended up having to cook it for about 70 minutes because of the extra ingredients.  I just kept watching it until it was all solid, no liquid.

I just made this omelet for breakfast, and I had to review it before I got too busy with my other holiday preparations.This is the best omelet I ever made. I made it with breakfast sausage today, but when I make it for Christmas I'll use mushrooms, and sausage. I also added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. My husband loved it, and it will become a holiday tradition in our house!

Nothing bad to say about this recipe! I used Eggbeaters & chopped turkey bacon. I put it together the night before & popped it in the oven before I took my morning shower so it would be ready when my husband woke up. So easy, so versatile. A keeper!

Excellent! Few changes- Used bacon bits instead of ham, about 2 tablespoons, used about 1 tablespoon of fresh minced onion and didn't use mozarella, just doubled the cheddar.  Turned out great!!!

I got this recipe with my monthly coupons from Acme Markets and decided to give it a try.  Very simple to make and easy to add ingredients to it too!  I used some leftover ham from Easter and fresh onions and mushrooms and it still fit in the pan!  This may become the alternative to skillet omelets for us!

My family really likes this recipe.  It's much easier than standing over the stove making individual omelets for everyone (and less time consuming).  Great base to start with and add any fillings you like.

I have to admit, I didn't actually try this myself as I am not an egg fan, but I baked it for my husband to eat in the mornings before work. He likes it, and this recipe also gets big points for how easy it is.

Awesome!!!!! I am so happy with this recipe! This turned out beautifully and was delicious. This is a great Low Carb alternative to the breakfast casserole that usually has bread! I added the entire 8 oz package of diced ham and a dash of dry mustard, pepper and garlic, otherwise I made to recipe. This was a bit salty but that is due to the extra ham, my fault. From here on out I will be experimenting with diced onions, peppers, tomatoes, extra/varied cheeses. I can see us heating this up during the work/school week for a nutritious, quick breakfast. Thanks so much for sharing!

Very easy to put together!  Next time, I'll add more stuff (mushrooms, pepper plus more onions, ham, cheese).  I served this with Home-Fried Potatoes -- we'll melt cheese over everything for leftover breakfast tomorrow.

This just hit the spot last nite!  Neither of us were very hungry (heavy lunches) but wanted something and thought of eggs.  Saw this and it was perfect.  I didn't have ham so I quickly sauteed about a handful each of mushrooms, green peppers and onions.  (Whatever you have in the frig!).  I threw that in with the eggs and cheeses. It was really good and will use this recipe when we have company for breakfastor brunch.  While it's in the oven you have all that time to maybe cut up some fruit, butter those English Muffins or smear some cream cheese on bagels!  Thanks submitter.

Since I cannot make an omelet to save my life, I have to rely on my husband to make them occasionally.  This is good competition for the real thing.  I used bacon instead of ham, because that is all I had on hand, and I added a chopped jalapeño with the seeds to give it some kick.  After it baked, I added chopped tomatoes, sour cream, and a little salsa on top.  We loved it!  Great recipe, M.!

It was a little bland to me, even with all the spices.  If I make again, I’ll had a sharp cheddar to the mix.

It was pretty good, I'm always looking for different breakfast ideas.  I added many items, chopped ham, green pepper, sliced grape tomatoes, garlic and onion powders, and black pepper.  Mine was baked in a 7 inch round ramekin and took longer to bake than directed.  It was certainly an easy dish to make and fuss free.  I would make it again.

This cooked up light and fluffy.  You can use any meat, cheese or veg combo you want.  I added some diced sweet onions with ham and used shredded taco cheese. This took a solid hour to cook in my oven.

Wonderful. I doubled it and put in a 9x13. I put 8 oz. crumbled cooked sausage instead of ham.  I used about a cup of chopped onion instead of dry, didn't measure that's a guess. I think I'll make it next for a church breakfast. Quick and easy!

4.17.19  It was breakfast for dinner last night, and Baked Omelet was the star of the meal.  I thought a sprinkle of paprika might give the omelet a little more eye appeal, but instead, all it did was make the top way too brown…my bad!  It really baked up similar to a souffle, climbing up the sides of the dish, so be sure your dish has enough room to allow this to happen.  I followed the recipe except for adding a little chopped red bell pepper which was in the fridge, and instead of 8 eggs, used one container of Egg Beaters® plus one egg to get the cholesterol down.  It was  light, fluffy, and cooked up beautifully.  No fussing or watching the omelet cooking in a skillet on a stove top, this just goes into the oven, and then you can focus on the other things you’re planning to serve with it.  Quick and easy and most important delicious!

This was better than any omelette I've had.  It was moist, fluffy, an just delightful. I only omitted the onions because we hate them, but otherwise, it was great.

The recipe was amazing! i didn’t have cheddar cheese or shredded cheese so i improvised with mozzarella string cheese and diced it really small and it worked great! i also added a dash of parsley flakes to the recipe and baked it for 44 minutes and it was perfectly baked! I’ll definitely make this recipe again! 10/10 loved it!

Sorry we did not care for this at all. My husband said they taste like microwaved eggs. Daughter said they were spongy. Loved the concept but won’t make it again.

It tastes really nice, i made some slight variations of my own:
*i used 5 eggs (enough for meal for 2 plus two small kids)
*less salt
*proportion the milk, too much will flood it
*added instead of mozzerella just regular cheddar cheese and i added 2 spoonfuls of philedelphia cream cheese
*i pre fried the veg to add like celantro or spring onions, green pepper bell small, and a tiny piece of onion finely chopped, oregano. then add to the mix. plus bacon finely diced pre fried to add to mix.
*oven time setting needed be slight higher maybe 400 to 450c (gas mark 4.5 to 5) there was still fluid at the bottom i uses a fork to check and opened up airpockets so it cooked fully...it took 1 hour nearly!!

it went down well with a slice of bread toasted for brunch!

Delicious easy and defiantly a keeper. Good for my keto diet as well. Just a tiny bit of liquid at the bottom after cooked, not bad though. Eggs were fluffy and just enough cheese and ham. I did what another reviewer suggested and made sure not to cook the omelet too close to the bottom over rack to avoid over cooking the bottom of the dish. Thanks for the recipe

I didn’t have ham, so I increased the cheese slightly, and used a combo of English cheddar and firm goat cheese that I had leftover from a cheese plate. Also used 1/2 t onion powder because I didn’t have dried minced onion. It puffed beautifully and was simple to make; would def make again.

This is a great basic recipe. I made it as directed, except I sautéed the ham and added fresh green onions to it at the end, just to soften them, instead of the dried minced onion. I may reduce the milk to 3/4 cup next time. Wonderful recipe to add your choice of veggies!

I've used this recipe several times.  Each time I add an extra ingredient (a veggie) and every time it's flavorful. I love how moist it turns out

Made this for Breakfast for Dinner night the night after I got home from a long road trip, because it was so easy.  Used bacon in place of ham, as I didn’t have any defrosted, but other than that made exactly as written.  Loved the combo of the cheeses, but you could certainly change those up, the recipe is so versatile.  Next time I might throw in some ground mustard, just for grins.  Served with pumpkin cornbread muffins and scalloped apples, made a very satisfying dinner.

Amazing!  I took someone’s advice and used muffin tins to pour them into rather than a casserole dish. Only took 30 mins to cook in my convection oven and we each ate about 3-5 pies. I learned for next time however, that I’ll put the egg & milk mixture into each muffin spot first, and then sprinkle cheese and ham into each spot one at a time. What happened when I did this the first time, is that I mixed all ingredients together and used a large spoon to scoop them into the muffin spots. The result was that a some had mostly egg and others were loaded with cheese. The sizes of them were all different as they were weighed down. Trust me, they taste much better being weighed down!’ So this new way will ensure that it’s even.

This recipe is top notch for its simplicity and versatility! I made two different combinations for Christmas morning, and both baked up perfectly.  I used 5 eggs each, in 8x8 Pyrex and this took only about 25-30 mins.  Could easily have fit the 8 egg volume in this size dish as well.
I prepped my "mix ins" the evening before. In the morning, it was quick and simple to prepare and get everything in the oven.
This was a really nice simple accompaniment to a small buffet which was otherwise heavy on sweets, breads, and fruits.

We thought this was delicious.  I used almond milk, homemade sausage and cheddar and gouda, which is what I had in my refrigerator. I will be making this for the holidays, and experimenting with adding different vegies.

I have a delicious eggs frittata recipe I make when wanting to do an egg casserole but it's more time consuming and has a ton of ingredients. I loved this because it's super easy and I followed the directions to a T and it turned out great! Awesome "breakfast for dinner" recipe or anytime you need an easy and delicious egg recipe!

This is an awesome and easy quick breakfast! You can throw in just about anything you want. Leftovers are perfect for making breakfast burritos, just cut it lengthwise and throw it in a tortilla! Easy to re-heat as well

This was delicious! My family loved it! I was expecting it to be good, but it was much more - spectacular!  I made no changes except I only had cheddar, so that's what it got. I can't wait to make it again for a special occasion brunch dish.

Great recipe.  I used 6 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, both cheeses, some chives, and some parsley.  The final result was tasty, looked great, and was very easy to prepare.  I didn't think any additional salt was necessary for an excellent taste.

Made this for my parents anniversary and served Breakfast in Bed style (with a side of homemade biscuits, home fries, and a small dish of peach slices) They LOVED it, and they're generally not breakfast people.  I did use parmesan instead of mozzarella and tomatoes instead of ham.  It was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Very tasty, very easy and will definitely make it again.  Didn't have any dried onion flakes, so used garlic powder instead & tossed in a handful of frozen peas for good measure.  Loved it.

Compared to the fried variety, this is far superior.  Light and fluffy which you don't see on a fried omelette.  I did alter the ingredients a bit, as I used what I had.  Fresh onions instead of dried, and back bacon instead of ham.  I also used lactaid free milk, but no issues  in any other areas.  I served this up as a late supper, with a bottle of Riesling.  I will be making it again for sure.  I like being able to get it ready, put it in the oven, and only checking it periodically.  Great method.

I make an individual serving of this recipe in a big mug.  I use frozen diced or hash browned potatoes as a base with two chopped veggie breakfast sausage links (Morningstar) on top.  I mix two eggs with a splash of milk, a couple of green onions and whatever cheese I'm using and pour that over the sausage and potatoes and bake for 45 minutes,  Delish!

Great recipe. I made it as indicated, and I've also subbed bacon for the ham and swapped out the cheeses, just based on what I have on hand.  I cut it into 4 squares and put each one in a ziplock bag in the fridge. To reheat in the morning, I unzip the bag, but leave the omelet inside. Heat for 1—1.5 minutes at about 70% power.  We like it served with salsa.

Yes, l made, but was going use sour cream as another reviewer suggested. By mistake I used cream cheese instead....Wow. It was wonderful. The recipe was sent home with our guests with the change to cream cheese. It's better to be lucky than good.

Was very light and fluffy.  I added some fresh spinach because I like that combo.  Will add a few dashes of hot sauce next time.

My husband and I loved it..  I did add cooked sausage instead of cooked ham and it was amazing.  I imagine cooked bacon could be great too!

Between three and four actually, but I'm giving it the benefit since we changed it up-though we added lots of tastey ingredients.. My mom made this for me when I wasn't feeling well. It was pretty good. She made it vegetarian by replacing the ham with chopped mushrooms. She also added red and green bell peppers and chopped marinated artichoke hearts (my request-along with the mushrooms, because I'm not a lover of ham in my souffles). She used the cheddar cheese, but substituted a Parmesan mixture for the mozzarella. It was alright, but we all felt it could use more salt, perhaps because the ham was left out, even though Parmesan cheese is salty. With all my favorite ingredients it was still bland and salt would definitely help. I also really didn't care for the fluffy texture of the eggs. I think I would have preferred more cheese, so with the leftovers I might warm it up with melted cheese on top, extra salt, some fresh chives, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes to boost the flavor- it needs it. The good thing about a recipe like this is that it is super easy to customize. For us it made more than 5 servings when served with a salad, but perhaps that was because of the load of ingredients we added.

My review will not be very helpful!  I do think the basic recipe is a perfect starting place.  I added mushrooms, spinach that I had sautéed prior to adding.  Other than that I added Ortega chills and a little Greek yogurt.  We loved it, the taste and consistency.

Really simple and delicious.  I sauteed onions, garlic, zucchini, and mushrooms and replaced the ham with bacon.   Also used sharp cheddar and pepper jack instead of the mozz.  The only thing is I used olive oil for the veggies and it was a little oily so I will use less next time.  Really fluffy and gone quick with some hungry mouths.  Will make again.

This is a wonderful solution for those of us who aren't very good at making omelettes.  I believe you could put anything you want in it and it would be delicious.  I added sauteed swiss chard and mushrooms with regular onion.  Will be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

4.5 stars...I made exactly as the recipe stated--except I used a 9x13 pan so I used 12 eggs and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  My hubby raved about it, my tween & preschool sons said it was so good, and I thought it was good, although maybe not great.  I think that was only b/c the onion flavor was very strong and I'm not a huge onion fan.  I think next time I will increase all the other ingredients except the onion.  This would also be good w/ mushrooms or peppers added.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great easy brunch recipe that looks great on the table and slices nicely.  I did add 3 extra eggs and pretty much doubled everything else, as I didn't think it would be quite large enough for 6 adults and there was maybe one serving left over. A keeper for sure!

Absolutely delicious! I made enough for two. I found that using an 8x8 baking dish works nicely for two people. In place of the onions, I used 1/8 of a large green bell pepper, chopped. I also added one large mushroom, chopped.  Baked for 25 minutes for perfection! After I took it out of the oven I sprinkled mild cheddar cheese on the top to adjust to my dad's taste :) Wonderful recipe, thank you!

This recipe was superb. It was a huge hit with my entire family. My dad immediately wanted to know when I was gonna make it again. The omelet came out fluffy and moist...so yummy I only used 3/4c. milk..used canadian bacon in place of ham, added approx 2 tbsp. green chilis, mushrooms sauteed in butter, and freshly chopped onion that I very lightly sauteed beforehand.. This is such an easy recipe to modify. It has almost endless possibilities.

I made this for Easter breakfast.  Very good and very easy.  I added 1 small can of mushrooms (drained) and used 1/4 cup chopped green onion instead of dried onion.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good.  We didn't have the meat, so we improvised and it was excellent!  Great meal for dinner time.

This was really good. My daughter loved it of course i had to put some ketchup on top for her. The only thing different I did was add mushrooms because we love them.

Much preferred this to the overnight egg cassarole with the bread. It can be varied easily according to the likes, dislikes of whatever crowd you are cooking for (or whatever leftovers you want to add).

We make this, or at least a variation of this, all the time.  I use egg beaters and no milk.  We have made it with Spinach and feta, broccoli and cheddar; added ham or sausage or even bacon.  The most recent version this Christmas morning was to stream fresh asparagus and add in sauted mushrooms and onions.  Super simple and everyone thinks that you slaved to make it.

Excellent, I added bell pepper and mushrooms and it was oozing with flavor.  I did have to cook it a little longer because I went with a deeper cooking dish but it made the edges a little golden which was good.

A great, basic recipe you can cater to your own tastes.  I use whatever cheeses I have available and clean out my fridge when I make this:  green pepper, onion, ham, bacon, mushrooms, what ever I have.

Easy to make and comes out perfect every time. I added fresh mushrooms grilled in about 1 tbsp butter and then blotted. Very tasty.

This is soooo good!  I've already made it four times in the past two weeks!  We've eaten it for breakfast, brunch, and dinner.  I do add canned mushrooms (like in the photo)and it's awesome!  Also, add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  It's the secret ingredient that makes it fantastic.

Easy and very tasty. I halved the recipe and added mushrooms, used cream instead of milk, added a couple of slices of cooked bacon and some pepper. Next time I would add another egg since I added so many other ingredients. I am also going to top it with more cheese.

Easy and tasty dish that should be made any time during the year.  I originally made this for my husband who was on a low-carb diet but we both enjoyed it.  No alterations needed.  This recipe is great "as is!"

Made this last year for the first time for our traditional Christmas brunch...it was a hit.  This year when we extended the invitation to my brother-in-law for this year's Christmas brunch, he asked if we were going to have "the same delicious omelet dish" we had last year....a year later and he still remembered it!!! that says a LOT!!  It is now a part of our Christmas tradition.
This year I'm doing the recipe times 4!! 
Personally, I have to say it was a snap to make and it allowed me time to be with our guests and not holed up in the kitchen watching over the stove.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This recipe has received a rave review in my household. I have made it twice now and it has been finished leaving my family asking for more...even my 1 year old loves it! I changed mine by adding on green and red pepper and some onions and garlic. I sautee them in olive oil and then add them to the egg mixture....mmmmmmhhhh! This is definitely a keeper!
