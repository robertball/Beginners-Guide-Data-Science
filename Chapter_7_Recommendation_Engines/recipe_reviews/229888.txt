Just made this for my family and my kids went crazy for it. Very good and not overly sweet. I only used 1 tbsp of brown sugar and added a dash off cinnamon.

Substituted margarine and maple syrup for the butter and brown sugar, and added low-sodium honey ham, for a one-dish lunch or light dinner.

I added more zucchini ( personal preference) and added some spicy seasoning. I really didn't care for this as a dinner side dish, but had the leftovers topped with scrambled eggs at breakfast and that was terrific

I had alot of zucchini in my garden this year and wanted to try something different.  I did use only two tablespoons butter and one tablespoon of brown sugar.  I liked this alot.  I served it with dinner as a side dish.

I had zucchini and sweet potatoes in my CSA box. This was a great way  to use them up! I added a little onion. Did not add the sugar.  I was surprised that zucchini and sweet potatoes tasted so good together! Thank You!

I really didn't like the seasonings or the zucchinni and sweet potato combination.
