This is essentially the same recipe I found after reading the NYT Food article on Mississippi Roast, & although the ingredients seem odd it makes the hands-down BEST crock pot roast around. Don't forget to grease or spray your crock pot first (trust me, this stuff STICKS). I always use 1/2 jar of sliced pepperoncini peppers versus whole - these are key, don't leave them out even if you think you don't like them like I did. My version has the mixes sprinkled on top of meat, doused with peppers & topped with a stick (yes!) of butter. No gravy from this, it's more of a slab of meat dish lol. Try it, you won't be sorry!

This is so easy and the result is wonderful.  I have made this a few times with slight variations based on reviews.  First tip: use sliced pepperoncini instead of whole pepperoncini if you can find it - saves the step of de-stemming, and the sliced peppers are perfect with the final product whereas the whole ones are a bit large.  Second tip:  I recommend using at least 1/4 cup of butter.  I made this once with 1/2 cup (which is what the original recipe this one is derived from calls for), and once with about 1/8 cup.  The former made the leftovers seems a bit greasy, and the latter made the roast turn out kind of dry.  1/4  to 1/2 cup is perfect, and here is the trick at the end to reduce the greasiness:  Remove the meat from the slow cooker.  Pour the juices into a large measuring cup.  Allow the fat to separate to the top for a couple minutes.  Skim the fat from the top and discard (except place 2-4 tablespoons into sauce pan for making a gravy).  Add 2 Tbsp flour to the reserved 2-4 Tbsp fat and whisk together over medium heat to make a roux.  Add the juices (from which you just skimmed the fat - I've found there is usually about two cups of juices left) to the roux and cook for a couple minutes to reduce - viola, the perfect gravy.

One of the best roasts ever.  I have been making this for a little over 3 years now and it is one of my family's favorite dishes.  It Is FABULOUS as is, however As always, I had to tweak it  a bit to make it my own.  I serve mine over rice and I find that there is not a whole lot of gravy made.  to rectify that I pour some of the pepperoncini juice into slow cooker and also add 1 cup of beef broth.  Makes it perfect for rice.

I saw Robin Chapman, who invented this recipe, on Food Network's The Kitchen. She told the story of her roast. She said she had been making it for years, and someone asked if they could put the recipe in her church cookbook, and she gave permission. Then a blogger picked it up, and people began pinning it on Pinterest. One day, she got a call from the NY Times and she found out her recipe had been pinned 1 million times! She added that she puts a whole bottle of porcinis with the juice because her son likes it that way. Also, she just "dumped" all ingredients on top of the roast and cooked it "low and slow."

I'm normally not a fan of cooking with ingredients like the packets of ranch dressing and au jus packets, but after reading the NYT article, I thought I'd try the original recipe. It came out great and was delicious. Even my picky eater 9-year-old raved. 

The second night, I purchased long French rolls from our local French bakery, and served the shreded beef on the rolls with carmelized onions, saut√©ed porcini mushrooms, horseradish and the au jus for dipping along side some homemade sweet potato fries with sea salt and rosemary. It was FABULOUS. 

To make shredding a beeeze, I toss the roast into the bowl of my Kitchen Aide stand mixer with the paddle attachment and put it on the lowest setting until it's shredded. This also works great for shredding pork roasts or carnitas and also boneless cooked chicken for making chicken salad or chicken enchiladas. 

I'm not worried about the butter, fat or sodium. Everything in moderation.

Was tasty, but had way too much butter - and we are "lotsa butter" lovers/eaters.  Don't add salt until the end, there's plenty in  the packages. 5 pepperoncini is not nearly enough - try 20 ,  Cooked on "low" in my CrockPot, internal meat temp was falling apart with internal temp of 205 in 4 hours.

This recipe is really popular right now. I mix the ranch mix and au jour mix with 2 cups of water and pour in. I add 10 peperoncinis and about 3 tablespoons of thr peperoncini juice and then put a half of stick of butter on top. I cook on low overnight. The next day i serve over rice or serve on fresh french bread with cheese. Always a hit.

Found a similar version on Pinterest and used it instead of this one. I was not a fan of pot roast, especially in a crock pot. This is delicious. A few changes from the recipe from Pinterest that makes a wonderful flavor-used hidden valley dip mix and brown gravy mix to sprinkle over the top of the roast then layered peperoncinis on top. No butter at all, no liquid at all. So easy and set the timer on the crock pot. Flavorful and fall off the fork tender.

This was fantastic, I made it for a potluck and it went over really well. I was pressed for time, so I made it the night before in a pressure cooker. Because of that, I browned the meat (coated with flour, salt and pepper) before I cooked it. I also added 3/4 cup of beef bouillon since you need liquid for pressure cooking. We served it with slider buns. Because I made it the night before, I was able to remove the grease from the gravy before reheating.

One of my family's favorite dishes. It's SO easy to make with very few ingredients but so full of flavor and delicious! I have also tried this recipe with pork roasts as well as venison roasts and they have all turned out perfectly!

It was fantastic! I made this recipe using sliced banana pepper rings (my only substitution).  I used the roast on buttered, grilled torpedo rolls and topped with saut√©ed onions and steak sauce. It went over very well with the kids and adults.  The next day I used the roast to make nachos. Yum!  I can't wait to try this with mashed potatoes and rice.  I can even see switching out the au jus for brown gravy or other gravy mixes.

Hands down the best roast we've had! It was so quick and easy to throw together before work. Came home, threw in some petite potatoes, carrots and onion and let cook another 2 hours. My children loved and and have been begging me to make it again!  This one is a keeper!!!!

Excellent roast!! Some tips: it can be made the day before. Put all the juices  in refrigerator. After grease/butter is solid, collect 2 tbs and melt in a pan @ medium heat; mix with 2 tbs flour to make a roux. Slowly add warm juices while whisking. Allow gravy to get to medium consistency and mix it back into the meat. This recipe is also delicious with VENISON/DEER meat .

Having used homemade versions of both ranch dressing and au jus, this was a very interesting roast. I added a couple more peperoncini and wish I'd added more. Thankfully the kids don't eat them, so I got theirs, but it definitely didn't hurt. Next time I'll add even more. All the aromas meld together and make the beef tasty, the peperoncini somehow become even better and the sauce is a just a wonderful compliment. I used less butter though. Thank you for the recipe.

Gluten Free version  Absolutely a delicious, moist pot roast...family loved it.
I cook for 5 celiacs so to make this gluten free I used McCormick's GF beef gravy mix and it worked perfectly.

I was skeptical, the combination of ingredients sounded a little strange, but we tried it, and wow! Outstanding. Definitely get a little of the gravy mix on the outside of the roast for extra flavor. We had lots of juices left at the bottom of the crockpot for some au jus, too.

Best beef roast ever!  This combination of seasonings is fantastic I added some vegetables to make it even better.  1st,  I stuck the five whole Peppers into the roast with the butter in 5 different holes. 2nd, I put the two seasoning packets on top of the roast and cooked it for an hour and a half. 3rd, I added vegetables 2 pounds of baby carrots 1 large potato chopped, four chopped Bell Peppers of different colors and one large onion. 4th topped all that with two more of the spice packets then I continued cooking on low until 8 hours total.

This was soo good! My family loved it. Instead of using 2 pepperoncinis I used a big jar of sliced pepperoncinis as we all like them. Will definitely keep this recipe handy!

Do you have venison roasts in your freezer?? This is AMAZING for venison (elk, moose, etc.) Wild game has less fat and the butter adds the necessary fat needed  and the combination of ingredients takes away any gamey taste. It is just awesome and our "go-to" roast recipe!

Oh my Lord, this recipe is exceptional!!  The only change I made was to use 1/2 a jar of sliced pepperocini and added just a bit of the juice from the jar.  After 8 hours it was perfect!  Paired with egg noodles and green beans.  I'll be making this over & over again!

I've made this roast several times. When I don't have a packet of au jus mix, I use Lipton onion soup mix. I've reduced the butter, I've increased the peppercinis,  and no matter how I tweak it (depending on what I have on hand) it still turned out great. I have also added carrots and potatoes... and I've made gravy from the extra juice, if I serve with mashed potatoes... you just can't ruin this recipe.... excep those that are sensitive to salt apparently think it's too salty - but we love it!

Great flavor!!!!    .   I just sprinkled the au jus and the dry dressing over the roast instead, then topped with the butter and  peppers.       Use at least 10 peppers!!!!!!

The recipe I followed used one stick of butter and a few more of the peppers, it did make some juice but next time I will add some beef stock to create more juices. I used a 3 lb. roast only because I couldn't find a 5 lb. , this roast didn't last long, excellent.

This is much better than your standard pot roast. Love the flavor, and the bit of heat. Fair warning, if you have leftovers they will get spicier waiting in the fridge for you to serve them again!

All I can say is heavenly. I added extra pepperoncinis and reduce the butter just a tad, and it turned out perfect!

Have now made this twice.  Excellent results.  Everyone loved the flavors.  Only change was to add 1 1/2 cups beef stock.  For more au jus.  Shredded roast for steak and cheese sandwiches.   Provolone cheese.  Served 5 for dinner tonight to rave reviews. Lots of left overs to enjoy soon.   Everyone had a bowl of unstrained au jus for French dip.  Highest recommendation I can make.

This was super easy and delicious. The whole family raved. Beef was falling apart tender. I accidently used too much butter, but it didn't matter. I used whole pepperocinis, and the juice. The whole pepperocinis were perfect, IMHO. They burst nicely when sliced with a piece of the meat. Next time I would add the whole jar. I will definitely make this again.

One of my new favorites! Added a few more pepperoncini, since I love them. Shredded it and served on soft sub rolls. Great reheated too. A definite keeper.

Dang!  Not a roast fan at all, but thought I'd give it a try and it was really good!  Added a whole jar of pepperoncini peppers with just a bit of the liquid, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Was done in 7.5 hours, but possibly could have cooked longer. Served with Roasted Broccoli and Egg Noodles.  

Next time will reduce the butter to save some calories.  Thanks!

The key is to roast on low for atleast 9 hours, turning it up to high dries it out. I am a mild to medium kinda girl, so 5 peppers is plenty for me.  This can be served right on the plate or in a sub roll, just pour the juices over top! Perfect for a cold winter night!

It had a very good flavor, but the reason I didn't rate it higher was  that it was VERY salty. You really need to be careful to look at the sodium content on the back of the packets  before you buy them (which I forgot to do) I made it as written and didn't add any additional salt, but the gravy was so salty it was almost inedible. I looked at the back of the packets I used and the total sodium content ended up being almost  2 ts , which is way too much. Next time Ill make sure that I use a lower sodium gravy and ranch seasoning packets !  Other than that, I really liked it.

I was looking for a good roast beef recipe. A couple other recipes I'd tried were not flavorful or came out dry. This one on the other hand, is hands down, the BEST roast I've ever made. Don't let the odd ingredients fool you or scare you away as they almost did me.  This roast takes 5 minutes to put together & you come home to the most flavorful fall apart roast. I will say the au jus is a bit salty but I promise with this roast, you won't need to moisten it up with the au jus.

Against my better judgment, I made this exactly according to the recipe.  I wish I had followed my instincts.  The 2 mixes added way too much sodium which became so concentrated during the cooking process, the end result was inedible.  There needs to be liquid added, whether it's water or no-salt chicken stock...do it!   I ended up rinsing the meat, added water and nuked so that it wasn't a total loss.  The poor pepperoncini died in the cooking process.  I would add them closer to the end of the cooking time so they would serve as a nice crunchy garnish.  They added nothing to the overall flavor when added at the beginning.  As for the butter, if using a chuck roast, cut the amount in half.  A leaner cut would probably benefit from the full recipe amount.

Okay, I HATE pot roast. My mom used to make me eat it and I barely could. I decided to make this because my husband loves pot roast and I felt badly for him that he doesn't get it often. I couldn't believe that I actually liked this! It's a miracle. The husband and kids loved it. I made it again for my dad and he also loved it. I used what the original recipe I found called for - 1/2 cup of butter and a few more peppers but, basically the same. It's become a family favorite.

I have made this more times than I can remember and it is delicious every time! I stopped using chuck roast way too fatty! I actually switched to an Eye Round Roast more beef to enjoy! I also serve over pepper mashed potatoes with a side of frozen sweet peas, my friends and I usually make a mountain of everything together and it's awesome!!! I practically use half the jar of pepperonchi peppers too!! Great recipe will be making it for the next 70 years guaranteed!!!

This was so yummy! My Mamaw told me about this recipe and I knew if she liked it, then I definitely would. It was a WIN with my husband and my mom. It was extremely moist, my mom even asked how much water I put in (none). Definitely will make this dish again!

So easy and delish! I used regular brown gravy mix because that‚Äôs what I had at hand. I rested the roast on sweet onions. The gravy made the rices cauliflower seem like potatoes. This is a new family standard.

Oh. My. Gosh!!!  This is about the best thing I have EVER mad, and the easiest!  Being that I‚Äôm trying to do Keto, I didn‚Äôt add potatoes or carrots which I normally always do to a roast ( I know the recipe doesn‚Äôt call for them) but I wanted ‚Äúsomething‚Äù.  Well, what I did was add wedged cabbage the last hour along with some halved mushrooms and at serving time spooned the juice on top.... to die for!!! I also subbed onion soup mix for the ranch as that was what I had, and only used maybe a third of a package of it as well as the au jus.... it was perfect!

This is sooo good! I used a whole stick of butter on a 4 lb  top round roast. I shredded it after 7 hours and served it on flour tortillas sprinkled with shredded cheddar cheese! Everyone loved it. Probably making this at least once a month! It would make wonderful party food!

I serve this roast at least ever 2 months, it is so good and I now buy at least a 3 pound roast so we have leftovers. Freeze leftovers and reheat and it's as good as the day you made it and that's REally good. It's has almost totally replaced the old tried and true pot roast.

This recipe turned out great! I also added a Lipton dry onion mix, which added some nice texture bits to the au jus. Also added a splash of the vinegar from my jar of peppers, because I was worried there wouldn‚Äôt be enough water, but everything came out great! I served this with mashed potatoes, rice pilaf, and a side of asparagus, with King‚Äôs Hawaiian rolls. The meat is really a great base, the leftovers can be made into tacos, burritos, to a pasta, definitely a new family staple.

Incredible flavor!!!  I did as someone else did and added some beef broth, mushrooms and onion.  We love mushrooms and it‚Äôs that time of year on the Oregon Coast.  I served it over some brown rice with quinoa.  One of my new favorite Crock Pot meals!

OMG... I will never make pot roast any other way! So good. I added a few splashes of the peperoncini juice to it as well. It makes it really tangy and savory! Over mashed potatoes to cut that salty tangy-ness, MMmmm!

I've made this so many times. I use the recipe as written, but if you are not cooking it til pull apart and shredding it and mixing with juices you are doing it wrong.Shred it and put over mashed potatoes or rice or just put it on a good hard roll with or without cheese. The best recipe ever.

I use one stick of butter, 1 packet of au jus, 1 packet of ranch powder and a handful of the peppers and about a 1/4c of the juice from peppers. I shred the roast about an hour prior to eating and let it soak in the liquid. I‚Äôve made the liquid into gravy too if you prefer! Delicious!!

This is a delicious recipe! It's so easy anyone can do it. Great for beginning slow cooker users or cooks in general.  I always add some juice from the peppers even though you dont have to. I like to serve it with mashed potatoes.

I've made this twice.  Once time with all the butter, and another time with only 1 tsp of butter on top of seasoning.  They were both delicious.  I don't think you need all the butter.

Super easy and great on it's own.  But so versatile, put it over egg noodles, rice or on a brioche roll with carmelized onions and blue cheese.  Yum!

I made this recipe with a few changes and it came out excellent. I did not cut a pocket into the meat as the recipe said to do.  I just mixed the seasoning packets with 1 cup of water and poured it over the meat, placed the butter and sliced pepperoncinis on top of the meat. Easy enough to do. Maybe next time I'll brown the meat and see how that comes out.

This is a must make recipe. I have picky teenagers that love this. I made it as written with the only exception being I used sliced  pepperocinnis cuz they cook down nicely. I used the leftover meat on toasted ciabatta rolls with provolone for amazing sandwiches!!

Beef Roast with a kick. It's so good and so easy to make. This recipe is on top of my most favorite recipes. Instead of 1/4 cup of butter I used 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup)

This is good, but my recipe is a little different and I do like it over this one (sorry)...  I use chuck roast,  topped with:  1 pkg of Good Seasons Dry Italian Dressing, 2 sliced onions, 1 jar Pepperoncinis with juice, 1 can french onion soup and 1 can of light beer (like Bud Light) & NO ADDED SALT.  Bake it on 350 F. for 3 hours (or more if not yet tender).  Serve on toasted (broiled) italian bread or rolls with provolone (and horseradish-if desired).  So yummy!!!

We liked this. Used the pre-sliced pepperocinis.  However, the next day made sliders with pepperjack cheese & cole slaw on Kaiser rolls. THAT was amazing! I will be making this again for sliders at the next BBQ.

This is a staple of ours.  I don't always have Pepperoncini's and sometimes I vary the packets of mix I sprinkle in between Ranch Dip seasoning, Au Ju Mix,  and Lipton Beefy Onion Soup Mix.  Quick and easy, anyway you fix it!

This is outstanding!!  My hubby asked me to save this recipe as it was the best he has ever had.   I did add potatoes and carrots and one package of dry onion soup mix to the crockpot as well as half the liquid from the Jar of pepperoncinis and one can of beef broth so I had enough liquid for the veggies to get done.  This is my new go to beef roast recipe

I thought this was very tasty and super easy! I did add a cup of chicken stock I had to use it up. It came out very good. Next time I will add some veggies to it like potatoes and carrots and possibly try using onion soup mix instead of ranch just to see where it takes me. Will definitely make again.

Unbelievably simple  and good.  
We always let the roast rest out of the juice so the butter/fat isn't as much of a  concern as some have expressed.  Also, the leftover juices are a great condiment on baked or mashed potatoes.

i have made this roast  before using a similar recipe. I added more peppers about 10 -12  ,as well as 1/2 teaspoon of dill weed. I served this with mashed potatoes and we ate the leftovers on hoagie buns the next evening. Thanks for a great recipe! Will defiantly make this again as it was a homerun!!

I have made this recipe three times and it is great...no changes needed. It is delicious as is or with fresh vegetables added the last three hours.  I strongly suggest that you use only unsalted butter because the gravy and dressing mixes have plenty of salt. My husband loves this and is happy to eat leftovers for as long as they last. It‚Äôs a true winner. Great meal to share with family or friends.

I like spices, and garlic is a staple in my kitchen.  Roast is always good but I will add more garlic and maybe juice from the pepperoncini jar.  Consumme is a bit stronger so it makes better sauce for my mashed potatoes.  ( I have a friend who used beer and bouilion cubes. and a jar of peppers.)  In the end it's a great recipe, you just need to adjust it to your taste.

I used an elk roast from my husband's hunting trip last year. The only things I added, in addition to the recipe, were pepper and minced garlic. Melt in your mouth good!! Everyone loved it.

I got this recipe from a dear friend years ago. and it is -- HANDS DOWN-- the BEST roast slow cooker recipe!! I do not add the pepperoncini.. was not given to me that way.. but reading this I will try it next time!  I also do not use the butter, but add 1/2 beef stock to get some delish gravy. but it makes its own from the beef juices. I was very hesitant to not add water/liquid, but it isn't needed. I also add 1 roughly chopped onion, and 2 stalks of celery..t hats all.  BTW.. this  works  best with cheap meat cuts,, even pork roast, venison, and buffalo. thanx for the recipe!! its a keeper

Easy and awesome........in my opinion, it doesn't need butter.    There is enough fat in the roast to keep it moist and tender.   Howerver - this is a must.  Add a whole jar of pepperoncini peppers.   Juice and all.  

You will not be let down.  Truly awesome.

The first time I made the recipe exactly as written, i would rate it about 3 stars because it was too greasy and the flavor wasn‚Äôt great. The second time I rubbed the roast with black pepper and seared the meat on both sides before placing on the slow cooker base. Then I added 1/2 jar of pepperoncinis, plus about 2 tablespoons of juice, and sprinkled the ranch dressing and au jus packets over the meat before placing the slices of butter on top. After cooking for 8 hours, I removed the roast to a platter and sliced it cross-grain before placing the meat back in the roasting pan and refrigerating overnight. The next day I easily removed the solidified fat from the top of the meat and warmed the meat in the juice before serving over mashed potatoes. It‚Äôs a little extra work but so much better. The flavor pops. We recently had a guest from Alberta, Canada, who says he doesn‚Äôt like pot roast, but he had 3 huge helpings.  I‚Äôll never make pot roast any other way.

This was so good. I skipped making a pocket and placed everything on top. I used sliced banana peppers because I have a ton from the garden. Will make again. EDIT: The second time I made this I added more peppers and included some bell peppers. I still think more pepper flavor wouldn't hurt so the next time I make it I'll add even more.

I cook this for harvest/planting meals, one guy says it's the best roast beef ever.  I add a bit of Italian seasoning also and a little wine.  Use the sliced pepperoncini, juice and all, and put in one extra gravy mix [which I use instead of au jus]

Family loved it! I didn't have the two package seasonings on hand so I made my own version of both. Placed meat in crockpot, seasoned and turned to coat. Also, added about 1/4 cup of pepperoncini juice around the meat. Sliced the butter and put on top surface of meat. Next time I will try searing meat before putting in crockpot, as I usually do with any pot roast. Over all good recipe especially if you want dinner ready to go when you get home. I served this with mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.

The BEST roast recipe I've ever had! Much better if cooked on low for 8 hours than trying to rush it and cook on medium or high for 4 hours. The roast will not be nearly as tender and juicy if you don't cook on low.  Also, it's better with a beef roast than a pork roast.

This is one of my favorite slow cooker dishes to make. The ranch dressing and pepperoncinis give it a pleasing tang. Absolutely wonderful scooped over mashed potatoes.

I added 1/2 jar pepperoncini with juice and omitted butter, as chuck roast already has to much fat. Next time  I will omit the brown gravy mix since it and the ranch dressing have so much salt.  It was good but I have other roast recipes I like better. This was super easy to prepare, though, and for that reason it deserves a try.

Hi!  We have made this many times and love it.  BUT, I was out of beef the last time & used pork loin!  WONDERFUL!!  I think this is a recipe for any crockpot roast!  The peppers do disintegrate if using sliced or pieces.  I also add some Jalape√±o peppers, too......but only a few.  Some family members do not like too much ‚Äúheat‚Äù. We have served this over fat noodles, mashed potatoes & as sliders.  The juice/gravy is a bit salty but good!

Made this yesterday like the recipe except I omitted peppers and used chopped onion instead because I am allergic to peppers. It was delicious and made the house smell delicious. We had a roof leak and all the workers wanted to know what was cooking""

Made it tonight for the first time and it's phenomenal. 

My changes:
-Roast was only ~2.5 lb since that's all the store had.
-I used an entire stick of butter (1/2 cup) instead of 1/4 cup. I'll try 1/4 next time to see if the flavor is markedly different.
-I used unsalted butter and added just a little salt at the end of the cooking time.
-Used about 1/4 cup of juice from the pepperoncini bottle in addition to the peppers.
-Right before serving, I ladled out all the juices and reduced them in a saucepan on the stove over medium-low heat. Then poured it back on my portion. I think it helped kick the flavor up a notch.

Absolutely a do-again.

Wow! This recipe was surprisingly delicious! I didn‚Äôt expect this combination of ingredients ton be as freaking yummy as it was! I did make a few small tweaks and have some recommendations.

1) I made this in my crockpot as directed. The only liquid I added was the liquid concentrate instead of the powdered au jus, and that was only a couple of tablespoons. I added a splash of pepperoncini liquid as well.  

2) Since there was much more liquid than recipe suggestered there would be. I ended up having to add more of everything to make the flavor of the meat strong enough. 

3) Too much butter! We added exactly how much was suggested, but there was so much  butter that we could barely use the drippings bc there was so much fat in it all. 

4) not nearly enough pepperoncinis. I increased the amount by 2-3x after tasting the meat when it was around done. There weren‚Äôt nearly enough with only slicing/dicing up 5-6 peppers.

Delicious!  I used a bison chuck roast, about 10 pepperoncinis (and added some juice too), potatoes, carrots, and about a cup of water.  Since my chuck roast was 1lb 8oz, I used half the amount of seasoning and it was still pretty salty.  So next time I plan to use about 2 teaspoons (instead of 3 teaspoons) of each seasoning to make it a little less salty.  I've never liked cooked carrots, but these were SO good.  Served with slider dinner rolls.

Okay so, I've made this about 6 times in the last two months, my family loves this so much, the only catch is, we make it into sandwiches. Which are AMAZING!! I read quite a few reviews before making it. I laid the roast on the bottom of the crockpot, pushed the center down and piled all the ingredients in the middle of it. Changes: I diced up about 9 pepperocinis (juice and all) and diced up a stick of butter. Everything goes on top and in the center. When the roast is done, I pour the juice out and set it aside and let that fat separate out and use the remaining for a dip for the sandwiches.  I take the meat (less any fat) and put mozzarella on top. We use a really crisp bread loaf like a Tuscan roll, Italian loaf,  or we've even used asiago, toast really thick slices. We use mayonnaise on one piece of toast (Duke's - I'm southern) and something called Slawsa on the other. It's a vinegar based topping. It's so good, I promise you will like it!

Quick and easy, I did a double batch and it was a hit at our house.  I absolutely love the taste and how easy it is to make. Hearty meal can be served over rice, potatoes or noddles.

This was super good but honestly a little greasy for my taste-too much butter I think, which was obvious w the leftovers as it set up in the fridge.  Simple to make and great flavor, just a little much for me.  Keeping the recipe but will reduce butter next time.

Fam loves this recipe. The only thing I do differently is dump a whole jar of sliced pepperocini in the pot. This recipe is amazing, we make gravy from the liquid and usually mashed potatoes. It would be great on sandwiches or tortillas. We never have leftovers. Wanting to try something similar with chicken.

Work carry in and everyone was amazed! Even got asked how I made it. I used a half a jar of sliced pepperoncini's instead of whole ones (added more flavor), and a whole stick of butter with a little over 4 pound roast. I also added a pinch of garlic powder. The most raved about carry in I have ever had. I also slow cooked it for 10 hours instead of 8, so I could wake up in the morning, and just button up the lid and take it to work. The roast was tender and delicious.

Made this up yesterday on the recommendation of my sister-in-law for a quick and full of flavor dinner in the crock pot. I used a 2-1/2 lb. chuck roast, 2 T. of butter, the pack of ranch dressing mix and 1/2 of a package of au jus and the 5 pepperoncinis. It smelled so good while cooking and was done in about 6-1/2 hours. Served it with mashed potatoes and tomato and cucumber salad. This is a little on the salty side so am glad I went with the 1/2 package of au jus mix. This will go into the rotation.

This is by far one of the most wonderful. Roasts ever! Use a whole stick of butter and 5 pounds of roasts.definitely more peppers for sammiches the next day. We made gravy with cornstarch and good au jus for French dips
*** note: the third time I made it I used 2 onions and a 32 oz jar of,peperocinis... May have to start switching to roaster

Flavor was great.  Next time (if there is a next time) will use a higher quality of meat.  My chuck roast was tough.

This is the BEST and easiest pot roast I've ever tried. I made a slight change in the directions. I put the seasoning on the roast first then I add sliced peperocini with the juice, then top it off with the stick of butter. It was so easy and so delicious. It's my family's new favorite.

I was looking for something to try different than my traditional pot roast and this had such high ratings I thought I would give it a try.  I am so glad I did!  We loved this roast!  The aroma that filled my kitchen while it was cooking was mouth watering!  The roast was perfectly seasoned, tender, and had amazing flavor.  You would never know that ranch dressing was used.  You just know it is good!  The pepperoncinis are addictive!  Make sure you try those!  I made exactly as the recipe stated with the exception of using about 10 peppers.  Fabulous!

Delicious. I made it for a potluck so served it with rolls. Nothing else. Lots of compliments! The pepperoncinis were so good I will probably throw more of those in next time I make it.

This was so easy and delicious! I just put everything on top of the roast instead of making a pocket (like it states in the directions). I threw it all together before work, probably about 5 minutes.

I make a lot of beef slow cooker recipes and this one is by far my BF's favorite(he's not a meat lover).    Tweaked it a bit by cutting a slit in top of roast and putting a tsp of minced garlic in it.  Also poked holes in meat and pour the juice over it about 5 hrs into cook time.  I use about 10 pepperoncinis instead of 5.  This beauty makes a wonderful gravy for homemade mashed potatoes. YUM!!!!   A definite keeper!

Wow and Wow.
I made this the day before I planned to serve it. I also wanted to try to convert it for InstantPot so I made the following changes based on reading reviews and looking at the timing of "Pot Roast" in my InstantPot recipes.
1) I floured the meat and browned in InstantPot using saute setting and a little olive oil.  
2) When slightly browned on both sides, I added 1/3 stick of butter, the ranch dressing mix and au jus mix and 8 oz of sliced pepperoncini with liquid (I think I could have used the whole jar as a reviewer suggested).
3) I added 3/4  cup water required for the pressure cooker and cooked under pressure for 40 minutes letting pressure  release naturally.
Because I planned to serve the next day, I refrigerated the roast/peppers in a casserole.  I let the fat separate and poured off the fat twice before returning the spectacularly delicious au jus to cover the roast.
Served over rice  with plenty of au jus in plates with a lip to contain the jus (I think mashed potatoes would be even better).
I didn't take a picture because it is all taste and looks...not so much. Don't know why they call it Mississippi Roast I'd call it Mediterranean Roast due to the Greek peppers.  But  whatever you call it, it is the most delicious chuck roast I've EVER eaten. Thank you for introducing me to this recipe.

Made this but used a packet of onion soup mix instead of au jus- won't make a roast any other way from now on! The pepperoncini had just the right amount of kick.

So skeptical of this recipe.  So glad I tried it!  Absolutely delicious!  I added the whole jar of peppers and just a small amount of water.  Served on toasted bolillo rolls, Dijon mustard and cheese.  No more boring roast and potatoes here.  A keeper, for sure.

can someone please tell me what is the interest in eating something like a chuck roast, pot roast, whatever, cooked long and slow that feels like chewing on a wet dishrag when it's finished. what am i doing wrong? doesn't anyone else have this reaction? i find chuck roasts cooked long are gross and disgusting.  that dishrag texture is horrid.  i would like to know if anyone else has this reaction. i have tried many times to make the chuck roast "sliceable" and lose that stringy horrid texture. please advise.

I made this twice.  Once I used the au jus packet the other time I substituted an onion soup mix packet. Both worked well.  Also added One can of cream of celery and A full stick of butter.  I slow cook this until I could shred the meat (12 hours).  My family is very picky and everybody love this recipe. I served it over mashed potatoes.  My family are small eaters so we always have tons of leftovers. This was nice because leftovers freeze well.

I made this without the peppers and added 1 cup of water to crock pot.  I cooked it on low for 9 hours and this turned out to be the best roast I have ever made. My daughter, that rarely eats red meat, asked for seconds! Mission accomplished!

This was the best pot roast I've ever EVER made. My pot roasts always seem to come out dry and tough. Not this recipe. I followed the recipe as is and it came out fork tender and melt in your mouth delicious. It was very moist, too! Just the right amount of flavor as well.  This will have a place in my regular rotation.

Great recipe! Roast was juicy and tender. My roast was a tad small so only used half of each packet to make sure it wasn't too salty. turned out perfect! Next time I will be adding potato's, onion and carrots to the bottom.

One of my new favorites. After it's done cooking I remove the roast from the crock pot and stir cooked egg noodles or rice into the remaining juice then serve along side the meat.

I make this all the time.  Adding a jar of juice from the pepperoncini jar with  tons of the pepperoncinis.  It is very good without the butter or just cut it down.  turns out great every time.  Also if you are out of ranch seasoning, onion soup seasoning works perfectly.

I had to use banana peppers because my supermarket didn't carry pepperoncini peppers.  I also added 1/4 cup water and I'm glad I did because the juice would have been too strong without it.  When I first tasted the meat I thought it was so-so then I tasted it again and again and became addicted. From now on when I want beef for dinner I'll definitely make this.

Have made it several times and will make again. Tasty and easy recipe. Last time we added veggies (carrots, potatoes, onions) like a traditional pot roast. The veggies picked up the flavors from the seasonings and were very good. May be a good option if you find the seasonings too salty.

Made this recipe a few times. I intitially had over cooked and dry roasts.  Though not terrible they still left a lot to be desired... Until I researched my newer digital model crock and decided to lower cooking time to 5 hours on low then 1 hour on warm setting while I was preparing sides (I also covered the small vent holes on lid with tape to keep moisture in). First, I gave my  buy-one-get-one-free shoulder roast a quick beating with my kitchen mallet to help tenderize it.  Additionally, I  threw in half the jar of peppers and half the juice.  OMG what a difference!  By far best roast I've ever made-super tender and fell apart easily. It even beat the pioneer woman's traditional roast! After crock finished, I drained the roast before serving and made gravy. For gravy I simmered drippings in saucepan and added mixture of 1/2 cup cool water and 4 tbsp corn scratch, simmer until thickened. Served with gravy and mashed potatoes - officially one of the family favorites now!

I made this recipe exactly as-is except I added a whole jar of pepperonchinis with the liquid.  Next time will not add the extra liquid as it did not need it at all.  It was hands down the best roast I have ever made in a crock pot and cannot wait to have it again!!!  The only downside is the amount of sodium.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and it always turns out great.  I usually add a whole stick of butter and some juice from the pepperoncini(I add a few more peppers,too). I  just made this with chicken breast tenders and it came out pretty good. Thanks for the recipe :)

I used a liner.  Lift the beef out to a cutting board and give it a rough slice.  Empty the juice to a sauce pan.  Remove peppers using a slotted spoon and slice.  Add the, less the stems, to the beef.  Cook the juice down until slightly thickened and use as au Jus.

Other than browning the pot roast first, I followed the recipe exactly.  I  should have left the butter out.  Too much fat!  Meat over cooked! Tasted like a heart attack on a plate, but  smelled terrific cooking.

I used Lipton's French onion soup mix instead of the gravy mix. Also, several reviews mentioned that the roast tasted very salty.  I added four or five sliced potatoes in an attempt to draw out the salt.  I also added a small can of sliced mushrooms (I love mushrooms).  Last but not least I added about twenty pepperoncini peppers and the juices.

Delicious! Second time I made this, I left out the butter, and it definitely doesn't need salt. Thickened up the sauce with a little flour and got a pot full of beautiful gravy. Sooooooo good!

Fantastic recipe! I've made in many times. Try it with pork loin and substitute the au jus mix for a country gravy mix.

Wonderful! I put in a whole jar of peppercinis and my 2 year old was even eating them! Today I warmed some of it up and served it in a pita pocket with spinach, mayo, garlic and herb cheese and a chopped green apple! Amazing!
