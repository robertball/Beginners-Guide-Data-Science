We made this for a surprise party for my elderly Mom. Thirty women of all ages enjoyed this and the diabetics in the crowd raved about it. Its wonderful for a sunny day refresher!

YUM! This is sooo refreshing and I LOVE that there is no wasted calories! Made as written, but except for adding in the ice, I just poured it over ice, so it wouldn't become watered down. This is gonna be great for the summer! Thanks for sharing. :)

Excellent! Sort of "winged" the measurements to make individual servings and it turned out fantastic. Everyone had to have one - or two!

This is a wonderful summertime drink whether you are diabetic or not!  It was a hit at my family gathering. For those that want a kick, you can add a touch of white rum.
