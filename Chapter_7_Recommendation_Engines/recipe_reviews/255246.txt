There is only two of us so I decided to use cornish hens instead of a whole chicken and it worked great for those too. Because they are much smaller I bumped the heat down to 400 and let them go for an hour and that was perfect. They came out super juicy and tender. I sprinkled paprika over them halfway through cooking but mostly only for color. This is a simple straight forward and no fail recipe.

Will def make again. Super moist and tender. The flavoring was perfect.
