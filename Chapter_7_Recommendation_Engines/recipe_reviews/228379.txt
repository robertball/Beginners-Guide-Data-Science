These cookies are great! I made them for my one year old so I left the sugar out and substituted coconut oil for the shortening and they turned out perfect. I had to bake a little longer than 12 mins.

Delicious! These were quick to make and very tasty. Used ww flour (did not have spelt), 1.5 c oats, halfed the salt, oil instead of shortening, 1/2 c brown sugar, no syrup, and it was sweet enough. Made these for my toddler but hubby and I loved them as well.

Great! I subbed butter for the shortening (since I don't cook with shortening) and they turned out wonderfully. They were a bit more runny than I was expecting, but they cooked great.
