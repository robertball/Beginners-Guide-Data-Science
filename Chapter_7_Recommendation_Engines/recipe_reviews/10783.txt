The first time I made these, as some others stated, they were a little "blah" but I changed the recipe:  I bumped up the peanut butter to a little over a cup and instead of teaspoon of vanilla, I added a tablespoon.  Much better!!  Only cooked these 8 minutes which leaves them a tad raw and they stay soft, but we are a "tad raw cookie" lovin' family, actually, the dough itself is to die for!  These are great with a rolo candy baked inside, too!

I had a craving for some peanut butter cookies and this sounded easy, so I made them. I used buttermilk pancake batter chunky peanutbutter and real vanilla. They turned out awesome!!! I also recommend bakeing them until golden brown which was about 15 minuters.

Delicious!  8 minutes still left them a bit pale and chewy, but my husband preferred those to my second batch (~12 minutes) which were more brown and crispy.  I liked the second batch better, so it's all in the preference :) UPDATE: These cookies only get better with age!  It is rare that cookies make it past a day or two without getting tossed in my house because they become dry, chewy, etc. but these became softer and even more delicious!  Almost a sugar cookie consistency but with peanut butter flavor - yum!

These cookies are just so-so. Nothin' to write home about. the dough was easy to work with. The flavor was very mild, too mild for our liking.

My 3 yr old daughter and i had fun making these today. We stirred 1 cup peanut butter and 1 Tbsp vanilla into the batter. Chilled, then i rolled the balls into sugar and put on the sheet. Then she dipped her fork into sugar & put the criss cross on the top of the cookies. We baked them 7 minutes for soft cookies and 11 for hard cookies. Thank you......
1/18/2010...We've made these cookies several times. This has become our favorite PB cookie recipe. We prefer soft cookies and these stay soft for days.

These were the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made. I made some with the chocolate and some without. They were great both ways. They were soft and not grainy like some peanut butter cookies can be. I'll definately make these again!

I think the recipes that don't call for bisquick might be even better (just because I prefer everything from scratch), but these are definitaly good and very easy. Instead of doing the traditional crisscross peanut butter cookies, I made the dough into peanut butter cup cookies. They all got eaten and everyone complimented. My brother loved them most.

made these with my older daughter today and the simplicity of this recipe is wonderful!  she was able to help with each of the steps.  using bisquick was helpful in limiting the number of steps and therefore keeps her from getting bored.  we rolled ours in different color sugars and chocolate sprinkles which she thought was great fun.  they are pretty decent tasting cookies too - nice and soft how i like them.  i think they need both more PB and more vanilla as they have a really light flavor and i prefer a more intense flavor. but nonetheless they were a great recipe for us to try this afternoon, thanks!

This is a good cookie. Very easy to make and they bake up very soft. I thought they were perfect baked about 7-8 minutes. I think they could taste a bit more peanut buttery, though. Maybe that's just personal preference. My kids love them.

Good little recipe!  Very similar to one I usually make from scratch, but much easier and quicker.  However, it only made 48 cookies for me.  Each one about 2" in diameter.  Keeper!

I was not pleased with the cookies at all. Tried cooking them a few minutes longer and still they came out the texture of pancakes. Wont be trying these again. I will admit this is only the first time not liking a recipe from this site and I have tried hundreds of them.

I got this same recipe from my grandmother, and they are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  They're soft and not greasy like the crispy ones sometimes are.

Good when you need to make some cookies on the fly. I upped the PB and vanilla. Not exactly like the 'long' version of PB cookies, but an acceptable shortcut.

I was doubtful at first, thinking something has got to be missing.  I was very suprised.  They were very good for quick and easy, took care off the craving and go great with milk.  Only 4 stars cause nothing beats my grandmas cookies. : ) I did add a little vanilla like grandma allways did.

These taste just ok but they were so easy to prepare. It would be a good recipe to make with kids. I did have to cook mine longer even though the submitter says don't overbake because my first batch were raw in the middle after 8 minutes.

I just made these using a cup of natural unsalted peanut butter, 1 TBSP vanilla, and Power Cakes flap jack mix.  I baked them for ten minutes, and they turned out fairly thick and dry.  I like how there is not a lot of sugar in them, but they do taste fairly bland.  Next time, I will try them with salted peanut butter and maybe even chunky!  A good basic recipe that is pretty healthy, and my kids even like them.
