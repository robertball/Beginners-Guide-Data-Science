So yummy!  I halved the milk and sugar and didn't mash the avocado completely.  Mixed it into a good vanilla ice cream and it was delicious!  Millions of people consider avocados to be a dessert food, and pumpkin a savory food!

This is very tasty, but I think I would rather add something else to my ice cream, such as berries.
