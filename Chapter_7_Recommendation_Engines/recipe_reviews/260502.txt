Excellent flavor!  Next time I'll definitely lower the cook time by half - the cauliflower turned out overcooked and completely fell apart while stirring in the cheese.  Instead of half and half, I used heavy cream to make it more keto-friendly. I did use pork bacon instead of turkey bacon (again, to make it more keto/fatty) and browned it with the onion as suggested in the recipe notes.  To thicken, I whisked in about 1/2 tsp of konjac powder, which is keto-compliant.

This was really good! I’m on my third week of a keto diet so a made a few changes to lower the carbs a bit, and some just because of preference. First, I cooked about 6 slices of bacon in a cast iron skillet. I saved a bit of the grease to sauté the onions and garlic. I omitted the bell peppers (6 grams of carbs). I added chorizo because I had it on hand and it sounded good. I sautéed all of this with the cauliflower and a bit of the broth to get the goodies at the bottom of the pan. I followed directions as written on the rest in the instant pot, except I did half heavy cream and have 1/2 and 1/2 to cut carbs again. I also did half store bought shredded cheddar and half fancier English cheddar block. 
All my family loved it and they are not doing keto diet (They topped theirs with lo mein noodles).  I have enough left over for three lunches this week as well, and I’m looking forward to it.

My insta pot was in my RV but I did make this with all stated ingredients on my stove top (as noted I substituted real bacon instead of turkey bacon) . 

I thought it was great, my hubby added way more salt (he has a problem;) & my kiddos ate their whole bowl.

Not sure what the other reviewer meant about it being mushy......it's soup sooooooo maybe it just needed blended more.  Anyhow I followed recipe except did it on my stove top which means it took more time & before adding the cheese and half & half I did have to blend it in my ninja blender to make it a soup consistency. So if someone else doesn't have an insta pot you can do it on the stove with a regular pot but you will most likely need to blend it to make it soup consistency. 

We will keep this recipe & make again even when not on the Keto diet.

Great soup! Made with real bacon. Sautéed bacon first and then added onions and garlic. No need for olive oil. Skipped the green pepper. Cooked for only 9 minutes on high pressure but did 10 minute natural release. Used an immersion blender before adding cream and cheese etc.  it was excellent!! Super easy!

My wife and I both hate cauliflower, but this soup was excellent. I used an immersion blender like many others. Tastes like a really good potato soup.

I am new to Instant Pot(R).  This is a very easy and tasty base soup recipe.  You could easily turn this into a ham and potato soup, broccoli cheddar, or  a creamy vege.  The possibility's are endless.  I followed this recipe exactly.  However, I did use my immersion hand blender after the pressure cooking part was done: before I added the cheese, half n half, and bacon.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks!!

I made this per the instructions.  I am new to the IP, so was confused about which pressure cooking I should use- as the recipe didn’t specify low or high.  I went with low pressure for 14 minutes as other reviewers recommended 7-8 min in their reviews.  After the cooking finished, I did transfer to a blender to purée it, then back to the IP to finish off the recipe with the half n half etc.  Both hubby & I really liked it!  Will make again for sure.

The base recipe tasted like the foundation for broccoli cheese soup, so I added broccoli, cooked for an additional 10 min in the instant pot  and then blended with an immersion blender.  Tasted great.  I wouldn't make this by itself as directed for the family since only two of us like cauliflower, but with the addition of the broccoli, it became something all of us could enjoy.  Only big change I would make is to double the turkey bacon.  Regular bacon may have enough flavor, but turkey bacon is a little blander.

This is an excellent base and then you can add what you like or have in the kitchen.  I diced up smoked garlic roasted sausage instead of bacon.  Everything else was the recipe!  I'll definitely make again!

I won an instant pot at my work holiday party, and this is the second time I’ve used it. I knew this soup would be tasty, but my hubby was skeptical as he said, “you’re using THAT much cauliflower?!?” The only changes I made was 3 cloves garlic, sautéd the onion in leftover bacon grease (maybe a TBS?) and after adding the cream/half and half, I added two good dashes of smoked paprika, one healthy dash of cayenne pepper, and thickened with a thin slurry of flour and water. I did use an immersion blender to break the veggies up a little but not completely puréed. My hubby told me it was good, and he sounded sincere. This is a keeper! Maybe I’ll add some diced potato instead of a slurry next time!

Didn't add the peppers, and didn't add the hot sauce because I can't take spicy food at all, but other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out so good!

I made it, it tasted AWESOME, I'd recommend sprinkling the cheese in slowly.. mine got a little chunky :)    I also added about 14 'dashes' of habanero sauce as it wasn't very hot.    My husband loved this!!! Thank you

Followed recipe for the most part.  I used an entire bag of cauliflower from Costco and some Wine chorizo sausage instead of bacon as I wanted a little extra flavour and heat.  (I will try it it with maple smoked bacon another time though.)  I used a small orange and small yellow pepper. I blended  1/1/2 cups of the finished soup and added it back to the pot before adding some heavy cream.  It gives the broth  some creaminess  without adding a lot of cream or milk.  Turned out awesome!

Being a “Weigh Watcher” I used low fat (2% milk) cheddar and no fat half&half. Other than increasing bacon to 12 oz package, the recipe was followed as written right up to the end when I decided to put the soup in my blender; once puréed, I then added the diced bacon. 
Wonderful soup as fall is turning to winter, this soup will follow us to spring.

We loved it!! But, my husband does not like cooked cauliflower, so I substituted broccoli.  Great to have recipes for my Instant Pot --  but will cook a little less as the broccoli was overdone for our tastes.

Followed the directions pretty closely, but did cut back some on the onion powder (1T is a lot) and Dijon mustard.  Between the bacon, cheese, onion powder, and Dijon mustard, the taste of the cauliflower got completely overpowered. Still, it wasn’t bad, but my family wasn’t crazy about it.

I used whipped cream and milk, sliced ham, A bag of trader Joe cauliflower florets, And a low sodium chicken broth to counteract the 1100 mg of sodium. I use the immersion blender. I set the instant pot soup setting on 15 minutes but after 8 minutes I did slow release and it took the other 7 minutes to release the steam. It was delicious and filling!

This is good. I don’t have an instapot so I made it on the stovetop. With that cooking method, I think it would be a little thicker if I had blended a cup or so in a blender or food processor.

The Dijon mustard gave it a weird taste, too twangy also the cauliflower was a little lumpy may need to puree it for better texture.

The vegetables are soft and my family ignored that it was cauliflower as it isn't our favorite thing.  Good flavor and fast prep.  Nice sunday afternoon soup on a winter day

Even though I did not follow the recipe exactly, it turned out so good, I had to give it 5 stars. Had to sub sweet onion for yellow, broccoli for cauliflower, pork bacon for turkey bacon and colby for cheddar.  Delicious and light

I just started the KETO diet and could live on this soup.  I made it exactly as written except I used regular bacon.   Delicious.

This is really good! As a diabetic I try to eat lower carb foods.  I have steered away from cauliflower as it always has a fishy flavor to me.  But this soup is amazing!

In an attempt to reduce dairy in my diet, I used Dayia brand cheddar cheese alternative and canned coconut cream. It turned out great!  I would make this soup again.

The only change I made was before I added the whipping cream and cheese I puréed the Cauliflower then I put it back in the Dutch oven. Then added 2 cups of cheese and one cup of heavy whipping cream. Then for the toppings I added chives bacon and a sprinkle of cheddar cheese it is delicious. Cauliflower loaded soup.

Wow!  Really, really good!  Love the mustard and hot sauce with the creamy base, and the cauliflower turned out perfect!  I used my stove top instead of my instapot, it worked great!  I'll definitely be making this again, thank you!

Super easy, and so delicious!!  I've been looking for a flavorful cauliflower cheese soup for a long time, this one is a keeper.  My husband has been on the Keto diet for about 9 months and follows it religiously (with great results!), so this one is perfect for us.  I used frozen cauliflower and followed the directions closely - next time I will use fresh so the cauliflower holds up a little better (my fault for not wanting to take the time to cut up a fresh head).  This may be my favorite soup of all time!!

I made this exactly as the recipe says.  It is great and makes a good quick lunch or dinner reheated in the microwave.

I followed the recipe but cut the cook time by half as others instructed. It is a good comfort food type soup that I will make again.

I also made just a couple of changes - shortened the pressure time to 8 minutes, didn't add the (regular not turkey) bacon to the soup but just sprinkled on top and also used cream. 
This was delicious. I will make it again.
