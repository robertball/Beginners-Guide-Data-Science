This was absolutely delicious!  Even my picky eaters loved it.  My only change was to use two hungarian green peppers (less hot than other peppers) because my girls don't like it too spicy.  I also made my own Garam Masala blend (2 teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 2 teaspoon black pepper, 3 teaspoon ground cumin, 3 teaspoon ground coriander, and 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1 teaspoon ground cloves).  Mix those well and use amount called for in recipe.

We enjoyed this. I also tried it with the 2 tbsp curd (yogurt in my case) and 1 tbsp cream suggested by the other reviewer and they added a nice creaminess to the lentils.

DELICIOUS.  I used red lentils (all I had) and about 3 cups water.  I doubled the spices and added 1 bullion cube.  Will definitely be making again.

This was very good and flavorful, though I found 4 chilies were hot enough for us. So next time I will use 2 or 3 chilies instead. Thanks for your wonderful Indian dishes, Susmita.

Thoughts: I thought this was a flavorful dish. I used the Kashmiri Garam Masala recipe from food.com for the spice and serrano peppers for the chilis when making this. I used 2 times the amount of tumeric and garam masala this recipe asked for.

Question that came to mind: Should I be simmering the onions and peppers long enough to make them super soft that they dissolve into the dish? I can tell I'm biting into tomatoes and urad dals, but am I suppose to be biting into onions and peppers too? Or are they only for flavor?

Request: Can more people post pictures of this dish?

It was perfect! The only thing I changed was cooking my beans in chicken broth! Love this recipe!

My husband who is Indian absolutely loved it! This was delicious, healthy and full of protein, fabulous and easy for a lunch time meal. Took a bit longer than the 40 minute total  stated because I only soaked it for 4 hours, I would recommend using a pressure cooker or remembering to soak overnight....Will definitely make it again :)

Great, healthy recipe.  The whole family liked it.  I used 1/2 tsp. salt and might use a little bit more next time.  I served it with brown basmati as I didn't have any of the breads on hand. UPDATE: I didn't have green chili, so I used a 1/2 Tbs. chili powder and 1/2 tsp. red chili flakes (for a 6 serving portion).  Upped salt to 1tsp.  Great again over quinoa this time.  Thank you!

All the grown ups at the table loved it. I ate it with some sour cream on the side, but it didn't need it. Very good comfort food indeed!

This was a very enjoyable meal, but pimped the recipe just a bit. I added some cumin seeds and asafoetida, roasted them prior to the onions, and used only one bird green chili and it was just enough to my taste. Also added some heavy cream at the end of the cooking to add a creamy side to the dish. 

My split uraad daal took more time to cook, maybe 45-55 minutes even if I soaked them for at least 4 hours.

I accompanied this with a pulao rice. It was great! Thanks!
