I sauteed half a yellow bell pepper, 4oz sliced mushrooms, one bag of baby spinach & three cloves of garlic in olive oil for about 7 minutes, then topped a pre-made crust with some home-made spicy hummus, the sauteed veggies, and mozzarella cheese. Cooked it for 8 minutes at 425 and fell in love...

WOW!!!!!! I would rate this 500 stars.. it is SO GOOD! At first, I was reluctant to try it b/c it seemed like a weird combination and rather boring, but that is NOT TRUE. TRY IT. The hummus sort of melts a bit into the dough and makes it soft and moist and delicious, but still (sort of) pizza-like. I added onion and got rid of broccoli (personal preference), but I get the feeling you can add pretty much whatever you want on this - alfalfa sprouts, anything. Again, WOW - a keeper.

This recipe is GREAT and very quick and easy!  We usually make this recipe with a pre-baked pizza crust (Mama Mary's, Boboli, etc.) which makes it even faster and easier to prepare.  Also, we'll sometimes use other cheeses (Co-Jack, Cheddar, Mozzerella) and sometimes use other toppings (onions, artichoke hearts, sliced chicken, etc.).
This is one of my favorite pizzas, and by far the easiest, tastiest pizza that I have ever made myself.

WOW!  I had some reservations, but I was blown away by this one!  Made mine with alphalfa sprouts and red onion, with Monterey Jack and Colby cheese.  Delicious!  I'll never go back to red sauce again.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Very tasty, but a little dull in flavour.  I would definately put garlic in it next time.

I thought this was a nice change.  I used a flavored hummus, and I added some grated parmesan for a more robust flavor.

This was really good, but I have to say I do still love a red sauce. I used the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust recipe off of this website instead of the pre-made kind, and I think this pizza would get even better once I get better at making my own crust. I really liked the bell peppers and broccoli though, and I have enough extra to where I could make this again. Nice alternatice to the regular kind of pizza though!

I could not believe how good this is. Even my picky picky husband loved it...minus the cheese and veggies of course. On his side I used grilled chicken and spices, and mine had mozzarella, broccoli, and mushrooms. I used store bought pizza dough and regular hummus, and it was so yummy!

This pizza was absolutely delicious! I made it with extra garlic and loaded on the veggies.  I also used whole wheat pizza dough (from Trader Joe's).  Excellent change from the usual pizza!

Yum!  I used Trader Joe's wheat pizza dough and their spicy hummus.  I would recommend getting a hummus with some type of extra flavor because the flavor of the pizza comes from the hummus.  As for toppings, I added chopped up spinach, tomatoes, red onions, small broken up pieces of broccoli, and reduced fat cheese.  I followed the cooking direction on the pizza dough's package.  It came out great and it is a fun alternative to regular pizza.

This is a great recipe. I actually add about half a can of tomato paste into the hummus before spreading it onto the crust. Also, I drop my veggies into the food processor and chop them into fine crumbles. It sounds weird but it really works great and tastes great. I use cauliflower and broccoli, peppers and onion.

Step it up: Instead of/in addition to mozarella, it's nice to crumble some feta on top of the veggie crumbles, and top with halved kalamata olives to make it a very Greek pizza. Don't scoff at this recipe til you try it, it is amazingly wonderful!

Yum!  I've had this in my file folder for a couple of years and I've only gotten around to making it today.  I used homemade hummus and instead of broccoli I topped the pizza with caramelized onions, red peppers, and mushrooms.  It was surprisingly filling, and I could only finish a slice and a half.  The only thing I found, is that the hummus towards the crust that I didn't put any cheese on, seemed to be kind of crunchy and dry.  Definitely make sure you put the cheese all over the hummus or brush it with some olive oil.  It was still tasty, but had a weird texture.

This is so delicious!  You can also make a tasty vegan pizza by leaving off the cheese.  The hummus gives a vegan pizza more umph than red sauce without cheese does!  I love the way the hummus soaks into the crust.  Pile on the veggies!  This pizza is a hit!

This pizza was very good but as written is somewhat bland. I will definately make this again but will use a flavored hummus and add basil or some other spices.

This was very good.  I would reccomend cutting the hummus to 3/4 cup.  It was just a little too much.  The hummus gives most of the flavor so make sure you are using a good hummus otherwise you probably won't care for this.

This pizza was exactly what I was hoping for - nutritious and something a little different than what we normally eat. I made it exactly as the recipe states and we thought it was delicious! My three year old ate it (apparently he will eat veggies if it's in pizza form, I must remember this!), and my husband said that I can make it again anytime. The hummus as the sauce gives this pizza an interesting flavor, but it's subtle, so if you don't like hummus don't count this one out if you're looking for something healthy to eat. Try it! This would be a good one to experiment with and use different toppings for variety. Thank you for this recipe!

Very yummy. Bought premade dough in grocery and added my favorite veggie toppings. I sauteed onions, mushrooms and fresh garlic cloves in butter before adding to the pizza for baking.

This is easy and tasty! Throw anything on top that you like on pizza (I actually put salmon with the other veggies) and it's a fast, easy, and tasty meal.

I loved this pizza, and so did my picky 2yo daughter. I used Meditteranean hummus and red pepper spread- both from Trader Joe's. For cheese, I put Asiago and a mixture of cheddar, Jack, Monterey, and mozzarella (can you tell I LOVE cheese). For veggies, I used fresh basil, mushroom, red & orange peppers. It was so yummy!  Thank you for this recipe:)

We LOVED this!  Only used about 1/2 cup red pepper hummus with a whole wheat boboli crust.  Also added some onion and little feta.

I found this recipe and thought it would be a good way to use up a new hummus recipe that I'd tried and didn't really care for.  The hummus that I made was a little on the bland side, hence the pizza was a little on the bland side, but we still loved it!  Added all the veggies that we wanted and this was a really nice change!  Can't wait to try it with my usual hummus recipe!  In the meantime, an EXCELLENT way to use up that hummus that we don't like too much. :)  Update: This is my all-time, hands-down FAVORITE pizza.  Use really flavorful hummus and it helps to pre-bake your crust - it won't get as soggy as leftovers.  I pile raw veggies sky-high on this and glue it all down with sharp cheddar cheese.  MMmmm... I love this pizza.

What a fantastic recipe! I used broccoli, spinach & vegetarian pepperoni. I also used reduced fat mozzarella & red onions (no red peppers). I did cook this differently, though-more like a quesadilla than an actual pizza! I used a whole wheat tortilla & spread the hummus (used the garlic kind) onto the whole thing-spritzed one side w/ butter spray & lay it in a skillet. I topped one half of the tortilla w/ the veggies & cheese (I sauteed the broccoli for a minute or so to soften it up beforehand). I folded it over & let the whole thing cook on medium low for a few minutes till the cheese melted. It was wonderful!! Thanks for sharing this.

Great pizza. I did use a Boboli crust and roasted red pepper hummus. Very awesome. I added green pepper, mushrooms, tomatoes, onion, broccoli, and spinach. I plan on making it again this weekend with a pre made whole wheat crust.

Very good.  I used artichoke hummus on top of the Crazy pizza dough from this site.  Instead of broccoli, kiser spinach and sprinkled some crushed red chili pepper on top of the hummus.  Turned out very well.  Will definitely make again.

I made this with a whole wheat crust and added broccoli, fresh basil and a 5 cheese blend. I used a garlic hummus spread. This weekend I will try a buffalo hummus spread. This is a surprisingly delicious recipe!

This was really good for the first few bites.  Then, about 1/2 of the way through, just something started to not be as yummy.  Maybe it was that I used Roasted Garlic flavor hummus.  Maybe it was that I used too much hummus.  Maybe that I used pre-cooked individual pizza crusts.  Hubby loved it, but he loves hummus anyway.  It's a good recipe to try, though, and I do recommend it.

what a remarkably simple yet versatile recipe!  i used pita bread as a crust and, since i was lacking in toppings, just covered the cheese with basil, oregano, red pepper flakes, and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.  instant personal pizza.  it tasted fantastic and was done in ten minutes!

At first my family and I were not sure about the Hummus on the pizza, but it really turned out to be a great combination! Can't wait to try it again with different toppings.

awesome! made on cheese & garlic flatbread. Used the 'hummus III' recipe on this site... followed this recipe as stated, but added 3 cloves garlic, half of a small red onion and some spinch (suggestion I read in another review), sauteed in olive oil... it was delicious!

WE LOVE THIS!!  We were a bit hesitant to try it, but when you think about it, it all goes together.  We have tried it now with all different kinds of cheeses and whatever veggies we would normally dip in hummus.  Every time I tell people about it they look at me like I am crazy, but you have to try this recipe.  IT ROCKS!

I had a lot of fun with this dish, although I tweaked mine slightly.  I bought artisan bread and let it warm up in the oven as I sauted bell peppers and cucumbers.  After a few minutes, I pulled the bread out and spread a generous amount of red bell pepper hummus over the entire thing.  Then I put the sauted bell peppers and cucumber on top and topped that off with feta cheese.  It was soooo delicious and made excellent left-overs.

I did my own thing as far as the toppings (mushrooms, bell pepper, zucchini, feta cheese) and used my recipe for whole wheat pasta dough.  The warm hummus w the toasty veggies was super good.  I love the variety you can have w this type of pizza bc there are so many kinds of hummus to use and veggies to accompany it.  I might just make this once a week!

I thought this was really great. My Israeli boyfriend said it was sacrilegious to use hummus in such a manner but it lent a very creamy texture. I took the idea from another recipe to use a tortilla instead of pizza crust and I added olives, mushrooms, green pepper, onion and a sprinkle of mozzarella. On a tortilla it only needed about eight minutes in the oven. Really nice change of flavor!

DELISH. I used frozen broccoli and frozen peppers/onions (cooked them beforehand) so it took about 5 minutes to set it up. It was absolutely yummy, totally easy and I will definitely be making it again.   My 3yo AND my meat/potatoes husband gobbled it up!

This was an amazing recipe! I made mine with Tribe garlic hummus and naan bread. Naan is a flat bread which is eaten commonly with hummus. It was a perfect substitution with the medditeranean themed pizza. I used shredded mexican style cheese which was what we had on hand at the time, but I'm sure any cheese would be great. I also sprinkled feta cheese which I found to be what I would go for each bite! The veggies I used were red peppers and red onions and a little bit of hot Giardiniera relish to spice it up! I obviously tailored this to my favorite ingredients. But if you like all these it really pulls together quite nice! And what a beautiful presentation!! Will make this all the time!

I really liked the flavors of this a lot.  Unfortunately, it burned . . . I think the temperature may have been too high.  The edges were burned but the center was not cooked very well; and I only baked it for 12 mins.  I think next time I'll cook it at 425.  Otherwise, it was yummy-love the hummus idea.  I used Roasted Garlic hummus, bell peppers and asparagus.  I put sliced cooked sausage on half for my husband.  Served with a fruit salad for an easy, quick and delicious meal!  I'll definitely make it again-it's very adaptable to a variety of toppings as well as different hummus flavors too.  Thanks!!

Great, simple lunch recipe.  I made homemade dough, but used pre-made hummus, and red peppers, broccoli, and monterey jack cheese as the recipe describes.  It was easy and very tasty.  I might add some garlic and onions next time- I also added salt.  Will definitely make it again!

This was very good.  I ended up making this for a friend after she had a baby.  I used the roasted garlic hummus atop the thin crust boboli crust, with red onions, portobello mushrooms, yellow bells, pizza cheese and broccoli... it was a huge hit... A great variation from your regular red sauce!

Super simple to make, and a yummy switch from regular pizza.  Love the fresh veggies!  I don't know that this is any healthier than regular red sauce pizza, but it's still good.  I used a little less hummus than the recipe calls for because I was nervous, but it was okay.  If you like hummus, slap it all on there.

This was a really good recipe; a nice change up from some of the more usual tomato-based pizzas. I would also like to try it with spinach and garlic like some others have suggested. The broccoli was very good, but could be overpowering for someone who does not love broccoli. Either way, lots of garlic would always be good in a dish like this IMO. Will definitely make again.

Love the idea of this.  Given the Mediterranean base, though, I think the toppings listed don't work as well as others do.  The second time I switched to artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, carmelized onions, and freshly shredded parmesan which worked much better with the flavor palette created by the hummus.  Out of the oven, I topped it with fresh chopped cherry tomatoes.  In any case, I do think a flavored hummus is essential. The addition of a drizzle of excellent quality balsamic makes it even better.

I was a skeptic but went for it. I used ground turkey, garlic, banana peppers, brocolli feta cheese, spicy red hummus and garlic salt. I had one piece and loved it and to my surprise -- my husband ate the REST! Will make again!

Neither bf or I were sold on this.  I think it's the cooked hummus and melted cheese that made the bf turn up his nose; I wasn't too big of a fan of that either.  I think I'll try other recipes that don't cook the hummus or cheese; I think we'd like those better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Much better than I expected.  I used a spicy red pepper hummus, refrig pizza dough, onions, peppers, broccoli and carrots.  I will make this again...varieties are endless and so simple.

This was surprisingly good.  Thanks for the idea.  I used a flour tortilla crust, added onions, yellow peppers, basil, goat cheese, mozzarella and parmesan.  Very filling and yummy!

We really liked this! We did mushrooms and broccoli and I think next time we might add chicken.  I also will spread the hummus a little thinner next time.  A great change from regular pizza!

This was delicious, nice alternative to the traditional pizza.  So fast and easy to make. I added green bell pepper, tomato, and fresh spinach and sprinkled the top with garlic salt.   I think any vegetables you add will be delicious.  Definitely keep in my recipe box.

I loved this pizza! For the toppings, I sauteed one red bell pepper, one onion and a few large mushrooms. I used fresh mozzarella in place of monterey jack and this turned out perfect. I am not sure this would have been good with broccoli, so I'm glad I left it out.

This was delicious! I used a premade crust, topped with roasted garlic hummus, then topped with sauteed onions and red bell peppers, and finally mozzarella and provolone cheeses.... It turned out wonderful, and so easy to prepare. Perfect for a quick dinner. The leftovers are really good cold as well.

This is a great alternative to the run of the mill pizza.  I still had to have my tomato flavor though, so I added thin slices of roma tomato all over the top instead of broccoli.  I also added some sweet onion, too.

So good!  We used roasted red pepper hummus, sautéed baby bellas, red onion, red pepper and garlic in two tsp olive olive, topped with the sautéed veggies plus quartered artichoke hearts, sliced black olives, sliced roma tomatoes and crumbled feta.  I might add diced chicken next time.

OMG sOOO good!! I'm a pizza fanatic but also very open minded to "non-authentic" pizzas that play with ingredients. (think I'm just a fan of bread with stuff on it ^_^) anyway, the great thing about this recipe is that it has lot's of room for variations.  I used refrigerated pizza crust (next time, I'll make that from scratch), my own red pepper hummus, jack cheese, frozen spinach drained well, lots of mushrooms, and topped with feta cheese. (was going to add some roasted chicken but didn't have any on hand - but since i didn't, it made for a great vegetarian recipe) **simply gorgeous! thanks for a creative new way to use hummus!

I used the Hummus III recipe from this site and added some sun dried tomatoes to the hummus. I bought whole wheat Boboli pizza crust and topped it with some garlic, roma tomatoes, spinach, bell peppers, artichoke hearts and mozarella/provolone cheese blend. YUM! My husband raved!  This with a side salad made a nice light dinner. Definately a keeper!

Wonderful!  I made it using Hummus III from this site and a Mama Mary's pizza crust.  We used spinach, artichoke hearts, chopped roma tomatoes, red bell peppers, and monterey jack cheese.  The kids demolished it!   This one is a keeper!

This is the best pizza!  We used garlic hummus and followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I may add even more veggies such as artichoke hearts, mushrooms, olives etc.  The combinations are endless!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Was very surprised that we did not love this recipe.  We love hummus, veggies and pizza.  The only changes to the recipe I made were to add a chopped tomato and sprinkle a little garlic on my plain hummus.  Really wanted to like it but didn't.

I was reluctant to try this considering I had never even had hummus before.  I am SO glad I did!! I used roasted red pepper hummus, broccoli, yellow bell pepper, quarted grape tomatoes, and probably about 3 cups of cheese.  This recipe was awesome!!  I will def be making this from now on.  And it's so easy!!

I really enjoyed this recipe, my husband thought it a bit bland.  Next time I would use more hummus (I don't think I used the full cup, so I think it needed more hummus flavor).  Plus I would add more veggies per my husband's suggestion (again, I did not use full amounts - just place veggies around to look nice).  I probably only used about a cup of mozzarella as well, but I don't think it needed any more than that.

I made this twice in the last ten days.
It is so fast and easy (using ready-made crust) I may never buy a frozen pizza again.
The first time I made my own crust, used peppers, onions, mushrooms, and mozerella for topping.  I think it was on the table in forty minutes.
The second time I used a ready made crust and I prepped about five minutes and cooked for twelve minutes.
I was never a huge fan of tomato sauce anyway, and my husband and I think this is much better than a traditional pizza.
I highly recommend you try this.. it would also be a great appetizer or the perfect thing for meat-eaters to serve when vegetarians come over.
I recommend sprinkling it with a little garlic salt or adding fresh minced garlic to the hummus.

I had my doubts, but this was fantastic.  I bought pre-sliced veggies (red, green, yellow peppers, broccoli, mushrooms, onions) for $2.49 and then Jiffy pizza crust for .59, and it turned out great! I used a blend of regular hummus with garlic hummus and it was great (I usually have hummus on hand). A very nice change of pace and it still feels like I cooked a "real meal!"

Wow! Yummy recipe! I made my own crust, and subed the broccoli for marinated artichoke hearts. I used a hummus that was really heavy in garlic which worked great, I think :)

This tastes fantastic!! I will definitely make it again. I used a cheese crust recipe found on AllRecipes. Cheesy Skillet Crust I think it’s called. All these toppings were a little heavy for that cheese crust but we didn’t mind! It was yummy!

Yes! Wonderful! one of the best I ever had! I used a Boboli thin crust, thinly spread with classic hummus. Sprinkled with parmesan cheese followed by shredded mozzarella. I sautéed roughly chopped fresh mushrooms, and thinly sliced onion in olive oil with 1 Tbsp of butter, salt and pepper, until liquid releases and then  evaporates. Spread evenly over the pizza. Topped pizza with 5-6 small dollops of freshly made pesto. Baked on a pizza stone for 10 minutes or until sizzling on top. Removed from oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving. Absolutely delicious!

This was an awesome recipe!! We couldn't find Monterey Jack Cheese so we substituted Gouda. I put broccoli, red bell peppers, onions, and olives on top of the garlic hummus. For 18 minutes on 475. 

GREAT RECIPE!!

We made this using naan bread (too lazy to have to bake refrigerated pie crust),  and used many of our favorite pizza topping.  Everyone heard hummus for the sauce and was completely grossed out.  Well, it turned out wonderful with not a single slice left!   Will make again....but not with supremely spicy hummus, that was a little too spicy.

Yum! For a light lunch, I drizzled a little EVOO on a whole wheat tortilla, layered the hummus, broccoli, red onion, cauliflower, red pepper, and Mexi cheese (just what I had on hand) and baked at 425 for 12 minutes.

Weirdly good. I added onion, and garlic. Just a heads up, since the pizza baked in just 10 minutes the veggies were not fully cooked. I happen to prefer crunchy veggies, so that's okay for me but others might need to tweak the cooking time. Will make again.

This was delicious.  My whole family enjoyed it.  I made only 2 changes.  I sautéed the peppers before putting them on the pizza, and I only had pepper-jack cheese rather than Monterey Jack  - but I think it added a nice bite to the pizza.

This is a fantastic pizza.  Let me be the first one to tell you that my boyfriend was crazy skeptical of this pizza.  He did not think it was going to be good at all.  Turns out he ate more than half of the pizza in one sitting (usually he eats only 1/4 of the pizza).  

We used roasted red pepper hummus and put chicken, bell pepper, artichoke hearts, black olives, mozzarella and feta cheese.  I sprinkled red chili pepper flakes all over the top of the pizza.

We prebaked the pizza for 7 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then we topped the pizza and baked it for about 10 more minutes at the same temperature.

Very yummy!  I used roasted garlic hummus, and since I happened to have some turkey pepperoni around, I added that as well.  Nice change of pace, and a good way to get veggies into kids.

This was awesome.  Found whole wheat dough at the deli counter at my grocery store,  Used broccoli, red peppers, red onions, and baby spinach.  Added a bit of fresh grated parmesan and used both mozzarella and sharp cheddar.  My husband loved it and we ate the whole thing!  This will be a new staple at our house.

Loved it as the recipe went and then even tried it with layerd soft taco tortillas to get more of a mouthful if hummus.  Great idea!  Never had hummus warm so this just took it to a whole nother level.  Mmmm

Really really good!  Used Martha White pizza dough mix, very thin and crispy.  I used red pepper hummus, added roasted garlic and red onions along with the broccoli and red bell pepper. I also used pepper jack cheese which added some nice spice. I made it for my weekly girls dinner and it was a huge hit!

Tasty but we did change it up a bit, so really we just used it for the idea.  Instead of store bought crust and hummus, we made our own of both because no canned grub can beat homemade... ;) Also, like the picture showed, we added several different vegetables that we always love to eat with raw hummus.  Cheese is not really necessary and then the recipe could be vegan, and we did 1/2 with and 1/2 without and the difference was not very stark, and we love cheese.  All in all, we will make it again.

I just loved this recipe. I did follow the picture when adding the ingredients. The picture shows black olives but the recipe doesn't say anything about olives. My daughter and I loved it. You must be a hummus lover in order to make this. A keeper for sure!!!

This was an amazing recipe! I made my own small dough ball and stretched it out really thinly. The recipe called for Monterey Jack which I didn’t have so I used mozzarella with a little bit of feta. I placed generous amounts of broccoli florets and red peppers. To my surprise, this was rather delicious! I did add a few red pepper flakes which went well with it.

I used garlic hummus, chicken, turkey bacon, jalapenos, mushrooms, onions, and assorted peppers and topped with Monterrey-jack cheese. Was delicious! And a nice twist to the typical "pizza". Also, less calories than using olive oil as the base.

I love the concept. It was delicious, but I made some changes.

I made my own hummus and added some garlic for flavor. I also cut back on the cheese so that it wouldn't overwhelm the other flavors and added some onion (because I really love onion.)

Would definitely recommend and make again.

We REALLY liked this pizza. It was nice for a change. However, I changed it up a bit to try to make it gluten free. I used corn tortillas and added mushrooms, mozzarella and feta cheese. You can't pick it up like a pizza but is a delicious gluten free, vegetarian alternative.

Very good. I made half of the pizza as the recipe indicated, and the other half with grilled chicken, onion, red pepper, and garlic. I liked the chicken side better, but the veggie side as very good too. It seems there's a lot you can do with this. I might try feta, oregano, and tomato next time!

This was a very good and unique pizza.  I was pleased with the results.  I more used this as a guideline rather than following the specific recipe.  For the crust, I used the Garlic Lover's Pizza Crust recipe from this site.  I did not measure out a cup of hummus, only estimated what looked good.  For toppings I used spinach (under the cheese so it would not burn), broccoli, and red pepper.  For the cheese, I used a pizza blend.

Hubby and I liked it a lot, but my two toddlers didn't like it. They said, "how can this be a pizza without pepperonis?" It is good in its own right but may or may not be popular with your kids.

Loved it! I needed a quick meal before working out and this fit the bill perfectly! I put the toppings on a heat & serve bread. Peppers, green onions, hummus, cheese, fresh parm cheese, & whatever veggies I had.

I made two of these the other night with Michaela's modifications...kinda...i used 2 green, 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper, a package of sliced mushrooms, a medium onion diced, about 6 cloves of garlic and a giant handful of spinach (yeah, I wasn't reading so well) but this monster portion of veggies sauted down enough to fit (they mostly stayed on the dough) on two pizzas.

When chopping the bell peppers, I removed the inner membrane (the white/pale bits around the seeds) as much as possible.  I used garlic hummus and premade pizza dough.  I cooked all this at 450 until the dough was golden, maybe 15 mins?

If I had better knife skills, this would be faster than ordering pizza!

We make homemade pizza all the time and always like to try different sauces and toppings.  Everyone in my house was pretty skeptical about using hummus for the sauce but it really came out amazing!  I think it might be my new favorite pizza.  I didn't use broccoli but sauteed other veggies instead.  I don't think it really matters what veggies you put on - it is the hummus that makes this unique.

Oh this is just wonderful! I added some chopped sun dried tomatoes and omitted the broccoli.  This is one of those recipes that you can change up depending on what toppings you enjoy.  I also used a mix of feta and mozzarella cheese rather than monterey jack.  Thanks for the recipe :)

WOW!  am pleasantly surprised.  I made a homemade whole wheat stir n roll dough, topped with my homemade hummus, carmelized onions, spinach, zucchini, some Feta and some cheddar. It is SOOO yummy! Thanks - I was looking for a way to use up these ingredients and this was excellent!

I thought this was very good!  I think next time I'll use a more garlicky hummus, but still this was very flavorful.  I used Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Dough from this site, and topped with peppers, scallions, carrots, zucchini and a four bend Italian cheese (which I went a little light on).  I brushed the crust with olive oil and sprinkled with oregano and parmesan.  Great change from regular pizza!

I made two changes: used a trio of hummus spreads - sundried tomato, garlic, and regular and spread each on a different part of the pizza dough. I also used a 5 cheese italian blend instead. This was really quick and easy. We were surprised at how tasty the hummus was. My husband didn't even know it was hummus until I told him. We'll definitely make this one again!

I loved the hummus on this pizza.  I spread spinach hummus on 1/2 of the pizza and red pepped hummus on the other half.  Will make again!!!

SO yummy!  It's a great tasting healthy idea for pizza...of course unless you eat the whole thing which I almost did because it's so good!

This was very good. The hummus puffed up a little which made it pretty, too.

SO good! We made our own hummus and pizza dough and used broccoli, red peppers, onion, mozzarella cheese and a sprinkle of oregano.  Fabulous! Thanks for a great idea!

This was good! I made it with tomatoes and artichokes on a thin mama mary's crust. I think it's important to use flavorful ingredients so i had lemon pepper humus and added some red pepper flakes and italian seasoning. Yum!

I hate regular pizza... mostly because of the sauce, but I LOVED THIS.  We made the Smoky Chipotle Hummus recipe from this site.  Used Mozerella cheese.  Tossed all the veg (red pepper, broccoli, mushrooms, spinach) in olive oil and minced garlic.  Grilled on the George foreman and put on pizza.  Used Pizza Dough I from this site as well.  IT WAS AMAZING!

I reduced the amount of vegetables by about 1/2 cup.  This was very good and I'll make it again.

I really really really had my doubts, but I'm glad I went for it.  I had some garlic hummus I wanted to try with this recipe, and it worked out so well.  It's a unique spin on pizza, and although it won't replace my tomato-based pizzas, this will definitely go into rotation.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavors didn't work for me.  I like hummus & fresh veggies, but the combination wasn't what I expected.

I took the idea and altered it a bit. I used fresh hummus from the local gyro restaurant. I added grilled chicken pieces, roma tomatoes, red bell pepper, monterrey jack cheese, and sprinkled a pizza seasoning on top. OH MY, was it tasty! My husband devoured every last bite of the pizza; there were NO left overs. I can't wait to make this for friends! Thanks for the idea!
