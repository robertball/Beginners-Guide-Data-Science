Very pleased with this, extremely easy and quick to prepare. I made 2 pork chops but used the proportions for the sauce as directed for 4 pork chops,  really happy with the way they turned out!

This was so good. I loved it. I used a spicy mustard to give it more kick. Will definitely use this again

These were great!!  My pork chops were thin and bone in so they took no where near 45 minutes.  The whole family loved them.  Thanks for the easy awesome recipe!

I recently had surgery, but my family still wants me to fix dinner for them.  This recipe was SO easy, SO quick to prepare, and SO delicious.  Definitely a recipe for someone who doesn't want to be on her feet long in the kitchen!

A tasty and easy to prepare recipe. After reading some other reviews, I halved the amount of pepper. As well, while the pork was cooking, I dry roasted [in a frying pan] 1/4 cup of chopped pecans and sprinkled them over the chops before the pouring sauce. Great flavour and texture addition.

This was excellent! I made using chicken breasts and baked it at 350 for 35-40 minutes.  I suggest making extra sauce to drizzle over veggies and rice!

Loved this recipe, so easy, but so good.  My husband had already told me twice how good it was before I had my 1st bite!  will be trying this again soon with a pork tenderloin.   thanks so much!

So I didn't have dijon, so I mixed mustard, mayo, and honey with some spices, and it was amazing! I also cooked it on the stove top with a lid on the skillet. So changed it up quite a bit. I also added onion to it. This turned out great doing it this way. And the apartment smells awesome! Good stuff. Try it as directed, then try what I did. It's fun playing with recipes :D

I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time I followed it pretty closely except I didn't use black pepper (I hate the flavor) and I used French's Chardonnay Dijon mustard.  The chops had a flowery smell, but tasted really good.

The second time I changed things up and used about 1/6 cup of honey and then a little more than 1/3 cup that was a mix of one part Dijon mustard, 1 part spicy brown mustard, and 2 parts honey mustard with just a splash of apple cider vinegar.  I had 6 chops and cooked them for 45 mins at 450.  I think I could reduce the cooking time next time since they were thin chops.  This mixture worked much better for me and my husband enjoyed it even more when he had it for lunch.  In fact, he told me his co-worker told him how good the pork smelled.

Prepared exactly as described in the recipe.  The glaze was a good flavor, but the pork chops were very very tough and the glaze/topping became very runny so most of the flavorful glaze just dripped off into the dish.   Not impressed at all.  It was very easy to prepare, but I will not be making it again.

Five stars for flavor, but only three for the inaccurate method. I baked three average-sized boneless pork loin chops for 40 minutes - not even the 45 minutes as stated - and they were overcooked and dry. I would try the recipe again but bake for far less time. Also, they would benefit from a sprinkling of breadcrumbs over top for added texture.

I made this for my 11-year-old grandson tonight. When he asked, "What's for dinner?" and I said, "Pork chops," he groaned, "I don't like pork chops." I asked him to just try one bite to make me happy and because he's a real sweetie, he did. Ate it all and went back for seconds. I made it exactly according to the recipe, but doubled it to leave leftovers for the rest of the family. This is delicious and so easy it's almost embarrassing to be complemented for being a good cook for making them. I'll be making these often, probably by request from Matthew!

Wasn't wild about this. I doubled the recipe as I wanted extra sauce for rice. It was way to peppery!! I will try next time with only half the pepper. The pork chops were tender though.

This recipe was great. I added a tsp of curry powder and 1/2 tsp of Turmeric. Came out excellent! Might want to change the cooking time from 45 minutes to 30.

I made this according to the recipe except doubled the sauce recipe to have extra. Hubby loved it! Served with roasted broccoli and risotto. Super fast and very goo! Will be making again. Possibly less honey but excellent as stated.

I halved the recipe and  made it exactly like listed . I  probably should have not  cooked it as long as the meat wasn't very tender. If I make it again, I will double the sauce.

Pretty good.  Kids ate it.  Made with mixed vegetables and a rice "packet"  Maybe mashed potatoes would be good with it too.

Simple. Tasty. Family really liked it, so will add to rotation for pork. I used brown mustard. I also used thin chops so that cut the cook time by half.

Needed something easy and different. I didn't have enough honey so I added in some brown sugar. Wow! He hates my cooking but requested this once a week!

Just wasn't impressive but wasn't horrible either. Its just honey mustard poured over pork and baked.. didn't seem like a glaze. Just honey mustard sauce. Probably won't make again but if you really don't know how to cook and need something extremely easy, this will do the job. I just wouldn't expect amazement or anyone raving about deliciousness.

These were amazing!!! I read the reviews before making. I knew 1 teaspoon of pepper would be way too much for us so I only used 1/4 teaspoon. I also only made 2 bone-in chops (close to an inch thick) so halved the sauce and didn’t need anymore than I made. I baked at 350 for 30 minutes and then turned the broiler on for 3 minutes. They were cooked perfectly!!! So easy and absolutely delicious!!! I will definitely make them again!!!

Very good.  Made as written.  Only variation was to reduce pepper by half.  My family liked it and we will make it again.  The trick is not overcooking the pork.

it was really good. Double or tiple the sauce and be sure to season the pork chop (salt, pepper garlic or something like that) before cooking. Will definitely make this again.

Made these last night and they were oh so good! I used 2 porkchops though and made enough sauce for 4 since the chops were on the thicker side and I wanted extra sauce to rub pieces in. 

The only thing I have to say though is the sauce is missing something... I can't quite put my finger on what, but I'm sure in a second make I'll figure it out and then update.

Soooo good. Not dry in the least, though I did cut cooking time to 30 mins for thinner pork chops. One of my favorite pork chop recipes here!

I loved this quick and easy sauce for pork chops! I made a few changes to the cooking method. 
I brined the pork chops for 2 hours before cooking in your standard brining solution (4 cups water to 1/4 cup kosher salt). It really helps keep the pork juicy and holds the flavor in. I used two large bone in pork chops instead of the smaller boneless chops. After brining, I brought The chops to room temperature and patted dry. I then rubbed the pork with salt and pepper. Once in the baking dish and covered with sauce, I covered the dish with foil for even cooking. I let it cook for 45 mins on the middle rack, flipped the chops and uncovered, cooked another 10 mins. Then, I moved the dish to the top rack and turned the broiler on high for about 3 minutes, which caramelized and thickened the sauce. Absolutely fabulous!

This was delicious. It's great just as the recipe is written. I did cook it in an Advantium convection oven. it took 9 minute for any of you that has that oven. It is also fine in a regular oven but 40 minutes is a bit long. I'd say check it at 25 minutes to see how they are.

I did have some fresh herbs so I fine chopped some oregano and sage and added it to the sauce.  Delicious. The recipe though as it's written is absolutely delicious and so simple to make and you don't need any additions. This is a great weeknight recipe if you need to put something together quickly.

This is one of the simplest recipes I've ever made to be so good.  The honey mustard flavor was sensational.  I was reluctant to put a teaspoon of black pepper and of garlic powder in but I follow the directions the first time I make a recipe. The garlic flavor was just right.  That amount of black pepper made me sneeze, my eyes water and burned my mouth but I'm very sensitive to hot pepper "flavor" but my husband who loves hot peppery food found it mild to his taste.   I baked the chops for 30 minutes without checking them and over cooked them.  I'd recommend checking them ever 15 minutes for doneness to be sure.

This was fast, easy and delicious. My only comment is that the cooking time was a bit long for regular chops in a convection oven.

followed this previous review and it was great ---  I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I followed it pretty closely except I didn't use black pepper (I hate the flavor) and I used French's Chardonnay Dijon mustard. The chops had a flowery smell, but tasted really good. The second time I changed things up and used about 1/6 cup of honey and then a little more than 1/3 cup that was a mix of one part Dijon mustard, 1 part spicy brown mustard, and 2 parts honey mustard with just a splash of apple cider vinegar. I had 6 chops and cooked them for 45 mins at 450. I think I could reduce the cooking time next time since they were thin chops. This mixture worked much better for me and my husband enjoyed it even more when he had it for lunch. In fact, he told me his co-worker told him how good the pork smelled. add to my "gravy" I will be making later in the week with meatballs.

I had a family size package of chicken thighs on hand that were still slightly frozen so I added chicken & all ingredients to ziplock and left it in fridge to marinate a few hours while defrosting. Poured it all into 2 large glass baking dishes and baked until 165 internal temp. Delicious! Keeping this simple recipe for future cuts of chicken or pork.

I doubled the recipe to feed my large family, and it was a huge success! Only one extremely pick eater didn’t love it, but the other picky eater came back for seconds and thirds. I think next time I make it I’ll try it with chicken.

Extremely easy. My pork chops were thin so I cooked them at 350 for 40 minutes. 5 minutes less than suggested. They were still a bit over cooked but the sauce was amazing. 
Sides: Steamed green beans with butter, salt, and pepper.

The only complaint I had was that the pepper was overpowering (for me).  I'm going to cut the pepper in half next time.  Except for that I would have given it 5 stars.

Nice and easy recipe but I wasn't crazy about the flavors. Definitely more peppery than sweet.   The glaze sort of fell off the meat and became gooey on the bottom.  Pork Chops are always tricky and I found these rather dry.  My husband, however, thought the flavors were  good!!

Made the recipe with Molasses and Dijon mustard with the same measurements for the spices. Delicious but will make it next time with less pepper and shorten the cooking time as well.

I didn't have honey so I  used maple syrup instead and it turned out great. The sauce was delicious and the chops although over cooked to my taste because of their thinness stayed tender. Easy peasy goodness.

Really easy and tasty recipe.... Makes plenty of sauce if you want a grain or pasta with it.   I have made it several times with bone in or boneless chops.  My only recommendation on boneless chops is you only need to cook for 35 minutes...

Pretty good recipe. I made two pounded chicken breasts in one pan and 5 bone-in pork chops in another pan. Doubled the sauce and it was perfect. As mentioned by others, I added about 2 tbsp brown sugar and then with 15 minutes left to cook, added crushed pecans and sprinkled some bread crumbs. The only complaint I have is that the pan with the chops wound up liquid-y and the topping didn't cook up (was sort of mushy) but it all tasted amazing and I got lots of raves from the family. :)

Made this tonight with thick bone in chops. Delish! Cook time was fine after well browning per directions. Did add more wine and added a splash of 1/2 and 1/2 with an extra pat of butter to sauce while chops were resting and boiled maybe a minute. Served with carrots and applesauce. Quick and easy and hubs happy! Oh, also seasoned chops with S/P, onion and garlic powder and tasted sauce and it was perfect. Saved the little bit of sauce to add to my "gravy" I will be making later in the week with meatballs.

We made this exactly as the recipe called for. I baked the pork chops on tin foil to prevent the chops from sticking. I recommend turning the pork chops over about half way through cooking - this caramelizes the sauce. YUM!

This recipe is just an OK for me. I guess it had too much 'alcohol-taste' for me, or it could just be the dijon mustard since this is the first time I'm cooking with it. Also the taste was bland (except the alcohol taste) the first time I tasted it so I continued baking it for 30 more mins. It was still bland after it finished so I added salt, pepper and 2 tbsp of honey to taste. It turned out a bit better than before, and I will try to repeat this some other time, but it will definitely not go to my go-to recipes.

For my tastes, there's too much pepper. I followed my instincts and cut back, but I should have just used ~1/4 tsp. I only had two pork chops but kept the amount of the sauce as listed. Even then, no real sauce because it sort of baked into the foil-lined pan I used.  Also, the meat seemed a little dry. It smelled good cooking, and the flavor was not bad. Sorry for the less than favorable review.

I found this to be too sweet, maybe I used too much honey?  I baked my pork chops for 20 minutes and then put them under the broiler for about 5 minutes to get the sauce to "stick," which it did not.  This was super easy to make, though!

Pretty good, very easy.  I think perhaps a gravy from the drippings would be lovely.  Hubs isn't the biggest fan of mustard but was able to tolerate this--the honey does cut the mustard flavor pretty well.  I served with potatoes and was going to do salad as well, but we were stuffed with just the meat and potatoes.  thanks for the recipe!

Was very easy and had a good flavor, except way too peppery even with 1/2 the pepper in recipe.  Suggest much less and maybe more garlic next time.

Great!  I added a little hot sauce to the mix.  Would also be great on grilled chops.

Really Good!  I used spicy brown mustard...probably won't do that again, a tad too peppery.  But a definite solid 4 stars!  I also will be lining my pan with foil...the honey burned a bit and was hard to clean up later.

This turned out really good.  I think it greatly depends on the type of mustard you use, though.  I'm betting the reason some of the reviews are negative is because they didn't use good mustard.  I used about 1/8 cup of Gulden's Spicy Brown Mustard and 1/8 cup of Chipotle Mustard.  It turned out slightly spicy and very tasty.  The pork chops were very moist too.   I'll definitely make this again!

I made this last night and we both loved it. Infact, my husband who is a big fan of having meat with somekind of cream soup, said that this was GREAT! Will be making it again! Fast, easy, and very good.
