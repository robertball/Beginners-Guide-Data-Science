Well, I'm a native Texan and have been making pinto beans for years and years and years and thought I would try something new.  Well, my grandma's recipe (which uses tomatoes, bacon, etc.) may have to go on the back burner for awhile because these were fantastic and loved by the entire crowd.  I cooked them for several hours until they were nice and tender and followed the recipe exactly using the green salsa.  This one is definitely a keeper.

I have made this recipe atleast a dozen times and it comes out awesome every time.  My little tweeks: I use canned diced jalapenos to taste and I stick it in the crockpot on low all day.  Also, I always soak the beans the night before. Great beans!

Awesome Recipe. I did change a few things just because that is all I had on hand and they still came out with a really good flavor. I substituted onion for an envelope of onion soup mix and jalapeno for a can of green chilies and used pace picante sauce instead of the green salsa. I also added ketchup to the beans just because that is what my mother in law always does. The beans did take longer than two hours to cook though. I will next time follow the suggestion of another reviewer and soak the beans over night. Thanks for such a great recipe!

We cooked this in a pot for about 8 hours. It was excellent. We cooked the beans at a cook-off and won first place. I strongly recommed this!!

This recipe is awesome!  I didn't have canned chicken broth, so I just reconstitued dry bullion cubes.  I also substitued Pace picante sauce for the green salsa.  It turned out great.  Increasing the garlic doesn't hurt, either.

I am making a huge pot of beans for a family bbq today as I type this review out. Two things this recipe fails to mention is...1 - make sure your beans are not outdated (yes beans do go stale).  And 2 - beans need to be soaked (overnight preferably and depending on the bean) in order to rehydrate them. With both of those said, the older the bean, the longer it takes to cook, that is if it will cook up at all (regardless of soaking). And with soaking, not only does the bean rehydrate (resulting in a shorter cooking time..the 2hours as the recipe suggests for 1 lb of beans), but you also properly clean the beans of any debris and remove the indigestible complex sugars from the outer coating of the beans.  End result - shorter cooking time and hardly any flatulence from the family (which I'm thankful for).  As always, I usually modify a recipe depending on what ingredients it calls for and what I have on hand. I didn't have any pinto beans, so I am using 2 - 1 lb bags of Great Northern beans. I added 1 can of reduced sodium vegetable stock and 1 can of reduced sodium chicken stock. 2 cans of diced green chili. 1 can of rotel tomatoes/green chili. 1 whole onion (diced). 1 tbs of diced garlic. About 1.5 tsp of Mrs Dash. A pinch of salt. A few turns of the pepper grinder. And about 1 tsp of chili powder.  Add water to cover.  Check every so often for water evaporation.  Add extra water as needed. Family loved these beans!!

Very easy and yummy. I mixed everything the night before and let it soak overnight. Served it over brown rice. It was a super easy, low-fat dinner for my family. I left out the jalapenos and used red salsa instead of green. I also added more garlic, pepper, salt and cumin to taste after about an hour of cooking.

Fantastic! I increased the garlic by 1 clove and did not use jalapenos. This was also cooked on low in my crockpot for about 8 hours. Delicious when paired with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site. We had that bread with these beans tonight and it was like comfort food. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband begs for pinto's and cornbread all the time. This one is a winner and by far the best pinto bean recipe I've ever made! I did change it up a little and I will post the way I made it below. I will keep on making it this way for years to come. I have one word for this and that is DELICIOUS! Best served with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site:
http://allrecipes.com/recipe/grandmothers-buttermilk-cornbread/detail.aspx .

Here is the way I made the beans:
1.Rinse pinto beans off making sure all dirt or anything else is removed from them.

2.Place beans in a big bowl covering them with cold water, make sure water is roughly 3-4 inches above beans so they can expand. Soak them in the fridge overnight for approx 12 hours.

3.Drain water in the morning.

4.Place 4 cups hot water in crock pot with the 2 tsp chicken base and 2 tsp beef base.

5.Place garlic, jalapenos, onion,  and cumin powder in the water mixture.

6.Place the beans in the crock pot with the mixture and stir.

7.Top of the bean mixture in the crock pot with two ham hocks placed on either side.

8.Cook on high heat in the crock pot for 2-3 hours.

9.Then place on low heat until supper time, approx 6 hours.

They will come out delicious every time!!

I have a suggestion - for anyone who hates the gassy phenomena that follow a bean dish.  Soak the beans overnight in water - rinse and refill with enough water to cook.  Boil the beans, just to the point that they're at a rolling boil and drain one more time - then proceed with the recipe as written. Wonderful flavor and texture, but no gas :) double win

This is a good, low-fat recipe for beans.  I followed the recipe, except I did soak my beans over night, and I did add a lot of water.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because we just prefer our beans cooked with meat (sausage, bacon or ham bone..not so low-fat!).

I left out the jalapeno, being the wimp that I am. Glad, too, since this has a bite anyway. Uh...the beans were still a tad "crunchy" & I cooked 'em 2 1/2 hours. (Maybe you are supposed to cover these with a lid?!?) I would advise to use a slow cooker or use a lid or cook longer. I also added a few tablespoons of bacon bits. These would be very good if you cook them until soft.

I love this recipe, it makes perfect pinto beans every time!  I mix the finished product up with cooked rice, 4 cups of cheddar cheese and make bulk bean and rice burritos for the freezer.  Perfect for an easy lunch, and the beans have just the right flavor.  Thanks!

This is sooooo yummy! After being raised on traditional southern-style pintos, the southwestern additions are a delicious change. And I love that there's no pork required...this recipe is very healthy, but in NO WAY lacking in flavor or richness. With a pot of collards, a side of cornbread and a pitcher of sweet tea, the longing for a trip to my southern-belle Grandma's kitchen is satisfied! I've made these on the stove as well as in a slow-cooker, and both ways are great. I like to add a little garlic salt at the end, too. I read that adding the salt while cooking will result in tougher beans, so I'm always careful to add it after they are fully cooked and have reached the texture I'm looking for. And either green or red salsa works. I always double this recipe and my hubby gladly eats the leftovers for days! Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Fooddude!

Update: For those having a hard time getting these beans to cook all the way. Add the salsa and any salt the last 30 minutes of cooking. The acid and salt in the salsa slows and halts the cooking process.Original:These were very good although they took awhile to cook. I used Green Taco Sauce because that is what I had. Next time I will get some smoked salt to add to them.

I've made this recipe MANY times. I followed the recipe as written. It's great! I like my food spicy, so I use 3 jalapenos! Garnish with some cilantro on top ;) It's good. By the way, you should try pork skins with these beans. Just use the pork skins as "tortilla chips" by scooping up some beans. It tastes so good. The whole combo is absolutely delicious. Try it out at least once :)

Today is the 4th of July and I tried these beans.  From now on, it'll become annual fireworks fare for us.  Not that the beans are firecracker hot.  They're just so good!  To the pound of soaked-overnight beans, I added 32 ounces of water and 2 tsp. of Beef flavor Better Than Bouillon (comes in a jar) and 2 tsp. of Chicken flavor Better Than Bouillon. Also used extra cumin and garlic, an extra onion, and lots of freshly ground black pepper. The beans were perfect after 5 or 6 hours in the crockpot.  At the end of cooking time, I was going to add a can of diced tomatoes and chili powder, as suggested by other reviewers, along with the green salsa. But after one big taste of the beans, I couldn't take time out to finish those steps.  The beans are absolutely delish, and no salt was necessary after adding the Bouillon. My husband and I had some for a mid-afternoon snack, and now I have more beans soaking for tomorrow. BTW, I did add 2-3 slices of bacon to the beans while cooking.  3 MONTHS LATER:  I've made these beans so often now that I can do it in my sleep. As stated above, I've used bacon for flavor, but I now sometimes use meaty hamhocks. When I couldn't find hamhocks, I had the butcher cut up a nice ham so that I could use the bone and big chunks of ham.  I do add tomato sometimes -- good with or without.  I could live on these beans!

**Service-y Update** - Cooking time will vary based on how relatively fresh your beans are - older/longer. There's no way to really tell except to buy beans right before you're making them to up your chances of getting more recently dried beans.  These are fantastic, I wish I had a 4.75 rating option, only because you can make these just *that* much better by tossing a couple of slices of bacon in the pot while cooking.

We make these often for refried bean dip (SO inexpensive - and better than canned, by far). Just toss beans (bacon and all + more jalapeno for extra spice) into the food processor and process with small amounts of liquid & salt to taste until you reach the right texture & serve with tortilla chips.

I had to add salt at the end of cooking to enhance flavors.  I also added more cumin and jalapenos than the recipe called for.  Would also be good with some canned adobo peppers.  I would say a good starting recipe but needs modifications.  I made in the slow cooker on low 8 hours after soaking overnight.

Awesome recipe! Growing up, we always had a "beans and cornbread" night at our house. Now that I have a family of my own, I decided to continue the tradition. I never got the original recipe from my mom, but this recipe tastes exactly the same. Thank you very much! 
By the way, the BEST cornbread recipe I have found is Nicole Callen's, "Buttery Corn Bread" recipe, here on Allrecipes

Great starter recipe. I stuck to the recipe, however, I added green pepper and red salsa. I also added cooked rice. This recipe it easy to tweak to your taste.

I soaked my beans overnight and used vegetable broth instead of chicken, but otherwise followed the directions. They were wonderful and my house smelled great when they were cooking!

These are so flavorful! I soaked my beans for a couple hours first though. I sauteed my onions and pepper in my pressure cooker, then added everything else. In the pressure cooker, it only took maybe ten minutes to cook.

You cannot go wrong with this recipe! It's cheap, too ... I figured out that it's a little over $3 for me to make this, and it feeds our family of five dinner (with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread and a salad), and there are usually enough leftover for my husband to take for lunch. The only changes I make are doubling the cumin and using vegetable (or "vegetarian chicken flavored") broth instead of chicken. This is a great, simple, CHEAP dinner!

The first time I made this, I only gave it 2 stars. The beans were still too firm after cooking 1/2 hr. longer than suggested. I was in a big hurry the other night, so it occured to try it again with canned plain pinto beans.
They turned out really good. I will be adding this to my recipe file. Thanks!

I made these beans for Christmas Eve dinner and they are quite possibly the best beans I have ever made or eaten. I followed the recipe exactly except that I cooked them in my crock pot for about nine hours. They were perfect. My food critic husband (former chef/cook) thought they were delicious too. Thanks for sharing this recipe Terry.

My hispanic husband says this is as good as his mom used to make.  We love this recipe and eat it all the time now.  Who needs to buy canned beans when these are so easy.

I didn't have green salsa, so I used the red and I think it turned out fantastic!!! I soaked the beans overnight and the 2 hour cooking time was spot on. Because I'm from Wisconsin, instead of adding water to keep the beans moist, I used beer!!! I froze what I didn't eat for later use!!! Great recipe!!

Very good beans!  I used canned chopped jalapenos in lieu of fresh.  I subbed "Rotel" type tomatoes and chiles in lieu of the green salsa.  I put everything in the slow cooker and cooked on high for 6 hours.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I really enjoyed these beans, but I doubled the recipe and they started to dry out really quick, so I added a can of red enchilada sauce and a can of diced green chilis. I also used a can of pace instead of the green salsa.. My husband loved them. They were too spicy for the kids. I loved them. My picky extended family hardly touched them so we had nearly two pounds of beans left after our family night. Doesn't hurt my feelings though, they hardly eat anything. I like that this is different and delicious. I will make them again (on a much smaller scale).

These were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a chunk of salt pork to the beans while they were cooking. I cooked it all in the slow cooker on high for 6....and they were great! Even better the next day after cooking for another 4. Would do these again.....exactly the same.

This is sooo good and very simple. I cooked it in the crock pot and started w/ boiling water poured in it from the stove to give it a jump start, then put in chicken boullion cubes instead of broth. Cooked them on high for 3 hours and then on low for about 2 hours approximately. They were so good I ate some b4 they were quite cooked and I didn't care, they were so yummy. I used red salsa and only half of a jalapeno for fear of it being too spicy. I think I could have added the entire jalapeno, though. A definate keeper.

I boiled the beans for two minutes and then soaked them for an hour before proceeding with the recipe.  Although I had a ham hock, which I generally like in beans, I decided to make them as written.  Unable to find green salsa, I had to use red.  With the chicken broth that I fortified with a teaspoon of Penzey's soup base, I think that the flavor of the ham hock was not needed.  The seasonings were lacking, even though I used a HUGE jalapeno.  Reheated the next day, served with brown rice and topped with salsa, we enjoyed them much more.

The recipe is certainly a home run as shown. I followed a previous reviewer's crockpot method. I also veganized the recipe substituting low-sodium vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and -- just to simplify -- substituted about 5 pureed tomatillos for the green salsa. Oh, and added some chipotles for heat. An absolute keeper.

Great flavor in this recipe. I think my beans were too old so some ended up crunchy. I'll make this again and maybe try to make refries out of it.

I am a Texan and this is, without a doubt, the BEST ever!!!  I grew up on  beans and consider myself an expert, but this recipe is equiv. to our high end recipes here in Houston...i think the chick.broth made the difference; I used a red chunky black bean/corn salsa and a large ham hock......also added 5-6 pieces of crisp bacon with a dollup of b.grease...That's the lagniappe, cha!

I changed the servings to 8, since I didnt want a lot of leftovers! I am giving this 5 stars for the basic recipe, altho I only use my own homemade both and my experience with beans has led me to always pre-soak overnight in the frig, draining/changing the waters many times. I finished the overnight soak this a.m, and put them in the slowcooker with strained, clear homemade hamhock/garlic/onion/celery/carrot broth (I fed the disintegrated hocks and veggies to our wild creatures outdoors). In this broth I put the soaked beans and 6 cloves of raw garlic, cooked for 8 HOURS on low, before I added roasted chicken and ham steak pieces, 1 can of green chilis, and tasted for salt and other spices. I then added (to suit me) 1 cube of chicken bullion, no salt or pepper, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1 teaspoon of cumin and turned the slowcooker off. It was ready to eat in about 1/2 hour. YUMMY! Here is the secret to beans: NEVER ADD SALT (bullion, in this case) UNTIL YOU ARE DONE OR NEARLY DONE COOKING. Salt added early will make the beans tough. Also, I have never in my life seen pinto beans cook in 2 hours, how on earth could this happen, especially without soaking? Happy eating, this was a great base recipe!

I've searched and searched for a basic, reliable bean recipe like my grandmother used to make and I finally found it here! I wasn't sure about the green salsa but had some on hand (not too hard to find in Texas) and decided to give this a shot. The green salsa is very subtle and you don't really notice it specifically, but it adds a depth of flavor that really works. I did add a few pieces of bacon which I thought added a nice little boost of flavor that I'll keep.

Per some reviews, I added a couple slices of chopped bacon.  I cooked these beans for a long time (at least 6 hours after they had soaked all night) and waited until the end to add the salsa verde.  I tasted the beans prior to adding the salsa and thought they were DELICIOUS.  After adding the salsa I didn't like them quite as much; personal taste I guess.  But I will definately make these again without the salsa.  Thanks for a tasty, easy, cheap recipe!  You can't go wrong with a good ol' pot of beans.

I have made this recipe twice, both times everybody loved them.  I think the green sauce in combination with the chicken broth, does the trick. Thanks for a great recipe. UPDATE:  Of course I have made these again, left out the jalapeno since I have a relative that "doesn't do hot stuff", and the beans still received raves from my guests.  Thanks again

Best beans I've ever had!  What a great healthy and flavorful pinto bean recipe.  They were even better the next day.  Please soak your beans over night.  I've read some reviews saying their beans were crunchy.  You must soak them overnight or follow the quick soak method on the bag.  I made my own red salsa and added that to the beans instead of the green.  Really good would love to see what they taste like as refried beans.  Try this one!

Very much like the one's I've made for years.  These had a special kick with the green salsa.  The ingredients were balanced quite well.  Not too mild, not too hot.  A great standard for those who love pinto beans!

Great recipe, needed a pot of beans and found it! I needed a pot of good beans to go with deep pitted meat and this is the perfect recipe to side dish with the meat. I did double the recipe and added a smoked ham hock for smoke flavoring! But I also made a batch a recipe shows and they are great pot of beans as a quick pot or even slow cooking! Tell your friends, great job Terry!!!

Absolutely awesome!  Definitely my new go-to recipe for beans!

YOU HAVE TO SOAK THE BEANS, EITHER OVER NIGHT OR ALL DAY!!  Then, discard the soaking water and use fresh for cooking.  Really cuts down on the flatulance.

I usually do these in my pressure cooker, for 28 minutes.

Not being from the south I normally hate pintos but after making these I absolutely love them. These are the best beans EVER! I use whatever broth I have on hand, chicken or beef and sometimes I use buillon. I've used red salsa.With or without jalepeno. Its just great. Soak the beans overnight and throw it all inthe crockpot in the morning. Let it cook all day. Great no fuss dinner and the house smells amazing while they are cooking!

Very good. Only ingredient change was to substitute a Tabasco pepper since I had them in the garden. Soaked beans overnight and put all ingredients in slow cooker. High for about 8 hr and then low until time to serve. Easy and inexpensive.

This was a very tasty, filling, healthy meal! I paired this up with brown rice and it was very good. Seasonings were good, did not have to add the jalepeno since we like our beans mild. Hubby added lots of cheese to his but that is because he loves cheese on everthing! Will make again.

I know I am a little hard on this recipe. But I grew up in Dove Creek CO.  The pinto bean capital of the world.  And we eat some beans.  First I would like to comment on cooking beans, aside from the recipe.  Beans vary greatly on how well they will cook by how old they are and by the altitude they are cooked at.  At sea level 2 hours in a pot with fresh beans might get it done.  I have seen my mother try to cook beans over a campfire, in a covered pot, while on a fishing trip at about 12,000 feet, and she cooked them all day and all they did was swell up and turn purple.  And they were fresh beans.  Essential in the cooking of Pinto's as far as I am concerned is a pressure cooker.  Of course I live at 7,200 ft myself.  clean the beans good and put them in the pressure cooker, with enough good water to almost fill the cooker (the beans swell a lot)  usually don't cook up more than a couple of cups of beans unless you have a big pressure cooker, bring it up to full pressure and turn off the fire, and let them sit for about an hour until the pressure is all bled off.  They are ready to use in about any application you want to use them in.  This recipe to me was a little complicated to put together and a fair amount short on flavor.  I have recipes for beans all the way from the basic (pressure cooker full of beans with a smoked ham hock) to full blown bean soup with all the complexity of this recipe but with much more down home flavor.  contact me and I can set you up with any

Go with some of the other suggestions.  I made the mistake of explicitly following the recipe and now I have beans in the freezer that I have NO motivation to eat.  I always forget to salt pintos while they are cooking and if you don't they are next to impossible to make them taste anything other than bland...even the spices didn't help.

These were delicious! I read over all the reviews and made some additions. I did everything that was in the original recipe; it was just enhanced. I rinsed and soaked the beans overnight. I added 2 pieces of turkey bacon and a little liquid smoke and chili powder. I did need to add some water during cooking. I added a can of Rotel tomatoes and chilis towards the end of cooking along with some cilantro. It tasted a lot like the chara beans I get at Tex/Mex restaurants that I love!

Delicious!

Forget chili this is better.  Good thing I didn't add some cayenne pepper (I was tempted).  Spicy!

Great with basmati rice on the side.  This one is definitely a keeper.  Oh... by the way... I used red salsa as well.

This was a wonderful dish. Easy to put together and delicious. 
Because I forgot to soak my beans the night before, I quickly cooked them in my Instant Pot pressure cooker for 20 minutes to get them started. Once finished, I released the pressure, added the other ingredients and finished cooking them in the slow cooker mode till done. I served them with cornbread and it was a wonderful supper. 

This recipe makes a lot of beans. More than what my husband and I eat, so I saved the rest for later in the week, mashed them and fried them for the best re-fried beans we have ever had. Used them on top of nachos with ground beef, seasonings, jalapenos, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese and LOTS of chips. It made a second great supper! 

I will be making these beans again!

These taste amazing! Two hours using dry beans didn't work for me though. I soaked them overnight first. I also tried gently boiling them on the stovetop for 30 minutes then throwing them in the slow cooker on high for several hours and they turned out awesome too. I'm in Texas but from the north, so I was clueless about pinto beans! But I served this recipe at a party and everyone loved it! Whew...saved the day!

These pintos were delicious tasting and had a nice kick! The only recommendation would be to soak the beans overnight and allow several more hours for cooking!

This is a very good SIDE dish bean recipe. As one reviewer said, "it's good without the addition of any meat." I totally agree. I made it exactly as written with no changes. I did however soak the beans for about 2 hours first, then rinsed and proceeded. They were very good. I will most certainly make again.

took longer to cook than the recipe stated.  I thought the rule was NO salt while cooking beans.  Seemed that was the long cooking time.  Next time I will use water with all the seasonings.  Used them in chili the next day and they finally softened.

My husband is a pinto bean connoisseur, which made this unusual recipe a risky little game.  He said he prefers the way I usually cook them, but he did like this dish.  I thought these beans were very, very good, but I am willing to eat my pinto beans in more than one, linear way :)

These were just ok for my family. Being from central texas, I always love trying Texas recipes. I followed all directions, no changes, and these were pretty bland. Recipe looks fool proof.  I love all the ingredients. I will use this as a base next time, and play around with it more.

This was super yummy.  I basically cooked it exactly as directed except I added chicken sausage at the beginning.  It took way longer to cook though.  More like 4 hours.

I haven't tried this yet but I hope to, soon. Two questions: what is the size of a serving--not "1/8th of a recipe," but how many ounces or cups? I can't translate a "pound of beans" into cooked cups. Second, could I substitute mayocopa beans? I'm looking for recipes for this strange cross between pinto & kidney beans.

Awesome! We loved this recipe!    I put this in the crockpot before leaving for work.  I'll double the liquid when I make it next time.  I also put a piece of pork in with it.

I enjoyed these beans...I added four smoked ham hocks to the pot for flavor and the teeny bit of meat that they lend. I also added chili powder and cumin to enhance the smokieness. Add this reduced and beans cooked the sauce was wonder and rich. I did soak my pintos overnight! Thanks for a yummy recipe to serve with cornbread!

A good, solid bean dish. Not spectacular but easy to make, good taste and better for you than a lot of fat laden side dishes. If your main dish is going to be the focus, this might be the perfect dish to accompany it.

Much tastier than canned beans.  I soaked beans overnight first, then rinsed and drained.  Cooked at high for 4 hours, then low for 3.  Very easy to prepare.

This ended up more like Chili beans.  I should have read the ingredients better before selecting this one.  I was looking for a tradional Pino Bean ( to go with cornbread) type.  The family liked this pretty good, it just wasn't for me.

I don't care for beans, but my boyfriend loves them. So I decided to use my pinto beans I bought months ago. I never made them before so I thought I'd look up a recipe and I got a good idea on how to make mine with a little bit of alterations. I used a chicken bullion cube, onion, a jalapeno, cumin, salt, garlic powder, some creole seasoning, and a can of chipotle salsa. These are pretty spicy and good! I do love almost anything spicy =9

I made these in the crockpot.  They were good, but they weren't nearly as spicy as I was expecting.  I had to add a lot of cayenne, salt and pepper to get it the way I wanted it.

I had to add quite a bit of water to these and they took about 3 hours to cook. They were pretty tasteless when they were done, and I ended up adding more cumin and Mexican seasoning to them before serving. Thanks for the post, but I'll try something else next time.

The best Pinto Beans ever! We really liked this recipe. Please soak your beans! I noticed the low ratings were all complaints of the beans being crunchy. Also, I cooked the beans for 3 hours. You can find the green salsa (ina can) in the mexican section of your grocery store next to the canned jalepeno. Thank you for this great recipe!

Great recipe-added fresh cilantro, olive oil, a 1/4 c. of chopped (jarred, roasted) red bell pepper, less jalapeno, dash of chili powder and more garlic. Served w/sour cream & cornbread..delicious!

I really don't like to leave one star reviews, but there was just no way around it with this one.  While it was cooking the aroma was just AWFUL!  But, I went ahead and gave it a shot.  In all honesty, the taste was worse than the smell. They were SO BLAND!  ....plain, plain, plain!  I really can't say anything good about this recipe.  I have removed it from my recipe box and will not be having it again.

These were pretty good but felt they lacked a something.  I added some hamhocks to mine and found them much more flavorful.  Would make again with the ham of course.

My husband actually makes this quite often. He uses red salsa and not green and usually uses a lot of water as he usually throws this in the crock pot all day or overnight. This is great paired with cornbread. Thanks!

My boyfriend, who is Mexican and loves beans, and I couldn't even eat these. The appearance was thoroughly unappealing, the aroma less than appetizing, and then the flavor was just not there at all, for either of us. Sorry.

This is so easy!  I added 3/4 teaspoon of salt, combined everything in the crock pot at about 9 AM and had a great, easy side dish by 6 PM.

This is a delicious recipe, so much so that I'm writing this short review to give it five stars for simplicity, taste, convenience and healthiness. I didn't have chicken broth so I used dried bullion in water and din't have the salsa to add and it came out fantastic! I'm making it again for the 4th of July to have with BBQ stuff. I highly recommend!

Thank you, Fooddude! These beans aren't much to look at, but they are delicious! I used "no-chicken" broth to keep them vegetarian/vegan. I added more cumin because I love it and added more tomatillo salsa, because there's no such thing as too much :) Soaked my beans overnight and cooked for 2+ hours. So, so hearty and yummy. I burned my tongue because I couldn't stop "sampling" them from the pot.

Good, but I should have followed my instinct and put it in the slow cooker. 4 1/2 hours of cooking, and the beans were edible, but not as done as I would like. Good flavor. I did use home canned salsa, and added some smoked andouille sausage.

Fantastic beans.  I read a number of the reviews and followed Jessica's slow cooker method.  Replaced jalapeno with serrano pepper.    Added ham hock (watch for bones near bottom of pot). Everyone liked them. No leftovers.  Best beans yet!

This is fantastic!  I've been sharing it (the recipe and the beans) to everyone who'll try it :).  My husband and son are over the moon for these, which is surprising since my son is so picky about new foods.  I've made it twice in 10 days, haha!  It's almost gone already...

Very good.  I made this for dinner tonight with a pan of cornbread!  Yum!  Only made 2 changes... I added red salsa instead of green (didn't have any) also added a ham hock (I'm from the South... that's what we do)!  Since I used the hock I used regular water instead of chicken stock.  I will totally make this again!

Pretty good. Took closer to 3 hour to get the beans closer to what I expect for tenderness. Don't take the "stir often" lightly, or your beans will stick and turn to mush.

This was fantastic, though I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used canned pinto beans and just combined the ingredients and heated them for 15-20 minutes to make a soup. The beans tasted so buttery and the spices added just enough heat. A healthy and hearty dish!

While I cannot rate this based on the cooking method of the beans I can rate on flavor. I used rinsed and drained canned pintos because I didn't trust the 2 hour cooking time for the beans. I invited neighbors for a spontaneous taco dinner and only had a few hours to prepare! I had everything else on hand...even the green salsa. So, of course the beans were tender but the dish lacked flavor. I let everything simmer for about 45 minutes and then sampled it. Dull, flat. After adding more of everything and some ancho chili powder, salt, more green salsa....and a spritz of fresh lime at the table, I was happy.

Sorry, I am a bean lover, but I did not care for these much at all. I soaked the beans for about 8 hours, but even with cooking them for quite a long time, they just weren't as tender as I like them. The flavor was definitely lacking. Finally, after eating several less than appealing bowls, I put them in the blender, added a bunch of jalapenos and some salt, and made some great refried beans out of them.

quick and easy beans.  Put them in the crock pot.  I am from south Texas and missed the depth of flavor the bacon adds to a pot of beans.  Will do again but with a couple of pieces of bacon.  Used left overs to make an AWESOME bean dip!

Good stuff! I omitted the jalapeno pepper and used a Serrano pepper which I quartered and simmered with the beans. Remove Serrano pepper before serving.

My beans turned out a little bland but I am certain that it was because I added too much water.  I used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of the green salsa and a slice of turkey bacon.  I also used garlic powder, onion powder & flakes, chili powder, & black pepper.

I soaked the beans for about 10 hours before cooking them (draining & rinsing twice).  I cooked them on the stove for 7 hours.  I will definitely try this recipe again but will be sure to reduce the amount of water I add.

For those whose beans were still a little crunchy after cooking -- make sure to soak them for several hours and drain the water once or twice.  Also beans have a shelf life so if they have been in your pantry/cabinet for over a year then it's highly possible that they will not turn out right.

Good flavor, but fell short of my expectations. I did find it sloppy looking with the bean skin goop - I am going to presoak the beans and remove that unattractive goo, maybe it will be more visually appealing. But - like all my reviews, goop or no goop this is KID APPROVED

Unlike most of those on this site, I am a TERRIBLE cook!  However, I followed this recipe exactly, but used a crock pot (also a lazy cook;) and I can't beleive it, but these taste great!  Spicy enough, good consistency, and easy to make.  IF I CAN MAKE THESE TASTE GREAT, YOURS WILL BE FANTASTIC!

A reviewer warns against salting beans until the end of cooking. This is wrong.  Even the soaking water should be salted.  Scroll down to the relevant part of this excellent article

A really good pinto beans recipe.  Don't underestimate the value of the chicken broth.  It definitely adds flavor.  Instead of a fresh jalapeno, I used dried jalapeno flakes - McCormick has them - because it keeps you from accidentally getting any of the pepper on your hands, and you definitely don't want to do that!! I used one tablespoon, but I'd recommend you start out with less so you can "tweak" the heat to your taste.  I also omitted the cumin because I don't care for it.  I'll make these again and again.

his recipe produced delicious results. I didn't add the jalapeno as my kids don't like spicy food and it was still delicious. I mashed some and created refried beans, served in tortillas with rice and cheese and everyone ate every last bite. I cooked in the slow-cooker on low for 8 hours, delish. I will make this again!

This is a ok recipe.  Nothing to get too excited about, but it tasted good.  I doubt I will make it again, mostly because my husband doesn't like beans.  It was mostly just for me.

If you are looking to cut back on things like fat or sodium, this recipe is for you.  It can definetely stand up to traditional bean recipes that are made with bacon, but I have to confess that I added a little salt.  Be sure to read the "PREP INSTRUCTIONS" on your bag of beans as most beans require some type of soaking prior to use.

This was a wonderful twist on an old cold weather standby.  It's got a fabulous flavor w/ just enough bite to make it interesting (& I don't like it too hot!).  Definitely soak overnight and I cooked about 6 hours on high in the crock pot. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This is pretty good for a recipe with no salt in it.  I did do a few things different, I added salt and used homemade chicken stock, left out the jalapeno becasue I didn' t have one.  I think if I made again I would saute the onions, garlic and cumin before adding to the beans and would add more cumin.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars, even though the instructions don't work as specified.   This really must cook for a minimum of three hours and preferably longer.  I added salt pork because in Texas we don't make beans without it.    And instead of using water to keep the beans moist, I used chicken stock.   Other than that, these beans can't be improved on--they are truly great beans.

8 hours on low in the slow cooker and used about 4 cups of better than bullion broth  And just fyi always soak beans overnight.  As a general rule, with beans the longer they soak and/or cook, the less gas there'll be.  And you know what I mean!

Great recipe!  I went the easy route and used canned pinto beans to reduce cooking time to about 25 minutes instead of two hours.  I like my spices kicked up a bit so I went a little heavier on all of the seasonings and loved the result.  I'd also recommend adding a couple shakes of salt.  Delicious!

This is a tasty and healthful way to prepare beans.  It was well seasoned as is but we like things hot so next time I will add more jalapeño.

Nice, but for a more 'Texas' taste, use beef stock I use cubes including one in the soak water, brown sugar and add a little cilantro to the mix. Also, soaking your beans over night greatly improves your cooking time.  I use a crock pot on high for two hours then 6 hours at low, works everytime.

Excellent recipe for pinto beans.  I like mine a tad hot so I used two jalapeno peppers.  I also added one half of a green pepper just because I like them.  I'll make these again.

I was looking for a pinto beans recipe without meat and this was a nice choice. Excellente flavor. I soaked the beans overnight and in the morning added all the ingredientes in the crockpot and let cook on low all day. I added around 3 tsp of liquid smoke for some flavor and it turned out delicious.

I sought out this recipe b/c of it short cooking time. Lesson learned... no short cut for beans. I had to baby sit them b/c of the quick water evaporation. They ended up scorching and flavorless. Cannot find a reason to try to improve will stick with frijoles III from this site.

These were fantastic.  I made a few little changes however, they are as follows:  Used regular chicken broth, 7 oz can of Ortega chilis in lieu of the jalapeno, 1 - 10 oz. can El Paso green enchilada sauce in lieu of the green salsa, couple tablespoons of La Victoria Chunky Jalapeno Hot sauce, about 5 cloves of minced garlic, only had 1/2 of an onion so added a little onion powder, added some coriander, red salsa and 1/2 cube chicken bouillon.
For cooking the beans: Rinsed beans & placed in a large pot.  Poured in the chicken broth, stirred in onion, onion powder, garlic, green enchilada sauce, chunky jalapeno hot sauce, cumin, coriander & cracked black pepper.  Brought to a boil.  Transferred to preheated Crock pot (high) and cooked for 3 hours.  Checked on from time to time as I needed to add water.  At about the 3 hour mark, added Ortega’s, red salsa & 1/2 cube chicken bouillon.  Stirred around & continued to cook for about 1 hour on high.  Then stirred & turned crock pot down to low, cooked 2 - 2 1/2 more hours (got the idea of starting beans and bringing to boil in pot and transferring to crockpot from previous reviewer, great tip, thanks) ~

These were AWESOME!! I gave a four just because so much more water was needed as the beans cooked. And also, the cooking time is atleast double what the recipe says. I will take others advice and soak the beans the night before from now on. I used red salsa because that's what I had on hand (I'm sure green salsa would be just as good though), and also added salt and chili powder. I had to leave out the jalapenos because my husband is a cry baby. The flavor was delicious. Oh yeah, just a note for new cooks like me - rinse the dry beans before you put them in the pot.

This is a good basic recipe that is easily adaptable to whatever substitutes you have on hand. I soaked the beans overnight, drained them, then threw everything in the crockpot on low for several hours. I used garlic and onion powder instead of fresh, red salsa instead of green, and chicken stock base and water instead of low-sodium chicken broth (although this did make it a little too salty). Easy and pretty much fool-proof. Thanks!

Update: Very nice spiced flavor! We really enjoyed! Served with fried chicken and the usual fixin's. I didn't chop the jalepenos (I added an extra one), left them whole, but they got soft and came apart overnight(made for a spicy bite if you got part of the jalepeno!). I let soak overnight in my crockpot, and kept the crockpot on low all night. Beans were really by 12pm, in time for lunch. My FIL really enjoyed, and even my MIL raved about them. I think my SIL was a little jealous, since she has always been the "pot-o-beans" maker in the family. Thanks for helping me get one up on my SIL, tehe! Great recipe! (: Original review: I used this recipe (all spices, salsa, chicken broth) in combination with my usual bean recipe that uses the crockpot & soaks overnight (uses bacon, and more water).  Making for Father's Day for my FIL, he loves a good pot of beans....Will update on taste.

Excellent!  I make these at least twice a month or more.  My family loves them.  The only thing I do different is to add an 8 oz can of spicy tomato sauce, just to suit our taste. UPDATE: I don't soak my beans overnight, I put them in a pan of boiling water, then I let them boil for 10 minutes with a lid on, then I turn off the heat and let them sit for an hour with the lid on.  I then dump them and rinse them and make them.

Thank you for a great recipe!  My husband was completely impressed that I took the time to make real beans, not something out of a can.  I did fry up 3 pieces of bacon and then sauteed the onion and jalapeno in the fat for added flavor.  I used 2 jalapenos and still added some crushed red pepper flakes near the end of cooking to up the heat a little.  I added in the bacon just before serving and they were great.  They were even better the next day!!

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for! Very flavorful and on the spicy side. Like others, I soaked the beans overnight then cooked them in my crock pot for 5 hours on high. So easy! I subbed garlic powder, dehydrated minced onion and canned jalapeno, and added a little salt. I mashed them a few times with my potato masher at the end, just to thicken up the liquid so it would be good over rice. My boyfriend was impressed with this recipe and I will make them many times in the future!

Excellant, Excellant...I Browned a cut up whole chicken on the BBQ grill (seasoned with paprika,thyme and mexican oregano)Then added to the beans while boiling. Makes a wonderful Chicken con carne !! Sprinkle with fresh cilantro and chopped fresh jalepenos or habanero (for the sadist)  Serve wih warm corn tortillas.

These are the best beans I've ever had! I LOVE garlic so I added a whole head and also put in some chopped bacon. I served it with cornbread. The best part about this recipe is the delicious smell coming from the kitchen for hours... we couldn't wait for dinner!

I made a large pot of beans with this recipe (about 3 pounds).  First though I think you should tell everyone to soak beans overnight.  I did use the green salsa but I only had a jar of jalapenos so I used some of that. I also only had the broth cubes so I used about 6 of those with water and minced garlic from the fridg and doubled everything. and yes I added salt too. Has a wonderful flavor. And you might try a can of rotel if you really want hot pintos.

I used my pressure cooker to cook the beans, and used green chili enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  I think I ended up using about 2 c. of the sauce to spice it up a bit.  It was good, not great.  May be better with the salsa instead.

These aren't really my thing, but Husband like them a lot. I used canned pinto beans, and I wasn't really sure what green salsa is so I just used some Pace Lime and Cilantro Salsa instead. I garnished it with a little snipped fresh cilantro. This was a little bit salty, but pretty good. Thanks!

Updating my review... I've now made these beens dozens of times and still love them.  I've used green salsa and red (just depending on what I have at the time).  I've added hot sauce when I didn't have jalapeños.  When I do add jalapeños I've used fresh and canned.  I've also used fresh garden salsa peppers when I've had them.  I do add more like a tablespoon of cumin because I love cumin and I cook in crockpot all day.  Great, easy recipe.

I'm a new Texan, but these were delicious! I didn't have green salsa, so used red, and added a little cooked crumbled bacon, as my neighbor suggested. Wonderful!

I used homemade red salsa I had and did not add the jalapeno or pepper. I prefer really spicy foods and would have liked to try the recipe the way it was intended but my husband wouldnt like me anymore. The beans had a very "healthy" taste to them and just enough kick to make them stand out from just a plain "old fashioned" recipe. The soup part of the recipe was very yummy!

I could never make good pinto beans until I found this recipe.  Soaked them overnight, then drained out all the water and added the chicken broth, chopped onion, minced garlic, cumin, black pepper, and a 7-oz can of salsa verde.  Did not add any salt, didn't need it.  Let it cook all day on the stove at a slow simmer.  Serve with brisket, cole slaw, and corn on the cob.  Leftovers should freeze well.  Thanks for the recipe Terry!

West Virginia Hillbilly with a love of pinto's. I stayed as close to Terry's recipe as I could and was not disappointed in the least. I did add some dried crushed Carolina Reapers, 1/4 tsp, which gave it a heat any true Texan would love. Thank you Terry, you knocked it out of the park.

My husband liked the dish and he is  a tough critic. I did season the beans with salt as well. Yes, I plan to make it again but next time I will soak the pinto beans overnight.

I had been making ham and beans per my mom"s recipe for years, but now I've learned to make Terry's version, I think there will be a  new card in my recipe box.  My son who didn't like his grandmother's version at all ate a full plate of these.

Cooked beans first and then added the rest of the ingredients. Cooked until beans soaked up most of the broth. Members of my family do not like pinto beans , however they liked this. Thanks for a good recipe.

These beans were pretty good.  I did follow the recipe the first time I made it, but since then, I have omitted the salsa.  I am just not a fan of spicy (hot) food and I found it too spicy for me, but I make these beans as part of a heart healthy diet once a week and this recipe works for me!  Thanks for submitting.

I do at least 1/2 day soak, then toss into crockpot on high until dinner time.  Add some cilantro at the end to kick up the flavor. Sometimes I will also add some chipotle powder to give it a smoky flavor. It makes a lot for 2, so the following night, I turn it into chili adding sauteed hamburger and whatever else suits my fancy.

If it makes it easier for other cooks who just kind of toss things in, I used two cups dry of pinto beans that I started soaking the night before, and I used a box of broth. Turned out just right, with extra liquid but not a soup. Awesome recipe. A

I was skeptical, being the southerner and lover of a good pot of beans, but they turned out great!  Really good flavor!  I did have to cook them longer than called for and add salt but, I will make these low fat beans again!

Pretty good! Considering I am the only one who cares for beans in my family, I am excluding my hubby's opinion from my review. While I thought these were tasty, the cook time was a bit off for me. I even soaked my (fresh, brand new) beans overnight - not only to ensure they'd cook in the suggested 2 hour time frame, but also to clean them of any debris and remove any indigestible sugars that contribute to flatulence. I ended up cooking my beans for almost 2 /12 - 3 hours. I had to constantly juggle the heat setting on my stove because my beans were barely simmering on medium-low but bubbling away on medium. I was concerned that all of the liquid would quickly evaporate, even tho I was checking the pot every 10 minutes (and I had to add almost 2 cups water at that). Since I didn't want to be chained to the stove all afternoon, I guess the extra hour had to be the compromise. Cooking hiccup aside, these were mighty tasty and complemented my Tex-Mex pulled pork sandwich nicely. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Terry! :-)

I've lived in Texas and now in Seattle.  No matter what or where you are this is a DELICIOUS and very healthy dish.  We actually just ate it with some toast with cheese on top (we call it cheesy toast) and some green salad.  Yummy!  It really was like a meal in itself. It is affordable if you are trying to make your budget stretch.  I always soak my beans over night, and if you want to avoid the gas that beans can cause, while soaking add 1 to 2 Tablespoons of baking soda.  Then rinse beans before hand cook.  My 1 pound of beans was done in about 40 minutes.  Just a thought.  Enjoy!

This is an excellent dish. I added ground turkey and BBQ sauce. I serve it with millet which makes it thicker.  It is a really great hearty stew and this is my second time making it. We all give it thumbs up.

So, so good.  This was only the second time I've made beans.  Super easy and the family loved them.  I did add 3 or 4 diced chipotle peppers in adobo while it cooked and a handful of chopped cilantro at the   very end!! Delicious!!

These Pinto Beans turned out very good. I had to change it up by using items I had on hand. I soaked my beans overnight and I oven roasted the Jalapeno pepper before chopping. Used Beef Broth. I did not have Chicken Broth, the green salsa or cumin so I used 3 Tablespoons of Fiesta brand Pinto Bean Seasoning and also added some Smithfield smoked Pork Jowl Bacon. Served as a side along with grilled chicken and fresh baked corn bread. Yum! My wife even liked them and she usually does not eat beans.

Easiest bean recipe I've ever made. I followed it to the T. However knowing that I didn't soak over night, I brought the beans to a boil and reduced for 2 hours and reduced again to low for a 1/2 hour. They came out perfectly, they were very flavorful without adding any pork, which I particularly liked because I like to cook without adding additional fat if possible. I will soooo be making this again.

Absolutely wonderful recipe, a definite keeper. My personal changes: 1) did not use the jalapeno as I could not find fresh ones, 2) in place of chicken broth, I covered the beans with 1-inch of water and then added 4 packets of Goya Ham Seasoning Concentrate (or to taste), and 3) I cooked these in a crockpot on high for 5 hours, until beans were soft but were still mostly intact (on low plan for at least 8-10 hours). The ham concentrate with the green salsa really made the beans, though I would not hesitate to use chicken broth if unable to find the Goya product.

Not that spicy at all, it tastes very similar to a regular pot of beans but with a little tang to it. the beans also had to cook a lot longer and they were still slightly crunchy at the end (the microwave before meals seemed to get rid of that though). I think I'll be trying a different recipe next time or sticking to families favorite way of bacon grease and beans

VERY good!  I made the mistake of putting medium salsa into it and it added some fire to it.  Not great for the kiddos but daddy and I love it!  This is hands down, the best recipe for our "beans and cornbread" dinners.

Made recipe 'almost' exactly as written. Used chicken boullion cubes w/water instead of canned broth, doubled the recipe, and made it in the crockpot. I soaked the beans overnight; cooked on low for 8 hours - everyone LOVED THIS!!!

Definately plan on making again. It was extremely salty, probably I used bouillion instead of the chicken broth, no salt needed that's for sure.

This was amazing.  I soaked the beans (4 cups dry) 2lbs overnight rinsed them and then soaked them for another 5 hours. Rinsed again and made recipe as stated (doubled of course) except I didnt have a  jalapeno  pepper, so I just doubled the green salsa.  This was amazing will definately make again!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I make it often.  The cumin and jalapenos really make the flavor delicious.  I never have green salsa, so I just use red.  This recipe is not picky about measurements.

We love this recipe!  My mother was from Texas so I know good pintos.  I didn't have any fresh jalapenos so I used canned. I happened to have some ham so I added a little of that as well.  I didn't pre-soak, cooked them for about an hour on the stove top and because I had to leave, I finished them off in the slow cooker on high and added a little water when I got home.  They are definitely spicy but not overwhelmingly so.  Will definitely make again.

Sorry to disagree with all the excellent reviews, but we thought these were only mediocre.  I followed the recipe and didn't change anything.  Next time I'd be more liberal with the spices, or try a different brand of green salsa to see if that makes the flavor pop any more.

These beans were pretty darn good. I didnt have green salsa, just a bottle of salsa with lime. So thats what I used, and I used extra chicken broth instead of water. It turned out real good. Every one in my family loved them.

I used beef broth instead of chicken, and added chili powder for extra flavor. Soaking overnight helped too.

I soak the dry pintos overnight in water.  In the morning I drain them, then put evertything in the crock pot on LOW all day (9-10 hours).  I usually just use red salsa (bc I always have it on hand) add at least one can of water.

Delicious!  I have tried several pinto bean recipes and this one is the favorite.  I cooked this in a dutch oven on the stovetop.  I added about a teaspoon of salt b/c of other reviews and 2 slices of bacon cut into 1" pieces.  For my children I only used 1/2 Jalapeno.  Also, to keep the flavor I added extra chicken broth instead of water as needed.  Yummy!!

Not what I expected at all after reading all the great reviews. I followed recipe to the letter. I will heed another reviewer's advice and turn the rest into refried beans so they're not a total waste.

I soaked the beans briefly and made them in the crock pot. I didn't have any green salsa so I just chopped up some tomatoes and threw them in. These beans turned out good.

I love these beans! I make them every couple weeks. I leave out the jalapeno because it's a little hot for my daughter.

This is a great basic bean recipe. I am "into" heirloom beans and am looking for simple recipes. In addition to making this with pinto beans, I have made it with Yellow Indian Woman heirloom beans. Great. Next I'll try it with Yellow Eye.

Followed directions on package of beans but took longer than 2 hours. Let simmer in crock 4-5 hours the night before and then again all day for 8-9 hours more. They tasted fine, nothing to rave about though. We used them in "Chipotle" style burritos. My kids loved them like this, but just as a rice and beans dish would have been too bland for my family. Needed more kick.

These beans rock!!!  I didn't have jalapenos so I used green peppers and ground chipotle.  I also added bacon like a few of the reviews recommended.  This will be my go to reciepe for pinto beans from now on.

I followed this recipe to a tee after soaking over night. The only thing I did different was remove the seeds from the jalapeno. They were very good and took about 2 1/2 hours to cook. I probably added about 2-3 cups of water during the cooking time.  Next time I'm going to add the whole 7oz can of green salsa and leave the seeds in the pepper and try them in the slow cooker. They were not as spicy as I thought they would be. My 11 year old granddaughter loved them. We served them over rice.

My husband kept going on and on about how good these smelled the whole time they were cooking.  He kept asking when theyd be done.  He really liked them once they were done but said theyd be even better with a little italian sausage or ham.  I will definately make them again and try it with the meat.

Great side dish recipe.  I served them with tamales and homemade spanish rice.  I followed others' suggestions and used canned jalapenos and cooked the beans in my crock pot on low.  Had a great kick without being too hot.  Will definitely make again!

I gave this 4 star, but 5 star on following modifications. I'd stick with normal chicken broth. Was not salty enough, was lacking flavor, but adding regular chicken broth  and some garlic powder about a t. brang out the flavors and really tickled the taste buds. I was scared to add garlic powder at first cuz was figuring with the low sodium chicken broth was low sodium for a reason, and it would make it too salty, but honestly not sure why it's low sodium, a little more saltiness is the final touch in this pinto bean recipe.

Made these without the jalapenos, still quite tasty.  Left the salsa on the side for people to add as desired. My beans soaked overnight and they still required a long cook time.  Will make them again! Thanks!

I was hesitant to add all these ingredients, but I gave it a whirl and they turned out great. I felt it needed  some salt and I made them in a crock pot on high for 3 hours rather than on the stovetop , but overall they had a nice kick to them and I'll definitely make these again!

These were just okay for us. The things that I changed were that I soaked the beans overnight and I cooked them in a crockpot due to time constraints. Mainly, I think our rating was just about personal preference.  We just prefer that our beans be cooked with ham in them they come out with a taste that is better to us.  Thanks for the recipe we love things spicy & might try again with the addition of some ham.

I made these for my husband who had never had pinto beans as the main dish before and is a big meat eater. HE LOVED THEM! When I was a kid, my Texan step dad showed my mom how to make beans but hers were always fairly bland. This recipe is so tasty. Yummmm!

I have made this several times with a few modifications of my own. I first do a quick soak on the beans by sorting and then covering the beans with water, bing to a boil and cook 1 hour.  Then turn off the heat and let stand covered for another hour. Drain off the water and rinse beans.  I then add the ingredients shown in the recipe with the following modifications. I use 5 chicken broth cubes and 5 cups of water instead of the sodium free broth. I also add a couple of ham hocks for flavor. I cook the beans all day long on simmer.  I serve with Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread found on this site.

I had high expectations for these beans after reading the reviews but I was slightly disappointed. I replaced some of the chicken stock with beer and that added a nice bitter-sweetness. But I also had to add a can of tomato paste, extra garlic, paprika, chile powder and extra cumin, salt and pepper. I definitely should have soaked the beans overnight because I cooked them for 4 hours and they were still a bit firm. I had to keep adding water to prevent them from drying out and I think that just diluted the spices too much and made it bland. I also threw in about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to add more richness. I think if I make this recipe again I would use chicken stock instead of water during the cooking process or just put everything into the slow-cooker and set it on low for about 8 hours. It was a bit of a pain to keep going back to the stove to add water,stir and taste the beans. I will give this one another try, maybe add a can of diced tomatoes and will definitely use the slow cooker!

Wonderful flavor!. This recipe is hard to mess up! i did use salsa and added bacon. I think the main thing is the Chicken broth. If you follow that and add your own stuff it will still turn out great. Thank so much I will make this again!

This was a great recipe,the flavor was wonderful! I did do a few things extra...I soaked the beans for about an hour, I put in a few slices of bacon and I cooked them in the crockpot all day.We put this over cornbread and it tasted wonderful.

This is a great recipe. The only change I made was that I cooked with some ham. I also used a pressure cooker which cut the time to one hour, start to finish.

Nice and spicey! They have a great flavor. My family loves pinto beans and we use them in a lot of dishes. This one was used in chili today. Thanks for the recipe fooddude!

these turned out very good w/ a few changes: soak beans first, dont add salsa until towards the end of cooking time. i also had to add more cooking liquid a couple of times and some of the beans did burn a tad on the bottom because i didnt watch them as closely as i should have. i recommend checking on them about every 20 mins or so. i am so glad that i finally know how to cook dry beans! i did use my own salsa because i had some frozen that i wanted to use up

I used this recipe with a few changes.  Didn't have chicken stock so I subbed smoked diced ham.  Didn't have japs or green salsa but used Rotel instead. Quite good.  We'll be serving it over rice.  Will definitely make again.

I enjoyed these beans. I have always cooked my pintos in fatback and have been looking for a way to make them taste great without all the fat. This did the trick! While I was not crazy about the salsa addition, I do think all the other ingredients were excellent and I plan to use those ingredients without the salsa everytime I make pinto beans. I never thought garlic and cummin would be such a great addition to pintos. Thanks you for this great recipe!

I made these beans with what I had in my pantry. I used no jalapeno,and pace instead of green salsa. I placed them in the slow cooker for about 9 hours. They turned out great! My wife even liked them and she doesn't normally do pinto beans!!

The beans were definately tasty!  We ate them with tortillas, sauteed veggies, cheese and avocado.  They are even better a day later.  Next time I will soak the beans overnight.  They took about 3 hours to become soft enought for our taste and I had add about an extra cup of water.

This was actually pretty good.  i doubled the recipe and cooked on low in my crockpot for about 14-16 hours. 

the spices were a good base but a little too bland for us so in addition to the green salsa, i added about 4 tablespoons of chili powder, 8 slices of bacon and a 1/2 can of ro*tel tomato w/chilis.

will definitely make again!

Whew!  Either I got hold of a particularly wicked jalapeno or my green salsa was Rated XXX...almost too hot for me to eat and my husband couldn't.  I would suggest that the green salsa be added toward the end to avoid this problem.  I think the taste was pretty good...but it was hard to tell.  I'll cook up another batch of beans the same way WITHOUT either salsa or pepper, combine the 2 batches and see if that helps.  I really wanted some leftovers for refried.

I really like this recipe! I increased the water to 10 cups total, 4 of which are chicken broth made using 2 cubes of the chicken bouillon. I also add 1 tsp. of mexican oregano and a bay leaf to the given recipe. It doesn't hurt to increase the garlic as well.  These beans taste great in warmed corn tortillas with a little jack or cotija cheese, avocado, tomato, and sour cream.

Very good! I added bacon. I didn't have broth so I used water with a couple of cubes. I also make my own salsa, it's pretty hot, and added quite a bit of it in place of the green salsa. This made a very easy meal to prepare. Wasn't watching how long I cooked it but I think it was around 3 hours.

These were really good.  I didnt have any jalepenos on hand, so I added some extra salsa verde to make up for it.  I also used fresh chicken broth instead of canned.  In addition, I added about 1/2 cup ketchup to the mixture, as my mother always did.  I cooked it on low for about 8 hours in my crockpot, and it had a wonderful flavor.

This seemed to take a L-O-N-G time to cook based on how we like our beans, but when it was done it was wonderful!  I also put in the entire jar of salsa verde because we liked the flavor.  Great for a cold day!  I served it over rice.

Pretty good! I didn't have any green salsa, so I made do with a small can of green chili's. I also used dried onion in place of fresh. These were great! If you cook them down and mash them, they also make excellent refried type beans. We made these for navajo taco filling. Mmm!

Ok, I made about 1/2 pound, i added a 1/2 pound of chopped uncooked bacon to the beans while they cooked, i used 1 jared jalapeno because i didnt have a fresh one on hand and i used 1/2 of a little can of jalepeno salsa because i didnt have green salsa.  It was amazingly good.  My husband and my 7 yr old son loved it!

Excellent and easy.  I added 2 sliced of diced, uncooked bacon and used chicken broth if I needed to add additional liquid as they cooked.  I also used only half of a jalapeno pepper.

First time I ever made pinto beans from the dry state!  I had already soaked my beans for 8+ hours, rinsed them again, added more water and 4 cloves of garlic before I found this recipe.  So, once I found the recipe I added chicken base to make the "chicken broth" in the recipe, added onion, 1/2 cup red Pace restaurant style salsa, the cumin, and pepper.  I did not use jalapeno b/c we don't like spicy things. Simmered for about 2 hours and they were done.

Excellent recipe! I didn't use the jalapeno  because my husband can't take the heat Lol and I used red salsa because that is what I had. I also used 4 cups of water in addition to the broth and 4 strips of bacon. I cooked on the stove top covered for 2 1/2 hours.   Thumbs up from everyone in my house :) Thank you!

I actually made it in the Crock-Pot instead of on the stove so I let it cook for like six to eight hours. I also added a can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano seasoning in them.

Used red salsa, since it was on hand. Beans were very tasty, next try will be with vegetable broth for my vegetarian daughter. I am sure they will be good, and the preparation couldn’t be easier.

I made this in my electric pressure cooker with a few minor changes. I soaked the beans for about six hours and drained them. Then I sautéed the diced onion in a little vegetable oil in the pressure cooker (I used an Instant Pot brand pressure cooker). After a few minutes when the onions were soft, I added the garlic and cumin and stirred that constantly for about half a minute. I added the broth, salsa, a couple sprinkles of chili powder and a couple sprinkles of pepper. I then added about 3 soup cans of water. My resource said unsoaked  pintos usually cook in about 25 minutes and beans that are soaked for 8 hours cook in 10 minutes. Since mine were soaked for about 6 hours, I set the timer on the pressure cooker for 15 minutes. I let the pressure release naturally for about 35 minutes until I got impatient and released the rest of the pressure. The beans were soft, perhaps over cooked for some people, but I liked them a lot. I served over brown rice I made in my other pressure cooker with some low-fat sour cream and some salsa. Super good! The whole process after soaking took about an hour and a quarter.

I have made this about 5 times! It is the best recipe I have ever used for seasoned pinto beans.  I softened the beans in a pressure cooker for a half hour after sorting and rinsing and then put it all together and cooked on a low heat in a saucepan for about 2 hours. Absolutely perfect and full of flavor!

These turned out pretty good. I didn't have a jalapeno so I left that out. I used some homemade red salsa that I had in the fridge. I cooked the beans plain first for a couple hours then added onion and celery in big chunks so I could fish them out later. I threw in a lot of chopped garlic and some seasoned salt that I make. I used chicken broth to add liquid when it started to dry out. I was quite happy with the final product.

These were great - so tasty yet easily made vegetarian.   I pretty much followed the recipe except for using veggie broth and red salsa.  Served a double recipe to a large crowd - no leftovers.  I doubt many even realized there was no bacon or other meat flavoring.  Will definitely make again.

We had no leftovers.  We always have leftovers when I make beans even when I cut the recipe down in size.  It was a hit.  I used  505 Southwestern Hatch Valley Green Chile Salsa from Costco plus extra garlic.  I buy dried beans in bulk and cook up unseasoned batches in my pressure cooker (after soaking).  I then freeze them in 1 quart bags.  I also freeze 1 cup portions of the Trinity (onion, celery, and bell pepper).  It is easy to grab some beans, some Trinity, perhaps some ham scraps, and  some homemade stock from the freezer. I then add other seasonings as needed like for this recipe.

I needed a good side dish to go with some carnitas for a party I had last week. I made the recipe as it was written but did two thing a little different. I added 1T of vinegar to the end product. It helped brighten the flavors a bit. And then I mashed the beans partially. Made them wonderfully creamy. This recipe is going into my family cookbook. Yum! Thanks

I doubled the recipe and added a large can of tomato sauce and had to use chicken bouillon instead of broth since I didn't want to run back to the store again, and served with brown rice. And my family DEVOURED it! My husband told me this was now one of his most favorite bean dishes. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great starter recipe. For our tastes it needed much more seasoning like chili powder, oregano and paprika for a true Mexican flare. Let's face it, Texans also like meat in their pintos so I added 3 fat slices of peppered bacon. I started the beans in my crockpot on high for 4 hours, the beans still weren't done. So, I boiled them in my dutch oven for an hour until tender, adding water as I went. I served them in a bowl topped with fresh onion, cilantro, jalapeno and crumbled spicy, chipotle cheese. My husband smoked a pork loin so we ate the beans charro style with street style, pork tacos! Delish! I can't wait for leftovers!

I thought it was a little weird to eat beans in the water that they had been boiled/softened in, because I usually drain and rinse mine a couple of times when starting from dry. So I used my previously boiled and rinsed pinto beans for this recipe, doubled the chicken broth, and used a can of Mexican style tomatoes with chilis, boiling the whole for 45 minutes since my beans were already cooked. We ate this over rice, sprinkled some shredded cheddar on top and loooooved it!!!! I'll be making this again.

When I looked at the simplicity of this recipe, I was really skeptical. It looked too easy to be good. I was wrong—this recipe is fantastic. I changed a few things, mainly using a pressure cooker because I hate waiting hours for beans to cook. I put all the ingredients into the pressure cooker with an extra 16 ounces of broth, and cooked under pressure for 30 minutes.  (Instead of 1 tsp cumin, I used 3 teaspoons cumin seeds.) 

I then simmered it for another hour and added 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, while the broth cooked down.

I used this recipe as directed except I used my slow cooker.  I soaked the beans for atleast 12 hours first.  For some reason it took forever and after 12+ hours on LOW, I turned up to HI for a few hours and the beans were still a little hard.  Finally put everything on the stove and simmered for a few more hours and viola, they were done.  I used regular chicken broth (not low sodium) and my beans were old so maybe that was the problem.  I have read that adding salt during the cooking process will cause the beans to remain hard.  Overall I thought the taste was ok, but after the long process, I guess I just expected something more amazing.

I made this last night to top the Fry Bread Tacos by Robyn. We used it in instead of meat, and it was a big hit with my family. I only have old beans that never seem to get soft, plus I made it at the last minute, so I used a jar of pinto beans. I sauted the onion and garlic in olive oil, then added to the beans. I didn't have fresh jalepeno pepper so used some canned green chili's. I'll use fresh next time, but it was really delicious anyway. I think I'll also use this for regular tacos from now on instead of refried beans. Thank you!

This was so good.  My husband ate 3 bowls of it!  I made it brothy and used chili powder since I didn't have any cumin.  The flavor was so good!  I also put in quite a bit more diced fresh garlic since I was using elephant garlic and it doesn't pack as much punch.  I made the Vegan Cornbread (this website) to go with it.  We're not vegan but the recipe looked good and it sure was!

The best pinto bean recipe! Very pleased with this one. I love that I don't have to soak the beans, just clean and begin. This has been the fastest  I have succeeded with raw beans and they are so flavorful. I have tweaked the recipe with a slight difference of flavors several times and have been satisfied every time. Have not had leftovers yet.

I prepared this in my crockpot, but despite soaking the beans and cookking for several hours, it should have been cooked on high.  Much better the second time I made it.

This is my new favorite bean recipe. Simple and delicious! Because I don't like spicy food, I always leave out the jalapeño pepper. The first time I made it, I substituted regular salsa, but have also made it with the green (preferred the red). I have tried both bouillon and canned chicken broth (preferred the bouillon). Cumin is a new spice to me, so I cut it in half. First time I made it, I had left over dark chicken in the fridge from a store-bought roasted chicken. Added it to the beans and was blown away! Tasted like a mild chicken chili.

Don't mess with Texas!!!! Pinto Beans, that is! This is our new favorite recipe!!! I couldn't imagine such a fabulous taste. We used the can of chopped chiles instead of jalapeños and green salsa was just right, thanks again!!!

If I had known making beans was so easy and could be so delicious I would have made these a long time ago!  We all loved them.  I soaked the beans over night but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  So, so good!

Took a pot of beans to a 40th birthday party.  Everyone wanted to know the recipe.  I added a handful of ham to the pot of beans.  Also, I used 3 cups of dried beans, because I don't know what a pound of beans measures.

The recipe as is tastes great, but I like adding some cooked, shredded boneless chicken breasts so it ends up like a white chili. I soak the beans overnight and add pickled jalapenos (along with a few tbsp of the juice) and cook otherwise as is in a crockpot on low all day.

Easy but very good recipe.  I followed soaking directions on bean package before starting, then put all in the crockpot on high and cooked all day.  I added a few extra cloves of garllic and used two jalapenos instead of 1 and about 1 cup of the green salsa.  I served over rice one night and also have been eating them as is.  They are even better the next day.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

These were the best beans I have ever had. I grew up in the Chicago Region and we had beans and corn bread often, but used Great Northern beans. This is the first time I used pintos and will not go back to Great Northerns. As an added bonus, I am diabetic and my sugars were actually on the low side of normal the following morning after eating 2 bowls of beans and corn bread.  Maybe I have discovered a new treatment for diabetes.

This recipe rocks!!  I followed the recipe exactly, but then remembered 1 hour into the cooking time that I meant to halve all the ingredients as I used only 1/2 pound beans.  Oooops.  So added 2 cans of rinsed beans during the last 15 minutes or so.  Ah, ya, and I soaked my beans over night then all day while I was at work.  Put them in the slow cooker for the evening, on high, and sampled before bed.  Tomorrow will be beans and corn bread for lunch.  YUM!  (will omit jalapeno next time, bit spicy for this gal).  I'll make another batch with the other half pound of beans, and will remember to halve the other ingredients.  :)

I was looking for something to use up some fresh beans and I also had just bought some green salsa. Good recipe! Mine came out a little too spicy so I added some sugar and more liquid...but overall really good! Will repeat!

Very good.  I made this as a side dish and my husband and daughter loved it.  I ended up eating them as my meal instead!!  The only change I made was to use extra chicken broth instead of water to add more liquid as it cooked. I let them cook on the stove for about 5 hours because I did not soak my beans overnight. Excellent!!

These beans took over 24 hours to cook!  By then, I had to add so much water they were quite flavorless.  I'm giving it an extra star on the chance that I had defective beans, if there is such a thing.

I made this dish tonight and everyone likes it. I made it with some chicken stock and mostly beef broth like someone else did,everything else,just exactly. Like I said I was told it was good but I'm not a bean eater so you make it and judge for yourself.

Being a native Appalachian and a vegetarian (two things that don't generally go together), I wanted a recipe for pinto beans that didn't involve meat.  By substituting no-chicken broth for the chicken broth in this recipe, I think I've found it.  The biggest change I made, though, was throwing everything in the pot and letting it simmer all day.  I would recommend using a Crock Pot or just simmering it on the stovetop for about 8 hours (and adding more water/broth as necessary).  I added quite a bit more liquid, as where I grew up we liked "soup beans", but that's a matter of personal preference.

OK flavor. Used red salsa vs green. Outcome could have been more flavorful. Will add more spices next time- Emeril has a great "southwest essence" seasoning recipe online- yummy but use only a little since spicy. Will make again though.

This had a great flavor and I'll certainly make it again.  I followed the quick soak method.  I used just half an onion and that was plenty for us.  I might increase the amounts of jalapeño and garlic next time. If your beans aren't getting soft no matter how long you cook them, try using more water.  Beans have to absorb water to soften.

Very good.  I have tried to make pinto beans several times and they have never turned out.  My husband is a southern boy and although these were spicier than his mom makes he still loved them.  My two sons 1 and 3 also enjoyed them

I loved these! I have always just made regular pinto beans in the slow cooker, and I did these too, but I followed the recipe. They turned out better than the ones I usually made. I did not use canned chicken broth, I just used 2 cubes of Knorr chicken bouillon cubes along w/ the water, and also added some rotel, about 1/3 of the can, and skipped on the pepper. My husband loved them, so did the kids! Thanks for a great recipe! Almost forgot, I also added bacon, no salt needed as the bouillon and bacon made them perfect.

Yummy - I wanted to make some beans for Vegetarian Tortilla Stew on this site and trying to do more from scratch. These turned out great as a basic recipe. I didn't do the hot stuff because my kids aren't huge fans of spice yet. We will definitely make these again and make re-fried beans out of them. I went ahead and made two pounds worth so I'm freezing them to use later.

Excellent! My husband loves really spicey so I added 2 Jalapenos and 3 cloves of garlic, plus a roasted garlic salsa.
