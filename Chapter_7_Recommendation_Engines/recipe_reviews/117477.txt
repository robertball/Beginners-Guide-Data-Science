This is a very good and quick shrimp dinner. Instead of two cans of tomato sauce I used one seasoned with basil, oregano and garlic and a can of diced tomatoes with their juices. I was being lazy and didn't feel like chopping onions or peppers so I used a bag of frozen onion and three peppers blend. I also threw in some diced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce for some heat. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this exactly like the recipe stated and I loved it.  Every bite contained a tasty shrimp.  The only thing I would change would be to about half the cayenne pepper.  I know creole is suppose to be hot but the pepper hid the taste of the green peppers, onions, and celery. You have to have the rice with this to really complete the tasty treat.

This was the perfect recipe for us, since I wanted to use up some shrimp and leftover tomato sauce.  I noticed another reviewer used cream of celery soup, and since I like creamier sauces, I thought I'd give it a try.  I used everything the recipe called for (plus some dried oregano and basil), except adding the can of cream of celery soup diluted with about 1/4 cup milk.  I mixed it in slowly to the tomato mixture.  I cooked the medium-sized shrimp for about 2 minutes on each side, until they were pink throughout.  This made a wonderful, thick, creamy tomato sauce to top the shrimp and rice.   My version may not be anything like true shrimp creole, and it did not have any hot kick, but both husband and I loved it and will definitely make again!

the sauce was a little bland.  I put 1 tablespoon garlic, 2 tablespoons of chili powder, a teaspoon of paprika and a teaspoon of creole seasoning.

Very good and full of flavor. The only change I made was to cut the cayenne pepper in half as some of my kids don't like very spicy meal. Definitely a keeper.

Mmmm. Loved this healthier version! Made as written except I substituted 1T of olive oil for the vegetable oil and crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. It has a bit of kick. A little too much for kids, but just right for adults who like a some spice, but don't reach for the hot pepper sauce. Definitely a keeper!

I used more onion and garlic than called for, maybe more green pepper, too.  (Didn't measure)  Used a 15 oz can of sauce.  No sugar.  Butter instead of veg oil.  Added some Nature's Season (McCormick.  Didn't measure.  Added to taste)   Served over Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice.  IMO opinion ... the extra flavor of the rice I used is what takes this dish from so so to excellent.  No criticism meant.  Just mean to use the type of rice your family prefers.

This was ok, it just tasted like shrimp in a can of tomatoes, it didn't really impress me that much. My fianc√© is from the south and this did not remind him of home.

Receipe has too much cayene pepper.  About half the amount would have been much better.  Otherwise a great dish, very easy to prepare and tastes good.

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the vegetables and used 31-40/pound shrimp.   Cooked them in the sauce during the last 5+ minutes.   It was great and quite quick and easy.  I'd give it 5 stars, but my husband who doesn't like spice thought it was a bit too spicey.

very good and easy. I followed directions and added a can of stewed tomatoes which made more sauce to soak up rice. I used brown rice which is healthier. One time I was out of stewed tomatoes so I used a cup of picaante sauce and omitted ceyenne. Still delicious. Even hubby liked it.

Very easy to make and tasted good. However, I upped the garlic (fresh garlic) to a tablespoon and as well as upping the cayenne pepper and neither me or my man could taste either. There was no heat or kick to it whatsoever. I think that was because of the walgreens brand spice I had to use, but what's up with the garlic??? I also did what one member did and used a can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes. I will try this again with Mccormick spices to see if that makes a difference...maybe garlic in oil too.
