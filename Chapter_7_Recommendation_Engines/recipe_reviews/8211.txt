I tried this recipe according to reviews that others have left. I couldn't make up my mind whether to try it with a Spice cake mix or yellow so I did both. (We have neighbors who eat the extras that we fix.) With the spice cake, I used 1 & 1/2 cans apple pie filling. With the yellow, I used 1 & 1/2 cans PLUS added apple pie spice to the mix. They both turned out great, either is a great option, however, we really like the spice cake over the yellow. Next time we make this we'll use spice cake mix PLUS 2 cans apple pie filling. Even with 1 & 1/2 cans it didn't quite seem like enough. The cake is great though and I recommend it. Edited to add: For those that really like a more intense flavor, the spice cake may be for you. The yeloow is wonderful as well. I might consider using less brown sugar next time.

I have been making this cake for three years, always just by the recipe. I was looking at again on here today and read some of the reviews. So I decided I would try the two cans of apples instead. But really I only used 1 3/4. The recipe is soo much better! What I think happened is everyone is just using the 2 cans and thats how they know it. But I know it both ways now, and the original way is fluffier, and not so gooey like the 2 cans is. I think everyone should definitely just use the 1 can of apples. It suffices. Also, I cut up the apples this time (never have before) and I did like that better.

My hubby requested apple cake for dessert on Thanksgiving and this recipe fit the bill!  Per other reviews, I used 1 & 1/2 cans of pie filling, added cinnamon & nutmeg to both the batter and the topping, only used 1/4 cup brown sugar for the topping,left out the nuts, and baked for 37 minutes.  Tastes even better after a few days in the fridge! I like to heat it in the microwave, but hubby likes it straight out of the fridge.  Thanks Mary Ann!*******UPDATE*****  Made this in muffin tins & they turned out really well!  More like personal little apple cakes, but you can still pick them up & eat them like moist muffins!  Baking time was about 30 min for the muffins.

I love this recipe, but I have to say I added 1 apple and peeled, cored and cut up in bite size pieces and mixed it with the pie filling cutting up the apple also in the pie filling to bite size pieces. I also used the butter/yellow cake mix along with 1/4 cup of water, 1 tsp. cinnamon in the cake and 1 tbsp of mayonaise to moisten the cake mixed all together and poured it into a greased 9x13 pan with the topping you mentioned. The cake was so moist and wonderful I got rave reviews. I will definetly make this again thankyou for this recipe

Absolutely the best apple cake ever. Everyone raves about it. Have made at least a dozen times now. Great for those who can't have chocolate. I use the "premium" apple pie filling and add a pinch of pie spices. For those who don't care for nuts, use uncooked oatmeal instead. Turns out really well in a Bundt pan, too, made more like a coffee cake; double the amount of streusel topping in that case. My golden retriever puppy loves it, too. He ate more than half of a fresh one as it cooled on the counter!

Made this cake over the weekend.  Followed the advice of other reviews.  I added an extra half can of apple pie filling and when I make it again, I'll still add more.  Also, it came out somewhat dry so, I put a cover on top for a few hours while it was hot and, by doing so, it came out VERY moist!!  Would definitely make again.

I made this using cherry pie filling, 1/2 tsp. almond extract instead of the
cinnamon and chopped blanched almonds instead of the walnuts.  My son
and husband begged me to make another one right after they polished it off! 
This was extremely easy and delicious.  Perfect as a coffee cake for the
morning!

Quick, easy to make, and tasty. Not enough pie filling, though. Next time I make this cake I will add at least half a can more of apple pie filling. Also, way too sweet. I will skip the brown sugar and just sprinkle cinnamon and walnuts on top.

What a great cake! I made my own apple pie filling, and blended it seperately for only a few seconds instead of mixing it with the cake mix. I was looking for more coarse apple bits. I poured the cake batter in the pan, and then swirled in the apple filling. Then I baked it for 55 minutes at 350F. It turned out more of a coffee cake than a cake. IT WAS THE BEST CAKE I EVER TASTED! You must try this one!!

A pretty coffee cake, certainly quick and easy to mix up, with a moist, light and fluffy crumb.  Gratefully, it also has a fairly non-existent cake mix taste.  I find that to be the case when I use a French Vanilla cake mix when a yellow cake mix is called for.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. It’s a nice cake I would have no problems making again, but I‘d tinker with it.  The fruit flavor is fairly delicate and what little there is drowned out by too much nuts, probably twice as much as necessary.

I thought that the original recipe is really good, but with my slight alterations, it made it a FIVE: In addition to putting cinammon and apple pie spice in the batter itself I also added about 1 cup of apple sauce (no added sugar kind) for extra moistness. Then, I made a blend of cinnamon, apple pie spice, and pecans (instead of walnuts) and set aside. Once I poured half of the batter into a bundt pan, I sprinkled the cinnamon/pecan mixture over the batter, then poured the rest of the batter over it.  Once the cake was done and cooled, I flipped it out and dusted with powdered sugar. The result was a DELICIOUSLY most cake with a sweet/cinnamon/pecan swirl in the center!! Next time, I will likely use more apple pie filling, probably about 1/2 a can more.

I made several of these and didn't particularly like them (tasted like yellow cake with apples).  Others enjoyed them, though.  You may want to chop up the apple pie filling for more uniform distribution.  I also had trouble cooking the cake completely without burning the crumb topping.

My husband and I love this recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and added a second can of apple pie filling. I also cut the apples into bite-sized pieces. And I glazed the cooled cake with a confectioner's sugar glaze. I've made this three times in the last two weeks; it just doesn't last very long around here!

I followed the directions/ingredients exactly and found this recipe to be just what I was looking for. I used Comstock Apple Pie Filling. Cake was perfectly moist with just enough apple flavor. The streusal topping was perfect, too --- the brown sugar, butter & walnuts caramelized into a wonderfully crunchy mix. Did not taste like cake mix cake to me at all. Very good!

FABULOUS! my husband L_O_V_E_D this cake  and said he could eat the whole thing in one sitting!  other reviewers said they prefer more apples, maybe...but i think this was perfect as-is.  i used golden cake mix, but that might be a fancy way of saying yellow.  i didnt even have any cinnamon and it still came out GREAT!  Try it, you'll love it!

I love this recipe! I have been making it for friends for years! I always cut up the apples so you don't get big chunks, it also makes the cake a little lighter and more airy, I think.

This was the most moist cake I've ever made! After reading some of the other reviews I did make a few changes. I added to the batter: 1/8 cup water, cinnamon, 2 cans of apple pie filling. To the topping I used 3Tbs butter and extra cinnamon. This didn't even last a day it was so good!  Will be making this again!

This was so yummy and easy.  Many reviewers said to add two cans of apple pie filling but I only had one on hand, but I did add about 2/3 cup of cinnamon applesauce. It came out nice and moist, almost like a coffee cake.  Next time I think I will chop up the apples in the pie filling so they aren't such large pieces.  The topping was really good but I will be cutting down on the amount of brown sugar, it was a little much.  The nuts didn't stick well either.  I may put them right into the cake batter next time.  This is a keeper.  Thanks !

I have been using this recipe for 3-4 years now and follow it exactly except I omit the nuts because we are not fans of nuts.  I usually make it for breakfast on Thanksgiving and Easter.  I throw the topping together the night before and then just quickly put the mix, apples and eggs together that morning, sprinkle the topping on it, and pop it in the oven.  I love that there are hardly any dishes to clean with this recipe and I don't need to pull out my hand mixer, I just stir it together. My husband and I love this cake with whipped topping on it.

This recipe couldn't be easier and the taste is amazing, especially when served warm.  The preparation is minimal enough that it can be put together right before Thanksgiving dinner and served warm at the end of the meal.  I baked this cake at 355 for 35 minutes and I also took everyone's advice and added 1.5 cans of the apple pie filling instead of just one.  Also, I omitted the nuts because of taking the cake to a function where people could've possibly had nut allergies.  I'm not sure if I'd like the taste of it with nuts anyway.  If you like the taste of apple pie, this cake will knock your shoes off and since I don't put nuts in my apple pie, I doubt they are really a needed addition to this cake.  Its up to you though.  On another note, I like how the syrup in the apple pie filling substitutes for oil and makes the cake super moist.  Eating a cake with fruit in it makes me feel less guilty while indulging.  Great recipe.

This is the best, easiest recipe EVER! When I bring it to work I get raves, people beg me for the recipe, I even get a few marriage proposals!  I use one Mason jar of homemade apple pie filling, and it's perfect- just moist and goopy enough while keeping the cake mix light and fluffy. I think that's what they mean by "1 can"- there's a HUGE difference in the size of a Mason jar and the little cans of filling you get at the store. In any case, this is an ABSOLUTE keeper! Out of the last 4 I've made, I haven't even had one piece- it goes that fast! Many, many thanks for posting this recipe- I can't say enough about it!

I made this cake for a party and everybody loved it! It was so moist and the idea of using apple pie filling just made it so delicious because of the velvety texture from the sauce. This is definitely going in my recipe book - tried and tested and WOW.

Note: Reading through the reviews, there was a suggestion of adding 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder to the cake batter and I tried it - I felt it gave the cake that smell and taste of apple cake! Loved it!

"Whaddaya mean, you didn't make dessert?"  That was my husband...so 15 minutes before company arrived, I found this on the site, threw it together with a French Vanilla cake mix, and no nuts (didn't have any), and dessert was made.  It was super quick and easy, smelled great baking, and tasted delicious served with whipped cream.  Didn't even miss the nuts.  I will always have these ingredients in the pantry...just in case!

I just finished baking this & couldn't be more pleased!!  I didn't have pie filling but had 1 can (15 oz) Fat-Free 'Luck's' brand fried apples w/ cinnamon on hand and added 1/3 cup of applesauce to add thickness to apples.  I also diced the apples & added walnuts to the batter & then to top.  I am so glad I decided to try this recipe as I will make over & over!  I think when I serve it to guests today, it will complement a nice, warm cup of tea, coffee or cider nicely. Bonus: This dish is easy on the waistline!

GREAT! I also used 2 cans of filling. I was a bit nervous about that so I let it bake about 15 min. longer than stated. This is a keeper!  Hey, what about using peach filling? or chocolate cake & cherry filling? Yummy.

I need after church snacks on Sunday morning.  I modified this redipe only to cut up the apples with a pastry cutter before I added the rest of the ingredients.  I then filled mini muffin pans 1/2 full and added the crumbles on top.  They baked up so nice and went over very well at church.  The ingredients are a lot like the Cartoon Cake on this website (another favorite!!)
Thank you for sharing!!!  I will get a lot of use out of this recipe.

Wow, this is a great cake!  So easy and so flavorful.  I almost never bake and this was simple and easy for me to make.   I used spice cake mix and two cans of apple pie filling.  Delish!

It was a delicious cake-like the others I added 3TBS butter plus extra cinnamon-and other spices(pumpkin pie spice). I did add a bit of apple juice to the batter so it would spread easier-next time I will try extra apples. I used a french vanilla cake mix. It was a winner!!!

This was such a quick and easy cake! I made it as written except for the topping! instead of the crumb topping, I made a caramel drizzle by melting some caramel candies in the micro with a little milk. Worked great!

After reading some of the reviews, I tweaked this recipe a bit.  I added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  I also added nutmeg to the brown sugar topping.  I cut the brown sugar down as I did the nuts (only because I didn't have a full cup on hand.)  Peach filling would work well as would a spice cake mix-as other reviews mention.  Pecans would be lovely as well.  I love nuts.  I think next time I would add them to the batter too.  I can see why other reviews mention adding more pie filling.  It would be nice to have more apple in each bite.  

This was an easy recipe to make gluten free.  Now that gluten free cake mixes are widely available and it only calls for an extra tablespoon of all-purpose flour, substituting a gluten free flour is no problem!

This cake is sooo good!  The only change I made was to make the cake mix according to the package instead of just mixing it with three eggs.  It was much moister that way.  The second time I made it I also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the cake batter.

I just finished baking this cake and the first thing that comes to mind is that the crumble topping might be added toward the end of cooking time because the topping sunk in during the baking and is lost in the cake somewhere.

This recipe was a hit at a church function!!!  It was so easy too! I did change some things via the previous reviews; Used spice cake mix, added 1 tsp cinnamon, used 1 can of apple (while still in can used knife to cut up into smaller pieces) and then added one fresh apple cut up. For topping, used 1/2 C of brown sugar and more butter and flour to make a crumbier topping.  One time I did add oats in place of nuts and that turned out great too!  Will make again!

First of all, I have to say this recipe called for way too much brown sugar! And in my opinion, the cinnamon was overpowering (and I usually love anything with cinnamon in it). My hubby and daughter liked it, but I just thought this cake was too sweet- even after I cut back on the brown sugar (about 1/4 cup remained). Next time I will add the nuts into the batter instead of just sprinkling it on top, and substitute the walnuts for pecans. As for the cinnamon, maybe 1/2 tsp would be better. Overall, it's a simple recipe to follow, and I will make it again with these modifications.

This was my 9yr old sons first recipe he made on his own.  It is that easy.  The taste was good.  I think if I were to make it again, I'd reduce the brown sugar.  It seemed too much.  Best warm w/ vanilla ice cream.

Like other reviewers, I have made this cake with both a yellow cake mix and a spice cake mix.  Both turned out fine, but my personal preference is the spice cake.  I have also made it with 1 can, 1 1/2 cans and 2 cans of apple pie filling.  I think 2 cans of filling is too much.  One and a half works well, but I’m not sure it’s worth the extra expense and waste.  I think one can of filling works just fine.  This isn’t a fabulous bakery cake---it’s a simple cake, mostly foolproof, using a cake mix & pie filling and incredibly easy when you don’t have time to make something more elaborate.  I usually make several times a year and take it into work and most everyone seems to enjoy and appreciate it.

I split the batter in half and used walnuts and brown sugar to top the cake (as described in the recipe) in the one and just the brown sugar mixture on the other, and I must say, I rather prefer this cake without nuts.   It is a very moist and tasty cake, goes great with ice cream.  If you are a fan of warm apple pie like me, you'll love this!

This is a DELICIOUS easy recipe!!!  Right up my alley for someone who definitely is NOT the cook in the family!  My family was raving about the cake and asking for the recipe.  I also changed the recipe a bit as other reviewers did.  I used 1 1/2 cans of apple pie filling, and added 1 tsp of vanilla and some ground cinnamon to the batter!  I will definitely make this again!

I simply can't say enough about this marvelous cake.  It's moist and delicious, easy to make, and great to take to potlucks.  Because it omits the oil that is usually called for in cake mixes, it's much lower in fat as well.  The recipe is perfect as is, and my family just loves this cake.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

This is a beautiful and very tasty dessert!  I just served it to guests and everyone raved over it.  I made a few changes to the recipe: increase the pie filling to 1 1/2 cans(I also chopped up the apples before putting them into the batter), sprinkle cinnamon into the batter before baking, and top with a simple vanilla glaze.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Entered it in a bake-off at work and won 1st place. I used butterpecan cake the second time-yellow the first. Added apple pie spice to it and to the topping. Glazed it with a little icing sugar. It was all gone -real fast!!!Going to make it again tommorow for a party.

This was a simple and good recipe.  Not enough apples compared to the mix. I would use more pie filling or add a can of sliced apples to it.  I would also add more cinnamon and leave out the walnuts.

This is a great recipe!!  I had canned homemade pie filling in the fall and wanted to give it as gifts this Christmas.  I took the cake mix, put it in a cute bag, attached the recipe card and put it, along with pie filling in a basket or bag for a gift.  Everyone loves the cake.  I served it with Cool Whip which went over well.  The next time I make it, I will probably use 3 T. of butter, instead of 1 for the topping.

I just tried this recipe today. I didn't add walnuts because I truly dislike them. I substituted raisins and used carrot cake mix instead of yellow. It came out very moist. It was great minutes out of the oven.I will definitely make this again. I also wanted to try a chocolate version with cherry pie filling.

I made this for my sisters and they absolutely loved it! I used a white cake mix instead of the yellow. I don't like yellow cake, it's too dry. I also make a simple powder sugar frosting, very thin, and drizzled it on top after it was completely cooled. What a hit!!

We really enjoyed this moist cake.  I followed these tips left by previous reviewers: 2 cans of pie filling, 1 apple peeled and chopped (really liked that!), cut walnuts and brown sugar back to half a cup each, and heaped in the cinnamon in the batter and topping.  I will probaby use pecans instead of walnuts next time - and there definitely will be a next time!

This is good and easy!  Would be even better with ice cream, but I don't have any :( 

I'll make it again!

used 2 eggs plus 1/4 cup eggbeaters.  
added to yellow cake mix: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves.  I used a loaf pan, and also had enough batter to make 7 muffins.  very moist cake, absolutely DELICIOUS!!

Might be easy to make but the end result is a disappointment.  I used Better Crocker yellow cake mix and Comstock apple pie and the result was a cake that tasted just like a plain yellow cake, very little of the apple flavor came through at all.  The topping was passable but not enough to make up for the strong "cake mix" flavor.  If you're going to call it "apple cake," you should be able to taste the apples (in my opinion).

DELICIOUS!  After reading reviews, I added a tsp. of cinnamon to the batter, and I cut the apples in halves or thirds.  I also used 1/2 cup chopped pecans rather than a cup walnuts.  Served with vanilla ice cream and it was fabulous!  Update:  Today when I when to make this cake I discovered I didn't have any apple pie filling; I found a can of crushed pineapple and used that instead.  I added about 2/3 cup of coconut flakes to the topping - - YUMMY!

This was a super yummy and easy recipe.  I added the topping plus half.  Hubby just loved it.  I also cut up the apples into smaller pieces so that they could be distributed evenly.

I first made this recipe using a spice cake mix and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  I used just the one can of apple pie filling (sugar free) and cut them up as suggested.  It was wonderful!  Even better the next day.  I am now baking one using a reduced sugar cake mix, sugar free pie filling and Splenda brown sugar for the topping.  Can't wait to surprise my diabetic friend with it.  It may not be totally sugar free, but he will be able to enjoy at least a small piece and maybe freeze a couple more.

I got rave reviews for this quick-to-make cake!  I found that one can of filling was sufficient.  I'm not normally a fan of "cake mix" cakes but this was a useful and tasty timesaver!

Pretty darn good.  I added cinnamon, walnut extract and vanilla to a spice cake mix (we didn't have nuts on hand) and two cans of unsweetened apple pie filling after reading previous reviews.  Super moist and excellent flavor, I will definitely make again.

Fast and easy! Per other rewires used extra apple filling, 2 cans and that made it plenty moist. I will make this aging for pot lucks, but my family found it a little to sweet for there taste.

This cake was so easy to make and so yummy.  I used a sharp knife and cut up the apple slices in the can to get smaller pieces before I mixed them in.  The cake was very moist.  I served it a little warm with vanilla bean ice cream.  It was such a hit, I was inspired to try a variation, cherry pie filling and chocolate cake (not dark chocolate or fudge...that overwhelmed the cherry taste too much) with chocolate frosting.  My chocoholic family members liked that one better, but I prefer the original recipe.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was very moist as others have stated, but it lacked a lot of flavor.  I added apple pie spice and extra apples, but it still didn't taste good. My hubby (who will eat most anything sweet) said it was just ok.  Will not make this again.

I hated it but my husband loved it.  It tasted like canned pie filling to me, kind of tinny with an aftertaste.  Yuck.  I wanted to throw it away but my husband, who doesn't even like desserts much, wouldn't let me.

I made this for a big gathering so I altered it a little. Doubled the recipe and used spice cake mix instead of yellow. I alternated batter and brown sugar walnut mixture in a bundt pan, starting with the sugar mixture so you end up with a topping on the cake.  The swirl effect looked and tasted great, not a crumb leftover and everyone wanted the recipe.

Very, very good. Everyone will ask you for the recipe. Moist, wonderful coffee cake type of treat. I was generous with the walnuts....and think you could add some caramel sauce or butterscotch chips if you desire.

Just made it. I used classic white pillsbury moist supreme cake mix. 
I used 1 can of pie filling. I did not use nuts. 
This is great for dessert at home, bring to work or special events.
I had whip cream instead of ice cream.

I didn't have canned apple pie filling so i used my homemade chunky applesauce, added sliced (2) cortland apples and added a teaspoon of cinnamon sugar.  Followed the rest of the recipie. MMmmm!  We had small scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side of the warm cake.

This is what I did for what I had here. **Cake** 1 sugar free yellow cake mix made the way it instructs because I only had (29oz) canned apple (pitched the light syrup in it) cut the apples in bite size pieces. **Topping** 1/4c + 1/8c sugar, 1/4c + 1/8c splenda. 1T whole white flour. 4T butter. 1T cinnamon, 1/4t nutmeg.  I poured half the batter in prepared pan, sprinkled half the cinnamon/sugar/pecan mixture in the middle. Then sprinkled the rest on top. Is baking at this moment. **Next time I'll add the cinnamon/nutmeg right to the cake, it'll be evenly distributed through out the cake instead of concentrated parts throughout the crunch. Um yeah.

this was ok.  it definitely needs more apple.  i left out the brown sugar in the topping then found it needed something, so i did a drizzle of glaze (the basic powdered sugar, milk, butter stuff).  this helped.  made it more of a coffee cake.

Delicious!!! I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding an extra tablespoon of butter to the topping. Everyone who tried it LOVED it. I will definitely be making this again!!!  I also baked mine in stone and it took 45 minutes...

I made this for a group and everyone loved it.  The major change I made was to make my own apple pie filling instead of canned (apples, cinnamon, sugar, and a bit of flour).  I used more than apples than what would have been in canned filling.  Other than that I really liked this.  It was moist and tasted very much like a coffee cake.

This cake is really good, my daughter and boyfriend both went right back to the pan to get seconds. The topping really makes it good. Did everything the recipe said except for putting in the walnuts.

I followed this recipe to the letter...TWICE...and both times it fell.  As I was reading the recipe before I made it, it sounded to me like the sugar/flour ratio was going to be thrown off because of all the sugar in the apple pie filling.  I was right and it fell.  I even made it again to be sure I didn't do anything wrong and it fell again.  I will try a third time but instead of using apple pie filling (who needs all those extra calories anyway?), I will use natural applesauce.  Ought to be the same results but won't produce a cake that has too much sugar to keep it's loft.

I really like this, but I change it up. I add in a box of instant butterscotch pudding to the cake and apples.  I skip the butter and nuts on top and just sprinkle it with brown sugar and cinnamon.  It's SO moist and tastes even better the next day.

YUMMY!!! This cake was so good. I typically don't give too many recipes 5 stars. But this one was a home run. It was super easy, so easy that I was sceptical. I used cherry pie filling because that is all that I had. It was so moist and the streusel was crunchy and buttery (I used about 3 tablespoons). Since I was using cherry pie filling, I used slivered almonds in the topping. I think it was a great choice. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who wants a tasty and super easy fruit coffee cake.

This was a great quick cake!  I read other reviews that the cake came out dry.  So,  instead of adding more pie filling (I only had 1 can), I added 1 tbsp of veg. oil and about 1/4 cup of sour cream to the cake batter. Then I followed the recipe from there.  This tasted very good and was super moist.  Also, it was just as good or even better the next day warmed up.  I thought the apples were a little mushy for my liking, but that could be the brand I used.  Overall, great, quick reciped when you want a yummy warm dessert in not a lot of time.

We have made this for several gatherings and it gets accolades every time.  We add one peeled, cored, diced granny smith apple to the batter.  We also dice the apple pie filling.  Cinnamon is added to the batter.  We usually have to cook a little longer than 40 minutes when we use the metal 13 x 9 baking pan or bundt pan.  If you use a bundt pan and don't want an upside down cake, remember to put the topping in first, then the batter.  Oh, and we use pecans, not walnuts.  It is better to us when it's cold, so we refrigerate it after it cools and eat it with our coffee.

Great recipe.  Very simple.  I followed recipe except I didn't have any nuts and I cut up the apples in the pie filling and added tsp. of cinnamon to the batter. Served warm w/ a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Kids & husband thought it was yummy.

I used a spice cake mix and almost 2 cans of apples. It took longer to cook than what was stated. I used some advice from others and cut up the apples before mixing them with the dry cake. I received compliments on the cake, but to me, it wasn't a 5 star recipe.

Perfect the way it is.  The first time around I do not alter the recipe.  Next time I will cut the apples up into smaller pieces so that they will be more evenly distributed.  I think the complaints must be based on the type of applie pie filling you use as to how flavorful and moist it comes out.  I bake with top shelf items.

I pour a tub of vanilla or cream cheese frosting and pour it over the cake after it has cooled down.  Some people have used caramel frosting.  I have and will make this over and over again.  If I make one for a social gathering I have to at least make 6 other cakes for people to take them home for themselves.

I took some of the advice of others and added two cans of apple pie filling and it was just way too sweet. So, I ended up making a second cake and used one can and two diced apples. I added the nuts to the cake mixture and didn't add the topping. After it had cooled, I frosted it with cream cheese icing. Refrigerated overnight and then it was delicious.

Awesome! I did like other reviewers and added half a can more pie filling. It turned out very moist! After my husband had his first piece he told me he'd like about five more pieces! Will definitely make again!

This cake is excellent!  It is very moist, I subbed oats for the nuts in the topping and it's delicious.  I've also used cherries instead of apples, and my husband loved it too.  This one is a keeper!

When I first tasted the cake I thought, this tastes a lot like bread pudding!  Then it made me think of a cake that we used to have for lunch dessert in high school but it was made with cherries.  I'm very happy to have this recipe because I never knew how that wonderful cherry cake was made and  there are so many ways to make this cake!  My family really enjoyed it too. I used apple pie filling that my sister had made last fall with apples from her orchard.  I used 32oz. of apple filling and 3T of butter for the topping.  I will be making this cake again using cherry pie filling and I think it would be good with any fruit filling.

I'm a big fan of "apple cakes" and I thought this was very easy to make  delicious! I'll certainly be making it again.

I LLOOOVVEEE this!  The only problem I had was that it took at least 50 minutes to bake rather than 30.  I think I used an 8x13 rather than a 9x13 but I didn't think that it would make that much of a difference.

I decided to try this recipe although I had doubts about it (sorry, I am European, got different taste than Americans) Anyhow, it did turn out pretty good. My daughter and I both loved it. It was easy to make. The only change I did was, I put some cinnamon in the cake mix and I cut the apples to little pieces so it would even out. I would use more apples but I am wondering if it would change the texture or not. Any tips?

This was amazing and soooo easy. I made it in a Bundt pan (350 for 60min). I always add things to my recipies. I added 1tsp vanilla with vanilla pudding. I put 1/2 brown sugar mix on bottom of bundt pan, put in some cake mix then brown sugar mix followed by rest of batter. It turned out great, oh I also added cinnamon to batter....great

The cake was delicious; however, I will use 1 1/2 or perhaps 2 cans of apple pie filling next time, with a little cinnamon in the cake batter.  Thanks, Mary Ann for sharing!

This is an awesome cake!!!  I replaced apples with peaches.  I also replaced brown sugar with white sugar.  The toppings delicious!!! However, i believe it should be 1 1/2 cans of the pie filling.

After some reviewers mentioned that 1.5 cans of apple filling might still not be enough, I added a full two cans of filling and it ended up being way too sweet. Next time I will stick to 1.5 cans and I will also chop up the apples before adding.

This cake was delicious!! The topping was not too sweet, it was just right, and the cake had a vanilla flavor with a hint of apple.  That would be my only complaint--I wanted a stronger apple taste. Still, it was very good.  I brought it to an apple dessert potluck my daughter's kindergarten held and I think it was the most popular dessert there, both with the adults and with children.

I was not too impressed with this cake.  It might be because I don't usually like cakes made with boxed mixes.  I had hoped because of the rave reviews that this one would be different.  It seemed rather bland to me.  My children didn't eat it either.

YUMMY and easy!  This was a great hit, even with my fruit-hating husband!  I also plan to try this recipe with either a white or lemon cake mix and a blueberry pie filling (which will hopefully taste similar to Tim Horton's lemon-blueberry muffins).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very very good and moist. I have made this recipe over 2 dozen times and always hand it out when taking the cake to a party. Cherry pie filling works well too - cake mix with pudding in it works the best. Thank you sooooo much for sharing this recipe!!!!

The only change I made was to omit the nuts from the topping, so I made double of the brown sugar mix. The result was a wholesome, tasty cake that everyone enjoyed. I used my homemade apple pie mix and homemade yellow cake mix made with half wholemeal flour. Since then, I have made it again with lightly cooked plums and it was very tasty. I recommend this for a quick, old-fashioned treat.

I read all the reviews that say to increase the apple pie filling or even double it, but decided to make it with just ONE can and it turned out PERFECT!!!  The cake was moist and delicious! My vote: ONE CAN! ..just as the recipe says.
I did, however, cut some of the apples up just a little bit so they weren't such big chunks.  Everyone absolutely loved it and wanted the recipe.

Disappointed.....Made the recipe according to instructions and the time frame to bake (and yes my oven is calibrated correctly) is stated as 35-40 min...... I pulled the rack out a little for the toothpick test and the entire cake was only set about 2 inches from the edges, it fell and a lot of expensive ingredients went down the garbage disposal.

So easy and so good to eat. Since it was only going to be for two I modified;used a Jiffy yellow cake (9oz) mix and one egg, a dash of vanilla, nutmeg,  and reduced the remaining ingredients. Will make again!

I made this for Christmas brunch and it was a HUGE hit! I did use 1 1/2 cans of apples based on other reviews and it was still fluffy.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to both the cake and topping! I only had chopped pecans on hand, so I subbed those too! I am going to try this with cherry pie filling next!

Delicious with a few changes.  For the filling I added a teaspoon cinnamon and a 4 oz. container original apple sauce.  I cut up the apples in the pie filling.  The topping I increased the butter to (2) Tablespoons, added a 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and a cup of instant oats instead of walnuts.  Followed everything else as listed.  Moist and flavorful.

After reading some of the prior reviews, I opted to use the spice cake mix and 1-3/4 cans of apple pie filling.  I am glad I did.  This cake had great flavor and was very moist.  It is a very simple and quick recipe and easy to make.  I will definitely will be making this cake again, as everyone in my house enjoyed it.

I love finding recipes that are easy, delicious and gorgiving. This one is all 3 - and can be healthy too! This made up nicely with a gluten free cake mix (Betty Crocker, 2 egg whites, (21 ounce) can sugar free apple pie filling and omitted sugar, flour, butter and walnuts. The cinnamon was sprinkled lightly over the top. Mix and bake. Yummy!

The initial recipe was VERY Sweet. Since I canned my own Apple Pie Filling last Fall.... I used a Quart of this. Many of the reviews suggested using 2 cans of Apple Pie Filling.... so I used a Quart. Since that was the size I had. :) I also would not recommend using so much brown sugar. I used the 3/4 cup as suggested in the recipe, and changed the amount to 1/2 cup below.... but I would maybe even suggest using less then that... maybe 1/4 cup. It was VERY sweet. I also melted caramels for the top. Enjoy!!!

Ingredients
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter, soft but not melted
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 package Betty Crocker Super Moist Yellow Cake Mix
3 eggs
1 Quart Apple Pie Filling
Approx 12 pieces of Brachs Caramels
1 TB Water

I like to make some ridges in the top of the batter and have groves of the crumb topping sink in.  I use a rubber spatula and make a small indent, add a tablespoon or two of filling...  and randomly do this across the top of the cake.  Then I sprinkle the remaining topping evenly over the top. 

Unwrap the caramels and place in a small glass microwavable bowl.  Add about a TB water. (you can even use 2 TB)   Microwave on high for about a minute.  It will start to boil and foam up the sides, so watch carefully.  Using a small wire whisk or fork, mix the contents vigorously for about 1 minute until smooth.. drizzle over top of cake.

the easiest recipe. Cake was fluffy and light, topping was just right. Although I used a 2 oz bag of chopped pecans because I'm not a nut lover.

I made this cake with homemade apple pie filling (used the apple pie filling II recipe on this site- use 2T cornstarch in place of tapioca, 1t cinnamon, 1/4t nutmeg in pie filling)  It was perfect - moist and dense with a crunchy top.  Only change I would make was decreasing the sugar to 3/4c in the pie filling.

I took this cake to a pot luck last night and came back with nothing! People had second and third helpings and even took some home. The only modification I made was adding 1/4c of orange juice to the batter. This made it more spreadable and added a little citrus flavor. I also put this in a 10'' round pan, and it looked wonderful as a round cake. My topping did not turn out as crunchy as in the picture above, so to compensate I made a glaze out of confectioner's sugar and milk and drizzled it on top. It looked gorgeous! I also agree with the reviewer who said one can of pie filling was enough. I thought it brought more than enough flavor.

So easy and so good! My mom did not believe that it was a cake mix. I did have to cook it a little longer but I  also added 1/2 a can more filling. Next time I am going to try only 1 can of filling I think it will be just fine. Other than that I kept everything the same.

This recipe is very good as is; however, I did make 2 changes.  I put half the batter in the pan then topped it with a peeled & chopped apple then spread the remaining batter on top.  I also decreased the amount of brown sugar in the topping to 1/2 a cup.

Excellent recipe. made for work, alot of people asked for recipe. I agree with others it does need more than 1 can of pie filling, however if using 1 can i cut the apple slices in half so it distributed through the cake more.

I've made this cake 4 times now.  Three times using spice cake mix (absolutely divine!) and once using yellow (tasty, but my co-workers liked it better than I did).  I omitted the nuts and in addition to the other ingredients, I added 2/3 cup applesauce to the cake mix.  I chopped up the apple filling as suggested using a pastry blender and added the applesauce to that before combining it with the cake mix and eggs.  I've also swirled the topping around with a knife before baking, which made it taste like a really great coffee cake.  And it is EXCELLENT cold!  So moist and so flavorful.  I won't ever make it with yellow cake again though.  Spice cake all the way for me!

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers by cutting up the apple, adding 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the cake mix and 1/2 tsp to the topping.  It was good and moist.  Next time I'll add 1 tsp each in the cake mix and topping.  Definitely put pecans in the topping.  Most of my family enjoyed it.

My sweet loving hubby went crazy over this, but it was a little too sweet for my taste.  Maybe I'll like it more now that it has been in the fridge for a day. Quick and easy, so for that I would probably make it again.

An Absolutely fabulous recipe. My Mother in Law told me about it and it has been a hit with the family! I prepare it just as the recipe states, except i had a bit more nuts. 
Thanks Deloris!!!

Super delicious!!!Thanx for the recipe. I made it on an 8x3round pan and poured the Chocolate Ganache over it.  It was a bday cake for my husband.  Everyone loved it.  My cake was not dry but moist and tasty.  Thanx once again.  This is a keeper.

Everyone needs this recipe in their file.  So easy and so yummy.  I didn't have any nuts so I substituted oatmeal as suggested and added a little more butter.

I made this recipe as it was written.  I used 1 can of no sugar added apple pie filling and slightly diced the apples.  The result was great.  Many + reviews from the eaters!

I made this for a brunch at work and everyone is raving about it. I may have cooked it for a few minutes too long, but I think it turned out a little dry. Then again, I'm very critical of the things I bake. 
I LOVE the topping, used pecans instead of walnuts. Next time I'll make more topping. 
Will definitely make again!

The BEST cake I've had the pleasure to taste. I did take the advice of several other reviewers and used two cans of apple pie filling. Thank you Mary Ann Benzon for a wonderful recipe. I think you should win some kind of award for this one!!!

This cake is so GREAT! I am usually not a big cake fan, unless they're really dressed up with extras. However, this one is SO moist and SO yummy that I keep eating "just a smackeral" every time I walk by it! This one is not only going into my personal recipe box, but straight to the front of the cake section! Now for the changes I made... After reading other reviews, I ended up using two cans of apple pie filling, instead of just one. And then I had written the recipe down wrong, so it didn't include any butter for the crumb topping. Somehow in my gut I knew it HAD to be missing butter. So I looked at my apple crisp recipe, which calls for 3/4 cup of butter, and just used 1 stick (1/2 cup). SO, after reading the actual recipe today, I see I added 8 TIMES the amount of butter I was supposed to have added... So the top isn't really a crumble, but it still tastes delicious! Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!

What a great recipe!  I actually changed the recipe a little, I didn't have any apple pie filling, so I substituted chunky applesauce.  I didn't change anything else, and it was Wonderful! What a great, simple recipe!  Even the cake hater in my house loved it and said this was a keeper (and his new favorite)!  12/2010 Tried it with a can of cherry pie filling and 1/2 can of tart cherries to make muffins. YUM!!

This cake is so moist and delicious.  I have made it twice in the past two weeks for my husband and I to take to work and it was a big hit both places.  the cinnamon/sugar topping really makes it good.  I did not increase the apple pie filling as some suggested and it was great!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was a super quick and very good tasting recipe.  The only thing wrong with it was that I could not just eat one piece, I had to have two right away and one this morning for breakfast.  Excellent!

I added canned peaches (slices, in syrup--I used the large can) instead of apples, and chopped the slices in 1/2. Since there was nothing else added in the cake, I poured some of the syrup in the mix to add a little extra flavor.  I also added a pinch of nutmeg and some cinnamon (for that peach cobbler taste).  It took a little longer to cook but came out just fine.  But I agree with some of the others, it does need SOMETHING, such as a sauce (although I'm not much on sauces) or a scoop of vanilla ice-cream.  Overall, I would make this again.

I bought canned sliced apples instead of pie filling by mistake.  I mixed them with a little flour, brown sugar and cinnamon and added them all the same.  I used two cans of the apples (as I had read some people didnt' think one can of filling was enough). This cake was wonderful!!  Super moist and even better the next day or two!!  I didn't use too much brown sugar in the topping, so all together, it wasn't overly sweet, which is how I prefer it.

This was dry and flavorless, not very good at all, we were very disappointed. Perhaps we baked it too long? Wasn't burnt though. Will not make again.

Very easy to make and delicious, the only little draw back I have that the sides are just a tiny bit dry.   But overall definately a cake I will make again.

Quick and very easy to make!  This is very good - I took it down to my mom and dad's and couldn't keep my dad out of it!  His response was that it tasted like apple pie.  I made it with two cans of pie filling and white cake mix instead of yellow - I also used less brown sugar, since that was all I had on hand. Very Yummy! Thanks for a quick and delicious recipe.

My family LOVED this! I didn't have a yellow cake mix on hand so I used a Spice cake and added a little nutmeg to the topping as well-I also left out the nuts since my kids won't eat them. YUMMY! I am excited to try this with the yellow cake mix as well!

Great easy recipe.  The whole point for me was to make an apple cake and (duh!) all I had was a can of peach pie filling.  So I used that instead and it turned out really well.  The kids loved the pieces of peaches inside.  Only other adjustment I made was I threw in some freshly grated nutmeg. Cake was wonderful and would double nicely as a coffee cake for a brunch.  Next time I'll be sure to buy apple pie filling :o)

This recipe was extremely easy to make, but did lack a little bit of flavour.  Would probably add a bit of cinnamon to the batter next time.  Thanks

I would say the only difficult part of this recipe is chopping the nuts! It goes together so quick and easy when you are in the mood for those "fall flavors" of apples.  I would say it is more of a "coffee cake" . Very good.

i have used Bisquick baking mix instead of the yellow cake mix and added 1/3 c vegetable oil and 2 T of vanilla.  Makes a great      substitution if you do not have a yellow cake mix in the house.

I love this cake! It’s so easy & yummy. Going exactly by the recipe it was too dry & not enough apples. To moisten it up evenly all the way through I used 2 cans of apples instead of 1. Chop the apples as they distribute much better. I also used 3 tablespoons of butter in the topping instead of 1. One of my go to recipes now.

I made this recipe as written. Used Duncan Hines yellow cake mix, 1 can of Country Style apple pie. I took someone's advice and covered it with tin foil after taking out of the oven. Let it cool and then glazed it.

It was VERY sweet and VERY moist! Everyone liked it!

This is a delicious, easy cake. I added some pumpkin pie spice to mine which was a great touch. However, I can say the next time I make it, I'll skip the topping which added a bit too much sweetness for my taste. Still, it's a solid recipe that will be one of my go-tos.

The taste is great, but what a disaster. I followed everyone's hints and tips, though I did only use 1 can of apples and cut they up with a pastry blender, but it's a big disappointment. Oh well, it could have been great. You have to try.

This cake was awesome! I did read the reviews and added 2 cans of the apples (the second can I rinsed before I added it) and did chop all the apples. I left out the walnuts (nut free work place) . Everyone loved it!  Came out  nice and moist!  I will make again, will add the nuts next time!

Made this for a church funeral luncheon today.  1/8 C. water added to batter because I was worried about moisture.  Otherwise, made exactly as directed.  Came out fabulous!   The ladies that served the luncheon absolutely loved it and were all asking for the recipe!   Definitely a hit.  I'll be making this again.

Great recipe, I added an extra two fresh apples I had on hand and sprinkled the yellow cake mix with cinnamon before adding the brown sugar topping. Served as dessert with cool whip the second time I made it.  Very good!

This was phenomenal and so simple to put together. The only changes I made were omitting the nuts due to allergies and increasing the amount of butter to 4 tablespoons. We had last minute unexpected company and I was able to get this dessert together in under an hour. Thanks for this recipe! It's a keeper!

Very moist cake. Like others, I used spice cake. This recipe has the potential to be very flexible, I looking forward to trying other cake mix/pie fill combos.

Was my first time making this   I was very pleased at first I thought  it was going to be a heavy cake  but it was not it was actually very light I served it to my company and everyone loved it. The only difference is that I did not  add the nuts to it . I knew some of my company did not like nuts I will make this again you won't be disappointed .

I didn't have canned apple pie mix so I made my own and it was amazing! A huge hit with the guys. Instead of walnuts I used pecans. I will definitely be making this again ;)

Made this a few times! Wonderful recipe. The only different thing is I took other reviewers recommendations and used two cans of apple pie filling, spice cake mix. I also used an extra egg and threw in some raisins. The bunts cake came out moist and delicious. No need for a glaze or frosting !! Will definitely be making this again soon!

Super easy....good as a coffee cake, not as a regular cake, even if it was served with ice cream.  The streusel topping makes it a coffee cake.  I would make again to serve alongside breakfast if I was having company over since it is very easy and requires few ingredients.   I baked in a cupcake tin for about 16 mins and they stayed really puffy and didn't fall like other reviewers commented.

I made this my own by:  Adding 2 cans of homemade apple pie filling (4 cups total), 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla, and a pinch of salt to the original batter recipe.  And, I doubled the topping recipe but only using the 1 tablespoon of butter that is called for in the original recipe.   Fantastic!!!  Moist, appley, cinnamony deliciousness !!  No yellow cake flavor, but with all the ease of using a boxed mix.  I always add sour cream to most of my cake recipes because it adds flavor and moistness.  I also used my own recipe canned apple pie filling.  I always add lots of sugar and cinnamon... lots of cinnamon.   I don't care for the flavor of store bought pie fillings, but if I were to use it in this recipe I would:  Add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon + 1/2 cup of white sugar to the canned stuff (2 cans).  Then I would also add another teaspoon of cinnamon to the cake batter itself, on top of the added stuff from above.  I know it seems like a lot of extras thrown in, but it makes all the difference in the world!  13 x 9 greased and floured pan, and I baked it at 350 for 45 minutes. YUMMY.

Delicious! Especially warm with ice cream! Very easy, very quick. Had to use a spice cake mix, and bake the full 40 minutes. I'm sure it will be even better the second day.

Delicious!! I stuck with one can of apple pie filling and it turned out wonderfully fluffy. I cut the apples as I added them to the batter so they would be more evenly dispersed. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg,and 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the cake mix batter--I love cinnamon and brown sugar flavors!! I probably could of done a little more and it still wouldnt have been over-powering. I also adjusted the topping because my hubby doesn't like nuts in his desserts. I did 1 C. packed brown sugar, 3 Tbsp softened butter, and a packet of "cinnamon roll" flavored instant oatmeal.  The topping was crispy and sweet and a perfect contrast to the fluffy apple layer. (Serve this warm with ice cream!!)

Used chopped pecans (what I had in stock) and spice cake mix.  I layered the batter with the sprinkle in between and on top.  Used at a brunch today.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  It was a hit.

Quick, easy & delicious! Chopped the apples up, added 1 cup of apple sauce and pie spice. Topped off with Cinnamon Bun frosting instead of the crumble topping. Dinner guests loved it!

I think this recipe is easy and delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to add a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg to the cake batter while mixing.  If you're looking for a simple apple cake recipe then you should definitely give this a shot!

my step-daughter wanted an "apple cake" for her birthday, so I made this with a gluten-free vanilla cake mix (Namaste brand) and it came out very good. used two cans of pie filling and 1/2 C brown sugar. It was even better for breakfast the next morning. It took about 50 min. to cook.

I made this in the morning to take to work.  Fast and easy, it baked while I was getting ready.  I used a spice cake mix and added 2T oil for moisture.  I used an electric mixer, there was no apple texture left but the flavor was great.  The cake was still warm when I got to the office. Loved it as did my co-workers.  This ones a keeper!!!

I didn't use the walnuts and I added more filling based on the reviews.  Turned out yummy.  My husband said it tasted a little like a rum cake.  Maybe next time I will add a little rum or make a rum glaze for topping.  hmmm

I'll have to agree with the other reviewers that you need more than 1 can of apple pie filling.  I had to add milk to the dough since it was too dry.  i didn't have walnuts, so i used raisins in the topping instead.

I made this for thanksgiving dessert. Everyone said it was good, I would have preferred a stronger apple taste and if the flavor of the cake mix was milder. Did not taste home made. but everyone else loved it

This was good. My husband loves simple cakes like this smothered in whip cream. He loved it. I thought it was a little plain, but I think that's the point.

I thought this recipe need a little something.  I will give this another try with another can of apples, additional cinnamon, and maybe a crumb topping.  The brown sugar topping was very sweet.

I used a new Cinnamon-Swirl cake mix and didn't add cinnamon to the topping mixture.  I had to cook it for about 15 minutes longer than indicated.  It was good, but not incredible - I couldn't taste enough apple, but I did get several requests for the recipe from friends.

Very moist, very flavorful, delicous! I would agree and call it more of a coffee cake.  It would be more better with more apples though.

I double checked the recipe to make sure I'd done it right because I really didn't like this cake.  Mine was void of flavor and not very moist at all.  Pretty sure I did everything according to the instructions.
