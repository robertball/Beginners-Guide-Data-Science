YUMMY!!! This recipe was great. I made some modifications based on the ingredients I happened to have on hand, and it still turned out great. Used 1.5 lbs ground beef (since it was packaged that way), 1.5 cups salsa since that was all I had, black beans instead of chili beans for a little added mexican flare, 2 cups crused tortillas, no olives (can't stand em), and 1 can diced tomatoes, drained. GREAT TURN OUT!!! A few things, though... I agree with another reviewer that 3 cups is definitely too much for the tortilla chips. The 2 cups I used was too much. I'll only use about 1.5 cups next time. Also, my diced tomatoes were canned with basil and garlic, and I didn't care much for the flavor with this casserole (although it was mild enough that I still gobbled it up), so I'll remember to have just some regular diced tomatoes on hand from now on. And, if you like green onion, don't skimp on it here. The flavor really goes well in this dish; I mean, out of this world. MMMMM... Of course, as others suggested, I browned the ground beef with onion and taco seasoning (I added this WHILE the meat browned, not after, but either way would probably work fine). As always, I used all organic ingredients and followed the layering just as specified in the recipe. This dish is a knockout! Thanks so much for sharing it.

We thought this recipe was awesome!  I did do as many others and added a packet of taco seasoning to the meat.  I also added a little garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne-southern people love there seasonings!!  I used bite-size totrilla chips and they worked out prefectly.  This recipe is definitely going to be a repeat!

I changed this up a bit to try to make it healthier.  I used corn tortillas on the bottom instead of torilla chips, and layered the ingredients in 2 layers, like a lasanga, hoping it would hold together better.  I used one layer of corn and another of flour torillas.  I used a blend of cheese ("mexican style") and low fat sour cream, added an additional can of chili beans, and used ground turkey instead of beef.  I also added a green pepper, an onion and green chilis and some more spices, as many reviewers said it was bland.  It wasn't spicy at all so next time I'll add more to it.  It still was pretty tasty and a hearty meal with a nice salad.

This was fantastic. I normally would have used refried beans with a dish like this, but the chili beans were perfect! They added just the right flavor to it. Our whole family loved this recipe. We will definitely be eating it again. I don't think I will crush the chips next time though. Instead I'm going to try leaving the chips whole. Some of the chips were a little tender, and we all prefer crispy things to stay crispy. We still loved it though just as it is.

WOW! I doubled the recipe so I could experiment and the results were incredible! Changes from original recipe include: 1. Used 1/2 ground beef, 1/2 sweet saugage, casing removed. 2. Used chipotle taco seasoning. 3. Used chili and black beans. 4. Used 1 can of diced tomatoes, salt free, and 1 can of Rotel. 5. Mixed cheddar with salsa jack cheese. 6. Added garlic and onion powder. 7. Forgot the black olives. This meal was so delicious. As others have mentioned, not the healthiest option, but for a pot luck or get together where it will be one of many choices, it can't be beat!

This was mui bueno! I added green chilies, seasoned (drained) black beans, taco seasoning, Emeril's Southwest Essence, (drained) Mexicorn and a can of Rotel.  Did not use the sour cream but I did layer the ingredients using split white corn taco shells.  Seemed a bit soggy so next time I'll double the thickness of the taco shells.  Nice paired with a salad tossed with southwestern ranch dressing.  A good recipe to customize to your own taste. I just love these recipes where canned products end up being used so creatively you can't tell they're canned.

This was excellent.  I did change a couple of things.  Added garlic, used black beans instead of chili beans, added corn and chopped canned chilies.  I also mixed monterrey jack in with the cheddar.  The salsa I used was Joe T. Garcia's, medium.  My fiance loved this recipe and gave me the line, "It's a keeper!"  The wonderful thing about this recipe is you can add anything.  Want it hot, add hot salsa.

Not only is this an easy dish, it is also VERY good. Per other reviews, I used taco seasoning on the meat after it was browned.  I also reduced the sour cream to 1 1/2 cups and spread it thin over the meat (my boyfriend is not the biggest sour cream fan) and sprinkled appx 1 cup crushed chese flavored nacho chips (ie: doritos) before topping it all off with cheese. Very tasty! We have no leftovers! Thanks Andrea!

Easy and something different for a mexican meal.  I did as others and used taco seasoning and black beans with the ground beef.  In addition, I used Rotel tomatoes with green chilies and Mexicorn on top of the sour cream.

This is an excellent recipe. I have been making it for years. When I explained my version to my family in Mexico, they said: here we call it "Pastel Azteca". In my version I use chopped white or red onions instead of green. I saut√©e the meat with one of each of diced red and green (sweet)peppers and taco spice mix, also I usually use a mixture of grated cheeses: mozarella and cheddar. A hint: if you use whole fresh corn tortillas and layer them with the other ingredients, it turns out like a lasagna! Sometimes instead of adding the beans to the casserole I make frijoles refritos and serve them as a side dish. Along with a green salad. And a bowl of extra salsa picante.

I can't actually speak first hand on this recipe because I changed it so much but we like it enough that I wanted to share what I did because this recipe has endless opportunities for growth!  I actually did a combo of this recipe and the "Mexican Casserole" recipe on this site with a bit of my own tastes as well.  1st I used 1lb. of hamburger and 1lb. of ground turkey browned with garlic and onion and put in taco seasoning and chili powder.  then, I added a can of Rotel tomatoes, ranch beans and a few spoonfulls of cream cheese.  in the pan, I put down a layer of flour tortillas, a layer of the meat mixture, sour cream on top of that, with lots of shredded sharp cheddar and colby jack and repeated.  Ended with a layer of cheese on top and baked to a beautiful golden brown.  All I can see is YUMMO as did my 8 yr old son and Husband.  I made homemade guacamole and served with chips so you can either it plain of dip your chips in the casserole.  I didn't want the chips to get soggy as others mentioned.
This will be made a lot in my home from now on and I hope you will experiment with your favorite flavors! OOPS, P.S. I also added two cans of cream of mushroom soup into the mixture.

I have been making this for about 8 or 9 years. I have tried other Mexican/Taco casseroles, but this is always the one that I come back to. My family, and everyone I have made it for love it. I have changed a few things for our taste, but the basic recipe is the original. I use a little less crushed chips. I saute a couple of chopped jalapenos and 1/2 red onion in a little cooking oil before I brown the ground beef. I use hot salsa. I use a can of dark red kidney beans and a can of black beans. I use the blend of Kraft shredded Mexican cheese. I put the black olives in with the beans. Serve sour cream, guacamole, sliced green onions, chopped jalapenos, and chopped tomatoes as garnish for the dish so everyone can add to their liking. I think by cooking the beef/salsa mixture until the liquids from the salsa evaporate will cure the problem some have with the soggy chips. I also drain and rinse the beans. I have never had a problem with soggy chips. I use a 9x13 glass pyrex pan and put it on a rimmed cookie sheet for baking. This is a recipe that very easily adapts to personal tastes. Thank you the many good meals and compliments I have received from serving this dish.

Our family loved this recipe! I made just a few changes to it. 
1) Used lean ground turkey and drained it after browning,
2)Along with the chunky salsa, I added a packet of taco seasoning which gave it extra flavor and kick
3)used black beans because I didn't have chili beans
4)I spread 1 1/2 (not 3) cups of "broken" (not "crushed") tortilla chips in the bottom of the pan
5)Sprinkled 1 cup of shredded cheddar over top of the broken tortilla chips and topped that with the meat mixture
4)Spread just 1 cup of sour cream over the meat mixture
5)Substituted a can of drained diced tomatoes for the fresh ones
6)Topped the casserole with more broken tortilla chips, and topped that with the remaining 1 cup of shredded cheddar.
I served it with extra sour cream and guacamole. FANTASTIC!   My family wants this in our regular supper rotation. : ) A great recipe to "play" around with.
Thanks for posting, Andrealf63

Good & quick recipe.  Sheesh...perhaps it could be called Tex Mex Casserole to accomodate both regions.  This would satisfy the critic who rated it 1 star because Mexicans don't iuse sour cream, cheese,. chili beans, etc.  Get a LIFE!

This is a perfect recipe to make use of those tortilla chips left in the bottom of the bag! With the seasoning, it's also a great recipe for our family to use natural venison meat. You can cook it as is, leave ingredients out when you're short or jazz it up by cooking a couple cloves of minced garlic with the meat mixture and/or adding taco seasoning. When I've been out of salsa, I've also swapped it with a canned Mexican mix of diced tomoatoes and jalapenos with good results. I prefer using a Mexican mix of cheese instead of the cheddar. My husband prefers the layering in the following order to keep the chips crisp: meat mixture, sour cream, veggie layers, crushed chips, and cheese.

This is so... for my family, we loved it!  Like many others I did make a few changes.  In lieu of chips I lined a 9 x 13 dish with 2 layers of corn tortillas,.  I heated/browned them over a gas flame, used a dozen.  As others I added a can of drained corn. I also added a package of Taco Seasoning to the ground beef.  Drained off the excess fat, added the drained beans and corn and salsa.  After layering the beef mixture over the corn tortillas, I spread the sour cream and sprinkled the shredded cheese ( I used a combine mixture of sharp chedder and Jack).  I than added the chopped tomates, chopped green onions and sliced black olives, I thought the presentation would be better, then just a layer of cheese.  I was right!

This was so great because I normally have everthing in the house.  This will also be good for a large group, I know I will be making it for a church potluck!

Had the students in my survival cooking class make this recipe.  Most of them enjoyed it.  I thought the tortilla chips, which lined the bottom, tasted too dry.  Would probably add more ground beef also.

I make this every few months with a couple of tweaks,2 lbs lean ground beef, I use black beans{drained and rinsed} in the meat mixture along with a touch of hot salsa,can of chopped green chilis{undrained},some chili powder and a packet of taco seasoning{starts with "O",middle name"EL" last name "P"} yellow packet with red letters original} to give it a kick. Also I make a big 9x13 pan size with double layers so I spray the pan, spread out crushed corn tortilla chips, warmed up{makes easier to spread}refried beans, the meat mixture, the sour cream and toppings, Mexican shredded cheese, then repeat the layers with corn chips and ending with the cheese{we omit the olives}. So I just double the amount of ingredients to make the double layers My family loves this recipe and we are so grateful you shared it.

This was delicious and so easy!  You can add so much to it and make it even better but it's just a great meal for the family.  I used other reviewers suggestions and did the taco seasoning and added green chilis and wow, it just made it have so much more zing to it. Highly recommend this recipe!

This was very tasty.  I want to make one comment about some of the other reviews.  Many complained that the tortillas were soft after baking.  This is a casserole.  If you want crunchy chips, make nachos.  I used a double layer of whole chips (the dense Mexican style kind), and added the toppings as indicated in the recipe, after cooking the beef with onions and fajita seasoning.  The chips actually resembled a soft corn tortilla after cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed others advice and changed a few things and it was great.  Black beans instead of chili..used bite size chips without crushing..didn't cook the sour cream but layered it ontop after cooking and cooling then sprinkled more cheese on top of that..used 3/4 cup fresh tomato instead of 1/2...added taco seasoning/water to meat mixture along with salsa and can of rotel with green chili peppers when simmering ...and lastly used shredded mexican cheese (mixed bag from walmart)....I cooked for 30min like recipe said but believe next time I would cook only 15-20..

This is FANTASTIC!!! Honestly, when I saw the great reviews I thought, "Really? It looks to simple to be that delicious!" but my gosh is it!!! Yum! I left out the olives completely just because I don't like them and added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning to the meat as it was browning. I only used 2 cups of crushed tortilla chips and that was plenty. Use the chili beans; no, it doesn't seem 'Mexican-y' but it adds a great flavor. I doubled the green onion because I love it and it really tastes so good in this dish. I used a mix of cheddar and taco blend cheese on top. The only change I will be making for next time is to leave out the sour cream. When it baked it got an almost dry, 'curdled' like texture that I wasn't a fan of. I will just serve it at the table to dollop on top as I love dour cream and like the way the coolness of it offsets spicier Mexican dishes, but this us just my preference. What a great, easy casserole...Thanks so much for it!!! :)

I love this! Added 1T of taco seasoning as others did, also added a can of Rotel with salsa and simmered long enough to thicken up before baking. Omitted olives. Was going to freeze some, but too good-never made it to freezer. Good leftovers to take to work. Definitely in my top 5 on this site. Thank u!

Great recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The only big adjustment I made was using plain greek yogurt (Oikos, 1 1/2 cups) instead of the sour cream -- also cuts the calories by 200, and the fat grams by around 40g!!  I also used 1 cup of shredded cheddar, which I felt like was plenty, and canned diced tomatoes (since I didn't have fresh!) My husband loved loved loved this dish!

This recipe is similar to one my family has enjoyed for years...Mexican Lasagna.  The ingredients are virtually the same but instead of tortilla chips, flat flour tortillas (6) are halved.  Put the first 6 halves on the bottom of the dish, followed by half the beef mixture and cheese and then another layer of the remaining tortilla halves.  The balance of the beef mixture and cheese tops it off.

This was a very easy recipe to make, and it was very open to adaptation.  I did not have green onions, so I substituted red and white onions.  I did not have tortilla chips, but I had plenty of corn tortillas, and I just made my own.  In addition to layering them on the bottom, I also topped the casserole with extra crushed chips after cooking.  This really helped because the chips at the bottom of the casserole got soggy.  Canned tomatoes (I used some with chiles mixed in) work great in place of the fresh tomatoes.  It only took about 10 minutes to cook, as opposed to the 30 stated in the recipe.  This recipe became an instant favorite in our household.  We will definitely make this casserole again!

We enjoyed this and will be making it again.  I think next time I will crush tortilla chips and put thm on top once the casserole is out of the oven to give it some "crunch".

I made this as is the first time. Thought it was a bit bland. Next time used taco seasoning, garlic powder, and added some rotel (drained). I also used Mexican blend cheese. The first time I made this it was a bit soggy, so I made the tortilla layer a little thicker and cut back on the sour cream. Easy dish to make and a family favorite at my house. I serve with Mexican rice and a Mexican salad.

After reading reviews, I tried this with some changes; Instead of tortilla chips, I used flour tortillas, in two layers, like a lasagna. I cooked the groud beef with garlic, green onions and a pack of taco powder, and I added a can of corn and 7-8 slices of finely chopped jalapeno to the recipe. 
So I put it together as follows, flour tortillas, 1/2 meat mixture, 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 tomatoes & green onions, repeat layering and top with mexican shredded cheese.
Although I love black olives, next time I'll leave them out of this recipe.

Doubled the recipe for a pot luck at work and it was a huge hit!!!!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Made the following changes to the original recipe for 6:  added can of chopped chilies, little garlic and Taco Seasoning Mix to the meat mixture.  Really cooked the liquid out of the meat (longer than 20 minutes at a lower temp).  Lightly smashed the taco chips in the bag so there were some larger pieces........did not turn out soggy at all.  It was wonderful.  Making it again this weekend for the family.

The family loved this. I did add a package of taco seasoning to the beef and used canned Rotel tomatoes with chili peppers instead of diced tomatoes on top. They asked to put this one on the regular rotation.

My husband declared it a keeper. I loved being able to use up the tortilla chip crumbs in the bottom of the bag instead of tossing them out.  Used turkey sausage instead of ground beef, and 2 cups of left over refried beans. Fabuloso!

Fabulous dish! And so easy too. I used ground  turkey meat and low fat sour cream to make it less caloric. Worked fine. Also used drained canned tomatoes cuz I didn't have fresh. Used black beans in the cooked turkey meat. Also added onions and chili seasoning to the meat as many reveiwers suggested. My husband couldn't get over how delicios this was and asked for it to be in the regular (frequent) rotation.

Love it!  My family actually fought over the leftover portions!  Teens pleading that it be made again.  I call that a winner!

The key to non-soggy chips is draining the mixture and ridding it of excess moisture! :o)

Doubled it for a family gathering on Cinco de Mayo and everyone wanted the recipe--even the toddlers ate it and asked for more.  In fairness, I gave the original recipe 5 stars even though, based on prior reviews, I altered while doubling:  added chopped onion, garlic, salt & pepper when browning meat; added a pkg of OLP Taco Seasoning(use half a pkg or less if not doubling); used a can each of black beans AND kidney beans (use one can if not doubling); added a can of GG Mexicorn; put crushed tortilla chips on the bottom AND top; used thin layer of sour cream and served the rest on the side; served black olives on the side instead of putting in the casserole (wasn't sure if everyone liked them); served salsa and guacamole on the side.  I used T*** Original chips and they didn't get soggy, but I think that may be because I used a thick jarred salsa that didn't produce a lot of liquid in the meat mixture.  If using a fresh watery salsa, you will need to cook down or drain off excess liquid from the meat mixture before assembling casserole.  Don't omit the green onions or chopped tomatoes--they are key to the taste and texture.  Again, I suspect the recipe is worth 5 stars as is for those who are looking for a mild casserole, but it can easily be altered for those looking for even more flavor.  This is an easy, favorful dish perfect for a small family dinner or adapting for a large gathering.  Definitely a keeper!

Yum. This was a big hit at my potluck. It was the first main dish that was GONE. I doubled the recipe.... Made a HUGE pan and another smaller one for my family. I added chopped onions to the ground beef.... And used some doritos mixed in with the regular tortilla chips. Absolutely delicious. My entire family wants me to make this again.

This is a wonderful, basic recipe that can be adjusted to suit your individual tastes and what you have on hand.  Made as written, it is easy & tasty, though a bit bland. The second time I made it, I added 2T taco seasoning (from this site), 1/2 c. each of chopped green pepper & onion, and 1 large, minced garlic clove when browning the meat. I only had refried beans, so crossed my fingers & added them in place of the chili beans.  I also only had 1c. sour cream, so mixed it with 1c. of mayonaise and crossed some more fingers!  It came out amazing!  It needed to sit about 20 minutes before serving to soak up the liquid, but it was REALLY good!  Even better the next day.  My adult son had 2 helpings for breakfast. (I am NOT that brave.) Though I probably don't want to know the nutritionals for the adaptation, I have moved the recipe to my favorites box.  Thanks, ANDREALF63!

You can also skip the oven and make this into an even easier and faster meal.  Prepare the meat, put the chips, sour cream, olives, green onion, tomato, and cheddar cheese out on the counter and let everyone prepare their own nacho supremes.

I loved this dish. Followed suggestions about taco seasoning (I added about 1/3 packet), Rotel canned tomatoes (I used the ones with added mild chilis), less chips (1 1/2 cup is plenty), and packaged Mexican  blend shredded cheese.  I do think it is very important what kind of salsa you select. I used Santa Barbara Mango Peach Salsa by Sabra--in the refrigerated section of the supermarket.  Lovely fruity flavor with just a pinch of a kick.  This dish as described is perfect for those liking a mild version. Do prepare meat mixture ahead of time so seasoning can be absorbed and drain grease from hamburger before mixing.

Hey, this was pretty tasty! I browned up my ground beef, seasoned with taco powder, garlic powder and ground chipotle pepper and onion flakes.  I've been dealing with a sinus infection so I was too lazy to do all the layering...put the chips down, topped with beef mixture, tons of cheese, mixed everything else together poured that over the cheese, crushed more chips on top and mounded tons of cheese on that. Diet...out the window!!  Anyway..it was so tasty..the old man really like it...that's a good thing, cuz there's tons of it left!!  One thing, I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used one can Rotel and another can of fire roasted tomatoes with green chili. YUM! And TONS of green onions...love 'em.

OMG!  This is good.  I made it pretty much to the recipe.  I did make a few changes based on some suggestions.  I only used 1 cup of salsa, which seemed plenty.  I added a can of corn, and used a can of diced tomatoes with chilis in it.  I mixed the vegetables, minus the beans, together like a salad, and spread that over the sour cream.  I added some cilantro and lime juice to the veggies for a little added southwest flavor.

My only problem with the recipe is the chips for the bottom layer.  It tasted good, but they didn't stick together when I spooned it out.  Might try some flour tortillas next time.

I was looking for some easy Mexican dinner, then I read the ingredients... Mexicans didn't use chili beans, sour cream, black olives or cheddar cheese on their original recipes. Sad.

I made a similar casserole years and years ago - I always put the chips on top then sprinkled the cheese over the chips - I didn't crush the chips either (optional) - when you do it this way the chips turn out crispy not soggy!  I'm giving the recipe 5 stars even before making it because this recipe is virtually the same as mine (except for the sour cream & black olives & I just used dark kidney beans but the concept is the same)  and when I made it my kids and husband loved it!

This was DELICIOUS! I've made several mexican casseroles before and this is by FAR the best! The sour cream and green onions is what makes this one stand out far above the others. I also adapted this recipe as others have by using a bit of taco seasoning when browning the ground beef (don't use too much,though, or it will end up too salty) and using drained canned tomatoes. Yum! This made plenty for our family of 3, so I froze the leftovers and defrosted them for lunches and it's even better! Definitely recommend this one!!!

This was o.k., but needs some tweaking.  It was kind of dry and the sour cream baked into a weird texture.  I may make it again and try adding some enchilada sauce to make it a little saucier, and may try substituting cottage cheese for the sour cream and then just serve it with sour cream since it doesn't bake well.

My Family LOVED this.  This will be a frequently prepared family dinner.  Even my picky kids gobbled it up.  I used whole grain tortilla chips.  Even re-heated it was excellent!  No changes necessary.  Very easy, too!

Great dish.  I made this about a month ago and it's now in my regular routine.  Also great to fry up in a skillet with scrambled eggs the next morning... sorta like a gringo's chilaqules.

I make this for my 94-year-old father whenever I visit him, at his request, & it's my fall-back casserole for any occasion that asks for some jolliness.  I often substitute chicken breasts for hamburger, black beans for chili beans, & go heavier on olives, green onions & tomatoes.  It's a great basic recipe to play with!

Made this for dinner tonight.  Was absolutely delicious.  Had to make some changes due to personal preferences and what I had on hand.  1) Added taco seasoning per other reviewers, 1/2 chopped bell pepper, 1/2 chopped onion and 1 tbs minced garlic to the meat as it was browning.  2) Stirred in 1/2 cup salsa, 1 can drained black beans and 1 can diced tomatoes into the meat mixture to simmer 3) Skipped the tomatoes and onions on the top, just put meat mixture on top of the crushed tortilla chips (I used enough to cover the bottom of the pan - didn't measure), covered that with sour cream and tossed on the olives.  Sprinkled cheese over top and then sprinkled the cheese liberally with chili powder.  Everyone went back for seconds!  Will definitely be making this again.

This turned out very good. My husband doesn't like sour cream, but he did like it in this dish. Next time however, I think I'll skip putting the chips in the bottom, little soggy, and crush them in our plates and then put the casserole on top.

Super delish. Sauteed chopped onion with the ground turkey, added a bit of garlic and a bit of taco seasoning. Poured in the jar o salsa. I also used rinsed black beans instead of chili beans (since that's what I had on hand) and added in some diced jalapenos from my garden. I probably used about 1 cup of grated cheese.

I layered corn tortillas in the casserole to make it just like a little Mexican lasagna, and baked. My family gobbled it up so fast that there was not a scrap of leftovers! We will definitely make this again. Could try a couple different types of beans - chili beans, as called for, or refried. Could also perhaps add a can of green chiles, or whatever else tickles your fancy. Very versatile recipe, just like Italian lasagna - the flavors meld together really well.

If I don't make this for gatherings on the weekends with friends...I was told I would NOT be allowed in the door! =D  HAHA.. They only love me for the Mexican Casserole... DIP!

Absolutely amazing!  This dish had amazing flavor.  I served it with extra tortilla chips on the side which also got gobbled up and I took the suggestions of other reviewers and seasoned it with taco seasoning and changed out the chili beans for black beans.  Really and truly delicious though!  There were leftovers so hopefully tomorrow this dish will be even more amazing.

Great recipe, very quick and easy. Adaptable too! I sauteed a chopped onion with the beef, added a bit of fajita seasoning, and when I added the beans I also added a can of drained corn. Served it with crushed tortilla chips on top. Next time I'll make it with ground turkey and I bet it will be just as good!

We absolutely loved this! I also used taco seasoning, which I made from this website, Taco Seasoning I. I had no problems with soggy chips but I also used Pace thick and chunky salsa that didn't have a lot of juice. The salsa and beef mixture did not even have to simmer to long! In fact, the chips were crispy!

Yummers!
I wasn't sure how this would turn out in terms of both taste and eye appeal as it was cooking,  but we scooped it over lettuce and it made one of the best taco salads I've ever had- the meat actually stayed hot!  I took the suggestions of many others and added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning to the gr. beef, omitted the gr. onion, chili beans, olives, and tomato. Instead used black beans, green chiles and a can of diced tomatoes.  1 to 1 1/2 cups of sour cream is plenty.  Our whole family ate it up.

I seasoned my ground beef with taco seasoning. My husband Loved it - I also thought it was good. I have never used crushed tortilla chips in a casserole before.I really did not care for that part of it.If I make this again I will skip the tortilla chips.

I used unsalted tortilla chips, low fat sour cream, low fat cheddar cheese, and low fat mozzarella cheese.
My husband and I agree that taco seasoning should be added to the ground beef.
If I make this again, I will be adding it!

My picky family loved this dish. - one suggestion, don't scatter too many chips on the bottom of the dish. Scatter some of the chips throughout the hamburger mixture. In my dish, they were a little too clumpy on the bottom. BUT, the dish was delicious just the same. -

Sort of like a King Ranch Casserole with beef.  My family loved this.  I wasn't quite sure about the layering of ingredients, but it actually turned out quite well.  The only thing I might change next time is to save some of the black olives, tomatoes, and green onions to sprinkle on top of the cheese the last five minutes of baking to have a better presentation than just a casserole of melted cheese.  Like other reviewers, I added taco seasoning to the  beef mixture.  My only recommendation is to make sure you make only enough for your family to eat in one sitting.  Our re-heated leftovers for lunch the next day did not even compare.  I am not sure if the chips soaked up some of the juices or what happened.  But, our leftovers were dry and crumbly and just not that good.  The night before though, right out of the oven, the casserole was delicious!

THe flavor in this meal is quite good.  I had a problem with the crushed chips at the bottom.  The recipe calls for cooking all the fluid off the salsa and draining the beans.  Then cooking till "bubbly".  Well without fluid, mine never bubbled.  THe chips on the bottom were a mess.

If I do it again I will leave some fliud in the mixture, maybe add some enchilada sauce.  With no liquid the chips have nothing to soak up.

This was very good! I used refried beans instead of kidney beans and I poured about 1/2 of a can of Mild Enchilada sause over the top. I also used taco seasoning in the meat. This was just great and I will cook it again soon. Make sure the chips are completely covered in meat and cheese or they tend to become stale.

Love this, did make a few changes!!!  When cooking meat (I used half ground sausage and half ground turkey) add a packet of taco seasoning, 1/2 cup onions diced, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 1/2 cup corn (I used frozen corn), 1 can rotel, 1 can black beans drained (I used those instead of other beans)  salt and pepper to taste. "Recipe will come out bland if other spices are not added" I like mine spicey so crushed red and a couple drops Texas Pete went into mine :) Also I did not add the sour cream into it left that on the side. I also used wheat tortillas instead of chips hold together better. Love this and makes a great family meal. Happy Cooking :)

wow. still puzzled as to why this recipe has so many good reviews!  I found this recipe after looking for something to make with the ground beef I had on hand and based on the reviews, I thought this was just what I was looking for...I was SO wrong!  Followed recipe but added taco seasoning as recommended by many reviewers.  The chips at the bottom were a soggy mess.  The sour cream curdled.  It was so bland even with the taco seasoning!

I absolutely loved this recipe to start with. I gave it four stars because I changed it a bit to suit my families taste-buds. 

1. Removed Green Onions (There are enough in the salsa)
2. Needs about 1/2 the sour cream unless you want it to overpower the taste.
3. Used black beans because I didn't have the chili beans. They were amazing substitues.
4. Added taco seasoning.
5. Added about 2/3 can of corn to the meat/beans, and the rest to the top of the sour cream.


My family devoured this recipe. Even my picky 6 year old ate her whole plate once I got her to try it. I think it's versatile enough for you to add your favorite salsa and vegetables without changing the taste too much.

This was pretty good. It is super economical. For health reasons, I will probably not use chips again on the bottom, maybe some high fiber tortillas instead. We skipped the black olives. Overall, we thought it was quite good and it made really good leftovers.

The casserole was good overall but the chips were soggy.  I made this a second time and left out the chips and then added more ingredients (corn, green chilis, etc.) and it was fantastic!  A great recipe to have because you can alter based on your taste.

I love this recipe but am on weight watchers so I dont add the sour cream into the mix. I use very lean beef and add canned tomatoes w/mexican style herbs, canned black beans, corn, salsa, enchilada sauce, diced & canned green chilies. Let the beef and tomato mixure simmer for about 15 min.  Use corn tortillas. Layer everything and top with light cheddar. Add light our cream at the end : )

I made this recipe as written.  I did not care for it.  It was a bit expensive to make and the flavors did not blend.  It might be better with alterations as others have reviewed and rated high but as written I will not make again.

This is an amazing and simple meal. I made a few moderations- I cook the hamburger and have used chicken as well, mix it with salsa and let it cook atleast 5 minutes. Place the mixture ontop of the crushed chips(with a little cheese on top of the chips) and top with Sour cream and cheese and cook. It is amazing with tortilla chips and Guacamole!!!

Although I liked the casserole, I wasn't a huge fan of the crushed tortilla chips on the bottom. I think this dish would be better off without the chips and rather served in tostadas or inside taco shells.

This recipe is fantastic as is!! However, I wanted to make it somewhat healthier with the following modifications:  1.) I used ground turkey. I cooked the turkey then added a taco season packet and cooked per packet directions. 2.) Instead of sour cream, I used fat free greek yogurt. I didn't have a full 2 cups, so I added some fat free cream cheese. I whipped the yogurt, cream cheese, and some jalapeno slices together....fantastic! It gave that layer so much flavor!! 3.) I also used black beans, rotel with green chilies, and fat-free cheese!! 4.) Finally, I baked my own corn tortilla chips. So good, I am full but want to keep eating!

OMG - love this recipe!  Very versitile.  You don't need to use the exact ingredients for it to be delicious. I healthified it by using soft corn tortillas instead of tortilla chip, ground turkey instead of beef, plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and low fat cheese. I added another layer of corn tortillas before putting the cheese on.  I will make this recipe again and again.  The whole family loved it!

This was really easy and pretty good. The only reason it received 4 stars from me, is that my kids and myself were not crazy with the sour cream. It just had a weird texture after being baked. I think next time I will just serve it on the side. Other then that it was fantastic!

Very easy & yummy.  BUT I also made some modifications after reviewing the other reviews.   I did add a packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef with a 1/2 c of water and also some chopped onion.  I used black beans instead of chili beans, and for the sour cream mixture I used 1-1/2 c of sour cream & 1/2 c of ranch dressing, just to give it a little zing & the sour cream seemed not to be so "gloppy" after being cooked by adding the ranch, also.  I also chopped some fresh cilantro & sprinkled in the layers & also on top for some garnish.  I used a Mexican blend shredded cheese (because that's what I like).   The crushed tortilla chips were okay on the first serving, but with leftovers they turned mushy...But I had some partial bags of chips I wanted to get rid of, so that's what I used as the recipe called for.  It might be better with just using whole corn or flour tortillas next time.

This recipe doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't.  If you look at the ingredients, you know what you'll get!  It could use a little more oomph to it, as many have stated.  It is a good place for new cooks with younger children to start their cooking experience.  For others, it's a good starting place.

This was very easy and delicious to boot!  It made way too much, so I would cut the recipe in half and use a smaller pan.  Serving size said for 6, but it is more like for 8.  And there's just 3 of us!

Thanks for this great recipe. I made it for New Years eve at our house with 4 couples. It was a big hit even tho I served the sour cream on the side and mixed refried beans into the hamb mixture instead of kidney beans as I know one of our friends doesn't like them. Our sons say it's a keeper recipe for sure too!!  I served the chips on the side as well. Thanks again.

This was very easy to make.  3 cups of crushed chips was way too much.  Next time I'll cut it down to 1 3/4 cup.  I changed the recipe a bit by adding corn, black beans and taco seasoning replacing the black olives and chili beans. Since I didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand, I used canned diced tomatoes, drained.  It came out tasting great!!

I loved the flavor of this casserole.  I think it was the chili beans that made it different from others I've tried.  Per a previous review I added green chilis to the sour cream.  I also added the tomatoes after it had cooked so they would add a little crunch.  I was worried about the chips getting soggy so I put half on the bottom and half on the top.  It was great!

I altered this meal to make it lower in fat by using fat free cheddar cheese and omitting the sour cream. I served it with yellow corn on the side. Very good, very fast!

This was so easy and delicious! I did change it up a bit by adding one can of chopped green chilies, 1 cup salsa, one can diced tomatoes with zesty green chilies.  I didn't have tortilla chips so I lined the bottom of the 9X13 with flour soft taco shells, then did a thin layer of meat, topped with some shredded taco cheese, then another layer of the flour tortilla shells, another thin layer of the meat and the rest of the shredded cheese, then baked it for about 20-25 minutes.  I used the sour cream on the side.  It was awesome and now I have some leftovers for lunch!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is easy and the taste is soooo good. We ate it twice in one week, which is rare for us! I fried up the ground beef together with a chopped onion and some taco seasoning for extra flavour. I used a can of mexican-style kidney beans. I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream to make it a bit healthier. Surprisingly, this dish freezes and reheats nicely. As some other reviewers have mentioned, this would make a delicious nacho chip dip for parties although it was a hearty dinner as well.

My boyfriend LOVED this!  Followed as written, but used black beans instead of chili beans.  Delicious :)  Will use again and again!

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used a packet of taco seasoning.  The taste of the meat mixture was okay but, overall, I didn't like it.  The sour cream separated because it was heated, and I didn't like the consistency of the "broken" chips.  They almost had a chewy, stale taste.  A lot of the chips didn't stick to the casserole.  I doubt that I'd make this version, again.

Made exactly as specified.  Easy and yummy.  Used chili beans with a spicy sauce so maybe that jazzed it up a bit.  Not sure how healthy is it with the 2 cups each of cheese and sour cream - maybe that is why it was so tasty. I did drain the fat off the meat before adding the salsa and beans - that is worth something.

This was a great dish! I followed the recipe exactly with a few additions. I added taco seasoning to beef and cilantro to the sour cream.  I added some frozen corn to the beef and beans as well. Lastly, I chopped some extra cilantro, green onion and tomato as garnish along with some avacado...I would definately recommend adding a little avacado as garnish! Will make again!!

I have made this quite often - easy to make, and a delicious quick go-to recipe.  I often add a can of green chilies, and whenever I don't have chili beans I use refried beans instead. Love it!

Followed the recipe. This is good. It's not fantastic but you can jazz it up and make it your own kind of fantastic by adding your favorite ingredients. As is, it is a 4-star recipe.

My 11-year old Girl Scouts chose this dish to cook for our potluck dinner.  They said it was delicious and gave it 5 stars, of course.  They made it exactly by the recipe.  I think it would be extra tasty if they added taco mix as some others have said.  We were unsure about the can of "chili beans"... did that mean a can of "chili with beans" or the kind of beans you put in chili - as in kidney beans?  We went with the latter.  Either way, they ate it up and thought it was great!

For those that thought this was too much chips, i do see it says three cups, crushed (as opposed to 3 cups crushed chips).  So three cups of chips crushed yields about 1 cup. I'm making this for the first time and hoping i have enough chips, as opposed to too much. Did anyone else feel 3 cups of chips (i.e. 1 cup crushed) wasn't enough? I plan to add more if it doesn't cover bottom of pan.

This is one of my favorite dishes.  I do use ground turkey instead of ground beef, and black beans instead of chili beans.  I also chop up a whole big tomato instead of using just half a cup.  Love it though, and I make it often.

first time making and no left-overs.  I used rotels diced tomatoes with green chilies and substituted black bean instead of chili beans.  Also, topped with extra salsa when serving....definitely a keeper.

My husband & I loved this (and I'm not big on Mexican food).  I used what I had on hand, following some of what other reviewers used.  I replaced the green onions with a regular chopped onion which I browned with the hamburger and taco seasoning; I also added garlic powder too.  I used light kidney beans and drained petite tomatoes.  We love cheese so I used leftover cheddar cheese (about 3/4 cup) and 2 cups of grated Mexican blend cheese. Omitted black olives since hubby hates them.  Good? My husband ate half the casserole in one sitting and I finished a good-sized plate myself (and I'm not one to eat much in one sitting).  This dish hit the spot! Thanks submitter. This is a keeper!!

I did add the packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef and reduced the crushed tortilla chips to 1 1/2 cup as others suggested. Used shredded Colby Jack, not cheddar on top. Everything else as the recipe called for. My hubby said I could just make this every night and he would be happy! Next day for lunch, co-worker said it was the best casserole she'd ever tasted and got the recipe! REALLY GOOD!!!

I thought this was wonderful! I didn't have any ground beef so I just shredded some chicken breasts and used that. My three year old (who doesn't like anything but poptarts) asked for thirds!!! Amazing!!

I'm compromising between my rating and my husband's! I enjoyed it, but my opinion was it wasn't good enough to warrant all the calories.  Hubs went out of his way to tell me how amazing it was, and that NEVER happens! So, I guess if you don't mind the fat and calories this one's a winner!  I added a packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef as I was cooking it, and I used a can of kidney beans since that's all I had on hand. The green onions are important to the flavor, and if I made it again I might even add a little extra!

We liked this, but it lacked something I can't quite put my finger on.  The chips as a bottom layer was kind of a waste - turned totally soggy.  I almost skipped the chips and just baked this as a dip, but I decided to do it as written at the last minute.  Won't use chips again.  Tortillas or nothing at all, but the you couldn't even taste the chips they were such a soggy mess.  I added something extra (green chiles, homemade taco spice?) that made this too spicy for the kids, but no fault of the recipes I'm pretty sure.  My sour cream layer also curdled and looked pretty unappealing - next time I'd just mix it with the meat layer to prevent this.  All in all, we ate this pretty much as chip dip, and it was tasty.  I'd tweak a few things next time.  Used ground turkey and low fat cheese and sour cream and couldn't tell a difference at all.  A good standby with some tweaking.

Great recipe and full of flavor.  I made a few changes just to make it a tad healthier & to suit taste preferences.  Used ground chicken & sauteed with sweet onion. Added 1 McCormicks taco seasoning packet to the meat mixture when adding the salsa. Used reduced fat sour cream & whole wheat tortilla chips.  Omitted the green onion & fresh tomato.

big hit and great way to use up stale chips, I used black beans instead of chili beans, Rotel instead of salsa, added frozen corn and tomato sauce, omitted olives, green onion and tomatoes, used half the sour cream and cheese called for, great way to clean out the pantry!

Delicious as written. My son stated that he will take this easy-to-make recipe back with him, to make for his college roommates.  Nuff said.

Super easy, which is what I need this time of year.  I made this with the meat from Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Meat recipe from this site.  I added one can of kidney beans to the meat with about 1 cup of salsa and a can of tomatoes (that's all I had) and didn't bake with the sour cream.  Came out great and everyone kept going back for seconds.  Thanks!

My husband and I absolutely LOVED this recipe! The only additions I made to it was that I chopped up some green and red peppers, onions, and used black beans instead of chili beans. It was fab-o!! Thank you for this new addition to our family recipes!!

This was just okay for me. I didn't have plain tortilla chips on hand, so I used taco-flavored Doritos, which was a flavorful touch. Even with the two cups of salsa, I thought the casserole could use more tomatoes. I'll try a layer of diced tomatoes next time. I'd recommend saving the sour cream to be used as a topping instead of baking it with the rest of the casserole, because it looks grainy being cooked. I would also use refried beans instead of chili beans, add more veggies, like corn, along with diced tomatoes. Whatever you can do to infuse more of those Mexican flavors into your cooking, like adding Taco seasoned cheese and chips, do it - otherwise, the casserole is somewhat bland. As I was eating this, I kept thinking that a layer of cornbread with jalapenos on top might be a good addition. Really, it all boils down to using your imagination and preferences, but I wanted more of those bold Mexican flavors in there.

Today was the second time I've made this dish. I changed a few things after the first time. I used flour tortillas, instead of chips on the bottom (chips came too soggy the first time) and did everything else as written in the original recipe, except I served the sour cream on the side. I crushed the chips and sprinkled them on the top of the cheese and baked. The crunch added a great texture. Oh, as others said, I used taco seasoning in the meat.

I made this last night.  I was expecting wow...but it was just so-so.  The tortilla chips were soggy, they might as well have not been there, they had no taste.  I added taco seasoning to the meat...The entire dish just tasted like a taco.  I probably would not make this again.  The picture looked sooo good...I was disappointed.

Wow!!!  So easy to prepare and every bite tastes just a little different than the one before.  A wonderful balance of flavours.  I sprinkled a little Cilantro over the sour cream for just a little something different.

Made tonight!  So easy and good!  Just used black beans because that is what I had.  I also added taco seasoning but probably won't need to next time because of salsa.  Kids loved it! Will definatley make again!

It was okay, kind of bland. I used taco seasoning as well as a can of rotel tomatoes and green chiles (undrained). I didn't like it much but my husband really enjoyed it. I'm sure next time I make it I'll add more things to it. This could be a great casserole if the seasoning was right.

I ate WAY too much of this! Husband and I loved it! I wanted something delicious that would be a great leftover, and this fit the bill. I did what others suggested and added black beans and a can of Rotel. it would have been perfect with or without (I just love me some black beans!). This is one of those meals you'll have seconds of, then lounge around full and satisfied. Or in my case, way too full because you have to keep on eating it... YUM!

Make sure to cook the meat and salsa mixture down enough so it won't be runny. The tortilla chips are supposed to get mushy, kind of like a tamale at the bottom. Don't drain the chili beans for more flavor. Add half a bag of southwest vegetable mix (corn, black beans, peppers) to the meat mixture. Leave out the sour cream layer because it curdles during cooking, and just add sour cream when you serve it. Serve it with Cholula (or your favorite brand) hot sauce! Good for a family dinner or potluck.

Made it the way the recipe said and it was good. The only thing I would change is, I would not use chips for the bottom. Instead I will make the recipe the way it said and put it over rice. Good recipe though.

I made this a ton healthier. I placed 16 tortilla chips at the bottom of the pan, used ground turkey, a can of rinsed black beans, fat free sour cream, fresh tomatoes, olives, and diced chilis on top.  I also added 1/2 a cup of cheddar cheese on it.  The whole recipe equalled 1600 calories, so i dived it into 4 servings!

This casserole is absolutely scrumptious!  My family loved it!  I used low-fat baked tortilla chips and low-fat sour cream to lessen the calorie and fat content, and it still turned out perfect.  I used the black beans, but I think the pinto beans would be good too.

Big hit on the home-front... husband and teenage son thought it was the bomb.  I added a layer of roasted hatch chilies because I wanted to use them up and get some more...  I'd recommend that!  You could get the same effect with a can of green chilies.  Still good the next day as leftovers, but not quite the same with soggy chip crumbs.

This was a really yummy casserole. I used a homemade salsa that was pretty hot. Do remember that most of your flavor is coming from the salsa you use so use a good one. I put some peppers and onions in the meat while I browned it. I really didn't see a need to add taco seasoning as others have. I also didn't have any fresh tomatos so I used some well drained canned rotel I had lurking in the fridge. I also think that 3 cups of chips is a proper amount as mine soaked up all the wonderful juice from the meat mixture. All in all this is something I will make again as we really enjoyed it.

Firstly, I must say that I love mexican food. The recipe itself was a bit bland so I took some of the advice from other members. To the ground beef I added the taco seasoning which was a plus, because this recipe does not call for any seasoning. I am from the bahamas and we like seasoned food. I also added a jabanero pepper to the ground beef as it cooked...love the heat. I also added jalepenos to the toppings to give it that extra kick. I thought this was such an enjoyable meal. P.s. The chips were to get soggy so as to form the crust on the bottom giving it flavor, for all the others that thought the chips were to wet.

I give it 5 stars on taste, but 4 stars overall because it needed a few changes and is not a main dish but makes you think it is one.   Very, very yummy, but not a main dish.  This should be called a Hearty Mexican Dip.  It is fantastic and I will make it again, but the whole family ended up eating it by scooping it up with chips.    Next time I will leave the chips off the bottom (they were soggy) and just serve it with chips for scooping and eating. Very good flavor!!   My changes = I left off the green onions & olives and added canned sliced jalapenos. I cooked the meat with 1/2 pkt taco seasoning and onion powder. :)

This is a very good basic recipe; however, as others have said, it needs some additions.  To the ground beef mixture, I also added a can of green chilis, a can of Rotel, 2 tsp. cumin, and a half a package of taco seasoning.  Then I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  We enjoyed this alot and the leftovers were even better!

we really enjoyed this recipe. i used black beans in place of chili beans, 1 can of diced tomatoes with chiles drained, and shredded mexican blend cheese. i also used one pack of taco seasoning on the ground beef before adding the salsa. this was very easy although a little time consuming. we will definently be having this again. thank you for the recipe.

This has become one of our family favorites! The first time I made it however, I didn't have any chili beans on hand so instead I used one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans, and I have been making it like that ever since.  I also made the following changes: I browned the meat in taco seasoning (no water, just the mix), Instead of 2 full cups salsa, I just added 1 jar Pace Picante Sauce, I put one layer of chips at the bottom of the pan, then added the mix & sour cream and on top of that I added crumbled up chips and cheese, covered baked, and then added the onions, tomatoes and olives (and a little more sour cream to those who wanted it), when I served it.  We probably have this dish once a month now!  Tyvm for the recipe, we love it!!

Family LOVED this. I didn't put chips in, served them with it. Also tried serving over brown rice...GREAT! I used less salsa and added half a package of taco seasoning!
12/09 update...Made this with leftover rotisserie chicken, with same adjustments as last time....turned out great!!!!

Very good! I didn't have corn chips so I used flour tortillas which I tore up and layered on the bottom. Didn't measure the onions, tomato or olives; just chopped/sliced and threw them on. I did cover the dish for the first 20 minutes. This was even better the next day! It reheated great in the nuker.

Used mexican cheese blend, both flour and corn torillas (cut and blended into wedge slices forming layer) into two layers.  I also used taco seasoning for the meat with a little chilli powder for some slight kick.

This was just average of a casserole to me.  But I took it to a potluck at work and it was well received.  I used a packet of taco seasoning as well.  I thought the broken tortilla chips did not add a lot to the dish.  However, it was easy to put together.

This should be called AWESOME MEXICAN CASSEROLE cause that's what it was! Soooo good! This may be one of the best dishes I've ever made. Wouldn't change a thing. It was perfect. My husband loved it as well. My kids were a little pickier simply because they're not fans of sour cream, but they just ate around it. This will be made again and again.

Delicious casserole.  Relatively easy to make and very easy to modify to suit your tastes.  I added corn, onion and taco mix along with the salsa while cooking the meat, and I used black beans instead of chili beans.  I also used some canned green chilies in the layering and used more cheese than recommended... it turned out great.  My wife says its her favorite casserole I've made (I'm on a casserole kick).

Very good recipe -- my  4 and 6 year old liked it.  I used the taco seasoning in the meat mixture like others did (I made the package as directed with 2/3 c. water).  I added the powdered taco seasoning and the water at the same time as the salsa. I did not use chili beans because I misunderstood and got green chilies instead.  But, it turned out great without the chili beans, I'm assuming that the recipe is calling for kidney beans, which I'll try next time.

If you're like me and you have to trick your family into eating lower fat things, this is a great recipe for that.  I used low-fat sour cream and you absolutely could not tell.  Next time, I'm going to try it with ground turkey like the original poster suggested.  Also, instead of crushed tortilla chips on the bottom, I put (actually, my 6 year old did, this is also a great recipe for the kids to help) anyway, we put two layers of bite sized tortilla chips on the bottom.  Some of them turned out slightly soggy, but it was pretty good.  I served this with scoop sized tortilla chips and the kids loved that. 

Great recipe, thanks!

This was very good, but as is, it wasn't spicy/flavorful enough. To make it s "5" for my family, I need to add some diced jalapenos ( prefer fresh) to the burger and bean mixture, and double the onions, olives and green onions. Otherwise, it goes together quickly, tastes good, and appeals to kids and adults at my house.

This recipe provides a good base for customization.  I skipped the black olives, and used 2 cups of tortilla chips instead of three.  I added red pepper and various other seasonings, plus a can of diced tomatoes and a can of green chiles.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this last night. It was pretty good.  I followed some of the other suggestions and added taco seasoning the the ground beef.  The tortilla chips sort of cook into a thin corn bread.  We had corn as a side dish and next time would probably mix it in with the casserole.

This was very easy and very tasty.  I used ground turkey, fat free sour cream, and a little taco seasoning in the meat.  The leftovers were better than the original because the flavors had a better chance to blend.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks.

My family devours this casserole.  I do use some of the suggestions from fellows raters.  I add taco seasoning to the ground beef, black beans, non-fat sour cream (we cannot tell the difference) and I use canned chili spiced diced tomatoes.  We usually don't have any leftovers.

I make this every year for my husband's annual back country ski trip.  The boys love it.  I always add taco seasoning to the ground beef, as it gives the dish a lot more flavor.  The beef is a little bland without the mexican seasoning.

I did a lowfat version of this, using reduced fat cheese, fat free sour cream, baked tortilla chips and 7% fat ground beef.  It was very easy to put together and it tasted great.  Everyone wanted seconds!  I will make this one again.

Really good!  I did add about 1/2-3/4 cup salsa (was afraid it would be too dry) and precooked shredded chicken.  It was quick and easy for a great weeknight meal.

My husband and I love this recipe!  I made a few variations to save time and calories.  Instead of using ground beef, I used a can of refried beans (no stovetop cooking involved!).  Mixed them in a large bowl with the salsa (only had 1 C on hand) and black beans (instead of the chili beans).  Then poured that over some leftover corn tortillas, then topped the bean mixture with some frozen corn, can of drained diced tomatoes, sliced olives, green onions, and shredded cheddar cheese.  I'm not sure I'll use the corn tortillas again.  They were easy but were a little difficult to cut through.  I made this ahead of time, stuck it in the fridge, and baked an extra 10-15 minutes. Will definitely make this again and again!  My 6 yr old loves to help me with this one!

Very good, quick, and easy- one of my boyfriend's favorites! I've tried with lean ground turkey and taco seasoning on the meat a few times, and it came out well. I like to use non-fat sour cream to cut down on the fat.

This dish was really tasty, although I did modify it slightly.  I cooked my ground beef with chopped onion and added taco seasoning to the meat.  I also drained the ground beef after browning it to prevent the chips from getting  soggy.  Definately a keeper!

Delicious! And easy! My modifications : I used closer to 2 pounds of beef and taco seasoning, canned tomatoes with chiles, and mix of cheddar and other shredded cheeses. Even picky kids/teenagers enjoyed it, and I ate leftovers for days!

Delish! I added taco seasoning to the meat, and green chilis to give it a kick. I also used tortillas instead of chips and layered like a lasagna.

I made this as directed. Great. I think I cooked down the sauce a bit too much, and it was slightly dry. Easy to remedy next time. I would try some of the variations the other reviewers mentioned for a change up. This would be great with black beans instead of chili beans. It would also be great with a can of diced green chills drained. This might also be good with corn tortillas layered on the bottom instead of chips as other reviewers suggested. Adaptable, affordable and easy!

My entire family, including grandchildren loved it, so that generates a 5 star rating.  Easy to make!  That would give it an additional star!  I did follow the recommendations of Jeanine's review.  Her changes made a big difference, especially adding the taco seasoning to the cooking meat.

I guess I am an outlier, because I can't understand how this recipe got such high reviews.  It tasted like a heavy baked meat chili.  I did add the taco seasoning to the ground beef - otherwise, I followed the recipe.  For such a mediocre dish,  It also took a long time with the 20 minutes of simmering in salsa, in addition to the 30 minute baking time.  Usually the 4 star plus recipes on this site are wonderful, but not so in this case.  Hubby usually asks for seconds and I heard zilch, even though I gave him a smaller than usual portion.  He's very complimentary if the dish tastes good, but tonight he was politely silent!

I have made this several times.  I don't put the chips in but serve them on the side.  I add about 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro and one package of taco power when I add the salsa.  Also I put the tomatoes, black olives and green onions on top of the cheese, it gives the dish a better eye appeal.  I made this to serve 120 people.

This was a super tasty recipe.  Maybe it was just me, but mine came out a little more liquidy than I thought it would, so eating it with a spoon became a necessity. However, the next day I reheated the leftovers and we ate it by scooping it up with leftover tortilla chips and it was AWESOME. I think next time I'll leave out the bottom chip layer and just serve it dip-style.  Very tasty and a nice alternative to the usual tacos.  Would be great to serve this way to a crowd.

Like others I did do some tweaking to this basic recipe. I assumed upon reading it that the chips were meant to become a tamale like base so was surprised at the reviews that expressed disappointment that they were not crunchy. In fact, I made sure that my meat mixture had enough moisture to absorb into the chips. Changes I made included adding corn to meat mixture,extra green onions on top, using 1 cup mild salsa and 1 cup hot which gave it the right amount of heat for us. I also opted not to use the chili beans that have spices in them, but rather used a packet of taco seasoning and rinsed black beans. I used a smaller deeper dish and did two layers which made for a thinner sour cream base thus avoiding that weird curdled cooked sour cream issue that others mentioned in their reviews. The end results were awesome, and my fellow was very pleased. Will definetly go into my recipe rotation!

Made this for dinner last night for my folks, and they loved it!
Made a few tweaks:
Added Goya brand Sazon seasoning to the meat for more flavor.
Also fried the beef with a generous 1/2 cup of minced onion.
Used Bush's Medium Chili Beans and added 1 can Del Monte Zesty Chili Stayle diced tomatoes (drained) to the meat mixture.  Gave the beef a lot of flavor.

I only had 1 cup of light sour cream, so added 1 cup of 1% cottage cheese and it worked/tasted great!  

The crushed tortilla chips give this a nice taste.  I added a few handfuls on the top of the cheese for a little extra crunch.

This was a quick easy and tasty weekday meal!

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't have all the ingredients it called for, and can't wait to try the original recipe.  Threw some frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot on high along with salsa, chili powder, salt, pepper, paprika, cumin, fresh thyme, and oregano. After about 3 hours, I shredded the chicken and let it sit in the juices and absorb the juice. Didn't have much tortilla chips or sour cream, but used what I had on hand. Substituted black beans for the chili beans, because it is what I had on hand. Used Vidalia onion instead of green onion.  Layered as written, and baked.  Thank you for the awesome recipe.

This was an okay dish. I needed to use up half a bag of stale tortilla chips, so this recipe was perfect for that. I don't know if I would specifically buy chips to crush them up for this, but if I had extra chips that needed to be used, I'd make it again. Three cups of tortilla chips was definitely too much. Next time I will use two cups of chips, or do like others recommended, and add a can of diced tomatoes.

Love this recepe! However I make a few changes such as adding some taco seasoning, doubling the meat and the cheese (my family is a huge cheese lover). I also cook the sour cream with meat gives it a unique amazing taste. I then layer the cheese as I scoop it into my casserole dish much like you would a lasagna dish. Instead of green onions I use green chile peppers, leave out the tomatoes seeing as salsa already has a hefty amount of them the juicer the better! I just use this recipe as a dip with tortilla chips.

Had no idea what I was going to make for dinner the other night.  This was the "recipe of the day".  I looked at the ingredients, and I had everything on hand except for the ground beef . . . but I DID have some Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage!!  Yup, that worked!  It turned out great.  I loved the extra flavor that the sausage added, and I think if I made this again, I'd use the sausage again!  Tasted even better for lunch the next day!

Let me start by saying OMG!  I made this last night with a good friend.  We followed the recipe exactly except added more cheese (boing).  Besides the shimmer and possibly losing part of an earring in the food, it was easy to make.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone who enjoys Mexican food.

We don't get "Chili Beans" in my part of the country, so I used refried beans with green chilis in them.  Turned out FANTASTIC - kids said it was the best casserole they've ever had (and I've made a few).  Gotta admit it was awesome.  Just thinking now of seasoning the meat with taco seasoning first, or should I mess with perfection?

This is one of my go to meals for a speedy week night meal! I have made it as is, and it is fine, but I have also made some great additions! 
First I add a taco season packet to the meat, just to add some extra taco flavor! The other thing I have changed is to omit the crushed chips during baking. Instead we use the casserole as a dip instead, scooping onto full chips after it bakes! I like it better this way! Any way you make it, its delicious!

I made this in my crock pot and loved it. We were camping, and I did not have a pan large enough. I put some whole nacho cheese chips on the bottom, mixed up the browned ground beef and onion with the other ingredients (except cheese). Put that over the whole chips, then put a diced tomato on top of that, then a layer of crushed chips (never measured the bottom ones or top), and the 2 cups of shredded cheese. Also, I had a 24 oz. bottle of salsa and used all of it and a packet of taco seasoning. It took two to three hours on low in the crock pot to melt the cheese. We LOVED this!!!!

This dish is very easy to throw together and the ingredients are affordable as well. Once it's finished baking, it's very tasty. It keeps well for leftovers. And it doesn't have to be served only as a main dish but also as a dip. I would recommend this dish to anyone who needs to make something that will last several days or wants to bring something unique to the table at a dinner party.

I really liked this recipe and so did my husband. Instead of ground beef I used a little over a pound of chorizo (without the casing) from a Hispanic store near my home, drained the grease. I also used fresh salsa from the deli area of my grocery store. I mixed 2/3 can of black beans and 2/3 can of chili beans, both rinsed. Two and a half cups finely crushed chips worked well for me, and 16oz container of sour cream. I bought canned diced tomatoes with zesty jalapenos, and did a cup of green onions instead of 1/2. I layer it according to the directions and topped it with Mexican 4 Cheese shredded.
My only con is the way the chips turn out. They are sort of chewy and I thought they would be soft. Next time I think I'll exclude them and use this as a dip.

Loved this recipe. Only changed a few things. Didn't use the green onions as we don't like them. Also added some taco seasoning to the meat (ground turkey as opposed to ground beef). To combat the not-so-crunchy chips, I just added some crushed up chips on top when serving. Also put some shredded lettuce on top as well. Will definitely make again!

Very good....only. Changes I made was to add a half a regular onion, a small jalape√±o and use black beans. This has really nice crunch and a great wat to use up tortilla chips.

Held off on the olives. Substituted plain greek yogurt for sour cream and it tasted great and was a lot lighter. Definitely serving chips on the side is a must.

This recipe is quick and easy to fix; the flavor is great! I followed the recipe, and my casserole came out a bit dry. I think next time I'll NOT drain the chili beans and NOT simmer quite so long. My husband loved it, and it was good the next day too for left overs.

My fiancee and I both loved this recipe, he couldn't get enough. I used 2 packages of veggie crumbles since he's a vegetarian, added some chopped onion and garlic along with 2 packages of taco seasoning as other reviewers suggested. I also used corn tortillas in place of the crushed chips and a mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar. One of the best recipes on this site!!

This turned out a little too runny for me.  I don't think it was supposed to be that way, so I may have needed to simmer the meat mixture longer or use a thicker salsa or sour cream.  It tasted delicious, but the chips on the bottom were totally soggy and hardly noticeable in the mixture.  Next time I may leave the chips out of the recipe and just serve with them on the side.  It makes a great dip or chip topping.  I added a little garlic and taco seasoning to the meat mixture, and it was very flavorful.  I used ground turkey and light sour cream, but I'm still not thrilled with the fat content of this recipe.  I also used canned diced tomatoes with chilis instead of fresh tomato, but I think it would be good either way.

I liked this one, be careful how thick you layer the sour cream or it gets really messy.  I actually made it in a little bit smaller of a casserole dish because I like mine piled high and deep and it worked out just fine!

This recipe is fairly fast to prepare.  I didn't crush the chips, just layered them on the bottom and they did get a bit soggy.  Otherwise, everything turned out great.  My children really seemed to enjoy this.

This recipe was delish as is! I altered the recipe just enough to suit our tastes. My family enjoyed this so much that there was nothing left. Thanks so much for sharing.

My family loved this recipe.  The ingredients are just the right blend. The tortilla chips on the bottom really made the dish. I left mine in fairly large pieces based on the comments of other reviewers.  We will definitely serve this one again!

Mixed taco seasoning into the meat while browning, added a can of mexicorn (drained) & mild rotel (drained) along w/ the salsa & chili beans (also drained) - didn't add olives or the fresh tomato.  Used much less sour cream - it just didn't need much - and more green onions along w/ mexican mix cheese.  Crushed taco shells for the bottom layer b/c I had them on hand.  Baked at 375 till cheese was bubbly, about 20 mins.  It was good, but would be better if it was spicier - if you don't have kids that will be eating it, I'd recommend hot salsa & medium or hot rotel.  Overall, a good dish, but I don't think it'll make the regular rotation.

Easy to make and tastes just like nachos grande.  I would use half as much sour cream next time.  It took over the flavor a little too much.  I would also add some jalape√±o slices to the top, and maybe some rotel on top of the beef.

Everyone loved it! Hubby wants this over pizza night.
I did add a can of rotel tomatoes with green chili med to the beef along with salsa. I added the right amount of chips and made sure they were crushed up well. Fast and easy to make. Made a taco salad to go with.

I'd give this only 2-1/2 stars if I could. My husband and I thought it was more like a layered dip than a meal. On the positive side, it looked very pretty and was easy to make, but it needed more seasoning, and I didn't care for the chips on the bottom. Mexican lasagne recipes are similar, but much better. I won't make this again.

Did not like this at all and we are not picky eaters.  It has high ratings so I am really surprised it was a thumbs down for us. Chips on bottom get soggy and would rather just make a warm nacho chip dip instead of this casserole.

My husband gives this 5 stars - as the recipe was written. (He put hot sauce on his meal.) I felt the  3 cups crushed tortilla chips was too much. Next time I'll only use about 1.5 cups. I used tomato sauce and it worked, but I will go with taco seasoning with the other reviewers.

Great meal and very easy!  I think there are lots of variations that can be used - we wanted to use up the broken tortilla chips at the bottom of the bag and was glad to try the salsa since I was out of taco seasoning.  I also added corn to the meat and drained the meat/salsa/black bean mixture so no issue w/soggy chips.  There is really no way for this recipe not to turn out!

What I love about this recipe is the versatility of it. Basically, it's make it how you want it to taste. There are so many ingredients that you can add to fit it to your taste. The base recipe is great on it's own but I always make adjustments. I use refried beans spread over the burger mixure and over the sour cream I used diced mild chiles, tomatoes, and green onion. I also add salsa and taco seasoning when browning the ground beef/onion. Personally, the sour cream makes this dish for me. The warm creaminess of it is so satisfying. Reminds of a good lasagna with ricotta cheese in it. A definite must use recipe!

The chips got very soggy and the sour cream was not good cooked in it. Would be much better just topped with it. Flavor in general wasn't appetizing. My husband and I both LOVE stuff like this and I thought it would be a sure winner, but it definitely needs tweaking!

This was pretty good, my husband really liked it so I gave it 4 stars for him. I thought it was just ok. The chips do get chewy and soggy on the bottom, which was not my favorite, and the hot sour cream gets almost curdled- sort of like ricotta cheese.

Very good but I think it would be a better dip than a casserole. I used lean ground beef and fat free sour cream. I think it would be great for a party dip!

Addictive!  Couldn't sto eating it until it was all gone.
Left out beans and substituted taco seasoning for the salsa.  Used Doritos instead of tortilla chips.

this was extremly easy and very very tasty. Family loved it! I have leftovers and going to make a little mexican style/pizza tonight with some ready made WHOP'em bisquits in the fridge:)
Great easy receipe for a weeknight 
THANK YOU!

Oh and in case people care:
I used corn tortillas on the bottom- yummy
used 2 lbs of ground beef 
1 package of taco seasoning
and a few extra spices to boot
MOZZARELLA CHEESE- think that made a diff. in how it tasted it was so cheesey and yummy
Then I did the green onions/sour cream/chips/olives
for garnish (finicky eaters :)
ENJOY!

This tasted great and so easy to make!  Instead of tortilla chips I used tortillas broken into pieces.  I also used an 8x8 pan and did 2 layers of the tortillas.  Added a 1/2 cup shredded zucchini to the meat for some extra nutrients.

Fantastic, easy and quick!  Best thing about it is that it easily lends to substitutes depending on taste and what you have available.  I used carnitas instead of ground beef, black beans instead of chili and added frozen corn.  Also added a packet of taco seasoning to the carnitas.  I personally found that 3 cups of chips was not enough and used 4 cups albeit they were not completely crushed - only knocked down to line the bottom of the pan.

Made this last night for the fam.  They loved it, I used black beans and some Taco seasoning that I picked up in Arizona when I was traveling.   I also used a can of diced tomatoes.  It was just a little dry, so I just put sour cream on the table to everyone could add me if needed.  I also sauted the onions with the meat.   I think I will use more salsa next time.  But the 9x13 pan was used about eaten by 4 adults.  I would definitely recommend.  Thanks for the recipe.

When I first try a recipe I like to do it just as the recipe states.  However I did add a can of black beans too.  But nothing else I changed.  I would and will make this again.  This is easy and good.  Everyone I feed this to loved it also.  I had great commits.

I made this last night for my book club.  One member does not eat beans so I added pre-cooked rice.  It was a huge hit, and I will make it again and try it with the beans.  Easy and so good!

This was a very good base recipe.  I didn't have all of the items so I made quite a few changes.  I used lentils instead of beans, I added a can of healthy request cream of chicken soup, and I added a layer of rice in the middle of the meat salsa mixture and I baked it in a smaller rectangle pan instead of a 9x13 pan.  My husband and I both really liked it!

i was a little disappointed with this. The ingredients made me think it would be really good, but i actually found it a bit bland, and it did not hold together well. I think there was too much sour cream (could probably 1/2 that) and not enough spices.

very good! I had only 1 1/2 cups salsa to use, didn't have green onion so ommited that. I'm sure the green onion would make this even better. Also only used 1 cup of mexican cheese. Will be making this one again! :) Reminded me of nachos.

I used fat free sour cream and 2% cheese to help save some calories.  Also as previously mentioned did not crush tortilla chips so they were crispy. Yummy dinner that the kids loved!

Used ground turkey, low fat sour cream, taco seasoning, and black beans. Big hit with the family! Even my husband's coworkers thought that the warm-ups I sent with him for lunch smelled delicious.

This was absolutely the best dinner I've ever made!  My 13 year old son ate 4 bowls of it.  Only changes I made was that I doubled the recipe, cooked the hamburger with taco seasoning, omitted the sour cream, and instead of using tortilla chips I crushed up hard taco shells and sprinkled it on top of the casserole and baked it for the last 7 minutes of the baking time.  Absolutely wonderful and will definitely make again!

This was great!  Very easy, lots of left overs, and thousands of ways to make substitutions according to taste.  My husband and roommate LOVED it and we will definitely be making it again soon.  I suggest buying an extra bag of chips because you use the majority of an average bag in the actual recipe and if you have "dippers" in your house they may feel deprived.

My fiance loved this recipe.  I used tortillas and corn tortilla chips throughout to add variety.  It was very delious and good for a big family.  Even though it was just the two of us, my fiance ended up eating all the leftovers.  Thank you!

This dish was so easy and so tasty.  I did what the other reviews recommended by adding taco seasoning to the beef.  The flavor was excellent and chips were crispy.  definitely will be making this dish again.  My husband says it's the best we've tried on this website yet!

This was easy to make. I went with other cooks suggestions and added taco seasoning to the beef. Beans don't like me so I substituted with corn and used sour cream with chives. I didn't put the crushed chips on the bottom since there were some complaints about them turning out soggy and I can see why, it was pretty wet on the bottom. We ate it with flour tortilla wraps, lettuce with Mexican rice., like a soft taco. It was pretty good over all.

Delicious. Everyone loved it. I did add some taco seasoning to the meat as another review suggested and also used a can of drained diced tomatoes instead of the fresh. Otherwise followed the recipe. Mmmm good.

My parents were coming to visit, so I decided to try this. I don't care for pinto beans, but rather than substitute another bean I made the recipe as is. It actually tasted really good even with the pintos. Everyone liked it and had seconds! Great recipe.

Made this last night for my boyfiend and I.  Made a few adjustments; didn't use any beans, neither my boyfriend or I like them.  Added a package of taco seasoning while cooking meat as others suggested and only put sour cream on 1/3 (boyfriend hates it) I also added diced red peppers and red onion on top of sour cream layer.  My boyfriend looooved it!! I will defanitly be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe

This was easy and very good.  Can't wait to make it again!  I substitued a half of a can of corn for the olives, since I don't like olives.  I also substituted Rotelle for the tomato and onion.  I added the taco seasoning like others suggested.  I couldn't find chili beans, so I used black beans instead.

The kids gobbled this up.  I wasn't sure when reading the directions to really crush the tortilla chips as it says in the directions.  I mostly did, but wished I had broken them into pieces instead.  My tortilla chip layer was too thick and crumby.

My family wasn't impressed with this.  I think the meat needed much more flavor than what the salsa could give it, to start.  And I didn't like the way the flavor of the chips changed during baking.  The only way I would make this again would be to cook the beef with taco seasoning and making it more of a dip than a casserole by using scoops instead of crumbled chips on the bottom.  This would also make leftovers more tasty instead of the, now soggy, chips.  Hubby eats mostly anything but only gave this a 3 star.  With some tweaking for our personal preference, it has hope.

We enjoyed this very much. I substituted a 4oz. can of chopped green chilies for the olives (personal preferrance) and used a can of diced tomatoes with zesty mild green chilies (drained), instead of chopping my own tomatoes.   I just eye-balled the amount of crushed chips on the bottom layer and used 2lbs. of ground beef (with 1env. Taco Seasoning & some cumin & chili powder) plus about 1 1/2 cups of salsa + the can of chili beans.    This was very good, filling, and made-up quick with ingredients I had on-hand! Thanks ANDREALF63, for sharing the recipe!

This was delish and was so easy and quick to put together.  I used a can of diced tomatoes- drained and substituted black beans for the chili beans.  Next time I make it I'm going to leave out the chips and serve them on the side.  They got a little to soft after baking.  A great game-day dish for a hungry crowd!

Quick, easy and very good.  Did add taco seasoning to meat with salsa as other suggested. Did not have green onions but used 4 oz can of diced green chiles along with the fresh chopped tomato as indicated.  Excellent flavor.  (perhaps others had mushy tortilla bottom from using canned tomato). Only enough leftovers for husbands lunch and there were only two of us :).

This was a good recipe.  My small children didn't like it, but the older ones did.  It was pretty easy to make.  I would have preferred refried beans to the chili beans but that is my personal taste.  Leftovers were gone in a day.

So good! I added one can of corn, and I did not bake with sour cream...I served each slice with a dollop of sour cream on the side. My friends loved it!

I added onion and garlic to the meat while browning. I added hot sauce with the salsa since I like it spicier and unlike some other reviews I liked the sour cream cooked in this dish. Next time I may layer some of the sour cream in the middle of the meat too.

The only thing I did differently was add an extra 1/2 cup of fresh chopped tomatoes.  The beef had plenty of flavor after simmering with the salsa.  My husband loved it!  The casserole's texture was a bit like dip so we ate it with the extra tortilla chips we had.  I will definitely make it again.

Good as a base recipe but I made a lot of changes.... I browned the beef with onion, drained rotel and taco seasing, drained the fat, then added the beans with some taco sauce. Then I skipped the chips on the bottom, put the bean an beef mixture on bottom then covered with Mexican style cheese- baked untill bubbly, then pulled out let it cool for a little bit then added the sour cream, shredded lettuce, picco, jalos, and olives. I served it nacho style with the chips on the side- the boyfriend and I loved it, he ate almost half the pan!

I have made this recipe several times and it's definitely a family favourite!  I often use Veggie lean ground round instead of ground beef. I add one pack of taco seasoning,  black beans instead of chili, and use fat free sour cream and soy or low fat marble cheese.  And if on hand I add extra diced tomato and chopped red pepper to the veggie lean, bean and salsa mixture.  I also save some diced tomatos, green onion and japapenos to add on top of the shredded cheese before baking.  Delcious! Thank you

This was an easy casserole to put together. I left off the fresh tomato on top. This was a little bland though and needed something to make it richer and give it some depth. This was okay, but it didn't make our favorites. I had fun trying out a new recipe, thanks for sharing this easy dish.

Sorry this was a no go, my kids love mexican anything and they were not impressed.  It wasn't horrible, just didn't hold together well, it was more of a mess to dish out.  I used chips as the receipe calls for, not tortilla's as I believe is shown in the photo.  The chips just didn't do anything to hold this together.

This was great!  It is easy as the title states.  My 13 year old went back for seconds and thirds, and then ate the left overs the next day.  I didn't have salsa, so I used rotel instead.  I also used taco seasoning as others suggested.  This is for sure a keeper!

I made this following the recipe submitted exactly!  It was a HUGE Hit! Everyone had 2nds and there were no leftovers!  I served this with Creamy Hot Bean Dip and tortillas and it was just awesome!  We had jalepenos, taco sauce, and extra cheese for those who wished to spice theirs up the way they wanted!  The only thing I did was instead of cheddar I had a bag of mexican blend cheese!  Will definately be making this over and over!  I can't wait to substitute chicken for the beef too, I bet it's just as wonderful!  Thanks for submitting this Recipe!

What an awesome and easy recipe. I followed everything exactly just to see how it turned out on its own, very yummy. Next time, I will try some of the variations other reviewers used, just to mix it up a bit. Thank you so much for sharing!
**I just made this with ground turkey and used taco seasoning & onions while cooking the meat. Once out of the oven, I let it cool  down and then topped with shredded lettuce & garnished with sliced green onions and sliced olives**

I made this for dinner last night and my hb devoured it!  It was very good and I will definitely make it again.  I used cheese tortillas for the bottom (which I did not add to many because of the reviews) but I did not find they were soggy at all and my hb said I should have used more.  The only change I made was to use red onion diced and added with the beef when frying and I did not use the green onion.  Thanks for the recipe.

Be as Mexican as you want here, I mean use pinto beans and Chiuaua (mexican) cheese... The possibilities are endless with this great idea for a casserole! I strongly suggest freshly chopped cilantro here, YUM!

I've made this a few times but with a couple of changes, listed here in order of importance.  First and foremost, add a can of diced green chiles (drained) with the tomatoes, and a layer of CREAM STYLE CORN on top of the main (meat) layer.  Secondly, if I'm in a hurry I skip the beef and just mix a can of chili with a can of beans (black, pinto, refried, whatevs) for the main layer.  And finally, save some of the sour cream to make three or four big globs on top, and stick a tortilla chip poking out of each one -- this is a worthwhile aesthetic improvement especially if you can get the sour cream globs to brown a tiny bit on the top with the broiler.

Great for a quick and easy Mexican dinner fix. I added some onion and garlic powders, and about a tablespoon chili powder.  Topped with some shredded lettuce and cilantro, with the other veggies and served more salsa on the side.

My whole family liked this meal. It was a tad bit salty but a quick fix. I forgot to mix in the chili beans, so mine was without those. It still turned out fine. I will make this again.

My family loved, loved, loved it. It will be added to my regular round of meals. I was surprised the chips stayed crunchy, but they did and it was great. I didn't have fresh tomato on hand so drained a can of diced tomatoes for the top.

My family enjoyed this. I tried to err on the side of healthy by choosing corn tortillas instead of tortilla chips, reduced-fat sour cream (less than the recipe called for). We enjoyed avocado served next to it. The only thing I might do differently next time is add the tomatoes fresh after it comes out of the oven.

Good start for a mexican casserole, but not the best I've had.  It just seemed like there was something missing, and I even added taco seasoning as other reviewers suggested.  I used fresh tomato, but next time I will use canned and a bunch more cheese.  I actually like how the chips become a little soggy when baked, that was the best part to me.

This is good and easy and  pretty adaptable to what  you  have on hand. For those that thought  the 3 cups of crushed tortilla  chips was too much I think  you measure them BEFORE you crush them.

This was yummy! Used black beans instead of chili, decreased the amount of sour cream, and added corn and a touch of chili powder.

Thanks to some reviews I was able to make this delicious recipe while tweaking the ingredients for a somewhat healthier alternative. All thumbs up and second helpings all around the dinner table! For 8 servings I used 1 1/2 lbs ground chuck, 1 pkg of Lawry's taco seasoning mix, 16 oz jar of Newman's Own all natural chunky mild salsa, Trader Joe's 15oz can of cuban style black beans (drained), 15oz can of Kuner's southwestern corn n peppers (drained), 6oz sliced black olives (drained), 4 sliced green onions, 15 oz can of petite diced tomatoes (drained), 8oz nonfat plain yogurt mixed with 8oz reduced fat sour cream, 2 cups cheddar/monterey jack cheese. I used blue corn tortilla chips, did not crush them, and only enough to cover the bottom of the dish...4 cups would have been way to much even in the 11x15 pan I used. I browned and drained the meat and then added the taco mix, the salsa, drained beans, and drained corn and mixed well in the skillet. Then layered everything according to the original recipe but added a few handfuls of crushed up blue chips on top. note: I do have a couple of kids who asked for a little extra sour cream on the side. Also, if you like more kick use hot salsa or add some tabasco etc.. GREAT alternative to tacos!

With some minor changes this was a HUGE hit! This is my signature dish to bring to any gathering and it is always devoured! I add a packet of taco seasoning while browning meat (not after browned, it doesn't absorb into the meat right), use black beans instead of chili, and use a Mexican cheese blend instead of just cheddar. Also, the chunkier the salsa the better. This is a really excellent dish! Reheats well for lunches too!

The family really enjoyed this.  I did take a lot of suggestions from other reviewers and modified according to our tastes.  Left chips whole (would add more next time).  Add taco seasoning to ground beef mixture.  Left out olives because of personal preference and added corn. Used black bean, and Rotel in place of fresh tomatoes.  Used low fat sour cream.  Will definitely make again.  A hearty, easy meal.

I needed to make something quick with items I had on hand for my son's college function tonight. I threw this together in about 45 minutes.. start to finish.  I added a packet of taco seasoning and used Sam's Choice Thick Medium Salsa. There was no need to simmer for 30 minutes since the salsa is so thick.  After cooking the ground beef and adding the taco seasoning I threw in the drained beans and just let it all heat up good.. maybe 5 minutes.. before it all went in the oven. I omitted the tomatoes and the green onions since I didn't have those.  I used Fiesta blend cheese.  

My son sent a text message to my cell phone after the function and said everyone wanted the recipe.  Very easy and delicious. Next time I'm going to add a can of diced green chilies and a diced jalepeno. I like a bit more heat.

This is a very easy recipe and one that is extremely delicious.  When I cook it, I make sure to leave some juice in the meat/salsa mixture because it can become very dry.  I also mix the sour cream, tomatoes, chives, and olives together instead of making layers.  This is one of my favorite recipes.

I use this recipe as a "formula" for Mexican casserole, substituting, adding, or omitting based on what I have on hand each time.  Thanks for a simple, delicious recipe that every home cook can use.

I am giving this 4 stars only because I made some changes..  With my tweaking i give it 5.  I think I could eat this every day!  I only used a little sour cream before baking because I prefer it onthe side, left out the tomates because hubby doesn't like them, added taco seasoning and jalapenos for extra kick.

Excellent recipe!  I used the bite-size tortilla chips on the bottom and they were perfect.  Since I only had thick & chunky salsa on hand I left a little of the liquid on the beans so there would be some moisture in the casserole.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was soooo good with a few changes. I added taco seasoning to the meat, used both chili and black beans, added corn, used mexican mixed cheese rather than just cheddar and then layered the meat and chips twice. Chips stayed nice and crunchy on the top layer and soaked up all the flavors on the bottom layer. Yum!!!

We just had this tonight and not only was it "easy" it was so yummy!  I added taco seasoning (along with some garlic salt and onion flakes) to the meat.  I used actual "chili beans" although it would be good with refried beans, too.  My husband doesn't like onions or olives, so I left those out.  On top of the sour cream layer I added a layer of canned pickled jalepeno's (like on nachos).  OMG!!!  We ate it with some of the corn chips on the side and it was a big hit!  I think next time we will use cut up corn tortillas instead of the crushed corn chips (which I left whole thinking this would prevent them getting soggy) and will try to layer a few times similar to lasagna.  Would be great served with some grilled pineapple, too!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yumm, I tweaked it with what i had on hand (added corn, used rotel instead of salsa, no beans) and we loved it. It is definately one of those recipes that are even better when you tweak them for your family and they won't suffer any ill effects. We will make it (or something similar;) ) sometime soon.

Wow, delish and so easy!  I took the recommendation of adding corn, and substituting black bean and some Monterey Jack.  A little cilantro under the cheeese and this was a big hit here. . .with 2 more meals for the freezer!

I substituted one can of mexican corn medley instead of the chili beans. And after draining the hamburger meat, I sauteed chopped onions in with the meat along with one packet of taco seasoning mix. Instead of plain tortillo chips, I used regular nacho flavored Doritoes.  I also used a blend of Mexican cheeses and cheddar cheeses.  This dish was fantastic and was a big hit at work.  They talked about it for days.

This was amazing! Everyone who ate it loved it and raved on and on! It was so simple to put together - and looked so pretty after it was done cooking! The only thing I did different was add a bit more meat and veggies, as I was serving big eaters. This is going on the keepers list! Thanks!

I didn't have tortilla chips, so I used crushed corn chips and a few sliced soft tortillas instead.  Didn't have green onion, so I used a Vidalia onion and half a leftover red bell pepper instead. I followed everyone's advice and added taco seasoning to the meat and a can of diced jalapeno peppers.  Left the sour cream as a garnish and left out the black olives...cuz I just don't like em.  Overall, it was a good, easy to modify recipe that makes a great "work day" meal for me and my husband with PLENTY left over for lunches the next day.

My Husband, In-Laws and I all loved this dish!  I substituted the green onions for onions and left out the olives.  I think I will add more chips next time if I make it like this.  I was also thinking it would make a good dip, with out the chips.  Just serve it with chips on the side.

This was a great recipe.  My husband loves it.  I like it in flour tortillas and my husband likes it served w/chips kind of like nachos.  I didn't really like it by itself but with the chips or tortillas it was perfect. Just a note I have 4 kids, none of whom like this. I think it is the chunks of onion and peppers in the salsa that gets them.

My family loved this casserole. This recipe is going into my recipe box at home.

I did make a couple of changes due to not having a mild salsa. Didn't want to burn the young one's mouth. I had a mild enchilada sauce that I mixed in with the beef. I didn't have fresh tomoatoes so I used petite diced from a can, so I drained, rinsed and dried:) 

Thanks for an amazing recipe!!

Yummy! Used 2 cups baked tortilla chips (crushed) and ground turkey. While browning the turkey, I added taco seasoning, onions, and green peppers. Then Rotel Tomatoes & green chilies, a little red pepper, Then followed the recipe pretty much as written. Also used fat free sour cream. Turned out awesome and no one knew it was low in fat!!! I also assembled on Saturday and cooked on Sunday. Wasn't dry or soggy! Just Perfect!

I loved this recipe and will be making it for the second time this week. I didn't have 2 cups of salsa so I used one cup of salsa and a can of green enchilada sauce. I will also be adding a drained can of corn to this batch.

This was a good recipe.  I added taco seasoning, refried beans and some corn. It seems more like a dip though.  My family and boyfriend have been eating it with tortilla chips, sour cream and salsa.

When I make something that my wife likes, then I know that I did good. She loved this recipe! And, I am happy to have found a meal that costs me $15.23. And can last a while for the two of us, for other meals in the next couple days.  It's a winner!

The flavors are ok but like another reviewer said, when you cook out all the moisure it gets pretty dry.  I think I'd rather just make nachos using all the same ingredients.

Interesting that there are no seasonings listed for this recipe. I used taco seasoning, garlic and onion powders and black pepper. I made this with ground turkey and instead of the beans, I used bean and bacon soup. This turned out well and it was very quick and easy to throw together. Thanks Andrea!

This was a very good recipe.  Very tasty.  The only changes I made were to add Taco SEasoning to the ground beef while cooking and instead of tortilla chips (which I think would be gross when soggy) I used broad egg noodles in the bottom of the pan.  I used more salsa as I had much more ground beef than called for.  Definietly worth trying.

I thought this was pretty good.  As recommended by others, I added an envelope of taco seasoning to the meat and used black beans instead of chili beans.  I reduced the chips to 2 1/2 cups and added whole kernel corn with the olives, green onions and tomato.  (I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh).  I reduced the cheese to 1 1/2 cups and added some crushed chips to the top.  Overall, I was happy with the way the casserole turned out, but I still think I'll try a different recipe next time.

I must have messed up. I should have read the reviews before attempting to make this on my own. I only somewhat crushed the chips, used ground chicken, used kidney beans, and completely cooked the meat mixture till NO liquid was there. Maybe I shouldn't have taken out every drop of moisture. The chips on the bottom of the casserole were halfway between crunchy and soggy - sort of chewy. I can see leaving out the chips and using everything else as a great party dip - football parties, etc. Great flavors.

We found this recipe to be quick, easy and tasty. Due to the picky (adult) eaters in my household, I left out the tomatoes, green onions and olives - and the darn thing was still good! I saut√©ed regular onion chopped small with the ground beef, added Cholula to the salsa, and added diced roasted green chilies to the sour cream. I spread the sour cream quickly & easily by squeezing it out of a heavy quart size zip bag (fill the bag, then cut off one of the bottom corners to squeeze out the sour cream). The tortilla chips on the bottom softened (not soggy) and created almost a corn tamale-like base. My picky eaters loved it, but asked that I use smooth rather than chunky salsa next time.

This was good, I didn't like the tortilla chip layer though....too soggy!  I would leave that out next time and serve it over crispy tortilla chips.  But very yummy, I would also cut some of the beans as well.  But very filling andyummy!

I made this recipe exactly as listed except I was out of cheddar cheese and used a mixture of colby and monterey jack cheeses.  It tasted great and was a big hit.  30 minutes was just right in my oven.  Next time I will try adding diced green or red peppers to the toppings. Excellent!

This was really great!  I too added the taco seasoning packet to the meat and tomato sauce as the family is not fond of cooked tomatoes.  Instead of tortillas, I made it with curly pasta shapes for the kids. Will definitely make this again.

I changed this recipe to burritos by making the mixture and refried beans seperate. I then spread a thin mixture in my baking pan, then layered the tortilla with beans, mixture, and cheese. The remaining mixture I spread over the top with a heavy coating of cheese.Servered remaining beans with the plate. Everybody loved it, but it is probably way to hot for most children.

Ok.. I had all the ingredients but left my pan at someone's house lol so I used a deep  9inch pie dish.  I did NOT put the chips in the dish instead crumbled them on top after it was dished out.  Really tasty and lots of room to add or leave out what you prefer.  Added a bit of sr cream when it was served and also had fresh sliced avocado on top.  Yum...easy and yummy!

This was really tasty and easy to make, I forgot to add any salt, so I‚Äôd do that next time when I brown the meat. Maybe additional seasoning (Mexican) as well b/c my salsa was mild. We served it with a big salad on top. My son ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day!

We loved this. Halved the recipe for just 3 of us and it made plenty! The only change I might try next time is to use more salsa in place of the sliced tomatoes, but it was still delicious made the way the recipe states. This will definitely be a new staple in our house!

VERY tasty.  Because it is so easy to make, this makes this recipe a "go-to" because it doesn't have a lot of ingredients and prep is easy.  I did double the green onions and also tomatoes because we like a little kick.  Hubs loves this and has already asked when will I make it again.  :-)

So I've made this recipe twice now. The first time directly as written with ZERO changes, and a second time with some changes I felt would better the dish. 

My four star review is for the zero substitutions recipe. It tasted excellent and had a great amount of flavor (though the recipe doesn't tell you to salt and pepper your browning meat, you absolutely should.) The chili beans were a nice touch and gave it some unexpected flair. 

That being said, I think the changes I made to the dish give it that final, coveted star . The original recipe is great, but I felt like it was missing something. 

I started with sweating a bit more than half a large white onion with two diced red chiles (seeds removed) with salt, pepper, garlic salt and a small dash of cumin. Then I threw in 1.5 pounds of ground chuck with the vegetables. Once the chuck is browned, I discarded of the fat and juices at the bottom before returning to pan and following the directions from there. (Edit: Almost forgot, I added a packet of taco seasoning at the same time as the beans. Only left it on the stove long enough to heat through and incorporate with the meat/onions).

I also used WAY more green onions that were called for, twice as many black olives (not very Mexican but boy are they tasty) and omitted the sour cream from going in the oven. Once the dish was in the oven for the specified time, I let it cool slightly before dishing up each serving with a dallop of sour cream on top and traditional Mexican ri

I followed the recipe exactly and in the future would probably make the following change: instead of layering the chips on the bottom of the casserole and baking... Which turned a brand new bag of chips soggy and stale tasting... I would bake the casserole without and serve over a bed of fresh chips.

It was VERY runny.    I used low fat ingredients and the casserole dish was basically soup.  I will try it again with full fat sour cream, etc. but for some reason this was just disgustingly runny with lighter ingredients, mixed with all of the salsa and tomato, etc.

So easy and so good! I used black beans instead of chili beans, since that's what I had on hand, but everything else was per the original recipe. Tastes great with a green salad and cornbread.

We really liked this recipe with a few modifications.  Like many others, I added taco seasoning and a little cumin and garlic powder to the ground beef while saut√©ing.  Also, I used corn tortillas in the base of the pan rather than corn chips.  I‚Äôm pretty much gluten free, so I served it to the others with the bite-sized tortilla chips, and I ate it as-is.  It was enjoyed by all from my 74-year old mother to my 3-year old son.

This is great...my family loved it.  I did add chicken broth to the chips(just a little to soften them a tad), and I added garlic to the ground beef as I cooked it. Definitely a keeper!

Very good I topped with sweet onion, jalape√±os and Red Belle Pepper, instead of green onion and black olives. I used mexican cheese & mild cheddar cheese on top.  And Instead of baking with sour cream I used it as a optional topper on the table. This is what I changed and it was great! I will definitely make it again.

I have made this recipe several times and really enjoy it. I follow Jennifer's advice (she is the second review, from December 30, 2006) and add extra seasoning. Tonight I added half an onion, a jalapeno, and two cloves of garlic to the ground beef. Along with hot salsa, it had an extra spicy kick. Also, I think bite-size Tostitos make the best first layer in this casserole. I used different chips this evening with unsatisfactory results.

I used a single layer of corn tortillas as the base as others suggested but I think I still might play around with the base (maybe cutting the corn tortillas into small pieces?) as I'd like this to be (plastic) fork tender, especially as this is the perfect football party potluck dish.  I doubled the hamburger and made two layers of everything.  As others suggested, I added various spices to the meat mixture, and only 1 c salsa.  Others commented that there's a lot of grease in the bottom but I didn't have the experience.  That is probably due to a lot of factors, such as using corn tortillas, how long I cooked the meat, the leanness of the meat, etc.

I made this exactly as called for in the recipe except for using more beef and onions.  My husband and I both thought the flavor was great; however, the texture of the tortilla chips was a big turn-off.  Next time I will not put the chips on the bottom but will layer the casserole as directed and after it is baked, I'll serve it over the crispy chips.

Really good! I added taco seasoning to about 1.5 lb of meat and the salsa. Gave a good flavor but not too spicy. 
Added about 1 cup frozen corn in place of beans to cater to my kids' tastes. I will not skip the beans next time (sorry kiddos), they would have rounded the taste out,  but will keep the corn addition. I think I will use a guacamole/sour cream mix next time. The sour cream alone was a little overpowering for my taste. 
Will definitely make again. Good easy dinner!

We all enjoyed it.  I did add a small can of mild chilies to the ground beef and used black beans instead of chili beans based on what we had on hand.  My son loves Mexican food, and he loved this.  I will make it again. It's easy and non-fuss.

Taste is not bad, but how can it taste bad when you dump things like cheese and sour cream in there.  Not exactly a healthy meal.

There are only two of us eating and I usually make tacos or taco salads and then have quite a bit of leftover taco meat.  This recipe is a great way to use it up since leftover tacos don't go over so well!  I scale this back by 25-50% and use the 1/2-3/4 lb of leftover taco meat then serve with guacamole, chips and homemade salsa (garden tomatoes, garlic, onion, jalapeno, cilantro and salt.)

This is now a staple at my house.  The kids and hubs all love it. It's totally easy to put together and presents nicely too.  I add fresh corn to the mix sometimes.  Sometimes I use canned diced tomatoes.  It's always incredibly good.  Thank you for sharing this really awesome recipe!!

Awesome recipe. I added diced jalapenos to the meat mixture. The only thing I would do different next time is put sour cream on the side. Cooking it with every thing else made it curdle.

loved the recipe, but tweaked it a little: doubled the recipe and used ground turkey with a package of taco seasoning, used Rotel(2 cans) instead of salsa, added green chilies, used Mexican blend cheeses (the one with cream cheese added)and did not cook it with the sour cream, but topped it after baking with seasoned Lite sour cream (just a little taco seasoning), and made my own Pico degalo to go with it.  WONDERFUL DISH!  Thanks for sharing.

Seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, chopped onions and added a can of Rotel tomatoes and Cream of Mushroom soup.  Omitted the beans because I served refried beans and guacamole on the side.  What a success!!!!!!!

Flavor was wonderful however it was too dry for our tastes.  Followed recipe EXACTLY as given (I don't believe in reviewing recipes that have been changed).  I will make again however, I am not going to drain the beans next time as I think it needs more liquid.  Sure didn't have any problem with "soggy tortilla chips".  It also could have been the salsa I used (thick and chunky) was too thick??? We did like the flavor.  Used Mexican cheese on top instead of cheddar!

Easy to make, can see why busy moms like the ease of this recipe ... however, in our family, it was a big "EH".  Soggy chips; needs more beef and just bland.  Since I made it, leftovers have set in the frig 4 days.

So delicious! I followed one of the other reviewers below, she made some minor changes and it was PERFECT! I did 2 cups of broken tortilla chips on bottom, thin layer of cheese on top of the chips, then the meat mix(beef/Mexicorn/black beans/1 can rotel spicy), 1 cup sour cream spread, 1/2 cup green onions/1 can rotel spicy then the rest of the 2 cups of cheese on top. It was so yummy!! I was confused on which to follow but I am so glad I did it this way! Thank you so much, and thank you Wildflower86!

I agree with the others, 3 cups of chips is too much, half as much is enough. You can also add any other kind of beans to this dish like black beans or pinto beans like I did! I also added corn to the meat while it was cooking! 
For a vegetarian take on it substitute the chips for brown rice and substitute the meat for diced portobello mushrooms. Very yummy!!

Great base for a casserole.  With everything, I have a hard time sticking to the recipe, I had extra so made two layers, adding re-fried beans to bottom and substituting chips for white corn tortillas.   Also added red bell pepper to stove mixture.  Mixed the tomatoes and green onion into the sour cream and then added again on top.  Family friendly, my three year old even loved it!!

This recipe was so good and easy to make my husband got up the next day and warmed it up for breakfast. This will always be my one and only Mexican casserole I make for my family. And I did use rotel and added jalepeno peppers along with my salsa because I had to double this recipe my family just loved it Thanks!

My kids are always excited when I make this for dinner.  I used black beans instead of chili beans.  I also layered soft tortilla shells instead of crispy chips to add a mexican twist on a classic lasagna.

I too felt that the chips on the bottom were very dry. I would mix the chips with the beef mixture next time. I have to reheat this tomorrow for a party and Im thinking of lifting the casserole and putting a can of tomatoes, salsa or a little water under it before I reheat in the microwave. After looking at the pic, I think I should have crushed them more :-/

Easy and delicious! I used less sour cream and shredded cheese than the recipe calls for, and I substituted turkey for the ground beef. My husband and daughter both liked it!

It's easier (and preferable I think) to just take all the ingredients and make nachos.  The flavor is the same, and you don't have to bake all the moisture out of your sour cream.

Made this last  week bit hit with my sons. We do not have chilli beans here in Australia, well I have never seen them so I substituted them with red kidney beans and some chilli sauce. Also I used a taco chilli flavouring in the ground beef and browned an onion before browning the beef to give extra flavouring. We ate it with the chips like nachos very good.

The first time I made this I followed it to the T and it was good. I have a problem with leaving recipes alone, so the second time I made it I used shredded chicken in place of the ground beef, refried beans instead of chili (not a fan of chili in the can) and light sour cream. It was AWESOME and all the Marines in my husbands office loved it.

I'll definitely make this again! But I did make the following adjustments to up the flavor and next time will probably omit the beans and try to with a layer of refried beans instead:

Chopped 1 white onion and 1 green pepper.

Used ground turkey and cooked with taco seasoning, garlic powder and 2/3 the onions/peppers, then added salsa and simmered, once all liquid was absorbed added 1 can of drained beans and 1 can drained corn.

In greased pan used crushed lime tortilla chips to add a little extra flavor, layered the meat mixture followed by sour cream. I omitted the olives and added the rest of the onion/peppers and diced tomato then a layer of cheese on top.

I followed the recipe. My Dad loved it, my Mom and Myself thought is was just Ok. The sour cream looked spoiled. I thought is was kind of dry. Might try it again but change it up by putting the chips on top so the don't get soggy and leave off the sour cream and use it on the side.

Pretty good recipe, although a little bland for my family. When we make it now we use Doritos instead of tortilla chips. I put taco seasoning in my meat, and we use a medium spicy salsa. Everyone's tastes are different and we just happen to prefer a couple of twists.

This is an excellent dinner, or lunch as well. We added corn in the layers, and I added some Chili Powder, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Salt, Pepper, and Cumin to the sour cream!!! Also I didn't have Chili Beans, so I used canned Pinto beans and that was just as good!!! Very yummy... Thanks

Wow- What a wonderful recipe! My whole family loved this casserole.  I followed the directions exactly, except used one can of petite diced tomatoes in place of chopped fresh tomato.  Will not change anything the next time I make it.

This was good, but of course I had to make some changes the second time to make it great.  4 stars as written, 5 stars my way.  First, I browned the ground beef and drained the fat and rinsed it with hot tap water to remove most of the fat and grease.  I used leftover hardshell taco shells--they worked great, with less grease and less salt and more authentic Mexican flavor, and I put a layer of them on the bottom and top, before the sour cream.  I added a couple of dashes of Penzey's Arizona Dreaming seasoning and a tsp of chicken "better than bouillon" and a can of diced green chilis to the mix.  I also added a half package of frozen "fiesta" veggies (corn, red and green peppers, black beans) to the mix.  I did not add the green onions or chopped tomatoes until after it came out of the oven and the piece de resistance, I heated a can of enchilada sauce and ladeled it over the top of each serving.  Sooooooo goooood! (I used reduced fat cheese and sour cream and the hubby didn't even notice!)

My family LOVES this casserole!!  My 4 year-old asks for it by name.  I made a few changes including decreasing the chips by a cup, using drained & rinsed black beans plus smoked paprika and chili powder, powder and adding about 1/2 - 1 cup of additional salsa.

The chips on the bottom layer did get soggy enough to be nonexistent.  We crushed and added some more to the top when serving.  I think if we make this again, we will add a can of refried beans to the hamburger mixture. We did add taco seasoning to the beef/bean mix.  Also, used nonfat plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream (we usually have this on hand and always sub it for sour cream).  It tasted a bit like a dip and we even ended up dipping chips into the pan to eat some.  Not bad, but with all the grand reviews, we expected a little more.  Thanks for sharing!

I substituted Johnsonville mild Italian sausage for the ground beef in this recipe. I cooked the sausage first.  Then, I put it in a food processor to break it up into smaller pieces.  The recipe is unbelievably good...as though you're at a party having an awesome Mexican-style Dip.  The sausage was great, but I think I'll try Johnsonville's four cheese sausage in this recipe when I find it in the grocery store.

I used a package of taco seasoning, with water, and a can of zesty mexican tomato sauce in the ground beef. Added a can of black beans instead of chili beans, adn used a can of stewed tomatoes, cut up. Really good! Try Fritos on the bottom.

This is amazing.  I doubled the recipe and added taco seasoning, black beans and onions and omitted the green onions and chips.  We used it as a chip dip.  Total Hit!  Thanks

Made this last night for dinner.  Hands down a keeper, everyone raved about it.  I did make some changes...omitted salsa just used Rotel tomatoes in with hamburger and added my fave taco seasoning and used Nacho cheese flavored chips instead of plain tortilla chips.   I also doubled the hamburger and used black beans instead of what recipe called for just out of preference.  This was very easy and quick to put together.  Highly recommend

This was very yummy!  I made some changes based off some of the other reviewers recommendations.  I used 1 1/2 lb of ground beef and added packet of taco seasoning,  added 1 can of black beans, used 1 can of Rotel brand diced tomatoes/chilies, used a little less than 2 cups of chips and once I pulled the dish out of the oven I sprinkled with fresh cilantro.  Turned out pretty good!

UPDATE: I DECIDED TO GIVE THIS ANOTHER TRY. THIS TIME, I ADDED A CAN OF BLACK BEANS (ALL I HAD), USED PACE BRAND (HOT) PICANTE SAUCE, ADDED A PACKET OF SPICY TACO SEASONING TO MY MEAT MIXTURE (I DIDN'T ADD ANY TO THE SOUR CREAM LAYER NOR DID I DRAIN MY BEEF), SUBBED NACHO FLAVORED DORITOS / MEXICAN-BLEND CHEESE AND  AND USED REGULAR SOUR CREAM IN LIEU OF THE LITE SOUR CREAM I USED LAST TIME. THIS TURNED OUT GREAT! This did not suit me at all (sorry!). To my surprise, my picky husband and neighbor seemed to enjoy this (although I think my hubs was being polite in front of company). I have a couple of issues with this. First, my chip layer was S-O-G-G-Y!!! I even took this into consideration when crushing my chips (I roughly crushed them, being sure to leave some large pieces). Finally, my sour cream layer was just plain off-putting. My husband wasn't surprised and actually expected the sour cream to lose its "creaminess" after being baked, but I didn't.... I usually tweak new recipes, but this time I didn't make many alterations. All I did was omit the olives (we HATE them!) and add a small (chopped) yellow onion, a couple cloves of minced garlic and half of a 1 oz. packet of taco seasoning to my meat (I added the other half of the taco seasoning to my sour cream). None of these enhancements made a significant difference. A Dole Southwest salad completed our meal. Maybe this will be a winner with your family, but it wasn't star quality in my book. Thanks anyways, Andrea.

I actually used leftover turkey that we had grilled the night before, cutting into small pieces and sauteeing it with the salsa as the recipe called for. I mixed the sour creme and 1/2 the shredded cheese together and spooned it over the top and then added the rest of the shredded cheese. Not only delicious but completely fine for my gluten free son!

Made this dish over the weekend and it was huge hit! I made a few minor changes: used Morningstar Meat Crumbles and added one packet of taco seasoning to the meat; used the seasoned chili beans; and instead of plain cheddar cheese I used shredded Mexican Cheddar & Montery mix cheese. I also added crushed torilla chips to the top as well as the bottom. Very delicious meal..will definately cook this again!!! :)

Sent this to a pot luck dinner at church which I was to sick to attend. Friends returned thee empty dish and hadn't even gotten any as it was goobled up by those ahead of them in line. So I increased he ingredients by half and made two 8x8 and one small round casserole for friends & my next door neighbors. They loved it also.

Used black beans instead of chili beans, substituted 1 can drained Rotel instead of fresh tomatoes, just to add a little heat. Just barely crushed the tortilla chips hoping it would keep them from getting soggy, but they got soggy anyway. Maybe they're supposed to. Did not care for this recipe and won't be trying to tweak it because I already have a couple of recipes that are very similar.

This was delicious!!! My 14 yr old even loved it!!! I took a bunch of suggestions and made it to suit the family.  Added 1 small can of green chili's and taco seasoning as suggested.  I put a single layer of flour tortilla's on the bottom and added the chips on top then added the cheese.  The chips were crisp this way.  Left out the olives (I don't like them) and just served with a side of sour cream.  I may freeze a portion and wasn't sure how the SC would freeze.  Will definitely make again!!

Super easy ... Almost too easy! I got overconfident and ended up screwing up a bit. Luckily, it still turned out great! I used ground turkey seasoned with a taco seasoning recipe I found here but then spiced it up a bit more. Also mixed in worchestire sauce ... Forgot to mix the salsa with the meat, but I put it on top of the sour cream layer. It seemed to work out just fine. :)

This was a smash hit with my family.  I followed the recipe with 2 minor changes... did not crush the chips and because we love them, I doubled the black olives.

Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe, it's a keeper.

The sour cream was over powering in this dish.  I think I will add some green peppers next time or onion, plus use less sour cream.  Not a great dish, but definitely not horrible though either.

This was really good and easy. Only changes I made were to add taco seasoning to the meat and I used Rotel (drained) instead of fresh tomatoes and threw in the rest of a can of chilis I had. It had a nice little kick to it.

This recipe is delicious and so easy! I used about a pound and a half of hamburger meat and since I was out of cheddar cheese, I used a Mexican blend. It was great! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious. My 8 year old doesn't generally like casseroles, but he thought it was nachos, so he ate it.
I loved the flavor of the black olives through it!

Excellent recipe!  I did use 1 1/2 lbs hamburg.  I also used Medium strength salsa and 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning. Not being a big sour cream fan, I used 1/3 cup.  I also added, at the last five minutes, some tortillia chips to the top along with a little more cheese.  My husband loved it!

This was good.  I added Cholula sauce.  Next time, I'm going to make it in layers and not crumble the chips as much for more crunch.

I used the whole wheat soft shell tortillas instead and tossed in some chopped re, orange and yellow bell pepper (I like lots of colour in my food) and it was fantastic. This recipe is so easy and the left overs were just as tasty the next day!

This was pretty good/made it exactly like the recipe... although next time I would definitely add a little more spice to it... a little bland.. maybe some green chiles, taco ssg. and or hot sauce. but I will make it again.

4 stars for us after changes.  Use as base recipe Completely cook meat, drain & blot.  Can mix other ingrediants together or layer.  Keeping some cheese for toppingl  I put chips under cheese topping.  Also did not drain beans. As another comment suggested can add anything else your family likes such as corn. will make again.

This recipe is super easy, and always a hit in our home. We use hot salsa when making the meat/salsa mix since it loses a little of its heat when its cooking. I also recommend using a chunky salsa in comparison to a liquidy salsa in order to maintain the crunch of the chips. Leftovers are always great as well!

Really good! I did not use sour cream, and added taco seasoning to the beef and drained the juice for a little added kick. It's very delicious! Highly recommend!

This recipe was a dinner saver! Easy and enjoying. I made the recommened changes as suggested and added the taco bell sauce to the meat after the beans were added and wow! Also I used the real deep fried chips that you usually find in Latino establishments. What a difference. Yummy! Yummy! for my familys Tummies!

vERY gOOD!  I used 93/7 ground turkey, and seasoned the heck out of it with onion powder, garlic salt, chili powder, smoked paprika & cumin..  I used a can of red beans and MJ cheese because of what I had.  Regarding the chips - I measured about 4 cups of whole chips (the bite sized) and then crushed those, and it was the perfect amount.  A simple, economical and tasty casserole that even my 5 yr old liked!  (oh, I omitted the olives b/c sometimes he doesn't like "wheels").  Will likely make again.  THANKS!

This recipe didn't WOW my husband too much, but it definitely hit the spot for me.  Essentially, I think it came out tasting like a loaded nacho, which was kind of what I was craving the night I made it.  I will definitely keep this around for those nights I'm in the mood for Mexican, but don't want to spend too long in the kitchen.  The only thing I did differently was I added shredded lettuce to the top of each piece as it was served.

Yum! We really liked this recipe! Adding the salsa to the meat and letting it simmer, as the recipe calls for, really makes it tasty! I forgot to buy olives so I didn't have those but will use them next time.

I make a meat mixture of ground beef, diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup medium salsa, onions, green chilies, taco seasoning, pinch of cumin, garlic powder, black pepper and chili powder.

Spread bite size tortilla chips in 9x13 greased pan, add meat mixture, sour cream, green onions, black olives, and 2 cups of shredded nacho/taco cheese (cheddar, monterey jack, spices).

Family loved it and there was enough for my lunch the next day.

Bake 350¬∞ for 30 minutes.

This was delicious!  I didn't crush the chips, just did a single layer of whole chips in the bottom.  Also I used Totitos Artisan Fire-Roasted Chipotle chips which I highly recommend.  Didn't have the fresh tomatoes so I used canned diced tomatoes which worked great.  Used one cup of salsa and sprinkled store-brand chili seasoning on the beef while it was cooking along with diced onion and chopped garlic (we LOVE garlic).  I just spooned on the sour cream, definitely didn't use a whole 2 cups.  I also substituted black beans for the chili beans.

Making it again tonight!  I'll post pics as soon as I have time.

My family loves all the things in this recipe so I thought I would give it a try. I have made it twice and while I have adjusted it to something we do really like it is not what it was originally suppose to be.  We do keep the chips whole and make it more like nacho's

I added 3/4 of an onion and a packet of taco seasoning.  I also used turkey and was not dissapointed.  This dish is VERY flavorful and has a great consistency.  All around perfect dish.

This is a very good recipe, after reading reviews I made some changes I cooked ground beef w/ taco seasoning, and I also omitted chili beans and went w/ blackbeans and I used picante sauce instead of salsa (what I had available)  I also used mexican shredded cheese.  Very good husband likes to eat it with tortilla chips.  I think it tastes similar to fast food chains loaded nachos.

I wish all meals were this tasty and simple. I had to use what I had on hand so I substituted nacho-flavored Doritos (not crushed), just enough to cover the bottom of a 9 x 9 pan, put 1/2 packet of taco seasoning with the meat, used black beans, added some black pepper.

I didn't let my meat simmer for 20 minutes because I didn't want it to be too dry. It was deliciously spicy. I can only imagine how good it would be if I had actually had some sour cream, olives and onions to go in it. Oh my.

My family loved this. I did do a few things differently. I used Nacho doritos instead of regular tortilla chips, I added taco seasoning to my ground meat, and instead of chili beans i used refried beans. I also doubled the recipe since we had company. EVERYONE got seconds!

We thought this recipe was very tasty, but seemed more along the lines of a dip then a meal. Was very rich and delicious!

I made several easy changes to make this both heartier and healthier. Instead of ground beef I use white meat ground turkey. Serve the sour cream on the side instead of baked in (I don't like how sour cream bakes). I saute an onion and various peppers to add as a layer of the dish. I also like to add jalapenos and green chiles. Using these methods makes it a one-dish meal complete with protein and veggies! Heats up great for easy work lunches too.

Very kid friendly! At home we call it Mexican lasagna. The word casserole doesn't go over very well with the kids. The only thing I did differently was put down an extra layer of taco chips before the cheese, I like the crunch and the kids think it's like eatting nachos. I also didn't use the sour cream when making the layers. We just scooped a spoon full on our plates before eating. Which is great since our oldest hates the stuff.

Very quick to put together.  We had mixed reviews at my house.  My daughter loved it.  My son didn't care for all the onions and peppers (courtesy of the Pace Picante I used).  It was okay in my opinion, but I don't think I'll be making this dish often.  Nothing at all wrong with the recipe, simply not my taste.

I forgot to add the tomatoes to this while making, but it was delicious anyway! I also used regular pinto beans because hubby bought the wrong kind. I wasn't sure about the black olives, but they were wonderful in the dish.My picky 13 year old even asked for more.  Will be adding it to the regular rotation.  This is a fast recipe, and easy to put together.  I think this dish has the capability of being versatile while staying yummy.  I bet you could try different cheeses or meat and it would still be good...

I don't eat corn, so I substituted lasagne noodles for the bottom and put another layer on the top with the cheddar cheese on the top of them. It was sort of a Mexican lasagne!

This was a simple, easy dish. I used onestly what I had on hand. I substituted spicy Doritos for tortilla chips and honestly, it gave it a nice little zing. My man child boyfriend absolutely loved it instead of a casserole I would probably recommend using it as a dip for an appetizer, I'm making this for our Superbowl party.

I love this casserole because it is so easy to make.  I do use taco seasoning when making the ground beef, and I love the flavor of the chili beans.  I also add a can of Rotel, instead of salsa, to the meat mixture.  I get lots of compliments on this dish - THANKS!

tasted ok.  The sour cream layer ended up looking like spoiled sour cream.  It got chunky and did not taste good.

This one is a definite keeper!  My daughter's friend even LOVED it.  I used Doritos crushed on the bottom because I didn't have any tortilla chips.  It tasted great!  Plus I always save the crumbs from the bottom of the chip bags to use for recipes just like these.  I also used a corn and black bean salsa and added a little more corn to the meat mixture.  It gave it more color!  I will definitely be making this regularly.  Thanks for the great recipe.

An excellent Mexican Casserole. I'm away from my family for a while so cooking for one can be difficult. Because of that and using sour cream in the recipe, I couldn't eat it all before it would spoil. But still a great Mexican meal.

This is a great recipe to use as a base.  At the suggestion of others I added taco seasoning to the cooking beef as well as a can of green chiles and some diced onions and garlic.  I also added white onions to the top along with the green onions and omitted the olives.  I added guacamole after it was cooked.  There are a lot of things that can be added to this recipe to suit personal tastes and it makes a great dinner using a lot of things most people already have on hand.  Very hardy and delicious.

Wow!  This sounded so good but was not a hit with my family.  Possibly the brand of salsa???

I made this and it was delicious.  I didn't change anything.  I used pineapple-peach chipotle salsa, which added a little sweetness to it, I think.  Also, I didn't crush the chips, I just layered them on the bottom.  I think it kind of gave it a refried bean texture.  Anyway, great recipe!

My picky eaters LOVED this dish! I didn't have chili beans so I used a layer of refried beans instead. For the cheese, I used a house favorite - cheddar/monterey jack mix. Instead of taco seasoning, I simply used garlic, chili powder, cumin, and some salt to season the meat. Great dish!

This is delicious! I wouldn't change a thing about it.  I recently made 4 9x13's of this for a casserole party so we shall see how it turns out after being frozen.

Delicious...definitely a keeper.  I substituted plain pinto beans because I do not like chili beans, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

It was pretty basic but still good.  I did make a few changes to add more flavor to the dish.  I cooked my ground turkey with taco seasoning and added a bit of chili seasoning as well.  I think this is a must because otherwise it would lack a lot of flavor.  I also used corn tortillas and omitted the sour cream to make it healthier.  And to keep the flavors fresh I added the tomato and green onion at the very end of baking!

This is super yummy.  My husband raves about it everytime.  What I do is cooke it without the chips on the bottom and then when I serve it, I crush chips onto the plates and put the casserole on top.  That way the chips are fresh and crisp.  I put extra sourcream too.

This is easy breezy, and pretty darn good.  I substituted ground turkey breast, fat free sour cream, fat free sharp cheddar american slices, corn tortillas instead of chips, and added a package of taco seasoning to the turkey, making it very low fat and it was still really tasty.  I think next time instead of 2 cups of salsa I'm going to use Rotel tomatoes and chilis, for some extra zip.

Hubby loved this, I had to put fried corn tortillas, cut into strips instead of fritos because I didn't have any, I also used mozarella because I didn't have any other kind and was still good!

As someone else seemingly negatively called these "glorified nachos", I must positively call this a nacho-taco hybrid. My family loved it. There's really a lot of room for changes. I hate olives, so I left those out, I used lean ground turkey, low-fat sour cream, a mexican cheese blend, and about doubled the amount of tomatoes and green onions called for. My husband and daughter were fighting for leftovers.

Very easy to eat and good. Too many beans for my husband and I, I think next time I will cut out the beans and do maybe 1.5 pounds hamburger or 1/2 a can of beans instead of the whole can. Other then the beans we both really liked it!!

I did as they suggested and even using NO fat sour cream this is amazing!!!!  I added 1/4 cup red wine only because I add wine to just about everything. I will definitely make it again and maybe try low fat cheese next time. Great keeper recipe - loved it.

This was an excellent recipe that my family really enjoyed.  I agreed with other reviewers and added the taco seasoning to the meat, along with onion and garlic.  I didn't have green onions, but did have green chilies, so I used those and it tasted awesome!  Instead of tortilla chips, I used doritos.

Luckily I had everything for this at my house. Never happens.   But it was very very good.   I didn't add the sour cream until after and only baked for 15 min.  That kept the green onions crunchy and the tomatoes fresh.  We will def make again!

I pretty much made this as is, but used chipotle salsa and chipotle taco seasoning and browned a white onion with the ground meat (I used turkey).  I'll make it again but probably cut it in half.  Makes a lot!

This was wonderful!  I used a can of black beans instead of ranch beans just because black beans are my favorite.  I also used corn tortillas instead of chips, as someone else suggested, for less fat.  I doubled the tomatoes and green onions.  So good!

I made this dish over the weekend!  Ultra DELICIOUS!!!  And my family loved it.  Very tasty and super easy to make.  My dad is vegetarian so I substituted the ground beef for Morning Star Crumbles.  I look forward to trying it with the ground beef in the near future!

Love, love, love this recipe! I made minor modifications.. I used a refrigerated salsa instead of jarred. I think the chunky veggies and fresh taste made a huge difference in the dish. I divided the casserole into 2 pie plates instead of a casserole dish so that they would fit into my toaster oven. It's 115 degrees in AZ and I didn't want to heat up the kitchen. :) But the end result was amazing! I am freezing the 2nd casserole for us to eat later. Thanks for the recipe!!

Yummy...I did make some changes though.  1.Used taco seasoning as suggested elsewhere when cooking the meat. 2. omited the sour cream because my kids won't eat it  but used it on top after cooking. 3.  Made a mexican rice using homemade taco seasoning mix (both from this site) and layered it in the casserole.  4.  I cooked it for the 30 min but felt it would have been better if it was only for 20 min (probably because I added rice and the extra time dried it out a little too much).  5. Added jalapeno peppers on top with the olives.  6.  Used ro-tel tomatoes with chili peppers for extra kick.  This turned out really great with just enough spice.   Even my son had two helpings which is a real compliment.

I've made this several times and it's delicious!  The only thing I do different is mix all the ingredients together, rather than layering each.  This is an excellent dish.

Very yummy!  I omitted black olives as we don't eat them, but followed all other ingredients to a "T".  Very creamy and wonderful...not dry and crispy or hard to eat.  Great!  Will def. make again, thanks!! :-)

The family thought this was a delicious change from tacos.   I had one problem though. The chips/tortillas in the bottom get a bit soggy for my taste.  We attempted it a second time and crushed them up and added them to the top.  So much more yummy!

Very good! I work late one night a week, and am always looking for an easy casserole I can assemble in the AM that the hubby can pop on the oven that night. Was worried about the chips getting soggy, but the consistancy was great! Followed everything to the letter, will make again, my 2 year old even loved it!

Sooooooo good!  Didn't change a thing.  We make this several times  month.  It is a frequent request at our house.   My teenager asked me if we could have it once a week.  LOL!   Sometimes I make it with store bought chips, which is good, but other times I buy chips and salsa from my local Mexican Restaurant to use in this recipe (when I feel like splurging on pay day) and it's OUT OF THIS WORLD ....... GREAT GREAT GREAT!  The restaurant chips and salsa definately make a difference (the restaurant chips stay super crunchy as apposed to the store bought chips which can get a little soggy in this recipe) !!!!!  Definately a keeper though!!  YUMMY!!  YUMMY!  YUMMY!!!!

I followed the recipe almost exact, but added an extra half pound of hamburger. By time it had cooled off, the entire casserole dish was empty. Needless to say my family loved it!

This was quite yummy!  I even looked forward to the leftovers for the two days after I served this!  My alterations:  to the ground beef I added a can of diced green chilies, some garlic salt, paprika, red cayenne pepper, and some taco seasoning.  Then, I added one cup of salsa, and one cup of canned diced tomato with jalepenos.  The rest was as the directions called, and it had a wonderful flavor!  The next night I stirred up the reheated leftoversand, topped it with cheese, and put it in a taco shells, and the family once again gobbled up the meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

I make this for my 15 month old, so I omit the tortillas.  I also used shredded chicken instead of beef for something different.  This last time I made it I also added a layer of smashed avocado.  My son loves it everytime.  I've also experimented making it with different beans - usually black beans and pinto beans since I can get them in low sodium.

Really a good dish.  Just needed more spices but you can doctor it up to your taste buds.  I don't even like beans but I enjoyed this casserole.

Great and easy recipe! I followed others suggestions and added taco seasoining and black beans to the meat in addition to chopped onions and jalapenos. In the layering I added rotel diced tomatos with habeneros for som extra heat.  My husband and I loved it!

This was fantastic.  I also used black beans instead of chili beans. My kids and I loved it as is, but my husband wants more meat, an extra layer of cheese in the middle, and sour cream on top instead of in it, so we'll try that next time.  :0)

Really yummy. Hubby loved it. I added onions, garlic ,taco sesaoning and adobo to ground beef. I used fresh salsa, low fat cheese and sour cream. I also combined diced red and green peppers with the tomato and green onion. The multigrain tortilla chips from Trader Joes held up really well and weren't soggy at all.

This was very good, but I changed it and made it vegetarian and low fat.  I used soy taco stuffers, fat free greek yogurt and just a bit of lowfat cheddar on top. I also put the chips on top so they would not get soggy - others mentioned they got soggy.  It had plenty of flavor because the soy was flavored and I used hot salsa!

I read all the reviews and made the following changes: After browing the grd beef I added 1 packet of taco seasoning with 2/3 cup water.  Also seasoned with garlic powder, chile powder and salt. I used a can of drained/rinsed pinto beans instead of the chile beans.  I did not crush the tortilla chips.  I put down a layer of whole chips, meat sauce, sour cream, then another 1/2 layer of chips, meat sauce, green onions and tomatoes and topped with the cheese.  This was terrific!  A definite keeper.

I made this to take to the field during harvest. 2 guys devoured 3/4ths of the pan. They raved at how good it was. For them I used the hot chili beans and hot salsa. This recipe I will definitely make again. Easy and good.

My family just loved this-the flavors (minus the olives) are amazing together.  My family did, however, think it made a better dip than main dish.  Next made it by adding a can of refried beans-a much loved item in our house. Third time will make it by layering with tortilla shells for a "mexican lasagna".  Love it-thank you so much for a great recipe!

Here are the changes I made, other than that I followed the recipe. I added a chopped onion to the browned meat, also added 1 1/2 tsp chopped garlic, 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1 1/2 tsp cumin. Used a can of pinto beans and 1 cup green onions and 1 whole tomato chopped. The flavor was perfect. I will make it again but not as a meal, it was more like something we would serve with chips to eat while watching football. Good recipe!

I didn't really enjoy the crushed chips at the bottom of the pan as they were soggy.  So next time I'll add tortillas  as the bottom.  I used a homemade salsa and put in 2 c of yogert instead of sour cream.  Did everything else according to the recipe.  Didn't see the need for taco seasoning.  This recipe has enough flavor going for it.  I'll prolly make it again without the crushed chips at the bottom of the pan.

I made it according to recipe.  Wife and friend enjoyed it much, however I was a little disappointed.  Not the fault of the recipe, just that I found it lacking in the sense of really good TexMex food.  Can't think of what I would change, other than perhaps a more flavorful salsa. Maybe the addition of some chili powder.  It didn't "zing".

Made this tonight as comfort food for a family member who received some tough news. Did the trick. Left out olives (yuck!). Added a layer of smooth, crushed ripe avocado (you'll need at least 4) before the sour cream. This really did something special to the flavor! Drained the meat prior to adding a big can of chili con carne in place of taco spices and beans. Added 1/2 a large fresh green chili pepper chopped fine for added kick. YUMMY! Will make again in the future. Bon apetit!

Total hit! Guys and my 3 yrs old LOVED IT! I added a can of black beans and still yummy :) Wondering how well leftovers would reheat (because of the chips) I didn't have any leftovers from this dish!

Made the recipe exactly as written here, and it was YUM!  We all had thirds!  I think adding the taco seasoning is a great idea.  My only complaint was that it was a teensy bit bland, but that was just fine for my husband and 5 year old.

Family loved this one and its easy to make. Left out the black olives, used taco cheese on top and traded ground beef for diced cooked chicken. Topped with chopped lettuce and sour cream.

Very good.  I also used the taco seasoning with the ground beef and threw in some onion.  This was a perfect recipe for using up some "leftovers" or for just using what was on hand.  I have four boys and between them and hubby.... it's gone!  We layered it and called it "Mexican lasagna."

My only complaint is that the chips layer is soggy & very chewy-otherwise this would be a 5 star recipe! I think next time I'll serve this over freshly crushed chips instead of baking them in the casserole. Very flavorful & super easy!

Really good!  I added cilantro and Rotel to the meat.  Left out the sour cream.  I will try taco shells in place of the chips b/c they do get soggy.

this was different and easy. i liked it okay, but if i make it again i think i would at ieast double the meat. we're meat eaters though. so if meats not that important to you it's probably gonna be just right. thanks for the post.

This recipe was delicious! Made it for my boyfriend and we both loved it. I took the suggestions from other members and added 1 can of black beans while cooking the ground beef. Then I added a can of rotel, a can of green chilis, a can of mexicorn, and 1 packet of mild taco seasoning to the mixture. Will definately make again.

Good recipe as written, no complaints and everyone enjoyed it.  Next time when I browned the ground beef I added a small diced onion & a package of taco seasoning...this kicked it up a notch and family liked it even more.

Good & Easy. (I didn't bother with the Black Olives and wish I would have had the onion...maybe that is why I felt it still could have had more "zing" (flavor) but the teenage boys like it! 3/2009

Pretty good... I added the recipe Taco Seasoning I to the meat. I used black beans instead of chili beans. The chips turned to mush, I don't really see the point of them. It had good flavor and will definetly be making it again.

This turned out wonderful! Instead of 2 cups of salsa, I did one.  I also added a packet of taco seasoning. Instead of chili beans I used black beans.  The chips do get a little bit mushy, but the overall flavor was still fantastic.

Loved it! I can't get enough of it. The only thing I did different was I used black beans instead of the ones it called for and crunched up chips on top as well and added a little fresh cilintro.

i thought this was great. i too used ground turkey and i also used black beans instead of chili beans. i had the fiesta tortilla chips that are multi-colored, so i crushed some chips over the top too, along w/ all the other toppings. it's appeal was as great as it's taste!

This was really good.  I did use the taco seasoning on the meat as others suggested, and it turned out great.  However, I think I will omit the chips on the bottom and serve this as a dip.  Probably the best mexican dip ever!

To spice this up a little, I would recommend jalapenos be added to the dish.  I am going to try using shredded chicken the next time.  Very easy.

This was terrible, I ended up throwing the whole thing out!  The chips were soggy, I didn't care for the consistency of the heated sour cream, and it lacked any kind of flavor.

This was a great recipe! My family is pretty skeptical when it comes to dinner all in one dish. There are a few things I had to change like I omitted the tortillas on the bottom, they got pretty soggy and we ate around them. Instead, when I made it a second time, I put a layer of salsa and refried beans (so it's moist and won't stick) and save the chips for topping when all is complete. I only had a yellow onion and that worked just fine. I added green olives for extra flavor and jalepeno flavored stewed tomatoes. Also, we like sour cream and salsa mixed so I added a cup of each to the recipe and mixed them for the topping! Over all, definatly a new family favorite and a keeper!

This was really easy and very good.  We ate it like nachos with tortilla chips on the side.  I did make some modifications:  I added onion to the meat mix and taco seasoning, added green pepper to the green onion mix, and used black beans instead of chili beans.  It was really good and fast.  Great last minute dinner!

This recipe turned out well.  I used corn tortillas layered on the bottom instead of the tortillas chips, put taco seasoning in the  meat and substituted black beans for the chili beans. It had a really good flavor.  Will try tortilla chips next time to see how that changes the flavor.

My husband couldn't stop eating this?  It is really good.  First bite I thought this is just ok (I halved the recipe)but it just kept getting better with each bite.  I only had kidney beans but they were good in it.  I also added hot peppers to the top before baking!

Yum! I used a packet of taco seasoning in the ground beef as suggested by other reviewers and cut the salsa in half. This was good, easy, and a definite crowd pleaser!

I like this recipe a lot also.  I did use more seasonings like taco season and a little fajita season to give it a kick. I also used dorito chips and the flavor is awesome!!! Will try using corn tortillas like another viewer. This will be a keeper!!!!

Liked this recipe very much. I also used nacho Dorritos instead of the tortilla chips. I layered the meat mixture first and put the chips on top so the chips didn't get soggy. I also used a taco seasoning packet with the meat mixture. Make sure you don't over cook or at least cover it with aluminum foil. Over cooking will dry the dish out. It was very good, I will make it again.

LOVED IT!  To make this VEGETARIAN friendly, I made the following changes to the meat mixture...two pouches of boca soy crumbles, taco seasoning, one can of ranch style beans (undrained), and one cup of salsa.  Also, I topped the casserole with black olives after it cooked instead of baking them in...and fresh cilantro too.

This was very easy to prepare and turned out tasting yummy. I don't think it is a 5 star recipe because it didn't have a "wow" factor, it was good, but not amazing.

I modified the recipe quite bit ‚Äì added a packet of taco seasoning while browning the meat, used black beans and a can of diced tomatoes  I also omitted the black olives and green onion as well.  Overall it came out good, but definitely nothing special.  The consistency was more like a dip than a meal.  The tortilla chips added nothing to the flavor ‚Äì just empty calories as I see it.  I‚Äôd much prefer to eat the dish with chips after it‚Äôs done cooking so you can actually taste them.  Makes a lot of leftovers which is nice.

Very good!  The only change I made was to substitute green chiles for the olives.  And I used hot pace picante sauce and hot salsa instead of just salsa.

Very easy to prep with ingredients I usually have on hand.  Next time I think I may use plain yogurt instead of sour cream and mix it with a little taco seasoning to up the flavor and ease up the calories little.  You could totally add a can of corn or another thing of beans as well and it would be delicious.  Thanks for a keeper!

Not sure why we didn't like this as I was looking for a mexican casserole without cream soup as an ingredient. I did add fiesta corn and taco seasoning to the ground beef but I really felt it lacked much flavor and was on the dry side. We like mexican food, all the ingredients listed and casseroles but this just didn't add up to much of anything.

My household contains only my husband and myself - so we got to enjoy the leftovers.    We both happily ate it for lunches and had to negotiate over the last serving.

This is definitely a new favorite recipe.

I made this vegetarian using Morningstar "Meat" crumbles.  I used a combo of 1 can Ranch Style black beans and 1 can kidney beans because I like beans.  I also tossed in some frozen corn for its mild sweetness.  Oh yeah, and I used salsa-flavored tortilla chips too.  It was so easy to just plop stuff into my pan - truly a plus because I don't like the cleanup.

This was great1  I made a veggie version by browning crumbled tofu with taco seasoning, then mixing with a sauteed garlic and onions, a can of black beans and a can of corn.  I added red pepper and mexican chili seasoning and baked it without the sour cream - we loved it!

Loved it! was a little unsure about using the crushed tortilla chips, but they actually made a nice "crust". A great way to use up the last of a bag of chips. Also, I used a pkt. of taco seasoning w/the meat....will make again.

Love it!  I decided to garnish with sour cream, geen onion, and added lettuce rather then cook it with them.  I added some taco seasoning and used ground turkey and pinto beans.  I also skiped the olives.  Turned out great I made a 1/2 recipie but I should have made the whole thing because we ate it all!

Went down well, I chose to jazz up the beef mince also, using the recomended Taco seasoning, onion, garlic, corn etc... put less Doritos on the bottom, they did go a bit soggy but they blended in and the flavour was there. Mince on top then a thin layer of lite sour cream sprinkled on chopped tomato  green onion and grated chese and into the oven to brown. Not a speck left.

We love this recipe but I've made a few changes.  I use Doritos and add taco seasoning.  One day while making this some of the kids and grandkids came so I stretched it by adding some cooked rotini, adding a can of undrained Italian diced tomatoes and more salsa so it wasn't dry.  My husband now calls it Tex Mex lasagna and asks for it often.

Very good casserole although the fat content is what brings this down.But I confess,I'll definately be making this again.Next time though I'll try lowering the fat by using plain yogurt instead of sour cream and low fat cheese.The only addition I made to this recipe was to add 3 seeded and chopped jalapenos.It had a nice spice level but next time I'll use 4 or 5.I also used jalapeno/cheddar flavored tortilla chips for the base like one other reviewer suggested.Thanks Andrea.

Overall, a good recipe.  My family liked it. I thought it was a little bland. I also added more chips.  Next time I may add taco season as suggested by other reviews.

This was one of the better Mexican casserole recipes I've come across.  We've tried a number of them, but this one offered a lot of color and flavor compared with most!

This was wonderful!!!!  I made it vegetarian by using Quorn brand meat free grounds, and used a can of vegetarian chili in place of the beans.  I also used corn tortillas on the bottom in place of chips based on a review, and low fat sour cream.  I havled the recipe for our family of three.  This would be great for a pot-luck or party.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a great recipe that even my kids enjoyed (9 & 8).  I will use some modifications next time though to lighten it up a bit.  Overall a quick, easy, family friendly recipe.

I LOVED this! I liked the beef mixture. I think if you added taco seasoning, it'd be too much like tacos! I used diced tomaotes instead of fresh and it was delicious. I only used two cups of chips. Very good! My husband liked it best served with tortilla chips on the side. So yummy!

We really liked this a lot! It was as easy as hamburger helper, but tasted soooo much better.  The perfect combination of Mexican flavors and crunch.  My husband wants the leftovers tomorrow!  As some of the other reviewers suggested, I substituted a can of corn for the olives, and also added a bit of chili powder and cumin.  This dish is going into my rotation!

Pretty good.  I added some chili powder, garlic, and cumin to the meat mixture.  I used homemade salsa, and added green chilis to the sour cream.  Fresh tomatoes are gross in the wintertime, so I left them off.  I put 2/3 of the chips on the bottom, and then 1/3 of them on top of the sour cream.  This was tasty, but I thought it was just a little bit dry.

Great recipe. I make variations of this all the time now! My only complaint is that it does not come out of the dish well like a lasanga would... But I would not use eggs or anything to get it to stay together better. Thanks for the great recipe Andrea!

This was a very good recipe! Everyone in my house loved it including my 1 and 3 year old children. I did add taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I used a can of refried beans instead of chili beans.  Thanks for the great recipe. Will definitely use again.

This was a very easy recipe.  I added onions and my own taco spices to the meat.  I used thick and chuncky salsa so I dind't have to let mine thicken that long, maybe about 5 minutes or so.  I also did not use the tomoatoes, olives or green onions since I used thick and chunky salsa and don't like olives.  Family liked it a lot, including VERY picky 4 year old son.  Would definately make this again as it was a quick, easy and very tasty dinner.

I thought this was very good!!  Per other reviewers suggestions, I added a packet of taco seasoning to the meat along with the salsa (and 2/3 cup water).  I also added about 1/2 a can of corn with red and green peppers into the meat.  I skipped the sour cream in the dish (because I can't stand the stuff) and served some on the side instead (for those who can).  I split the casserole into two smaller ones...ate one last night and put the other in the freezer for later!

I made this recipe for my family and they loved, I made a few changes though, my husband doesn't like beans or onions. So I add garlic,chilli powder, and greek seasoning. Mom asked for the recipe. Even my 9 yr old nephew liked, and he is very picky.

I used all lowfat ingredients for this (ground turkey, fat free sour cream, etc.)  It still came out pretty good and my husband loved it.  Although I'm sure the "full fat" version is probably better!

YUM!  Super easy, all ingredients are things you'd have on hand.....
I'd use less of the beans though.  Definate thumbs up from my parents and myself.
Will make again.

Simply delicious. Very easy. Big hit at parties! I sometimes put out extra ingredients for those who like a bit more sour cream or salsa, etc. Even some guacamole as a side offering can be a hit.

The chips on the bottom got kinda mushy, so we added them to the top as well as the bottom.  Very good.

Added some more Mexican seasonings and Muir Glen organic salsa.  Layered the meat, sour cream, green onions, and chopped fresh tomatoes on top.  I then crumbled the tortilla chips.  Everyone loved it!

I think it was bland and a little dry.  I drained the meat mixture, maybe I won‚Äôt next time.  I was a short on salsa too.  I did add a packet of taco seasoning to the meat mixture.

Followed recipe except no tortilla chips or cooking spray-used a tsp of EVOO; white (not yellow!) corn tortillas and large whole  black olives-my personal preferences.  If you  find thick white corn tortillas use those.  If you use regular white corn tortillas ( which are thin) double it.  I lined dish with corn tortillas.  I split a couple of tortillas in halves and quarters to line dish.  Family really enjoyed it and yes it's  a keeper.

This was a wonderful recipe!  Per the suggestion of others, I added the packet of taco seasoning with the 2/3 water required.. I also substituted black beans because that‚Äôs what I had on hand. I also added a can of corn.   This is definitely a keeper!

I made this last evening and it was easy and so colorful and attractive in my baking pan.   I used all the best and suggested ingredients.

When I served it, it was too dry...not moist or juicy.   I'd definitely make this again, but I would add a little chicken broth or a juicier salsa. 

Definitely make this, but watch your liquid additions.

Enjoy!

Enjoyed the casserole very much.  Big Hit with my Grandsons.  I made it with mild salsa.   Next time I would make it with a spicier salsa.

Easy peasy.   But mine was sort of bland... if I make it again I‚Äôd definitely use a spicy salsa, pepper flakes or cayenne... maybe some cilantro and jalape√±o... all the flavor in mine was from the salsa and that wasn‚Äôt enough.

I made this for our New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner. Having cooked for my husband for over 20 years, he said... ‚ÄúI think this is the best recipe you‚Äôve ever made!‚Äù Wow! I did add my own homemade version of taco seasoning to the meat as I browned it, added a ‚ÄúSmokey‚Äù salsa to the meat and did not skimp on olives and green onions...and used black beans as another reviewer did. . I had no chips so did two layers of flour tortillas so it was more like a lasagna. And that second layer of tortillas made it easier to spread the sour cream! I didn‚Äôt have enough cheddar so added in Monterrey. Will SO make this again. This is a winner and great football game food!

Sounds good, but I'm going to add the tomatoes, and green onion when it comes out.  I don't like hot tomatoes and love fresh green onoins.  I do have to comment though, on the video I hated to see them using such gorgeous, perfectly formed chips to crush them.  LOL - how many times do you really see such "pretty" chips?  Certainly not when you're having a party and want them for dip!  LOL.

This was fantastic.  Note, as others have mentioned, chips basically become so soft that the whole casserole has the same texture throughout.

I did add a packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef while browning it.  The chips get soggy (only reason for 4 stars rather than 5)- I would serve them on the side next time.  I will reduce sour cream to 1 cup next time.  It  was enjoyed by my family and makes for great left overs!!!!

I liked this recipe.  I did a few things to make it my own:  Added taco seasoning mix to the ground beef, I also used refried black beans instead of chili beans.  For tortilla chips I used jalapeno flavored tortilla chips and added chili peppers to the olives for spice.

We really enjoyed this dish.  I did add a packet of taco seasoning to the hamburger and then some frozen corn to the hamburger/salsa mixture.  The mixture seemed a little dry so I added a little chicken broth to right consistency.  I divided this up into two 8 x 8 casserole dishes and froze one.  The one I froze I didn't add the green onions, etc.  The other one I continued as directed.  It was a thumbs up with my hubby!!!  Me too!!!  Thanks AndrealF63 for an easy and tasty recipe.  It's one we enjoy 'now and later'!

Added 1 pkg of taco seasoning,can of drained corn and black beans.  Made the night b/4 and it was a huge hit with picky kids that only like mac & cheese!  This is amazingly easy and fast to make and will be making this casserole this winter.  Thanks for this recipe !

I've made this half a dozen times now, and it's always a winner. I use light-life crumble and even my meat eating wife loves it. Easy to put together and easy to devour.

Added some taco seasoning because we like spicy. As others have said it's a little too dry, if I make again I will try and put a layer of cheese over the meat then layer other ingredients.

My kids and I LOVED this dish. I tweeked it slightly the second time and used taco seasoning in the meat. It was like eating an awesome beef taco with a fork. It is delicious!

The only change I made was add taco seasoning to the ground beef. My husband tends to think that if something tastes really really good, like this casserole, it's "unhealthy." I told him that by using black bean and garlic multigrain chips, lean ground beef, fat free sour cream and low fat cheddar cheese it wasn't that bad... You know it's good when you have to hide the leftovers in the back of the fridge so your husband will stop eating it.... :) loved it!

Delicious! My whole family loved this recipe. However, even though I made sure the meat absorbed the liquid it still made my tortilla chips a little chewy. That extra texture of the crispy tortilla chips really helps to balance the dish. I would definitely make this recipe again but make a few tweaks.

Made a few variations and LOVED it!  We are cilantro lovers so we added that. In addition I made a pan WITHOUT chips and a pan with. We prefer without so we can crush them up and sprinkle on top (some people like a few I like a lot of chips) so it worked better for us. LOVE it. You will totally enjoy with variations or none at all.  :)

Easy to make. When I baked it, came out limp and soggy. Just, no. Not for a Mexican dish. Gonna try it again but I beleive that I'll skip the oven part.

Really good recipe. Recommend not crushing the tortilla chips for the base too much, it gets a little crumbly. But will definitely make it again!

This was so easy to do. Only regret was wishing I had followed the recipe on the amount of chips. I cut them down based on the several reviews saying to. They get soggy in the cooking phase in doing so. Will be making again. Oh I did leave out the black olives but only because my kido won‚Äôt touch anything with them. Don‚Äôt think it changed the overall taste tho. Give it a try. It‚Äôs yummy.

Easy, especially if you have already cooked and frozen the ground beef.  I used ranch-style pinto beans, and used colby jack cheese. Leftovers reheat well.

This is a KEEPER for my family. Tried it in vegan and vegetarian version for quite a few times and it's been a success. Used Yves Mexican ground meat for both versions. For the vegan one I used vegan sour cream and Daiya cheddar cheese. The vegetarian casserole received the regular sour cream and cheddar and mozzarella medley. Thank you for this recipe!

We made this today, and enjoyed it. My kids had seconds. I will say, I think the chips is weird. They get soft, rather than stay crispy, and while it‚Äôs not bad, it definitely doesn‚Äôt add to the dish. Maybe next time I‚Äôll cook it without the chips, and then scoop it over top. We didn‚Äôt add olives and cooked with taco seasoning! Next time may add some chopped jalape√±os for spice!

I will make this again. I used a ground turkey instead of hamburger. I put in chopped up garlic & red onion, along with medium strength chunky salsa. Also used kalamata olives & white corn. I kicked up the heat a bit with a light sprinkling of cayenne powder, added a tsp  of Mrs Dash onto the turkey with no  added salt.

Quick, easy and delicious.
Mine was a bit dry. I'll add more salsa next time.
Will make it again.

I made the recipe exactly as stated, I did not make modifications like many of the other reviews. The ground beef was not flavorful enough. The salsa didn‚Äôt do a whole lot to add to the depth of flavoring. Also, the sour cream looked like little pieces of rice after it was cooked. I‚Äôm sure if I had used the modifications other people have used, it probably would have been much better.

I followed the recipe as directed but added taco seasoning packet to the meat.  I had started everything and found out the pantry was bare of kidney beans so I had to improvise.  I added rather than the kidney beans, a layer of refried beans over the meat and a cup of black beans and rice.  Turned out perfect!  Neighbors stopped by while eating and they finished the dish!  Will make again.

Well....the pan is empty!  Made this EXACTLY as written. I could give it 5 stars, but I felt it was missing something, and not.  I‚Äôm not suggesting that the actual base recipe needs to be changed, but the recipe really needs the brightness that red enchilada sauce or taco sauce or really, it could be any sauce you prefer.  But it definitely needs some sort of sauce.  Thank you so much for

I read reviews before attempting to make this. I made some adjustments. I used taco seasoning and fresh corn cut right from the cob in with the beef before adding the salsa.

I also used 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes with chilies instead of just salsa. 

Finally I used tex Mex cheese instead of regular cheddar.

This turned out AMAZING! If you're thinking of making it... DO IT!

Will definitely make again.  Added taco seasoning to ground beef for a little more flavor.  Also sprinkled cilantro and squeezed fresh lime over top after baking.

This is a great recipe.  Chili yumminess in every bite.  I made it with ground turkey rather than beef.  It makes 6-8 servings.  Since there are only two of us, I divided the leftovers into smaller casseroles, refrigerated one for later in the week and froze the other.  I didn't have chili beans on hand so I made my own from a simple recipe I found online:  Combine 1 can kidney beans, 2 T. tomato paste, 1/4 c. water, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. chili powder, 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1 T. olive oil in a 1 qt. sauce pan and simmer for 15 min. stirring occasionally.  Also, I left out the olives because my husband doesn't like them.

Real good. I made a few changes that may or may not have improved it. I'm sure it was great as posted. I always drain and rinse ground beef. I added onions and taco seasoning just to up the flavor a bit. I used less chips than called for, and used refried black beans since dh doesn't like the others. It was great. Served with mexican rice.

My 13 year old daughter found this recipe and decided to make it for her turn at family dinner night.  It looked quick and easy.  My husband and I were less than thrilled with the look of the recipe, as it called for heating up the sour cream, and no taco seasoning.  HOWEVER, we were pleasantly surprised by its flavor!
Changes--she used only 1 1/2 cups of salsa because she worried it would be too spicy.  She also decided not to crush the chips.  
People who don't like the "soggy" chips are really missing the point of this recipe.  The chips basically turn into soft corn tortillas, which is great because I rarely have fresh ones on hand.  If you don't like the taste of the corn tortillas, just switch it out for flour tortillas cut into squares or strips. We used medium salsa from Costco, and it was flavorful without adding taco seasoning.  Might I suggest adding the sour cream to the meat mixture instead of making a layer in the casserole?  That might help the curdling effect.
We will definitely make this again.  And again and again and again.  Versatility makes it possible to add corn, use black beans, change cheeses, etc.

I made this dish to serve 12. I added chipotle powdwr to my ground beef. I added two cans of drained  Rotel with chilies as well. I did not use any chips on the bottom, as I made it to use as a burrito/taco  filling. Great way to feed a crowd!  I served the green onion, chopped olives, jalape√±os and shredded lettuce on the side. Easy to make ahead and delicious!

This turned out Great! I followed the recipe with a a few additions. First: I used 1.5 lbs ground chuck, drained and saved 5 teas of beef drippings (added back in for flavor).
Second: I added about 3 tbs of chili powder, 2tbs of garlic powder and 1tbs of garlic salt. Thirdly: I used Doritos Taco chips, lightly broken. This recipe has great texture, flavor and looks very delicious!!! It was not soggy just pure flavor! Thank you for this recipe!  Carol : )

I know better than to make a recipe before reading the reviews.  As published, the recipe is lacking. The corn tortilla chips  were soggy on the bottom.  The sour cream curdled.   I would follow others and cook hamburger with taco seasoning,  layer twice as in lasagna.   Refried black beans would be better than the chili beans

I may try it again by  mixing taco seasoning in with the hamburgers, and then mixing the cheese into the hamburger mix.  I would not cook the hamburger until the salsa liquid had been absorbed because as written, the meat was dry.  Then  before serving, spoon the meat onto the crushed tortilla,  layering  the ingredients twice , using heated refried beans rather than chili beans, and perhaps sprinkle a little cheddar on to the top.  I would delete the 30 minutes cooking in the oven and serve as is so that the sour cream did not curdle and the tortilla chips remained crisp

I made this for Cinco de Mayo and all of it left. This is quick and delicious dish. The only change I made was to season the meat. I always season my meat even when the recipe doesn‚Äôt call for it to be seasoned. I will make this again.

Easy and good! I sprinkled half a packet of taco seasoning over beef while Browning and used black beans. I also used about 3/4 cup each of tomatoes and green onions to use up what I had on hand. Will make again thank you for sharing your recipe! Notes for next time: it's baked uncovered, used colby jack

I used ground Turkey and added seasonings to my meat (SPG, cumin and paprika). Everyone enjoyed, kids only complained about the green onions and black olives which I expected.

This is wonderful! Due to medical reasons, I cannot eat certain foods and spices, one being taco seasoning. Problem is, I absolutely ADORE tacos and burritos. Anyways, I don't seem to have a problem with eating salsa, andcooking out all the juice made this the perfect new taco meat for me! Since I was making this in advance I didn't put the chips in, so I added refried beans on the bottom, then the meat mixture( I added black beans yes lots of beans in this one!!) Then did everything  else the way the recipe says. I served it like a dip, where everyone just plopped some on their plate anddig in with some chips. On another note, I've never cooked sour cream this way before and I was a little hesitant, but I'm so glad I stayed true to the recipe, I think it was one of my favorite parts. It was like a cooked 7 layer dip, sooo good!! Needless to say, I WILL be making this again.  Prolly once a week since that's how often I crave Mexican! Thanks for sharing this, you've saved me from a life without taco meat, and introduced a new family staple!

Made this tonight and was told this is a keeper.  I changed a few things... Layered the bottom of the pan with broken, not crushed, tortilla chips. About 2 cups. Added chopped onion and tri colored chopped bell peppers and garlic and a half of a pack taco seasoning to the browned meat. Used 1 can black beans instead of chili beans and added a can of corn (both drained). Used thick and chunky salsa to make sure the mixture of the meat did not have too much moisture. Omitted the sour cream and served on the side. Also omitted the black olives. Topped with Mexican mixed cheese and chopped tomatoes and green onions. Baked for 30 minutes and then added some more cheese and broken tortilla chips and Doritos Nacho chips on broil. Watch closely. That can burn fast.

This was delicious the first night and even better the next day! Like others I browned the meat with half an onion and a half packet of taco seasoning. Used a can of kidney beans and half a can of black beans. Subbed Greek yogurt for the sour cream and corn tortillas for the tortilla chips. Used a Mexican cheese blend and a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. It turned out great!

Family loved it but I made a few changes as a result of reading the reviews. First, I used lamb ground meat.  We just don't eat ground meat, only lamb and bison, so this was just a personal preference. When preparing the meat, I added 1 onion, garlic, and a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce. When the dish was ready for the salsa, I also added a can of Rotel with green chiles since some reviewers complained that it came out dry. I also didn't use fresh tomatoes since I had already added the Rotel.  For the cheese, I put 1 cup of cheddar and 1 cup of pepper jack.  Lastly, and most importantly, instead of using tortilla chips, I used 2 bags of the Santa Fe flavored tortilla strips that you put on salads.  When it was time to layer it, I took into consideration that some reviewers said that it made the tortilla chips soggy, so I layered it in the following order: meat, sour cream, cheese, tortilla strips, cheese.  Casserole came out great. It was extremely flavorful and the chips/strips were not in the least bit soggy. This one is a definite keeper.

Really easy, substitutions are easy as long as whatever you add isn‚Äôt too wet.
I had a few cups of bean and lentil sprouts (I omitted the tinned beans ) and some older ground elk to use up, and the salsa and chilli and cumin powder I saut√©ed them in made them taste great. 
I didn‚Äôt have any sour cream, so I used a tiny bit of cottage cheese and layered some ripe avocado slices I had to use up. 
Also I used a cup of tomato‚Äôs and a cup of green onions instead of half cups

Great recipe! My family doesn‚Äôt like beans so I had to substitute those with corn. I used a 16 ounce bag of frozen corn which I cooked first. It was very yummy. My Mother in Law lives with us so I had to make a small portion of this with mild salsa and the larger part with hot salsa for the rest of us. It was a hit all around.

The family really liked this.  It will be one of my "go to" recipes when I need to make a casserole for church or some similar group occasion, or just when I want to feed the family and be sure to have some leftovers.

It was easy to fix.  The spiciness level can be varied easily by changing the type of salsa that's used, making it readily adjustable for whoever will be eating.

I subbed flour tortillas for the chips on the bottom, and used black beans instead of chili beans.  And I love taco salads, so I ate my serving over a bed of romaine and corn chips. This is so yummy and so quick! 5 stars

This is far more delicious than it deserves to be for how easy it is to prepare. It's also a very colorful and visually pleasing dish. It's very easy to spice up or down just by using hot or mild salsa, or both. I added a small can of sliced jalape√±os and used hot chili beans. This is very forgiving if you don't have quite enough of one thing or another. Also tasted delicious the next day once all the gooey goodness has had time to mingle. Thanks for this one!

I made this for a church youth group.  I was told it was enjoyed by all.  I put some of the ingredients on the side in case olives and green onions weren't cared for by anyone.  I served it will chips and salsa and sour cream.

Made it as directed, and it was just ok. Unsurprisingly, the crushed up tortilla chips on the bottom were just a soggy mess after cooking. Also, the sour cream layer didn‚Äôt hold up great. We had leftovers; we won‚Äôt waste them, but we won‚Äôt make this again.

Super simple to make.  My husband doesn't like sour cream so I mixed one packet of taco seasoning to the 2 cups of sour cream., he never said a word as he gobbled this up and asked for seconds. This would be perfect for parties.

I subbed most ingredients in this recipe, but kept the basic structure in tact.  Quite good!  
Used black beans instead of chili, chicken instead of beef, and authentic shredded Mexican cheese (off white and creamier than cheddar). Also added a little yogurt based avocado/cilantro "dressing" in a bottle (which I use in almost all of my Tex-Mex/Mexican dishes).

This is a great recipe for a busy weekday dinner.  The taste is great and it satisfies your craving for restaurant  style Mexican food. I made it as is and would make it again.

Awesome!!! I do prefer to not put chips on the bottom of the casserole. We use chips to eat this just as a dip. I also like to add a little chilli powder to the ground beef when cooking. This is a great recipe!!

I‚Äôve made this many times... it is frequently requested by my teenagers. It‚Äôs a great recipe and you can make it your own. I always make additions or deletions based on what I have in the house. One thing I have added that I loved is Serrano peppers... spicy and a great flavor

I made this delicious casserole today. After I pulled it out of the oven, I placed shredded lettuce on the top for a crunchy texture. My husband loved it. We ate it by scooping up the casserole with tortilla chips. Use the round chips, they scoop better!

This was a hit with the whole family; even our mega-picky child! We changed the beans to a can of refried beans, used mild picante instead of salsa, nixed the green onions, and added a second layer of crushed tortilla chips right before the shredded cheese finale. Such excellent, warm comfort food during this cold winter!

I cut this recipe in half. It was the perfect size for my husband and I. I only had about a quarter cup of sour cream on hand so I mixed it with an avocado.  This was a delicious substitution. I used black beans instead of chili beans. Others suggested adding taco seasoning to the meat but I didn‚Äôt have any. I added chopped onion and green pepper and a pinch of chipotle along with some salt and pepper. The chips were blue corn. I will make this again.

This is a good recipe but I am surprised that it calls for chips. Chips, although delicious, are unhealthy and fried in oils that are basically not good for us. I found that using corn tortillas was a better option and they are much healthier.  We loose the benefit of the crunch after baking these items together anyway. I decided to save the chips for snacking on!

I‚Äôm by no means a great cook, but this was very easy to make and was very delicious! The only thing I did different with the recipe was replace green onions (not a fan of them) and cut up a regular yellow onion and saut√©ed it with the ground beef. This feeds lots of people and makes for a great family meal!

Added garlic to the beef, as well as taco seasoning,  Used mild chili flavored beans (Bush) draining only some of the liquid (let the liquid simmer for 15 minutes to reduce).  Used crushed tortilla chips as well as a layer of round bite size chips.  Didn't alter other ingredients.  Key I think though, was using 8x8 dish so layers were thick.  LOVED it.

I used 2 lbs of ground beef, added taco seasoning and dried onions, 3 cups salsa, and a large can of rotel in place of the tomatoes. I also crushed 3 c of spicy nacho cheese Doritos in place of plain tortilla chips. I didn‚Äôt care for the texture of the chips. Next time I will tear up up flour tortillas to layer the bottom. I waited until the last 5 minutes to add the cheese.

My husband rated this as a 4. Pretty easy. Just a couple of changes that I made was to add taco seasoning to the beef, I used black beans instead of chili bean and I probably used less than a cup of tortilla chips. My husband would have liked more. And I used a can of diced tomatoes rather a fresh tomato and I think it was find.

Great recipe! I was looking around for an easy Mexican casserole recipe to make tonight when I found this one.
I did make a few changes. I really am not the type that changes up a recipe just because I think my idea will be better than the original writer's, but typically change ingredients to improvise for what I have on hand. 
My family is pretty big - there are nine of us and four of them are teenage boys! So, I doubled the recipe, used 3 lb of 73% ground beef and used warm water to wash off the fat after cooking it. I added one pack of El Paso taco seasoning to the ground beef at the same time I put the salsa in. 
Someone else recommended not using as many chips, so I used 3 cups crushed for the whole (doubled) recipe and found that to be quite enough - 2 would have probably been fine. If you do go with less, just don't crumble them as much so they will cover the bottom of the pan. 
Black olives are not allowed in my recipes (don't tell hubby - he loves them!). I used one can of whole kernel corn (drained) and only one can of black beans since DD doesn't care for them. This combo worked out really well!  As did the 4 cups (remember I doubled my recipe) of sour cream. However, hubby and I both found ourselves using more sour cream as a condiment. We also served this up with Tostitos and salsa! We all - little and big kids too - loved it!

Very good, and will likely make again. Too heavy on the fat content to eat regularly. Good for House parties.

Easy casserole to make for a church potluck.  I used black beans, 1/2 can of tomatoes with green chiles, multigrain chips and I eliminated the olives.  It disappeared quickly.

I didn't change anything. Though, not all of my liquid absolved so I had to dump some of the liquid out. This is a really fun and somewhat easy recipe. You can feed up to 5-6 people with this recipe.

Served it on the day after Thanksgiving. It was a great contrast to the turkey  feast of the day before. All my family loved it. I made it as published. I will be making it again; won't change anything.

I added queso over the taco meat! Everyone really liked it! I didn‚Äôt add the olives either and waited to add the sour cream until the last 15 minutes. Excellent will be making again and thinking of trying it with chicken...

I made this exactly as written. It was very easy to make. Unfortunately,  I, as well as my husband, thought it was just ok. I thought the amount of sour cream just over whelmed the overall taste of the dish. Too many other recipes out there to try instead of wasting time on making changes to this recipe in an attempt to fix it.

This was very easy to do and tasted great. We used chicken instead of ground beef. We added cumin, garlic, onions, and taco seasoning to the chicken as it cooked. Once chicken was cooked we layered . It was delicious.

This was amazing. My husband loved and asked if I could make it again, I did add 1/2 pound lean beef and only 1 1/2 c of tortilla chips. Going to bring this to the next potluck we go to.

This was really easy and delicious. I didn't have any of the spices on hand, so I used a taco seasoning packet for the meat and added corn along with the olives, onion, etc. Very very good. My grandma and grandpa asked for the recipe. I will be making this again!

I absolute loved this recipe. It reminded me of of the enchiladas I make but with half the work. Like others I only used about a cup and 1/2 of the tortilla chips. I also used 1 pound ground turkey seasoned with a 1.25 oz pack of taco seasoning. I added half a yellow onion midway through. I skipped the black olives and used 1 15.5 oz can of black beans (drained and rinsed). I only used 1 1/2 cups of sour cream. I baked it uncovered for about 35 mins and it came out perfect. Also the leftovers are just as good!

It was very satisfying, but seemed like it missed something.  I wonder if the chile beans and salsa I used mixed together made it a little less of a taste than I was expecting.  But it is still a great dish.

Awesome dish, kids loved it. I just added some onions & garlic cumin, paprika and rosemary to the mince, simmered for 15 minutes then added 2x cinnamon sticks and a few cloves to make the mince more authentic. Great fun to make

The meat filing was good with added chili seasoning but I agree other reviewers about the chips being too soggy. Also wasn‚Äôt a fan of hot sour cream. If I make this again, I‚Äôll just serve chips and sour cream on the side (like regular tacos).

Love this easy casserole.  I used chili beans with garlic and peppers, plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I will be making this again, and again!

This recipe is sooo good! Novice cooker mistake, I didn‚Äôt put the salsa in with the meat when I was cooking it so I just added it on top of everything in the pan and it turned out amazing! I could‚Äôve lived without the black olives but my husband loves it. For my own personal likings, I added in banana peppers and it was delicious! Definitely going to be making for any family get together because it was so quick and simple.

Really blah. Even added taco seasoning to the meat. Cooked sour cream was a bit weird. It looked beautiful in the pan though, just was sort of dissapointing.

I used chorizo. So it was a bit soupy. Was great as a dip.

This recipe is amazing. I made it for dinner and my family loved it. My husband says it's top five one of his favorites now. Truth be told, I feel like it's more of a "dip" than a meal. My family ate it with tortilla chips, even though there are tortilla chips in it. I took out the black olives, and added extra sour cream, extra tomatoes, and lots of cheese. The cheese kind of melts into the sour cream, so good. =)

My family really liked this recipe!  Followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers; added taco seasoning to the meat and added some regular onion while browning it. I also used a Mexican cheese blend and Taco flavored Doritos for the crust.

Like many have suggested, I used less crushed chips ( 1 & 1/2 cups), less sour cream (just a bit more than 1 cup) and left out the olives. I had a small can of green chilies, so I added those, as well as 1 chopped green pepper. Really easy dish to put together in a rush.

I realized mid-recipe that  I was out of sour cream. I made it without the sour cream and it was amazing...so I can't wait to make it again with the sour cream.  We thought it tasted like the Mexican pizzas from Taco Bell.

I love all of these ingredients together- but I prefer my chips crunchy. To save time and keep the crunch simply cook meat mixture completely on stovetop and plate with olives, green onions, etc and broken chips on top. Cilantro and guacamole are nice additions as well!

I followed the recipe as listed and it turned out great! I used garlic  seasoning on the ground beef and canned tomatoes instead of fresh. My husband doesn't like olives, so I left them off half of the casserole. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is awesome. I had no olives so I put half a small jar of pimientos in the dish. Delicious delicate flavor was added. Did I say this recipe is awesome. Makes you eat too much :)
I also need to add that I had no sour cream. So, guess what.  I used plain 2% fat yogurt.  Still came out awesome. My third time doing this dish. Shared with a crowd before also.

My kids loved this. I made a bigger batch and made one large pan and one smaller pan.  I froze the chip, meat, sour cream, and green onion layer. I‚Äôll just have to add the olives, tomatoes, and cheese next time.

I added beef bullion, chili powder, garlic and onion powder for extra taste - turned out good.  Next time plan on trying with meat/liquid on bottom to see if it keeps chips more crispy.

It was very tasty (although I added some spices to the meat mixture, namely chipotle powder, chili powder, cumin and garlic powder) but I feel like it could use a little more substance. I will try adding a rice layer next time maybe...

I used taco seasoning and a 24oz tub of sour cream, was a bit too much I felt. Also, I baked it for more like an hour.  Maybe due to our oven sucking, tho. My two pickiest eaters loved it so there u go.  Now that I‚Äôve earned the families trust, next time I‚Äôll experiment! (Evil Dad laughter)

I've made this and we love it! However we increased the green onion to approx 3/4 of a cup. And the diced tomatoes to approx 2 1/2 cups, also increased grated cheese to approx 3 cups.

WONDERFUL! EASY! TASTY! I didn't change a thing initially to give the recipe a chance as it..... it's great!  Anyone can "fix it up" with personal preferences but I found the ingredients blended nicely and leftovers warmed in the oven were great because flavors melded that second day.  Oh and spraying that glass baking dish is enough to just crispen up those crushed chips..... yum!!!  is going to go into my regular make after getting home from work need something fast and easy and good to fix dinners! :)

I added taco seasoning to the ground beef, reduced the salsa to only one cup, and sprinkled the top with fresh cilantro.  My family loved it!

We will make it again. I know my husband likes it when he calls the recipe a "keeper". I did use black beans instead of chili beans for a more authentic recipe. I also used the lime flavored tortilla chips.

Quick, easy and delicious. My family likes a little zip so I added some diced Serrano peppers. That's it. Everyone liked it and asked me to make it again!
Thanks for sharing.

I added a bit of cumin to my meat, beans, and salsa mixture. And used the Mexican style sour cream with cilantro lime flavor. I was very pleased with the result, as were the kids!!

Very good although chips were a bit hard.  If there was more liquid in meat mixture it would soften them up.  Also used 1/2 can Rotel diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes and seasoned meat with taco seasoning.

Since I was making it for a large group, I doubled the recipe, and I used a lb of beef and a lb of regular sausage, and I nixed the olives. I also substituted the Chile beans with black beans(drained)  It was a hit even with the kids!

After dishing this up I added chopped fresh tomato, lettuce and salsa on top.  The crushed tortilla chips got a little soggy as I ate it as leftovers.  I probably will put much less crushed tortilla chips on the bottom next time and just crush some for each serving as I eat it.

One of my favorite quick Mexican recipes.  I used ground turkey and non-fat Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. Reduced fat cheese helped reduce the calorie value and still maintain the taste. The quality of the salsa is key; use one that you really like. Mine was from our local Farmers Market and a favorite of mine. 'll definitely make this again.

I made a few changes, black beans instead of chili, less sour cream (1 cup), added corn, and put the chips on the top underneath the cheese!  Very good reviews from the family. I will make it again!

Delicioso! I could not find chili beans so used canned chili with beans. I used Turkey meat instead of ground and seasoned with Adobo, salt and chili powder. I also only used about 2 cups of tortillas. I also only put black olives on half of pan as the hubby doesn‚Äôt like. Really enjoyed. Will definitely make again! Also great as a Super Bowl food.

It was easy to make.
I would withhold some of cheese.
I served with cilantro, corn tortilla, and green Chile.

I don‚Äôt like black olives, so I substituted half a chopped green pepper, doubling the recipe otherwise.  I seasoned two pounds of ground beef with two packets of Saz√≥n while browning. I also used one can of small red beans and one can small beans, which was enjoyable. 

The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about this is the baking with the sour cream layer, so next time I will omit it from that part but have it as topping instead. I prefer sour cream to be creamy, so it flaked strange to my palette, although my mom liked it how it was baked. So, it‚Äôs just a preference I have. 

It was pretty easy to make, and a great way to use up tortilla chips. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt stick straight with the recipe.  Anyway, I do appreciate this recipe, and will make it again with the changes I have stated, and possibly a little less cheese next time. (I probably went heavy on it, as I did not measure that part.)

Very good. Not a big fan of sour cream cooking ,so like others served it on the side and also added taco seasoning to the ground chuck. I cut the recipe in half for just two and had plenty of leftovers. Loved the idea of the chili beans, they added additional flavor than your traditional refried beans.
I cooked mine an additional 15 minutes so it was super hot.
Thank you for Sharing.

My family liked it.  I turned up a bit and added taco seasoning and a small can of mild otega diced green chilis  to 2.5 lbs of  ground beef.  Afterwards I added black beans instead of kidney.  This dish turned out great!  Definitely 5 stars.

So good! I didnt read any reviews beforehand but I did end up adding taco seasoning to the meat for some added flavor. I did half with veggies and half without (knew my daughter wouldn't eat them). She liked it. I loved it! Already separated servings for lunch the next couple days. Was looking for something different and this was so tasty.

A great dish to make with ingredients that are almost always on hand. I did add taco seasoning to the meat mixture but otherwise followed the recipe as written . Next time I will probably do what some suggested and place corn tortillas at the bottom of the dish, to make it more "pie" like. But great recipe as written.

Add homemade taco seasoning when browning beef. Used 3/4 can black beans (RINSED and drained) instead of chili beans. No tortilla chips, use corn tortillas or nothing at all. If using corn tortillas, put just a little meat sauce at bottom of baking dish before layering as instructed.

I made this for a friend and her family.  I made no changes to the recipe.  It was super easy and extremely pretty.  They were very impressed.  Looks a lot more complicated than it is.    I will take their word for the great flavor.  I will definitely make again and this time I will get to eat it myself!

I used ground turkey and ended up using salsa verde, as i was out of regular salsa.   I did add a small can of diced tomatoes with chilies as i wanted the tomato flavor that regular salsa would have given me.  I will definitely make again.

Very good recipe,  even better with your own twist.  I  used homemade Taco seasoning added to beef with onions.  I love black beans so I used those,  along with some frozen corn.  I did not put chips in casserole because I do not like them mushy.  Instead I crumbled them in after plating. I also did not cook sour cream,  added it at plating also.  My family absolutely loved it and ask for me to make more often.  Thank you for giving me the inspiration!

This was AWFUL!  The crushed tortilla chips were heavy and made the casserole dry and unedible.  I will make it again after I modify it to add green chilis, use the beans without draining and skip the simmer step designed to reduce the liquid for additional liquid.  Then I can eat it with anticipation and without disappointment!!

Declared good by the family!  Bonus!  I gave it 4 stars only because I made some significant adaptations.  I was short on tortilla chips so I shredded some tater tots and mixed it with the tortilla chips for the crust.  Found that kept the crust from crumbling as well.  Kept a handful of the crust mixture and sprinkled on top.  Also used yogurt with southwest seasoning and chili powder instead of sour cream. Will definitely make this again!

This was a terrific base recipe and so easy to change up to fit your family's taste. Along with the onion, I also added two bell peppers (red and green). All of these were cooked in the skillet with the beef, seasoned with taco seasoning, chili powder, garlic powder, and cumin. Once cooked, I added two cans of hot chili beans (drained), one can of Del Monte Hatch tomatoes diced with green chilies (drained), and 1 cup of salsa. This simmered for about 30 minutes. Then, I layered the casserole dish: meat mixture, chips, low fat sour cream, cheese, then repeat. Toppings: cheese, jalapenos, green onions, and olives. Then, baked as written and when done topped each portion with cilantro and sliced avocado. Husband and son loved it! Thank you for a great recipe!

i browned the ground beef and added half of an onion and half of a green bell pepper. When the vegetables became tender, I added a can of green chiles and a packet of taco seasoning. I did use a can of rinsed chopped tomatoes. I also did not get the tortilla chips that I had ordered, but I made this anyways. It tasted great, but the chips were definitely missed. 
UPDATE: I remade this delicious recipe. This time I cooked as directed for 20 minutes. Then I crushed crushed tortilla chips and sprinkled over casserole topped with more cheese and baked for a few more minutes. Perfect!!! Crispy chips did the trick.

Perfect! I saved myself work and a plastic bag by just arranging the tortilla chips on the bottom of the baking dish and then just pressing them down a bit- worked great! I never use cooking spray -- Too many chemicals and unhealthy~~ I used some olive oil to prepare the casserole. Added chopped green pepper because I didn't have any green onions on hand for color. Added some fire (about 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper because we like it spicy), then topped it off with pepper jack cheese. You saved me tonight with this recipe! Awesome! Thanks so much for sharing!

WOW. This dish was... amazing! Ok, so when making dinners, I typically double sometime even triple recipes because I know how my family eats. And it's ALOT. This time around, I stuck to the regular measurements which ended up being perfect for my family of four. I kept almost all ingredients the same and only added a few things/subbed a few things. 

*Added one can of black beans in place of the chili beans
*Did not crush the tortilla chips. I kept them whole
*Used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh (just what I had on hand)
*Used lean ground turkey rather than ground beef
*I followed what others suggested and cooked the turkey in 1 packet of taco seasoning as well as with half an onion 

I layered the bottom of my 9x13 dish with a thin layer of whole tortilla chips, added some meat mixture on top. Put cheese on top of that. Added another layer of whole tortilla chips. Added the rest of my meat mixture. Added more cheese. Topped with the can of tomatoes, black olives, and chives. Lastly, added a little bit more cheese! So basically layered sort of like a lasagna and boy did that go well! NO LEFT OVERS. The chips on the bottom were "soggy" but that didn't bother us. The layer of chips towards the top were perfectly crunchy. I will DEFINITELY be making this again for my family! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is a regular one at our house. My family loves it, it is pretty easy to make and you have leftovers for the week. I  leave out the olives and spread some cilantro over it instead. I also sometimes substitute the salsa with pico de gallo. Great recipe!!!

This was wonderful! I changed it a tad bit but not a lot. I added diced onions to the meat while browning, I added taco seasoning after browning the meat, one can of drained pinto beans and I added a tiny bit more salsa than was stated. I also added a little salsa in the bottom of the baking dish, used a little less chips and then I layered it like lasagna. Very tasty! My family ate almost the entire pan. there is only one serving left!

This was very good but I seasoned the ground beef with taco seasoning.  For my seasoning, I used a recipe entitled Taco Seasoning 1 from the All Recipes web site.  I am very surprised this recipe only calls for browning the ground beef without seasoning it.

I was really looking forward to making this because it sounded so good, however, the texture of the entire dish turned my stomach and made this inedible for me.  I‚Äôm writing this review for others who may have food texture issues.  The chips on the bottom created a mushy paste and the sour cream congealed underneath the cheese and became chunky when it was dished out.  My husband said it was ok and ate it, but I just couldn‚Äôt stomach it.  I thought it would be similar to a nacho casserole, but I was very wrong.  It was so repulsive that I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to eat more than a few bites.  I‚Äôm actually shocked by all of the positive reviews. I‚Äôve NEVER been steered wrong by the reviews on this site until now, and I‚Äôve used this site for at least 5 years.  Like i said, this could be just a personal issue for me, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone and wanted to warn others, just in case. Very disappointing.

Fantabulous!!!  Recipe was easy to understand, simple to make and delicious!!  I tweeked the recipe, but then I always do--added mild green chilies and extra ground beef and sprinkled some cheese on the chips before I added anything else on top--a hold over from when I worked at a pizza place back in college. It helps the layers stay together.

Really good recipe. Not as thick as I hoped being that it‚Äôs called a casserole. I substituted fresh tomatoes for diced can tomatoes & I added taco seasoning to the ground beef for seasoning. Would recommend

This was okay made as written but I agree with other reviews it needs spicing up.  Next time I would also leave out the sour cream and add it at the table, it turned a strange consistency.

Good meal for a small family getting tired of "taco night."  I will slightly decrease the sour cream next time around, though - maybe by half.  The only reason is I love a dollop of cold sour cream on top when I'm done, and when I followed the recipe, it got a little too "sour-creamy". (That's a word. Don't bother looking it up.)
All of us enjoyed it. We had a half a pan left over. Small families with small eaters may want to cut the recipe in half.  It did make for great leftovers the next day, though.

We really liked it. I had some left over brown beans so threw  those in to the beef, onion, and taco seasoning. Threw in some stewed tomatoes, green chili's, and corn. I love this recipe because you can tweak it anyway you want. I will use some black olives next time. I also used taco sauce but will use salsa next time as well. Good quick, basic recipe.

Since I was making this ahead I was concerned that the tortilla chips would get soggy. Left them out and layered the remaining ingredients. I took other's advice and cooked the hamburger with taco seasoning. Other changes were used fat free sour cream, black beans and Mexican blend shredded cheese. After rewarming the servings, I crunched up tortilla chips on top although you could easily serve this as a nacho dip. Family really liked it. I thought it was good but a little salty. Not sure how to fix that since I already used lower sodium taco mix, maybe less of it? Will definitely make it again. Corn chips make it a great GF main dish.

My husband went nuts over this casserole!  He loves mexican food, so it really was a no-brainer.  I loved the simplicity - easy to make.  Next time I will use the white mexican cheese and will mix some in with the meat mixture before spreading it over the crushed tortilla chips.  I will probably use more ground beef as well.

My husband loved this! I guessed with the amount of tomato and onion otherwise every else the same. I did find there was no need to "reduce" the salsa sauce. Maybe I used a kind that was super chunky. All in all great recipe. Will definitely make again!

Not bad. Not great, either. Needs a bit more spice. I would say use a hotter salsa or add some peppers. But it certainly was easy. Will I make it again? Haven't decided yet. Since the tortilla chips become rather soggy, I would suggest serving with some crisp tortilla chips and maybe a bit more salsa on the side.

Make it better, add a small can of refried beans to the meat mixture and mix the sour cream in rather than doing it as a separate layer.

The basics of this recipe are great!  I would agree with others who felt that 3 cups of chips were too many.  I will decrease to 2 cups next time.  I used about 1 1/2 lbs of taco meat that I had leftover, 2 cups of my homemade salsa and a can of low sodium black beans.  A little less sour cream (that was all I had).  Living in Wisconsin, I used a mixture of Swiss, mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheeses (probably a little more than the recipe called for.  I do not like black olives and did not have green onions, so I used extra chopped tomatoes, green pepper and some jalape√±os.  I sprinkled taco seasoning on the cheese before baking.  My husband loved it, so hey, that was a positive in my book ??.  This recipe gives you license to use your imagination.  Use it!  Next time I would use green onions and would definitely add fresh chopped cilantro.  Yum!!!

I made this recipe per the directions, and it was good. I doubled the recipe and put the second one in the freezer for another night. The crushed tortillas in the bottom help to soak up any excess liquid. After our first few bites, my husband and I got the bag back out and crushed some tortillas on top. Next time, we will add sliced jalapenos.

It was good. I'd add taco seasoning, a small can of drained corn and either chopped jalape√±o or small can of green chilies. Any additions would make this dish amazing for a potluck or gathering. Quick and easy.

So easy and tasted so good.  Read the reviews and made the changes of turkey meat, added taco seasoning, added a whole can of rotel and only 1 cup of water.  Didn't have chips but did have tortilla strips for salads so used those instead.  For our own tastes left the sour cream and halved cherry tomatoes for toppings after I cooked it.  My family loved it!!!!  Thanks so much for sharing this versatile recipe!

I love this recipe! I've made this a couple times now but after the first time I haven't once followed the directions exactly - it's one of those recipes that's very adaptable to whatever you have in your kitchen. Last night, for example. I used chicken instead of ground beef and added taco seasoning to the meat. The only beans I had on had were baked beans so I rinsed them thoroughly and added them to the meat on the stove at the same time as the salsa (along with some onions and red peppers) instead of after. 

I used corn tortillas on the bottom and ended up doing a second layer which had blue corn crushed hard taco shells instead. And I used the Mexican blend cheese instead of cheddar. 

The chicken went great and I think it was my favorite version to far! I just love how easy it is to substitute in this recipe

Chips turned to a chewy but not soggy really dry disaster at the bottom. My family couldn't eat it. Wouldn't make this again. Awful recipe.

Great flavor.  I also seasoned the meat with cumin, pepper, garlic before adding other ingredients.  The chips on bottom got too soft so I would prpbably leave them out next time and just crumble chips on top before eating or use chips to dip it.  Would be great for a party dish.

This was a great way to use leftover taco chips and several other items handy in my fridge that the recipe called for.  I would probably add a little jalape√±o pepper to spice it up the next time I make it.

I mixed the chips into the mix, not sure I did the recipe as is, I think I more read it then did my own thing.  But the flavor was Amazing and has to be the easiest dinner I have made in months, I don't think you can mess this one up :)

Made this for a hungry group of twenty somethings tonight and they all LOVED it!  Will definitely make again - this would be good for a pot luck , too.  I did add a little cayenne pepper to the ground beef when I was cooking and the "kids" added more salsa on top before diving in.

This is delicious and very easy! We LOVE it!  I didn't have any chili beans on hand so I used Ranch Style beans and ground turkey, reduced the sour cream to 1 1/2 cups, about 3/4 cup chopped tomato and green onion. I also used more crushed tortilla chips than what the recipe calls for (maybe 4-5 cups).  It turned out SO GOOD. This is a GREAT recipe that I will make over and over again!

This is comfort food for sure! I used ground turkey, fat-free sour cream (which I whisked with a packet of lower-sodium taco seasoning before layering), and reduced-fat cheddar. Also added about 1 c. diced bell pepper to the meat/salsa mixture while simmering. It's still very rich tasting and delicious!

It was tasty but to dry and chips were tough. Don't cook down salsa ,  and add cheese last 15 mins. Or it's to dry on top.

First time I made it, I refrigerated it for a few hours and then cooked it. This made the chips too soggy, second time I layered it and cooked it right away.  Chips were crisper and better!.

I personally would just give this a 4-star rating, but it is the first time several people from my camping club asked me for a recipe so I'm giving this 5 stars.  Only changes I made to the recipe were to increase the tortilla chips to closer to 4 cups, added a couple of teaspoons of chili powder to the meat mixture when adding the chili beans, and doubled the olives.

I use corn tortillas that I rip apart to line the bottom. A bit healthier since not a fried chip and makes a moist casserole. My kids love it. I use ground turkey and black beans instead of beef and chili beans. I also almost double those protein sources and at their request omit the olives.

This was delicious & easy to make. I left out the olives because I don't like them & my hubby didn't miss them. I made this ahead of time when we had a busy night & kept it warm in an insulated casserole carrier.

I didn't use sour cream, black olives, or tomatoes.  I put pickled jalape√±o slices on top of the cheese.  After removing from the oven served it with Pico de Gallo on top.  Ended up a very spicy dish...just like we like it.  Will definitely make it again.

This is really good.  The sour cream curded up when cooked so last time I didn't put it on the casserole and served on the side and was great that way.  Made cornbread with it.

This recipe was pretty easy to prepare although, who would have thought it was so hard to crumble tortilla chips without getting them everywhere?!? I was surprised with how well the tomatoes worked in the leftovers, but the chips served better as a crust the first time. Overall, very easy and very tasty - will make it again.

Very good. Followed the recipe with the exception of seasoning the meat after it was cooked with cumin, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder.

I read the review's and took their suggestions into consideration.  I added cut up red peppers.  Instead of fresh tomatoes I did use canned but used a slotted spoon to scoop out just the chunks.  I kept the amount of chunks to the recipe.   My family loved it!  I would definitely make it again.  I think the 2 1/2 cups of salsa keeps the casserole moist but not runny.

The first time I sauteed onions and peppers in some of the fat left from the meat, and then used a green avocado salsa and some green enchilada sauce. It was absolutely amazing. I made it again according to the recipe which was still good, but lacked the same wow factor. I agree with other reviews that you don't want too many chips in the bottom, just enough to cover the bottom, but not a thick layer. Otherwise it really is dry. That said, it's a fantastic base to play with according to your palate.

It was really good! I actually eyeballed everything to my preference (chips, sour cream, cheese) and it turned out tasty. Kids weren't a fan of it because the way it looks, but hopefully they will eat it as they get older!

Family absolutely loved this dish and it was soooo easy to make!  This is definitely a keeper!
Lots of flavor, inexpensive and really simple.  You could easily add some Spanish rice on the side, or maybe a veggie instead.

This is so good and easy to make!!! Like some reviewers had posted I used corn tortillas instead of chips,  black beans instead of chili beans and used taco seasoning.  I added jalapeno, garlic and onion into the meat mixture and cooked all together with the drained black beans.  When I put the meat mixture on top of the tortillas I used a pierced spoon so the liquid would drain off first.  My kids loved this they went back for seconds and they are teenagers!!  They also wanted it as leftovers for dinner the next night.

I did make some changes: used cream cheese thinned out a bit with heavy cream (didn't have sour cream). Added a bunch more seasoning (coriander, garlic, cumin, black pepper, chili powder). Mixed a tin of drained diced tomato in with the beef and the (adzuki) beans. Gave it a squeeze from 1/4 fresh lime. Layered the salsa and chopped green onion. Sprinkled some jalepenos. Left out the olives - no fans of those in the house. Did two layers of everything except the cheese. Used shredded Mexican blend cheese. Baked at 400 for about 25 minutes. The family loved it! Will be making this again - a quick, easy, tasty meal.

I loved this and so did my husband. It was very delicious and filling. I only make a few additions. I added fresh tomatoes and green peppers. I served with sour cream, shredded lettuce, and fresh tomatoes. The dish reheated well and was much loved.

I substituted Spanish rice (rice cooked with Rotelle tomatoes) after I tried it with the crushed chips on the bottom.
It freezes beautifully. I just leave off the sour cream and cheese layers until it's time to bake.

Used 2lbs of meat and added a can of Rotel, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt to the meat mixture (along with the salsa). Since I added the Rotel I omitted the extra tomatoes. Oh man, it was so good! Everyone got seconds!

Outstanding! 

Added a dash of cumin, cayenne and 3 gloves of garlic to the meat.  Used black beans instead and corn along with Monterrey jack cheese mixed in with the cheddar cheese.  I bought the mild Ortega salsa.  Put in more green onions and tomatoes and back off on the crushed chips.

Everyone liked it, even the ones who say they don¬¥t like beans.  Added a small can of corn. Left out the olives and served them on the side so people could choose if they wanted them or not. Used broken taco shells rather than chips to cut down on salt. I also used quite a bit less than 2 cups of sour cream, probably just a little over a cup, but served with sour cream on the side.

This was delicious & super easy! My kids loved it & one of them is a very picky eater. Will definitely make this recipe again. The only thing different I substituted was refried pinto beans with green chili's instead of chili beans.

This turned out great! left out the olives due to taste. I followed others suggestion to add taco seasoning to the beef. I also used Doritos as the crust which turned out great! will definitely make again :)

I'll definitely make this again, but instead of putting the sour cream in it as a layer, I will serve it with a dollop of sour cream on the top of each serving.

My family loves this. It is almost like a Mexican lasagna. I use about a cup more cheese on top than recommended it makes it extra cheesy gooey .

Great dish. I'm not a huge fan of green onion however I did add 1 green pepper chop down the baby pieces. And turned out to be a fantastic dish.

Love this recipe! I chose to use a lot less sour cream to avoid the fat (I'm sure it's even yummier with though??) and I would put more tomatoes on top (personal preference) - other than that it's perfect!

It wasn't spicy enough for me so I would add more spice like adding jalapenos, green chiles, or red pepper flakes. Overall it was pretty good.

This came out very good, though I did make some changes on it. We doubled the meat and added taco seasoning. Instead of chili beans, I used black beans. I also added chopped onion and a can of corn to the skillet after the meat was cooked. And instead of adding salsa, I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with mild green chilies. I also did not add the sour cream to the dish before cooking it. I was worried how cooked sour cream would taste, so everyone just added it to their dish after serving along with salsa. Will definitely be making this again!

Very tasty. I didn't use olives, icky. I cooked the beef with diced onion. I used about 2 cups of chips & it was fine. I topped it with guacamole after it baked. I didn't change anything else. Awesome stuff.

I added 1 diced onion to the ground beef and sauteed them together. To the beef and bean mixture, I also added 1 cup of frozen fire roasted corn. Then I made a mixtake and also added the olives, tomatoes and sour cream, mixing it all together before spreading the mix over the chips. Topped the casserole dish just with the grated cheddar cheese. I was worried when I realized my mistake, but it turned out fine and it is definitely easier, so that's how I continue to make this casserole. Adults like it as much as the kids.

Yum!  I made this as is, except I didn't have quite 3 cups of chips -- I would say probably half that amount; and used black beans.  Like ALL reviews, I thought it bland (but good).  However, 5 men added a little hot sauce and LOVED it.  They want it again!  We ran out FAST!

This ok but not something I would make again. It lacked flavour and the meat mixture was a little dry. Maybe with some tweaking I would like it better.

I would have preferred this without the tortilla chips mushy on the bottom.  I also wasn't crazy about the consistency of the cooked sour cream.

While the flavor of this was good, it was just way too dry!  The layer of crushed chips at the bottom contributed to this, but also, the sour cream dried out as it baked.  If I were to make this again, I think I'd substitute rice or a cornbread-type base, and leave the liquids in the chili beans and tomatoes (I used Rotel, as there are no good fresh tomatoes here this of year).  I might also add some milk to the sour cream.  At least I got to use up some ingredients I had on hand!

Pretty good but found out I'm not wild about baked sour cream. Added about 1/2 tsp ground cumin to meat mixture cuz I love that spice and topped the finished product with chopped fresh cilantro. Next time might use a large can of refried beans in place of sour cream and instead top with a dollop of sour cream and fresh cilantro.

My son wasn't a fan, but the rest of us thought this was really good.  It's actually even better left over.  I used hot salsa and Rotel tomatoes (in addition to fresh).  That combination was probably a little bit hotter than necessary for some people, but not unbearable.  I also used homemade taco seasoning while browning the meat (I always use turkey).  I didn't have any olives, but it would be good either way.  I also used black beans and the bite size tortilla chips and did not crush them.  They weren't really crunchy, but weren't soggy, either.  Very easy and very tasty.  I will definitely make it again.

Make this all the time and have ever since I found the recipe! This is good for the whole family. I make it Spicer when there are no kids eating it by using hot rotel instead of tomatoes by themselves.

Made this to the instructions and it was yummy.  My husband likes spicy food and even though he added jalape√±os  to his portion he said the recipe was a definite keeper.  This dish could be spiced up any number of ways including using Fiesta scoops or any spicy corn type chip.  But even just as it is it's delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

Super easy and better than I thought it would be. I omitted the olives (don't like) and made mine in a 9x9x3 pan so that the layers would be thicker. Would have like some spice though, so I think next time I'd add some taco seasoning and maybe some jalapenos.

This is a staple in our house. The only modifications I make is to use lime tortilla chips for the added flavor and pico de gallo instead of plain tomatoes and green onions. It's easy and delicious!

How can people fairly review a recipe when they add or change 3/4 of the ingredients. The rule should be: you can only fairly give a review if you've made the recipe, changing no more than 1 ingredient.  If you change more than that, post your own recipe and let others review yours.

This was delicious the only changes were ground turkey, cool ranch Doritos (a household fav) and add a few green chiles for a more robust flavor. It will be added to the rotation and my new dish to share at potlucks.

Fantastic! I did make a few changes right away: 1) mix beef with taco seasoning 2) re-order layers - beef,veggies,chips and lastly cheese. 3) omitted the olives 4)added a dollop of sour cream on top of each serving, after the casserole was cooked. I served it with green salad and tortilla chips as suggested - yum! Next time I will serve with wedges of warm tortilla.. Enjoy!

This was acceptable, however, there seemed to be something missing...I can't put my finger on it, but it left a little to be desired...I wouldn't make it again...

After reading all the reviews/comments, I tried this, adding Taco seasoning and drained corn. VERY GOOD and easy. Easy to take to work, along with tortilla chips, and yes even better warmed up.

Replaced the chilli beans with chick peas and kidney beans. Also added 1/4 cup of corn kernels and 2 tbsp of taco spice and 1 tsp of chilli. Was wonderful.

I made this recipe with black beans and added some chili powder.  Everyone loved it.  The second time I made it I omitted the chip layer and served chips on the side.  I definitely will use again the second way.

This meal was a hit! I also added taco seasoning while browning the beat and we also added corn. This will be in our rotation! :-)

This recipe was great, easy to understand and follow and simple to put together.  i changed nothing, as i thought the whole thing made sense.  thought about the taco seasoning others mentioned until i realized that the salsa and the chili beans from the can would season the meat nicely.  i added salt, because i'm a salt addict, but that was my only alteration and i dug it immensely and will be making it again soon.  thanks for sharing it.

So easy! I have a stand by taco chili that is similar and the family voted this as it's replacement.  Only adjustment, added less than a half pack of taco seasoning.

I agree with the poster who said the tortilla chips on the bottom were too dry.  Great expectations here but the recipe as written didn't measure-up.  Am using some enchilada sauce on the left-overs.

Delicious and pretty quick to prepare.  I used ground turkey and a corn and black bean salsa.  It tasted like an unwrapped enchilada.  The whole family enjoyed it.

I took the advice of a few reviewers and used corn tortillas instead of crushed chips.  Mine also turned out a bit soupier than I'd like but that's probably my fault.  I think I got impatient while cooking the meat/salsa.  Overall, this is a great recipe.  Even my girlfriend, who hates most of the ingredients, loves it.

So simple and yet so delicious! I did make some slight changes for what I had on hand, black beans instead of chili, no sour cream as it doesn't agree with my husband, 2 cups of chips instead of 3 which was PLENTY, and black olives on the side as I'm not a fan. I am turning into a casserole queen and this will definitely be made again!

Huge hit with some changes. No sour cream or olives cause we hate them. Used 60/40 deer/pork hamburger instead of beef. Then cooked drained diced tomatoes, a locally made salsa that's hot, hamburger, black beans, and a few other spices all together till almost all the liquid was gone. Then topped with chesse. Need to find some alternative between meat and cheese but my picky eaters loved it.

I really enjoyed this recipe it was easy quick affordable and YUMMY and idis t even add taco seasoning as others mentioned however as yummy as it is it's a lil heavy for stomach perhaps it's because I used a lot of sour cream more than what was suggested but it was still good :)

I love this recipe. It was easy to cook up and assemble. I did make my own adjustments: I used ground moose meat as that is our main source of meat. Also, I cut the chips in half (1 1/2 cups), substituted plain yogurt for sour cream, and I added canned black beans and 1/2 cup of cooked brown rice. I added 1 cup fresh tomatoes chopped and 1 cup bell peppers chopped that I saut√© separately and then added into the meat. I had shredded mozzarella cheese, which was just fine. I assembled the casserole similar to lasagna: chips, meat, yogurt, cheese, and repeat, topping with cheese and salsa...yum. 
This casserole was a hit at our house for dinner!

Very good and easy! My boyfriend always jokes because I love making Mexican dishes and there all about the same minus a few tweeks I find in a different recipe. Lol But this was good one and boyfriend loved it as well, wants on the rotation. I did a few things different as I had on hand. Added green peppers before tomatoes, pinto beans because I had no chilli beans, and taco flavored cheese on top. But otherwise  I didn't change much, it was great. Recommend!!!!!

We tried this recipe tonight.  We made a lot of changes to it due to picky eaters but it turned out delicious.  

First of all, we used shredded chicken for the meat -- I used rotisserie and it was perfect.  We also used the Frontera Grill taco seasoning -- roasted tomatoes and red chiles (mild) to season.  We added half of a sweet onion and green pepper (due to some of the other reviews).  We used vegetarian refried beans in the mixture.  Finally, we added the sour cream to the meat mixture because we have a picky eater who would not eat the dish if she SAW sour cream.  We also layered the chips on the bottom and top before we put the cheese on top. We also put the black olives on the side.  It was a total crowd pleaser to a big group of fickle pickles!

I thought this was a good basic recipe. I am a cook that grows fresh herbs and always modify a recipe from this. Cumin, fresh garlic and fresh cilantro was a need, and I also used some spiced up tomatoes as well. Loved it, Oh and used the tostidos with lime. YUMMO!

Made this tonight and doubled the recipe for leftover lunches.  Added taco seasoning mix (thought it strange that there was no seasoning in the recipe).  Also added jalapenos and fresh cilantro at the same time as the green onion.  Did find the chips on the bottom a bit dry so next time would probably keep some of the liquid in the meat and salsa next time.  Would make again but will change it up again and maybe try a layer of refried beans instead of the chilli beans.

This was a great recipe.  I made it as is the first time, it was very good.  Next time around, I made a few changes.  First I used cut up tortillas (1/2 flour, 1/2 corn) in place of chips. I did put crushed chips on the top of the cheese on top. I substituted Lebneh instead of sour cream ( lebneh is yogurt cheese and can be found in middle eastern markets).  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also did two layers instead of one.  Fantastic.  A good staple casserole for everyday or company!!

This was so quick & delicious!! I used a bit more ground beef and as suggested, added the taco seasoning.  I also added about 3 packets of Sazon de Goya, used black beans instead of the chili beans, added corn, and green chiles.  Instead of plain chopped tomatoes I used pico de gallo.  I just LOVE this recipe!!! Yum!!

The tortilla chips get to soggy on the bottom, I use cut up flour tortilla 's instead as they hold their shape better.

Excellent!  Based on some of the reviews my additions were: 1) added a pkg of taco seasoning, 1/2 of a chopped med. onion, 3/4 tsp of chipolte chilli pepper seasoning I bought for another recipe that didn't work out, and 1 tsp minced garlic to the ground beef when browning, 2) used black beans, 3) substituted petite canned tomatoes for fresh which worked out really well, 4) used only about a cup and a half of the thicker yellow tortilla chips.  Really good and will definitely make again.  Thank you!

I make a lot of Mexican dishes and many casserole types so I was expecting the usual dish but was really surprised.  I followed the recipe exactly except used turkey for ground beef (all I had) and I did sprinkle some taco seasoning on the turkey.  Everything was delicious and came out very nice - not a big glob of food as frequently happens with casseroles.  I like spicy, my husband likes medium, and my kids like mild.  We all like this dish as is.  I may try with black beans but I think the chili beans gave it a nice kick.  I saw other reviewers used Ro-Tel or canned tomatoes instead of fresh and that would be good too I think.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe and you can easily adjust spiciness.

This is delicious ! I'm just at 4 stars because I had a little curdling with the sour cream that didn't look appetizing but the flavor was delicious. Followed the advice of others and added some spices to the meat, used a medium hot salsa, which was a good move. Also didn't crush the chips but laid them across the bottom of the dish instead. I drained a can do diced tomatoes and used those, that may have been my curdling problem source. I will

This recipe is a keeper!  I have 6 people to feed so I doubled most of the ingredients and just used a very large jar of salsa.  Crumbled a whole bag of corn tortillas and spread everything into 2 baking dishes.  Served some chips from a second bag on the side.  Everyone mentioned seasoning their meat - of course that's a given with anything- you want to season it to give it flavor.  In this instance, I sprinkled some taco seasoning and pepper onto meat while cooking and when adding the salsa and beans.   Even the picky kids loved it!

This is an excellent recipe and very good left over, although the chips get a little soggy from being reheated. I brown the meat with some onion added in and also add a package of taco seasoning for extra flavor. I also use salsa con queso (we love cheese here), as I am not a huge fan of regular salsa.

Decent recipe. All the people who tried it liked it, but I think it could use more flavor and spice. I made it exactly to the recipe. I think next time I will add some garlic, and chili sauce. I don't really care for spicy food but this was just a bit too bland for Tex-Mex.

This was delicious and easy to make. I didn't include the tortilla chips because we're watching our carbs and it was still delicious. I also used Mexican blend cheese rather than cheddar because this is a Mexican dish. Figured 30 minutes was too long to cook, but it was perfect after 27 minutes using convection, so 30 minutes should work about right in a conventional oven.

This is a favorite in our house. However I've made a change. Instead of adding chips to the bottom I put them in a bowl on the table and we eat this like a seven layer dish. I add the tomatoes after it come out of the over (if I have some on hand) Its great, plus we add extra sour cream and hot sauce.

Very easy and quick to make!  The flavor is great and it can be used as a meal or an appetizer.  The sour cream looks a little funny after being cooked but other than that I really love this recipe.  Thanks!

This was good but not real flavorful. I added garlic, cumin, chili powder, and cayenne to the ground beef, and added some chopped fresh cilantro along with the olives, onion, and tomatoes. After reading a few reviews, I will make this again and use black beans in place of chili beans, and add taco seasoning and a little chorizo. I also plan to cut the salsa in half and sub enchilada sauce for the other half. The tomato taste of the salsa was a little strong. Looking forward to trying it with these few changes.

I doubled the ingredients and used black beans rather than red kidney beans and I added 1/2 cup of dry Spanish rice as a thickener. It was fabulous, just a beautiful casserole and very yummy. I'll be making this dish again on Christmas Eve. One of my most favorite recipes ever!

I would prefer taco seasoning over just salsa in the meat and the sour cream turns dry and unpleasant looking.  Not bad tasting but not a favorite.

Made this recipe tonight, with a few changes. I used a little over 1 & 1/2 lbs of meat. Once I browned & drained the meat, I added 1 small onion (minced) and 4 cloves of minced garlic. I then added a packet of taco seasoning, 2/3 cup of water, a jar of salsa and a can of refried beans and let it all simmer for 30 minutes. For the cheese layer, I used a mexican blend. It came out great and my family loved it!

I thought this dish had a great flavor overall. I followed many of the suggestions and made some modifications: I used a jar of habanero salsa, i seasoned the ground sirloin with cumin, coriander, pepper, garlic salt, and a bit of chipotle powder. I didn't add the fresh chopped tomato, though I would do so in the future. The flavors worked very well together, but those darned chips--they turned "tough" and chewy after cooking. That's my only complaint. Everything else about this recipe was great. So, the next time I make this, it will be as a hot, baked dip and I will serve the tortilla chips on the side.

I made this recipe as written but added the taco seasoning and garlic powder as others suggested. I served it at a perty and it disapeared almost immediately.  It was YUMMY and several people asked for the recipe.  Thanks for a GREAT Party Recipe!!

This was wonderful, in fact my husband had seconds and took it to work for lunch. I had some leftover shredded flank steak I had made for soft tacos so I used that instead of ground beef. Yuuuuuummmm. Thank you for a great recipe.

I did what a lot of reviewers recommended and browned the ground beef with onions and taco seasoning with garlic powder.  I used.. maybe 1.5 cups of crushed tortilla chips (just used up whatever I had left in the bag) and layered as directed.  The kids and husband liked it - I was more on the fence.  So I'd say it's like "taco night" but the beauty is that it's in one pan and much less mess!  So, this is a make again for me and I'll put it into the rotation

Great recipe, used some garlic powder and taco powder with ground beef, used canned tomatoes, Mexican mix cheese, needs to sit after you take out of oven to thicken, then added crunched chips on top.  Needs the crunch to make this work.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe wasn't just good, it was great! I used ground turkey because that is what I had on hand. I omitted the sour cream and added taco seasoning and everything else the same. I don't like sour cream but I served it as a side with guacamole. It was a big hit with the family! served the casserole with a salad and could not ask for a better meal.

Good flavor with the taco sauce, I didn't have enough tortilla chips so its not really standing up. When I try again, I will put toasted tortillas on top of meat after I drain it really well then add sour cream and toppings on too of it. But even with a flat casserole it's good!

I made this for the first time last week for a friend and we both loved it.  After reading other reviews I did alter it a bit based on suggestions - I added taco seasoning to the beef and also added chopped green chilies.  I also broke up crisp taco shells instead of chips and that worked great. I definitely will make this again and will do it more healthy - use ground turkey, non-fat sour cream, reduced fat cheese - and I think it will be wonderful.

I made this recipe for my parents and realized it was a big success when my father and I sat at the table for 10 minutes, forks in hand, eating directly out of the casserole dish itself after everyone else had already left the dining room. It's not a healthy meal and far from gourmet but it's a crowd-pleaser and my hungry family was satisfied! And I discovered that with a little tinkering it can inch closer toward gourmet and retain the ease and homey-ness that is comfort food. I simmered a chopped clove of garlic with the ground beef for extra flavor and then started throwing some tasty stuff into the meat mix. I used only 1 cup of salsa but added lemon juice from 1/2 a lemon, 1/2 a green bell pepper, 1/2 a poblano pepper, cayenne (to taste), a handful of chopped Cilantro and Tapatio hot sauce. Try to buy some quality salsa (or make your own!) as the salsa is really the flavor base for the dish. I used a Mexican cheese mix instead of plain ol' cheddar. This was yummy and though I don't see making it often because of the calorie content, it would be great for parties or cooking for a crowd!

This wasn't too bad, but not as flavorful as I would have liked. I don't plan on making it again.

I used 1.5 pounds of ground beef, added 1 packet taco seasoning to the beef mixture, used black beans instead of chili beans

I lightened this recipe up and it cut the calories to less than half!

Instead of using regular tortilla chips, I used baked.  Instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey.  When you add the salsa, you can't even tell it's turkey!  I used salsa with corn and black beans in it, so I didn't add any extra beans.  I also made it in a smaller casserole dish.  I didn't have to add so much sour cream (fat free, of course) or cheese on top.  When I cut that in to 9 hearty servings, it was less than 300 calories a serving!

My husband ate half of his before I even got to the dining room! :)

Lovely, easy and satisfying. Sometimes I run out of ground beef ideas and this one was so obvious, I can't believe I didn't think of it all ready. The boys call it mommas nachos. Very good.

This recipe is delicious.  I used 1 cup light sour cream and just enough crushed chips to cover the bottom of the dish.  I will make this again.

I don‚Äôt care for the salsa as one of the main ingredients or the sour cream cooked in the casserole and the tortilla chips whether on the bottom or the top were soggy. I like the other ones I have better than this one. I won't use it again.

This was delicious! The combined flavour of sour cream and salsa was very tasty.
The store did not have any chili beans, so I used kidney beans and chili powder instead.

The family liked it. I used plain greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. I didn't care for the chips on the bottom as they were hard and dry. I am making it again using corn tortillas so we will see how that will turn out. Otherwise it was very good.

What's not to like about beef, beans & cheese?  I added taco seasoning to the beef after it browned.  Next time I will saut√© the green onions before adding to the casserole.  We didn't like their crunchiness.  Other than that it was yummy!

The flavor is delicious!  But it is a little dry as prepared per the recipe.  Next time I will leave the sour cream off until aftre it comes out if the oven, i will not simmer the meat as long, and I will add more black olives.  Should be perfect then!

YUM! I made it with no modifications, it was great! So easy and I loved left overs. I actually didn't mind the tortilla chip bottom as a left over...kind of like a soft corn tortilla.

I was a little doubtful of this recipe but decided to try it because of all the positive reviews. Tried it and our whole family loves it, even our 6 and 3 year old. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added taco seasoning to the beef and made sure any extra liquid from the salsa was cooked off thoroughly so that the chips would still be crispy. I also sprinkled on cilantro instead of green onions. We're actually having this for dinner tonight. Such a great comfort food!

Extremely yummy recipe! I cooked my ground beef ahead of time (also used taco seasoning and extra cumin and black pepper, for more flavor) so assembly took no time at all and dinner was ready in 30 minutes. I substituted soy milk for milk and used lactose-free cheese and it turned out beautifully. Left out olives and green onions but that's just personal preference. I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

I added taco seasoning, a can of diced green chilis and half a can of mexi-corn. Also used black beans. Although the flavor is delicious, it didn't hold together well when put on the plate. This inspired my wife to eat it scooped onto tortilla chips as if it was a dip. She liked it that way, actually. The next day it held together very well and tasted even better!

I really liked this recipe, next time I will cut everything in half for just two people. I almost think it needs some more spice. I will probably leave the chips out so they don't seem so tough after baking.

It's a work in progress dish. A little bland but livened it up with hot sauce and cilantro and extra salsa. Next time I will a bell peppers and jalapenos and more spices.

Made this for dinner tonight..  As others suggested, I added taco seasoning and corn to the ground beef mixture.  I also didn't have green onions, so I diced yellow onion and added it to both the beef mixture and the top with the tomatoes.  Very Yummy!!  This one is a keeper..=)

Both my husband & 13 yr. old liked this recipe.  I used ground turkey.  Did season it while browning with salt, pepper, oregano & dash of cumin.  Also added green chilis before adding the chili beans.  You can make this dish hot or mild.

I made this for dinner last night. My husband can't eat beef any more because of his health. I too made this delicious dish with ground turkey. It turned out great, and when my daughter returned home from college she was delighted.

Delicious! Used 8oz. of cheese, could've used a little bit more. Also used a whole 16oz. container of sour cream and a whole bag of tortilla chips. Family favorite for sure!

I would rate this as a 4 or 4.5 but it was a huge hit with the family so going all the way with 5 stars! It really tasted good and was so simple to throw together. I also used black beans instead of chilli beans. I like the crushed tortilla chips but next time I'll try adding a layer of rice and/or beans... thanks for sharing this, it's new favorite with the family!

This was AMAZING and easy to make. I made it without the meat and it was great. I didn't use chili beans but used black and pinto beans, added chili powder, goya adobo, and black pepper and a little bit of chicken stock. The great thing is you can add anything and it will come out delicious.

I'm typing this review as mine is in the oven baking.....I DID make changes and modifications, as I find this to be a very basic (but great) base recipe. 

I added Cheesy taco seasoning to the beef mixture, as well as some fresh mild chilies, and then finished simmering with Pace Chunky salsa, a can of refried beans and about half a can of corn..... 

Instead of the chips (not much for soggy chips, and wanted this more of a real casserole or "pie" type meal), I layered 2 large tortilla shells on the bottom of my pan....Put half of the beef mixture on the tortillas spread out....then placed black olives (I used a big can and sliced them, as we LOVE our olives in this house), Rotelle tomatoes, green onions, and mexican blend cheese.  I then topped with the last of the beef mixture, and "closed it up", using 2 more large tortilla wraps on top and pinching it down all around the pan (trimmed a little excess off the sides)....

It's got about another 15 minutes to go, at about 5 mninutes left I'll add the last part of the Rotelle tomatoes andgreen onions, and cover with cheese on top.  

Adding the sour cream after it's out of the oven as I don't like the taste of it baked into things like that.  

Complimenting it with a mexican apple pie....cinnamon covered baked tortilla shells, covered in more cinnamon, apples (sauteed in butter and apple pie spice), a homemade caramel sauce, and topped with shredded cheddar cheese and whipped cream.  Awesome meal!!!

Really Great recipe. It was a hit of a mexican theme party. They only reason I gave it four stars is because I used the Taco seasoning in the meat as was suggested by others and it helped greatly. I also chopped up three fresh small Jalapenos to ad a little kick. Finally I used turkey because most were  bringing a ground beef dish. No one could tell and again this is a great recipe to play with. A keeper

Didn't care much for this casserole. The tortilla chips tasted stale after the casserole was done baking. I probably won't make this again.

Super easy to make and tastes great!  Was just as good two days later as leftovers.  We might try Spanish rice in place of the tortilla chips next time.

My family loved this dish. I made a few changes: left out black olives and tomato and used doritos instead of tortilla chips.

WOW! This was really good and easy to make. I added a bell pepper, onion, chili powder, onion, powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the meat when cooking it. I didn't measure the chips just crushed enough to line the bottom of the pan. I thought I'd really be able to taste the chili, but it worked really well in the recipe. We will definitely have this again.

We thought this was delicious. Omitted the salsa, as I am not a fan. Froze well.  Was even more delicious as leftovers.

It was really hot when I made this so I didn't want to turn on the oven...so I made it on the stove top. Very good. I used a can of refried beans instead of chili beans because I needed to use it up, and didn't use the cheese simply because I didn't have much left. Instead of layering everything we dipped the chips and added sour cream on individual servings according to taste. This was very good :) Great for a hot summer day when you don't want to eat a lot.

Delishous!  Easy to make and inexpensive. I used 2 cans of Hormel chili instead of having to cook the ground beef. I also added zuchinni peices. I agree that 3 cups of chips was too much. I used just enough to cover the bottom of my baking dish.
Thinking of using fat-free cottage cheese next time in place of the sour cream!

Awesome Casserole!  Only thing I added was taco seasoning to the meat for some additional flavor.  My grandma doesn't even like "Mexican" food, but she loved this dish!  YUM!!!!

Delish!  Like others, I added taco seasoning to the meat (I used turkey since I don't eat beef).  I think there are a lot of different veggies a person add to make it unique.  I'd like to try doing a corn bread base in place of the chips.  The only thing I didn't like was the texture of the sour cream after cooking and I think it could have used a little more cheese on top.

This was fairly simple to make and my family did like it. I asked them to rate it and both my husband and 2 daughters said 7/10!! I did not use olives but chopped jalapenos instead. My only complaint is it did not really stay in a nice "casserole" form but kind of a mess. I would recommend using 1 1/2 cups sour cream as well. All in all this recipe wasn't bad, just nothing to "write home about"

Easy, tasty and filling.  Like a seven layer dip.  I might try using tortillas on the bottom next time instead of chips and see how that goes.

I think it was good recipes besides the chips. They became soggy expecially during re-heating. I think next time I'll use torilla instead.

I had a friend over for breakfast yesterday and she ended up staying through lunch.  I had been wanting to try this recipe and I'm so glad I made it when I had someone to share it with. It was soooo good!  I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch :) The only thing I changed was I used chicken instead of ground beef. Delicious!

"Easy Mexican Casserole" is a great name for this recipe.  It couldn't be much easier to put together. It makes a LOT of servings and looks so bright and pretty in the dish and on the plate.  It's also easy to add a side dish that goes with it and a desset to have a complete company or family meal. The degree of spicyness can be adjusted by the type of salsa used. I used medium Great Value (Wal-Mart)brand salsa and thought it was just right.  I also used other GV brands to cut down the cost of the ingredients.  The only problem I had was that the sour cream had a curdled, cottage cheese-like appearance after the casserole baked; however, I see it looks the same way in the pictures of the same recipe that are posted here.  I made this Easy Mexican Casserole for company to have as an alternative to the beef stew that I served at the same meal.  Everyone ate some and agreed that the casserole was delicious.  Both of my early-teenage grandsons told me they loved it.  I've saved the recipe to take to the next potluck dinner at church.

Made this for a Halloween party and it was great! I think that adding a taco packet to this recipe would give it a nice burst of flavor so maybe I'll try that next time. All in all a good recipe and the whole dish went!

Came out ok...more like nachos than a casserole. As others suggested, I put the sour cream on the side when serving. Chips did get soft, but I haven't figured out a way to avoid this yet.

Delicious!  I made this for some picky eaters.  And they came back for seconds.  I did follow advice from other reviews.  Instead of corn chips, I used corn tortillas, (next time I'll tear them in pieces). I cooked the meat in taco seasoning, added green chilis and left off the olives.  I'll be making this monthly.

I really liked this recipe! I used black beans instead of chili beans since I only had black beans on hand. I also used red pepper and sweet onion. I followed some reviewers advice and used taco seasoning on the ground beef, and I would definitely recommend doing that. It gave it a lot of great flavor. I also decided to use crushed doritos instead of plain tortilla chips, and I thought that change put it over the top. My husband and little girl loved it, and I will definitely make it again!

This is a keeper. Fast and easy to make for those nights when you need to hurry and put something on the table. We loved it.

The flavor was very good, but the chips were soggy.  Next time I will skip the chips at the bottom and just scoop the casserole like a dip.   I took the advice of others and added a package of taco seasoning to the ground beef.  Instead of chili beans, I added a can of refried beans.  Also, I skipped the sour cream layer and just added it on top of the individual servings.

This was an awesome dish. I made a few modifications such as I added taco seasoning to the ground beef and I used flour tortillas for the base of each layer i made two layers. I topped the tomatoes with the tortilla chips. Thanks for this taste of Mexico.

Great weekday meal, but too heavy to eat it all the time.   The Family loved it.   I added some garlic, taco seasoning, chili poweder and green chilies.

This was really good and I thank you for sharing it Andrea!  I normally try to do a recipe exactly as written, but what can I say.....I'm lazy.  I used one can of plain diced tomatoes instead of chopping tomatoes.  I also did as others have done on here and threw in a packet of taco seasoning (the one labeled 'hot') after I browned the hamburger.  We don't like chili beans, so I bought Bushes Grillin' Black Beans (Mexican blend, chipoltle sauce) Other than that, I really didn't change anything.  I think I probably used less chips and cheese....I sort of did that by what I felt seemed right.  Was so yummy!  And that's what we're having as leftovers tonight.  I love this recipe because it is so flexible!  Hate olives, leave them out (we love them, lol).  Lighten it up by using turkey rather than ground beef.  Excellent recipe that will remain in my rotation.  Thanks Andrea!

After reading other reviews, I thought this might be soggy on the bottom from the chips, so I put some of the chips on the bottom and some on the top.  To our surprise it was not soggy at all.  Very good flavor.  I think next time though I will try the healthier less fat versions.

This was a hit, and super easy to make, I did layers with the ingredients and chips and spiced the meat up a little bit with some chili power and some McCormick taco seasoning to add some flavor, and i sprinkled shredded cheese on the top! we loved it!

Following the advice of other reviews, I added the taco seasoning to the beef after browning it.  I used reduced fat sour cream which didn't seem to detract from the flavor one bit.  I crushed my tortilla chips pretty small.  If you don't, the dish becomes more like nachos supreme rather than a casserole.  It was well-received, as my husband asked me to make this dish again.

My family loves this dish.  The only changes that I made were instead of Salsa I used medium Picante Sauce because I didn't want to have to take time to go to the store.  I used 1 cup of Roma tomatoes and shredded Mexican Cheese.  I, too, decided to have the tortilla chips separate for dunking.  Excellent!

I didn't mind this casserole, I used ground turkey instead of the beef and added green pepper and onion with the sala/meat combo.  We really disliked the crushed chip bottom, it went soggy and gave it a weird texture and taste.  I think it would be a great dish, if the chips were ommited and served on the side.

This turned out great! I added taco seasoning to the salsa and added it  to the meat. I thought that 3 cups of crushed tortilla chips was good, I even added a bit more. I mixed mozzarella with the cheddar cheese and it tasted great. I'll be making this again!

I changed the recipe a little by doing the taco seasoning than the salsa.  It seemed a little dry.  I don't know if I will try again.  I would recommend adding more sauce.

Based on previous reviews I used less than 2C crushed tortilla chips but for us it wasn't enough.  Next time I'll use about 2 1/2C.  Also, it definitely did need the taco mix for more flavor.  Also, next time I'll add at least twice as many sliced olives.  It was a big hit with everyone.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very good. I cooked the meat and added taco seasoning to give it a little more flavor. Next time I'm going to try with Doritos crushed in the bottoem instead of plain chips. My hsuband suggested and said it would add more flavor.

Cooking is an art not a science. I rarely make a recipe as written. This was yummy. I used black beans as suggested, added white onion and my own taco seasoning to the browned beef. Corn makes a nice addition. My sour cream was green, so I used greek yogurt as a substitute. I like the idea of sour cream on the side. This is easy & quick to pull together.

Pretty good.  I cut down the chips and it was soupier that way--not sure I should've cut those down.  I left the olives whole bc bf doesn't like them and that way it's easier to pick them out.  Bc it was soupy, it would be good on tortillas I think or served as a dip.  Next time I'll do more chips as the recipe suggested.  It was a bit too much sour cream for my taste, but that's easily cut down.  Thanks for the recipe.

I bought a cheap salsa, and paid the price. I really didn't like the taste, but I think it was mostly b/c of poor quality salsa.  I lived in Mexico and ate homemade salsa there-- it may have been much better with homemade.

Very nice - I made the same changes some other people made, with the addition of using fake meat instead of beef (I'm vegetarian).  I would only suggest that if replacing chips with tortillas, it's probably best to use several layers, or make the layers a little thicker than one tortilla thick - otherwise they tend to get kind of lost in there, and then it does seem more like a side than a main dish.

I substituted the ingredients for ground turkey and fat free ingredients and it was absolutely delicious.  My children love it, too.

This is the first review that I have decided to write. I love this site as I am not a creative cook and need all the suggestion I can get! This is the easiest yet flavorful dish I have made. I did like others suggested and chopped half an onion and added some minced garlic to the meat as it was cooking along with taco seasoning. I used flour tortillas instead of chips and added rice on top of the beef mixture. I left out the sour cream because my boyfriend does not like it and just added some to my serving. As suggested I also used Rotel tomatoes on top. Next time I think I will use black beans and maybe add some Mexi-Corn as well. DELICIOUS!!

Really like this, have made it several times.  Have never made it exactly to the recipe as I'm always missing at least one ingredient.  The recipe is a good base that you can make several changes to.

I substituted ground turkey, black beans, and rotel tomatoes.  As the turkey was browning, I added chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder.  I also added a small can of chopped chilis to the salsa, and added the beans at the same time as the salsa for simmering purposes.  I omitted the olives.   This is yummy, but a bit time-consuming for a weeknight meal--especially when you are just making a casserole.   We will have this again, and I may try experimenting with creating layers using corn tortillas.

I had most of the ingredients in the fridge, and didn't feel like spending a ton of time in the kitchen last night. Didn't have green onions but did have whole green chilies so I chopped those up and my hubby went nutty over this!! Simple and delicious.

I thought it was okay, maybe try again with fewer chips - and right out of the oven (everyone got distracted by the new puppy).  My wife and her friend would probably have given it a four, but my friend's son didn't like it much at all.  We substituted red pepper for the beans as my wife really, really hates beans.

This was good. I changed the recipe based on what I had on hand and on the other reviews.  I used a lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb of Italian turkey sausage that I needed to use up, only 2 cups of tortilla chips, light sour cream, and petite diced canned tomatoes. I also added chopped onion and garlic to the beef mixture, along with taco seasoning and some jalapenos.  I also added some cayenne and cilantro.  The only thing that I did not like about this was that the chips got too mushy.  If I were to make this again I would not crush them.  Thanks

I did the same thing the other reviewer did. I put taco seasoning in the ground beef then mixed in a can of drained black beans and Rotel. Simmered it together for a few minutes then spooned on top of the crushed corn chip crust, low fat sour cream on top and then shredded cheddar jack cheese and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. My whole family loved it! We will make this often.

This is super easy and turned out well. I added corn and half a packet of taco seasoning to the meat mixture, and used ground turkey and black beans instead. Even my picky 9 year old ate it.

I would definitely use black beans next time instead of the chili beans and I actually used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes due to tomatoes being so expensive this season (freezes in Florida).  However, the recipe is great as it is!

deserves 5 stars - will take tip from other reviewer and buy chips from the mexican rest. to use next time as the store bought were ok but I imagine those would hold up better!  was unsure of using chili beans but they were great and next time I won't drain because I think it would've added extra kick with the sauce.  This could almost be an appitizer with a big bowl of chips placed next to it!!

My husband loved the flavor despite his cold - there's definitely flavor in this dish! I added taco seasoning and onions to the ground beef. If I have beans and green onions I'll add them next time so it should be even better. Really easy dish for one of "those" nights.

I thought it was just okay, but both of my kids loved it and ate a ton.  I think I'll add some taco seasoning or cumin and chili powder to the meat mixture like another reviewer suggested and see how it goes.

Very flavorful! My family really enjoyed this meal. the only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the prep time seemed too long for a dish like this.

We loved this recipe! But with few "changes". I used original tortillas instead of tortila chips and called it: "Mexican pizza", due to the final round shape + melted cheese. My husband loves it!

Really yummy. The only drawback was that I did not see the purpose of putting chips on the bottom and it did not set well. We ended up dipping tortilla chips in it...and we very much liked it that way.

Yummy! I made a vegetarian version of this casserole in addition to the original recipe and my family loved both. (For the veggie casserole I omitted the hamburger and added more beans.)

Very good and easy to make.  I made this tostito chips on the bottom, just a think layer.  I used lean ground turkey instead of beef and added some taco and chili seasoning (had a little of each left over).  I used one medium jar of newman's own salsa, pinto beans, lowfat sour cream and lowfat cheese. I didn't have any green onion so skipped that, but did add some onion in the meat.  I also crushed a few more chips and added to the top just under the cheese layer.  It was very tasty - my boyfriend and I went back for thirds!

I didn't love it, but my family did.  I used what I had in the house - chorizo rather than ground beef, and a blend of tomato based sauces as I only had half a jar of salsa - added taco sauce and diced tomatoes to that. Regular yellow onion versus green and did add some mexican rice in the layering. It was good but not a great for me. Again, my husband and daughter had seconds and wanted the rest in their lunches for tomorrow...so its probably just me.

Awesome! The chip bottom got soggy after baking and that was perfect! I don't like hard "crusts" because they scrape up my mouth. We didn't have any green onions so we used a regular yellow onion and that added flavor and crunch. This is an excellent recipe, I wouldn't change a thing.

My family loves this this.  I made it with the crushed chips the first time and it was a bit dry.  The second time I made it with the meat mixture on the bottom, a layer of flour torillas and repeated these two layers before adding the sour cream and cheese.  This is a quick and easy supper that my family devoured!

This is too die for it's so good! Because I was batch cooking it to freeze, I layered it with flour tortilla's and not tortilla chips. I personally think it came out superbly with the tortilla's, as I can imagine the chips get soggy. I used 1 1/2lbs of meat with all other quantities the same, plus I also used a packet of taco seasoning. Awesome dinner and very easy to assemble.

This recipe was great with some alterations. I added a box of spanish rice, used corn tortillas instead of chips, black beans instead of chili beans, and added a can of green chilis and some taco seasoning to the meat while it was cooking. I did not layer in the sour cream but instead let each person add it as they choose so that it would be better re-heated. I think this recipe could have been fairly bland as is, but with my changes I really enjoyed it and so did my boyfriend.

This recipe is so yummy!  They only issue I have with it is that the chips disintegrate when I put them on the bottom, so I just serve them on the side.  I also prefer to add sour cream on top after it is already cooked.

Pretty good yet the ground beef layer was blah. Next time I'll take the advice of other reviewers and add taco seasoning. I used sharp cheddar- very good. Family liked it.

My husband and two boys raved over this recipe.  Voted to have it at least once per week.  I only had 1/2 cup sour cream on hand, no olives, no chili beans.  I used drained canned diced tomatoe and black beans and regular onions sauted with the ground beef.  I will try the reciped as directed next time, maybe the boys will elect to make it. ;)

Yum!  Now this is comfort food.  I rated in a 4 because I made a couple of changes.  I only used 2 cups of crushed chips as suggested by another and I put 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning in the beef, again as recommended by another.  I don't like black olives so I left those out.  Next time I am going to add a few green chiles to it.

I made the recipe as written and thought it was "ok". Much too bland for my taste. I love easy dishes like this for a change of pace from tacos/fajitas/burritos though and think it could definitely be changed up to be a great recipe with some personalization. Next time I would use nacho cheese doritos for the chip layer, add another layer of cheese over the meat & bean layer and definitely more seasonings (a taco packet or similar) and finely diced onion to the meat while its cooking.

We loved this recipe-I layered in a can of fiesta corn (my husband's favorite)! We invited a friend for dinner and still had leftovers enough for lunch-cleanup was simple,the presentation was very nice. It's a keeper!

This actually turned out a lot better than I expected. I also made several changes to the original recipe including, using broken taco shells instead of chips, adding a little taco seasoning to the meat while cooking, only 1 cup of salsa, I used black beans instead of chili, only used about 3/4 cup of sour cream, and topped with Rotel tomatoes with chilies instead of fresh tomatoes. It was really good and had a lot of flavor. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

Very yummy. I used ground bison instead of beef and added some extra olives and spinach. It's a keeper.

This was very good. I had left over chili with beans, so I used that instead of the first 2 steps. I also added guacamole and a little taco seasoning on top of the sour cream, and used flour tortilla shells instead of chips. But with all the changes, it still turned out great.

Fantastic recipe!!  I did add about half a pack of taco seasoning, but I think it would have been just fine without it.

This is a great recipe.  I did add the taco seasoning as suggested by others.  I liked all three cups of the tortilla chips, they added great texture.  I did use rotel instead of fresh tomatoes and yellow onion instead of green because that's what I had.  The casserole was even better the next day as leftovers. Simple and easy.  I made the Mexican rice pilaf from this site as a side dish.  Delicious!

This is a different dish that add variety to my dinner menus. I think it was good but nothing really special. I used black beans instead of chilli beans. You can serve this with corn rice and avocado as side dish. I may make it again one day.

This recipe is such a great base for trying it a lot of different ways.  Want it spicier, add chopped jalepenos.  Have a lot of leftovers?  Warm and scoop with chips the next day.  We really enjoyed this and will be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used taco meat from my freezer, so it was seasoned with taco seasoning II from here already, which made up for the small amount of salsa I had.  Very nice for a weeknight meal - easier than tacos since it's less last-minute work.  Great way to use up tortilla chips from a party!

Pretty Good!  We added corn, black beans, canned jalapenos and sauteed mushrooms to the meat mixture ... along w/ a packet of taco seasoning. THE ONLY THING I did NOT like was the tortilla layer on the bottom.  It was mushy and gooey.

Made as stated in the original recipe with one change, black beans.  Very kid friendly, as you can recognize every ingredient after it's cooked.  Very important in casseroles for my 5 & 6 year olds....and they asked me to make it again!  Thank you for sharing.

Good starter recipe. I used half ground beef and half ground turkey. I added one batch of Bill Echols taco seasoning, a little lime juice and a can of chilis. I think it might have been a little bland without it. My boys really liked this. I thought it was just okay. NOTE: You might want to rinse your beans, to remove the "tinny" taste.

This tasted really good but it's not exactly something I want to serve my family for dinner.  As I was putting it together I realized that it's basically nachos in casserole format.  I think it's more of a party/potluck-type dish.

I followed the recipe and while it tasted ok, the consistency was weird. Kind of like mush. My husband didn't seem to notice and went back for seconds so it was a hit there. I just wasn't a big fan and probably will look for a different recipe next time.

This was pretty good. Just finished eating it and didn't mind eating it. I also didn't LOVE eating it. It was better than just "ok" but it wasn't spectacular. I didn't follow the reviews to use taco seasoning or onions, and it may have added the "jazz" if I'd have done that. Hubby is in there picking at the pan, though. Guess HE liked it :-)

This was delicious! My husband and I both loved it. We used it as a dip for tortilla chips for days after I made it. It's a fun recipe to experiment with. I added Mexicorn and chopped onions. Based on the other reviews, I used fewer chips and seasoned the ground beef with packaged taco seasoning. Also, as a new wife and rookie-chef, it's nice that there are virtually no way to mess up this dish. :)

Wow. This is good. I added 2 cups of cracker crumbs to the chips for the crust. It made a big difference in sogginess. I also added extra cheese and skipped the sour cream . It was great!

very good! We're not olive lovers here, so I omitted those, but I added refried beans (I did keep the chili beans) because to me, Mexican dish just isn't complete without refried beans! :) Very good recipe, easy to alter without messing it up.

This is such an easy and tasty casserole. My whole family enjoyed it. I made sure to use hot salsa, since we like things spicy. I also used a Mexican blend of cheese. I was surprised by the extreme positive feedback that I received from my family. My wife said she wasn't hungry; then after trying a bite, she ate three helpings. What do they call this kind of recipe, a keeper? Indeed.

This recipe isn't making it into my rotation.  I even dressed this up with taco seasoning, jalapenos, and rotel (rather than just tomatoes), but it was still only OK.  I think it makes a better dip, almost like a seven layer dip, rather than a casserole for dinner.

This Casserole was Very Very good! I did change a few things as most of us do. I used PeperJack Cheese and Sharp Cheddar. I Also use Black Beans instead of the beans it calls for. Either way This Recipe is Very good! My Family Loved it!

This recipe is perfect as is, but I do make a small change.  I use black bean and white corn salsa, which tastes great and you don't have to add the beans separately.

This was sooo good! I used taco rice instead of the beans, added the pkg of taco seasoning & also put Taco/Chipolte Ranch Dorito's on bottom & top of casserole. I got rave reviews - even the next day reheated!!

Great recipe! I added more spice and I did not bake the chips in the dish. I spread them around the plate and put the casserol ein the middle, like a dip, but that's b/c we like crispy things to stay crispy. Thanks!

Tured out pretty good.  I think the next time I will take the suggestions of putting the chips on top.  My bottom layer was a bit mushy for my tastes.  Otherwise, good recipe.

My husband thought it had too much sour cream but other wise it was excellent.  The next time we make this we will cut it in half or leave it off and let everyone adjust the amount after its done baking.

I used ground turkey and my favorite roasted salsa from Nopalito in Encinitas. Very easy recipe and seemed to taste even better when heated as leftovers. Very handy recipe for easy dinner or take-for-lunch.

This recipe was very easy to make, all ingredients you‚Äôd prob have in the kitchen anyway, or I did anyway. I did change up a main ingredient though, I used Fake Ground Meat as I have a non red meat eater in the house. It worked well, I might lessen the amount of salsa I use next time to 1 ¬Ω cups simply because this ‚Äúmeat‚Äù doesn‚Äôt absorb as well as the real deal. We both enjoyed it very much, we complimented it with more tortilla chips as mine didn‚Äôt say that crunchy on the crust, may of just been the ‚Äúmeat‚Äù I used. Either way it didn‚Äôt stop us from enjoying it.

I did the same as others and mixed and added some ingredients. I added sour cream as 1 of my layers. I also added a layer of melted velveta cheese. When I browned my meat I used ground turkey instead and added a can of tomatoes with chili seasoning. It was great!!!!

This is a staple in my house and it is well loved! It is beyond easy and pretty quick to make. I always make this with ground chicken or turkey, black beans, and I add sauteed onion and peppers and other seasoning like cumin and cayenne pepper to the browned meat. I don't know what I'd do without this recipe!

I have to admit right away that, like an idiot, I forgot to add the beans to this recipe.  *But* it turned out wonderfully anyway with these changes:  (1) I added half a recipe of Taco Seasoning I to the meat to give it more flavor; and (2) topped individual servings with the guacamole recipe from this site.  Superb!!!

This was excellent. I just added some beans to the meat mixture and I did not have enough salsa, so I added a little taco seasoning! Wonderful!

Per others suggestions I mixed a 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning into meat.  Cut the fat on this recipe by using turkey meat, low fat sour cream and cheddar - still very good. I substituted canned diced tomatoes for the fresh. The crushed chips on the bottom DO get soggy.  I liked this taste but if you like your chips crunchy I would leave out when baking and serve mixture with chips after baking.  Served over lettuce.

I'm impressed by how *delicious* this tastes!  My family of 6 literally fought for the last bite!!  I added about 1 tbs. taco seasoning (taco seasoning I recipe from this site), omitted the olives, and served with chips on the side.  This will be the appetizer for my next party!

This was really good. I didn't use olives b/c we don't like them. I did add jalapenos, though. The chips were soggy like some reviewers stated. It is very much like a nacho meal, and my family used tortilla chips to eat this. Next time I will eliminate the chips and just have them on the side.

OMG!!!! This was delicious!!! Only made minor changes. I doubled the recipe, so: Added taco seasoning to 2 lbs beef, used a can of Chili beans and a can of Black beans, used a can of Rotel in place of the tomato, and used small round tortilla chips (not crushed) and placed in a 9x13 pan and an 8x8 pan (making the dish a little thinker ). I served this piping hot with tortilla chips on the side.... This was a hit!!! I will make this again and again, and infact can think of ways of making new variations of this dish: same recipe but no chips in the bottom, after done spooning the mixture into torillas to make it in a burrito style, or agin, no chips at the bottom and serving it as a warm dip dish with tortilla chips at parties.... there is a lot you can do do with this delicious dish!!! Thank you!!! :)

I was a little reluctant about this one, just because the main ingredients are chips & salsa, but it was tasty and easy, and the leftovers disappeared quickly.  I cut back on the sour cream and cheese to save a few calories, but let's face it, if you make this, you're basically having nachos for dinner.  Not exactly health food.

I used taco seasoning with the meat and didn't add any olives. I also used rotel instead of fresh tomatoes. Other than that I followed the recipe. I didn't like the chips at the bottom, most of them were mushy. Next time I will either not use the chips in the casserole at all or maybe put them somewhere else in the casserole. Except for the chips at the bottom, I thought this was delicious! The reason I am only giving it 3 stars is because my husband and daughter weren't as fond of it as I was. My daughter wouldn't eat it at all after the first bite and my husband just said it was ok. I will probably make some version of this again but with serious changes so my family likes it as much as I did. Thank you very much for a different dinner idea!

Yum! I will make this again. Next time I think I will add some cheese directly on top of the chips as well, before adding the meat mixture to help keep it together. It did fall apart pretty easily. I also adding my own home-made taco seasoning to the meat while cooking it.

This was a very flavorful dish! Substituted with kidney beans, skipped the sour cream, added bell peppers and diced the olives.  My bf loved it and thanked me for making this meal.  Looks good for leftovers, too!

This is a tasty and easy weeknight favorite at our house! Definitely use taco seasoning on the beef, and a salsa you love. We use black beans because they feel more "Mexican" than red, and make our own salsa because we have an amazing easy recipe. The best part of THIS recipe is that it "changes up" very easily - my husband's side gets beef, extra cheese, and less sour cream; mine is vegetarian - no shredded cheese, but extra salsa and taco-seasoned sour cream. Both sides cook up perfectly. Delicious!

I was disappointed by this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as written (except I omitted the onion).  My husband is, in fact, making popcorn to supplement how little of a dinner he ate tonight.  

Here's what I would have done differently:
1) Instead of olives, use canned/fresh jalapenos.  I normally love olives, but I didn't like them in this recipe.
2) Use a different brand of salsa (I don't think I chose the right one) ~ or maybe even use pico de gallo instead of salsa.
3) Cook the meat with taco seasoning (like some others suggested) ~ my husband didn't like how bland the meat was.
4) Used less beans, or substituted black beans.  The chili beans just didn't add any taste to the dish.
5) Try using canned tomatoes w/ diced green chilis (instead of the salsa? instead of the fresh tomato?).

This was a good recipe, my husband liked it. He is picky about leftovers, but he said he liked eating this one as a leftover! I thought there was a lot of beef/bean mixture for my taste. Maybe will add more cheese next time! This one is very easy to adapt to your own tastes. I didn't know how the chips on the bottom would turn out, but they stayed crunchy, so I loved that part!

I thought this recipe was great. I used the bite size tostitos chips to line the bottom of the baking dish. This made it very easy. Aside from that, I followed the directions exactly. My husband would like me to add corn next time as someone else had suggested. I will be making this again real soon. Thanks!

FABULOUS!  I did add 1/2 lb more of ground beef, and used black beans, i added taco sauce also to the meat mix which i really think it needed for flavor, but i still give 5 stars because those were my own preferences and the basic recipe is there, i don't know why i have never baked sour cream in something but that is really the key, don't skip this step!

This was excellent!  Easy to make, too.  Only had to cut up a tomato and green onions.  I made it exactly as written with the exception that I didn't cook the meat mixture for 20 minutes, I only cooked it about 5 minutes.  Perfect mid-week meal!

This was very good. I used tortillas instead of chips and made it more like enchilladas. I also used black beans instead of chili beans, and cut the cheese to about 1/2 a cup. It turned out delicious like that.

This is delicious!  The ONLY thing I did differently was omitted the olives (hate olives)and the beans (didn't have any)...everything else was as is.  I think I may take another reviewers advice and add some taco seasoning next time to make it a little less bland.  Since I strongly feel that the amount of seasonings in any dish is personal taste and opinion, I give this recipe 5 stars.

This dish was great! I substituted seasoned ground turkey for the beef,corn tortillas for the chips, & low/reduced fat cheese for the full fat & it was still tasty. I also added some garlic & onion powder when browning the meat.

Wonderful. 
I did make some changes. I added liberal amounts of chili powder to the beef and salsa mixture while it was simmering to give it that chili kick, as I didn't have chili beans on hand. Instead of chili beans, I used half black beans and half chick beans, and I also added some corn. 
My boyfriend ate half of the entire dish, so this is definitely one I'll make again.

This was just ok. Nothing special. I didn't have chili beans so I used refried beans, and it was ok but maybe chili beans would have done alot more for it. Doubt it though. Not terrible but have had much better casseroles.

I added taco seasoning and diced jalapenos to the meat sauce! Excellent recipe!!!

Be warned that if you do have leftovers the tortilla chips will not be good. They were chewy so I just skipped them the next day. We decided to use extra chips and use the casserole as a dip instead!

This recipe was good and easy to throw together.  It's not something that I would make all of the time but it's great for those nights when you don't have a lot of time.  I followed other suggestions and added taco seasoning to the beef.

Excellent and very easy!  I modified it a little bit for our tastes.  I used ground turkey to make it a little healthier.  Didn't simmer it w/ salsa, just added the salsa and beans and let it heat for 5-10 minutes.  Mine only needed to cook for about 20 minutes in the oven.  This would work great as a dip too!  I didn't add the tortilla chips so it would still be good as leftovers, so my husband used the chips to dip the casserole instead.  Tastes great!

Delicious - BUT it is not ready in 50 minutes - they have down 20 minutes as prep time - it calls for you to simmer the meat after you brown it for 20 minutes alone.  Count on 40 minutes for prep time.
BUT it was delicious and fairly easy - my picky family ate it and had it for leftovers the next day for work.  That in my book is a great recipe.

Excellent start to an easy, great tasting casserole. Try mixing a pack of taco seasoning with the sour cream before hand. Any other peppers or spices you prefer should be tried.

This dish was amazing!!  My husband loved it so much as did I.  I did add a packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef while it was browing though.  It wasn't as good the next day as leftovers but other than that, I have no complaints!

Great, easy recipe.  My fiance loved this one.  I added some corn and diced chili peppers for extra spice.  I would also recommend using more olives (ofcourse I love olives). But all together, we loved it!

Great idea, I made quite a few changes and DH loves it. We used 1/2lb beef and added taco seasoning (cut down the salsa). We also used black beans and canned mexicorn.

I liked this recipe, but would have prefered a cornbread base to the tortilla base. It seemed a little greasy. I also saved the sour cream to be served on the side. I'd probably add it back next time and offer some on the side too.

This was a very good, EASY recipe.  My kids, who don't usually like anything with 'Mexican' in the title, thought this was great!  The only changes I made were: I added 1/2 cup sour cream to the cream of mushroom soup, used black beans instead of ranch style, and used 1/2 of a taco seasoning packet. So happy to find a quick, easy recipe that everyone likes!

I made this for the family and normally I get mixed reviews on specific dishes, but this one was a hit even with the picky kids!!  I used whole corn chips and also crushed some to fill in the gaps, and instead of cheddar cheese I used a spicier nacho cheese mix.  It turned out perfect.  I'll have to make two trays next time so that there is enough for everyone getting thirds!!

It was so good. We used turkey instead of ground beef.  I also baked the dish w/ out the chips and then put fresh chips on the plates and topped w/ the rest.  Chips were nice and crunchy.

My wife and I were looking to make our first mexican dish. We saw the recipe had hundreds of reviews and 4.5 stars so we thought we'd give it a try. We prepared the recipe as is, substituting flour tortillas and adding taco seasoning powder to the beef. It's "OK". Nothing special. Definitely no "Wow!" factor. The cheese and sour cream overpower everything. You can barely taste the taco seasoned meat. We couldn't taste the olives, green onions or tomatoes, and wondered why they were in there besides any aesthetic factor. You could easily leave these out. Probably should have left the sour cream out too. This dish reminded me of one giant burrito filling turned inside out. My 13 month old son devoured it at his daycare, I guess he liked it more than us. But the wife and I wouldn't make it again for awhile. You can't really taste the sour cream, and if you could, I wouldn't have eaten a bite! It's easy to make, I'll give it that. But that's all I'll give it.

I thought this was just okay.  Not sure what I was expecting. There was nothing wrong w/this, just nothing that "wowed" me about it either.  If I make again, I may make as a filling for taco shells.  I love mexican so I'm not sure why this didn't do it for me, but...

YUM!!!  I really like this recipe.  It was cheap, easy and good.  It tasted like nachos without all the mess. I cut the recipe in half and I had a little leftover for our family of 4.  

I only had canned tomatoes so I used those and they worked great.

My family enjoyed this recipe! I added taco seasoning(from this site) to the meat, as well as, 1 can of rotel, a bit of enchilada sauce and crushed red peppers. I put a layer of crushed tortilla chips on bottom, as well as the top. I didn't add the black olives, tomatoes or salsa. Not a bad quick meal. This dish would be great for a potluck dinner. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This is a really yummy and easy to make recipe.  After spraying the bottom of my casserole dish, I put the broken up tortilla chips right on the bottom like the recipe suggested.  I like it this way because otherwise the casserole wouldn't have a base.  The chips weren't soggy, but they weren't totally crunchy either.  I thought they were just right.  It was great as leftovers too.

This is so yummy!! I think it will become a family favorite. My son recommends I add diced green chilis next time. The only changes I made this time was I added some taco seasoning to the meat and a can of pinto beans to make it strech.

Not bad. I did change a few things.  I used taco seasoning in the meat, soft tortilla shells on the bottom and I add rice as a layer.  It is a good quick recipe to make for the weekend.

Great, easy dinner casserole! I took this to a canoe club potluck and it was devoured fairly rapidly by all the hungry paddlers. It was a really simple recipe to make and I had all the recipes on hand.

This was really easy and very yummy! I put the chips on TOP of the beef so they wouldn't get as soggy. You could really add a lot more stuff, or change it around. I thought corn would be a good addition. This would also be excellent over lettuce, an easy taco salad the next day with the leftovers! Thanks!

Good flavors...loved the tomato and green onion (I omitted the olives).  I used taco seasoning with the ground beef.  My chips did not get mushy at all.  I used tostitos.  After adding the taco seasoning I drained any excess liquid and also let the ground beef/ salsa mixture simmer at least 30 minutes to absorb liqued.  My family ate it right away.  When I took a bite before I put the leftovers  away the chips were not as crispy.  My kids loved the chips inside.  Will make again.

hmmmm. well it was okay. I used corn chips as my base and that was the problem. They got soggy and tasted more like corn bread mush. Otherwise it was good. maybe try with tortillas instead of chips. Or spoon the mixture on top of chips after baking.

This went over very well with the whole family. Leftovers were very good as well. I used ground turkey. Also, I didn't use as much cheese. And my husband added avocados to his. I was asked to add more tortilla chips next time.

Very good. Per the suggestion of many other reviewers I added taco seasoning, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and onions to the ground beef mixture. I also added a tsp of fresh garlic. This was good and is definitely a keeper. We really enjoyed it! Thanks.

Kind of bland unless spices added, but good for kids as is. Would also leave out totillas as the baking made them too moist which detracted from their flavor.

It was good.  I modified it some.  I used plain red beans instead of the chili beans, and I added taco seasoning.  I also omitted the tomatos on top.  Used chunky salsa (which was a mistake since I had to add tomato sauce and water to the mixture.  The kids and the hubby loved it.  I think it was a tad too salty, so next time I will use the low sodium taco seasoning.

This is awesome.  The changes I made were to use doritos for the chips because I didn't have plain tortillas, although I think the dish could've done without them, I added half a packet of taco seasoning, and omitted the olives.  This is a definite keeper.

This was really good I would have never thought of putting this together. It's like a taco but, not the traditional way. But, I did change a lot of things I didn't use salsa, chili beans, olives, tomatoe. Instead in it's place I used taco seasoning, black beans, corn. Then used the called for ingredients. I could have done without the crushed chips. Will definetly make again.

This was really good for how simple it was (partly because it's something you don't need to exactly measure out).  Since I'm not really fond of beans, I left them out.  For chips I used some Trader Joes ones that were made with corn, potatoes, and brown rice.  They stayed really crispy.  For salsa I used a medium pineapple salsa, which gave it a good flavor.

This was a good recipe.  I added a can of Rotel to the meat mixture to give it a "kick" and as a substitute for the chopped tomatoes.  I used plain yogurt in lieu of sour cream.  Next time I will add more salt to the meat mixture - it wasn't *quite* salty enough for my taste.  I'll make it again!

This was really good and easy to make! Like a few others, I added one package of taco seasoning to the ground beef, and then omitted the veggies on top, just because my kids don't like them. I love the layer of sour cream under the cheese, and the chili beans are extra yummy. I'm making this again tonight for the second time. The first time, I used whole round corn chips for the crust...this time I'm trying them crushed. Thanks again!

This recipe is a favorite of mine.  I make it at least once every other week.  I love the flexibility of it because if I don't have chili beans, I usually throw in some refried beans and if I don't have tortilla chips I use corn tortillas and it always turns out great.  Thanks for sharing.

I loved this recipe.  Followed it exactly except I did put 1/2 the chips on the top and deleted the olives because I am the only one that likes them.  My 7 year old and husband thought it was really tasty, my 4 year old only ate a couple bites (but she's really picky).  I loved it and it was really simple to make.

This tasted very good but was a little too thin to be called a casserole. We used it with tortilla chips like a dip and the kids loved it.

It was really good. We're vegetarian so I used Morningstar "meat", seasoned it with taco seasoning and added a can of corn. I also withheld the sour cream and used it as a topping instead. My 8 year old LOVED it. I might try layering it like a lasagna next time, but other than that, we liked it as is.

This was easy to make but the taste was boring.  My husband said it was unintresting.  This is the kind of meal you make when you don't have a lot of time and don't really care if what you're eating has a lot of flavor.

hubby is in love with this recipe. added red and green pepers, regular spanish onions. also took the sour cream out and made that a topping to the finished product. cooked sour cream was nasty and messy. also my hubby and i put tabasco original and mild jalopeno on top too. everyone loves this dish. hubby calls it the exploded taco.

Really, this recipe is just about the easiest thing and good, too (although definitely not low-cal!).

We've also made it with ground turkey instead of ground beef, and black beans instead of chili beans. For extra flavor cook the meat in a packet of taco sauce.

This did not work for my family; The kids didn't like it and even my husband,who usually never complains about any food said he didn't like it.The crushed chips were floating around on the bottom of the cassarole dish,and that made it hard to serve.Not great flavor either. It was edible,so I gave it 2 stars,but will not be making it again.

I was pleasantly surprised witht this one! I know it already had a high rating but didn't think that "easy mexican casserole" would equal authentic mexican flavors. Very good, easy to prepare. I made two, one to give, one to keep. Will make again!

I've made this recipe twice now and we really like it.  The first time I used 3 bags of the 100 calorie ranch flavored doritos on the bottom of the casserole.  While we liked the flavor, we did not like soggy doritos. I also used light sour cream & 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning w/ beef both times.  The second time we just used low-fat tortillas chips and scooped the casserole onto the chips - much better.  I also used a pinneapple salsa and it was yummy.  My husband really loves this recipe, so it will get used often.  Thanks!

This was very good and easy! But I did make a few changes based on past reviews. Added a diced small onion and garlic to the gr. beef, and then added a packet of taco seasoning. Cut out the sour cream and the tomatoes (bc of kids)- added green onions to just the adults. I also kind of mixed some butter lettuce in with mine taco salad style. I did not crush or measure the chips, just kind of spread some on the bottom. Same with the cheese- just sprinkled some on top. Thanks for the new yummy recipe!!

This had a really good flavor but it was a little dry.  I think about half the amount of chips would work better.  I didn't have 2 cups of salsa so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes with onions and green peppers which was still a little less than 2 cups but even with more liquid I think less chips would work better.

I added onions, red & green Peppers when browning the ground meat. I used Sharp Cheddar Cheese. I also added a few drops of hot sauce before it was ready for the oven. After it has cooked, some of my family added salsa on top, which gave it a twist. It had a kick that we enjoyed.

Not bad, but nachos are better.  Very bland.  I added lots of seasoning, 1/2 lb of frozen corn to meat mixture and fresh salsa on top.  Not crazy about the warm tomato topping.  And definately didn't agree with baked sour cream, so waited to put that on at the end, cold.  Don't be afraid to get creative with this one to give it that boost!  It has lots of potential.

This recipe was ok. I followed the advice of other raters and added taco seasoning and didn't boil the liquid off of the salsa. I still found it pretty bland. My son, who likes mexican food refused to eat it, yet my boyfriend liked it ok, but he basically used it as a dip to dip tortilla chips in.

this dish is average-simple to make but basically just nacho toppings or a burrito with no tortilla. Make sure you use a salsa with flavor you like as it can make or break this dish.

this was good but felt like it was missing something.  The salsa I used was fresh so maybe needed more spices. Also I used Trader Joes cuban black beans (had on hand) instead of chili beans.

Not to bad. I browned the hamburger with some taco seasoning. I also put the tortilla chips on the top instead of the bottom out of fear they would get soggy. Didn't bake it with the tomatos instead topped it with tomatoes, lettuce and extra s. cream. Kids commented it tastes like chili.

My family really liked this- but we did a lot of changes and took the advice from a few of the previous posters.  I added refried beans and green peppers.  I did not put the chips at the bottom of the caserole (a lot of people said the chips at the bottom made it soggy)- but rather added the chips at the end.  Great dish for something quick- not horribly filling- which is what we were looking for!

This is a wonderful, simple recipe that gets better next day or two as the ingredients settle in.   I am extemely busy and constantly looking for ways to cut down daily cooking and stretching my food dollars.  I made a big batch of this to last a few days.  My teenage daughter brought friends home for lunch and they loved it!  Thank you for a great, simple recipe!

The taste was pretty good, I used a veggie burger mix instead of meat as we are vegetarian. I only give 3 stars though, because that was one of the heaviest meals we've ever had! Nevertheless, it's tasty and looks pretty, I advise everybody to try it.

This is very good.  My husband and son liked it a lot.  I substituted ground turkey, and extra light sour cream.  I didn't use 2 cups of cheese; 1 cup was fine.  I used Dennison's turkey chili (gave good flavor, and I suggest using thick or extra thick tortilla chips, so they don't become soggy.  Also I may try putting the chips on top so when reheating they are crunchy.

This was great! I added an onion, some green bell pepper and a package of taco seasoning, and it turned out really well (even though I didn't have enough sour cream). I really recommend this, although it might be a bit bland without the taco seasoning.

This is an excellent recipe!  I made it for a church potluck and everyone loved it!  It's really easy to put together.  I did what some of the others suggested and added a package of taco seasoning mix to the meat, along with some onion and green pepper.  I used thick and chunky salsa, left off the tomatoes, and used a little less sour cream.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is easy to prepare and easy to customize to your own tastes.  I added an envelope of taco seasoning to the meat as suggested by other reviewers.  I also split the casserole into two dishes and only added olives to one, as my kids don't care for them.  Instead of chili beans, I used black beans that I already had on hand - with the taco seasoning added, there was no loss of flavor.  Also, instead of chopped fresh tomato and green onion, I used a well drained can of Rotel to top the sour cream.  I took this to a potluck supper and it really traveled well.

I made this with veggie ground hamburger and served it  at a party. I kept it warm in a slow cooker and had sides of sour cream and chips. A big hit-even the meat eaters loved it and were unaware they were eating vegetarian.

We all enjoyed this recipe.  It's easy and perfect for a weeknight meal.  I didn't add the tortilla chips to the casserole as another reviewer suggested.  I used shredded sirloin, added a can of green chili peppers, and served over tortilla chips, also used 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 Monterey Jack.

I loved this! I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a cook, and this came out great! My husband actually asked for seconds - with my cooking that's saying a lot. The only thing I changed is that I didn't add olives, otherwise everything was perfect. Yummy!

This recipe is one of the best casseroles I've ever made.  I substituted yellow onion for the green because that's all I had on hand and I used Mexican style canned chili beans.  It turned out great!  My husband, who hates casseroles, liked it also.  It's very good with garlic lovers salsa, which is what I used.  It's not bad the second time around, either!

Really good, and super-easy.  My husband loved it.  I love that I'll be able to change little things just by using different kinds of salsa, etc.

This is a great recipe! And one of our favorites. The only thing I changed was leaving out the olives and 20 minutes is enough in my oven.

I shortened the cooking time to 20 minutes. I'm not sure if it is the oven or what, but 20 min seemed to be plenty for the dish.

I thought this recipe worked better as a dip for tortilla chips. My husband had friends over to watch a game, and the guys really loved it!
It reminded me of restraunt style nachos. Very hearty & filling. I used a little extra cheese, it turned out great. Definitley a keeper!

It is easy to prepare.  My husband asked that we not repeat the recipe and that is not normal.  My son did not like all the sour cream.  In my opinion, this would be be better if left unbaked and used as a dip for the chips.

kids were not to excited with the sour cream layer - next time i think that i will serve that on the side.  Over all it was very good and satisfying!   Glad that I made enough for leftovers!

I'm afraid I found this to be really bland. My adult guests ate it (though didn't want second helpings) but all the kids really disliked it.

I made this for our covered dish supper at church and everyone loved this recipe. Some even asked for the recipe. I did not have the chili beans to put into it but did have a can of refried beans which I used along with a package of chili seasoning. It worked out extremely well. I also used a Pampered Chef pan to cook it in and my chips on the bottom were not soggy at all! My daughter, who loves mexican food but does not like beans, loved this dish!!!

This was sooo good!!!  I didn't put in the chips though. Instead of the fresh tomato, I added an 8oz can of tomato sauce. For a healthier meal, I used ground turkey and fat free sour cream!!! Will make this again!!!

Loved this recipe!!! It was so quick and easy, just like the title :) I guess my salsa I used was pretty thick and chunky, so I didn't need to let it simmer for 20 minutes, only a couple. Other than that it turned out just perfect, the whole family loved it. You could even serve with tortilla chips on the side and make it go even further (for parties or potlucks). Thanks Andrea!

I enjoyed this very much, but my husband only thought it was 'ok'.  (he doesn't like mexican food much though)  A good alternative to tacos.  Serve with spanish rice & bread.  I will keep to make from time to time.

I was hoping to find a great recipe for a mexican casserole, and this one takes the cake!! I have two finicky boys and they BOTH had second helpings...not too mention my husband and our friends LOVED it. It is so quick, so easy and so delicious. This recipe will definitely be made again and again and again. Thanks Andrea!! Great recipe!!

This was very well liked by everyone in the family. For my family of large eaters (4 teeneaged boys and one big loving guy) I had to scale it to 12 servings which I made in my Wilton 1/4 sheet cake pan. This was evidentally too much as we had it for two meals.

I added corn. It was more work than I usually spend preparing something since I dont enjoy cooking, but my husband liked it so much I will make it again out of love for him.
