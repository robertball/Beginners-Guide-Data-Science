I found that this recipe is geared toward tomato-lovers.  For those who want a less tomatoey refried beans recipe, my suggestion would be to cut back on the amount of tomato paste used.  Otherwise, it was quick and easy.

these ended up being a little too bland for my taste, but with a LOT of chili powder and some salt, they were very good.

I agree that less tomato paste and broth should be used.  I plan to try this recipe again, but reduce each of those ingredients by about half.

Delicious! I had a 'mexican night' for my family and friends and made these along with enchiladas, guacamole, salsa, tortilla chips, etc. They were a huge hit and a great healthy alternative to the canned kind. I followed the recipe exactly and loved it, although i did find it needed to be cooked a little longer - closer to about 20-25 mins to make sure the liquid cooked out enough to reach the desired consistantly.

I agree that you don't need nearly as much tomato paste nor broth. The flavor wasn't too bad, but I think I'll just stick to the canned stuff.

Too runny. . .but, you might be able to add sour cream and make a good bean dip.  Thanks, Nannie

Used 1 onion, 1 tbl olive oil, 2 cans of pinto beans, 1 tbl tomato paste, 1 cup veggy broth, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp cumin and a pinch of garlic powder.  Thought it was great.

My husband made this to go into a burrito.  It was more like a bean soup than refried beans.  Good flavor after adding salt.

a great foundation recipe that you can adapt to your mood.  My only critique is you most definitely need salt and pepper.  I followed the proportions in the recipe.  Once I added salt it did not taste overly tomato-y

This was super good. I added sweet paprika and salt and pepper. I ate it on top of Mexican rice with a bit of lemon for a refreshing tang. Yum

Although these were tasty, they are very soupy beans.  I cut the broth in half and still had to cook them down for quite a while.
