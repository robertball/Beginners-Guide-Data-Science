My family loved this!  I chopped everything the night before in the food processor.  Easy, and makes a lot!

This was very good.  I used previously cooked roast beef and just heated it for a couple hours.

I really liked this.  It was so good and tender.  We cooked it overnight- about 13 hours.  I liked the celery in it.  Added a touch of dijon mustard and part of a diced orange pepper.

Giving this only three stars because it was just okay.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  The beef was very tender but the flavor was missing something.  Also the liquid never did absorb completely into the meat.  I drained enough liquid off the meat to thicken it up.

I cut the recipe in half for my family and used my food chopper to pulse all the veggies, which saved time. I subbed red bell pepper for the green (it is what I had on hand). Being pressed for time, I cooked it on high for 4 hours and it was falling apart and was very easy to shred. My family devoured it! This is a keeper, thank you! :)
