The flavor of these is AMAZING.   If you're not a blue cheese lover perhaps these aren't the appetizer for you (but, then, you wouldn't be investigating this recipe if you didn't like blue cheese, would you?).   I was skeptical of the amount of filling/apple compared to the sixteen really skinny crescent rolls but it worked out just right.   Also, if you're tempted to make extra filling, as I always do because I like lots of "stuff" in my recipes, don't.  I made extra and had too much.  The amount the recipe lists is the right amount.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and they were perfect.  The filling is thick enough that it will not bleed all over your baking pan from the open rolls and the apples bake to soft; but not mushy.

With a couple changes, these were a big hit!  For the filling, I used 4 oz cream cheese and two tablespoons chunky blue cheese dressing instead of the crumbled blue cheese. I also used fresh rosemary and left out the pecans (my guests were not nut fans). A great fall appetizer!

I modified this slightly. I didn't have rosemary, so I used thyme.  I chopped one apple and added it to the rest of the filling.  I sealed the corners of the crescent so that it formed a little ball.  These were fast, very tasty and not too heavy.  The strongest flavor is the blue cheese, so I would recommend this to blue cheese lovers only.

A really good flavor combo, but the taste was too strong. Blue cheese is my salad dressing of choice so I obviously like the flavor. I would make them again, but cut back on the blue cheese. I would also chop the apple up and mix it in. The  'assembly' on these took too long and was awkward. With the apples chopped up, you can pinch the rolls into little baskets like crab puffs. Much easier, just as appealing, and less messy when you bake. (The cheese runs everywhere!) Kudos on the flavor combo though. The rich and flaky roll, the tang and zest of teh blue cheese, and the fresh sweetness of the apples is a great contrast.

After all the 5 5tar reviews I read, I was disappointed. Made it exactly as written but it was just so-so---definitly not a show-stopper.

I loved the recipe as written; however, if you or someone in your party doesn't care for blue cheese, or feels it is too strong, try exchanging part or all of the blue cheese for feta or cheddar.  I have also made the recipe with half blue cheese & half feta, all feta, and half blue cheese & half cheddar. I also substituted walnuts after I ran out of pecans.

We didn't like the blend of the flavors, even though we love blue cheese, rosemary, and apples.  Thanks anyways.

Wow!  We have made these 3 times and they are always gone in minutes!  Everyone wants the recipe.  I think we may add chopped Craisins next time for a little more dimension and flavor.  I like it best with fresh rosemary diced really fine.  The flavor just pops better than the dried.

This was a huge hit at my party.  Even guests that didn't care for blue cheese enjoyed this appetizer.  I will be making this again and again!

These are ver good but way to much blue cheese. The second time I made it I cut the cheese in half and that was perfect. Very interesting combo of flavors. WARNING- you have to like the cheese.

I made these for a holiday party.  Everyone loved them and there wasn't a single one left (and I doubled the recipe). They are a little time consuming and the next time I make them I will add more apple and rosemary.

These were a tasty and different type of finger food. I also added a bit more cream cheese, and sliced the apples VERY thin. They were quite good; I had to stop myself from eating too many before dinner. My only issue was that the rosemary flavor seemed to dominate some of them too much, almost giving a floral/soapy kind of taste in certain bites. Next time I think I will run the ingredients (minus the apple) through a food processor to make sure that everything is everything is evenly blended. These would be great for a party.

They taste amazing and look adorable! I used one apple and it was fine, will try with two next time. And there will definitely be a next time.

I loved these - so did everyone else.  I've made them three times already in the past two weeks.  The second time I left out the rosemary and the third time, left out the nuts - they're delicious every time!

I modified the recipe a little, using more cream cheese, and not as many apple wedges per puff. the taste was a bit bitter, and cutting the pastry triangles in half made it difficult to fit 2 apple wedges in the pastry. with a few modifications, it should be better.

Just made this and currently eating it while while this review. Very delish, and with butter on top, hot and amazing! But I read the reviews first before making, so I decided to have 4 oz of cream cheese and 1/2 c of blue cheese instead and I used only 1 apple cut intro 1/8 wedges.  Still one of the recipes I would definitely try for my daughter's birthday party this weekend.

so delicious & easy to make.
however, i did have to slice the apple wedges thinner. so for example, 1 gala gave me 20 or so slices.
& next time i will use granny smith instead. & alot more rosemary!
this ones a keeper.
oh, & p.s.... its not too blue cheesy for those of you who are not blue cheese lovers..

Made these for the first time for a Labor Day BBQ; they went fast!  Found out 1 cup blue cheese= 5 ounce container.  Used 2 ounces of cream cheese, 1.5 tsp. finely minced fresh rosemary and Red Delicious Apples.  Sending the recipe to several other friends who demanded it.

Made these for my best friend's Bridal Shower that I was catering and hosting. They went over pretty well, but I had about half of them left. I tripled the recipe and used only about half of the required blue cheese and about 1/2 cup of extra cream cheese. They were alright, but I just wasn't a huge fan. I could only eat about one or two before I got sick of the flavor. Not sure I will make them again.

I love the flavors of the saltly blue cheese and the sweet apples but this recipe has too much blue cheese, even for a cheese fanatic. I think that scaling down the amount of blue cheese, and then adding a bit of sour cream (to lighten up the heavy flavor) makes this recipe more accessible for a party appetizer. I also recommend using more dough or making smaller apple slices because often, I felt like the stuffing was about to rip through the crescents. Make sure to add a little lemon to your apple slices after cutting to limit the browning; trust me, they brown fast!

These are amazing. I don't know if I like them because they're so easy, because they contain the best herb ever (rosemary!) or the fact that they're delicious.  Whatever the reason, I'll be making these again.  The only thing I changed was the cheese - I used feta instead of bleu cheese because that's what I had in the fridge.  A guest I served them to described them as "little apple pies encased in deliciousness" so I'm comfortable serving them to others...if they last that long.  Great recipe!
