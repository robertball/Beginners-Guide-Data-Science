Excellent and quick.  Great for lunch.  I did make a few minor changes.  I did 1 egg per serving.  Used sodium soy sauce and coconut aminos to cut down on salt.  Added rice vinegar.  Added red pepper flakes.  Added all to taste, found needed less soy than recipe suggested.  Used "fresh" riced cauliflower not frozed, so added some diced carrots and some green beans I had on hand.  Added some pork loin cut up in small pieces so it would cook quickly.  Whole thing took about 10-15 minutes to cook.

I will definitely make it again!!   It is very quick and simple, and  it really did taste like rice.  I did add chicken to it, which made it a main dish instead of a side dish.  Next time I think I will try adding a little cooking sherry to it, but the basic recipe is quite good.  We had some left over, and I had it the next day for lunch.  It tasted even better the second day.  My husband  liked it so well that he asked me to make it again soon.

I made this a few times now and want to stress the importance of using sesame oil for at least some if not all of the required oil (not just olive or canola oil), as the sesame oil really adds to the taste tricking your tastebuds. Otherwise very easy to make and tastes pretty good.

Tip to keep cauliflower nice and light coloured, soak cauliflower in cold water for 20 minutes prior to cooking it, and pour the soya sauce onto the bottom of the skillet, not on top of cauliflower.

Bland.  I followed the basic recipe and added 3 veggies and shrimp.  I used sesame oil and added a sprinkle of fried rice spice packet and garlic and ginger.  Still bland.  My husband hated it so he added teriyaki which helped a lot.

I used a head of cauliflower, and just ground it up small. Fried 'rice' cauliflower is a favorite at our house and we'll definitely be making this version again!

Good choice for a low carb side. I added about 1/2 a cup of cooked frozen peas,  just a little sesame oil and a pinch of turmeric and cumin to taste.  Adjust the soy to your preference. I always use low sodium soy.

I was skeptical on this but do not like brown rice and really want to get more veggies in my diet.  I think it was really good.  I did use low sodium soy sauce because I have had a low sodium diet for years and once you get used to lower sodium everything tastes salty.  Definitely in the rotation.

It turned out great, being a vegetarian I just added more veggies and some mushrooms and I used fresh cauliflower crumbles/rice and low sodium soy sauce. I will definitely make this again.
