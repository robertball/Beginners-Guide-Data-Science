Oh my goodness! I doubled the recipe to take to a family reunion this past weekend and oh my, what a hit!!! Stuck to the recipe, no tweeks, just one substitution. I subbed out the almonds for pecans as I had them and walnuts in the freezer, and only a few sliced almonds. My brother held up a ziplock bag half filled with the Reynolds snack mix and yelled, "I scored"! I use tons more Reynold parchment paper than their foil for my baking , etc. needs. No stick and super easy cleanup. Thanks, Reynolds Parchment Paper!

This recipe has a creative twist with cinnamon, almonds, white chocolate, and cranberries that we really enjoyed! While I followed the recipe I used slightly healthier options such as non-GMO popcorn popped with coconut oil, raw almond in place of roasted, and I had to thin out the chocolate with a little bit of coconut oil. This was such a hit I am planning on making a huge batch to share with my graduate class as a treat!

I love how all the flavors blend together.  I used organic corn, which I popped myself (1/3 cup unpopped), which seemed to be a good amount..  My chocolate just did not want to melt nicely so I finally just mixed the softened chips in with the rest. When I looked at this recipe, I thought the kidlets would be the fans but the adults were far more enthused. I do have to say I probably would not have been rushing to make this without having the parchment to work on with what I expected to be melted chocolate.  This is a fun recipe that I will make again and again.

I used 4 cups freshly popped popcorn and added dried blueberries that was a delicious addition to this recipe. I also used up some sliced almonds I had on hand, toasting them in a dry frying pan before adding. I had trouble with melting a couple bags of white morsels before turning to a premium brand made with real cocoa butter that melted like a dream. This was delicious and I'm not even a white morsel fan. Yum!

This is so good!  My husband and I gobbled it down.  The only white chocolate I had was two of Terry's white chocolate oranges (the ones that are both shaped and flavored like oranges).  When I make this again (and I definitely plan on it), I will use the chocolate oranges again.  The citrus flavor works well with the other flavors.  Also, I was in a bit of a rush, so I put the parchment covered tray of the popcorn mixture into the fridge for an half hour to speed up the hardening process.

This was REALLY good! I had intended to take a photo, but we ate it all before the sun came up! It was even loved by my very picky two-year old! Great recipe and completely recommended. 
I used: organic popcorn that I popped myself, stick pretzels, and coconut oil to melt the white chocolate instead of butter. (package directions.)
Thank you!

Wow, this was really good. Not what I was expecting. I decided to make it, after reading the comment that this was like Harry & David popcorns. However, I have to say, I thought it was better. It is much more fresh tasting. I also used real white chocolate, which I now realize they do not use more likely. I remembered at the grocery store I wanted to make the recipe, but didn't have it with me. I ended up buying the 4oz real white chocolate bar over the 12oz bag of white chocolate chip coating made from powdered milk and not real chocolate. So, I made a 1/2 recipe. I was still short 2 oz of white chocolate, but it was plenty. I used a bag of Orville Redenbacher gourmet natural lightly salted. It worked fine as the saltiness, made it overall not too sweet as opposed to plain popcorn. As I was short some of the white chocolate, I cut the cinnamon back to 1/2 tsp for 1/2 the recipe. I followed the rest of the recipe as is, just breaking up the regular sized pretzels. This was a fun recipe. I had more than half the ingredients already in the house. Just never would have thought to put them together this way. Interesting recipe. ty

Addictive--if you love sweet and salty snacks, this is for you!  I didn't use the full amount of chocolate because I didn't want it to be overly sweet (there's a fine line between snacks and treats!), and added about 9 ounces.  My youngest girl helped me make it, and she couldn't stop eating it.  My oldest will love her new after school snack, and using parchment paper makes clean-up easy.

Very good! Comparable to Harry & David snacks. I used toasted, slivered almonds because I like the flavor and texture. When you make this, use a HUGE bowl to mix the ingredients. Thin the chocolate with a little bit of milk so you get an even coating on the ingredients. This snack mix is a little on the sweet side. Give it a good sprinkle of Sea Salt to balance the flavors. Very good!

This recipe has such a unique flavor! Cinnamon with cranberries and salted pretzels really wows your taste buds. I wouldn't suggest any substitutions but definitely make this for a big group and triple the recipe.

I made this for ladies card night. None left! LOL I used mixed nuts and I forgot the cinnamon. I think next time I will add some chex/crispix cereal, and leave the popcarn out since it doesn't hold up as well. This is a crowd pleaser, it will not last!

LOVE! The cinnamon was not something I would have thought to add and yet, there's no way I would make this without it! So easy to make and ADDICTING. Try and stop me from making this again.

This.Was.Awesome! This snack mix was such a hit, my hubby and 4 kids devoured it and then fought over the last handful.
I used a 1/2 cup of organic corn that I air popped in place of the unhealthy microwave popcorn. I also used Ghiradelli white chocolate to give it a really nice depth of flavor. My only complaint is that almond pieces sink to the bottom instead of mixing in with the rest of the ingredients. Not a big deal though. 
This is something that I will be making regularly when the family needs a special snack. Great for movie night!

I really liked this, but next time I will use about half the chocolate it calls for. I didn't use all the chocolate this time around and it was still a bit too sweet for mine and my family's tastebuds. My next attempt I will try to omit the popcorn and sub rice chex in instead. I also used way less cinnamon, as I didn't want it to overpower the mix. I kept the mix stored in the fridge after I made it which to me kept it fresher longer.

This snack mix is truly addictive. I did thin the chocolate a bit with milk, as one reviewer suggested, in order for the mix to get properly coated. The parchment sheets made for an easy clean up. I served this mix in fry baskets lined with parchment paper.

MMMMMmmmm good stuff. I used a mix that had dried cranberries, almonds, golden raisins, sunflower seeds and pepitas...along with the popcorn and the pretzels. Easy and delicious. cinnamon was a a different twist which I liked a lot. Love the use of the parchment sheets instead of the rolls... will get sheets from now on instead

Love, Love, Love this recipe!  Although my picture doesn't do this recipe justice, TRUST ME, this is DELICIOUS!  My white chocolate chips didn't melt the way I would have liked but that is something on my end, not the recipe's.  All of those flavors coming together work into a sweet and salty piece of heaven.  My grandsons ate this up!  The Reynolds Kitchens parchment paper was a God send for this recipe too.  What could have been a mess to clean up after turned into just crumbling up the parchment and tossing it in the trash.  What could be simpler?  TY for this recipe!  I will be making this one again.

This was super yummy!  It is also very addictive.  I found some coffee mocha flavored almonds on sale at the grocery store and decided to give them a try. They were great in this recipe.  I love the sweet and salty flavor combination in this and it is also very easy to make.

Extremely tasty snack mix!  I love the cinnamon in this!  I'm tempted to reduce the white chocolate next time, as I think it would be just as good with a little less.  I didn't have enough dried cranberries, so I used half cranberries and half raisins with great results.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really good and would make again with half the amount of chocolate I think would be plenty! Mine had to much chocolate and made my popcorn start getting soft. I did have to use some coconut oil to thin the chocolate as it did not want to melt smoothly. The flavors was amazing. I did used crushed pretzels instead of whole pretzels. I also made a batch with a salted caramel pretzel bites that was out of this world! The combinations on this is endless! The 2 batches I made were gone before I knew it. This will be made again many times with many variations. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I am a sweet salty FAN! This was Very good! Not crazy about the fact that my popcorn got stale too fast.:(( I used the Reynolds Parchment paper on a cookie sheet. I did have a bit of trouble melting the chips but I added a little oil and it smoothed out and I was able to mix everything together just fine. I like the cinnamon  too! Delish!!

We all LOVED this! I used a bag of microwave kettle corn and kept my almonds whole, but that was my only changes...great mix of flavors and textures. A healthy (and addictive) snack that I will def be making again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
